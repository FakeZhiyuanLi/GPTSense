       I don't know who to trust....and right now, I have to find a way to realx...yes, relax! It's not the end of the world... . My life isn't going anywhere...although it has its told on me (the annoyance that you get for wishing you can do everything at once!). ¬_ ¬ And the time passes...and everyday I grew more weiry. "Is everything will come out right?" "Will my life get better?"    ~~~~~~~This is my life to control and yet I am drowning in my own tears! Even if this is my life, I don't have control what to expect. But I wish that everything can be in my control and it will always go my way. It's my life...but I'm not in control.

       Everything was good until I have a nap and everything seems like it got from a happy, calm place to a war.   **********Sometimes you wish everything would come out right...but then it suddenly backfired and nothing you can do to change it. I never thought that during a little nap..my sister and my friend sees my boyfriend with annoyance and endless talk of nothing. I wasn't even there to turn things around...I wish I was there. Then things can come out right.   ~~~~~~Nothing to think about...nothing can change what ppl think. My boyfriend now has the name "jerk" all over him. Great!!! I am a girl who has a jerk for her boyfriend!! And I thought it couldn't get worse. It all happens with the complaint of a buddy icon. ---_---

       The lips are so lazy....    it only holds the love    within an ehcanting kiss    and nothing more.     &nbsp;   A heart holds many...    it holds&nbsp;memories....love...    pain...emotions..    But the lips only hold the love within a kiss.     &nbsp;   So lazy.....nothing else it would hold...    Only the kisses' love can be hold by it.    Even though that maybe be true...    the only thing I can hold is you.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In honor of all boyfriends who are honest and truthful towards the&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ones they love most, thank you.

       ~~~~~~~~~~I don't know what to believe when a guy leaves and you dont know what on earth he is doing!!! >v  **************Yeah, sometimes it's hard...but come on!! It's not like we girls can control! We are not capable to know where you are and what you are doing!!! Give us some slack! We have the right to feel that what you are doing may not be something important....    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trust and honesty is two things that really hold a bond. "Should I trust him? Should I believe he isn't doing anything suspicious?" Well, do your end of the bargin (trust) and hopefully the other will come back with the truth (honesty)

       My childhood was trash; it's enough to make me sick and make me think I am trash.I don't know why I was born since my parents will divorce and forget about me and my little twin sister. I feel like I am not wanted......my parents just get remarried and got themselves a new daughter. I always thought I was born to be happy and be as wonderful I can be. Now I see myself as a someone who only can dream and wishes.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no one to depend on...no one to call mommy nor daddy. I always wish to say those words...for just a moment. To see people having moms and dads torn me apart. I am no one's daddy's girl...and I will never will be.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The world is playing with me...I am their puppet. I play aong with their tricks...then, just then, when I am happy...they take it all away and let me suffer. They drag me deep into depression. I start to wish for the death of me. But the God just laugh and tell me that I can never kill myself. And it's true....I never want to kill.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will I ever die and live in heaven? Will I kiss those worries away? Will I ever forever sing the melody of the Songs of Dreams?.......

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes I wish that all guys know how girls feel. But you know, they don't and there comes conflict and such. Sure girls are emotional but at least they are to the heart than and guy can ever wish to be. The way we think and feel...are all connected to the heart. For guys, I would say the brain mostly. They may think well, but they sure can't give good advice when it comes to a relationship.   &nbsp;********Wow! How can you guys guess?!! Well I guess it is noticable how I keep ranting about emotions; yeah, I am right now in an upseting position. But sadly my boyfriend doesn't gets the point.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why? Well, considering how many people who will go to college, my bf is into working all night until like everything is perfect. Well, he never seem to remember that neither his computer nor his work will be there  to heal him ,  love   him ,  hold     him ,  nor risk their life to   save his .   It's like all he needs is his computer, and no one else will matter.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe it's a good time to say that ''I wish I have a boyfriend who is less wanting to work". At least other ppl's bf is nothing like mine.

       &nbsp;&nbsp; Isn's it odd when your boyfriend say "I love you and only you''? And then they cheat on you like a week later or something!!! ¬_¬ That should be illegal!!!! Come on!!! Too many broken hearts right after a break up!! Sometimes if that boyfriend doesn't really, really like you, then he should at least don't say "I love you" so us girls are less likely to feel more pain!!  &nbsp;********** !!!! WARNING !!!!  If you are pretty and the guy just keep talking about your looks, you are more likely to be dumped by a guy!!! Come on!!! He doesn't care much about you than he care about your looks! If you exchange bodies with another girl or got into a horrible accident, he will just start looking for someone who's more pretty than you. There maybe no perfect people out there but there are people that that guy can choose from!!! Be aware of this!!!

      Just when you want everything to stay the way it was...you go back to school!! ---_--- I even thought that it was too soon for school!!! But sure enough, things to do and a lot of things to be finished for tomorrow's plan. *****I am in love and well, but as soon as school starts, I may have to reschedule; I wish so much to drown in our loving relationship. But you know, I can talk to him when I'm done with homework and such. Great! Soon he'll have to go to school and more stuff to do will rearrange our lives! *****Okay, I'm a worry wart! I cant stop thinking what will happened if I don't finished it. I want to be happy but doing work is only getting rid of my stress over things. So even if love is the last thing to do....I will always think of it as I told myself "finish this and you can be with him".

       Letter from Trowa-Kun that was written on a piece of paper:      Dear Trowa-Kun,           If you don't remember what happened upon this date, well it is when you need time alone.Sorry to bring this up but I am only writing to inform you how I feel.***           I cried as I thought about how you left without saying a word.I remember how "mad" you were. I thought you hate me; I thought how much you wish I was dead. I start to remember how you will never say "I hate you" and how much you want to "sweep me of my feet" without all of the strictions.I cried even more cause now, I ruined it; I ruined everything. I ruined your life. I bet you wish I was dead and in your head, you're thinking how much I am a B.I.T.C.H. I feel terrible. I feel so low and like the most hated creature on Earth.                                                     *a pic of avatar which is sad and depressed as I*          I want no hate from you nor the feeling of even one little anger. I wish only happiness for you. Yes, I get depressed, but it's only cause I am doing it for you. I want to get out of your life so you will never feel the need to talk to me. And I will never get you in trouble by not letting you do your work. But today I feel worse; you didn't call me "koi" like you would normally do when love flooded your heart, and your wanting to be alone destroys all feelings for being together with me. You are strict in you words and not even giving my love for you a second chance. And beyond worse, I feel anger among your heart......anger that's made cause of me.
