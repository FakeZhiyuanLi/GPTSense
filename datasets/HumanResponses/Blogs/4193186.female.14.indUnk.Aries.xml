      Hellooo! I'm at the Sarit Center Internet cafe. It’s the first time I’ve been here since I got back: nothing ever changes.  Today, officially marks the last ever-day of summer. Pour moi. Technically it is a weekend, so I'd have in off anyway, in which case it's not a holiday-day, but whatever- the point is, I start school tomorrow. High school. I'm depressed and wish to stay in denial about all of it as long as possible, because otherwise, I'll get depressed, and moody, and I'll think too much about the school year which will lead to stress and result in me having a panic attack. As it is I won't be able to sleep tonight.  Anyway, I saw Mean Girls at Village yesterday. Liked it. A little weird. And not a very comforting "back-to-school" flick, but it was funny. I think my mom was a little horrified and felt no pity for any of the characters. Going to the Village Market on the weekend before ISK opens for the new year is insane, and especially for someone as anti-social as me. You run into a million people. It's a complete guarantee that you will run into at least 15 people that you know. It is also a guarantee that you will run into someone who you don't want to see. Those are not pretty odds. Every path that you take is a hazard, and timing is everything. Thankfully, I ran into a bunch of people who I did want to see, and ended up sitting next to Tessa and Pernille in the cinema, which was lots of fun.  So, um... nothing else up really with me... last night I watched two Sex and the City episodes with my family. (As it is a good, wholesome, family show that we can all enjoy together- NOT. Actually I only survive through watching it with my family by putting a big pillow in front of my face.) Once everyone had gone upstairs or to work, I watched Ordinary People, and had myself a good, nice, long cry.  Anyone been watching the Olympics? I'm hoping to get hooked.  I am already trying to start planning next summer, or at least my next long vacation, which is far too long ahead, but I find that I always need something to look forward to.  More Later... Kat  Tash- hope you're having a rly fun time in Thailand, I just checked out your blog and left you a message. Talk to you soon hopefully?!

      Heey. I think that I managed to fix the comments thing so that it is possible for anyone, even "non-bloggers", to post stuff.  "Mean Girls" is coming out today in Kenya!

      Hey. Apparently ppl are having trouble posting comments 'cause no "anonymous bloggers" (never thought I'd say that) are allowed. I will try and change that... somehow...  I swear that Harvey is going through a serious off phase. It's like the Great Depression. He just... sits there, in his stupid little corner. He hardly ever even wakes me up in the middle of the night. My mother, who has become seriously attached to the newest addition of our family, googled stuff on hamsters, and found out that they like to eat peanut butter. So.... seeing as he's all.... whatever he is... she made him a little treat of apples with peanut butter (that doesn't even sound bad in terms of human food). He just kind of crept around it and seemed to carefully observe this strange, new intruder. After awhile, he got bored, and snuck back inside his smelly corner. If anyone has any suggestions on how to cheer up hamsters, I'd love to hear from you. Too bad they don't have any self-help books for rodants…  Ok. A lot of people are asking for my permission to start their own blogs. Um… I don’t care?! It’s fine.  Anyway, last night I spent the night at Sab’s house and my parents came to pick me up at 7:40 am the next morning because I had to get my passport re-issued at the American Embassy. I went to have my passport picture taken at the Warwick center- it was completely gross- and it is going to have to last me that next 10 years of my life.  Ughhh.   Kat  Oooh, happy Friday/13th!

      There is something very satisfying about having your own page to post stuff on.  Anyway, it's 11:42 and the sky looks like it's clearing up. The weather has been completely gross in Kenya all week. I hope it turns out to be a nice day. I'm listening to my favorite Maroon 5 song, and in general, I'm in a good mood.  Last night I slept downstairs in front of the TV. Planning to have an early night (my days left of summer are few and precious and I didn't plan on wasting them by getting up at noon) I checked the locks on all the doors and shut the windows (I am paranoid) then I turned off all the lights and tried to get to sleep. Yeah, right. I watched an Alias episode. Once it was done ("bad robot"… hehe… never mind) I turned back on my side and tried to get to sleep. Nothing happened for a while so I resorted back to the television: flipped through our 3 worthwhile channels, and settled on watching some Nazi movie. It got long. Turned the TV off. Threw the remote onto the day bed and sleep was once again my conquest. I was comfortable, I had been up since 5:30, It was peaceful, I mean Harvey wasn't 10-feet away running on his treadmill like a maniac... this didn't make any sense. Why couldn't I sleep? I turned on the light and took out Jane Eyre. I have been reading it for almost a week now, and I'm only on page 143. It may be partly due to the fact that the pages are as thin as friggin tracing paper that has kept me feeling like I am getting nowhere, and it's not exactly the book that you rip through, but as I am not exactly engrossed in the book, it is discouraging how little I seem to have read. It's a hard transition going from Angels & Demons to Jane Eyre. This book quite detailed. You can get through entire chapters that's main themes are extensive accounts of the weather (cold) or the description of buildings (scary). That was an over exaggeration (typical ;) ). So I read another chapter. Feeling as though I'd done something productive with my time (I don’t get that gratification out of television), I tried once again to get to sleep, after peeking at the kitchen clock (4:00). Duuuudddeeeeeee there is nothing more boring than lying in bed (couch) and not being able to sleep, and feeling guilty and frustrated about that fact.   Suddenly, I saw the light. Heh! No, I'm serious, it was scary, it looked like the light beam coming from a very large flashlight and it scanned across the living room. My heart started pounding. My throat went dry. My body was as stiff as a board. I was sure that it was some guy trying to break into our house. My head was spinning: should I turn on the television to show the guy- ha! I'm up. Try another house! Not this one. No... bad idea, very, very bad idea. I will just stay still, it is probably nothing, I'll wait 5 minutes, I told myself. It was completely silent, all I could hear was my heart, and any other small noise I detected made me nervous and sounded suspicious. I looked across the downstairs at the front door, and the windows. Why didn't I close the stupid curtains? AHHHHH, now as long as my eyes were open they went straight to the windows and all I could imagine was seeing a stupid face on the other side of the glass, with a stupid hand, tapping on the glass. Tap, tap, tap. I was sinking, and trying to make myself miserable. So, to avoid this little hallucination, I shut my eyes, tight, and forced myself not to open them...  The next time I opened them it was morning, and the sun was shining through the sliding back doors. I am such a dork.  I never intended for that to be so long. Promise.

      Hello! So.... technically this new "idea" of mine to have a website, is, well, a scam, since I basically ripped off the idea from Tash, who just showed me her recently constructed website last night. Anyway, I thought that it was a neat way to let you in on the "haps" of my life, and so that all of you, who are constantly yelling at me for my lack of correspondence, will: a.) get a life (j/k), and b.) will now have a new, quick, direct link to me =). Feedback and comments are much appreciated, because otherwise I will feel like I'm just talking to myself. Not cool. I also request that this web address should remain... private? Confidential? I mean, I don't mean to sound so serious, but I am not interested in revealing my private life to total strangers, nor would I wish for anyone to be offended from anything I may confess/discuss in my postings. I'll try my best to update these postings as often as possible. But bear with me, for I am once again, setting myself up for a lot of people to get angry at me due to lack of contact.  Thanks!!! Kat
