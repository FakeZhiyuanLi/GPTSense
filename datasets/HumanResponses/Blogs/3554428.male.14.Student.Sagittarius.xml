      Put your head on my cheast. Listen for the pumping of my heart. Don't run away. When the bloods not running through my vains. Don't runaway. When my eyelids stay shut. Don't run away. When tears fall and hit my face.  Don't let me be put underground. Stay with me. Kiss me one last time. White lights are in my eyes. But then I see you.  Never leave me motionless. Never breath for me. I will always be. Alive for you.  Stand beside my side. You pushing my the hair out of my eyes. You look more beautiful then ever.  Living lives like it comes for free. My love. Stay with me forver days.

						   Family portraits. Brings back these memories.  These frames never broken. Still white smiles. Found on every person.  We holepunch these smiles  And put them in binders. For us all to see. In further years.

						   Writing these cursive letters in red ink. Turns wooded desks into a workspace. Notebooks skattered. Reveals hopeless stories.  Curtains are closed. Lights are off. But one remains. So I watch my stagering hand.  Writing my thoughts.  I then sign my name at bottom of the page. Hoping my words will be in someones mouth.  Carry on, so much time wasted. At wooded desks.  Ink is wasted. On these cursive lies.  Pushing back curtins. Turning on lights. One lights off. Notebooks are skattered in bins by wooden desks.

						   Our hands link under moonlight stars. Tears driped down your face. Like waterfalls. But as waters up to my neck. I still recover your hopless cries.  Your not just a pretty face. Think of me as I am. Remember me as I was. -------------------- Your second heart.

						   your arms wrap around my neck. Like a neckles pulled tight. The clasp is mended together. As your hands grip my neck. Never letting go.  Managing to get breaths. Your only a stragner to me now.  Glass frames Shatter. Words try to get through my throut. But your invisable dagers. Cut again.

						   .you send tears down my spine.  As rain falls from these skies. This man finds his refection in this hatred puddle.  We all jump in these puddles as if know ones watching. But judges hit there gravels smashing hearts.   This sun. Never shining. But the rays still seem to burn deep. Flowers turn dead with peddels blowing through toxic air.  Rooms with white walls is a highlight of false hope. You slide notes underdoors. You say anomunus. But marked tears reveal its you. Those black tears.  We hear faint cries of men. Hearts demolisged. Cries not answered. But in all shame we find reflections in these hatred puddles....   This sun. Never shining. But the rays still seem to burn deep. Flowers turn dead with peddels blowing through toxic air.

						   I am screaming your name. Don't leave me. My love. My Star. Hold this rose tight up to your cheast. Surender your heart to me. These dice we role turn out to be only the love square.   Pain pumps threw this hart. Lungs Strive for this air. So soon my eyes are watering. Pain and Love. Watch these falling stars. Both hands break but still I carry you.  "For what its worth those blue eyes reveal the best of me"  These tears. These heartless cries. We find our hearts mended by string. Not know these knots have came undone.  For I know those cursive letters have burned.  Between me and you. As you say goodbye. The last look back. Sends shivers through my hopless heart.  These tears. These heartless cries. We find our hearts mended by string. Not know these knots have came undone.  Lights out. Fly across deserted skies. You drop your knifes from a mile high. But still you seem to beable to punture hopless hearts.
