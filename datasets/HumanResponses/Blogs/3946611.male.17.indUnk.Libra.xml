      I've decided to start in on some intensive songwriting as of late.&nbsp; It seems as though my guitar playing has taken a turn to the more creative and funky side of things.&nbsp; The new song I'm working on is called Stronger Man and here are the lyrics:  a connection i feel when you're getting near i can, in my mind's eye see the the truth about you and me i don't have to think twice about the reason why i care you're the sun and the moon and the earth below me i am centred with you i love everything about you i can't live without you beside me, will i ever be?  the stronger man, i live my life, alone, can i bring myself to tell you how i feel alone, again, the world tells me not to worry they assume i'm in a hurry to, reject the best. they haven't met you.  you make me dizzy with my head spining round and round i'm like a broken record player i'll go all night just to make you happy dependable, the one who, listens, loves and understands you can rely, and i'll tell you why i, don't, see myself with anybody other than yourself, you i study the way your hair flows down i think that i have found i just want to be,  the stronger man, i live my life, alone, can i bring myself to tell you how i feel alone, again, the world tells me not to worry they assume i'm in a hurry to, reject the best. they haven't met you...yet  &nbsp; this isn't about anyone in particular and think that's the disturbing thing, i'm left with a feeling that i've created this character in my mind and matching that to someone in real life will be difficult.&nbsp; good thing i'm not looking for a really serious relationship.

       Still at adams house. The preparations proved to be worth it. I am still tired and it is 8:48 right now.   I am positive that i would not be able to describe everything that happened, the night was so long but so incredibly good.  I'll start with the joints: I was sitting, rolling for about a half hour, rolled 7 joints and suprisingly I was tired afterwards...hard work!   I made the punch and turns out it got alot of people very very drunk.  2 cans of concentrated lemonade  1 can of concentrated cranberry juice  1 can of concentrated bacardi daquiri mix  1L of raspberry sherbert (thanks welsh)  1L of orange sherbert (thanks welsh, fucker)  2 bottles of 2L ginger ale  40oz of Alcool (40%)  26oz of cranberry vodka  60oz of sparkling red wine  26oz of cherry brandy   mix it all together in a very large punch bowl and taste my creation, you very well may fall in love.   The evening went very smoothly, and Welsh tried shrooms for the first time.  This was an eye opening experience for him, he hallucinated about topics such as chinese dragons, fireworks and the alabaster room from 2001: A Space Odyssey. In mid-sentence of explaining how he was feeling he would break down in laughter and say something to the effect of "ahh fuck!"  This was right entertaining, even more so seeing as I smoked so much weed this night.  I was in on around 4 joints and ate a&nbsp;hash brownie. Later that night I smoked some hash, it finished me off quite nicely.   Everyone seemed to get along very nicely which was an extremely refreshing environment for a party. Triniboy was absoloutely convinced that Welsh was going to rape him and kept running away from welsh. Welsh played along and for entertainment snuck up many times on Triniboy.   Quote for the evening  "Looks like I'm losing mates, there's alot of hostility near my gates  we used to fight with kids from other estates, now 8 millimetres settle debates."  2 bucks goes to the first person who mentions to me where this is from...title and artist.

      Adam's dinner party is tomorrow, I am at his house now after passing out in his basement last night.  His parents are gone till thursday, giving us ample time to clean up after this event.    Today is the day we must start preparing the pasta and the pasta sauce, I have voulenteered my duties for this,  it will be the best pasta sauce in a long long time. ;)    Acquiring the drugs needed is no actual problem, but, getting people to pitch is.  We shall see how this works out...I don't want adam to loose 3 bills, but, it could turn out that way if people are stingy.    Whoever is reading this....Good luck to us, the chaperones.

      So!  This weekend turned out to be  MUCH  better than anticipated.   Things kicked off a little slowly, I was unsure of the other kids who were up there and my dad was determined to clean the cottage.  These were just menial tasks, the rest of the evening lay ahead.   My father and I started off with a beer and a game of cribbage, he beat me, as usual and then we began to prepare dinner.  We each ate a very large portion of steak and finished half a bottle of wine each.  Very impressive wine, Jackson Triggs VQA Cabarnet Franc/Cabarnet Sauvignion.  I eventually went up to talk to some of the kids in another cottage.  It turns out that one of the other families with a cottage up there was having a family reunion, so even their extended relatives were up there.    I started chatting with these kids, who, from the conversation I thought they were American, but no...they were just Bush-lovin' Canadians.  I won't go into too much detail about the conversation but basically I would bring up a widely shared point of view from anyone with a mind and they would try to justify what George Bush was doing.    For example:    Me"Bush is only seeking economic benefit from attacking Iraq."  Them"I disagree, when something like 9/11 happens these countries can't expect that nothing is going to happen in return, Saddam Hussein is a very bad person and needs to be punished for his actions."    At this point I would sigh and not talk for a while.  I had never expected to encounter this point of view in Canada, let alone in cottage cuntree.    We made our way down to the fire, with all our pockets, coolers, arms and hands stocked full of beer.  When we got down there, not too many people were left and all of the parents were completely hammed.  My father, George and Eric and Eric's wife Sue were the only people left.  For the duration of this beach/camp fire Eric kept hitting on this university student named Amanda.      Amanda and I had a bit of a fling earlier in the day,  we went for what I thought was an innocent walk, but, when we got to our destination (a rock face point overlooking the water) we ended up making out.  I was astonished afterwards, yet, proud of myself.  That's probably why it made it' way into the blog    More on the fire!  The parents start to thin out, George, my dad and Sue all leave and it is only Eric left...he is with his 9 year old son Brian.  Me and two of the other kids have been waiting for a while because we wanted to smoke a joint.  We finally decide to "go for a walk" and Eric asks us, completely from the blue..."You guys going to smoke some pot?"  Donnie "No, just a walk."  Me"Nope."  Jeff"Wait...Why?"  Eric"Maybe I could, uh, Join ya."  Keep in mind that Eric is a 40 year old businessman from Ottawa, and he is leaving his 9 year old son alone at the campfire while he goes to get high with 3 teenagers.  Who the fuck is this guy?    The whole time we are smoking, Brian is shining the light in our direction and shouting things like.  "Dad where are you!?" or "Dad, hurry up!"  When we return to the fire, Brian isn't talking to Eric and this freaks us out a little.   I can't help but feel a little nervous when smoking weed with one of my parent's colleagues.  What if at some point it slips out of Eric's mouth.    "So, I was smoking a spliff with your son the other day and...."  what the fuck?

      I am sitting and writing here while my dad organizes everything he needs to take up to the cottage with him.&nbsp; He is dragging me with him and I have avoided going up there so much that&nbsp; I think i owe him this one time at least.&nbsp; Let me paint a picture for all of you as to how this weekend will turn out.&nbsp; I will be sitting, listening to a CD and reading as my father is on the other side of the cottage plucking away at the banjo, only after we have to replace a few pipes under the cottage which really only takes one person.&nbsp; Maybe is doesn't seem that bad, but, I would much rather be back in the city. &nbsp; Last night was interesting.&nbsp; I got high with Arab and HockeyDaughter on centennial hill.&nbsp; I had some wine as well, but, I mixed white wine with red wine, turns out that when you do this, it turns into a toxic little blend of death.&nbsp; In Arab's car I was feeling so nautious that I had to jump out and throw up twice...maybe my stomach was just too full, who knows.

      the story of last goes as follows...  We started off meeting at Royal York station, walked east a bit to stop by the liquor store.&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point in the evening it was me, Arthur Wellesley, Welsh,&nbsp;Carioca and Chops.&nbsp; On our way&nbsp;Welsh meets a girl named Taylor who he remembers from a mentorship program he took at the University of Toronto.&nbsp; It was a psychology course.&nbsp;&nbsp; We start talking to Taylor and two of her friends, their plan for the evening is to get trashed as well...but they can't get any booze.&nbsp; We strike a deal, we will go get them&nbsp; booze if they give us some of the marijuana, they say alright and&nbsp;Carioca ventures into the LCBO.&nbsp; We specifically gave&nbsp;Carioca instructions to buy a 26er of vodka for the girl and her friends, but seeing as we were feeling a little welfare we told him to buy us 3 40's of malt liquor (preferably Old English).&nbsp; About 15 or 20 minutes later,&nbsp;Carioca comes out, he has one bottle of vodka for the kids and only one 40.....keep in mind this is to share between five fucking people.&nbsp; We order him to return into the store to buy more and he says, "No, I'm pretty sure the only reason she didn't card me was because her manager had just stepped out."&nbsp; We bitch and complain for a few minutes but&nbsp;Carioca isn't budging...asshole.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  We now need to decide on a place to party that evening, we decide one of the best, most seculeded spot is the graveyard a few blocks east of where we were.&nbsp; This seems a little morbid, but, once you get a little alcohol in you all your inhibitions about partying on top the rotting corpses of past loved ones, fly away.&nbsp; We get things underway, 9 or 10 of us just enjoying ourselves.&nbsp; The 40 makes it's rounds, it's done pretty quickly, then vodka makes it's way around, it is also done relatively quickly.&nbsp; I personally despise vodka, it's one of the more foul tasting liquors, next to tequila of course.  &nbsp;  It is now finally getting dark and people don't seem very spooked out, I am hardly buzzed but i know some MJ is on the way.&nbsp; I start to break up the weed, and roll the joint...I soon realize that once dark falls and I am a little buzzed, I roll like the king of the Special Ed. class, I quickly turn the duties over to Carioca.&nbsp;&nbsp;Carioca had recently gone for a walk with&nbsp;Welsh and met up with out other friend, Army.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Army brought Pepsi and some Bacardi, good on him.  &nbsp;  As one can assume, the reason Army's pseudonym is Army is due to the fact that he is an active member of the Canadian Reserves.&nbsp; He recently was promoted to Corporal from Private.&nbsp; Before coming to the graveyard he had an army eye appointment...I guess even the Canadian army expects it's soldiers to know what they're shooting at.  &nbsp;  The joint is finally finished, after an alarming effort on all our parts.&nbsp; We spark it up while drinking Rum and Pepsi mixed in a now not-so-empty 26er of vodka.&nbsp; Everyone gets loose and starts to really enjoy themselves and&nbsp;I am instructed to give our drug dealer&nbsp;Buddha a call.&nbsp; I call him up and it turns out that he is pretty drunk as well but his crew is willing to drive out here to meet us.&nbsp; Another good guy is with him, our friend Arab.&nbsp; We are left for a while wondering when the hell they are going to arrive, and finally once we forget about them, a random car drives by us.&nbsp; This is pretty spooky, it is now quite dark in the graveyard.&nbsp; We all tell eachother to "Shut the FUCK up!"&nbsp; and we watch the car drive by us.&nbsp; I then get a call from Arab asking us where in the graveyard we are, and I am quit relieved.&nbsp; I explain that they had just drove past us.&nbsp; They park and all pile out.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Now this graveyard party is much larger, another 10 people.&nbsp; Most of the kids who have showed up are pretty rag tag, but there seem to be a few "gangsters" in the crowd.&nbsp; Everyone just chills, and turns out Buddha actually has a moral dilemma about partying in a graveyard, most others are pretty chill and cool about it.&nbsp; We smoke another bowl and chill for a bit, I mill about the crowd and finally Buddha and his boys decide to leave.&nbsp; Arab wants to stay, so the others leave without him.&nbsp; The conversation eventually dies down with the rest of us, Arab calls his boys and they are on their way back to come pick him up.  &nbsp;  We start heading out of the cemetary, by now we have been in there for around 4 hours.&nbsp; On our way out we see a car parked along the road through the cemetary, a little spooked, we walk by it and look in.&nbsp; It turns out a guy has brought his girlfriend to a fucking cemetary to bone.&nbsp; We peer into the car and Arab bangs on it a few times then leave them be.  &nbsp;  Arab gets picked up and that is the end of that.&nbsp; Not much more happens after this, the boys got pizza and then Welsh and I left.  &nbsp;  It's evenings like this that make me realize I am a stereotypical teenager...fuck.

       So this is my first post on my&nbsp; blog...I went with a blog on here because it seems that livejournal is all anyone uses.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hopefully this site will give you some insight into my insane yet charming personality.&nbsp; I will regail you with tales of my group of friends, hopefully the stories prove to be entertaining...obviously nothing in comparison to the tales of Tucker Max.
