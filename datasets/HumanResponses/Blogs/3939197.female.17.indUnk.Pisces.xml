       You know, I didn't think it would be an everyday thing, but the same people, at the same time in the morning keep on calling me...at 7:30am. It wakes me up every morning. This has been happening for the past 2 weeks. I slept in one day because I left my phone in the car. Anyway, so I woke up at 7:30 this morning, had breakfast, went on the computer, blah, blah, blah. I had lunch. Then we decided to go see a movie. My sister didn't want to go. She hasn't been going to the movies with us lately. I don't get it. Oh well. Anyway, we saw The Manchurian Candidate. It was good but confusing. We went to Naperville to have dinner. We ate at Lou Malnati's. We went home and found Matt at our house playing ping pong with my sister. He stayed until 11pm. We had a bonfire and everything. He left then I went to bed because I have to wake up early. I'm going to Great America tomorrow! Woohoo! My aunt is taking me and my sister. We're going with my cousins. It'll be fun.       Last song I listened to:  some jazzy blues song at a bar in Naperville    Last meal I ate:  pizza    Last movie I saw:  The Manchurian Candidate    Last movie I saw in a theater:  The Manchurian Candidate    Last TV show I watched:  Newlyweds    Last time I realized I was a band nerd:  I started looking over my drumline stuff for band camp.

Last person I talked to:  Matt    Favorite song today:  The Reason by Hoobastank    Favorite food today:  grapes    Most interesting thing that happened today:  We saw a movie.    Funniest thing that happened today:  During the movie, this guy behind me kept burping very loud.

       I did my usual morning routine...eat breakfast and go on the computer. I had lunch and then, out of nowhere, I started reading. My mom interrupted with a call to tell me to mail her bills that she forgot to do herself. So I had to stop reading and drive to the post office. When I got home, I started reading again. I read until dinner. After dinner, we all went to the mall. We had to buy stuff for my cousin's birthday. When we got back, I started reading again. I read and read until I finished the book at 11:30pm. Something about that book, man. It made me want to read until the end. I don't think I ever watched TV today. It was very suspenseful. It's called Angels and Demons. It's a good book. Obviously it has to be if I wanted to read it. That's all I did. Read...and eat.       Last song I listened to:  something by Michelle Branch    Last meal I ate:  fish and apple sauce    Last movie I saw:  Jurassic Park    Last movie I saw in a theater:  The Bourne Supremacy    Last TV show I watched:  something on the Travel Channel    Last time I realized I was a band nerd:  2 more days until band camp    Last time I realized I was a chemistry nerd:  I don't know    Last person I talked to:  someone in my family    Favorite song today:  Meant to Live by Switchfoot    Favorite food today:  grapes    Most interesting thing that happened today:  I went shopping for the second time in a row.

       I'm mad. We were supposed to go to Great America today but the people with the tickets cancelled. The tickets expire on Saturday. So we can't go ever. Grr. So instead, I had to go pick out my yearbook picture at Feltes. Then we went to Naperville and had lunch at Noodles. The whole point of us going to Naperville was to try and buy tickets to the drum corps show at North Central. We couldn't. After Naperville, we went to the Fox Valley Mall. My mom bought us new clothes and stuff for school. Then we went to work out and swim. My sister and I played 2 games of racquetball. We went grocery shopping afterward. Woohoo. When we got home, I went online to the Cavaliers sight to see if they even have tickets left. They only have outside the 20 yard line tickets left which is fine with me and my sister. But my mom won't buy them because of that. Whatever. I guess were not going. Grrr. That's really the end of my day.    &nbsp;   Last song I listened to:  The Reason by Hoobastank    Last meal I ate:  cheeseburger and fries    Last movie I saw:  Jurassic Park    Last movie I saw in a theater:  The Bourne Supremacy    Last TV show I watched:  Aqua Teen Hunger Force    Last time I realized I was a band nerd:  I tried to buy tickets to the Cavalcade of Brass show at North Central.

       I woke up at 8am this morning. I had some breakfast and went on the computer. My sister and I then played ping pong for awhile until lunch. After lunch, we decided to go play tennis. We went to Big Woods and started playing. We were lucky because there was only one court left. We took it and these guys came right after us and waited. They asked us how long we would be there for and we said an hour or so. Then they asked if we could play doubles. I said sure. So we played doubles with some guys who probably were on a team of some sort. They were good. And of course I had my sister as my partner so we lost. We played 3 sets. Man, it took forever. We lost all of them, of course...6-3, 6-4, 6-2. The whole thing took 3 hours. We played 3 hours of tennis! That's intense. Anyway, I forgot I had an orthodontist appointment at 3:30. It was 3:30 when we ended so I ran into my car and drove away. After we got home, we played ping pong some more. We had dinner then played tennis for an hour. We went home and sat around until I got tired and went to bed.

       I woke up later than usual today...9am. I had breakfast and went on the computer. Then I had lunch. My sister made like a million muffins, so I had one. They're actually really good. After she was done making them, we went to Galyans to get some new ping pong balls and&nbsp;a grip for my tennis racquet. The grip is nice and squishy. It feels nice. We also rented a movie...Gothika. You know, that movie never explained what the heck "Gothika" meant. Anyway, we played ping pong when we got back home. My mom came home so we watched Gothika. It was very suspenseful. My sister thought it was scary. Then we had dinner and played&nbsp;tennis for an hour and a half&nbsp;so I could test out my new grip. It worked and I was happy. Then we went home.     &nbsp;    Last song I listened to:  Pieces of Me by Ashlee Simpson (I don't like that song, it just happened to be on the radio.)

       I woke up at 7am, had breakfast, and went on the computer. Everyone else started waking up about then. My dad told me I had to cut the grass even though we have no grass. All our grass is dead. So I had lunch, went out, and pretended I was cutting grass. I went inside when I was done and my sister and I played ping pong. My mom came home and I think we had the earliest dinner ever...at 3:30pm. We didn't even realize it was that early until we were done. So my sister and I went to go play tennis for an hour. My mom came later to play with us. Then she took us out to get some ice cream. We went to Cold Stone. It was great ice cream. When we got home, my sister and I played&nbsp;ping pong again.

       Today was the last drumline camp before band camp. All the tenors came, 1 bass drum, 5 snares, and 3 cymbals. It's funny because we were actually really good. Even Mr. Buckley said so. So we didn't warm-up for our warm-ups for that long. Instead we just did the cadence over and over and over again. We played it practically perfect each time which is great. I think this will be a great year. Hopefully. And we found out that there is going to be a drumline feature in the show this year. Woohoo! I can't wait. Anyway, Mr. Buckley said that the Cavaliers might practice at the high school this year for the competition at North Central College. If it's not the Cavaliers, it'll be some other corps. I'm going to go check it out. After drumline, we went to go see The Bourne Supremacy. It was a good movie. I liked it. We went home and had dinner. My sister and I played ping pong.   Then my mom and I went to work out. Then I went to bed.

       I woke up at 7:30am this morning. I had breakfast and went on the computer until my sister woke up at 11:15am. She ate and then we watched Spiderman. We went downstairs to the basement after and played ping pong. We decided that we need more room to play so we cleaned up the basement. Now the basement is kind of clean and we can play ping pong without anything getting in the way. It's great. We made room for everything. We even put chairs downstairs for sitting (Duh). We played ping pong until my mom got home. I had to retake my yearbook photo so my mom and&nbsp;I went to Feltes to&nbsp;retake my&nbsp;photo. We ordered pizza for dinner. We watched&nbsp;Something's Gotta Give while we ate dinner. We stayed home afterward and just watched TV the rest of the night. Then I went to bed.    &nbsp;   Last song I listened to:  Ordinary by Train    Last meal I ate:  pizza    Last movie I saw:  Something's Gotta Give    Last movie I saw in a theater:  I, Robot    Last TV show I watched:  I Love the 90s    Last time I realized I was a band nerd:  I listened to cadences today.

       I woke up later than usual today...9:30am. I had breakfast, then for some reason, I started reading. I did nothing but read until my mom got home. I didn't even have lunch. Well, when my mom got home, we went to&nbsp;work out. My sister came with us this time. We played some extreme racquetball. At least I was playing extreme. I ran into walls trying to get the ball and dove trying to get the ball. I skinned both my knees and elbows. After, we went to the new Super Target that's right next door. My mom was shopping for school supplies. That got me realizing summer is almost over. We went home to put all the groceries away and stuff. Then we went to Blockbuster to rent a movie. My sister and my mom wanted to rent Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen so that's what we got. We watched it while eating dinner. After the movie, my sister and I played ping pong. I went on the computer for awhile and then I read again.

       So...today I woke up early again...at 7am. I had some breakfast, then I went on the computer until lunch. Moe wanted to go to McDonald's because it was the cheap burger day, so we went to McDonald's for lunch...she paid. Hehehe. When we got home, I played Medal of Honor on X-Box. I've beaten it 3 times already. Maybe it's time to move up in difficulty. I went on the computer again afterwards. My mom came home so, of course, we worked out. At 6:30pm, we went to Feltes to buy some senior pictures. We were there for an hour. When we got home, Moe and I played some ping pong in the basement and the lights went out again. It was pitch dark down there. It was fun times. We still tried to play by ear. We didn't do very well. I think we lost another ball. Oh well. The lights came back on, so we went upstairs and watched some tv. I went up to my room and made ringers on my phone. That kept me up until 11:30,&nbsp;so I went to bed.&nbsp;     &nbsp;    Last&nbsp;song I listened to:  Diamonds Are Forever     Last meal I ate:  sandwich and a cookie     Last&nbsp;movie I saw : For Your Eyes Only     Last movie I saw in a theater : I, Robot     Last TV show I watched : Extreme Engineering     Last time I realized I was a band nerd :&nbsp;For my senior pics, I bought a pic of me with some sticks and a drum to show my band nerdiness. &nbsp;    Last time I realized I was a chemistry nerd:  I corrected my sister when she said that sulfur smells like rotten eggs.

       I played tennis today for about 2 hours with Julia, Melissa and my sister. Then we all went to my house to play ping pong and cool down from playing tennis. Julia stayed after and we watched the Cubs play against the Cardinals. The Cubs were winning 8 to 2 when she left.&nbsp;I didn't watch the rest of it, but I heard they lost. What is that?! When my mom got home at 4pm, she wanted to go work out. I was still feeling a little sick , but I went with because she said we would see a movie after. We saw I, Robot. It was a good movie. My mom didn't think she would like it, but she did. When we got home, I got sick again. I don't know why. I got the chills and my head started hurting again. I took some medicine and started watching tv in the family room. For some reason, our lights went out 3 times last night in 10 min. That was weird. Anyway, I took some medicine and went to bed at 10pm.     &nbsp;    Last song I listened to:  The Reason by Hoobastank     Last meal I ate:  popcorn     Last movie I saw:  Rear Window     Last movie I saw in a theater:  I, Robot     Last TV show I watched:  Storm Stories     Last time I realized I was a band nerd:  I talked about U of I Band Day     Last time I realized I was a chemistry nerd:  I knew tungsten was an element on the periodic table     Last person I talked to:  someone in my family     Favorite song today:  The Reason by Hoobastank     Favorite food today:  waffles     Most interesting thing that happened today:  Trying to play doubles in ping pong in my crowded basement     Funniest thing that happened today:  Watching Julia play tennis against a tennis instructor

       I had my DODMERB medical exam today. That was interesting. I had to take a hearing test, pee in a cup for the urine analysis test, and read a passage from a book. And from all this, they couldn't tell if I was sick. My mom and I went to Big Bowl, an asian food restaurant, after the test for lunch. What I had was good, but I don't know if that's what made me sick or not. The whole ride home I started coughing. Then my muscles started to hurt really bad. My throat came next. I can hardly swallow. I got home and laid down to take a nap. When I got up for dinner, my head was throbbing. After I ate dinner, my chest started to pound. I just hurt all over. And then, after all this, my sister and my mom wanted to go play tennis. Sounds fine until they told me to come. I told them I didn't feel well. I don't think they believed me because I got dragged along. I couldn't hit the ball; my arms were so weak. I couldn't bend over to get the ball; my head started to pound even more. We only played for a half hour, but I just couldn't do it. I got home and went straight to bed; at 9pm. Hopefully I'll feel better tomorrow.     &nbsp;    Last song I listened to:  some weird eighties song     Last meal I ate:  cheeseburger and fruit     Last movie I saw:  Love Actually     Last movie I&nbsp;saw in a theater:  Spiderman 2     Last TV show I watched:  Three and a Half Men     Last time I realized I was a band nerd:  I started talking about band camp.

       Today I woke up later than usual...10 am. I ate breakfast, then I played ping pong with my sister for a couple hours. Then I played on the computer. After that, I mowed the grass. I don't think our grass is growing. Both yards only filled half the bag. Oh well. It made my job easier. I took a shower then played ping pong again for another couple hours with my sister. I went on the computer again to play games then I ate dinner. My mom and I then went to go work out for a couple hours.

       I went to my cousin's graduation party today. It was supposed to be a "family only" party, but my cousins' friends came over anyway. I knew no one there except for obviously my cousins and my sister. Even&nbsp;some people who were related to me I didn't really know. Anyway, we were late getting there because they kept calling us to get stuff at Jewel and Dominics. We finally got to the party and saw my cousin, John, bartending at the bar by the pool. He was making margaritas and cosmopolitans (He's only 17). My cousin, Jack, was with his friends and girlfriend. My cousin, Max, was with his friends. My cousin, Morgan, was the only one I hung out with. I actually hung out with Jack and his girlfriend too. We swam in the pool for awhile until dinner. After dinner, we played on the rope swings they have hanging from a huge tree. We had contests to see who can climb the highest or swing the highest. John was the only one who climbed to the top. Some little kid swung&nbsp;the highest. We played frisbee for awhile and then moved on to bocce ball. At the end of the party, they had a pinata. It was fun trying to get it up somewhere and hit it without a stick. Believe it or not, none of the younger kids wanted to do it. It was all the high school kids. They ended up just throwing it up in the air and hitting it as hard as they could. It took one hit and it exploded with candy. Everyone started leaving, so we left too. My uncle gave us ping pong paddles and balls for the table he gave us. When we got home, Moe and I started playing ping pong. We played for an hour. Then&nbsp;the lights went out for some reason. So I went to bed.  &nbsp;    Last song I listened to:&nbsp; Hotel California by the Eagles     Last meal I ate : Chicken, egg salad, fruit salad, bread, cake     Last movie I saw :&nbsp;The Spy Who Loved Me &nbsp;   Last movie I saw in&nbsp;a theater:  Spiderman 2 &nbsp;    Last TV show I watched:&nbsp; South Park &nbsp;   Last time I realized I was a band nerd:&nbsp; I&nbsp;told someone I like to listen to old&nbsp;music we play in band.     Last time I realized I was a chemistry nerd:&nbsp; While playing bocce ball, two red balls were around the white ball and I said it looked like a water molecule. &nbsp;    Last person I talked to:&nbsp; John     Favorite&nbsp;song today:  Let&nbsp;It Be by the Beatles     Favorite food today:&nbsp; egg salad     Most interesting thing that happened today:  I learned how to climb up a rope upside-down.

Of course I did get off once and awhile to have lunch and dinner. I made a&nbsp;bad profile today in like 5 min. using the stupid PageBuilder on Geocities. I played games online. I talked to people.

       Since my days before I started my blog were more interesting, I thought I might sum them up. Here it goes:&nbsp;     June 3: &nbsp;Last Day of School!! My band nerd buddies and I went to California Pizza Kitchen for a movie night dinner. At midnight, I went to go see the 3rd Harry Potter movie with Denise, Corinne, and Nicole.     June 6:  The canoe race we were all going to be in was cancelled so we went camping instead.     J    une 10:  Julia's b-day. I had my interview for the Naval Academy today. That was interesting.     June 12-18:  I went to the Air Force Academy Summer Seminar.&nbsp; It was fun. It&nbsp;helped me decide that I would like to go there for college.     June 18:&nbsp; Melissa's b-day. I went to see the Festival of Brass with some band nerds. Go Cavies!     June 25:  Denise,&nbsp;Nicole, and I had a camp-out at Corinne's.     June 26:  I went to the&nbsp;drumline camp.&nbsp;     June 27-30: &nbsp;I went to percussion camp at U of Wisconsin-Whitewater with my sister. It was&nbsp;informative.&nbsp;I learned how to play the tambourine and triangle. Woohoo!&nbsp;     July 1:  I had to get my senior pictures taken. They made me do the weirdest poses but whatever. I guess they turned out fine.&nbsp;     July 2: &nbsp;We had a band nerd party at my house.&nbsp;We had a water balloon fight, threw a big frisbee,&nbsp;ate&nbsp;food, and watched Independence Day.&nbsp;     July 4: &nbsp;I went to my aunt's house. Matt came with us. We blew off some awesome illegal fireworks. That was fun. My cousin burned his hand and I almost&nbsp;lit my other cousin on fire. Good times.&nbsp;     July 7: &nbsp;I went to Nicole's house with Denise and Corinne to&nbsp;watch a movie. We saw 50 First Dates. It was a funny movie.&nbsp;     July 10-11:  Nicole, Corinne, Denise, and I went camping but got kicked out because we weren't 21. We ended up sleeping over at Corinne's house and going to the Windmill Fest that night.&nbsp;     July 12:  I&nbsp;played tennis.     July 13:  We celebrated my mom's b-day by playing tennis with our new racquets. We went to Olive Garden for dinner. My uncle gave her his ping-pong table so now we have a ping-pong table with no paddles or balls.     July 14: &nbsp;Corinne had a party in her backyard. Denise, Nicole, Brittany, Nisha,&nbsp;and the Katies came. It was fun gossiping about&nbsp;Nisha and seeing how she reacts. She got mad at us and said she wouldn't talk to us anymore but&nbsp;that didn't last long.&nbsp;    Well there they are...my more interesting days. Everyday that I didn't mention are the days I did absolutely nothing. I can't wait to describe them in detail in my next blogs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       I found out that the U of I Marching Festival is cancelled this year. This made me mad because this is the only fun thing we really do for band and it would've been my last year going. I want to know what else is going on that day. What IS the "scheduling conflict"? I don't know what this "U of I Band Day" is, but it better be worth it. Urgh is all I can say. At least we'll still have a bus ride to and from U of I. Those were always fun! Hehehe.

       Today was my DODMERB eye exam for getting into the Air Force Academy. It was a normal eye exam except I had a depth perception test and another test that was not normal. The whole thing took 15 min. but it took me 2 hours to get there and 2 hours back. After that, I went to go workout at Lifetime Fitness, rock climb, and swim. I played racquetball and cut my ankle with the racquet. Then I went to look at tile for our kitchen with my mom and sister. We went to 2 places and didn't get anything. By that time, it was almost 5 pm so we dropped my sister off at her FEA meeting at Panera. I have to pick her up in like 10 min. And in that time between 5 and 5:30 pm, I was so bored that I decided to make a blog. I think I should've started this thing earlier because my days were more interesting . I also played tennis for an hour today.       Last song I listened to:  Take California by The Propellerheads     Last meal I ate:  Pizza and grapes   Last movie I watched:  Drumline     Last movie I saw in a theater:  Spiderman 2     Last TV Show I watched:  World Series of Poker     Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  I'm mad about U of I   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd: &nbsp;I took Julia's chem test and got 100%     Last person I talked to:  Julia   Favorite song today:  The Reason by Hoobastank     Favorite food today:  Grapes     Most interesting thing I did today:  I had a DODMERB eye exam today. That was interesting.     Funniest thing that happened today:  I hit my sister in the butt with a tennis ball when we were playing tennis.

       If anyone was wondering where I was the last 5 days, I was in Tennessee visiting my cousins. They just moved there this summer. The first day, we went to their house. It's big. It has 3 levels. We stayed in a hotel room the first night. The second day, we went to Gatlinburg. It's a cool place. It looks like a town in Europe, propbably somewhere in Germany. It has everything. We took a tram to the top of a mountain and there was an amusment park up there. We went on some rides, played mini-golf, go-karted, etc. We went back down to eat at one of the many great restaurants. Then we went walking around town. We rented a cabin for the next nights and had my cousins sleepover. It was a cool cabin. It had 3 levels, a hot tub, pool table, foos ball, great views, and enough beds to sleep 12 people. The next day we went on a hike. It was a 5 mile hike but to get there you had to drive like 12 miles on a trail in the mountains. It was cool. That pretty much wraps up my vacation.

       Funniest thing Today was a day just like the others before band camp. I kind of miss band camp. At least there was something to do everyday. Anyway, today I had to pick up my revised schedule at school. I had to get there at like 9am because they close. I also finally washed my car window. It no longer says "DRUMER GIRLS". It was funny while it lasted. Well, I did absolutely nothing except go on the computer and talk to people online. The only thing that got me up was food. It's sad, I know. My mom brought home pizza for dinner when she came home from work.   After dinner, I had to drive my sister to her F.E.A. meeting at Panera at 6pm. When I got home, Denise called. I was like, "Finally, something to do!" She invited me to go to Sweet Tomato and then play tennis afterward, only if I picked her and Corinne up. So I did. I didn't care. I like driving...especially those two. They're really tall so they don't really fit when they're together. It's kind of funny. So we went to Nicole's house so she could drive us to Sweet Tomato. I didn't have anything there because I already had dinner so I just got a drink. We were going to go play tennis afterwards, but the lights to the courts weren't working so we played at the park. After, we went to Corinne's house and went to another park near her house. This time a cop came and kicked us out of the park so we all went home.       Last song I listened to : A song by Hoobastank (I don't know the name of the song.)    Last meal I ate : a coke and ice cream at Sweet Tomato    Last movie I saw : Sixteen Candles    Last movie I saw in a theater:  The Manchurian Candidate    Last TV show I watched:  40 Greatest Moments of Reality Shows    Last time I realized I was a band nerd:  I kind of miss band camp.    Last time I realized I was a chemistry nerd:  I found all my chemistry stuff and looked through them. It took me back.     Last person I talked to:  Julia    Favorite song today:  A song by Hoodastank (again...I don't know the name.)    Favorite food today:  pizza    Most interesting thing that happened today:  Getting kicked out of a park by a cop with a flashlight.    Funniest thing that happened today:  While at the park, the 4 of us tried to go down a curvy slide in a train and we got stuck for awhile.

       Yeah, so today was the last day of band camp of my high school career. Woohoo! As a last day brouhaha, the flags had a mac-n-cheese party that I was invited to so I went. It was at Alicia's house. It was fun. Everyone was dancing and having a good time. I even tried a couple of my signature moves. Great stuff. Good times. We left right at 1:30 so we were a little late but so was everyone else. The drumline had their annual trek to Dairy Queen. That was interesting. We marched two abreast. We were all spread out down the sidewalk so each section was a little off. It was definitely better than last year though...Buckley actually had to stop us, smoosh us together, and we had to start again. This year he never stopped us. I guess thats a good thing. We only had half an hour at Dairy Queen before we had to trek back. I ordered a blizzard like most everyone else. Andy ordered a strawberry misty with NERDs in it. I didn't think that was possible. It was great though...he let me try it. Along comes the demonstation and performance. The drumline did well except for Time Check. The quads were a measure ahead of everyone else. They tried to blame the snares but everyone knew it was the quads. Everything else went very well. I even thought the senior squad, Jayne, Julia, Steph, and Dan, were awesome. BNU!! Woot! That was great. Marjorie was laughing her head off. After band camp, the drumline went to Matt's house for a poker party. Other people came as well. That was fun. Actually, it was just me, Matt, Scott, Katie, Abbie, and Nick who played poker. Moe, Caleb, and Kelci played pool. I must say, for not knowing how to play poker, Katie and Abbie were awesome. They won every single pot practically. We played like 5 hands. We even played Blind Man's Bluff. That's a great game. Anyway, everyone left at like 10:30 so that's when I left with my sister.        Last song I listened to:  I guess it would be Surfin' USA.    Last meal I ate:  pizza    Last movie I saw:  I haven't seen one in awhile.    Last movie I saw in a theater:  The Manchurian Candidate    Last TV show I watched:  The Fabulous Life of...Big Celebrity Spenders    Last time I realized I was a band nerd:  Well, duh, I was just at band camp for a week and a half.     Last time I realized I was chemistry nerd:  I don't know    Last person I talked to:  Matt    Favorite song today:  Yeah by Usher feat. Lil' John    Favorite food today:  Strawberry Misty with NERDs    Most interesting thing that happened today:  Going to the flag party and seeing all the flags dance to all the songs.    Funniest thing that happened today:  See Mrs. Lesniak's car get written all over and TP'd then see her try to take it all off.

       My cousin is sleeping over tonight. We went to her house today to give my aunt her birthday presents. We went swimming there and she asked if she can sleep over. My mom said sure. Before we left we went to Galyans. Then we went home with my cousin. When we got home, we played tennis. My cousin has never played tennis so we had to teach her how. After we played tennis, we drove home and played ping pong. We went home and went to dinner at East China Inn. Then we had dessert at Dairy Queen. We played on the computer for awhile and then we watched a movie, School of Rock. By the end of the movie it was 11:30 so we went upstairs to get ready for bed.      Last song I listened to : Meant to Live by Switchfoot    Last meal I ate : Honey Sesame Chicken and beef fried rice    Last movie I saw : School of Rock    Last movie I saw in a theater:  The Manchurian Candidate    Last TV show I watched:  Cribs    Last time I realized I was a band nerd:  I listened to some drum cadences.    Last time I realized I was a chemistry nerd:  I don't know    Last person I talked to:  Julia or Melissa    Favorite song today:  The Reason by Hoobastank    Favorite food today:  honey sesame chicken    Most interesting thing that happened today:  My cousin came over.    Funniest thing that happened today:  My cousin swung the tennis racquet like a baseball bat so each time she hit the ball, it would go flying out of the court area.

       So...today I woke up at 8am. I mowed the grass today because our grass actually grew somewhat. This time I had to empty the bag twice instead of once. After I mowed, my sister wanted to play tennis so we went ot Big Woods. Every tennis court was being used so we went to go play at the high school. They were having tennis lessons so we couldn't play so instead, we went to go see the freshman at band camp. I saw Dan there hanging with the drum majors. When he left, Porter, Stevie, Sarah, and James came running to me and my sister to say hi. They had to get back to drum majoring so we left. Actually, before we left, we saw a semi-truck try to do a u-turn on Main St. and it got stuck in mud. It totally blocked all of Main St. It looked like it was ready to tip over. We left before we found out how it got out. We went back home for lunch, the we had to pick up Matt and go to drumline. We actually had the whole drumline there for once. I was in charge of teaching Katie Sawyer and Ed Koss how to play the cadence. Everyone else was on the Grassy Knoll warming up. We got new cadences to play. We played the cadence together as a group and it was horrible. We sounded like crap. Hopefully tomorrow we'll sound better. After band camp, we went home and worked out. Then we had dinner.

       Today I got to go to Great America with 2 of my cousins! Woot! I had to wake up at 6:30am to go to work with my mom so my aunt could pick me and my sister up there. We stopped off at McDonald's for breakfast. I think that was the fanciest McDonald's I have ever been in. It had marble floors and wooden cabinets and leather seats. They also had a buffet and a made to order omelet bar. Anyway, my aunt picked us up at 9:00am at my mom's work. We got to Great America at 9:30. We got our tickets and went inside. The first ride we went on was Batman. There was absolutly no wait. Then we went on Vertical Velocity with no wait. We went on it twice in a row. It was so empty we were able to just stay on the ride. The next ride was Iron Wolf. We just walked right on. We walked right on to American Eagle also. Then we went on the classic cars and stood in line for about 10min. After that, we went on Demon with a 30min. wait. We went on Raging Bull and it only had a 10min. wait. After that, we went on Viper and it had a 30min. wait. Last but not least, we went on Superman. It had a 2.5hr wait. It broke down 2 times while we were in line, but we stayed in line and rode it. By that time it was only 4:30pm so we decided to go on all the rides again except for Superman. We actually never went on any water rides because they had lines out the entrance. It was sooooo hot so we kept stopping at the bathrooms to get water. We went on some of the little rides like Revolution, Fiddler's Fling, Orbit, and Chubasco. All had no lines. We never went on Deja Vu because it was broken. We left at 10pm. We had dinner at Burger King on the way home. My feet hurt so bad from walking around so much. We got home at around 11pm. It was a great day today.        Last song I listened to:  Love Me Do by The Beatles    Last meal I ate:  cheeseburger and fries at Burger King    Last movie I saw:  Dante's Peak    Last movie I saw in a theater:  The Manchurian Candidate    Last TV show I watched:  Airline    Last time I realized I was a band nerd:  Tomorrow is the first day of band camp    Last time I realized I was a chemistry nerd:  I don't know    Last person I talked to:  Max    Favorite song today:  Pinball Wizard by The Who    Favorite food today:  cheeseburger    Most interesting thing that happened today:  I went to Great America today!    Funniest thing that happened today:  While on Vertical Velocity, some guy spit when we were straight up and it landed right on my sister's face. Classic.
