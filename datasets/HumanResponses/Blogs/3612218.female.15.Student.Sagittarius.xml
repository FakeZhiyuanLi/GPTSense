      My eyelids are super duperly heavy.. Im so gonna fall asleep any moment on this keyboard. Today was a longggg day. Emphasize is on the word longggg.. Can u believe it? I actually woke up at 6.00am today. Went trekking with a couple of friends. 20km, early in the morning. That can really kill. And currently Im having flu+aching everywhere. Meet those peeps at bukit timah hill. Went up was utterly tiring, down was somehow pretty ok. After which, went to macrichite* resevoir. We went up the jelutong tower. While we were walking towards the tower, I imagined it to be like gorgeous and like ultimate. When we actually reach there, its like somewhat the army camp side tower. Im so disasppointed by that. But nevertheless, we went up and had a great view of s'pore. Ha. Surprisely, we were able to see the changi airport and some planes flying by. -reminds me of my brother- ok, forget it. Then we continued our journey back.. Whole journey was like 11km, cuz we went round the periferal area. Was dead beat after day. Oops, I forgot to update this. On our way back, as we were walking. I stepped on an armani sun shades. Wow, its like damn cool. Looks like those oakley type. Stylish. Hee he, and we decided for ourselves that it should belong to us. Founders keepers, losers weepers. hahaha.. After the long trek, we went to Hans for lunch. Lunch was filling and great. Somehow, the food tasted damn nice. Ha. It muz be due to the tiring trekking.  Ok, that is all for today. Oh, went to study in the afternoon. At least, I did something. Ha. Im goin to bed. Too tired already.Tomorrow, tuition early in the morning. The thought of it makes me wanna zzzz.. Off i go, bye guys..  Shall update only on days when im free.. Or maybe when something interesting crops up. Bye for now.. -drops dead-  this post is written a few days ago.

      Well, I juz came home from playing pool with evelyn, narene and damien. It was very fun. Though, i kinda sux this time. I duno why. Nervous? Maybe. Im not sure too. Well, i cut finger while playing pool. Got plaster from the coutner, and nice evelyn helped me to put them on. She is nice! :))) Had dinner at northpoint's food court. The food there is nice but not very cheap. Chill around there with narene. And so here I am blogging. Stayed over at narene's place the night before ytd, stayed over at cyn's place yesterday. I've been staying out a lot lately. Too slack. Drinking a lot. That is very bad. Anyway, mum and dad is still not back yet. Kinda starting to miss them already. If u guys are reading this, I'll like to say I love you guys lots! Ha. See, Im a filial kid. :))) Not forgetting my dearest brother, hope you are doin fine over there. Enjoy yourself too. Dont forget to come back and visit me, your dear sister. I better get my fingers off the keyboard, and my butt of the chair soon. Gotta get myself to start studying and get that habit. Haiz.. Easier said than done.   Things unacomplished -Hols assignment -Newspaper  Things to be done tmr -Revision for phys -Newspaper  That is about it.  Today is not a really good day for me. But well, Im still happy on this very day. Some stuff are still troubling me. Well, I'm thinking too much. I really am. -shut myself-

Wondering why I've decided to keep a blog again? Well, many things happened lately. They are impt, at least to me. This is the year when I'm taking O's. I'll like to have some beautiful memories... Beautiful or not? That's another story. Wad else should I say? I've been a total slacker lately, have been wasting my time. I regret that. Totally! I vow to start studying from this very day. Im serious. Hopefully, I get some things done.   Things to do this week: 1-Finish up my hols assignment (which apparently is alot) 2-Read the newspapers  Yup, thats bout it. Shall update later. Outta here.  p:s// feel free for comments.

      If you're not the one then why does my soul feel glad today? If you're not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way? If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all  I never know what the future brings But I know you are here with me now We'll make it through And I  hope  you are the one I share my life with  I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am? Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?  If I don't need you then why am I crying on my bed? If I don't need you then why does your name resound in my head? If you're not for me then why does this distance maim my life? If you're not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife?  'Cause I miss you, body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today' Cause I love you, whether it's wrong or rightAnd though I can't be with you tonight And know my heart is by your side And I pray in you're the one I build my home withI hope I love you all my life

      Dont leave me in a lurch, at least tell me something. That is the least you can do to ease the pain. Please dont do this to me. I feel so dead. Really.  If we weren't meant to be, then tell me so.. I promise I'll leave and never question. Just dont do this to me. At least give me a reason, an answer to everything. Dont lead me on to something unreal.. If u have feelings for me, then why am i feeling this way? Why am i treated this way? I feel somewhat like a fool.. Are u still the one? Will u still be there? Will I still be able to watch u sleep?   Maybe its just me who is thinking alot.. Well, maybe..    &nbsp;  I miss you alot alot..   Dont tell me you're leaving me. I really dont wan to know that.&nbsp;I need you, baby. I really do need you.&nbsp;But if that's the way it is then so be it..

       Somehow this song was playing in my player, and i decided to put it on my blog. Anyhow, no special meaning to it.    &nbsp; This isn't goodbye, even as I watch you leave, this isn't goodbye I swear I won't cry, even as tears fill my eyes, I swear I won't cry  Any other girl, I'd let you walk away Any other girl, I'm sure I'd be ok  Tell me what makes a man Wanna give you all his heart Smile when you're around  And cry when you're apart If you know what makes a man Wanna love you the way&nbsp;I do Girl you gotta let me know So I can get over you  What makes her so right? Is it the sound of her laugh? That look in her eyes When do you decide? She is the dream that you seek That force in your life  When you apologise, no matter who was wrong When you get on your knees if that would bring her home  Other girls will come along, they always do But what's the point when all I ever want is you  Tell me what makes a man Wanna give you all his heart Smile when you're around And cry when you're apart If you know what makes a man Wanna love you the way I do Girl you gotta let me know..... (let me know) Girl you gotta let me know..... (wooo) So I can get over you

      Im bloggging at this hour. This is weird. Haha.. Anyway, I've been a good girl today by attending bloody hell boring English course. I swear, I can really sleep. Sch sux as usual. Lots of assignments needed to be handed in by tomorrow and I've done nothing. I dont care anymore. Im going to hand in only on Monday. Come teachers, chase after me. Mwahaha. Im insane. Totally.  Life has been goin pretty well lately. Filled less with ups and down. I suppose the ups and downs of life made life a little&nbsp;more interesting. I should thank god for them. I really should.  Been thinking alot lately, since when i dont. Ha. Realised a lot of things. But well, I'm pressing on. Wonder if its good or bad for you? -scatches head and starts to let my mind run wild-  Reminiscene of what narene said just now in her convo with *, made me think of lots of things. Do i hold a place in your heart? Do you know I need assurance? Do you know how much I care for you? But But but... Im not looking out for an answer.. Cuz like I've said a thousand times, You have all the time you want. I mean it. Cuz I luv you.  I'm having Social Studies Test tmr at 7.40am.  I should be sleeping now but Im not tired. This is absurd.  Then again, Im&nbsp;getting bored&nbsp;with blogs.

      I'm contented with the way things are right now. Im goin with the flow. Be it a dream, be it true. I'll be strong. I will be. I dont wanna press too hard, im afraid. So afraid.. Im so.. so afraid.  I dont wanna lose a thing. I dont wanna fall asleep thinking that you'll be there for me. Cuz, im so so afraid to lose you. Somewhere in my mind, there is a picture of you. Im thinking of you..  I want to be there for you, always and forever. Just lookin at you, makes me feel so fine.    My feelings are so strong, it pains my heart knowing how you feel. Simply cuz i love you.. My heart will go on.  Im falling so hard, falling so hard for you.  .. i love you. it aint no fling.  you cant lose wad you never had? true...? -shakes head-

      Yay. I just got discharged from the hospital. The short stay in the hospital was pretty much alright. Jabs doesnt hurt that much either. Nurses and doctors were really nice people, I spent most of my time there talking to them. I know all of them there. So fun to be joking around with them. Haha. Well, the food was delicious. But, I seriously have no appeitite to eat. Oh, not forgetting to mention. I learnt alot too. Bio knowledge. And guess what i told them? I told them to wait for me for 10years, I will be back as a doctor. The first thing I do is to drop by the ward and say hi. (((:  Not forgetting to mention everyone who showed care and concern for me. I really love you guys lots. Now, I do know who my true friends are. Thanks guys! ((: I shall not mention names here in case I forget some. ((: U guys know who you are.  I know I shouldn't be blogging bout this ----> but I really miss you alot. (I hate myself when I start to blog bout this, I really hate myself.)  I clearly know that I'm suppose to get over it and move on to the better or rather normal world of my own but I cant. I really don't know why. I'm so affected by you and everything about you. And even in the hospital, someone just had to remind me of you. I think of you every now and then. God, give me a sign. Tell me what to do? What exactly am i suppose to do? Tell me.. Sometimes I think to myself, can you dont be so nice. Can you be nasty and get attached to some ppl so I can jolly well kill myself. The other part of me, tells me that I dont wan all this to be happening cuz my heart will crashed. I want you to be like before. Give me back my 4 weeks, I want them back. I want you back. -though its highly impossible-  Im not as strong as you think I am. Well, that's just too bad. Right?  I'm gonna get a stern scolding from my friends who knows that Im still feeling this way but I cant help it. I really wished I could. Really wished I could just forget and move on. I have to. Give me some time. I will. I need to study hard for my O's. Its just around the corner. O's is what that leads to my future. I dont want to lose this chance. And Im not goin to let myself stay this way. I will change, I will study. I will do everything I'm suppose to do instead of ... I will.  I promise...    Special thanks to Leqi who was helping me all these while. Thanks alot for everything. I can't exactly tell you all this verbally. So I shall thank you here. Thanks sweetie! I know what Im suppose to do. I will ok. Really! (((:  To my "girlfriend", thanks for being there for me. You'll be my best bud alright. Thanks babe. U ought to move on too. Right? Let's move on together. Mwahahhaha.. Take care.

      Tell me.. Do I hold a place in your heart?  I need you; I want you. You're all that I ever need.  If you have feelings for me then please.. please.. Let me know. Please..  If you don't then, Dont lead me on to something unreal. Because.. I would really give my heart and soul; my entire world to you.  You do know that I still have feelings for you, dont you?

      Seriously speaking, I ought to be sleeping but no Im not. My terrible fever is 38.9 degrees. My throat is so infected that I have difficulties breathing. My flu is not any better. Im having cold like half the time. Im not joking.. I think Im dying soon. Mwahaha..  To all who hadn't watched   The Village  , PLEASE DO NOT WATCH! IT SUX BIG TIME! It's such a disappointment.  -paused for very long-  Thought of lots of things just now.. I miss you. I hate to see things that I dont want to see. I hate the way you stand beside me while I can't hold your hand. I hate the feeling whereby you are just there but you seem so far away. My head is spinning. Cant u care a little bit more about me?  I need you.  Just tell me you will be there. I'll be contented.. Do u know how much I care? Do you know how many times I wanted to pick up my phone and give u a ring, even just to say hi?  I have done so much. I did my best. I really did. I have done everything but you are not giving me a chance. This is all I'm asking for. Do i deserve this? Do i deserve this? Do I? Why am i always the one with all those shit? My heart aches every single min. I want you, I dont want anyone else. All I want is you. God, am I asking too much? Tell me.. Am I such a lousy person? I guess I'll never be good enough for you. Why is this happening to me? People say, give ur best; your heart and your soul, and success will come to you. I doubt the existence of success.  Guess you have your row of suitors waiting for you. I can never outwit them for the simplest reason that Im not a ... ...  I really don't know what have I done wrong? Will someone please enlighten me.. If this is not love, then tell me what is. Seriously, tell me..  Sometimes I think to myself, Im such a loser.  If one day I die.. Will you ever tell me I was being loved by you?  Why does Love hurt so bad? U hurt me. U broke my heart. U shatttered my dreams. You tore me apart.  As I walk towards you, And you towards me. I want to hug u tight, and things are gonna be so right. If only.. If only..  -God knows what am i typing in this entry? too emotional.. fuck myself. This isn't my nature. Im so not this type.  I wasn't like this, till I met you. Why? -  Give me some time to get over it.  Will i ever?
