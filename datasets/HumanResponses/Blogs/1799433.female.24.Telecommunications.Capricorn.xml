      does everyone have carrots visible in their outer ear?  and does it bother most people?  i myself and disgusted by the sight of other people's ear wax, and am therefore diligent w/ the q-tips.  i'm sure that sticking little pieces of cotton into one's ear is not the healthiest thing... but at least i don't cause nauseau in people sitting next to me on the subway!

      I left South Africa in July of 1998.  That was the last time I had seen many of my fellow exchange student.  Yesterday, I had a lovely visit from Allison and her family.  It felt like no time had past.  We quickly caught up on all of the exchange student gossip and caught each other up on our own lives.  While it felt very normal to be eating w/ Allison at Jack Astor's (where I often have lunch or a post work beer w/ collegues), it felt strange meeting her family.  As an exchange student, especially at such a young age, remembering and reflecting on the families that we've left across the globe becomes a part of our experience.  And the entire Rotary Exchange experience is a shared experience.  So, just as Allison is well aware of my family, I too knew all about her mother, brother and the later-to-be step-dad.  Finally meeting them in the flesh was such a step apart from my experience in South Africa; it put the characters Allison had described to me in the flesh.  While her family was not necessarily like I imagined them, they were lovely.  They had a natural sense of humour, and I gathered from my meal w/ them, that they frequently laughed together.  They all maintained a poise and a confidence that allowed them to melt into their new surroundings, to blend with it.  It became apparent the traits that I had always valued so much in Allison were spread throughout her family.  I wonder what part she gained from her mother, and what part she spread to the rest of her family.  I firmly believe that one who is exposed to a woman who carries herself in such a manner, cannot help but try to adopt the same mannerisms upon realizing the pleasantness of them.  Now, having seen Allison, as well as Nick and Kathryn since my return to Canada, I'm keen to catch up with other exchangees.  It is certainly true that the bond that is formed over an exchange year is infallible.  And certainly the bonds that were made in Johennesburg in 1997/98 were created under such intense conditions that we will forever be aware of the true characters of our peers, having seen the best and the worst of their beings.    The year was one I will never forget, but I am eager to maintain the journey and spend some time with some dear friends.

      So, what rock was I living under in highschool?  Supposedly, Lemon Gin was called "panty remover" by the students at Harrison Trimble High School in Moncton, New Brunswick.  Myself?  I had never even heard of lemon gin, let alone "panty remover"!  HA!  Perhaps this magic potion could have prevented years of prudishness -- damn Elmira District Secondary School and its Mennonite prudishness!  ;)  Anyway, this blog came about because of a conversation I had over MSN with Jenn this morning.  I was reading the current issue of Maclean's on my way to work this morning (as I often do on my 1/2 hour subway ride).  This issue has an article titled "Can Science Give You a Better Sex Life?" and I knew that this was an article for Jenn.  So after our usual morning banter, I sent her the link to the online article.  I believe Jenn herself is now blogging this article (which is about Female Sexual Dysfunction), and I'm feeling more connected to one of my dear friends.  "Where does lemon gin fit in?" you ask.  The article claims that after rates were injected w/ "a synthetic hormone called PT-141, female rodents [became] overcome with lust - hopping, darting to and fro, and sending all sorts of come-hither vibes to their male companions."  This, Jenn claimed, sounded like the rats had been given a dose of lemon gin.  I think I will stop at the liquor store tonight...  http://www.macleans.ca/topstories/life/article.jsp?content=20040719_84492_84492
