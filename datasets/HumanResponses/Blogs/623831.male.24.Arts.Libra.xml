						       A NEW KEYBOARD BY ROLAND IS COMING OUT BY MARCH!!!  OH BOY!  This one is going to cost around $3,200 to $3,400.  The 61-key is supposed to be around $2,400.  I'll probably try and get the 61-key.  If the price on the Motif ES6 drops though...  I dunno.  I'll have to wait and see.  The Fantom is dope though.  Without a doubt in my mind.  Using that with Reason and Pro Tools.  Forget about it.  I've also started to study this program called MaxMSP.  It basically is a visual object-based programmer that utilizes C to create audio programs or "patches".  It's some p.h.D type of shit.  A lot of people that fuck with it are the major brainy types that have phD's in electronic music or are seriously deep into the music to the point where they need to go beyond the limits of what electronic music has to offer through what's available with hardware and software in stores.  You know the saying, if you want something done right, do that shit yourself.  MaxMSP lets you make everything yourself.  It's not easy to learn.  I would say the difficulty level is up there.  It's programming in C.  But, what makes it more difficult is that you have to be able to grasp the idea of waveforms.  Which is fundamentally simple to understand.  But, to control sound with a machine is something I find amazing.  To be able to manipulate something that exists so dynamically in nature is off the wall.  I want to design some really cool shit, not just to save me time while I'm recording and doing mixes with Pro Tools, but to also slap MaxMSP on my resume someday when I'm shopping for that jobby job.  Once I learn MaxMSP, I'll probably get a tattoo that says "can't be fucked with" across my chest.  I got my letters of recommendation for that scholarship.  I have to work on writing my essay now.  Hmm..  should I make the reader cry or laugh or just leave them absolute awe?  All of the above.  That's what I'm good at.  Might as well use what I've been blessed with.

						   I'm adjusted back into the school life.  Thursday is really a kick in my ass.  I wake up at 6AM and I don't finish school until about 9:30PM.  I'm fortunate to have made a friend in my morning music theory class.  Some really smart chick that's been playing the piano since she was 4 years old.  God damn.  4 years old?  When I was 4, I was still peeing in my pants.  My biggest concern was Voltron when I was 4.  I still remember Voltron actually.  It's hard to say which one was better.  Lion Voltron or Car Voltron.  I think I liked both equally the same.  They both kicked ass.  Car Voltron had like 20 pieces if my memory is correct and it built three separate entities which were vehicles and all of them could be combined to form Voltron.  Now that was sickness and they don't make toys like they used to.  Anyway, music theory and keyboarding is pretty nice.  It's work and requires diligence as well as discipline and patience, but I'm going to stick with it all the way.  I hope that I get some scholarship money so that I can purchase a keyboard.  I am considering this other keyboard called the Motif by Yamaha which has 175MB of sounds onboard.      $1999.00  Now that's around almost a grand cheaper than the Korg Triton.  A little more than the Fantom (pictured below), but I think it might be the better investment.  It has a sampler as well.  I think the wise choice would be to hold off on the keyboard for now.  I'll wait another year until I finish theory III and keyboarding III.  By then a new keyboard will be out.  And, I am really digging my beats I'm making from sampling vinyl records.  Oh man.  That reminds me.  I met the baddest baddest chick in my class.  I had a class with this girl during the summer.  OH BOY.  She's got a tattoo on her lower back.  And damn, she ain't just hot.  She's actually got intelligence.  Real real intelligence.  Damn.  I love school.  That's all I can say.  Shit, I gotta find out if she has a boyfriend.  Cause I have a bad habit of not asking.  But, I actually made the decision not to ask and ask next week or the week after.  I already broke the ice, so the hard part is out of the way.  YEea..  good thing I hollered at her the first day of class.  I didn't wait two months like what happened with that girl from last semester.  I waited like two months to talk to that girl.  Because I was worried.  But, then I realized I have nothing to be afraid of.  There's more glory in trying to get to know a girl and getting rejected than not even trying at all.  I'm glad though because I once thought girls like that one in my class would never even speak to me.  I'd just look at them and be like, Damn she's outta my league.  But, I guess since I've freed myself from the insanity and I'm happy, that's what it's all about.  I'm still happy regardless, but I was just trippin off that.  My life always trips me out.  There's always something surprising the shit outta me.  Beautiful stuff.

						   Do you know where your sanity is?  How in the Hell did I stay up so late?  or so early?  I've been working on beats.  You see, if I try to go to sleep, I'll start hearing music so I can't fall asleep.  And then I work on music.  And before I know it, it's 4:48 AM, I've written a thousand word essay in my blogger, I feel like I'm stuck in a world between the Matrix and a 1980's after-school special, and I still can't sleep.  So I write another entry in my Blogger to describe the way that I feel, hoping to alleviate the sleeplessness.  I drank Starbucks earlier tonight at around 6PM.  Almost twelve hours ago.  It was a Venti.  Is that why I can't sleep?  They ran out of Chocolate Baby Bundt Cakes.  That was a dissappointment.  I love baby bundt cakes.  I was going to eat one because I haven't ate any sugar for over a month, so I figured that I could have me a Chocolate Baby Bundt Cake.  But, the Starbucks I went to didn't have any at all.  Not even any cheesecake.  What is wrong with the world today?  You have people dying all over the world from starvation and I just wanted bundt cake.  It's cool.  I wasn't angry.  Just thought that it was ironic.  I shouldn't have desired that bundt cake.  It was a sign maybe for me to humble myself and stay focused on my will.  Or maybe it wasn't a sign.  Maybe all of the suburban retards that excessively consume Starbucks got there before I did and bum rushed the bundt cakes.  They're good stuff.  I don't blame them.  That's probably what it was.  My mission for next weekend is to get me a Chocolate Baby Bundt Cake.  This post is to be continued ....

						   I'm a jackass.  Haha.  I accidentally deleted my blog.  Well, it's back to the old address that it was at.  I think this is like the fourth or fifth time that my blog has been reset.  Damn.  Well, when I do decide to write an autobiography, I guess I'll have to resort to something else like a photo album to recall the highlights of my life versus digging through the Blogger archives.  Oh well.  There's not much new news happening.  I'm collaborating with a new friend of mine.  He goes by Clown Puncher.  We are going to make a DnB track.  I'll be spittin some flows over some shit that's 180 bpms.  It's going to turn out fresh because we're going to record live drums and instruments and bass and all that shit so that this track turns out the way that real music should be with talented people actually playing real instruments rather than a couple geeks clicking mice behind computer screens.  Don't get me wrong, that's still going to be the fundamental force driving this production, but we'll have some musicians acting as our puppets to manifest our musical compositions we'll create with clicking mice.  With our engineering and production skills put together, the finished product should be quite interesting.  I think he might push to get the record signed.  But, I'm not sure.    I think that the way techno music works is complete different than how the pop music industry operates.  It's a totally different beast.  But, nevertheless, I'm just trying to have fun doing what I love doing.  That's all that matters right now.  Hopefully, I'll have some webspace and a domain name by the time it's finished.  I should spend the next $50 I have on that rather than blow it on a pair of sneakers or a t-shirt like I always do.  Webspace or Nikes.  Hmm..  tough decision.  Nikes would benefit me more in the long run since my feet would be comfortable.  Webspace would cause me stress since I hate administrating webspace and putting forth the effort to post my songs online.  It's a lot of work believe it or not.  But, I'll probably do it just for the love of doing it for people that always ask me, "do you have a website?"  I don't feel lame when I say no because truthfully, I know that I'm probably geekier than most webpage designers.  That's actually a cool job to have compared to what I'll probably do for a living.  Well, the job I'll have is going to be cool to me, but it's going to require major geek skills to do.  Anyway, I've figured out a way to record sounds off of my friend's Korg Triton so that I don't have to spend $3,000 on that keyboard.  It's pretty cool because I have recorded all of the bass sounds that I like.  I was thinking about buying a keyboard, recording all of the sounds off of it that I'd like to keep, and then returning it afterwards.  I mentioned the idea to my mom and she said that it's not a good thing to do.  But, when I mentioned that I would do it with some scholarship money if I get it, she didn't object.  So, I hope I get some scholarship money so that I can buy a keyboard that I can return.  Does that make sense?  It sort of does.  Why spend $2,000 on a piece of hardware, when all of the sounds on it are just going to be recorded onto a computer anyway?  For me, it makes more sense to record every single sound off of it, keep it on a harddrive, then return the keyboard, and keep the sounds.  That's not against the law in any way whatsoever.  I wouldn't be breaking any laws and that's the beauty of it.  I'd just be saving a shitload of money.  Don't get me wrong, it would take a long time to archive all those sounds.  I'd say that it'd take a good 30 days.  That's how long I'd have 'till the Money Back Guarantee is up.  Hahaha.  Well, I guess being a diabolical madman has it's benefits after all.

						   I might be performing something in a couple of weeks.  I don't know which songs I'll prepare for the show, but I'll see.  I think I'll perform my theme song, my new song that's untitled, hmm..  black out, and one more I should prepare.  It's going to be a 21 and over crowd.  I'm going to burn about 10 demos and sell them for $5 each after I perform.  This is gonna be fun.  I am gonna enjoy fuckin with people's minds.  Well, we'll see how it pimps.

						   The other night I took some Tylenol PMs.  Big fuckin mistake.  I woke up feeling so god damn shitty.  I got to school late and after I arrived, I realized that I left all of my books at home.  Is that retarded of me or what?  So rather than get pissed off and tell myself that I'm retarded.  I said, I'm not going to fuck with those god damn Tylenol PMs anymore no matter how bad my insomnia is keeping me up at night.  I think what I'll start doing is going to the gym during the early morning time versus going at night.  Yeah, I should get in the habit of doing that because then I'll have my shit together.  New news.  I'm going to work on a drum n bass collaboration with a couple friends from school.  We're going to put in an effort all together to make a CD and sell it to try to raise up some funds so that we can not only experience what it takes to make it in the music business, but also to try and get something to build on.  I was planning on doing it on my own and just having a hip hop CD.  But, to be able to work with three other engineers and also have two other business partners sounds like a lot more of a better plan.  It's also an innovative type of sound we're going to create.  I wasn't planning on being a mainstream pop artist, so this is definitely some shit that I am looking forward to running with.  I think my dream of performing around the world might just come true.  The first track is titled, "running out of time".  I wrote a verse for it.  It's about my paranoid delusions and experiences of abusing drugs.  I like it.  I think I am allergic to drugs now.  I am becoming like mature or something.  It's weird.  No.  I'm still a big ass kid.  But, I'm just not as retarded and goofy.

						   It's 12:55am.  I can't sleep.  There's too much stuff on my mind.  I need to smoke a fat ass joint, that's what I really need to do.  Self-medicate the insomnia.  Now that I got that off my chest, I think I feel a lot better.  I'm gonna go sleep or at least try to.

						   I can't say that I'm a complete genius.  Geez.  I hate to say it.  But, I need a faster laptop.  I know that the one I have right is one that I got for free.  It's just not cutting it for me though.  The work that I'm doing requires more power and this laptop isn't giving me what I need.  I did install a latency patch which I need to test out once I get this new hard drive in this week.  I'll see how it records with Pro Tools now.  Maaaaaan...  I pray for this scholarship.  If I can get like $1,000 then I'll have a faster laptop and I can stop crying to my blogger.

						   I'm going to be doing my first performance.  I'm not really nervous.  I've been waiting for this day.  I feel as though my dreams are finally coming true.  As a broke ass muthafucka, it's time to start hustling this music and making some money off of it.  I've been doing a lot of praying.  Praising God and thanking God (Him or Her) for blessing me with the gift to fuck with people's minds and make them laugh or think about life from my eccentric perspective through my music.  I'm thankful for being blessed with the right chromosomes mixed in with the chemical substamces from my earlier years which have formulated a concoction which has made me the bastard which I am today.  That's as honest as I can put it.  I'm recording my music again.  I have less than two weeks to prepare my shit, but I'm sure that I'll be able to do it.  I am going to burn about 5 songs onto a CD, press about 30-40 copies on my own effort and then sell each one for $5.  This is going to be the beginning of my dream.  I pray that God will guide me through and give me the patience and strength to be able to live off of making music.  I'm not in it for the money.  I'm in it for the art.  But without getting paid, the art will die.  I am making the right move though and working towards being more professional as each day passes.  I already know how to talk the industry talk.  I know how to deal with the streets as well.  It's just a matter of patience, I think.  I've sacraficed so much up to this point.  Money, girls, friends, going out, smoking, drinking, drugging, etc.  That's why I'm not making music solely for the money.  The sacrafices I've made equates to my soul.  All of those things which I once desired and used to try to fill up the emptiness inside of me has been all directed towards my music.  The only thing I desire now is to touch the lives of people that take time out to listen to what I've made.  And that's the desire that really motivates me.  To be within that moment when I'm making music and I see the people around me become effected within that very moment.  It's something that can't really be put into words.  It can only be experienced through my eyes I think.  It's the feeling of being understood.  That's the best way to explain it.  Not everyone understands, but when someone understands it's an amazing feeling.  It's being loved for doing what I love to do and that's the feeling.  To put it as simply as I can.  And I'm happy these days because of that.  I might not have all the friends in the world.  I might not have a lot of money.  I've got a shitload of discipline though.  No drugs.  Low carbs.  No anxiety.  No stress.  No worrying.  I frequently find myself wishing that I could capture my life right now and keep it this way forever.  I wish that I could be safe from the pain like I am now forever because I fear living in pain like I've lived in the past.  I have to remind myself that if I could make it through what I've experienced then I could do a lot more.  I forget how close I've faced death and mortal damnation.  It doesn't feel like I have.  I forgot about what I've been through.  I don't care about it anymore.  I laugh at all that crap now actually.  I'm not scared to talk about anything that used to bother me.  It's irrelevant.  I'm twenty four years old and I feel like I'm as young as a twelve year old.  I thank God for that.  For answering my prayers when I asked for help.  I was powerless and I asked for strength and patience and now I'm where I asked to be.  I won't turn my back on God from now on.  In the past, I've turned my back on God after I've gotten back on my feet and then I'd fall down on the ground again.  This time, I know the mistake I made in the past.  Giving into all of that empty rhetorical scientific ideological stuff about how the spirit of God and human beings is all hocus pocus.  The system's attempt to break down the soul into pieces.  Look all around you.  If you can't see it then you're blind.  If you can't feel it then you don't have a heart.  If you can read these words, then you can feel my pain.  The misery which you see others suffer within this world is the price for someone else's liberty.  It's a cold world.  That's why I make music though.  It's a good distraction.

						   I feel like I'm being pulled all over the place.  Something my mom told me.  You can't change the world, but you can change yourself.  Such a simple phrase, yet very meaningful.  I want to be able to leave my mark, although the humble thing to do would be to live a quiet existence and pass through unheard.  That's not me though.  I can't do that.

						   Today, I discovered where all the pretty women hide to escape from the world.  I know where they go so that they don't have to deal with guys harassing them and trying to get down their panties.  OH YES.  I know the secret, bitches!  You can't hide from me.  You really thought that you could take your pretty asses and just go somewhere without me finding out?  You silly rabbits, tricks are for kids.  I'm a full grown man, biatch.  Anyway, if you wanna know where the hoes is at.  Yoga class!  I shit you not.  There's so many fine chicks in the yoga class at my 24 hour fitness.  I'm gonna hit that shit up every week and play the role.  :D  Hahahaha.  I never thought that God could fit so many firm breasts and buttocks into one room!  Now, I may not have the guts to pick up on any of those chicks.  But, I do have the guts to sneak a peep at some boobies when they're not looking.  You know I'm just kidding.  I really wasn't staring at boobies.  I was actually into the whole yoga thing.  It was pretty relaxing.  And I didn't feel like a homosexual afterwards even though I was afraid that I might.  But, when it was over, I thought, yes, I still would much rather prefer a pussy over a poopie shute and nice firm titties will beat a man's hairy chest any fuckin day.  but, I'm just speaking for myself.  There are guys out there that would prefer the latter.  Lord have mercy on your poopie shute.

						   I pray...  I need a loan.  If I get this money, I'm going to be so happy.  I already know what I'm gonna get.  3 ghz laptop with one gig of ram.  Mackie HR824 monitor speakers.  I'll have a top quality studio that will last me for the next four years.  If I have this equipment, I'll actually be able to charge people for my services, but screw that.  It's all about sticking with the craft and developing skills to make something out of nothing versus investing time into someone else who isn't going to make shit out of the time you put into them.  You might make a couple hundred here and there for mixing a song, but that's wack compared to what I can make when I sell my own music and start a label.  So, I have to get this loan.  From there I can be my fake self.  Shake hands with white people.  Smile at them.  Crack jokes about stuff on the news.

						   I haven't had the chance to log anything this whole week.  I am completely exhausted.  I've been working so hard to record songs and making music that I need a day to rest.  Today's that day.  Tomorrow I'm going back at it.  I'm going to see a concert tomorrow night.  Some avante garde type shit that's way above my head.  But, if I'm secure enough with my manhood to go to a yoga class, then I'm comfortable with myself going to a concert to watch some modern-day composing take place.  I've been starving this whole week.  I haven't been eating as much as I'd like since I have been away from home and broke.  My friends I hang out with are also students without jobs so I can't bumb anything off of them.  Fuck it.  Life's a struggle.  If you're not struggling to learn and eat, then you are struggling just to be happy.  I'm happy, so I can honestly say fuck it.  I have my big bag of chips and bowl of guacamole and salsa.  Cable Internet.  Television.  Stereophonic headphones.  My beats.  What else do I need?  Some pussy would be nice.  But, God doesn't think I'm ready to take on the responsibility yet.  God is right.  Like always.

						   I was able to record about 3 songs tonight.  They came out so good.  I was able to record them on this really really really good microphone.  This microphone that I used is so good.  I would say it's got the sound of a $3,000-4,000 microphone.  And that's just from using it without a good amplifier.  We're going to have a better amplifier that's custom-built in about a month or so.  Then, I'll be laying my vocals down on some serious stuff and it'll sound so professional.  I've been thinking about my friend Alex lately who originally introduced me to this music game.  I wanted to be able to work with him like I'm working with the people I'm working with right now.  But, since our schedule's clash and I'm also gearing towards something different than he is, I have no choice but to break away to a different path.  I'll work with him in the future for sure though.  I just honestly wish that I could be partners with him on this whole music business thing.  But, as a friend, I can't ask him to put in as much time as I do.  And there's a lot of work required to get stuff done with music.  I spent about nine hours a day for the past three days just working on music.  If that much dedication isn't put into music, then it can't be taken to the professional level.  That's just how it is.  I see a lot of kids at school and they have a lot of ambition.  The ambition is there.  But, the thing that's missing is the work ethic.  They're learning about the industry and how to do business.  But, in the whole process of doing that, they forget to make the music itself and they're only left with a scattered bits and pieces.  My whole focus right now is to screw thinking about the business from this point until I have a CD.  Since I have two other people that I'm working with that are also industry savvy, it takes a big burden off of me because I only have to think about business when it's time to make the actual decisions of what to do.  The same applies for them, too.  But, I made it clear that we should mainly focus on making as much quality music as possible and that's my biggest concern.  The other two are more concerned with the business side because they are more worried about how that will turn out.  I am more concerned with how good the music will sound.  But, I've been working a couple of weeks with these guys and so far, everything's going so smooth and since I'm working within the means of good communication amoungst the band members, the sharing of ideas and criticism is always there.  Communication is always the most crucial element when maintaining any type of personal structure.  Without it, there's just a lot more confusion and inefficiency.  I'm going to press up hip hop CDs of my solo cuts and then with those CDs, I'm going to get the help of my associates and we'll all promote and sell that CD to bring our label's funds up to where we can release our collaboration CD that's going to be marketed towards our targeted audience.  I have two other people to help engineer my sound and produce quality beats.  The equipment is top quality so that's another thing, too.  Right now, I'm managing recording my music by lugging around my desktop tower.  I can wait for the laptop.  In due time, I'll have it once I get approved for that student loan.  I'll also have some monitor speakers.  I just pray that I qualify to get that student loan because I desperately need it so that I can make that investment towards that equipment.  It's going to work out.  After the work that I laid down the past 3 days, it really dawned upon me.  I see my potential starting to break through.

						   the experience was good.  Constructive.  But the performance didn't turn out as well as I had anticipated.  The microphone that I picked up was shitty and i was wearing earplugs to keep my hearing from sufferring, so I couldn't hear my own vocals.  The vocals I was rapping could barely be heard by anyone even though I was screaming from the top of my lungs.  Hahaha.  That's pretty stupid, but oh well.  I even got a boo.  I heard someone saying boo and I replied with a fuck you, then proceeded to rap.  I didn't catch who said it, but I think they were just joking around since I'm the new kid.  Oh well.  That wasn't a big deal.  Overall, I wasn't nervous.  I tried to sell some CDs and that was my main goal.  Just to get out there and work at it and see how I could improve in the future.  Success takes work and I'm just honing the craft right now to ensure my success.  Since I'm abandoning hip hop for the drum n bass hip hop hybrid music with my band, I am looking more forward to that because I'm going to be able to take my music towards the rave scene and that's where I want to go.  The club last night was more of what hip hop music in clubs is like.  Rap that's about pimping and shooting people.  I want to take my music towards a different direction and try to reach a more broader crowd.  I'm thinking more business-minded in terms of music, so I could be labeled a "sell-out", but I honestly don't care if I am or not.  If I could make a living off of doing what I love and if I'm making music that I love making, I don't think that's considered selling out.  There's really no such thing as selling out in my views.  There's success and failure.  Everyone has a choice of what they want to say and who they want to say it to.  In our capitalistic country, it's a competition to survive out here.  You can call it the concrete jungle or the game or whatever you want.  It's just the way it is.  Anyway, the experience of performing was cool.  I just didn't like how there was no guestlist for the artists and the owner of the club was making a shitload of money off of the performers buying drinks and the guests of the performers buying drinks.  The door fee from all the people that just came to see me only probably came out to about $50 and plus all the drinks that they bought came out to even more since a few alcoholic friends came through.  So, I caught on to the owner's little scheme and I wasn't feeling that.  I thought that was really lame and I'm not going back to that club again.  I have some other shit lined up with my band though.  We're networked with different people and once we have a CD pressed, we have shows lined up at some really popular clubs that are known.  When that jumps off, that's when I'm really going to call everyone I know to come out to support me.  I didn't even call anyone to come out to this one because I expected it to be something that was going to be somewhat sheisty.  That's not my friend Alex's fault.  I'm just skeptical enough to see what that broke ass club owner with his cheesy polyester suit was trying to do.  Fake ass Christopher Walkin lookin ass muthafucka.  Hahaha.  Bitch!  I had this feeling since there was no guestlist for artists and everyone coming to see me had to pay to see me, that the club was going to be small and it was a setup for the guests to drink and all that shit.  OH well.  I'm glad that the people who did come out to support me did come out.  It's all good.  In the future, I'm going to be rocking much better venues and I know that it's going to be some amazing shit because the band I'm going to gig with is going to be doing it majorly live.  Shit, we even have a live drummer that's stupid fuckin dope.  Now, I don't know many groups that have sick ass drummers to perform electronic music with, but nobody in the bay is going to rock it like we're about to rock it.  That's fo sho.  Next Sunday is going to be our first garage practice.  I'm really juiced up and looking forwards to that.

						   The weather has been nice and shiny for the past month.  And I was feeling good about being me.  Inside of my little cosmic bubble, there was nothing but music playing and the pleasant feeling of my brain's neurotransmitters releasing serotonin into my brain.  But, the sky became dark this morning.  And as the day progressed, the cloud's grew more grey and dull.  Then it started to rain.  And it became very cold.  And I realized, it's Valentine's Day.  No wonder.  There always has to be that one day for us single folks to be reminded of what it's like to be lonely.  And that day is Valentine's Day.  But, I shall have the last laugh like always.  No rain is going to rain on my parade.  That's right.  At least I'm not influenced by the consumerism that's plaguing men across the world right now.  The calamity of having to spend money on a female just because the television is telling you, "Hey, you best go buy her something if you love her.  Or you better do it, otherwise you ain't gettin any pussy."  Why couldn't the world just be more honest?  If we really truly loved one another, we wouldn't need days to superficially express our affection with material gifts.  Because true love cannot perish and no box of chocolates can replace that.  Ok, maybe I'm just resorting to a defense mechanism since I'm alone on Valentine's Day and I'll be spanking my money rather than getting some.  But, I do have a point.  Nah, actually I don't.  Being alone on a rainy night is just down right fuckin shitty.  Somebody give me a blowjob.

						   You know what makes me depressed?  I want to open up to you and get this off of my chest.  This bothers me a lot and it's been causing me some discomfort.  I'm 24 years old.  I don't feel like I'm 24 and I don't think that I act my age.  The thing is, I want to be a grown up.  But, now I look at grown ups and I realize that.  I am still a kid.  I also have been thinking about the past which is useless.  But, I have been thinking about all of the years I've lost being dumb and foolsih.  It's not good to do that, but I've been doing it.  The past is the past and fuck the past.  I need to rest.

						   I'm going to get out and party.  It's time to relax because I've been working way too damn much and it's starting to fuck with me.  Yeeea.  I'm going to get out, meet some chicks, get rejected like I usually do, but fuck it.  It's all for the thrill of getting rejected and at least I try.  One of the times that I try, I'm bound to score.  That's just the way it is.  It's just a little harder when you are intelligent and considerate.  Bitches don't know how to react to that sort of shit from a muthafucka now a days.  That was a joke by the way.

						   How hard is it to get six pack abs?  I've been trying for almost six months now.  You can say I'm a victim of the ideology that men aren't attractive men unless they have six pack abs.  It's all those damn Calvin Klein, Abercrombie & Fitch, Cool Water cologne, and Ralph Lauren advertisements.  They've made me become a slave to the false hope that looking like one of those pretty boys will make me someone special.  That's not the case though.  The only thing that being in better shape has done for me is that it has made me more shallow.  The closer I get to having my sixpack abs, the more I am becoming narcassistic and self-absorbed.  So, why not go back to eating McDonalds and Burger King everyday?  It would save me a lot of money versus buying healthy foods to eat.  The case maybe that I miss the old lazy, suicidal, overweight, bipolar self.  I've heard of this happening to people.  They change their lives around and at one point, they miss the person that they once were.  Strangly enough, I think has happened to me.  The trippy part is, would it have happened if I hadn't heard of the idea of people missing their old selves?  Now, this isn't me being narcasstic.  This is me analyzing my own character to make space for more improvement.  I don't need Dr. Phil to tell me what's wrong with me.  And Oprah can suck my hundred dollar dick with her billion dollar mouth.  What I really miss is not having control.  Being out of control.  I used to love it and I miss it.  But I don't miss it enough to go back to being out of control.  I'm just rambling and releasing my thoughts before they turn into actions I'll regret.

						   I can't pinpoint what's wrong.  I can just feel it.  I think it's because I'm going through some changes.  Learning all of this new stuff in school.  Making new friends.  Living in a different environment.  I think it might be because growing up is a painful process.  The change involves pain and struggle.  It's like the inner battle of overcoming one's self to achieve change.  I don't fear change, but I feel afraid for some reason.  I'm a little bit uncertain about the future right now.  It's probably because I'm stepping into a new phase of my life.  There's frustration underneath the surface.  I've been thinking about some friends that I made from school.  I offered them my help, but after getting to know these cats a little better, I'm skeptical now.  They're difficult to work with and aren't up to my par with their communicational skills.  This isn't my band.  My band and I work damn near flawlessly together.  I'm referring to some other friends I made that I offered help on some music projects.  I felt a little bit bad because they're not as fortunate as I am to own a car and a computer and whatnot.  But, I can't find it in my heart to sympathize with them just because they're less fortunate because there's been times in my life when I was less fortunate than they were at the level that they're at.  I feel frustration because I tried my best to tell them to quit bullshitting with their lives and get something done.  There's no point in helping someone that's not willing to help themselves.  I will give someone a boost, but I won't carry anyone on my back.  I only offered a boost, not a piggy back ride to someone else's destination.  It's a fuckin pity.  Oh well.  I have no problem telling them that I back out on helping them.  I'll be honest and tell them the same exact thing I wrote down in this blogger because I couldn't live a happy life if I lied and came up with some lame ass cop out excuse on why I don't want to have anything to do with them on a business level.  I realize that my time is very valuable and I've gained some wisdom.  I'm not going to be so eager to offer anybody my help from now on.  I'm still open to help out someone that's less fortunate, but only if they're hard working.  These guys cut school to smoke weed and their business plan is all out of focus.  They're planning on spending money on a website before spending money on their product.  To me, that's a bad move.  The point of having a website is to sell a product.  You can't have a website without a product in hand to sell.  How stupid is that?  It's too bad.  They're nice folks, but hey, I have a lot of business to handle.  I gotta put them on the back burner and hope that they work it out on their own.  The ironic part is that I'd probably help them out if they weren't so stoned and lazy.

						   They're doing a live performance at the Warfield this Thursday and guess who's going?  Damn, you guess it.  I saw them spin a DJ set at Metropolis some time back, but I didn't get to see them perform which is what TCM is all about.  Yes, I can call them by that acronym.  I own all of their CDs so I am a true fan of their music.  I don't know the guys by name, but I do own a CD which is autographed by both of them.  My sister got it from her boyfriend when he used to work at Virgin Records out in downtown SF.  The Crystal Muthafuckin Method.  I am pretty fuckin excited to go watch them perform.  They're my role model as an electronic musician.  A show brought to you by Clear Channel.  That's as big as you can get.  If I was an artist doing Clear Channel shows, I don't know.  That's like light years away from me right now, but you never know.  The Crystal Method are probably in their mid-30s.  Since there's so much shit to know when it comes to being an electronic musician, it's rare to see a young artist come out.  It takes years of dedication.  I respect the Crystal Method though.  They're up there on my list with the Chemical Brothers and the Gorillaz.

						   If you make music, then you are a musician.  There was something bugging me.  I thought, I'm not a musician.  All I do is play around with computer programs and there's really nothing to it.  So, I asked my music theory teacher, Hey Steed (that's what he told me to call him rather than Sir), do you think computer musicians are musicians?  How do you feel about computer musicians?  He told me that his best friend is one of the greatest computer music composers in the world and that I am in a good place since I am at the edge of the future.  That's pretty heavy.  I don't want to be at the edge of the future.  I want to go back in time.  I think that's why I was questioning my integrity as a musician.  The desire to want to preserve something.  I have no culture to call my own.  I'm not Korean.  I'm not a mainstream American.  So, I have this desire to want to pass something down to the future.  But, all I can pass down is this electronic funk to make muthafuckas twitch while they're high or drunk or feeling down in the dumps.  Well, as corny and simple minded as it may sound.  It's like how the heart pumps blood throughout the body to sustain life.  The beat inside of my soul keeps my spirit alive and happy.  I'm trying to get it all out.  All the pain that's inside of my mind, body, and soul.  I'm releasing it all into the music.  The focus and the discipline I put into the music.  It makes it all dissappear.  That's why I'm a musician.  The inspiration is all from within.  Hopefully it'll be within my bank account soon too.  Hahaha.

						   I'm going to quit talking about myself.  Instead I'll make a note of my observations of what I see around me.  While I was driving home from school today, I looked up at the sky and I noticed a lot of smog and I thought to myself, "Wow, that's a shitload of fuckin smog."  It was humid and sticky.  I felt like I was in LA or something.  LA weather fuckin sucks when it's smoggy.  Is that selfish to say?  Anyway, where does all the smog go?  It doesn't just dissappear and go into outer space from the hole in our Earth's ozone layer.  That would be nice if it did.  I had this weird ass dream about a week ago.  I dreamt that I was trying to shut off this weather control unit from freezing the earth from eternity.  It was a really trippy ass dream.  The weather was like really nice like how it is right now.  It's damn near midnight, but I have my window wide open so that I can feel this cool breeze come into my room.  It smells like the way my neighborhood smelled where I was growing up in Queens.  Pretty awesome.  I guess that's to make up for the shittier weather today with all the smog and stuff.

						   I had to eat.  Fasting is pretty hard to do.  Especially with an appetite like mine.  I did only smoke 3 cigarettes though.  That was unselfish of me.  I'm going to do one unselfish thing everyday.  Hopefully it'll all add up and I'll go to heaven when I die.  Maybe trying to be unselfish is self righteous within itself and God will say, You should've just been selfish.  ??  I don't know.

						   It's the crack of dawn.  I am going to fast & pray today.  No I'm not crazy.  I decided to quit smoking cigarettes because smoking cigarettes is a selfish thing to do.  I am going to fast & pray to become less selfish.  I've prayed the Alcoholics Anonymous prayer:  God, please grant me the power to change the things that I can, the serenity to accept the things which I cannot change, and the wisdom to know the difference.  I'm trying to be less selfish, that's what I'll change.  For good of course.  Reprogramming myself in a sense.

						   I am conscious of what I have to do to be less selfish.  So here goes nothing.  What do you fear?  Do you fear being helpless?  Do you fear being fearful?  Don't be afraid.  It's only life.  Laugh.  Take some drugs.  Do it.  You know you want to.  Be responsible.  If you're trying your best and you know you are, you don't have to feel guilty.  Try a random act of kindness at work today.  Go up to your co-worker that you "thought" was a dick and tell them, "Hey, you know you look really nice today.  I'm not drunk on the job or anything, I just wanted you to know that."  HEY, YOU LOOK REALLY NICE TODAY!  (even though I can't see you)  Random acts of kindness.  They're your friend.  I'm being sarcastically this way.  This isn't good.  Hmm... I can't go back to selfish Doug.  DOCTOR, I NEED SOME STRONGER MEDS PLEEEASE!!!!  :(  Now I'm depressed all thanks to my sister.  She randomly told me out of no where that I'm selfish.  I don't know why.  I was just telling her about how I got approved on some financial aid at school and she told me that it's not all about me.  :(  She hurt me.  Oh well.  That's what big sister's are for I guess.

						   I'm going to try to be less selfish.  I am aware of the fact that I'm narcassistic and this is the reason why I hear voices inside of my head and also probably why I can't get laid.  I have to abuse my blogger.  Sorry.  I have a lot of fears and resentments within myself.  I need to search and see what it is and let it go.  Hmm..  It's good to make a list of these things and then burn up the piece of paper that the list is on.  This symbolizes that the fears and resentments go up in flames, but I think it also has some results beneath the surface as well.  I just know that I've been really wrapped up and all I've been thinking about is myself.  My future.  My health.  My happiness.  All I talk about is myself and I could be reporting the news or posting pictures for other people on this blog, but I don't.  Why?  I'll stop doing that starting today.

						   Finally!  I'm going to be able to get away from it all and leave it all behind me for a week.  Where is Doug journeying off to?  You should be jealous already!  I'm visiting the motherland.  No, not Korea, you dummy.  New York City.  That's my motherland.  I don't know any other places.  I know New York, the Bay Area, a little tiny bit of LA, and that's about it.  I have been to Canada and that's the closest I've gotten to leaving the American continent.  You might think that I'm lacking something culturally, but I really don't give a fuck.  Why would I want to go to another country that's trying to assimilate themselves to be more American, when I'm already as American as a muthafuckin American could be American?  I'm so fuckin god damn American.  Everything about me is American.  My music, my diet, my shampoo, my religious beliefs, and even my farts have an American smell to them.  This is totally off topic, but I'm going to tell you something that really made me almost die laughing when I saw it.  Even though my blogger is public, please respect my personal privacy and don't forward this to everyone that you know because I feel a little uncomfortable writing about this to you all.  I signed up for yahoo personals over a year ago when I wanted to get some pussy without putting forth the effort to really try to get laid.  I figured, "man, i'll holla at a few bitches and hit up their emailbox and spit a little bit of gizzle and then I can jizm inside their pizzle.."  you get the idea.  after i signed up for yahoo, i also signed up to match.com which was also giving away a free trial membership at the time to promote their sites.  I gave up online dating after about two hours.  I sent out about ten messages to then different chicks and after the tenth one, I realized that I would have a better chance getting pussy if I sent out this many resumes on dice.com since I didn't have a job at the time.  Shit, ten emails to ten different females?  That's too much effort put into trying to get laid.  anyway, even though i gave up online dating, i've still been getting these spam emails.  now, these spam emails are pretty fun to look at.  i would never probably actually send these girls a message, but i like to view their sites and see the funny things that they say.  "this is the first time i've ever done this."  "i'm looking for a guy that's caring and understanding."  "i like romantic dinners and walking on the beach."  you probably already know what I'm thinking.  These crazy bitches are muthafuckin crazy.  you know that's not the first time she's ever tried online dating.  yeah, it's not the first time she's posted on yahoo but you know that funny lookin hoe is on match.com hotmail.com hornybitchesneeddick.com and fuckforfree.com  God damn.  Anyway, I'm getting to the funny part.  I got this e-mail today from match.com and I figured, hey I'll peep it since I want to see who I'm "compatible" with.  I see that I'm 90% compatible with this black female.  I was thinking, hmm..  that's strange.  There's all these fat middle aged white women that I'm 80-86% compatible with and the #1 on the list is this black beyotch.  So I click the link because I was curious and then I look at her profile.  It turns out, she is not a she.  She is actually a HE.  God damn.  Hahahahahaha.  I don't know how the hell those websites find matches, but they sure as hell have to be out of their mind.  Don't get me wrong, I'm sick enough to wear a leather mask and whip the shit out of a transvestite while putting electrical alligator clips hooked up to a car battery on their testicles while getting a blowjob from a midget and feeling on a 500 lb man's breasts.  But, we're talking about serious relationships.  I was really considering a serious relationship with someone off of online dating.  That's the reason why I joined in the first place.  "Betty is a computer software engineer that makes $150,000.  She's slightly overweight, but nothing a fifth of tequila and a fat blunt can't fix.  John is a loser.  He lies about who he is online and fucks a lot of horny chicks that way.  John met Betty off of Yahoo Personals and now they're married."  Damn!!!!  Hmm.. I wonder how much money that black chick-like dude makes?  Nah, I'm just kidding.  It would be kind of tough to pimp a transvestite, don't you think?  Since they have a pair of nuts, they already know every trick in the book.  A man's power lies in his nutsack.  It's like that with all primates.  The ones with the biggest nutsacks get the most pussy.  I know this because I have a big nutsack and I have all sorts of fat chicks that jock on me.  Why is it that only the fat chicks notice me and all the pretty girls just look away whenever I stare at them?  I know they were staring at me.  I know the looking game.  I'm not dumb.  Anyway, that's the funny story I had to tell.  It wasn't that funny, but I got a good laugh out of it.

						   There's this girl that I like in school and DAMN...  I keep on messing up.  Well, it's not that I keep on messing up.  I've missed out on two opportunities to get her #.  Make that three or four opportunities.  So this is what I'm going to do.  Next time the opportunity arises, I'm going to be honest with her.  I'm going to tell her, I'm shy but she should give me her number anyways and we should hang out and get to know each other.  I've got nothing to lose and a fine ass girl to gain.  I have to do this so that I can fall out of love with the girl that I'm in love with and I can move on and grow up.  It's time for me to stop fuckin around and acting like a boy.  It ain't easy.

						   When you love someone that doesn't love you, it reall sucks.  When you see the person you love, not love themself enough.  That sucks even more.  Love can suck.  I think most of the time it doesn't.  But, the times that it does suck, that's when you have to remember to stay calm and don't jump to any conclusions.  You see.  I'm in love with someone.  She doesn't love me in the way that I want to be loved.  You see, I want to be her confidant.  I want her to burden me with everything that is causing her to suffer so that I can walk side by side with her through it.  And I want to get the same in return.  Is that being in love?  You see, I don't know.  Because when I start questioning love, I also start dabbing into what is reality and what is just all in my mind.  If what I'm feeling is really what I'm feeling or if it's just a defense mechanism or a reaction to a beautiful woman that's really just my primal senses being triggered by some pheromones.  Reality or insanity?  Love is like being blind.  So, that's why I have came to the conclusion that love is like being blind.  It's some dangerous territory.  One wrong step and BOOOM, you step on a landmine, your nuts are blown into dust particles, and you are DESTROYED forever.  I'm still in love though.  Despite the fear.

						   is what my life now revolves around.  Within it's boundaries, I have found what I've been needing.  Discipline and focus.  Freedom is having control.  Discipline.  It takes a lot of discipline to learn music.  I give credit to great composers like Bach and Fitzer or whatever the fuck his name was.  They are the masters which created the rules which gave birth to modern music composing.  Computers are changing music though.  My teacher told me that I'm at a great place to be with where I'm at.  Even though I don't play an instrument, since I'm composing music on a computer, I'm on the edge of the future.  I guess I embrace the present moment too much to endulge myself in that idea.  I try to think of it humbly and focus more on the times which I'm facing right now because the sounds which I create now is what I strive to perfect.  It is reassuring though to know that ten or twenty years from now, electronic music is going to be respected amoungst the people who are going to be old later on.  As a musician though, I try to preserve a natural sound within my music.  I love electronics of course, but I enjoy the challenge of using technology to enhance what's already natural versus using technology to synthesize what's already real.  But, that's just my choice.  I respect all types of music whether it's real or virtual.  The band that I'm in now uses a mixture of both electronica and live instruments.  We had our first practice session last night and it was an experience which I can't describe in words.  The music we made was better than having sex.  When I was finished practicing, I felt like I had just released all my problems which were giving me stress.  I don't know how else to describe the feeling.  It wasn't like anything I've ever felt though.  I went to this bar after practicing and I also had another awesome experience.  I was at this bar in SF around midnight and I was kickin back in the crowd, stoned off some bomb ass weed, and listening to music.  Then there were these two beautiful lesbian chicks that started dancing with each other really close me, making out with each other while this sick ass singer was beatboxing some crazy ass drum n bass rhythms on the stage.  They were both staring at me, but I thought to myself, "don't say anything, don't ruin this experience.  just enjoy it and shut up, you fool!"  Damn, I was lucky enough to see that this weekend.

						   I had a real nice time hanging out with the girl from my class.  She's really nice and we get along pretty well.  She invited me to come over her house tomorrow so that's got me pretty jazzed up.  Let the good times roll.

						   I quit smoking again.  This time I smoked for three weeks and now I'm going to quit for good.  Well, I can't say for good since I always seem to start back up again somehow.  I'm going to try to quit for a few years though.  If I can quit for 3 years, then I can quit for the rest of my life.  That's how I see it.  3 years will be a record.  These are the terms though.  Cigars don't count.  But I won't smoke them habitually.  Weed don't count.  But the same goes for weed.  Cigarettes are the worst.  They're so easy to keep on doing because they are relaxing and seem painless.  Smoking is a selfish thing to do.  I know I said I quit a few days ago, but I started back up again the day after.  I quit.  Cold turkey.  3 years is my goal.  Starting today.  I'm going to mark it in my Outlook as my anniversary quitting smoking day.  It will be easy to remember since today's my sister's birthday also.

						   I got that girl's # today.  The six foot tall super fine chick that I was nervous to talk to.  I got the chance to talk to her today and she's really nice.  She's so damn pretty.  I'm pretty happy that I am going to get acquainted with her.  I was speaking to this other hot chick at school today from one of my other classes.  But, the funniest thing happened.  I was conversating with her from across the classroom before class began.  Then after class, I chased her down and was like, "HEY, where you headed to?"  And she looked to her side sort of afraid at first since she wasn't used to getting chased down, but I was just talking to her and cracked a joke and she smiled and I was like HOLY SHIT.  This girl had a major snaggle tooth.  I know that's mean to say.  But, she's like super duper hot.  Her body is just so nice and petite.  Her face is really pretty.  But, she's got the snaggle goin' on.  HAHAHA.  Damn.

						   I feel this pain tonight.  I'm home from my sister's birthday party now and I feel a little uncomfortable after going out.  It's not because of the people I was around.  Since I've changed so much, I feel like I'm so distant from everyone.  Being around people that are drinking isn't so pleasant for me.  I pick up a lot of energy that's negative and I know it's not directed towards me, but it's there.  I wish that it wasn't.  I wish I didn't pick up those vibes and that I could smile and laugh and joke around.  Things are so serious though.  This seriousness is starting to hurt me I think.  I used to not be so serious and I miss that feeling.  Honestly, I know what it is.  I'm not free.  If it's not drugs & alcohol that's keeping me down, it's something else.  Eliminating desire and trying to think unselfishly is pretty difficult.  This battle inside of my soul is never ending.  There are the moments when I appreciate everything and I couldn't ask for more.  Then there are the times like this.  When I wish I could just make some sense out of everything, but it doesn't make any sense.  I feel like I'm being pulled around by everyone and then pushed away.  Back to being lonely again.

						   Being unselfish rules.  You're the one with the problem, not me.  Haha.  Dude, I came across some racism this past weekend, doesn't that suck?  There was some racist guys at this party I went to.  They were drunk and picking on my friend that's half Asian.  I mean, I didn't hear the comments the racist people made about Asians being Oriental or something stupid like that, but my friend that's half Asian was really upset and stuff over that and the fact that these kids were picking on him.  I didn't pick up any racist vibes though really.  I just saw a bunch of drunk white people and that's about it.  I didn't really feel out of place being the only Asian person there.  There were some Mexican-looking sort of people too.  But, the atmosphere was really white I guess.  I didn't care though because I don't hate white people.  And I don't think white people hate Asians.  Drunk people just say stupid things and my friend just doesn't understand that I guess.  He told me that he went to college out in Arizona and that after 9/11, there were like three Arabian students that were murdered on his campus.  It was pretty insane for him being around that sort of area I guess.  I got deep in thought though last night.  I started thinking about how America is all structured and how all I really know is what it's like within the urban settings which I have been in all of my life.  It's a trip if you think about how outside of a metropolitan area, everything is all white, but when you come into the urban setting, you see a lot more diversity and racist is a lot less prevalant within these areas.  But, the real trippy part I thought about was how the hatred is out there and I really didn't feel it again until last night.  Here I am, on my medication, looking at the world from a satisfied point of view.  And in reality, a lot of hatred is hidden behind smiling faces.  I don't let it upset me though.  I didn't let it upset me when my friend told me about what happened at that party.  The way that I feel is that I can't change the world and I most likely can't change another person from feeling racism because that form of ignorance takes a lot of growing up to overcome.  It's not an overnight changing process that will make someone snap out of that sort of mentality.  I know because I was once racist myself.  The thing that I can change is myself.  I can be less selfish and not give into pride and hatred.  And by changing myself, I've made the difference in the world by not being racist, thus eliminating racism from my life.  But, when it does pop up again, I'll admit.  It's disturbing and it upsets me greatly.  I just know that violence isn't the solution to solving racism.  Raising awareness is the only way to overcome it.  And by shining the light in the dark, the cockroaches shall scatter away into the cracks of the walls, somewhere out to the corn fields of middle America, inside of a trailer park, hiding away, eating TV dinners, and reminiscing on their Indian-slaughtering great grand-parents.  I don't know.  I'm jumping to conclusions.  haha.

						   I need to be more patient right now.  Things aren't going as smooth as I'd like them to in my life.  I need to learn to be more patient just let things go.  In order to be rich, you have to earn more or desire less.  I'll choose the latter since finding a job is damn near impossible.  I'm inspired to write songs lately.  But, I'm sufferring from my own criticism on myself.  I have to remind myself everyday to not be selfish, be more patient, try not to desire too much, and appreciate what I do have.  It's the war that I'm fighting.  It tires me out.

						   I had a few cigarettes in the past day, but I haven't bought a pack.  As long as I don't buy a pack, I'll be okay.  I am starting to think more practical lately I guess.  Cigarettes are a waste of money.  Drinking soda at home is a waste of money.  Eating snacks is a waste of money.  I don't even want to drive an Accord anymore.  I wish I had bought a Civic DX.  My next car is going to be a Civic.  Possibly even a hybrid Civic.  When you're not in a rush to drive anywhere and you don't care about how cool you look while driving, it makes sense to save money on gas and do less damage to the environment.  Oh well.  It's all to the good.  If I was rich, I would want to drive a Range Rover 4.6 HSE.  Or a BMW M5.  But, until the day I'm rich, my mind is set on a Civic Hybrid.  That's my muthafuckin dream car.  Since my dream car is a Civic, I feel kind of like a pimp driving an Accord.  Even if it does have no radio, a bumper that's falling off, and cigarette burns all over the interior.  I haven't spoken to the girl that I like.  I don't want to call her because I want to wait until she calls me.  I am going to be a slut like that from now on because I can.  Plus, I found another girl that I'm really interested in.  We clicked on this level that made me feel fuzzy and she's real pretty and I think I have a better chance with her than with the other girl that I like.  This one's a vegetarian.  She still eats fish and shrimp, but no beef or chicken.  That's cool by me.  I told her that I don't eat sugar and I usually don't tell most people that I watch my sugar intake.  She didn't look at me like I was crazy.  The reason why I really like this girl is because everytime I see her, she asks me if she can listen to the latest song that I'm working on.  It's real nice to have someone interested in listening to my music since my music is the center of my life.  Sharing my music with someone is something I value a lot.  And seeing someone really appreciate it is the best feeling.  Music theory is really helping me in composing songs too.  I was making music in the dark, but now I see the light.  I had this attitude before going into theory that I didn't want to be tied down into the rules and laws of music.  But, then I realized that I was being an idiot.  The rules make the music work.  It's a trip.  It's like how in the world, you have rules.  You don't necessarilly have to follow those rules, but it brings harmony when you do.  And in music, breaking the rules is what innovation is all about.  The same applies to all creative aspects of life.  It's neat how everything is connected I think.  But, it's also fucked up that there's a lot of people who are resistant to become a part of the collective.  Fundamentally, I think that nature is embedded in everything around us and absolute perfection is nonexistant because of this.  We would like to find perfection within machinery, academics, religion, and science.  But, machines break down from wear and tear.  Everything learned is theoretical and amenable to falsification besides religion which is unquestionable to it's believers.  And this is the reason why I believe in God.  Because I see a world that is trying to defy nature.  A world that doesn't feel like it is a part of nature.  I see human beings as a species that is trying to intellectually detach itself from nature and God.  And the problems that exist are ramifications of this conflict.  The insanity that erupts globally from people uprising in hatred and destroying their own species.  That's our nature.  I feel like a prisoner to these opinions.  I wish I was one of those people that didn't think and just lived without being so critical.  Opinions suck.  But, being opinionated is what symbolically interacting with the world is all about.  My music is like my opinion.  Since it's what sounds good to me, it's like my opinions that only I agree with.  That's why it feels so good to find someone that appreciates my music and wants to listen to it.  I feel like someone is listening to my opinion and agrees with how I feel.  Which is a trip.  She heard one of the beats that I made and asked me if I felt sad when I made the beat because the beat sounded sad.  I said that I didn't feel sad when I made it, but it occurred to me that sadness is what probably inspired me to make it sound that way.  I suffer from depression, so it makes sense.  Everytime I try to make happy music, it sounds sarcastic.  Like my sense of humor.  Cause the truth is, there's too much chaos around me that I'm aware of for me to be truly happy.  I don't mean to sound like a existentialist, but it's unexplanable.  I'm just gonna keep making the music because that's all I can do to make the insanity stop.

						   My third day without a cigarette.  How'd it go?  Pretty well.  I got two phone numbers from two girls that I wanted to get #'s from.  One is this pretty cute Black chick and this other one is this Japanese breezy.  I don't think I'll end up hooking up with any of them, but it's all to the good.  I got to go over the house of the girl that I like.  I met her family and got to talk to her for a while.  She's really sweet.  I don't think I'll be able to hook up with her because she seems to only want to deal with me on a professional level.  But, then again, things are going good.  I can't complain.  I just think that since I met her mom and dad, it's dropped me automatically into the friend zone.  The friend zone again?  I can't complain though because this girl's so hot.  I will be in her friend zone playing goalie and cock blockin all day everyday.  hahaha.  It's best to just let things flow naturally.  I'm just going to be myself and let God do the rest.

						   the rest of my life to go now without a cigarette.  Today wasn't so hard to quit.  I went to the Asian Film Festival out in San Jose and saw some Asian-American directed films.  That was quite an artsy fartsy experience that I will probably never forget.  The shit that I saw was pretty boring except for this one cartoon clip which was quite interesting.  The rest of it was pretty dark and there was a real depressing overtone to each film.  The theme of the films were Shadows and Light though.  If the sadness & depression is represented by the shadows, then I guess having hope would be the light that casts the shadows down onto its surface.  The underlying value for these movies is hard to catch, but I would say that peace is the most prominent value that the movie authors wanted to portray within their films.  Peace between man & woman, between each others cultures, and amoungst ourselves within our cultures as well.  War is something that we would be better off without.  But nature is embedded in us and madness is written within our genetic code.  Have we forgotten that we are a part of nature?  I am aware of it.  I am trying to live with my desires parallel to my destiny.  What I am destined for is going to find me and nature is going to determine whether I receive my blessings or not.  The thing is ... I think that sometimes I forget about nature and I turn into a machine processing data in 0's and 1's.  Seeing the world as good and bad, wrong and right, heaven and hell, the God & the Devil.  Bipolarizing my views and narrowing it down to this or that.  You can get with this or you can get with that.  You can get with this or you can get with that.  You can get with this or you can get with that.  I think you'll get with this cause this is where it's at.  Ah man.  The girl from my school was busy this weekend so I was unable to see her.  I want to buddy up with her for this school project we got going on.  I want to write up a business & marketing plan for my music industry class.  On top of the songs I record as well.  I don't count the songs as the project.  But the business plan is actual work, so I think it'd be wise to take care of that.  This girl is super hot though.  I mean, it's not just the physical side of it that gets me.  She's real opinionated and speaks very passionately about how she feels about everything and I think that's real attractive.  I want to be able to hang out with her more often, but I'm not trying to make myself look too eager.  Can't chase the cat away.  I gotta look the other way until she comes around and needs attention.  Yes, I believe that guys are like dogs and ladies are like cats.  But, I can't think about her too much.  Because when I get to doing that shit, it goes all fucked up and I end up screwing up what could've been a good friendship.  So, I'm trying to be less selfish, not think about how hot she is, and focus more on how I could be a friend to her rather than get my hand on her tatas.  I quit smoking, so I can exercise more again.  I have been going only twice a week.  I want to bump that back up to three times a week and do more cardio so that I could have more energy during the daytime.  I want to change my sleep schedule so that I can wake up without being so tired during the weekdays.  So, I plan on waking up at 6AM this week and working out during the morningtime versus working out in the evening because that makes it hard to sleep.  So, I need the strength to do this for myself.  It will improve my life and make me a better person for the people that I care about.  They'll know a Doug that gets better and better.  In God's image, of course.  Whatever the fuck that means?  Actually, I'm not living God's image like Ned Flanders.  I'm turning into an artsy fartsy, post-modernistic, techno junkie.  I've fallen victim to Diesel jeans fashion and feminism.  Metrosexuality is like the epitome of slavery, consumerism, and sadomasochism mixed up in a blender to make the most fucked up Jamba Juice you've ever tasted.  Bitter as fuck without any sweetness.  Tart like orange peels and nasty like smoking dried up banana peels to try to get high off of.  This is the Jamba Juice of my life.  Drink it and suffer along with me God damn it.

						   i said i would do it.  so fuck.  I'm doing it.  i had three cop cars surrounding me today because i ran a red light on accident.  so, i guess once the cop punched my lisence into the computer system, she saw that i was registered as a "violent offender", so two more cop cars came to surround my car.  one of them asked me, "what are you claiming?"  I was like, "HUH??"  He said, "are you claiming any gang?"  I was like, "NO fuckin way.  I'm a college student with a muthafuckin 3.3 gpa."  Which is probably a shitload better than his measly high school diploma.  Fuckin asshole.  Cops should be required to have at least a bachelor's degree I think.  I don't look like a gangster in any sort of way.  Maybe it was my orange t-shirt.  Yeah, I am banging the Tangerine Mafia.  Cops suck dick.  Anyway, I'm going to quit smoking not because I got pulled over, but because I've been saying how I'm going to.  So, there you have it.  It's done.  Three years is how long I'm going to try to go without smoking a cigarette starting tonight.  My interaction with the police today got me thinking.  I guess even though I thought I served my dues to society, it's on my permanent record now.  I never had that brought up before when I got pulled over, but I guess I'm in the system now for some reason.  That's ok.  Because the cops can't catch me doing anything wrong because I never do anything wrong.  I don't get into fights with people even if they're the ones instigating trouble.  I don't do drugs.  I don't steal.  I don't do anything but go to school, make music, and try to get a little nookie.  But, I do accept responsibility for what I've done in the past, even if it was as a juvenile.  I am still willing to accept the consequences to this day.  And I think that I'll have to pay the rest of my life for the mistakes that I've made during my adolescent years although I really am upset about how I'm trying so hard to do well now and I get a kick in the nuts by the law after all this progress.  I know I did a lot of fucked up shit when I was a kid.  But I never chose to be in the frame of mind that I was in.  My choices that I made were made out of confusion.  I was lost and confused.  I didn't want to be that way.  And now here I am wishing that I didn't have this glass ceiling placed over my head.  I blame myself for all of this rage.  I am angry out of selfishness.  I know it.  This is why I beat myself up and question my reason for living.  They're trying to say to me, "you can't get a job.  you;re labeled as a violent offender. no one will ever hire you."  So, fuck getting a job.  That's what I say.  If my parents could be self employed and make a decent living, then so can I.  I'm damn proud of my parents and other Koreans that survive without knowing how to speak english very well and being able to live in this country without having to assimilate into the ways of thinking like a fuckin retarded ass piece of shit robot.  But I know how to speak English and say FUCK YOU to anyone I feel like.  Cops suck dick.  They are gayer than gay and they have no type of fuckin brain to think for themselves.  They just uphold a stupid system of laws that's the reason why the crimerate is so fucked up.  I could talk on and on about my opinions, but it all boils down to one thing.  Money.  They want to make these stupid laws to penalize people because courts, jails, prisons, tickets, tax dollars.  It's all just a fuckin business.  All of this money goes to the government and when it reaches the top of the pyramid, it's all spent on weapons of mass destruction to massively destroy other people so that they could have the same fucked up system setup where they live.  Fuck it.  FUck it all in the nostril.

						   I'm losing my mind~!  I missed 2 classes this week.  I never miss class.  Ahhh, I shouldn't beat myself up.  It's just I was thinking about how teachers usually wake up for every class and they're never late.  I know that they get paid for being there, but still.  If I was a teacher, I'd want my students to put forth the same effort that I'm putting in to make it on time.  I've been tired as shit.  I know why.  It's these damn cigarettes.  So I took this pack that I have and I gave it to my pops.  He can smoke it because he still smokes and he still functions normally although he smokes.  Smoking cigarettes fucks with my performance and I need to quit.  I am going to quit.  FUCK.  It's been bugging the shit out of me so bad so I might as well just do it and get on with it.  Smoking cigarettes is retarded.  Last week I quit for four days.  I relapsed for two days and now here I am quitting again.  It's not easy.  It gets harder and harder to quit each time I start again.  This is it.  No more fuckin cigarettes.  NO MORE !!!!  (crowd cheers)

						   I am selfish again.  This week, I'm going to be less selfish.  I keep on relapsing back into being selfish.  This isn't good.  No wonder there's not going to be many people making it into heaven once Jesus returns.  It's not easy being unselfish, I'll tell you that.  This week I'm going to quit smoking cigarettes and eating junk food.  These two things I shall accomplish this week.  I'll be back on track with eating right and exercising and being drug free (including tobacco).  Of course unless a hot chick calls me and wants to get drunk and roll around naked.  I'll have to be selfish in that case.

This is my crappy little poem I write.  Off the top of my head like my scalp and lice.  Not to be mistaken with being nice.  This is my pain.  It won't go away....

						   I feel pretty shitty still.  I know what I have to do to get my mojo back.  I'm going to start hitting up some clubs right when I get back from NY.  I might possibly do a show that same week right after I get back at a club out in Sf called Top.  There's another venue called the Oasis in Oakland or SF which I'll be rockin soon too.  I think there's quite a few clubs out in SF that's down to book my band as soon as we have our set together.  Since it's rare to see a techno band, it's like a commodity.  So I should be glad about that I guess.  I have to be successful I guess before I really feel happy about what I'm doing.  Success to me isn't being super rich.  I just want to have a nice home studio that I work out of and make music for a living.  I was thinking of making music for pornos.  The music is usually so wack and my friend was telling me that we should form a production company and sign a contract with a porn company.  That wouldn't be a half bad idea.  We'd probably get all the free porn in the world.  Anyway, the direction I'm taking my music is into the electronic realm.  I'm going to learn how to sound design and program synthesizers.  Once I get my hands on this one book by this MIT professor.  I'll sit down for a week or two and then I'll be able to solidly grasp the concepts behind sound synthesis.  I want to be able to program the actual sounds themselves and I think I should be able to do this less than a year from now.  But, besides that, my specialty is mixing and I want to focus on that as well.  That's why I'm going to get the studio monitor speakers before I get a synthesizer.  I'm stuck between getting a pure analog or a virtual analog synthesizer.  There are a very few analog synthesizers out on the market right now.  I wanted to buy one before they became extinct.  The one I would like to get costs about three thousand bucks.  That's a lot of fuckin money for a keyboard.  But with all the techno heads out on the street, I think I'd be able to make the money back and then some.  Mars n Mystre and the other Skills producers mainly use an Access Virus synth I think.  This is a virtual analog synth.  I want to get true analog because that's the sound that's missing from a lot of shit that I hear come out.  Hopefully, I'll be able to find one used when it comes time to shop around for this.  I think I should be able to get this synth next fall.  In the meantime, I'm going to get good at doing digital stuff.  Digital is the future and all.  But, digital doesn't sound nearly the same as analog when it comes to certain sounds.  There's qualities I noticed to both.  But since I'm overloaded with digital stuff on my computer, an analog synth would be the way to go.  Now there's a difference between analog and virtual analog.  I love how both of them sound and it's tough to say which one I should choose for my first piece of music hardware that I buy.  The analog is a lot more expensive, but from an investment point of view it would be better to get.  Since people will hear the shit that I make with the analog synth and wonder what I used to make my music versus using a virtual analog synth and sounding like a lot of the other shit you normally hear.  So I decided that true analog is the way to go.  Even though it's more difficult to use.  I think that I should take on the challenge of mastering the true analog sound because analog synthesis in virtual analog form is based on true analog principles.  The analog beast is a lot more wild and the stuff that it can do is way crazy.  Digital is cool too.  Don't get me wrong.  It all boils down to a good mix though.  Without a good mix, it doesn't matter what you use.  You could be using the best keyboard in the world and still sound like shit if you don't know how to mix.  It's all pretty damn tricky.  You get to wondering when it's not art anymore because of all the technology involved.  But that's electronic music.  When you see what it's really about, you learn that there's really not much to it.  I just want to stick with it so that twenty years from now when it starts to really get crazy with quantum computers and holographic hard drives, I can still be composing some grimy ass music.

						   I wish I knew why life has to be so rough.  Listen to me.  Things don't make sense right now.  Time is slipping and it feels as though time is running out.  I'm on the edge.  I am frustrated with myself.  And I keep on messing up.  I make the same mistakes over and over again.  It's like my life is running on tivo and Satan is sitting back with a remote control rewinding and replaying all of my embarrassing moments and laughing at me while eating a bag of Cool Ranch Doritoes.  Everytime I think I've knocked down the wall around me, something happens and I have to reconstruct it all over again in order to keep myself from being dissappointed.  My brain hurts.  My appetite is gone.  Things are all wrong.

						   I can't eat, sleep, and I feel like not doing anything at all.  I hate being depressed.  It's so fuckin annoying.  You might think it's funny, so laugh all you want.  I could care less.  I laugh at people that are miserable all the time so I deserve it.  There's people that are doing worse than I am with depression.  The funny part about that is that they don't even know it's depression.  They're just miserable and they don't even have a clue as to why they feel like such fucktarded idiots.  I know why I'm retarded.  It's because my brain is all fucked up and that's why.  You see, I'm normal.  It's just that the world that I live in happens to be really really fucked and majorly destroyed beyond restoration.  I am a kind and sensitive dude and being in this angry, insolent world has made me depressed.  I am not blaming all my problems on the world.  Just my depression.  I know the other problems in my life are my fault and I accept full responsibility for those issues.  But as far as me being depressed and wanting to die.  That's the world and all of the pretentious, miserable, insecure fuckers that live to put other people down to make themselves feel better.  It makes me want to just die.  The fear and agony.  Fuck.  I am also depressed because of my desires.  The desire to gain is the culprit of my insanity.  This desire cannot be destroyed because it's my nature.  This greed is embedded into my soul since I happen to be a human fuckin being that's been programmed by capitalism to compete and destroy all enemies.  Be number one.  The best.  Don't settle for less.  Keep up with the muthafuckin Joneses.  I'm sick of it all.  I'm sick of it to the point where I put my cellphone on silent mode and I refuse to speak to anyone.  Because this greed and selfishness is inside of everyone.  Inconsiderate fuckin shitty world.  I tried to be this way.  I did.  I tried to be selfish and did it make me happy?  Yeah, for a while it did.  But, now I'm back to shedding my blood.  Sacraficing myself and playing Jesus like I always do.  Being depressed, yackitty yacking on about how miserable I am like the rest of the world.  Trying to make sense of all the madness, when it really doesn't make sense to anybody.  ...  I feel like I do so much for everyone.  I give and give and give and give and don't ask for anything in return.  I don't even have any big expectations from others.  I just want to be the coolest.  The nicest.  The least selfish.  People don't understand.  They use me.  They think that I'm just here to use.  But I'm not.  I want the same in return from others.  But do I ever get it?  Never.  I never do.  NEVER EVER EVER EVER.  And if I were God, I'd destroy the planet.  That's for being inconsiderate towards me.  That's for forgetting all the nice shit that I did for you and treating me like a piece of shit.  DIE DIE DIE DIE.  All of you!!  You deserve to die.  I would if I could.  I'd pull that switch on the planet so quick.  Lights out.

						   I'm a loser.  I'm so broke.  All I have to show for myself is a stinkin GPA that I didn't even try that hard for.  This is why I can't get a girl.  Because I know that I'm a loser.  I'm funny looking.  I have low self-esteem.  The only thing that keeps me living is this crappy music that I make.  I make some shitty ass music and I keep on investing all of this time into it, but it'll probably amount to nothing in the future just like everything else I've ever done.  And everyone understands.  That's why they feel sorry for me.  The only reaason why I have any friends is out of sympathy probably.  They feel sorry for me.  I don't feel sorry for myself though.  I deserve this crappy ass life that I'm living in.  I don't deserve to have nice things like other people do.  I haven't worked hard to earn anything so I deserve to have nothing.  I'm surprised my parents haven't thrown me out on the street by now.  They can't see it.  They think I actually have some hope.  But honestly, there's no hope.  It would be really nice if I got shot in the head.  I don't want to do it myself because that isn't the way I would want to murder someone.  I would want someone to be tortured slowly and die out a little bit day by day like how I'm dying.  Suffering the gradual pain of being a nobody.  Having nothing and bearing with it until the day they decompose into maggots and flies.  Dying instantaneously from a gunshot would just be too lenient.  God I'm a fuckin loser.  I'm sorry that I am so pitiful.  I apologize for not being good enough.  I never asked for too much did I?  All I ever wanted is to be a part of something and have something be a part of me.  A race.  A nationality.  A religion.  A school.  A family.  I never wanted to be put in this place where everyone's so hurt.  I'm not running away from this truth.  I admit it.  All of the happiness I once had is gone.  The day has finally turned into night again.  This life is just a big pit of bullshit and the pit is overflowing with bullshit.  I used to get angry and become violent.  But, I refuse to allow myself to be able to release the bullshit.  I'm going to bottle it all inside like I always do.  I'm going to whip myself on the back like a slave owner until I faint from the pain.  Fuck.  I hate myself.  I hate this life.  I hate everything.  I'm officially a hater.  I feel so much hate that I don't even appear as being hateful anymore.  I smile.  Laugh at jokes.  I know how to fake it and hide it.  I act like everything's ok because it "should" be.  The truth is.  It's not ok.  I am so beat up from so much pain that I can't even cry.  I try to force myself to, but it doesn't work.  My mind is so fucked up that I can't cry.  I quit doing drugs thinking that I will be able to escape this pain.  I eat all the right foods thinking that that'll work.  I quit smoking.  I exercise.  I take these meds thinking it'll work.  But, none of it works.  I just have to bear with it and tough it out.  Hope that there's some sort of miracle.  I hate being so lonely.  Really.  It hurts so bad.  I don't know how I can keep dealing with this.  I can't be happy and alone at the same time.  I could analyze myself down to the chromosomes and my homo ergaster ancestor's fossils.  But this doesn't help.  It doesn't rationalize or justify shit or make any of the fucked up shittiness go away.  God damn.  I'm a fuckin loser.  I lost.  You win.  Where's the reset button?  Don't I get more lives to play?  Nope.  Only one life.  And I fuckin lost.  There's no way to win.  I will always be a stinkin nobody and I refuse to accept it.

						   Jam session brought me back to sanity.  Rocked the schoolhouse this evening.  Ripped the walls off the midi lab.  God Damn.  Code Breaker is the muthafuckin band.  Pretty soon, I'll be doing live shows on a regular basis.  My band can bring songs together seamlessly.  We mesh together without much error because we're all musically talented to the point where pitch and timing isn't something that anyone needs to work on.  The sound from the new sound system is really bad ass too.  Enough said.  I'm sleepy.  I need to get a girlfriend too.  =(  I think that God isn't providing me with one because I'm still not ready for it yet.  There's greater things at hand that need to be taken care of possibly.  I don't know.  All I know is that it's not time for me to have a girlfriend yet since I don't have one.  I wish I did though because it's getting a little lonely sometimes.  OH well.

						   My trip to NY was great.  Going back to NYC put me back in touch with my roots.  I walked through my old neighborhood and saw how things haven't changed so much.  I met an old friend from kindergarden and saw how he's still the same in a lot of ways as well.  So, after my trip, I realize why I am who I am after seeing where I was born and raised.  NYC is grimey.  It's angry.  It's always moving and it's never satisfied.  Most strangers out there don't look you in the eye for some reason.  I don't know why.  It's impersonal like that.  Most New Yorkers don't drive cars.  They walk and use public transportation.  That's how I got around while I was out there.  It was cold when I first got there.  Then for a few days, it rained down like fuckin Gotham City or someshit.  But, after the rain, the weather was so nice.  It was like New York weather at it's best.  That's like how my mood changes.  It doesn't feel that way in California since the weather is always nice for 98% of the time.  I still need my mojo though.  My mojo isn't back yet.  I gained twelve pounds from eating all the food out there.  New York is where the good food is at.  I haven't exercised in a week also.  I had a fuckin vacation.  I feel good.  Just not energized.

						   I drank three forty ounce bottles of beer today.  WHY?  Why not?  Fuck a rhetorical question.  You know how good it feels to drink three forties?  Not only is it something true hardcore gangstas can accomplish, but it also has a way of aleviating a person's worries and struggles in life.  Take my worries and struggles for instance.  While I was intoxicated off of my three forties, I laughed, and forgot about why I drank those three forties in the first place.  I'm not buzzed anymore.  It's been about 8 hours and I finished the last forty about four hours ago.  I dont think I'm going to do this every weekend.  But, it's a great way to relax.  I realized that I'm 24 years old and I'm not in high school anymore.  I can go to 7-11, buy a 40, drink it, go back and buy another one, and it's OK.  It's only against the law if you get caught drinking a forty while driving your Honda through the suburbs at 4 in the afternoon.  If the cops don't pull you over, then what law are you really breaking?  Don't spill any beer now.  That's a party foul, yo.

						   Life is like a hurdle.  You can't move over it like a turtle.  Slow and steady doesn't win the race.  You gotta be ready to jump over anything in front of your face.  That's life.  It's a road of strife.  Twists and turns.  Flames that burn.  Desire that yearn.  Fuck life.  It's not all that it's cracked up to be.  It's overrated like Grammy nomanies.  I hate it.

						   I'm going through a phase of major tension.  This is the case.  It's all my fault.  I admit it.  I've always been a major stress case.  I wish I knew why.  I've got some major issues.  First off, I want people to not be selfish.  This is just a dream though of course.  I don't consider myself too selfish.  I'd say I'm pretty considerate towards other people.  For being in the circumstances that I'm in and all, I'm not such a prick.  I am positive most of the time and keep an optimistic perspective.  But, I been stressed the fuck out.  I feel like seeing something explode.  It could be anything.  Even if it was an old grandma just crossing the street with a walker.  If she exploded and spontaneously combusted right before my very eyes and burst into flames and a mushroom cloud of smoke, I would feel better.  Is it the sadomasochistic psycho in me?  Do I enjoy pleasure from other people's suffering?  No.  I don't.  I actually am very empathetic towards others and I consider this my downfall a lot of times.  I just have this desire to see something explode.  I should go to the shooting range and let off a hundred rounds.  I would if I could.  That's the quote of the decade.  The 2000 decade quote of Doug Yim.  I can't so I won't.  That's my 2010 premonition I guess you can say.  Pessimistic?  Nah, realistic.  Fuck this planet.  The only thing that exists here is a bunch of animals acting like robots.  Mechanical systematic creatures of destruction.  I'm sick of science and theoretical rhetorical yaddy yaddy.  It's down with the grimey but it's all just conceptual.  What the fuck is this shit?  You have technology which is supposed to bring humanity together via improving communication.  But, the fact is.  People don't know how to fuckin communicate.  And it ain't the computer's fault.  It's all the pride and egotistical mistrust and assumptions that are made.  Conclusions are jumped on by grown folks like a fuckin bratty ass kid on a trampoline and communication is all fucked up because we're all just ethnocentrical know-it-alls without any consideration for what anyone else thinks.  This isn't the case for me.  I am good to compromise.  With people.  I don't compromise my livelihood or integrity.  I wouldn't sell my soul to the devil.  This is the problem I face daily.  Nobody is willing to compromise.  This is what the U S of muthafuckin A is all about though.  You don't have to compromise shit in the USA.  You could be a woman with a penis implant that's had a sex change to become a woman again with lasic eye surgery and fake ovaries.  And you can get away with it in the US.  You could worship a leather shoe and go to the mall every weekend to reinforce your belief that that leather shoe is the greatest of all leather shoes that has ever existed and you know what?  You're okay.  Nothing's wrong with you.  You can fill up your bathtub with vegetable oil and peanut butter and call this the next healthiest thing to do and chances are you're right.  I'll compromise within certain limitations, just like everyone else.  There's certain things I won't compromise.  But, overall, I am open to compromise because shit is dynamic.  Static, stationary, monotonous routines have confined me in the past.  The moldy ass mold.  The cycle is just cycling and turning like a hamster wheel.  And where am I headed to?  I want to go to outer space and live off of freeze dried space pizza and recycled water from my own piss.  With some alien space bitches with three or four titties.  Drrrreaaming...

						   I need a scholarship.  For the sake of my future synthesizer which is going to cost two thousand bucks.  The Alesis Andromeda A6 is the keyboard which I made up my mind to get.  It costs $3K brand new, but, me being me, I'm going to get a refurbished one with a manufacturer's warranty for a thousand less.  I have this feeling that I'm going to land a scholarship.  I just don't know how much it's going to be.  I pray that I get something around the three to four thousand dollar area so that I can buy two keyboards and be laying down some ridiculous tracks.  Off the top of my head, I would get the Andromeda and either a Nord Lead 3 rack or a Access Virus C.  Analog sound and virtual analog is the shit.  Well for keyboards it's the only good choice for me to make.  I can create sicker digital sounds on my computer than I could on a digital keyboard I think.  As far as analog, that's impossible to produce on my computer.  Virtual analog just isn't the same on a computer as well.  I heard the Andromeda when I was out in NYC and it was sickening.  The Access Virus was another synth which left quite an impression upon me.  But the Nord Lead 3 is very smooth and the programming is very intuitive.  These synths are all keepers as well.  They wouldn't get played out as time passes.  I would always be able to have a use for either one of these synths.  I wish I could get all 3 of them.  Why not?  With an Alesis Andromeda A6, Access Virus C, and a Nord Lead 3.  Shit, if I owned those three keyboards, I would be making some pretty crazy music.  With the shit that I learned from music theory.  God has blessed me.  I'm going start with the andromeda.  My partner in crime is getting the Access Virus C.  With these two at our disposal, we'll be able to flip something nice.  The next move would be to make money and buy more synths as well as other gear.  This TC Electronics reverb unit that costs around six thousand would be nice.  I don't think many producers have the chance to own one of those.  That shit is my dream right now.  Fuck a mercedes or a bmw.  You might think I'm a geek, but I would rather own a TC Electronics reverb unit than a luxury car.  Shit, even the TC Electronics Powercore would be nice to have.  Thank God for subsidized student loans.  I hope that five years from today, I own a bunch of gear and that I can be laying down tracks that rake in enough money for me to keep on buying gear and making music.  One thing that I don't want for myself is to have to resort to selling beats to McDonald's or Burger King commercials.  Shit, right now I'm looking into selling beats to HGTV.  Yes, that's Home Garden Television.  That might be the ticket to getting money for new synthesizers.  I need a prayer peeps.  Help me out.

						   peep this song i made.  click  urlLink here  to check it out.  this song was made using only software, so it's not all that great.  it's not really sequenced or mixed yet.  just wanted to share some music.  what i've been doing with my life.  it's some grimey drum n bass shit.  when i get my access virus classic this week, i'm going to lay down some really hardcore tracks.  but, not everything i make will be too hardcore.  i'm not trying to pigeonhole myself into a certain subgenre that will make me a starving artist.  i'm happy with the shit i'm making though.  the hardware that i'm getting could not have came at a better time.  because now i'm at the point where i could really utilize some good hardware.  doing everything software based has helped me learn theoretically what sounds good with music.  but, in order to get that umph in the sound that i'm going for, hardware is something that will give me that natural quality that's more organic versus a sound that's purely digital like what you hear on this mp3.  the mix is all bad on this song.  the drums are too low and the bass is too loud.  i am going to fix it soon.  i'm just lazy i guess.  between writing a business plan, writing essays, reading books, and making music, i don't know what the fuck i'm doing sometimes when i'm mixing.  the hardware that i get is opening up my music to a new world though.  that's what i've been needing.  check it out though.  new song.  called Chemikal Reaktion.

						   I want my laptop now!!  Shit.  They haven't even shipped it yet.  Damn fuckin paypal payments take too long to transfer.  I even already have a leather laptop bag for my laptop.  It's just waiting to have my new IBM laptop nice and snug inside of it, so that I can take it all the T-Mobile Hotspots around the Bay Area.  Yup, that's me.  I'm a Starbucks slut!  I order a venti iced coffee with hazelnut syrup.  No room for cream.  Extra ice.  That's my specialty drink customized for my caffeine fix.  I get about two refills.  Shit, the drink itself costs two bucks.  I better get two refills at only fifty cents each.  I also get a lot of schoolwork done when I am running on three venti coffees.  Today, I finished about 75% of my business plan.  It's a crappy business plan since the forecasted market growth is all just blind estimates, but fuck it.  I know that by the professionalism of it, that it's bound to get funded by either the state or some Joe Schmoe investor.  That's if I seek capital, which I won't have to do since I've got an angel investor.  This business plan is pretty much rock solid.  I mean, just writing things down on a plan is opening up my eyes to the potential that I have not only as an artist, but also as a entrepreneur.  I don't desire to make millions off of my little record sales, but I do want to build up a decent home studio so that I can offer some freelance work and branch off into other areas professionally.  That's definitely where I should take my music now since I'm more than halfway done building up the studio I currently have.  I took a trip out to SFSU and saw the BECA department there.  BECA = broadcast something communications arts.  From looking at the equipment that they have to offer there, I don't think that that school has a lot of resources that would be a big benefit to me since I own a lot of shit that's more cutting edge than the shit they have.  Not to sound cocky or anything.  I have Pro Tools, Cubase, and Reason.  The only thing they have is a console with more track controls.  Big deal.  They don't have Mackie HR824 studio monitor speakers.  That's like the most important thing to have when mixing and engineering.  It's probably not the best place to gain hands on experience compared to a trade school, but I am looking forward to the knowledge and the contacts I'll gain though.  I think that the bachelor's degree will be a breeze to obtain.  Having that degree is going to open up a lot of doors that probably wouldn't be available if I didn't have that degree.  And I already know that in my educational career, I'm not going to learn what I really really want to learn until I go into the graduate program at Mills College for computer music.  The computer music department there is hands down one of the best places to learn about computer music in the country.  It's the home of something called MaxMSP which is an object based audio programming software that uses C++ (i think) to create instruments, effects, and a bunch of other shit.  It even delves into visual-based music applications for crazy visual effects and shit like that.  Do I want to learn MaxMSP?  Hell yes, I do.  I want to get even deeper into it and learn how to use this other shit called...  I forgot.  But, it's strictly code-based programming that's used to make computer music with.  That's when you start to become less of a music producer and go into the area of avante garde artsy fartsy type of shit.  I think the direction I'm headed is in IDM (intelligent dance music).  I'll still make slammin tracks of course.  But, every now and then as an artist I like to stretch my limits to see how much tweaking I can really do with the shit that I make.  I am thirsty to learn more so that I can use the knowledge I've gained and do some more crazy shit.  I'm not intimidated by the code.  I'm just not ready for it yet, I think maybe.  If SFSU can offer some type of course in that type of computer music programming, I'm definitely going to try to learn as much as I can in that area to prepare me for graduate studies.  The master's degree is what it's all about.  You can't just have a bachelor's anymore now a days.  Mastering the craft just requires the knowledge first-hand and then the experience next.  I used to think experience was more important, but now I see that things are hand-in-hand.  I'm taking a more hollistic approach at life I guess because it's dangerous to make assumptions about anything.  Things are never the way that they really seem to be.  Life is deceitful.  I'm hanging onto my dreams with my dear life.  Slowly but surely, my desires will meet my destiny and I will find what I'm searching for.  Right now I don't even really know one hundred percent what I desire from life.  I know it's not materialism.  I know it's not a feeling of belonging to some righteous cause.  I think it is something within the center of myself though.  It boils down to freedom I think.  Being free from pain and suffering.  This is impossible.  But, this desire is the burden that I bear.  I want to forget about the past.  I want live in my dreams rather than suffer in the present.  It's simple.  Maybe I'm a simpleton.  I'm a basic person I guess minus the two strikes on my criminal record.  Well, at least I am alive right now.  I am living in a time where I can log my dreams and share them with the world via cyberspace.  I maybe just one individual.  A microscopic dot from a bird's eye view.  But, in this digital world, dreams are more vivid than ever before.  Look at all of the light around us.  It sounds corny I know.  I've learned all about the history of electronics, computers, and broadcasting.  It's just amazing how quickly everything's developed and how it's just becoming more rapid as it evolves.  The illuminated mind of modern man is like a big fuckin flash of lightning within our evolution.  Five million years of existence and out of no where we have telephones, automobiles, satellites, computers, cellphones, all in less than a span of 200 years.  It's almost inconceivable.  I can't understand how it's possible sometimes and I feel like I'm trapped.  It's like a lyric I wrote.  Mechanical womb fetuses in silicon bubbles.  If you can hear my voice then you can feel my struggle.  There can only be one answer and that's God.  That's just my opinion.  There has to be a God.  And this falls back into dreams.  God is like a dream.  Dreams might not exist, but they are real in the sense like how God is real.  The way dreams drive us; they're like a spirit.  They can make us do evil things as well as good things depending on what's inside of our hearts and souls.  Every night I go to sleep, I dream about everything around me.  I think about everyone I know and I wonder about them.  Sometimes I can't even sleep because I think so much.  These days though I've been dreaming about synthesizers.  They're keeping me up and I can't sleep.  I just think about what I could do if I had this synthesizer.  The Alesis Andromeda A6.      Who needs a girlfriend when you have a synthesizer that will do whatever you want it to do?  Andromeda A6 is a lot like a girlfriend in the sense that analog is hard to control.  It takes patience, knowledge, and experience.  I love that synth.  I played with it while I was this music store in NYC and there was no other synthesizer I played that I fell in love with.  Not even the $5,000 Hartmann Neuron won my heart over like the A6 did.  It shall be mine someday.  I know that's very selfish of me to say after spending over $4,000 on other equipment.  But, you have absolutely no clue.  I'm living off of sandwiches and tortilla chips.  Enough said.

						   can't sleep.  but, i'm tired as fuck.  too much happiness maybe?  Mackie HR824s, Access Virus Classic, Etymotic Research ER4-S, and an Akai MFC42.  Hmm.. did I leave anything out?  Oh yeah.  An IBM T41.  I have five new toys.  Two of them I already got.  Three of them are on their way.  I hate waiting for stuff to be sent from UPS or FedEX.  That's the downside to buying shit on eBay.  But, if you can save about 900-1000 like I did on a laptop, then why not?  IBM laptops are supposed to be the best.  They have a good reputation.  I went with the IBM because I saw one that my cousin was using and it weighs less than 5 pounds.  This laptop I'm using right now weighs a lot.  It's pretty bulky too.  This laptop is less than an inch thick and weighs at around 4.7 lbs.  I am stuck with this laptop until I graduate from college.  I'll afford a better one by then.  Shit, with an Access Virus, I have not to worry.  Nobody can fuck with me.  I'm laying down the grimiest shit.  Strictly club fuckin bangas.  I had to get rid of my PA system but fuck it.  I need a synth.  My band is breaking apart.  I think there's only two members that form my band now.  My friend JBZ and me.  Oh fuckin well.  Most of the best techno groups are just two people.  Gouryella, Chemical Brothers, Crystal Method, and I'm sure there's others.  I see it as a long-term collaboration.  Later on we'll journey off for sure.  I'm just glad that the other band members are out to simplify shit.  When I register my record label as a publishing company and I'm writing out disbursements for song roylaties, I will be more than happy to write myself a fatter check rather than a slimmer check since I'd have to pay someone that's not putting near forth the effort that I am.  I'm talkin about sacrafices.  Time and money.  Artistry isn't to be mixed with money of course.  But, surviving is a game.  I'm not talking about success.  Just surviving.  Not being poor and living in the ghetto.  That's not the life that I want for myself.  I desire to live a lot better than that.  the ghetto is a fuckin trap.  i got a lot of ideas.  people don't have a fuckin clue.  they just think i make music.  but, this is more than just making music.  it's also dreaming..  imagining sounds and creating them like how we dream of our desires.  that's just how i feel though.  musicianship within me embraces that idea.  that's why i think a lot of music sounds wack.  the desire is not there.  the lack of desire is somewhat why there is a lack of imagination in artists.  i'm going off on a tangent.  just thinking to myself.  writing bullshit.  sleepy.

						   do you know where your sanity is?  mine is taking a vacation.  i got these headphones that sound so good, i couldn't take them off.  and now it's 3 in the morning.  oh well.  what's the point of living if you don't enjoy a nice pair of headphones?  there's people in india and china who have never owned a pair of headphones ever in their lives.  and i can say that i own a pair of the best.  5 out of 5.  koncept@gmail.com  Gmail is the latest trend.  With a gig of space, no other site can fuck with them.  A gig is a shitload of mailbox space.  I don't know how the fuck they did it, but I hope that it lasts forever.  I'd like to have a free gig of mailbox space forever.  It's too good to be true.  Let's all hope that I get my student loan tomorrow.  I've been grinding for over four months trying to get that piece of shit.  Grinding as in working.  Doesn't having to work for loan (filing paperwork) defeat the purpose of getting one?  aH OH WELL.  I got a letter today saying that my grades aren't high enough for a cal grant.  the requirement is a 3.0 and i have a 3.3.  I guess a bunch of other nerds have beat me to it??  Cal as in UC Berkeley grant?  I dont fuckn know.  All I know is that they can suck on my dick because they aren't giving me any money.  Oh well.  NO love loss.  I pray that I get a fuckin scholarship.  WHY?  So that I can buy some nice keyboards.  It's an educational investment.  Don't get it fucked up.  It's not for personal enjoyment.  It's because I'm going to be making music for video games and pornos once I graduate from college.  I'll probably make music for movies as well.  It's all about having a master's degree too.  Hopefully my juvenile criminal record won't keep me from being a teacher after I get my master's.  I'm sure I can move out of the state and become a teacher if worse comes to worse.  I'd hate to leave California, but shit.  They leave me no other choice.  I dont think Arnold is going to expunge my record.  He's only got love for the rich.  OH well.  FUCK IT.  I don't want to be a teacher anyway.  Actually, I do want to teach someday.  That's the sad part.  If I get a master's degree and I can't teach, that'd be really fucked up.  They run background checks for sure.  Shit, I remember when I was going to become a volunteer at this counseling center and they denied me the job because of my record.  That sucked.  Life sucks.  Yeah.  It sucks pretty bad.  I'm a disgrace.  I'll probably end up being one of those guys on the side of the freeway making some humorous signs asking people for money.  Hmm.. if I were a bum, I'd make a sign that says, "YO, I know you see me.  Don't ignore me.  You and I know that you could easily have become me.  Just one dollar is all I ask for so that I can go buy some crack."  I don't know why people like to call me a crackhead.  I once heard a rumor that someone was saying that I smoked crack.  That was pretty fucked up.  Well, God knows that I never tried coke in any form.  But, now ecstasy is a different story, but smoking crack is not the way to kick back and have some fun.  I hope that I don't end up a bumb on the street.  I think that's my worst fear right now.  I better pray.

						   streaming audio is the shit ..  i'm in the works of getting a website soon.  i'm taking a web design course next fall, so hopefully i'll be able to really get the hang of making websites.  i don't think i'll get in depth on the graphics and shit.  besides the web design, i'm going to take a c++ object oriented programming course which is probably going to make me really advanced in what i do musically.  since electronic music is heading in the direction of being completely virtual, meaning that hardware synths, effect modules, and other things which take up space will be obsolete, the best move to make would be to learn programming i think since you can only reach the really advanced techniques in electronic music if you know how to program.  well, even right now the biggest names in the game know how to program.  most computer music related programming is object oriented, so that's why i'm taking the object-oriented course versus the course that teaches the code itself.  i think that object oriented programming is the future of programming as well possibly, but i'm not quite sure.  it's hard to say since i'm not a programmer.  i am going to learn how to program though so that i can be more effective at what i do in the future.  i've invested a lot of time into this not to mention money so i might as well take it as high as i can.  the key is to not get lost in the education.  because i don't want to be all textbook and not be able to implement my knowledge into realworld musical applications.  a lot of the stuff that i'm composing now is based on the classical theory that i learned.  i try to take what new knowledge i get and apply it right away.  but, music theory is good because it's pretty timeless.  that's something that i'll be able to use as long as i'm making music.  i went out this weekend to a drum n bass club and met some dj's as well as other producers.  i don't mean to sound cocky, but these guys probably don't have 25% of the knowledge that I have when it comes to making electronic music.  they don't know what voice leading is or anything.  it's pretty horrible.  i don't know how they could be signed to a record label and inside magazine articles.  well, that's what code breaker is all about.  my bandmate and i made a pact to bring the drum n bass scene in our local scene up to a level that's as professional as the people in Europe are doing it.  we hope to set the professional standard in the Bay Area as far as how artists should approach the music and the scene.  me, personally, i'd like to just make a contribution to the underground rave scene growing so that it doesn't crumble under the government's jurisdiction.

						   i can't sleep now since my dad fucked with me earlier tonight.  i don't understand how he could say tell me that i'm worthless if i'm taking medication.  if i wasn't on these meds, i'd probably be out right now getting drunk.  i might even be plotting a bank robbery.  who knows?  just when i start to get comfortable to feel like i'm doing something good and right for a change, something always fucks with me.  life is just like that i guess.  it has it's way of doing that so that you are reminded that you're not the one that's in control of everything around you.  you are in control of yourself though.  i could've overreacted easily,  but i didn't.  but it still hurt to hear my dad say a lot of the things that he said.  i wish that i could have a dad that wasn't so angry sometimes.  i mean, i get to thinking about all the time that's been lost.  all the times that could've been better if only my dad wasn't so angry towards everything.  in reality, my whole life could've been better.  i would've never been so violent as a child and that wouldn't have led to me ending up in prison.  i can't blame him of course.  because it's not even his fault.  who's to blame though?  if i start blaming myself, then i think about all the wrong that i've done and i deserve to be punished severely for all the sins that i've committed.  maybe i'm being punished as we speak.  because i feel like i'm living inside of a bubble that i can't escape from.  i used to escape from reality, but now i'm dealing with it.  i'm tired of having to bear more burdens than i already have.  i want to move on from the past and i don't want it to keep dragging me down.  i wish my father wouldn't remind me about all the shit that i've been through with his anger.  when i see him get angry it just brings back all the bad memories i thought i put behind me.  i feel like it's too late.  this fuckin pain is just who i am.  it's why i don't get too close to anybody.  it's why i'm lonely.  i don't want anyone to know what it's really like to relate to me.  nobody likes to hear it.  people want chit chat.  they want jokes.  they want to talk about cars and clothes.  they want to eat food.  watch movies.  pretend that they're movie stars.  nobody likes to hear about why i never got to grow up.  why i'm still a little kid trapped inside of an adult's body.  i want to fake that i'm faking it.  Faking that I'm someone I'm not.  Pretending that I'm someone that I wish that I was like most people do.  All the exercise, eating right, getting good grades, and working towards a successful future means nothing if you can't look at yourself and say, you know you're alright.  no you're not just alright, you're good you.  who me?  maybe.  yeah.  that's the truth.  self-acceptance is something i can't accept.  i get really close.  really close.  i look and i see it right in front of me.  "confidence"  but when i think i have it, it dissappears like a desert's mirage.  i must be having a heatstroke.  sometimes i think my life is just one really long hallucination and i'm stuck somewhere in the future reminiscing about this moment in time, but in reality, i'm overdosing on some sort of drug.  40 years from now.  it doesn't make any sense at all.  how a father could not know how to love his own son.  i couldn't do that.  i just don't understand how we can be the same blood and be so different in our ways of thinking.  i know i inherited a lot of my dad's traits.  but, these times i'm living in now are totally different.  the generational gap is what it is.  my dad grew up in a time when industrialization came to korea and blew up.  i'm living in a time where information is blowing up and this is all invisible to his eyes.  his mind knows what he knows and it's hard to teach an old dog new tricks.  but, fundamentally, he has no central ideologies to base his beliefs upon but his own experiences of pain and sufferring.  it's not wise to live that way.  i believe that God has brought this to my realization.  because my relationship with my God has gone astray.  I was embelished in my work.  My studies, music, drinking, eating, sleeping.  Feeling ungrateful.  I know what must be done in order for me to learn from this.  i'll get through this and be stronger afterwards.

						   my dad is nuts.  i had to have a long ass conversation with him about the reasons why I'm on medication.  he was like, "why you takin drugs?"  i was like, "heroin is a drug, cocaine is a drug, marijuana is a drug.  effexor is medicine."  He had a real hard time grasping the concept of what happens when the human brain's receptors has trouble producing serotonin.  but, i made him understand where i'm coming from somewhat.  talking to him is a lot like talking to terry.  that's the kid that i used to tutor last year.  it takes a lot of patience and understanding.  my dad's first reaction to anything is to get upset.  that's his way of coping with things.  it's easier for him to get upset, blame whatever he's upset about on anyone or anything but himself, and forget about it.  i told him that that's not a healthy way to deal with anything because it causes tension to build up inside of him and that can lead to adverse health and emotional problems.  yeah.  i had to break it down to him without upsetting him and making him explode on me.  it's like being on the SWAT team and defusing a bomb.  he didn't explode though.  so, good shit.  phew.  good thing someone in this house is grown up and able to think with a clear mind.  if i wasn't on those meds, i probably would've said something stupid and have gotten kicked out of the house.  damn.  the shit that just creeps up on my ass and surprises the shit out of me.  why does my dad have to be so damn crazy for?  i mean, i'm crazy and i know i am, but i'm no where near as ignorant as my pops.  i at least have some empathy towards other and am able to have an understanding of where others are coming from.  i can't understand how he can be so detached from everything.  i don't think he'll change that about himself but it's never too late i think.  as long i made him realize that he should be proud of me, it's ok.  i don't live to make my dad proud of me.  that's not #1 on my agenda, but it's one of those things that i would like to see happen at least before i leave this planet and decompose into dust.

						   This ibm laptop is sick.  Best investment I've made in a long time.  Being mobile is where it's at.  The cool part is that I can steal wireless internet from my nextdoor neighbor if I wanted to since they don't know how to setup a secure network.  that's pretty cool if you ask me.  anyway, i have an 11gb sound library already on this laptop.  there goes about half of the space that I had.  that's just the shit so that i can fuck with sounds while i'm on the road.  i have to start really focusing on some ideas to create now.  yeah.  this laptop is my do-it-all machine so i better squeeze every bit of potential that i can out of it.  the cool thing is that i'll be using hardware synthesizers so that my cpu will have to do a lot less work and i can make a lot better music with hardware synths.  y'all have no idea what i'm talkin about but you will understand sooner than later.  i must sleep

						   This show I had tonight was awesome!  I fuckin rocked it.  When our set ended, people were sad like, Where'd the music go?  I felt bad that we had to stop our set, so I'm going to work with J Beezy to make our set longer and better.  I don't want people to want us to stop, but I definitely don't want what happened tonight to happen again.  We ripped it though.  Nobody was dissappointed at all.  People were just giving us so much love, I felt like I did something right for once.  This is definitely what I want to do with my life.  No doubt about it.  I think that Code Breaker is off to a good start.  Tonight reinforced all of my confidence in what I'm doing.  I wasn't nervous at all because I knew that people were going to love us.  We just don't sound bad, that's why.  It's not that we have a sound that's tolerable.  We have a sound that people want to keep on hearing because it's drum n bass that drum n bass fans like.  There were some hardcore drum n bass heads in the house too.  You can tell by the Army pants when someone's deep into drum n bass.  They gave it up though.  That was more than what I expected.  I expected nonchalantness like what I received my last show.  This wasn't the case though.  People gave it up.  I shook a lot of hands of people that I didn't know and that was tight.  To make someone feel that way with music.  To go outside of themselves and give a compliment, which is a really kind thing to do in this day and age in our society, is amazing.  I did that.  Me.  Doug.

						   One more track I uploaded.  I'm going to try to pull together $120 so that I can get a website registered for 2 years.  I found a place with cheap, reliable hosting.  If I purchase this two year agreement, I just have to put forth $120 to get the hosting and the domain registration and hosting for 2 years.  I have about $30 in my petty cash fund from selling CDs.  I'm going to scrape around for more.  I have a jar full of change that I'll cash.  I hope to have around $80-100 from the petty cash and change jar.  I'll convince my mom or dad to gimme the rest and I'll have a website hopefully.  5 GB of transfer a month should be more than enough to host a little music website.  click  urlLink here  to listen to my other track, "The Grimiest".  It has no bass and it's missing a couple more sounds which I'll add soon.  These two songs are my current projects though.  Chemikal Reaktion and The Grimiest.  I'll probably end up finishing up on both of them after I get my synthesizer and analog filter this week.  My laptop should arrive by Thursday.  That gives me plenty time to get all my schoolwork done.  Anyway, wish me luck on getting the website.  I'll need it.  Peace out.

						   i made a better mix of my latest song.  the link is underneath this post.  i'm still not 100% happy with the mix, but it sounds better than before.  i would say i'm 95% happy.  i definitely don't like how the mp3 quality sounds.  it takes away a lot of the detail from the actual mix.  you might not be able to tell, but it's all good.  i'd rather have y'all download a smaller file.  i'm gonna work on this song until it's perfected.  click  urlLink here  to get it.  i'm going to start posting up my songs on the web again.  i will have a website once i figure out how i'll pay for it.  with t-mobile hotspots at most of the starbucks in the areas that i frequently go around, i'll be able to get a lot more work done with my new laptop.  i just hope that they have 802.11g networks.  That would kick some ass.  i enjoy making techno music a lot more than hip hop.  i still enjoy making hip hop music though.  i'm trying as hard as i can to not become cocky.  a lot of peeps that make music are cocky and they aren't even famous or anything.  i hella don't want to be like that type of person.  this music shit to me isn't about the fame.  it isn't about the glamour.  it's about connecting with people on a massive level and uniting people from all different walks of life together.  music is like a religion in that sense.  i don't want to discriminate against anyone when i make my music.  i want it to be available to anyone that has two functioning ears.  i want a kid that listens only to hip hop to listen to my tune and say, that's fresh.  because in the underground scene of drum n bass, it has to grow and carry on in order to stay alive.  but, i don't think dnb is going anywhere.  there's a worldwide audience that loves it.  every clubkid is lookin for the hardest beat to dance to, every dj is lookin for the hardest vinyl to spin, and every producer is trying to drop the hardest track.  i'm gonna be cocky and say that you have to leave it to Americans to come out with the hardest tracks.  i'm not saying the rest of the world is soft, but America is insane.  We've got some serious issues.  Although I'm a happy person, there's an underlying sense of hatred inside of me.  Hatred towards evil, of course.  But, it's still hatred that I can admit is present.  I gotta let it all out so that it doesn't destroy me.  You know?  Probably not.  I'm fuckin nuts.

						   i'm a sucka.  why am i a sucka?  let's just say that i'm a sucka.  girls are nuts, yo.  i'm not going to single out any of them.  well, everyone is crazy.  i'll just say that girls are more insane than guys are.  not to say being crazy is bad or anything.  i get confused by the opposite sex though.  it's not because i'm gay or something.  i think it's actually because i'm not gay?  i think that's the conspiracy with gay guys.  some are really gay.  but, some are just really pretending to be gay so that they can understand women better since chicks love being around gay dudes and then they get to learn about women and then they go back to being straight and end up being the guys that all the girls flock to, leaving all the normal, nice guys like me without any chicks.  it's a fuckin conspiracy, i swear.  that's why all the fine girls are going out with guys that are faggots.  no really.  everytime i like a girl, the dude that she ends up choosing is usually a faggot ass buster that's got bad taste and doesn't really have a clue as to what manhood is really all about.  it's not just about buying girls nice gifts and opening their car door when they hop into your car that you just got washed so that she wouldn't have to ride around in a dusty bucket.  no way.  manhood is about telling that girl, you ain't getting no gifts.  who says that i have to buy you shit just because you have an innate tendancy to consume a bunch of useless crap?  and, i don't have to clean my room or wash my car for anybody.  nope.  if you don't like it, then you better start dating some faggot that does care about shit like that.  you see what i'm saying?  i have nothing against gay dudes, i just have to say, you need to stop going after the hot chicks.  that's all i'm saying.  i know what i'm talking about.  and it's not just the pain of being lonely and the anger speaking.  this is real wisdom coming from Mr. Ed's mouth.  fuck.

						   Two more weeks of school and then I'm free at last.  I'll have two weeks of vacation until it's time to go back to summer school.  I'm going to be going to school five days a week during the summer though.  I have to take Health Science, Business Statistics, and three PE courses.  I'm taking Weight Lifting, Athletic fitness, and Jujitsu.  At least I'll have my AA degree once summer school is done with.  I'll have my music to keep me sane, so it's cool.  I might go camping, but I don't know if that's for sure.  My physiology wasn't built for nature.  I'm afraid of getting lost in the woods like what happened to me when I was a kid.  I think that happened a couple of times.  If there's no refridgerator, air conditioning, microwave oven, or in-n-out burgers around then it's not going to be a very comfortable experience I think.  Oh, don't forget the wireless internet also.  Living without computers is boring.  Time goes by so slowly.  My laptop is like a part of me.  I am starting to grow attached to this laptop.  Not just because it performs almost flawlessly in everything it does.  But, I also am into this whole wireless internet thing now and it's crazy.  i had a hell of a time setting up the WEP shit.  but, now I have 54mpbs of wireless network.  yay.  I bring this laptop with me everywhere I go.  If I didn't bring it along, then I feel as though a part of me were missing.  That's how I know that I'm a real geek.  No really.  If I met a really hot chick and she told me to either choose between her and my laptop, I'd honestly probably have to choose my laptop.  Because that chick wouldn't help me do my homework or make my music.  That sounds geeky, but it's true.  So true.

						   I've worked more on the  urlLink song   I'm happy with the way that it's coming out so far.  Since I have this analog filter, it made my drums sound pretty crazy.  The song is going to take a bit of time.  It's not exactly where I want it to be in terms of it's quality.  But, you won't be able to tell since the version i'm posting is at a lower resolution.  You can get a general idea of the mix though.  I'm going to keep cracking at what I have right now, then I'm going to add a lead and the bassline.  then the song will be complete and ready to put on the demo that I am working on.  i can't wait to get my synthesizer.  i hate software synthesizers.  they sound too cute.  i don't want the cute sound.  i want the hardware sound.  because it's rugged.  i'll get it soon.

						   Blogger got a Jenny Jones makeover.  That's pretty sick though.  I think the new blogger interface is pretty clean.  Anyway, i'm tired from school like a muthafucka.  I am still waiting for my synthesizer to come into the Guitar Center.  It's been about two weeks and no synth yet.  Oh well.  It'll come in due time when I really need it.  The thing is, I really don't have much work that I have to do besides one final test that I probably won't even study all that much for.  I need this synthesizer if I want to really pound out some songs that I'm going to actually sell.  The music I'm making with the software synths are "alright", but they're just that.  A lot of producers right now use softsynths, but I'm not like a lot of producers.  I'm differentiating myself from the rest of the electronic musicians out there by spending the extra thousands of dollars on hardware.  And it won't just apply to drum n bass songs.  I'll also make some hip hop tracks that will bang as well.  The thing that I'm mainly focusing on is creating my own original sound apart from other music.  So, I stay away from the radio.  I don't want to hear what the Neptunes, Kanye West, or Lil Jon is doing.  The last thing I want anybody to say is that the music I'm creating sounds like ...  Nah, that's just wack.  I'm on some futuristic techno shit anyway.  Even if I make a hip hop beat, it's gonna have the electronic feel to it because I'm doing what I know.  If you play the saxaphone and guitar and want to make a hip hop beat using those instruments, more power to you.  The only thing I despise is when musicians underestimate electronic instruments and dismiss them as not being "real" instruments because the sound that's created is generated by a machine.  My rebuttal for this opinion that some people take is that electronic instruments lift off a lot of limitations which traditional instruments used to place upon musicians.  That's not to convince people to use electronic instruments though.  I just want people to respect the computer and synthesizer as a legitimate instrument of music creation.  Electronic music allows a musician to create and model their own sounds after a sound which they imagine or conjure up within their mind.  If you pick up a guitar, it's just going to sound like a guitar.  The timbre might change if you play it inside of a tunnel or a hallway, but it's still a guitar.  On the other hand, the timbre of any electronic instrument can be manipulated by the turn of a knob on a synthesizer or a mouse-click.  This to me is nice in the sense that I can express myself in many ways with the instruments which I choose to use.  The only limitations which I find myself facing as a musician is human nature.  I'm limited by my own nature and since my imperfections exist, I'm limited.  These limitations also exist in machines and computers as well.  Although theoretically machines are modeled to execute commands flawlessly, they do not since they are creations of humans who are imperfect.  This nature of imperfection is part of the beauty of music, but ironically, our minds are two dimensional since we wish everything was symmetric and that our two dimensions of thinking are flush when held in comparison.  I embrace machines and computers.  I don't think of machines and computers as our enemies and i don't feel threatened by them.  I think that if machines were spread throughout the world and not abused by humans like they are now, that they could be used to enhance life in many positive ways.  I wish that machines weren't just used by those more fortunate and that they didn't create such a big gap between humans.  I don't think that because I know how to use a computer that I'm any better than anyone else.  Some people do feel this way and I think that that's a very negative way to think because knowing how to use computers really well is more like a gift and a blessing than it is a badge of superiority.  I see a future in this world that is going to be amazing in the way that everyone is going to communicate on this level that's going to break down a lot of the barriers between us.  I think as technology improves and evolves, so will our means of communicating between each other.  Take the blog for instance, it's created a bunch of electronic communities all over.  There's circles all around the world of people linked to each other's blogs, reading each other's blogs, and sharing experiences that wouldn't be possible at all if it weren't for computers.  I mean, this world is such a small place if you really think about it.  It's just the greed, hatred, suffering, and other demons that make us feel like it's bigger than it really is.  I can't wait until I get my synthesizer.  Because I see myself as a superhero.  The synthesizer is like my super powers against evil archenemies like the police officers and highway patrol.  I want to destroy them all with the bassline of pure analog bliss.  Zap them all away and make them turn into cockroaches.  I'm nuts.

						   This song messes up at one point because I did a software rendering of the mix, meaning, the computer spit this mix out in about 30 seconds.  Peep the song though.  New song.  Titled " urlLink Let Me Fall "  Still in progress.  I started this one on Thursday.  Damn, where's my synthesizer when I need it?  Oh well.  I'm not trying to brag or anything.  But, I ripped this track even with only software.  This just goes to show.  It's not what you use, but HOW you use it.  =)  Take that from Mr. Ed's grill, y'all.  ONE LOVE

						   I just looked at the stuff I posted half a year ago in January.  Wow.  I learned so much since then.  I was thinking about getting a Roland Fantom X then.  I would still get one of those if I had the money.  =(  Anyway, I just wanted to say that I'm a complete idiot.  Thanks for listening.  I feel a lot better now.

						   NOOOOOO!!  My Access Virus hasn't arrived at the Guitar Center yet.  Those flabbergasted fraggin flangin German Waldorfian cunts!!  I spend a thousand bucks of my hard earned financial aid money and this is the respect that I get?  Shoot.  They're lucky if I don't shove a fist up their ass!  Wait, I take that back.  They might actually enjoy that and not give me my synthesizer on purpose so that I do that repeatedly until they want to bear and breast feed my children.  I'm actually not that upset.  WHY?  Because I have a final project that I need to complete.  My music theory class is the hardest class on the planet.  Two concert reviews.  700 minutes logged on this computer program Practica Musica.  A composed song.  What else?  Hmm..  That's about it.  But that's a lot of fuckin work just for one class.  Then I got my film class.  The exam for that is going to be pretty difficult.  Oh well.  I have a feeling that my GPA isn't going to be too shitty.  I mean, what's a college degree really about?  Is it about the shit that you learn while in school or about the fact that you suffered for four years and sacraficed your time and whatnot so that you could prove that you are capable of earning a living within the "real" world.  Whatever that is.  I'll tell you what the real world is.  I know, I started talking about my synth and now I'm breaking down my philosophy on life again.  Well, it's 11:30 and I'm home on a Friday night and I have nothing better to do.  You're reading up to this point, so do you have anything better to do?  Read on, reader and I shall write on.  Right on.  Anyway, the real world, metaphorically, is like a big voyueristic, sadistic, sadomasochistic, sodomizing, corporate down-sizing, confused and never realizing, ignorant, belligerent, militant, fake and phony, must be bologne, wearing Abercrombie and Fitch, like a high school teenager, life's a BITCH!!!  Who am I to pass this judgement?  I don't know.  This is just the way that I feel.  Can I fart on your head?  Thanks.

						   I caught that shit that's going around.  Damn.  I think it's because I have been too busy to go to the gym.  Or maybe I've been making excuses.  Maybe it's a little bit of both.  All I know is that my Nyquil needs to kick in soon if I'm going to get any sleep tonight.  Shit.  I'm nuts yo.  i can't help it.  anyway i hope that i get my synth tomorrow.  it better come in tomorrow or i'll be dissappointed.

						   Have I shown you the Virus Classic yet?      I should be getting this by Friday this week!!  I've been waiting about two weeks for it.  This synth is basically a remanufacture of the last generation of Virus synths.  The latest one out is a Virus C.  The Classic is basically a Virus B with different sounds.  The hardware is pretty the same as the Virus B though.  The difference in cost from a Virus Classic and a Virus C is about $400.  It's definitely worth the extra $400 to get the Virus C over the Virus Classic.  But, I don't think that the difference is too drastic to where the Classic is a crappy synthesizer compared to the Virus C.  The Virus C has 32-voice polyphony whereas the Virus Classic has 24-voice polyphony.  8 voices is a big difference, but not too crazy.  Most virtual analog synths go from being around 8-voice to 24-voice.  The 32-voice Virus C is an exceptionally high performance virtual analog synthesizer.  It's won many awards for being the best.  The Virus B (or Classic) has also won awards back in 2001 and 2002.  The monster synthesizer that I'm still waiting to get which is the Andromeda A6 is different because it's a pure analog synthesizer.  It has 16-voices.  So, it has a lot less voices than the Classic and the Virus C, but at the same time, the sounds that it creates sound so rich and full, that it's enough to produce some hot tracks that are going to really make me stand out from other producers.  You've heard of the Crystal Method, BT, Jamiroquai, Paul Oakenfold, and DJ Tiesto maybe.  They all have used the Andromeda on their latest productions.  The thing with Drum n Bass is that a lot of it is sample-based so sampling is a key element to drum n bass.  I like sampling a lot.  I think sampling is a great means of enabling an artist who's not formally trained in music to be able to create songs.  It frees an artist from having to conform to musical laws.  There's a lot of producers out there that don't know much about notes or scales and they are still able to make music and express themselves through sampling.  A lot of producers also compose music on a keyboard without formal music training as well.  I don't know if I am better at making music now than I was before.  I just know that I'm ready to take on a new challenge with the music that I am creating.  This Access Virus Classic is going to definitely let me stretch my limits.  I don't know if I'll be able to use this synth to it's full potential.  It has over 80 effects on it and is able to hold 1024 sounds in it's memory.  That's not including the two filters per 16 voices that's on the panel.  But, I remember feeling this same way when I was entering music theory.  I wasn't sure if I had what it took to make it through the class, but I told myself, even if it gets hard just don't think about it as being difficult, think about it like it's non-existent.  But, I sat through it.  People dropped out, but I stayed.  I got my knowledge, but I'm still stupid in music theory compared to these virtuoso type muthafuckas that think so much about composition that their hair is sticking up like there's a bunch of static electricity in their fro.  But, you know what?  Even though these guys can compose a minuet or whatever the fuck.  They can't make a song that can make a kid get up and dance.  They could study drum n bass or hip hop, but would they really be able to recreate it the way that it's made by someone who's been living the hip hop experience for a whole lifetime?  In my speech class today, this kid gave a persuasive speech on classical music and he didn't even try to persuade anyone to do anything.  He more like lectured about how classical music was created to uplift humanity and how popular music today is generally destructive.  But, the generalization of saying all classical music was made to uplift humanity and that all popular music today is destructive against society is a distorted view.  I got into a debate with this kid about music and he just had no clue as to what he was talking about.  Don't you hate people that jump from one topic to another and can't debate on a single topic and it seems like they're dodging the fact that they can't make a strong argument?  I'm not a debate team geek or anything.  But, I had his ass on that debate.  All music, whether it's death metal or country rap, is made to uplift the human spirit.  It may not uplift all those that listen, but for every musician there is someone that appreciates what they do.  I don't know why that's so hard to understand.  The ideologies that come across through the music which is being heard isn't necessarily directly associated with this connection between the listener and the music.  The emotion that is awaken when the sound is heard is something that exists within the moment.  The interpretation proceeds that and each individual interprets music in different contexts.  But, you know, you see this a lot.  These classical music people that think that they're better than the rest of the world just because they listen to classical music.  That doesn't make them classy just because they listen to classical music.  Class, I think, is defined in terms of how one treats others.  And being classy doesn't mean to take an elitist and ethnocentrical view upon the world surrounding them.  Being classy, to me, is being non-judgemental and taking a more humanitarian approach towards treating others.  This defines the level of civilization or class, I think.  Anyway, I gotta get this synthesizer so I can rip these wannabes new assholes.  Just because they think classical music is what music is all about doesn't mean shit.  I like classical music, but I also like heavy metal music.  I am going to create this techno shit that's going to rock though.  Beyond anything that's imaginable probably.  I have issues and I have to let them go through the music.  Sorry, world.  I am just doing what I can to survive without feeling like a piece of garbage.  haha.

						   click  urlLink here   all i have to do is edit a couple of things out.  i fucked up on the mix.  =/  but, it's basically what it's going to be.  i know exactly what to fix on it.  i should've done it, but i let it slip past me.  this song is most likely going to be trashed.  it's just practice, you can say.  the song is titled "Catching Stars"

						   school is ending.  fo shizzle.  next week i'm starting my vacation.  i can't believe it.  i made it through another muthafuckin semester.  only one final test to worry about and i'm home free.  now all i gotta do is meet a nice female with her own apartment, move into her pad, and move out when the fall comes so i can go back to school.  life never goes the way i want it to though.  i have these little fantasies in my mind and it never turns out the way that i fantasize.  but, that's just how it is.  no one gets what they really really want.  or do they?  i watch movies and shit.  movies are fucked up.  the dorky guy ends up getting the popular girl because they realize the truth behind superficiality and whatnot.  that's fuckin bullshit.  in real life, shit never ever ever turns out like that.  people are fake as fuck and nobody gives a shit about each other.  get real.  i should start directing some fuckin indie films about real life.  you see, the story plot would be like this.  you're free to steal it if you're a script writer or whatever.  there's this guy that hasn't gotten laid for about two years.  he meets this girl, but she's so narcassistic.  all she can think about is how she has to lose weight and look like someone inside of a vogue or cosmopolitan magazine.  she hasn't gotten laid for a while too, but not as long as the dude hasn't.  ok, so after they meet, they get deep into conversations, but they never talk about their past relationships or their interest in each other.  and this continues on for what seems like forever into about 60% into the movie.  about to when the audience feels fed up like, "damn, do something you fuckin morons."  then, finally, the guy ends up telling the girl that he's interested in her.  the girl tells the guy that she just wants to be friends.  he's cool with that.  but, secretly, he plots a way to destroy her by spreading a rumor that she has hemmroids and that she's into S&M as well as beastiality.  it turns out, in reality, that's the reason why she told him that she wanted to be friends because she does have hemmroids and some kinky fetishes.  (we're talking about the harsh reality of real reality, not Hollywood or TV reality)  so she goes up to the dude and asks him if he was spying on her because he knew that she was into all that stuff.  he says no, he made it up as a rumor to sabotage her socially.  she doesn't admit that she's into all that stuff or that she has hemmroids.  she instead apologizes because she realizes that he said those things since she upset him.  and then they get together.  but, in the closing scene, she's writing an e-mail to everyone that they both know, trying to sabotage him socially as payback.  you see, the underlying themes of humiliation, passive-agressive behavior, secrets & lies, immoral fornication, and revenge is like what this movie would be all about.  the only thing is that the underlying themes wouldn't be so underlying like they are in movies made commercially.  i think i could slip a coke advertisement into the background.  a dorito vending machine into a romance scene.  or a TV playing a Irish Spring commercial while the guy checks into a hotel room and is talking to the front desk attendant; those front desk guys are always watching TV.  Hey, that's what selling entertainment is all about.  I could even design my own horror movie characters.  Something way scarier than Jason or Freddy.  This character would be androgenous.  What's more scarier than an androgenous character without any real differentiation of sex?  It would be around 5 foot 9 and use anything as a weapon.  It would have a face that's effeminate, but at the same time sort of tough like a Calvin Klein model sort of.  It would wear business suits and carry around an Apple PowerBook.  It's house would be decorated with only Ikea furniture.  ok, I'll stop.  This is getting too scary.  I am shaking while typing this.  i gotta get some sleep.

						   This made my day.  My bandmate Jon has a friend he used to work with at Tower Records who made some graphics for our group Code Breaker.  Now, this is isn't a joke at all.  This is really what the guy made for us.      Could you just imagine us doing a show with that logo being projected onto a wall?  That would be some funny shit.  All the etards would be like, Yo, you guys like got a skull with 3D eyes as your logo.  Yeah, our skulls has blue eyes, don't forget that, bitch.  It's the toughest, meanest skull on the West Coast.  One-Eyed Willy ain't got shit on our Code BRAKER skull.  hahaha.  That's the even funnier part.  The guy thought Breaker was spelled Braker.  Ah man.  I think I should be in charge of getting a logo for our band from now on.  Anyway, download the song again, from the link down there.  I added a bassline.  It makes the song getting very close to being complete.  still working on the part when the beat drops and the song builds back up to explode for the ending of the song.  i might have to add a crash or something.  anyway peep it.  One love.

						   It's getting close to wrapping this song up.  All I have to do is work on the breaks and the mix of the drums a little more.  But, you can see what the Virus is all about on this song.  I added two sounds from the Virus.  It made the song sound the way that I wanted to.  There's a lot more feeling in the song now because I added one sound that made it complete.  I didn't want to add anything because that would've over done it.  I already laid down some tight shit with the soft synths earlier.  So, after two weeks, I've got a decent track.  I changed the title from Let Me Fall to Break My Heart.  Why?  Because I want to get my heart broken.  That's why!  DUH  Haha.  Anyway, click  urlLink here  to download the latest stream.  Peace and one love.  I hope you enjoy listening to this song as much as I enjoyed making it.

						   This song is titled "Buddy".  Click  urlLink here  to listen to it.  It's a beat I made, lyrics I wrote, recorded in my bedroom, mixed by me.  it's a song that's made 100% by me.  i made this song for my friend diane because she's my buddy.  the point of the song i'm trying to make is that you can't beat having a buddy.  you can have boyfriends and date guys, but it's just not the same as a buddy.  so, this one is dedicated to all the girls out there with guys that treat them like crap and buddies that they count on to remind them that not all guys out there are insecure and inconsiderate and take out their shortcomings on others around them.  the message i'm trying to send to my friend diane though is that, she doesn't have to depend on any guy to validate her as a woman because even though we live in a patriarchal society that's male dominated with a lot of guys that think the world revolves around them, she should search inside of herself to find love versus searching for that feeling with guys that don't know the meaning of love.  and i owe her a lot for lifting me up when i needed it.  this song was the least i could do for her.  i didn't make it because i'm in love with her or anything, so don't even think it's like that.  and i'm not getting defensive.

						   Yeah.  School's out and I'm on vacation finally.  After all of these finals and shit, I feel like my mind and soul are disattached from the world and reality.  I also have a stinkin cold when it's hot as hell outside.  I don't get it.  Isn't this shit supposed to be happening during the wintertime?  Anyway, I'm happy that school's out.  I got to sit down with my Virus and go over some music tutorials and program sounds.  The Virus Classic is a legitimate synth I must say.  It's missing an Equalizer that comes on the Virus C and doesn't have the same modulation capabilities in it's low frequency oscillators, but it still sounds pretty good.  I know, shut up about your stupid stinkin synthesizer that nobody gives a bumb's ass about.  I'm just writing all this crap down because I know that a year from now I'm going to look back at this blog and say, God, I was such an idiot when I first got that Virus!!  I'll be surprised if I'm even using the Virus Classic a year from now.  Why?  Because I'm going to have an Andromeda A6, muthafuckas.  Nah, the Virus is still going to be really useful because it's got unique sounds on it.  I think it sounds better than a lot of digital keyboards out there.  For making the kind of music that I make, this synthesizer is what I prefer.  And even for the hip hop beats that I make, I want to make it sound innovative.  Because, afterall, we are living in the future right now as I write this.  This is the futuristic world right now.  I want to make music that makes the listener feel like they're living in a world full of robots and laser beams.  Psychadelic astronaut pimp shit that everyone can enjoy.  Geeks.  Gangstas.  Grandparents.  Girls.  Guys.  even ... Gay people.  All the G's shall unite under my mind-altering electronic compositions.  I'm going to try and learn about how to manipulate brain chemicals using sound.  That's my goal in life.  To create a sound that alters minds like drugs do.  The trick is to do it very subtly so that the listener has no clue that they're under my control.  And this power shall be used for good purposes of course.  I pray and ask God to give me the strength and guidance.  I don't ask for a lot of money from making music.  I just ask that I can be heard someday and that I can make music for a living.  And on my end, I'm going to push myself to learn all this stuff and master it all.  Because 90% of success is hard work.  The other 10% is miracles.  I believe in miracles though.  I completed 18 units (6 classes) again this semester.  I'll have to see my report card, but if I didn't get any C's this semester then I'll consider that a fuckin miracle because I could swear that I might get a C in my film class.  Anyway, if I can be on my way to going to a university, then why can't I make it in this music business?  There's a lot of truly talented people though.  But, the key is specializing in doing something.  I've found that by keeping knowledge very specific and minimizing it to where I can specialize in certain areas, I can ensure more success than trying to learn too much and scattering my knowledge through different areas.  Because something may not pertain to what I want to do.  Like for instance, I signed up for a web design class.  That's for my band promotion.  I don't know if it's a good choice though.  and object oriented computer programming may not be a wise choice maybe?  but, actually it is because it has a lot of long term potential which is out there for sound designers.  anyway, my point is.  I have to focus on learning on how to create sound.  If I can master synthesizing the way that I desire to right now, then I'm set.  Engineering is just as complicated.  I think both of these things take experience.  I need about a year or so to really get this shit down.  But, until then, I have a demo CD to make by the end of the summer.  I'm going to settle with what I can do for now and learn as I go.  I feel confident enough to put my music on a CD and sell it for an honest buck.  As much work as I'd put towards learning on how to produce music, mix it, and get it on a means to make money off of it, I don't feel that making a living off of it is asking for too much.  People ask me when my next show is going to be and all I can say it, "we're writing new songs."  I have one song that I'm still working on.  my friend jon has one song he's working on.  we're trying to bring our production up to a professional level as fast as we can without making ourselves trip over our own steps.  it's contraversial who makes better music between us.  of course, we both think that our own songs sound better than the other person, but we come to mutual agreements most of the time on what needs to be done to songs so that they're up to par with what we're competing against.  there's a lot of drum n bass out there.  even though it's underground, there's still a shitload of people out there producing drum n bass and a lot of fans of drum n bass are musically snobby.  i don't really care about the snobs though.  i am really trying to create a sound, like i said, that will expand the genre versus cater to a specific sub-culture of the drum n bass collective.  it's not easy being a new artist though.  i'm going to have to come out swinging really hard and making music that grabs people's attention.  so, i'm going to really have to think about what i'm going to put in my songs so that i can keep people's attention for a whole entire song without them turning it off.  i have the attention span of a monkey, so if I can listen to an entire song, it's probably decent.  i got some tricks up my sleeve.  i have these dreams of what i want my music to sound like.  and i'll make those dreams come true.  within this lifetime.

						   i figured out my technical issues.  Auxiliary BUS with the input set on the inputs that the Virus is plugged into!  DUH!  I'm fuckin retarded!  I don't swear to God, but how could I be so dumb????  I must get it from my dad cause he's pretty retarded.  lol  nah, he's ok.  just nuts.  runs in the family though.

						   My Access Virus Classic is all that I expected.  The only problem is that I don't have time right now to do what I'd like to with it.  Since my mom isn't coming home for another week, I'm going to have to help out at the store until she gets back which won't be for another week.  But, I'll get a week after that until summer school starts.  I'll be sure to get acquainted with my Virus and "try" to pump out some sort of music.  The thing with sound synthesis is that it's pretty crazy.  I'm a little intimidated by the possiblities I'm faced against.  Because with so many different options to choose from when designing a sound, there's just a lot of chances of making something wack, I guess you can say.  But, I ain't wack, I'm just saying.  This piece of hardware is just making me realize that all of the music I've made up to this point is very simple.  These software synthesizers are just so easy to work with and they can be taken anywhere.  I still love these software synthesizers.  I mean, there's a reason why they're putting hardware out of business, but they don't come as nearly as close in sound.  You'll be able to tell once I add more sounds to my latest song what the difference is right away.  I'll continue working on that "Let Me Fall" song, but I'll think of a better title.  Maybe "Pieces of Heart" or something.  I don't know.  I just know that I gotta figure out how to work with all this MIDI shit.  Good thing I'm a geek when it comes to computer programs.  It takes a lot of fuckin patience, I'll tell you that.  Fuckin MIDI.  MIDI is a piece of shit.  I hate it.  Why can synthesizers communicate wirelessly with computer sequencers?  They already make synthesizers with pentium 4 chips built inside of them.  They cost about $3,500.  If I was gonna spend that much on a synthesizer, I'd at least want it to come with wireless or Bluetooth or something like that.  They'll come up with wireless MIDI, they have to.  MIDI is from the 80's and shit.  It's about time for some new shit so that I don't have to deal with all of this signal routing and channel bussing whatever the fuck you call it.  I just want to make some fuckin music!  That's it and that's all!  I spend half of my time hooking everything up and trying to learn how to make it work rather than actually working with it!  How fucked up is that?  The Virus is going to obey me though.  I am it's master.  And this is the reason why you see twenty thousand people gathered in one place to listen to electronic music and celebrate life while listening to it.  Because electronic music is like what the old ass wooden violins and pianos were back in the days.  People used to live inside of wood and the whole world was made of like wood and stones and shit.  Literally, they probably used shit to hold their houses together in place so the rain wouldn't tear it down.  Back in the Baroque era or whatever the fuck you call it.  It only makes sense and the masses are attracted to music create by metal and silicon.  Futuristic grimey music is what it's all about.  I'm going to try and out do every single musician out there.  That's my only goal in life.  To battle every musician on the face of the earth.  With my American blood and fucked up Korean mentality, the world is at my mercy already.  I just gotta figure out how to efficiently use my synthesizer with my recording program.  hehe.  I am experiencing technical difficulties for the time being.  =(

						   Virus Classic.  You know, on the way home.  I shed a tear because I was overwhelmed with joy.  I'm not even kidding.  This synthesizer is more than I had imagined.  To actually own it, it's like a dream come true.  The funny thing is.  I just finished my music theory class today.  And my Virus came the same exact day I completed music theory class.  Life is just funny like that.  God must have known.  Hey, I guess he knows what he's doing, so I'll give him the synth today since he actually stuck in there.  Hell yeah, i fuckin stuck in there.  I think I did better in that class than a lot of the other students.  But, I'm glad to be done with that class.  It was definitely the toughest one out of all my six classes this semester.  But, it was also the one that was most worthwhile even though it's not going to be on my transcript for when i go to sfsu.  i really wanted to choke this band geek that was in my class.  he had a really fucked up attitude.  i think it's because he looks like a gayer version of kermit the frog and probably is still a virgin.  he didn't get lucky at bandcamp i guess.  Fuck it!  I'm not going to get a chance to sit down with my Virus and work on anything for another couple of days.  I'll squeeze in some time to work on music.  I have to or I'll lose my mind.  I mean, it's 2:30AM.  I have two finals tomorrow and I haven't gotten any studying done at all.  But, I can't give a fuck because community college is a fuckin joke.  I love it, don't get me wrong.  But, it's really easy.  I might not get all A's and B's like last semester, but I'll swing B's and C's for sure.  No D's.  Haha.  Maybe I'll get a D in my piano class since I missed about four classes.  Oh well.  fuck it.  Summer vacation's here.  I get to spend it working at my parent's store.  I better smoke a lot of weed so that I can at least take a trip without leaving the house.  I'll try and pump out a weed induced song also.  but, usually that shit just comes out sounding super corny.  Sobriety is the only way to really fly I think.  Does that sound conservative?  Maybe I'm growing up and I don't even know it. o_O

						   Yaya.  I get to spend my summer vacation working at my parent's store and going to summer school.  What more could I ask for?  An Access Virus Classic would be nice.  But, that's too much to ask for.  I mean, having a boring life and wanting a piece of music hardware to make time pass by would just make me spoiled rotten and unappreciative.  I am a spoiled bastard though.  I'm not too self-righteous to admit that.  I'm not as spoiled as I'd like to be, but nevertheless, I get what I want.  Besides chicks of course.  I hope I get my synth this week.  At least by the end of the week.  I'll get it.  I'm sure I will.  Tomorrow, I'm on a mission to call that distributor and be like, "hey dude, where is it?  I've been waiting for two god damn weeks, you stinkin German fuck!"  haha.  nah, i wouldn't say that.  but, anybody want to battle me after i get this Virus, it's on.  I'm going to snack on producers.  Bite their heads off like gummy bears.  ARGH.  =)

						   More work done on the latest song.  There's a link to the audio stream below this post.  I hope y'all enjoy listening as much as I enjoyed making it.  These little tweaks that I do in the songs aren't really ideas.  They're more like dreams.  I had a dream of making that lead sound (over the bass) that sounds like a bunch of bleeps over the bass.  As far as the vocals.  I didn't plan on using the theme of falling in love and getting the heart broken.  That just happened as I was flipping through which vocal samples to use.  I added this female vocal saying "just dont break my heart" then i flip it to where she says "just break my heart".  then, the other female vocal singing "let me fall" comes in.  it's the process i go through when i fall in love.  first, i'm afraid.  then, i'm like, fuck it.  then, i fall.  so, that's just the thought i put into making the song.  it's meaningful to me at least.  i don't know how others will interpret the artistry i put forth behind the music.  the song skips a little bit at the end.  it's because there's some bugs with using Nuendo and Reason when it's being exported through software rendering versus doing real-time recording.  I'm just going to keep posting the quick mixes rather than doing real-time mixes because i don't wanna wait around for six minutes while the song mixes down in real-time.  Fortunately, these issues with Reason don't come up in Pro Tools, so when I'm all ready to really make this song sound super clean, I can deliver something solid when I get down on Pro Tools.  I've been mostly doing this work with my earphones as well.  I did the major work with my studio monitors though.  most of the composing has been done on the monitors.  but, the sequencing and tweaking is mostly done with my reference headphones.  I'm digging this song though.  I think this one's going to go on the demo possibly.  This song I'm feeling more than the last one.  There's more work that needs to be done though.  The drums will have to be sequenced more intricately and a couple more instruments need to be added.  I have to work with effecting the chorus vocals also.  It's sounding clean so far though.  I am actually surprised at how clean it is coming out.  Drum n Bass right in front a ya face!  Bombaclat!

						   I am stoked.  That's white boy talk for excited.  I have a pretty exciting week ahead of me.  I start my internship at Asphodel.  I'll be learning how to use MaxMSP there.  It's this digital audio programming shit that's really hard to learn and some places charge over three thousand bucks to learn it.  The thing is, I'm going to be learning it from the guy that the girl I like used to sorta date.  But, this dude was a lame so she stopped messing with him since he tried to pull some funny shit on her.  So, hopefully it'll work out even though I hang out with this girl that dissed him.  Even though he was the one that let her slip from his game.  I think it'll be pretty funny if i end up hooking up with her and learning how to use MaxMSP from him also.  It would be like leverage I guess?  I dunno.  But, the reason why he was holding back on this girl was because it seems like he's so deep into his music thing that he can't dedicate any of his time to a girl.  That's funny because I am pretty dedicated to my music, but I could definitely make time in my schedule for the ladies.  Man, being all about work and having no play is no way to live.  That's how guys go bald, get cancer, and end up dating girls off of craigslist.  I ain't going out like that.  No way.  I got this girl that I really am interested in getting to know and I was pretty straight forward in letting her know that I think she's super duper bootytastic and that if I was dude, I wouldn't have let her out of my sight.  If I were that dude, the minute that she told me that I was trying to pull some games on her, I would've went to the flower shop, bought the most expensive flowers there (besides roses), hired a guitar player, and then brought her the flowers and sang her some corny ass Backstreet Boys song.  hey, you gotta do what you gotta do.  It's pretty messed up how things worked out for this girl though.  She got her feelings hurt since this guy dissed her.  There are three things that are fundamental.  Honesty, Reciprocal Altruism, and Consideration.  That's the holy trinity to getting a nice girl.  You can't let all this rap music pimp talk fuck up your mind and make you feel like you're Snoop Dogg or something.  That's the problem with the world today.  Muthafuckas ain't Too Short or Snoop Dogg or 50 cent and they just have to understand that most of the world is just broke ass, exhausted, and fed up with the bullshit and that's including females.  Not just men.  I don't mean to sound like a feminist.  I'm just speaking my opinions.  My whole outlook is just way too futuristic I think.  I'm like way ahead of the time.  It's just ridiculous.

						   I have this recurring dream where I'm flying in the sky.  Above buildings, cars, people, etc.  Sometime's I'm butt naked while I'm flying, too.  This dream's really weird and I have it every week or two.  Now, this is another weird ass dream that I have sometimes.  I'm inside of this computer game Doom and I am scared out of my mind because I'm in Hell, like in the actual game.  I see the monsters like from Doom I and II and it's like real life.  The eyes and everything.  I see the red ball monster with all the eyes, the imps, the skulls on fire.  But, in this dream, I don't have any guns.  I see a shitload of potion everywhere though which is useless to me since I'm just constantly running away from these monsters.  And, I'll open this door and all of a sudden, everything I see turns into like psychadelic hippie vision.  Everything turns purple, yellow, orange, and pink.  These monsters still look scary as hell though.  I have also been having this recurring dream of the Alesis Andromeda A6.  In this dream, I own this synthesizer, only it's modified and has this tube light on it that lights up when I press down on a key.  I dream of making these really crazy sounds and then I'll wake up thinking I have an Andromeda, but I don't.  This dream sucks.  I've been having these dreams for a while now.  When I say a while, I mean, since I was like 18 maybe?  That's about six years.  When I used to have the dream where I was flying, I would be a vampire and I'd be hunting for human blood and flesh to eat.  Now, this doesn't happen anymore.  But, I used to dream that I was a vampire and I had this appetite to destroy humans by tearing them apart with my vampire powers.  Yea, I know.  I'm fuckin nuts.  Last night, I had the Doom dream though.  I was stuck on solving this puzzle to get out of where I was trapped.  I had to push this lever, go to another room and push a box into a wall, then when I went back outside, everything was different and I couldn't find the door to escape and I just totally forgot altogether where the fuck I was supposed to go.  The whole time, it doesn't occur to me that I'm dreaming.  Sometimes, I wake up in my dreams while I'm dreaming and I realize that I'm dreaming.  usually, when this is the case, I change the channel and surround myself with bikini girls on a beach island and a bunch of drinks with umbrellas in them.  I'm dead serious.  Or, if I'm not in the mood for that, I will say to myself, "If I'm dreaming, then I'll manifest a gun."  Then, a gun will manifest in my hand out of nowhere and I'll start shooting at anyone that I see like I'm in a video game, but it looks as real as life.  I forgot the term used for being able to do this.  But, it's really fun to control dreams.

						   My latest song.  Still in the works.  It has no bassline, it's just basically some drums and some little samples here and there.  I'm going to work in some other stuff as soon as I get some time to sit down and focus on it.  I like this nostalgic sound though.  It reminds me of the dayboring ass childhood sort of.

						   Sunday is my first day of Aikido class.  Fake ass Steven Segal martial art class is more like it.  What the fuck am I going to do with Aikido?  I think that's the martial art where you wait for somebody to kick your ass and then you take the energy that they're directing towards kicking your ass and you re-channel their energy into them kicking their own ass.  It's like when I used to tutor these kids and whenever one of them tried to hit me, I would take their hand and make them slap themselves on the face.  Hey, it's not child abuse if it's not your hand that committed the crime of kid slapping.  I'm working on this track right now.  It captures the sound that I'm feeling right now.  It's got this vintage, melancholy, fully grown, hip hoppish sound to it.  My latest drum n bass track.  This is one that I'm going to make lyrics for.  I think I'm going to make this song about traveling in the summer.  In my car.  Bipedal motion.  Commuting on the Bart.  Jet Blue.  Taking a trip and then coming back home.  It's the way songs are composed.  So, I'm going to try and right lyrics based on music theory.  I'm going to take the lyrics away from home like how music notes go away from the tonic note and then bring it back to home and tonic.  One Five Four One Four Five One Five Four One Four Five.  You know, the simple classical chord progression.  I should be using jazz progressions in different musical modes, but fuck it.  I'm using a lot of samples in this song, so I have no idea what key the samples were originally composed in.  So, I'm just guessing.  I don't have a bassline yet.  I do have some crazy ass breaks though.  Four layers of drum patterns.  that's a lot of drums.  28 drum samples.  it's a lot of shit going on at one time.  but that's what drum n bass is all about.  stretching the limits of sound via technology.  I'm trying to make some music that will impress the guys at this record label I'm trying to get an internship at.  I want these engineers to listen to my music and say, "he ain't no punk!"  that's right.  yo, righteously i shall shepard the weak with kindness and goodwill through the valley of darkness in the shadow of death.  those that which to attempt to poison and destroy my brethren will be struck down upon with great vengeance and furious anger.  and they shall know that his name is the LAWD.  Lawd have merseeey...  This life is taking me on a journey.  I hope that I can help with starting this program to help these underpriveliged kids out there in the hood.  I wanna see it take off.  If I could use my knowledge and help bring some good out of it through the youth, I think that's worth more than any Mercedes Benz or Gucci clothes.  The youth is the future and music will always carry on.  If I could influence the future of music in the ghettos of West Oakland, then I think that would be some shit that is beyond me.  I just had this vision of it.  The challenge.  The hurdles I have to jump over.  The loopholes I have to open with a glass cutter.  I have four business suits.  Yeah.  That's right.  Four business suits to make me look like I know what I'm actually talking about.  It doesn't take an education in this day and age.  It doesn't require any degree.  It takes the necktie and white collar and firm handshake.  That stare into a person's eyes like, "Fuck you.  This deal is mine.  You already lost."  If you don't have that, then forget it.  You already lost the negotiation.  This next year coming up is going to be a real challenge for me.  I'm facing the impossible once again.  This time, I'm moving up in the world.  SFSU.  Hmm.. I'm not going to ask the question if I'm ready for SFSU..  I don't think that SFSU is really ready for me.  As cocky as I am with all my little gadgets and gizmos.  I have all the computer software that every college student desires.  I have everyone's soul at my dispense.  But, I use my powers for good.  My knowledge and resources are available for everyone.  Even that strange kid in the class that nobody talks to because he smells funny.  I hope that I do get to that point where people do ask me how I did something though.  Right now, people just ask me which software I used.  I think that's like a "how did you do it?" question.  But, I want the day to come when someone asks me how I made a certain sound sound a certain way.  When you hear what I'm talking about, you'll know what I mean.  I find a great interest in psychoacoustics.  That's what I'm going to read more about soon in my book.  I want to get a thorough understanding of how the human mind interprets sound.  there's a way to control how music affects the listener.  Think about how Dr. Dre playing in a club makes certain females horny and want to fuck.  I want to use that same musical power to free the listener of consumerism and fear of mass destruction.  come on.  don't tell you have never thought about having more self-control and also being scared of dying from a nuclear bomb or some type of crazy shit like that.  that type of shit is not only burdensome and traumatic, but it also is the reason for why i do what i do.  so, i might as well fight for what i believe in and value.  i value freedom.  freedom is self-control.  freedom is having no fear.  freedom is what i want to give through music.  because music is what sets me free, i might as well share the feeling with anyone that's willing to listen.  good nite.

						   met someone..  Or.  I saw someone.  Good story.  Read on.  She's someone that I had a crush on when I was in the 9th grade.  I'd see her walking down the hallway and I'd think, "there she is. that girl."  but, she never noticed me.  she just stared straight ahead and kept on walking.  she appeared inside my house one day.  she became friends with my sister.  so, it's pretty funny how life works out.  everything turns out to be so ironic.  she messaged me on friendster and i messaged her back.  turns out, she's trying to start a program to teach music to unprivileged children in Oakland.  i told her that i make music and i want to help her get this program off the ground.  so, i see her in person.  she is like super amazing and i am like holy shit.  i can't believe that i am seeing her right before me.  looking all tasty like a Krispy Kreme Chocolate glazed cream filled donut.  Yes, that's how sweet she is.  she asks me if i want to go clubbing.  i say yes without thinking about it like i would miss a funeral or a barmitzfa to go clubbing with her.  we go and we talk non stop.  this conversation is flowing deep.  i am feeling that connection like i've actually met someone that has a brain that operates properly.  i meet her friends and it turns out.  her friend knows curtis roads.  Curtis Roads is the author of this book the Computer Music Tutorial.  This book is the only one of it's kind and services the electronic musician community as the bible.  Even the avante garde type muthafuckas use this book as a reference.  And, I meet this cat that knows Roads and doesn't call him Roads, he calls him Curtis nonchalantly like I'm just overreacting.  I never thought in my wildest imagination that I would ever be in connection to Curtis Roads, the Godfather of electronic music.  This guy doesn't just synthesize sound, he's found a way to break down a sound into molecules.  His latest book is titled Microsound.  So, I get home at 4am.  She leaves with my Puma sweatshirt.  she asked me to go to the SF MoMA with her.  I've always wanted to check out the MoMA, but had nobody interested in going with me.  It's just overwhelming.  The girl I had a crush on ten years ago knows these super genius virtuoso computer musicians and has opened up doors for me to enter and become a super genius also.  It's the stuff that dreams are made of.  like that song.  I am trying to not mess up this time.  She probably wants to just be friends since she's friends with my older sister.  But, I'm not afraid to try.  If I don't give this a shot then I will live the rest of my life feeling like such an ass.  It is against my nature to let any super intelligent, talented, compassionate, and beautiful woman to ever ever ask me to hang out and not ever try to get her to be my main squeeze.  If we can drink beer together, talk about Chopin, and do hip hop.  That's just weird.  And, I'm weird.  I'm just losing it again.  I can't lose it.  I shall pray.

						   I've been listening to my song and I'm not completely satisfied with it yet.  I need to make certain parts louder and the song is still missing one more instrument to make it build up with more intensity.  I went out to a club and listened to the songs the DJ's were spinning.  Man, these heads are gonna flip when I press my hits on vinyl.  I just have to keep on doing what I'm doing.  The pace I'm going right now is comfortable for me, so I'm not mad.  I am not frustrated like I was before.  Since I have my Virus now, I feel very content with what I'm making.  It's quality music production.  I'm building up experience and establishing the way I want my music to sound.  Originality is mainly what I'm trying to acheive.  Originality.  Yup.  I definitely am doing original stuff.  I know in my mind that what I do is definitely something that nobody else is doing.  Because the time that I put into making each sound be a sound that is something I've never heard and composing it to be more complex than just two different notes.  And also arranging everything else to work harmonically.  Man, it better fuckin be original.  If someone else ever sounds like me, I'm going to have to crush them.

I sent the part uninsured, so I don't know.  I hope that the place didn't jack me for my part.  I have to call the B of A now and get a claim form and do all this bullshit now.  Fuck.  All of this better be worth it.

						   Actually 3:59 as I am starting to write yet another Blog entry.  My third one of tonight or this morning.  I can't sleep after eating a whole entire pizza pie and drinking 3 sodas.  I think all of that pizza and caffeine is fuckin with me.  But, that was my last junkfood meal.  This time it is.  The reason why I rewarded myself with such a gluttonous endulgence is because I have quit smoking cigarettes.  I thought that I deserved it, so fuck it.  I ate a whole pizza pie.  There's probably kids in Iraq that would jump me, stab me, and kill me for a slice of pizza, but fuck it.  I don't feel guilty about it because I quit smoking cigarettes and that's something those kids in Iraq don't have the willpower to do.  Lil third graders smoking and shit.  I've seen them little third world country kids on TV, they're all fucked up.  The reason why I keep on writing down how I'm going to start healthy again is because I have this goal that I set out to reach a while ago and I need to follow through with reaching it.  I'll admit, I fell into a loophole when I started smoking those fuckin cigarettes again.  But, I've jumped over that hurdle.  I'm on my fifth day of quitting and I can't believe how quickly it's passed.  Time flies by faster when I am not smoking cigarettes and I get a lot more stuff done.  That's a good thing because life sucks.  The faster it passes, the better off I am.  Put me out of my misery as quick as possible.  I don't want to live forever and stick around this place for eternity.  If I were to die and then Jesus was like, "Hey Everybody!  Let's return to Paradise!  I've made Earth into a vacation resort!"  I would be like, "Yo, jesus, can you just send me to a place where I am like not around all of you happy faced retards? thanks."  Let's be honest.  Life's a bitch.  Not only is life a bitch.  But, it's a bitch that doesn't call you when she's going to cancel plans.  The bitch (life) just doesn't even warn you when she's going to pull some shady ass shit on you.  Is that not life?  That's my life.  That's why I'm scared.  That's why I'm afraid.  That's why I don't keep promises that I can't keep.  I try really hard to be honest.  But, I don't know if it's really worth it.  I fear mediocracy.  Did I spell that right?  Why should I be like everyone else and just lie and cheat and live in secrecy?  I have no secrets to hide.  The skeletons aren't hiding in my closet at all.  They're all scattered in bits and pieces all over the place.  Because I pour my heart out and try to get it all off of my chest, so that they don't haunt me.  But, I have these fears because I have these desires that I wish to obtain.  I ask God and I ask myself if I want the right thing.  If I'm asking for the right things from life.  The righteous path is one that's forsaken on all sides, so it's hard to really choose the right choice.  If my life were a key signature it would be Eb minor.  Or D minor.  I compose a lot of my music in those keys and people tell me that my songs sound sad.  Well, I'm not sad at all.  I am who I am.  Sad, happy, angry, painful, patient, and humble.  I'm all those things.  I wanna be heard and understood.  What I'm working on is my communication.  Getting these ideas across so precise that anyone can understand what I'm trying to get across.  I think I'll get the chance to be heard someday.  When I do get heard and people do understand that I'm not just promoting myself, I hope to make a difference somehow.  It doesn't have to be a huge difference.  But, if I can get one person to stop taking drugs or another person to pick up a book and try to learn how to read.  That's accomplishing something big to me.  It might not be shit to a lot of others though.  That's because the world we live in is all fucked up.  Sometimes, it's like nobody gives a fuck.  Everyone's in this shit for themselves.  I don't want to be like that.  That's a very lonely way to live I think.  To never really experience what it's like to give.  I gotta be more careful though.  Because, I feel like I get used all the time.  I need to start being more careful about being so kind I think.  damn.  4:37am.  I should try to sleep even though I'm wide awake.  fuck.  i need school to start so i can be normal again.

						   I am feeling a little bit better.  I've been stressed out these past few days because of something I wish not to talk about.  Haven't had a cigarette.  I'm proud of that.  Today, I ate my last pizza.  Sort of like Jesus and his last dinner.  This is my last pizza and then I will return to the life of a martyr.  I shall sacrafice all that is pleasurable in life for the greater good.  I will shepard the weak and lost with kindness and goodwill through the valley of darkness in the shadow of death.  That's my mission.  There's a girl that I saw in my Aikido class that I want to try and get to know also.  I hope that works out.  If I can hang out with this chick then that means that I'm a pimp.  No, seriously.  Even if she just gives me her phone number then that's going make my ego blow up by like a thousand times and I'm going to start thinking like a real egomaniac.  With the heart of a martyr of course.  I woke up and told myself, fuck it, you only live once.  So I saw this girl at school, blonde hair, green eyes, looking like the whitest white girl on the planet.  But half of her body was tattooed.  I was like, daaaamn, that's a hot ass white girl right there.  I walked up to her and spoke to her for a good while.  And I been trying to think about what to say to her to get her phone number.  I figured, I'll be seeing her for the next seven weeks, I'll have plenty of chances.  But, next week I'm a get that shit for sure.  So, what I'm going to do is just be absolutely honest.  I'm gonna tell her, you are so damn hot that you could make Satan quit his dayjob.  You are cuter than both of the Olson twins added up in cuteness.  You are the prettiest white girl in the New World Order.  It probably won't work, but life is too short.  It's not everyday you meet fine ass white girls from Bolivia that speak Spanish and have half of their body tattooed with dragons and shit.  And if I blow this shot, it's all good because I have four other classes at school to attend and I have a lot of other things coming up.  I'm moving up in the world.  I got this degree on the way.  I am gonna to help start this little workshop to teach kids how to be artistic.  And, I have this internship that's taking me places.  And, once I have a demo CD to push, I'll have music shows up the ass.  It would be nice to have a girl though.  Someone to call every ten or twenty minutes to use up my mobile-to-mobile minutes with.  That's pretty selfish to say.  Fuck it.  We're all selfish and inconsiderate.  I'm not, but I know everyone else is.

						   This summer is all fucked up.  The weather just stinks.  Why's it so god damn fuckin cold?  Three days without a single cigarette.  Cold turkey nicotine free.  How's it feel?  I feel like smoking a cigarette, but I might just be going through withdrawals or something else.  I see things a lot more clearly now though and I'm getting more stuff done without cigarettes.  Life feels different right now.  Since I am struggling so hard to use self-control, I feel very lonely since I am really depending on myself to get through quitting smoking.  This feeling is all temporary though.  I know so because I've had to endure through this everytime I've quit.  I am getting off of my medication within the next three weeks also.  I should be ok.  It gets harder and harder to quit smoking.  I think that this time I have to quit for good because I'm running out of chances.

						   I am in the works of a trance song.  Why not?  I thought about it and I have the skills to make a trance song definitely.  So I am making one called Henry's Hamster.  I have to admit, it's ten times easier than making a drum n bass track.  The drums are just so easy to program.  And the melodies are so easy to create as well.  I like making drum n bass more.  Producing trance doesn't seem as fulfilling for me right now.  With drum n bass, I feel as though I'm really pushing everything I know to it's limit.  Trance is basically like classical composing in terms of the progressions used and whatnot.  A lot of it is classical theory.  I like to go outside of that and do other stuff.  I made a trance song to see if i could make a decent trance song.  Just to see how easy it is.  I thought it was really easy.  Two hours and I have damn near the whole song.  I spend about three weeks on a drum n bass track and I'm still not happy with what I make.  Tomorrow I'm starting my internship at asphodel.  I hope this works out.  I hope that I can work this internship around my crazy school schedule.  I think I just might be able to if I take the Bart from Pleasant Hill to SF on Wednesdays.  Anyway, I'll post the trance song after I mix it.  Henry's Hamster.  This song is dedicated to quitting smoking.

						   Not one cigarette has been smoked by me today.  Not a single one!!  I'm taking this shit one day at a time because I want to quit for good.  This day hasn't been easy though.  I've been going damn near crazy.  Stress level is at 80% it's threshold.  But, I got some sick ass breaks on my song.  How I managed to do that, I have no clue.  I been taking the music thing one day at a time, too.  That's the big reason why I quit smoking too.  I was feeling lazy and didn't feel like going the extra step when making my songs.  That's a big problem to me because I want to give my music everything I've got.  with all the money i've spent on equipment, i can't waste time on getting more progress done.  cigarettes slow up the process of everything.  they cost a lot of money.  and they are just disgusting.  I am one step closer being back to where I was.  feels good.

						   I feel worn out like socks that have been worn for two days in a row.  I need to get back to where I was last summer.  Working out three to four times a week, eating right, no cigarettes.  I feel like I have fallen off of track and I really want to get back on.  Whatever happened to the six pack abs?  The cigarettes fucked me up.  Cigarettes are fucked up.  For those of you that have quit smoking and are reading this, don't ever start up again.  They will turn you into a disgusting person.  I feel like I am disgusting.  I can't breathe right.  I can't sleep right.  My thoughts are just clouded with smoke.  This poison inside of my body is making me feel this way, yet I don't quit because I think that somewhere deep inside of my subconscious mind, there's something telling me that I should keep on hurting myself.  Now that I think about it though, I don't think that I deserve to feel this shitty.  This is what's so fucked up.  If I quit smoking, I would be able to exercise more and feel less stress, and this would cause me to be able to have more self-control to eat better.  I guess I'm still a kid since I don't think far enough ahead.  I'm always so busy with being wrapped up in the moment with all of this shit happening.  Fuck.  I hate cigarettes.  They're my archenemy.  And the fucked up thing is that, when I have been feeling like something hasn't been right in the past few weeks, it never occurred to me that it was due to the cigarettes.  Addictions play tricks on me like that.  I find a way to let it slip past my mind by overlooking them with something else.  Justifying and reasoning the bullshit.  All I want is my self-control back.  I don't know where I lost it.  I pulled through this semester with good grades, but I'm not satisfied because I didn't do it perfectly like I wanted to.  I gave into smoking cigarettes again and I've been eating junk food for the past month.  I went over a year without junk food and cigarettes.  I can do it again.  I know what the problem was now that I think about it.  I think I embraced my false notion of success.  My little GPA had me thinking that I was doing all fine and dandy, so I let myself slip back into the old lifestyle.  Next thing you know, I'll be smoking pot and playing video games, ordering one pizza after the other, and ten years will fly by in the blink of an eye.  I promised myself that this will not be my destiny.  I wasn't put on this planet to live like a rodent.  A mouse inside of a maze chasing after a piece of shit disguised as cheese.  Fuck that.  I don't want to be like everyone else.  I don't want to be regular.  I don't want to be a number one extra value meal.  I don't want to feel "okay i guess".  I think I'm going to get on the patch again.  I need to get my shit together.  Starting tomorrow.  I'm throwing away my cigarettes.  I refuse to give them away this time.  They're going in the trashcan first thing when I wake up.  My mind's made.  No more french fries, no more pizza, and I'm going to eat my last burrito and then I'm going to eat my healthy soybean products and vegetables.  Maybe I'll supplement some diet soda in there if I feel like spoiling myself.  I have a lot of shit that I need to do and these cigarettes are fuckin it all up.  I give up.  Cigarettes have won this fight, but maybe I've beat them?  Well, I'm giving up the cigarettes and cigarettes don't really need me since there's probably three billion people that smoke.  And God knows I'll be reaching for that cigarette the next time I face some conflict within my life.  God, why do I have to be such a worm sometimes?  It's just cigarettes.  They're only the worst thing to happen to me since I've popped out of my mom's pussy.  Pray for me, please.  I need a miracle.  I need something to happen to keep me on the righteous path to make my dreams become life.  Fuck.

						   All I needed was a beat.  I was feeling down about some shit that was going on that I'd rather not write about, but it's all over.  I am back on my feet and running.  I'm back to being neurotic and hyperactive.  So, my bipolarity is on the positive side now.  Back to the drawing board to write new tracks.  I want to present all new shit for this show that's coming up in August.  I want to come out with a set that's just slamming and makes the show I had this past Tuesday look like nothing.  Performing is what it's all about.  It's addicting I think.  Not the attention, but the feeling of being heard.  Having the chance to share with other's what I love to do with my life.  I hope that the people listening feel that inspiration and change their lives in a positive way or something.

						   Does  urlLink this  sound better than  urlLink that ?   urlLink this  or  urlLink that ?   urlLink this  or  urlLink that ?   urlLink this  or  urlLink that ?   urlLink this  or  urlLink that ?  "That" is the one that I hope you chose because "that" is the one that I'm going to keep working on.  I basically cleared up some frequency space so that I can bring in the other sounds from "this" more louder and cleaner.  If you listen to the drums on "that", you'll notice a significant difference in the punch of the way it sounds.  It's depth is a lot more deeper and I took out the hi hats so that the "Code Breaker" vocal is a little bit more distinctive, but not too obvious.  That "Code Breaker" vocal sample is my own voice.  I been playing around all day and experimenting with new stuff since my last show because I have more of a feel what will get people moving on the dance floor.  We're due back at the Oasis on Saturday night probably.  They asked us to come back again.  So, there's a lot of stuff lined up and we've got our work cut out for us.  I'm really happy that I can get gigs right now even if I'm just playing at a small club, it's still better than working at a club where I don't get to put people on a guestlist and some free drinks on the house.  At least I receive some cool treatment at the Oasis.  My laptop has been running on overdrive these past couple of days.  These audio applications work the shit out of my CPU.  That's why I got an IBM with a four year warranty though.  I hope the CPU doesn't fry on me.  Nah, it should be alright.  I am going to get this cooler pad that cools the laptop by over 10 degrees Farenheit.  That will put me at ease.  It's $18.55 after a rebate and that's not bad.   urlLink check it out   For those of you with laptops out there, it might be helpful.

						   I am depressed like a mental patient right now.  Sometimes I feel like I belong in a padded room.  I should be happy though.  I got that show at that rave that I wanted.  I'm going to have the opportunity to perform in front of hundreds of people.  The attention means nothing to me though.  I made some pretty drastic changes with smoking and eating.  I should be taking a turn towards a more positive mood very soon since I did everything that I told myself that I was going to do.  No cigarettes, controlling my eating habits, and I'm making it to class on time without falling asleep during lectures.  Things will get better eventually at this rate.  Something's gotta happen.  I believe in miracles so there's got to be a miracle happening to me sooner or later since I'm working so hard.

						   I think I performed horribly.  I drank two cocktails and forgot my lyrics.  The songs that were played that I made sucked I think.  I'm not going to quit just yet because I'm still new to all of this.  It's only been a year actually I think.  No, less than a year.  But, I was horrible.  I wish that I had more time to prepare for the show at least.  That's life though.  Always catching me off guard.

						   I am harboring some resentment towards somebody, but I resent them so deeply that I'd rather not talk to them.  Have you ever been flaked on?  Like, someone has told you that they're going to do something for you and not even called you to tell you that they can't?  Well, I hate that flakey ass shit.  People that are flakes are hella retarded.  They deserve to be lonely and miserable like they already are.  Bastard ass bitches.

						   Can't sleep ...  All I can think about is bullshit.  I have some serious issues.  I know what my problem is.  Trust.  I have trouble trusting others.  And, this insecurity makes it hard for me to trust myself at times.  So, I should trust in my faith.  But, sometimes it's hard to have hope knowing that I only have control over a half of a percent of everything that's going to happen to me within this lifetime.  The thing is.  I consider myself a pretty giving person.  I find a lot of times that I feel as if I'm not receiving the same effort that I give to others in terms of reciprocation.  And this feeling of being done unfairly leads to me growing resentful towards people that I think are selfish.  A lot of people are hella selfish though.  It's just the way America has programmed us.  We're pumped out of school and trained to be competitive.  We have to score higher on tests when we're little children and this expectation to perform is still placed upon us all throughout our lives in one form of systematic way or another.  I don't think that social darwinism could be a lot more effective than what it is now.  Because, in terms of communication, humans have a lot of evolving to do compared to other species that exist on earth.  There's other primates that exhibit more sophisticated communication than we do and they don't even have the luxury of symbolically interacting with each other.  So, I'm a little disgruntled that people around me are upset about shit and they don't mean to let it rub off on me but it does.  It's like this.  Someone is angry, their anger rubs off on you, you might try to brush it off, but it's still there, and it ends up rubbing off on someone else.  I hate it when that person ends up being me.  I'm trying to do away with all that stress and anger.  It's just all bullshit.  I have been meeting more sophisticated people lately though.  But, some people I know have a long ways to go in terms of class and how they treat others.  And, also how they view themselves.  And, all of this greed is just unbearable sometimes.  I don't understand how some people can be so god damn fuckin greedy and needy.  Like little fuckin babies.  Shit, I have things that I desire.  But, I just want a keyboard and a nice girl to have conversations with.  That's not too much to ask for.  You have people that want so much, but at the same time, they're not entirely sure as to what they really want.  This bothers me because life is too short.  You gotta make up your mind otherwise you'll just be watching life pass you by like you're sitting in some movie theater seat and that shit happening on the silver screen is your life.  I'm not angry.  I just feel tension in the air.  People been getting on my nerves lately, that's what it is.  Something's just don't make no fuckin sense.  But, I stay up until 6 AM these days thinking about life.  The past, present, and future.  The faces I've met and that I see.  I try to figure things out.  Come up with reasons.  Then I think of suggestions.  I'm a problem solver.  That's how I view myself.  I see something wrong and I try to fix it.  But, sometimes it's all in my mind.  Sometimes I think something's broke when it doesn't need any fixing.  That's what wisdom is though.  To know the difference between what's real and what's not.  I guess I only know what feels right or good for me and I have these premonitions that are based upon a fucked up past life.  Serious issues I'm facing?  Maybe they're not so serious.  I guess I'm lucky to be living so humble.  Not everyone has the luxury of exploring their weaknesses.  Many are just too afraid to even imagine that they're weak in any way.  In God We Trust.  Sure, I guess.  good nite.

						   So, I got a show on Tuesday.  It came up on such short notice, but we took the gig.  We need the practice and the venue is a small place and on a Tuesday night, there's not going to be a huge crowd.  I'm excited because we've got a totally entire new set after a month and we get to play our new songs rather than the old ones.  So, it's pretty cool.  I have to sit down tomorrow when I wake up and work on these songs I already have.  I have three songs already and I need to get one more song and then that will have us set for our 45 minute set.  Damn, a forty five minute set?  We're already like one of the pros if we gotta go for that long.  It's good because we're forced to make this 45 minute set and with the songs we get, we'll put them on a demo CD and that will create more arbitrary opportunities for us.  I think we'll be doing our first rave in August.  We'll be doing a performance at an underground rave at a secret location.  So, that's going to be tight.  We'll be performing for the snobby ravers.  The ones that go to the "underground" parties.  I just hope that there's not too much drugs floating around because I don't like drugs as much as I used to.  I'm tolerable, but to a certain extent.  I used to do that shit a lot, so I'm not really going to be too judgemental because I know how hard it is to quit.  But, that's a part of the reason why I make rave music too.  Because it's not about the drugs.  The music is really about inspiration.  That's one of the things that sort of pisses me off.  One DnB producer I met was all coked up and asking me if I could score some weed.  And the kind of music he makes is just some hardcore type of music that you can listen to at a club, but it's not so much the kind of music that inspires me to do something good.  It's all good though.  You have people that do things for different reasons.  He may only desire to get his name known, some hoochies, and some drugs.  If that's what his mind is set on, then those are goals that are easily attainable without the music.  But, the producer was a total dick to my friend, so it just goes to show the level of musicianship he has for someone that's really interested in his music.  So, ultimately, my goal is to sort of battle the music that's floating around in the scene right now.  I pray that I get the guidance to make the right choices because there's still a lot of shit that has to be done.  But, I'm off to a start that's starting without me even really trying too hard.  I didn't put much effort to getting this gig.  They called us and asked us to perform.  I think that's just how I want it to be.  I don't want to perform somewhere by begging to get on.  That's not my style.  And we got this gig on our own without any agents involved.  I like to keep all the people involved to a minimum.  I'm pretty excited because things are working out okay.  I think so.

						   That's the title of my new song.  Why?  Because it mocks every single thing I can think of.  I will keep clinch it at 6 minutes.  But, my friend J Beezy said that the song made him feel like he was underwater.  So, I was like thinking, yeeah, you know, I have been feeling that way also lately.  Submerged under cold water.  All this song needs now is a sick ass lead sound and some effects from my virus.  Also, a better bass sound from the virus.  Hahaha.  Man, this song is just insanity.  I know I keep writing about it and I should just shut up already.  But, this song has brought me back to life.  That's the funny thing.  I don't know if I live to make music or if I make music to live.  Quote me on that.

If you saw what I used to make these songs of mine, you'd probably laugh.  I'll show you so that you can have a good laugh.      These are what I use.  Pretty strange, huh?  These earbuds come in a case.  They retail for about $330.  They're noise isolation earphones.  They almost eliminate all outside noise.  Well, they pretty much do when music is playing.  I hear pure music and it sounds superloud when it's not superloud, so it does less damage to the ears.  Those earphones plus ...      Equals quality sound.  I made this song with only my earphones which isn't good.  I just haven't had any time at all to sit down and really do some stuff with my mixing board and synthesizer.  This song is pretty insane though.  I am surprised actually by how good it is turning out so far.  I wasn't expecting to get to this level so quickly so I'm about 6 months ahead of schedule.  It's a beautiful thing.

						    urlLink Listen   You get the first listen since you visited this blog.  Everyone else has to wait until they see me performing or something.  This new laptop cooler I got is pretty fresh.  It even cools the keyboard surface on the laptop.  The left side of my laptop just gets stupid hot.  Since that's where the cpu is located.  These Centrino CPUs have an incompatability with my music applications also.  Windows thinks that the CPU is working at 100% capacity when it really isn't, so the laptop's internal fan will come on and it really sucks.  I think I'll call IBM and see if they can help me out.  Anyway, that's all I have to write for now.  I should go to the gym.

						   I think I might be manic depressive or bipolar.  I've been feeling real down.  There's a lot of stuff I should be happy about, but I'm not.  My ego is in the gutter.  I feel pretty insecure and low on the self-esteem.  I can't eat or sleep properly.  I don't have enough motivation to go to the gym.  Things are just upside down.  I want things to be back to the way they were when I was feeling happy.  I don't know what I have to do.  I should go to the gym and get some endorphins circulating through my bloodstream.  I'll do that tomorrow and document how it makes me feel.

I know, it's getting weirder and weirder as I learn more and more.  Don't be scared, it's only techno music.  I come in peace.  I only want to learn about your kind so I can return to my planet with proof of intelligent life on Earth.  So far...  I have a lot of explaining to do for my boss.  24 years I've spent searching without a single sign of intelligence.

Make sure you click NO when that pop-up shows up, ok?  I don't want anyone to get more e-mail spam than they already get, so I'm just trying to keep the awareness up there.  I got a second track I'm working on.  Click  urlLink here  to listen.  I don't have a name for it yet.  I am gonna make the bassline better.  But, I was mainly focusing on the mix of the drums.  They're sounding better I think.  I just gotta keep working at it.  Right now I'm trying out different techniques for sequencing my drums.  I used to solely use Reason, but now I'm seeing if there's a different way which sounds better and I think I've figured out a way that sounds better.

						   I woke up this morning sleeping on a hardwood floor next to two strangers.  I drank a bunch of stuff last night.  Five beers, some jagermeister, and some wild turkey.  I was laughing one second and the next thing I know I feel like I have a pinecone stuck inside of my cranium.  I got home around two o clock and I just woke up.  It's 2:45am.  Damn.  That's nuts.  Someone wrote me an email and it upset me.  You know, you can't really expect people to change.  I have always known this, but being optomistic and hopeful like I am, I've fallen to expecting the impossible from others.  Lately I've been feeling underappreciated and like I'm being taken for granted by others around me.  I don't like this feeling at all because it makes me very insecure and I end up seeing shit that's not really there.  I don't know.  I just have to keep on working at what I'm doing.  After I start making some money and getting some recognition for what I do, I'm sure I'll feel a lot better.  Anyway, I'm gonna sleep some more.

						   ... send me a Mackie HRS120.  I need a subwoofer now because all of my songs don't have good bass in the mixes.  This subwoofer costs about $1,000.  Well, at least my little list of things to get is sort of narrowing down.  I will have the subwoofer and andromeda a6 before the new year arrives.  I can't think of anything else that my music requires yet.  I have found a need for a subwoofer though.  It just happens to cost over a thousand bucks.  This investment probably isn't going to pay off with money in the near future.  Well, music isn't rewarded with money so that's ok.  I want subwoofer badly.  It has replaced my Andromeda on the priority list.  Subwoofer is now at the top of the list.  HRS120  Beautiful!

						   Music has been very good to me.  As far as my bandmates, that's a different story.  My experience with bands has reinforced my belief that nobody on the face of this earth should be trusted.  Being as blessed as I am, I try to shepard the weak through the valley of darkness in the shadow of death.  But, the weak are also prone to bite the hand that feeds them due to their greed and lack of compassion.  I admit my weaknesses, but I embrace them rather than deny they exist.  My partner Jon from Code Breaker told me today that I'm selfish. w He said he has a friend who needs to get their computer fixed and that this friend was willing to pay $100 and that "we" could split the money.  I was like, "We?"  I would be doing all of the work, so there is no "we" when it comes to working on his friend's computer.  So, I basically told him that he needs to put himself in my shoes and he said that I'm being egotistical and selfish.  Well, so much for being in a two man band.  That's all I have to say.  Hmm.. I guess the selfish guy that shared all his computer programs and music samples has to go off and do his own thing now.  I'm the selfish guy that always whines about his problems and complains about every single person in his life and then smiles when those very same people are in front of my face.  Yea, that's me.  No wait, I think that's someone else.  I'm the selfish guy that meets people and lies about the stuff I own to make myself appear to be better than the person I'm talking to.  No wait, that's not me.  I actually do own the stuff I claim to have unlike some people and I don't talk about what I own a lot because I'm not a show stoppin ass gum bumper.  I guess I just have to stop sharing from now on since I've been so selfish.  Isn't it ironic?  That's the funny part.  I don't mean to sound like I'm full of myself, but I don't need anyone to make it in this music shit.  I don't need anyone to hold my hand and download computer programs for me and install them.  I don't need anyone to find samples for me.  But, Jon does.  Before he knew me, he was making music using a Casio keyboard from 1984.  He can go back to making the Revenge of the Nerds theme song without me and then we'll see who was the selfish bastard that helped him out when he needed it.  Thanks to me, he won't have to and you know what?  He doesn't get it.  And to think, I did this all for Jon and the thanks that I get is being called egotistical after I refuse to fix his friend's computer and pay him for work that he won't lift a finger to do?  He's lucky that I just argued with him over words and left.  If this was the old Doug, I would've socked him in his mouth for disrespecting me like that.  All this time I've been helping this guy out, he's been thinking that he could earn off of me.  Nobody banks off of me except me.  If that's being selfish, then fuck everybody.  As if my life hasn't been anymore fucked up these days, I gotta have my band partner go turn two-faced on me.  It's all good because this is all a walk in the park for me.  I've lived through worse and I've seen people pull a lot more sketchier shit.  But, now that I look back, I should've known not to trust Jon the day that he admitted that he was jealous of me.  He was jealous of the way my music sounds and the fact that he doesn't possess what I possess.  Jealousy is a muthafuck.  But, the music is still good to me.  It sounds better than ever and it's not going to stop.

						   Click  urlLink here  to listen to the new stuff I'm working on.  These drums are slappin.  I made this song at 190 beats per minute because I figured I should make this one faster.  I think 190 is a pretty nice tempo.  B minor is a nice scale to write in too.  Two sharps, so it's not difficult to work with.  I think I'm getting the hang of making breaks.  Well, when I say making breaks, I mean exhibiting skills beyond your average hobbyist that does this.  Well, it's almost 4AM.  I've been up for a while working on this.  I'm happy with what's turned up though.  These drums are going on my next track.  This song is dedicated to the future which is actually now, but the future of now is more like it.  Maybe that should be the title.  The future of now.  That's corny, but oh well.

						   I've been angry.  But, my 18" flatscreen monitor that I found this weekend works.  I am gonna sell my 21" monitor soon if nobody claims this flatscreen.  I hope nobody does.  hehe.  I been feeling really angry.  Today, I wanted to just sock someone in the mouth.  I know why I've been experiencing these feelings.  But, I won't act on these impulses.  I'm going to exercise my Zen meditation techniques instead and rechannel this negative energy into something positive.  It's not easy though.  Life is a struggle.  I don't feel guilty for being pissed off because I have every right to be.  There's no such thing as fairness or equality.  I'm not just saying that because I watched Farenheit 9/11.

						   My weekend was strange, wonderful, and confusing at the same time.  I found a flat screen monitor worth about $500 in a parking lot.  It was just sitting there, so I put it in my car, looked how much it was worth on the internet and laughed.  Damn.  I don't know how that happened to me, but it did and it wasn't one of those dreams where you dream you have something and then wake up to find that it's gone.  I woke up this morning and still had the monitor.  Haven't had the chance to test it yet though.  I'll post if it works or not tomorrow.  So far, this is what I've got on my  urlLink song .  I'm in the middle of writing some lyrics.  This time I've made it a goal to record lyrics for a dance track.  No bullshit this time.  Anyway, I never saw so many freaks in my life until this weekend.  I was working the entrance at this music show featuring these artists that have worked with Bjork and it was just funny the kind of people that showed up.  Most of the people there were like kind and all, but they had a lot of opinions about one of the artists and that sort of upset me.  It's one thing to criticize someone when you know what you're doing, but in the field of avante garde and experimental sound, it just is what it is and you have to take it as it is.  I was pretty inspired by a lot of things that I heard.  This one old man named Francis Dhomont really had some crazy shit going on.  I was inspired by him.  Not to make experimental music, but to dabble into the different types of designs he had in his cyberacoustic showcase.  He created a lot of these sounds that sounded like ninja swords cutting through air and shit.  It was matrixy and shit.  That's how I would describe it.  When mixing experimental sound with dance music, it's classified as IDM and I don't like the name of that category.  Because I feel like all music is intelligent and the name "intelligent dance music" sounds stupid.  Most people are idiots though, that's how names like that come up.  In about six months, I'll be ready for an independent label to pick me up.  But, I don't expect for any tracks get signed because I'm more focused on school then getting a record deal.  By the time I graduate college, I know I'll be ready for the planet.  Because at this rate that I'm going and possessing everything that I possess, I don't think that there's anything really out there that's working against my favor.  Shit, I don't want to go to summer school tomorrow.  Five fuckin classes.  Feet don't fail me now.

						   I gotta smoke weed to maintain right now.  When you can't depend on anti-depressants, exercise, and eating healthy, there's only one cure.  Weed.  Maryjane doesn't care if you drive a crappy car.  Maryjane doesn't mind if you don't have any money because you spent your last dollar on her.  Maryjane likes to go eat fast food while you're hanging out with her because it tastes good and who cares.  Maryjane doesn't mind if you've had six beers and you forgot to pick her up.  She'll still be there to lift you up when you are feeling down.  Do you do you do you do you do you do you think you love me Maryjane?  I'm Rick James, BITCH!!  hahahaha

						   God damn.  It's been a few weeks since I ended a friendship with this girl that was acting hella sheisty towards me.  I don't know why, but she carbon copied me on this email she sent to her ex boyfriend that she got back with according to the email.  I thought the email was for me at first, so I was like, what the fuck?  I was thinking, "I hate her guts, why is she sending me this email?  I wouldn't even piss on her if she was lit on fire."  She's mean.  If I ever see her on the street, I'm gonna spit on her

Portishead Beat (untitled) 5. The Future of Now 6. Atlantean Reptiles 7. Junebug 8. Let Me Fall (Break My Heart)    This mix is converted to a 96kbps mp3.  I don't know why, but I like the way mp3s sound at the low-quality bitrate.  It's like the new vinyl record sound for me I think.  The hiss and pop feel has been replaced by truncated digital audio bits which causes a hiss also if you listen closely.  Well, I am not 100% sure if it is due to truncation, but that's what I am guessing it is since it's converted from a higher bitrate to a lower bitrate.  I learned some new tricks so I'm able to mix these songs together pretty much seamlessly without missing a single beat.  I was struggling with this program Nuendo, but I think I'm getting it to obey me now.  So, this mp3 is a test run.  It's my first mix.  I mixed togther a bunch of mp3 files because I wasn't sure if I want to fill up a few gigs on my hard drive with this mix project without giving it a test.  I think there's a lot of potential in it.  I feel a little weird being on my solo again.  It's not a feeling of insecurity, but it's more like a feeling of readjustment.  I'm going back to where I was before I got into the whole band thing.  I'm comfortable working this way.  I will collaborate with artists in the future, but for now I'm going to focus on my solo project and getting an album together.  I've definitey gained some wisdom for the future if I am going to enter into a band again.  I don't want to work with anyone that doesn't have adequate equipment and also someone that is insecure and unconfident.  That sort of shit just rubs off and it's unhealthy.  I decided to call my first album "New World Disorder".  I thought that was a good title for it since the world is fuckin crazy.  With the pharmaceutical industry being like one of the top five in the country, it's a very appropriate name for how the elite rich people that probably own the largest portion of the drug industry is also the ones that influence other areas of society that drive people to the point where they can't function unless they're under medication.  take my old band partner jon for instance, he told me that he has A.D.D.  He has been on medication since his younger years.  I found this out about a month ago.  But, it made a lot of sense.  And you learn that a lot of other people are on medication and you don't find out until you get to know them.  I'm pretty forward with my med taking.  I'll tell the whole world about it.  But, if we're not on meds, we're on drugs or alcohol.  But, everyone's on something.  There are the sober people though don't get me wrong.  Like my parents.  They are sober.  My dad used to probably drink a lot when he was my age, but he doesn't anymore.  Anyway, the world and society that I see before my eyes on a daily basis is bound to chemicals and technology.  They are the glue for our society.  Manufactured by the rich and strategically fed to the masses like livestock on a farm.  So that the farm animal human race can be harvested through education and training to serve and maintain the systematic cycle of consumption and production.  And this system has to grow and thrive so wars are waged and the bubble grows and grows.  Imagine the kid that can't stop feeding himself Bazooka Joes so that he can keep on blowing bigger bubbles.  That's the United States.  The New World Disorder.

						   This is one of my latest songs.  I'm just posting the instrumental of what it might sound like.  Still needs some work.  The drums are the exact same drums I used for the song before.  I'm doing this thing where I'm mixing this song from another song that's using the same drums.  Both songs are at 100bpm and in A minor.  what happened was, i was working on a beat and then came up with a totally entire new beat with what i was working with and then decided to make a totally different song.  but, since the new song had the same drums, i was wondering, should i change the drums?  then i realized, it still sounds pretty good.  i had to work hard to get that snare with the little clap at the end.  ahaa.  so i'll just keep use it twice.  I really like this beat a lot because most of it has been made using keyboards rather than software synthesizers.  I got some sounds off of a Korg Triton on there and I used a Virus to make the lead bells and the bassline.  The guitar pick and the pad was from the Triton.  It was nice to collaborate with my old friend and get some work done on this beat.  His cousin got murdered by two shots to the head, so this is one of the songs dedicated to him since he's passed away.   urlLink Runnin On Empty

						   I should have my Mackie subwoofer in the next two months.  How??  I'm pimpin' the system like usual.  Financial Aid and grants are going right into the subwoofer fund.  I don't know why they wanna charge $1,249 for this subwoofer.  But, hey.  These speakers I have are known to last well over five years and within five years from now, if I don't have a new studio monitor system it will probably be because I land a gig doing something else for a shitload of money.  It would probably take a million dollar career for me to quit making music though.  There's nothing else on this world worth doing.  Being my own boss and playing with hi-tech toys all day long to make music.  You really can't ask for more.  To ask for more than that would be foolish.  I don't need to make millions.  But, the music business is a lot like playing craps.  I learned an important lesson while gambling at Reno.  I placed too big of bets too soon.  The way I gotta play with my music career is totally different of course.  But, let's face it, reality is nothing like gambling in a crap game but there are some similarities.  I guess the odds of winning with a music careeer has less probability than winning at a crap game when always betting behind the pass line with the same amount of money each bet.  Nah, fuck that.  That's negative thinking right there.  It's all about building contacts which I am doing.  The key is to build the right contacts though.  You've got all these people out here in the music game that get high everyday smoking weed and snorting coke and doing all sorts of stupid shit that gets them no where.  But, this is common in every single industry in the United States.  You also have a lot of people that think they've succeeded before they even try.  I'm not saying optimism is bad.  But, being over-egotistical is a surefire way of getting people to run away from you.  Nobody likes dealing with a big-head phony.  So, what I'm doing now is shutting up.  No more contact unless it's related to production.  As far as shows and all that other shit is concerned, I'm not focusing on that at all.  I'm going to put my money where my mouth is and my talent is where it's at.  That's what is going to speak for itself.  I'm sick of doing these performances without a CD to sell or not having songs structured solidly within my performance.  So, with the experience I've gained from performing, I'm going to do something that I don't think many people have done within the hip hop game before.  Most artists come out, have their songs they perform, but in between songs, there's always a pause while they wait for their next beat to come up on the CD that the DJ popped in.  My set is going to have an already mixed instrumental set on the CD so that one song will seamlessly mix into the previous track and the listener will be dancing the whole time or paying attention to what I'm doing without having to see me talk in between songs.  It's just going to be non-stop performance without any pause.  The listener can enjoy a set with songs that have been mixed together along with a DJ turntablizing over the beats.  It doesn't get any better than that.  I got these ideas and I'm not afraid of sharing them via my blog.  Because anyone out there is more than welcome to do what I'm doing.  As a matter of fact, I hope that's exactly what happens.  I hope that people that are rapping say, Man, I want to have a set like that.  But, people aren't going to think that I did it.  They're going to think that my DJ is the one that mixed the set and produced the beats.  And, that's fine because that's just one of the stereotypes that's placed upon emcees.  Most emcees don't produce their own beats.  And, I haven't produced every beat that I'm using.  I have about three other people that I am getting beats from.  So, there'll be four producers making beats on my CD, including me.  I am about two years away from being on the status of a true producer.  I think I'll be marketable by the time I graduate from school.  Shit, that's the whole point in me going to school.  This degree better do something for me as hard as I'm busting my ass.

						   I went to Reno over the weekend.  I went with my friend Alex and my other friend Luke from high school.  Luke is hooked on heroin now.  It's pretty depressing.  He's got a four year old kid, too.  I tried to drop some positive words on him and tell him to forget about prison because that's all he seems to talk about.  Like my friend Jason I used to hang out with.  After he got out, that's all he'd talk about.  "When I was locked up" this, "When I was locked up" that.  "Oh that reminds me of this one time when I was locked up..."  I guess that's what being incarcerated for a long period of time does to people.  I used to do the same exact shit when I first got out.  It's all out of my system fortunately.  All of my other friends that I know went back after getting out.  Not a single one I know has gotten out and stayed out.  That's what the system does to people.  Anyway, things have been difficult for me.  Summer school is kicking my ass.  I find it to be a lot more challenging than I presumed it would be.  Business statistics is the cause of most of my misery these days.  I just have to tough it out until spring and then I'll be smooth sailing after I'm in SFSU since my parents will be a lot more supportive of me after I'm in there.  I wish that I had more time to work on my music too.  I'm getting a lot better at it, but a lot of my potential is lost since I'm never home to use my equipment.   urlLink Listen   You can hear the difference from when I first started.  I'm angry these days though.  I think it's because of what happened with my band.  I want to sock that guy in the mouth because he keeps calling me, but I'd rather not speak to him because I don't want to sock him in the mouth.  If I didn't have two strikes, I probably would sock him in the mouth for saying those horrible things to me.  But, I guess that's why the two strikes are there.  Ah fuck it.  At least I fixed my wireless internet.  My laptop connects to my router everytime I boot up now and it doesn't drop my connection.  The signal strength is Excellent now.  Before it was only Good to Very Good.  The way I fixed it was by changing the wireless channel.  I don't know why I couldn't have thought of that before.  I broke my diet today.  I ate two chocolate chip cookies.  Oh well.  Is there a normal person alive that is satisfied with the way that they're shaped?  I have to get through this semester.  Fuck.  This has got the be one of the most challenging times I've ever faced.

						   All you can really do is put your faith in God and hope that shit turns out alright.  You can't trust anyone.  Friends, family, professors, associates, co-workers, ...  You can't even trust yourself.  I think I've trusted myself too much.  But, I'm fuckin nuts.  What am I doing thinking I'm right?  I am just thankful that I've realized this.  Yes.  Fuck the world.  I put my faith in God and the rest of the world can burn in Hell.

						   sometimes isn't all that it's cracked up to be.  if you own a cheap ass router, it's not worth using.  i happen to own a cheap ass router.  so, when i'm surfing the web, my router will decide to disconnect my laptop.  hopefully i fixed it though.  oh well.

						   Next summer, I'm not going to take five classes.  As a matter of fact, I'm not going to take any classes next summer.  I'm going to save some money and go to Amsterdam.  Even if I have to go all by myself, I'm going to get on a plane and go to Amsterdam for a month or something.  Well, maybe I'll stay in Amsterdam for two weeks and the UK for another two weeks.  But, I'm taking my laptop, my microphone, and get me some music gigs or something.  My goal is to have some CDs and go to Amsterdam and do some performances at some hash bars or something.  I'm not going to spend summer stressing out.  Never again will I make myself work this hard for anything.  This is just torture.  It's the last week I'll have to do this shit though.  ahahhahahahahaha
