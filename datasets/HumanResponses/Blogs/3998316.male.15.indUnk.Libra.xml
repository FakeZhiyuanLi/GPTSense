      Well usually my schedule at Mario's is Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Although since Sean went to North Carolina this week, I had to work Friday and also work alone on Sunday, a busy day, because he works with me Sundays. Here is a recap for the folks at home.   Day One(Thursday): After a shitty basketball game the previous night, I was ready to work and make some serious money. I work alone on Thursdays usually and for the most part it's good money. When I came in it was packed as always, and there were a lot of tables already in need of a good busing(because I'm a busboy...Duh!). So I spent a good half hour frantically running around and setting and clearing all the tables, while the waiters/waitresses ask me to wrap food for them. Towards 9:00(oh yeah, I start work at 6), the crowd cleared and I was sitting in the back watching the Graham Norton effect(man that guy is gay or British, I can't really tell), waiting for the people to leave. I got 48 dollars in tips altogether. My morale was high after work, and was confident I would easily do the next 3 days.   Day Two(Friday): I'm working with Devon McCloud tonight, an 18 year old kid about to go to boot camp and then the Marines. I told him I was tired from working out, or playing basketball, or hop scotching at the church, whatever the lie was I told him to let me work the side of the room that lets you go home early(B&C Rooms). So I worked through the night and usually if I was working that room I would be out of there by 8:30 or 9, but not tonight..oooo noooo. This party came in at about 8:15 and stayed forever. So in the end me and Devon left at the same time, and he made more money than me. I'm officially pissed now.   Day Thrice(Saturday): Saturday is the busiest day for us. And since I told Devon I wanted B&amp;C last night, tonight I would be working D room, which is the room you work in until the place is closed and everyone leaves. And on weekends we close at 10, 10:30. So I worked my ass off, and the biggest table in my room was about 8 people. And towards 9:00 Gina tells both me and Devon that one of us can leave. Now the unwritten rule is if you work in B&C you leave early. But Gina said she wanted me to leave early, because I am working alone tomorrow. Being the nice douchebag I am, I let Devon leave and finished up work. Morale is rising, and I feel like I did something special. Oh yeah, 55 dollar tip, thats a very good thing.   Day Four(Sunday): Slept till 1 today because I needed to rest up for work. Sunday is a semi-busy night, but still is a pain in the ass if your working alone. Came into work a little late, got all of the supplies and shit ready to go and drank my mountain dew. Then all of a sudden a shit load of people come into the restaurant, and a shit load leave at the same time. So I am frantically going around the whole place cleaning and setting tables and getting waters for the customers. I also have to deal with the asshole dish washers who constantly bitch about something, but in the end it really doesn't matter because they are dishwashers and that alone makes me better than them. I worked so hard Chris, the waiter, asked if I wanted to duck out of here. It was about 9:00 and I jumped on that offer immediatly, got my 45 dollars in tips and got the hell out of there.   Here was my celebrity morale timeline representing my struggle.

      Most of my teachers last year were complete assholes. They really didn't know how to teach, pissed me off a lot, and taught me nothing except how to not listen to someone talk for a long period of time. That's why i made a little cartoon of what it was like for me in one of my classes last year.      I prey the teachers this year will not be as assinine as my former teachers. And since I cannot name names, I will just say their codenames: Frehringer, Mikhos, Perrot, Stanhart. The best of luck to me sophmore year.

      Well after a somewhat successful year of the 9th grade, I have some survival tips for upcoming freshman. Keep these tips in mind at all times, and you will not end up as the guy thats named "Pants" or "Slippery Pete" by his fellow high school peers. This first segment will let give you an idea of some of the people you will likely meet this year.    Jock-Strap Johnny : This guy immediatly jumps into football from the first day. He wears his fresh new jersey to school telling everybody who he is, and why they should like him. Johnny hangs around with the people on his team, while simultaneously is using them so he can meet more people, and hot girls. Eventually Johnny starts getting noticed by seniors for that "awesome pass in the 4th quarter" or that "story where he told everyone he got laid by the head cheerleader". Johnny starts going to parties now and starts to develop an alcohol problem. This is a good year for Johnny.    Dungeons and Dragons Dave : The first day of school Dave immediatly latches himself onto the closest group of people playing yugi-o. But Dave is only as good as his level he's achieved from the grueling game of D&D. The higher Dave's Zorthon level goes, the more respect he gets, but the more sperm he loses. Dave stays quiet in class and doesn't bother getting into conversations with anybody else&nbsp;unless they have atleast a five star gold edition mega super togon card.    Stick-it-up-me Susy : The first day of school for this girl usually involves wearing the skimpiest outfit she can possibly find, and finding a nice corner to sit in alone, until some guy talks to her. Things start going well, and they find themselves in the janitor's closet after lunch. Afterwards the guy spreads all these rumors about her,&nbsp; and then which the other slutty girls pick up on this, invite her into their group, and start going hanging out. They continue to sleep with anyone that has a dick, as long as they are seniors. Susy will need therapy 5 years later.    Gothic Greg : The first day of school is a big day for young Greg. He&nbsp;will be trying his bets to get good grades in all of his academics, and get top honors in his class.&nbsp;Unfortunately a week later Greg's mom gets hit by a car and is now in a coma. Greg starts believing that there is no god, otherwise this wouldn't of happened. He then dyes his hair black, and trades all of his bright, colorful clothes in for dark trench coats and shitty fisherman's hats. Greg starts hanging out with other people who don't believe in god because of some other reason, and before you know it Greg is a goth. He starts smoking weed and playing the guitar all of the time. There is no time for homework because he has to be at the sacrificing at 9. Greg will grow up to work in the restaurant business or retail.    Smart-as-a-whistle Sharon : From elemtary school to middle school, Sharon was pushed away from the rest of society to be in the gifted program. Now that she is in high school,&nbsp; and on an academic science program, she takes AP Biology. Sometimes she is forced to talk with people not of her superior intelligence, so she must fake like she is a moron so no one will think she is weird. She spends her friday nights on aim thinking of interesting things to put in her away message. Sharon tries to act like everybody else, but people can clearly see she is not specialized in human contact. So people will pretend to be nice to her but sadly she is an outcast. Sharon will go to a fine college but then realize the business world is too hard for her because she can't interact with others, so she ends up writing books off of some island in the indian ocean.    I'm-White-but-act-black Broderick : The story of Broderick is sad but true. In middle school he wasn't a very smart kid, and lacked a personality. No one would talk to him and he usually sat down by the water fountain every morning with his cd player. But in high school it's a new beginning for Broderick. Broderick has just gotten cable and has grown fond of the BET channel. He then starts dressing like the black rappers he sees, and starts talking like he's a hippy from Alabama. Black people think he's a poser so they won't hang out with him, but Broderick then finds a special group of kids dressed up the way he is. They all hang out together and start wearing undershirts to school all the time, even though they lack any muscle tone. Unfortunately they will wind up dead in 10 years in a shooting off of harlem and 25th street.    I-need-to-be-popular Lindsey : Lindsey was the shit in middle school. She knew everybody in the whole school and had rich parents who would do anything for her. Her life was perfect. But now she is going into high school, where nobody really gives a fuck who she is, except for a select few. Lindsey, from the get-go, will have small conversations with strangers and asking them for their cell phone number and aim screename. Soon Lindsey strikes gold by becoming friends with another rich girl who also used to be popular. They start making friends with the football team and then, wouldn't you of known it, they are at every party in the school. Lindsey's life is perfect until she finds out her dad is beating the shit out of her mom and her mom is a heavy alcoholic. She doesn't say anything because it would mess up her life and people would know who she really is. So everyday she comes to school she puts on a smile and shows everybody what car daddy is getting her....unless he's going to jail.    God-you-guys-are-immature Gary : Gary is what they call a smart ass. He is quite an intelligent guy, and because of this he thinks he is older and more mature than everybody else. So when someone is having fun Gary immediatly rolls his eye, because Gary can't have any fun or he is being immature. Gary also thinks he is too good to do his homework, so he fails his classes, but tells everybody that hes still smart. Eventually Gary ends up blowing his brains out his Junior year. The doctor says the cause was deep psychological trauma.   This will be part one of this series. If you find yourself in one of these categories, then good for you, because you are on your way to surviving you freshman year.&nbsp;

      Well for most of you that have English 2 honors this year you will have to read the book  The Catcher in The Rye . I read it last year for no reason, and I have made up a little summary for those who do not wish to read this book, and trust me, the summary will cover everything you are going to need to know.  Hi, my name is Holden Caulfield. I am a teenager who thinks he's got the whole world figure out. I call a lot of people phonies because they are not acting like the real person that they are. Though, when in fact, I am a phony. I say a lot of shit in my mind but don't have the balls to speak up about it. I leave school because my roomate smells, and I head off to New York City to call my old girlfriend at 2am and try to get some ass from her. She declines and I lie alone jerking off to the olsen twins in a 5 dollar motel room. I then call a hooker to my room but I'm too much of a pussy to do anything so I pay her for nothing. I then wander the streets of NYC, stalking my little sister as she goes on a field trip to the park. I told her I'm running away and she wanted to go with me. I told her to stay at home with mom and dad, and become a phony like they are. And the moral to my story is that everybody is a goddam phony. When they start doing blah blah blah I'm a big fat dumbass, then the world will be right. Everybody should be like me and blah blah blah etc etc etc and the world will be right. Oh yeah, I wind up in a mental hospital, go figure.

      Schedules....what do you mean...like for classes? Yeah douchebag, it's that time where life smacks you like a bitch right in the face and tells you school is starting. I went to pick up my schedule the other day and was really pissed off.  Pre-Ap Visions and pursuits, spanish 1, chemistry honors, and eng 2 honors are the classes i will be taking for the next god dam 18 weeks. Usually I've taken easy classes because I am so lazy(yeah, believe it or not I'm pretty smart), and have been able to not do any homework and get really good grades on the tests so I was able to pass. But now with all of these hard classes it looks like I'm going to have to apply myself this year. The scary part is I might have to give up some of my work days for....academics! Fuck that, I can handle it.  I joined this fantasy football league online a while back and we had the online draft tonight. I think I did pretty well because I was able to attain Daunte Hall, Curtis Martin, the new england defense, chad pennington, and torry holt to name a few. I may have to make some trades to get a better running back, because tiki barber is not going to stay on my team as long as there is a pulse left in me. And that's pretty much it, season starts September 13th!  I've busted my ass this year staying on my workout program and going to the YMCA 3 or more days a week. I run a mile or more on the treadmill everytime and go workout on almost all of the machines. And no matter what comes up the YMCA will be on my top priorities list till I make the team. I don't really give a shit who you are, no offense, but if I don't make the team I am gonna be so pissed off that you couldn't find a clear definition for how pissed off I am going to be.
