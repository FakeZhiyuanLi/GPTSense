           We went to Pennsylvania this weekend to pick out a crib for my step-sisters baby room. We ended up paying for it, but really, they don't have the money anyway. That's our shower gift LOL. On Saturday evening, we went to this little art festival somewhere downtown I guess. I have no idea where I'm at when I go anywhere in PA. There were a lot of neat little tents set up. I saw this hand-made dress that I loved. I really wanted it, but it was $478 dollars. That's just a bit much. It was made with yellow, orange, green, and pink fabrics. Of course it was prettier than it sounds . . .  I finally went school shopping today too. We try to shop in PA for school clothes because there's no tax. But we almost didn't go to the mall. That would have made me mad. We went to look at Tom's new house before we went shopping (Tom is my step-brother). When we were about to leave, Jen's mom asked where were going to go (Jen is Tom's wife). My mom said I wanted to do a little bit of school shopping because there's no tax here. I wanted to go to the mall because they have a Delia's and a Charlotte Russe, which we don't have anywhere around here. Then Jen's mom just had to say "Oh, well there's a TJMaxx, Marshalls, Old Navy, Kohls, and some other stores just over there." We ALMOST went there. We got lost, so we just went to mall because we knew where that was. But I was kind of mad at her that she said that because we have those stores here. So yeah.  So we went over to Ross Park Mall, which was about 10 minutes away. We first went to Delias. Apparently we were in there for about an hour.  My dad was annoyed I think. I ended up getting:  urlLink A sweater  I don't usually like these, but it was cute.  urlLink A button-down shirt  It looks ugly in the picture, but it's better looking than that :D  urlLink Another shirt  Just something to wear with something else, like a Jacket. Then we went to Charlotte Russe. I got this Pink light-weight corduroy Jacket, and a brown shirt stretch shirt that was rippled kind of, at the bottom. It's a little longer than a regular shirt. It's like a dress, but in a shirt form LOL. I wasn't going to go anywhere else because my dad was in a hurry to leave and get home. But he said if I don't get anything else, I won't be able to get anything back home. (because of the tax). So we went to American Eagle, which was the closest store around.  urlLink Jeans  There was a hot guy that showed us to these jeans (LMAO) He might have been gay though . .. :-| They're really comfortable and loose fitting in the legs.  urlLink Pants  I just spotted these pink pants, and went over to them. They were soft.  urlLink Sweatshirt  I picked this up at last minute. It was cute, but I have to go back to the mall sometime soon so I can get a bigger size. I didn't try it on. Anyone wanna go with me? :D  It was fun I have to say. I can't wait for school to start. Well, except that I don't know anyone in my lunch hour. And the new bus routes are dumb. I won't know anyone besides the people on my street.
