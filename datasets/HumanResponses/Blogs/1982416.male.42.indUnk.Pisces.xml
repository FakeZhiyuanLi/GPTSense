      McFague's seminal approach to narrative theology was laid out in 1975 in her book, "Speaking in Parables: A Study in Metaphor and Theology", published by Fortress Press.   She was until very recently Dean of the Divinity School and the  urlLink Carpenter Professor of Theology  at Vanderbilt Divinity School in Nashville, Tennessee. Although she's retired, she's become Distinguished Theologian in Residence at  urlLink Vancouver School of Theology .   Sallie McFague's Speaking in Parables - as published by SCM in 2002&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     In "Speaking in Parables", McFague lays out an approach for intermediary or parabolic theology: theology which relies on various literary forms – parables, stories, poems, confessions – as a way from religious experience to systematic theology. McFague brings a commitment to bringing the Word to life for ordinary people, grounded in a existential, personal and sensuous reflection on life.  McFague refers often to poetry (Gerard Manley Hopkins), stories (Tolkien) and parables (such as those written by Kavka).   McFague reminds the theologian that metaphor and symbol should be used as food for thought – contemplated, probed, reflected upon, rather than manipulated, translated and reduced. Theologians, she says, need to learn to express insights in autobiography as much as in systematic propositions.   urlLink Speaking in Parables  has recently been republished by SCM, 2002, but the 1975 version is also available online at Religion Online:  urlLink Speaking in Parables: A Study in Metaphor and Theology: Online   McFague's later books include:  urlLink Metaphorical Theology: Models of God  (1997),  urlLink The Body of God: An Ecological Theology  (1993), and  urlLink Super, Natural Christians: How we should love nature  (1997). Her most recent book is  urlLink Life Abundant: Rethinking Theology and Economy for a Planet in Peril  (2000)

      When you hear the phrase "theological reflection" it is usually applied to to theological students in the context of field education. Yet most people writing about theological reflection expect that the predominant context will be groups of people in congregational settings working together to make sense of their lives. So why do we expect the professional theologians to talk theology while everyone else just 'does it'? James Hopewell, before his death in 1984, challenged his peers in theological education circles to think beyond clericalism. Seminaries needed to think beyond the formation and equipping of ordained ministers. When working through the stories, symbols and meanings of ministry experience, groups should be considering not just individuals, but whole congregations.  Hopewell distributed the draft of an essay to his colleagues in 1983 - proposing that the new paradigm of theological education should be the development of the life and faith of the congregation. His research was published in more detail after his death in the book " urlLink Congregations: Stories and Structures ", edited by Barbara Wheeler in 1987. The essay was responded to by his colleagues in another book, " urlLink Beyond Clericalism: The Congregation as a Focus for Theological Education ", edited by Barbara Wheeler and Joseph Hough in 1988. Barbara Wheeler and Edward Farley continued the conversation in the collation of essays: " urlLink Shifting Boundaries: Contextual Approaches to the Structure of Theological Education ", in 1991.  Congregation: Stories and Structures, by James F. Hopewell (I've embedded Hopewell's photograph from the back cover of the book).&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Much of Hopewell's thesis comes from the experience of beginning a new church plant with a team of lay members, each of whom helped shape the culture of a thriving church over four years. He saw the impact of narrative - shared stories - on the culture and ethos of this congregation in the same way he'd seen earlier in African villages. Context was not just something to be considered when entering strange cultures - it was a factor in the local American congregation. Also a factor in the American seminary.  The implications of Hopewell's thesis have deepened as theologians have learnt to take the congregation seriously. Nancy Ammerman's congregational studies are now standard texts. Alban Institute's work on the local congregation has become a core part of our learning. Don Browning, still the academic, encourages his readers and fellow scholars to take congregational theology seriously. Theological reflection is the domain of local teams of mission agents who may or may not include ordained clergy.

      Ken Pohly's first book, Pastoral Supervision, came out in 1977. It was at the time a groundbreaking text for Christian leaders and educators considering the practice of professional supervision. Pohly provided a theological foundation for supervision while helping his readers learn the development of supervision in a broad range of disciplines. He picks up on the strong contributions of narrative theology and applies them to professional supervision for ministers.  Pohly's latest book,  urlLink Transforming the Rough Places: The Ministry of Supervision , 2001, is an updated version of Pastoral Supervision. He provides an overview of the writing in several fields relating to supervision and provides an excellent series of bibliographical appendices.  Kenneth Pohly's 2001 book, Transforming the Rough Places&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Kenneth established the  urlLink Center for Supervision and Leadership Formation  at  urlLink United Theological Seminary  in Dayton, Ohio. He's from a United Methodist context.   urlLink Ken Pohly - United Theological Seminary, Dayton, Ohio

       urlLink     urlLink Models of Contextual Theology  Revised and Expanded Edition(2002) - with a photo of Bevans embedded.&nbsp; urlLink    Stephen Bevans published the first version of this book in 1992. In it he outlined the need for theology to take context seriously. He wrote carefully and compellingly about the interaction between gospel and culture. Five models were used in 1992: Translation  ( urlLink Hesselgrave  & John Paul II),  anthropological  ( urlLink Robert E. Hood  &  urlLink Vincent J. Donovan ),  praxis  ( urlLink Douglas John Hall  & Asian Feminist theologians),  synthetic  ( urlLink Kosuke Koyama  &  urlLink Jose M. De Mesa ), and  transcendental  ( urlLink Sallie McFague  &  urlLink Justo L. Gonzalez ). In 2002 he's added the  countercultural  model as proposed by the  urlLink Gospel and Our Culture Network  ( urlLink Lesslie Newbigin  &  urlLink Darrell Guder ) &  urlLink Michael J. Baxter .  I like the consistent organic analogies used by Bevans all the way through. Translation's about bringing seeds to plant in native ground. Anthropological is about watering the seeds already in the ground so they'll sprout. Praxis is about constantly weeding the garden, learning to be a better gardener. Synthetic's about cross-pollination. Transcendental is about cultivating my own garden in the hope that another will be inspired to cultivate his or hers. The Countercultural's about weeding and fertilizing the soil so the seeds can be planted.   urlLink Stephen Bevans  is on the staff at Catholic Theological Union in Chicago. Before joining the faculty in 1986, he spent nine years in the Philippines teaching theology at a diocesan seminary. From his website: "This experience has colored the way he does theology and has also influenced his theological interests. His teaching and research probe issues in faith and culture, issues of mission theology, (particularly its trinitarian roots), and issues in ecclesiology and ministry."

      How do we test our assumptions and convictions? When we come to critique our experience, our perception of our context, and our understanding of our tradition, what processes do we use to open up authentic dialogue?  Chris Argyris and Donald Schon have developed a learning discipline with several names: action Science, action inquiry, action research, or organizational learning. A lot of their material can be found in their book,  urlLink Theory in Practice . Peter Senge has run with the idea in his book,  urlLink The Fifth Discipline , implementing the practice of learning organization in business circles.  Anita Farber Robertson, a Unitarian minister in  urlLink Rockford, Massachussets , has written a book,  urlLink Learning While Leading , Alban Institute, 2000, for churches wanting to apply action science to theological reflection. She says that the action science approach helps Christian communities identify gaps and inconsistencies in the theories that inform their practice. Instead of continuing to make the same mistakes again and again, local leaders can use action science disciplines to have a look at what really is going on.  Argyris talks about designed blindness - in which we collude with our culture to overlook certain realities. We are so bound up with cognitive dissonance, often because we believe it is shameful to be imperfect and growing. He says that because our mental models provide a framework for our action as individuals and communities, we should pay attention to how those mental models are formed.  When looking at the formation of our mental models Argyris suggests we should consciously use the "ladder of inference". Start at the bottom of the ladder with directly observable data. Then notice which data you're paying attention to. What cultural and personal meanings are we giving to what we observe? What assumptions are we making based on those meanings? What conclusions are we drawing? What beliefs about the world are we now forming? Now - what are the actions that result? Using this ladder we can identify 'leaps of abstraction' in which we miss steps out and overlook important parts of the process. We can go back and re-explore phases that have been missed. We can identify points of dissonance. This links in with Whiteheads' first step of attending. With one group, I used an actual step ladder to help people enact this in relation to a case study.  Another important contribution of action science is the concept of advocacy and inquiry being valued equally. "I can tell you what I believe and why (advocacy) while paying attention to what you believe and why (inquiry)". This ties in strongly with Whiteheads' second step of conversation or asserting.  I think this model of developing meaning and action is helpful in unpacking the theology and practice related to the everyday life of local christian communities. It helps people test the validity of their assumptions about what's going on in conversations, interactions with each other.   urlLink    Learning While Leading, with a photo of Anita Farber-Robertson embedded.&nbsp; urlLink

      "Art of Theological Reflection" is a popular title -  urlLink John Shea  (2003),  urlLink Jane Kopas  (1983) and  urlLink Ronald Gariboldi  (1987) have all used the phrase in the names of their books. In this post, however, I want to look at the work of Patricia O'Connell Killen and John De Beer in their book, published in 1994 by  urlLink Crossroad Publishing Company .   Patricia O'Connell Killen is Professor of American Religious History, and chair of the  urlLink Department of Religion  at Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, Washington.  John De Beer is rector at  urlLink St Martins in the Field Episcopal Church , in Severna, Maryland.   Patricia and John were both on the staff at  urlLink  University of the South  where they developed their approach to theological reflection. Patricia has continued as part time professor with the  urlLink Institute of Pastoral Studies  at Loyola University of Chicago, providing a Roman Catholic context for her development of education for laity in ministry. John was consultant for ministry of the laity for the  urlLink Episcopal Diocese of Southeast Florida .   I found this book very helpful - developing an approach that draws insight and action from reflection on significant experience. Participants in this model are encouraged to share their stories, explore feelings, images, and insights that lead to action. Participants are then led to intentionally connect their lived narrative with the Christian tradition, being aware of their own convictions and the influence of their cultural environment.   Patricia and John have written this book with their model in mind. They've included images that evoke the sense of exploring experience. They've outlined their theories in graphic diagrams. One such diagram outlines the interplay between tradition and experience. Standing in tradition alone is described as a standpoint of certitide. Standing in experience alone is described as self-assurance. Healthy theological reflections calls one to stand in the crossover of the two spheres.  The authors provide nine templates or designs for theological reflection, starting with life situation, scripture (tradition), scripture and written meditation (tradition), essay (cultural text), collection of resources on one theme (cultural text), an issue or theme, personal positions, religious experiences, and another's theological text.  I recently used the 'experience to action' phase at a multimedia conference in which participants were looking at developing cutting edge approaches to worship in the 'emerging church'. I took the line that the freshest experience of emerging church is to be found in last week's personal and corporate experience. Some were astounded at the level of insight that came from exploring an 'ordinary human experience'. The challenge then came as we brought our narratives, feelings, images, insights and actions to engage with the Scriptures and the cultural forms in which we engaged with our peers.   urlLink Amazon.com: Art of Theological Reflection

      Almost every book on theological reflection written after 1982 refers to the methods and models developed by James D. Whitehead and Evelyn Eaton Whitehead in their book, Method in Ministry. James is a pastoral theologian and Evelyn a developmental and social psychologist. Together they formed Whitehead Associates, training people in ministry to make connections between experience, tradition and culture.   Based for many years in a Catholic context in Chicago (Institute of Pastoral Studies at Notre Dame University) the Whiteheads have made a huge impact on theological education as well as continuing education for ministry, both lay and ordained.  This couple never seem to stop.They continue to publish very helpful material on spirituality, sexuality and community. They're both involved in  urlLink Ricci Institute  for Chinese-Western Cultural History.  The Whiteheads live in South Bend, Indiana, but I haven't found a web presence for Whitehead Associates.  The Whiteheads republished Method in Ministry in 1995, integrating learnings from their conversations with other theologians and writers. They still use the three-stage method of theological reflection: attending, asserting and pastoral response. The style developed in this edition however takes a more personal, imaginative, playful and conversational tone.    urlLink Method in Ministry: Theological Reflection and Christian Ministry

      " urlLink  Doing Theology Ourselves  " is an introduction to theological reflection with a contextual approach, written by Neil Darragh in 1995. Darragh is a Catholic parish priest (Glen Innes, Auckland) and educator at the  urlLink Catholic Institute of Theology , Auckland.   Neil Darragh's Doing Theology Ourselves&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     I have found Darragh's approach helpful in identifying the need for awareness of local issues and their connection with the Christian tradition. He puts his finger on the frustration many have with academic theology - theologians talking with one another in inaccessible language, rather than doing theology with people in everyday ministry and mission contexts. Here Darragh takes the reader through a process of starting from significant action in the local context, identifying issues, pivotal questions and reading the scriptures in that light. No room here for proof texting though. He suggests reading through all of the New Testament when exploring new issues. There's no use hiding the fact that contextual theology, that is done rather than received, is hard work.  As Darragh himself points out, his approach suits people with a literary individualist streak - people able to focus, read and write for long periods of time by themselves. I would add that it suits people who are able to talk about 'issues' for their community. There are major steps required to go from data through to abstract principles that can be applied back to concrete situations.  urlLink Doing theology ourselves - OC Books    As a resource for responding to generational change  Darragh introduces the discipline of considering the local context from the perspective of action rather than books. Local leaders are invited to consider their experiences of ministry and mission. This is done in community, not alone. The most effective theological reflection on generational change is done by people who are engaging with one another as members of specific generations. The dialogue that leads to engagement with scripture together is a huge factor in developing integrity in appropriate styles. Assumptions can be aired and tested. Resources can be sought together. Long term study of the Scriptures can be engaged in with the pivotal questions relating to generational change.

       urlLink Robert Kinast  is Director of the Center for Theological Reflection, Indian Rocks Beach, Florida. He is a leading authority on theological reflection.   urlLink  What are they saying about theological reflection ,  published by  urlLink Paulist Press  in 2000, explores five styles of theological reflection.   1. Kinast's exploration of the  Ministerial style  (training people for ministry) centres around Method in Ministry by James D and Evelyn Eaton Whitehead.  2. The  spiritual wisdom  style of theological reflection is 'rooted in the veryday life experiences of believing people'. Kinast here looks at material by Thomas Groome, Patricia Killen and John de Beer.  3. The  Feminist style  is described as a collective enterprise with many voices throughout the world contributing. Kinast introduces work by Elizabeth Schussler Fiorenza, Elizabeth Johnson, Mary Daly, Sally McFague and Mary McClintock Fulkerson. 4. The  Inculturation style  of theological reflection encourages participants to reflect in and on their cultural setting. Kinast explores Robert Schreiter's work, along with  issues relating to Hispanic/Latino and African American cultures. 5. The  Practical Style  of Theological Reflection, as championed by Don Browning, aims for a critical theological reflection on current praxis rather than applying theory to practice. It concentrates on the community of faith and its relationship to larger society rather than the pastor and the pastor's relationship to the congregation (clerical paradigm). This easy-to-read book is a useful beginning for getting one's head around twenty five years of writing on theological reflection as a practice. urlLink    Robert L. Kinast's "What Are They Saying About Theological Reflection?"&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      Considering Generational Change  The Ministry Formation model of theological reflection helps Christian leaders consider their own response to generational change in wider society and in the church. The spiritual wisdom approach allows for the possibility that fresh experience may bring new insights to the church. The Feminist approaches to theological reflection introduce tools such as the hermeneutic of suspicion, the critique of power and the valuing of unheard voices. These can all be applied to the church's relationship with its emerging generations. The inculturation approach provides a useful entry point to the consideration of context, both global and local.  Practical theology as a discipline allows for the dialogue between pragmatic considerations and the historical and systematic streams of theology - a useful reality check for both Christian leaders seeking to be both relevant to new generations and true to their shared Christian beliefs.

      David Tracy writes the first essay in " urlLink Theological Literacy for the Twenty-First Century ", edited by Rodney Petersen with Nancy Rourke. In that essay, he outlines his conviction that theological education is about conversation.  Theological Literacy (2002) - includes an essay by David Tracy&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Some gleanings:  "To become educated is to be freed to enter the conversation of all the living and the dead; to enter that conversation independently and critically, to be sure, but nonetheless to enter."  The criteria of an excellent conversation? Letting go - freeing ourselves from self-consciousness to listen, allow opinions to be tested, and allow the 'to and fro movement' of the questions simply as they come.  Tracy places two great quotes alongside each other: The unreflected life is not worth living (Socrates) The unlived life is not worth reflecting upon (Buddhist)  This is to say that we've needlessly separated feeling and thought, form and content, theory and practice. Distinctions are helpful. Dichotomies are not.  In all this, I find again and again Tracy's reminder that we are part of a learning community that breaks through the limits of time and space.  "We know Christ Jesus because long-extinct communities and too easily forgotten generations have alowed us to hear this judging and healing Word."  I'm (Duncan) convinced that when we discover something about the people who write theology, we become partners in conversation with people rather than dealers in ideology. So with that in mind, here's some biographical background to David Tracy...  David is on the  urlLink faculty of University of Chicago Divinity School . His full title is "Andrew Thomas Greeley and Grace McNichols Greeley Distinguished Service Professor of Catholic Studies" and "Professor of Theology and of the Philosophy of Religion, the Divinity School and the Committee on Social Thought".   Born in 1939 - that makes him 65 this year (2004). He's a Catholic diocesan priest. He's keen on classical studies - which explains his many references to classics in his theological writing. His books include:  urlLink Analogical Imagination  (1985),  urlLink Plurality and Ambiguity  (1994),  urlLink On Naming the Present  (1995),  urlLink Blessed Rage for Order (1985), and  urlLink Dialogue with the Other  (1991).

        "Do you believe in heaven or is it just something rich people invented so that poor people wouldn't rebel?"  Dave Hughes,  urlLink The Glasshouse , June 4    "When you fully comprehend that there is more to life than just here and now, and you realize that life is just preparation for eternity, you will begin to live differently. You will start living in the light of eternity, and that will color how you handle every relationship, task and circumstance. Suddenly many activities, goals and even problems that seemed so important will appear trivial, petty and unworthy of your attention. The closer you live to God, the smaller everything else appears."  (Rick Warren)  Back in 1984 I did some training with  urlLink Evangelism Explosion International . In teams of 3 we asked people two diagnostic questions:   1. If you were to die today, do you know for sure you would go to be with God in heaven? 2. If God were to ask you, "Why should I let you into My Heaven?" what would you say?  For some people we contacted, these were timely questions. They had spent the last few of their seventy years wondering about the after life. But for many people, heaven was not on the radar. Many people didn't have a concept of heaven or hell. It was a reflection of the secularised society we were living in (New Zealand).  One young student I worked with turned up one day to say he was giving Christian faith away. He had been motivated to follow Christ by a fear of going to hell. He couldn't continue to live a life with that kind of motivation. Try as he might, he couldn't cotton on to the idea that God loved him - it didn't gel with the attitude of the youth leader who had badgered him into the kingdom.  It gets me thinking. Is the crux of Christian faith an assurance that we will be with God in heaven forever when we die, based on faith in God's grace shown in Christ's death on the cross? Or is that the icing on the cake?  I have a personal assurance that I don't have to worry about my eternal destiny. I know that nothing I can do or say can make God love me more or less. I totally trust in the free offer of life in Jesus Christ. But my heart is on living this life God has called me to, right here, right now. I want to live a life of integrity - one that is growing to look more and more like the life I profess to live.  I certainly hope there is a life after death. I am encouraged by the hope that I may again see my daughter who died at 18 months. But at the same time, I don't think I can ever bring to life the past. What is gone is gone. The future is in God's hands.  Rick Warren's question to consider:  "Since I was made to last forever, what is the one thing I should stop doing and the one thing I should start doing today?"   Well, I think I'd stop using the word "should", and start developing a sense of God's call each day, as opposed to the drive to be "successful".

        "I observed that the basic motive for success is the driving force of envy and jealousy!"  Ecclesiastes 4:4 (Living Bible)   "The man without a purpose is like a ship without a rudder - a waif, a nothing, a no man."  Thomas Carlyle   Today's reading from The Purpose Driven Life challenges some of the drives that pull us around without us knowing. Guilt, resentment and anger, fear, materialism, need for approval - they all influence everyday decisions in unhealthy ways. They lead to unused potential, unnecessary stress and an unfulfilled life. True, true, true.  Knowing your purpose gives meaning to your life, simplifies your life, focuses your life, motivates your life, and prepares you for eternity.  Mary Schmich's graduation speech, known as "Wear Sunscreen", includes the lines:   "Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don't."   Even at times when I'm not sure about the exact career plan for the rest of my life, I still have a constant sense of purpose. My relationship with God, my call to be in relationship with others, and my groundedness in a lifestyle honouring God's intention for the earth.  The reading from Jeremiah 29 is a powerful one.   "I know what I am planning for you... "I have good plans for you, not plans to hurt you. I will give you hope and a good future".     We had that reading at our wedding - reflecting our belief that God's dream for our lives is good. It doesn't mean that bad things won't happen. But I believe that God's purposes are constantly reflecting God's goodness.   Once again, Mary Schmich's quote:    "Don't worry about the future. Or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind, the kind that blindside you at 4 pm on some idle Tuesday."    Rick Warren finishes by saying that living on purpose is the path to peace. I can attest to that.

       "Your birth was no mistake or mishap, and your life is no fluke of nature."  Rick Warren  "God doesn't play dice"  Albert Einstein    It's only day two and I'm running into trouble with Rick Warren's interpretation of life, the universe and everything. The idea that everything is designed by God is classic modernism - we'd like to think that God's in control of everything. That's OK if your life is going fine and you have a good chance at pulling through the hard times. What about if you're born in a hell hole, born with AIDS, suffering from congenital disease, crippled? Can we really say that's the way God intended it? It sounds like what one of Job's friends would have said.  What about the part in Romans 8 where Paul talks about the creation groaning for the full expression of God's way for the world? We're in a fragile world, full of chaos. People hurt. People hurt others. And as far as I can see in the Scriptures, that's not the way God intends it.  "There must be an underlying reality, a hidden variable"&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Albert Einstein said that God doesn't play dice with the universe. He thought that the apparent chaos being displayed in quantum physics experiments must have a hidden variable, an underlying design. But since that famous quote, further experiments indicate that Einstein was mistaken. God does appear to play dice with the universe. There is a huge amount of randomness that goes with the design. Patterns emerge in every aspect of life. But at the same time, within those patterns, there is room for the unpredictable.  Stephen Hawking covers this point in one of his lectures,  urlLink "Does God play dice?"   Having said that, I still agree that we are not accidents. Although there is a strong sense of chance in my development, God's purpose is strong throughout. I believe it when I hear God saying "I am your Creator. You were in my care even before you were born."  Isaiah 44:2 (CEV)    Question for the day from Rick, "I know that God uniquely created me. What areas of my personality, background, and physical appearance am I struggling to accept?"   I guess I'm struggling with the messiness of my lifestyle. I enjoy variety and thrive in that environment. But I don't fit easily into the tight structured demands of some situations. But I can accept that I am who I am, and look for God's purpose for me today.

      Rick Warren writes that there are two options for finding our purpose: Speculation and Revelation.    It's in Christ that we find out who we are and what we are living for. Long before we first heard of Christ and got our hopes up, he had his eye on us. had designs on us for glorious living, part of the overall purpose he is working outin everything and everyone.  (Ephesians 1:11, The Message)   From these notes from Paul, Rick draws three insights: 1. You discover your identity and purpose through a relationship with Jesus Christ. 2. God was thinking of you long before you ever thought about him. 3. The purpose of your life fits into a much larger, cosmic purpose that God has designed for eternity.  The question to consider today: "In spite of all the advertising around me, how can I remind myself that life is really about living for God, not myself?"  One of the phrases associated with The Highlander (Connor MacLeod and Duncan MacLeod in movies and TV series) is "There can be only one". One of my prayers is "You are the One" - a reminder that God's purpose is the agenda of my life, and not the other way round! Every now and then I use that prayer as a log on for the computer as I start work for the day.

        "Give yourselves to God... Surrender your whole being to him to be used for righteous purposes."  Romans 6:13    Rick Warren writes that the heart of worship is surrender.  Paul urges us to fully surrender our lives to God in worship: "So then, my friends, because of God's great mercy to us... offer yourselves as a living sacrifice to God, dedicated to his service and pleasing to him. This is the true worship that you should offer."  Note: It's good to see the writer of this verse acknowledged. For a lot of the book so far, we've been told that "The Bible tells us..."   Rick names two things that prevent us from surrendering our lives to God:  Fear: Can I trust God? Pride: Can I admit my limitations?   Can I trust God?  I'm occasionally surprised when people turn down an opportunity to meet with me in my consultancy work. Usually there's an agenda of hurt from the past. They believe I'll berate them or make them feel stupid. I guess I could if I wanted to. But my purpose in consultancy is to listen very carefully and fairly so that the organisation can build a good atmosphere for moving ahead together.   I think sometimes we find it hard to trust God because we've been hurt, let down, disappointed, or frustrated. If God cares about every detail of my life, why does he let me suffer? Why do unfair things happen? Those were the questions Job would have asked in his time of suffering. These questions have certainly crossed my mind a few times.  It boils down to what we're trusting God for. A bedridden woman asked me if she could trust God to protect her from intruders. I was stuck with that one. In all honesty, I knew she was vulnerable to harm like anyone. God doesn't give us immunity to harm just because we're children of the King. So what do we trust God for? Is just for an assurance of love, acceptance and concern? Or is there something deeper - a purpose drawn out of our experience.  Rick reminds us that surrender is not passive resignation, fatalism, or an excuse for laziness. He actually uses the phrase "God does not want robots to serve him" - a phrase that came to mind when dealing with his concept of instant obedience in Day 9.   I like the way surrender to God is linked with relationships and money. We don't always have to be in charge. We don't edge others out, demand our rights and self-serve when we're surrendered. Retirement in comfort is not the goal of a surrendered life. These are healthy challenges to the me-centred values of our time.  So how does this relate to the surrender of Jesus to the cross? Rick refers to Jesus' prayer in the garden of Gethsemane.  "Father, everything is possible for you. Please take this cup of suffering away from me. Yet I want your will, not mine."  Mark 14:36 ( urlLink New Living Translation )   Rick takes this a step further by telling us that genuine surrender says: "Father, if this problem, pain, sickness, or circumstance is needed to fulfill your purpose and glory in my life or in another's, please don't take it away."  I think we have permission to ask if God has any other way of achieving his purposes. After all Jesus asked. And I think generally, God does have a huge range of options. It's just that Jesus was the one who had to carry the load of the cross. No one else. I'm glad I don't have to step into Jesus' role. I am not the Messiah. (Something I remind myself when tempted to unthinkingly take on the expectations of others.)  Surrender for me is more often than not about letting go of responsibility rather than accumulating it. I'm happy to have a go at the inconvenient, unpopular, costly or seemingly impossible tasks. And I'm happy to do these in the spirit of worship to God.

        "May the Lord smile on you"  Numbers 6:25 (New Living Translation)   Rick Warren uses the life of Noah to illustrate how we can make God smile.  "Noah was a pleasure to the Lord"  Genesis 6:2   Noah loved God supremely.    "Noah consistently followed God's will and enjoyed a close relationship with Him."  Genesis 6:9b (New Living Translation)  The NRSV translation says,  "Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation. Noah walked with God."  The  urlLink New Living Translation  has put the Hebrew concepts of into classic Evangelical language.  Walking with God - that's the image I find helpful here. It implies that Noah's life with God was not linked with a daily quiet time - reading the Bible and praying about the day. He didn't have a Bible for starters. He had to find a way of living his life without blame - with integrity. Although I believe that our relationship with God is supreme, I don't think we can understand that relationship on the same level as the relationship between two people.    Noah trusted God completely.  This an interesting one. It's obvious that the in the story of Noah that he does get the ark built. But we don't know about the process. We don't know if Noah doubted, or if he complained, or if he made excuses. What counts is that eventually that ark was ready when the rains came.  I like Bill Cosby's take on the events:  Noah: 	Right ... Who is this really? What's going on? How come you want me to do all these weird things? God: 	I'm going to destroy the world. Noah: 	Right ... Am I on Candid Camera? How are you gonna do it? God: 	I'm going to make it rain for a thousand days and drown them right out. Noah: 	Right ... Listen, do this and you'll save water. Let it rain for forty days and forty nights and wait for the sewers to back up. God: 	Right...  That complete trust in God involved some conversation between Noah and God. It was not a case of blind trust.   Noah obeyed God wholeheartedly.  It's a big assumption to say, as Rick Warren does, that Noah didn't have any questions, objections or reservations. Where in the Bible does that come from?  I firmly believe that calling people to 'instant obedience' without understanding is dangerous and manipulative. This is the language of cults. Certainly there are some things we need to do without understanding all the subtleties. Forgiving someone can be an obedient action before the desire or attitude kicks in. But I don't think God treats us as robots who obey. Try ordering anyone around like that and see what happens.   God smiles when we praise and thank him continually.  Noah offers his sacrificed animal to God after he gets to dry land. Rick uses this act as a reminder that we are called to offer our thanks and praise to God, obviously avoiding the slaughter of animals as we do so.   A thankful attitude does make us more pleasant to be with. I'm sure God enjoys our thankfulness and appreciation.   Noah used his abilities.  Rick points out that those abilities included making love to his spouse, bringing up kids, planting crops and eating meals. He reminds us that God gains pleasure in watching us enjoy his creation, using all our senses. Amen to that.  I like the way Rick reminds us that God enjoys us at every point of our development. God is not an unpleasable teacher or parent.  Today's a helpful reminder to me that pleasing God is the highest priority of my life. I'm not here to curry favour with anyone. I'm here to live the life God calls me to. There is no shortage of people with a plan for my life. "Work this way. Speak this way. Apply for this position. Aspire to this ambition." I'm strengthened by the reminder that I'm living for God's pleasure.

        "You created everything, and it is for your pleasure that they exist and were created."  Revelation 4:11 (New Living Translation)   "The Lord takes pleasure in his people"  Psalm 149:4a   Every now and then I am stunningly reminded that God actually enjoys my life. What a difference this makes! Instead of an image of God the disapproving teacher saying "You could do much better than this Macleod", there's this image of God the parent who takes pleasure in every point of progress in my life. A God who marvels in the emerging creation. God who loves the intricacies of my innermost being.  This is a great way to start exploring worship. Worship as a delightful response to a delighting God. It's a reminder that we are not the only participants in worship. God is active far more than we are - its a 2-way experience. Worship is not just something we 'do'. It's something we take part in.  I appreciate Rick Warren's reminder that worship is far deeper, greater, and wider than the forms we associate it with. Like music. We can worship without ever singing a note. In my house church we don't have 'congregational singing'. But we certainly worship God in lots of other ways. I also appreciate Rick's reminder that worship is not for our benefit. I would say that there are many benefits to being in a worship experience. But we're there to be lovers of God rather than consumers of worship culture.  Rick tells us worship is not a part of our lives, it is our life. Excellent point. I like to talk about worship experiences when describing services of worship. Worship continues as we live our lives to the glory of God. It can be unconscious or conscious. We don't always have to be telling God, "Here I am to worship", to be true worshippers.  I found Rick's final illustration somewhat incomplete. He talks about when he first fell in love with his wife. He thought of her constantly through the day, during every activity. By constantly thinking of her, he was abiding in her love. He finishes the chapter by saying real worship is all about falling in love with Jesus. Well - I wonder if he thinks about his wife all day now. The emotional rush of discovering someone for the first time certainly encourages the preoccupation associated with falling in love. But what happens when the rush wears off?   I know there have been times in my life when I've been entranced by God. But at other times I've been anything but. But all the way through, I've loved God. Love is so much more than emotional rush. Love calls me to offer myself, completely, in my lifestyle, my attitudes, my response to my environment, my transparency before God, my delight of God. All in response to the God who loves me more than I could ever ever comprehend!

        "Everything comes from God alone. Everything lives by his power, and everything is for his glory"  Romans 11:36 (Living Bible)   As a young Presbyterian I grew up with the  urlLink Shorter catechism  of the Westminster Confession. It was a question and answer way of helping people learn doctrine, or be indoctrinated. I learned the first one indelibly:  "What is the chief end of Man? The chief end of Man is to glorify God and enjoy him forever".  Every now and then there'd be a slip of the tongue and we'd say "glorify God and endure him forever".  In this chapter Rick Warren introduces us to the concept of glorifying God and not glorifying God (sin). He introduces us to the five purposes he's found in the Scriptures that apply to everybody:  1. We bring God glory by worshipping him. 2. We bring God glory by loving other believers. 3. We bring God glory by becoming like Christ. 4. We bring God glory by serving others with our gifts. 5. We bring God glory by telling others about him.  We're invited to believe God loves us and made us for his purposes, believe we're not accidents, believe we were made to last forever, believe God has chosen us to have a relationship with Jesus, who died on the cross for us. We're invited to receive Jesus into our lives as our Lord and Saviour, receive his forgiveness, receive his Spirit, who will give us the power to fulful our life purpose.  The question to consider today:  "Where in my daily routine can I become more aware of God's glory?"  I see God's glory reflected in God's creation everyday - I need to remember to stop and 'smell the daisies'. I experience God's glory as I rub shoulders with my fellow travellers each day. Makes a difference to the way I see the other people on the motorway. I experience God's glory as I offer every part of my routine to serve God.  I think the glory of God is something that bursts outside the bounds of the church. It breaks into my homelife - even in the middle of domestic squabbles over who washes up. The glory of God surprises me in the people who reflect the character of Jesus even though they're not keen on professing Christian faith. The glory of God turns up on TV every now and then - when people profess their beliefs and values in public.

        "Lord, remind me how brief my time on earth will be. Remind me that my days are numbered, and that my life is fleeing away."  Psalm 39:4 (New Living Translation)   This is the third metaphor for life Rick draws from the Bible. The idea of being a sojourner, alien, pilgrim, foreigner, stranger, visitor, and traveller - it rings true to me. I see many images in the scripture, many stories, in which the people of God are reminded that their ultimate destiny lies in a place beyond their present dreams.  I've been in Australia as permanent resident for three and a bit years, though I haven't yet taken out citizenship. I still feel as though New Zealand is my home. But Australia is not enemy territory. I feel no guilt about cheering for Australian athletes and swimmers. Though I do still support the  urlLink All Blacks , the  urlLink Auckland Warriors , and the  urlLink Otago Highlanders .  I'm a sojourner living here as long as I'm called to be here. For all I know, that could be another three years, or another forty three years. But in the meantime, I'm putting down roots. I've bought a house. I'm making friends. I'm learning the language, and adapting my accent.  Rick Warren uses the scenario of becoming ambassador to an enemy nation. He says we'd need to learn the local language, adapt to some customs and cultural differences in order to be polite and accomplish our mission. But if we fell in love with the new nation, we'd become a traitor, acting like the enemy.   Good point. Though I'd be careful in applying that scenario to life on earth. The kingdom of God is not limited to life beyond death. Eternity starts right here and now - in the context in which we live right here on earth. I believe we're living in God's zone - in created territory, not occupied territory.   The conflict in values comes when we succumb to the assumptions that are against God's values. Like when we place higher value on possessions and status than on people and relationships.  I'm very aware that our time on this planet is limited. My father died of heart failure at 73, my mother at 79. She would have died at 70 if not for a heart valve operation. I'm 42 - over halfway through a natural life expectancy. I could go any time in the meantime though. I sat with a friend over an afternoon while his heart stopped working every 45 minutes or so. That was last year. He's not old. My own daughter died at 18 months. On her tombstone we engraved: "We are fragile beings living in a dangerous world"  So we're here for a temporary assignment. But an intentional embedded assignment. A bit like the Jewish people receiving Jeremiah's letter in Jeremiah 29. He says that God arranged for them to be taken to this country, Babylon. They need to put down their roots, plant gardens and build homes. They need to encourage their children to marry and have children, right there where they live. They need to pray for the success of their city and nation. But they are never to forget that God will bring their descendants back to Jerusalem. Their long term destiny is not tied up with this place.  This all makes a difference to the way we treat our environment, our neighbours, and our own bodies. I want to work on a lifestyle that promotes the kind of world God dreams of - right here in Australia, as much as in New Zealand and the rest of this planet.

        "We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are"   urlLink Anais Nin  (author of avant-garde novels)   Rick Warren asks what image would come to your mind if asked how you picture life. This image is your 'life metaphor'. He writes about a few life metaphors he's been shown by people:  Life is a roller coaster  (Ronan Keating's song)  Life is a circus  (David Bowie's song - never officially released - as well as the 1962 movie of the same name, AND, a Charlie Brown movie!)  Life is a minefield  (as said by Raoul Felder, divorce lawyer, in his book,  urlLink Bare Knuckle Negotiation )  Life is a symphony  (Frances Murphy's book)  Life is a journey ,  Life is a dance, Life is a carousel   Life is a game of cards  (Eugene Hare)  And there's others not listed in Warren's book: Life is a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get (Forrest Gump) Life is a joke Life is a drama Life is a dream  urlLink Life is a lottery  (John Shakespeare on genetics) and  urlLink Life is a beach    Rick then goes on to tell us the Bible presents three metaphors that teach us God's view of life: Life is a test, Life is a trust, and life is a temporary assignment.   "Unless you are faithful in small matters, you won't be faithful in large ones."    Luke 16:10a (NLT)  Rick's question: "What has happened to me recently that I now realize was a test from God?"  Ricks suggests that we will be tested by major changes, delayed promises, impossible problems, unanswered prayers, undeserved criticism, and even senseless tragedies. Every time we pass a test God notices and makes plans to reward us in eternity. Rick quotes the letter of James:  "Blessed are those that endure when they are tested. When they pass the test, they will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him."  I agree that God is deeply interested in how I respond to the circumstances of my life. At times I grow in maturity. At times I stumble. God is watching, waiting for me to get up each time. That's why I prefer the metaphor of a race or journey. This is not a pass/fail test that determines my "grade in heaven". It's an ongoing marathon of endurance that calls for every bit of 'up and go' God can inspire in me.  Paul in 1 Corinthians 10:13 says God will not allow us to be tested beyond our power to remain firm.  "At the time you are put to the test, he will give you the strength to endure it, and so provide you with a way out."   I know Paul endured a lot of suffering and came through still a strong believer. However I have seen many people fall out under pressure. Some people lose their sanity. Others lose their faith. I think Jesus was closer to the truth in his story of the sower and the seeds. In some cases growth is choked out by competition (weeds) or pecked out by oppression (birds).  Rick uses the metaphor of trust - telling us that God gives us three rewards of affirmation, promotion and celebration in eternity. This is based on Jesus' story of the businessman giving responsibilities to three employees. Rick then invites us to ask ourselves, "What are the greatest matters God has entrusted to me?" I would consider those greatest matters of trust to be core relationships - with my wife and kids. Gifts and abilities. Income. Capacity for influence in the church and community. Time.

       "The Lord has hidden himself from his people, but I trust him and place my hope in him." Isaiah 8:17 (TEV)   Rick Warren writes today, "God is real, no matter how you feel." He goes on to make a reference to Phil Yancey's book, " urlLink Reaching for the Invisible God ."   Phil writes:    "Any relationship involves times of closeness and times of distance, and in a relationship with God, no matter how intimate, the pendulum will swing from one side to the other."    I remember back in the late 1970s when I first got involved in the charismatic movement - there was a strong emphasis on being able to feel the experience of the Holy Spirit. Intimacy was cast in terms of joy and peace and feelings of praise and love. Looking back I think that as wonderful as such experiences are, it is dangerous to base a framework of faith on those. Such experiences, and I've had a few of them over time, are great bonuses. But I wouldn't describe them as the measures of my spirituality. I appreciate the reassurances from St John of the Cross and Henri Nouwen and other contemplatives - feeling distant from God is par for the course at times.  I don't think the feeling of being distant from God is God testing us. It's more about the way we're wired psychologically.   Rick's advice for people feeling distant from God is grounded in the experience of Job's suffering:  Tell God exactly how you feel. Focus on who God is - his unchanging nature. Trust God to keep his promises. Remember what God has already done for you.  I think also that yesterday's advice applies here. Sometimes we are left numb by a spirituality culture that just doesn't cut it. If you're inspired by works of art and nature and need to respond visually, more sermons about being saved from going to hell may lead to a sense of inner dryness. If you're an introvert, attending large scale worship services are likely to leave you emotionally stranded.  Another angle is spiritual burnout. Pleasure loses its power when it becomes a matter of routine or obligation. "You must" is one of the biggest turn offs I've ever seen in the church.  I appreciate C.S. Lewis writing about God being hidden in " urlLink A Grief Observed ". Terry Falla writes it as:  Why, in terms of grief and distress, when there is no light in the window, do we find a door slammed in our face, and a sound of bolting and double bolting on the inside?"   Terry Falla goes on to write:   "Know this, God, know this: if faith were dependent on feelings, if our trust in you were no more than a matter of the mind, we would be done with you, done with you forever.   And hear this God, hear this: if it were not for that man who was friend of the poor and the damned, for that man who healed the sick and gave sight to the blind... If it were not for that man whom we cursed and crucified, and who is crucified still, for that man bore our griefs and carried our sorrows, and who carries them still... God, God eternal, God of Jesus, God who said yes to life, his love, his suffering, his death, God of the cross, crucified God, sharing our pain, bearing our sin... If it were not, O God, for you, for you our lover, you our judge, you our hope, you our friend... We would be lost."  Be Our Freedom, Lord,  urlLink Open Book Publishers , Adelaide, 1994 (Published in USA by  urlLink Concordia Publishing House )

       Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.  Mark 12:30 (New International Version)    Rick's unpacking good worship today.    God is pleased when our worship is accurate.  "Worship in truth".    God is pleased when our worship is authentic.  Rick refers to  urlLink Gary Thomas'  book, "Sacred Pathways" in which he identifies nine ways people draw near to God: 1. Naturalists inspired outdoors 2. Sensates inspired by multisensory environment 3. Traditionalists inspired by rituals, liturgies, symbols 4. Ascetics inspired by solitude and simplicity 5. Activists inspired in context of making the world a better place 6. Caregivers love God by loving others 7. Enthusiasts love God through celebration 8. Contemplatives love God through adoration 9. Intellectuals love God by studying with their minds   God is pleased when our worship is thoughtful  - something we can understand and others can understand as well.   God is pleased when our worship is practical  - linked with action in our lives.   What's more important to God right now? My private or public worship?  I think they're linked with each other - and feed each other.

       Draw close to God, and God will draw close to you. James 4:8 (New Living Translation)    Rick Warren gives us a few more pointers for growing our friendship with God today.  If I want a deeper, more intimate connection with God:    I must choose to be honest with God.  I like the line: "What appears as aduacity, God views as authenticity. God listens to the passionate words of his friends; he is bored with predictable, pious cliches."  The psalms are full of honest outpourings of faith and doubt, praise and complaint. Its a model I appreciate. Though of course its hard to do it in public without affecting other people.   I must choose to obey God in faith.   Rick points out that progress in friendship with God is linked closely to doing something about what God says. Ties right in with what Jesus says about hearing his words and acting on them.   I must choose to value what God values.  Rick links this with a passion for people - evangelism etc. That's certainly a part of God's values. And there's much more...   I must desire friendship with God more than anything else.  Rick points to the passion of David, Jacob, Paul. Its no coincidence that these three guys had their share of pain in their lives. Rick says not to be surprised when God allows pain in our lives, quoting C.S. Lewis, "Pain is God's megaphone." I believe that pain is not a personal jab from God. It's part of being human. But I believe that God can bring us closer - or that we're sometimes more motivated to seek God when we're in pain. Unless of course that pain is so overpowering we lose the capacity to be aware of anything beyond the pain itself.  In summary, Rick is reminding me that friendship with God is stimulated by my choices. I am choosing to share faith and pray with people regularly as a way of growing friendship with God.

       Since we were restored to friendship with God by the death of his Son while we were still his enemies, we will certainly be delivered from eternal punishment by his life. Romans 5:10 (New Living Translation)   Rick Warren in today's chapter reminds us that Jesus invites us into an intimate relationship of friendship with God.  I was a young teenager when the wonder of this invitation almost knocked me over. I was cycling to catch the bus to high school. Where I lived we were a mile away from the bus stop. As I came down the final straight I was looking directly at the snow-covered mountain range, the Takitimus. I was amazed at the spectacular vista - and I almost fell off my bike as I realised that the creator of this mountain range and the whole universe, was accessible to me in an intimate friendship!  Rick draws on Brother Lawrence today for insights into the contemplative life of prayer for the busy follower of Christ.  There's a web site dedicated to Brother Lawrence's material, with a downloadable copy of "Practicing the Presence of God" -  urlLink  www.practicegodspresence.com    Rick draws on Brother Lawrence's practice as a busy monk, learning to pray throughout the day while continuing his work. The first step, Rick writes, is to change our attitude so that we don't separate spiritual and practical. Everything we do we can include God. That, of course, assumes that you can pray without speaking aloud!  Another learning from Brother Lawrence is to make our prayer nice and short - more like the conversations we usually hold. That assumes we don't have monologues with our friends where we do all the talking and they put up with us! :>)  Brother Lawrence: Practicing the Presence of God  The second technique for building friendship with God today is Continual Meditation - focused thinking about God's word. I know and Rick knows that many Christians have an inbuilt suspicion of the word 'meditation'. It reminds people of new age and Eastern mystic movements in which people empty their minds and chant mantras. But Christianity has a long deep tradition of people growing closer in their friendship with God through constant reflection on God's word and its application to our lives. Once again the key is keeping it short. That's why Scripture in Song was so popular in the 1980s - it gave people a good excuse for repeating Scriptures over and over again.    What can I do to remind myself to think about God and talk to him more often throughout the day?   I like to use symbols to remind me of God's presence in my life. Like a cross cut of wood reminding me to center myself in Jesus. Unfortunately unless it travels with me all day I forget it. Maybe something attached to my keyring - reminding me of Christ's constant presence. Yep - I'll find something like that.

       "No matter what I say, what I believe, and what I do, I'm bankrupt without love." 1 Corinthians 13:3b (The Message)   Rick lays it on the line today: Life is all about relationships. Everything else is secondary. The two big mandates given by God - love God and love others as we love ourselves.  And the challenge for followers of Jesus? Loving his people.   Life without love is really worthless.  This is where the quote above comes in. You can be great at anything, but without love you are nothing.  Larry Norman picked that up in his song, Righteous Rocker, way back in the 1970s. Lauryn Hill did in the 1990s.    Love will last forever.  Love leaves a legacy. Rick talks about being at the bedside of people as they die. They don't call for their diplomas, they call for the ones they love. I've seen that too. But I've seen people dying who have during their lives have lost the capacity to love and be loved. It is tragic. There is so much truth in the catch cry of Moulin Rouge: The greatest thing is to love and to be loved in return.    We will be evaluated on our love.  This is a challenge. We don't take our bodies, achievements, doctrine or education beyond death. It all gets left behind. It is our character that marks us as who we are. And that character is almost entirely to do with how we relate to other people. True, true.   The best expression of love is time  - focused attention, Rick says. I wonder how that relates to the five languages of love: quality time, gifts, loving touch, affirmation, practical service. Rick tells us that what really counts is what we give of  ourselves.

        "God is the One who made all things, and all things are for his glory. He wanted to have many children share his glory."  Hebrews 2:10a (New Century Version)   "See how very much our heavenly Father loves us, for he allows us to be called his children, and we really are!"  1 John 3:1 (New Living Translation)   "God's unchanging plan has always been to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to himself through Jesus Christ. And this gave him great pleasure."  Ephesians 1:5 (New Living Translation)   A good start - using translations  that emphasise the relationship we have as children of God - not just 'sons of God'.   We enter the privilege of being in God's family through faith in Jesus. That invitation is open to everyone. Its a universal invitation that needs a response.  Rick draws our attention to the benefits of being in God's family: The family inheritance: being with God forever, being completely changed to be like Christ, being freed from all pain, death and suffering, being rewarded and reassigned positions of service, and sharing in Christ's glory.  Rick then goes on to remind us that baptism publicly announces our membership of God's family. He describes the instant baptisms of the Ethiopian eunuch, the 3000 on the day of Pentecost, and the Philippian jailer and his family. In other words, "don't put it off". A bit simplistic I think to say baptism must happen immediately. More of this 'instant obedience' thing. Though I think people can procrastinate on the baptism issue. But for generations of people rightly sceptical about the number of once-converted now backslidden or ineffective born-agains, baptism is like marriage - not to be entered into lightly.

        Friday - another day in Paradise with temperatures of 27 degrees Celsius. We're looking at heading into the Queensland outback this weekend - just a short two day trip inland to St George and Cunnamulla. Ennis wants to experience driving for hours without seeing anyone - the ultimate introvert pasttime. She's got some books on CD to play on the way, out of the local library.   Another find in the generations angle yesterday - material by  Henk A. Becker of Utrecht University . Becker's a sociologist looking at the impact of generational change, particularly in the area of digitial technology. He's published some of his material in the  urlLink Club de Budapest in France .    Talked to our daughter Merrin (14) in Japan last night. She's having a great time over there with her school group. She's off to Hiroshima this weekend - has been busy making paper cranes. Lachlan (16) has had some friends over to stay - they're busy making software and using others. Caitlin (8) is on her 3rd read through Lord of The Rings, and has breaks by playing Age of Empires II and visiting her friends. I had an SMS conversation with my younger brother yesterday in NZ - over theories on holes in the ozone layer.

       2nd Go at Blogging  Thursday - working from home today - sharpening up a proposal for a D.Min dissertation on generational culture, theological reflection and ministry formation.   Generations, Culture and Society.  Last night I found a decent study on generational theory from a sociological perspective - written by June Edmund & Bryan S. Turner, sociologists at Cambridge University, UK. What looks so good about this material is that it provides a reflection on Karl Mannheim's theory of 'generational cohort' that is not based in the USA, and looks at applications to gender, race and ethnicity.

        I've just started another blog - Duncan's Ad Land - focusing on TV adverts online -  urlLink http://.tvadverts.blogspot.com    In the meantime, here's more on the generational research...   urlLink Gathering The Next Generations : A project for Episcopalian clergy in the United States, born between 1961 and 1981.  There's a book of the same name edited by Nathan Humphrey - a collection of essays well worth reading. For an online review check out the Alban Institute Congregations Journal  urlLink review by Bonnie Perry   The first section deals with issues surrounding the process for selecting and training the church's clergy as they relate to Generation X. The second section looks at curacy as mentoring, campus ministries and bivocational ministry. The third section looks at four groups whose presence in the ordained ministry has grown significantly in GenX: Xers, African Americans, Gay/Lesbian/Bi/Transexual persons, and women. The fourth section addresses issues directly related to parish ministry by members of Generation X.   urlLink Gathering the Next Generation, available from Amazon   Gathering the Next Generation: Essays on the Formation and Ministry of GenX Priests&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

        urlLink Postmission  was put together by a group of Gen X leaders of mission organisations, mostly from the UK, who gathered for a week's retreat. I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of thought developed here. It was helpful to have theories grounded in stories of mission organisations. Not too many books of this type actually engage with source material by postmodernists such as Foucault, Lyotard and Deleuze. I appreciate the application of workplace generational approaches to mission organisations. Published by Paternoster Press, UK, 2002, edited by Richard Tiplady.   Here's a note from  urlLink OC Books  in Dunedin, NZ... It's axiomatic that Generation Xers tend to fit less easily into the older cultures of the church, and that includes missionary organisations.   This book asks, if Generation Xers were to do mission their way, what would it look like?   Are new strategies, structures and methodologies needed or can what already exists be changed to allow the Xer worldview to exist alongside others? This book is written for existing mission leaders and boards, and for those who wish to bring change within their organisations as a response to culture change in the West, and in the world.    At times provocative, often wise, it's well worth a look even for issues apart from mission-orientated ones. The ten contributors include one New Zealander, Bevan Herangi.   urlLink Postmission.com - An International forum on Christian mission in Postmodernity   PostMission the Book&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

       Another book from Fuzz Kitto's library I hadn't seen before.  Written in 1998 and published by  urlLink Blackwell Publishers  in the UK.  Epstein provides a helpful introduction to Generation X, youth culture and identity. I was fascinated with Steven Best and Douglas Kellner's article on "Beavis and Butt-Head" - they look at the impact of popular TV media on youth. Other topics in the book include sexuality & body politics, education, industrial-hard core music subculture, deadhead subculture, rave scene, punk and cyberpunk, gender in Canadian heavy metal music, and amateur stripping.   urlLink Youth Culture: Identity in a Postmodern World &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

       When it comes to popular theory on generational development and the future, many people think of William Strauss and Neil Howe. Their first book,  urlLink Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584-2069 , came out in 1991.  urlLink 13th Gen: Abort, Retry, Ignore, Fail?  came out in 1993.  urlLink The Fourth Turning  was first published in 1996.   urlLink Millennials Rising: The Next Great Generation  hit the bookshops in 2000.  Strauss and Howe use the generation theories developed by Ortega y Gasset  and Julian Marias  (both from Spain). They base their work on the idea that there are four types of generational cohorts cycling through history. Each generation lasts about 20 years. Critiques of this approach ask whether major shifts in worldview will affect these generations - shifts such as postmodernism and technology revolution. Another questions links to the American/European bias of their work. What about Asian, African and Oceanic cultures? Their web site provides a chance to engage with the authors. Are these historians/futurists treating the masses as mindless pawns of fate? It seems very similar to the psychohistory used by Hari Sheldon in Isaac Asimov's Foundation series.   urlLink www.lifeassociates.com ,  urlLink www.fourthturning.com ,  urlLink www.millennialsrising.com     urlLink    Books by William Strauss and Neil Howe&nbsp; urlLink

       Webber's material on worship, generations, faith and evangelicalism provide a useful commentary on trends in North America, UK and down under. His book, "The Younger Evangelicals", published 2002, is a bit like Dave Tomlinson's " urlLink The Post-Evangelical " coming to America. As much as I find it hard to sit comfortably with some of his sweeping generalisations, I think Webber has done a good job of painting an emerging landscape of younger generations of church leaders on the edge. He writes about three streams of evangelicals: "traditional" evangelicals (1950-1975), "pragmatic" evangelicals (1975-2000) and younger evangelicals (2000-). Some of the shifts described are: propositionalism to narrative, rationalism to embodiment, market to mission, power to servanthood, information to formation, program to narrative, constraint to expression, rallies to relationship, and theory to action.  urlLink Ancient Future Worship, Christian worship resources books and videos     Robert E.

It's designed as an accessible introduction to what Kimball calls "Post-Seeker-Sensitive" approaches to being church. Kimball's "Vintage Faith" approach provides one practical example of what Robert Webber has been calling "Ancient-Future" church and worship. Rather than throwing out religious symbols and toning down focus on commitment, Kimball's group of postmoderns are exploring radical discipleship in a multi-sensory environment.    urlLink www.vintagefaith.com    Dan Kimball preaching, and his book The Emerging Church.

        I'm on a discussion list for the  urlLink Uniting Church in Australia, Queensland Synod . Tomorrow morning we're beginning our Synod meeting on the Sunshine Coast. I'm responsible for the 51 small groups. On the agenda will be theological education. A task group have written a report outlining the importance of theological education happening in evangelism, equipping lay ministry, and in resourcing those equip congregations.   I wrote the following to the list in response to this queston:   "I hear a great deal about a new paradigm or a paradigm shift in relation to being church. I have not yet seen any attempt to frame this description in theological terms and I am at a loss to understand what people are seeking to describe when they refer to this paradigm change or new paradigm."    ---------------------  Re emerging paradigms in relation to being church, I think we can see some emerging trends. I'd like to start the ball rolling with some provocation from Loren Mead, author of Once and Future Church.   urlLink Loren Mead  in his book  urlLink Five Challenges for the Once and Future Church  outlines five emerging paradigm shifts.   1. Transfer the ownership of the Church  Mead here is responding to the fact up to now the church has been owned by the clergy. That is one huge factor in the way we train ministers. We may say we believe in the priesthood of all believers, but what really counts, in the mainstream paradigm of the Uniting Church, is the equipping of ordained preachers and pastors. What we see happening around the world is a growing sense of collaboration with a wide variety of local leaders. Specified ministries are being redefined as collaborative ministries rather than the practices of sole practitioners.   2. Find new structures to carry our faith  This one's directly related to the report of the Mission and Service Fund Task Group. Mead points out that in many cases congregations and their leaders are fulfilling what used to be the role of denominations. We see the development of teaching and resourcing congregations such as Hillsong, Saddleback and Willow Creek. We have our own examples with Redcliffe, Robina and Logan. Mead reminds us of the growing distrust in centralised institutional structures. And of course we can't afford the complexity of overheads we've had in the past. We're at an institutional dead end. Mead encourages us as a denomination to learn from the small struggling 'threshold' congregations who are leading the way in thriving with fewer resources.   3. Discover a passionate spirituality  Mead calls for the mainline churches to integrate the gifts of the ordered, structured approach to spirituality with the those of the vital, enthusiastic Spirit-filled approach. "Because we cannot begin to imagine the challenges that will face those who will live in the twenty first century, the spirituality we have - traditional or charismatic - will not suffice."   4. Feed the world's need for community  Mead suggests that local congregations (particularly in cities) need to rediscover the power of being a Christian community founded in the Biblical grounds of our being. He says our congregations also have the function of being a generator of community that offers intimacy in house-church and small group settings.   5. Become an apostolic people (not just an apostolic church)  Mead says we've fallen into the trap of treating the ordinary member of the church as 'client of the clergy'. We need to rediscover the sense of each member being a mission agent in their context. "Instead of maintaining a theology of the academy, we need an emerging theology born in the people's engagement with God's mission in the world."

       Mike Regele of  urlLink Percept  published  urlLink Death of the Church  in 1996. That's eight years ago. Mike's a Presbyterian minister living in Irvine, California, and serves as a consultant for churches for churches, regional & national denominational bodies helping them with community and congregational profiles and planning programs.   In his 1996 book, Mike explores changes in generational culture, church culture as well as broad shifts such as postmodernism. He says that we can die because of our hidebound resistance to change, or we can die in order to live. He provides six commitments that would make the second option possible: 1. Understand dynamics of change at work today in our culture 2. Understand various faces of change emerging as we prepare to step into 21st century 3. Accept that traditional place of institutional church in our society is dying, and with it the institutional church itself 4. Let our traditional forms & structures that are the foundation of the institutional church die 5. Wrestle to forge new ways to proclaim Gospel in changing world 6. Revision the church for 21st century – at all levels, from the local congregation to national denominational church office.  Regele takes the work of Strauss and Howe on generational cycles and challenges the church to consider how current movements have responded to dynamics within emerging generations. The coming cycle, he contends, will need to focus on 'doing faith' - practical incarnational expressions that people can take part in. The charismatic renewal was just right for the inner spirituality of the boomers. Now we need to see the building of new movements and organisations that make an impact on society.  Having applied the generational cycle as almost a given, Regele goes on to introduce the unknown, chaotic force of postmodernity as sweeps through like a tidal wave. He says that changes of this order make future generational culture hard to predict.   Regele approaches modernity and postmodernity through the metaphor of 'bombproof certainty'. This certainty is an issue for people in a modernist framework but not for postmoderns. He provides a useful continuum for understanding the breadth of postmodern thought in this area: the span between the postmodern constructivist - all reality merely a construction of the mind, and the postmodern objectivist - relative certainty without burden of absolute certitude).  The most stirring part of the book was Regele's call for a new generation of moral-visionary leadership. He says that the church growth movement is often focusing leaders on technique in order to fill churches. Regele says we need people with an ability to think big and bold, with the courage to face a world antagonistic to the church. "We have taken Jesus' model of servant leadership and reduced it to insipid peonage". He asks if the church will let leaders lead, or drive them out? He warns, however, that some leaders appear to be visionary, but are driven more by consumptive ambition than moral passion.  Mike has also written  urlLink Robust Church Development : A Vision for Mobilizing Regional Bodies in Support of Missional Congregations. He co-authored  urlLink Crossing the Bridge : Church Leadership in a Time of Change, with Alan Roxburgh.  Mike Regele's book, Death of the Church&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

       Thom Rainer is dean of the Billy Graham School of Missions, Evangelism and Church Growth at the  urlLink Southern Baptist Theological Seminary  in Louisville, Kentucky.  In his book,  urlLink The Bridger Generation , published in 1996, he describes the generation who have eclipsed the 'Busters'. This generation, he writes, were born between 1977 and 1994 and are the largest generation in the United States.  My first reaction in reading this was a slight resentment that Generation X were being squeezed into a small time frame, thus discounting their significance for the future. Forget them, pay attention to the next generation. Not a helpful approach as far as I was concerned. I guess his readership in 1996 would have been Boomers who were concerned about their teenage kids. There are some useful angles to Rainer's material. At the end of each chapter he explores the response of the church to the realities faced by the Bridgers. He tackles the apathy expressed by many churches who think that young people are just too hard to work with. Like many Evangelical Boomer authors, Rainer tends to paint the emerging culture in dark hues. I was disappointed in some of the responses suggested by Rainer - they seemed like more of the same 'reach these young people with the Bible" without consideration of what form the Christian gospel might take if it was to be grown up in the emerging culture of Bridgers. Rainer draws heavily on observations by Susan Mitchell's  urlLink Official Guide to Generations ,  urlLink American Demographics , Walt Mueller  urlLink Understanding Youth Culture , Edward Cornish of  urlLink Futurist Magazine  and George Barna ( urlLink Generation Next ).

       Dawson McAllister, radio talk back host with teenagers in the States, published his 1999 book, "Saving the Postmillenial Generation: New Ways to Reach the Teenagers You Love in These Uncertain Times". It's out of print now but still available secondhand on the net -  urlLink Amazon  lists places you can obtain it secondhand and new.  McAllister begins with his experience of speaking engagements in which young people clearly don't trust him as a speaker. He realises that he's encountering a generation with changing values. He explores the broad changes these young people are experiencing because of life experiences and global philosophical movements. He draws on Strauss and Howe (see April 29) to map out the development of the Millennial Generation.  This is a good example of a writer doing his theological reflection on his ministry, drawing on his own experience, learning from sociological frameworks, reading the generational culture of the people he works with. There are plenty of opportunities to listen to these teenagers on his talkback show. Dawson recognises that what he's doing is cross-cultural mission, requiring patience and humility. At times he awfulizes the music and movies of youth culture - maybe its his teenage callers who are doing it for him. He does get a bit defensive about the attitudes of postmoderns toward reality and truth - he's clearly concerned about Millennials' perception of conservative evangelicals. The book finishes with a group discussion process, equipping his readers to do their own reflection on generational change and the church's response. Dawson McAllister provides a living model for the spirituality-focused ministry he advocates in the book. His online "Prayer Room" is an interactive forum for Millennials and leaders from the Gen X, Boomer and older generations.  urlLink www.dawsonmcallister.com  or  urlLink www.theprayerroom.com   Dawson McAllister on the cover of his book, Saving the Millennial Generation&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

First one to get the show rolling...    urlLink Fallon   I like this advertising company! It was started by Patrick Fallon and 4 partners in 1981, and has attracted the services of top directors such as Ridley and Tony Scott. In their self-description: "Fallon is a creativity company committed to generating disproportionate results for our clients through a unique combination of rigor, relentlessness, and surprise."  Here's a few of their creations:   urlLink  BMWFilms   is one of the most amazing efforts in advertising to date - an internet series featuring digital quality films streamed to your computer. Its a series of short films with a plot - the second series has attracted glowing reviews and is visited by millions online.  urlLink  EDS, Electronic Data Systems  , sold themselves as a company with flair through  urlLink  Fallon's Catherding advert   during the American SuperBowl season. Fallon have kept the adverts coming - look around the site to find the plane being assembled in the sky as its flying! The Catherding video (10.4 MB) was originally on the EDS site and recorded thousands of downloads. They've removed it to make room for their new online adverts. Isn't it great that Fallon have put it on their site!

      Earlier in 2003 Levi Strauss developed a TV advert for Levi 501 jeans - made it in Australia and tryed it in NZ. The ad , featuring a woman being baptised in her underwear and coming out of the water wearing jeans,  was banned in New Zealand because it was considered inappropriate use of religious imagery.  No one appeared to be upset in Australia. If anything, I would have thought people here just didn't realise that it was religious. The advert was online at  urlLink www.levis.com.au  or  urlLink www.levis.co.nz    (It has now been replaced by other advertising campaigns)   We used the advert at aCross Dimensions in September, a gathering of young adults on the Gold Coast to explore Christian faith using contemporary culture.

      Thanks to  urlLink Darren  for guiding us to the online site of the BTAA Awards. Begins with a snazzy shockwave flash interaction. Check out both the BTAA Awards and the Craft Awards. There are some real gems here.  There is something sublime about British Television - that is totally blown away by the crassness of the occasional advert - cf the gymnastics ad Darren warns us not to watch without getting an image stuck in the mind we're not keen to keep! Having said that, there are some beautiful insights to be had at the BTAA site. The Honda adverts remind us not to take invention and ingenuity for granted. Playstation puts the mirror up to the desire to win - was it my imagination or are most of those people in the human pile male? The BBC ad reminds us of the people behind a music style - not just the players but the listeners.  urlLink BTAA - British Television Advertising Awards

      David Ogilvy started this advertising company back in 1948 and has built up a reputation for quality and imagination.  Everytime you refresh the main home page for Ogilvy you get to read another of David's quotes. Like "Unless your campaign contains a Big Idea, it will pass like a ship in the night". "You cannot bore people into buying a product, you can only interest them into buying it."  I also like their commitment to "360 degree brand stewardship" in which every point of contact makes an impact.  Click on "Our Work" to have a look at shockwave flash showcase of Ogilvy work.

      American Express have taken a fascinating approach to advertising with the online (Flash required) adventures of Jerry Seinfeld (himself) and Superman (as cartoon).  The site below takes you to a New York apartment with an interactive environment and a screen set up for video projection. The first movie, Uniform, is set in New York. Jerry and Superman watch some ice hockey, visit a restaurant, buy a DVD player, apprehend a thief and take in a song and dance show - "Yes Wyoming". Seinfeld has long been a fan of the Man of Steel, with oblique references to him in several of his TV episodes. He made a Superbowl TV advert for Amex back in 1998 with Superman as well. This time only the teasers are on TV - the 'real thing' is online.

      Australia has a unique campaign developed in response to a deep cynicism about Volvo drivers. "Bloody Volvo driver" is a phrase relating to drivers so confident in the safety of their vehicle they treat other drivers' safety with contempt.  EuroRSCG Australia developed a campaign around the contemptuous phrase, hoping to turn it round to one of envy. Advertising commentators were skeptical for some time. This could so easily have backfired. Volvo's sales were already dipping. But it appears the ads helped reverse the trend - people starting thinking about volvos for a younger generation. The set of TV ads is on the EuroRSCG Australia site as shockwave flash animations ranging from 428 kb to 1.3 MB. Also here are ads for Orange, Intel and NineMSN.  urlLink EuroRSCG ||Australian TV ads

"Warm Your Cockles!"  You Need Fur - from Junior for Colorado&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      urlLink Colorado  is an Australian brand known mostly in Oz for quality shoes and boots. They're now promoting their casual range of clothes.   Junior is an advertising agency in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia - known for its fresh young approach. They've described their campaign for Colorado as follows:   THE NEW EXCITING EXTREME SPORT - RETAILING The world of fashion has often been called aloof and cold. Colorado on the other hand is a brand with spirit. A real, cheeky, spontaneous spirit. The spirit of travel. How do you convey that unrestrained joy of life when you’re working within the rather cynical and contrived world of advertising? Particularly retail advertising? With larger than life ideas, of course.   Don't overlook the little gems in all the archives of the Diarrhoea section on the Junior web site.

      Thanks to  urlLink Andrew  for this link:   Even before Mel Gibson grabbed hearts and headlines with  urlLink The Passion of The Christ , Christians were finding a new fascination with the spiritual significance they're encountering at the multiplex. Every month sees a new film-and-faith book hit the shelves, film clips are showing up in Sunday sermons like never before, and believers gather in study groups where the VCR and DVD player are almost as important to the proceedings as Bible or concordance. Jesus "spake not except in parables," and the spiritual impact of story didn't end with Christ.   urlLink   The folks at  urlLink Arts &amp; Faith , an online discussion group comprised of film critics—including Christianity Today Movies critics Jeffrey Overstreet, Peter T. Chattaway and myself—and other movie buffs have been carrying on a lively conversation about spirituality and film for years. Recently, the participants forged a terrifically diverse and intriguing list of  urlLink 100 Spiritually Significant Films —an incomparable resource for anyone interested in exploring transcendent themes in the movies.   This is an interesting list of the top 100 most spiritually significant films, it's alphabetised, not ranked (which is a great idea) and includes small commentaries as to why they are each spiritually significant.  My example is  urlLink Dogma by Kevin Smith .  Just how close to the cliff's edge of apostacy does God permit a searcher to go? How far is too far for a church and the clergy to go in the quest to attract the hip, happenin' younger generation? How much dissonance, offense to propriety and scruples can you endure for His sake in the daily challenge of being an Ambassador for Him. These questions and more will occupy the viewer willing to brave non-stop profanity and vulgar images. Just because the story revolves around a world weary lapsed Catholic, does not mean that protestants and evangelicals will be immune from the implications of this story. A scene in which a bored, exiled archangel toys with the mind of a religious calls to mind the lapses this devout christian has suffered while letting spiritual dry patches get the best of him. This film has rewards a plenty for the brave.

      No doubt some of you know Lamb very well and some have never heard of them. Well I've heard of them for a while and just got their "Best of" album - "Best Kept Secrets".  I know nothing about the duo except that people keep mentioning them... Much of the album is stunning and makes me want to check out the rest of their stuff.  Andy Barlow does the instrumentation - an astonishing mix of lush, fat, backward, odd-tempo and weird beats and sweeps. From sublime to strange, from chill to choke, from dream to dance, from sigh to spew (yeah, some it doesn’t work for me).  Lou Rhodes does the vocals. On many tracks she has gorgeous phrasing but you feel you want her to come back and sing it in 10 years time, just because her tone is still getting there. But that is to understate her ability and interpretation. On many of the tracks she is fabulous. I don't know who writes the lyrics but the overall interpretation is moving. Here is the sense of a band pushing towards something, and in doing so they stretch us towards something as well.  One of Lamb's gifts is that they keep surprising you in every song. The beats and sounds change, the songs have several 'movements'. The mood goes places that songs rarely go. Not up or down but other places.  The lyrics of the songs that hit me are a mix of spiritual and sensual. "God Bless", "Gorecki", "Heaven", "Gabriel", "Wonder" and "Stronger".  Love songs? Questions? Dreams? Yes.  I hope some others might tell more of their music and background.  Here's the official website   urlLink http://www.lambstar.net/   Some live video stuff there too   "God Bless" - Lamb    You're gonna feel the wind at your heels you know You're gonna feel a sparkle in your step Everything will touch you in a different way Let it come, soon come, let it come 'Cause I'm gonna make you feel lighter than the air above Let me breath it into you Let me breath it into you Let me breath it into you   Here's to happiness God bless the day That made my feel this way   An angel's smiling on everything we do Let them try to stop this good thing growing 'Cause there's no dark cloud Gonna leave a shadow on there Gotta keep it strong Keep it true Keep it strong I'm gonna build you up And build you up Keep this natural thing Keep this precious thing Gotta keep it going on and growing strong   Here's to happiness God bless the day that made me feel this way Here's to happiness God bless the day that made me feel this way, feel this way Here's to happiness God bless the day That made me feel this way Feel this way Here's to happiness God bless the day that made me Feel this way Feel this way Gotta keep this naturel thing Gotta keep this precious thing Gotta keep this naturel thing Gotta keep this precious thing And I'm gonna keep it going on And growing strong Here's to happiness God bless the day that made me feel this way, feel this way   Here's to happiness God bless the day that made me feel this way Feel this way Feel..this..way Here here here heres to happiness Here here heres to happiness Here here here here to happiness To happiness To happiness

These photographs were taken to record these artworks for the future, and to give a wider audience some idea of what is going on.

      So Madonna is changing her name to Esther...  I wonder what she particularly likes about the story... or what it is about Esther that she identifies with...   Coincidentally, I've been thinking about Esther over the last few days (I'm about to do some writing on the story). I love the book (and how it doesn't mention God at all! - don't read too much into that), and have always thought of the story as a kind of anti-fairytale.  It's the kind of "marry the prince" story that you would want your daughter to hear...  strangely, though, I don't ever remember hearing it in church (gosh, there's a surprise)...  How nice that Madonna's got the story out there again...

      good news from the bbc which has  urlLink plans to make archive footage available  for use from the autumn...   "The Creative Archive is fuel for the creative nation," said Paula Le Dieu, co-director of the initiative. "It allows people to download these excerpts and be able to edit them and incorporate them into their own creative works."   it will start off with thousands of three minute clips of nature footage. great news for VJs, altworship etc etc and it will be  available for non commercial use

        This post taken  almost  straight from the  urlLink Cafechurch website :   urlLink Cafechurch Glebe  is meshing art with technology as a way of enriching their gatherings for worship.  From 2001 - 2003,  urlLink Cafechurch  employed a digital artist,  urlLink Rick Bull , who produced animations - prayers, scripture passages, visualised themes. They have been using these as a regular part of their worship. Think of them as contemporary stained glass windows in motion.  This program has now expanded - in 2004,  urlLink Cafechurch  secured the services of Rob Thwaites (theatrical practitioner, digital artist) as Arts Facilitator, and Cameron Semmens (performance poet and wordsmith) and Pete Harding (musician and digital artist) as Artists in Residence.  Download their free samples  urlLink from here . You will need Flash Player to view them. If you do not have it, download the plug-in from  urlLink Macromedia .

      Some time ago, FractalDesign (who created "Painter" - at least i think it was them - now owned by Corel) put out a wonderful program called Painter - a 'natural media' painting program. Then FractalDesign became MetaCreations...  They also put out "Expression" which was a vector painting program. Imagine being able to paint a brush stroke on computer and have the stroke as vector art rather than bitmap art. Anyway MetaCreations folded (mmm... maybe it wasn't them) and "Expression" was taken over by "Creature Expression", whoever they are.   THEN  Microsoft bought "Expression"....  (Get to the point - this is getting more complicated than J-Lo's love life) Well Microsoft aren't sure what they're doing with the thing, so in the meantime you can download it FREE - for Mac OS 9 and X and Windows. Definitely worth a look.  Click  urlLink here  to download it.  You can get additional free brushes for it  urlLink here . And who said Bill wasn't a good guy?   And for Mac people....   If you're interested in more brushes for Expression or addons for a wide variety of creative applications (Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, Synthetik Studio Artist, CinePaint, Macromedia Freehand MX and other applications). Dozens of free collections available. To find older collections, go to the search page  urlLink here , and perform a search for the word "download." (some of these would work on Windows versions as well)

        urlLink     Martyn Bennett  "Bothy Culture"   A couple of years ago, Martyn Bennett released a rather indescribable album called "Bothy Culture" - a collection of folk music blended with all kinds of stuff - beats, spoken voice and goodness knows what else. Great and challenging to listen to. And it was recorded at "Mouth Music Chip Shop" - what a great name.  A bit like the Afro Celts but much more individual and experimental.  He has liner notes like... "This tune has only four notes, but I haven't worked out what they are." and...  "There are lots of Punjabi folks songs about Kali that have loads of sex and sweary words, but this isn't one of them. This is a party tune with a pile of twaddle over the top."  The good news is that his website has some free downloads. Click  urlLink here .  (and I thought before today that he was a bloody Irishman! He's a Scot!)

      I thought I'd post some previous posts and pages from http://www.missionresourcing.net.au while we get up and running!  The Internet has quite a number of sites where you can download royalty-free images for personal and/or non-commercial use. Here are some of them. Please note that the photo quality varies. You need to check the usage conditions for each site.   Go to the  urlLink Mission Resourcing Network  website for a list of sites.

      I'm not entirely sure what the purpose of this blog is for, but since Craig invited me, it can't simply be to share expertise... I feel a bit of an intruder on the multimedia stage (I joined the youth multimedia egroup mostly for the recipes). I don't know how to do much, and I have hardly any equipment, but I love the idea of it, and I love playing, and I'm so inspired by what others do, and I'm learning to do more (am about to make my first foray into animations)... I have no equipment - well, apart from an iBook at home and a clunky pc at work. We do have  wireless broadband at home, but I was talked into that not because it would give me faster downloads and more opportunity to do multimedia-type things, but because my "IT advisor" said it would mean we could search the internet while drinking gin and tonic in the backyard on a sunny day... (We've got the gin and tonic ready, waiting for that elusive sunny day in Melbourne...). I'm trying not to feel like a complete idiot in every conversation I have about multimedia and technology... or at least, not to let feeling like a complete idiot stop me from being part of the conversation.    I'm currently working in a resourcing role across Victoria and Tasmania with the Uniting Church in Australia. My major focus at the moment is children and families, but my position is evolving, as we speak, into working with people and groups who want to explore alternative worship. I'm not quite sure what it means to work on alternative worship from within the centre of the institutional church, even whether it's possible to do that, but we're going to give it a try. It's a very new area for us to be working in, and I'm a tad excited that I get to do it...    Apart from all that... I write... Christian Education resources, poetry, worship stuff... and my perfect job would connect all of them... I also buy a lot of cd's, go to art galleries, read a lot of books, watch crap tv, and visit scotland as often as I can...

      well, i have plans for something more permanent, so here's a temporary home for some stuff related to the "youthmultimedia" egroup - which is not just about "youth". What is "youthmultimedia"? It's an egroup I started 3 1/2 years ago. The "official" description is this...  "Use of Multimedia with Young People in Christian Education, Worship and Mission. Members include ove 100 pastors, youth workers, high school and tertiary chaplains, youth leaders and others, primarily from Australia, New Zealand, UK, USA and Canada. Members come from a range of Christian churches. The group shares technical information, info about new music and movies, ideas for use of multimedia, and occasional discussion of a more theological nature!"  What does that mean? Well, we talk about... new music and movies tech stuff issues about using stuff in churches country music (sometimes!) six degrees of separation WWW resources for multimedia cooking (very sometimes) free multimedia resources data projectors what 'online' community might be about darren's exploits in canberra alternative worship where to see the spirit in media Apple Macs (and those other computers from the dark side) expressing the gospel through contemporary culture computer music obscure musical history what young people are doing, wathcing ans listening to use of multimedia in worship settings of all kinds how to get started in a multimedia what makes a good website  and a whole lot more!  I'm your host, Craig. I'm surrounded by a couple of Apple Macs, a scanner, USB audio/MIDI thingy, a borrowed Ensoniq keyboard, a Fender Telecaster and amp, a couple of video cameras (one mine, one borrowed), the digital camera from work, several bookshelves of multimedia resources, many hundreds of CDs, many more books on theology, Christian education, potery, sociology, a bunch of DVDs - and there's a family out there somewhere too!  I hail from Adelaide, Australia where I work in mission resourcing with the Uniting Church in Australia at a state level.   I'm planning a 'real' website for the list but this will do while I get organised.  If you want to see the real list archives, go to www.yahoogroups.com and search for "youthmultimedia" and join up.  see you in cyberspace.  craig

       urlLink     Faithless  Mass Destruction EP    Well today I bought the "Mass Destruction" EP and album "No Roots" by Faithless. The EP has the video clip for "Mass Destruction". P>The clip is a provocative statement about the evils of war, racism, misinformation and fear as weapons of 'mass destruction", and features chilling black and white footage of British school children acting out 'prisoner of war' scenes. These scenes produced the desired shock reaction, particularly as the children act the parts of both captors and captives, aggressors and victims. One is prompted to ask what kind of world our kids are growing up in, or more pointedly, what is our society training them to become?    As he did with "We Come 1" from the "Outrospective" album, Maxi Jazz puts global violence in our faces to bring a message of peace. Although Jazz's particular religious beliefs show through more clearly than at some times ("An you aint goin to nirvana or far-vana, you comin' right back here to live out your karma") this is not a distraction from the thrust of the song as a whole - if anything it is a reinforcement that we reap what we sow.  For those who don't know  Faithless , they are the masterminds behind "God is a DJ". a former band member, Jamie Catto, was one of the duo who put together the extraordinary  urlLink 1 Giant Leap  CD and DVD. And band member Rollo's sister is  urlLink Dido  who has also been part of the band on more than one occasion. Did o provides some vocals on this album.  Have a listen here:  urlLink  Faithless Website    A great website too!  Lyrics to Mass Destruction: (Chorus) With a long range weapon or suicide bomber Wicked mind is a weapon of mass destruction Whether you're stowaway's son or BBC 1 Dis-information is a weapon of mass destruction You could a caucasian or a poor asian Racism is a weapon of mass destruction Whether inflation or globalisation Fear is a weapon of mass destruction  My dad came into my room, holdin his hat I knew he was leavin', he sat on my bed, told me some facts, son  I have a duty, callin on me You and your sister be brave my little soldier, and don't forget all i told ya Your the mister of the house now remember this And when you wake up in the morning give ya momma a kiss, then I had to say goodbye  In the morning i woke momma with a kiss on each eyelid, Even though im only a kid, certain things can't be hid Momma grabbed me, held me like i was made of gold, but left her in the story untold I said, momma it will be allright, when daddy comes home, tonight  (Repeat Chorus)  Whether Haliburton, Enron or anyone Greed is a weapon of mass destruction We need to find courage, overcome Inaction is a weapon of mass destruction Inaction is a weapon of mass destruction Inaction is a weapon of mass destruction  My story stops here, lets be clear this scenario is happenin everywhere and you ain't goin to nirvana or favana You comin right back here to live out your karma with even more drama than previously, seriously Just how many centuries have we been waiting for someone else to make us free And we refuse to see, The people overseas are just like we Bad leadership, amigos, unfettered and free They feed on the people they're supposed to lead, I dont need it We need to pray away, for the lord to make it all straight Its only now we do it right, cos I don't want my daddy, leavin home tonight

      Well, this is my first post to this meta-blog, thankyou to Craig for Inviting me to join.  The first post I'll put to this link is something that Craig actually put together a while ago that I think should be on this blog.  Lets call it "YouthandMultimedia Tip 1.0"  "Digital video is a major issue to understand and use. I've been trying for about 7 years now and I still get stuck. Usually people find they want to play back a movie on their computer and can't get it to work, or they want to put a movie into Powerpoint, or they've just bought a digital video camera and want to enter the secret world of video editing. There is a lot to learn but if you're patient you can get there! So here are some starting tips.  a) If you want to know about movies in Powerpoint, go check out the  urlLink Indezine  website. b) If you want to know about software and hardware for working with digital video formats, go to the  urlLink DVDRHELP  website.  c) If you want the excellent Quicktime Pro movie player and converter for windows or Mac, go to the  urlLink Quicktime  Website."

       urlLink the art of speed  is a project commissioned by nike with 15 talented young filmmakers interpreting the idea of speed. all 15 films are on the latest dvd that came with creative review magazine (you have to subscribe to get the dvd which comes out twice a year). but all 15 films are available to download from the web site. the large size ones are pretty big so you'll need broadband connection. my favourite is the associates in science one which has the most useable sequences for worship.  urlLink grace  are doing a service at  urlLink greenbelt  called 'slow' looking at speed and slow - handy eh?!...  the web site also contains links to several other interesting things. i particularly like this  urlLink hand clock

         Like many of us I gather pictures of Jesus from various places and  use them in various ways, often rather neglectful of the copyright  issues involved.  So I've been ecstatic to come across an excellent resource called "The  Christ We Share" which has given me a legal way to do this.  Produced by the  urlLink Church Missionary Society  in the UK, it contains 35  full colour images of Christ from various cultures around the world.  The images come as A5 mini posters, AND on CDROM as high and low  resolution images and two Powerpoint presentations - one with music by  urlLink Proost .  But wait there's more... The pack also contains an excellent range of  activity sheets and worship ideas enabling people to explore how and  why various people and cultures see Christ through different eyes.  some of the images you will have seen before, particularly in WCC  publications - some will no doubt shock and disturb some.  It costs only 15 pounds sterling (where is that pound symbol when you  need it...!) and for me an extra 6 pounds for air freight to Oz.  Highly recommended - its stunning.  They don't have online ordering so you have to fax the details.

       urlLink    2004 Festival Theme: Grace  Are you into film? Rate yourself as a producer or director? Or just want to have fun with your friends? Then Godspeak Film Festival is for you.  Create a short film based around the biblical theme of “grace”. What is this thing called grace? What does it look like? This is your chance to explore, ponder, provoke, enlighten, get creative and have fun!  Scripture when used in your film must be accurately depicted or quoted. This may be achieved by retelling a biblical account or by portraying a biblical account in a contemporary context. Films may be drama, sitcom, documentary or animation.

        urlLink Im Motion  is a new DVD produced by OSBD for  urlLink RUN (reaching the unchurched network) . it has clearly been a huge project in the making with 4 sections -   5 stories of faith (it was surprise and fun to see barry taylor on there!) 3 dramas 5 excerpts from 'the street bible' performed by rob lacey on location (street bible is being published in the USA as 'the word on the street' i think) 4 reflective visual pieces designed for meditation or worship  it's all new material - over 80 minutes worth, useable in lots of contexts. i think it is well suited to churches looking for creative material or small groups wanting a discussion starter. i can imagine the street bible being played for the bible reading in a service - would be great...  the most useable bits for alt worship are the reflective visual pieces. my favourite is one that has shots of eyes overlaying each other with things going on in the reflection of the pupil of the eye - very nicely done! it actually reminds me of  urlLink  an eye we filmed close up as part of grace ten . our concept there was that grace comes to us through sight if we have eyes to see.... the loop on the dvd is rather more sophisticated...  there are some samples of the video on the osbd page......

       Just thought I'd let you all know that I have written a 1st edition Discussion helper on Spiderman 2 and put it up onto the  urlLink Youth and Multimedia website  (sorry, only members of that list can access to that).  For those of you not on the list I have also placed a copy  urlLink here .  It's a 7 page, 330kb pdf file, sorry but Open Office seems to make bloated pdf's.  I might actually have to find another way to create pdf's :)  Usual warnings about the paper containing spoilers and story line to those of you who didnt catch it on the first couple of days of screening.  I hope to get back to it later and smooth it out with some specific bible readings and other suggestions, if anyone has some suggestions please  urlLink let me know .  Remember, to join the list all you need to do is  urlLink click here ...  Also on the  urlLink Youth and Multimedia website  is a Big Fish discussion paper and many other cool resources...

       urlLink Aftershocks  in an online display of art and memoirs by young people growing up with war and terrorism. (don't call it 'terror'. Grrr)  The artwork and journals in this online exhibit were created by teenagers who lived through the war in Bosnia and children in New York City who witnessed the destruction of the World Trade Center.   As well as art and journals, the site contains a video documentary of some of the artists.  Well worth a visit.
