						   Restore our history, culture, language, and borders. These are the four pillars of our nation, and if any are allowed to fall then the rest are all at risk.

						   This is VERY rough outline of action to restore and maintain the quality of our union. Some material has been covered elsewhere.   If the United States is to survive as a dominant world superpower, drastic steps must be taken. Available natural resources must be tapped and secured as well as alternative forms of energy explored vigorously. A new emphasis must be placed on morals, family, community, and procreation actively encouraged in order to keep the population young and able bodied.   A return to our agricultural and industrial roots must also be encouraged in order to keep us as productive and self sufficient as possible. It would be wise to covert our jails and prisons into work camps in order to take advantage of the low cost labor those prisoners of the state would provide. This would help to circumvent the loss of jobs overseas for lower wages, and while not securing jobs for the population at large would work to our advantage in denying such employment to the people and thereby, the economies of other nations. Penalties could and should also be put in place for the shipping of jobs overseas be American companies.   Voter and candidate reform would also do much to improve the overall quality of leadership in the union. It would be recommended to raise the voting age for all those not serving in the military or government positions as well as requiring high school diplomas, up to date income tax filing status and clean criminal records. This would prevent voting by the young who lack judgment, the unlearned who lack knowledge, the unemployed who by choice or circumstance are not contributing to society, and those of poor character. Likewise, candidates should be required to have a college degree, clean criminal record, and varying years of public service dependent upon what office they seek.   Social programs should be privatized as much as is possible to relieve their financial burden from the state. Any programs retained should be given conditions such as work for welfare or public service. Educational programs retained should hold higher standards than current and its varying curriculum redesigned in order to match the aptitudes of student with the needs of the state. Basic education should be provided for k through 8th grade at which time intermediate specialization would be determined. Specialization would be broken down into Production/service, military, and government. At this phase students would be introduced to each of the three branches and given entry-level instruction in each. From this point, further public instruction would become optional and fees imposed for those continuing on. Scholarships could be awarded to those with the ability but not the funds to continue on. At the advanced level students would either choose or be assigned a specialization based on their aptitude and continue on from the ages of 18 to 21 after which they would move into a starting position in their field based upon need. Higher functioning students should be steered toward business, government, and leadership positions in emergency services and military while less apt student should be encouraged to skilled labor, industry, agriculture, emergency workers, and enlisted military. As the nation is as a body, and a body has many parts and functions, so to does its population. Private education would work much the same way but likely with more freedoms and a wider array of choices.   A final consideration should be given to defense. New avenues of intelligence and monitoring should be explored, as well as the newest weapons technologies applied. The military should be remodeled in such a way as to provide the most efficient and effective means of defense, regardless of international considerations. Alliances, while valuable should never be placed above the well being of the state and its people. Sheer numbers of troops should always be maintained in case the need arises but an emphasis on advanced technologies must be made in order to stay ahead of international pace. The same applies the patrolling and security of our borders, which through more stringent immigration policy and intensive border patrols would do much to deter terrorism by hostile foreign elements. Through these operations we can hope to maintain and improve the state of our union through the 21st century.

						   Unfortunately nuclear arms have changed the name of the game forever. Where do we begin our reform? It is almost a given that another great war would need to come before any fundamental change could take place, and in the nuclear age, what would be left. A world war today would certainly see the use of nuclear arms and consequently massive loss of population, resources, and workable infrastructure. I say that a great war would result as part of our reform would entail our gaining energy independence from the middle east, rebuilding our agricultural and industrial centers, changing our imort/export practices to better benefit americans, obtaining as much precious metals (platinum, gold, silver) as possible, and redesigning our military to work for us rather than the world at large. Combine this with freeing ourselves from as many "entangling alliances" as possible (i.e. the U.N.) and you have a stage set for international outrage and alarm at our self interest and forward thinking that we would be seen as an immediate threat that needed to be dealt with. The moment you place the needs of our nation above the needs of the world at large, a response is sure to follow. If only we had the leadership...

						   This was on another forum. Credit to wadi66 of PoliTalks.com Forum    It was originally about democrats but I think it fits the blanket term liberals better.  1. You have to believe that the AIDS virus is spread by a lack of federal funding.   2. You have to believe that the same teacher who can't teach 4th-graders how to read is somehow qualified to teach those same kids about sex.   3. You have to believe that guns in the hands of law-abiding Americans are more of a threat than U.S. nuclear weapons technology in the hands of Chinese and North Korean communists.   4. You have to believe that there was no art before Federal funding.   5. You have to believe that global temperatures are less affected by cyclical documented changes in the earth's climate than by soccer moms driving SUVs.   6.

You have to believe that Margaret Sanger and Gloria Steinem are more important to American history than Thomas Jefferson, Gen. Robert E Lee, and Thomas Edison.   15. You have to believe that standardized tests are racist, but racial quotas and set -asides are not.   16. You have to believe that Hillary Clinton is normal and is a very nice person.   17. You have to believe that the only reason socialism hasn't worked anywhere it's been tried is because the right people haven't been in charge.   18. You have to believe conservatives telling the truth belong in jail, but a liar and a sex offender belonged in the White House.   19. You have to believe that homosexual parades displaying drag queens, transvestites, and bestiality should be constitutionally protected, and manger scenes at Christmas should be illegal   20. You have to believe that illegal Democratic Party funding by the Chinese government is somehow in the best interest to the United States.   21.

						   Is anybody out there? I don't knowing if there is anyone reading this blog, but I suppose that isn't the point, at least not right now.  I am so sick to death of the bickering, the dirty dealing, and the nonsense that is going on around me right now. Our country is in a state of distress. While heat is expected in a time of war, especially when combined with being an election year, it is still too much. It seems more and more that people are looking out for their own interests and looking for new and more creative ways to stick it to the other guy. This stupid iraqi occupation has me going nuts. Listen, I thought this conflict was a bad idea from the word go, but we are there now and we cannot leave until the job is done.   Instead of standing in a circle and shooting at each other, maybe we should realize that despite our differences, we have a common enemy that we should be directing our hostility against. As a matter of fact, we have a number of common enemies that we should be concentrating on way before we sink back into the mud of partisan politics. At the rate we are going now, fighting amongst ourselves, we aren't going to have the energy to defend ourselves when a real threat comes along. A house divided cannot stand, and we are nearly as divided as we can get.  Its going to take something drastic happening in this country before people realize just what we have and what it takes to keep it, I just hope that we dont realize it too late.

						   Re: Laying to rest the idea of a pre-trib "rapture" [Uriah]  Posted: Dec 4, 2003, 5:13 PM     The Episcopal Church has been declared by certain portions of the Anglican communion to be in apostacy.

						   Laying to rest the idea of a pre-trib "rapture"  Posted: Dec 1, 2003, 2:56 PM        There are some matters of great import that need to be clearly explained. Read, test, and pray for understanding... Matthew 24:29 Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: 24:30 And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. 24:31 And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other .   This is "The Day of the Lord"...after the tribulation.   The Antichrist and all the military of the world will be gathered at Armageddon (see Isa 2:12, 13:6, 13:9, 34:8, Joel 1:15, 2:1, 3:14, Zeph 1:7, Zech 14:1, Jer 46:10, Ezek 13:5, 30:3, Ob 15, Mal 4:5, 1 cor 5:5, 2 cor 1:14, 1 thess 5:2, 2 pet 3:10)   Compare these with: Matt 24:29-31, Mark 13:24-27, Luke 21:25-28, Acts 2:19-21, 1 Thess 5:1-9, 2 peter 3:10-13, Rev 6:12, 8:12, 9:1-3, 11:15-19, 16:8-10, 16:17-21. 19:11-21   We are currently still in the "beginning of sorrows" described in Matthew 24:3-8   These sorrows may or may not (I believe it is likely with all things considered) coincide with the first 5 seals of revelation. I am also of the opinion that the trumpets and bowls run at the same time as they are nearly identical. The 6th of each describe the euphrates and the army that crosses it. Cross reference this with the above "Day of the lord" references and with Ezek 38 and 39:1-16 as well as Dan 11:33-45 and Dan 12.  Remember Ecclesiastes 1:9-11 “That which has been is what will be…” The 6th trumpet and bowl describe the army from the east coming to Armaggedon JUST PRIOR to “The Day of the Lord” or The 2nd coming.  As for the sealed 144,000 of Revelation 7:1-8, these are Jews who become Christians during the tribulation, possibly because of the two witnesses. The “Church” as in the body of Christ is still on Earth (read Rev 7:9-17, 12:16). Read the references to being “sealed” or having the “seal” in: Romans 4:11, 15:27,28, 1 Cor 9:2, 2 Cor 1:20-22, Eph 1:13, 4:30, 2 Tim 2:19, Rev 7:3, 9:4. The seal is of our salvation through coming to Christ.  I have been studying all these matters very diligently and hope that its seed bears some fruit with you. God Bless you all.   http://jeremiah175.blogspot.com/

And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast which was full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. 4 The woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the filthiness of her fornication. F91 5 And on her forehead a name was written: MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. 6 I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I marveled with great amazement.   ...18 And the woman whom you saw is that great city which reigns over the kings of the earth."     Micah 1   5 All this is for the transgression of Jacob And for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? And what are the high places of Judah? Are they not Jerusalem? 6 "Therefore I will make Samaria a heap of ruins in the field, Places for planting a vineyard; I will pour down her stones into the valley, And I will uncover her foundations. 7 All her carved images shall be beaten to pieces, And all her pay as a harlot shall be burned with the fire; All her idols I will lay desolate, For she gathered it from the pay of a harlot, And they shall return to the pay of a harlot."   8 Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked; I will make a wailing like the jackals And a mourning like the ostriches, 9 For her wounds are incurable.

Peter was referring to Jerusalem as Babylon in  1 Peter 5:13  by Greg Kiser    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  1 Peter 5:13  The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you;  and so doth Marcus my son.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   1 - In the days of the apostle Peter, according to Pliny and Josephus, the CITY of Babylon was a wilderness.  2 - According to Josephus, all Jews had been expelled from the COUNTRY of Babylonia in Peter's day.   3 - Peter's residence can not be established in a literal Babylon, nor can it be established in Rome (which some commentaries say is the meaning of "Babylon" in this passage.) But in my studies of Peter's residence I can firmly establish him living in Jerusalem:   3a - After the great persecution the church was scattered, but the apostles (i.e. Peter) stayed in Jerusalem (Acts 8:1).   3b - When Philip preached in Samaria, the apostles at Jerusalem sent Peter and John to them. Thus Peter must have been living there (Acts 8:14).   3c - When Herod Agrippa imprisoned Peter, he was in Jerusalem (Acts 12:1-4).   3d - Three years after his conversion, Paul goes to Jerusalem to see Peter and even abides with him there. Therefore, Peter must have lived there (Galatians 1:18).   3e - Fourteen years after his conversion, Paul again returns to Jerusalem with Barnabas and Titus. Peter is there again and even named as a "pillar" in the church at Jerusalem (Galatians 2:1, 9).   3f - Paul tells us that Peter was intimidated by "Jews from James (i.e. Jerusalem)". Surely this would be because Peter's residence was there and he had to live with these people (Galatians 2:11,12).   3g - In the scripture in question (1 Peter 5:13), who is Marcus? If it is a reference to John Mark then we presumably know that his original residence was in Jerusalem in the house of his mother. So if Marcus is John Mark, then the "church" would also be at Jerusalem (Acts  12:12).   I do know, however, that Peter did some evangelical traveling with his wife as is stated by Paul in 1 Corinthians 9:5 and therefore could have visited Babylon, although I don't know why. Continuing . . .   4 - Peter was the "apostle to the circumcision" (Galatians 2:7-9), and if there were no Jews in Babylon, why would he take up residence  there?   5 - The most prominent population of Jews in Peter's day was at Jerusalem, so this is the most logical place for the "apostle to the circumcision" to reside.   6 - If 1 Peter 5:13 references John Mark, then his residence is also established at Jerusalem.

Although referred to in all four gospel books, there remains controversy in our time as to where exactly the Crucifixion took place. What is known for certain is that the site was:  • Outside the existing Jerusalem walls of that time.  • Close to an existing walking path or road.  • Near the sepulcher where Jesus' body was placed.  • Near where His subsequent resurrection took place.  Scholars have settled upon two likely sites:  1. A hill located just north of the Damascus Gate (see Jerusalem Gates) of the Old City. Its craggy rock side appears very much like an eerie skull face (in photo), especially when the sun's shadows cross it at particular times of the day. It is known as Gordon's Calvary from Charles Gordon who wrote of it in 1885. Earlier, in 1881, an empty burial chamber was discovered near this site and it too has become famous as The Garden Tomb.  2. The location over which the Church of The Holy Sepulcher has been built. This is the older, traditional choice among scholars.  http://jeremiah175.blogspot.com/   Re: Jerusalem is Mystery Babylon [RedseaI]  Posted: May 30, 2004, 1:21 PM   REVELATION 8   1 And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.   2 And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets.   3 And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer [it] with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.   4 And the smoke of the incense, [which came] with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.   5 And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast [it] into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.     REVELATION 11   15 And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become [the kingdoms] of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.   16 And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,   17 Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned.   18 And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.   19 And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.       REVELATION 16     17 And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.   18 And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, [and] so great.   19 And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.   20 And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.   21 And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, [every stone] about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.       ISAIAH 2     19 And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.   *see also Rev 6:12-17     20 In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made [each one] for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats;   21 To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.   * see also Rev 6:12-17   22 Cease ye from man, whose breath [is] in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of?       ISAIAH 24   18 And it shall come to pass, [that] he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake.   19 The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.   20 The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.   21 And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones [that are] on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth.   22 And they shall be gathered together, [as] prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited.   23 Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously.       EZEKIEL 38   18 And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, [that] my fury shall come up in my face.   19 For in my jealousy [and] in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel;   20 So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that [are] upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.   * see also Rev 6:12-17     21 And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, saith the Lord GOD: every man's sword shall be against his brother.   22 And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that [are] with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.   23 Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.      http://jeremiah175.blogspot.com/  reference  Re: Jerusalem is Mystery Babylon  Posted: May 30, 2004, 1:41 PM   Compare Rev 17 w/ Micah 1, Dan 7:7-25, and Rev 13:1-10.   Jerusalem (the daughter of Zion) was once "a faithful city that has become a harlot" (Isa 1:21)   Look at Isaiah 1-3. They discuss the moral collapse of Jerusalem followed by judgement and 'The Day of The Lord'...there is only one day of the Lord.   Isaiah 5:26-30 discusses the nations "roaring over" Jerusalem so that "if one looks at the land, he will see darkness and distress" (5:30)   Compare this with Ezekiel 38:16   Furthermore compare Ezekiel 39:4 with Eze 39:17-20 and Rev 19:17-19   The world will come against Jerusalem (the harlot who rides the beast who hates her as the horns hate her) under a false peace that will be betrayed. After the nations lay waste to her and "burn her", Christ will return to execute judgement upon the world.   Hence, the famous "Gog/Magog" war that many have been taught will usher in the tribulation will in fact be the battle at its end.   So many people are laden doen with modern evangelical dogma that the can't/don't/ or won't see what God has put in plain view scripture for us. "Study to show thyself approved"!  Don't rely on someone else because they stand behind a pulpit, give a seminar, make a tape, or wrote a book!   Don't believe me either! Get a KJ or NKJ bible and a good concordance, plus plenty of ink and paper. Compare scripture...take notes, make notations. Scripture states that what has been will be again. The world has been judged before and will again, Jerusalem has been judged before and will again, just as Christ has come, and will again.  http://jeremiah175.blogspot.com/  Re: Jerusalem is Mystery Babylon [Jeremiah175]  Posted: Jun 1, 2004, 6:03 AM   Ezekiel 16: 1 - 63 - Study This Chapter    1 Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 2 "Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations, 3 and say, 'Thus says the Lord God to Jerusalem: "Your birth and your nativity are from the land of Canaan; your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite. 4 As for your nativity, on the day you were born your navel cord was not cut, nor were you washed in water to cleanse you; you were not rubbed with salt nor wrapped in swaddling cloths. 5 No eye pitied you, to do any of these things for you, to have compassion on you; but you were thrown out into the open field, when you yourself were loathed on the day you were born.   6 "And when I passed by you and saw you struggling in your own blood, I said to you in your blood, 'Live!' Yes, I said to you in your blood, 'Live!' 7 I made you thrive like a plant in the field; and you grew, matured, and became very beautiful. Your breasts were formed, your hair grew, but you were naked and bare. 8 When I passed by you again and looked upon you, indeed your time was the time of love; so I spread My wing over you and covered your nakedness. Yes, I swore an oath to you and entered into a covenant with you, and you became Mine," says the Lord God. 9 Then I washed you in water; yes, I thoroughly washed off your blood, and I anointed you with oil. 10 I clothed you in embroidered cloth and gave you sandals of badger skin; I clothed you with fine linen and covered you with silk. 11 I adorned you with ornaments, put bracelets on your wrists, and a chain on your neck. 12 And I put a jewel in your nose, earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head. 13 Thus you were adorned with gold and silver, and your clothing was of fine linen, silk, and embroidered cloth. You ate pastry of fine flour, honey, and oil. You were exceedingly beautiful, and succeeded to royalty. 14 Your fame went out among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect through My splendor which I had bestowed on you," says the Lord God.   15 "But you trusted in your own beauty, played the harlot because of your fame, and poured out your harlotry on everyone passing by who would have it. 16 You took some of your garments and adorned multicolored high places for yourself, and played the harlot on them. Such things should not happen, nor be. 17 You have also taken your beautiful jewelry from My gold and My silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself male images and played the harlot with them. 18 You took your embroidered garments and covered them, and you set My oil and My incense before them. 19 Also My food which I gave you--the pastry of fine flour, oil, and honey which I fed you--you set it before them as sweet incense; and so it was," says the Lord God. 20 Moreover you took your sons and your daughters, whom you bore to Me, and these you sacrificed to them to be devoured. Were your acts of harlotry a small matter, 21 that you have slain My children and offered them up to them by causing them to pass through the fire? 22 And in all your abominations and acts of harlotry you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, struggling in your blood. 23 "Then it was so, after all your wickedness--'Woe, woe to you!' says the Lord God-- 24 that you also built for yourself a shrine, and made a high place for yourself in every street. 25 You built your high places at the head of every road, and made your beauty to be abhorred. You offered yourself to everyone who passed by, and multiplied your acts of harlotry. 26 You also committed harlotry with the Egyptians, your very fleshly neighbors, and increased your acts of harlotry to provoke Me to anger. 27 Behold, therefore, I stretched out My hand against you, diminished your allotment, and gave you up to the will of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your lewd behavior. 28 You also played the harlot with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable; indeed you played the harlot with them and still were not satisfied. 29 Moreover you multiplied your acts of harlotry as far as the land of the trader, Chaldea; and even then you were not satisfied. 30 How degenerate is your heart!" says the Lord God, "seeing you do all these things, the deeds of a brazen harlot. 31 "You erected your shrine at the head of every road, and built your high place in every street. Yet you were not like a harlot, because you scorned payment. 32 You are an adulterous wife, who takes strangers instead of her husband. 33 Men make payment to all harlots, but you made your payments to all your lovers, and hired them to come to you from all around for your harlotry. 34 You are the opposite of other women in your harlotry, because no one solicited you to be a harlot. In that you gave payment but no payment was given you, therefore you are the opposite."   35 'Now then, O harlot, hear the word of the Lord! 36 Thus says the Lord God: "Because your filthiness was poured out and your nakedness uncovered in your harlotry with your lovers, and with all your abominable idols, and because of the blood of your children which you gave to them, 37 surely, therefore, I will gather all your lovers with whom you took pleasure, all those you loved, and all those you hated; I will gather them from all around against you and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness. 38 And I will judge you as women who break wedlock or shed blood are judged; I will bring blood upon you in fury and jealousy. 39 I will also give you into their hand, and they shall throw down your shrines and break down your high places. They shall also strip you of your clothes, take your beautiful jewelry, and leave you naked and bare. 40 They shall also bring up an assembly against you, and they shall stone you with stones and thrust you through with their swords. 41 They shall burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women; and I will make you cease playing the harlot, and you shall no longer hire lovers.  http://jeremiah175.blogspot.com/   private reply   edit  quoted reply  reply    Jeremiah175  User    Post: 31 of 65  Views: 125    reference  Re: Jerusalem is Mystery Babylon  Posted: Jun 1, 2004, 6:10 AM   Jer 51:7 - Show Context  Babylon was a golden cup in the Lord's hand, That made all the earth drunk.

Of course they were still stuck in an economic monetary system.   In tribal communalism the strong took care of the weak. The duties of the Chiefs were to see the needs of all the tribe were met.   They acted as servants to the tribe. Jesus said to his disciples that he who would be Chief amongst them would be the servant of all.   This notion that their government shouldn't fund social programs for those who in need is just the gibberish of quacks.   The idea to shift these things to state, local, churches, private charities, and private individuals is completely flawed and ill thought out the way your society is structured.   If it ain't broke don't fix it.   The actual money spent by your form of government on social programs percentage wise to your national budget is paltry.  MY RESPONSE    The Apostles did not make up the state, they made up the people and consequently all charitable works they coordinated were done through the people and not the state. The Church (The Body of Christ) is not the state.  --------------------------------------   groundhogday  User   Re: The Role of the State  Posted: Jun 25, 2004, 3:10 PM   Yeah, they didn't make up the Roman State with it's Senate and mighty armies.   Israel was under King Herod at the time and whoever followed him. They were trying to live as Communalists under whatever State they were under.   If they were Roman Citizens they had all sorts of "Rights" under the State.   Had they been living in this land, though, at that time they could have lived as Communalists without money.   They were Jews and the Jews had been a tribal people. Jesus was born of the tribe of Judah. Hence his title Lion of Judah. A cat.   The people of this land didn't make up your State. Your State by and large is based upon the Roman government.   The disciples by and large made up their own government of communalists in Jesus under the governments they were under. Even so they were still under whatever governments ruled over them and lived within those economic systems of money.   Under your system of government the most people in need of help are most effienctly reached through governmental programs already in place to help them because that is how your system is already set up to help those in need.   The proposal you put forth isn't thought out well, wouldn't work, and would harm millions upon millions of people.   So why harm people who are already in need of help under some ill delusion what you proposed would actually work?   It's a shame millions and millions of people do not have health insurance. It's even a further shame that they are turned away from emergency rooms if they don't have insurance and are not treated.   Yours is a strange society to treat people in such a way, but within your society there are people like Lizahana who care about their fellow man.   She believes in helping people in the best manner possible because she is a kind hearted person.   Under your governmental state, I believe the words read We the People. In today's world I know it means We the Corporations or Oil companies as the case may be right now.   The Insurance Corporations don't want health care because they believe it cuts into their own personal money money money coffers of Mammon that lines their pockets.   They have the money to bribe politicians and they have the time and access to politicians at local, state, and federal levels.   The Corporations want to do away with whatever envirnomental laws they can do away with so that is what Lizahana is up against as far as the environment goes.   They have the money to bribe politicians, and the time and access to the politicians at all levels.   Corruption and Greed. Materialistic gluttony.   Myself, I am tribal communalist. I am simple earth dweller who believes living simply with the earth, and taking care of God's creation the earth.   I don't concern myself about the environment because this world is ruled over by the rich. For now.   Jesus said of his Kingdom that is coming that the wheat would be sown amongst the tares.   The prayer that Jesus taught his disciples says, Thy Kingdom Come.   But Jesus also laid out according to prophecy what was going to come upon the earth befor the Kingdom Comes in it's fulness.   But the native tribes of this land have prophecies, too.   The way you live upon the earth won't work out over a real long period of time because your destroying the earth and thus destroying yourselves. It's like living in a house and pouring gasoline upon the house, setting the house on fire, and still trying to live in the house.   Jesus uses a lot of symbols of both animals and nature in all his teachings. You don't think Jesus doesn't know nature including human nature?   Jesus never had to raise an army to overthrow the Roman conquerers of Israel. Jesus knew they would self-destruct.   Man by his own nature is destructive. Man by his own nature is a destroyer. Your society builds overtop of nature and you call it building but your actually destroying.   Thus, Lizahana, all sorts of species of animals and such become extinct. Almost as extinct as the buffalo.   Your type of living would lead to extinction but Jesus said if the Tribulation were not cut short then no flesh would be spared.   While this may seem a bit off subject it isn't. It has to do with what you call The State, and the human heart.   I am different from you because I am not a European Gentile and I don't think like European Gentiles think, and not that all European Gentiles think the same.   Many of my Brothers and Sister in Christ are of European Gentile origins and they would prefer to live as The People used to live.   Jesus said to build up your treasures Heaven. The Corporations want you to build them up upon the earth through the junk they sell and sell and sell.   The buyers and sellers of things in Revelation.   But that is what they want. A materialistic gluttoness world. Thus with their money they bribe the politicians and have the laws written to suit themselves.   Time is just a river that flows from beginning to end.  The generations come and the generations go.  Time is a river that continues to flow.   MY RESPONSE  >I am different from you because I am not a European Gentile and I don't think like European Gentiles think, and not that all European Gentiles think the same.   First of all sir you are a racist.   Second of all it is my feeling that we should take care of one another instead of passing the buck to the state. Call it the "I gave at the office" syndrome.   You have no idea who I am, or what I give and to assume that you know makes you look less than wise.   I live in a country where instead of people really helping each other, they help each other stay poor. Here when you grow old, you are shipped into a nursing home rather than moved in with your family to care for you. Do you think food stamps or welfare (especially as they are currently structured) help anyone improve their lives? Guess again because it only keeps them stuck in the psuedo-caste system they are in.   Corruption is a terrible problem here, which is why strict limits need to be placed on campaign finance and rules should be in place to insure we have intelligent voters voting for worthy candidates.   Guess you gets elected today? whomever offers the most attractive hand-out and the lowest taxes, and that is disgusting.   PEOPLE should care for PEOPLE...that is the point. If we really took care of one another there would be no need for ever expanding social programs. Instead people just point the finger. You say that politicians and corporations are corrupt and greedy? I say the people allow, even encourage, them to be that way because most of the people are corrupt and greedy, standing with their sweaty hands out and looking out for number one.   Lastly, in regards to you calling me a european gentile...this is true. I take it you then are a jew? If so consider that a good chunk of the U.S. economy is generated by jewish businessmen (do the research), and consider as well that Israel which is a state for and by Jews is essentially a little USA in terms of its political and business practices.   I am a husband and father. I rent, not own, my home. I am lower-middle class, living close to paycheck to paycheck. I give to charity, and not just on the holidays. Believe it or not, I have looked into the feasability of building up some form of christian commune...so people can live and take care of people. My point? Dont judge me...you have no idea who or what I am.

						   In response to being called an idiot for saying the masses are not qualified to lead:  So you are of the opinion that the everyman (the masses) are qualified to run the nation? Most are far too self interested to consider the well-being of the whole. This is reflected in our leadership who themselves are self serving and rather than lead, pander to the people and their special interests for votes. Real leaders do what is right and what is needed, not what is popular. Our current system needs reform as our leadership does what is popular (or at least promises to in order to get elected) even if it isnt right or needed. So many complain about how corrupt our politicians are, and yet our system is designed in such a way that anyone wishing to be elected must whore themselves to those who fund their campaigns and then again to those interests whose numbers will suffice to put them in office. Until we have reform, our decay from within will continue.

						   Plato argued against democracy. Democracy leads to “mob rule” with those in power pandering to “pleasure-seekers” whose principal goals are the satisfaction of their immediate desires. He said it was "a delightful form of government, anarchic and motley, assigning a kind of equality indiscriminately to equal and unequal alike!" He also so argued, quite accurately in my opinion that the excessive freedoms that democracies allow lead to anarchy. If all are equal and all views valid, how does one satisfactorily decide what the law should allow? Such discrepancies inevitably lead to conflicts, which divide, and thereby do harm to, the well being of the union. Also, as we have seen time and again, it is neither the most qualified nor the best-suited leader who takes public office, but they whose eloquence satisfies the itching ears of the masses. We are seeing this manifest in our nation today. The rule of law is flouted by those who disagree with it, politicians are carried into office on the promises of tax cuts and ever expanding social programs, aliens are given equal stance with citizens, and excellence is compromised for inclusiveness. Such conditions make the land ripe for implosion. When great men have been dethroned by the ignorant masses and law for lawlessness, only chaos not order, can follow. If we do not address these issues in a cold, calculating, and frank manner, we will not survive. We may continue on for a time, with the glories of a bygone era lighting our way, but when that fuel finishes burning we will find ourselves lost and long into the night.

						   In my estimation the state has taken on the role of caretaker to the people through its vast array of social programs, which has done much to deplete its treasury, and indeed put it in debt. I believe that the state should take care of the state (infrastructure, law, defense) and the people should take care of the people (social programs, education). As much as can be privatized should be privatized with the state acting as peoples advocate and overseer through departmental supervision/regulation to maintain safe and fair practices (i.e. standards of education, health standards for medical, safety standards for transportation, and protections against price gouging). I would completely eliminate all social programs funded by the state (social security, welfare, food stamps. public education) and leave it firmly in the hands of the populace and private organizations. Churches and charities funded by the people would take over public welfare programs and the sole role of the state would be to monitor such programs departmentally to ensure ethical and legal practices. In this way it would fall back to the population to care for itself and promote a greater sense of community responsibility while at the same time freeing the time and resources of the state for its duties.

						   While the title of this thread is a take off of a book written by Hans-Hermann Hoppe, his book is not the topic at hand.   As we continue down the muddy road of building a "Free and Democratic Iraq", a question comes to mind; just what are we building and why?  Can a successful democracy be attained by the liberating of a people and having it drawn up for them from the outside, or must it, as was the case with The United States, come from within? I ask these questions not to degrade what our leaders are trying to accomplish in Iraq, but only to spur deep thought and discussion as to what it would take to create a democratic Iraq, what it would mean, and indeed what democracy itself means.   The basic idea of democracy is that man is essentially good and that if free to pursue his own agenda he will gradually ascend to higher ideals and greater achievements, thereby creating a better world for all.   I hold that a democracy is only as good as the people it represents. The democracy of a motivated, generous, loving, moral people will reflect their way of life. The same holds true for the democracy of an unmotivated, greedy, unloving, or immoral people. A democracy is itself neither good nor bad, but neutral. In the same way the idea that a world filled with democracy ensures peace is naïve, as democracy operates on the wishes of the people. The cultural and ideological differences between peoples and nations will continue to create conflict, be it minor or major, even if democracy spreads to every corner of the globe. Do we of the western tradition, specifically The United States have a skewed view of democracy, its requirements, and its benefits?   As we take our first steps into the 21st century we must carefully measure our past assumptions against our present situation and future challenges in order to formulate a successful strategy for all that our ever-changing world may bring.

						   Re: Free will?  Posted: Jun 19, 2004, 11:00 PM   True Free will is an impossibility if you believe that God has a will and a plan. We know that He has both and that He admits to knowing the first day from the last and everything in between. Consequently there isnt even room for debate per se on the issue of free will as:   God has a will.   God has a plan.   God is all knowing. There is NOTHING He doesnt know.   God is all seeing and everywhere. There is NOTHING He doesnt see.   God is all powerful. There is NOTHING that he cannot do.   Putting this all together you see that since God has a will and plan, which by virtue of His knowledge and power cannot be thwarted, man is incapable of doing anything outside of his divine will. It isnt even a matter of Him letting things develop as they would, because He has a plan. If man were truely free willed then he (man) would be capable of meddling with His (God) plan(s) through his lack of cooperation. We are all insturments of His will, whether we are conscious of it or wish to be. We are living out the will and plan of God, and I find that glorious.   omnipotent  SYLLABICATION: om·nip·o·tent  PRONUNCIATION: AUDIO: m-np-tnt KEY  ADJECTIVE: Having unlimited or universal power, authority, or force; all-powerful.

						   Gay Marriage: Irrelevant Politics or Pertinent Topic?  Posted: Jun 20, 2004, 6:07 AM     Depending upon ones view of what America was, is, and should be, the issue of gay marriage may be of great importance. I am a Christian man who is married and raising three children in this nation. It seems clear to me, despite what revisionist historians would have us believe, that The United States was founded upon largely Christian ideals.  Over the past 40 years those ideals have come under a tireless attack, and our nations moral belt has been loosened to the point that we are now caught with our proverbial pants down. From the sex and drug culture of the 1960’s and 70’s, through the greed, decadence, and decay of the 1980’s, to the acceleration of “political correctness” and acceptance of the 1990’s, I and many others are left wondering where the country our forefathers left for us has gone.   This is not solely a matter of Christian Ideals vs. Modern America, but indeed a matter of common decency and limitations vs. a spiraling staircase of moral relativity and lawlessness. The institution of marriage is the most basic foundation upon which a society or culture is founded. Marriage is sacred and binding, in part due to its purposeful exclusivity; not every human relationship qualifies as a marriage. The highest purpose for a marriage is the growth, cohesion, and support of a society. A man and a woman are joined in marriage, typically and ideally to have children whom they will raise, guide, and support into becoming productive and responsible members of the society to which they belong. Such is not the case with homosexual relationships. Homosexuals cannot reproduce together and raise a family; thereby passing along the greatest gift possible to their nation…it’s future.   When the seal of “one man and one woman” is broken from the sacred institution, it ceases to be sacred. While some may disagree, in opening marriage up to redefinition, we are opening up a Pandora’s box. Who now can look a man in his face who wishes to take on multiple wives and, as a matter of law, tell him why he may be prevented? The same applies to a man and woman of the same blood, and though it seems remote and even silly, what if such a case should arise. The ramifications upon our nation socially and economically of such a turn are unknown. Tax codes would have to be rewritten, issues of “discrimination” by clergy who refused to marry outside traditional lines would have to be dealt with, and the idea of what marriage means would have to be overhauled in the hearts and minds of every American both young and old.   Am I a bigot for holding the views that I do? Am I an unfit parent for teaching my children what our Christian beliefs mean? There are those who would say that I am. This is the “brave” new America in which I am raising my three little blessings. It is the America where God, morals, decency, limits, and the Ten Commandments are offensive, but nearly everything else goes. It is the America where the ACLU will defend the rights of an organization that actively promotes child molestation at the same time it sues my township to remove the Manger scene from “public property”.   Is gay marriage an irrelevant topic? Considering its connection with so wide a variety of issues all of such great import…hardly.

						   The question was posed: How is eternal damnation justifiable?   My answer:  My view of Eternal Damnation is a bit different. I believe that after the final judgement, when all is said and done, that the unsaved will be destroyed in the lake of fire. I have always found it interesting that the lake of fire is called "the second death". If you look at the strongs translation where it is said to fear God who can "destroy both body and soul in hell"...it is speaking of the lake of fire. Im sure there are alot of people who disagree with me, this is just my view. When our body dies, it ceases to fuction and live and eventually, ceases to exist (decomposes). I see no reason why the same does not apply to the soul in the "second death".   One argument I have heard against this view is that Revelation talks about the beast and the false prophet still being in the lake after 1000 years when they are joined by the dragon. My two main rebuttals are A) Who knows how long the process takes, and B) That all three are in essence evil spirits which are eternal. I have a theory that the reason God evicted Adam and Eve from the garden after the fall was so the could not eat from the tree of life and therebye become "immortal" with their sin still on them. Sin is atoned for by blood, without that, they would have been eternally condemened. Just my two cents.

						   Jerusalem is Mystery Babylon  Posted: May 28, 2004, 3:09 PM    Rev 17:1   "Come, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters, 2 with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth were made drunk with the wine of her fornication." 3 So he carried me away in the Spirit into the wilderness. And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast which was full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. 4 The woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the filthiness of her fornication. F91 5 And on her forehead a name was written: MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. 6 I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I marveled with great amazement.   ...18 And the woman whom you saw is that great city which reigns over the kings of the earth."     Micah 1   5 All this is for the transgression of Jacob And for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? And what are the high places of Judah? Are they not Jerusalem? 6 "Therefore I will make Samaria a heap of ruins in the field, Places for planting a vineyard; I will pour down her stones into the valley, And I will uncover her foundations. 7 All her carved images shall be beaten to pieces, And all her pay as a harlot shall be burned with the fire; All her idols I will lay desolate, For she gathered it from the pay of a harlot, And they shall return to the pay of a harlot."   8 Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked; I will make a wailing like the jackals And a mourning like the ostriches, 9 For her wounds are incurable. For it has come to Judah; It has come to the gate of My people-- To Jerusalem. 10 Tell it not in Gath, Weep not at all; In Beth Aphrah F1 Roll yourself in the dust. 11 Pass by in naked shame, you inhabitant of Shaphir; The inhabitant of Zaanan F2 does not go out. Beth Ezel mourns; Its place to stand is taken away from you. 12 For the inhabitant of Maroth pined F3 for good, But disaster came down from the Lord To the gate of Jerusalem. 13 O inhabitant of Lachish, Harness the chariot to the swift steeds (She was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion), For the transgressions of Israel were found in you.  Re: Jerusalem is Mystery Babylon [Jeremiah175]  Posted: May 28, 2004, 3:15 PM   21 How the faithful city has become a harlot! It was full of justice; Righteousness lodged in it, But now murderers. 22 Your silver has become dross, Your wine mixed with water. 23 Your princes are rebellious, And companions of thieves; Everyone loves bribes, And follows after rewards. They do not defend the fatherless, Nor does the cause of the widow come before them. 24 Therefore the Lord says, The Lord of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, "Ah, I will rid Myself of My adversaries, And take vengeance on My enemies. 25 I will turn My hand against you, And thoroughly purge away your dross, And take away all your alloy. 26 I will restore your judges as at the first, And your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you shall be called the city of righteousness, the faithful city." 27 Zion shall be redeemed with justice, And her penitents with righteousness. 28 The destruction of transgressors and of sinners shall be together, And those who forsake the Lord shall be consumed. 29 For they F2 shall be ashamed of the terebinth trees Which you have desired; And you shall be embarrassed because of the gardens Which you have chosen. 30 For you shall be as a terebinth whose leaf fades, And as a garden that has no water. 31 The strong shall be as tinder, And the work of it as a spark; Both will burn together, And no one shall quench them.

						   Letting go  Posted: Apr 14, 2004, 11:37 PM   Whether or not we realize it, each of us are playing roles in a grand drama. Our place in space-time and the steps of our days are set by Almighty God even before our birth. Once we understand that it is God, not us, who is in control, we can begin a process of letting go. It is irrelevant whether or not you believe that God sets the order of all. Ultimatley, regardless of ones willingness or lack thereof, we each preform the will of God.   The concept of "free will" as we understand it is an illusion. For true and full "free will" to exist, God would have to cease to be God. Our creator is all knowing, all seeing, and all powerful, and due to this He knows exactly what each of us is going to do before we do it and has the power to change them as He sees fit. This realization, when even partially grasped, is life changing. All things are given or allowed by God...nothing occurs outside of His will, and our failure to understand how or why has no bearing on that truth.   Hate, pride, greed, fear, and numerous other negative conditions stem from the illusion that anyone or anything besides an Almighty God is in control. Nothing is given that God does not grant or allow, and nothing is taken that God does not take or allow. Seek first His kingdom...  Jesus Christ (The Logos, expression representation,or manifestation of God) brought this very message that so many have failed to hear or understand.   You see,the sin of Adam and Eve was not their eating of the "forbidden fruit" it was their failure to trust God.

						   Elect of The Father, dearest Children of light  Posted: Nov 25, 2003, 2:01 PM       Elect of the Father, dearest Children of light:     Though the days grow increasingly perilous to the chosen of the Almighty, those predestined to salvation and everlasting communion with Him, be not afraid. The darkness which opposes us is but a brief shadow passing over the land heralding the coming of Christ Jesus and His kingdom. Flesh and blood is but a temporary condition of our experience. Dive deeply within yourselves and remember from whence we came, from the eternal and all powerful spring of life that is our creator. We are of the alpha and the omega, children of the I AM. No weapon of this dead world shall prevail against us by the grace of Him. What is more do not curse those who seem to wield those weapons as they are themselves wielded by principalities and powers which they do not know. As the King said as they crucified Him ‘They know not what they do’. The darkness can comprehend the light no more than a stone can comprehend a man. Even we being light do not yet comprehend what we are as we have not yet been fully revealed. We only know that when Christ comes we will see Him as He is and we will be like Him.   I thank my Father that He counted me worthy not only of creation but of Election within His kingdom, a gift which I do not yet fully grasp but know comes by His grace and love not by my own earning that I may boast. Yet I do boast but not of myself, I boast of the eternal, infinite, and immeasurable greatness of my Almighty Father. Let all His children praise Him forever and ever. My brothers and sisters I love you more than you know and wait with eager anticipation for us to be revealed and reunited. Children of God and subjects of Christ our King the time draws nearer so rejoice and give Him praise.

						   Laying to rest the idea of a pre-trib "rapture"  Posted: Dec 1, 2003, 2:56 PM        There are some matters of great import that need to be clearly explained. Read, test, and pray for understanding... Matthew 24:29 Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: 24:30 And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. 24:31 And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other .   This is "The Day of the Lord"...after the tribulation.   The Antichrist and all the military of the world will be gathered at Armageddon (see Isa 2:12, 13:6, 13:9, 34:8, Joel 1:15, 2:1, 3:14, Zeph 1:7, Zech 14:1, Jer 46:10, Ezek 13:5, 30:3, Ob 15, Mal 4:5, 1 cor 5:5, 2 cor 1:14, 1 thess 5:2, 2 pet 3:10)   Compare these with: Matt 24:29-31, Mark 13:24-27, Luke 21:25-28, Acts 2:19-21, 1 Thess 5:1-9, 2 peter 3:10-13, Rev 6:12, 8:12, 9:1-3, 11:15-19, 16:8-10, 16:17-21. 19:11-21   We are currently still in the "beginning of sorrows" described in Matthew 24:3-8   These sorrows may or may not (I believe it is likely with all things considered) coincide with the first 5 seals of revelation. I am also of the opinion that the trumpets and bowls run at the same time as they are nearly identical. The 6th of each describe the euphrates and the army that crosses it. Cross reference this with the above "Day of the lord" references and with Ezek 38 and 39:1-16 as well as Dan 11:33-45 and Dan 12.  Remember Ecclesiastes 1:9-11 “That which has been is what will be…” The 6th trumpet and bowl describe the army from the east coming to Armaggedon JUST PRIOR to “The Day of the Lord” or The 2nd coming.  As for the sealed 144,000 of Revelation 7:1-8, these are Jews who become Christians during the tribulation, possibly because of the two witnesses. The “Church” as in the body of Christ is still on Earth (read Rev 7:9-17, 12:16). Read the references to being “sealed” or having the “seal” in: Romans 4:11, 15:27,28, 1 Cor 9:2, 2 Cor 1:20-22, Eph 1:13, 4:30, 2 Tim 2:19, Rev 7:3, 9:4. The seal is of our salvation through coming to Christ.  I have been studying all these matters very diligently and hope that its seed bears some fruit with you. God Bless you all.

						   Good-bye America  Posted: Oct 15, 2003, 1:41 PM   I have a confession to make. I no longer care whether or not homosexual marriage becomes legal, whether the 10 commandments are publicly displayed, or whether "Under God" is taken out of the pledge. Before anyone thinks that I have gone mad or fallen away, let me state my case. I believe that the bell has already begun to toll for the United States. America has so abandoned the Lord our God and His law that the hedge of protection He has blessed us with for so long is being removed. Do not be deceived, this is no longer a Christian nation. I believe it is an eventuality that we will see gay marriage made legal, and God removed from the pubic arena as in the pledge and all public areas. As this is no longer a Christian nation, what occurs within it as it relates to secular society and public life is far less of my concern. What is my concern however is how this wayward nation and it’s misguided laws effect my freedom to practice my religion and otherwise serve God as His word calls me to. Secular law has no place dictating to me what parts of my religion I am free to express and practice, least of all within my home or house of worship. These lost people may control the streets and sidewalks, but not my home and inside the walls of my church. I will go and they may have this nation of theirs. They may keep their street, sidewalks, statehouses and public squares, but not our homes and temples. One fact however that they would do well to consider; every nation that has attempted to cast out God, His word, and people, has greatly declined or fallen altogether. They may ultimately remove us, but they will never remove God.

						   Children of God  Posted: Oct 4, 2003, 1:33 PM   Children of God   This is an interpretation that I have put together of verses from the bible that deal with God our Father and our relationship to Him as His children. We are quite literally Sons and Daughters (albeit "adopted" as only Christ is His begotten). I have put this together in the form of a letter to us as His children. I find it quite uplifting and inspiring and hope it does the same for at least one or two of you. This in no way is intended to be "the word of God" in its intended form, but an interpretive piece BASED ON His word. I hope you enjoy it.    Psalms:82:6: I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.  M´t:5:48: Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.  Ro:8:15: For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.  Ro:8:16: The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:  Ro:8:17: And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.  Ro:8:18: For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.  Eph:4:7: But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.  Eph:4:8: Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.  Eph:4:9: (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?  Eph:4:10: He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)  Eph:4:11: And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;  Eph:4:12: For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:  Eph:4:13: Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:  1Pe:3:22: Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.  1Jo:3:2: Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.  Re:2:7: He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.  Re:2:10: Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.  Re:2:17: He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.  Re:2:26: And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:  Re:2:27: And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.  Re:2:28: And I will give him the morning star.  Re:3:5: He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.  Re:3:12: Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name.  Re:3:21: To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.

						   Heirs of God  Posted: Aug 24, 2003, 5:49 PM   As Christians have been accused of arrogance time and again for claiming to have the truth, I have decided to give a response and in doing so bear the sum of the accusations of arrogance made against my Brothers and Sisters in Christ Jesus.   Christianity is the most influential, far reaching, history altering, world shaping "religion" to ever exist. It has spawned some of the greatest artistic works (i.e. writings, paintings, music, etc.) the world has ever seen. It has raised and thrown down countless kingdoms and rulers, and overthrown countless rival religions and ideologies. It's prophecies, both aged and modern, are without error which any unbiased examination will show, and is more "verifiable" or readily "proven" than any other faith. No attempt to overthrow Christianity as the dominant world religion has ever worked while many have tried. Christianity stands alone, without peer, towering over all other faiths.   As for Christians as individuals, take note;   Christians are Children of God, Heirs also, and fellow heirs with Christ.  In God, our Father and creator of all, we live, move, and exist. We are light in the Lord, children of light, and imitators of God as His beloved children. we are born of God and will be like Christ when He appears. We shall see God, be called sons of God, and ours shall be the kingdom of Heaven. We are sons of God through our faith in christ Jesus and have been clotheed with Christ whose spirit we have in our hearts. We were predestined to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to God our Father, and will be brought to glory. We are counted as CHILDREN, HEIRS, and SONS of God, not slaves promised only fruit and virgins for submission and alms. From Our Father through Christ Jesus, ours is the kingdom of Heaven. Furthermore we are promised through our faith and obedience   To eat of the tree of life (immortality)   Not hurt by the 2nd death   Hidden Manna (secret knowledge) and a white stone (innocence) with a new name (as we will be a completed new creation)   Authority over the nations (as Our Father gave to his only Begotten) and the morning star   White garments (purity), our name in His book, and confession of our name   Be made a pillar in the temple of God with the name of God, name of Gods city, and Jesus new name inscribed   and last but not least, the right to sit with Him on His throne   Many will scoff, be vulgar, degrade and run down both what I have said and my Brothers and Sisters but that does not and will not change what quite simply is. I do not boast about myself, but about my Father and my Lord and what has been done for me and my Brothers and Sisters in Christ. We are the elect, the chosen, and the predestined Children of God, and so may you all be through Christ Jesus alone for whose name we are hated. Accept Him and become one with us though Him. The grace of the Lord Jesus be with Gods people. Amen.

						   This email was sent to me by a friend. it's pretty cool.    Malachi 3:3 says: "He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver."    ("...And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall  purify the sons of Levites and purge them like gold and silver, that they  may  offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness...) KJV    This verse puzzled some people in a Bible study and they wondered what this  statement meant about the character and nature of God. One of the women in  the group  offered to find out the process of refining silver and get back to the  group  at their next Bible Study.   That week, a woman called a silversmith and made an appointment to watch  him at work. She didn't mention anything about the reason for her interest  beyond her curiosity about the process of refining silver.   As she watched the silversmith, he held a piece of silver over the fire and  let it heat up. He explained that in refining silver, one needed to hold  the  silver in the middle of the fire where the flames were hottest as to burn  away all the impurities.   The woman thought about God holding us in such a hot spot. Then she thought  again about the verse that says: "He sits as a refiner and purifier of  silver." She asked the silversmith if it was true that he had to sit there  in front of the fire the whole time the silver was being refined. The man  answered that yes, he not only had to sit there holding the silver, but he  had to keep his eyes on the silver the entire time it was in the fire.   If the silver was left a moment too long in the flames, it would be  destroyed. The woman was silent for a moment. Then she asked the  silversmith, "How do you know when the silver is fully refined?" He smiled  at her and answered, "Oh, that's easy - when I see my image in it."   If today you are feeling the heat of the fire, remember that God has His  eye  on you and will keep watching you until He sees His image in you. Pass this  on to everyone you know. Right now, this very moment, someone needs to know  that God is watching over them. And, whatever they're going through,  they'll  be a better person in the end.

						   Complacent Christians  Posted: Aug 6, 2003, 12:28 AM   Complacent Christians…it’s not you fault   We have come to a crucial time in the history of mankind. Soon the wheat will be separated from the tares, and the sheep separated from the goats. The world will be tested as gold in a furnace and every mans thought, word, and deed brought to light. The time for complacent, lip service Christians is drawing to a close.  Jesus called us to be a light on the hill, and to serve as a guide for the lost that surround us, and yet, there is hardly a light to be found. As I look at the world today, I am hard pressed to find the great contribution that Christians in America are making to the service of our Father in the name of Christ Jesus. Our supposed Christian country is a cesspool of greed, violence, idolatry, pride, sexual depravity, rebellion, and lawlessness.  “But I’m not to blame” we say. “I go to work everyday, come home to my family, pay my taxes, go to church, and give my tithes and offerings, what more can I do?”  What more can you do?  As you sit there right now, an innocent baby is being murdered and sucked from its mother’s womb. At this moment, a young girl is being coerced into giving away one of the things that is most precious…her virginity. As I speak there are people in this room in the world outside that are plotting how best to seduce you, your family, and your loved ones with pride, greed, envy, wrath, lust, gluttony, and sloth. There is a war going on, and most of you don’t even know it. This war isn’t in Vietnam, Iraq, Israel, Kosovo, Korea, or Afghanistan, it’s in our streets, our schools, our churches, and our homes. Furthermore, this war isn’t about democracy, oil, or power, it’s about good and evil, light and darkness, truth and lies, and it’s our soul and eternity, not national security that hangs in the balance.  But we Christians are so proud of ourselves and so busy patting each other on the back that we have fallen victim to the very things we claim to have escaped. If we have done so much and are so deserving of praise, then why were 1.3 million unborn babies murdered last year? Why did we just allow the president of our country, who is our representative to the world, conduct a war on the other side of the world on the false pretense of a threat to our national security? Why do drug dealers, pornographers, crooked ceo’s, corrupt public servants, and false teachers run rampant across this nation of ours? Like the ancient Romans, we are fed bread and given circuses to appease us…and it works. Single family homes are almost common place now and we wonder why our children are turning to their friends and the media for guidance. It takes a village to raise a child? Nonsense…it takes a real mother and a real father to raise a child, nothing more nothing less.   . We our so preoccupied with our social standing and our stocks quotes that the world we live in is imploding before our very eyes and we don’t seem to care or notice. But it’s not your fault. Our educational system is a laughing stock, and our children are suffering because we aren’t doing anything about it. When was the last time you spent more than 15 minutes talking to your child about school, or anything else that is going on in there lives for that matter? If you’re still thinking about it, it’s been to long. You had better sit down and start getting acquainted with your child, because if you don’t…someone else will, and you may wake up one evening to the news that you child is missing, pregnant, dead, or in jail. But it’s not your fault. Jesus is working in your life…right? Muslims have a bad reputation in post 9-11 America, but chances are when you run into a Muslim I bet you know it, regardless of their ethnic background. What do I mean by that? Let me tell you what I mean by that? If you run into your average Muslim on the street, you will know that they are a Muslim because their behavior will show it. Like them or not, Muslims are dedicated to what they believe in and give their lives over to it. Muslims are dedicated. They have a passion and zeal for their beliefs that is almost unmatched, and their beliefs are based on a lie! Here is a group of people willing to turn there lives inside out and remake everything that they are in the name of and in the service of what a God that isn’t even real. Tell me the last time you recognized someone being a Christian before they told you. Better yet, name the last time someone recognized you as a Christian without having to be told. Still thinking…take you time.  We are suppose to be in this world but not of it, unfortunately most Christians are almost more of this world than the people they are called to save. When is the last time you did any sort of community service, and writing a check to charity two or three times a year doesn’t count? Still thinking? My point is this, while we parade ourselves to the world as examples of how to live, our nation is falling down around us. Sin is eating us, our family, our friends, our neighbors, our cities, states, and country alive…but don’t worry, it’s not your fault.

						   All this talk of Bush, Kerry, suspension of elections, etc, is so quaint. Both Bush and Kerry are internationalists really if you look beyond just what they say. Bush clothes his internationalism with patriotism and talk of "spreading democracy" while Kerry, at least in the past, has been more overt in his expression of internationalist views (i.e. His 70´s interview with the ´crimson´). What many people seem to miss is that these are simply different roads leading to the same destination, which is a world scale "democratic" union of nations; think of it with a U.N. with teeth. After the failure of The League post-WWI we saw the creation of the U.N post-WWII which has also proven a failure though not to the degree of the league. Each great war led to a renewed attempt at international cohesion through a pseudo-government body. Add to this the formation of bodies like the E.U., the African Union, OPEC, Nato, etc, and you see this policy of Macro government on a multinational scale gaining ground. In the aftermath of WWIII, which I hold to be inevitable, you will see another such effort. This will not lead to a "world government" in the illuminati paranoid style some expect but a form of it none the less. As I said, we will have an enhanced U.N. with teeth. It will, IMHO, take on a form similar to the U.S. government. There will be a centralized International structure, under which there will be regionalized structures in the tradition of the E.U. which will in turn be made up of nation-states. Bush is advancing this trend mightily by his pre-emptive and basically unilateral military operations. If, and I believe more accurately when, this leads to a large scale regional, or world war, the end will see the world aching to avert the possibility of any such thing from happening again...enter the new U.N. I would be willing to wager that such a war will see the crippling or outright elimination of at least one or two of the countries involved, and a virtual decimation of the world economy.  &nbsp; As I see it, Kerry takes us the same route, but more likely sans the massively destructive war. He would more directly hand us over to such a system. I really don’t know if Bush even realizes that he is heading us in such a direction. I think he may indeed just be that blind. In any event, the outcome remains the same. The aftermath of this next fourth turning is highly likely to see a deepening commitment to citizenship in the ´world community´.

						   Updated Jul. 18, 2004 22:11 Israel has completed military rehearsals for a pre-emptive strike against Iran´s nuclear power facility at Bushehr, Israeli officials told the London-based Sunday Times. Such a strike is likely if Russia supplies Iran with fuel rods for enriching uranium. The rods, currently stored at a Russian port, are expected to be delivered late next year after a dispute over financial terms is resolved. An Israeli defense source in Tel Aviv, who confirmed that the military rehearsals had taken place, told the paper: "Israel will on no account permit Iranian reactors - especially the one being built in Bushehr with Russian help - to go critical." The source was also quoted as saying that any strike on the Gulf coast facility at Bushehr would probably be carried out by long-range F-15I jets, overflying Turkey, with simultaneous operations by commandos on the ground. "If the worst comes to the worst and international efforts fail," the source was quoted as saying, "we are very confident we´ll be able to demolish the ayatollahs´ nuclear aspirations in one go." The source noted that the strike could be accompanied by an attack on other targets, including a facility at Natanz, where the Iranians have attempted to enrich uranium, and a plant at Arak, which produces heavy water. In addition, the paper quoted a senior United States official warning of a pre-emptive Israeli strike if Russia continues cooperating with the Iranians. The Israeli source said Washington was unlikely to block Israeli military action. The paper also quoted from a classified document on the Iranian threat which was presented to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon earlier this year and which it claims to have seen. The document, entitled "The Strategic Future of Israel," was reportedly written by four of Israel´s senior defense experts and advocated military action against "countries which develop nuclear weapons." It described Iran as a "suicide nation" and recommended "targeted killings" of members of the country´s elite, including its leading nuclear scientists. Under an Iranian deal with Moscow, waste produced at Bushehr containing plutonium that could be used in bomb-making would be shipped back to Russia for storage. The procedure is to be supervised by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the nuclear watchdog. But according to the paper, the material must first cool, providing the Iran with what Washington fears could be up to two years in which to extract the plutonium. The paper quotes Israeli sources as saying that a quarter of a ton of plutonium could be produced each a year if Bushehr is fully functional, enough for 20 bombs. Israeli sources acknowledged, added the Sunday Times, that a pre-emptive strike against Iranian nuclear facilities could provoke "a ferocious response," which could involve Lebanese-based rocket attacks on northern Israel or terrorist attacks against Jewish and Israeli targets abroad. In a related development, London´s Sunday Telegraph reported that America´s bipartisan 9/11 Commission will this week report that Iran gave free passage to up to 10 of the September 11 hijackers just months before the 2001 attacks and offered to co-operate with al-Qaida against the US.

Bush named Iran as part of the Axis of Evil along with North Korea and Iraq almost three years ago. A US government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that military action would not be overt in changing Iran, but rather that the US would work to stir revolts in the country and hope to topple the current conservative religious leadership. The official said: “If George Bush is re-elected there will be much more intervention in the internal affairs of Iran.”

						   "Quietly and with minimal coverage in the U.S. press, the Navy announced that from mid-July through August it would hold exercises dubbed Operation Summer Pulse '04 in waters off the China coast near Taiwan. This will be the first time in U.S. naval history that seven of our 12 carrier strike groups deploy in one place at the same time. It will look like the peacetime equivalent of the Normandy landings and may well end in a disaster. At a minimum, a single carrier strike group includes the aircraft carrier itself (usually with nine or 10 squadrons and a total of about 85 aircraft), a guided missile cruiser, two guided missile destroyers, an attack submarine and a combination ammunition, oiler and supply ship. Normally, the United States uses only one or at the most two carrier strike groups to show the flag in a trouble spot. In a combat situation it might deploy three or four, as it did for both wars with Iraq. Seven in one place is unheard of. Operation Summer Pulse '04 was almost surely dreamed up at the Pearl Harbor headquarters of the U.S. Pacific Command and its commander, Adm. Thomas B. Fargo, and endorsed by neocons in the Pentagon. It is doubtful that Congress was consulted. This only goes to show that our foreign policy is increasingly made by the Pentagon. According to Chinese reports, Taiwanese ships will join the seven carriers being assembled in this modern rerun of 19th century gunboat diplomacy. The ostensible reason given by the Navy for this exercise is to demonstrate the ability to concentrate massive forces in an emergency, but the focus on China in a U.S. election year sounds like a last hurrah of the neocons. Needless to say, the Chinese are not amused. They say that their naval and air forces, plus their land-based rockets, are capable of taking on one or two carrier strike groups but that combat with seven would overwhelm them. So even before a carrier reaches the Taiwan Strait, Beijing has announced it will embark on a crash project that will enable it to meet and defeat seven U.S. carrier strike groups within a decade. There's every chance the Chinese will succeed if they are not overtaken by war first. . .

Assertions are made, and conclusions reached, concerning the propensity of people involved in anti-social or otherwise undesirable behavior or situations to be below average when measured for cognitive ability. The conclusions reached are summarized as follows:  &nbsp;  Poverty - Low IQ is a strong precursor of poverty, even more so than the socioeconomic conditions in which people grow up.  &nbsp;  Schooling - Low IQ raises the likelihood of dropping out of school before completing high school, and decreases the likelihood of attaining a college degree.  &nbsp;  Unemployment, Idleness and Injury - Low IQ is associated with persons who are unemployed, injured often, or idle (removed themselves from the workforce).  &nbsp;  Family Matters - Low IQ correlates with high rates of divorce, lower rates of marriage, and higher rates of illegitimate births,  &nbsp;  Welfare Dependency - Low IQ increases the chances of chronic welfare dependency.  &nbsp;  Parenting - Low IQ of mothers correlates with low birth weight babies, a childís poor motor skill and social development, and childrenís behavioral problems from age 4 and up.  &nbsp;  Crime - Low IQ increases the risk of criminal behavior.  &nbsp;  Civility and Citizenship - Low IQ people vote least and care least about political issues.

						   The purpose of this&nbsp;post &nbsp;is to discuss new/different forms of government in the event that the current ones now in place (democracy, communism, monarchy) prove to be long term failures. While reading about various other forms, one that caught my eye was called aristarchy which is a rule by the best. I do not know whether or not this has ever really been tried in its pure form, but on the surface, the idea sounds good. I would amend it to be a democratic aristarchy where candidates and voters alike must meet certain standards and requirements in order to participate in the process. This would limit the participation of unqualified or corrupted leadership and voters alike. My interest is peaked to the point that I plan on getting some more detailed ideas down on paper and submitting them here as time allows.  &nbsp;  Democratic Artistarchy: A constitutional representative democracy ruled by those qualified by standards prescribed under the national constitution.  &nbsp;  Voters Requirements- IQ of 100 or greater, a High school diploma, 21 years of age unless in military, no felony convictions, Proof of citizenship, and current income tax filings.  &nbsp;  Candidates Requirements- IQ of 120 or greater, a Bachelors degree, Prior public/community service, clean arrest record, natural born citizen and current income tax filings.  &nbsp;  Such would be a union of states, each with their own constitutions, under a centralized national structure, having a shared constitution, with strong leanings toward states rights. There would be an agreed upon code of national law with provisions for states to control civil matters. In criminal matters the national code would take precedence. Other issues to be addressed would be economic and trade law which between states could be settled at the state level but international trade would be governed at the national level.  &nbsp;  Government structure would work as follows.  &nbsp;  Locally (City/Town), there will be Executive/Legislative chairmanship, Legislative, and Judicial bodies. There would be one judicial and legislative official per 1000 citizens covering areas broken up into districts. The citizens of each district will elect their reps in the legislature and judiciary by democratic popular vote. The executive representative would be chosen by his/her peers from the legislative level and would act in effect as the chairman of the legislative council and city rep at the county level. There would also be a cabinet for education, transportation, etc, which would be selected by the council. In the judiciary, one judicial rep would be chosen per district, and one would be chosen by his/her peers to act as city justice rep at the county level.  &nbsp;  At the county level which would be made up of ten city/towns grouped by geographic region, the legislative and judicial branches would be made up of by reps from the city levels with one of each being chosen to represent the county at state level by their peers. This pattern would carry on with there being one rep for each state from those at county level and nationally from the state level. States would be represented by one legislative and judicial rep each, regardless of population. These people would make up the national legislative council and the national Supreme Court respectively from which one council member would become the national representative to the world and one Supreme Court justice would act as chief justice. In the unlikely event that one individual from the local level is chosen by his peers to move up to the national representative level, alternates will be chosen for local and county levels. There would be no need for national elections as the true power would be at the state level. The reason all voting by the people is done at state level is to negate bias in voting for representatives. As should seem obvious, candidates would be prevented from cast a vote for themselves in decisions of chairmanship as well.  &nbsp;  In the spirit of states rights, each state would maintain its own military which may be utilized at the national level only by a vote of state reps with a 3/4ths majority prevailing. In the interest of the security of the union, however, states will maintain open lines of intelligence sharing and joint military trainings.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; All matters of taxation will be handled apart from the national level. Their will be state income taxes, county sales tax, and local property tax. Any national expenses must win a 3/4ths vote and be contributed to equally by each state. These measures are all to ensure the strength of the state level. Business law would be dictated by the state unless operating or causing effect at a multi-state or multi-national level. By causes it is meant things transcending state territory such as airwaves, emissions, etc. Formal special interest lobbies would be illegal and campaign finance, though the only real “campaigning” would be at the local level, would prohibit anything but personal/individual contributions under $1000 dollars. This would be to limit the corrupting influence of money in the political arena.  &nbsp;  Quite obviously I am FAR from done, but wanted to give a sample of what I had in mind.

						   Posted: Thu Jul 08, 2004 10:50 am    Post subject: Article/commentary on 'The New Deal'       --------------------------------------------------------------------------------     urlLink THE NEW DEAL  BUILT  THE NEW WORLD ORDER  FDR A COMMIE OF THE FIRST ORDER   By: SARTRE   The New Deal had its feet of clay mired "one in the Red mud of Soviet communism and the other in the stinking cesspool of pagan plutocracy." ---Father Coughlin   When a nations fails to learn the true history of its past, the people are doomed to reside within a fairy tale of delusions. Once that deception becomes ingrained into the popular culture, the task of the tyrant simplifies. How soon the country is transformed into a civic ordeal and betrayal of principle and heritage. Then, the masses cling to the big lie as fact; the new gospel for the social order becomes transformed into a somber reality. Finally, only the very few question its veracity.   Most of us were born into a society that abandoned the essence of our founding country. The quiet revolution that destroyed America was conducted in full view and sanctified with government attainment. The past was buried without a solemn ceremony and the New Deal was born to reconstruct a fatherland upon the ashes of the American experience. The mother’s milk of this overthrow in fundamental values was based upon the Marxism of patrician traitors. FDR was the supreme socialist. His ideal was the total destruction of the balanced “Federalism” that shared power, affirmed State’s Rights and respected individual Liberty.      The blind and mentally deficient refuse to face the record of treachery that Roosevelt imposed. The deformed dictator shared a collective identity with Stalin, a lust for power that approached Hitler and a deceit only surpassed by Churchill. All four were allies of Socialism. Only slender degrees of separation and fabricated nuances of emphasis disguise their mutual love for totalitarian control over their own country and global vision.   The New Deal is pure Socialism. Communists are proud of their involvement with FDR: “When the Great Depression of the 1930s created conditions that made working-class victories both possible and necessary, if reaction and fascism was to be defeated, Communists were at the center of building of the new unions of the CIO, and providing the grassroots force that propelled the New Deal government of Franklin Roosevelt, the most advanced government of non-socialist reform in U.S. history, to enact social security and unemployment insurance, minimum wages and the 40-hour week, and create the National Labor Relations Board to protect workers rights to form unions and other major reforms.”   For citizens to look kindly upon Roosevelt and the mutated expansion patrimony of central planning, requires a total ignorance why the Revolution of 1776 was fought and the distrust and fears that founding patriots had towards an all powerful central government. When FDR’s close advisor Douglas said: "The present pseudo-planned economy leads relentlessly into the complete autocracy and tyranny of the Collectivist State", it was one of the few honest statement made during the New Deal.   Examine the real historic record of the New Deal and ask if the prospects of liberty and the pursuit of happiness were fostered by the alphabet soup federal agencies that converted our free enterprise and voluntary association country into a system of federal despotic command and control?   The core hoax of the last century is that the government is a force for reform that leads to improvement in the condition of ordinary citizens. The New Deal was a coup d’état designed by plutocrats, for installing an oligarchy, to achieve an autocracy, administered by quisling bureaucrats. The Wilsonian internationalist hallucination was consummated by Roosevelt. FDR was a Commie soul mate - Liberal Democrat style - of Uncle Joe.   FDR defined Freedom of Speech as Stalin did, i.e. he used the Marxist formulation 'Freedom of Information' in his speeches.   FDR pressed a bill to eliminate the right to bear arms, the guarantee of all others.   FDR told Churchill that "an unwritten Constitution is better than a written one." When reminded there was the Constitution, FDR said after his 1936 inauguration "Yes, but it's the Constitution as I understand it - flexible enough (to do what he wanted)." He admiringly told Churchill that Stalin didn't have to worry about Congresses and Parliaments, "he's the whole works." In a letter to a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, FDR wrote- " I hope your committee will not permit doubt as to Constitutionality, however reasonable, to block the suggested legislation."   FDR did not believe in Constitutional checks and balances - he tried to destroy and was prepared to defy the Supreme Court and Congress. He did not believe in advise and consent or the rule of law - he waged war and made treaties without Congressional approval. He did not believe in representative democracy and often said that since Congress did not reflect the will of the people they should be ignored.   Probably the best exposition of FDR's procedures regarding the rule of law vs the rule of men was said by his top deputy, KGB agent Harry Hopkins, to his aides - "I want to assure you that we are not afraid of exploring anything within the law, and we have here a lawyer who will declare anything you want to do legal."   FDR defined democracy just as Joseph Stalin did - as the mere act of voting.   The current crop of brainwashed trolls that praise Social Security as an enlightened benefit and Medicaid as advanced social compassion are already countered among the walking dead. Youth are indoctrinated to accept a Marxist orientation by prodigy freaks for a Satanic State. Black roped oppressors enforce the mandates of the temple of doom and incarcerate anyone they deem a vigilante. The legacy of the New Deal conditioned the fools to accept the New World Order.   Most inhabitants of the United States relish their subservient status and enthusiastically embrace their captivity. The most common attitude is that the world has become a global village for housing the thralls in a benign gulag. Accept your role, enjoy your condition and praise your masters . . . As long as any vestige of the New Deal is considered legitimate, the prospects for restoring a true Republic are futile. The notion of social benefits is abhorrent to any self respecting person. Government management by bribes is insulting. Conformity and coercion are inevitable when people relinquish their natural rights to oppose seduction from the rapist.   The incremental transformation into a global union under the rule of master elites has switched into high gear. FDR was a devil dining on the carcasses of manipulated naive citizens. What’s your excuse? Your parents and grandparents bought into the lie, so don’t claim any pretext that the next evolution into the New World Order will be beneficial. All Communists are Statists, every Fascist is a Statist and every form of Socialism is Statism. Each are un-American, the New Deal set the stage for the NWO.

						   I'm going on record as saying Edwards is the VP pick. I've felt this way for a bit but not posted as much. I guess we will all find out who will be the other guy to lose the election by Tuesday night.  In addition I am taking this occasion to say that Kerry will not win in november. I'm not saying Bush will WIN but I am saying Kerry will lose. Either Bush will win outright, we will have a repeat of November 2000, or the election will not take place.

						   TREASON!!!  Posted: Jul 3, 2004, 7:32 AM   These men should be arrested and tried for treason! How long will we abide turncoats such as these before we act? The enemy is on our shores, dwelling within our borders, and walking our halls of government...enough! Seize these traitors and put them in chains before it is too late!   US lawmakers request UN observers for November 2 presidential election   Fri Jul 2, 2:22 AM ET Add Politics - AFP to My Yahoo!    http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=1521&e=3&u=/afp/us_vote_congress   WASHINGTON (AFP) - Several members of the House of Representatives have requested the United Nations (news - web sites) to send observers to monitor the November 2 US presidential election to avoid a contentious vote like in 2000, when the outcome was decided by Florida.     Recalling the long, drawn out process in the southern state, nine lawmakers, including four blacks and one Hispanic, sent a letter Thursday to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan (news - web sites) asking that the international body "ensure free and fair elections in America," according to a statement issued by Florida representative Eddie Bernice Johnson, who spearheaded the effort.    "As lawmakers, we must assure the people of America that our nation will not experience the nightmare of the 2000 presidential election," she said in the letter.    "This is the first step in making sure that history does not repeat itself," she added after requesting that the UN "deploy election observers across the United States" to monitor the November, 2004 election.    The lawmakers said in the letter that in a report released in June 2001, the US Commission on Civil Rights "found that the electoral process in Florida resulted in the denial of the right to vote for countless persons."    The bipartisan commission, they stressed, determined "that the ´disenfranchisement of Florida´s voters fell most harshly on the shoulders of black voters´ and in poor counties." Both groups vote predominantly Democratic in US elections.    The commission also concluded, the lawmakers added, that "despite promised nationwide reforms (of the voting system) ... adequate steps have not been taken to ensure that a similar situation will not arise in 2004 that arose in 2000."    Thirty-six days after the November 7, 2000 presidential election, after several state court interventions and vote recounts in numerous Florida counties, the US Supreme Court ruled in favor of Republican George W. Bush, awarding him all of Florida´s 25 electoral votes.    The ruling tipped the balance against Democratic contender and then vice president Al Gore (news - web sites), who with 267 electoral votes lost to Bush´s 271, only one more than the minimum 270 needed to clinch the presidential election.  _________________________________________   -Christ's Kingdom is not a Democracy-   http://jeremiah175.blogspot.com/   private reply   edit  quoted reply  reply    Jeremiah175  User    Post: 2 of 31  Views: 165    reference  Re: TREASON!!!

Posted: Jul 3, 2004, 8:07 PM   To avoid the abuses of the English law, treason was specifically defined in the U.S. Constitution (definitions of other crimes were not deemed necessary). Article 3 of the Constitution thus provides that treason shall consist only in levying war against the United States or in giving aid and comfort to its enemies and that conviction may be had only on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act or on confession in open court.  Following is the list of the 191 Member States of the United Nations with dates on which they joined the Organization. Examination of this list will reveal more than one state that could easily be listed as an enemy of the United States, and as an open invitation to the U.N to monitor the November 2004 elections would provide those enemies with aid and comfort, those making said invitation are guilty of treason.
