      Basketball training was real shit ma...Jia Hao was late...told me to be at the damn court at 6pm...and he turned up at 8...wtf man...and Eugene intendition foul me when i was about to shoot...landed on my elbow...stupid man...sure is crap...but it's ok...training was unproductive and we played with some china guys...damn man...their defences was top notch i have ever seen...Sloth descibed it as 'Hen Yong Li'....meaning using alot of strength...i was the next team...i didn't believed him until i played...and HOLY crap...it was certainly difficult to get past their defences...and bloody hell...i was chagred and cuts were on my forearm...and my sole was aching..thanks to Eugene's crappy 'FOUL'...and then after that some bitches and their coaches came out of nowhere and use the damn court...what could i do ? i had no choice to view what they were capable of...man... it was SHIT ! REAL SHIT....their fast break was so slow...and so was their ball handling...their passes was screwed up...so much for their 'training for Youth Cup'.....man...they won't get anywhere with so many mistakes....but that's their problem....

          Alpha Platoon 2004 A.K.A Part A. I first meet these bunch of kids in feb....Seems like yesterday when i first took them...When i first met them...they moved and adjust in a platoon....talk and talk...these kids don't have respect for me...but then...i never once gave up on them...everytime drag their boots...t-shirts tucked out...Bing Hao never stopped smiling...together with Ee Shi and Galvin...but i don't blame them..they are still new...i can feel that they are special...in some way or another...it doesn't matter...times passes...everytime training Spencer doesn't come for training...Kay Liang and a whole lot bunch of people...Everytime i looked at them...they reminded me of me when&nbsp;I was in secondary 1 in NCC...reaching may and june...attendence begin to increase...of course it is everyone's effort...but as time passes...words like "No!...Don't adjust !...Very Good!...Know it Down" became my common terms with them...Everyday...i've wished that i could step down as fast as possible...but today...after 3PM...i changed my mind...i wish i could have more time with them....The Alpha Platoon...so Guys...don't disappoint me....Do your best...I have high hopes for everyone of you all....

      Everybody's got something they had to leave behind One regret from yesterday that just seems to grow with time There's no use looking back or wondering How it should be now or might have been Oh this I know but still I can't find ways to let you know  I've never had a dream come true Till the day that I found you Even though I pretend that I've moved on You'll always be my baby I never found the words to say You're the one I think about each day And I know no matter where life takes me to A part of me will always be with you  Somewhere in my memory I've lost all sense of time and tomorrow can never be cos yesterday is all that fills my mind There's no use looking back or wondering How it should be now or might have been Oh this I know but still I can't find ways to let you go  I've never had a dream come true Till the day that I found you Even though I pretend that I've moved on You'll always be my baby I never found the words to say You're the one I think about each day And I know no matter where life takes me to A part of me will always be  You'll always be the dream that fills my head Yes you will, say you will, you know you will Oh baby, you'll always be the one I know I'll never forget There's no use looking back or wondering Because love is a strange and funny thing No matter how I try and try I just can't say goodbye No no no no  I've never had a dream come true Till the day that I found you Even though I pretend that I've moved on You'll always be my babyI never found the words to say (words to say) You're the one I think about each day And I know no matter where life takes me to A part of me will always be A part of me will always be with you

      1415...i was dismissed from class...went to toilet changed...went to eat...seeing so many people changed into pe attire/jerseys..today is the Basketball 3 on 3  for upper secondary...just what...i drawed lots and the first match..VS Wu Ming Dui...next...5A...i couldn't ask for any worse...but still...i encouraged my teams..ok...starting 3...Mu Song...Kelvin and Myself...starting they scored first...then as time passes...the score for first half is 5-10....man..sure is depressing...second half...all full of mistakes...cause of me...i give lazy passes...and i can't hit open shots...missed a couple of lay ups...i'm the cause of my team's defeat...man....after the match...i still continued to do my part....pushing them on...socre ?? huh.....20-14...screwed up....the 7 points that we lost....i'm the cause of it...next match...VS 5A...Mu song told me that i wants to start at the second half...ok...i let him rest...so starting would be Eugene..Kelvin and Myself..again it was alot of mistakes...the score was even more demoralising after the first half...Mu Song was talking to me...but I wasn't listening....and he just threw it in my face...man...at that point of time i just broke down...wishing that she was with me...WISHING THAT SHE WAS HERE......but sadly...she's not... "wei wanted to tell her how much she means to me....but then....i know she'll tell me...'We're impossible" if i were to tell her......man....can I really tell her...i don't care what she was to tell me....all I wanted is just to let her know..like this I know that i've tired my best.....that was what is on my mind...before the second half...i already know what is the outcome of the second half.....forcing my whole body and mind to stand up....i just surived the onslaughter......man....all this makes up the Limitation of My Tolerance
