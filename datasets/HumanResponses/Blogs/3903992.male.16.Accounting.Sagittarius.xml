      I could tell when someone was thinking about me. I knew when they spoke of me. My ears would burn. My head would pound. They are all watching me. But what for? Am I a threat to them? Are they a threat to me? They even speak my name. Usually when I am by myself. That way no one else can hear them in my head. It would get loud. Really loud. I could sometimes not hear others speak. The lights would flicker but only I would notice. Distractions they liked. Making my hands look different. Making people think differently of me. And the yelling... I was always being yelled at. Not by family. The teacher. She was always yelling. I would think something and she would yell at me like I said it out loud. She knows what's going on. But the pain. This spot on my head would kill. And then it would move to different parts of my head. My fingers were always numb. Then my hands. They would tingle alot. I saw it behind the pipes. The eyes. Watching me. Why can't they just leave? But where would they go? They took my emotion. I cannot feel sadness. Sometimes I dream of the future. I know this because the dreams come true. My potatos tasted funny that night. My mother - My own mother! - had put something in them taste minty. I cant remember the rest of the night. All black. I dont remember to eat. I no longer feel hunger. I have to remember to eat just to stay alive. I dont want to die you know. I will never die. They can't make me. No one else can see them. They dont let them. They want control. Thats all they want is control. But no me. No, they will never control me. Never. My mind will blow them away. But I cannot let them know this. I have to shut down. Build a wall of brick. I don't even like pudding that much. And the thoughts make no sense. They come to me at the speed of light. They don't relate to each other. I get looked at funny because of this. Nobody understands my thoughts. I can make sense out of them but no one else can. It leaves the world to suffer without my knowledge. If only they all knew what I know. Boy! What a world we could have!

      Red - His lover's hand gently strokes his cheek as he remembers the past months. The constant fear of being found out. Every look, every movement could have given his feelings away. How many nights did he spend drinking, trying to forget everything? He remembers the almost physical pain it was causing him, remembers the pain he was causing himself.   Green - A finger touches the scars on his wrist. He can recall every little detail about that one night. It had all become too much. Too much for him to bear. Too much to just go on. Too much to live with. He remembers the sweet pain the razorblade was causing when it cut through his skin, remembers the beauty of the deep red blood dripping down, staining the expensive champagne coloured carpet of his hotel room.  Blue - He feels his darling's soft lips brushing his neck. The first moments after waking up in hospital come to his mind. The sterile room, the needle in his arm, the plain white sheets... He remembers trying to shade his eyes from the blazing sunlight that the cream coloured curtains can't keep outside and feeling too weak to lift his arm.  Pink - He smiles as his lover's soft breath tickles his ear. He can almost see the look on his friends' faces when they entered the room, can see HIS look, the concern in his eyes, the love. It was then when he confessed his love, all teary-eyed and scared of being rejected. But it had to be let out.   Gold - As their mouths meet, he feels himself drift back to the present. This is where his thoughts belong. This is IT.  After a long divine kiss, their lips part and he smiles again. "I love you, Brian," he hears him whisper into his ear. "I love you, too, Steve," he replies as they watch the fireworks slowly dying down...excited about beginning their first year together.
