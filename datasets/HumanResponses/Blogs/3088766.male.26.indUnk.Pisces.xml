        urlLink XBT Tracker   The latest version is 0.0.6 [May 21, 2004]   Overview  XBT Tracker is a BitTorrent tracker written in C++.

XBT Tracker listens on port 2710. The announce URL is http://...:2710/announce. The debug URL is http://...:2710/debug. The scrape URL is http://...:2710/scrape. An experimental UDP tracker extension is also supported via announce URL udp://...:2710.
