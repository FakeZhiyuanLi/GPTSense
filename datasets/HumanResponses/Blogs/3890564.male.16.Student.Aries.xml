       Ok with&nbsp; a title like that i think you&nbsp; all know what i'm going to talk about.I'M SICK TO DEATH of being&nbsp; alone.I know it sounds like i have no friends which I do&nbsp; and i love them all but they all have lives and money so they are having the    times of their lives and I'm &nbsp;  just sittting here in &nbsp;  house looking after two brats who get everything.I feel like a male version of cinderella just waiting for a fairy god-whatever to give my the dream.     Thinking about it I feel that selfishness leads to what i'm trying to reach.But too much of it makes people sick and lonely.     Song for the day: &nbsp; Celebrity Skin by HOLE      &nbsp;

        Alternative rock!  You're the very interesting side of rock...  You sometimes reach the masses, like Placebo, but mostly you're underground and stay true to your musical roots...  Just keep what you're doing and churn out that good stuff!    urlLink   What genre of rock are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
