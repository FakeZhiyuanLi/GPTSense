      yesterday me and Rick were practising some jumps on the beach, with his new flysurfer 10m2 psycho2, and after a while, we had no problem anymore with the frontroll, and the backroll we were practising, so we tried to figure out something new to practise, so we came up with a whole new version of the frontroll! I don't know for sure if this trick is completely new, but I've never seen it before. We call it the jesus christ frontroll, and the idea kind of came from a windsurf magazine I was reading yesterday. In that magazine I saw Robby Naish doing a tabletop, with one hand, and they called it the jesus christ.  The jesus christ frontroll is kind of the same idea. You jump, the same way as you would with a normal frontroll, and then you do a raley, with the hand on the side in witch you are heading to spreaded out,and your other hand, still on the bar, but on the wrong side of it. (your righthand is now in the air, and your left hand is on the leftside of your bar.) To make this look good, you have to be totally horizontal, and your arms spreaded like you're jesus christ on his cross... After this, pull your legs in, and dive into a frontroll, and land it!  pictures and film of this jump will come soon! email me or rick if you wanna see it.

      I'm back from france and it was great!!! Jorick had borrowed me A 8.0 Naish X3 just in time, and I borrowed a board from a friend of mine, but I haven't kitesurfed there, because it was too dangerous. every morning the wind was blowing to the west, but after a while it turned from west to east, in 5 min., and that 10 times a day... But it was great anyways, the weather was great, and I had a great time. Special thanks to jorick for borrowing that kite!

      What   Sari   means is very simple: Sam Rick :) take the first two letters of each name and... voíla! you got a name. It's also some kind of clothing in India, but that has nothing to do with us. please feel free to leave a comment about what you think of the name. :)

      Yesterday, when I thought about Robby Naish, I thought he was a very arrogant A-hole. I didn't like him. And all that just because I heard some rumours from friends of mine who worked with him back in the days.. But today I saw the living legend who Robby Naish is, on an MTV show about red bull king of the air.. He was being interviewed by this guy who just doesn't seem to give a f*ck about how famous you are, and that interview completely changed my mind about Robby Naish. I totally respect the man. I even met Robby Naish once.. It was at the Kiteboard Masters in Scheveningen two years ago. I just arrived there with my dad and a friend of mine, when he bumped in to me, and I didn't recognize him at first.. I said hi to him, and he said sorry for bumping in to me, but I didn't mind it at all! it was more an honour, that the worlds most famous kitesurfer/windsurfer ever bumped in to me... Later that day I talked to him again after he had done a heat, and I asked him how it went, and then he just started explaining to me what he thought went well, and what he thought went wrong, and he asked me if I kitesurfed myself! at that time I haven't started kiteboarding yet, but I told him I would very soon... when I think of all this now, I can't believe why I thought he was such an A-hole.. next time I'll think twice before thinking anything about someone..

      me and Rick are working on this random extreme sports movie called: Safety first, It's a movie with both extreme sports as just random stupidness.. but it's fun. all we have now is just us jumping off sanddunes, and a little sandboard action, and me breaking my ankle when jumping off a 4 meters high dune.. but we are still filming, today we filmed a little skimboard shizz but it wasn't all that spectacular.. it's going to contain a lot more kitesurfing, and snowboarding too. If you wanna see it, e-mail me!

      here's a link to a picture gallery containing pictures taken at the surf's up event at Wijk aan Zee. It was a very fun event, I was there everyday, and I was at the soulparty at Timboektoe, the place to be if you're a surfer. Rick was there too the second day and he even kitesurfed there. he was about the only one on the water with a psycho2 10m2, all the other kites didn't even stay in the air :), as you can see on the photos.
