      Quote of the day:  Now I'm gonna have to ask the guy at the hardware store for weiner-colored touch-up paint!  -Yes Dear  ROFL  So there was this guy I was convinced I was going to marry when I was a kid...he looked so hot in that ensign's uniform.....  We WERE meant to be together, after all.  And MY GOSH blogger highlighted an up and coming book deal..... urlLink Wil Wheaton is an actual person people!

      DUDE!  Can I just say it is SO good to be alive.    Check out the number one winner of Britain's Blogger awards!  Congratulations to the urlLink  Big Smoker.   Very cool site.  Do play  urlLink Shuffle the Penguin  while there.  It's quite addictive.  Kudos to urlLink  John Stewart  on his recent appearance on the cover of Newsweek.        Gee golly gosh, Francine....that John Stewart fella is just the keenest! Wonder if his wife believes in sharing......  And may I just add that while this certainly has not always been true, and will probably not remain true, I cannot stand the thought of having a cell phone.  I'm a single mom of a two year old who works full time and goes to school full time.....why in the world would I want everyone who I know (including my exhusband) to be able to reach me at any given time.  A phone, ringing incessantly, screaming,"Give me all your attention now and I dont care WHAT you're doing!" is not my idea of something either convenient or necessary.  God forbid it contain bluetooth technology.

      According to an article  urlLink Troy Roebuck  read on the radio this morning as I was driving to work,   urlLink sex actually improves the functions of the brain , thereby making one more intelligent and better able to retain information.  As was further explained, this is due to the intense stimulation provided to the neurons (a neuron "workout", if you will....) and the copious amounts of otherwise fairly low-level chemicals that flood the brain (e.g., adrenaline, etc.).  So obviously, the nerd factor has got it all over the rest of the world as far as the bedroom (or whereever) is concerned, right?     "Sex.  It's what's for dinner."  -- urlLink Young Amy

      So after viewing the latest blog from Big Man, my immediate response was  1)  What the freak?  Is that....Jaime?! 2)  How much does this woman look like me....since she IS his perfect woman and all........ 3)  What is he doing at match.com?  eh.....we've almost got the same hairstyle.  thats about where it ends.     ....And $20,000.00 to complete my robot.  my GIRL robot.    This is gonna be the best prom ever.   And after following the link....and taking the personality test.....i received this email.  Surprising true and perceptive.  Although, I think must add that while I agree that my "ideal" man is a rare gem and extremely hard to find, I think he wasn't given enough credit and yes.....I found him.  idealistic but practical.  passionate but rational......    About this report  We've customized this report based on your answers to the test. Some results will be very accurate while others may miss the mark.    Who You Are  You're adored, and for good reasons You're a woman with a very balanced personality and lifestyle. You believe in making room in life to relax, think, and have fun. You refuse to settle long-term for a boring job or doing something just because it's expected of you. Love is the same way. You know what real love feels like and you'll accept no imitations! You pride yourself on not being the "typical woman." You're more honest and straightforward than most women. But just because you don't "wear your heart on your sleeve" doesn't mean you lack deep feelings. In fact, you're deeply committed to your loved ones and the causes you believe in. Women as truly balanced as you are very rare.   What's dating all about to you? Falling in love is a spiritual experience for you. A truly loving relationship helps bring meaning to your life. You try hard to make your date feel comfortable and have a good time. You're good at anticipating what other people need and giving it to them. But inside, you're usually on an emotional roller coaster. You don't want to reject nice men, but also take it very personally if you're the one rejected. You're constantly trying to find the "rules" for successful dating but often find they don't work.  Although having a vision of what you want can be helpful, the risk is that your high standards and rush to find the perfect man can get in the way of loving a real-life imperfect man. It won't come naturally to you, but you're more likely to find what you want if you can sit back, "go with the flow," and see where dating leads you.   Here's how you compare with other women your age         How unique is your type? Your personality profile is similar to a number of women your age. Looking at over 10,000 women who have taken the test, about 12% (or 1 in 8 women) have very similar beliefs, values, and habits. Of course, the way these qualities are expressed in you is what makes you so unique.  How many other women have personalities like you?      Quirks men notice Like all women, you have your strengths as well as your quirks and shortcomings. Ultimately, you want to find someone who will love and accept you "warts and all." Though you have lots of friends, it's important to have at least one person in your life who understands.      * You have a pretty even-tempered personality and may not have any especially annoying or quirky habits. Of course, seeming to be "perfect" could be seen as a flaw by some, in which case you may just want to pretend to have a bad habit!  Do men like your type? Notice that 40% of men are generally attracted to your personality type. 9% say they are VERY attracted. With the millions of people on Match.com, that translates into lots of potential matches.  How many men are attracted to your type?       Who You're Looking For  He'll be an enigma You're looking for a very balanced man. He'll have clear goals in life and dreams he hopes to pursue while still being practical about the realities of life. He's a good man to turn to in a crisis. He can stay calm and think clearly even when he's stressed. He has a reserved and quiet side and can be a little hard to get to know, especially emotionally. But he's worth the effort! He's a fun and free spirit, but will still show up on time for every date. Sound too good to be true? Men who are truly balanced like this are rare, but they do exist and would be an excellent fit for you.  You don't expect your partner to be in a good mood all the time. You understand that sometimes your partner will be down, get pessimistic or worry too much. These days are balanced by the many good days the two of you will share. In fact, you share a number of positive qualities, including:      * No strong similarities were detected, which suggests that you may be more attracted to certain "opposite qualities." Please read the next sections to see if you may be seeking someone with different or opposite qualities to balance your own habits and style.  Here's how you compare to your "ideal" partner      Number of men your type Men with the exact type of personality you prefer are rare gems. Looking at over 10,000 men who have taken this test, only 6% (or 1 in 16 men) have the exact combination of similarities and contrasts in personality you find extremely appealing.  However, there's a larger group, 30% (or 1 in 3 men), who have most, but not all, of the qualities and habits you like. These subgroups are charted below.  Over half of the men have at least some of the traits you find attractive.  But you'd have a negative reaction to 5% (or 1 in 20 men), who have some or many of the characteristics you clearly dislike.  How many men are your "ideal" type?     Finding someone like you You want to share your life with someone who has the same values, goals, and style you have. Research has shown that couples who have more in common tend to stay together longer. The qualities you find attractive (and unattractive) in men suggest you would certainly be happier with a man who's more like you.      * No very strong opposites were detected, which suggests that you are most attracted to men who are very similar to you. This is good news since similar couples tend to stay together longer.  Quirks you can tolerate The truth is that everyone is potentially "high maintenance." We all have our quirks and shortcomings. The key to long-term harmony is finding a man who can tolerate (or maybe even enjoy) your "quirks," or the little personal oddities that make you unique. You seem okay with several common quirks that might come along with your "ideal" man:      * You described a pretty balanced person as most attractive to you, so no strong quirks were noted. Watch out for quirks during dating, since they may indicate a strong quality that is hidden at first.  Downside of your "ideal" In addition to his quirks, your "ideal" personality type may have other qualities that are more frustrating or challenging to deal with. Under stress, his quirks can become serious "flaws." But remember, these quirks are the "flip side of the coin," or the extreme end of qualities you otherwise find appealing. So, be prepared if:      * Because you're most attracted to men with balanced personalities, no troubling differences were noted. Nevertheless, remember that too much similarity can lead to conflict as well, especially when problems call for very different perspectives or actions.  Deal breakers You seem ready to adapt to the good and frustrating qualities of the men you're looking for, but there are types of men you clearly do NOT like. Men's habits and attitudes you'd have a hard time putting up with include:      * Men who wait until the last minute to make plans (for weekend fun, for example) and even seem to resist your attempts to plan activities ahead.  Trade-offs you'll face   Sex  Lots of sexual passion As you probably know, you have a higher sex drive than most! You give and receive pleasure easily, whether it's sexual or simply an affectionate touch. The connection you feel from making love energizes and comforts you in a way most people wouldn't understand.  Among women your age, your particular combination of sexual drive and interests is similar to about 1 in 8 women (12%).  Is he sexually compatible? You're looking for someone who really enjoys the "basics" sexually. You value the quality of sex, even if it means the quantity or frequency of sex is lower than you'd like.  What's ahead for you sexually? If you end up with a man less sexually charged than you, you'll have two options: open up your partner's "wild," sexual side or settle into a relationship with less sex, but more affection. These can be tough questions for someone like you. If he's less interested in making love, it'll be hard not to feel rejected. You're prone to worry and read a lot into situations. But fortunately, you have amazing intuition and compassion as to how this affects both of you. Although it's tough, you're also brave enough to talk about your sex life with your partner. A good man will understand your need for reassurance and may be willing to meet you half way sexually.  How you and your "ideal" partner compare       Attraction Science  What is personality? Personality is the set of traits and characteristics that make each of us unique yet relatively stable and consistent over time.  - People see and interpret the world differently. - They want different things. - They make decisions differently. - They get excited and energized by different situations. - They structure their careers, social life, and private time in different ways.  What does personality have to do with attraction? The way in which people are similar or different in personality strongly affects their attraction to one another. Two people with similar values are more likely to become (and stay) friends or a couple, indeed part of compatibility is having "common ground." However, for many people, compatibility may also involve a balance between each other's quirks and differences.  Where did the test come from? The test you just took is the most scientifically grounded and customized personality assessment on the Internet. It's a "smart" test because it can tailor specific questions to you based on your earlier choices so no one gets exactly the same questions. The content of the tests and the game-like way the choices were presented are the result of over 15 years of research by the scientists at weAttract.com, Inc.

      Don't  fall asleep on a job interview. Don't have a car rental raffle for The Donald's benefit.  Stupid idea. Don't dig for buried treasure on the beach in Atlantic City in front of a national TV show camera especially for a show that is a HIT! Don't lose.   It's easier to think big.

      Well this week's episode of everyone's favorite money game appears to simply be a stall effort in the form of a "let's hit the highlights and laugh together" episode.   Yeah.....wasn't all that memorable, although it did show Omarosa to be the whiney lil "B" everyone already knew she was.  ------------------  Big Man suggested that a certain printer company might be in dire straights if South Korea closes its borders to foreigners and  any derogatory issue arises with China......this particular company's two main manufacturing sites (at least SOMETHING in the industry hasnt flown to India).  Check out  urlLink this article  on China in the last issue of the Economist.....no big surprises.   The world has already accepted the capitalism leaking through the ranks of Chinese government in an effort to sustain its phenomenal economic growth -- even if the Chinese haven't.   In addition:   China needs 12m-15m new jobs every year just to keep pace with its population growth. It has to provide opportunities for the 800m people living in rural areas who have been left behind by the current boom, and a third of whom are under- or unemployed. It also has to deal with the 100m-150m migrant workers in the cities who have no job security, no long-term housing and no health care....Currently there are worries that the economy is overheating. Bubbles are beginning to form in property, steel and cars, and power generation is running up against capacity constraints. China's real problem, however, is not inflation but overinvestment....Even for a developing economy, China's level of investment is unusually high....Only a very high domestic savings rate—around 40% of household income—and the uncontrolled exploitation of its natural resources make it possible for China to waste capital on this scale...   The economy as it's currently being "handled" (or not) is completely unsustainable.  Consider:     Professionals returning from a meeting or conference in the one area of the country yielding extensively high returns assumes the rest of the country (which is HOW large?) is yielding like returns and rejoices in the manna from heaven sure to be found in China today, tomorrow, and forever.  Meanwhile, the "communist" government has no idea how to run or maintain a capitalist society as their playbook doesn't allow for the rules or variances necessary to govern such.  Oh yeah.  They'll so completely be able to maintain a 9% economic growth perpetually.      If they have a guiding philosophy, it owes nothing to Mao or Marx, but is best summed up by Deng Xiaoping's famous dictum: “It doesn't matter whether the cat is black or white, as long as it catches the mouse.”     I love The Economist.  --------------------------  Random:  Sounds like a bad joke but.....  Why do Chinese women wear pin-striped gloves with pink condoms on the pointer and ring fingers?     _________________  On the up side, India's economy is waning as ITs there discover their balls and demand more than the approximate $0.33 per hour.  Score one for domestic egineers.

      We went and saw the movie  urlLink Hidalgo  this weekend.....It was good.  It was about a man and his relationship with his heritage, himself, his country, and his horse.   There was alot of sand.  And it was a smidgeon long.....and i must admit, there were times when I just thought Viggo was so completely urlLink  Aragorn .  Couldn't tell if he was really speaking an Indian language or some derivative of Elvish.....All around, it was a very good movie.   And it inspired a wonderful conversation from big man later about the things you see in the desert....  urlLink  University of Kentucky  rocks.  May I just say, UK ROCKS SO FREAKIN HARD!!!  I can hardly believe they got FIRST SEED!  I know, I'm such a schmuk....I was so convinced that UK was gonna finish the season as second half losers, perpetually winning every first half only to lose in the second.....THANK HEAVEN I WAS WRONG!!!  Tubby....man.....I LOVE Tubby......    We also went to the  urlLink Greater Louisville Area New Car Show .  Harold and I fell in love with the new 2005 Ford GT....pure sex on wheels.  Nummy.:     We also both REALLY liked the new Volvo S60.....     And i just.....LOOOOOOOOOOVE the Toyota Prius.....     not a sexy car, but ROOMY!!!  and comfortable.......and 60 miles to the gallon......cant beat that.....

Can I just say WHAT THE FREAK WAS THAT MARKETING FIRM THINKING?  Why did accounts payable at AXE pay the invoice?!  That commercial ranks right up there with the Lamisil troll.  ______________  OH GEEZZZZZZZ.....hav eyou seen this story in the economist?.........oil prices......up......for a long time.....THANKS  urlLink SHELL !!!    maybe that explains the Dow....  ______________   Kerry.   Early on leading in the polls according to what we're told.  Big man says he's no Clinton (ie, charisma, undisputed intelligence......undisputed lack of scruples hehehehe...a-hem), but I think the man has surprising charisma and from what little I've seen from the biased liberal media, an ability to persuade and excite.  Election year is, after all, more about showmanship than anything else.   urlLink But check this out .  Man, I love  urlLink The Economist .  Don't always agree with them though.  It was reported yesterday on the evening news that Kerry was in secret meetings with Washington Foreign Amabassadors attempting to pin down his foreign policies platform......The thought occurs to me that if it were really "secret" the evening news wouldn't actually KNOW nor broadcast it unless it were to the candidate's advantage, which I think it may certainly be in this case....the more perceived influence he has, the more he will gain.  Great strategy.

       dict democracy :    de·moc·ra·cy     ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (d-mkr-s) n. pl. de·moc·ra·cies     1. Government by the people, exercised either directly or through elected representatives.    2. A political or social unit that has such a government.    3. The common people, considered as the primary source of political power.   dict republic   re·pub·lic     ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (r-pblk) n.     1.          1. A political order whose head of state is not a monarch and in modern times is usually a president.          2. A nation that has such a political order.    2.          1. A political order in which the supreme power lies in a body of citizens who are entitled to vote for officers and representatives responsible to them.          2. A nation that has such a political order."   Now.  Of the two, which sounds more like our esteemed nation?  Let's consider....do the common people REALLY hold the majority of the political power?  Well, if you consider the primary political power to be chossing who runs the government, then the answer would be "Of course!"  However, if you consider primary political power to be the actual decisioning process -- that is, the power to cast a yay or nay vote when the time came -- which means having been elected into office by constituents.....Constituents which, once elected, you don't NECESSARILY  HAVE to listen to once you've been eleceted.....granted it's career suicide if you're looking for a long-term political career.  However, the term republic first and foremost defines the term as a political order under a primary head -- a president.  We most certainly have a president.     On the other hand, the government was originally set up under a system of complete checks and balances.  This was given the assumption that ultimate political power was held under the people and fell to the state governments to disseminate.  But we see this, in hindsight, as a near impossibility, at least according to my illustrious boyfriend ('ello big man).  Not that I dispute this assertion....the idea of fifty (plus) loosely bound higher authorities each able to override the authority that "binds" them....some of them overseas......yeah.   Comes across as a bit ambitious, even for Washington or Franklin.  But only in this way -- by keeping political on a much smaller scale -- could the ultimate political authority REALLY stay with the people.  So, we see, once the ultimate political authority was transferred to federal government, it was then that a republic was born.....sometime after the civil war, I would think.  Since then, however, the system of checks and balances has failed with the Supreme Court wielding much too much power (at what point in the Constitution does it give the Supreme Court the power to create law?)....Nixon, Carter......while perhaps decent men (though the former's still questionable as I'll only ever know him as what history portrays) they were pathetic presidents.    With the voting populace so low, it appears that the public at large is apathetic.  A democracy, even if only perceived, is only workable and effective if the people it was instituted for cares enough to take an active role.  If not, they forfeit the democracy and it reverts to a republic run by the elected government.  Any way I look at it, though a rambling telling, I keep coming back to The United States of America is a republic, not a democracy.  Sorry Honey.

      the mission:   write a short and sweet answer to "why should maker's mark send YOU to the indy 500?"  my bf's answer:   Why should you send me to Indy?  I've been an unabashed devotee of all things automobile since I was eight, picking up my first Car and Driver magazine.  From that very day to this, my passions run to cars first, all other things second.  I autocross, I mod, I tinker, I love, I laugh, I motor.  I love those damnable pieces of metal that have a life of their own.  How many guys had their girlfriends remark, in exasperation, "I wish he looked at me the way he looked at wheels!"?  The only thing that's torn me away from cars in my life was my visit to Loretto when we went into the curing barn.  Smelling that sweet, hot, intoxicating air was like driving my first sports car and losing my virginity all over again.  You have a great product that I enjoy mightily, so send me and my MINI to INDY!  ===== - MINIs rule, SUVs drool - "Often wrong, but never in doubt" -- Bob Lutz   cars are his first passion?!  send him and the MINI!! to indy????  hey!  where am i in all this?     what about  ME ?!?!  after all, it IS all about me.......

Crusty mouse, crusty mouse,     It's not your fault.      They won't clean your tracking ball,     And you sure ain't no optical.     You don't move smooth like they want you to,     Cause your insides are filled with goo.      Crusty mouse, crusty mouse,     Where are they rolling you?     Crusty mouse, crusty mouse,     It's not your fault.

       I was walking outside with my then four year old daughter.  She picked up something off the ground and started to put it in her mouth.  I asked her not to do that.    "Why?" she queried inexplicably.     "Because it's been laying outside and is dirty and probably has germs."    At this point, she looked at me with total admiration and asked, "Wow!!  How do you know all of this stuff?"    "Uh..." I was thinking quickly.  Everyone knows this stuff.  "Um, it's on the Mommy Test.  You have to know it or they don't let you be a Mommy."    "Oh."    We walked along in silence for two or three minutes more, but she was evidently pondering this new information.    "I get it!!!"  she beamed.  "If you flunk, you have to be a Daddy!"

      Each week, millions of Americans tune in to The Apprentice reality TV show to find out who Donald Trump will fire next. We sit riveted as contestants suck-up, freak out, go over the top and think way outside the box while striving to win the one-year, $250,000 position with The Trump Organization. And we learn - from the triumphs and mistakes of the participants as well as from the mogul himself -  how to survive in the corporate jungle.   Consider these eight lessons from The Apprentice, that can be applied to almost any professional situation:   Lesson One: Have a Strategy.  When time is short and the task is large, it's tempting to rush in. But first, think through the objective of the project and what factors will make it a success to ensure you're not just doing things right, but doing the right things. In the first episode, for example, the men were quick and well organized getting their lemonade stand together, but they ignored the basic concept of "location, location, location" when they set up near a fish market.   Lesson Two: Find Out What the Boss/Client Wants and Give it to Them.  When devising their ad campaign, the men's team passed on the chance to meet with the client, so they'd have more time to work on their creative. The women's team, on the other hand, met with the client and learned they were seeking a "swing for the fences" approach. While the men went for bland and safe, the women won the account with an edgy ad that delivered what the client was looking for.   Lesson Three: Deal With the Person in Charge.  According to Trump: "Always deal with the boss...If you deal with the underling and the underling has to sell the deal to the boss, he's not going to sell for you the way he's going to sell for himself when he wants a salary increase."   Lesson Four: Be Positive.  People like being around those who give off good energy. Sam got fired in the third episode in large part because no one could stand to be around his prickly personality. (Although nodding off at the conference table as his colleagues toiled on the ad campaign didn't help.)   Lesson Five: Have the Courage to Speak Your Mind.  Don't mistake being positive for going with the flow. For example, during the negotiating challenge, Kwame, a former investment manager, knew the price of gold is inflexible, but wasted time haggling over it anyway. Expertise is worth nothing if you don't assert it.   Lesson Six: Stand Up For Yourself.  As "The Donald" says, "If you don't stand up for yourself, no one else will." In the fourth episode, he fired one of his favorite candidates, Kristi, because she didn't defend herself when her team told Trump she'd been a poor project leader. Trump told his aides afterwards, "If you don't fight for yourself, the accusations must be true." 	  Lesson Seven: Be Flexible.  With today's diverse workforce and fast-changing environment, you need a repertoire of skills and behaviors to draw from. Dave, an MD with an MBA, was the most highly educated of the group, but was the first to go. For all his intelligence, he couldn't relate to a broad range of people or adapt his style when things weren't working.   Lesson Eight: There's Life After Being Fired.  Everybody gets rejected. Most people fired from The Apprentice appear confident and ready to build on the experience. "You'll find with most successful people, when you say to them, ‘It won't work out' or ‘You're not worthy,' it only drives them more," says Billy Procida, who was fired by Trump for real in 1990.  Four years later, Procida was named New York City Developer of the Year. And today he heads the Palisades Financial Investment Firm in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. At present, he and Trump are considering building a world class hotel together.  Copyright 2004 CareerBuilder.com. All rights reserved.

      There is nothing like spending time with the one you love.  Got to spend some time in Gtown with Big Man.....who got his Apple  urlLink Powerbook  today....      It was exceedingly exciting.  I nearly cried, as ridiculous as that sounds....it is just so incredible to see someone you love so much be so incredibly happy.   New toys.    Also got to see  urlLink  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon   for the first time.   Harold LOVES that movie.  It was okay....... for me.....eh.   It was pretty good.   There were alot of political, historical, and cultural nuances that muddle my enjoyment of the movie bc i just DIDNT get all of it.....  In retrospect, it was pretty cool with the whole flying ninja thing, altho that too was ......odd.  My favorite part?  Chun Yow-Fat and the guy who played Lo. ...yummy.   Chow Yun-Fat is such a man's man.  Honor.  Courage.   Restrained physical strength.  Inner strength.  dude.....whole package.  Can I just say, it is  SOOOOOO  hard to see him so little.  And to leave after so short a visit tears at me.  Its almost as if a little bit more of my spirit leaks through our kisses and remains with him every time we part.   It's almost as if the only way I can be totally myself is with him now, because he holds part of me.  I love Gtown.......It is so beautiful.  It is so lovely to be there.   The pace of life there seems to have quickened since I spent a few college years there, but not nearly as bad as here.  I regret I dont see the beauty here that he can get by opening a window.  We went and saw urlLink  Mel Brooks' The Producers  at the Whitney in the KFC last Saturday.  Matinee.  GREAT SHOW.  humor about on the level of The Taming of the Shrew, though, so beware if your sensitivity exceeds your tolerance for the loud and bawdy.  It was absolutely freakin hilarious.  WONDERFUL show, although I do have a bit of a bawdy or uncouth sense of humor....not enough to laugh at a fart joke (thank heavens) but certainly enough to collapse in a fit of hysterics at the sight of a manly gay man in a stunning oscar-worthy gown and tiara.  "Ulla dance some more?"  Joey turned three this past Tuesday, the fifth of April.  Such a big boy.   My baby, such a little boy.  We had his birthday party at mom and dad's house Sunday, the 3rd, also Palm Sunday.  Dorian and Noah came, as did Valerie and Brian and their kids Wyatt and Dylan, in addition to Papa and Aunt Vicki.   I made a teddy bear cake (with a UK hat woohoo!) and we had an easter-egg hunt and food.......claro!  We had fun, though I was worried Joey would be too overwrought due to prior anticipation and the subsequent lack of sleep.....from mommy, he received a Hungry, Hungry Hippos game, A Hi-Ho Cheerio game, a T-ball set from little tykes, a bob the builder baseball cap, the Jonah veggietales movie, a Jay-Jay movie on forgiveness and understanding (wheres the one on patience and being less demanding?), and his favorite gift:  a simple  urlLink hotwheels racetrack .   we play with that thing FOR HOURS.  if you have a boy under 8, get one.  From mom and dad:  clothes......at my request.   from Rachel:  urlLink  a clifford book and a clifford plush dog.   He sleeps with it every night.  Loves that thing.  From Papa and (mainly) Aunt Vicki:  Clothes.  WOOHOO  .   we can ALWAYS use more clothes!!!  esp with the way this kid loves outdoor sports.....    From Noah (and Dorian):  a real live golf set......with METAL clubs!!!  he LOVES IT.  and from Wyatt (and family):  two wonderful books on Jesus and a child's Christianity.  we had alot of fun :)  welp, enough for tonight.   beddybye is calling "come to me mommy.....come to bed......"

He orders a sandwich, eats it, then draws a gun and fires two shots into the air.  "Why?" asks the confused waiter as the panda heads for the exit. The animal produces a badly punctuated wildlife manual and tosses it over his shoulder.  "I'm a panda," he says at the door. "Look it up."  The waiter turns to the relevant entry and all is revealed.  "Panda. Large black-and-white bear-like mammal, native to China. Eats, shoots and leaves."

For you who are counting, that's $0.31 per oz. It should DEFINITELY have a surgeon general's warning label.    "Normal Use:  One can per six hours.  Do not drink if you are pregnant.  Do not drink if you wish to maintain an affable relationship with your coworkers."    I've had three in the past 45 minutes.  I'm so freakin' high.

        Ladies and Gentlemen....the REAL action at autocross.  Apparently it's not exciting enough to keep these enthusisasts awake....  We went to the Ft. Knox autocross yesterday.......we being Joe and I.  Met up with Big Man while we were there.  Rain and severe weather threatened the competition the whole time there.......so I, being the concerned, loving, thoughtful woman I am, I picked up all his stuff that was thrown haphazardly under a tarp and threw it in my car.  Uncharacteristically, I thought a second and pressed my "L" button on my door panel and shut the door........and saw the keys hanging from the ignition.  But, of course, I always carry a spare set and it was....in my purse.  In the car.  I locked myself and apparently everyone but some innocent wrecker driver out of it, resulting in one LONG, trying, crispy, dehydrated day for everyone involved.  Did test the limits of Harold's love as he had to drive half a mile down a gravel road and mud on his RACE tires and nearly got ARRESTED by one very pissed off MP who kept him otherwise occupied in the MP guard gate at teh Chaffee gate for like an hour and a half until the wrecker showed up to help us all out.  Meanwhile, after beeing deepfried by the sun, Joe and I spent the time with Sasha and Scott (a racing buddy of Harold's in H Stock) -- who are, btw, GREAT people.  Joe shoved two ham sandwiches (courstesy of Sasha) in his face with surprising dexterity.  Understand:  he did not EAT them.  They were quite literally shoved in his face and downed whole.  He also worked on an apple and drank the last half of Sasha's Diet Rite (ew).      My head's stuck....umm...Mommy....    MUHAHAHAHA!!  Now I've got you!  Wait...my hands....won't....move....    Helmet head.   oh yeah.  The race was great.  Joey LOVED it (even prayed about tonight...."Jesus, please help the cars go fast and help the racers' tires.") and wants to return, needless to say.  Harold got second place (only to Scottie) and had dirty runs the whole heat.  Ran 5.  SCCA didnt get to finish the day out, courtesy of the impending tornados and hail and flash flooding and flying pigs.....

      Well.  (Thank you, Harold, for introducing me to the other uses of this commonly used interjection.  Question?  Exclamation!  Also, surprisingly, this word apparently contains the ability to be used as an answer to complicated questions and scenarios, in addition to being synomous with with "I told you so," "there you have it," and "WHATEVER!")    I reiterate.  Well.  After having survived several weeks of depressing rain, Kentuckiana was pummelled two nights ago with storm after storm of sideways rain, 65 mph winds, golfball sized hail, flash flodding (did anyone other than me see Valhalla?!), tornado after tornado, and commercials touting the opening ame in Calgary (good luck boys!  Go get em!).  Eminence, KY was hit pretty hard.   urlLink Borden  was wiped clean.  Farm after farm of barns missing entirely, school projects destroyed by the bricks flying through missing roofs, hundreds of thousands of dead chickens strewn across acres of land, so thick all one sees is a sea of white.  Meanwhile, on Grantline the Chicken House (which designates the turn onto St. Joe's Rd and Brother Paris's house) disappeared.  Well, nobody is crying about that one.    Tampa's hurting, btw.  They are up 2985 feet above sea level more than they are used to and it is definitely apparent in their game.  Not that they're losing.  halfway through the second period, actually, and no one's scored.  But then again, NO ONE'S scored!  The Docs in the know have said that it takes over a week for one's body to acclimate to that severe fo a change......they've had.....six hours maybe?  OH!!!!!!!  CALGARY JUST SCORED!!!!!!!!   I REALLY thought Tampa had that shot!  Power Play.   Inevitable......

      Alright.  It's time to get your GAYDAR out tonight and lemme know what your think.    Is he, or isn't he?     The question is: IS TY PENNINGTON STRAIGHT OR GAY?  yes I know.  my life is so exciting, the quandries that consume me.  In actuality, I hadn't even considered the notion until Big Man spoke it into existence.  While Ty is exceedingly hot (who doesn't like a perfect, rugged body with humor and handyman skills to boot?), he has an impeccable sense of style and flair that straight men just don't ever possess.  So, is he?

           You know you're a mommy when:    A coworker says they brought you a present and you're excited to find it's a sheet of pull-up coupons.   Your kids are fighting and you threaten to lock them in a room together and not let them out until someone's bleeding.  Your idea of a good day is making it through without a child leaking bodily fluids on you.  Popsicles become a food staple.  You're willing to kiss your child's boo-boo, regardless of where it is.  Spit is your number one cleaning agent.  You're so desperate for adult conversation that you spill your guts to the telemarketer that calls...and HE hangs up on YOU!  You count the sprinkles on each kid's cupcake to make sure they're equal.  You have time to shave only one leg at a time.  You hide in the bathroom to be alone.....until your child starts potty training, that is.  Your kid throws up and you catch it.  You've mastered the art of placing large quantities of pancakes and eggs on a plate without anything touching.  Your child insists that you read "Once Upon a Potty" out loud in the church lobby and you do it.  You cling to the high moral ground on toy weapons; your child chews his toast into the shape of a gun but still isn't allowed to point it at anyone.  You hope ketchup is a vegetable, since it's the only one your child eats.  You can't bear the thought of your son's first girlfriend.  You hate the thought of his wife even more.  You can't bear to give away baby clothes - it's so final.  You hear your mother's voice coming out of your mouth when you say, "Look at me!"  You stop criticizing the way your mother raised you.  You take a vacation away from the kids then spend half the time away calling to check on them.  You can't wait until the kids are out of the house and in the next second cry because someday the kids will be out of the house.    and last, but certainly not to be forgotten.... You're up each night until 11:00 P.M. vacuuming, dusting, wiping, washing, drying, loading, unloading, shopping, cooking, driving, flushing, ironing, sweeping, picking up, changing sheets, changing diapers, bathing, helping with homework, paying bills, budgeting, clipping coupons, folding clothes, putting to bed, dragging out of bed, brushing, chasing, buckling, feeding (them, not you), PLUS swinging, playing baseball, bike riding, pushing trucks, cuddling dolls, roller blading, basketball, football, catch, bubbles, sprinklers, slides, nature walks, coloring, crafts, jumping rope, PLUS raking, trimming, planting, edging, mowing, gardening, painting, and walking the dog. You get up at 5:30 AM and you have no time to eat, sleep, drink, or go to the bathroom, and yet...you still managed to gain 10 pounds.

      May I just say, in any workplace conversation, especially those involving a superior, there should be a point recognized by corporate culture, once it becomes obvious one's answers are only frustrating and aggravating the other participant as opposed to answering their questions, where one is allowed to throw one's hands in the air and exclaim,"What is it that you WANT?!  Speak PLAINLY WOMAN!"

       I will forever associate Maker's Mark with racing fun cars and the love of my life.  I was introduced to the Maker's Mark culture in July The Bluegrass Mini Club scheduled a tour of the facitily and I was invited along by my best friend, Harold Combs.  It was during this enjoyable trip that we realized deeper feelings for one another and both made an important commitment -- as Maker's Mark ambassadors.  Maker's Mark is the drink of choice in each of our households, specifically on the rocks, and is a great way to top off a day of racing.       As the owner of a 2003 Mini Cooper, Harold and I spend most weekends during the racing season at the Lexington/Louisville regional autocross.  Harold continually modifies his Mini to lessen the tenths of a second that may win him yet another trophy.  I have invariably received the unofficial titles of logistics coordinator, cheerleader, and - my favorite - pit crew.  I love being allowed the pleasure of helping to change the tires, brakes, adjusting pressures and other specifications, and maintaining daily logistics.  Also, while I love being in the driver's seat with a low-geared manual transmission, I passsionately enjoy watching my very own Dale Earnhardt, Jr. corner 40 degree circular turns at 70 miles per hour in second gear.  I love speed, oil, gasoline, and control on the brink of letting go.  Sharing something we both love with the person I cherish most in this world is fun, exciting, and amazing.  It's even better when we are able to go home, sit on the couch, and finish the day with a tumbler of Maker's Mark.       Please, send us both to Indy!!!!  We BOTH love auto racing and Maker's Mark!  The Maker's Mark tour will always be memorable, not just for the experience itself, but because of the signifigance it holds in our personal lives.  Give us another memorable and enjoyable day in the tradition of our history with Maker's Mark and auto racing!  SEND US TO INDY!!!!    Alright so a little over the top.....Harold liked it.  ALOT of a lil stretched thing....... It was fun though.....

        Laws Concerning Food and Drink; Household Principles; Lamentations of the Father by Ian Frazier    OF the beasts of the field, and of the fishes of the sea, and of all foods that are acceptable in my sight you may eat, but not in the living room. Of the hoofed animals, broiled or ground into burgers, you may eat, but not in the living room. Of the cloven-hoofed animal, plain or with cheese, you may eat, but not in the living room. Of the cereal grains, of the corn and of the wheat and of the oats, and of all the cereals that are of bright color and unknown provenance you may eat, but not in the living room. Of the quiescently frozen dessert and of all frozen after- meal treats you may eat, but absolutely not in the living room. Of the juices and other beverages, yes, even of those in sippy-cups, you may drink, but not in the living room, neither may you carry such therein. Indeed, when you reach the place where the living room carpet begins, of any food or beverage there you may not eat, neither may you drink.  But if you are sick, and are lying down and watching something, then may you eat in the living room.            Laws When at Table     And if you are seated in your high chair, or in a chair such as a greater person might use, keep your legs and feet below you as they were. Neither raise up your knees, nor place your feet upon the table, for that is an abomination to me. Yes, even when you have an interesting bandage to show, your feet upon the table are an abomination, and worthy of rebuke. Drink your milk as it is given you, neither use on it any utensils, nor fork, nor knife, nor spoon, for that is not what they are for; if you will dip your blocks in the milk, and lick it off, you will be sent away. When you have drunk, let the empty cup then remain upon the table, and do not bite it upon its edge and by your teeth hold it to your face in order to make noises in it sounding like a duck; for you will be sent away.  When you chew your food, keep your mouth closed until you have swallowed, and do not open it to show your brother or your sister what is within; I say to you, do not so, even if your brother or your sister has done the same to you. Eat your food only; do not eat that which is not food; neither seize the table between your jaws, nor use the raiment of the table to wipe your lips. I say again to you, do not touch it, but leave it as it is. And though your stick of carrot does indeed resemble a marker, draw not with it upon the table, even in pretend, for we do not do that, that is why. And though the pieces of broccoli are very like small trees, do not stand them upright to make a forest, because we do not do that, that is why. Sit just as I have told you, and do not lean to one side or the other, nor slide down until you are nearly slid away. Heed me; for if you sit like that, your hair will go into the syrup. And now behold, even as I have said, it has come to pass.            Laws Pertaining to Dessert     For we judge between the plate that is unclean and the plate that is clean, saying first, if the plate is clean, then you shall have dessert. But of the unclean plate, the laws are these: If you have eaten most of your meat, and two bites of your peas with each bite consisting of not less than three peas each, or in total six peas, eaten where I can see, and you have also eaten enough of your potatoes to fill two forks, both forkfuls eaten where I can see, then you shall have dessert. But if you eat a lesser number of peas, and yet you eat the potatoes, still you shall not have dessert; and if you eat the peas, yet leave the potatoes uneaten, you shall not have dessert, no, not even a small portion thereof. And if you try to deceive by moving the potatoes or peas around with a fork, that it may appear you have eaten what you have not, you will fall into iniquity. And I will know, and you shall have no dessert.     On Screaming     Do not scream; for it is as if you scream all the time. If you are given a plate on which two foods you do not wish to touch each other are touching each other, your voice rises up even to the ceiling, while you point to the offense with the finger of your right hand; but I say to you, scream not, only remonstrate gently with the server, that the server may correct the fault. Likewise if you receive a portion of fish from which every piece of herbal seasoning has not been scraped off, and the herbal seasoning is loathsome to you, and steeped in vileness, again I say, refrain from screaming. Though the vileness overwhelm you, and cause you a faint unto death, make not that sound from within your throat, neither cover your face, nor press your fingers to your nose. For even now I have made the fish as it should be; behold, I eat of it myself, yet do not die.     Concerning Face and Hands     Cast your countenance upward to the light, and lift your eyes to the hills, that I may more easily wash you off. For the stains are upon you; even to the very back of your head, there is rice thereon. And in the breast pocket of your garment, and upon the tie of your shoe, rice and other fragments are distributed in a manner wonderful to see. Only hold yourself still; hold still, I say. Give each finger in its turn for my examination thereof, and also each thumb. Lo, how iniquitous they appear. What I do is as it must be; and you shall not go hence until I have done.     Various Other Laws, Statutes, and Ordinances     Bite not, lest you be cast into quiet time. Neither drink of your own bath water, nor of bath water of any kind; nor rub your feet on bread, even if it be in the package; nor rub yourself against cars, nor against any building; nor eat sand.  Leave the cat alone, for what has the cat done, that you should so afflict it with tape? And hum not that humming in your nose as I read, nor stand between the light and the book. Indeed, you will drive me to madness. Nor forget what I said about the tape.            Complaints and Lamentations     O my children, you are disobedient. For when I tell you what you must do, you argue and dispute hotly even to the littlest detail; and when I do not accede, you cry out, and hit and kick. Yes, and even sometimes do you spit, and shout "stupid-head" and other blasphemies, and hit and kick the wall and the molding thereof when you are sent to the corner. And though the law teaches that no one shall be sent to the corner for more minutes than he has years of age, yet I would leave you there all day, so mighty am I in anger. But upon being sent to the corner you ask straightaway, "Can I come out?" and I reply, "No, you may not come out." And again you ask, and again I give the same reply. But when you ask again a third time, then you may come out.  Hear me, O my children, for the bills they kill me. I pay and pay again, even to the twelfth time in a year, and yet again they mount higher than before. For our health, that we may be covered, I give six hundred and twenty talents twelve times in a year; but even this covers not the fifteen hundred deductible for each member of the family within a calendar year. And yet for ordinary visits we still are not covered, nor for many medicines, nor for the teeth within our mouths. Guess not at what rage is in my mind, for surely you cannot know.  For I will come to you at the first of the month and at the fifteenth of the month with the bills and a great whining and moan. And when the month of taxes comes, I will decry the wrong and unfairness of it, and mourn with wine and ashtrays, and rend my receipts. And you shall remember that I am that I am: before, after, and until you are twenty-one. Hear me then, and avoid me in my wrath, O children of me.

      As I sit here eating...cheese and crackers...I consider that I've gained ten pounds in the past year.  I've changed my eating habits on the whole, enjoying fruits and veggies more often and in a larger quantity than I used to, although I did fall off the wagon yesterday.  I went a week without drinking coke (thanks to a UTI) and felt worlds better in spite of massive lack of sleep.  Although, sadly....that too is no longer true due to the twelve pack in the fridge.  In my defense, I must add that has been sitting in the fridge since Tuesday, so I'm doing good, right?  I still have problems eating too much, although I at least  understand  appropriate proportions now.  I find however that I eat emotionally.  I eat not only when I'm hungry, but also when I'm sad.  BUT ALSO when I miss Harold.  which is often.  And....the more I miss him or find myself needing him...the more junk food makes an appearance (God bless oreos and ice cream).  So I suppose THIS is all to say I want to lose it.  More than ever.  two pounds a week doesn't sound impossible so I've set that as my goal til I hit 115.  Then we'll see.  I feel best at 105 but 20 pounds sounds so daunting.  Especially at 2 pounds a week, with as easily bored and frustrated as I get.  I'm hoping that by putting this in writing in a public forum (ok....how many ppl are REALLY gonna see this?), I'll stay committed to not just losing weight, but to learning a healthier lifestyle and being able to imprint that into Joey before it's too late.  ______________________________  We went to the zoo again today.  Spent about 4 hours there, during which Joey apparently wore himself completely out because he went to bed at 5 p, and has yet to awaken (he won't).  Didnt't eat anything today, though, except for  2 bites of a hotdog.    ______________________________  I need a new car.  Who doesn't, right?  >>sigh   yeah.  Thought not.  LOL.   Someday I'll have my MBA and then I'll have the appropriate education to demand a workable and fulfilling salary.  Harold's right.  I've basically plateaud at the credit union, which is sad considering I'm STILL getting less than I left Dairy Queen at five years ago.

Visit    SelectSmart.com/RELIGION          so apparently even tho it says roman catholic, thers a programming bug.....it came up as conservative christian but.....the graphic says roman catholic.  harold said he changed his.....when i went through the next survey it said i was most likely a southern baptist......PLEASE.  thats about as close as the roman catholic.  eh.  programming.

      Sitting here wanting desperately to have the desire and ability to blog furiously and record the millions of miracles and events that have transpired in the past [month] since my last post.  I get too caught up in life to have the time to record it for posthumous revelation for my family who will undoubtedly find THE DRAWER and other unsightly things upon my passing, quite hopefully 60 years in the future.  Sixty-two honey.   Just waiting for sixty-two.   You're still responsibly for THE DRAWER at that point.  And keeping my secrets.       Gatlinburg.    Dad, Joey and I went to Pigeon Forge and stayed in a decent hotel.  The first night we stayed on a floor with a middle school baseball team and their parents, who behaved in the same manner.  They were up runing the halls, banging doors, screaming and yelling.  This went on for several hours until I could take no more at 12:30 am when they awoke my three year old, who had slept through a tornado the week before.  I was told by a female parent who was orchestrating a pizza order that they paid for their rooms same as i did and to get over it.  They continued carrying on until 2 am.  I got over it.  I marched down to the front desk the next morning and spewed politely to the manager who informed me there absolutely no excuse whatsoever for that type of behavior and they wouldve preferred id called security to nip it in the bud when a problem was evident.  yeah well ill know next time.  They moved us to a wonderful, newer, larger room at the end of a hall right beside an emergency exit.  It was great.  So.  We went to Cade's Cove where we took a two hour drive around the 10 mile loop.  We went in the evening round dinner time and thus saw an abundance of animals.  We saw a team of horses, one of which tried to stick its head in the van and give us a kiss.  There were only more and more "Bambi"s........small and large.........and some with small antlers  .  We saw a baby black bear on the way into the cove, and three upon our exit.    Cade's Cove was without a doubt my favorite part of the trip.  I love the mountains and the land........it was uncomparable.  The Sunsets are........amazing against the endless sea of rolling forest.  The shops were....close together and densely populated.  The strip was.....a strip.  The knife shop was pretty cool.  Bought Harold a knife and Daddy an expensive collector's edition "kentucky" case knife that he LOVED.  (woohoo)  Got joe a TShirt, mini cooper toy, among other things.  Also got Harold a starbucks doubleshot espresso shot glass, and a mini cooper too.  Got myself a very cool vase that was handmade blown glass from the czech republic and a door plaque that says "As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord..."  been looking for on eo f those for awhile.  Was handmade just for me by a woman in the wood working shop at Dollywood.....a woman who looked JUST like lindsey lee.....and spoke, walked, etc. just like her.  uncanny.  We went to Dollywood.  Rode the Floom Zoom with Joey at his insistence.  He LOVED it.  I lost my mini hat, altho thankfully in the track so that it followed the current into the floom dock.  so i didnt lose it.  i was SO thankful.  Joey loved it.  he LOVED it.  rofl!!  my three year old, the roller coaster enthusiast.  he was so disappointed there wasnt a roller coaster he was allowed to ride.  Although they DID have a new wooden coaster called the Thunderhead that seemed to be the sister coaster to our own ThunderRun.  oh yeah.  Joey also rode the race cars, the semi trucks, the airplanes.......  more later

      Yeah. Ok Ok I kno.....yuk it up. The latest "rent" from Netflix wasn't worth the postage THEY paid. It was anachronistic, with a souped up score from the first version......Mya was in it. As a performer. The dancing was completely apalling.....painful t0 watch. The two main characters were totally mismatched: The chick was too old to be believable as a high school senior. Not to mention she had a mommy body. you kno, the softer curves, spongier almost. yeah. like me. (yay) The boy, who was sposed to be older and more worldly, btw....seemed way too young for her. and the story never offered any reason why fit together. The initial premise for the main char's fam to be in cuba ANYWAY was that her father had to move there for his job. thats all taht was ever explained. That didnt fit either. Her father worked for Ford. Then there was this whole wanna-be subplot about Batista being overthrown by Castro that just convoluted the whole awful dancing theme.  Totally screwed movie.

      Well I'm sitting home alone for the first time in a coupla nights....strep ridden and feverish.  freezing.  Harold came down Friday night (yay!!) after I'd spent the day at home with Joey due to his illness.  We got bubble gum medicine from the pharmacy (amoxil) and had a time with it.....seemed to work wonders though...   We took him to see and RIDE Thomas the Tank Engine at the  urlLink Kentucky Railway Museum  on Saturday....a  urlLink Day Out With Thomas .  Seems everyone in the area with children of age (10 and under) visited Thomas at some point or another.  We spent no money.   Thats right.  i said no money.   as in zero dollars....minus the $50.00 for the train ride tickets I purchased six months ago lest they sell out.....had one girl at work who spent $174.00 on videos and shirts and who knows what else.....Harold was all about eating at this ribs place in New Haven, but we packed lunch so why?   We DID end up chowing down afterwards at Arby's.....  We rode the Train the first thing.....after a several-hour ordeal at home that involved contacts and a lost set of keys....we made the train ride with MAYBE five minutes to spare....then we went and ate out under a tree in the parking lot where joe was convinced he was gonna get run over by oncoming traffic or the cheesy mini-trains that were running around the parking lot.  After that we went to the museum, which he loved and my allergies did not...Harold carried him around the museum (think small) on his shoulders and joe LOVED it.....   Then we went to jump on the bouncy thing which, after standing in line for five minutes, joey started crying and wouldnt get in bc the kid in front of him was 150 pounds heavier and only a foot taller.....joey's face was in his big, fat, butt.  I'd be scared spitless too.  so we journeyed over to the temporary tattoo booth with joey crying for thomas, then james then percy......  which he ended with percy and still has....  then we  went and played on the wooden train sets for awhile..... and the few times we tried to go see sir topham hat (who i was REALLY interested in seeing) joey started crying and totally freaking out......it was still a good day nonethheless.  the next day saw us at Papa John's for Louisville Autocross.....harold won second again, only to scott of course.....big cup.  We had a lot of fun....the day was cool and overcast with on and off sprinkles.  HS ran the second heat so Big Man had to work 4th....but his heat missed the rain and they were like the only one that did.  Joey was **extremely** well behaved.  He sat when I told him to and for long periods of time....and played where I designated.  he brought all four of his hot wheels minis....he loves minis.  LOL  We came home earlier than Harold and while joe napped, i made dinner....mainly lasagna.  harold liked it.   I've never been a huge fan, though I'll eat it any day of the week.  apparently he'll eat it twice on sundays  .   I think he was simply famished beyond words.  We had a STRONG australian shiraz with a black pepper finish.....a bit much for the meal.   it was recommended for a steak dinner so....yeah.  shouldve stuck with that.  Then we all cuddled up on the couch and spent some family time before joe went to bed....as different as that is given we're dating  LOL.  harold always has been my family though.   weird how sometimes blood just doesnt matter.    Man i sleep so well when he's here.  like nothing else.  to be held all night by someone who wants to hold you all night.....extremely comforting.  providing they dont pin you down in their sleep in the middle of the night so you cant move....until they drift back to sleep enough that their body relaxes.  yeah.  course i pretty much remained asleep myself.... that was different.  but given my history, freaked me out a lil when i fully awoke the next morning and contemplated it.  im convinced harold's gonna kill me in his sleep one night in the middle of a dream.   fun times.   truly.   no more anecdotes.  and she wants the kitchen a lil wider.... haha.   love you.

He's getting a motorcycle, kiddie cd player, spiderman sleepwear and robe, more hot wheels, prolly a few odds and ends, and some hockey stuff.  yeah he's done in my book.  So now I have time to focus on everybody else.  yay.   altho i did see the bible on cd i might go back and get myself at some point too.    so yeah, call me crazy but ive already started.

       urlLink Courtesy of H's hyperlinks........   Lesson # 1: Women you're involved with don't take too kindly to ex-wives or girlfriends. I know, I know, you're hopin' I didn't take this long to figure this one out, right? But sometimes, you forget. And sometimes, you're just mindin' your own bidness, and some "ex" appears out of what seems like nowhere and proceeds to think she can greet you with a big hug and a kiss like there's no one standin' next to you (like your current wife or girlfriend who happens to be displaying the universal pissed-off body language that women do so well - the folded arms and the clenched smile). And then, to make matters worse, the "ex" proceeds to extend her hand to your current lady and lamely tries to chat her up, while makin' it clear that she's only interested in talkin' to you. And then, on top of that, she stays a little too long and asks about people and stuff you don't really want to talk about because all it does is reinforce in your current lady's mind that there's someone else walkin' around out there who knows way too much about you.  I mean, "exes" exist in all relationships - but women don't want to admit it and they just don't want to hear about it. And they especially don't want to run into it. I don't either, especially when a.) The "ex" never looked better, and b.) She touches you and looks at you with an air of familiarity that makes you cringe - because you can feel your current lady fixing a glare at you that would melt steel, and c.) Because you'll pay a price for this encounter for days, if not weeks to come. You know what I mean, the little comments at breakfast about her, or even worse, the urge to "talk" in the middle of the night when she can't sleep, and she wants to know right then and there if you still want her - or do you want to go back to "that bitch" because if you do then you can start packin' right this minute. It's just one of those no-win situations that no man can extricate himself from.

      I was all happy bc Harold inroduced me to diet Pepsi, which I can stand enough to drink it instead of Coke.  Diet Pepsi really does taste more like regular Pepsi.    Good feeling gone.    I questioned Harold about the bright red warning on the back of the can under the nutritional info that reads:  Warning:  Contains Phenylalanine.    He didn't answer me.  So I googled  urlLink (here)  .  Apparently it causes cancer and is a neurotoxin.  But hey.

      Why do I miss him so much?  Why do I feel like I'm missing an appendage?  Why do I feel like half of me is not here?!  If I could just have him hold me......just a hug.....  "Why should I sleep?" my heart cries As the winds of life are beating, beating Against the towers of dreams he builds. My lover has gone, apart from me always, "Apart from me never!" I hear Though his mind has been the thing, the most beautiful thing I love. He catches me with his soft words and caresses me with his intellect. I long for his arms and his wisdom I long for his hands and his wit I long for his strength and his shrewdness I long for his mouth and his reason Dear heart, soothe thyself with this: Sleep knowing my lover sleeps soundly If ever too far away.     Cloths of Heaven     Had I the heavens' embrouidered cloths, Enwrought with golden and silver light, The blue and the dim and the dark cloths Of night and light and the half-light, I would spread the cloths under your feet: But I, being poor, have only my dreams; I have spread my dreams under your feet; Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.   -WB Yeats

      Well, ladies and gentlemen, the big news of the day is apparently NOT the 85 mile-per-winds we got last night that knocked out power to everyone in the entire city minus hurstborne......the news of the day is"  courtney love is now back in the hospital for an unnamed ailment.  we're talking a medical, full-fledged, doctors in white coats in the ER with ppl on respirators kinda hospital.  not rehab.   altho she certainly needs to be in rehab.   it was reported that she was wandering her hollywood neighborhood with no idea of who or where she was, asking for money and knocking on car windows wanting help.   It was mentioned that she was just in the hospital last week for an unnamed gynocological problem (coathanger?  cancer?  miscarriage?  who knows.)     She looks like hell.  She sounds schizophrenic.    Now my question is, why do i care, other than the fact that she's a fellow human being who my God cares about.  I recognize her more fully as the acid-tripping wife of Curt Cobain....the artist who did THE quintessential theme song, ie Teen Spirit, for my generatino (whatever that happens to be).  and whether he committed suicide (as ruled by the courts) or he was murdered (as some have come to believe) the demons that haunt Love are horrific and tearing her apart.  And taking full  delight in it no doubt.  She obviously doesnt care enough for her own life to fight back (the height of selfishness),  in spite of the various assault chareges she faces in different states.    I think its safe to say that no one would be much surprised at this point if she were to commit suicide herself.  she's on the right path for it.  That said, Steve Edwards from  urlLink Good Day LA  (aka Live)  publicly reprimanded mainstream media and its attentive audience for hounding "celebrities" and insisting on deliciously reveling in their problems.  as he said "It's bad enough when you go through hell and your relatives know about it.  But when the whole world is watching, it just compounds the problems."  when the world is watching and rooting for you to LOSE because its more entertaining, how could you NOT become as freakin screwed up as Love is.....she lost her husband in one way or another.....and the world blames her for silencing the voice of a generation and a genius in the alternative punk scene.  she lost her child.  she has nothing left of herself.    lay off and leave the woman alone.  and if you believe in God, pray for her salvation.  bc that is the only thing that's gonna heal her at this point, regardless of the harvard degrees her doctors might have.

      thanx baby for suggesting  urlLink this site .  so comments...  lol.  my favorite subject of course.    I'm having a good time flipping around inside Steven Rhoads' evo-bio-influenced new book, Taking Sex Differences Seriously. (And god bless Rhoads for having the guts to use the word "sex" instead of "gender.") Some nuggets:      * How often do men think about sex? And how often do women think about sex? "On average, men say three to five times a day. Women say several times a week or several times a month."      * "One survey of men and women over 45 asked how often they felt sexual desire. More than seven times as many men as women said more than once a day, and more than four times as many women as men said 'not at all'."      * "About 6 out of 7 men report masturbating more often than the average woman."      * "Women say they engage in sex to share emotions and love. Men give reasons that are more narrowly physical, such as need, sexual gratification, and release. And when deprived of sex, men are much more likely than women to become morose and irritable."      uh huh.   so i am a man.  we always knew it.  __________________________________________________________________________    But these new youngerGals ...the 22-25 year olds...  They seem breezily free of all the old complexes, don't they? I detect no political anger, and no generational spite. (Actually, they seem less to have been set free to be who they are than to have been actively goosed into ceaselessly expressing nonexistent selves. But leaving my crankiness aside ...) They seem to have grown up with no questions about what life would be like: a big shopping mall brimful of possibilities for self-pleasure. I'm not alone in being amazed by how uninhibited they are. Little that was once taboo seems to carry any charge for them at all. Anal? Oral? S&M? So what's the big deal?  Yet, as untroubled and uninhibited as they are, they're also the most square group of young women I've ever run across. When they get together, their talk seems to consist of nothing but the drivel-iest feminine drivel: boys, hairstyles, baby showers. Having been (at great expense) set free to be who they want to be, they turn out to want to be ... banal traditional girls. They've got nothing on their minds -- anal sex aside, I suppose -- that wouldn't have been commonplace to their great-grandmothers. They're half Jenna Jameson, half Doris Day....You dream about the glorious things that'll result from liberation, then inevitably feel let down when the smoke and debris clear. Gollygosh: people are going back to being people again! Where's the outrage?    Ok.  Yes, given the extreme sexual freedom that was apparently exhibited during the seventies (i wouldnt kno....im in the 22-25 young'un category), sexual inhibitions are currently nil. nada. nowhere to be found, even with a magnifying glass.  although....nah.  honestly!  what is the big deal?  so women are admitting they get pleasure out of sex.  (can i get a big duh-er from the sister in the back?)  heaven forbid they admit it audibly to anyone.  Who DOESN'T physically enjoy sex with a man who was obviously made specifically for them.  (On the other hand, what woman hasn't faked an orgasm?  If she says she hasn't, shes lying.  Unless she's a virgin.) And what one enjoys in the privacy and intimacy of a committed relationship should stay there and go NOWHERE else. Although I must, while men compare sexual escapades for the sole purpose of appearing self-important in some way, women share such conversations with one another over tea and crumpets...yes...perhaps in london, or anchorage for that matter.......more likely over a cup of freshly pressed starbucks....women share these conversations to compare and contrast experience, get pointers, and make sure they're getting the most out of their sex life.  What's wrong with that?  Now.  I take personal offense to the suggestion that because I grew up with access to a mall, I'm completely vapid and insipid, politically unengaged, have no real values, morals or convictions, and no major questions about life itself.... (which btw i abhor shopping, unless ive got tons of money and I'm buying for the ppl I love)  I do not have any generational angst, as the blogger points out.  I  generally feel the older one is, the more deserving of respect given the potential amount of life experience one might have....given the potential intelligence that lends....wisdom... And while I certainly am NOT a banal traditional girl (heaven FORBID!!!), I DO find that fulfillment is found in one's nuclear family and daily life.  I get excited with new appliances.  My greatest joy ever was in having my son. I love being a mother.  I enjoy cooking and trying different recipes (although thats really more the thrill of accomplishment than the joy of cooking itself).  I love having fun with those I love (not to mention,yes....crew, if he'd let me  ).  YES I LOVE BEING A WOMAN!!!  But that CERTINALY does NOT mean I talk about hairstyles (unless mine's ORANGE), nails, and  boys.  If i had a grandmother, no i wouldnt talk anal sex to her, but we never got past the "grandma, just because you're old doesnt mean you can treat me like a piece of sh*t" conversation anyway.    and btw, I am not liberated because I can go vote,braless in public, or talk about enjoying sex.  I am liberated because I am a child of the King, saved by a God who set me free from myself.  and i still enjoy sex.

      Joey spent the holiday weekend with his dad....unfortunately in the rain.  He didnt get to do much of anything....  I, on the other hand, spent it as expected with Harold's family.  Oh MAN!  I had a blast.  I was gonna drive up to his place friday night, but I was Soooooo sick....strep.  oh yeah.  Slept it off and harold showed up the next morning around 11 am.....id gotten some laundry done so that was good.  We got to Starbucks and tried a nonfat grande mochaccino light.....then went and saw  urlLink SpiderMan 2 .....oooooooooohhhhh yeah.  Much better than the first.  When's the next one come out?      hobgoblin.  fun times.  Dr. Octavious was VERY well done.  After that, we drove back  to his place and watched  urlLink Best in Show  and  urlLink Timeline .  (yes, we did a movie marathon)  BIS was worthy once you got past the first hour....once they hit the show itself  .  God bless the queens and the queers.  Timeline was....utterly predictable and the character development was completely flat, save MAYBE one or two characters....Marek (the ripped scottish archeologist who just happens to be very much in middle age weaponry) and his woman, Lady Claire.  oh yeah. didnt see that coming.      it was romantic tho.   again, the first part of the movie you had to just get through.  once it becane a period piece (well sort-of), it grew increasingly enjoyable.  minus all the dead ppl that you dont care about anyway bc no one bothered to give them lines much less a personality.   and paul walker.....ahhh.....mr. fast and furious himself.  same exact character.   how in the world can i provide the proper enunciation needed for appropriate emphasis?  same.  exact.  character.  shallow, flat, all "dude, wheres my car?", and worried about how soon he's gonna......ahem.  yeah.  We shared a bottle of dry merlot and mosied out to watch some fireworks being set off at the cardome (?) ......just walked over by the dumpster and there it was.   very cool.    The next morning i think we did our best to miss church and succeeded....>>sigh  After that, we rushed to The Combs' homestead where, may I just say, there was an abundance of nummylicious treats in store for us.....fooooooodddd......mmmmmmmmmm.  I love food  .  As anyone who knows me will attest to.  But i am SO trying to stick with this diet thing.  I really am.  And I'm doing pretty dag on good with it too...so there.   We saw pretty much everyone.....Arch seemed .....not himself.  course I havent known him ever, really, but for YEARS minimally....I just always remembered him as such a vibrant, gregarious man.  He was quiet and softspoken, but the words he said to me meant so much.  I've had a hard time with not feeling good enough for harold in regard to the memories his family must carry of me.  The women in his family have been so accepting of me again that it shocks me.  Arch...seemed wary of me at the wedding and cautioned me not to hurt harold again.  which i will, undoubtedly at some point, as we all hurt and disappoint those who love us eventually.  but ....I dunno.  Arch seemed very accepting of me yesterday and we had an actual conversation in which he actually COMPLIMENTED me.  go figure.  Harold's got this aunt jill....man she is a pistol.   she is EXACTLY like aunt vicki in every way.  she's youthful looking beyond what should legally be allowed, she's got this gorgeous smile and wonderful laugh that could make even ebeneezer grin.  She obviously loves life.  Of course, it would seem the entire family does.     The Rents.    We spent the night with Harold's mom and dad.    Harold and I left the Combs' homestead to go visit with Norie before fireworks.  We overspent the time, im afraid.  She seemed worn out by the time we left and more than happy to see her husband by the time we left. It was definitely time well spent tho, and I have a firm affinity for Norie.  I never saw much similarity between her and Harold's mom before, but now....they are SO sisters.  so completely.  I did see more of the bathroom than I wanted in the time we were there, tho.  darn meds  .  From Norie's (gorgeous cabin btw), we went back to the rents where we found them frolicking on the lawn on a coupla riding mowers like a hoover-round commercial.  It was hilarious.  It seems....I'm much more comfortable around the rents than before.  much.   I think I owe most of that to maturity and actually knowing who I am this time around.  That and....the whole "im a mommy too" thing.....makes female relationships easier, thats for darn sure.  His mom....She is something else.  The woman teaches, runs her own business, takes care of her extended family on a daily basis, AND runs the farm.  Can we say "Proverbs 31"?!  geez the woman is her own lesson in fortitude and grace.  and she's got these amazing legs that a 16 year old would be jealous of.  beautiful woman.  amazing woman.  and the father.....if it werent for the pepper in the hair I'd swear he were Harold's age.  He has stories out the wazoo, and the dynamic personality and sense of theatre to REALLY make them interesting.  He's got a gleam in his eye, altho neither hair on his face nor a stomach that shakes like a bowl full of jelly......so dont dont go thinking santa clause or anything.....he too seems youthful.  I dont know what it is about that area, but the good ones all seem to stay so very young for so very long, provided they can keep from being broken by the sins of their families.  sounds like the godfather.  geez, heaven help me  .  I love the farm.  I'm freakin scared to death of bugs, animals, and family stress.  especially when its outside the dysfunctional family dynamic im used to.  NEWZ....yeah its gorgeous there.  id go freakin batty in two week's time without a meijers in walking distance (or neighbors for that matter)....  So then we went and watched fireworks at some family friend's house where you could see beattyville fireworks through the trees and above the hills...It was lovely, minus the scary mutant bugs.  and then harold and I conked out about an hour before the grown ups even finished talking....(lol)  I wanted to be in  bed by 10 so badly....and i think it was like 1 am.  we got up the next morning and made it back to louisville exactly at 12, when i was sposed to be 20 miles across town picking up joe.  ron didnt say much tho.  joey was happy to be home and THRILLED to have harold there.  he LOVES harold.    We did fireworks at dad's house.  joey loved them, tho it took longer than id imagined....not a bad thing it just did.  i said when we started, watch daddy show up as soon as we finish.  he did.  like a minute after we were done.  We took enough time to clean up a bit, then Harold was on his way home and so were joe and i.  so that was my weekend.  How was yours?

      Last Night.  Last Night was. Last Night forever shall be.  Last Night was interminable and sleepless.    Last Night was nightmarish.  Last Night was a definite experience.  Last Night I learned not to drink a daquiri right before bed.  This morning, after a triple shot, non-fat, sugar-free vanilla latte and two cokes, I am at least coherent enough to decently comprehend, "What's wrong with you?  Have a bad night?"    Well since you asked, lemme tell ya about Last Night.

       Vote is tonight on Big Brother.   Jase and Marvin are up.  Please oh PLEASE get Jase out of the house!   I've had about all of him that I can stand.   Watched  urlLink  Don Juan DeMarco   last night.  It was cute and romantic.   There were some hot parts and lots of naked women (1502 to be exact.....but who's counting?).  But mostly it was about a fanciful young man who knew what his life really was, but made a mental choice to see something else.  In the process of relating his "perceived" life to the old fart psychiatrist that is retiring in just a few days, the good Dr. is reborn and finds himself all over again, learning romanticism and youth are only a state of mind, even in your sixties.  His wife completely appreciates the change (of course) and is continually asked,"You wanna go upstairs?"  He discovers her and puts more emphasis on making her feel wanted and understood on a daily basis, in spite of the calcium she takes so he doesn't break any bones in bed, the estrogen she takes to trick her body into thinking it's still 23, and the metamucil she takes she keep her bowels acting that way.    It's definitely a chick flick, saturated with romanticism and whimsy the way it is.  But I really liked it.   And may I just say (Harold got an earful last night), Johnny Depp is one of the all time hottest men on earth.  I dont usually like skinny guys.......especially after they WANT to walk around with ratty hair and gold teeth so they can continue to be a pirate long after the pirate movie has been made..........but man I could eat him up.  Buttah baby.  He turns me into Buttah.  Marlon Brando, on the other hand.......all I could think is, "Is that guy SUPPOSED to be diabetic in this or what?"   Well, that and "OMG!!!  HE DRIVES MY MOTHER'S CAR!!!"   1988 1/2 Buick LeSabre.  I miss the Brown Beast.  She was put out to pasture via a local charity last year.  She was a good'un, with no mechanical problems.....the apholstery on the interior had rotted out (well it was only 15 years old.....) but other than that...........  Faye Dunaway was really good in that role, but everytime I looked at her I thought,"I wonder if she knows how plasticky WEIRD all those facelifts make her look."  (>>giggle  How come Women are expected to look 21 (or 16) even at 65, but Men are allowed to age as much as they want and are called "distinguished" for it?
