Not able 2 feel or think ready 2 hold my breath and take this drink, im drowning all my problems away cuz this will be  my very last day, to think in the time  that m still alive as i call my shots &nbsp;2 suicide...  "As it turns Dawn" silent screams in my head, make me feel as if im dead. if you wont unlock these chains, youll see the joy &nbsp;by feeling my pain. everythings taken nothing is new, everythings broken- including me and you. the pain dwells deep inside my soul, until it is nothing but a dark empty hole the locks are rusty the chains are 2 tight, cant take this much more i cantput up 2 this fight. my soul is burning my spirit is gone, my body is leaving as it turns dawn...   this next poem is dedicated 2 mariah foster and darwin escobar "Thank You" i wanna say thank you fer always bein there, when im having problems you show me that you care.  youve helped me thru a lot but theres still much more 2 go, and ill always be there fer you 2 thats sumthin you should know.  i know that im depressed&nbsp; a lot but i try 2 hide it away, but the pain juss keeps growing stronger day after day.  but everytime i talk2 u you seem 2 make me laugh, and smile when im crying- even when my heart is broke in half.  so thank you fer helpin  me thru the rain, the depression,the loneliness- and the pain...  &nbsp;...xoxo...    **kill me mom** razorblade 2 my wrists gun 2my head, slashing away pull he trigger and im dead. suffocate me with pillows intoxicate me with gas, loss of oxygen running out of breath so fast. drown me with water bury me alive, running out of air having 2 strive. stab me 2 death overdose me with pills, the pain involved in this someday youll know how it feels. burn me with fire slit my throat with a knife, i cant go on living this fucked up life. hurry up and kill me i wanna die now, juss fuckin do it i dont care how. im never coming bac gone fer good, if i could see you once more i promise you i would....[ n o t ]heh    ---Unwanted--- the razor blades hurt when cuttin thru my skin, wat is life worth? with all the sin. struggling 2 be wanted but it was never that way, i think bout this same shit day after day. will it ever get better? i ask myself this, the pain juss gets worse will i really be missed? i press down on my arm and wait 2 be gone, 2 whom am i doing harm? its 2 late , my blood is drawn. lying on my bed waiting 2 die, a pounding in my head i shouldve said goodbye. i close my eyes and try 2 sleep, all the broken promises ill remember n keep. take evrrything thats inside of me as my last breath ends, throw it all away and thats the end...  ***remember me*** drowning in my problems wishing theyd go away, wish sum1 could solve them but they only seem2&nbsp; stay. you bastards made me do this take my last breath, will i really be missed- a long time after death? people that care fer me will treasure my soul, ill no longer be but a dark empty hole. so remember me as the one who slit her own wrists, to never be fergotten and will always be missed.    "gone" death is coming soon fuck the ones who care, theyll find my body but my soul wont be there. if only people knew about the shit that went on, then maybe theyd understand why im now gone. maybe if they payed attention and listened 2 me, i might still be here but now they have 2 see. see wat happens when you dont give a shit, kinda like my mom that stupid FUCKING BITCH! when she goes 2 hell ill meet her there, thats where im going but i dont fucking care. i had 2 do this er wouldve died from the pain, either that- er drove myself insane. so goodbye fer now  ill see you in hell, im already gone- cant you tell?  &nbsp; -in the darkness- a shadow is cast as my heart gives in, ferever it will last in heaven or sin. blinded by darkness i search my soul, only 2&nbsp; see sadness consume me whole. lost in despair i live in vain, i have yet 2 care numb from pain. my heart forsaken &nbsp;in this holy time, another love taken another crime..  &nbsp; )))) untitled(((((( alone in this place where nobody cares ,this life fucking sux its juss not fair. everyday is a problem waiting 2 be solved, but juss like the others i dont ccare at all. as soon as im alone ill take out the knife, put it 2 my arm- there goes my life. gone in an instant without a trace, wats never 2 be seen again is my face. you never knew that i felt this way, but now its over this is my last day. ill miss you all &nbsp;hope 2 c u again, sometime... in the end...  &nbsp; -world of dreams- waking up in a world of dreams, or is it real? lie it seems. wishing it was so people would know, how i really felt and why i had 2 go. theres really no point in trying 2 explain, youll juss have 2 c by feeling my pain. if i could start all over again, i would... but now it has 2 end. take the gun put it 2 me head, pull the trigger- and im dead....  &nbsp; +how i feel inside+ i feel unwanted ashamed and alone, cold n hurting without a home. lost in my thoughts memories of pain, weak and abused without n e strength. guilty is my conscience empty is my soul, cant go much longer till my feelings unfold. im wrapped in this darkness surrounded by hate, binding around me this is my fate.  &nbsp; **you said...** u said my life wasnt&nbsp;bad but u gon see wat the fuck its like bein me. you told me u cared bout wat i did, but u didnt know  bout half the shit i hid. u said id never die this specific way, but u gon see u gon see 2day. razor 2 my wrists gone so fast, now u can finally say im just a thing of the past....  &nbsp; ----razor blades---- they help me 2 numb the pain inside, but yet they still seem 2 be keeping me alive. they leave me with cuts turning into scars, sumtimes i wish life wouldnt have gotten me this far. if the razor wouldve gone a little more deep, then i couldve died while falling asleep. asleep ferever while the blood pours out fast, remember this day bc it will be my last. am i going 2 purgatory? heaven or hell? or are there suck places? ill find out soon n i will tell. ill tell u n the others &nbsp;how it feels 2 slowly die, u see how i did it- but still ur questioning why..  &nbsp; "faded" everything fades people drift away, everyone changesday by day. they call me psycho but they really dont know me, if i had a dick they could all blow me. ive lost the faith  that i had before, you broke my heart so ive stolen yours. memories never change but people always do, everythings unreal including me n you. ive got nowhere 2 run ive given up ont his life, so fuck this all--- gimme my knife....
