      I can't sleep!! AHH!!  I've came to realize my father has changed his mood in to being a unbearable bastard to be around... again!  He's been acting werid, rude, mean, greedy, and just an ass for the last 3 weeks but yet we all thought it was because mom took him off some pills!! Boy, were we SO wrong!! Brian, Amanda, John, and Sarah have even noticed the change in his attitude -- They don't like it! Heck, they don't even stay at the house that long due to his bull shit.  However, Seems like everything that happened 2 years ago -- is about to happen all over again.  It was the reason I moved out, it was the reason mom had a heart attack, it was the reason for a lot of things that happened and yet I can't do anything to stop it nor can anyone else. I just feel bad for mom because she doesn't deserve this sort of treatment especially with all the shit she puts up with and does for him/us/everyone.  I need out...  I need out soon...  Why is it every time you think everything is going to be okay... It never turns out that way?! No matter how hard you try to see the good... the bad creeps back up and breaks your heart!! Maybe someday all this will change but I highly doubt it.

      Christmas is over!   It was alot better then I expected it to be however, it was so odd not having my brothers or Ashton around.  I guess with them finally moving on with there lives and having girlfriends, it's something I'll just have to get use too.  Any way, now that Christmas is over and the New years is around the corner I can finally put my mind towards my surgery.  I should know by January 7th or 8th if my insurance approved me the 2nd time around, gosh I hope too!! I have my fingers and toes crossed.  The doctor said if I get approved I'll have a surgery date for January - I can't believe this is finally going to happen and I can FINALLY move on with my life -- I can't wait!!!  However, this is gonna be a LONG weekend -- Mom's in Michigan with John & Sarah, I've been left behind with Dad!! Hopefully, we don't end up pulling each others hair out.... Then again I'll just stay busy cleaning my house and taking all this Christmas crap down, so my house can be clean, simple, and cluter free before surgery!! Everything will be move along smooothlyy!  Alrighty -- Here's the  urlLink Friday Five .....  1. What was your biggest accomplishment this year? ~To be completely honest - I really don't have a big accomplishment for this year other then the fact I finally found a doctor for my gastric bypass surgery.  I know that's not a big thing but if you were in my shoes.... you'd understand! :-)  2. What was your biggest disappointment? ~My grandfather passed away on July 25th -- The reason I'm disappointed is because I never got to say good-bye or I love you or anything because I was to busy with life to take the time an go to Michigan to see him while he was sick or was it because I was selfish or afraid? I'm not sure but someday I'll be able to come to terms with this.  3. What do you hope the new year brings? ~A healthier life, happier life, and me back in college!!!!!  4. Will you be making any New Year's resolutions? If yes, what will they be? ~Yes, My new year's resolution is to get my surgery date and follow the doctors orders and to take ever dang pill that I'm suppose to take!! :-)  5. What are your plans for New Year's Eve? ~My plans for New Year's Eve is to spend time with friends @ Heather's house! :-) I can't wait -- It should be a blast and I'll finally get to meet Tony in person!! YAY!! :-)

      Last night I had the strangest dream!!  It was someones wedding but I'm not sure who's other then the fact I was just about to go dance with someone?! They didn't have a face or I just don't remember that part... My grandfather was playing a piano and he was wearing the same light blue suit that we buried him in.  Then right before I woke up my grandfather whispered in my hear "Everything is going to be okay!"  .... Then my phone rang and woke me up!! So I have no idea what he was telling me but I find this dream so strange because it seemed so real.  Today... Pap has been gone for 5 months!  I miss you and love you, Pap! Merry Christmas wherever you are!!

       Some things never seem to amaze me.       Ashton was sick with a cold & fever all weekend; yet Brian & Amanda still went to the 'Wine &amp; Cheese' party while mom & I babysat baby Ashton.       I love Ashton with all my heart! I love him has if he was my own child but damn it this isn't fair! I actually could of gone some where this weekend but I didn't -- I stayed home to help babysit because I knew mom didn't have it in her to run after a 1 year old for 2 days.      Instead of saying anything - I just sit back and feel completely left out and lonely has usual. It's not fair! Ugh!      We were suppose to celebrate Christmas this weekend too but because it was to much out of there schedule that was canceled too.       What totally fucking pisses me off too -- Is the fact Brian can fix his girlfriend's MOM's car and yet when I had mine... he was to busy to fix it. He always gave me a million reasons why he couldn't but the fact is he just didn't want too. Then I was completely stupid and sold him my car to help him out!      Oh well...

       Ugh!       It's a week until Christmas and I still can't get into the Christmas spirit! I've tried everything but things just don't feel the same -- Nothing seems the same anymore after Pap passed away. I'm not even sure why; It's not like we were in Michigan that much to enjoy time with him or maybe I'm just feeling guilty? I dunno! I sure wish I could figure it out.      I just wanna hide under the blankets until the first of the year -- I wonder if thats even possible?! I don't even want to go to Michigan for the holidays because I feel so uncomfortable with myself right now or more like I just feel like a huge failure compared to all of them or just flat out jealous.Maybe someday all of this will change....

      I wish someone could explain to me how this is "okay" -- I saved up $500 bucks to go back to school however, I ended up spending a $100 and letting my mother borrow $100 which she promised to pay me back as soon as possible.  This happened about 4 weeks ago and I still have not seen the $100 bucks yet my brother needs over $800 bucks and my parents handed it over to him without a blink without anything!  He claims he'll be pay it back but forgod sakes this is JOHN!  He owes everyone money!  They didn't give him the whole $800 - more like $300ish for all I know.  But I don't see how this is fair to me?! I want to say something to them but I don't want to sound like a bitch either.   John had plenty of times to save money - Hell he got over 80 bucks for x-mas and he spent it on a fucking golf bag and he can't even afford to fucking golf!  I haven't even spent my money because I'm saving it, just incase something comes up because I know I won't be able to borrow any.  AHHH!! It's not fair!! I almost think I'm the only one that seems to think this is wrong?!

      Surgery was canceled.   I should of known it was going to happen... Everytime I get so close to getting something I truly want, something gets screwed up and theres nothing I can do about it but pout.   Of course... my mom blames me for this happening -- I bring bad karma into my life.  I mean please?! How much more could my life be fucked up and she wants to say THAT! It's funny the lecture she gave me though, wanting to know why I hate my dad and that I've been bottling things up inside for the last year and if I don't tell someone soon, it's gonna eat me inside till I can't handle it any more.   How hard is it to figure out why I hate my father? Shall we make a list?  ~ It's okay for him not hear things but when his deaf daughter asks him to repeat he blows a casket and starts yelling. ~ Seems like he can talk to the whole world but yet he can't hold a conversation with his own daughter. ~ If I even do one thing wrong - I get yelled at but doesn't matter that all in all.. I'm one of his better kids! I've never done drugs, I rarely drink, never been to jail, don't borrow money unless I attent on paying it back. ~ The pure fact that I'm just suppose to forget about what happened in the past.  Every time he'd come over hitting the door so hard that I'm surprised he didn't knock it out then shutting off my electric or phone because he wanted too. ~ The fact he's hurt me so badly that I felt the need to take a knife to my wrist and yet no one even knows about that.~ The fact sometimes I think he forgets I'm even his daughter and that I do have feelings. ~ The fact that I know he blames ME for mom not having a job, he blames me for more things then I can count.  Ugh... I wonder if that list is long enough for her? Doesn't even matter because I'll never be able to tell her the truth without her getting pissed off at me and telling me I just need to forget what happened but how can you? When it happens all the time!  They've taught me to keep all this bottled up inside almost to the point that I can't or won't talk to anyone about it.  What's funny is... She brings all this up the day after I have dinner at there house.  I sat there eating left overs at the kitchen table while my father sat right next to me playing cards and he couldn't even say one word to me!! Not one fucking word!! I guess I'm suppose to ignore things like that... Huh?  Blah....  I wish it was that easy.... I really do.

      Hmm there is something with my family and pajamas!  Today my brother came over to feed the cows because my parents are out of town -- He shows up in his pajama bottoms and a shirt.  However, I had to be a smart ass and ask him why he wasn't dressed.  -- Of course, he had to be a smart ass back because there I was standing in mine.  I'm always in mine if I'm home all day It's comfortable and saves time on laundry... usually. But I do believe we need to buy more cloths.  I haven't really bought any in awhile because I knew I'd be having gastric bypass surgery soon and any cloths I bought would be to big within a week or so. I do miss cloths shopping though, that's on my list of things to do -- very soon!

      "Self-love is the only weight-loss aid that really works in the long run." -Jenny CraigHmm...  That's to true. But why's it feel like I have to loss weight in order to find that self-love in myself? Ugh!  "Sometimes in your life you will go on a journey. It will be the longest journey you have ever taken. It is the journey to find yourself." -Katherine Sharp  I just liked this one because it seems so true.  "Difficult times have helped me to understand better than before how infinitely rich and beautiful life is in every way and that so many things that one goes worrying about are of no importance whatsoever." - Isak Denesen  With all that I've been through in the last few years of my life - That quote couldn't be any truer(if that's even a word). It's funny though... How much you can realize about the life around you during the worst times of your life. I guess my parents did well when they taught us to always look at the brighter side of things, or realize things aren't has bad has you think, or... the list can go on and on.  However, I must get to sleep now! Sweet Dreams!

      I've come to realize I'm a big ol wuss!  I can't sleep worth a shit when my parents are out of town.  It's really silly if you think about it -- I'm going on 23 years old and I live alone.  But for some reason when my mom leaves town I can't sleep.  I've also come to realize -- she's like my 2nd pair of ears which means she looks out for me more then I'll ever realize.  I have a special mom.  I really do! It's about dang time I've realized that too because someday I'll have to leave her side and move in to the real world -- Not that I'm not in the real world now.  I mean like move further away from her, start my own life, have my own dreams... Hmm I have those now.  Ugh, I realize what I mean but I can't seem to put it words!! I give up but I do have a great mom and I'm very lucky for that!  Any ways, I do have some great news -- I recieved this yahoo IM tonight from a sweet & handsome old friend! I'm so happy to be talking to him again but gosh, I hope he doesn't disappear again if he does.... Hmm who knows?  LOL! I do, however, understand why he left.  So I'm guessing that's a good thing that we were able to get over that.

      It's COLD!  I keep turning the heat up but my fingers and toes are still froozen... Ahh!  Any way, I can't believe I did it -- I cut my hair! 10 -12 inchs! It's gone! Well not really gone, I keep it in a pony tail to send to  urlLink locks of love , it'll make a child with cancer happy and beable to live a somewhat more normal life.  However, in some werid way my head feels lighter... sheesh, never realized how heavy that dang hair was and not only that I actually don't run out of HOT water when I take a shower due to not having to wash such long hair 2 or 3 times to get it clean.  I now need to get a new picture online of me with shorter hair!!

      I have a date for surgery!  I have a date for surgery!  I have a date for surgery... FINALLY!!  Hmmm I can't seem to stop saying that to myself.  I'm so happy yet a huge part of me is completely scared.  I'm sure has the days go by and I get closer to this actually happening alot of thoughs will be going through this head of mine.    However, for now I need to make a list of things to do in the next 3 to 4 weeks before surgery.  Clean house   Finish laundry   Wash all bedding, blankets, and sheets.   Pile up on groceries such has -- Carnation Instant Breakfast, Sugar Free Jell-O, Sugar Free Pudding, Sugar Free Popsicles.   Buy water!   Buy Vitamins with minerals.   Buy some hospital sleep wear!   Write letters to my family and friends!   Update my e-mail addresses.   Gather phone numbers.   That's all I can think of for now but I'm sure has time goes by there will be more things to add!!   I have so much to do and so little time to do it in.  I also have to decide whether to tell my grandmother the date of surgery or wait and call her afterwords.  I don't want to worry her and I don't want her out in this crazy winter weather driving back and fourth from Michigan to Tennessee.  Any way, I must get to bed! Today is mom's birthday, I should be awake in the morning to go do something with her for the day.

      I can't sleep, my tooth is killing me, my ankles swollen, and all I wanna do is sit here an cry! UGH! I don't bitch like this but I just feel awful!  I don't know what is going on with me but tonight didn't help much when Becky decided to be a freakin bitch.  What right does she have not letting me have my nephew? I've never felt so stupid before in front of so many people!  I feel has if I'm being punished for caring so much about that baby... maybe I should be more like John and not want to be so much in his life and I won't have to deal with things like this anymore? I dunno! I could understand if this was only the first time she's done this but it isn't -- She does it to me every time she has that baby in her arms!! She acts like its her child and it's not!!  It's not even her family yet no one even understands where I'm coming from.  Blah...  I need a hug!  I need to know about this insurance too!  It's already January 3rd and I haven't heard anything... I'm starting to worry that insurance didn't okay it!! If this happens what do I do next?! I can't stay this size its making me uncomfortable, lonely, miserable, and... just blah!!  I need sleep! It's 6 am and I've been up ALL night... again!

      It's finally 2004!  Which is hard to believe however, I'm happy to have 2003 over and done with, way to many bad things happened last year and the worst was lossing my grandfather to cancer in July.  It's still hard to come to terms that he's gone!!  This year I've decided not to make any resolutions however, I thought I'd make a do/want list of all the things for this new year!   Loss weight - I'll be having my gastric bypass surgery soon!   Follow the doctors orders to the T!!   Take my meds everyday without some stupid ass excuess!   Go back to school and finish with my accounting degree!   Spend more time with family and friends!   Spend less time on this stupid computer!   Finish all my cross stitch projects that I have started.   That's all I can think of for now!! I do know that within the next year my whole life is going to change and I'm gonna need some time to process it all which I know I'll be able to get through because I have so much love and support behind me which means more then I can ever say.   So with all that being said -- Cheers! Hope you have a Happy, Healthly, Loving New Years!

      March 24th - I finally had gastric bypass surgery. It's so strange though, I read, researched, and watched everything possible about this surgery; Always hoping and wishing that someday I'd have it done -- And now I'm on the other side where the grass is suppose to be greener.  I'm not so sure that its greener but I do know its a hell of a lot harder dealing with life afterwards. I've always used food as a comfort thing and now it's no longer there -- It's not allowed to be there. In a way, food is like an evil best friend that hopefully, I've gotten rid of forever. However, it'll be tough... very tough but I think I can get through with it.  I WILL get through it! :-)

      I've survied a whole month after surgery. Yay! :-) It just sucks I have no idea how much I've actually lost but I'll find out next week... finally.  But on the downfall - I'm starting to realize what people REALLY think of me having this surgery and to be quite honest its really hurtful. Like I choose to be THIS fat and then have to have this sort of major surgery. I didn't have it so I can be a size 6 or get the men or whatever.... I had it so I'd be healthier, why is that so hard to believe? I'm not going to actually tell someone whats in my medical file because really its none of there business but you would think if they cared just a tiny bit they'd be more supportive instead of puting me in to tears and making me feel like some huge failure.  Blah. I knew this was going to be hard but I never imagined it being THIS hard because I really did think friends would be a hell of alot more supportive then they are. I should of known better or maybe I'm just in the wrong crowd? I dunno but at this point I just don't know where I belong yet - Hopefully soon that will change.  I wish Josh or Tonya was around - They always make me see the postive side of things and I know for a fact they support me through this. I'm a lucky girl for that too.

      Blah. I don't know what is wrong with me but I feel like crap. It probably doesn't help that I fell when trying to get outta the chair. I have no clue how that happened but it sure in the hell hurt my stomach. Hopefully, the pain will go away SOON.   Anyways, the whole no-stress-eating-anymore-thing really sucks. Especially when you hear your parents bitch about the money they had to spend while you were in the hospital. I mean hell, Am I suppose to feel bad because I'm trying to improve my health? Am I suppose to pay them back? What? I don't get it. I never said they had to pay for 5 nights of hotel - They had every option to come home and just leave me at the hospital. Heck, at this point I kinda wish they had because it's sure in the hell not fair to throw this in my face 3 weeks after surgery.  It'll get better soon, I'm sure as long as its not about money. BLAH!

      All I want is a hug. I don't want any food, I don't want your advice, I don't want to hear you bitching.... All I want is a hug. Why is that so hard to get anymore?   I've just went through the hardest thing I've ever done in my life and all I want to do is cry on someones shoulder. I don't want there petty, I don't even want sympathy. I just want a fucking hug that says "Yeah, everything will be fine" OR "Wow, your doing such a great job." But yet that is to damn hard for anyone to do because they think I'm going to fall in to my old bad habits.  How the hell can you do that? Your stomach only holds so much and if you over eat there's a chance you'll be throwing up. My past bad habits shouldn't even be talked about right now. It's over. I choose a new path in my life but yet they can't see that -- WHY????????????   I'll never understand. So instead I sit here wanting to cry even more, it's so werid to deal with stress because there's no eating when your pissed off, lonely, sad, happy, whatever. WHY can't they understand that? WHY?! I mean hell give me some credit for atleast facing the fact that I had a problem and I went through all this to fix it and atleast work through it on my own.   Blah. I just want a hug.

      Blah. I made it through my first holiday after surgery. Nothing really exciting happened though. Baby Ashton spent the night then my brother and Amanda showed up for easter breakfast. They didn't even do the whole easter bunny thing with him. Which I do believe was kinda wrong! :-(  So I guess Easter went "okay" other then the fact John is to selfish to show up for breakfast OR dinner. Why is it I'm the only one that sees the tears in my moms eyes when no one shows up for the holidays? But on the other hand I know why they don't! It's my dad's fault, instead of just enjoying the holidays - He always has to turn it in to some fucking yelling fight between someone and him. Then someone always goes home in tears, which is usually me because I'm stupid and I take everything to heart.  I just wish I had the nerve to just call John up and tell him what he did wrong but it wouldn't do me any good because I'm younger then him, which means I don't know shit in his eyes. Whatever. At least I showed up for the holidays despite the fact I couldn't eat anything.  I really really hate this no-eating-through-stress-bullshit. I want a chocolate bunny! :-(

      Today was the first day out of the house since surgery! Yay! Mom suggested we walk the outlet mall and see if I could handle it before the long 3 hour drive to Clarksville for my doctors appointment. I did well but I'm really tried afterwards from all the walking I did. It sucks but atleast its one step closer to goal!   Only thing I can't believe is how rude kids can be! :-( Here I am with a 14 inch cut, 55 staples, a whole on my stomach and my neck -- And they have to point and laugh. I never felt so stupid and awful before. It made me wanna run back to my house and stay here till the weight comes off. Blah.

      I've always  hated  water and I'm not even sure why! Hell, it's clear and flavorless yet its full of vitamins (so they say!). But if I hear someone say one more time to "DRINK YOUR WATER!" I'm going to throw a bottle at them or just splash the whole glass of it. That might actually make me feel better and maybe they'll just shut up about it.  I know there doing it out of kindness and love because drinking it is very important after surgery but UGHHHHHHHHH!!!  Enough said!  Oh one more thing. Which isn't about water but why is it when they come and check on me while I'm sleeping, they have to wake me up? What the hell is the point of that?

      Ugh. Yesterday we had tornado warnings until about 6 in the morning.  However, I was at my parents and the storms haven't quite got to crossville yet and its about 11 at night.  So I came home to get my hearing aids; you know incase my house gets blown away, atleast I was able to save those.    But on the way home I fell on a pile of freakin rocks and hurt myself pretty badly.  My knees are black & blued, my wrists hurt from where I landed on them, my voice is completely gone again from screaming when I fell, and the inside of my stomach feels like someone twisted and cut me inside - Not so fun, ya know?  I finally went back home around 2 am when it started raining.  Of course, my mom was worried that I may of busted my scar or something worse.  I mean I'm only 2 months out of surgery, the inside of me isn't quite healed completely.  And this is the part that freakin pisses me off more then falling on the damn rocks - Mom tells my dad what happened and instead of asking.... Oh are you okay? Oh is your stomach okay? Damn that Brian - This is 2 people that have fallen over this mess outside! Blah blah blah...  He says "You should of moved the damn rocks!" and then finishes watching the news.  Now I'm sorry but Brian started this whole rock mess about 4 months ago and last weekend he got FREE babysitting if he would work/finish the job.  Of course, he worked about 20 minutes and left a bigger mess then before and somehow its my fucking fault.  Gosh, Don't you feel the love in my family? Because I'm not!   ***Update: My dad picked up the rocks the next morning, so no one else would fall on them! :-) I feel the love NOW!

      I'm so sick of having to stand up for myself and all of my WLS friends that I've met on  urlLink obesityhelp  chat/website.  If someone disagrees with the surgery - Why the hell do they feel the need to let me know? Not only is it rude but also shows they don't care about my feelings or my health.  This surgery, by no means is an 'easy way out' has so many people like to think.  I guess getting a 14 inch cut down the middle of my stomach and then having a hole were the drain bag was for a week is such a great thing.  Oh and lets not forget the IV's that put a small hole in my neck and left an icky scar.  Oh and my favorite part was being put in ICU for 2 days because my blood level went so low that I almost needed a blood transfusion.  My other favorite part is where the nurses came in and pretty much put a lot of pressure on my stomach while making me cough -- That felt SO wonderful and again such an 'easy way out'.  Now that isn't even the tip of the ice burg.  I never said anything about what I had to go through BEFORE surgery or AFTER.  I never once bitched to anyone about the pain I was in, the fact I can't eat my favorite foods, or hell so many other things.  So to sit there and fucking tell me that you disagree with the surgery, when apparently it shows you don't know shit about this surgery other then the fact you know someone that died.  But guess what? Someone can die during many different surgeries, not just this one. And you know what else? Staying fat isn't fucking healthy either, obesity is a HIGH risk of death whether you want to believe it or not.   So with that being said -  SHUT THE HELL UP!  If you disagree with the surgery or don't want to support my decision to save my life or you just want to be negative about any of this -- Please stop talking to me, IM'ing me, or whatever because I don't need to hear it nor do I want to.

      The other day I was walking in to Wal-mart and eyed a old friend of mine.  She, however, had her nose up in the air like she was queen of the day or better then me, somehow.    She didn't say Hello, nor did I.  Which is probably for the best seeing I completely don't agree with anything she's done in the last few months.  I know I have no right to judge anyone for their actions!  But I don't think you should walk away from your own child, so you can go off fucking some guy.  But anyways, after this happened I realized how lucky I am.  I have some of the most amazing friends.    Tonya - She's been there for me through my ups and downs with everything, whether its with my surgery, friends, life, or even that one special guy that makes me smile!  Josh - There's not a day that goes by that I don't think of him.  He's made me realize what a beautiful person I am, inside and out.  He's made me learn to trust again, even when I didn't want to.  And I honestly think he's the only person I know that can get me to smile or giggle, even on my worst days.  I just hope that I make him as happy has he's made me over the last year of knowing each other.  With all these things and so many more, is the reason I adore him, cherish our friendship so much, and love him so dearly.  Tracy - My online dad!  He's stood by me, believed in me, supported me, and so many more things that I couldn't even begin to list.  I love him with all my heart!   Heather, Billy, Jill, Darren - There all amazing people in different ways and no matter what I know they'd be there for me - Just as I would for them! :-)  Friends like this are so hard to come by and the fact there in my life, is what makes me so darn lucky!

        WORSHIP! You're inner Bombshell is the beautiful Audrey Hepburn. Like her you've been blessed with a "certain something" that no one could describe accurately. You are more reserved than other bombshells, and that shows in your gentle, graceful nature. You like doing things for other people and love volunteering for your favorite charity. Yours is a rare gift in this day and age. You don't need to show a lot of skin to be sexy, all you need is your eyes. To see Audrey at the top of her game watch the movie "Breakfast at Tiffanys".    urlLink   Who is your  inner bombshell?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Today has been a great day!  Well sorta, I knee and ankles are killing me however, we went to the outlet to do some walking and they just happened to have a scale there.  I didn't actually think it would work but I wasted the quarter anyway.   So...  IF  the scale is right *crosses fingers and toes*, I have lost a total of  96 pounds  since surgery! I still can't believe it!   Someone needs to pinch me - So I know all this is true! :-)

I hope this is my last move because I'm getting pretty sick of searching and finding one that I like but the one on  urlLink mblog.com  for some odd reason isn't opening for me yet everyone else can see it.  Frustrating.   However, if I move again - I'm going to  urlLink Blog Moxie ! They have awesome graphics and it doesn't cost to much, I don't think!

      My 20 year old, size 0, perfect body cousin is graduating from college next weekend. This just makes me realize how fucked up and screwed up my family is and sadly my mom finally sees it. However, my dad is to stubborn to open his eyes and realize how badly he's messed us up, then again I'm not even sure stubborn is a good word to put there.  It's really hard to go from having everything you wanted or needed, then one day someone robs your home while your whole family is sleeping. It ruins your trust in people - Forever. Instead of being wiser about what happened, my father packed what was left of our lives and moved us an hour away from our family and friends. After this all he did was work - We rarely saw him and when we did he was probably pissed off and yelling or sleeping on the couch.  Of course, life never got better but we were living in a beautiful neighborhood. But what did that matter? 3 years later his business went down the drain due to....   1 ~ Driving an hour an half to work. 2 ~ Stopped listening to my mom when it came to business. 3 ~ LIED, LIED, and LIED.  By the time, my mom figured out how bad business was - it was to late for her to even try to save it. A year later we were living in Tennesse with no house, no water, no electric - Nothing but everything we owned in rubbermaid tubs. What a fucking joke that was, no wonder all of us are messed up. Dad had this screwed up idea that if he built the barn first - Business would come pouring in and sadly that's never happened because he lies, he makes up stories, he doesn't listen, and he never finishs what he starts unless its something he wants.  It's been 11 years since we moved here and still so many promises that were never keep and never will be. They're still living in the apartment that was built for us to live in until the house magically got built and yet I don't even think he cares if it does or doesn't but really at this point - what the hell is the difference?   I know its not right to blame your parents for your fucked up life.... but hell who's fault is it in this mess? who dragged us away from our lives so many times? who promised us stuff and never allowed it to happen? It wasn't my mother because she always tried to make the best for us despite what was happening and now it's like she doesn't even try or care anymore.  I can go on and on with this subject and I'm not really sure what brought it all to the surface. I guess the fact I'll be in Michigan in less then a month - seeing all my family, which I don't even want to see due to realizing how screwed up we look to them.   It's like I've been able to sit back and watch what was going on and I've just been to blind to see it until now. I just wish I had the nerve to sit down with my brothers and see what they say about this topic because even there messed up. Brian's been in trouble with drugs, John's a drunk, and then there's me that turned to food and became really fat. Ugh. Apparently, we all have our choice of drugs.

      I'm starting to get frustrated with everything and I do mean EVERYTHING.   First off - I personally don't think I'm lossing any weight! If I am, I'm lossing it everywhere but my ass and hips. None of my old cloths are fitting me - STILL. Although, my cloths are becoming loser though and my bras fit very odd.   Second off - Josh! I'm totally confused when it comes to him. He goes off to Russia and doesn't even say good-bye to me, which to be honest was really hurtful. He says his cable went out friday night yet Shay says he didn't prepare for the trip very well and was running around crazy. Then to top all this off he says a bunch of things before he leaves that leads me to believe that were something more then friends but sometimes it just doesn't feel that way.   I can't help but to adore him so much. He's one of the most amazing guys I've met in awhile and he actually supports me, even through stupid shit and not so safe shit. I just wish I knew what he wanted but I'm to chicken shit to ask, in fear its something I don't want to hear but deep down I know that he cares a great deal.   Third off - My mom is sick. They have no idea what is wrong even after the MRI and catscans! Her eyes look like someone beat the shit out of her and they blame it on blood pressure? What-the-fuck-ever! She gets dizzy and falls down - She eats and pukes. Hmmm yeah that's just blood pressure. Stupid ass doctors. Ugh.  Fourth off - Why do I keep meeting so many freakin FAKE friends? They use you long enough to get what they want and then POOF?! Ever since I had surgery, it's like people forgot my name. I really don't understand - It's not like I changed my personality or I'm asking for special attention. I just want you to treat me like the same ol Katie! I haven't changed!

      I never realized how lost I really was in this world until recently. I never knew the things you could hear - The birds singing, foot steps on your porch, rabbits hopping, the keys on the keyboard, rain drops hiting the roof, peoples real voices, music, water dripping, and so many other things. Some things I have no idea what they are because I've never heard them until now.  I'm lost. The Audiologist said it would take over 6 weeks to really figure out what I was hearing because my brain is use to a silent world that doesn't exist. What's so funny is, I didn't believe her. I figured everything would be the same but the fact I could finally hear people talking to me.   I'm actually afraid to wear these in public infear of hearing all those rude comments from people due to my size. I'm not stupid, I knew they always made fun of me but I had one advantage that they didn't know about - I couldn't hear them.   However, the one thing this whole thing makes me realize. I truely do need help but the thing is I don't know what kind of help nor do I know who to ask.

      Blah. I've lost a total of 52 pounds in 6 weeks. I know I should be really happy but I feel like I let my self down somehow. It should of been a bigger loss, much bigger loss.   What really doesn't make sense is - They give you a list of food to eat during the recovery stage and then when you tell them, you actually followed it and foods didn't bother you. They give you that "oh you've been eating to many carbs?" - What the fuck? You told me to eat that shit. So don't you sit there and point the fucking finger at me and make me feel like a HUGE screw up, once again when it comes to weight loss.  The other thing that makes no sense at all -- How different doctors are when it comes to eating foods after surgery. How can one doctor say "Yeah, go ahead and eat blah blah!" but yet this doctor over here says "No, that will make your stomach huge... blah blah!" - It makes no sense to me at all, they all just preformed the same surgery - shouldn't it be the same diet also? Strange.  Anyways, everyone keeps telling me how proud they are - My mom, Grandma, Online dad, Josh, Tonya.... but yet why don't I feel proud of myself yet? I wish I know this answer.

      My life for once is coming together, quite well if I say so myself. But yet why do I feel so lost and confused? I've had gastric bypass surgery and the weight is falling off, I think. I'll find out tomorrow at the doctors! Maybe the lost and confused feelings is just a side of depression that you go through during the after surgery stage? If this is true, I refuse to take some stupid happy pill because it'll go away in time, it always does.  And I'm actually getting a brand new pair of hearing aids. I know to some people think that's no big deal but for someone that's always missing out on things because of being deaf -- This is a HUGE thing. It's so strange though, when I tell someone that I'm getting hearing aids - It's like I want turn red and hide under the table because of being deaf. Why do I feel I should be embarrassed?!?! Yet I know in my head I can't change this.  On top of all this - I have a chance to get back in school, full funding and all. I just don't think I can handle 15 credit hours and pass them with a C or above. I'm terrified but yet I know the reason I failed last time was because....  1. I couldn't hear the teacher. 2. I was uncomfortable as hell and couldn't think straight. 3. I didn't realize how important passing school was until now.  But what if I take this chance and still fail? The fear of the unknown scares the hell out of me and yet I could go under the knife, not knowing if I was going to wake up or not. I'm so weird.  I need to make these decisions and I know I need to make them soon or it'll be to late. Then again maybe for once in my life I'll get something right and I'll be able to move on to a happier and healthier life. The best part about the whole thing - I'll be able to walk away from this hell hole that my parents call "home" and know I did everything possible to make things better for myself. I may of had to ask for help along the way but atleast I made it at the end.

      I saw this on Obesityhelp.com today - and thought I'd save it for myself! :-) ~~~~~ Some of you will thank me for this post, some of you will be in *denial* (that won't happen to me!) & some of you will one day, down the road, say *aha!! Cath shared this with us in a post*!!!  I have noticed that VERY few *long-term post-ops* post here - my belief is that they are either:  1) out enjoying their NEW life 2) backsliding & embarrassed to come here for support 3) believe that they don't need on-going & long-term support (WRONG!)  Last week at my surgeon's support meeting, I sat with another 2-year-post-op. We discussed where we are at this juncture of our *journey*.  -We can eat WAY more than we used to... (pouch has stretched) -We can eat WAY more things than we could as new post-ops... (things don't make us queasy like they did @ first) -It's very easy NOT to exercise (no sense of urgency to do the RIGHT things)  Here is where *reality* sets in.  The habits that we form during the *honeymoon* period (1st 6 months post-op) will dictate our success long-term.  IF we start eating bad & complex carbs early on... IF we don't exercise... IF we choose the wrong foods... We will struggle to maintain our weight loss long term.  And don't forget.... Carbs turn to sugar, sugar turns to fat. Period.  Our surgery is ONLY a tool to allow us to rid ourselves quickly of the excess weight we have gained over a lifetime & to start over *fresh*.  It will NOT allow us to keep that weight off by *pure magic*.  Our goal is to NEVER diet again...  Our goal should be to find the foods that we enjoy (protein FIRST) & incorporate those foods into our new *lifestyle*.  *Stress* eating does not go away magically with this surgery.  These past 3 months have been very stressful for me & I find myself back to old habits of grazing & eating just because it's there.  This is extremely distructive behavior and we MUST recognize it and control it before it controls us (again).  Foods that I enjoyed pre-op are starting to sound GOOD to me again (Sonic chili-dogs, hamburgers, etc). It takes a concerted effort for me to pass a Sonic and NOT pull in. It's not easy.  This post is NOT to in any way diminish the enthusiasm that I see here daily on the board, but to make sure each & every person on this journey knows that we MUST pay due-diligence to a new *lifestyle* to maintain our weight loss.

      Happy Birthday Pap!  Last week was my Grandfather's birthday - It really didn't hit me that he's gone, even know it's been 11 months since he passed away.  But I think the reality of going to Michigan on Tuesday and walking in to my grandparents house without Pap there, is starting to scare me a bit because I'm not ready.  I'm not ready to see his empty chair, I'm not ready to see his chair at the table being used by someone else, and I'm so not ready to sit on the front porch where he use to spend his summer days counting cars and watching the church across the street.  I wish he could be here!  I wish he could be here to see how well I'm doing with my surgery and see how I'm changing into a better person - A person I know he'd be so proud of.  I wish I could of spent more time with him instead of wasting the time I did have with him.   However, I know he's up in heaven!  He knows we all love him and miss him especially during the holidays - His favorite times of the year.

       urlLink I Miss My Friend ....  This song totally describes my friendship with Josh!  It's funny how it comes on the radio while I'm sitting here thinking about what to do with the whole friendship but the truth is, whether it feels like he used me or whatever... I really do miss the old us.    I miss our pointless conversations about anything.  I miss him being able to make me giggle or laugh when I'm feeling my lowest or just in a icky mood.  I miss the fact he can make me blush, just by saying how good I look or whatever.  I miss the fact I thought I could trust him, no matter what. I miss all that but on the other hand I don't like the way I feel right now! I can't shake the feeling of being used but yet I want too because I know he cares about me...  I also hate the fact I hear information about Josh from Shay, rather then Josh telling me - I hate that so much!  It makes me feel like I'm not important, which may be true.  I mean hell he's going Georgia for a week.  But it makes me wonder if he would of ever told me if it wasn't for Shay bragging about.  Blah.  I wish I knew what to do!  I wish this wasn't so hard to deal with!  I wish we never sleep together if this is how it was going to end!  Gosh, how I wish this could be all different but thing is - I'm not sure what I want out of the whole deal now.    I wonder if I'm making this a bigger deal then it should be.  I wonder if he thinks I'm just being a bitch about it? - Maybe it be best to just forget about what happened and just think of him as some online friend, rather then someone I've sleep with and got feelings for.......

      I can't believe it!  Yesterday was my 3 month post-op day! Seems like time as just flown by and weight is dropping off me. However, so many changes as happened in such little time....  -My energy is up! -My self-esteem is sky high!  I actually want to look better, when I leave the house. -I walk, daily. -My house is cleaner. -I enjoy leaving the house - Just so I can walk more.  Gosh, life is great! :-) I went cloths shopping yesterday and found out 2 things..... One - I can wear jeans again! Yay!  Two - My boobs are shrinking along with the rest of my body!  Talk about sucking ass!  I always thought I'd be the one person that can say "haha! my boobs stayed big!" - I know thats selfish but damn it!   I'll live! :-)

      Ugh! I didn't walk for 3 days and now it's kicking my ass! Well I did go shopping yesterday and walked around the store while waiting for mom but I've finally realized that isn't the same as actually working out and moving these joints.  However, I've done a half a mile of walking this morning.  I'm gonna try to do another mile later today.  I know I can do it because I was up to a mile in half last week!  Anyways, I have about 3 weeks till I go to Michigan.  I need to get more active, so I can show those size 0, smart ass, no-it-all cousins of mine to shut the hell up! Okay, I probably won't actually say that but I'll be thinking it.    I need to learn not to be so shy!

      Ahh! It's been a frustrating few days.  I finally had the talk with Josh and to my surprise, which I sorta knew deep inside - He thinks we're only friends, that's all we've ever been, even after I sleep with him!  I can't help but to feel used though!  He knew that I was never into being friends with someone and having extra benefits.  I've told him that from the start of our friendship but I guess it's funny how guys remember what they want and forget everything else.   Anyways, now I need to decide if I want to keep being 'just friends' or just move on with my life and forget it.  I mean is the friendship that good? If it was, would he of done this to me?   But the main thing that really gets me is - When we met, I was really shy with him but he keep trying to get me out of it, which finally happened and we sleep together.  However, if he just wanted to be friends - why the hell did he work so hard?   Blah.  I'll figure it all out soon enough but for now I'm keeping my distance and if he wants to stay friends, he'll just have to prove himself.  I don't think I'm asking for to much there! :-)  However, on a good note!  I love my life right now! I'm happy with the way things are going, I'm even happier that I'm more active then I've ever been, and the best part - I'll be returning to school in the fall to finish my college degree then I'll be able to move on with my life.  And who knows where that will take me but I think good things will sooner or later come!   On another good note - One of my cute dresses in my closet FITS! It use to be so tight before surgery and now I can wear it again! Oh I'm so happy and I look cute! Hehe! :-)

      One of my WLS friends called today and of course we got in to talking about all the changes that comes along with surgery.  I gotta be honest though, I never thought the changes would take place so fast.  But you know, it makes me wonder if thats why I'm acting so strange towards Josh.  I seem to be fine one day and then the next be double thinking about pretty much everything, anyone says to me.  I do know, that I'll never be that fat girl that becomes skinny and then all the sudden wants to sample every guy that says hello to me.  However, the thought of me ever doing that, is just icky.  I do know I need to becareful but I also know I have a long ways to go before I'm that much smaller to even have to worry about such a thing.  But I gotta admit - I love the thought of someone adoring me and accepting me NOW, but also willing to accept me later after all the hard work I've done to become healthier.  I really do think their the one that should be able to go through all the changes with me, and then enjoy the ending result of watching me do all the things I've never been able to do in the past.  The thing that gets me the most is - People thinking I'm gonna change, alot.  I mean, what right does anyone have thinking they know me and know I'll change in to some bad ass, attitude, bitch - When they've not even taken the time to get to know me as I am now?!   However, with all that being said and being 2 months out - All I know is life is going to be a roller coaster ride rather then just a fat chick watching life pass by! And that I can handle! I just need to start trusting people rather then always thinking negative.  Hopefully, in time that will happen but for now I'm gonna enjoy the ride and hope I don't hurt anyone along the way because I can't open up.

      What a long weekend!  Mom & I went to Chattanooga for shopping on Saturday, which was fun.  For the first time in awhile, I was able to walk. alot.  By the time we got home - I was so tired though but it was well worth it!  Now I can't wait for more of this weight to fall off.  However, trying on cloths made me realize how much I didn't want to go to Michigan.  I do realize that I've lost 100 pounds, which is fantastic but I also realize if I tell people that at the wedding - There gonna just look at me like "So... You still have a few more hunderd to go?!" - Blah. I'm sure I won't get that much negative feedback but I'm afraid I will and I'm not even sure if I could handle it right now.   Sunday was a nice lazy day though!  Ashton & Amanda came out for dinner and it's always good to see the baby!! He's growing way to fast though and its so scary to think he's going to be 2 years old in a few short months.  Anyways, even know my weekend was great - I can't help to think about Josh.  He's back in DC for his grandmothers funeral and I haven't even heard a word from him, not even a phone call or off line message.  Ugh! I feel so outta place all the sudden with him and that's never happened.  I'm starting to wonder if maybe I should just move on and forget him, I mean he did it to me once before and I accepted him back into my life with open arms.  Although, I know I'd never be able to do that because for some reason - I just adore him way to much but still this whole thing isn't fair to me.   Hopefully soon - He'll get in touch with me but till then, I'm sure Shay will rub it in my face that he's called or whatever else she wants to tell me. :-(

      My alone time/vacation is over! Finally! My parents arrived home yesterday and I gotta be honest - I was really glad to see them! I'm still happy that I didn't go to Michigan with them, even though I fell in to tears a few times because I wasn't there but it was for the best.  But the one thing I notice about being home alone is - Your more tempted to eat, whether your hungery or not. I never thought that would happen but this stupid head hunger thing is kicking my ass! It really must go away because its not welcome, ever!  Anyhow, I still haven't heard from Mr. Josh! It's going on 3 weeks now! I gotta admit that I miss chatting with him but now that my heart isn't so into him - I finally realize he wasn't as great as I was making him out to be.   Although, there was one downfall about my weekend - There's some balloon shape thing sticking out of my stomach. It looks totally gross and when you lean back, it pops out of my stomach and the fat just sorta falls down. This scares me and I don't go to the doctors until the 13th to find out what it is!  And on top of the whole stomach sticking out balloon thing - I will never eat chicken again or atleast not for a very long time! I spit up chicken/spit for 6 hours Sunday night THEN the next morning I couldn't keep anything down for hours. Ugh. I guess this was pay back for eating s'more crackers when I knew I shouldn't of even tried but I blame this on the whole cow chasing bull shit that happened.  Speaking of cow chasing - I wonder how many calories I burned doing that and stressing about them. Hmmm... The good thing about this is - My dad was calm about my yelling about it and actually AGREES that he should of left some food in the barn. And on a good note - I get a new pair of Liz &amp; Me Jeans for taking care of them and not letting them wonder up to the main highway and cause alot of bull shit.  On that note - I shall go back to bed!  Life is goood! :-)

      I've decided to stay home especially after the phone call from my John.  I just wish I understood why he feels the need to be such an ass hole to me.  It's not like he really knows me or even spends time with me.  Plus, I'm pretty sure if he was to spend a WHOLE day with me - He'd be a bit surprised on how much his little sister as grown up but that would take time out of his schedule, that would also mean he'd have to spend time with someone thats FAT.   What gets me is - People seem to forget, I just had a MAJOR surgery and it does take time to bonuce back to where you were before.  There's no way I could of sat in a car for 12 hours, without getting out other then to get Gas every couple of hours.  Plus on top of that - I can't even eat anything that will be served at BOTH parties!    On the other hand - I thought I'd stay home and stay on program but I keep eating shit.  Which isn't good! :-( And I can't workout because I can't get the damn DVD to work at moms house!  Blah... Someone kick my ass back in to gear! Please?! I can't go into some funky depression mood.  It just can't happen!

      Wow! I didn't realize it's been so long since I blogged anything....   Not much has happened other then being 4 in half months Post-Op!  I'm down  121.5  pounds since surgery! Gosh, I'm feeling fantastic and never really though I'd be doing so well with this.  However, a group that I'm in called  urlLink Put Down The Dount  is starting a 'Bahama Mama Challenge' until the New Years.  I've joined it, only because I feel myself lacking in some areas of Dr. Hruska's program!  I stoped walking for about 2 or 3 weeks due to the hernia on my stomach - What a freakin lame ass excuse!   Although, I've started writing down everything I eat - Just to keep an eye on how much protein and calories I'm actually eating everyday!  And I'm back to walking 2 miles a day! Trying to get more in but taking it a day at a time, so I don't break the habit again.  Other then that life is good! :-)
