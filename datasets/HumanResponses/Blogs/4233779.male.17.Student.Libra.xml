						     Hours until I move to Madrid:  between 35-40 [!!!]    Current favorite song:   Single By Choice , by The Bangles.    So the weekend at the beach has been funny. We've spent hours at the beach swimming between huge waves and I got sunburt [ouch!] I have to say I hate going to the beach but this time was great. I'm gonna miss days like these in Madrid.    Saturday night was hilarious. We went to some discos and... a girl grabbed my ass! lol! Poor girl, she must be passing through some kind of strange phase. lol. We didn't like the discos nor the songs they were playing, so we prefered to spend the rest of the night walking, talking, laughing and having an ice-cream. Nice, isn't it? We came home around 3:45 but kept talking until 5:30 or something like that.    Now I'm back at home and I've been packing ALL my stuff. It hasn't been an easy process though. Despiting the large amount of shit I've compiled all over these years, the hardest part of all the packing hours has been finding things from my childhood. I've cried for the first time in a long time. It's not that I haven't cried in a long time, is that I barely remember crying like that. Once I started, I couldn't stop in 25 or 30 minutes. I think moving to Madrid's gonna be much harder than I though [if that's possible]      Anyway, I should start to think in a brighter way cause I'll be in my new place in less than two days. My next post will be from the capital. I gotta go now, it's really late and I still have to pack some more. Take care.      Santi

						      Days until I move to Madrid : 6    Favorite song at the moment :  Sweet Sixteen , by  Brendan Scott .      I've been offline for two days thanks to my marvelous Internet company that I'm leaving in a few days. And damn glad about that.    I've spent the day at home but at least it didn't turn out into a depressing day like last Sunday. I've been packing some of my things while listening to Belinda Carlisle and watched tv for a while [why summer tv is sooooo crappy??!!] I'm going out tomorrow, or at least that's what we've planned. My friend Fran has invited me and Julia to go to his pool tomorrow. It's gonna be fun, that's for sure. We've gotten closer over this month cause the rest of our little group is out of the town, so we meet every day to take a long walk around the city while we talk about anything and share a Coke or eat candy.      Oh, I have to tell you about yesterday. We were at McDonald's because Julia wanted to get something to drink. Everything was just fine until I saw *him* standing on the door. It's hard to explain who's that *him* in a few words. Basically, he's a guy I "met" in school and I've been fancing him for two years and a half. He's handsome. He's tall. He's intelligent. He's gay. He's single. He's a friend of my brother [not a close one, but they have some mutual friends] Sounds great, uh? The sad part is that I've never had the guts to tell him about my feelings. The people who know about him keep telling me that I'll always regret about that, and they're absolutely right. But I guess that everyone has acted like this with their first serious crush, right?    As you can see at the top of the post, I've started a countdown. I like countdowns [yes, I know it's weird] and I'll make one every time I have something important to wait about. I'm also listing my favorite song[s] of the moment. Just for the sake of sharing.    See you,    Santi

						     I'm having a bad day for some reason. I think that's probably because I'm moving to Madrid in a few days, and I guess I'm not ready for it. Some years ago I was dying to move there. It was the city of my dreams and couldn't wait for the moment to move cause I knew that sooner or later I'd live there. God, I still remember how I spent many sleepless nights thinking about how great would it be to live there. But that was then, and this is now.
