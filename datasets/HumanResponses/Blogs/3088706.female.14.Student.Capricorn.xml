      Feeling kind of fuzzy in this new status as a blogger member.  Came up with a new thing Duck Suicide.  Gotta love those ducks....from rubber to real, it all works.  I was gonna call it RedRumkCud which is DuckMurder backwards, but honestly how many people would've caught on....ya that's what I thought.  So DuckSuicide it is.  Mustafa calls!!! Remember you can visit my other journal @ http://www.blurty.com/users/jibberishpoet  I will try my best to update evenly, but I can guarantee nothing!  Hug Me there I will add my hug counter here when I have time.  Msg Me on AIM @ DuckShoeMurder and chat w/ me @ Simbella's DuckShoeMurder there too.  I might be known as DuckEars anyplace else.  I have tons of aliases you never know if its me.  Will Blog Later

      I like rhythm and harmony........screw that melody.  Right now I am tired and bored and feeling similar to what crap would feel like...................................  Anyways on a more positive note.  Art of the Con kicks butt and I cannot wait till the sequel.  I want to film something so bad.  I guess it is time to call up kathleen, amy, and elizabeth.  In addition why don't i call sheri and katie too.  Whatever happened to my graduation party? I think it flew out the window with the rest of my life.  Shu boppity bop cant do that squat.  Hip Hop to the hippiest hoppster in the world.  Okay so I went shopping over the weekend. I got the following shirts: orange, brown and inbetween stripes, this little golden book belongs to, *ANOTHER BUNNY SHIRT* Crazy doesn't even begin to cover it, a blue one, and a white one. For skirts: a black one *I am wearing it right now* and an orange one to match the first shirt mentioned. For accessories: I got a necklace *hahahahaha For shoes: Nada.  It was all pretty cheap too.  Now I just gotta find that khaki skirt............hmm. I also need shorts but I didn't really feel like looking.  I don't think anyone has ever posted on this blogger.  I might as well check :/  So long...
