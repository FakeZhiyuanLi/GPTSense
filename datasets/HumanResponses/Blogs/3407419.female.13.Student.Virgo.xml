       urlLink    Dont you just love this picture?&nbsp; urlLink     I love this picture, the dragon and everything.... i dont know why, but i was somehow drawn to click on this picture and put it on my site as my own, please feel free to copy and paste it, i mean thats basically what i did. dont you just hate those people who have these really cool pictures on thier sites and make it so that nobody else can copy them? i do, my friend selin was looking for her fave band AFI, some really cool pictures of them that is, or maybe it was bikikni kill, i dont know but it was one of them, but anyways, she found these really cool pictures of them and right clicked, but the option for copying didnt come up, or the option for saving! those people must be really stingy, honestly.............

      Thanks for your comment carmela! and thanks also to everyone else who did or who is going too. im going on holiday soon, and im really excited cuz there is going to be english doughnuts on sale by there. as you probably have guessed i am not going abroad, my family is so big and it would be way too expensive, so im going to butlins instead. I AINT AFRAID TO SAY THAT I LIKE BUTLINS! i like butlins cuz there is loads to do and nobody asks why you do it. that sounds weird doesnt it, but just think about it and really it isnt. Think about words and really they sound weird so dont think about them, but think about those words. so goodbye........I'll update later XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx

      halooooo! hey and howdy doo! And how are you today?  i would like to take this oppurtunity to tell you that my name is laura, and i am 13, gonna be 14 soon, and that i go to an all girl school in enfield, england. im in a band called the bitch stiches with my three best friends called Selin, Chloe and Carmella. Well officialy we have announced a band but we dont have fundings yet so, i'll keep you posted. I listen to punk bands such as: Lost sounds , The jam, Tsunami bomb, The Smiths, The ordinary boys, ETC'. wht i hate most about this world is the fact that so many people are discriminated because of thier tastes. music and political wise. so thats about me. now i'd like to know about you, what you like and what you think about the world. just talking about me is boring. IM gonna put some cool pictures on here soon, look on google images and that happens, just like that magic, some of my fave pictures are there when you type in gothic angel. they are really cool pictures.  i want to talk about my friends and our band. My friend Carmella is really cool, she is really gothy and listens to cool music, if you want to talk to her then the link to her page is here: www.sleep_in_eden.blogstop.com well its not really much of a link but just type the adress in, i think it works. hmmmm.... she plays the electric guitar in our band, 'the bitch stitches' SELIN: she is probably the coolest member of the group and is the front woman in our band, she listens to really cool music and her band list is way too extensive to read without your eyes going blury! a link to her page is: SHE DOESNT KNOW. right well thats really helpful, thankyou selin! CHLOE: she reminds me of a timid little forest rabbit, that sums her up, she doesnt realy want me to talk about her. she plays the cello and the bass guitar in our band. We all have been deprived of decent boys recently, so please swrite in for a chat. And dont get the wrong idea, those of the male species. WE ARE ALL 13! well,thats about it for this page, but im going to update this page really soon, and put in a link for pictures really soon! thanks for reading this pile of rubbish,    LAURA XXXXXXXXXX

      Hello, my friends. you are most probably from my scout group, or one of my friends, from school i mean. and when i say 'friends' i mean if your name is one of the following...... ROB,SELIN,CARMELLA,CHLOE,LIZ. hehehe. i actually have more but you know, i cant be bothered to write more. my rebellion, is what made me cause this website to be made, cool name huh?  REBELLION For enfield scouts only... im fed up of martin, our group leader, he is sexist, and he has more hair than a thousand gorrilas put together. im sick of him and his son george. he practically dotes on the kid, we might as well give him a crown! All the games he picks FOR US, are the ones that HIS son can do best! IM SICK OF IT! and im sure you are too. so here is the plan. AND WE ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING AGAINST THE RULES!!!!! we are going to do exactly what he wants us to do, but with extremes, here is martins list of what a perfect scout group is.........(OPINION)  MARTINS PERFECT SCOUT GROUP 1) Works as a team.         SOLUTION: We play cards 2) Is quite and sincere.    SOLUTION: we dont laugh, and we speak like robots. all sad:( 3) does not fight or quarrelSOLUTION: we are only happy if we lose something. 4) Wants to learn           SOLUTION: WE only want to do scout work NO GAmes   It will be hard comrades, but i feel that after a few weeks of utmost misery, martin will be asking us to be the way we are now. Im not trying to get him out of the group, im just trying to make him realise that his perfect scout group isnt that perfect at all. MInd you i would like him out, but that is not the object of this rebellion.  PLEASE POST A COMMENT IF YOU WANT TO TAKE PART OR SUGGEST A DIFFERENT PLAN............                                Thankyou Comrades!  OTHER THINGS COMING SOON... Pictures of me and my friends!!!!!!! yay! HISTORY essays for help in history, cuz the internet sucks at finding the info you want!
