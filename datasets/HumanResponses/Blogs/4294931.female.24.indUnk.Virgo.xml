        With all the controversy surrounding the Swift Boat Vets group (you know, how the Kerry camp is saying that these guys are being funded by Bush and all that), you may or may not be uber shocked to learn this:         Some of the groups organizing protests at this summer's Republican National Convention in New York – including one anarchist outfit planning disruptions – get funding from a foundation chaired by Teresa Heinz Kerry, the wife of the presumed Democratic Party presidential nominee, reports  urlLink Joseph Farah's G2 Bulletin.      Heinz Kerry, worth as much as $1 billion according to some estimates, has directed donations in the millions to the  urlLink  Tides Foundation,  a 28-year-old grant-making institution that funds some of the principal groups organizing demonstrations and disruptions of the GOP convention.       The umbrella coalition organizing the protests is called United for Peace and Justice – strongly critical of the war in Iraq. The coalition was sponsored by Ramsey Clark's International Action Center, which was funded by the Tides Center's Iraq Peace Fund and Peace Studies Fund. Clark's group also sponsored International ANSWER. Both groups are run by long-time communist revolutionaries.        Teresa Heinz Kerry's favorite charity has also funded  urlLink The Ruckus Society,  an anarchist group known for disrupting the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle in 1999 and planning similar disruptions for the New York convention. The group has been training protesters for the GOP convention in the art of sit-ins and blockades.        Mrs. Kerry, working through the Howard Heinz Endowment, oversaw the donation of more than $4 million to the Tides Foundation between 1995 and 2001.        Other groups in the United for Peace and Justice Coalition funded by Tides include the American Friends Service Committee, MADRE, the Institute for Policy Studies, the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Lawyers Guild.            NO FUCKING WAY!   You mean to tell me Tah-ray-zah funds communist groups? And where's the massive media coverage?  (Read the whole article  urlLink here .)

        Reason #4566 Becca is not voting for  urlLink Waffles : Because morons like  urlLink these   urlLink people  are avidly supporting him. I guess you just have to read the forums to understand why I call them idiots. If anyone knows of a group (or groups) of idiots supporting Bush, please let me know so I can play fair here.  But I'm not wanting to discuss politics today. No, today I feel like bitching about work. Not the job part, but the actual work part. Forced overtime, to be exact. My dumbass new manager vowed to end approved overtime, meaning no one would be scheduled to work 6 days a week anymore. So I get my new schedule and guess what? Yes, I have a 6-day work week.  Ok, let me just lay it all out. I don't mind working overtime if I am continuing my day by pulling a double. I also don't mind being called on an off day to be asked if I would like to go to work. What I don't like is being told I have to come in on my day off. I mean, I would understand if we were short-staffed, but we're not. We have an ample amount of workers, enough for every position to be filled, so why am I scheduled to work 6 days this week? I plan my two days off - I plan things to do and people to see and everything in between. It's bad enough that working at night is causing me to seemingly live the life of a hermit, and when they force me to work 6 days, I am literally cut off from the friends and family for an entire week, and God only knows how many times they're planning on scheduling me for 6-day work weeks. I had shit planned for my two days off, and they fucking took it away from me without even asking if I would mind working 6 days. That's what pisses me off the most about these fuckwads I work for. They assume too much shit. And I have yet to see my fucking raise that's been owed to me since April... but that's delving into the realm of the payroll department, and that's a complete other story.  It would be one thing if it wasn't such a physically and mentally draining job that I have. I'm sorry, but being responsible for over $1 million dollars is enough to drain anyone. It literally takes me hours to relax after I get home. It's a high-stress job. I love my job, but it's just so damned draining. And my two days off are precious, because it lets me relax and not live with 8+ hours of constant worry.  Then to top it all off, they don't schedule me to work something easy. No. They schedule me to work the most stressful place  on my day off . Whenever my immediate supervisor returns to work after her nifty little vacation, I'm sitting down and having a nice long talk with her. I'm tired of getting the fucking short end of the stick  all the time . It's not just me. They screw everyone over. I say everyone, but it's not really  everyone . They have the favorites, and it's painfully obvious who the favorites are, and they just say "screw everyone else." I just know that I, for one, will not be taken advantage of anymore by these fucking people. They're really starting to piss me off.  One day last week, I was lifting a bag and pulled my back. It hurt so damned bad I couldn't stand to walk. But I sucked it up and finished the shift out. The next day, I called to see if I could take a few days off because my back was really hurting. They told me no. Fine.  The same fucking week, this bitch claims that messing with the money aggravated her carpral tunnels.  They gave her the rest of the week off .  I had bronchitis. All I wanted to do was sleep. I couldn't talk, couldn't stop coughing (a smoke-filled casino didn't help matters much either) and all I wanted was one extra day off so I could rest. They told me no. Fine.  This one chick had a slight cold (meaning, she was sniffling a little bit). They sent her home, and gave her the rest of the week off.  Yet, whenever I say something, I'm wrong. Fuck that. And fuck them.  I need a new fucking job. I'm going look at the classifieds now.

        Before going home, I stopped at the corner store for some chocolate milk and a Hubig's apple pie ("made locally fresh!"). As I went back and forth in my head about when and how to eat said pie ("Should I bust the wrapper open now or wait 'til I get home to put it in the microwave?"), I noticed the new Coke display, which was filled with cases of that new low-carb Coke. Dude. If I'm going to drink Coke (which I do a lot), I want all the sugar and all the carbs. Diet Coke and this new C2 crap is fake and totally bastardizes the good name of Coca-Cola. Stop trying to buy into the low-carb phenomenon, Coke! Be yourself! Isn't it bad enough our dairy prices are so high because everyone wants to eat cows? Poor cows. (Pass me a burger, please, to drink with my REAL Coke.)  I met Orlando Jones tonight. Uh huh. Sometimes the job has it's perks. I still think meeting The Platters was the coolest though.  I thought of another reason to vote for Nader this year:   6. It would spark interesting political debates within the family.    My mom, who I usually do the political talk with, is boring me this year. Whenever I want to discuss something concerning the presidential election, all she says is, "I like Bush. I'm voting for him, and that's it!" My grandma is voting for him again. My grandpa is diehard Republican and would rather die than vote for a Democrat. My brother's no fun because he agrees with everything I say. The only person I could have a debate with would be my stepdad, but having any conversation with him on any topic in which we have conflicting views has the same effect on the room we're in as the atomic bomb had on Hiroshima. Not only that, but my mom won't let us. Sometimes, even when I agree with him, he'll get mad... because I'm not using the same wordage as he is. It's quite amusing to the outsider, quite annoying to the ones who have to view it all the time, and quite draining on me. You can always tell when we're about to start arguing, because I'll give him my, "You're joking, right?" look and he'll yell, "What?" This is usually followed by mom finding a reason to walk out the room. Damn, I miss living at home.  But if I tell everyone I'm voting for Nader, I'll have the opportunity to lay out my reasons to them, because they'll all ask a horrified, "But why?" thus instituting a small, nice debate.  Well, I  was  planning on going to bed, but since my neighbor just started up the lawnmower, it looks like I'll have to occupy myself here. No, scratch that. I'm going play my games on Pogo instead. Ciao!

        Yup - a new home on the web. I thought it was pretty pointless to have that website since all it really was was a blog anyway. Besides, I was getting pretty bored with the whole thing. All links are still up.  So this is my home on the web now. All posts will be here instead of on the website. So I shall start with my last blog.    urlLink Waffles     seems to feel the need to whine about Dubya being involved with certain group    of Republicans funding the   urlLink Swift    Boat Vets for Truth   group. First of all, if he's feeling the desire for    Dubya to tell these people to back off, then he needs to tell the   urlLink MoveOn.org   asswipes to back off of Dubya, no? I mean, if the Vets group can't put out their own ads, then why is it okay for MoveOn.org to put out theirs? What I find funny is that Waffles never said anything about this until the latest polls came out that showed veterans are   overwhelmingly   against Kerry now. I forget the actual numbers, but prior to these ads, the veterans support was almost 50-50. Now it's like 57-37 in favor of Bush.   urlLink Waffles      doesn't like that the   urlLink independent    voters are being swayed  . Anyway, John Boy, if Bush is responsible for these ads, provide us with the proof. The only thing I can think of when it comes to this is, "...   says the pot to    the kettle   ..." Oh well... exit civility, enter mudslinging. Gotta    love politics.          I've complied my list of the top 5 reasons to vote for Ralph Nader in    November:             1. We   need   a third party in 2008.        2. I'm tired of hearing "conservative" and "liberal."        3. He's got the   urlLink coolest    campaign t-shirt   ever.       4. Because it's not trendy to vote for the third party this year.       5. It would be my own little way to piss off Michael Moore.            My friend who's over in Iraq sent me some pictures the other day. You can view    a selected 97 of the over 200 I was sent   urlLink here  .      Why do I love America? Because not only do we have   urlLink masturbating    judges  , but our military also provides   urlLink free    boob jobs   to it's female soldiers and our cops use   urlLink taser    guns on grandmothers  . "  God shed his grace on thee  ..."
