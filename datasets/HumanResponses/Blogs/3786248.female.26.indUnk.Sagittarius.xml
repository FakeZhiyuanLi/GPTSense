      When in high school, I remember wanting to come to LA for college only because it was away from home. I wasn't drawn to anything here in particular. I actually never even saw the campus until orientation week.  It was different here. I never got the sense that things moved faster like some people say about big cities. I just thought the people here were more extreme: the money, the dress, the attitude, and all that flash. This is the candy version of America with the big hair, the big tits, the big ass, the big cars, the big money. It was all who you knew and who knew you. People dream about LA like it's heaven, what with the streets lined with gold stars, perpetual sunshine, and beauty, beauty, beauty. This is the pinnacle of American pop culture: the magazines, the WB TV shows, the "reality series." I was never into things like this when in high school. I couldn't care less about who was dating whom, how to get the perfect tan, what to drive to look "cool." I didn't think like that. I wasn't that type of girl. I used to get irritated with the girls in high school who talked only of the clothes they bought or make-up or shoes. I hated the whiny talk of boys and shopping. I never fit in. I came to LA feeling like an "outsider." Would I ever find my people here? Would I be able to find a niche in this city of wicked, wicked values?   Flash forward eight years. I went to San Francisco recently and was so irritated with people; they didn't dress well, they didn't put make-up on when they went out of the house, they didn't worry about what type of cars they were driving. And I came back and did nothing but bad-talk them. I vowed never to enter that stupid, boring city again.   And then lo and behold, the other day I peeked out of this bubble I've somehow managed to create around me. My God, I freaked out! I've changed! I'm corrupt, just like all of the people here. I used to say that LA would never affect me. Now, I realize that I feel like everyone else is on crack for not holding high LA values of excellence in terms of beauty, success, and attitude.

      I started out my second year of college with a haircut -- a drastic, 1" in length haircut. It took two hours for the stylist to work through the jungle that was my hair, which fell way below my shoulders, and bring forth a short, easy, maybe-not-so-stylish-but-whatever haircut that left me bouncing out of the salon. I felt like I had just walked into new skin. I feel that way now. Not new skin, though. Just old skin. Skin that I haven't seen in a while. Skin that was here, but that had been hidden. You know, you sometimes lose yourself. It happens. Sometimes you get so caught up in boyfriends and family and work and friends that you forget what was the core of who you really are. When I got my haircut, I felt like I was returning to myself after hiding under hair. With this -- this blog, this writing, this thinking aloud again -- I feel like I'm returning to myself after hiding under what is supposed to be my life.
