       In honor of this bag's main color, I'm gonna post in bright green.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's a story...     A few months ago, there was a lil kitty who got a book called "Stitch N Bitch:&nbsp; The Knitter's Handbook".&nbsp; For the next two weeks, she kept flipping through, reading it like a novel.&nbsp; Sometimes, she even held off going to the litter box just to read a little bit more (I know, a little too much info)...&nbsp; As she turned each page in the color insert, one project kept sticking out...the punk rock backpack.&nbsp; It was cute, it was decoratable, and      it was a backpack     ...&nbsp; This kitty loved backpacks, as they were not as girly as a frou-frou purse (the kitty has a reputation to keep), and well, she loved that the designer was a punk girl from New Zealand (how much cooler can you get?)&nbsp; So, she attempted one in blue acrylic...well, her 7s were kind of crappy (and the silly kitty did not read that they should be 6s...she got gauge in 7s tho'), and it's kind of hard to knit loose enough to move the stitches on the needle when the kitty was trying to work on this whilst settling into a hospital ICU waiting room, worried about her aunt (who inspired the kitty greatly and probably was somewhat responsible for the craftiness of the kitty) who apparently had some weird reaction to some medication she was given for some sores on her legs that turned into an apparently common (?!?!?!?!??!) flesh-eating bacteria.&nbsp; With her little cousins running around, and well, not getting a lot of isolation time, even with headphones on quite loud and trying to hide around the corner from the rest of the family (this kitty is a bit of a loner), she put it up.&nbsp; That evening after going home (not willingly, by the way), she decided to pull out that knitting machine that worked about 80% of the time to do the large pieces of stockinette.&nbsp; She got a lower front and an upper front done, then decided to put it up to work on duplicate stitching the kitty design (modified from the bunny given) she was going to put on.&nbsp; All the while she is stitching, she is on the phone with the Puppy, who is the kitty's sister (heh, genetics is a funny thing), and away at college, and having the fourth and last "grandparent" figure die within 7 months (all the time while she was away).&nbsp; There's a lot of crying, a lot of talking, trying to figure out things...at approximately 12:30 am, the phone call ends, the kitty hoping that she will nto have to call the puppy again tonight...less than a minute later, the kitty receives a very irate phone call from another aunt, saying that she had been trying to call for several minutes...nevermind that there were two cellphones she could have called if the home line was busy...the kitty's crafty aunt had passed...later she would find out that her aunt actually died an hour later, but she was no longer on a respirator. &nbsp;    (NOTE::this is turning into a very long story...I can't give a summary to save my life)     Obviously, the knitting goes to the side for about a week...then is put away and forgotten about.&nbsp; When the kitty decides to attempt again, she bemoans the thought of wrestling out the knitting machine again, and decides to strike out on her own.&nbsp; THE Bag is born.    Grabbing some Softee Chunky in&nbsp; dark pink and lime green and a skein of Jiffy in a black/green/purple colorway, she proceeds...single crochet with a J hook, making two rectangles (one plain green, the other mostly green with a pink/black/pink striping twice on it), then making a gusset in parts of green, pink and black, leaving a place for a zipper around the top.&nbsp; She sews it together...almost done....      ::loud screeching noises...the kitty comes to a stop::      the straps.&nbsp; Lovely striped straps that are the first attempt are too short.&nbsp; The second attempt with woven chains doesn't work.&nbsp; I-cord straps are not a good match....and this is where it has stopped...with the kitty being more Maine Coon sized rather than Siamese, her straps need to be larger...so, it's a matter of experimenting and reripping because of the limited yarn supply...

       As I mentioned in a previous post, I really want to do this bag.&nbsp; However, with no job and no immediate prospects, going out and getting new yarn isn't exactly a priority ::sniff::, so real wool isn't in my near future.&nbsp; But, being the stubborn lil kitty I am, I decided to try and create a bag in a similar shape with smaller needles and multiple strands of yarn.&nbsp; I swatched and swatched and found a nice heavyish, thick fabric by using 3 strands of acrylic WW and size 10 needles...well...to do the base, I decided to use the same dimensions, and     that piece of garter stitch really, really, really hurt    ...my hands tired out after a few rows, then a few minutes later, I would go another couple of rows...80 some-odd rows later, the piece was done, and luckily, I don't have size 10 circulars :-)&nbsp;    Now, this is embarrassing, but I have 3 sets of circs...13s/29", 10.5s/29", and 8s/29"...an impulse purchase on eBay before I really got decent at making those little loops lay the right way.&nbsp; Well, somehow my 13s have gone AWOL, and the 8s would have been a death sentence to my wrists, so, darnit, I have to use the 10.5s :-)&nbsp; These definently don't hurt as much, but there's a strange drag on them, or I'm just working too tight, since the stitches on the needle don't slide really well...I know, I know...the Boye needles suck, and I should get Addis or bamboo needles, but did I mention my lack of cash?&nbsp; :-)   Well, after picking up the stitches around the base, I'm going around and around and around and have about 3" of the 8" I'm shooting for before color changing.&nbsp; They're a nice mix of colors...a multi with different shades of blue, green, purple and yellow, a nice medium dark teal, and a dark purple.&nbsp; I thought it would be sort of blue and purple flecked, but it's kind of a Mardi Gras theme, since I always seem to notice the bluish green, yellow, and purple combo...I'm going to have to switch in the black yarns I'm going to use for the top 2 inches, but I'm hoping it will be a gradual change...actually, I'm not sure if to start feeding them in 3 inches from the top (replacing one of the colored yarns with the black, then the next inch, replacing another one, and finally, having all three yarns black), or if I should just have a definent break.&nbsp; Probably should have swatched that before starting... ::sigh::&nbsp; Ya know, hindsight, 20/20, yada yada...

       The Zeeby bag...lovely and easy, nice size...straight stockinette except for little bits of garter stitch...    WHY CAN'T I CONCENTRATE ON IT!!!?!??!&nbsp;     I really want to do the felted bag, but my lack of cash sort of insists that any projects I undertake use my stash, and well, it's almost all acrylic with a bit of cotton.&nbsp; So, I'm thinking that I can do this bag in a nice blue acrylic that is sort of cottony feeling, but not cottony-resistant feeling (and of which I have one unlabeled skein...comparable in size to my big hunkin' 8 oz acrylic skeins).&nbsp; I want a bag...purses just aren't my style, I guess, AND this is NOT a backpack sort of bag (I really love the backpack style), so it would be a difference...and I just can't concentrate.&nbsp; Maybe I just need to look at it as a reprieve from the circulars and dpns that I'm also playing with...

       First official post in my spankin' new, pretty (and hopefully quite focused) blog.&nbsp; I've got a couple of projects on the needles (and one off tha hook!! sorry, had to do that), so I might do several posts in one day to keep them separate...It's interesting what you learn when you try something new...apparently, my knit stitch twists sometimes, and sometimes doesn't...but when I try to follow someone else's directions, it gets obviously twisted...::sigh::&nbsp; Doesn't bother me that much though, since as long as the stitches look somewhat like what they're supposed to look like, it's all good ;)
