      Can I just say that the ads that blogger put on here as a result of my user name (smackover) are hilarious.  Arkansas biker bars?  Hah!  And Smackover tourism?  I don't think Smackover has tourists.

      This is a brand-new day, ladies and gentlemen.  I'm switching to a blog way of life in hopes that the shorter format will appeal to my similar attention span and I'll, you know, actually update.  Now I won't be doing what's new with my life.  Frankly, not enough new stuff happens to make that even remotely interesting and everyone just hears about it anyway.  So I'll probably be using this space to complain, after all it's what I do best.  But first, stay tuned for a multi-post arc on why I like TV.  Cause you know I do.

      If you too are concerned with how much power the FCC is being given in this preposterous post-Super Bowl era (not to mention being worried that this is all an election year ruse but that's not really the issue), then you should go to this website,  urlLink http://www.stopfcc.com .  There you can sign a petition or even send faxes to your US Senator.  Free speech is one of our most important ideals in this country and I don't think that any one person's ideas about "decency" should infringe upon that.  Hell, I think Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly are indecent and I still show people their books, albeit grudgingly.

      Here's a conversation I had at the registers the other day:  Me: "Your total is $39.93.  Hey that's a palindrome!  Customer gives me a Look.  Me: "But with...numbers?"  Customer still silent.  Me:  sigh  "umm...nevermind."  I guess that wasn't so much a conversation as it was a monologue.  Or possibly a soliloquy.  What's the difference?

      Well I have not been chosen to be on a jury of my peers.  That sound you hear is my peers emitting a collected sigh of relief.  It was my first time ever being called into jury duty.  I don't know how I managed to avoid that for 6 years, but I was grateful for it.  As much as I believe in the concept of trial by jury, that doesn't mean I want to be on one.  Plus considering how much I freak out about my own future, I really don't think I'm qualified to decide anyone else's.  So needless to say, I was a bit apprehensive about yesterday.  Like always when entering new situations, I was paranoid that the worst would happen.  I consulted everyone at work about what reading materials I should bring to best portray the "you don't want me on your jury" kind of vibe I was looking for.  Suggestions ran from hardcore right wing radical books by a Michael Savage or Ann Coulter (although honestly, I don't know if I could stomach even pretending to read those books) or one about psychosis.  I then decided something like  The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook  would be best because of it's interactiveness, it would show that it was something that I was genuinely battling with, not just something I had an academic interest.  In the end I wound up bringing Misadventures in the (213), which was so funny that I kept having to cover my face with the book which I'm sure made me appear crazy enough.  I also wore my "Do I Look Like A People Person?" t-shirt, but it was a bit cold so I never took off my fleece.  Anyways, I got up butt ass early (I've been closing every night so my body clock is on a later time table) to drive to Martinez.  No offense to Martinez, but you blow.  Seriously, parking sucks, and I saw about 89 antique shops within a five block radius and one of them had a gigantic poodle in the window.  Who wants to own a gigantic ceramic poodle?  Stay away from me.    So I was directed to the jury assembly room where I filled out a couple of questionnaires.  One was a generic race, age, no-name kind of thing, but the other had questions like: "Do your religious beliefs make you unable to make fair judgments about doctors?"  What?  I couldn't in good conscience lie about any of these questions and worried about appearing like Miss Open-Minded 2004.  The only question I could really check yes to was if myself, a family member, or close friend had ever been a part of, victim of, or witness to a crime?  Well the bank that my mother managed was robbed at gunpoint.  Of course it was like, 1985 and I didn't find out about until years later, but I hardly see how that was relevant.  If that was a little too far back then I had a back-up crime.  My friend Alia was car-jacked a few years ago, also at gunpoint.  This was after I had moved away and we really hadn't talked in a while and I've only talked to her once since the incident, but we were close friends in high school so, semantics!  Then we waited.  And waited some more.  At least I had the forethought to bring the aforementioned funny book and Ipod to drown out Good Morning America/Live with Regis and Kelly/The View that was blaring in the background.  We watched the "Jury Duty Orientation" propaganda video where I learned nothing that I didn't already know from watching a single episode of Night Court.  And Dan Fielding, hell even Harry Anderson, was way more entertaining than any of the actors that they hired to tell us about the joys and honor of serving on a jury.  And I know what a fucking bailiff is!  I'm twenty-fucking-four years old!  The best part was when they told us not feel bad about ourselves if we weren't chosen for a jury, that it just meant that we weren't right for that particular jury.  Yes, like I'm going to go home and weep into my pillow, wailing about how I apparently wasn't far and impartial enough.  Then we waited some more.  Next about 75 "random" names were called.  Though I wasn't on that list, I was kind of hoping that I was just so I could go ahead and be declared unfit so I could go home and watch  Angel  (which by the way soooo good, if a little weird).  Guess what we did then? If you said "waited" then you just won a prize.  I'll be sending it soon.    Awhile later, another list was read of people who would be reporting to a courtroom after lunch, to which I said "fuck let's just do it now I don't want to wait that long"  Luckily I wasn't on that list either.  There were only about 30 people left in the room and I was beginning to feel unwanted, but in a good way.  Then they brought in one last list that consisted of 14 people who were to turn in their badges and leave.  Oh please let me finally be chosen, let this be the list upon which my name graces.  And it was.  Praise Jesus.  I don't know why I was dismissed, while other people had to stay. My only explanation is the aforementioned crime question, so the case must have involved a knifing or something.  To which I say, thank you mysterious bank robber who held up that Murray Savings and Loan in Dallas, lo those many years ago.  Due to your stupidity, I was spared a gigantic hassle.  I do have to say that after all my finger-wringing and teeth-gnashing I do feel a bit sheepish at the fact that I never left the assembly room and was home by noon.  But not enough to not feel psyched at the prospect of not having to perform my civic duty for at least another year.

      I know that I have a reputation of being a somewhat sarcastic, cynical hardass.  But those who know me a little bit beyond the surface level, understand that I have a whimsical side as well.  Never was that side more apparent then last night.  Eric and I embarked on a magical movie journey after hours at the Blackhawk movie theater.  We ripped on the implausible and inexplicable ending of  The Prince & Me .  He explained the exposition that I had missed from the confusing yet ultimately kickass  Hellboy  ending.   With the incompatible peppy music playing over the credits, we bopped right on out of the theater, and into the eyeline of some Danville "thugs" so we immediately ran away.    Then it was onto the main event, we finally got to see an entire movie.  And oh what a movie it was.   Ella Enchanted  was a crazy, wonderful subversive fairy tale.  I don't think that I have had such a gleeful movie experience in quite some time.  Of course seeing it in an empty theater where I could yell and cheer all I wanted probably helped in that regard.  I think Eric described it best when he said it was like a live action  Shrek .  The acting ranges from acceptable to good, from understating to 'dear God where did all that scenery go.'  And I know my feelings on singing and dancing in movies have been well documented: it makes every movie better.  Seriously, it makes great movies (the aforementioned  Shrek ) brilliant, good movies ( Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion ) great, and sucky movies ( She's All That ) somewhat watchable.  Ella Enchanted had two (well two and a half) production numbers.  The moral of the story is a little bit obvious, but with all of the fun I was having I really didn't care.  We were dancing throughout the entire movie, including the credits.    Now this movie isn't for everyone.  If you can only stand independent movies about the human condition and think everything Hollywood makes is worthless filth, then you're a snob and shouldn't see this movie.  If you're a guy's guy who can only watch our governor or a wrestling star blow up the bad guys, then your overcompensating for something and shouldn't see this movie.  If you don't have a heart, then stay home.  Everyone else, enjoy.

      Yay, I got a new phone the other day.  It's been a long time coming since I've had my old phone for nearly two years.  While the new phone is certainly very pretty (so shiny!) it's not particularly fancy.  It doesn't take pictures, function as a GPS, or turn into a swiss army knife.  I don't really need or want anything that fancy because quite frankly, not that many people call me.  I only had a few requirements.  One was that it needed to be a flip phone so no one will ever be subjected to the "Ode to the inside of Courtney's purse and whatever happens to be playing on the radio at the time."  I know that on non-flip phones you can lock the keys but I always forgot.  The other requirement was that there be a caller I.D./clock window on the outside of the phone.  I'm just lazy.  So now with my new phone I'll be able to respond to text messages.  I'm still not sure if that is a good thing.  People that I know seem to get into a lot fights over text messages which doesn't seem to be the most efficient way to fight.  I kinda liked having the excuse that my phone wouldn't physically able to respond.  Now I'll just have to fall back on the fact that I'm lazy and forgetful.  It seems to work for everything else.

      So I just googled my name and apparently I am also a conservative kindergarten teacher in North Carolina,a special education major in Valdosta who seems to like all things cutesy, and someone who really likes Walt Whitman and wrote a really bad paper about him.  Though I suppose my name is not the most unusual running around out there (unlike the newly monikered Apple Blythe Alison Martin)it's a little bizarre thinking about someone out there who shares that major part of your identity.  I mean are names are part of what shapes us.  A Rainbow can't help but be flighty whereas a Carlton can't help but be stuffy.  And yet these other Courtneys out there seem so different from me, all perky and cute.  Maybe  I'm  the badly named Courtney.  Damn you parents!

      So  urlLink two  of my  urlLink friends  are fighting.  Or rather two of them are attempting to fight.  One has horrific fears of confrontation (which I can understand) and has been avoiding talking with the other person except for the occasional veiled blog comment.  The other, after repeated attempts to talk to the other in person (one time I was actually physically present for so the other person can't even try to pretend that no contacts have been attempted,  Crystal ) has taken to not so veiled bitchy remarks on his own blog.  Other friends have added their own two cents and now it's a whole big blog fight with everyone because one person won't talk about it in person.  Got that?  It's all very convuluted.  I usually try to stay out of these kinds of things because usually everyone involved in group drama comes out of it with some kind of taint.  I actually enjoy a bit or drama as long as it's not happening to me (and it usually isn't because of the aforementioned staying-out-of-it) because I think it's fascinating people-watching.  In my experience the people who proclaim to hate drama the most, are usually the ones who court it the most.  They usually behave in ways that are so contrary to the no-drama code that it is a delicious study in people screwing themselves.  It's time to step out of the shadows and jump into the fray, because this drama is tearing long-term friendships apart over a boyfriend.  Crystal, this is not about Him or whether he makes you think you're happy.  This is about you.  We don't want you dissapearing inside of him, throwing away everything that is you all for someone you've only known for a couple of months.  Now maybe we don't know the whole story, but that's never going to happen unless you TALK to us.  Key word: talk.  We don't want to lose you as a friend, but by not talking to us(specifically Eric) you are saying that our friendship is not important to you.  That  we  are not important to you.  I'm not saying this as a threat, but from what I've heard, if you don't talk to them soon, you'll lose them forever.  If that's fine with you, then I hope you and Christopher are together forever because everyone else may not be there when it's over. If you don't call you'll lose friendships, if you do call you could save them.  This really should be a no-brainer.  Everyone else, a little less bitchiness would not be monumentally out of line.  I know it stems out of frustration because you care so much, but being mean is not the most mature way to handle problems either.  Let's grow up together people, maturity is within our grasp.  Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go back to the sidelines now.

      The most fun I've ever had at any job, involved a little something called,  The List .  Although, sadly, I was not involved in starting  The List , I came to fully embrace its intoxicating pleasures for it involved two of my favorite things: complaining about rude and/or stupid people, and wishing them bodily harm.  The two guys who originated  The List  envisioned a tv show where they wore armani suits and brought out people who annoyed them one by one.  They would then proceed to beat the crap out of that person.  When they were finished, they would through 50 dollar bills on the person and say "Clean yourself up you dirty bastard."  Yeah, I don't really get it either.  For the next few weeks people were rushing around to add to  The List .  No one was safe.  We put down specific known individuals, groups of people, celebrities, random customers, and even ourselves.  In fact one of the founders of the list was numbers 27-76 on The List.    The list grew to over 400 entries and 5 pages before  The List  fervor finally died down and eventually extinguished.  Until now.  I don't care about the armani suits or 50 dollar bills (although if someone were to give me some violence-free, I wouldn't complain), but there are so many people who need some sense knocked into them and by God I'm just the person to do it.  And when I say knock some sense into them, I obviously mean complain about them anonymously over the internet, so here we go (and warning: many of these will be bookstore related).  1) People who stay in my store (or any retail outlet) with young children after 10 p.m.  Kids need sleep and lots of it, a minimum of 12 hours a night.  That 7-8 year old girl that was in my store until 10:45 last night, should have been in bed by 9 p.m. at the very latest.  This particular family is there every Friday night and I suspect it is because they want their daughter to wake up later than usual so they themselves can sleep in.  While that's not the most heinous parenting ever, it's pretty selfish and I hope parents who do this are rewarded with particularly difficult teenagers.  2) Parents who sit and read magazines, or wander off to another section of the store while their kids run around and tear apart our children's department.  This is not your home or a daycare, this is a public area and a place of business.  I was fairly spoiled as a child, but my relatives would have been appalled if I tried to get away with half the stuff that these kids do.  And then I would have gotten my ass whooped.  We have to damaged out so many books that a child destroys because his or her adult supervisor is not paying attention to what they are doing.  3)  People who refer to the monster from Mary Shelley's  Frankenstein  as Frankenstein.  The doctor who made the monster is named Frankenstein, the monster itself has no name.  That's part of what makes it so tragic.  And scary.  Yes I was an English major.  What of it?  4)  People who tack the word "At" on the end of a sentence as in "Where's the maps at" (yes that is actually something someone has said to me.)  Now despite the English degree, I know that my grammar is not perfect, but this absolutely drives me up the freaking wall.  5)  Paris Hilton.  I hate that I live in a world where everybody knows who she is.  Even before the whole sex tape thing I knew who she was and I hated myself for it.  She has done nothing but be born rich, partied, and dress skunks.  6) People who don't tip enough.  I always tip a minimum of 15% and add to that for escalating degrees of good service.  Not only is this simply what my parents taught me to do, but even the worst waiter/waitress I've ever had was about 10 times better at it then I could ever be and I'm just grateful that I'm not doing it.  The tipping rules vary accordingly to different kinds of services (haircuts, pizza delivery, bellhops), but these other services require adequate tipping as well.  It's the classy thing to do.   There are many, many more who deserve to be on the list and I will continue to add to it periodically.  So those who piss me off, watch your back.

      As a kid I spent most of my summers in the small town of Smackover, Arkansas (hence the user name in my URL, I knew no one else would have it).  Despite it's somewhat exiting name, there was not a whole lot to do in Smackover.  I spent most of my time watching TV (I know, shocking), swimming in the pool, riding in a golf cart, and playing in the library.  My Grandmother was the local high school librarian and while she worked, I would find ways to entertain myself.  I would type on the typewriter, look up random things in the card catalog, and read the illicit Sweet Valley High books.  I just totally dated myself there didn't I?  Anyway, as a result of all those days running around with the whole place to myself, I have a love of books and the library that has been with me even to this day.  Unfortunately many libraries today are facing massive budget cutbacks which are forcing them to eliminate staff and resources as well as stopping the ordering of new books.  To counteract this, many libraries have set up wishlists on  urlLink Amazon.com  where people can donate books online.  Over  urlLink here , Pamie lists different places to donate to the San Diego library system, an area that was devastated by fires last year.  I donated to Oakland last year and felt good about myself for weeks.  And let's face it, I need all the good karma points I can get.  Now I know many of us are poor, and if you can't donate that's cool.  But if you could just post a link to the information on your site or mention it to a friend, then maybe someone who otherwise wouldn't have known about it, will donate something.  And that's worth good karma points, too!  So come on people, no child should be denied the right to visit a  urlLink Chocolate factory   or play  urlLink The Westing Game .

      Looking back at some of my older entries, I realize that I spend a lot of time ranting and complaining about the many annoyances of my life.  I'm ok with that, it works for me, but one might come away with the impression that I'm a huge ball of negativity that shuns joy in favor of the dark and bleak.  While that's not that far from the truth, I do occasionally let a few of rays of sunshine into my cold, dead heart. What is about to follow is a recitation of some of the things that fill me with peace and happiness.  It's  The Anti-List , if you will.  1)Television.  Come on, you knew it was coming.  I could and do watch hours upon hours of TV.  It's an activity I find surprisingly interactive, not just with my equally-obsessed roommate, but with the programming itself.  People who shut off their brains while watching are missing out, because the best shows can make you ponder life's questions while the worst ones can really sharpen your snarking skills.  And you really don't want to let those get rusty.  2)In a related note, TV box sets on DVD.  Seriously, these are like my crack.  I love being able to watch my favorite hours of television any time I want, not being a slave to the scheduling monkeys that program TV content.  The biggest problem with these is that they can be kind of expensive which is an issue when three of tour favorite shows come out with releases within weeks of each other.  3)Bendy Straws.  They satisfy my oral fixation, while being extra fun.  4)Madonna.  I saw her concert a few weeks ago, and it was like being  in church.  In the non-sacrilegious way.  I saw her Drowned World Tour a few years ago, and while I loved every second of it, despite my distaste for large crowds, my one (tiny) complaint was that she didn't sing any of her classic stuff.  So when I heard those first few beats of "Vogue" I nearly teared up.  I was finally about to hear my favorite artist sing live some of my absolute favorite songs.  And with Madonna, you're not just hearing some music, you're seeing a show.  It was so damn entertaining that I think all the dancing that I was doing was the best workout I've had in years.  It was totally worth the astronomical ticket price.  5)My iPod.  It holds my entire music collection onto something smaller than an index card.  That's genius.  Between that, and iTunes, I've barely touched my cd collection in months, except to download more music.  6)The kind of laughter that hurts your stomach and makes you fall to the floor, rolling and gasping for breath because you are guffawing too hard to control your own body.  7)Puzzles.  I'm not sure why, but if you were to get all psychoanalytical on me, you could probably say my love for puzzles stem from the fact that I'm so confused about my own life and future, that figuring out a complex puzzle brings a badly needed sense of control and accomplishment to my life.  Or that they're pretty.  8)Coke.  It's the official soft drink of heaven.  9)The Olympics.  I love watching obscure sporting events that we only even see every four years.  I love the grand pageantry of it all.  I love that it always contains a few upsets and surprises.  I love the hot swimmer boys.  The Olympics basically have just as much drama as anything projected on a movie screen.  10)My friends.  Aww.  Now enough schmaltz.  Go away.

      When we moved into our apartment last summer, we began to notice odd sounds coming from outside our windows at all hours of the day.  An incessant chirping noise could be heard in the early rising of the morning, the darkest depths of night, and anytime in between.  At first it was like, "oh listen to the sounds of nature at work."  Oh it totally wasn't for my roommate and I couldn't give a rat's ass about nature, but at first the noise was tolerable.  Then we discovered the nest that was resting precariously on our front porch.  I guess they figured that those freaky giant creatures can make their homes in entirely wooden structures, why can't we?  I don't why since there are plenty of trees just outside our building, but what can you do?  Anyways, vague tolerance soon turned into sheer annoyance.  A loud cacophony always greeted me at the most inopportune moments.  Trying to go to sleep?  Trying to do homework?  HaHa, think again sucker.  Those stupid birds really made me work and concentrate on whatever it is I wanted to do, and being lazy I naturally resented that.  I know some of you out there are thinking, why not just get rid of the nest?  It's a perfectly valid question, but I had heard somewhere a long time ago that if a mother bird can sense a human smell emitting from her nest, then she won't ever go back to it and her babies will starve to death.  Now I'm just fine with the former result, but I'm no baby killer.  Maybe it's because I read  Are You My Mother?  too many times as a child, but I don't want that kind of guilt (or the ghost of Dr. Seuss) weighing on my conscience.  So we decided to wait them out, and remove the nest after they flew south for the winter.  Yes this would leave them homeless, but we figured it was time for them to find their own damn house, and if that didn't work maybe Habitat for Birdkind would help build them a home that would naturally be filmed for a touching reality show aimed at the feathered set.  The trouble is, as I mentioned before, I'm lazy.  The phrase "out of sight, out of mind" came into play and we forgot all about the sad little pile of sticks that remained on our balcony.  That is, we forgot until a few weeks ago when the first few chirps could be heard, intruding on the quiet peaceful air.  We had missed our very large window of opportunity and are now doomed to another whole summer of us against the birds.  I hope that by the end of the summer the shrieking will not have sent me over the edge, rendering me not responsible for my own actions.  Otherwise those baby birds just might have to learn to find their own damn food.

      I heard on the radio that french fries are now being classified by the FDA as a vegetable.  Hooray!  I can now claim to have vegetables as a regular part of my diet.  Of course they were quick to mention that this classification was for commerce purposes, not nutritional ones.  Whatever, I'll go enjoy my vegetables now.

      More for the list:  6) People (particularly celebrities) who name their kids fucked up names for the sake of being different.  Different is fine.  There are an awful lot of Michaels, Matthews, and Elizabeths out there.  Audio Science is not ok.  Pilot Inspektor is not ok.  Apple and CoCo are not ok.  These kids will have to go their whole lives listening to lame jokes and not being taken seriously as professional adults because they're named after fruit.  Will no one think of the children?  7) Harry.  This is in honor of my favorite roommate and partner in bitchiness,  urlLink Eric .  This ungrateful, unintelligent, slime of a human being had the nerve to berate Eric for doing his job, and giving up his day off to do so, when technically Eric is his superior.  In a store of a bunch of whiners and idiots, congratulations Harry, you were the worst.  We hope that you come down with a very painful and debilitating disease, possibly of the STD variety.

      Let the vicious (verbal) beatings begin!  1) Charles Rubin.  Normally I wouldn't throw a specific (non-celebrity) name out their for all the world and google to read, but this man pissed me off more than any other person who is not my mother ever has before, and I want him to suffer for it.  I want anyone who happens to be searching for him or his stupid book to come across this entry and think twice about giving up even the tiniest portion of their time and/or money towards this rude jackass.  The asshole was an author who was invited by our grossly incompetent area marketing manager to have do an event in our store this past weekend.  His book is directed towards parents dealing with drug-addicted children, which is admirable, but I now believe this man to be too idiotic and insensitive to be helpful at all. He called a few hours beforehand to ask for directions to the store.  Ordinarily that would be perfectly acceptable, but he was coming from over an hour and a half away and was already in the car on his way.  I may be crazy, but when I'm expected at a certain place by a certain time, I look up the exact route online before I leave, just to make sure that I have adequate time to get there and have more than a vague notion how to get there.  Even if for some insane reason you don't have access to the internet, INVEST IN A FUCKING MAP.  Those of us who were there didn't know how to get to our store from his location because it's not like his town enters into our daily routine, or that we have regular customers from there.  I told him how to get to the store once he hit a certain freeway, (which he claimed to know how to get to) and gave him the very simple directions a minimum of six times.  When we couldn't give him the information he wanted, he berated and demeaned us (well mainly me), and from the very beginning his tone was condescendingly rude and spiraled into downright hostility.  I'm sorry that I don't have a GPS system implanted in my brain, but I can't magically pull information out of my ass because you were to fucking lazy to do your responsibility. He called several times and the last time he called he claimed that we kept giving different and conflicting directions.  I either spoke to him, or was standing next to the person who spoke to him at the time, and we gave him the exact same, simple directions that all employees give at least 5 times a day, and they all seem to get to the store ok.  So essentially he either wasn't listening  or flat-out lying, either way not desirable attributes for anyone dealing with the thorny issue of drug addiction.  I have worked in that store for over two years and I know what I am doing.  I am not an incompetent worker like this man said I was, he is an incompetent human being.  If you ever come across this man, I strongly encourage you to give him hell.    2)People who plagiarize others words, or just generally take credit for other people's words.   Since there seems to be some confusion out there,  urlLink dictionary.com  defines the word plagiarize as: 1)To use and pass off (the ideas or writings of another) as one's own. 2)To appropriate for use as one's own passages or ideas from (another). Apparently there has been some confusion about whether or not this is wrong.  I always thought that this was a given and that people who did it just didn't care, but it is without a doubt wrong in every sense of the word.  First of all it is illegal.  I know that in this world of digital information and the internet, regulation and enforcement of an individual's material is next to impossible.  I'm not sure the internet should be regulated, because I think it's one of the last forums for a free exchange of ideas.  But this is not so much about legality, as it is about ethics.  A person, the essence of who he or she is, is made up by that persons thoughts, actions, emotions, and words.  By taking someone else's words you are stealing, yes stealing, a piece of them and misrepresenting who you are.  Also, the act itself of taking someone else's words as your own, is a dishonest and amoral one and reflects poorly on you.  I'm not saying you should never reference the works of others, hell that's what research papers are all about, but it's not to difficult to add the words "written by _______ _______" to any piece.  I'm not using this space to passively aggressively snipe at intended targets, those in question know how I feel about this, I just wanted to more eloquently put together an argument against this heinous act.  As a writer and a (hopefully) moral person, I find the practice of plagiarism both offensive and reprehensible.  3) Everyone responsible for the show "The Swan."  Let's send out the message that physical beauty is the key to happiness and then tell them that they aren't good enough!  Assholes.  4) Giuliana from E!  Just because she annoys me.  5) James Van Der Beek.  Just because.

      The world of computers and technology has been conspiring against me.  In other words my computer has been broken for a few weeks now.  But guess what, it's now fixed!  Now I can do all those things I should be doing like fine-tuning my resume and looking for jobs.  But I'll probably just be reading recaps because I'm lazy and fear change and/or rejection.  I promise content of the more substantial variety soon, but well I'm tired.  Leave me alone.

      I saw my ex-boyfriend Alex this week and the experience was surreal enough to spawn a flurry of introspection. My history with Alex is long and convoluted, and seeing him again, it's hard not to reflect on who we were and who we've both become in the ten years that we've known each other. What first drew me to him was that he saw the world in a way that was so different than anyone else I knew, a way that is so indescribable that it can only be defined as "Alex." I've seen his interests float from ROTC, skateboarding, punk music, Eagle Scouts, computers, and music. He was always looking for adventure and new experiences and seemed to fit in wherever he went. I'm sure it didn't always feel that way to him, but at that time his humor and confidence was exactly what I needed. Unfortunately I was just coming off my first real, long-term relationship, and it would be an understatement to say that it was an unhealthy one. I was very skittish during the course of our relationship and when the opportunity came for my family to move, I pounced on it hungrily. It had nothing to do with Alex, I was extremely unhappy with the rest of my life, but I think he was hurt by my eagerness to leave. Truth be told, I was so scared that I probably would have screwed it up somehow, so it's probably a good thing I left before I could have damaged our friendship as well. The connection has remained and since then we have gotten together several times, but geography, and my own issues, have kept us apart.  Still, every time we talk or every time I know we are about to see each other, my heart skips a beat. I think that maybe something will happen, something that will indicate that passion, that pull that we had together, but for the first time I realized that that's not going to happen. He was playing his music (think Ross on his casio keyboard in  Friends ) in this bizarre hipster San Francisco art gallery/club(soooo not my scene), I realized that we are far too different right now and neither of us has what the other needs right now. Part of me is relieved, I can let this go and Alex doesn't have to be the one that got away. Or more specifically, the one I let get away because I was too wrapped up in my own anxieties and fears. I can love the boy that he was and respect the man that he is now.  The other part of me is nervous. In a way, Alex was an easy answer. He's someone who already knows some of my quirks, my hang-ups, my neuroses. In short, he's someone I've already let in.  And I don't let people in easily.  It's common knowledge that I'm not a big hugger. Or cuddler. Or really very touchy-feely in any sort of way. My aunt once claimed that I have the biggest personal space of anyone she's ever met and she's not wrong. My co-workers call it The Bubble. Anytime a customer or a particularly vile colleague gets to close, they laugh at my visible discomfort and comment on how the bubble has been breached.  But the bubble transcends physicality and surrounds me on an emotional level as well. Something unseen that both separates and protects me from everything and everyone else. In the beginning it was imposed upon me, by both genetics and circumstance. I'm naturally an introvert which is not a comment on whether or not I'm outgoing (although let the record show that I'm not) but how I get my strength. According to my therapist, extroverts gather their energy from being around people, while introverts get it from being alone. Whenever I'm around people, whether they are enjoyable or tiresome, I'm always left drained. So my natural disposition coupled with the fact that for a long time I was an only child whose parents worked a lot, I spent a great deal of time on my own, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Back then the bubble was clear and iridescent, like one freshly blown from the bottle. I could still see and interact with the world, but in my own skewed, beautiful way.  As I grew up the bubble naturally clouded and became harder, tougher. Kids are rough and I've always had what my psychiatrist called a "tender soul" (though I denied it at first). I take things  very  personally and the innate callousness of kids going through puberty forced had me becoming more cautious about who I trust. Gradually I started to gain more confidence and become comfortable in my surroundings.  Then, when I was 15, my world fell apart. The aforementioned unhealthy boyfriend who claimed to love me above all else, turned out to be an obsessive, manipulative, headcase and the rest of my friends abandoned me. I was alone. Most of the time life changes so slowly that you don't realize that things are different, but in one moment that year I knew that I would never be the same again. A heaviness infected my body and heart that day, one that makes it impossible to breathe fully and deeply, one that has yet to completely dissipate nearly ten years later. My anger yelled and screamed, but no one heard. My hurt cried and cut, but no one saw.  And so I rebuilt the bubble until it was hard and opaque; I had learned my lesson. People came and went from my life, some of whom were fun acquaintances, some of whom I considered friends, some of whom were more, but rarely did I let them past the surface level. With each perceived hurt and rejection, the bubble became harder, darker, and heavier. Only once I thought to reach out for help but my cry was dismissed, something I have yet to fully forgive my mother for.  Eventually the bubble became so dark, heavy and oppressive that my world came crashing down on me again. The world was so black that death seemed like the only path to light. And so I took it, or tried to anyway. Needless to say it didn't work, but scared me enough to demand help. The fragile illusion of the healthy, normal person I desperately tried to project was ripped away to expose the mess I had become.  It's been several years and diagnosis since then and I've dealt with or accepted many of my issues, but there are some that I continue to work on. I have great people in my life now, but I rarely let them see the whole me. I don't want to say the real me, because the fun, sarcastic aspect of my personality is just as much a part of me as the scared, pathetic side or the vulnerable, raw side.  But the fun, sarcastic side is a lot more impervious to hurt than the other and I can't completely abandon my bubble. I can't radically change the way that I am just because I don't want to be that way anymore. I need some sort of protection, but I'm not really sure how to not become  too  protected.  I'm coming to a point in my life where I actually kind of want a relationship that goes beyond friendship. There are times where I actually crave the touch of man's fingertips as they brush through my hair, someone to laugh in bed with, or a guy who makes my skin flush and my blood heat. But let's face it, relationships are scary and tough. I think that's why I clung to Alex, or the idea of Alex for so long. He was safe. When you love someone as fully as you can, you let them go farther than anyone else, and the prospect of finding that with some unknown person is daunting to say the least.  Adding to the anxiety is the fact that I have the tendency to see the worst in all of the relationships surrounding me. One the one hand it's smart, because I know what I want to avoid in a relationship, but on the other hand it probably adds to the anxiety.  I'm scared of changing the core of who I am for the sake of compromise. I don't want to lose myself in one person to where I toss away any identity that I ever had and abandon everyone around me in favor of that one person. I'm afraid of being hurt beyond salvation because no one knows how to exploit your vulnerabilities more than someone you love.  Quite simply, I'm scared. And I don't know what to do about it.

      Here is a headline I actually saw on AOL News today:  Poll Shows Americans Against Using Torture. &nbsp; You would think that this would be a gimme, just one of those things that everyone in the world (who is not a super secret spy) knows is bad,&nbsp; like AIDS, famine, or movies based on reality TV phenomena.&nbsp; But no, apparently we need a poll to illustrate the idea that the act of deliberately causing another human being physical or&nbsp;mental distress is not the most upstanding thing to do.&nbsp; apparently not all Americans agree with that though, only a majority do. Since this poll was about the current war in Iraq, I'm guessing that these people who were all cool with torture are probably&nbsp;in no danger of being tortured themselves.&nbsp; Because if they were they'd probably come around to&nbsp;our way of thinking.&nbsp; I mean if&nbsp;you think torture is a dandy way&nbsp;to pass the time then fine, that's your perogative.&nbsp; But you have to believe in torture for everyone, because otherwise you're just a&nbsp;big hypocrite.&nbsp;

      I just wanted to let y'all know that  urlLink Ineffectual Whore  is up and running.  Yay!  It's a little side project that  urlLink Eric  and I are doing and if you want to know what it's all about, well then you'll just have to see for yourself.  Now.    No, seriously, go now.  I'll wait right here.

      So I was doing RPL in the cult classics dvd section at work today and I think that I may have come across the most awesome movie of all time:  urlLink Jesus Christ: Vampire Hunter .  So Jesus comes back to Earth for his second coming and finds the world overrun by bloodsucking fiends from beyond the grave, who are conveniently impervious to sunlight (I have a feeling this is just because the "auteurs" couldn't afford night shoots).  So before he can get to his preaching, healing, and making entire gourmet meals from the meager contents of my refrigerator, he must kick some undead ass.  Don't worry though, he doesn't have to do it alone.  Oh no, he has Mexican wrestling star "El Santos" to help him. And if dealing with Biblical prophesy and killer bloodsuckers weren't enough, Jesus also has to cope with ever-changing sexual politics.  The best part: it's a  musical !  I'm seriously considering buying this movie.

      I just took the quiz from J.B.'s site and apparently:  You are a WEDL--Wacky Emotional Destructive Leader. This makes you an anarchist. You don't give a damn. When push comes to shove, you just forget about it--it's just not worth the heartache. What this means for others is that dealing with you can be aggravating, because they find they can't get you motivated about things they care about. What this means for you is that you are happier, calmer, and saner then they are on their best days.  You are near-immune to criticism, and those who know you well acknowledge and respect that. You may come across as lazy, but the truth is that you find little to get worked up about. Regardless, you have slews of friends, because they are fascinated by your world view, jealous of your lifestyle, and drawn to the fact that you are hilarious to be around.   You are a pillar in a sea of hot-bloodedness. You have a sweet tooth.   Umm.  No.  Well I have a sweet tooth, but I think everything else about that is wrong, wrong, wrong.  A test online couldn't describe my personality accurately?  I'm shocked, SHOCKED I tell you.
