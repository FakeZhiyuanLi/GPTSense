      This ushers a new start for me to read into my mind & intuitions. And as they say, "the most interesting thought is the one you tell someone close, and you never knew that you knew it." Will keep posting.

      Value Education is where future is!  While surfing on the net I came across this website www.valueducation.com . Subsequently I thought is it where the future education lies atleast partly, if not totally? As the Kaliyuga enters its pinnacle, the moral degradation will become rampant.  Skills, talents & education will more or less standardize. Then the key differentiator will be the MQ (Morality Quotient). Even today in our day-to-day life we see less qualified (skillful) but highly ethical & high-moral professionals being preferred over highly qualified but with unfaithful traits. So to me it indicates sort of an opportunity. Simova Course Material has a brief mention about such careers as Moral Counselor & the likes. Overall, its in ones self-interest to inculcate high MQ in ourselves and the coming generation.

      This time something on human existence. As I grew up, I was told, Almighty has laid down 4 four objects of human existence.  1. Dharma-Religion 2. Arth-Luxuries 3. Kama-Carnal Pleasures 4. Moksha-Salvation  Through our lives, we realise that for perfect happiness, these four has to be balanced. We actually, intentionally or otherwise, do strive for this. Let’s see;                    Religion, in Swami Vivekananda’s words, ‘is a way of life.’ With certain set of rules, liberties, responsibilities and goals. Remember, its just the journey and not the destination. Journey is more important than the destination, said the Father of the Nation. ‘Means means more than the end itself.’                     What we in our life in the Kaliyuga do is a updated version of religion. It’s not about doing any of the above. All of them are complimentary. As a smart, evolved human being we have found our ‘way of life’. We worship, pray, donate, do social work, regret our sins…& with each passing day we are finding newer ways around it. All the unethical things we do in our professional lives we try to set them off against a new found sutra called Practicality. Everything passes under this bridge. The trickle down effect of this is that we get untrue to ourselves, near ones and the ones we claim are of our belonging...to be continued

      Here are some of the musings...ohhh...chalo let me say...these are a few thoughts that caught my attention in last few weeks of reading. So here's a part of it...!   * Believe everything, trust nothing. * Four evils, Ego, Envy, Greed & Ambition. * Important ‘E’s of life: Ethics, Excellence, Efficiency, Equity, Environment & Education (Life-Long Learning). * Compassion is the cardinal sin of modern life. It traps us in a game that we cant win. Ones we define ourselves in terms of others we lose the freedom to shape our lives. * Data-Information-Knowledge- Wisdom- Enlightenment- Salvation * People can’t be taught, they learn. People can’t be changed, they change when they are ready to change. * Excellence, Contribution & Meaning are the principles of teamwork. * Life is a toilet paper. The closer it gets to end, the faster it ends. * Trying to teach management to someone who has never managed is like trying to teach psychology to someone who has never met another human being. The dangerous people is this hyped-up society are, those whose confidence exceeds their competence. These are the people who drive everyone crazy. MBA programs not only attract significant number of such people, but encourage their tendencies. Management is a difficult, uncertain business. What people learn as they manage is how little they know.  * Peak of success is precisely the time to change. *Unfortunately no system in life allows you to sample it fully before committing to it.

      Allow me to say, Well Done Sonia! What else can you expect from an Italian women who as a teenager (more than 3 decades back) had the conviction to marry an Indian, while being in constant public eye. With all those hard times adjusting herself to India & People. Swimming against the tide! Thats what you can call. Now she has showed that courage again, with much more maturity.  On the other hand, i think the BJP (& likeminded) are not loosing as it seems. Atleast now they can thumpingly claim that they had raised a valid point, now endorsed by 'Madam Soniaji'.  During all that Media festival of polls & post polls show, i came across this discussion between a cong man and a BJPian. "It was Atalji Vs ? or --" . Congman replied, "...so the results are for everyone to see, Indians voted for a ? or -- than voting for Atalji. They voted for anybody but Atalji...!!!"Now isnt that being poll-itically correct.

      Its not recently that I have realised that the prime reason behind globalisation is a simple marketing logic, rather than any socio-economic one. Let me take you back to the 1980’s when advertising & marketing as a functions were at their zenith and every Tom Dick & Harry had a say on anything and everything on marketing. Remember this was after the industrialisation revolution in the developed nations. The MNCs soon realised that it was getting costlier and difficult to advertise and market their products around the globe. The cost of customisation of products and communication for each and every country (in India’s  case, for every region, state) was killing the margins. Off course the developing nations were no doubt potentially volume oriented markets, but then they weren’t ready for it given their cultural, economical and psychological criterion. This was a huge gift of opportunities but wrapped in the hard packing paper of global socio-cultural diversities.  What to do…?  Someone came up with this noble solution. “All the problem arises because each consumer who busy our product/service is very broadly different from the other, even within the same SEC, Country or Culture. So why not do something that all the world (our current & potential consumers) are dragged, lured, aspired, trapped, invited, compelled, seduced (by hook or by crook) into us”. Hmmm…did you say Eureka!!!   Idea? Ready. Implementation? Not quite. So how do you go about it.  The various social researches carried out, showed that people (atleast young ones) develop, grasp their culture from films, media & books. So started the race to start a Global news channel (CNN, Fox, ABC etc for the uninitiated). Their brief? Try & show all the products that our manufacturers can produce. Prove it to the public that whatever we show is ‘IN’ and Hep. Generate aspirational value to it. Make it as desirable as possible. Let it be clear that if you are not like what we show you, then you are outlandish, outclass, dumb & good-for-nothing. It was the same with the movies. Or why else is it that only after late 80’s foreign movies were released worldwide, with cheap alternatives as Video Cassettes, VCDs, DVDs also readily available in small towns with vernacular versions. The books, especially pulp fiction & novels portrayed the decided image, aroma of the characters and the story. Popular music was substituted for rock and western classical, as it was more suited to the developing world population. All this are now within themselves a very evolved and progressive industries. Something that was to be used as a rocket launcher, itself is now a revolves around the mankind as if a satellite. Many such instances can be very easily traced out, to prove the point.   Let is be clear that I am not trying to decimate globalisation as a trend. I just want to convey the ulterior motive behind the Globalisation Crusader’s seemingly eternal campaign.

      Languages have always been a foundation stone of any human civilization in any era. It’s a very crucial tool of communication and expressionism. Without which the castle of civilized societies will fall down like nine pins. Looking at the current scenario and the pitiful state of many regional languages world over it seems as if a huge turmoil of human society is in the offing. To put it in figures, a 100 years back we had around 15000 languages and dialects that were being spoken on the globe.  This figure has now shrunk to 6000-7000.                            History is witness. The societies & cultures that lost their languages, started their downfall, the beginning of their end. Lebanon, Ukraine, East African Countries, many other cultures have got wiped out and it all started when they confiscated their native/mother tongue.                              The degeneration of these dialects and languages also results in lesser diversity of the mankind. Diversity is what the makes humanity progress. The farce of One World One Family, is true only till all the societies on the globe are allowed to survive and live complimentarily. If one tries to force one language on the earth, believe me , we are in a for a disaster. My favourite example to explain this is China. Maoists, although forcefully, pressed hard on the public to use and communicate in Chinese. The education, communication, TV, computers, advertising, everything is in Chinese. No wonder, China has the bonus of having a educated and yet very honest and passionate workforce.                            So what is the solution? Youth. The answer. As a society we must keep the aspirational values of the language intact and may be nurture it. The rest care for culture will be taken care of. So praise your language and try to make it as desirable for the young ones. After all this is least you can gift them, a language a culture of their own.

      Unlearning: An Art. A Science. Ctrl ‘Z’ Education. “Education is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that’s is worth knowing can be taught.”  -Oscar Wilde, Irish Playwright, poet & wit (1854-1900). If this was true then, its truer now. Today’s youth, more than their predecessors is feeling &amp; reeling under the devastating effect of modern civilizations biggest blunder, EDUCATION. I have always had that intense tussle in my mind, why education & not learning? Why one has to go through a education system rather than a learning process? Above all what’s the difference between them? Just have a look at the products &amp; by-products of education per se.  Employability. The society has come to a stage where we divert, nurture & produce our brightest brains to do the most useless job. So we have the best marketing managers working their souls out at selling good-for-nothing colas. The shrewdest brains are either selling a sanitary napkin or a soap or at the most a car. Sheer agony that, half the living humans still wait to drink potable water. We have as much food sufficient to feed population of three earths, but in reality 2 billion people sleep with empty tummy for the want of food. All because there are no facilitators.  This when the world over defence vacancies are at their peak. The number of entrepreneurs is falling. Musicians are a endangered species. The educated/learned society looks down to the jobs like carpenters, plumbers, gardeners, milkman, farmer, potter, tailor, puppeteer, &amp; their cousins. So in Canada, a call centre geek earns around US $4-5 per hour, while a carpenter putting in an hour gets around US $ 7-8, that’s if you are lucky enough to get one in first place. Attitude. Humanity’s greatest gift of Individuality is lost somewhere, as we go on mass producing/educating people who have similar competencies, when each one is meant to be different. Like in factory production all the products are identical &amp; have similar fate in the globalized market. So, its like having 11 batsmen or 11 bowlers in a cricket team, that too with similar capacities.  More thoughts are coming soon…watch out…!

       The product of the sums of any nation cannot be the criterion of our judgement of that nation. one may collect the rotten, worm-eaten apples under every apple tree in the world & write a book about each of them &amp; still know nothing of the beauty & possibilities of the apple tree. Only in the highest &amp; the best can we judge a nation- the fallen are a race by themselves. Thus it is not only proper, but just & right to judge a custom, person, culture, concept, ideology &amp; their cousins, by its ideal. &nbsp;&nbsp; By Swami Vivekananda.

      I came across this nice paragraph while reading a book on Vedanta. I think, the example is very explanatory & thought provoking. “Your ignorance keeps you in the spiritual darkness. When a room is plunged in darkness you are bound to strike against cornices & corners, against niches & notches, against fittings & furniture, against anything in your way & injure yourself. You may rearrange the furniture in the room, you may make the walls straight & smooth, you will still get knocked in the dark. So long as the darkness remains in the room you are certain to suffer breakage & damage. Instead of reorganising the room bring the light into it; let things lie as they are, the light will provide you with smooth & easy passage. You will have nothing to worry thereafter.”  For the uninitiated, these lines talk about the room of your conscience, your inner-self. The furniture that it mentions are the people, situations, experiences, problems, responsibilities, resources etc in your life. All your life you are busy arranging, in the best way, this set of tangibles & intangibles of life. It seems that more often than it succeeds. But then for how long? Only till there’s a addition or subtraction to this set.  So this is where you need the light of the knowledge of self. For that the existence of self should be acknowledged.  The light that we are talking of is the light of realisation. Of the eternal fact that we are here with a definite purpose, a goal. And then all of a sudden everything s seems to so clear & unobtrusive. You tend to be the master of the room of life. The unchallenged, eternal master.

        This Story was emailed to me by Priyanka. And I thought this is best one I have received for a long time.   Two men, both seriously ill, occupied the same hospital room. One man was allowed to sit up in his bed for an hour each afternoon to help drain the fluid from his lungs. His bed was next to the room's only window. The other man had to spend all his time flat on his back. The men talked for hours on end. They spoke of their wives and families, their homes, their jobs, their involvement in the military service, where they had been on vacation. Every afternoon when the man in the bed by the window could sit up, he would pass the time by describing to his roommate all the things he could see outside the window. The man in the other bed began to live for those one-hour periods where his world would be broadened and enlivened by all the activity and color of the world outside. The window overlooked a park with a lovely lake. Ducks and swans played on the water while children sailed their model boats. Young lovers walked arm in arm amidst flowers of every color and a fine view of the city skyline could be seen in the distance. As the man by the window described all this in exquisite detail, the man on the other side of the room would close his eyes and imagine the picturesque scene. One warm afternoon the man by the window described a parade passing by. Although the other man couldn't hear the band - he could see it. In his mind's eye as the gentleman by the window portrayed it with descriptive words. Days and weeks passed. One morning, the day nurse arrived to bring water for their baths only to find the lifeless body of the man by the window, who had died peacefully in his sleep. She was saddened and called the hospital attendants to take the body away. As soon as it seemed appropriate, the other man asked if he could be moved next to the window. The nurse was happy to make the switch, and after making sure he was comfortable, she left him alone. Slowly, painfully, he propped himself up on one elbow to take his first look at the real world outside. He strained to slowly turn to look out the window beside the bed. It faced a blank wall. The man asked the nurse what could have compelled his deceased roommate who had described such wonderful things outside this window. The nurse responded that the man was blind and could not even see the wall. She said, "Perhaps he just wanted to encourage you." Epilogue: "There is tremendous happiness in making others happy, despite our own situations" "Shared grief is half the sorrow, but happiness when shared, is doubled" "If you want to feel rich, just count all the things you have that money can't buy" "Today is a gift, that's why it is called the present." in the end, ask yourself if you are "AS GOOD AT IMPARTING HAPPINESS AS YOU ARE AT RECIEVING IT" {Courtsey: Priyanka}
