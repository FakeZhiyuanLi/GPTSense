      Weekend was great!  Felix can stand up unassisted now (for about 2 seconds). He puts his hands over his head when he does this... just like a champion! he expects to be applauded when he stands up or when he throws balls.  Im up in Tamworth again next weekend where we will be concentrating on bike riding and pram-pushing skills!  Have fun.

      This is mine: I'm the year of the DOG:

Someone may try telling you cock-and-bull stories so as to influence and exploit you. Don't be too credulous, especially if someone asks you for a helping hand or for a loan. At work, delays and annoyances will get on your nerves; nevertheless, try to control yourself. Differences of opinion with one of your best friends. Perhaps it'd time to go to your dentist's for a cleaning.

      Anyone who knows me well enough will know (with a little thought) what this day previously meant to me. Its funny how something that means everything to you can fall to nothingness in less than two years. Sometimes that two years seems like the longest time in the world and at other times it seems like i just blinked and ended up here. 

I feel so much better for having endured what I have. Would I wish it on anyone? on my worst enemy (if I had one)?... no... But I have learnt that I have a strength that can see me through the darkest days. Nothing is worse than this. I can survive *anything*.

Were it not for this day, Felix would not be here. He means the world to me and I would endure anything for him. I will never give up on him. He makes life all the more sweeter and the precious hours I have with him linger in my heart always. He cant know what strength he has given me but I know that I owe him the world and I am going to be the best damn Dad I can be for him! He will grow to love his Dad, and more importantly, my one hope is that he will grow to *like* his Dad.

Lastly, I'd like to give thanks to Alanis Morissette... if I couldnt scream out along with her in my car I just dont know where I would have eneded up. And on that note... I'll keep it short and sweet and leave you with these thoughts. 

Thanks Alanis xxx

      Why cant we "Rock" at work. Rock stars are the only people who, when they do their job correctly get rewarded by getting womens panties thrown at them or huge pyrotechnic explosions.

I want to change this. 

Girls, next time you get a really good latte at Starbucks (or similar), rip off your panties and throw them at the guy who just serverd you. I bet you next time you walk in, he will have a perfect latte already waiting for you.

Guys, wouldnt it be great to add a bit of pizazz into your work day with pyrotechnics!? It would justify doing that boring board report when, as you handed it over to your boss and said "Heres the report you asked for..." a HUGE blast of pyrotechnics shot into the air and you slid across the floor playing air guitar.

Lets do it. Lets ROCK at work.

"The Ballad of Casey Macphee"

Narrator: Listen, while I tell you, a story old and true,
about how Casey Macphee the engineer got his train through.
He faced the toughest duty, an engineer could do,
but he was brave and not afraid and he got his train through!

(chorus) Through, through, through, he got the train through.
Through, through, through....

Cookie: Me got the train, and get it through.....

N: Train was carrying moo cows, and cake and ice cream too.
There were six cars full of cookies, and a tank of chocolate too.
The stuff was for the party, that the kids would have all year.
And getting that train through the narrow pass was the job of the engineer!

(CHORUS)

C (spoken): Oh, this train full of stuff me love to eat.
And there are lote of children waiting for stuff
on other side of dangerous narrow pass.
Me must get train through!!!!!

N: But an avalanche had closed the track and covered it with snow.
The snow was deep, the track was blocked, there was no place he could go.
Casey knew the train was filled with things he loved to eat.
But Casey knew his duty and would not admit defeat!

(CHORUS)

C (spoken): Oh, tough choice. Track covered with snow.
If me stay here, and not try to go through pass,
Me stuck here, all alone with six cars of cookies and ice cream.
Aaaaaaaaallllll alone, with nooooooooobody watching.
Me getting hungry. Me getting VERY hungry!
Oooooooh, maybe it's not too bad if me eat some cookies...
Wait!! What me doing???? It be very bad if me eat cookies.
Me must get train through!!!!!

N: Well, Casey was a hero. And his duty he could see.
Without the cookies and the milk, no party could there be.
The kids would be unhappy,
So Casey raised his head.......

C: Me forget about the cookies,
AND EAT THE SNOW INSTEAD!!!!!

N: Through, through, through, he got the train through,
he ate up all the avalanche....

C: It mighty tasty too!

N: Through, through, through, he got the train through.
Casey that brave engineer got the train through!

      I just thought I'd share a little part of my day with you and hopefully
pass on some wisdom.

THE SCENARIO:

I came in this morning and had a chat with a certain sales person whose
name starts with "M" and ends with "ike Hargis". We chatted about his
recent trip to Canberra and how cold it was. This unnamed salesperson was
eating a muffin, thickly coated in Apricot Jam. I thought nothing of it at
the time and went to make my breakfast.

I put some toast on and went to the fridge to get my jam out. Then it
struck me, "There is only one lot of jam in here...MINE!". I grabbed the
jam and was further disappointed to find that not only was the jar ajar :)
but jam was spilled on the side of the jar and was now all over my fingers.
Tops! >:-|

THE CONFRONTATION:

When I confronted Mike... errr... the salesperson, he simply laughed it off
lightly and explained how he had lost all of his morals in Canberra. This
shattered me... how could he simply shrug me off like that! That was not
just ANY jam, that was MY jam. I defined myself by that jam... He had
stolen my identity, the one true thing that made me... well...me. After
all, you are what you eat. ;-)

THE MORAL:

"You can take the Salesperson out of the city but you cant take the
Salesperson out of the person"

THE WARNING:

Be alert, not alarmed. A salesperson may be lurking anywhere. They may even
look just like you and me (but they probably dress a little snappier). From
this day forth no jam is safe. Only with diligent resolve will we crush the
onslaught of our pectin pilfering protagonists!

Current drivers championship leader Loeb and double world champion Gronholm have been at it hammer-and tongs in a ding-dong battle for the overall honours that saw the lead change hands twice today in quick succession. &nbsp; urlLink

      Holy crap!

Peter and I came 6th in the Paddy Pallin Rogaine on the weekend! That was *way* above my expectations however I was pretty close to collapsing afterwards.

I had 5 hours sleep the night before and crap take away for dinner as I moved house that day. I packed the car at 5am and was lucky enough that the only thing I forgot was a nice dry pair of shoes for apres event. 

Seriously, it was sooo much fun. Peter and I were (reasonably) well matched. he is fitter than me and a *much* better navigator but we managed to stay together with no bickering.

My true team spirit shone through at one stage when we were navigating a particularly dangerous rocky descent. I was in front (under) Peter when I heard him slipping... I instantly let fly with "Dont you fall on me!". Great team spirit! ;-)

The day was awesome and the result a great bonus. Cant wait for the next one... 12hrs at Lake Macquarie... Ill keep you posted.

      Well, 

I shoved a bunch of stuff in my house and decided to sort it out some other time. I found that I have too much of the stuff I dont need (like 5 platters for example) and not enough of the stuff I do need (like no dinner set for example). So If you come to my house for dinner expect to be served dinner on a massive platter!

But seriously, it is great to be in my own place. I am *very* thankful for Conrad and Fionas generosity but there is nothing like your own place.

The fish, which is a kind of chimaera, or ratfish, is about 12 inches to 16 inches (30cm to 40cm) long, has large, wing-like fins, a whip-like tail and exposed nerves along its body that help it navigate in the deep, dark waters where it lives.&nbsp; urlLink

      Another good day for Garingal with 4 wins from 6.  Division 1 had another 
win and remain undefeated.   All other teams have now each won one of two 
matches.  In Division 4 the Orange team had a very narrow 28-27 loss to 
KNOX (the result was exactly the same as in Round 1 when the Green team 
took on KNOX).

Some good runs were recorded with Chris Baker less than 2 minutes behind 
the fastest in Division 1 and Paul Heiskanen only 30 seconds off the 
fastest time in Division 3.   It was good to have a few new people come 
along and get a run in MetroLeague for the first time - hope you enjoyed 
the experience and will come back for more.

Round 3 of MetrOLeague will be on Sunday 27 June at Lapstone (full details 
to come).

      Ok, so the world is over... Medical Rookies is a new "reality" TV show that documents medical "professionals" on their first few days at work. Basically, the deal is that you watch the show in the hope that something will go "horribly wrong". Sort of like watching car races for the crashes. Lets not forget that the people on the slab (unlike racecar drivers) most likely have no training and certainly dont have roll-cages. These are human beings and we watch hoping they will suffer... and thats fucked.

In the last year wine sellers and their willing accomplices in the medical and news media fields have tried to sell us on drinking wine as a way to help our hearts.

Those in the Prohibition Party and other temperance groups immediately said that any benefits in wine would come from the grapes, not from ethyl alcohol which is a poison.

Now a new study has appeared in most newspapers which shows that we were right. Note especially that the benefit of grape juice is about 66% greater than that of wine without the harm caused by ethyl alcohol.

As we have noted before there are a number of insurance companies which offer lower rates to abstainers. None offer lower rates to drinkers.

They know the bottom line financially and realize that alcohol users die earlier and have more illnesses than abstainers. The information on this new study follows:

Toasting the day with a glass of grape juice may be an especially good start for the heart.

A study found that 8 or 10 ounces a day of the purple variety has a potent effect on the blood cells called platelets, making them less likely to form clots than can lead to heart attacks.

In fact, purple grape juice might be even more potent than aspirin, which is widely recommended as a way of warding off heart attacks.

The researchers compared grape juice with orange and grapefruit juice and came to the conclusion that grape juice is better, at least for the heart.

The study was led by Dr. John D. Folts of the University of Wisconsin Medical School. His research has been funded for several years by the Nutricia Research Foundation of the Netherlands and the Oscar Rennebohm Foundation of Madison, Wisconsin and more recently by Welch's, which makes grape juice.

Folts noted that 10 companies make purple grape juice in the United States, and all probably work equally well.

Purple juice appears to be more potent than white, Folts said.

Heart attacks occur when blood clots stick to fatty deposits on the walls of the heart's arteries, choking the supply of blood.

Folts presented his latest findings recently at a conference of the American College of Cardiology.

Experimenting on 17 volunteers, himself included, Folts found that both aspirin and red wine slow the activity of blood platelets by about 45 percent, while purple grape juice dampens them by about 75 percent.

"His data are very convincing," said Dr. Arthur L. Klatsky of Kaiser Permanent Medical Center in Oakland, Calif., who studies the benefits of alcohol on the heart.

      Gday,

MTBO Cessnock was ok... there was *heaps* of sand and my tyre selection was too aggressive for those conditions. I finished about 6th but only narrowly... 4th and 5th and 6th were only 2 minutes apart!

I made several navigational errors and had one off. Checkpoint 8 was the biggest waste of time as I did a parallel error and ended up at the wrong track junction.

It was a good day in any case! Goos to see my times encroaching on the "big boys"...

The image shows the sunlit side of Saturn's rings.

      This is a true story about a recent wedding that took place at Sydney University. It was in the local newspaper and even Alan Jones mentioned it.  It was a huge wedding with about 300 guests.   After the wedding at the reception, the groom got up on stage with a microphone to talk to the crowd. He said he wanted to thank everyone for coming, many from long distances, to support them at their wedding. He especially wanted to thank the bride's and his family and to thank his new father-in-law for providing such a lavish reception. As a token of his deep appreciation he said he wanted to give everyone a special gift just from him.   So taped to the bottom of everyone's chair, including the wedding party, was a manila envelope. He said this was his gift to everyone, and asked them to open their envelope.   Inside each manila envelope was an 8x10 glossy of his bride having sex with the best man. The groom had gotten suspicious of them weeks earlier and had hired a private detective to tail them.   After just standing there, just watching the guests' reactions for a couple of minutes, he turned to the best man and said, "F--- you!". Then he turned to his bride and said "F--- you!". Then he turned to the dumbfounded crowd and said, "I'm outta here."   He had the marriage annulled first thing in the morning. While most people would have canceled the wedding immediately after finding out about the affair, this guy goes through with the charade, as if nothing were wrong.   His revenge...making the bride's parents pay over $32,000 for a 300 guest wedding an reception,and best of all, trashing the bride's and best man's reputations in front of 300 friends and family members. This guy has balls the size of church bells.   Do you think we might get a MasterCard "priceless" commercial out of this?   Elegant wedding reception for 300 family members and friends......................................................$32,000.  Wedding photographs commemorating the occasion........................................................................$3,000.  Deluxe two week honeymoon accommodations in Maui...................................................................$8,500.  The look on everyone's face when they see the 8x10 glossy of the bride humping the best man..Priceless.   There are some things money can't buy, for everything else there's MASTERCARD.

      The Death of Common Sense.   Today we mourn the passing of a  beloved old friend, by the name of Common Sense, who has been with us for many  years. No one knows for sure how old he was since his birth records were long  ago lost in bureaucratic red tape.  He will be remembered as having  cultivated such valued lessons as knowing when to come in out of the rain, why  the early bird gets the worm, when not to be silly and that life isn't always fair.  Common Sense lived by simple, sound  financial policies (don't spend more than you earn) and reliable parenting  strategies (adults, not kids, are in charge). His health began to rapidly  deteriorate when well-intentioned but overbearing regulations were set in place.  Reports of a six-year-old boy charged  with sexual harassment for kissing a classmate, teens suspended from school for  using mouthwash after lunch, and a teacher fired for reprimanding an unruly  student only worsened his condition.  It declined even further when schools  were required to get parental consent to administer aspirin to a student but  could not inform the parents when a student became pregnant and wanted to have  an abortion.  Finally, Common sense lost the will to  live as the Ten Commandments became contraband, churches became businesses and  criminals received better treatment than their victims.  Common Sense finally gave up the ghost  after athletes and CEOs salaries increased to between 9 thousand and 90 thousand  dollars per HOUR, and a woman failed to realize that a steaming cup of coffee  was hot, spilled it in her lap, and was awarded a huge settlement for simply  being stupid.  Common Sense was preceded in death by  his parents, Truth and Trust, his wife, Discretion; his daughter,  Responsibility; and his son, Reason.   He is survived by two stepbrothers; My  Rights and Ima Whiner.  Not many attended his funeral because so few realized he was gone.  If you remember him pass this on, if  not he will be forgotten.

      Truly scary and frightening the person you described. &nbsp;I believe the only thing I can do is ring Van Helsing, and search for the culprit would callously stole the few drips of jam.        Van Helsing would, I know, do anything for me for a personal reason, so no matter on what ground he comes, we must accept his wishes. He is a seemingly arbitrary man, but this is because he knows what he is talking about better than any one else. He is a philosopher and a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of his day; and he has, I believe, an absolutely open mind. This, with an iron nerve, a temper of the ice-brook, an indomitable resolution, self-command, and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings, and the kindliest and truest heart that beats--these form his equipment for the noble work that he is doing for mankind--work both in theory and practice, for his views are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy. I tell you these facts that you may know why I have such confidence in him.     --from Dr. John Seward's letter to Arthur Holmwood,  Dracula  &nbsp;    EDIT: Thanks MH for such a hellish reply!

       I just thought I'd share a little part of my day with you and hopefully  pass on some wisdom.  THE SCENARIO:  I came in this morning and had a chat with a certain sales person whose  name starts with "M" and ends with "ike Hargis". We chatted about his  recent trip to Canberra and how cold it was. This unnamed salesperson was  eating a muffin, thickly coated in Apricot Jam. I thought nothing of it at  the time and went to make my breakfast.  I put some toast on and went to the fridge to get my jam out. Then it  struck me, "There is only one lot of jam in here...MINE!". I grabbed the  jam and was further disappointed to find that not only was the jar ajar :)  but jam was spilled on the side of the jar and was now all over my fingers.  Tops! >:-|  THE CONFRONTATION:  When I confronted Mike... errr... the salesperson, he simply laughed it off  lightly and explained how he had lost all of his morals in Canberra. This  shattered me... how could he simply shrug me off like that! That was not  just ANY jam, that was MY jam. I defined myself by that jam...

      well.. i supposed this is the first post out of work and from my folks' home in melbourne suburbia...  my little brother (Vexz) had been complaining to me that his 'puter crashes every so often and over the weekend i discovered why... the damn bloody mob that sold him the 'puter had not one single case fan!!!!  anyway, i went with Vexz to a "you have to pay to get in" computer market in box hill townhall... there was heaps loads of people. Got one of those coolermaster blue LED 80mm case fans with a noise level of 20dBA, 50 blank CDs and 6 ink cartridges for his portfolio.  So, the computer is running fine, now I gotta get back to Syd to fix my one @ home *sigh*  I was close to buying one of those MSI megastick yesterday, but i didn't.. Pras sent  urlLink this  in. It plays real media apparently, I'll give it a go when I get home. He also advised me that there's this  urlLink uPC  which probably cost a bucket load of dough  :)  Here's an article on  urlLink free & open source software . Not a bad one if you don't have enough dough to fill up those precious HDD space.  IBM is been  urlLink sued  for dealing with the Nazi government.  I reckon these  urlLink USB external TV tuner  will be the next addition to most of the PCs. I myself have already got an internal one. Great thing about it is that you record your favourite show without the use of VCR tapes  :)

      1. People who point at their wrist while asking for the time....I know where my watch is pal, where the f*ck is yours? Do I point at my crotch when I ask where the toilet is?  2. People who are willing to get off their arse to search the entire room for the TV remote because they refuse to walk to the TV and change the channel manually.  3. When people say "Oh you just want to have your cake and eat it  too". F*cking right! What good is a cake if you can't eat it?  4. When people say "it's always the last place you look". Of course it is. Why the f*ck would you keep looking after you've found it? Do people do this? Who and where are they?  5. When people say while watching a film "did you see that?". No tosser, I paid 10 quid to come to the cinema and stare at the f*cking floor.  6. People who ask "Can I ask you a question?. Didn't really give me a choice there, did you sunshine?  7. When something is 'new and improved!'. Which is it? If it's new, then there has never been anything before it. If it's an improvement, then there must have been something before it.  8. When people say "life is short". What the f*ck?? Life is the longest damn thing anyone ever f*cking does!! What can you do that's longer?  9. When you are waiting for the bus and someone asks, "Has the bus come yet?. If the bus came would I be standing here, Knob head?  10. People who say things like 'My eyes aren't what they used to be'. So what did they used to be? ears, Wellington boots?  11. When you're eating something and someone asks 'Is that nice?' No it's really revolting - I always eat stuff I hate.  12. People who announce they are going to the toilet. Thanks that's an image I really didn't need.  13. McDonalds staff who pretend they don't understand you if you don't insert the 'Mc' before the item you are ordering..... It has to be a McChicken Burger, just a Chicken Burger gets blank looks. Well I'll have a McStraw and jam it in your McEyes you f*cking McTosser.   Man, do I feel like that most of the time!

      First-year students at Med School were receiving their first anatomy class with a real dead human body. They all gathered around the surgery table with the body covered with a white sheet. The professor started the class by telling them, "In medicine, it is necessary to have 2 important qualities as a doctor: The first is that you not be disgusted by anything involving the human body." For an example, the Professor pulled back the sheet,stuck his finger in the butt of the corpse, withdrew it and stuck it in his mouth. "Go ahead and do the same thing," he told his students. The students freaked out, hesitated for several minutes, but eventually took turns sticking a finger in the butt of the dead body and licking on it. When everyone finished, the Professor looked at them and said: "The second most important quality is observation. I stuck in my middle ! finger and licked on my index finger. Now learn to pay attention." LOL!!!

You know *THE* truth: 2+2=5 regardless of what those mathematicians say... after all they work for the man, and they're after you to keep you silenced.  You wear the black asshat of Truth.    urlLink   What kind of asshat are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    what  urlLink USB crap  is this?!?!  An all-in-one  urlLink with  cheese!   urlLink Kilimanjaro .  The  urlLink humour  site.

      greetings from KL, malaysia  i didn't get a chance to check out any links.. however KL has been great! The weather ain't too hot.  The country wide shopping carnival just started in KL and will last till end of September.&nbsp; I haven't bought anything myself.. been tempted however.  I've extended my stay in KL till the 15/08 due to my cousin's wedding on 13/08 and a couple of days recovery.  Anyway, please post comments here, rather than email me.. much easier if everything is in one place! :)

      wow.. can't believed that I've been away from blogging that long.. nearly two weeks.. well I couldn't help it.. the computer at home broke down and i had to rebuild it...  to cut the story short.. now I've got two computers @ home. My old one with a new motherboard and new RAM. And the new one is an Intel 2.8GHz. with 1GB of RAM.  I shuffled the HDD and the add-on cards around to give the new PC abit more grunt, as both motherboards have some features built-in.  Am currently configuring XP onto the Intel PC. and making sure everything is in good working order before I leave the country. You know what women can be like  ;)  Onto the bits... which incidently haven't been that many...  An ex-Altavista employee caught for  urlLink stealing source code  then implementing it for MSN Search.  A security vulnerability is affecting  urlLink Mozilla's browser . More  urlLink here .  Here's a new lot of  urlLink Fibre-enabled  housing estate in the Gold Coast. yummy!  OK, I better start packing~ whilst XP is configuring itself.  EDIT: I felt that I needed to add  urlLink this , just for Chris.  OK.. someone sent me the following perspective  :)   When you have an "I Hate My Job" day, try this.  On your way home from work, stop at your pharmacy, go to the thermometer section and purchase a rectal thermometer made by *Johnson & Johnson. (*Be very sure you get this brand.)  When you get home, lock your doors, draw the curtains and disconnect the phone so you will not be disturbed. Change into very comfortable clothing and sit in your favourite chair, open the package and remove the thermometer. Carefully place it on a table or other surface, so that it will not become chipped or broken. Now the fun part begins...  Take out the literature and read it carefully. You will notice that in small print there is this statement, "Every rectal thermometer made by *Johnson & Johnson is personally tested".  Now, close your eyes and repeat out loud five times, "I am so glad I do not work for quality control at *Johnson & Johnson."  HAVE A NICE DAY.. AND REMEMBER.. THERE IS ALWAYS SOMEONE ELSE WITH A JOB THAT IS WORSE THAN YOURS

       I'm well... just chilling out and doing some news.... less vigourous shopping :)  RealNetworks is hacking into iPod?? -  urlLink http://news.com.com/Is+Real's+'hacking'+of+iPod+legal%3F/2100-1030_3-5290814.html?part=rss&tag=5290814&amp;subj=news.1030.10   Nikon Europe reports that 18 cartons of 108 D70 have been stolen, so beware! -  urlLink http://www.dpreview.com/news/0407/04072807nikond70stolen.asp   My mum and sister will be touching down this Saturday into KL to join me for my cousin's wedding. Other than that... most of the i-net cafe here uses Win98, which frustrates me to no end. I'm trying to upload some photos from my camera via my usb thumbdrive as well as upload some music to it and of course, it Win98 doesn't natively supports USB. ARGH!  Anyway... enough whinging, I'm heading home. Stay in touch!
