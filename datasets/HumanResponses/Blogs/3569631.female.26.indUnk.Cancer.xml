      One more birthday passed.. I'm 26 now. Feels scary. There is no more time to avoid responsibilities. No more time to ignore life happening.  Why am i so crouched inside? It's so hard for me to let out my thoughts.. It's hard to talk about happenings around me.. I can see clearly how much fear is covering me.. I am afraid of people around me. Afraid that they might find this secret chest and nail me on the cross. And this space on net is my secret chest.  Millions of people seek asylum here.. We run to each other running from people in our physical world.. It's really ironic.. I am attending one course for 4 days now.. Today will be the last day.. Well, this course is so enriching. Never felt anything like that. It's about art of living. It's about practical wisdom.. We had some workshops...I'll mention just one. You are sitting infront of one person and looking at that person's eyes for long time with full intention. And so you stare at each other's eyes very long. And then you hear voice saying: if God would appear to you right now in form of person across to you would you be able to recognize it? Would you be able to see it? And then all the world is just that person. You feel immense love for that pair of eyes.. you would move mountains only to see those eyes happy.. And you want to drown in those eyes. You see Krishna blinking behind them. It's amazing feeling.. And then there is this recognition of how beautiful we all are and how alone and hurt. And you keep asking yourself why is that? Why are we so big strangers with each other?  And answers are coming.. It's amazing how everytime when you have question from your heart you immediately receive answer. Maybe for first time i am able to see world from this corner.. Maybe for first time i feel safe but also responsible for my life.. Yes all is in my hands. I can really move mountains. I can also finish my studies.. I can reach my dear South Asia... I can play tabla if i want... I can smile throughout the day.. And i can trust people even if they hurt me hard.. As much as people can trust me..

      Is it possible that we are just puppets on string?

      Demons dance around me. Life came to collect it's part. Time for me to move some steps further. Am i really so bad person? What causes my actions? What is right thing to do? There is no savior, and that is the scariest idea.. There is no melancholy and sympathy in life..One more scary thing.. All this is only set for us to crush our egos and mental conceptions. Am i crushing it? I know i go towards the rock.. Seen it before.. I'm stuck to long in swamp of nothing.. my mind already stinks.. no fresh air in it.. I want to grow only. I want others to grow too. And break the limits of collective mind. Everything has it's purpose.. I only pray that my stumbling will not cause any suffering to others..

      Summer came finally..two days ago. No one is happier then mi in this city. After all those clouds and grayness it's really relief to feel sun on the skin... I even tolerate suffocating from heat in my attic apartment. Sun gives me some enthusiasm, makes me feel alive, makes me burn inside more... Ahhhh... Also summer makes me sad on so many ways. Feeling of being alone is more strong. Feeling of some strange insecurity. Feeling that i dont belong in this city... feeling i wanna burst out of my skin and appear on some different place. Asia. South asia. Place that makes me cry and smile at the same time. Place that enchanted my heart with all, even with it's bleeding. If anything feels like home on this planet it's there. And all i wanna do is come home. But yes, i know, this whole planet is not home.. Home must be somewhere else.. And yes, all i wanna do is just come Home! Yesterday my very close friend was here for a visit. After almost one year. She lives in India now. We talked insignificant things, but our souls have some common parts and just feeling that is like tasting water in the desert. I love her deeply. Still i feel alone. Days go bye so quickly, and i am really lost in them. Dont know how to live. What to do with minutes ahead? I mean, i know some of the steps that i have to make, but some inner thirst makes me so stuck. I feel like on the edge of explosion but yet that explosion never happens. And i am waiting to burst. Too much passion in me but something makes it stuck. That makes me so restless inside... And you know what is worst thing? I know all of the answers! But yet i somehow dont know them! And universe is silent. And yet It screams with love to every atom existing. And that makes life scared with beauty.

      Facing this blank space second time. Feels easier already..  Day almsot crushed me. Expressed all emotions today in almost full intensity: from violence to sweet softness; from despair to universal joy..  And after that i feel really so tired.. Begging the universe to show me the way to reach myself; to show me the way of growth. Begging myself to be open enough to hear the answers and brave enough to follow them with enthusiasm. Now i go to sleep. Good night my thoughts..

      Ok, this is first words on this blank screen. Seeing them makes it easier to continue. So long it's been since i last tried to pull some words from my mind and write them down. So long. And before it was the way of my breathing, of surviving things, of reaching the truths and reading signs.. way of talking to myself.. But for some time now i am really empty.. Only dry thoughts dwell in my mind.. and only dry words come out of my mouth.. and no marks on paper.. Well i'll see what will happen with this try. So should i already start writing down the struggles of my life so stacked in the mud.. Maybe.. This past two days were marked with my menstrual period.. Yeah, imagine that! Last few months i have strangely painful periods and have no idea why. Before i didn't even noticed them.. and now... ohh God! Well it's not that it hurts so much, only i feel so broken, so alone, and so so sensitive, and have huge desire for chocolate pudding... I think i am going through some hormonal changes or something.. Now it's the end of the day, and my thoughts are tired and slow.. Only what they can think of is ....... sweet puddings, and warm bed. Tomorrow is transit of Venus.. Feeling excited about this.. Hope it will bring some changes...

      Tori Amos song!! Listening this song now! Has so pieces of me!     Going to mountains tomorrow!   Feeling little scared of it!   Guys started to want me... Isnt that strange??   Hmmm...   They make me numb and in constant position of emptiness.   And i feel so alone! Like only person on the planet!    But i am not lonely.. Ohh no.. I desire loneliness!! I desire to be fertile and alone like in the old days..   And this writing..  seems like i am so dry.. no inspiration at all...   Although jyotishi told me this year is writing year for me.. this year i  should be writing like mad...   But i am empty..  for more then one year i live without writing..   And this blog was my try to push me write.. just write anything...   Ahh but it's not working! Everytime i go and write something i have to force myself.. and sentences are so meaningless...   Maybe mountains will inspire me!   Pray for me!!

      Aaaaaaaaa!!!!! Tomorrow i have exam!!! And stilll didnt even read half of the book!! Aaaaaaaaaaa!!!!  My eyes are swollen. My skin has weird texture. And i have strange taste in my mouth! I dont know what caused these symptoms, but could be affected by frustration with this exam. And why i didnt manage to prepare for this exam?? Well, like usual... this certain man ate up many hours of my days.. he is just so stuck on my neck!!  And also i visited one friend yesterday... Well, he is in so weird life situation these days... Hey, interesting thing is that this friend and his room mates have like little zoo in the house where they live.. They have two snakes, two lizards, many mice, birds... and more, much more... For the first time i was holding a snake in my hands.. and lizard too!! They feel different on touch then i imagined.. After coming back home i was watching Devdas.. last part of it.. and crying my eyes out!! Imagine that!!! I dont know where those tears came from but i am telling you my heart was breaking! And it's not like i have this habit.. Please God, do some miracle and make me memorize all the necessary data.. and dont let me give up!! Ufff... Well i got to go back to work... See you dear pages some other time... Hopefully tomorrow with happy news!

      Ohhh!! It seems i always have need to write when i am down. And i am so down today!!  I've seen new mothers yesterday at one party. And new born babies.. And i saw how mothers behave.. And it brought me to conclusion that God is not our mother.. It's been three years since i am prisoner of one relationship from which i cant get out. I feel it most of the time as a punishment for something really bad i did in some past life or something.. I mean this person is drinking my blood as a vampire!! And i dont know how to get out! I should be studying now because i have billions of exams to give.. but i am just too down to move.. no light or air in my mind...  I need a miracle to set myself free... and i need to be free from all this if i want to survive... Just few hours with this person, and world stops being beautiful.. tears are in my eyes.. and desperation in my soul... i feel like in prison... And... I need to do something fast... But this person is just stuck on me... This man! Doesnt want to go out of my life.. Acting with me as i belong to him..  God, even if you are not my mother, i need you desperately to set me free!!!!!

      What a freaky personality i am!!! Nothing seems to have ability to weak me up from this inactive state i am in... What to do??? I am so messy inside.. and restless.. and for some reasons running away from myself.. running from any chance to face myself.. And i am doing nothing throughout the days.. And to do something is so hard for me.. Why, o why???... And i cant sleep at night.. and then i cant weak up in the morning... and i cant make plans..!! I cant keep promises to myself!!! Isn't that just too freaky?? I have no idea what to do with my life actually.. i am like in constant position of one who is observing and not creating.. But bursting out of desire to create something!!!!  How to get the hell out of it??? How to step out of this circle?? So far i didnt manage to find any answer! And my duties; well they consist of studing, and trying to earn money to survive, and housework, and also i am trying to do some exercises and meditation.. And guess what!!! So many days pass that i dont managed to do not one of those things!!!  And then when exam days approach i kill myself in studing in last few days, and my brain cracks... and i feel lifeless few days after that.. Now are those days... And then i am thinking how to repair myself!! How??? Well it seems that i am asking so many questions on this blog! Me, who always knows the right answers when others are concerned.. Ahhh!! Yeah, i am really messy!
