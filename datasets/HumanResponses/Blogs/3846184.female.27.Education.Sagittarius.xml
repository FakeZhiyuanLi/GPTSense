      I can barely keep my eyes open (written while trying NOT to read into the extreme fatigue I've been experiencing as a pg symptom...) but I just had to write a little before I hit the hay, especially since I feel like my earlier entry sounded like a bit of a downer...but as I referenced there, like New England weather, if you don't like my mood, just wait a few minutes and it's certain to change!  At any rate, at my grandmother's birthday party today, I held my 3-month old nephew (my first, born two weeks before my first edd) and I didn't feel sad or broken!! I loved holding him and told my brother that I was going to take him home. I was so happy to hold him close, and I didn't want to let him go. It felt so good, since the last time I saw him I couldn't hold him because it just hurt too much...  I am rambling (I do that even more when I'm tired) but just wanted to document an "up" moment. Maybe, just maybe, my heart is beginning to heal...now if I can just get to the day when I hold my own little one, I think my heart will heal, someday.   Patience and faith, patience and faith...

      I saw this saying on a bumper sticker the other day (oddly enough, on the office door at my step-daughter's day camp) and I just felt like, oh boy can I relate!!!!  Maybe it's hormonal, maybe it's stress, maybe it's being a full-time step-mom for the summer, maybe it's that my work hasn't been very challenging lately, maybe it's that I so very much want a baby of my own and yet I am terrified about losing another.  Hmm, maybe it's a combination of all of these factors. What do you think?  I have been so tired lately, and of course that adds to the ttc obsession, and it hasn't helped me to feel very productive lately. Everything seems to take an effort, and when I don't do everything I want to, the guilt sets in (I'll save that for my next entry...)  I just need more time in the day, that's what I'm always saying...and now I have to run since we're off to my grandmother's 89th birthday party. Yup, 89. Can you believe that?  More later...  p.s. Many thanks to my girl Janet for reading and commenting. I need and want to comment on your recent entries, but just haven't had a chance. Always thinking of ya, though...

      Yup, I'm surely in a funk. I think there are a number of reasons as to why, and of course I'm sure that the anxiety and fears of trying to conceive (especially after two miscarriages) are a part of it. Being a full-time step mom suddenly for the summer (now 4 weeks into 8, when my  PRE-TEEN  step-daughter has never been here more than 10 days before) definitely plays big part as well, but all in all that's going well. (If we can just eliminate the pre-teen attitude and whining...!#$%^, I  hate  whining!)  At any rate, it's been almost a month since I created this blog and decided to delve into the world of journaling, and yet I've still written almost nothing. I have this problem, you see, where I need to do everything perfectly (yes, I believe that is called perfectionism), so I often end up putting things off because I can't do them just right. It's not really how I want to be, so maybe that's one thing of many I can work on here, along with my quest for   patience and faith  . I have had all sorts of ideas for this blog, and various entries written in my head, but I've gotten nowhere without starting somewhere, so here I am...  I think I'd like to turn this blog into a couple of different things...(semi) daily journaling will definitely be good therapy for me (up until now, the boards have been instrumental to me in that way, but I think I am getting to another place where they are not as helpful to me anymore...not to say that the support and friendship I've found there isn't still important, just that I think I need a new forum...)  I'm getting off track again (I do that a lot)...another idea that I've had is to make this blog a place where I can post the "history" of this past long and painful year, since my first pregnancy and first miscarriage. I've saved a lot of "key" things that I've written, either in e-mails or in posts on message boards, and I think I may copy them here, to show the flow of my emotion and (hopefully) the  growth I've made over the last year. Of course, that'll take some time, so who knows when I'll get around to it...for now, let's just say that this blog is...    UNDER CONSTRUCTION.    Thanks for reading if you have...so far I have not been bold enough to make this public, so if you have read this, I already know you are a close and supportive friend I made on the boards. Thanks ladies...((((hugs))))....  More to come...(hopefully in less than a month's time...)

      I've finally decided it's time to start a blog of my own...it'll be slow to start and sparse for a while, especially since we leave in two days for a week's visit to the in-laws, but I decided to follow in Christine's footsteps and try out this blogging thing. Hopefully I won't be far behind her in getting pregnant (for good) again soon, too...thanks for showing me the way, Christine! :)

      Well, the BBQ was a success (and my dad was completely surprised to find out that it was a retirement party in his honor), though of course we are exhausted. I didn't sit down for more than 10 minutes most of the day, nor did I get too much time to chat and catch up with any of the 45 or so family that were here, but I think everyone knows that I'm not pg yet and we're still trying.  Funny how that manages to make its way into every conversation, even when I'm NOT obsessing (really, I'm not!) -- sometimes I wonder if I make people uncomfortable with the things I say, but then I kinda think "fuck it" -- I AM going to talk about the miscarriages and I AM going to talk about how much I want a baby. I don't think I talk about it too much...at least most of the time. Most people know the situation and most tend to ask in some kind of way.  I also was able to squeeze in a little bit of bonding time with my little 3-month-old nephew. He is just so damned cute. He really is. I love holding him, I love changing his little diapers, I love feeding him, and I love that the ceiling fan or my fingers twirling makes him light up and coo. He is just so damned cute. Have I mentioned how much I want a baby of my own?! Some day...I am really tring to be patient and have faith that it will happen for us.  I'm very bummed that it is now officially Sunday afternoon and the weekend is almost at an end. I don't know where weekends go. My best friend is also visiting this weekend, and I had the best time with her and DH last night, when I drank far too much wine but had so much fun being silly-ass drunk and up 'till 3am with two of my favortie people in the world.  I am so grateful for the many wonderful people in my life. How did I get so lucky? I am very fortunate, and sometimes I need a little reminder. Family and friends gathered around me tends to help me remember that I am very fortunate, and I am loved.  Okay, enough of the mushiness. (God I am becoming more and more of a sap every day...I'm not quite sure when that happened.) I need some more coffee...

      Anyone who says that chocolate and PB isn't the perfect combination is just plain crazy. It cures all that ails you, and I just ate way too much of it tonight. Not that it was all that bad of a day (it wouldn't have been sweets I was downing but a whole lot of something alcoholic had it been that bad) but some days the PB and chocolate chips are just calling to me from the cabinet, know what I mean?  So, clearly, there's not much new or exciting to report...things with the hubby are better, though we didn't really talk much more about anything. Sometimes even I realize that I can talk things to death. We're just so tired, and God knows this full-time parenting thing can take its toll on just about anyone! Buttons have been pushed left and right around our house lately...okay, time for some cuddle time before bed.  I'm not sure I'll be able to write much 'till next week, since we have about 45 people coming on Saturday for a BBQ and surprise retirement party for my dad (at least I can get my drink on!) and my best friend/almost sister is coming in for the weekend tomorrow. Yay! Hope everyone out there has a great weekend!

      So along with my new attitude comes a new look on the blog. The other template was just a little too fancy-dancy for me, and I really like this one much more.  My attitude change is coming along, and I'm doing my best to not constantly think about getting pregnant and having a baby. It doesn't help that I have a 3-month old nephew (my parents' first biological grandchild) and two friends from high school who are due any day now, but I'm trying hard to separate my situation from theirs.  It ain't easy, but I'm trying.  What helps but doesn't help at the same time is that I've been having step-parent issues again. If it's not one thing, it's another, but I know that our stuggles in life are supposed to make us stronger somehow, and I certainly could have it a hell of a lot worse.  I do worry about how this blended family thing weighs on my relationship with my husband, but I know we will get through the bumps in the road, since we always do. We had a big argument last night over dealing with my step-daughter's behaviors and bad habits, so it's really weighing on my mind today.  I know it all comes down to the G-word (guilt), and I think that's something we both need to work on diminishing, but God knows that's just like trying to "relax" when ttc -- easier said than done! We both have all these feelings of guilt in regard to her, and we tend to take it out on each other. Between that and trying really hard not to feel resentful, it all just gets a little overwhelming for me sometimes, and it can be hard to express that to DH without making him feel worse about it all.  I'm sure we'll talk more about it tonight and get through it. We just have to. I'm a talker, and it drives DH nuts sometimes, but we married each other with eyes open, so we'll both just have to deal!  Hmm, maybe I'll just give him a call right now. That might help. If only I could then take a nap...

       (Title to be read like that diet-guru in the early 90's was famous for saying "Stop the Insanity!")   Okay, so I lost this fairly lengthy post on this topic on Sunday when my computer suddenly and mysteriously re-booted all on its own, and I haven't had the time or energy to re-create it...basically, I have been noticing some major obsessive signs creeping in, more and more each cycle of trying, and I've decided to nip them in the bud.  I'm not changing anything significantly, really, not stopping ttc by any means, not stopping charting my temps just yet since I still need that daily check-in and pattern to follow each month, not to mention the "data" it provides, clinical and cold sounding or not (I am a researcher after all).  I am, however, going to do my best to curb the obsession. No more pressure, no more guilt, no more reading into every little twinge and twang. I am trying my best to change my attitude.  Yeah, we'll see if this lasts the 2 week wait. It's good intentions that count, right?  Anyway, for now, I am trying to remember what it's like to live life without the colored glasses of a woman desperately trying to conceive after miscarriage. I don't want to be desperate, and I don't need to be desperate. There is time, and if it's going to happen, it's going to happen. I have to keep in mind my major lessons in life...patience and faith. Both have been tested a hell of a lot this past year, but if I don't learn, I'll continue to be tested.  Here's trying, with as much patience as I can muster, and in good faith...  _____________________________________________________________   Many thanks to my visitors and your comments, by the way! Sorry it took me so long to say so, never mind say much of anything on here. Life's been a little crazy, but I so much appreciate y'all finding me and taking the time to say hello.

      I'm feeling the need to break out of my shell today. Must be that BF(ucking -  there ya go, Janet...good idea, actual cursing helps somehow )N this morning, closely followed by AF's pet Spot -- that damn Spot's bite definitely hurts. The signs are telling me that I am out again this cycle, and that I am destined to continue on this ttc journey for a while longer, kicking and screaming if I must...  At any rate, I am ever so grateful for my readership of two ( thank you so much Christine and Janet! ) but I think it's time to stop being so damned shy and go public. I'm not making any big announcement or anything, but we'll see if anyone out there finds this by listing it ( please send me a little shout out and comment just to say hi so I know you're out there if you do find me ) and maybe I'll add a link to my siggy on ivillage.  If you're visiting my blog for the first time, welcome, and thanks for stopping in!    Here's my disclaimer:    I make no promises that this will be remotely interesting or entertaining, but I will be baring my soul, which may sometimes include some hope-inspired blathering and other times some disparaging, pathetic whining about how much this ttc after m/c journey can suck the big banana.  Thanks for reading if you are, and thanks for commenting if you do. If you hate me and my verbal diarrhea, please don't tell me and please don't torture yourself by hanging around. I don't need to be loved by everyone, and I can totally take (and sometimes need) a good well-intentioned cyber bitch-slapping like my good friend Janet is quite adept at doling out, but my occasionally wavering and hormonally shifting self-esteem really doesn't need a beating, either.  If you can stand my drivel, please come back, and let me know you're out there once in a while. Thank you ever so kindly! ;) (Yes, if you can't tell by now, I am a bit of a dork...)
