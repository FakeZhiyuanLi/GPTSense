All good things come to an end but at least you know you left this world with a friend.                          Inspired by: Cassie Hurd                                                                       By: Sean Passwaters ________________________________________________                                                                                     My Heart Burns      My heart burns like a fiery ember and I long for all the good times I remember. My world is dark but my love is bright just from one glimpse of the beautiful site. I could look at her face forever in awe and wonder how her face could not have a flaw but alas I realize we are not meant to be but I am still in love with her Infiniti beauty. Now with my heart ripped and turn and my love crushed to a piece I think to myself will my love for her cease.                    By: Sean Passwaters                      My Life            My life is like the ever-changing sea it's twist and turns burden me but as it goes on it seems to calm and life can go on normally. Life can be as nice as a breeze in the trees but the hatred always tares at me. As my tears hit the ground I know to this world I am forever bound but in my dreams I ride the never ending sea hoping I will never wake up but my life always seems to interrupt.        By: Sean Passwaters  ________________________________________________                            My Love for Her     I flood her with love like a giant tidal wave and I try to confess but I am not that brave. She says were just friends but we can be much more but she leaves me behind a closed and locked door. I try to get through but to no avail and I am afraid she will crush my heart for it is so frail. Her beauty is stunning and she is smart and cunning I wish I could say how I truly feel and the dream I have of her were really real.             By: Sean Passwaters                            The Dark          As I walk through the dark alone and affright looking for one glimpse of the precious light. As it glimmers and gleams at the end of the tunnel the fresh air hits me so quick and suddel. It is clear to me now that I'm here for a reason now that I escaped the under ground prison. I will live my life with love and joy now that I turned to man from boy.                       By: Sean passwaters
