      Some of my best "thinking" time is when I take a time-out from life to shoot hoops in the front room of my loft.  It's just me, the small ball (that isn't loud enough to disturb the tennants below), and my thoughts.   Last night I was thinking...at this time last year I was bombarded with the senior question - "so, Jeremy, do you have any plans for the next year"...basically hitting on the obvious point that I was soon to graduate from Hobart College.  Well, now that repetitive and intrustive question asking has taken a new form - "how does it feel not to be going back"?  I don't know where I weigh-in on this.  On one level, I could answer that it feels great - no homework, forget early morning classes, and an end to the "small-town HWS drama"...but at this point, I don't have a definitive understanding of my true feelings.  What if I really do miss school, the HWS social life, and the academic environment?  I guess I will soon face that reality in the next couple of weeks when my college friends, who are now oddly seniors, return to the campus for the fall semester....freeeaaaky!

      Have you ever been in one of those moods where you  want  to make yourself un-happy?  Why would someone want to do that to themselves?!  Well,  it happended to me this past Friday evening.  I got back from the gym around 7ish, and I was determined to make myself miserable.  Mind you, I wasn't particularly upset over one thing or another;  I was in one of those "blah" kind of moods.   So here I was, just back from the gym and ready to hit the shower, when my cell went off.  It was a friend (Ben), asking me to come to a party with him at the Rochester East End Festival.  All of a sudden, my mouth opened and I was replying that I would be happy to go with him.  That evening I had a great time celebrating one of the last nights of summer (or early fall here in Rochester).   So what's the lesson learned?  I guess it is that your heart and mind will do what they want to.  No matter how organized or planning-oriented you are, you cannot map out your emotions.  When opportunity comes knocking...you will know whether to accept or decline.  So keep your palm pilot fastened to your hand, and your life fastened to your heart.

      Do you think that the youth of today participate differenly in terms of political engagement as opposed to the youth of yester-year?  I've been pondering this thought seriously today, and unfortunately, have come to no resolution.  Today's politically conscience and active youth (and by youth I mean under 21) are passionate around issues that they feel are important to them and their own values.  For example, many women are very vocal and adament about preserving the right to decide over matters concerning their own bodies.  Quite obviously, youth are also very interested in education funding, especially when it comes to financing higher education.  But does this energy and passion translate in to a more politcally engaged generation than those that came before them?  I don't know.  Critics are quick to point out that while contemporary youth may indeed be passionate, they fail to demonstrate this interest in the voting booth come November.  This is something that previous generations certainly did not pass over.  For it was the infamous baby-boomer generation that launched the campaign to lower the voting age in response to the unfair expection that one could serve in the military at 18, but not yet have a voice in determining how our nation's armed services would be utilized.  They took advantage in politics, but I pose the question - how do you then define political involvement.  The generations of the 1960's were engaged in the traditional understanding of political involvement (voting), but were also very much involved in "un-traditional politics" (enter: Craig Rimmerman, Prof. of Political Science at HWS).  Youth then, and as I will now argue still do today, participate in protests, demonstrations, grassroots phone-a-thons, and marches.  These acts cannnot simply be overlooked, for this is, like voting, is an excercise of democracy.  So as I write tonight, I guess I have answered my own question (enter: Cooney argument). The youth of the 21st century are not disinterested in politics, but merely frustrated with a political system that side-steps their opinions and passions.  Ironically, modern youth are being ignored by the very people that once fought so hard as youth to be heard.  The youth of today can be seen working on local campaigns, are clearly evident in protests and marches, and are voicing their opinions in academic settings nationwide.  Contemporary youth care about politics as did previous generations.  Afterall, the youth of today will be tomorrow's leaders.  On a more lighter note, for all those eagerly anticipating the results of my second cooking attempt  - I ate a well-balanced meal of turkey patty, brown rice, and green beans.  Yummy.  Next recipe please!

      Who knew cooking could be so difficult. I consider myself to be the world's foremost master at preparing toast. Yes, I can produce a quality piece of toast made with a variety of toaster settings. But frankly, that just isn't going to cut it for the next year. So tonight, I attempted to cook a balanced meal.

      Like any polite host, it is first appropriate to introduce one's self to the guest, or in this case - the reader. That being said; my name is Jeremy, and this is my blog.  It is impossible to go into a self-biography at this point, but I am most assured that as you read of my adventures in these wondrous post collegiate years, you will begin to learn who I am as a person,  and  as a supposed "educated" adult. Just in case, for all those doubters out there, here is my life reduced to a few quick bullets:    Jeremy Akbar Cooney  23 years old  Born in Calcutta, India, moved to Rochester, NY at 7 weeks   Graduated from School of the Arts High School and a recent graduate of Hobart College  Life-long student of public policy, economics, and philosophy  Currently employed by the federal government - Congresswoman Louise M. Slaughter  I live in an urban loft located in Rochester, NY with Matt, my friend from Hobart   Okay, that's kinda of depressing; my life is reduced to seven bullets. I guess I will have to expand throughout my future entries.   Anways, as any good politician (my boss) or HWS professor (Sutton) would ask - "what's the point, what's the message, what's the central theme you are trying to convey?". The purpose of this newly formed blog is to share with all of you both the big and small lessons that I learn on a regular basis from living an independent life away from my fraternity (oh! - there's another bullet), college friends, and campus I once called home.   So sit back, relax, and read on with caution, curiousity, and a sense of humor.
