       C heers! I sign up and pay for an MSN Premium account today since I saw that there is a discount price for the internal employees:)  The price sounds good, $30.00/year, compare with the market price $99.95/year, it is very nice. I got $2.6 tax plus.  MSN Premium is very excellent, although there are many services can not be supported in China at present, I still enjoy it very much.

      World Carnival opened in Beijing since last weekend, some of my colleague have gone to enjoy it and spend thousands Yuan for it. It is a very nice place for fun, it is a very nice place for earning money.  I Downloaded some advertisement video clips from the World Carvial's official website this morning. that is a good preview before I go to experience it by myself.      urlLink http://www.world-carnival.com

        B ig Fish , maybe the best movie I watched in the first half of this year, since I am disappointed in  Troy  and  The Day After Tomorrow .   I read a movie comment about the  Big Fish  this afternoon, it reminds me of the world this movie described again. The movie tells the tale of a father and son, who is about to become a father himself, the mythology surrounding the father's life, and the reconciliation between fact and fiction.   I ever asked a friend of mine, he is American, whether the big fish has some special meanings in the western tales, and he told me yes, the big fish always appears in the western tales, especially the fairy tales, it is a symbol for the hope, the dream, and the goodliness.   I believe that everybody has a big fish in his mind, we are always looking for it, waiting for it and questing for the meaning of it. that is our lives.      urlLink http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/bigfish/site/index.php    urlLink http://www.mov8.com/movie/review.asp?id=16596

       R ead some new documents about longhorn today, I remembered that someone asked Mr.Gates when will the Longhorn release in the conference in Beijing some days ago. It seamed that we still have to wait for a long time for Longhorn.  I saw a colleague of mine use "Looooooooonghorn" as the display name of her MSN Messenger account. I thinked she must expect this new OS very much too.   BTW, I will try to install a testing version of Longhorn and experience it when I have time.
