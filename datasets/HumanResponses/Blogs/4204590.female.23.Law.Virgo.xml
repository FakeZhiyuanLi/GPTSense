      FIRST we were best friends.....knew each others deepest secrets.....all of one anothers likes/dislikes......we laughed....joked...hung out......we could be around each other and be ourselves.......you seen me at my worst....there for each other when no one else was........gave comfort...advice...a shoulder....a laugh when any or all were needed.........it was not hard nor long b4 we came to care naturally for one another....had much love for each other........THEN we became lovers.....outta the blue.....you me we.....crossed that line....but it was wonderful......thought that we wouldn't get attached.........didn't want to b/c we knew......or thought we knew the impact of the consequences if we couldn't seperate the best friends from the "get down" pair.........THEN something happened & it changed everything that we knew.....we went from the "get down" pair to lovers....paramours......&amp; it was beautiful.....had so much fun....thought we could handle it when we had to become "just" best friends again......never did we expect to fall for one another......although as intelligent as we both are should have known that if u care for someone as just best friends that once you become lovers that you are called "lovers" for a reason............NOW everything that once was is no longer........we lost our lover....our get down.....but most importantly best friend......how did this come about....we don't know.........the most worst consequences not foreseen.........but the only thing I personally regret......is that the one person I need to turn to I no longer can't............
