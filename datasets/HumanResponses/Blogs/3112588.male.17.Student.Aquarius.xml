      ok well im posting..need to put a post it on my door reminding me i have a web page..actually wonder how many ppl look at it...haha. a friend once said that a blog is mainly just to vent about things, b/c it's like you're telling someone, but you're just expressing yourself while not having to make any apologies to anyone! up until 5 on friday morning doing 5 pg grapes of wrath essay and notes...turned it in...prob gonna have a "burn your essay" party at my house after we get them back! so after 3 cups of coffee, and listening to a kenny g cd at least 4 times, i was finished and ready for bed. its sunday night...friday just went to the IMPROV show with nicole...i didn't really enjoy it that much, but it was a little funny i guess! then, came home, and was supposed to take moms car to TP Jeremy Cooper b/c Laura is sick of him bashing her and mocking her, but they couldn't make it...then, in the spirit of the TP-ing mood, my house, Sarah's house, AND Jeremy W's (supposedly) house got TPd. id have to say that whoever TPd me was pretty dumb, b/c it took about 4 mins to clean up haha! so, going to TP whoever did it on friday night i hope..  went to the memorial on saturday for my little cousin. i was glad that i went, but upset that some ppl in our family didn't come...i was upset, b/c even though they may not have wanted to show up, they have a responsibility to my aunt and uncle and her boys, to support them! i dont like funerals/memorials, but if someone needs me, and im close to them, im gonna go! my mom consoled me by saying that the ppl that went were the ones that truly cared about her and her family, and the ones who didnt apparently aren't true to their word/suck big time. the ppl that she is close with and care about her most were there with her..and the entire church wound up being filled up! God Bless...

      today we got our new car: GMC Denali...it's hecka nice, at least that's what i think...all that good stuff-- DVD player (got ordered), On-Star (car telephone, emergency, everything..), Navigation System, and all those other goodies. im excited, but still feeling a little shallow right now...i feel like after what happened yesterday, with my little cousin being a stillborn and all, that everything else means so much less and i should be thinking about more important things than just being superficial all the time. pray that my interview at hollister next tuesday goes well and i get the job...maybe i could have a chance to get to know Mike Shaddle a little better, and find out if he's really a christian (i believe that he is, at least that's what everyone else tells me). tomorrow, have to work on 5 pg term paper for "Grapes of Wrath"....ill be up until about 4 tomorrow probably. night...

      i know i havent posted in a while, so forgive me. wow, so much has happened since thursday, and i dont know where to start. i got in a fight with my good friend over something really stupid that i regret, and it took us a week to make up...then, saturday, i spent the day at the beach with daniella, sarah, laura, karl, dan, and jeremy & jeremy. jeremy cooper and i had a great conversation all the way to Santa Cruz-Rio Del Mar beach, and i just love getting to know ppl better. it rained, so we went to tommy zefares' house...i knew his sister barbara (having fun in india babs?!?) this summer when we worked together. we came back to my house and watched "duplex" which was SO funny haha! then, sunday rolled around and it was church time, and i can't work on the newsletter anymore, so im like: ok, other than God, whats the point of being involved in church? i cant do anything anymore!! AHH!! but, yeah, monday (yesterday) i went to school for like 3 1/2 hrs b/c we have STAR testing this week (which im not taking), and our schedule is all wacked out...  today, at 8:30 this morning, my aunty teresa called and told us that my aunty angela's baby (she was in labor) died...something happened while he was inside the womb and he was born dead. our families are taking this tradgedy very hard, and we're not sure why the Lord let it happen. I remember when paul sharp passed last april...we didnt know what it meant at the time, but the tragic event brought many ppl to the Lord. God makes bad things happen for a reason, and though we may not understand it at the time, they're actually good things. my aunt would have loved and cared for that baby, and the Lord knows it, but we can have peace in the promise that the baby's in heaven now with the Lord Jesus Christ, and we'll see him again one day. in memory of the newborn, i'd like to dedicate today (his would be b-day)- April 20th, 2004- to him.

      ok well although im posting on thursday morning at like 1:30 am, its for wednesday, k? so, i called up ariel and sarah this morning, and made fast plans, when we decided to go "real-golfing"...so, after like 5 minutes, they decided to go pee-wee golfing! haha me being 17, i havent done that since like my 11th birthday LoL! we had fun though. the girls are always talking about this hot guy named Mike Shaddle (hope i spelled it right haha), and how he dresses like me and he looks like a skinny me (thanx to everyone who said that). well, i guess we have the same nose and we do dress alike, but he's hotter than me..(sigh) if only pilates (pee-lawt-ees) worked faster =) so, anywayz, we go pee wee golfing, and everyone jumps in the cars, and we're supposed to pull the usual "get in the car and drive away" trick on the girls LoL we decided to be nice, so we went to blenzers and starbucks, and al that good stuff, then jeremy walker dropped me off at home. so, my mom asks me if i want to go to the mall and help her make-over her friend. and i was like: sure, but not to make-over your friend, just to get a few new pieces of clothing. so, i went to A&F, and after a long chat with a good friend last night, and eating chocolate eclaires at 1 in the morning (haha), i finally know for myself i don't need clothes to make me feel good. plus, everyone at A&F is mean to me anywayz, b/c i dont exactly look like a supermodel! so, i go to the mall to get some new clothes, and i go Hollister, and i've decided to start shopping there...and who do i find there? MIKE SHADDLE LoL i forgot that he worked there, and after i had told him 5 hrs before that i didn't shop at Hollister LoL!! how dumb am i? so we talked and had a conversation while i waited for the parental, and he's a pretty nice guy. today, im planning on relaxing and punishing myself by sitting down and forcing myself to finish "Grapes of Wrath", b/c i have a test on it on Monday, and a 5 pg essay due on Friday (yeah, right-barely read the book to begin with), and i have to buy "Inventions of Moral", some book to get into AP English, and then read the AP European History packet for the test coming up soon. so, i should get some sleep. night.

      last night, nicole, eugene, nikolitsa and myself all went to a bible study in san mateo, followed by dinner at Chevy's with some cool people. btw, happy birthday johnathan. it was really nice to get out of the house for a change, and meet new ppl. i think the reason that i had so much fun last night was b/c i got to be myself for once. i dont really get to be myself around ppl a lot, but i sure showed everyone my true colors while dancing at 12 in the morning to "Toxic" LoL!! today, i took it easy, and didn't do much. went smimming, got in the hot tub, just relaxed i guess. and you know what else just snapped? i need to stop feeling sorry for myself! it's time to suck it up, and just realize that not everyones going to like me, and that's ok! i mean, if they dont like me (not to sound conceited), it's their bad. i owe this realization to nicole and nikolitsa who showed me some things about myself last night that no one has ever told me: that i was special, and that they really liked me. so, today im turning over a new leaf- it's time to start appreciating myself for who i am, for who God made me, and forget what other ppl think. if i keep basing my life and decisions around how ppl feel about me, then im never going to get anywhere in life, im always going to be in a depressed mood, and i dont want to feel like that. i dont tell many ppl this, but now im letting it out in the open for everyone to hear-- when i was in elementary school, i was the kid that everyone made fun of, and had to eat lunch in the teachers room...to make a long story short (and not as detailed) it stuck with me for all of my life, and really messed me up. ive held onto this fear of ppl not liking me for so long, and i just have to let go, and move on. besides, i can be fun and cool from time to time, so why do i need to hide that? Happy Easter everyone!

      i watched "Intolerable Cruelty" last night, and i wasn't that happy with it actually! today, lets see, plans are: shopping with the madre, getting a haircut (maybe color too-not sure yet), and going to san mateo with nicole for her bible study..maybe rent some movies after that or something, but not sure yet. not really going to have THAT much fun this weekend, except on Easter, b/c i forgot that we didnt have school today, so i planned all my stuff for next week, which is ok. one day of nothing but fun and relaxation is fine with me!! haha! well, i better go and start getting ready. bye!

WRONG!! first, the top flies off, and the shake splashes all over my face, clothes, kitchen..and worst of all, MY HAIR!! AHHH!! (LoL) so, i try to make another one, thinking it can't happen twice! well, i was right- it didn't happen again- this time, i tried to stop the rubbery-spinny thing with my middle finger, and it sliced it open...this was the shake/blender incident from HELL!!! i've sworn to never make a shake again. am i right? i dont really feel like getting attacked by the blender again! i'll try and post things occasionally (like every day), but Nicole, you have to make me do it, k? we'll make each other post, cool!! kk? awesome..so, bye!

      tim said something to me last night that was really cool: " like seriously dude..would you trade this weekend for anything?" pssh-he's right...in fact, i'd trade everything to do it all over again. this was by far the best time i've had in my entire life. even though last night was a little weird and dumb (ya know tim), things are really cool, and always will be. anywayz, enough about this weekend...im sure that everyone's sick of hearing about it by now (IM NOT THOUGH HEHE). today was a little boring. went over to nicole huerta's house to work on the 25 page marketing project due tomorrow in class. our partners (holly and heather--the twins) didnt do their job, so we didnt have time to get together. we're trusting that they'll make the commercial, get it edited, print the promotional campaigns, and make the proto-type of the product by tomorrow morning...all i can do is pray. please pray for me...finals are coming up, and im really scared. dont you know what this means? it means...goodbye frosh/soph/junior years...hello senior year. this is my last year that i will be in high school for the rest of my life. i'll be 18 yrs old next year, and have to go off to college. it just hit me that i've lived at home for almost 18 yrs, and when i leave...i have to change everything about life as i know it. no more walking in the door, and having mom there cooking dinner or offering to go shopping...no more bro's yelling and wrestling with eachother..and no more dad (weird/happy/sad)...i know it sounds like im making a big deal of it, but i just realized that in a few years...ill have to be doing for myself, what my dad is doing for me now. i have to actually go out into the real world, and the scariest part of all----I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I WANT TO DO WITH MY LIFE.

(no, its not what you're thinking--so stop thinking it!) then, tim and i went to bed, and my friend who might be pregnant calls me and wakes me up @ like 9...so, im tired AND mad LoL but at least she is NOT pregnant! PTL!!! so then, i get on the comp (AIM), and nicole is on, and asks if tim and i want to go to San Francisco with her and Jenny Broker to shop and have lunch. so, as if my mom would say YES to that, i just told her i was going to the beach, and it was all good LoL! we were in this one store, and all the music was about SEX SEX SEX..and my mom was like: noah, what is that music?...and i was like: mom, they're having a dance competition at the beach LoL!! (suzy--capitola, member? hehe)...then, since there was no where to eat where we were, we went to market street, and hit up Gucci, Louis Vuitton, SAKS Fifth Avenue, and Tiffany & Co...then, had some lunch at this cool polish restaurant. it was so funny, b/c it was like a Grill and Bar..so we were expecting it to be jankey! but, we walk in, and it looks like a THAI FOOD restaurant..then the guy (polish) comes up and talks to us...and then we listen to the music, which was TRANCE LoL!! it was SO great! hahahaha so, we had some lunch, paid, walked around for a while, and chilled @ the art show park for like an hr or so...we came back @ around 6 or so...so, tim and i get home, and he goes and takes a nap, and i was gonna go and spend the night at the beach, but since my parents said no, and i figured that i had already broke like 50 of their rules this weekend, then i decided to have a sleepover..but they said NO to that too...so, had tim cooper over, and tim scott had to go home to fix his computer, and stuff...then he came back over, and tim had left...and nicole calls me and asks if she can come over LoL! i told her yeah, so she and tim showed up @ my house @ like 10:30 pm..and i cooked spaghetti and some shrimp, and we had dinner by candlelight with Kenny G music (the 3 of us...)....SO then, we go back to the living room and talked for like 2 hrs..then we took nicole back home, and tim and i went to see if anyone from church was awake @ like 1:30 this morning LoL!! the only person that was up was jeff matthews, so we chilled with him for about 10 minutes, and talked to his girl "friend" on the phone for a few! then we go back to my house, got some jackets, drove around CV and san lorenzo and san leandro...stopped at a park and hecka chilled...then went to Safeway @ like 3 this morning to get stuff for breakfast this morning (nicole is coming over for breakfast, and church yeah! TOTALLY EXCITED AND STOKED!!)...so, she's not here yet, but ive gotta go and get ready etc etc etc...might be going to hooters tonite with nicole huerta and stacie jensen and sarah straud, and hopefully tim if he can come, and if im not introuble for spending more money than my parents told me i could heheheheh...Tim, it was GREAT having you over, and we have to do it again soon...you are a GREAT FRIEND, and me and nicole hecka like you enough to spend our whole weekend with you, SO YOU ARE TOTALLY IMPORTANT, ok?? so..ttyl..call the cell byebye

      so today is saturday....this was a good thing. i took it easy--woke up around 11, did some chores around the house....went to the library with nicole to get info on my semester final chem project (on LSD). then, went to nicoles house, to wash her car and clean it out...we only got around to cleaning it out, then we watched a movie, and i came home. all in all, it was a good time. nicole's a good friend to talk to when you need it--and she truly does care what you have to say. im hoping that next weekend will work out OK, and ill be able to have my parties, and everything will go smooth. tim, hope you can come and stay (dan, i know you're checking)...also hoping that everyone knows about my little party-get-together on saturday for church ppl. basically just gonna have ppl over to watch some movies and get in the hot tub, and stuff like that. ill invite you tomorrow (at church) personally, so dont spread it around..who knows? maybe ill have it on sunday instead? that way, everyone can stay up later and stuff like that...but we'll see. ill know for sure on wednesday. just plan to either have sat or sun night free, kk? ok, well i better go..hoping that someone i wanna talk to will sign on....night

      i went to the beach today for sunday school and good times...this weekend i've been totally stressed, and Mrs Lovel really brought to my attention why she thinks that things aren't working out for me--i wont say why, b/c that's between me and her, but i completely agree with her. friend problems have been resolved, and church problems have definitely dissolved. im sorry for my use of bad language on friday...i was upset with one of my friends, but it was mostly b/c i had a bad fight with my dad, and we're still not talking...in fact, i dont know when we will be talking--he doesnt seem to want to reconcile. but anywayz, i dont know if ill be going to school tomorrow...i've had a hecka extreme weekend, and i need to finish reading a book (Catcher in the Rye) and get back into my Bible--a.k.a. Mental Health Day. i got sunburned on my nose today, but i got a nice tan on my arms. cant wait to go back to the beach--suzy, we need to go back to camp sometime soon, i really miss everyone. had a great time today with everyone!!

      i wont say what i did on friday night, b/c some ppl might not approve, but lets just say that after all was said and done, at about 2 in the morning, i was more depressed than i have been for a very long time. im afraid that im going to hurt myself again--but dont worry ppl. im trying to do everything possible to be happy, and surround myself with ppl so that i dont have a chance to do anything dangerous to myself. ive been hurt by too many ppl in such a short amount of time...time to pack up and jump ship?? ill figure it out by sunday--going shopping right now.

      today is not a good day for posting. im depressed, and ready to do irrational things. i need to go and see my psychiatrist...things are not well at all. friend drama, teacher drama, school drama, and dad drama. i told my dad i didnt want to go with him to our other house this weekend, and we had this   HUGE   fight in the middle of the street before he left today. he is so pissed, and so am i--just another gap i need to have in my relationship with my dad right? things are not good right now. im going back into depression mode, and i cant handle this right now. it seems like God is just bullying me around...WHY DAMNIT? WHY THE HELL DO I HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS SHIT??

      today was pretty extreme. i didnt get to be VP for my DECA chapter--yet. i have to do a speech tomorrow, and ill most likely wind up being VPC (vice president of communications) or VPT (vice president of technology). but it seems like kreuzer (my deca advisor) wants me to be on our District Action Team (DAT) way more! it would actually be better if i got on DAT, b/c it means more than having just a plain chapter position. my interview will be on may 26th i believe, so pray for me...i know i can do it! well, got my haircut today, but i didnt get it colored. thats ok, b/c im going to get it done by my mom's friend who went to the Vidal Sasoon Company, and i trust her! she's a great lady, and used to own her own salon! im thinking about a bottom color (honey), with highlights. so, a full over color, then a subtle highlight, yet noticeable...ill prob take laura with me hehe!   i missed 1st period today, which is why laura prob didnt see me this morning! last night at bible study, i was playing football, and i twisted my knee. but i didnt think anything of it until this morning, when i woke up, and it was totally swollen! i can barely walk!! (sigh) im just a mess guys. congrats to aunty for getting that coach bag. laura & suzy--yours is coming!! promise!! soooooo...oh yeah, before i forget--these plans arent for sure yet, but my parents are going away for memorial day weekend, and i hopefully get to stay home. my plan is (and its ok with the parentals, but dont mention it yet) to have a bunch of church ppl over and a few ppl from school, and have a pool/hot tub/dinner/movie party! that would be so much fun, huh? laura's helping me plan it i think haha

      monday..never the best day for school, is it? i agree LoL things seem to be going a lot smoother in the whole church scene deal. that dream the Lord sent me has REALLY taught me a lot about myself, and about what i should and shouldn't do. the other day, i kind of told someone (ray cough cough) that he was being immature, and putting on a front as a christian. i mean what i said, but not the way that i said it. he had made me mad by patronizing me, and treating me like im stupid and everything. sure, im not the smartest person in the world, but im not a total idiot either (sigh)..ive switched from struggling at church, to struggling in my spiritual life, and with my parents. my spiritual life, or lack there of, is non-existent at the moment. i know that when i have 5 free minutes, i should spend it in the bible, but im not motivated....dont feel enthusiastic about reading the scriptures. i'd rather sleep, b/c i barely get any during the week, or go and do something else--does this mean im not a christian? i dont want to doubt in my mind that im not a believer, but some of the things that ive been involved with and doing aren't what God wants me to do; maybe even i dont care what God wants? is that what my flesh is trying to convince me of? lately ive been called a "CARNAL" christian, a "WORDLY" person, a "VAIN" metrosexual, and an "UNBELIEVER". now you tell me how you would respond if ppl had been telling you those things. would you be like: "no no! i know what i am and where i stand with God!"...or would you be like: "maybe they're right. maybe im not even a chritian at all. and if i am, am i a Carnal Christian?" there are so many things to think about, and i want to think about them ASAP so im not left behind or anything. i dont see why the Lord would send me a dream to save me pain, if i wasn't a christian. i honestly believe i'm saved, but plenty of ppl would disagree with me on that note. anywayz, i have no hw to do tonite, so im going to get to bed. at last! REST!! goodnight.

      i dont want anyone to think of me any differently, but i need to share this with whoever actually reads this thing...last night, i had a dream..the dream lasted about 3 hrs or so...it was about me and some "friends" from church...we were downstairs where we usually chat after church is over. it was me, and the ppl that i am actually not speaking with right now...in the dream, there was a man--this man had a gun. he pointed it at my "friends" and shot them in the head..this was very disturbing to me. after he was finished shooting my "friends" he shot me...but, i woke back up--i wasn't dead in the dream. the man with the gun then turned into a she. the woman piled the bodies of my "friends" on top of one another, and let me free. i promised her that i wouldn't tell the police, but i went to them first. the scene of the dream instantly changed. i had called the cops, and i was back at school for some reason. but no matter who i told, they didn't care, and acted like it was no big deal. i cried to everyone, but no one cared. the scene changed again. the murderess was in a department store, and i was hiding in a rack of clothes. she was approached by my mom, and found out that i had told the police. she pushed my mom aside, and came searching to kill me...the scene changed for the last time. she became a man again...the police came into the church, and arrested the murderer. the scene changed to my house, and the man was arrested, sitting on my porch. my mom and g-pa were talking in the front yard. he was trying to get loose and kill them, but before he could, i found a knife in my hand, and i stabbed him...then i stabbed him again. he was bleeding, and he tried to hurt me, but i woke up...  you may ask why i think i had this dream..i will tell you that the Lord is showing me His mercy, and helping me to not become bitter with the friends that i have at church. He had to humble me with a dream so scary that i fear to go to sleep at nights now. the Lord is trying to get my attention, and if it had to be through a dream, then so be it...

      know i haven't posted in like years...so here is the lowdown: nothing really happened during the last week of april, so ill save all of you the boring details. this weekend (april 30th-may 2nd), we went to our other house up by Dodge Ridge, and just had a family weekend. we were supposed to do some work on the other house, but my dad accidentally cut his leg on a knife that was sticking out of a toolbox and so instead of working, my grandparents (who were up there also), actually i should say my grandpa, had to rush my dad to the hospital, and my g-ma and my mom and brother's just decided to have a fun day of shopping on Old Sonora, and i spent some quality time with my brother simon--we acted like hicks, and went fishing. it was fun to just be carefree for the weekend. when we came back from fishing, my dad came back from the hospital to reveal his 11 stitches in his leg. the rest of the weekend was spent watching movies, going out to dinner, and just having fun. got back home on sunday, and my dad is being really mean lately, so fights broke out...nothing more to say there! monday was boring, but we did go to sarah's house, and died her hair, and "waxed" her moustache, and laura plucked her eyebrow's. although her mom didnt want her to get the "clown red" hair dye, laura and i still think that the ruby red color would have been a lot better. and btw..when did ruby red become the new orange?? clowns have reddish orange hair..hello ppl!

      another deep post...so if you dont feel like reading--dont stick around heh ;) so.......tim gave me this book a few weeks ago called: Healing for Damaged Emotions. well, i tried to give it back to him early, b/c i didnt want to finish reading it--but he knows me too well, and got me to finish reading it before i gave it back to him. i skipped a boring chapter...and wound up on the chapter that he had bookmarked for me (there were 2 parts actually): Signs of Perfectionism (7), and Healing for Perfectionists (8). now, i only got around to reading chapter 7, but im glad that i did. omg, i wanted to throw it against the wall though! ahhh! i know that im a perfectionist (and the worst kind too), but to have to sit there, and read everything that YOU do, that you have NEVER realized you did is really (as my laura would say) very "INTENSE". this is one of the only books i could have burned (actually--this and Grapes of Wrath--screw Steinbeck ahh). from the readers and perfectionists part of view, it kind of seems like this guy (the pastor and author) doesnt understand what i am going through, what i have gone through...but they can sit here and rebuke me for "sinning"? pssh yeah...thats a no-go for sure. the only 2 reasons i kept reading it were b/c i told tim that i would finish the book (yeah--loyalty)...and b/c i wanted to know what else this jackass had to say about me. well, in the end, im glad that i read it, but now the hard part is WHO do i have to help me fix it? surely you wont see me being the first person in line to talk to any of our elders at our church about my personal life! if they knew HALF the stuff i did in the past, i would have been excommunicated by now (maybe...you know my exaggerations). its just that they wouldnt understand what ive been through. im sure many of you are sitting at home saying that this is just an excuse to NOT fix myself...well, its not, i just dont think anyone at my church is fit for me to be able to share things with that ive gone through. and since i cant really leave FBC until im 18, does that mean i have to wait another few months before i can start this long and grueling process of getting better? there's always that choice of ME being able to do it on my own...but thats the whole reason that i need help--im a perfectionist..and one of my symptoms is taking on WAY more than i can handle. i know for a fact that this is too much for me to handle. so...do i need to isolate myself from ppl for the rest of the summer, and hybernate in my home trying to fix myself? uhh, again--another NO-GO. im sure that many would say thats what i need to do, but who are they kidding? im a teenager, and its SUMMER PEOPLE! DUH! so when do i start? well, if you read my journal 2 posts ago (entitled **i faced my fears and got lost in my mind today**), you will see that i already have taken the step forward in getting better. now, posting here USED to be something that i would do for theraputic reasons--to get stuff off my chest. i gave the web address to a few close friends, so that they could pray for me...and from my understanding, i now have more then 20 ppl reading this weekly...uhh, ok? but no one comments--thats what really annoys me LoL! its like: who am i posting for now? am i posting for me, or for the audience that may or may not exist? if you do truly exist, and you do read this crap i write in here, then PLEASE COMMENT ONCE IN A WHILE! LEAVE ME A LITTLE QUIP!! OR JUST EMAIL ME!! mncmshs@comcast.net  come on now friends (and family--laura heh)...help me out a little bit. i always like to hear encouraging things from ppl once in a while. ill be on the computer for another few hours if you want to talk to me...ok? bye

      ***faced my fears today--got lost in my mind @ last....felt so good*** so i talked with laura last night for like 2 hours--wow, i never knew we could type SO much between the 2 of us hehe! it was good though...we both needed just to talk to one another, since the last good talk we had was like on the snow retreat in january (when we invaded our other house and took all the food, member? LoL!) that was sooo much fun you guys (suzy, sarah, daniella, and laura). my dad was there, and he was like: uhh hey? what are you guys doing here? we're like: dad--duh its the snow retreat! we totally chilled, ate up ALL the food, watched Ace Ventura (hehe), and then walked back down through the snow with all kinds of snow toys (tobagan, sleds, etc)...but yeah, that weekend was the last time we REALLY talked. thank God for sisters in the Lord like Laura--she is always willing to listen, think before she speaks, and doesn't blow you off like you're a total nut (although i am)! i was just washing the van and thinking: you know noah, you have some very good friends...so what are you always worrying about? does there always have to be some type of something going on for you to function? i often ask myself why i cannot live life without some type of challenge--why cant i just accept things for how they are? its hard for me, but if im ever going to "get better", ive gotta start somewhere. now i know that prob tons of you are like: ok, here we go again--he SAYS he's going to start, but tonight, he'll be all out of sorts and trippin' over something...WRONG guys. some things just have to happen for me to finally mean what i say. my aunt angela had a stillborn baby about 10 weeks ago, and she sent a letter to my mom...the letter was just saying that the Lord has carried her along this long road, and that she feels safe and comforted although tradgedy blindsided her. i look at her, and think: wow--her full term baby was born dead, and im sitting here worrying about whether or not my friends might ditch me--when i know they wont?! what kind of idiot am i? life is just TOO short to sit here and worry about everything. where is the fun or learning experience in that? ive thrown myself out there this summer, and i did it b/c i knew that no matter what, the Lord would protect me throughout my trials and the hard times. am i sick of there always being problems? of course. but the question i have to ask myself is this: if i stop worrying, how many LESS problems would there be? wow--just thinking about that made me realize: noah, you know what? if you stopped worrying RIGHT this second, every "problem" would go away (well most of them). i guess i am a problem in a sense, but God still loves me, and He wants me to learn from all the experiences that ive had since the beginning of summer. i know that He has something planned for me, but why do i always have to try and figure it out? well, its b/c if im not in control, i freak out! i mean, ive sat here and typed for almost 3 months, and you've seen that i cant do things correctly on my own! even i know that! but why do, everytime i see a POTENTIAL problem--that isnt even a problem yet-- i take matters into my own hands and make them worse. even i know that God can do things better than i can...i just havent learned how to let go yet. i want to--and who can help me? i was talking to my aunt, and ive even posted it on here: no person can comfort me. when God made me, he left something out on purpose--the lack of being able to be comforted by another human being. now, like, when im crying and someone is there with me, i feel safe and comforted...but it doesnt help me DEEP DOWN INSIDE, where i really need it. and He did that (in my own thinking), b/c he wants me to just TRUST him. why can i trust ppl when they've let me down before, but i cant fully TRUST God?? you would have thought that i would have learned by now--but hey, im stubborn, and we ALL know it heh. so my resolution, goal, and prayer is to stop worrying about the future, take one day at a time, and not trip about things that dont really matter. pray for me guys--thanx.

      instead of writing a lot...just decided to post a song that has hope. think of the person she is singing about, as Jesus....its very happy...enjoy   A new day  A new day  I was waiting for so long For a miracle to come Everyone told me to be strong Hold on, and don't shed a tear Through the darkness and good times I knew I'd make it through And the world thought I had it all But I was waiting for you  Hush, now I see a light in the sky Oh, it's almost blinding me I can't believe, I've been touched by an angel with love Let the rain come down and wash away my tears Let it fill my soul and drown my fears Let it shatter the walls for a new sun  A new day has come  Where it was dark now there's light Where there was pain now there's joy Where there was weakness I found my strength All in the eyes of a boy  Hush, now I see the light in the sky Oh, it's almost blinding me I can't believe, I've been touched by an angel with love Let the rain come down and wash away my tears Let it fill my soul and drown my fears Let it shatter the walls for a new sun  A new day has come  Let the rain come down and wash away my tears Let it fill my soul and drown my fears Let it shatter the walls for a new sun  A new day has come  Hush now, I see the light in your eyes All in the eyes of a boy I can't believe, I've been touched by an angel with love I can't believe, I've been touched by an angel with love  Hush now A new day  --Celine Dion

      i cant sleep tonight at all...my body just wont let me rest. im very distraught once again. ive found that many people have one perception of me..and im not talking about like 5 ppl...not 10 ppl...not 20 ppl...but almost every person i meet has the SAME IDEA about who i am. i think we all know what im talking about here--yes, they think im gay. i cant handle this anymore. its just too much to deal with right now. its getting to me again, and why does it have to happen NOW? i think its b/c even my own mom hates the way that i dress (she thinks its gay), and my own cousin calls me a faggot and a homosexual. this just isnt the right time to hit me...especially when my defenses are down for the first time in years. what im really worrying about is how others feel being around me, and how they feel about their image, since people have this sick perception about me. how am i effecting THEIR reputation, THEIR image, and THEIR own feelings towards me? do i want to say goodbye to them? no way! do i want to break their hearts? no way! do i have to break ties with them though, and cut my losses to save them? im not sure...its not what i want, but they dont deserve to have ppl asking them if im gay all the time, or if we're partners etc etc...do you want to put up with it? b/c i DONT WANT YOU TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT CRAP. do i want to leave you? NO NEVER.........so what am i supposed to do now? am i just supposed to sit here and let you take the flak from the ppl that have a wrong view of who i am, b/c they dont really know me and they dont want to get to know me either? i dont know anymore...i dont know anything anymore..im not a victim! im a miner who has dug a hole so deep that i cant get out--but i have to ask myself what is the hole?? is it my own fault people think these things of me? maybe its the way i dress...the way i talk...the way i present myself. do i really have to figure all of this out AGAIN? please just tell me you'll be with me no matter the shit you'll get from judgemental people..and just tell me that you dont want me to change--b/c im in that state of "conformity" once again, where ill change to get people to like me and stop thinking bad things about me. but im sick of changing--i cant do it anymore you guys. its just too much to handle, too much work, and in the end....i just have to change again, b/c i meet new people, and they want me to be something different. but am i ok? God loves me for who i am, so why cant everyone else? i stress: if God loves me for me, and doesnt want me to change, then why does everyone else????  p.s.--i dunno if im going to be posting for a while or not? its not like anyone reads this thing i guess..they never leave comments. if i dont post for a while, im still alive just to let you know.

      sunday is always one of those days where you dont expect anything to happen, but something always does--sarah and i made up today. yes, we've had problems for months now, but i just cant handle it anymore...i have to forgive her, no matter if what she said was "terrible" or not. she is a friend of mine, and if i keep having something against her, id be sinning (although you still cant figure out hot chick :) heh). will i always remember what was said?? of course, but i cant let that get in the way of how i make decisions in my life, and the things that i plan to do throughout the summer. anywayz, sat with jeremy cooper today at church, and O-M-G...more burned than anyone ive ever seen in my life! heh--but thats what he gets for giving me chicken pox in 1st grade(heh jk). he said that poor jesse is working her little red-haired self off! her mom had told me that she had 2 jobs (chili's--hostess, and secretary at an office)...but jeremy also told me that she's teaching piano!! WOW she's making hecka cash i guess, but ill be praying for ya jess! came home, and took a nap for like 2 hours...i was up REALLY late last night just talking with stephanie lassalle. now, stephanie never really liked me until like a few months ago haha (we met in the 7th grade, when we ran against eachother for president)...but yeah, so i just talked to her. she's really struggling right now with some family issues--her parents aren't saved, and they were REALLY mean when she brought her friends over the other day. see, the thing is, she has some friends from the "Rock" (which i have to go back in 2 weeks, b/c told chris burke i would gag), and she doesn't know if they're gonna like be there for her FOR SURE in the long run...so she feels that she just had another point against her when her dad was really rude to her and her friends. pray that she can trust God as her friend, as her Father, and as a Comfort to her when she REALLY needs it. she seems to be doing much better, after the "Rock" had their little houseboat trip which im sure most of you heard about (laura, sara, etc etc)...but yeah, just pray for her, kk? thanx guys..so yeah, i took a nap, woke up and went for a swim! the pool was very warm, and felt so nice...just swam for like 30 minutes, then i got out to have a little dinner before church. we were going to wait for my dad to get home to go to church, but he wasnt there in time, so we just left without him. laura and i searched for like 5 minutes to try and find a place to sit at the breaking of bread LoL! oh yeah, and i saw my SARAH DYER today!! sarah is like my older sister, and im sure you ALL know that i've always wanted one....so yeah, but she is gonna be a teacher at a so-cal christian school next year! she has NO credentials for the things they're having her teach, but i told her to look at it as an adventure!! haah! oh yeah--almost forgot me, alex, ariel, my mom, mrs dyer, and sarah dyer were all talking in the parking lot after church today for like 45 minutes, no lie!! LoL it was great..and of course alex, who feels she always has to flatter me: "noah cowart! you're wasting away to nothing!!" (LoL!!!!) she also said: "you're getting SOOOO skinny! almost tooooo skinny, its scaring me!" i was like OHHHH PLS! LoL! but yeah everyone who was invited--shopping trip to Bay Street is happening on Friday, July 9th! i cant wait everyone...i gotta get a few new outfits for the San Diego trip in August! cant wait MWAHAHAH! sooooo, didnt do much tonight, except go to safeway (laura's 2nd home), and the video store...but my mom got some pretty "gay" movies (yes, as some ppl say--gay) so i just typed away for the night, and tried to find out my username for this blog thingie, b/c i forgot it and yeah....so, im home all day tomorrow i think, unless some magical nice person who loves me a lot calls me up and says: hey, lets just jet somewhere..that would be nice, wouldnt it?

      this morning, i woke up screaming--i had a dream that i had tried to crush a scorpion, and it flew on me----so i wake up yelling and searching all over my bed for the imaginary creature..haha only me, right? yeah, basically. well tim came over today, after he had a going away breakfast with nicole..they're on some tofu kick, and i need to get back on my diet--when will i finally break down and go to the gym? hopefully i soon...i would really like a six pack by the time i have to go back to school. like, my body can change so fast, and like i could prob have a six pack within like 2 months if i worked out regularly and ate good like i should, but i dunno- im holding myself back and i have no idea why. oh well...but yeah, tim came over, we went to go and get "Paycheck", which i guess was an ok movie. he said he liked it, so i guess that we didnt waste our time. then we had dinner, and he was gonna go home early, but we wound up talking for like 2 1/2 hours (plus i wouldnt let him leave heh)...do we always do that? yeah, we do. you know, he's the only person that won't pamper me, or make me feel good--i mean, he'll make me feel like im worth something and that he truly does want to be my friend--but i mean he wont say things JUST to make me happy etc etc...it pissed me off @ first, but im glad, b/c i need some "tuff love" as he calls it. i dunno...he knows me better than i know "me", so if he sees a need for it, ill trust that he knows what he's talking about. another thing we talked about was how much, like--if someone says something or does something, i dont take it just normally--like, i make it to a point where i think that it must mean something  a lot deeper. nothing is what it seems, in my own mind-there always has to be something deeper...but thats not true. why cant i just accept things for what they are? i dunno, but i have to work on it. i feel very relaxed, calm, happy, and serene right now. and, a big congratulations to jacqui costanzo--she got saved last sunday..this is something ive been praying about for a while, so God bless you Jacqui, and ill be praying for you...well, ill be online if you want to chat, ok? byebye everyone  p.s.--i dont want to seem uncaring, but i have forgotten to post about the Welch family. some of you may know then, and some of you may not...but i know 2 of their children (Andrew and Jo), and they are amazing ppl. i dont remember where or how i met Andrew, but he is a great guy--and i met Jo @ church one week when the dave hunt conference was going on. they are an amazing, and God-filled bunch of ppl. they were in a car accident headed to Colorado about 5 days ago, and they're all in the hospital in reno right now. from what i hear, Jo is out of the hospital, with her family...christina had some plastic surgery done...andrew just had another back surgery after the pole was placed by his spine...mrs. welch just went in for back surgery again...and jack is still in coma. please pray that they pull through. ive heard many things, but i dont want to post them until i know for sure. if you need more information, you can always visit the redwood christian website, and click on "Prayer Requests for the Welch Family" link. www.rcs.edu thank you everyone.

LoL! i dunno-but i can't continue eating like this..it will backfire, so i started my diet again today! yes, i know....20 carbs a day is like death. i was going to stay with my g-ma this weekend, but i decided not to, b/c my step g-pa was going to be home...and i dont really like him lately! plus, i couldnt if i wanted to, b/c i have a hair appointment @ 4, and she gets off work @ 3:30 (in san ramon), and she already hits all the silicon valley traffic, so i just told her another time would do. we were going to plan my senior trip. ive decided to only invite 2 other people, and i already have (tim and nicole). it should a be a lot of fun if both of them go..even if just one of them can go, im sure ill have just as much fun! so, my g-ma was kinda "iffy" about the whole maui for 10 days trip...but i told her that's what i wanted. she really wants us to go on the cruise to the mexican riviera for 9 days though (goes to cabo san lucas, acapulco, and some other places), OR fly to the Victorian Island in Canada and stay there for 10 days..its near alaksa, so there's lots of whales and glaciers..but i wanna have fun (hehe)! so, its either the cruise or maui..and they're both going to be about the same price, so ill be happy (but i really want maui hehe)! then, im planning a trip to cancuun for spring break next year! i dunno how im gonna pay for it (dad will prob just kick down the scrills), but if i go---OMG its gonna be really fun! so...thats my life right now, just planning. ive gotta get the tickets for my senior trip by the end of july though--cruises are booked so bad right now, and it would prob be easier to go to maui anywayz. then, like i said, ive gotta decide if i want to go to the Republican State Party Convention on August 2nd and 3rd in San Diego--another trip that seems like fun (and i would fly--thank God)....then, i have to decide TODAY if i want to go to Denver for the weekend in July. as you all remember, i wanted Maui, but they were booked to the fullest...so, Denver?? i dunno--kinda stupid out there. soooo im really obsessed with this CD that Tim burned me! LoL! nicole is obsessed with hers too! she's even asking for more..im gonna miss her this week ("blow up doll compliments of stephanie tabor"--you've been replaced nicole! LoL!)...its got all these cool songs, and its all ive been listening to! its really cool. dunno what im doing this weekend. dad's going away to our other house tomorrow morning, and i dunno if gabriel or simon is gonna go with him, but reguardless--im gonna have some fun! not sitting @ home hehe! but since i dont have my cell for a while, i have no one's number AHH! ill live. tim will be there LoL! jk hehe but yeah. ive gotta run though, haircut appointment in about an hour...."gotta make myself look good" hehe byebye

(steve) LoL!! so great, huh? straight ghetto  PLAYA . it was nice not doing much this week, b/c im actually kinda wiped out. ive just been going-going-going like every night last week...but tonight im gonna go to dinner with marcotte. i told her i want to spend some time with her before she leaves. we might even hit up the san mateo bible study one last time--just to spite johnathan. nicole said she doesn't have anymore gas left, so we were gonna use ENA for a ride--or even tori! LoL nicole, member? LoL that was great...but yeah, maybe we'll go to chevy's again (yuck), and you, me, and niko can split something, while eugene like practically falls asleep on his plate LoL! then--go out to the car, and hope that TOXIC is playing MWAHAHAH!

      im wayyyy too tired to post right now, but its fine. saturday i went to have a Father's Day dinner with my dads parents, his brother, and his new wife (who is also named Michelle--ok, now both of my g-ma's daughter in laws are named Michele Cowart)...so yeah, we went to the Macaroni Grill, which turned out to be quite fun. came back home, expected to do nothing, and it turned out just that way. i didnt do much, just relaxed and chilled. sunday morning, nicole shows up @ my house @ like 9:40am, and i had just woken up. my mom had left without her for church, so i told her to come in, have some breakfast, and we would go after i got ready. everyone was really nice to her @ church, and she wants to hang out with jeremy and me and tim! it should be fun. so we sat through the service, then after church, had to go home, switch cars, then go to the ghetto to visit my moms parents. it was jam packed of course ("My Big Fat Mexican Christmas"-inside joke) so yeah...we left, and i went to invade tim's house. we went to LCC (Lewelling Community Church) afterwards, with nicole and myself and tim. it was actually very nice. i didnt like the way that the ppl were worshipping, b/c it seemed quite "phony", but i liked the message, and the worship was great of course. but yeah..went to nicole's house again, had some dinner, and talked until about 1, at which time we had to move to my house, b/c my mom has been trippin' about time...but its all good. tim went home, and i went to bed around 2. didnt do much today at all....went to Trader Joe's (that's my like 5th home--i have a lot)...came home, and slept...so, maybe i will do some Driver's Ed tonight or something. def have to do some tomorrow. but omg, im gonna meet my old 2nd Grade Teacher, Ms.Cross, again for the first time in years! im so excited, so i have to pick the right outfit and do my hair just right! haha! byebye

      yes everyone, thats right....yesterday was friday--which means that today is saturday. why did i say that? i have no idea! oh yeah though...more fun times to post here haha! yesterday, i planned on doing absolutely nothing, b/c tim was gonna sleep all day after work, and nicole was gonna go shopping niko. but, what winds up happening is that my brother wound up going to his friends baseball game, and then he was gonna spend the night over there--and my parents were gonna go out to dinner--plus gabriel was gonna be gone until at least 8:00pm. so, what i do is i asked my mom if i could have like 2 or 3 ppl come over and watch a movie. she said yeah, and so i asked tim, niko, and nicole if they wanted to come over and watch a movie. nicole brought Mystic River, but before that, tim and i made a quick run to laura's 2nd home (Safeway haha), and got a peanut butter/chocolate pie, some assorted donuts, and he got some oatmeal raisin cookies (not my fav, but w/e floats your boat!). we came home, and i had just colored my hair, so i kept checking it in the mirror. the coloring kit i got was the one where you first do an overall base color on your hair, then later on, you put the highlights in! so, when niko showed up, i had her put the highlights in for me. we talked for about 45 mins (all of us), then we went downstairs to watch the movie. it was ok, but nobody wanted to sit through the entire thing, so i just told them all what happened. we turned off the movie at like 10:45pm, watched some like Independent Film Documentary, then Seinfeld--then of course, the all time fav of everybody--WILL & GRACE. good times. niko and nicole left at about 12am, and tim left like 45 mins later. it was all good. i had a lot of fun!!! i cant wait until next week! im planning like hecka stuff! im even gonna go like REAL camping for the first time in my whole life! i mean, sure, sunday school camping is "great" and all--but like with friends and no adults, it is sure to be a fun-ner time (haha nice word). LoL! well, i better get back to my drivers ed. id like to take the permit test by the end of next week, and then sign up for drivers training like ASAP. byebye and luvs!

      yet again, noah forgets to post! this summer is just too amazing so far, im sorry LoL! but dont worry guys--i havent forgotten about any of you! wednesday night was softball time again, but this time, i had no sleep the night before, and i wound up getting sick during the game--NEVER DRINK SAN LEANDRO PARK WATER!! i swear i must have like IBS or something, b/c im always getting sick from something i eat!! but yeah...after that, tim came over for a while, and we started to watch Scary Movie 3! i had to kinda give him the boot @ 10 though, b/c i was gonna go and see laura...but she was out @ the movies, so i kinda had nothing to do the rest of the night-NOT TRUE THOUGH! my mom had rented Mystic River, so i watched that...very good movie in my own opinion. i suggest it to everyone over the age of 15 b/c it was kind of graphic, and the language wasnt the best ;) !! but yeah...went to bed around like 3 on thursday morning. then lets see- i woke up like hecka late, and i was supposed to hang out with nicole one on one. she went to have blood taken, and i had to run some errands, so by like 5pm, we decided we would just go to her house and watch some movies (nicole, myself, and tim). we rented: Mystic River, Along Came Polly, and House of Fools (russian subtitle film). we watched: Along Came Polly and House of Fools. we watched ben stiller get with jennifer aniston for about an hour and a half, then we decided that we wanted to go and have some dinner--but where?!?! i remembered that i had called nikolitsa and told her to come over after she was done @ the gym...she showed up, and we decided to go out to dinner somewhere! mrs. marcotte like helped us try to find a restaurant for like an hour, LoL! and nikolitsa's mom--i tell ya! she's a piece of work, but sounds like a nice gal! so we finally decided that we would just go to Main Street in Pleasanton, walk around, and find a nice restaurant. we walked around for about 15 minutes, then went back to this place called: Strizzy's! it was totally delicious. we had to wait for about 30 minutes to get a table, but we had nice talks with eachother. the waiter was so nice! we asked him what time he closed, and he was like: oh yeah--2 minutes ago LoL!!! but they stayed open for us and some other guests too! we had a GREAT dinner, and got done @ about like 10pm or so. so we headed back to nicoles...i thought we were all going to dispurse since tim had to work @ 5am this morning! but, we wound up watching House of Fools, which was actually quite well done (Mud...Dont kill me haha). THEN, we talked for hours and hours--even passed out for a while LoL!! nikolitsa left around like 1:30am..and tim and i left nicoles around like...2:45am? tim had decided that if he fell asleep he wasn't going to wake up in time for work, so we made it an all nighter. we talked for about an hour after he got home...then i went to bed around 4:30am this morning. i really did have an awesome time all and all..(and i guess im "beautiful" haha). so yeah. dunno what ive got planned for today, but we'll see. i havent been planning lately guys! you would all be so proud of me----no more writing things down in my planner. with these people, there is no such thing as planning: they do what they want, when they want to do it. so im happy i guess....lovin' it! call me  white stuff !

      Tuesday, June 15th yeah i know its wed, and im posting for tuesday!! but you guys should know me by now! i wait until the last possible second to post! that way, if something happens, i dont have to keep editing the whole darn thing! so, TUESDAY, kk?! hehe...i stayed home basically all morning, and woke up at like 10:30 or w/e. i wasnt planning on doing much of anything--nicole was studying for her honors chem final (good luck today nicole), and tim was working...i knew he would be tired. i went to drop gabriel off at ryan brown's house, then ran some major errands. went to trader joe's, hollywood video, AND safeway all within the time span of like 1hr and a half! totally rushed, but fun. i FINALLY got scary movie 3, which was like totally cool (hehe--too many good lines), and when the movie was about to end, tim calls me! i was like: whoa, not sleeping?! he told me that he had just watched "Crazy/Beautiful" with kirsten dundst! now, i loved that movie, i know i did--but i barely remembered anything about it! surprisingly enough, he asked me if i wanted to watch it with him! of course, i said YES--DUH! LoL! i had been totally bored, and i needed to watch a good movie with an awesome friend right at that point (things have been kinda bad on the old western front)...so, he told me he would be over in like an hour or so. when he showed up, we finished watching miss congeniality (awesome movie duh), and then turned the movie on. of course, it was great, and i shed a few tears here and there---didnt let anyone see though. nicole, kirstens character, really reminded me of myself: a rebel who can't do anything right. no matter how hard she wanted to change her image, no one was willing to accept that SHE COULD change, so she had no more hope--she didnt care anymore--ppl would always have that tainted view of her. tim kept hitting himself, and hitting me each time i would cap on myself--he's trying "some radical new therapy" ("what about bob?" movie line), and it seems to be working...either i cap on myself, or i get a bruised shoulder! you guys know me! come on now--im vain, so i had to stop LoL!! we're working on it though...im a challenge, i know that much is true. but anyways, after the movie was over, tim had some dinner (it was like 9), and my mom was BEGGING me all day to go to starbucks. we went to the gas station to fill up the SICKEST JEEP OF ALL TIME, and then went to starbucks. tim had a rice krispy, and my mom decided not to get something AFTER all--oh well, i needed my caffeine fill for the day LoL!! (camp--good times hehe)....after that, we came back home and the 3 of us were supposed to watch "Mystic River", but my mom flaked and went to bed like hecka early--dunno why! tim and i stayed up looking at the yearbook, and seeing if he knew anyone! he only knew like 1 person, but still it was mucho fun. he left around like 11 or so, and i gave him something i HOPE he liked, but we'll see--im not an artsy person! LoL--suzy, if you're reading this my some weird instance, remember when i couldnt even make the beaded bracelet last summer? LoL! im TOTALLY "craft challenged" haha!! well, its time for me to get to bed. ive gotta run a few errands today, do some drivers ed online, prob have tim over again, play softball, come home and watch "Mystic River", then walk to laura's house----we gotta talk, me and my sister. praying for you Laura--luv ya white stuff.

LoL! so, he said that he still wanted me to meet mr french (again), so we were gonna go over there first, just for a little while (tim had forgotten i was spending the night @ his house hehe--so i decided to play along). we got to mr.french's and met up with bobbie and evan! angel was there, and so was sophie, who i really like a lot! we get there, and they were all sitting down to dinner. i had already eaten, but tim was insisting that i wasnt telling the truth haha! so, after dinner, chris (mr.french) said that everyone had to go swimming. so he threw some trunks @ everyone, and told them to get ready. i didnt go in, and neither did like half the ppl, but anywayz, we had fun! we watched the PRACTICE with his mother in law, and just had good times. the rest of the night was spent talking, playing video games, getting messed up by daniel, and then woken up by my mother haha! tim and i went to 2nd hour @ church, and just chilled....didnt do much today--argued with the parents, then went back to church....call me PLEASE b/c i am so freaking bored ahh!!!

      i cant believe it---but today was the last day of my junior year. it hasnt clicked yet that im a senior, and in less than one year, ill be off to college--or maybe @ chabot. honestly, i have no idea what im going to do with my life. next year, im taking easy classes...6 periods for half the semester, then 5 for the rest--and also thinking about doing concurrent enrollment @ chabot, but im not sure if that's going to work out---MR BYERS (counselor) is gone!! NO!! so today was really awesome. being the last day of school, i almost cried when i left the campus...this was by far the best year of my school career EVER. no doubt about it guys--this year, ive been more popular than ever, reached out more than ever, and done more than i can even begin to describe. i just cant believe it went by so fast..yet @ the same time, it didnt go fast enough, ya know what i mean? would i do it all over again? oh yes, for sure-in a heartbeat...you know, ive never had a year so good in school in my entire life, and thats no exaggeration. this is what ive been waiting for all of my life--a good year in school, with barely any drama @ all--and thats exactly what i got. though there were sometimes i just wanted to biotch slap some ppl, and i know that there was a few occasions where ppl wanted to biotch slap me...overall, it wasnt THAT bad....im really going to miss it, but ill never forget it. man, im getting all teary eyed up here. it feels like a new beginning for me. and something keeps telling me that not only are relationships going to work out, but that my senior year will be unforgettable. i cant wait to see whats in store for me, but i have to be patient....  but like i said--today was REALLY awesome! laura, sarah, tim and myself all went out for lunch, right? but, before this all occurred, we were leaving school with all of sarah's stuff from her locker (which was all laura's haha), and decided to walk to laura's from the school! so, as we're walking, we just get lazy and thank God Nicole is right there, and whitie (laura) hecka jacks a ride from her LoL!! so we get to laura's house, call up tim, and tell him to meet us @ the ice creamery @ like 1:20 (this was like the 5th time we changed the time) LoL!! laura needed some money, so she went and asked andy for the money she needed! andy didnt have it...THEN becka walks in the house, and tells andy that she needs the $5 dollars that andy owed her! omg--lemme just say that it went back and forth for like 5 minutes LoL!!! reminded me of my house though haha! so we get to the ice creamery, run into some ppl from school that we dont like, and wait for tim to come. when tim gets there, everyone ordered their food, and we ate....the funny thing was, i kept getting food ALL OVER MY BODY no matter what i did!! Noah: " i dont play with my food laura!!" Laura: (thinking)--is that what you call it?? LoL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so we leave the ice creamery, go back to laura's, then tim and i left to go and meet Mr. French--this teacher guy who, from what tim tells me, is like really cool! although i only got to talk to him for like 5 minutes, he seems really neat, and i hope to get to know him a lot better this summer (before he leaves for china). met some really cool ppl @ community christian (christian, jasmine, etc)!! luv you guys mucho!! then, we came to my house, and my mom just decides to take tim and i to dinner, so we did that and had a lot of fun (round table)! when we came home, tim and i checked out the new clothes online from A&F (both of our store now!!), then he had to head home, b/c he has to get up @ 4, for work tomorrow! then, i went to bible study, and talked to my aunt for like an hr about stuff...she's really cool--i love her to death...then, we played in the lovel's pool house for a while before we decided to go home. im home now and hecka bored...so, if you wanna talk, pls call me, b/c i have nothing to do! byebye!!!!

      yesterday i didnt post...i had my DAT interview (which i think went very well)--just pray that i got it, b/c its very important to me, and its something that i REALLY want to do. its up to the Lord though ultimately, so im OK with that. i also went to play softball with my friends (tim & dan) at manor park yesterday, and it wound up being REALLY fun...who knew i could play so bad?! LoL!! i guess i did OK, well at least thats what THEY told me haha. i think that instead of going back to bible study (as much as i do enjoy it), its time to move on and maybe just start going to softball instead. the nice thing is, there's only 2 more weeks of bible study, so even if i HAD to choose--i woudlnt really have to, b/c softball would be the only option...hope that made sense, but im really tired. i just fell asleep on my bed last night, when i was supposed to be doing something else..i just passed out from playing baseball, and my brain is totally fried. i have "Junior-itis" as they call it...this phrase basically means that you can think NO longer, and you need to just shut-down...great, this has to happen before finals, right? ahhhh!! im gonna go insane! i have so much hw to do tonight..the only good thing about this situation is that i dont start school until 10 am tomorrow (seniors are taking finals early), but even that has a downside, b/c i have to spend half of the extra time i would use to sleep, to be doing American Lit/Us History/Marketing/Math etc etc etc....my english group is making me really mad. we have to do a 15 min presentation on the 1940's, but the hard things is, my teacher said: you cant do anything on the war--so now im stuck, b/c we can only do 1945-1949, and we have to include: Science, History, Arts, Technological Advances, Entertainment, etc....half my group basically bailed, and i didnt feel like being a control freak on wednesday..i only wound up yelling at 3 ppl. im sure that half the ppl in my American Lit class prob hate me, b/c im always yelling. but, what else am i supposed to do?? i like things done, and done RIGHT...maybe its not like this @ home, but at school (especially a class where i need to keep my A+), its VERY important to me. my teacher expects me to provide TOTALLY ABOVE AVERAGE work...more so than the other students. i hate taking charge all the time, but if i have to do it, then i will, ya know? well, i better start writing my 5 pg essay (for US History) on how Iraq is more like: Vietnam or WW2..and use a bibliography as well, which is no good--basically b/c i got all my info from Dan Scott LoL!! btw, thanx Daniel for helping me out....ok, only 1 more REAL day of school...then 3 days of finals. i dunno what im gonna do this weekend (other than studying)...its nicole's b-day, i so better get her some flowers or something....(sigh) better get going byebye guys/girls

      well, im in trouble again..i did something stupid, by cutting school on friday. should have known my parents would catch me. you know, i understand that i did it once, but im never gonna do it again, so i dont know what the big deal is. im mad at myself, b/c i got caught, but most of all b/c i violated the trust that they had with me, ya know? i really screwed up...and im mad at myself. just when things started to look good, i had to go and mess them up. its gonna be a long time before they trust me again, but thats my own fault, ya know? i need to grow up--what a loser i am!

       today i went to the country club (where my grandparents live) for a birthday party for my grandfather. he just turned 62 on thursday...he's getting up there for sure. my uncle john was there, and so was his wife michelle, and her mother toni. i LOVE toni--she is like the coolest woman (in her 50's) that i know...dude, she knows all the new music, all the new clothes, all the new movies--she's just so sick with it. so, all of us had a nice dinner, and michelle (my uncles new wife) made this yummy peach pie...i dont really like pie that much, so i was surprised when i actually enjoyed it--good stuff. then again, i do love peaches. sooo after dinner we all just scattered around the house for a while and everyone was involved in their own conversations. some of us were talking about political and superificial issues...while some were watching "Spider Man". we left there about 4:30 or so, and went shopping...of course, isnt it always that way? all the CV families (after an event) all go out shopping, right laura and sara? "mozell mozell...good things". yeah...i didnt get anything, b/c i couldnt find the shoes that i wanted, but thats ok--im just gonna hit up nordstroms again later and see if they have some more in stock. we came home, and im not supposed to be using the computer b/c my mother said that i have been "disrespectful" or some crap like that...really mom? wow, thats interesting--im DEPRESSED. i dont give a crap what ppl think i'm like around the house. if i don't feel good....WHO CARES? sooo i've been like "satan" in my house since yesterday morning, which is fine with me...whatever. tomorrow is another family function...and im bailing. i need a partner in crime, otherwise im gonna go shopping by myself or just walk around the mall aimlessly and visit ppl that i know at work or w/e. screw this crap--i'm out.    p.s.-- congrats to sarah rodrigues on her new marriage....allie's up next (GASP)...suzy, hope you read that one ; )

       not much been going on in my world, but oh well...bought a cute Diesel outfit from Nordstroms on monday--but i think already told most of you that. ill wear it on sunday to church if i decide to come. umm, just depressed--but ill snap out of it soon. not sure what it is...just all PMSy and depressed i guess...happens every so often. so, in a week parents leave for vaca. not sure if i get to stay HOME for a week, or if i have to stay at diff ppl's houses for a week...i have 2 meetings that week (one got cancelled). i kinda wanted to go to our cabin, since we rented a jet ski and all that good stuff--plus my aunt was going--but, of course...i dont get to go. screw school. on a lighter note, i have been cordially invited to Paula "my love" Emperado's birthday party in Newport Beach on November 13th. should be fun...paula, i'd love to FINALLY meet you, since we've been talking for like a year, and everyone else i know, knows you...it would be my turn. id bring the HECKA SPIFFY shirts, no doubt. sooo trying to figure out how im gonna do that....and then, yeah, thats about it. tomorrow is my g-pa's b-day party, so we gotta go to the country club around 12...but, i might just stay the night at the club tonight, b/c i just need a break from reality...get in the spa, work out saturday morning, go to the movies, do a little shopping, and just chill with the grandma. not sure whats going down yet though. sunday, supposed to have some crappy family get together over here, and im not going to be here (snaps fingers)...laura, you gotta be my "wing-girl" on this one, kk?

       guess its time i took my own quiz, huh? well, here goes...     &nbsp;    1.&nbsp;What/Whom makes you "tick"?     Mostly its just the people that i love who keep me going. they tell me that i can do it, and not to give up no matter how hard it is...     2. What is most special about you & why? &nbsp;    I would have to say that the most special thing about me is the heart that i have for people. although im sure some of you are sitting there laughing, God gave me a heart to love people no matter what they do, who they are, what they've done...even though im not always nice about it, God really blessed me with a heart for people.     3. What good things make you cry?     Well, when someone is there for me and they tell me that they love me instead of just expecting me to know it. when i am told that i am loved at the perfect moment, it makes me cry. something else that really gets me is when people that i know can read me, and they give me the comfort that i need. they dont even have to ask, they just know me...and they take care of me.     4. What bad things make you cry?     The thing that hurts me the most is when someone that i love does something to hurt me. whether it is rejecting me, or leaving me behind, its like im dying slowly...     5. Do you think it's a bad thing to be emotional?     I'm not sure why i put this question in here, but i might as well answer it: no, i don't think it's a bad thing to be emotional, but i do think it's a bad thing to overreact and blow things out of proportion...this is definitely something i have been working on and am getting better at.     6. Which is better: friendless and happy, or popular and lonely?     You know, this is definitely a toughie. in both cases, i don't think i would be happy, but i would much rather choose friendless and happy, just b/c i know what it's like to be popular and lonely...and even though it seems like you're alright, you're just lying to yourself. at least God will be with me, and that would hopefully be enough for me.     7. Why do you feel you think the way you do?     I honestly know for a fact that God made me the person that i am, and He gave me the knowledge that i have. now, as for the thinking part--that is all me. i have taken pieces of my past and formed the almost total pessimistic mindset that i had for a long time...     8. What was the most terrible event in your life?     Ehhh i can't really post that here, but i think that i've told some of you that are reading this right now--i think that i've told about 3 of you...think hard, and you'll remember. for everyone else out there who doesn't know, let me just say that you're better off not knowing. but God lets everything happen for a reason, and different people to cross your lives for a specific purpose.     9. What was the happiest event in your life?     There have been a lot of really happy times in my life that i can recall, but the most recent event was when God sent me a friend that i needed so badly. there was no way i was going to make it through another year without someone that i could count on, and that i knew was going to care about me no matter my stupidity and big mouth.     10. List one situation when you felt your life was complete?     My life will never be complete, and i believe this is true in everyone's life. your life is never complete, but at times i felt it was complete when everything was going ok, God and i were on good terms...and drama was a word no longer in my dictionary.     11. List one situation when you felt your life was a disaster?     Recently when i made a large mistake and i ran every which way to try and do damage control...i thought that God had once again tried to show me that i cant take matters into my own hands. i have to count on Him.     12. If you have a love life, what is your favorite part about it?     When i had a love life, it was kind of generic...there wasn't really anything that special about it, since we decided to NOT let people know we were going out.&nbsp;but the part i cherish most about a "love life" is that there is someone that you love right next to you, and it feels as almost they will never leave you...and just the feeling that you want this person to be with you until the end of time at that exact moment...     13. In your definition, what is a friendship?     Wow, havent we exhausted this one out? haha...a friendship cannot be defined by&nbsp;a person, and it shouldn't even be in the dictionary in my own opinion. but, if you want a definition, here goes: a friendship is an inseparable bond between 2 people who truly love eachother...their love will stand the trials that they are put through, and grows stronger each time something terrible arises. the 2 people that have this great love for one another will always be there for eachother, and are willing to sacrifice whatever it takes to show their love for one another.     14. In your definition, what is a relationship?     Definitely has to do with a love between 2 people...kind of like a friendship, but with "benefits" if you know what i mean. i've always thought of marriage as just 2 good friends who have chose to live with one another for the rest of their lives--with sex involved, of course.     15. If you're a Christian, why do you think God lets bad things happen to you?     Sometimes it takes time for me to realize that God has actually let something so terrible occurr in my life...there are still situations that i have no idea what possible significance could come of them, but God will reveal them in time. He throws these things my way to see how i'll choose to deal with it, and to help me grow stronger.     16. What is your dream in life?     Tim already knows, since i've told him, i want to have about 4 houses all over the world, my own private jet, and a wonderful marriage. i don't want any kids, but hey--i am going to need a boy to take over the Cowart fortune once i'm gone, am i right?     17. What drives you to be successful?     Perfection drives me to be successful. not only that, but also having this terrible mindset that if i don't get the best possible place/thing out of whatever i'm striving for, i'm not worth anything. if i make situations into competitions, it drives me to do my best and stop at nothing to get what i want...     18. How far would you go to make someone you love, happy?     I would go to the ends of the earth--within reason--to make someone i love happy. i would, and have, made sacrifices to show my loved ones how special they are to me...so, to answer the question,&nbsp;i would go as far as i need to!     19. What types of things would you do to make them happy?     As i listed in question #18, i would make sacrifices and give things up which i really wanted in order to make a point, and show love.     20. If your friend asks you to do something that seems ridiculous, would you do it b/c you love them?     Unless they're asking me to murder someone for them, i would be willing to do it. i'm not a sucker or anything, but when it comes to people i care about, i'm willing to do some pretty crazy stuff---just ask my cousin...we did some crazy stuff. even though it wasn't to show eachother that we loved one another, it shows you that i will go far to make someone i care about happy.     21. How do you feel when your friend says: "you don't really know me" ?     Yes, i've had at least 5 people tell me that in my lifetime that i thought i really know. the funny thing is, i really did know them, but not as well as i thought i did. they're usually using it as a defense mechanism to protect their ownselves...but in actuality, they don't mean it--and if they do, they hopefully don't mean it in the cruel way or say it out of malice...  i felt like crap when they said it, but i got over it and moved on.    22. If you've been betrayed/backstabbed, have you forgiven the person yet?     God has given me the strength to forgive them, and actually put love in my heart for them. those people that have hurt me, i love now, and i wish that they were here so that i could show them God's love for them too.     23. Do you still face rejection? Where?     No, not really anymore...i'm more outgoing now, and trying not to let what people think of me, effect me so much.     24. What is your "safe" area when you're hurting/mourning?     My "safe area" would have to be...umm.......somewhere with someone that i love. if someone that is willing to comfort me is there with me, it doesn't matter where i am--that's where i will be safe. &nbsp;   25. What/Whom comforts you when you feel like you can't go on anymore?     Shopping is the material way of dealing with pain...Loved ones are sometimes that one's that can help me when i'm ready to just give up and throw in the towel..but sometimes it's just a little alone time and giving myself some time to think about the positive things in my life.     26. Last but not least...Why are you the way you are?     God and my past...nothing more, nothing less!

       trying to get back into the habit of posting..you know how that goes, right? cool--so yeah, today was like: sick...beyond! LoL! picked laura up for church this morning, since her parents took andy down to SDSU to do w/e...so, yeah--took her to church. i was bad, and cut sunday school with ruthie dyer. she was knitting, and she tried to let me figure out her puzzle rings. funny thing is, i thought that you were supposed to separate all the rings--but little did i know that the word "ring" gave it away LoL! it turned into a ring...but hey, im from CV (which some ppl hate that excuse haha), but its true...only me, right? no...prob laura and sara too! LoL! after sunday school was over...went to sit in the "sin box"/"devil's den" (aka--balcony) with my CV homies! we didnt really listen to Mr.Lanet's message--but he's a cool guy. he's always been nice to the 3 of us for some reason. but yeah! after church, we were gonna go to my house and do w/e, but "momma j" (mrs j) told us to come over, b/c she ordered pizza. so, we went to sara's house, and watched the first disc to the season of Friends. LoL! "I once was a wooden puppet!!!" LoL chandler--def a fave among everyone, im sure...so after that was over, just listened to some music in sara's room, and.....talked about "dirty" stuff! LoL shared things we've done---we're all quite bad i guess....well, they decided that I'M bad! haha. laura and i were like being pigs--and we each had like 5 slices of pizza, and like 2 soda's...good stuff. they left for church with mr j, and i waited for my parents, b/c my mom wanted to know what was the dillio for tonight--we told her that we were gonna get together at laura's house, since they like love me (laura, gotta get that shirt for your dad with the guy holding the gun: Mothers Love Me! haha)....so yeah. came to my house after church, and after talking to like everyone. i did some chores really fast, and then hopped in the car where I DROVE with laura in the front seat to hollywood video to get some movies--and then she drove home. laura, good job today--much better than the "illegal" TP night...but we all learn in time, right? ("this isnt it...its betty's sister, donna! LoL). we got "Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights" and "Along Came Polly". havana nights was good, but not believable--didnt really get into it, prob b/c we were all talking so much, eating BUTTERSCOTCH pudding, chips, drinking soda...and giving massages to eachother! LoL! katy was soo funny though: "yeah, bump that van with the 46 inch rims...or w/e they're called!" hahah funny stuff. beka said that we were being really quiet and good (she was studying), so she made us some Strawberry Lemonade...nice job beka--good stuff btw! we all talked while the movie was running. beka ran to the store to get some cereal and US Weekly, then came home. when the movie was over, we all ran to get more food and talk to Lew for a few (rhymed haha) on the comp. funny guy, i guess--and hot, so they say! LoL! after that, went to watch a little bit of "Along Came Polly", tried to paint laura's toenails...didnt work....then i finally got a massage from laura--her "famous" hand massages. good stuff laura--ill teach you the trick to it one day soon though, kk? so, all in all it was a great day--the CV groupies are finally back together after like 3 months of total SEPARATION...well, not total..but you get what i mean, right?

       well today was my first drivers training lesson...someone thankfully cancelled, so i didnt have to wait until august 31st to take it! i was very very very excited when i found out that i got to do it today! i know like at least 5 adults who are willing to let me drive their cars! LoL...so, the guy's name is Frank, and he showed up to my house, but parked like 100 ft away from it. he called, and said that he was sitting in front of my house--although he wasnt really in front of it. oh well! there was another kid in the car, and his name was Grant. he didnt talk much...asian kid, only going to be a junior this year. Frank asked me if i had ever driven before, and i said "No". heard that if you tell them you have driven, you get fined b/c its illegal! so, he told me he would drive Grant home. so, we drove over on Hesperian to take him home--he lived kinda in the cutties. then, i had to drive around these houses like a nerd for like 15 minutes..then i got to take the jankey '95 toyota corrola out for a spin on the REAL ROAD MWAHAHA LoL! i drove really well, and had to go to like 3 different cities...took about 2 hours or so, and then as we pass my house, he tells me NOT to stop...he told me to go all the way up the hill and turn left--this was a dead end. he had me make a 3 point turn, which i wasn't half at if i do say so myself....so, we park for like 10 minutes, and he explained to me what he wanted me to accomplish before i take my driving test. so, as we drive back home, my parents are gone. as we were driving past them to go up the hill, i noticed that they were packing up our car with some beach stuff....so, i got out of the car, said byebye to Frank, and walked up the stairs. to my surprise, NO ONE WAS HOME. i reached into my pocket only to realize that i hadn't taken my key with me. i called me parents, and they said: too bad..you're gonna have to wait outside--we're on our way to Half Moon Bay for the rest of the day (it's only like 2:15 pm). im like: MOTHER FO! soooo i walked around to the other side of the house--but everything was locked, and every window was closed shut...so i did what i only knew to do: call laura! she said that she would come and get me after she was done shopping! LoL! something i would say, huh laura? haha...so, talked to mom 2 (mrs white), and she said to keep her posted if i busted in my house LoL!&nbsp; i was starving and i wasnt about to go pee outside, so i busted through my downstairs bathroom. had to take the windows out, and bust this piece of wood...and finally climb through "half dressed". only took me about 10 minutes to bust in, but i figured that i would let my parents feel guilty--so i didnt tell them i busted in. had some lunch, blasted some music, and took a nap....barely got any sleep--but "whatev" as laura would say heh! parents came home, didnt really care that i had got in OK...figures, right? well, spent the rest of the day on the comp like a loser, and didnt do much...went to the video store, but found absolutely nothing i want to see---well, i mean, i found a lot, but nothing that i would rent and watch with my parents haha...gotta wait until i have alone time to watch my indie films i guess. soo tomorrow, picking up whitie for sunday school (i think im gonna drive hehe), and then i dunno what else im doing. her parents are gone, so we agreed FOR SURE we would chill tomorrow night--dinner party, right katy? LoL sooo guess i better go and watch some TV before bed. nighty night peeps!

       everyone should be completely proud of me, no lie. you wanna know why? I PASSED MY PERMIT TEST TODAY! YAY FOR NOAH! i was sooo happy when she only marked 5 wrong on my test..my heart was pounding. i actually had to go to the DMV twice b/c of lots of complications, but it all worked out for the best im sure. word of advice: dont go to the ghetto (hayward) to take your permit test...there are some scary folks there, and its just gross--but from what i hear, all DMV's are like that, so w/e. i just got back from seeing "The Bourne Supremacy" with my parents, suzy's family, and ruthie dyer tagged along. so funny: the theatre was like jam-packed, so our families didnt get to sit together...but suzy, ruthie, and myself found 3 seats in the 2nd row (closest i've ever sat to the screen) and grabbed them before they were taken! we all took off our shoes, and put our bare-feet over the chairs in the first row! it was lots of fun...except the guy next to me had to get up twice to go pee, so i had to keep standing up when he left and came back--weirdo! LoL when the movie was over, suzy and i had to go pee so bad...here was a line from "What About Bob?" we both quoted at the same time:&nbsp;" and, i'm afraid i won't be able to find a bathroom--and my bladder will explode!" LoL sooo many laughs tonight. "noah, you dont have to be the 'clap-daddy'" LoL..she didnt even say that, but thats what i thought she said. ruthie made some great jokes during the movie--and of course, YES--its ruthie, so you know she was knitting her famous cute scarves during the movie! haha luv ya ruthie...suzy and i went to starbucks before the movie started, and suzy told them her name was CECILIA. funny thing was, a woman whose real name was CECILIA ordered the same thing as suzy, so it was SO HILARIOUS trying to figure out who ordered what (b/c one of the carmel fraps was LIGHT)..LoL who would have though that she would actually pick the name of a woman who was actually there, AND get the same drink? good times, definitely. saw jeremy walker there, and of course--he raped me with his "man hugs". after that, we just came home. kinda just working through some stuff right now. not sure if&nbsp; i'll actually be staying home alone on saturday night. its still up in the air. but, pls call me reguardless, b/c i would love to talk to someone either way! well, i gotta get going. talking to katy right now, and yeah....need to do some shopping soon--laura, if you ever call me! byes

       i know that i've been really bad about posting lately, but HEY--cut me some slack! LoL! i do have other things to do sometimes, you know--like shopping, movies, friends--all that good JAZZ! sooo i was on the phone until like 2:30am this morning just talking to one of my friends, and it was a good long talk. i finally said what i needed to say, and everything turned out A-OK! LoL! how cheesy huh? well, i just got back from the video store, and i got: Starsky and Hutch! i hope it'll turn out to be good, b/c i really dont feel like watching another terrible movie...but we know that i just love ben stiller, so i won't be able to turn it off, no matter how stupid or idiotic it is! haha....i was supposed to have coffee with vanessa today, but some stuff came up and we weren't able to meet eachother there. so i came home and kinda like "rested my eyes" and i guess i dozed off for like 10 minutes. oh well! i love taking naps, and im sure all of you know that LoL! if i could sleep my life away, i probably would---nah, too many good times to miss...member when all of us went to the beach over spring break? it was me, jeremy, sara, daniella, laura, jeremy w, karl, and dan? and it was like pouring on the way to santa cruz, and we like thought we were going to die? and then we went to tommy z's house and had burritos and laura kept spitting up her food everywhere and we locked them outside of the house when it started to pour again? and then we finally came back to my house and watch "Duplex"---"Its looser than a dublin whore!"--we all turned and said: LAURA!!!! LoL!! see? i guess i wouldnt sleep my life away, but its all good. tomorrow i dunno what im going to do. i told tim that i would go with him to find Las Positas so that he can register for his classes before he moves....and then my g-ma said that she would be dropping by early in the morning to drop something off for me. then thursday, im free but i wanna go shopping with my CV groupies! laura and sarah--dude, you guys! you know we have to go....and then friday, going to see "The Bourne Supremacy" with my family and the Rayhbucks...tim, you gonna come? lemme know--im ordering tix tomorrow. and then saturday, hopefully my parents will let me stay home when they go up to our cabin for the night. i really kinda wanna just paint on saturday, b/c some of the walls in our house are in DIRE NEED to be touched up--no lie. suzy said that she would help me...then sunday--back to SBC i guess, where&nbsp;i can hear Mr.Arnott bash on Dr.Phil--GASP!! i love Dr.Phil, im sorry, but i do! he's a good guy, and gives ppl some really good advice...but thats just me. before i go, here's some food for thought: you know how almost every movie now makes fun of plastic surgery and botox and cologen and crap? well--funny how the ppl like us paying to see that funny stuff and the ones like us that LOVE watching plastic surgery shows are the ones that are going to grow up and get plastic surgery and botox...hmm, so lets not waste our money to watch it--we have to save up to actually get it guys! thats my little idiotic-meaningless idea for today. well, toodles guys.

       I didn't do too much this weekend, but i did have a lot of fun. friday night, i called up nikolitsa and asked her if she wanted to go shopping the next day--she said sure, so at like 1:30 the next day, she picks me up and we hit up the mall. so we shopped like until 5:30, not too long. we went to jessica turk's work next to Cre-Asian in san leandro to visit her, b/c this biotch she works with is always "accidentally" bumping into her and cussing at her...so, we chilled with her until her bf came to pick her up, and then we went to pick tim up. we went to niko's moms house in livermore for like 10 minutes--grabbed some snapples and fruit--then went to see Anchorman. we wanted to see The Terminal, but it was all sold out, so we decided it was gonna be Anchorman or bust...and Anchorman seemed like a much better choice. we ran into like hecka ppl from school working there and just hanging out, then ran into the bothelo's from church--they sat next to me LoL! mrs.b always calls me "babe", its funny haha. sooo after that, i had niko drop me and tim off at my house--we watched a little bit of MTV, then he hit the sack. i watched tv for a few hours more, then went to sleep. went to church on sunday, saw everyone (and brittany staub), and chilled there. then, came home and did some crap--then went back to church, where i FINALLY got to talk to my whitie!! came home, chilled....and yeah, just got back from costco (its monday now)...so, i gotta run, but call me, b/c i wanna hang out with you..so yeah! bye!     "This ISN'T a cheer-ocracy! I am the cheer-leader--i will make the cheer-cisions--and i will deal with the cheer-onsequences!....now, you're cheer-osen!"

       Tim invited me to spend the night on wednesday night, so he came to pick me up in his "Pontiac Fiero". it's pretty sick--actually a lot better than the jeep...Tim's got a sports car!! WHAT WHAT?! Tim, you can totally live in CV now LoL hehe...anywayz, we watched like hecka movies..here are the ratings out of 5 stars:  1. Mean Girls: 3 stars (some parts were stupid, but ok overall)  2. The Notebook: 5 stars (awesome movie--im gonna see it again)  3. The Perfect Score: 1 star (guess i just watched it 6 times b/c i had nothing else to do)  4. The Day After Tomorrow: 3 stars (a little boring, but action was sick)  &nbsp;  so those were the movies that we watched...all in all i had a fun time.&nbsp; something funny happened--me being in oakland, it being like 4am in the morning, a car alarm goes off. ok, now we all now that CV ppl can't hang in the ghetto, but i had done it before...but i just started flipping out! i thought that some guy was gonna like bust through the window and like shoot me--but lately, i've been having weird thoughts about someone with a gun shooting at me or ppl that i care about. i really need a vaca, huh? but....we had&nbsp;a good time! LoL--good quotes from some of the movies! haha but you have to watch them with ME, b/c im just such a cool-i-osis person (straight ghetto). yeah, but that's a no. nicole, hope you're having lots of fun over there at good ol' Georgetown University, and that you get back safely. Goodbye to Ariel Malliaris who is leaving for camp on sunday! dude, ariel, you'll have lots of fun--but take music, like i said--you won't want to talk to everyone EVERYDAY! LoL! i'll def be up to visit you soon! **No bananas before/after/during work, got it?** and, let Alex give you a few pointers about working in the kitchen. ask her to teach you about Rachel Carlson's technique of making your feet feel better--or just ask her sister, Sarah Carlson, kk? soo have fun, and i'll see everyone later. going to berkely tomorrow i hope--if my mom doesn't flake. well, ttyl byebye     Ashlee Simpson--Pieces of me (excerpt)  &nbsp;  I am moody and messy  I get restless and it’s senseless  And you never seem to care  When I’m angry you listen  When you’re happy it’s a mission  And you won’t stop till I’m there

      it feels like its been AGES since i've posted here, but it hasnt! LoL! just one day i went without typing anything....oh well--i've moved on! sunday wasn't that much fun: church in the morning (like 5 ppl in SBC-everyone's in yosemite), came home for a bit, went to the country club to visit the g-parents, then came home and chatted with my aunt for like 5 hours! dude, i love her..she's such a cool aunt! then, went to the store, and of all ppl to run into, i see TRIKA D'COSTA! its been like 2 1/2 years since we last got together--im sure that elizabeth hasn't forgotten all those parties with all those "dances", have you liz? so anywayz--she totally blew me off, and so did her mom, who SAID she like loved me...but im good! it was just weird seeing them since its been a few years! at first, i was like: mom, go this way!!!! but we made eye contact, and it was weird.....oh well--then i came home and just chilled by myself for a while. tim called me around like 11:45pm i guess?! and we talked until about 3 or so. so funny how a week ago at that EXACT time his car was totally broken down, and we stayed up all night talking...good convo last night though: "dude, if our parents were dead, we would have SO much fun!" LoL!! omg, that was soo terrible, but so funny. so we talked, then we hung up with one another...i ate hecka ice cream and junk food, watched "Lunch with Europe", which is a European Economics show for a bit--then went to bed around 4:15 am. woke up early today and just kinda chilled...thats all i've been doing today pretty much, but hopefully i'll get to see tim this week or something--praying for your car to be cheap and get done fast! soooo im gonna go right now...gonna watch 50 First Dates tonight, so i hope its good! bye

      today was good AND bad. just thinking about why i made a blog...it was actually b/c nicole made one, and she said that i should get one--and we would MAKE eachother post! LoL! she posted like 3 times, and then thats it...but we're busy ppl--so cut us some slack, kk? soooo yeah, did lots of chores today, rented some movies--and ate really really really bad. but oh well! i dont really care. not planning on doing much tonight. for some reason, im just feeling like its friday...probably b/c yesterday (friday) didnt feel like much of a friday to me, but none the less, i had tons of fun shoppin' with suzy and stuff. tomorrow is sunday once again, and then a week from then--like 3 ppl are leaving for camp (vanessa, suzy, AND ariel)...you guys have mucho fun! if you have to work in the kitchen, try not to do the "dish machine" more than 5 times a week--trust me, your hands will be peeling from all the steam (gross)! LoL! reminds me when rachel, alex, gina, jeremy, jesse, and myself would all try and stack the cups all the way up to the cieling and balance them into the kitchen!! heh--rachel beat all of us though...she got like 89 or something. i only got like 76...camp is definitely a place where you form lots of memories, and for some ppl--even form long lasting friendships that will last you a lifetime. even though at times you feel like you want to burn the whole camp down, you'll be happy that you went...you'll be ADDICTED, and want to go back like every year!! ill be up to visit you both though--suzy and ariel--so no worries there! we'll have to hit up Capitola Mall, the beach, and go have dinner at Shadowbrooke! hey, do you know what they told me though?!?! they shut down Margaritaville!!! dude, i hecka wanted to go back there...but we can go dancing on the beach in Capitola again, kk? that was SO much fun! then myself, alex, jesse, and daniel all went to go shopping in the little shops in the city--and we got ice cream at that HECKA good little "hole in the wall", member guys? man...good times! well, anywayz...enough about how good Koinonia is! i dont know what im going to do this week. since i got my cell back, ive been having to call like everyone to tell them that im sorry that they've been neglected!! its a tradgedy i tell you--but they'll live! stacy, we've hecka gotta go to half moon bay this week for a little while, ok? good stuff guys! call me, kk? byebye

LoL!! well, let me start off by saying that i wound up going to sara's b-day party last night, but had to leave early to take suzy home...the funniest thing about the entire night was when mr.juliani came into the dining room, and i was talking with laura and silas..and he goes: "every night is a birthday night @ silas's house" LoL!!!!!!! dude, laura and i were just about dying! they have so many freaking kids in their house, its like beyond crazy, but yeah...good times. talked with vanessa for a while and just chilled and watched the "Italian Job". we didnt get to finish watching it though, b/c they wanted to watch "Gothika", which im sorry--im not too keen on watching horror movies unless i have like someone there that will "protect me"...since laura had ryan, i was out of ppl!! LoL!! good stuff...so my mom came to pick us up, we dropped suzy off, and i just came home. talked to laura @ like 2am this morning for like 10 minutes, just to say hey and some other stuff. but yeah--today, suzy and i decided to go spend a few bucks at marina square...there's nothing there, but she wanted to hit up Old Navy, and i was like: ehhh ok. so we went over there, and my mom and i helped her pick out the CUTEST stuff ever..dude, like next time you see her, she's gonna be "smokin'!!" LoL!! so yeah, then we went to dinner, came back to my house for a few hours...chatted it up out on the balcony (thats like the best place to talk, i swear--other than counters hehe), and then took her home around like 9pm or so. all in all it was a great time to spend with suzy, and i got to know her better--so im happy. bored right now though--BUT I  GOT MY PHONE BACK  GUYS!!! SO HAPPY! so you can call me on my cell now too, kk? well, ill be online for a while tonight, so talk to me why dont ya'? bye!

      just clicked that i dont have her anymore.....someone else has taken my place.....God, will you continue to teach me the lesson of loneliness once again? you are my friend, even though i have neglected you--and now its cost me something so precious that i cant even comprehend.....  "I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."  -Frank Herbert  "Fear is that little darkroom where negatives are developed."  -Michael Pritchard  (this will always remind me of that night, when i felt safe, loved, cherished...and most of all--happy that God had blessed me...)  Lifehouse: Everything   Finally here once speak to me I want to feel you, I need to hear you You are the light that's leading me to the place Where I find peace again You are the strength that keeps me walking You are the hope that keeps me trusting You are the light to my soul You are my purpose You're everything and how can I stand here with you And not be moved by you Would you tell me how could it be any better than this You calm the storms and you give me rest You hold me in your hands You won't let me fold You still my heart when you take my breath away Would you take me in take me deeper now And how can I stand here with you and not be moved by you Would you tell me how could it be any better than this And how can I stand here with you and not be moved by you Would you tell me how could it be any better than this Cause you're all I want, you're all I need You're everything.. everything You're all I want You're all I need You're everything.. everything You're all I want You're all I need You're everything.. everything You're all I want You're all I need You're everything.. everything And how can I stand here with you and not be moved by you Would you tell me how could it be any better than this And how can I stand here with you and not be moved by you Would you tell me how could it be any better any better than this And how can I stand here with you and not be moved by you Would you tell me how could it be any better than this Would you tell me how could it be any better than this

      hey everyone...its thursday morning, and at about 11pm on wednesday night, katy and laura white came over! it was so great...their family finally decided to let them help us get Jeremy Walker back for all the damage he's done to our house! i mean, you can TP us once--even twice--ok a third time--but in my book, 4th time is the charm!!! laura, katy, and myself had to show the walkers that they cant mess with us CV ppl and get away with it anymore. MWAAHAHA..member laura?: "we're good at shopping--but we're also good at causing lots of damage!" LoL! oh man! good quotes last night too. "No, guys...this isnt the street!--It's Betty's Sister Donna!" LoL!!! dude, omg, i must have been laughing for like 5 minutes straight, and at my own joke none the less. hey, what do you expect? its like 12 in the morning, and i had a stressful day! haha...so, we get there, and my mom just like jumps out of the car with a thing of shaving cream, and just starts going wild all over jeremy's car--i've never seen her be that bad before! she was going crazy...but yeah, katy and i went to case the rest of the house, and saw that there were like 3 lights on...we TP'd anyway. after we had done all the damage necessary (ie--jeremy's car covered in shaving cream, with shredded newspaper and TP stuck to it/walkers house covered completely in TP, etc etc), we decided to jet...but not before MRS. WALKER CAUGHT us!! dude, it was so scary...she came up to us, and goes: "stand up pls"--she was talking to my mom, katy, and myself. so, i stood up, and she goes: "so what now?" being the honest person that i am, i said this: "well, they clean it up in the morning..just like we have to everytime they hit our house"...she had no idea what to say! LoL! it was great (katy: "umm..we're checking out the rims") LoL! good times! soo  she goes: "well...ok then! have fun you guys" (she blew us a little kiss goodnight, grabbed 2 rolls of TP, and went inside). she promised she wouldnt tell who it was, but it was quite funny, i tell you! what a great lady--but she knows her kids are bad, and they love to hit everyone's house--good times...laura drove home that night, and i didnt fear for my life as much as i thought i would--but the second we got to her house she told us that she had never driven at night, and she didnt even have her permit on her LoL!!! dude, omg--im so proud of you laura!! my little white driver...good times. well, im sick today, but sara's party is tonight. im not exactly sure what im going to be doing, but....call me anyone, please. bye!

      know its a little late to be posting for tuesday, but what the heck? ill do it anywayz. i was just thinking about what defines a BEST FRIEND. ive heard many definitions, like being able to trust someone with your heart completely, having faith in someone no matter what they do...ya know, stuff like that. but, what really is a BEST FRIEND? it seems like each person has a different definition of this term; so my question here is, if 2 ppl have such different descriptions of what a BEST FRIEND is, then how do they know if they are BEST FRIENDS or not? hmm, thats a tough question. is it just when 2 ppl automatically click, they know that they love eachother..and even though they have trials, they know that they are BEST FRIENDS? i really just dont know. i've told many of you that i dont believe in the term BEST FRIENDS anymore--and that i havent for a while...but thats changed lately. like, honestly i still have something inside of me telling me that calling someone your BEST FRIEND is just setting me up for dissapointment...but isnt having just "close friends" or "good friends"? i mean, no matter what level relationship/friendship you have with someone, they're always going to let you down--as humans, thats just what we do (not my paranoia happening). so, since no one is ever going to know what a BEST FRIEND is, and although there is no correct or incorrect definition for this term...do i have a BEST FRIEND? do i have BEST FRIENDS? hmm...lemme know what you think...  one thing i dont like is triangle friendships (3 close friends). ive been in 1 or 2 before, and they just dont seem to do well, ya know? has anyone else out there been in a 3-way friendship that HAS worked out? as i mentioned before, no friendship will be perfect, which is the nice thing about it...problems can sometimes help deepen relationships. lemme know if you've had a good or bad experience with this, so that i can figure out whether or not its just me, ok? well, i better get to bed..ill post later on today maybe (since this post is for tuesday), but for now, i really have to finish drivers ed and just work some stuff out. sooo g'night everyone.

      lets start out from the beginning--> i wake up, pack stuff that im going to need, and go to church! i was soo excited--Koinonia is like my home away from home if you know what i mean...so i was waiting for Tim. he was a little late, but then again, he hadnt had a great week--he was really tired! so, he gets there, and weload up the jeep! yeah.....and, did i mention that some jackass from the ghetto smashed his driver side window in? mmmhmmmm..so we were driving all the way to camp without  a window, and we had to scream everything to eachother! LoL!! soooo funny. but yeah...so, we get to camp like really early (11:30am). we werent supposed to be there until like 2pm, but we decided to give them a surprise, and to try and beat all the 4th of July traffic! the funny thing was, as we're driving up there, we see jeremy's cooper's car in front of us, as we got off the Freedom Street exit! i kept honking tim's horn to try and get their attention, but then i second guessed myself: wow--jeremy's head isnt THAT big...but it was the same type of haircut. so finally, amanda pagan turns around in the back seat, and starts waving to me! we get to camp like 15 minutes later, b/c this person was driving like REALLY slow (we knew it couldnt have been jeremy), and amanda jumps out of the car all scared...then she goes: NOAH!??!!? little did they know, it was me and tim trying to get their attention! LoL! they thought were gonna like kill them or something..totally funny! it was tim driving, with scottie grant in the front seat, and amanda in the back! everyone comes out of their rooms to say hey and meet the 2 of us, and it was just tons of fun getting to know the new summer staff there! tim was having a good time. so, we go and get a little something to eat out of the ol' staff dining room, and then go and watched a movie in Brown (auditorium--Rush Hour 2). tim and i talked throughout like a little more then half of the movie...afterwards, we all piled into different cars to go to a party at Ian's house (one of scottie's friends)--all i can say is WOW...NEVER been to a "party" like that!! LoL! you guys who were there know what i mean ("Latoya"..i mean Tonya LoL!) we left the party, and headed back to camp. sarah carlson was making bracelets for everyone, and painting like everyones nails (even guys--flowers too haha), and i BEGGED her to make me one. and yes sarah! i promise i will NEVER take it off LoL!!! good times...we left for fireworks around like 6pm...me, tim, tim cooper, and jeremy cooper all piled into jeremy's "hoopty" (bringing it back into style haha), and drove to get some food at Carl's Jr! LoL "DRINK YOUR SODA!!" sarah wouldnt leave tim alone haha! "dude, i want to wait until i have my food, you lunatic!" haha very funny stuff! played around in the capitola mall parking lot for a while with the wind-throwing gun, and then headed out for some old fashioned good firework-watching! we couldnt find a spot anywhere within the ENTIRE place, which was completely ridiculous, so we had to illegally park in some hotel place so that we could watch them. we walked everywhere to find a bathroom and all thatgood stuff, and wound up finding a good place in the middle of the town to sit and watch (this all happened in Scotts Valley, btw)...so, the fireworks happen, and a bunch of ppl showed up--including Jesse..good to see her. piled back up in Jeremy's car again, and drove back to camp..hung out for a while, then tim and i decided to head home...we waited for a lot of the traffic to die down before we made the kinda-long trek home! we prayed before we left, and that was kind of reassuring to me, b/c i know that the Lord would protect us. since it was still dark when we left camp, it was kinda hard to see the road and everything, and the freeway back to San Jose was SO SLOW! omg everyone, it was the slowest traffic i've ever been in! sooo poor tim's foot is dying from the clutch and im about to like pass out or something (totally tired). he kept telling me to go to sleep and relax...so i did, for about 5 minutes. now, tims car had been making some weird sounds ever since we left camp, and that was quite disturbing, but i got over it...THAT IS, UNTIL THE DRIVESHAFT FELL OUT OF THE BOTTOM OF THE JEEP, and i started freaking out! dude, you guys....i've never shaken so much in my entire life...i was hyperventilating, and have major panic attacks. tim was just sitting there, calm--and thanking God that we were safe. i thought that i would have been the one to stay collected, but that changed. he reassured me that we were going to be fine....that is until 4 officers showed up behind us to check up on us. now, as you guys know...i wear contacts! they had been in for almost an entire day, and my eyes were totally bloodshot. thank God they didnt think we were drinking or high, but they waited with us until the AAA guy came to pick us up. when he got there, we were told that we could only get towed 5 miles...but we only had $26 bucks between the 2 of us, so he said: listen, im gonna do you 2 a favor, and tow you all the way to oakland for JUST $26 bucks. dude, this guy was an ANGEL! we were all the way in hayward, and usually that would cost about $150 bucks...but we got blessed. we got to his house, talked for hours, which was very good for us...we needed to talk--then we fell asleep LoL! my mom came to get me around like 12:30pm today, and i came home and took a nice 2.5 hour nap. just got back from shopping, where i got this freaking HOT jacket, and yeah...gtg though--byebye

      i think that i already posted about watching "The Perfect Score", but oh well...i watched it again, like a half an hour ago. today was even MORE of a good day (btw everyone, its sunday morning @ like 2:30am)...after the great time with katy and laura, i thought that day couldnt get any better, but the Lord blessed me--that's for sure! my aunty angela came over, with my cousins Noel & Vidal, and her husband--my uncle Julio. now, my uncle julio and i are kinda tite i guess you could say. we're both like drop-dead obsessed over clothes and stuff, and since he's the manager of a GAP store out in tracy, we always seem to be on the subject of fashion and stuff like that. anywayz, i had to sit in the living room for 2 hours listening to my parents tell me everything i do WRONG! LoL! isnt that just soooo great? like i dont hear it everyday anywayz, ya know? oh well...my uncle julio totally stood up for me, and he's even gonna try and get me a job hookup at our GAP out here in stoneridge! sick, huh? i cant wait--i hope i get the job! so yeah...but i had to clean some stuff up after dinner, then my mom, my aunt, my uncle and myself are all sitting in the living room--everyone else was completely scattered all over the house, so it was just the usual 4 of us. my mom made some remark about me being insecure, and my uncle straight out asked me: so noah..what are your insecurities? LoL i was like: whoa.....so, needless to say, we spent the next hour and half comparing our lives and all that great stuff. its like, this is the SECOND person that has had the same exact problems as me, the same exact insecurities as me...the only difference is, he's 37 years old, and he's fixed all those things. sure, everyone still has insecurities, but like--he's still just a teen inside (and he looks so young too!). but we talked for a long time, and it was nice to get advice from someone who has OVERCOME these troubling issues. he wouldnt let me make excuses for myself..and although i kept saying that ppl hurt me a lot, he finally just flat out told me THAT IS MY FAULT! im letting ppl walk all over me, and he's right! why am i like this now? i was never like this before, right? well, i guess i was, and we just examined our lives together. he told me that i need to be OK with myself, regardless of whether or not my parents like who i am or what i do. he did say that i still need to respect them, but to approach them in love, and tell them that this is MY life, and im going to do w/e i want...and, ask for their support in w/e i choose to do with my life. for the past 2 days, all my dad has been talking about is me going to college, and making a plan for my life! like, ive got a whole other year before i leave for school--if i do--but he wants me to plan now, which i think is smart. he wants me to be successful and rich and famous...but who doesnt want that for their kid, right? they mean well, but sometimes my dad tries to live his life through me, and that cant happen. he knows he cant do that, but he continues to try anywayz, and he puts a wedge between us, that i dont want to be there...so, by the end of the summer (more like the end of the month), i have to tell him what i want to do with my life, the colleges i would like to apply to, and see what he says. my parents are willing to support me in w/e i do, and money is no object when it comes to college. i mean, this is my life, afterall! so, by august 25th, if you ask me what i want to do with my life, i'll know for sure--no doubts here guys. im scared, but the Lord will use me wherever i go...even if it means not going to college right away. i dont think my dad would be ok with that, but i dont know...he knows i love to travel, and after watching "The Perfect Score", i realized that i dont have to be the best all the time. the overachiever (Erika Christensen)--all she wanted was to travel all over Europe for a year--and thats what I WANT! but...i dont know what my parents will say. after all, it will be there money you know. and i dont want to dissapoint them. maybe i need a year to clear my head, find who i am, and all that jazz...ive started trying to find out myself, who i am, and what i want this summer, and i know its going to be hard--none of this finding out overnight crap. anywayz, i better get the directions to Koinonia. im going up there with tim today to visit everyone, meet the new peeps, and see fireworks in Scotts Valley with my friends from Summer Staff. pray that we stay safe, b/c there are a lot of drunk drivers on the roads on 4th of july. but, at least i know where im going..praise the Lord! anywayz, happy 4th everyone! love you all byebye

AHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!! hahahah. so once again, we try to finish unloading the truck, and we actually suceeded! YES GIRLS!! GOOD WORK! ;) .....the lunch came from costco, and when they opened the pizza boxes, katy and i look at eachother like: yeah...im not eating that crap! the sausage looked like rat turds LoL! so, the 3 of us wound up eating the vegetarian pizza instead--good stuff, I GUESS. but us CV ppl are used to the better things i life, i guess you could say. the day is almost over, but i cant get ahold of my dad to come and pick us up from the middle of nowhere! bill kelly, of course, offers the 3 of us a ride home..and the homely woman, naomi glen, from church too. LoL!!! the car ride home was the best part of all, i SWEAR! we get in the "pimpster" car-van that bill kelly owns, and the 3 of us are crammed in the back. it starts off quiet, with us just checking out the scene. so, laura then starts talking about how she didnt know that part of town even existed, and we just joined in..as soon as you know it, we're all making alien voices, and talking weird. we did it for like 10 minutes, and naomi is just sitting in the front seat rolling her eyes, wishing she had a gun--all day, laura and i were saying how she looked like she wanted to murder one of us LoL!!

      happy 1st of july everyone..can you believe it? we just got out school almost a freaking month ago--wow, this summer is going to be way too short. a friend told me to stop worrying, and just enjoy things while they last (which i hope they will last for a long time), and they're right! i mean...if you dont take time to stop and "smell the roses", what will you have learned? what will you have taken away from those special experiences? hmm--i think the answer to that would be NOTHING. WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE (for those of you who like it LoL--mwa). it was an OK day today. tim came over, and we wound up going back and forth between "Dude Where's My Car", and deep conversations! hehe! you tell me how that is possible! i have no idea, but we did it, and it worked...i even almost fell asleep when we were talking in my room LoL! im just REALLY tired--but then again, im totally energized...so the second that someone says: lets go!...ILL BE SO ALL OVER IT LoL! i think that tim and i said some things to eachother in the past 2 days that have been very "healthy", as he likes to say. we've discussed things that piss us off about one another...things that we do, that bother each other...and just things that we needed to get out on the table--or, more like, i needed to get out on the table. what is there to fear, but fear itself? well, the answer to that, would be FRIENDSHIPS! LoL! next to jumping off a 150 story building, relationships (or friendships--w/e you prefer) are the scariest things to me. like, i would rather go on "Top Gun" 100 times after eating a chili-cheese burger, than get close to someone--they scare me that bad...just pray for me, once again, for the Lord to comfort my spirit, and dwell inside of me every moment that i live.   a poem that paula sent me...  Sometimes I get lonely and all I gotta do is think of you You captured something inside of me You make all of my dreams come true It's not enough that you love me for me You reached inside and touched me eternally "I love you", best explains how I feel for you...  Because of you, my life has changed, thank you for the love and the joy you bring Because of you, I feel no shame, I'll tell the world it's because of you

       I was   fooling around on the computer today, and happened to stumble across my old Xanga site...I looked at the comments posted there, and to my surprise--my good friend (practically brother) Tim Cooper had left a comment in January! LoL! How could I have just discovered that he had a Xanga site? I believe that he told me, but I was probably too busy talking to hear him...oh well, at least I found it. When I started reading it, I was quite convicted. In one of his posts earlier in the year, he was talking about how his internet was down--and right away he had the answer why: the Lord was trying to teach him that he was spending too much time on the computer, and not enough time in the Word. You're probably wondering what it was that exactly convicted me...? Well, it was the fact that he's such a young person, yet he has this special connection with the Lord Jesus Christ that I have always wanted...it's like God is his friend, as well as his Father. I see how he can just look at a situation, and point out why it's happening...and sometimes, he can even tell me what I can do to help the greuling process along, and grow from it. Now, I'm sure some of you are thinking that I must be crazy to think that Tim Cooper knows everything...well, I don't think he knows everything--but I do know that he know's a lot about the Word of God, and that he has been put in my life to help me through situations. The Lord isn't going to give me someone that is going to lead me astray--at least I know that's not the kind of God I committed my life to. But, I just thought for a minute about our church and the problems going on at Fairhaven Bible Chapel with my peirs. The people that I truly do care about have buried themselves deep in this worldly pit, that leads them deeper and deeper into uneeded drama that is creating dissension among our youth. I'm glad that I'm no longer as involved in the drama, as I used to be...now, I am a bystander watching as the people that I have grown up with destroy eachother and discrase the Lord's name. Don't get me wrong--I once was a part of all this ignorance and backbiting...but ever since March, I've sworn off of it. I decided that I would not be a part of what is bringing out youth ministry down--but what can I do to help them? What can I do to help the one's that I love, become the strong faithful Christians that I know they can be? Well, I first off have to be an example...instead of sitting around and watching them hurt eachother (which I will not stand for), I must be a prayer warrior and continue to be in the Scripture's daily. The only way that I can help them, is obviously to let the Lord help me first--and grow me into the spiritual being that part of me wants to be. A couple of weeks ago, an elder at our church talked about wanting a "double-portion" of someone that was spiritual...they mentioned that they wanted a "double-portion" of Jean Gibson...myself? Well, I want a double portion of Tim Cooper's spirituality. I want to be like Tim, in the sense that I want to be able to guide one's that I care about in the right direction, and give them the counseling that I know that Lord wants me to give them--instead of repeating the same habit of using my own PIECE OF MIND. Sure, I'm a smart guy, and I do often deal with situation's in a LOGICAL way...but perhaps the Lord wants me to not lean on my understanding--and instead lean on His undersranding and wisdom. So the words that have come out my mouth recently to the one's that I love at church--I meant every single one of them. I will not apologize for expressing what the Lord has shown me and put on my heart. I'm sure that I could have presented my explanation in a different way...but you all should know that I'm not going to tell you something if I don't mean it--at least the people that I have rebuked lately. I am not a part of the drama at church--instead, I am asking the Lord to make me a part of the solution. Hopefully other's will take example and begin to grow as I yearn to grow. We ARE carnal Christians--and it took me a while to swallow that pill. We aren't filling our minds with things above--but instead, we are obsessed with the worldy and the superficial. I have said before that the FBC High School Ministry is dying--but I will not be a part of the destruction. I will be a part of the solution, and I urge everyone reading this (no matter if you are in high school or not) to be an example of the apitamy of a Christian Youth...together, we can make a difference, and do what the Lord calls us to do--be more like Him. Sound cheesy? Well, better cheesy than untrue...

       Once again I ponder whether or not my stereotypical perfect life can get any more shittier...I'm sorry for my language, but honestly--my life is not what many believe it to be. There are people out there who think my life is glamorous simply because my parents buy me lots of things, we have a nice house, we live in Castro Valley, etc...They terrible part of it all, is that I let them believe this. My life is great, sure, I'll be the first to admit it...but with money, comes problems. And with friendships, comes heartbreaks. I have no right to complain, and I know that...each time I type on this blog, I remember almost dying in Mexico...but the worst part of it all--I told myself something there that I promised myself I would do; that promise I made for myself was to be greatful for what I have. I remember the tears that streamed down my face when I sat in VBS with those poor children, and they would put their hands out, with deep hopes that we would give them just one dollar....I remember when we put out the gifts that I ordered at the last day of VBS, and they acted as if their lives were complete...how precious those children were. But now I look at myself, and I just think--what have I become? What have I done? What am I doing? Ron Chin even spoke about it at church on sunday...he was saying that God will not use prideful people to do his work, and the Lord must break those types of people before they can begin to do the Lord's work. I look around and see the superficiality of it all...the things that I let consume my thoughts, and the action's that I display. Is this what the Lord wants of me? Absolutely not...so then why do I continue to make Him reach deeper and deeper and destroy all that I have worked so hard for? All the friendships that I have made possible, and all the people that I have become close to....if He truly loves me, He would let me keep what is precious to me just for a little while longer.........but even I know that's a lie from the enemy. "IF"-- a word I've grown accustomed to in these recent months. I'm so stuck on what is superficial, and what will keep ME happy instead of what I should be doing for the Lord. This life that I call "my own" is the Lords, and He isn't about to sit back and let me make a mockery of His name after I have made a profession, and given my life to Him--so I say. But do my actions exhibit what I have spoken? Do they show that I truly have the Lord Jesus Christ living in my heart? No...and neither does my language. When people meet me, they most likely aren't able to tell me apart from an unbeliever, either because of my dirty mouth...or the things that I talk about--even the way that I present myself. The Lord is tearing everyone I care about away from me, because I have come back to this place in my life where I am putting my trust in other's before I am putting my trust in Him again. Just 2 months ago, I remember when I just let go, and my Father in heaven caught me with open arms.....and just took care of me. He showed me that He will be my friend...He will be my comfort...and I will always be precious to Him........I am special to my Dad, and He truly does love me.......I need to come back to Him, and forsake leaning on my own understanding, because I know it gets me nowhere fast....I love you, Father.

       i had lots of fun today...here's the lowdown! first off, i woke up at like 9am this morning and i couldn't fall back asleep. i guess that sub-consciously, i reminded myself that i was gonna go walking with nikolitsa...that wound up not working out, b/c we both wound up being wayyy too busy to do it. i took a shower, got dressed--dropped gabriel off at the Brown's house, then hopped onto the freeway. we went to pick up my mom's sunglasses she had accidentally left in our other car...so, we picked those up, then went back to CV. my mom had to get her new knecklace fixed at "Robin's Nest" (if you live in CV, you know where it is)...we walked around and just tried to find something to buy--anything! LoL! we ran into Mrs.Bigelow, and she and my mom talked for about 20 minutes. then, we walked around for a little while longer...we almost bought like hecka snacks at the "Primrose Bakery". dude, their cream puffs and cakes looked so great...easy to drop like $200 bucks in that place...but, my mom and i are both disgusted with our 3 lb. weight gain, and decided to resist. we went to walgreens, grabbed something to drink, and looked at a couple of magazines while waiting in line...had to tackle my mom and grab the huge package of candy she had in her hand--the lady behind me started laughing, when i told my mom she was acting like a child! LoL! after we got something to drink, we drove back home, where i forgot to ask suzy something VERY important. earlier this morning, i sent an e-mail to ariel via pablo's email...he emailed me back like 10 minutes later, and said that he was desperately in need of some people to work at camp from August 16th-August 31st. i talked to my dad, and he's really happy that i get to go to camp after all--since he DID ruin it for me in the first place. sooo i called suzy right away, and told her the good news! i couldn't believe it--WE'RE GOING TO KOINONIA YAY!! LoL! she was screaming so loud when i told her...Koinonia is our 2nd home, no doubt. but we're both thankful that only new people are going to be up there. there were some left over issues from last summer (**cough cough...dining room supervisor...cough cough**) LoL! it's OK suzy--you and i will prob be in charge, b/c the "newbies" really don't know what they're doing, pablo tells me....so yeah, we're both leaving August 15th, unless we decide to go NEXT friday, to see Kandace before she leaves. i'm not sure what is going on atm...i might miss the first week of school (only 3 days) to stay up there with suzy so that we can finish up there...we are prob going to work there over Family Camp weekend too, b/c they're always short on summer staff that weekend. so, anywayz...suzy and i weren't invited to something that was going on tonight, and we were both shocked. so, we decided to go and buy a few things to make us happy! LoL! jk...no, but we did go shopping, and i got this hecka tite polo from Hollister just for kicks! The Cowart Family took yet ANOTHER trip to the mall before the school year begins..i think that i've been shopping over 25 times since the summer started, probably even more. we had lots of fun. came back home, ate dessert, watched some TV, then i drove her home! i've been driving the freeway like all day--and i'm SO good at it LoL! it was great fun...and yes, i DO have a "lead foot". tomorrow, i'm just gonna run around town...then thursday, suzy and i are going to Bay Street and shop it up for a few hours....gotta pick up a few more shirts and pants from A&amp;F, and i have this GAP certificate where i get like 25% off my entire purchase, so i'm gonna buy like 3 dress shirts from them, and probably another nice jacket. well, gotta run! can't wait until the parents leave...i applied at "Aaron's Cratfters" today at the Village. i think that i got the job--then i heard that Kathryn Holland applied. maybe she and i will get to work together?

       all i have to say about tonight is: WOAH (dont you mean noah? LoL)...tonight was just "off da' hook" if you'll pardon my ghetto lingo. first off, i found out that daniel scott my buddy was home for a few hours, just b/c he had the day off of camp, and so i was talking to him online for a few minutes--i also got an instant message from ray, and then from tim...and tim said: dude, you just TOTALLY blew off ray! LoL. so, i was talking to ray online after daniel said that he needed to "rest"...i didnt believe that it was him, b/c it sounded like tim (oh well--guess ray isnt noah 2...he must be tim 2 MWAHAHA! LoL). soo i was like: if this really is ray, then call me. so, he called me and i was like: you niggers! LoL sooo daniel and ray decided to totally like come over and "beat me up"...but being me, they just love me so much, i knew they were coming over JUST to say hi b/c they love me! when they got here, we talked for like 30 minutes under my gazebo, and had a GREAT time...so many good jokes. as Daniel would say, after our CV revenge TPing scandal..."You've just opened up Pandora's Box Noah"...i was like: "Sorry daniel--but we CLOSED it!" haha...they stayed for a little while longer, talked with my mom, then daniel asked me for some scissors to cut his ghetto car cieling cloth...LoL ray was laughing so hard, b/c he knew i was thinking: wow--JANKIFIED BEYOND. they left, and my 3 sisters laura, sara, and katy all came to pick me up to see "The Village". i got in the car, and said hi to katy's friend brittany--who i actually thought was katy LoL! "It's katy with a nose job, guys!!"...Katy: "That's hot...so hot." LoL good stuff you guys. we got to the movie theatre, i saw some of my old buddies from school (Jessica Fernandes, Beckie Alcantara, etc). btw, congrats to Jessi for getting back together with Daniel Marino..good stuff i guess! sooo we sat through the movie, and laughed at all the scary parts. at one point, a fly flew next to my ear, and i jumped so high! LoL! then, i was getting ready to talk to laura about something, the girl fell into a ditch, and she screamed right in my ear! haha...Adrian Broday (Noah was his name in the movie--great) was the best person. he was like mentally challenged, and he was laughing at all the scary parts--we agreed that he was Silas, for sure. LoL! by the end of the movie, we spent 10 minutes trying to explain the ending to Brittany, b/c she STILL didnt get it. we walked outside and waited for mom (Windy Chite LoL), and still were trying to explain the ending to brittany LoL! we drove brittany home, but of course mrs white cant end the night without a few "great" jokes...so she goes: hey, if you read books, we could call you "Brit-Lit"...and if you played baseball, we could call you "Brit-Mit"....we just stared in awe at the "genius" of it all LoL! laura was just like kept backing up when she made a U-turn, and it was great. so, we finally get to my house, and mom asks me if we had the Lord of the Rings movies, and i told her that we had all of them. so, i went inside to get them, and sara kept saying: yeah? well mine are fullscreen AND the full version!....laura goes: she was talking to NOAH...and i was like: yeah, SARA...guess i must have grew my hair out and started dressing worse!
