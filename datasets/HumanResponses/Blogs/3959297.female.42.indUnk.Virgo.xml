						     With the decision to remarry and agree to get pregnant once more, I knew the responsibility we were about to under take.  Tim knew before we were married that If we were to try for a baby that infertility medicine would be involved.  We talked about it alot,before and after our marriage. When we did start to take it more serious I had a visist with my gynacologist.At this point I was put on clomid, this would get my periods flowing and hopefully get us an egg to fertilize!  AFter a few months of this it was an obvious choice to go onto something alittle more potent.We visited with a infertility specialist and he explained to my husband a little more detail of my condition. I don't ovulate.  After this visit we went onto another med. and shots in the hip, Tim was, for whatever reason excited about giving me a shot in the rear. This was his way of participating. After a couple of weeks of ultrasounds, we finally had signs of adult size eggs. We decided to go in and round one up!  With a shot of Profazi 32 hours before the insemination was to take place, my bosy made immediate changes. I could hardly sit up straight, the cramping was almost unbearable.With this in mind how in the world was I going to make it to the clinic for this insemination. Monday morning we were in by 7:00 am, Tim had his part to do of course, not romantic by any means, and with the pressure on to make this first time a success, I don't know how he was able to get us a sample.  As the sample was being washed, to do away with any bad swimmers, I was sitting in a wheel chair wondering what will happen. Is this going to work? I the pain that I'm feeling normal? Should we go ahead with it this time since I'm feeling sooo terrible?  Well we did go ahead with this insemination, with 5 adult eggs we had a good chance to have one take.  DR. Sue was very excited for us, she had seen us through up to this point so for her is was a journey well traveled.As a nurse practitioner, Sue was able to do alot of things with her patients and one of them was to do inseminations.  The gratification she felt after a session and the extreme excitement if all goes as expected.  With my ovaries feeling like thay are going to blow up, and the nausea my God! the nausea. If this was a sign of what morning sickness would be like if THIS session works, I didn't know at the time if I would be able to deal with it.   After laying on the gyno cot with my legs in the air for 20 minutes ( this is not a myth) it was time to crawl off and get into my wheel chair to go home.
