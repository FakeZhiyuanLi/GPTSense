          No one knows the pain       That I have inside       That I have everyday       When the sun goes down       I think of not seeing the next day       For that I do not want to       Live to see the next day       No one knows the pain       That I have inside       I have thought about suicide to kill       The pain inside of me       But I just can't do that       To see the looks on my Friends faces       When I'm six feet under       But the pain inside hurts so much       And thats the only way out       To stop the pain inside of me       But no one knows the pain       That I have inside...

        She's the one in the corner,  The one that no one likes.  The people that hate her,  Are as cold as ice.  They say she's not normal,  Just because she's bi.  So they leave her alone,  While she wishes to die.  In school they treat her poorly,  They push her, huet her,  They pretend she's faded,  Like she's not even there.  At home it's not so great,  The words her family speak,  Doesn't make things better,  It only makes her weak.  Tonight, she's just about had it,  She'll go into her room, so cold,  Shut the door behind her,  Remember the words she was told.  "She'll cry some more,  And go for her weed,  She'll feel better after,  This is what she needs."  She'll take a long hit,  Then rests on her back.  Finishing her bowl,  She slowloy will relax.  After the high is gone,  And she feels the pain once more,  She decides she can't go on,  Living like this anymore.  She writes a goodbye letter,  Explaing why she chose to go away.  Telling who ever reads this, her feelings,  And how she can't bare another day.  She pulls back her hair,  Ready to end her life.  To end all this pain.  And to get over this stife.  She pulls out the hidden blade,  Cuts herself deep.  Without a care in the world,  She lets the crimson streap seep.  She soon stops cutting.  Ready to something more extreme.  She pictured herself hanging,  Just like in her dreams.  She opens up her closet.  Looking at the big space.  Thinking to herself,  This is the perfect place.  She wraps the rope around her neck.  Pulls out the chair,  Then steps ontop.  Almost floating in mid air.  Ties the rope around the bar,  Ties it real tight.  Thinking to herself,  Tonight is the night.  She leaps up and kicks the chair,  And it falls to the ground.  She then opens her eyes.  For the last time, she looks around.  She slowloy slips into the darkness,  Her body hanging so free.  I look down at her,  And whisper, Thats me.  As I look back on what I've done,  I look at how I've died,  Then whisper,  That was the perfect suicide.....

        I cover my bruises, As you hit me again. The pain is so bad, I just wanna die. I don't want to be here To be your punching bag. Mom knows but does nothing, In fear she will be next. So she sits there and watches, Her little baby girl get beat. You never liked me or accepted me, I always did something wrong. I hide in me room wondering what I did wrong to make you feel this way. You say you love me but I don't see how you can look at yourself in the mirror When you lie to your own child. Tell me why you throw temper tantroms, when I did nothing wrong. You are my Father and I love you, but when you hit me I wonder if I deserve it. But I have done nothing wrong to make you feel this way.....

       Dear Mother and Father, Thank you for your time. I'm glad you were there, I'm glad you were mine. Dear Robert and Grimland, I loved you tons. When I needed help, You guys were the ones. Dear Evan E. Dear Evan B. You guys helped me through. I'm glad I had you with me. I needed you two. Dear Erwin, Dear Alex... You guys were the best. I'll remember you two, By carving your names unto my chest. Dear Amber, Dear Gina, We were so close. I'll always regret, Leaving you guys, the most. Everyone else, I really loved you all, I'll remember you when I'm dead, When everything begins to fall. So I'm writing this suicide, This sweet, antisipated note. My reason is Scottie, I loved him so... But he hates me now, No more reason to live. I've done all I can do, I've given all I could give...
