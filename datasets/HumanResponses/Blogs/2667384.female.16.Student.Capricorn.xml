      Trying to be nice to a younger sister of a gap of seven years is hard no matter what your parent bribes you with. I've tried, really I have! When I pick her up from after-school care I actually pay attention after asking her "How was your day?" and I "play" with her. Well, to an extent- I don't mean Barbies and stuff ( I have a Rep to keep up)- just board games or I help her pick out a sweet outfit. I even went as far as taking her out with me today. We went into town for two hours. We ended up at the GoMa, at the kids play area where two guys of about 18 were sitting drawing cartoons. I wasn't too impressed with them but I guess some people are easily amused! After that we took a trip around the Art Store across the road then got the bus home. She was satisfied at her little outing. Who can say fairer than that?! Sounds like a good attempt at sister bonding. Doesn't it?

      Morning world!  I'm determined not to let this blog go to waste so heres whats been happening-   Thursday   I hung out in town from 11am, after getting the bus into town with my brother. I went to the GoMa but ended up hanging with a friend. About 1pm I got really bored and for some reason desparatly wanted to be at school, so I made my way up there- hoping to see some friendly(ish) faces. Other than Jamie no one was pleased to see me. I managed to pick up my Appeasement and The Road to War stuff in History and have a quick gab with Mr Byars. Knowing precisely how much studying I'd done for Computing (nothing at all) he invited me to come up 4th period on Monday and do some work. Very nice of him I thought- especially since we've had so many ups and downs in the last few months. I'll take up the offer on Monday.  Later, mum came in ever so slightly tipsy and ordered us to bed at 8.45pm. I'm not sure she had a grip of the time and place she was in, nevertheless I watched TV in my room until I heard snores from her room...     Friday    After sleeping 12 hours I was reluctant to get out of bed! About 11am Theresa gave me a call telling me there was a gig at the Cathouse and did I want to go with her. Sure, it started at 7pm. Her friend David (the stalker-ish bible thumper from Rutherglen- we met him at the AP gig with Electric Eel) had called her and said that his band were playing and he invited her to come- tickets were only Â£4 from him!   So, after a day of wandering about the house in my PJ's- pretending to be doing some studying- I was off to the gig. 45 minutes on the bus and I was outside the Cathouse with Creepy Dave and a few people holding up "No Humping" signs with little Camels on them. I think I liked the "No Humping" people more than David, at least when I was with them I didn't feel so sickened. Persistantly calling Theresa, this married man (with a child), claims he has no bad intentions. Sure.   When Theresa showed up she managed to batter my newly pierced ear when hugging me. I also got to make a new friend by the name of Claire ( Theresa's 21 year old - engaged- best mate). We we're having a crackin' time up until I asked Theresa to get me a Coke because I didn't have any money with me (but I usually pay for everything at these gigs) and she didn't make a thing of it- her answer was " Yeah, sure- Diet or normal?" but just as she was about to go up David turned to me and spat at me-  "Don't you get your own drink?- Pay up!"...Everyone just stared at him. How rude! He really upset me but I know why he did it- he was jealous of how close I was to Theresa and was even more annoyed that I was dragging her off into the toilet to gossip every so often. He knew how suspicious I was of him- as was Claire. He actually invited them to a party- well you can guess what we said to him about that! When his band went on stage he took his place at the far right of the stage, almost hidden (this was after he told claire he was lead singer and lead guitarist). His brother, a small fat creature with glasses took hold of his Guitar- now I was so sure that this guy was only a tech tuning up the Guitars but to my horror when the lights went down and back up again I saw him there...from here on in the show I watched was horrific. David, trying to be something close to neo-punk or some form of mini-mosher wannabe was diving around the stage- really thinking he was the bees-knees and he just wasn't. It was a tragidy. Now, this was supposed to be the main band- Big Up to the Support bands, you were great- but the main event was so bad I was on the floor laughing. Now I will give them one thing- Davids brother, the lead Guitarist played very very well. Other than Theresa being a laugh, the night was awful. David had managed to give me a redface without reason and my ears were abused by his so-called music.

       urlLink    James Marsters- My favourite Buffy Star! The only person I know who has a worse obsession with Spike than me is Theresa. Every inch of her bedroom door is caked in Buffy and Angel stickers. Not to mention her book collection- lining her shelves along with a few framed James pictures- nothing signed but then again he charges!! I think I should find a new obsession- but most of the guys I pick have played Vampires (i.e. Brad Pitt when he played Lious in Anne Rice's "Interview with The Vampire")...

       Tuesday the 18th of May   I did it. I got it done- and it didn't hurt one damn bit. Saturday was a most eventful day. I met an old friend in town who came with me to get my ear done in Argyll Market with two girls from the GoMa. I needed the support (no matter how much I claim to not be a coward)- three sets of hands gripping me firmly into the chair. Anyway, Scott, the half Russian, half- German and slightly Scottish, was more than happy to see me. And you should have seen his hairdo! He looked as sweet as a button with his blonde highlights but as with all gay men he wouldn't stop fiddling with it and shortly after went into a small rant over his ex-work mates.  Well, the rest of the day wasn't so wonderful. Thanks to Robyn. I don't know why she hates all her ex's so much? I mean, Liam didn't dump her and she had no reason for getting rid of him. Maybe boredom set in or something. Who knows, I mean this is Robyn we're talking about! To me Liam is just another guy, no wait he isn't. He's a great guy. Everyone likes him, that is of course, except Robyn and here I arrive to the main point. I spotted Liam standing amongst Steph and a few others at the steps amongst Borders. I remember how I used to like him- he's really a sweet guy- so I stepped up to say hi. He was very nice about it but Robyn got annoyed. No matter how much time I tried to balance out with her it just wasn't enough. Next minute I have Miriam chasing me up and dragging me around the corner like a ragdoll to tell me that Robyn "Just can't take it, AJ and Liam are sitting around there- too many Ex's at once"...and so on and so on. How childish. She was eventually convinced to come back round and sit- with several cigarettes dumped in her lap she was content for a few minutes. Soon the face pulling started but I sat with Liam and had a good gab. Much to her fury. She stormed off in a huff- several times in fact- but I merely sat and ignored her.   Later, after the huge strop she did it again! I merely suggested we get the bus to the QMU but she went silent and stared at the floor like a five year old. Then mumbled that I was ruining her special day and that she knows how to get there from the Underground at Hillhead. Well, hello?! My old school is up that way besides the fact that I'm never away from the West End! So after much huffing and puffing on the subway Mickey, Robyn and I found ourselves outside the QMU in a huge que of odd looking people ready to rock the night away. Robyn was so huffy she refused to say more than two words to me and had her back to me most of the time. By this point I was ready to tell her where to stick her ticket and walk away. Either that or wipe the floor with her! When we got inside (after Mickey purchased her own ticket) we took our seats. Immediantly Robyn ran up to the front and looked about, then wondered up to the bar for some water with Mickey- neither of whom offered me anything. Sometime later the first support band came on, I don't remember the name, and Robyn and Mickey we're off and about: toilet, dance floor, bar, toilet etc etc...and so I was on my own- babysitting bags. Furious but keeping my temper for the time being. By the next band "Walls of Jericho" I was feeling a little bit better so naturally I tried to lighten the mood. She got more angry- trying to explain how selfish she was being but at the same time trying to sound nice about it. I'm beginning to think she has nothing between her ears at all. Anyone else would have taken then hint but nooooo! Not Robyn. Bravo Robyn. By now (as you can imagine) steam was streaming out of my ears and I was ready for walking out. But then wee KD Rielly showed up! I had a wee gab with her while My Ruin was on- but I kept getting interupted by the sound of someone hocking back a fresh shot of Mucus and firing it all over the stage- yes, It was the lead singer Tairrie of My Ruin. KD and I just looked at each other before yelling "Stop spitting..." a few rude words followed but I shall not mention them at the minute! When I'd finally had enough I went to find Robyn in the crowd of devoted fans screaming their loyality to Rocks biggest Mucus cannon. She followed, reluctantly. Then I told her I was about to leave. Then realising what she'd driven me to she tried to beckon me to stay by saying she would carry her bags around with her. Too Late- I was off...  And since then I've had no contact from Robyn to apologise for her behavour or to ask if I got home alright. So much for best friend.

       Ahhh the end to another day!   Well, it wasn't that great- not that bad either! I mean, the English exam sucked; I'm still working away for History and mum officially consented to letting me get my ear done (upper right) -when I say consented she didn't say no or throw anything at me! Rob's also taking me to the My Ruin gig. I'm pretty sure its because I asked to hang at her house this saturday due to the fact we hardly see each other anymore (school work prevents us). So I take it she probably forgot all about  or  I could be wrong- this might be a wee treat!!   Hmmmm, whatever the case it should be interesting. I've been told the old gang will be there which means mayhem and mum knows it- so I'll be forced into a taxi to get home and then I'll be inspected for any signs of anything that I shouldn't (and of course wouldn't have). Grhh! Nevermind- its a night out!  Well, its 20 past 4 and I've to pick up the lil monster soon. So I had better ne off. I'll be back online last tonight but I really feel like sleep- either that I'll be at the club with Tracy, convincing her to come with me to get my ear done.  Maxay x

       Its so good to say this, so I'll take a long time to say it. I'll savour every word as I tell you. I've left the secondary education establishment for good.   Yes, thats right. Exams are over and its time for me to move on. Uni here I come!! Well, first I have to wait on the exam results coming through and I can tell you I'm not expecting all A's. English was pretty annoying- Essays were not what I wanted them to be and the close reading was tough. I've become pretty annoyed at Helen because she keeps going on about how easy she found all of her exams. I can't wait to find out her results. Well, History was pretty damn hard. I studied like hell the night before and I can only hope for a good mark...Computing was on the same day as History, lucky for me. It did not go well. I'm sure the examiners will have a good laugh at my paper. Don't even to begin to think that I'm just being silly. Mr. Byars was outside the hall and pointed out all the mistakes I'd made. I just couldn't think. Oh well! Art was annoying. I wrote about the impressionists as well as the surrealists. I winged the last part but one factor that was not helping was the damn examiner talking to folk that were finished and leaving. I cracked at Lindsey-Anne and told her to "SHUT UP!" and then Nicole who really diserved it..I screamed at her and attempted to kill her with my table. Flibble. I apologised to poor Lindsey-Anne but made rude gestures towards Nicole. I tried, I really did. Now all I haved to do is wait until August.   Yesterday was great. I slept half the day. Played about on the computer and then I slept some more. Eat a little bit and went back to bed. Right now I'm heading into town to chill for a while and as Diane would put it "be a bum" at the Galleries. I hope to see some friendly faces (hint, hint).   Well, Later!

       Theres nothing more terrifying than seeing a small child of three years old hold her face together.   Yesterday, while playing with my sister out in the back garden, my neighbours daughter (Robyn) was attacked by a local dog. Now, I know more than anyone how horrifying it is to see this happen and not be able to prevent it as I myself watched this happen to my sister when she was 4 years old- Although, the difference was that her face had not been bitten, only her arm.   I had been watching TV in my brothers room when I heard a high pitched scream and then my mother running out onto the Varanda with the house phone screaming " I'm calling an ambulance- put a towel over her face- hold it tight". I ran out onto the varanda with her and saw her mother crying and shaking holding the towel as my mother had instructed. I then flew down stairs in my socks, dived over a fence and was at her side in seconds. Her mother lifted the towel off and my heart stopped. This beautiful little girl that I had seen hours ago on the bus on my way into town was holding her face together with a cloth. Her sister ( 7 years old) stood crying a foot away, I ran over to hug her and tell her it was alright. I turned around and every child in&nbsp;the block was stood sobbing hysterically for the wee girl.   The ambulance seemed to take an eternity. Robyn had been taken inside by her mother and could be heard sobbing from the front garden. She was so brave- had it happened to me I would be screaming the place down.&nbsp; The worst point I think was having to look for a piece of her lip and seeing all the blood on paving in our garden. We later discovered that the lip was still in her mouth and could be saved. However, it looks like she may need some kind of plastic surgery to fix some of the damage. The ambulance took her to the Victoria Infirmary then onto YorkHill Childrens hospital in Glasgow's West End. Later this morning I plan to pop down to her house and give some treats to the wee soldier.   Theres currently no news of what the dogs fate will be as the owner is on holiday. I'll keep you posted on Robyn's progress.  &nbsp;

        With it being Summer and all, I tend not to be near the computer too much but I felt the need to fill you in on my holiday so far. It hasn't been great...    The trip down to Bognor Regis was cut short by a small incident that occured last Monday about 11.15am. While being in the  Butlins  holiday camp my family and I were stalked by a horrid Indian family from East London. I shouldn't mention names for legal reasons but the mother had brought her three sons down from London on a two week break which started roughly about the same time ours did. Her eldest son was 19 and about six foot five, he wasn't bad looking but not exactly a hunk. His mother, from the minute I met her, went about trying to set me up with him- making comments about how hes looking to marry a young woman just like me. A University girl. Great, thats all I needed. I was dying to tell her where to go at that point but I bit my tongue and hoped he would get embarassed and later tell her to shut her mouth. Nope, he was looking. My brother took to hanging with him at night and ended up with all kinds of odd people. Funnily enough, this "nice young 'boy'who would be an ideal husband" punched me on the side of the head, thus knocking me to the floor. The ideal husband, of course.   Well, the family started to get too pushy so we backed off and stayed away from them but they bent over backwards to try to get near us. Then the mother was getting noticibly more irritated by our ignoring her. She approached my sister and I as we went to breakfast on Monday morning (about 10am)- she made comments about my sisters clothes (not sure why) and then when I asked her what the problem was she answered " Your all psychopaths, tell your mother to watch her back". I didn't think she meant it literally. While at the phonebox at 11.15am she sprung up on my mother and I (my sister was in the phonebox with mum- I was outside it) while mum was calling Scotrail to book tickets to get a train back up because by that time we'd had enough. She and her eldest lead an attack on my mother and I until security personel were forced to help out. No, they didn't come running, despite my sister being in hysterics. I'd taken a few serious knocks to the head and had been pinned by my inner left thigh with the aid of a Stiletto heel. The bruises and bumps are still present, this being a week on. I tried to defend mum but I was beaten down too much. Her with her bad back and all I didn't want to see her get injuried by these lunatics. I tried but if I had to do it again I would probably have kicked the ... bejesus out of the eldest. I hesitated, knowing that I could be charged for assult too.    They were put in the cells until 12am later that day. The real names of these people can't be found. No National Security Number, no real last name or first name. I'm trying to sue  Butlins  and get criminal damages paid for all I suffered.    I'll keep you all posted on whats happening with all that.
