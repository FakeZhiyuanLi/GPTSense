      Nodes of life as it spread through my nerves end. The fascinations of love spreads through the eternal ramal of my self, juggling it ramp life into my body.   Strange my own heart beat shivers down my spine as a twisted wreck of my own self. Strange as I drive my lines on this screen I find the total voidances of life as felt in my love. It’s a creeping shadow of life, which spreads its fangs. Crushing my will to the verge of helplessness. Smile! Do smile that’s what you are made to do. All you can do is smile on my stupid remarks and dislodged logic that I perceive in my mind. Cultivating my lifelines as a joke and humor that entertain you and your friends.   Amuse, your thoughts through my anxiety and frustration that hibernate in my mind. The corrupt reflection of my life as it stands. Some time it’s hard to look though me, which have been your excuse for some time. Sad by the thoughts of conflicting minds and judgment, it’s hard to reconcile the most important factor that stands both our ways. Trust seems to be in short supply, don’t you think so my Dear? How small these words are “Love” and “Trust” but look now, we are like battered goats horn locked into some wild aggression. Fighting in a Glasshouse full of hope, and expectation.   Thrashing the very essence of what ever we have tried to build, aggressive in our means and deeds, we dam care for the ones that look upon us. Some scream with joy, some in tears, some with a monolithic smile. Offensive we stand shredding our own flesh and hearts. Who care? Does any one care? Do you care? Do I care? Look into my eyes, look! Don’t you see me, don’t you feel my desire, my wants, and me. Am I still alive in eagerness of my love? Will some one help me?   Why is it so Cold? So Damp! Why do I feel so compressed? Why cant I breath freely? Why do I smell decomposing flesh? Peeling my eyes harshly to see around, all I can see are the wood planks jabbing on my face. Am I in a box?    “Curse my soul as I am dead and buried” Yet my Desire tends those flowers that adore my grave.

       Heart of a Worm. 	   		 Against all odd I have come to the fact that there is no love that can ever sink into the sanity of this spirit. Wondering for the obvious landmarks of this anxious bond. I find it hard to navigate through the mist that surrounds this whole affair.   Strange may all this be, adventure and the hard facts that take all the ill accounts of my self and my circumstances. Is there any help, forsaking head on. For an outlet other than to compromise the sheer ambiguity of total defeat that stands on my face.  Strange is the way of this whole affair, when counting those atrocious one-day stands, looks more like an idiotic affair then a procurement of mutual satisfaction.  Is this self-satisfaction, masturbating, whispering in deep breath my name as a notion of finding one owns lost love. Sadistic of all the  act of, molestation of souls. Is this a hysterical love affair. Is this congenial love for each other?  Are we sure that, this whole issue,  a decayed, crumbling, corrupt, devilish act of self-satisfaction, neglecting the other half.   Feeding one own self, in an ugly act of selfishness, a classic act of grabbing the best for one own self. Withholding all rules and moral acts in one owns favor. Is this not strange? You know that I stand all-alone. And the worst of opponent is my own emptiness. With difficulty I stand in my vacuum, whatever life I have you make best use of it and make your run.   Knowing you neglect me. As always leaving me high and dry.   I do not understand, how do you face your own self, before the morning mirror. Don’t you see those set of beautify eyes, abusing you. Don’t you read those bright lively set of eyes? How can you neglect your own eyes? Does not your decaying soul react to those bright lively eyes?   Strange, are your ways letting me bleed profusely, on my own doorsteps? Knowing very well that.. it has, always been a doomsday experience for me. Yet you repeat your lines day in day out. Confessing your own deeds as pious as ever. Cooperating in your will never to forsake me for the rest of your life, while I heel and recover my shattered pieces of my soul. You walk back into my life, as hard as ever. Stomping with your heartless heart on my soul, you march in. As ever before, I know! As guided by my own self to show a brave face. Fearing for my self, I take a step back knowing its all a drama. Things will roll back, and I am history in a day. Yet some how I forget and like a worm I drop on to your feet. Knowing that I be kicked the next day.   Essentially I hardly feel the pain any more. But the hardest part for me is to recollect my soul; it’s like picking broken glass with your naked hand, a hand with out any fingers. Pretty hard my Dear, but never shall you ever understand my point. Nor do I wish to speak on this issue. Let me have my open space. Give me time to recover.    What interest me in this whole process of mature ness finding that Glass and one own Heart is made of the same substance. Both are made to thrashed and shattered across one’s life, for satisfaction

       Simmering heart, dried lips, and dusty eyes. Scorn my self for such words. Who cares if I have Runa by my side? Bright blazing sun turns into cool moonlight, “just call me” this is what Runa always use to say in her soft voice.       Beside my numerous letters and passages, I feel its time some of my readers knew who is this women called Runa.  Don’t get me wrong, she will not be disclosed in physical constants. But in an abstract form for you all to visualize the fear factor that one needs to under stand. The very contour of one owns self. Are you getting my point? If not then in simple words, I will not pass her email or her Cell number nor do I wish to pass her body parameters. Remind me if you have ever seen an Angle in real life, most have yet to go beyond the Angles scribed on the Church walls. As for me, I have lived with an angle, so to measure her heart or her physical character in real term will result in character extermination. Don’t you agree? Let move forward a step and try to follow me as my path twist and turn defining Runa. Pray that I be able to scrip a picture of her in your mind. Try to understand that some sensuous colors can’t be seen by the naked eye. Runa is one such. Always believe in your heart, and the radiant colors it shed.  	 For whom I write all these lines. Who happens to live somewhere near my houses in Karachi. Surprising she did not live far, I could feel the squeak of her slippers, every time she walked on that hard concrete musk floor. Maybe in physical terms she was far from me, but in real heart time. I was so near to her that I could feel her heart beat pulsating next to mine.   For some this could be a crazy way of explaining some kind of meaningless love story. But she sure was near to me. Sinking into my heart pulse. Is this not strange or a God gift that she knew my needs ever before I could even understand life. She was the one who conceived me, like a mother in some sense. Her emotions were deep but the flow was such that it did not have any threat. Her soul adored in self-sacrifice and the will to be joyous at all time. Her phantom smile that stood pledging man to follow her into their graves. Was her greatest asserts, But never was she able to cash her bounds. Or may be she did not wanted, such worldly affair affecting her soul. A soul richly infected by the pleasure of love and slender laughter. She was named Runa, by all those who knew and loved her.   Striking richness in all her colors, she was mine. Few moths, did try to please them self, strangely they were successful.  Their flare and songs did impressed Runa, but exquisitely she stood to me, at all times. Knowing I be her protector. This is Runa, and she is mine forever?  Stretching my self, beyond my existence, in my words and in my phrases. Does her resemblance resemble her? Do I justify her looks her deeds her action into words. Do all these lines reveal sanity of my self, justify her character. All I can proclaim with pride is, these words do resemble the dust of her walk way.
