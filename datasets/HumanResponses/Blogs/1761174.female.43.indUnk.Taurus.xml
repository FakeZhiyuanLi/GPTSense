      I found a nifty little website called sentonline.com, which is a random collection of pictures folks have taken with their camera phone and sent in to the site. Some of the pics are very good. Utilizing a transloader, webscissors.com I may be able to put them on this site.

      Through a Glass Darkly  Dusk. At first the sound was  drowned out by the rain,  then as coolness faded and damp heat returned, so did the calling of locusts on either side, somewhere, front-to-back which direction, cant tell, really I'm content just marveling at the fact that they are speaking in stereo tongue some udecipherable language incoherent to us humans. Later, as darkness gains momentum and substance there will be the clouds at the streetlights, moths and others of its kind, following some ancient pre-programmed instinct each with their own separate flight log, some even on a kamikaze mission, but  most soaring a different holding pattern, the effect, a chaotic buzz, as one seen through a glass darkly  and then set free back out into the night air.

      Last night at Barnes and Noble almost turned out to be a complete waste of time. I say "almost" because at least I got to talk to a good friend of mine while I was there, and I picked up a suspense novel that looks like it might be pretty good, Quietus by Vivian Shilling. What happened at the bookstore was that I was all set to come to the poetry reading and participate, and even called up there way beforehand to make sure the thing was still going on. So when they said "Yeah, it looks like it's still on for tonight." I said "Thank you," hung up the phone and high-fived the person standing next to me, which was my son, who also went with me, by the way. But after I got there and waited, it didn't look like anything was even set up to go on, I asked and they told me that the person who was in charge of that had taken another job and possibly the event would be on hold indefinitely. I really wish they could have told me all this over the phone. But - live and learn, I guess. Next time call 2 or 3 times to make sure. Then this morning I tried to post a message in one of the groups, and I noticed it didn't take so I thought it might have just been a glitch or something. But when I checked my email, there was a delivery failure notice for that very message. It seems that it violated some kind of policy, which I don't understand because it wasn't spam, and I didn't post any inappropriate pictures, and I didn't threaten anybody, so this is really weird. It just seems that the gods of censorship are working overtime today. Lol. So now the good news... It's not really official yet, but my daughter has been accepted into Brooks Institute of Photography. She's really kind of nervous now about keeping up the GPA. She'll do fine, I have major confidence in her, even when sometimes she has trouble generating it for herself. Plus, I told her that I'd help out on any project. Which so far has been the animal cruelty laws issue for that big paper she has to do.

      I forgot to mention how yesterday after work, my daughter was waiting for me. Actually she called me on my cell phone while I was still doing a dismissal. The first words out of her mouth when I got in the car was, "I need your help." So we went to the animal shelter to get some info on contact people who would have answers about local animal cruelty laws. Well, that's her senior project, a paper on this topic. And I told her I'd help in any way I could. It turns out that yesterday she found out that one of the planning sheets for this project was due the next day, not Monday as she'd thought. So there we went, but by the time we got there, the person she most needed to talk to had already gone for the day. Anyway, she had to be home by a certain time to recieve another call from Brooks. And I went online searching all the local shelters, and contact people. I came up with quite a few pages of info. So I guess that's part of what I'm going to be doing at the library today, among several other things... You know, I'm really glad she picked this topic as her project because I have a feeling that helping her out with this will also help me out too, in the long run.

      They scheduled an inservice today at work. Vi told everyone, "if you see 9999 on your pagers, come back down to the storeroom." Well of course everyone thought the worst, you know. It turned out that  they were just having Andy from Lee's Summit come and demonstrate some new taski-type mops they got for everybody. By the end of the day, there were at least two people who absolutely hated them. But I've used them before at North Kansas City Hosp.  I happen to think they're a heck of a lot better than those raggedy old string mops we'd been using. Bye the way, I should be asking Andy the next time I see him if he wants me to store away those pillows I find every now and then that are from Lee's Summit. Hahaha! Some of them I've even labeled "Property of LSH" myself! I wonder how they ended up all the way out to Indep. Regional. lol. Thieving ambulance drivers most likely.  I've got an extra day off that I didn't find out about until today. That means I'm off Friday, Saturday, work Sunday, off Monday, then have have three days on till I'm off again. But they STILL haven't posted my October time. I hope this isn't their way of somehow getting out of it. That would be so lame. Dun Laoghaire has been accepted into Brooks, as far as I know... there was to be another phone conversation with a student administrator this evening but I'll have to wait to find out how it went.  So keep your fingers crossed, everybody! I have another poetry reading tomorrow night. This will be my second one. I may still be a little scared, but at least I'm not petrified like I was when I first got up there. I'll be by myself I think. My daughter has a church retreat to go to. My son, I don't think he'll want to. You know, it's probably something of a test... I can handle it.

      A few days ago on one of the yahoo groups I post on, someone commented on a recent poem, I think it was "The Purging." Anyway, the person said that some of the images reminded him of the early days of Everquest. How very ironic, this, a videogame. That most definitely was not the effect I had in mind. But oh well. Live and let live... Let's hope that's as far away from me as possible. Right now I feel life is like that U2 song, It's a Beautiful Day (don't let it get away) where all these bad things keep happening, but the attitude of the person is not that negatively impacted. I mean I've some material things and just today a source of transportation. But like someone said, when one door closes, a brand new one opens up. I feel I'm on the verge of one of the most exciting times of my life, in the midst of near-poverty. And I'm happy about this. It all comes down to one thing. The things I was so stressed and sad about last night turned out not to be as bad or as final as I thought. At least I hope they stay this way. Keep praying. Strange for me to say since I haven't usually been all that religious in my life. But when things are important you learn to look toward something bigger than the self, and place your desparate hopes there. I really do hope I'm not just fooling myself, but I don't think that's how it is.

      Over the weekend: My son convinced my daughter to cut his hair into a mohawk, hmmm. My daughter is going through an unemployment crises, and believing lame interpretations of computer read-outs are personally accurate. Hopefully I convinced her that's not the case.  What else is new... the co-worker who lost her son in the accident finally came back to work. The supervisors say she can stay out of ICU however long she needs to. The big news we were all supposed to get about our jobs on the 21st never happened. They have delayed it all yet again, this time till Sept. 1. Seems to me they are testing loyalties here. I am so ready to go elsewhere anyway.  I spoke to some people I haven't heard from in a while. A lady I used to work with out at the Groves, the nursing home right across from the hospital. And a friend who lives in Florida. I guess their advice would be valid if they really wanted to know the whole story. I don't know. It seems I'm just stuck in this situation that I want so much to be out of already but every avenue is blocked.

      The Purging  I am not running away, this place is sanctuary and casts influence to find consolation alone. I am not running away. This is where a shaman  goes to heal the self, rid the pain of too much loss. For the journey this time turns again through an early September, runs rampant to a hard ending in November. It's here, when I'm ready, when it becomes too great. I can stare it down, embrace it, birth it out of me daily if I have to. Right here on the coolness of sand where the leaves would have turned and the boardwalk has been shut down. I will find no distractions in placing turquoise, amethyst, rosaries, bury turtle pins and charm bracelets. This time it will be Asbury Park turned my Callanish.

      I've been having these dreams lately, that could have a connection to something. I'm almost afraid to find out, but I'd need specifics about certain things in order to be sure. Last Saturday morning - this makes it exactly a week ago. I told a friend at work about the dream itself. Now it just feels very spooky to me if the conditions turn out to be valid ones. Just that fact alone, I mean.

      I never told anybody exactly how he did finally leave this world, Shawn Peacher. I didn't hear the details until much later. Well they did eventually "pull the plug" on him. I don't know why that bothers me so much, I just think they could have waited a little longer. I know it's a long shot but people have been known to come out of such a condition. I also never told anybody that once, from right outside his room I actually did see him move, a couple of times. And on one of those times I did find myself holding my breath, thinking that he could very well be taking his last, right then. And I looked around to see if any of the nurses noticed this, and at the same time thinking that machine will start beeping an alert, but that didn't happen. Would it have changed anything if I'd have gone to Debbie and said something - anything. I wanted to, but didn't because it might have been considered an intrusion. It's been said that we "never know what we would do in a certain situation until we actually do it." I was caught up in the moment but backed away after a second thought. How many people have backed away like that in their lives. How much would it have changed, really if they hadn't. So many unanswered questions. Anyway, I wrote the poem "Unspoken" and plan to read it next week, because its another one of those things I feel very strongly about. I've even considered asking a friend who wrote a similar poem if I could read that one too.  Well enough morbid scenes for today. This has just been where my mind is at lately.

      Because  I would paint you  in shades of silver and colors of the ocean to match your moods and all the beliefs I remember and fell in love with when I found you. I would paint you free like herds of wild mustang traveling the great plains,  which thrive in the open. I would paint you sweet  like grapes in Visalia orchards. Like the wine, like the songs I treasure most, because of  what they remind me, Irishman. I would hang this canvas in the sky, in the Rockies, or at the shore, and let you go because I love you deep.   Bailey August 21,2003

      Surely  Sometimes words are just  simply words and a poem is just a poem There are no direct speeches except now, to myself... Get over it and on toward the exist and then live part,  exist and then live, surely there can be no perpetual constant one or the other (That's right, but don't call  me Shirley) Because for now I've got ten thousand stories to tell that I'm still not done living through yet. Because  I will always have a story to tell... ones of  shooting stars and bears in  the woods, of Sir Ozzy, of bus fantasies and of what  noise, if any. a tree makes  when it falls alone in the  forest.    hahaha, I'm sure this one doesn't make any sense, and for some reason I felt compelled to put in a quote from Leslie Nielson in Airplane.

      I haven't been myself the past couple of days. Maybe its the heat, or stress. Or maybe just my own insecurities. But if I came off sounding unduly urgent to anyone, I sincerely apologize. I have a feeling that things will even out soon enough. And even if they don't, it won't be the end of the world. So now onto the task at hand, which is always a challenge. "I have a story to tell." I need to pick a good one for next Friday. Remembering Moulton?  Nah, that's too long. I will come up with something, maybe even something new. Remember this: Spoken Word rules...

      Through This  Hope stolen from a  callous soul may cause it to cry for a day. Take the hope from  the soul of an empath, she will never recover. I still don't understand What good can come of this. I'm wearing my insides out, a reversal of vital emotion and defenses. Here, these  walls have crumbled and  understanding can no longer be found when I look for the vanished meaning  of courage.

      The Sound Of His Voice  Today has found me confused lost, wondering, waiting wandering, searching so lost. What would I be then without the possibility of you. Should have been more careful in what to wish for Ask and you shall receive a flood of heat and desire. I close my eyes and allow the images remembered to take hold and send me transfixed to  another place. Now that such a gift has  been released in a sense  I know that his pull is one of pure addiction that seems to know before I know myself how badly I  need the sound of his voice  in my ear, that calming effect for when my thoughts are  working overtime and blocked  words threaten to tumble out to hang in the air, each batting against others in a rush of  convoluted meaning only he can decipher with just a few words  of his own.

      Its the worst thing in the world to be blocked from writing. Either from someone sneaking up on you to look over your shoulder, or with all the unwelcome prompts to "hey, check this out.. you gotta see this." I'm afraid. This is too damaging to me, this being here in a situation that's never been what I really wanted. I should have listened to people years ago when they told me this was not the future for me. But I was too stubborn to listen. It was my mom. I should have listened. Now I'm stuck in this  terrible rut with no hope of getting out of, save some major disaster, some upheaval. Why should I wait for this now. I deserve living my life the way I want with the freedom to write whatever the words say, no fear of retaliation. This is just another form of control. Home-based censorship. For years I've been trapped like this. Five years too long. I finally get my writing back again, I'm not turning loose of this now. Damn all the having to seek out broken minutes to myself just to be able to write a single line. I'm unsure and afraid, but I know all my words are true. That has to count for something. I'm afraid that the concept of patience has run out, leaving me to wonder how could I handle this. My one much needed source of courage has vanished. What could I be now without that possibility. I am so close, I can't give up on this. Don't give up on me.

      I've been kind of busy this weekend, trying to keep up with all the messages and ideas everybody's throwing out to everyone else, about the group. I was so excited about doing all this, I think I got way ahead of myself and started my own group. I think it'll be ok, though. I won't be trying to take anyone from the original group. I'd rather keep mine small, to keep more of a close-knit feel to it. I've seen some really good poets on Xanga, so that's where I plan to go for membership. So if anyone's interested, feel free to visit baileys_java_cafe at yahoo groups.  Well after spending all this time on the internet, I feel kind of blah today for some reason. It might be the heat. I think it got up past 102 today. And no relief for tomorrow either. At least there's a window unit and a fan here.  I wonder if everybody finally got their power back on in the east, out toward New York and other areas. I sure hope so. And hope everyone's still doing ok.

      A day of shopping and filling out employment applications yesterday, for my daughter and son, respectively. At the "Center" looking for school clothes and underwear.  Hahaha... I dare anyone to ask "dun Laoghaire" what she wore on her head in the car while driving, at least half the way home. I was kind of embarassed but at the same time laughing so hard... It was craziness, I tell you, these young whippersnappers today, having fun. What's the world coming to? The two older ladies in the car next to us gave a shocked look, the one in the passenger seat covered her eyes. Oh the shame, the shame.  But the way I see it, my daughter can do anything she wants. I know for certain that she is not on drugs, not wanting to be in a gang, not going out and having sex, not stockpiling weapons to shoot up a school, not drinking and driving or any of those things you hear in the news. My daughter has become a free spirit, but with a responsible attitude, a decent concience and I'm very proud of her, even if she does *giggle* occasionally wear a thong bikini for a hat on the way home from the mall.

      Time and Trepidation  When you hear them say time heals all, remember that they've only forgotten  how time can also obliterate  a near lifetime of memory and belief, a faith, a path, a wonderment at what was thought lost forever is now being rediscovered slowly and deeper, deeper I fall into  the chasm of uncertainty. As unattainable as you are at this moment, and as mysterious as I can be without meaning to be and avert my gaze against the  possibility of missing some precious something presented so full and so  real but not yet surely within my grasp. Yes, at this moment I am afraid the time will come I will have been erased because of my  fear of yet more loss and failure.

      A lady at work was telling all of us at break this morning about a freaky experience she had up on 4 North. That's part of a separate wing, way at the other end of the hospital. The 4th floor of the North tower is used for long term patients, some even bedridden. Well she was in a patient's room cleaning it, and she thought she was asleep, she heard her breathing and everything but she kept smelling roses from in the room, so here she's looking around for these flowers and there's none in there. So she goes and checks some of the other rooms for the source and none of them have any flowers at all. But every time she came back into that room there was a strong scent of roses. She finished cleaning and went on to the next few rooms. Then found out a little later that the lady had just died. And the realization that she was in there working either right before or during. That would be freaky just by itself. But how do you explain the rose smell in the room at the time? She says it had to have ben someone coming for her to take her to heaven.   I have heard stories like that before how somethin like that can happen right before a person dies. This one is pretty tame, compared to some I've heard. I don't know whether or not I believe in them. But now that I think back, not one person I've heard relate such a story has ever had a reason to lie about it. So there must be something to it.

      Work went at a steady pace yesterday. I really like when it's like that, it just seems to make the entire day go faster. I was in the ICU area, and probably will be today. I'm glad that they moved so many out to another floor, it just means they're getting better - that's always good news. Also got an invite to join the moderators in one of the yahoo poetry groups I'm in. It seems they want to get more input on some for new members to interact with the rest of the group. I think I'm really going to enjoy being a part of this, I'm excited about it. I guess the Xanga site has really been having some major problems lately. Something about a series of DDOS attacks, which I take to mean somebody has been infecting the site with some kind of virus, over and over again. They say they're in the process of getting it back up, but I just wonder what all that has done to my posts on there. Well it's a good thing I have my own copies of everything important. Even if I've lost them on Xanga, I know they're not  gone for good. I can still repost my poems somewhere.

I hold the elements of such feeling in another  safe place deep within the core of my existence.

      I wish I hadn't ever thrown those old poems away. Geez, I don't even remember now when that was. I do know that it's probably one of the biggest mistakes I've ever made. And I'll probably still kick my own butt over it from time to time. It was an entire notebook of poems I had, representing two creative writing classes, complete with instructor comments written in the margins. He'd said he liked the way my mind works. Well I did keep one of them I had turned in for the class (I couldn't bear to  part with that one since it was the first really good one, I thought) And I still think First of Thirteen is in a class all by itself. The day he read it for everyone, he asked for comments and when none came he said that it took him a couple of times reading it before he caught on that it was about "writing" itself. Then he looked at me and said "that is the message here isn't it?" I nodded, said "yeah" when the truth was I didn't know myself, what it was about. I'd worked on it for days, I think I rewrote it by hand at least fifty times. It was during my "Warhol" phase. At the time the images were the most important thing. Images and the flow. I had to get the images right, I mean Warhol was all about images so I had to do it justice. (without the luxury of a camera, that is.) And I just realized something here. 1) I'm rambling again and 2) lacking a means for images seems to have been a recurring theme.

      Aaahhh... Is it still only Tuesday? This week is just dragging. It's like time is in slow motion or something. It was like that at work today. Well some days the motto goes a little something like this: "Wait for it... wait for it..." (patient room dismissals). Then at about 3:00, it's "Hurry up and get these things done." I once had four stat cleans that came in at the end of the day. Impossible, especially when they expect you to clock out at 3:30. Oh yeah, it's also interesting when a nurse will put in a stat clean in bed tracking so that when it comes across the pager, you rush to the room only to find they haven't dismissed the patient yet. Whoops, somebody didn't check first! Lol. Does it sound like I'm complaining? I'm not really, at least I didn't think so but now that I look over this, I can see how somebody could get that impression.  I'm waiting for it to get dark out. I hear there's glitter storms and meteor showers due later tonight. Hope I can see a little something anyway. Wouldn't it be great to get a shot of the full moon at the same time as Perseids?  I've never taken nighttime shots like that before. I don't think its possible with a throw-away camera. I'll just be glad if I can see half a dozen shooting stars. I'll have to tell Laoghaire about this... Wow.... Cool... Double Wow... Double Cool (in a hushed awe-struck whisper) I'm going to tell you all my classic "shooting star" story from a camping trip one year at Shaver Lake.  But not now. For now I'm going to hammer some words out on paper.

Know what you're doing, "not do" these things elsewhere now I know you're about to tell me none of this is true, but the word "denial" is written on the wall. Snap this away from me. You won't and I can't  live like this because you drain the life out of me. A tick, a leech, a parasite  that's taken it's toll. You can't, won't, say you will, then don't have half a decimal of a point to  respect either you or me.

      Best Buy just might turn out to be Dun Laoghaire's new best friend. The interview has turned into a 3-step process, with the first one ending with a very promising potential opportunity. Two more to go.           Not often will an employer offer as much feedback, and I hear he was very impressed in terms of leadership experience and the fact that she knows a bit about computers.  So Laoghaire, if you're reading this...You go, girl, I'm proud of you! They'd be a fool not to call you back.

      Well at work, the big guy is back from vacation, that would be the general manager of environmental services. And No one's heard anything from him yet about who might get the axe. I'm not all that sure if that would bother me. There was a time when something like that would cause me to panic but, hey. I know I'm an excellent worker. When I was still out there at Lee's Summit, the (same) GM told me I was a model employee. So even if a decision like that is out of his hands, he'll at least be able to give me a pretty decent reference, no matter where I go next. I guess we're still gonna have to wait till the 21rst to find out.  For some reason, I ended up missing Def Poetry on Friday and the Dead Zone on Sunday. The cable was messing up, plus there was all this stuff going on with concerts and hair color and all that good jazz. Or should I say "punk"? Which was all pop/punk bands, from nearby areas. Gatorface went first. These guys really had me laughing. Later somebody told me that they're not even a real band. But they're just as good as the rest of 'em up there that day. They've got this creative humor/dry wit type thing going on, which if they kept with that line of thinking, they could be the punk version of Spinal Tap. Let's see, some of the other bands... Of course, Without Incident which we were there to support. Arlington was good but couldn't stay. They had another show to play that night. There at the last, wast was Too Beautiful To Die. I'd have to say these guys kicked butt. I wonder how they came up wit the name, though.

      I got some bad news today at work. At break I asked how he was doing, the kid that was in the car accident, and someone told me he didn't make it. It was on Friday he died. I guess by today everybody at work had time for it to sink in. And to be honest, I thought he might have had a small chance of pulling through, but I guess I was wrong. And I haven't seen his mother since Thursday when I talked to her before I had Friday and Saturday off. I hope she's coping with all this. It's a complete tragedy and what makes it even worse is that it could have been prevented. I want to just say to some of my friends I've mentioned this to, again, thanks for listening.   I can't dwell on this forever, so... I was reading Beau Sia's webpage where he seems to have put out an open call for someone to rent out his room in Manhattan. I've mentioned earlier on another blog, that he's been on vacation in Scotland, and it sounds like he's become so smitten with the whole place, he wants to stay even longer. I tought that was pretty funny and I can't really say that I blame him for that. I know I'd probably feel the same way. If anyone wants to visit the page, I believe it's at beausia.com  (I hope that's right. If it isn't, I'll post the correct site tomorrow sometime. Well, Xanga is up to its usual mischief today. I couldn't access it when I got home this evening. Neither could anyone else. So it looks like my backup may turn into a regular destination. Its a shame about the Xanga, though. It has a lot of cool features that I was really getting into. I got an email today from a friend back in Fresno who's also into photography. In his spare time he uses his photos (slides) as background for upcoming shows for local bands, friends of his. Haha, he worked on a photo of me, put together with a couple of different backgrounds. Kinda neat. If I can find a way to post these picture here, I'll be doing exactly that, postin' the pics.  Speaking of pictures, Ifinished the roll of film in the digital (disposable) and was going to drop it off today but the place was closed, well it IS Sunday. But you can specify whether you want the images on cd as well as prints but that takes a couple of weeks to get back, it'll still be worth it. Laura says she can post them that way without having to use a scanner. Double cool!

      Didn't get done with Laura's hair color till after 2:00. All the while she's worrying about it being too dark. "My dad's gonna kill ..me".  And me telling her not to worry, that I know what I'm doing. She didn't want to go too drastic.  As it turns out, we seem to have not picked a color that was drastic enough. She says it looks the same as before.  She's right, but if you look closely, there are some minute highlights. I think it's ok, it looked kinda blah before and now there is a richer tone. But she says she wants a darker color for next time.I guess I'll be going along to that show tonight. Ha, it's good that tickets are only $5. It's something to do. And they're not that bad, actually even though they haven't been playing as long as some of the other bands, Without Incident. I wonder what a poem would sound like if I used all the names of these local bands.  Let's see..."So Fed Up after traveling along Rivendale, I saw that this adventure would not be Without Incident. Indeed, this was no Gametime, and ..." That would be something to look into, especially as ad for a show if by some chance they were to all be booked at the same location. Haha.I may have stumbled onto something here. Or not.

      What did I get myself into? Laura is going to wake me up at 1:00 a.m. when she and Jason get home from the concert, and here's why: I promised I would help do her hair color for Monday when she gets her senior picture taken. Why at 1:00 a.m.? Because she also wants it done in time to show it off for when they go to the next show, where Without Incident is playing, tomorrow night. Still I have to ask "why does it have to be so early?" Fed Up is back from touring. I'm not supposed to say anything but the cat will out of the bag soon enough when all three of them report to work again at Hi-Vee. Lol. "dun Laoghaire" will skin me alive but it's all probably moot by now anyway.  They're to play their return show on the 18th of this month.  I'm gonna have to read up on HTML so I can get some color on this thing. Shoot, there might already be color, I just can't see it on this browser. I'd like to post some pictures once in a while too. Well I have to take 'em before I post 'em. I'd better get busy.

      My weekend started last night, I stayed up late and woke up around 6 this morning. Two days off to run introspective and let time get away from me. I might go to the library, for a better advantage with some websites, may just take a walk around Sugar Creek and Fairmont. I'm taking my camara, that little cheapo disposable digital I picked up last week. It could very well return some decent pics, you just never know.  This is the news for now. Just a small entry here. Last night I couldn't get on my Xanga, and heard no one else could either, so in a panic, and having something important to post, I sign on here. And this morning Xangas back up and running. But I'll still give this one a try. Hahaha, two different weblogs on separate sites. Can you say redundant, boys and girls? LOL.

      Unspoken  Don't dare give up  on this one. Don't let them tell you that  a decision must be made. For as well meaning as they seem,  don't let them tell you there will be no hope left. Even now when there is music in this room, he is listening to the favorites you brought from home. Speak to him - he can hear you. There it is still, in the present. Look there, at your boy, you can see for yourself even now he stirs. Don't let them hurry you  with time limits, with jaded voices, desensitized, all for the sake of an empty bed. This isn't how its supposed  to be or how is has to be. Don't let them make you think of how unnatural it seems for the  parent to outlive the child, but see here another day and yet another has passed and still he moves in his sleep. Don't dare give away his time  to wake.

I do know this, it's gonna take a lot of getting used to.  - Much like Lee's Summit as compared to Independence Regional. See what happens next.

      Patterns  If it has a good beat,  you can dance to it...  Not too likely but more  the intricate cadence of complete sound with  that almighty pull, drawn  into the rythm, you know  it's got to be the rythm that gets to you, when it's good and creating its own friction, heat. Its that vibration having been built from the ground up, like campfires  on the beach, like passion you can feel all the way  from where you stand, when the only thing in comparable opposition  to stir the spirit is the  haunting sound of pipes.

      I just got notice today of one of the many changes currently taking place at work. Starting on the 29th, the people working in each area will have a different time schedule. It's gonna affect me all the way around because I'm a relief person and in a different area every day. 5 East:   6-2:30 5 West:  7-3:30 5 Middle: 8-4:30 4 East:   7-3:30 3 East:   6-2:30 ICU:      8-4:30  That's really gonna suck, coming in at 8:00 and not getting off till 4:30. Not only that, the lunch break times are gonna be different as well, so that means they're splitting us up at lunch. Maybe that'll cut down on employee complaints against the corporation. Well you know, anything to further the cause would be in our own best interest. Yeah.

      Risk Worth Taking  I roam the hallways,  the visiting spirit confronting an unknown past when the past  hides itself so effective,  unattainable to find meaning  from complex shadows, foremost in my mind, what was this damage done, and why? I know that your fear  becomes my fear metamorphosed,  that I am afraid of your absence And that I can no longer ignore this emptiness, such the awful  ache deep inside, for you. And when I know I can still burn away the chill of this autumn And when those struggles continue so far away, yet strike so close to home, touching exposed nerve, feeding fear, danger of loss,  losing love, the past is again immediate, here to steal away the hope I offer you.  And when I'm always dreaming  the safety of you, know that I'll never be ready to let it take away any more of you from you, from me. So remember, my love, that its always the risk worth taking.

      In one of the rooms I was cleaning yesterday, a car accident victim who said he was finally going home the next day. We got to talking, he was telling me how he totaled out his car last Friday, even showed me pictures of the wrecked car. My God, you know he was so lucky to walk away from that. Believe me there are people in less damaging wrecks who don't make it, I know. He's a young kid, just graduated high school last year. Told me that this particular time he had his seat belt on, when he doesn't usually wear one, and couldn't explain why or the reason he chose to buckle up. Man... I told him it just sounded like someone was definitely looking out for him that night, he is extremely lucky. I just can't help but think of Shawn when I see stuff like this.  There's a lady at work who's always bringing cakes for birthdays and such. She says she can't sleep a lot of times at night so she's always up at 3 in the morning baking a cake or cookies. Then she'll carry it to the bus stop, catch the bus to the Square, then walk from the Square to the hospital. Imagine having to lug those things around every time like that, sometimes she'll bring more than one when two  birthdays hit in the same week. Little bitty thing too, not even 5 feet, weighs like 80 something. And here she's pushing these big carts around at work, don't know how she does it. Anyway, she bakes all these cakes, but never one for herself, she's diabetic. We all ought to find out when her birthday is and do somthing special, I mean after all, she's the one all the time thinking of everybody else. I remember when it was my birthday she asked me what kind of cake I wanted and I said "coconut" and I figured it would be like a mix with some cocunut added, or even just in the icing. But here she brings this 3-layer cake and says she made it from scratch. Wow... so we really need to do something really nice for her... It kinda bothers me some people complain about how she's so "grouchy" a lot of times, and I'm sorry, I just don't see it.  She's just talking, everyday conversation, nothing grouchy about that.

      Equal Parts  In the morning, still dark and cool, there's moisture in the air, and looking up, there's the Cheshire cat moon guarding his share, his equal part of the day, playing  peek-a-boo through the clouds and lightning strikes, like the  one that hit the building early  on, setting off fire alarms of unknown origin on every floor.  (Fade out, then fade back in)  I gaze at all this through  the entrance, slowly close  the door and wait for the  perfect time this afternoon for while you sit, I straddle  your lap, armed with a spoon and a bowl of rocky road,  feed you fun, slow, sensual, teasing sweet. And there we are, face to face...

      Last night marked the last show for Without Incident. Jeremy, their bass player is moving out of state and it was kind of an emotional night by the end of the evening. Very sad for a lot of people. Well the rest of the band will continue once they get a new bass player but they're retiring the name, which I thought was very touching. A kind of message that says, "once you're gone, it won't be the same so this is our way of telling you we'll miss you."  The show itself was pretty good, held in a church not too far from where I live. There was about six different bands there. It was kind of bizarre, though. Friendly moshing up front, where Riley's drums were stored off to the side for the rest of the show. I kept thinking "geez, they're getting awful close to the equipment, guard it..." But there was no damage. As I watched them it seemed as if they knew the boundaries. I was surprised. That's why I say "friendly" moshing, cause if somebody fell, somebody else would always help them back up. Wow. You don't see that every day. And nobody got mad eiher. So I guess that's how Christian Punk operates. I was pleasantly surprised.  Without Incident did a version of Amazing Grace during their set, and another band did a version of Friday, I'm in Love.   ... Sorry, that song just wasn't meant to be punked-out. Just my opinion, haha. Wish I could remember the name of the last band that played. they were a little older than the rest of them, and the lead guitar had some real intricate bluesy type riffs mixed in with the other stuff. I liked the contrast.

      New rumors at work.. Well now its that they're gonna let two more of the housekeepers go. I keep thinking, if a certain someone doesn't keep his mouth shut, and himself out of trouble, they're gonna make him the next to go. Poor guy - sometimes he just pops off stuff without thinking, or maybe the truth is he knows what he's doing, he's just testing people. I also hear of an upcoming meeting that involves an entire department. Major, major changes going on.

      No Call, No Show  (Payday... Jesse come on)  Here I'm on overtime and wondering just how long it  should take to cash a check. Should be here by now spooning up this stuff so I can go downstairs for the cart, put pans in warmers, burned my fingers on the pilot, damn, these old folks gotta eat and some get more than  cranky when they gotta wait.  (Jesse come on already)  Something. It might have been the way or even the reason for a distraction, the trip-up that cost half the residents on this floor their banana pudding.  (Something is terribly wrong)  Nah, he should be here helping clean this mess, I barely have time now to wrap silverware, bag rolls,  paste up the water, powdered thickener.  (...at least come in time to help serve)  Jesse never showed.    Monsters (Conspiracy of Silence)  Half the crew is  holding their tongues Knowing all along now They know, you can  see it in their eyes, they know. If there's something you  should say then you damn well better spill it. You can start by answering, Where are they? Now that they're on the run now that the deed is over and its too late now for Jesse McKinnis. They know the where, the how, they know the why. Its like  they've all gone suddenly mute,  but never them in shock. Never them, 'cause they knew all along, synchronized time while the set-up played itself out. Payday, make it look like  it was for the money. The same money he was gonna use to surprise his grandfather, restore the classic sitting for years  in his garage, but... Monsters never gave a rat about that, just hard-core accesories now.  There's a special place in Hell for the lot of ya.    Samhain  Home fires in the  Highland hills. For once I have  new dreams  at summer's end, as the old becomes a new hope for the  year to come. What good is a  dream without convoluted meaning,  but I sense that the  unknown is a lot  less frightening when seen under your light.

      It's been raining quite a bit for the past few days. I wonder if there's gonna be the same kind of mess I walked into the last weekend it rained so hard. I wonder if they know how much I talk about them here on the blog, those folks out in Lee's Summit. I wonder if they still remember me at the Groves. I'm restless today, I wanna do something but I don't know what. Somebody stop me if I say anything about going back to the Groves. Hahaha! Like maybe a PRN position up on third floor or something. Doris tried to get me to do that when I left the first time. And when I went to work at Regional, lo and behold she was there too. Haha, she's everywhere with that voice.... "Well, ya know..." Never mind people, that was an inside joke. I'm just rambling on here. Something, for some reason, made me think about Jesse McKinnis. That was awful. Maybe something I read somewhere just kind of spurred my memory of that whole mess. Jesse never deserved what he got. Never did a bad thing to anybody. I'll write more someday but not now.   It's the rain, its the seasons changing, its decisions made, its freedom again. I hope.

      All For This  You've got me now to where I could beg for the touch of your hands on my body, the kiss from your lips, a nuzzle, urgent, passion felt above my shoulder, beg for  you to need this much as well. Only for this, I can almost taste the scent of you as you reach for me, ravage me, move through me, all to  obliterate this awful ache within that only comes from being without you. I could beg for all this, have you understand  with just a soft touch of my own, a caress for your hair, your skin and I swear another look in those brown eyes of yours I'll be lost forever, but still I hold you gentle, tell you true my hands love you as much as my heart. And in the morning, I'll again smooth your hair, wild from restless sleep and dreams, wake you with kisses  just to see you open your eyes, just to tell you how much this means.

      I've stayed away from tv on purpose the past couple of days, but because the images are always gonna be there, images and words, and tributes to firefighters and emergency workers. Everyone pulled together two years ago. I can't figure out why it takes such a tragedy for people to pull together like that. I don't know, just some observations I guess. I saw the attacks on tv as it was happening, I guess that was enough for me. I was working third shift at the time at another hospital in North Kansas City, and when I came home that morning, I fell asleep trying to watch some tv, and happened to wake up again when they broke into programming with taped footage of the first plane that hit one of the buildings. They had already switched to a live feed by the time the second plane came through. Not long after, I heard one of the announcers say that the first structure was leaning, and I remember thinking, "surely not, that can't be right." But it was. And by the end of the end of the day those buildings were gone, along with all the people still in them. Even as far away as I was, the whole experience, watching it, left me feeling chilled. Knowing that from then on things would never be the same. Its still awful to remember, but the feeling I have is that we're supposed to remember, just some of us in different ways, in private.

      Buddy  In 45 minutes, stray dogs can pass you from behind and forge an unspoken path of protection along the way, the entire way. The morning can change from dark to dim, to colors of coral and sky blue so that by the time it takes to reach Truman and Forest even the clouds can look like train tracks from here.

      Yesterday my horoscope said, "Self-control is the last resort. Hide from others. The future will change tomorrow." Very ominous-sounding. I was hoping nothing would change for the worse, and what was up with that "hide from others" part? Well today for the moment I feel pretty good. Things might be getting better. Hopefully certain people will finally mean what they say for once. Just want my life back, you know? I emailed a friend who lives in Fresno and well its a long story, but he ended up with my acoustic guitar I told him to keep. Lately I got to thinking that's part of what I want, used to do, an now really wanting to do again. He still has it, so I guess I'll have him send it. Wow, little by little, piece by piece, finally. I just hope it doesn't all blow up in my face for some reason.  It was Greg Cordum's birthday today, (General Manager of EVS at Indep. Regional, MCI, and Lee's Summit Hospital) and it also happens to be Housekeeping Appreciation week so he got us all pizza. I told him it was also Jason's birthday, and when he asked how old he was, he didn't believe me when I told him, he's 22. Andy, my old boss came by the hospital too. He still says everybody misses me out at Lee's Summit. And I still have to say he's one of the best bosses I ever worked for. He'll work right alongside you when your swamped with a ton of stat dismissals. Not like some of the supervisors here. Well I shouldn't complain too much, at least I still have a job, which brings me to some of those that are no longer co-workers. I think that how it was done was very cold and heartless on the part of HCA. I guess that's what happens with a big corporation like that.

      Well, a lot of things went down at work while I was off Friday and Saturday. Let's just say we're minus three more people as of Friday. After months of delaying an official "announcement" about this, they go and lay people off without such an announcement. I can't say I really agree with the tactics here. I mean aren't we supposed to give a standard 2-week notice to quit? What, they can't give these three the same courtesy? This brings us to a grand total of 7 slots that probably will never be filled. One transferred to Lee's Summit, another resigned for health reasons, one quit a couple of months ago, the ER housekeeper transferred to another department, and now Dennis, Shelley, and Roxie from nights, are gone. Really gonna miss Dennis, trading cat stories, or "Hey you" joking around all the time, up on the floors. Man, that sucks. Hardly anybody that's left jokes around like that. I was talking to Randy, who was saying they went by seniority. Well that can't be right, 'cause I'm one of the two newest people here. I guess they counted my time at Lee's Summit before I transferred, plus I'm the only other housekeeper who can do linen too. I guess I'm lucky there.   If you've ever seen on here where I've mentioned the local punk group Fed-Up, good things have been happening for them this past week. This is the band my daughter shoots pictures of, promos and all that, sometimes for their website. Well it seems that they have been signed. Hmmmm.... only a rumor at this point because nobody around here can get in touch with 'em again to find out what label. I gues they forgot to ask the first time. Or, see how quickly they forget? And Laoghaire finally got a job after a year of looking, now she's at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts. Now she won't have to drop that class that goes in tandem with it, hopefully. And more officially she's been accepted into Brooks Institute of Photography. I may have mentioned that before. Must be a sign of fatigue. So with that I'll sign off.

      Every year on Labor Day weekend, they have an event called the Santa-Cali-Gon. Independence was the site where the Santa Fe, California, and Oregan trails met. So they have a carnival, craft vendors, country and bluegrass bands, food booths, etc. up on the Square. I don't go anymore because it's always too hot plus there's just too much crowd. When my mom died, the funeral happened to be on the first day of the Santa-Cali-Gon that year and everybody went up to the Square afterwards. I thought that was just too much. I didn't go. A year before that my Grandma Ginney died right before Thanksgiving- I didn't even know things were really that bad until I got a call from my mom, long distance. I was in Fresno at the time. I was making a scarf to match her coat, purple. Working on that to send for Christmas. And I was in the middle of it when I picked up the phone. Geez I remember all I could really say was "I'm making this scarf, its her favorite color. I'll never get to give it to her." For some reason when I started the project it meant so much. So instead of sending Christmas presents I came out to Kansas City for the funeral. And you know how people say they "appear to be asleep"? A cliche cause you hear it all the time. But I swear, in this case it really did look like she was sleeping. I ended up going back to Fresno on Thanksgiving Day, because that was the stipulation for getting booked on a flight on such short notice.

      Vague  The remainder's always standing so  far away from me, distant anodyne a mixed message always so vague. What mixed message can be found here? I'm supposed to be quite a person but never quite knowing what that means exactly, good or bad, it could be anything. I'm left grasping at the emptiness  of straw again - and what was it Warhol once said, "Timing is all," but what good is time when spent  in useless company, the rude, the  bad and the lazy, thieves never  leaving the scene of the crime and returning only wasted time and burn-out.

      I'm gonna go out on a limb and expose all. Well even more than I'm really comfortable with. Like there's this extra person in my house that's been there for about a month now and won't leave either. See I knew something was up when I saw the people he'd been staying with pull up and leave about five boxes of his damn stuff out in the rain. Said he was gonna be gone by Labor Day but... still here. You know, what if I did just all of a sudden just leave. Just disappear. And the saying "nobody goes hungry in my house" well that sentiment has been more than abused, especially when they're playing Everquest in shifts now. This is totally insane, useless. Neither one of them has a job. Excuse me, but fuck all that. I can't take any more. The very next chance, I'm out of here for good. I don't care where it is, just away from here. I can't live like this. I can't take this.

      Shades of an X-Phile  And in the darkness  the cynic to my believer Scully to my Mulder Its theory to theory And I was blinded by  his science, talk of the stratosphere, the cosmos, systems to systems, creation to evolution theories or my  favorite theory that merges them both, faith and disregard. Then there's that way of  quoting Shakespeare, Bronte  and Neruda, the scope of  language much more than I  can ever hope for. Maybe the problem here is that I've lost education along  with everything else, yet another something to reclaim.

      Bailey here.  It's amazing how you don't realize you depend on technology until you're without it, even for a short time. Cell phones, the internet, all a line to the outside world, greater in scope than you can travel in a day or 45 minutes, the time it takes to get to work. At work yesterday at the elevators near where the cafeteria is, one of the dietary ladies asked me "are you getting skinnier or are your clothes just getting bigger?" Geez the fourth person in about a month. (And no, Laoghaire I am not anorexic - so quit playing that song whenever you come over, haha!) It's just stress, you know. Anyway, it was a long day, I ended up working through last break just to get done. Then I tried to go to the place to get a top up card for the phone after I got my check cashed and the bus I was waiting on I guess was stuck in traffic and would have been waay delayed, so I just took the regular bus home. Later on though my daughter came by and offered to give me a ride up there, went to a Chinese place at Independence Center, pretty good. I have two days off, I'm going to bed and sleeping in tomorrow morning. Right now, I feel like I could sleep for a week. Goodnight everybody.

      Soul Screamings  Nothing I wouldn't do now No distance I wouldn't travel No pilgrimage too far to retrieve and return to hand him the something of value and substance he so desparately needs, and know that my heart belongs to him already.  That and my soul screaming, silent yet believing in him still, primal, pleading. pleading to see me, I am here, I am real. I watch him forever run a struggle each day with some unknown torment, a god-awful school of piranha worry that tears away at the vital and leaves only  confusion that he hides behind a masking of the every day-to-day trivial, the altogether meaningless. I know that from all the world he holds this chaos inside. From all the world, except for me and its the only me I'm capable of being, because when he's churning, so I churn, hurt when he hurts, bleed when he bleeds. Even now when he pushes so much for me  not to and I'm not pushing as hard as I can,  but tossed just the same by the unknown  as in the potential knowing.

      Wow. Talk about deja vu. There was major problems with the phone lines earlier today and I kept getting disconnected in the middle of posting the previous entry. So I guess it took each time I hit the "publish" button. Its probably because of the rain, which has caused some problems elsewhere too. Like the night before last when it really started coming down, another lady from work had to evacuate her house because the entire walls in the basement collapsed from all the rain, had to call her son to help her get the animals out 'cause they were scared and hiding under the beds... gas line broke and it was really concentrated inside the house there. She was lucky to get herself and everyone else out, but imagine. She stopped by during one of our breaks yesterday with her son, she was just in tears, said the whole downstairs was just rubble, the foundation's shot, and they said it wasn't even safe yet to go back in for some clothes. I really feel bad for her. It could have been a lot worse though, she could have been asleep and ended up being trapped inside with all that gas when it happened. Oh and the hospital sprung leaks everywhere from the rain, there were a couple of code reds, from where water got into the wiring and shorted out some lights. Puddles all in the patient rooms up on 5th floor, half the break area was completely soaked, an inch of water in Healthline, the classrooms there. They had the wet-vacs running nonstop yesterday. The lead kept saying "This is the day from Hell"  And she tried calling the supervisors but they weren't answering their phone. It's an old hospital and when you have the entire season with no rain, then all of a sudden you get 15 inches of water all at once there's gonna be some major problems.

      I said one time I was going to list all the music CDs that I own right now... And these are ones I'm never letting go of again, because some of them are replacements for one's I've lost over the years.  Galore - The Cure (I tore this place apart looking for the CD I had of theirs and never found it. Got this one at Sam Goody - it has all the songs I like on it.)  Tribute to the Ramones We're a Happy Family  - Various (My daughter got me this for my birthday)  Anthology - Ramones (another birthday gift a couple of years ago)  Artist In the Ambulance - Thrice (Replaces Korn as my new favorite band)  Matrix Reloaded Soundtrack - Various (I really like the instrumentals on this)  A Day Without Rain - Enya  Paint the Sky With Stars - Enya  Celtic Mouth Music - Various (A lot of the songs here are very rough, the sound quality isn't that great. But there are a few really good ones once you get past all the others. A few with incredible harmonies.)  Live At the Acropolis - Yanni (A Christmas present from my daughter. I used to play this one all the time back in Fresno.)  Amused to Death - Roger Waters (I had to special order this one off the internet, through a friend who had a credit card. Haha)  The Belfast Gigs - Horslips (Another one I had to special order. They had another album, my favorite of theirs but it couldn't be found, even on the web.)  Men Without Women - Little Steven and the Disciples of Soul (You know Little Steven - the guy with the scarf on his head in the E-Street band. He's also Sylvio Dante on the Sopranos.)   And some Christmas albums...  The Christmas EP - Enya (My mom thought this was a beautiful rendition of Silent Night "Oiche Chiun" sung in the Gaelic language. So I played it a lot.)  The Kansas City Holiday Album - Various (The proceeds from this went to benefit Wayside Waifs, one of the largest animal shelters in Kansas City.)  The Christmas Attic - Transiberian Orchestra (Got this one by mistake, thought it had a certain song but it didn't. Kept it anyway, it's still a Christmas album.)  Traditional Celtic Christmas - Various Instrumental... bagpipes. Need I say more?  :)

      In this week before Halloween, I'd like to address all you pet owners out there to pay close attention to the safety of your pet.  This is especially true if you own a cat, since there are some very cruel people out there, who may harm pets for sport, around this time of year. Please keep your cats inside these days leading up to Halloween, and it may be a good idea to do so a few days after as well.  And as always, never give your pets chocolate, much as they seem to beg for it when its around, there's a chemical in chocolate that is very toxic to dogs and cats as well. Just a friendly reminder, in hopes for a safe and happy Halloween.  :)

      Oiche Shamna   Rain or shine, I will be there running through the scavenger hunt, right after I finish "Old Yeller" But for now I'm facing half in, half out of the dark. Wait for me, I will be there. Imagine tonight that the moon is full, that there have never been drugs in  candy, no razor blades put to apples. Go back to a time before Kevin Perry sat home Halloween night watching  thriller movies the whole time, ate bags full of Snickers, huffed enough cans of all purpose cleaner to never again make  it to class. What the hell was he thinking. Cloudy or clear, I will be there despite the latest stories of animal sacrifice the torturing of a stray kitten or someone's pet. Only God could help the next person I  see to do such a thing. Rain or shine, rain or shine  I will be there trying to remember innocence  and failing miserably.

      Well, it seems a lot happened at work while I was gone on vacation. All the exiting stuff usually does...  All the supervisors at many of the area hospitals, including the one I work for, who are contracted out by Sodexho, were notified that they either will be gone for sure, or gone pending further notice... Talk about stress. I would hate to be in that situation. But then, who knows, those cuts have actually gone to our level before, and they may again.  What was that line from Star Wars?  "I've got a bad feeling about this..." I've been having some temporary trouble with my isp, so for now my time on the internet is limited to the times I can make it up here to the library and use their computers. Hopefully soon that will be taken care of.. So if anyone is wondering why I'm not posting as much or answering my emails like I used to, this is why. Bear with me... Lol My daughter is in Santa Barbara, checking out the "Dream College" Brooks Institute. I think her exact words when she called me last night, about the place was, "Wow.....Just Wow. The place is amazing..." I'm really glad she's so impressed, it makes for great motivation, hahaha.

      Passages  They line the hallway on both sides before breakfast and lunch, when alzheimer's and dementia trips, turns and runs the loudest. Some in good moods, a few in perpetual combative mode, and the whoops and hollers... "Hey, ho.... God is good, Good is God..." All with something to say, even coworkers with warnings in passing, on the way up, "Watch your back..." Lock yourself in the utility room if you have to, and duck out  the other way. Beware the silent well-meaning bear hugs from out of nowhere, the ones you feel compelled to  notify with "a little help here, please." For now its just a little comic relief, but in a place like this there's never enough comic relief to go around, when it all turns serious, heart-wrenching. After lunch, dining room duty  wiping down tables, listening, listening. In the corner she sits crying, begging to use the phone, call her husband who's been gone these twenty years. Outside in the alcove, old man mutters from his wheelchair to himself, to anyone within earshot, "help me... someone please help me." All a different pitch of monotone, and at the end of my shift as I stand at the exit, ready  to punch the new code on the  keypad, from behind me another voice is added  to the symphony, a thin wail  of "I'm so tired.. I want out  of this world."

      Indian Summer  Enjoy it while you can this unseasonable warmth won't last long. And in the morning, if you take out early enough when the quiet and calm are  still in control, before stars and moon have released their sentinel grip to the new day. You can feel the power of time and patience, how much wisdom there is in the waiting,  and the following, and the learning. I look up and he's grinning again reflecting light back toward some collective source, having returned, that was sent unconscious  through the ages by those in love.

      Dreaming Volumes  How long can this distance  haunt my sleep, this dreaming of you,  to you, with you. And each night all that we have,  all that we speak,  though not actually  speaking... volumes of need, with meaning through distance through night. I look at your hair, knowing how my fingers want to become entangled  there within. The look on your face, the knowing in your eyes from where I stand. And we dream volumes.

      My vacation is nearly over, I go back to work tomorrow. For some strange reason, I feel like I'm ready to go back. Just for the sake of getting on with things. I even think some people have already started getting used to me not being there, since at least one of my co-workers seems to have forgotten my name. How quickly forgotten, hahaha!  Really have enjoyed this time off though, and if I didn't exactly get everything done I wanted to accomplish, at least I got things going in the right direction, I hope. There's still a lot of direction to go, I've sent applications and resumes to quite a few places. Now the hardest thing is the waiting for a response.  Well, I'm hoping for the best.   I'm looking forward to the Def Poetry Jam tour coming here next month on the 11th, I was really excited to hear about that. That is still one of my favorites, one that I never miss when its on tv, or try not to miss. So I'll be going to that, for sure. But I have yet to find out where its to be held at. I hope they find a venue before the 11th. I would hate to think they'd take KC off the schedule.  Nah, they wouldn't do that, would they? I think that's about it for now. Until next time.

      Competition  I don't live and die  by a flashing sword like the pixilated wielder of a photon weapon in the dark,  through all hours  of the night, level set to full, virtual shots of some fantasy invading dreams while  I sleep.   I choose no technologically advanced mass role playing graphics. None at all, with exception for that of a purist, stills caught through  reflection in patience and lighting, moments in time  to find some essence of  a muse, God only knows. I am able, willing, more  than ready to take it all back, my life, and get on  with living a real one.

      How Sentimental  It's unreasonable the rain tonight, at  forty degrees and falling fast, slightly out of sync with the rest of the world. And thoughts of winter or Tule fog settling in and on again turning to the lonliness of holidays. Only hours ago there was perfection in a yard crisp in color and texture,  bright in a lens, would have made  such a shot, a small memory turned  tangible that I could  hold in my hands, smile in the brief moment that was my own and private and all the while, this same moment spawns the burning behind the eyes, a feeling that wants so desparately to share.

We are far less alone finding laughter in life and loving it all. I've traveled this far venturing so close I could almost  feel you now.

      It's been a great vacation so far. I've gotten a lot of things done that I couldn't have done otherwise. Things like going to the library whenever I want, getting a little more organized around the place, and some Halloween decorating, a little that is...  I've been able to be more relaxed while writing, and I'm really enjoying that.  Plus I've been able to get my resume together and printed out the way it should be, and sending it by fax to some different places. Now comes the hardest part - the waiting. I really do hope that I hear from some of those places at least by the end of next week, before my vacation ends so I can look forward to some sort of goal and not be stuck in the same place, literally or figuratively.  I heard also from my friend out in California, it looks like I'm gonna be getting my acoustic guitar back pretty soon. I need to get new strings... But this is good.. :) My daughter is planning a visit to check out the college in a few weeks, she's really hopeful about ths one. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it really does all work out.  Well I figure I have a week left to enjoy, do some really creative things, and all before I go back to work on the 19th.  Oh and before I forget, the score is currently Kansas City-1, Los Angeles-0.....  Go Wizards!  Take care people.

      Identity Crisis  Haven't been myself lately and today I may even be somebody else, and float the corridors... But for now I take a cup of instant to jump-start the day. An aural dose of Thrice and Fed*Up, one more cup to last long enough to  get me there under the clock. Schedule says I'm Martha today so down the stairs I go, to flip the light, undo padlock pull links from a cart chained up for when vendors descend in  dead of night, another mysterious short order, and supplies disappear. Such an infamous sleight-of-hand. Guess tomorrow I'll be Sue, floors three and five, all week a different personality. B1, 2, 4 East, West, North, all points inbetween, and tell them "That is correct, sir"  I am  everywhere, everyday. Another day collecting another fifty cents.

      Net Worth  My Clan map of Scotland, Rampant Lion on the wall, near the corner, and next to it, sun solstice wind chimes. Collections of all things Celtic, photos, books and mementos useless to anyone but myself. Tiny cat plates and figures, candles, gifts and possessions of those here and gone too soon.  I know  what this is like. And right there, you can see it all when you enter. The rosary I searched months  for, rescued from an alcoholic haze-meister who would have sold it as well, just for spite. Or the greeting card I sent  years ago and found, kept after all this time, the one with "An Irish Blessing" It's all there, a full-eye view of what's always been the  most important parts of the past. You can see it when you enter.

      Second Sight  What was left behind in Shawns eyes became a gift, some better quality of life than before, some absolute ability for one, or two recipients. What was left behind becomes the gift through modern miracle, science and donorship, and wisdom via the bigger scene,  the larger scope  of things to come. All this from such a terrible sacrifice no parent  should ever have to make. What was left behind of Shawn became second sight.

      First, a moment of silence and prayer for the friends and family of Frank Whittlesy, an 83-year-old man who was tragically struck and killed by oncoming traffic while leaving the supermarket Monday evening.  (story found at examiner.net)  Just as I was on my way out the door yesterday, a friend who lives out in Liberty came by needing help with moving stuff into the basement. They have been doing some finishing touches on their house (which is only about a year old). Right now they're hiring people to finish the basement. Well it seems Home Depot delivered all the drywall early and left it on the front lawn. And since the workers hadn't had a chance to get there yet, and it was scheduled to rain, she was rounding up as many people as she could find to move all that stuff around to the basement. So it was me, my son, some other guy and her, all trying to move these 8-ft, 10-ft. and 12-ft. pieces of drywall. Hahahaha. Me and her handled about 6 or 7 of the 8-ft. pieces from the stack before the workers showed up. And I just learned something. I can't lift worth ca-ca. Did it but had a lot of trouble... a lot different from what I'm used to at work, with the linen carts. So this morning I woke up all sore. Anyway, after that we both went in and help her mother paint the kitchen. It really looks good, a kind of muted red color, really fits the interior. Even before a second coat it looks good. Took up the rest of my day, but it was good to help some.

      Well, I was off these past two days, go back to work tomorrow, and then, and then.... I don't go back till the 19th.  Gives me plenty of time to look for something else, somewhere else. I hope the search yields something decent. I've already sent my resume to a couple of places, online.My daughter finally found a job at Krispy Kreme. And hmmm... she makes more per hour than I do. Well I guess that's one more reason to look elsewhere, the hospital doesn't pay its housekeepers enough. Well I'm really glad though that she's been able to save up for a good digital camera she's going to be using for school, and beyond that, for what she's choosing as a career. She'll be visiting Brooks sometime later this month. I hope she likes it.  At this moment, the Wizards are tied with Colorado  2-2 in tonights game. Soccer, much better than football, baseball: the Chief and Royals. You can really tell around here when the Chiefs are winning a game, and also when they're losing. There's some pretty angry people then, they just take it too personally. I mean it's one thing to say, "we won" cause you relate so to the team. But it's really stupid the way some folks take it as a personal insult if their favorite player happens to fumble the ball. That's why I could care less about the NFL. There are just too many hardcore fanatics. Don't get me started about the Superbowl, hahaha. Oh I'll watch, but not for the game, it's for the ads. That tradition goes all the way back when the marketing class was given an exercise to time each commercial and then calculate how much each national buyer of airtime spent during the game. And I've been watching for the ads ever since...  Well "We Won!" (the Wizards) KC 4, CO 2 Final score... See, that wasn't so bad, was it? Take care people.

      The Only Thing That Matters  I'll meet you in the pouring rain. We'll brave the elements, wind  and thunder, we'll match our electricity with that of the skies, when lips and tongues meet, searching, needful, mindful, tender, such an urgent response. I'll meet you in the pouring rain we'll be soaked through coats, clothes, to the skin, the chill so bitter the only thing that matters is the warmth of us, the feel of your body held close. The only thing that  matters is the deep, hypnotic power of your kiss. And now I find myself  falling into feeling, into surrender, into weakness, in too deep into the intensity I've never felt. I'll meet you in the pouring rain where the only thing that matters is you.

      Midnight  When we are solid, strong, together, secure in the knowledge of each other. Loving, content after passion renders senseless the body, spends  energy, leaves sleepy warm smiles and murmurs of "Goodnight, sweet  dreams my passionate man..."

      S.S. Victim Rant  Payday. I passed the address today by accident on the way to the bank. And now the whole scene reeks of deja vu all over again. The house where it happened. Small stuffed animals circle the tree, just like the papers  said, tall candles line the curb just beyond. Vigils are ongoing until the killer is caught. And I (hate this) had no idea this was  so close, because I am so  tired, hearing of killings, the stabbings, deaths of  people I've known from  years ago. This is supposed to be the "heartland of America" at least that's what the  journalists have always called it, but only the heartless will survive here eventually, they're too busy wasting life here, they spew hate here, call themselves good ole' boys, realists, hunters and survivalists, NRA spokespersons and gun enthusiasts. Not a one wants the  ounce of realization it takes to see that they're living a Springer episode, how base they want to exist, how little they want  to know. Another triangle where he beats up pregnant girlfriend, like a fool she takes him back time and again. Now he's a murderer, both having run off to parts unknown, leaving  behind death. I knew the victim.  I always know the victim, more and more,  too often these days.

I need to write, need to write  but life, survival, obstacles block the way, that linear line of thought, that which  inspires, although if a thought were to come across to others now, it would be a convoluted tapestry of impenetrable meaning. And I can imagine, like years ago comments like "where the hell did  that come from?" or "it's dark, like Plath" and never having read Plath,  much. But still - I need to write  a poem, let the answers come on  the breeze, on the winds of change, on the turn of seasons. Let the heart and gut instinct change my life for the better, God knows it needs changing.

      There have been so many complaints from the people I work with about how we're being treated, about the new time schedules, about how things are being run in general, etc.. I don't understand this: They laid off those three people, Dennis included, and the reason was... "budget"... There are plans to shut down this hospital, MCI, and Lee's Summit Hospital within the next couple of years, yet the powers that be are spending so much money on cosmetic stuff, like redoing the circle drive at the entrance. It looks better but really didn't need to be done. And all the extra painting done on the outside by independent contractors, that's gotta cost. So what's really up with the "budget"? They'd rather beautify the place on the outside, than keep staff on the books that keep it clean on the inside. Grrr...  I still say that was low the way they did those layoffs. I haven't heard from Dennis lately, think I'll call, find out if he's found something. He told me the (general manager) said MCI was hiring floor techs but Dennis don't have a car, and the busses don't run that early. His answer was, " "Bus service has improved greatly in the past couple of years."  Uh. No, it hasn't.  It was ok when living right down the street from work, but MCI is all the way across town.    Yeah, I'll call up and say, ".... Hey you..." lol. And I sure hope there's not another day like yesterday at work. Had to go in at 8, which is too late t start in my opinion. You feel like you're behind all day long. I lost my keys, had to go through the trash looking for them, weren't there. checked everywhere. Dealt with snotty nurses, I'm doing my job, but I'm always in their way.    Everybody's having to come in at a different time now, plus take their lunches at different times. There was nobody out there when I took lunch.  Randy says they're trying to split us all up, and I'd have to agree. Well today has to be a better day, so I'm gonna go ahead and get ready for it...

      Dinner At the Hatfields  I am thankful for living life and to have a little more than before at this time, and years past. Thankful today that I'm  not on that return flight to the west where there was no dinner, only a quick run to convenience for a six-pack that couldn't  see me and CNN news that left me numb. I called it the year of death, St. Ginney, Diana, Mother Teresa. Lucky this year for some  return to tradition. But on this very day, there are  still arguments in the Ozarks, one of my own caught in the  crossfire of harsh words, such as they might be. Hysterical rants turned to hurt feelings and snubs, never supposed to be like this. I can't even feel sorry for  the thankless anymore. Just wish you could have  stayed home and had fun with real family.

      Just a Touch  I would beg you  to come in  from the cold where its warm, cozy, a place full of feeling. There is such longing here.  I would reach for you come to you, feel you, and with closed eyes, held breath, a kiss so slow my time is suspended and time means nothing with you having the ability to stop my heart, beginning again with just a touch. With just a touch, everything  is alright again.

      I'm hoping everyone is enjoying their Thanksgiving holiday. I know I will be doing some cooking today, provided the turkey thaws out, lol. For me, the holiday is a little better than in previous years. I have the day off today, when so many times before I've had to work, and this time I have the means to actually enjoy something of a traditional Thanksgiving, with a few exceptions. My daughter is visiting step-relatives at Lake of the Ozarks today, so that's one of the down sides. It'll be me and my son, who's gonna help with the cooking.... this should be very interesting, lol. He can be onery sometimes and with a role model like Bam Margera, who knows what could happen?  Warmest thoughts go out to friends and family, the special people in my life who at the moment are so far away. Take care, and God bless.

      Second Nature  The touch of my lips to the nape of your neck as you dream, of color, of light and dark. And phrases, glimpses  of your sentiment  float through memory  like puffs of dandelion in flight, so difficult to grasp within sleep, second nature to cherish in a place where those  thoughts are images I hold to my heart.

      I'm thinking about how different some people and siutations can be... There's a guy at work who's married and has five kids not yet in school. He works 8 hours during the day, then immediately goes to a nearby nursing home and does yet another 8 hours. Every day he does this, because he has to, to support his kids. Two full-time jobs, man. And then you see people who won't even support themselves, leeching off whoever they can, and complaining all the while about how tough it is. People like that have never had a tough day in their life. Like this other lady at work, who's husband was a veteran who served in Korea, made her life hell the whole time they were married. I don't see how she put up with all the verbal and physical abuse for the some seventeen years they were together, she must be a lot stronger person than most of us, I do know that. I guess she stuck it out till the end though, till he was diagnosed with major health problems and passed away. This lady always has a funny story to tell about those years, but this time there was some heavy stuff mixed in. Nobody had any idea it was that bad. Its the kind of stuff that makes you appreciate and respect a person more than before. Always pleasant to everyone, loves to talk, she'd talk your ear off if you'd let her. And then at lunch one day she adds these bits of seriousness to those funny stories. And you're left thinking, wow - would never have known.  I don't know, just rambling on, myself, here.  And on, and on.... More later, I guess.

      Snap Case  Having stolen the right to even  continue here, having stolen time, stealing provision, never lift a finger but to cause more trouble. You are much too close to the holidays and memories  of death to assume forgiveness for this now. Worse than the vandal going after family having missed his target and taking out pictures  on the wall. Now there is broken glass at your feet, deep gash in your knuckles that you can tend to yourself. Don't ask if I care how deep it is, and no, I don't want to see how it reaches  all the way to the bone. Did this damage to yourself, your own worst enemy now, mine too, with your destruction of property. Just don't drip any more on my carpet.

      Unserious Angst   All present and accounted for this one night, all three of them together for the last time, hammering out chords, discordant rythms, jumpin' the air, landing flatfooted. Chaos on a wooden platform. There's moshing down below the stage in this church for Christian punks, and as the intro nears completion they regain balance, their places, the bass player with mic privileges for this one, opens his mouth to sing and screams, "Why must you have a hamburger with cheese, and lettuce, onions and mayonaise, and pickles? Why..... Whyyee?"

      Muse of Change  A view this cloudy  makes you wonder on  the why of reason  that leaves to become  grounded in tasks  of the too immediate, insistant as  beeper interruptions. So much here and  too little time. Giving me back  the muse of change to let the images come,  I'm praying for it now. Take the blinders  off my eyes so I can  finally see you. A much smaller map is what I need most,  so many miles apart,  so far away, and yet  you teach me no despair,  whisk it away  with hugs and kisses.

      Ephemeral  It was the first thing to notice, stopping halfway down these  steel steps. Early hours silent, moon directly overhead, a little to the left along the way. It was complete with haze  surrounding, ethereal in light and reflection. While I dreamed the fog returned and now swirls around me,  through me. And on the way, I watched as it surfed the air, played hide and seek with form and shape, casting spells, tricks with my vision as if the mist here, midpoint at the streetlight was  trying its best to become something material.

      So much overtime, so little time for anything else. It kinda seems that way, lately. But working straight through so many day translates very well on a paycheck. Someone got hurt at work, which is why I've been filling in for her all this time. People, people, watch out for those ramps and those heavy carts going down them, and for people stepping out in front of you... Well you know its like trying to stop a train, it just can't be done. And watch out for those busted wheels, too. I know quite a few people who have gotten hurt on the job recently. Local bands... Fed Up from here in the KC metro area has a cd release party and concert tonight. This is the band that's currently in the midst of getting signed. Congratulations to Dustinn, Matt, Justin and their new member, Josh. Rock on with your bad selves, lol. I would have gone along with Laura and Jason, but they'll be late getting back and I have to work in the morning. Plugging away till the 21st, my next day off. Maybe then I'll have time to get some things done, like get my long lost acoustic restrung, work on some more writing, nurse this cold, hahaha.

      Sometimes karma works and sometimes it doesn't. There's a lady at work who's just lost her father, he'd been in intensive care for about a week and a half, and all during that time she'd taken time off to be with him. Well, when they moved him to another floor, I figured he was at least out of danger. But today another lady at work came up to me and told me that she was taking up a collection for her, that her dad died last night. And here I thought he was in the clear when they moved him, but then she's telling me they moved him to that floor to die, that there was nothing else they could do for him. I really had no idea. Or maybe I did and just subconsciously distance myself from things like that. I mean, after the last time, when that kid was in ICU. It still comes as a shock when somebody comes right out and says it. Well, I told her I'd contribute. Very sad outcome. On the other side of the coin, and now very small consolation, is what I mean when I say karma works. I found out today that someone I've known for years to be a very evil person, has had a run of bad luck. I won't go into much detail but the person is an alcoholic and has done some very mean spirited things to others in his family, his whole life.   And here you've got two people that were probably the most complete opposites, in terms of characte. That old man was probably the nicest person, never did anything bad to anyone. I'm really not sure where I'm going with this, except maybe to say maybe now I feel guilty for having sensed some small justice being done from this one other guy's run of bad luck. Just something that struck me kinda weird and hopefully I'll make more sense out of it now that I've gotten it off my chest.

      Slow Illuminatation  There are still shadows within him that distant light has yet to reach. Not yet the spark of opportunity to grind the depths of reason as we move through, move forward to a full circle of seasons. When he feels, enough to speak it to me profound, its the loving in the dark, dreaming to the sound of his breathing, such the need is to know the deepest parts of him, limitless well of a man, with this wealth of hidden insight, from the basis of everything meaningful he has become, to the awful ache of emptiness only he can fill, he  touches me like no other has, how he can always turn me to light, alive, time and again.

      There must be a Chief's game televised today. I can tell from the neighber downstairs. He invites friends over for the game, and today they've already started to gather for the "celebration" ... I hear the team is doing very well, and although I'm not a rabid fan, I'm surrounded by them at work, so its impossible not to hear how good they are doing. Personally I'd rather see a good Wizards game, now that's something I can really get into, but I'm having a hard time keeping up with them. I usually get all set to watch something... and then fall asleep. I hate when that happens, hahaha. Too much overtime, I guess. Anyway, I suppose there will be much cheering going on. Its funny, the mood of an entire town can depend on a sports event. Its kind of sad really, especially when the team loses, and everyone's kinda bitchy at work the next day. This lady Ginger, at work feels the same way I do about it. She says something like, "I really hope they win, cause I don't wanna deal with everybody's foul mood if they lose."

      Well I'm back online after what seems like a long absence due to a  severe lack of an ISP. Lol... Been working a lot of overtime the past  two weeks, filling in for someone who got hurt on the job, and am I  ever glad I'm getting tomorrow off. Anyway the overtime on the check  will certainly be put to good use.  Well, my time on the internet is limited this morning, just never  seems to be enough time, lately, because I gotta go get ready for  work.  Be careful out there people, it can be dangerous.

      The Long Gray  It's a thin line extending centimeters beyond all the branches iced over way back when, in remembrance of the frozen-solid November world present six winters ago. New shades of Tule fog settles in halfway cross country from both sides, from the east, west. Now from the San Joaquin, hovered low and close enough, becoming ground cover to move through. You can feel it, you can hear it through the sound of a train  that alone in the early morning can fill the air with sorrow. Perspective is to the first bare tree, naked branches a skeletal exotic, even in the essence of dormant structure. Time now for tracing of the unfamiliar, this will be uncharted  territory once again, as a one time to be certain, vaguely hitting some memory as the nerve of memory proves always some bearing in the here and now coming ever from someplace known and out of nowhere,

      Symbolic  He gives me science and drama and I'm wide awake, I've opened  my eyes enough to see what risk  and pitfall there may be when any downside uncovers chance better than this lonely desolation, and this haunting. I am not running away. I'm not sleeping, wide awake, I am listening, taking it all in... He gives me caution,  he gives me time  enough to think, he keeps  my feet grounded in the  reality of choice  and destination. He gives me science and drama when I can only give back these token moon and stars.

      Well, Christmas has come and gone... and I guess some of us were more ready for it than others. Haha.. hmm... some gifts were late and I really feel bad about that, but eventually the recipients got what they wanted, which is good. Better late than never, huh?  Now its time to think about the past year and prepare to face the new one. I don't know whether its from working through Christmas or what, or any number of things. Emotions all over the place, but still mostly kept to myself. What is wrong with me, I'm pretty sure I know the reason. And I just keep thinking of how some people are just as sure that they are something like an island unto themselves, needing no one. Somewhat difficult to understand, one thing I do understand though is there can be no changing the way I feel. I've been totally honest, and trying to keep my eyes wide open in certain things, I am still under his spell.

      It's raining tonight... Just wonder how the weather's gonna be in a few days. Will there be a "White Christmas? We shall see... A little stretch up ahead for the next two weeks, filling in for someone on vacation. But I don't mind a bit, I was telling them at work when they noticed the schedule. It just means overtime, which translates very well on the next check. :) I'm still doing the cookie thing, I'm supposed to make some tonight, too. I think this is gonna end up being the most I've done with that since, well since I was in Fresno. Like I said, it's about time I got back into the swing of Christmas, and I'm really enjoying it. Later on I'm to help my daughter Laura wrap presents when she comes by after work. So anyway, I'd better get started with those cookies, break out the cutters and the cookie press, mwahahahaha!  Lol, I guess the holidays are affecting me a little strange this year. Later, people. Take care.

      Christmas is less than a week away now, I've done most of my shopping, baked cookies for friends and for parties at work. I'm hoping I might have some free time to catch a good Christmas movie on tv. Something like A Christmas Story, or Its a Wonderful Life.  I think I still have the tape of A Christmas Carol, the one with Patrick Stewart. That was a good version, I really like that one. Also I haven't had much chance to listen to the right music for this time of year. Mostly my kids say that its pretty lame, so they pop in a FedUp cd instead. Aaaaaack! Ok, I like FedUp and all but give it a rest for about 20 or 30 minutes, this is Christmas. Lol. My daughter's grandparents are in from Boston, they came by for a bit yesterday. Very nice people. But I see so much of a gap between them and my daughter. I think I'm in a place where I can see both sides, where my daughter doesn't understand, and gets frustrated with them. Maybe its all that time working with the elderly, in the past... I'm just more used to it, and can understand a bit more. Anyway, I think I have some more last minute stuff to do... will post more later. Take care, everybody.

      Questions  What happens to the voice, your space, the place you cut out, settled into  so well when changed perspective is an opportunity, when you animate the figures, figments of imagination.

      Christmas Candles  Tonight I want to light them all. One for the honorable homesick yet serving tours of duty,  the ones who still live and breathe. Light one for the casualties gone and for those yet to cme. Another candle for the smallest and most helpless discarded even now to be rescued by random strangers. Let the strangers light them one by one. Put match to wick for Precious Doe and all those like her, let the flame burn till molesters, abusers, killers, butchers are punished. Provide the warmth of such a flame for the family pet tethered in the snow with no food and a bowl  of ice to drink. Add one to dispel the reunion squabbles and stress that comes from forgetting the spirit of compassion and the reason for this day.

      Yes Virginia... Grandma Ginney. Christmas songs can make you cry... Happy Christmas (War Is Over)... Bing Crosby and David Bowie's version of Little Drummer Boy... And without meaning to, the people closest to you can make you cry, the ones you love the most. Not necessarily a bad thing, just the fact that when they unexpectedly show such appreciation for the intangibles you've given, it hits full force... What's wrong with me, I'm such a wimp today.

      The other day I saw an old friend who I hadn't talked to in years... she used to be married to my uncle, my dad's brother, before he died.  Death...  She didn't know about my grandma, didn't know about my mom. "Well you don't have any family left, do you?"  Did I mention she had always suffered from Foot-in-mouth disease?  Not that she ever gave a crap about it, always the same old Sandy. On second thought, why did I ever consider this person a friend?

      "It's not television... it's H2O." I was channel surfing last night and happened onto a preview of the new shows on cable. The Sopranos start up again sometime in March, it sure has been awhile. I wish they'd put def Poetry Jam back on, been awhile for that too. A documentary next week also, HBO: America Undercover - Shelter Dogs... I even penciled it in on my calendar, I think I may even record it.   Our department at the hospital has survived the changeover, so far. The new CEO is supposed to arrive sometime next month, and there have been quite a few cosmetic upgrades to coincide. As far as detary dept., things in the cafeteria had started out pretty good at first, but everything is now so over priced I'm wondering how long it will take before everyone starts bringing their lunch instead of having to pay those outrageous prices. Even the old standbys that were always the most inexpensive; I ask you, how many people would be willing to have a small bowl of soup for $4.  Also, (and this is going to be the worst, I think) The housekeepers have always gotten their drinks for no charge. For me, it's my coffee. But I think that's the next thing, they're gonna start charging us for our coffee, this could very well start a revolt, hahaha.  New management has been in place for a little over a week now. The only thing I really have to say about that is the opportunity for "teamwork" is nearly nonexistent. What is so wrong about letting a "project person" go help with patient rooms or dismissals when help is needed? We're still so shorthanded as it is, and the workload has doubled for nearly everyone. Discouraging teamwork is just plain stupidity.... just my opinion, here.

      Sentinel  The reflection never goes away really, still there someplace in the wishing,  it's the first brightness to find, an everpresent sentinel for all its shapes and status. I whisper alone how tall  you stand hovering before the break of today, look who provides company in the presence of such well-earned solitude... For some, this moment proves itself a harsh witness, the   reality of bitter chill, forced biting  wind to sear the soul, thinking the   reflection has gone when it has only been hidden from sight by change.

      Wealthy In Ways That Matter  Even as the winding down of  Hogmany nights became a recent memory, the old overtaken by new, through spirit, for good times with no time limits... Even as in this early morning trudging through frozen stucco formed on sidewalks, I'd rather turn loose wonder and optimism, let them run free  through a wide open stance  of what is now realization,  a clean page in progress still wearing its heart right there on its sleeve, seems it was  always outside myself looking in. But now that the zerrissenheit has passed, I find the richness in privacy and I'm wealthy  in ways that matter.  (zerrissenheit, from the German, meaning a state of "torn-apart-hood)

      Sunday through Thursday - I can't wait for my day off tomorrow. I can't wait for them to send me my W2s in the mail so I can get my taxes done and refund back, so I can turn loose of it all and finally be free and current. I can't wait for this work day to be over with. Today, the one that hasn't even started yet.  Oh yeah, Friday is Greg Cordum's last day before he goes out to Palm Beach. We're having a little going away party for him today. Palm Beach, very expensive out there... I guess Andy likes his position out in Michigan. The Sodexo people are saying their goodbyes... I still don't know for sure if our immediate supervisors are staying or not. That part is still up in the air. That is, if they know, they're not saying. Anyway last week I gave Greg my number and email, hopefully to keep in touch. Ideally he'd put me in contact with somebody out east somewhere.  But if nothing else, I was hoping him and Andy would at least be a good reference... That's all for now. More later.

      Bane  Look around you, look up.  Listen to the voices and music in your ears, hold the phones tight, tighter against your head, blocking out the irritation, great huge electronic battles from the box in the other room. Perpetual, the  thorn in my side, the bane of my existential... You tap a shoulder into a start and a half-jump "you artists are so focused" disdainful,  mocking, damning ideals with a muttering under breath. Not soon enough, but soon you will be gone with your systems,  all your toys and playthings,  but when... Not yet, only "soon."

      Well the holidays are over... It was a long 11-day stretch, working through Christmas and filling in for people on vacation. And I still can't believe how hard we were hit with dismissals and new admits on Christmas Eve and day. They were saying last time, it wasn't like that at all. So I am definitely enjoying these three days off!  Had a great New Years, stayed in and relaxed, unwinding... Talked to some good friends online, had some Irish coffee at midnight, stayed up for a while longer, then went to bed. Laura's grandparents were in town from Boston, it's always nice to see them. They've always treated me and Jason very well. We all went out to dinner Tuesday night at the Cracker Barrel. I'd never been there and it was pretty nice. We joked about what we ended up having, three of us got the same thing, the other two were identical as well. It was like a hand in poker, a "full house." And actually the place was a full house, very busy, hahaha. Yesterday was Laura's birthday, she had her party at the Golden Corral buffet. She's 19, and wonders if she should feel old, since so many of her friends are younger than her, but says she really doesn't feel any older.  Thinking about the past year. As with most of us, there's been a lot of good and some bad... a lot of stuff that needs to be changed for the better. A lot of old, worn-out situations that are way overdue to be gotten rid of. So, resolutions?... I'm going to clean house big time, put the trash on the curb, (hahaha). Start over, start fresh, make a clean break. Sounds vague I know, but those who know me know exactly what I'm talking about.  I'd like to take the first steps toward getting published. A friend told me he thought it was a good idea, since I have enough material now for a book, a collection of poems. And even though I understand the process might even take a full year from start to finish, I think it'll be worth it.  I'd also like to attend more readings, if I can find them. Maybe even participate again. I did once at Barnes and Noble, and it scared me to death. I think since it's been so long, I'll probably be just as scared all over again to do a second one. I want to finally say I actually support the ASPCA, such a great organization and resource, I think, with the education efforts and policy they have. Just want to take an active stance on the issue of animal cruelty and neglect. Well I think that's the basis for what I'd like to do in the coming year. It's a good start, anyway...

      Thunder, Free  Thunder, the gray even longer now there have been better days. Something closed and the sky  opened to its own defeat, released a wall built on itself  and left me the rain to walk in.  Thunder clap lay me down to dream in clover, rolling  green and hillsides of  thatched rooftops. The air is free and breathable here and if you close your eyes now and listen close, I swear you could hear the sound of pipes low in the distance.            ...I don't want to keep feeling this way. They say silence is golden. No. Silence hurts, silence hurts.

      Cover Me  Only when we are together again for  the first time, I'll  watch you trace your  path through images like falling snow  and shadows  Winding your way  along the ups and downs across arches and long stretches of my patience I am waiting...  Cover me and show me the ache from these  things you dream of,  how your breath can melt frost against skin, tasting, turning the tide against time and distance, how longing  can overwhelm, how I wait.

      Rapid Eye  In the recesses, collective you with the sub-self image under memory, under water, under lock and key. They were lost in an instant those visions, only during sleep. A mistake to believe they could be found on waking. And there it happens again,  that I was too lazy, too tired, too cold to search room to room for a pad of paper and a pencil. If this was a quest for a dream tonight, would I  have remembered those circles spiraling knots and overlapping like the rope of  a lifeline just out of reach.

      Truman and Sterling  "Cheer up... It'll get worse."  He's the lead, he should know these things, such perky banter,  and I'm listening, listening  to the overlays like hours in  the day expanding into the dark  with no way to and fro.. It's dangerous out there at  night, just last Tuesday, a shooting right there on the corner, where I turn, at the corner where Regional  appears in the distance... I wonder, which of the four corners  heard the report first. A shot to ring  just once, grazing the arm of the victim. Still something to consider... "Oh cheer up, it'll get worse"  (One aspect to this poem: There's someone where I work who does actually tell people that... at first, I thought he may have been kidding. But as time goes on, with more and more of these changes at work, I'm starting to wonder how much of a joke he really means it as.)

      Text  Words so powerful they accost my eyes, my need when I am alone and you tell me how to imagine your hands. Words like heat, like rythm built from the campfire or the rattler poised to strike in the foothills of Yosemite. I realized no sense of place there then, or here now except in the past,  so I say onward and upwards and toward a journey which is adventure, destination known as passionate, peaceful

      Watcher Of The Skies  In summer, twilight,  jeans on the beach, feet burned and branded  now in criss-cross patterns by leather sandals and the sun earlier in the day. Then as darkness begins  its seance, calling spirits that appear upwards in distance beyond miles... The whisper of his touch brings a comfort,  his hand having found mine to lead me to that favored spot suitable for viewing with the naked eye. This is the place,  and so we sit, waiting, watching for them, one  by one. And the whisper  again, this time his voice in my ear, conveying the legends, histories, the science and magic of the skies at night.

      Paper Machete  That frustration flies pell-mell at all of us like a rude pinata swinging through the air on a vine from branches of some ant-infested skeleton, hell-bent as it is with a vengeance on creating conflict within the ranks, undermining autonomy... "Take that," it screams to the next in line. "I'll grab what isn't broken and fix it up even better than before, blasting out miscommunication to an unheard of level, the decibels of such silence will burst the eardrums  for the lot of you. Will there not be anyone willing enough to stand against me after this? This decomposed shamble of organization, this hollow shell you see imploding under the weight of pure idiocy before your very eyes? Before I'm done here, there will be no weapon, no paper machete strong enough to cut  through my red tape.   (I know this isn't all that appropriate for the day, lol. But I had to get this out on paper last night. ... and after I told myself and others I wouldn't think about work on my days off, haha.)

      Amazing... I was planning to sleep in today since it is my day off. But here I am, up at 4 a.m. just like any other day. I find that once I'm up early in the morning like this, it's impossible to go back to sleep, so I'm up for the day, I guess. Just as well, I have tons to do. Get a plan of action and go with it.. a big move, simplify the accumulation.. This is the goal, and I take it seriously. Now that I have my space back, my dreams are my own, my life is my own, I'm doing with it what I choose to do. I have the freedom now to make these decisions for me, and never more have to babysit the tantrums of a videogame addict. Freedom... is good, is a new start from scratch, is being able to choose this.

      Spooked  In somehow chilling ways that  the paranormal begins to haunt with words, a combination of presence growing in faith, dreams, images to call home, to rest... to rest. Full throttle, they travel east  from here with each step over these grounded whitecaps frozen in time. The air is bitter, unstable footing and a twisted ankle, ice packed for  both. It was a force, for lack of  something more specific to recall,  that made me repeat those exact words and then read them again for the first time in spooked context.

      The mood at work has been chaotic, morale is way down to an all time low, there's people wanting to leave, move on... and if the new management can't see that, they're more of a collective blind fool than I ever gave them credit for. It's all a mess. I can't seem to get into a good writing mode lately. There's always something going on, at least for the past couple of days. I need to simplify things or something. Just cut out all the extraneous crap, like tv, even the internet, where I tend to browse all the stuff I don't really need to go.. such a time waster really, when you think about it. I think all that has to do with the fact that I was not able to access anything for a while. It's all kind of brand new again, so to speak...I haven't posted much, haven't given as much attention to the groups as I should have in the last few days, since I got back online.. That needs to change.  So - I guess the word for today is "focus." Focus on what's important.  I'm tired of talking about work.. A friend from Lee's Summit came by last night and it was pleasant and everything but the conversation was mostly about how messed up everything is out there, and at the hospital I work at. Sometimes it just seems I can't get away from it, haha. When I'm there, I just can't wait for time to clock out, and for my days off.

      It's good to be back. Online. I've been away for a while with no access to any of my poetry groups, no email, no xanga... the list goes on. It's amazing how we come to depend on technology like this. Sometimes you take it for granted when it's there everyday, to use. It's a tool, faster communication, sometimes the only communication in some cases. And when it's gone, there's a big hole taken out of you life, like something took a big chunk of your humanity. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is communication is key. Essential to the well being of anybody, really. Take that away for too long and I would guess you'd have some type of dysfunction. Well enough "Deep Thoughts" by Bailey.... It's been way too cold out here in KC. Got some snow last week, ice underneath it. Makes for dangerous roads with no traction, hard to get to work in all that. They closed the schools twice... I know my daughter is thankful that since she's a senior she doesn't have to make up the snow days. What else... The hospital situation is in chaos. Awful timing for that, with joint commission coming up in a few months. They're hiring an outside cleaning team to come in and make ready just for the inspection. Why do that when they should have been keeping some of the full-timers on to begin with so that we can keep up with things and on a regular basis the way it should be done, the way it used to be done. *grumble, grumble*  Idiots.  Haha, I even asked "Hey since I went through joint commission last year at Lee's Summit, do you mind if I sit this one out?"  It was a no-go. Oh well, it was worth a shot.

      Someone For Agnes  After ten years she sits beneath a desk partition that holds a telephone, an appointment book, a rolodex page dogeared with the name and number of the local vet. Day after day she's there near the source of communication as if understanding the one-sided conversations that sometimes mentions her by name. It's then that with ears perked, the slow wag of a tail, one paw after the other, she emerges from shaded sanctuary, lifting  just her head; to move with more  energy would surely prove  too painful now. Day after day the wait is for the one-sided to change everything, the wait  is in vain, grows more tired, perpetual, listless there, now barely able to move, now fed by hand, now the merciful has  been called for Agnes, and now with the few final breaths,  rests painless forever under  a full moon.

      Clarity in Glass  Dreams of you awaken as the rain patterns alternate light and heavy rythms against the surface outside. Moving through the near pitch-black of this room I hear it closer now,  more demanding at windows still blanketed away for winter storms. Hear the rain and wonder the whys, the reason, cause and effect, the purpose unclear if only for a moment. Listening, and grateful for the pleasant coolness of insulated glass, the truest conductor against doubt, at least for tonight.

      A moment of discovery here... I was browsing some Yahoo groups dealing with books and I happened across one of my favorite writers, Diana Gabaldon. One of them listed the official website, which is:  http://www.its.caltech.edu~gatti/gabaldon/gabaldon.html     The site has updates on current and future projects, posted by Gabaldon herself. What I was really excited about was news of two new books, The Fiery Cross (I already knew about this one, but haven't read it yet) and one that's in the works right now, called A Breath of Snow and Ashes.   If anyone has read the Outlander series, they must know how addictive these books are. I felt I just had to share this with anyone who might be interested. I thought this was some good news, and definitely something to look forward to.

      The Pit  "Excuse me, I know you're busy but could you please separate the white from that egg and  cook just the yolk?" Quizzical, a quick scan for the source among a thousand starving students having converged on me... Why me?  "Coach said eat heathier" Oh yeah.. the tall guy, standing slightly on the right in a letter jacket, a Bulldog, one of the elite, star player, no nevermind to me. But at least polite, unlike most so I comply, and besides, takes less time than to argue why I shouldn't.  And so it goes, day after day, inbetween the trio shouts of "I wanna breakfast burrito!" But I wanna hear that in unison... in unison. So when their order comes simultaneously (one more voice and they'd have a killer  barbershop quartet) I nod approval, give thumbs-up and a grin, announce,  "That was awesome!" and give extra sausage in each. And then it happened. Right hand person fired on the spot  for giving back verbal abuse to another  disgruntled failing student, and I'm left all alone back here. Next day the replacement caught by  the request of the health-food jock puts him in his place.. No way can we  do that, too much time, not in the middle of this rush... But if you come back earlier  tomorrow I could have the grains in your  wheat toast all picked out for you...

      Each One a Gift  I was the interloper, tresspassing through unfamiliar territory treading back into a past that wasn't mine. All the names in my head now and meanings that were hidden and left behind for the sake of sarcasm, the surreal. Did I even belong there at all? But even now I can't help myself. I am drawn to  this place like cold needing flame to warm and time that aches to bridge the enormity of distance... I am here because in between the lines, between the roughest of edginess and caustic sentiment elements of issue and molten rock, I found wishes and dreams, flights of daring, desparate lonliness,  emotion spanning the lowest lows and upward highs. I found such magic. Each one a sterling vision, each one a gift.

      Concrete  More the phoenix to find new beginnings from its ashes, I trace a crescent skyward  symbol barely seen at times like filters through a faded night. This could never be traded, what is shared in private intimacy, and so I say to you an easier way has never  been considered,  was never asked for. And I will also tell you risk is courage, is life,  is concrete and faith in  you is solid. And so I could never run away from this.

      Aaaah! It's only Tuesday.. this is the feeling you get when you no longer enjoy your job, when you'd rather be anywhere else but there, at that place, when everyone you work with looks as tired and stressed as you feel. And you think to yourself, it's only Tuesday, there's at least three more days to get through till some relief. I detest corporations, they've always proven to be more trouble than what they're worth. I've seen the meltdown of places like this more than once, when faceless suits and sharp dressers with clipboards in hand, monitoring, in person, spying with gadgetry, the whereabouts.. at all times. Its surprising there aren't hidden cameras in the restrooms yet. Just to see who goes, and how many times, maybe even checking to see how many little squares of toilet paper is used, so they can counter that against the brand new furniture they buy for the lobbies, the lobbies ahead of the dirt we can no longer afford time to get to. All the while, they buy, they buy up a storm. See all those shiny new trash cans near the broken down elevators.. reminds me of mansions and shacks.. and it makes no sense to anyone but those who riddle theories with invisible ink.

      HTML is a four letter word. It's quicksand to drown in.. Greek to misunderstand, futile to try and appease the hypertext gods, they are angry and will punish till you finally happen on something so simple you can't believe that you overlooked it... I'm really hoping that is the case here. I'm lucky to even be posting now, I guess. Well, we'll see what happens.

      Strange events and happenings in and around the hospital of late. We had a homeless character wander in one day last week creating havoc and making a general mess of things. First he stuffed his pockets with the decorative lava rock he found at the entrance, and used them to design a pentagram on the lobby's information desk. From there he went into the cafeteria, opened and dumped bottles of tobasco sauce over the tables and floor. Then he proceeded to the chapel, to pray... well, I guess the chapel represented the wrong faith so he set fire to the $200 bible that was sitting on the podium. All this took place before I arrived, so I certainly had my clean-up work cut out for me.. lol. The strange thing about it was, it was almost like he timed the whole thing perfectly, almost as if he knew where to go next, to delay his being caught. He did eventually get caught, the security personnel called for the police and he was arrested and taken away.  And just a few days ago, strange too, that this latest corresponded to the full moon, we had some crazy flasher walking around in a trenchcoat. I more than wonder about that place sometimes, lol. On a better note, some good news. Publish America has accepted my book, "I Am Ready." So excited about this, I was really happy when I first learned of it.. and I'm really looking forward to the whole process.

      The Whispering  Trace with your fingers the length of my body head to toe, then back again. Taste me as I'm tasting your warmth on my lips. Take this need and make me weak, obliterate rational thought in the complete way that you do. If you feed on my hunger now, I will no longer feel the ache so deep, emptiness will no longer make it's home there,    there will be no fear, only the lightness of a gentle touch returning to you with the whispering of your name.

      Psych 101  And the lecture hall rang  with the shouts and cheers  of some one hundred of  the unprepared on exam day when the lights went out.  So there he stands, caught like a deer in a sideways stream, the only source  of brightness is from  an open door... Papers of essay questions  clutched in hand, ready to administer  due process on a curve.  There he stands, still unbelieving such reaction,  that thorough joy at the  point of escaping the hook. Angry now, he stands sizing up the crowd, lightning from his eyes to match the  storm that caused this outrage.  "Ok," he says.... "Ok" then turns to leave in a huff and within five minutes, returns with a box of some one hundred  pen lights.     -- Several years ago I took some classes at Fresno City College. This actually happened during a general psychology class. Well, everything except for the pen lights, lol.

      Whenever I come back to work after a few days off, there are more surprises. This last time, I found out that we had lost a few more co-workers. One had transfered to another location, and the other took an early retirement. One of the others told me the same thing, about coming in and finding out even more changes.. He told me the other day, "Well, I see your still here.." we both had to laugh about that, because the way things are going, there's not going to be anyone left in the place. Plus now, there sending people home early on days when it's slow in their particular area, not taking into consideration that someone else may be totally swamped in their area, with back to back dismissals.. the supervisor keeps telling us that we're supposed to be a "team"  that's all well and fine, if you put the theory in practice, but the procedure now.. where's the teamwork in that?  I'm just so tired of the miscommunications, when she tells us anything at all, it's the wrong info. So tired of the contradictions.. It's a total mess I want out of.  I'm washing my hands of the whole damn thing.

      It was sobering. Intense and powerful, almost too powerful to watch.. Last Saturday I went to see the movie, The Passion of The Christ. There are so many terrible things people can do to each other, it boggles the mind. What Jesus, the man went through continuously for those last days he was on earth was all the brutality human nature has ever been capable of. I don't know, I'm still trying to sort out all those references and images from the movie, and I never really considered myself an overly religious person. I just don't know. You'd have to go see the movie to get a real grasp on what I'm talking about, I think. I do know this, though... This movie will not be forgotten.

      Patience  Before the golden days of television, before talkies, before and after radio played out skits and teased imagination with wondering the visuals. Before digital cuts and 3-D glasses, computer generated anime, slow-mo and bullet time... There were purists manipulating images, burning and dodging, light and dark, shadows with grain, knowledge never fully auto-focused. There was trial and error, learning, discovery, painstaking slow and finding patience along the way, certain all along the best image was the one worth waiting for.

      "Even though I know, I don't wanna know. Yeah, I guess I know. I just hate how it sounds."  Aaah, you know sometimes I think I feel too much. Drive myself crazy over everything. Empathy, the empath does that so well.  I have this incredible need to be needed, in whatever small capacity there may be. But then doesn't everybody? I have these hopes and dreams but what good are they if you can't share them with your friends. The people closest to you, the ones that can understand you when no one else can, or will, or take the time. Emo-ness, lol, that's what this is..  Maybe its just a self-pity fest.. but nothing wrong with getting it all out.. that's how healing is attained. Love lost, heartsick, it sure takes a lot out of a person. I don't ever wanna go through it again..  what might have been... I'll never know.

Your touch  could ignite everything I hold deep  and dear, trembling and open only to one man. Your truth has been  a complicated one so  difficult to gather, to piece together yet truth the same, in sincerity. I think that hope is the one thing left worth holding.

      Every floor, every department was at over 100 percent capacity yesterday. Plus, the nurses kept us all busy playing musical beds, haha. Yeah. Moving patients from room to room, each time they do that, the entire bed has to be cleaned for the next patient. So... a lot of unnecessary work. And a lot of stressed-out housekeepers. Someone I work with came up to me yesterday, said "I'm looking for some ceiling hooks."  - ok, why? -  He said, "That's where we're gonna have to put the next patient, hang 'em from the hooks..."  Well, it certainly helps to have a sense of humor through it all.

      As The Crow Flies  Nice day to be a bird...  Especially this one here I see has freedom in the  heart and a song in mind, calling, calling to anyone who'll listen. Perched atop the highest point of the  Taco Bell sign I just passed. With its own voice and dreams  of tomorrow, as if to say "I've worked and plowed through struggles and confusion, focused on personal injustices, dreams of becoming, something to my name like appreciation earned... I have waited twelve years for this moment."       (Ahhh... Graduation is in the air.  :)

      Made a trip out to Best Buy, and then to Barnes and Noble this past weekend, and picked up Parachutes, by Coldplay. Excellent, I've been wanting to get that for a long time, and I always loved the song, "Yellow." Barnes and Noble had the book I wanted, If You Want To Write, by Brenda Ueland.. I've barely gotten started on it and already I know this is gonna be a great one to go back through over and over again.  I went looking through some Charles Bukowski books when I was there. I think there was more of his books on the shelf than anyone elses. Someone on Xanga posted one of his poems a few weeks ago, and I was really impressed with this Bukowski.. I'd always heard of him but never read any poems of his, but now, what little I've seen I really like..  hmmm.  Bukowski rocks the boat right out of the water, lol.  This afternoon coming home from work, I passed by the Taco Bell. And I kept hearing this bird call, so looking up, I saw this huge crow perched up at the highest point of the sign, just making himself known.. this went on for like five minutes, till he flew away, and I turned to see where, just following his path.. There has to be something to be found there.. something creative, free, or just plain a different angle to be seen. Some analogy that I'm close to.

      Are You  Benoit! Voiced from a distance  across the field of litter, paraphanalia and trailer trash. Are you Charles Benoit of Liberty? Are you? Murderer of the small and weak? Benoit! Serial killer in the making? Can you feel my eyes now burning poisoned darts through the back of your miserable skull, focused for vengeance on your despicable motive? The shrunken black heart that you possess, that you've always possessed. Benoit!  I saw what you did, we all saw what you did for sport, from an afternoon of beer and weed, maybe you even  shot up that day. Did your veins feel it? Feel heat like hot coals,  the same burning embers you drowned a life in? I hope that you did, hope  you forgot even to bleach your works. Benoit! We all heard what you said in order to free yourself of witnesses and charges. Witnesses and charges always return to hiss and claw  and bite back the way you  have come now, are you really  free. Come now, have you looked  over your shoulder lately? Benoit! Can you sleep at night? Can you look in the mirror? Friends and enemies, my friend. Which ones can you trust?    (Sometimes I can barely contain my anger over people who torture and kill animals. In this case there is an actual Charles Benoit, did actually live in Liberty, Missouri at the time. Three years ago, he was arrested and charged with animal cruelty after holding a stray kitten down in a hot grill. The kitten died after being taken to the vet, and later the charges were dropped after the witness was harassed with death threats from his friends.)

      Tis The Season  They say these storms  bring hard water early on...  And I am watching the skies  constant for familiar patterns, circular movement there, that signals the beginning of chaos multiplied by the finger of God.  Irony that, how the new life of such a season can still  bring destruction and death for the unfortunate handful of those caught randomly  unprepared.

      Can't Forget  Digging deep,  ever deep through the surface, try and find your windows to the world.  Oh, and how you delve higher, penetrating deeper still, whispering to me your intentions.  This is what makes you  the shadow that takes my breath. It's the voice that stops my heart, the one thing that leaves me shaken and calling your name when I stumble. I can't forget.

      Farewell Show  Such long distances they came, over Rivendale, through woods and tangled brush, finally stopping at the point where  Arlington meets Abbington, they had traveled far on one last hope, and by now had become fed up hometown heroes ready to begin  flogging Molly for the messed up directions she gave. "But," she stammers, over the wireless, "It's just over the horizon, a  dead giveaway, I swear, you can't miss it."  Lost and late, but arrival and destination reached. Now the music is in full swing. Bagpipes missed but the CD proves awesome,  loud and stirring to those in favor. This crowd forms in random circles, each overtaking, overtalking its own din.  But between the set... "Lo, hark."  I mean, "Yo, listen up." "Did you guys hear that?" "Sounded like a sneeze, who was that?" ("Aaatch, eeee!")  "What the - huh? There it is again" "Bless you, and Gsundteit!" ("Caaatch Meee!")  And suddenly from beside us a goth chick with spiked hair and thirty piercings cried out, "O Romeo, thou hast stage-dived and met with the cruelest of floors, and now idiocy finds you tragic not once, mind you, but thrice!"  Ego bruised and pride gone  after the fall, Romeo slinks  back up on stage, reclaims his  spot, grabbing the bass, all  ready now, they can finally begin serious fun and game time.   A night not to be forgotten, a night not without incident to be sure, when the bouncer  is bounced and THE song promised never to be played again is played again, for all the  old times, and for new beginnings,  for luck and success, and "Don't  forget.." all the little people who were there before you signed.  (A local Christian Punk band, Fed*Up, has been signed for a record deal. This was an account (at least my version of it) of their last show here in the area before they moved to Tennessee.)

      "Baseball, hotdogs, apple pie and Chevrolet" Let me rephrase that, take liberties with  this long forgotten ad campaign and come up with a similar slogan much more to my liking on things "American." "Soccer, veggie burgers with sprouts, coconut creme, and a restored '65 Mustang" A personalized opinion, and probably trivial as well, but isn't that what makes us individuals in the collective, a part of the big picture, but living, breathing, seeing, observing things "outside the box?" I have not participated in the past two presidential elections.. my son gives me a look of disdain when I say that. He wants to be part of the process, he wants me to be part of the process. The truth is, I haven't cared for politics at the governmental level... I mean, why do that when you have all the corporate politics you can handle already, shoved down your throat? But this is the year, they say.. "make a difference." Blah, blah, blah. Its the same old rheteric, with a few clever sound bytes. Very few. Campaigns are promises that no one has ever been able to back up. What I'm trying to say is that every four years it's the same... points made, records examined, mud slung and the spin always threatening to reach new levels of confusion. Never mind any of that, I'm just trying to get by, gain more stable ground personally. Why would someone like me care about Bush, or Kerry, or any one of them?     So, I guess I should apologize in advance for the apathy here. I may change my stance, in time. Maybe.

      Fell asleep last night trying to watch the news.. fell asleep sitting up, and stayed that way the whole night.. These different hours everyday are a killer. The worst is on the days I have to start so late, getting out of there as late as all that just totally sucks, I'm worn-out all the time because of it. Damn HCA, I can't wait to leave.

      Silent  Pray for rain to cry in, to walk in with no shelter against this night, so that I can drop to my knees unable to find speech, form sound,  the salt that blurs my sight such pain, searing gut instinct. Palm flat to rocks and earth, makeshift safety, for peace of mind I'm tapping the ground, please, tapping out some subconscious code,  take these feelings away, take these feelings away. And you are watching through still cold branches of trees, through clouds, through millions of miles, perhaps judging, perhaps not. I am too blind to see you  but I know you are there, silent, ever present nightly, glowing, turning profile to each phase, I know you  are there, offering solace.

      Aftermath  I'm left with a heart  that still beats strong with conviction to heal, a soul that can still  cry at times for him who has found another. No matter the damage done that was never intended, no matter. I found no waste in time  for the risk of it all, saw no fair or unfair through those feelings that simply are, where and when they are, impossible to second-guess. I have been left with no bitter thoughts, words. I have no more fear.

      Recalling A Dream  Take the boat out on the water at midnight under the stars in the open air, just to feel the coolness of the ocean, just to listen for a liquid break of movement on the surface  against the wood. I close my eyes to listen for the words "salt" and "sea" and remember only panoramic  photos of the World's Lighthouses, given last Christmas to friends  on the way home to Boston. I close my eyes to recall the dream, sitting on that bench there,  along the boardwalk, shedding bitter pieces of meaning, my heart poured out to a faceless kindred soul. I close my eyes to recall a strange chance taken, spoken wisdom, silent tears giving way to sobbing the truth of lacking clarity, then on to finding direction. The dream was years ago and forgotten. Forgotten until now, it must be years to the day and a day later.

      Personified  If you listen you can hear it, the sound of a heart beating  still, the sound of a loss so  hard to bear... Survivalists say of the strong, running to something is far better than running away. I am not running away... What is there to run to now when the unshakeable has been  brought to the core. Why would there be nothing save the whys of pain and emotion that  have become this nightmare.  He still haunts my waking hours, still haunts through the long ago  and far away, where he sat next to me  at the ocean,  prophecy personified, a faceless dream offering  consolation to a life torn, to  a light having gone out, how  much clarity is needed now? How was I to know this would be the consolation?

      Anesthesia, Stat  Misunderstanding stopped us  in the hall one morning on the way to break, said that the overhead page  reminded her of a story of the  daughter of the Tsar of Russia.. No, that was Anastasia.  They say her mind is going, losing track of time. She didn't used to be like this.  Held me up for an hour once with ramblings of her son, how he should find religion, and God.  She jokes sometimes about  eventually ending up as patient on the lock-up unit. Should I tell her they're starting to take her seriously? Who's misunderstanding?

      Wheres the motivation to write today, for  all the yesterdays that I haven't written a thing. I think what I really need to do is just get away, in the other room with just the paper and pen and write... anything. See I have all these things in my head, somehow getting pushed back again, and again. Sometimes its like that for me though, it happens when I can no longer wait to put something down, some of the best stuff I've ever written has been the ones to come out all in a rush of words, when there's no stopping them. Its almost like a flood, either that or the thesaurus exploded. Funny image that, exploding thesaurus's... like a volcano, and the words land just anywhere on the page. Its a start. At this point, anything is a good start. Well, it's settled then. I'm off to light a fire under the imagination. See what I come up with.

      More of the similar, only when it's again those you think you're closest to are too busy to spend time. Always running off with friends, I don't know why the kid even bothered to come over in the first place, didn't come in till after I was asleep, then was already gone again when I got home from work. Again. Ok, that's what's been bugging me. That and the struggling and the writing and the nearly everything I can't grasp.

      I feel I've been like a sponge for everyone's bad experiences lately, some of the people I work with. It's draining, zaps so much energy. I probably need to step back from them. If any one of them felt like this they would do the same. It wouldn't be so bad if there wasn't so much of it at once.  So this is my reasoning for why I haven't been quite myself the past few days. It took a while, then again, there may be another reason, I just don't know.

      Tempest  Tempest  What have the stars conspired  with you tonight, so full the moon and me so empty, alone and wanting. What language does the rain speak. He could be the wind tonight, pulled through branches, dynamic among new leaves, swirling with insistant push-pull of circling at me, around me, invisible, haunting and distant.  Then returning, again haunting, its only his face in my mind when I close  my eyes, only his touch to dream of. Such dreams are difficult when  there is no sleep.

      Burlap to Cashmere (and back again)  When they break things down  that should be unbroken, like life,  to each their own pursuit of happiness of a dream,  or even just to eke out survival...  When they fake living, match hell on earth with pounding fists, bruises and broken bones I never expected to see...  When still others spew violent premonition with skinhead tags written on wall meant for healing, now instead a recruitment poster for gang membership...  When a jealous woman turns psychotic, turns vandal, stalking, threats on machine, unsigned letters and face-to-face confrontations...  I don't want to read about  the end of another friendship in the papers.

      Small Kisses  Kiss me for the shallowness of breath that you bring,  for the delicious weak moments I have in these time alone when I call your name. I have waited so long I can imagine now my softest touch to you, to smooth  your hair, or my fingers  gently moving  across the shadows  of your face. Eyes can lock in shades  of blue and brown for the extension of sensing. Small kisses to you, my love, and playful tongues that turn serious, as moments take us  both to this higher level where we are the safest within each other.

      I spoke to my old boss today, who also works weekends at the hospital, and at the nursing home across the street the rest of the time. There may be something there that's available for part-time evenings. I'll talk to her again probably around Tuesday. Just think, possibly working for Doris Brown again, lol. "Well, ya know..."  I can't really tell at this point whether my daughter will be making her trip out to Canada after all. She took out yesterday morning a little after 8 a.m. I phoned her at 7 with a wake up call, and then again later to wish her luck.. But around 2 in the afternoon I got a text message on my phone saying "My car died." In Sioux City, Iowa. So, after letting it cool down a bit, she was able to start it back up again, but by that time and many phone calls later, she was on her way back into town in order to get the car checked out. This afternoon it was still in the shop, so I guess right now the entire trip is still up in the air. It would be such a shame to cancel. She's been planning this thing for months now.. I really hope the car checks out all right so she'll at least be able to start out again tomorrow, even if it is a late start.  Poem about the moon (previous post) also about old friends, ones that go way back, that I've completely lost touch with. Maybe not so old friends.. just got to wondering what if I hadn't have made those awful choices I did, I would have been better off, maybe even happy, less lonely. I don't know. Was I really so stubborn to make the wrong choices? Maybe I was.  Then relatively new friends... that I feel so lost without the contact. Just some thoughts that entered the atmosphere. So today they've focused at times somewhere in Blue Springs.. and also sometimes much further away..

      Abstractions  Didn't you know... the abstract has always  been my familiar?  Much like rainbow water on fresh blacktop after last night's storm.  Or that the feeling of repeating, repitan, is an absolute like an online Buk wav that skips on every fifth word, fifth word, and its deja vu all over again.  But its the voice betraying an image of its owner, I'd much more expect a growl, like Moulton's Casa de Frute, effectively clearing seats at the Wild Blue to make room for friends and those of like minds.

      Bench With a View  It's the same here as these rivets all the way up this wall... Sixteen per rectangle, some forty feet high and climbing out in the open, and above. Let's see how dangerous human nature can make this wall.  It's the same height that the deer went over after wandering too far into the city, chased even by unarmed fools into falling, leapt up  and over what looked like so little, but dropping the distance to the  alley below.  Human nature...  I want their names and addresses, too. I have plenty of time to catch up to them.

It was decided today that if I could find a part time position, I could eventually save up. And I may have found one already. There was one listed at the place I used to work at. It's close to my other job, the hours would be perfect, and it's exactly what I used to do before, so I may have a good shot at it.. Wish me luck, folks.  :)

      Here's another one from Buk (I couldn't resist)   the trash can   this is great, I just wrote two poems I didn't like.  there is a trash can on this computer. I just moved the poems over and dropped them into the trash can.  they're gone forever, no paper, no sound, no fury, no placenta and then just a clean screen awaits you.  it's always better  to reject yourself before the editors do.  especially on a rainy  night like this with bad music on the radio.  and now -- I know what you're thinking: maybe he should have trashed this misbegotten one also.  ha, ha, ha, ha.

      A little item that may be of interest to some of you, as it certainly is to me... Dallas just got burned by the Wizards, 2 - 0. (Was the pun intended? That could be anyone's guess.)  Went to the library today, no luck with one thing, but picked up a book they had been holding for me, Bukowski And The Beats by Jean-Francois Duval. This also has an interview, entitled An Evening at Buk's Place. I've only gotten to page 25 so far but I can tell I'm really going to get a lot of mileage out of this book.  What is it that leaves you feeling giddy, even when a lot of things seem to be going wrong, and there's the sense of impending doom, like the walls or the ceiling may collapse around you at any moment. That's the feeling I've been getting, lately, don't know why really... but then there's also that sense of discovery surrounding it. Maybe it was the way the wind picked up on the way home from the library today, when I make a point to look up always, around this time of year. For certain low-hanging clouds, for a signal to head for lower ground... Extreme weather, always exciting and a little dangerous.. gets the adrenaline working overtime and creative juices flowing, I guess. Plus its also cause for unexplainable rambling on weblogs, so I'll stop now before I continue to get carried away. Till next time, my fellow bloggers. :D

      It was absolutely down to the wire yesterday. All in a panic over my daughter's graduation. Somehow she was informed the day before the ceremonies themselves, that she would have to redo a major project in order to get the one point needed to graduate. So... in a last ditch effort, and with a little help from friends and family, not to mention pulling an all-nighter, she managed to scrape up the all important point. Thank God. Commencement included over 400 students in Truman High School's Class of 2004, and the ceremony itself took two hours from start to finish. (A lot of those in our group said they were ready to go, just as soon as she finished walking across the stage, lol) It did seem to drag on forever after that.  But still, it was a wonderful event, and I'm so glad she was able to participate. I'm really so proud of her, she's done an incredible job pulling it all back together at the last minute. So, the point I'm really trying to make here is... Congratulations, "Dun Laoghaire." I knew you could do it. You were awesome up there!

      If Walls Could Talk  "We did not paint these walls this awful color." It was a diaper brown tinged with green (or maybe that was old glue) My father stood facing the wall after the initial discovery-shock of a week before, having done battle using the chosen weapons of a recycled spray bottle and putty knife. That week's worth of scraping away to the colors underneath... "Ok, it looks ready. Open the can" I lift the lid to the plaster and hand him the smallest scraper I can find, then leave him to his work. At seven years old I've done my part, scraped paper to the baseboards, refilled spray bottles, lift supplies to the ladder. And called on one again to bring the Polaroid and record how these walls will actually speak to the next owner of this house on South Hardy... "We did not paint these walls this awful color."

      Don't let this happen to you... I was so sick at work today, and in a lot of pain. Could barely finish North Tower so I knew I was in trouble at around 9:00. You know how things go through your head with something like that... gallbladder, appendicitis, kidney infection. And I still went ahead and did the counts for South tower.. I'm too stubborn for my own good. But by then it was really getting hard to walk without my side killing me again. So I ended up telling the lead, who called Martha back in to finish up. Then he walked me up to ER (made sure I got there without passing out, hehe) I was in there the rest of the day waiting for results to come back and whatnot. Turned out to be pneumonia. So... This is what happens when you overdo things, get stressed out. You get sick and you can't sleep, can't eat. All it takes is for your body to be run down enough for all kinds of nasties. Anybody out there - don't let this happen to you. It's no fun at all, I guarantee it.

      A Room of Silver   Its the reflection, beveled a million times infinity as  light catches, bounced onto and across the trail of countless others watching, or being watched.   Milling of characters through, around. Some staying overnight, some for weeks at a time, all are given a task, they  are part of the entourage...   Doing for Drella, the great white hope, robot-man, promises everyone's quarter-hour in the spotlight, or on film, but therein lies the rub, that for this amount of time, there's the unblinking eye, the why of the lens, constant, unwavering, intimidating, you find yourself within the eye of the storm.    (A spur-the-moment response to one of the Group poetic challenges they often have... Guess I had Warhol on the brain.)

      Ohhh... I think my sinus/flu remedy just wore off. Not sure if it's just me or if it really is cold in here. Hahaha. I have been dutifully informed that it must be just me. Thunderstorms and chilly rain the past few days, I don't think they've helped much. On to better news... Graduation takes place this Thursday. They're having it at the big auditorium here in town. Relatives are already here from Boston, and I've been granted a prime spot to take pictures from. This has been quite a year, though. My daughter admits to having "senioritis" during most of it..  But at least she's on the list, some people didn't even make it on the list. It should be a great night for her, although she's starting to get nervous, worried about tripping up in line and all that. I know she'll do fine.

      It's the change in the weather, I've been feeling it for the past couple of days. Spring flu, I guess, I wanted to call in to work yesterday but didn't. Just trudged through it. Would have been good sleeping weather too, it rained most of the day, but still it was nice when the sun finally came out.. Achy, my whole body, I should call in today, but that's not going to happen. (Good thing its not the stomach flu, haha.) And last night I went to bed super early, slept all the way through. But I'm still tired, feel like I could use another four hours sleep, that's not gonna happen either. At work yesterday they had the kickoff of nurses appreciation week. Big whoop. We end up cleaning up more after them than we do the patients; nurses make the most mess.  They also had a special deal in the cafeteria about the new facility they're wanting to build at the central location between here and Lee's Summit. Complete with posters of the new hospital, as designed. It just seems to me they're jumping the gun a bit. They've only just now filed a "certificate of need" and none of this has even been approved yet. Blah, blah, blah.. just want out of that place.  Last week, mandatory meeting, and it was explained how someone, i.e., the EVS general manager, could track our activity from a remote location, via bed tracking, our pagers, and computer. Well that's all fine and well, but this is from someone we haven't even met, I don't even think I've seen him at all. Someone who, to me has the potential to become a corporate slavedriver, as if it hasn't happened already. Total job disatisfaction here, just my opinion.

      Lost It  Attempt to construct  colors chosen for  contrast, the mix  between light and  dark, love and  loss, life and  death...  Try again, for  purity, regain what  was just lost here,  never mind the back  button, the  bullocks or the  Pistols.  And I've come to  curse myself again  for not saving the  work before it was  too late, haven't  we all gone through  this self-kicking  phemonenon?   Alack, alas, and woe  is me... Back to the drawing (key) board.        (What a shame... this post started out as a rant against papparazzi,  but as usual, the dreaded backspace button  reared its ugly head.   :(

      Vanish  You were the one, and the one  you will always be... How could I think now to take another into my deepest corners where you have gone, now that my heart  is taken with you to a warmer climate? How could I ever not dream, reach for you to hold close, to love, when those images  haunt me still even in daylight, when the heart that's come to beat for you breaks so complete watching you vanish.

      I saw this a couple of weeks ago on a Xanga site, I just had to post this while I had the chance..   This is just priceless.  So You want to be a Writer, by Charles Bukowski  so you want to be a writer?  if it doesn't come bursting out of you in spite of everything, don't do it. unless it comes unasked out of your heart and your mind and your mouth and your gut, don't do it. if you have to sit for hours staring at your computer screen or hunched over your typewriter searching for words, don't do it. if you're doing it for money or fame, don't do it. if you're doing it because you want women in your bed, don't do it. if you have to sit there and rewrite it again and again, don't do it. if it's hard work just thinking about doing it, don't do it. if you're trying to write like somebody else, forget about it.   if you have to wait for it to roar out of you, then wait patiently. if it never does roar out of you, do something else.  if you first have to read it to your wife or your girlfriend or your boyfriend or your parents or to anybody at all, you're not ready.  don't be like so many writers, don't be like so many thousands of people who call themselves writers, don't be dull and boring and pretentious, don't be consumed with self- love. the libraries of the world have yawned themselves to sleep over your kind. don't add to that. don't do it. unless it comes out of your soul like a rocket, unless being still would drive you to madness or suicide or murder, don't do it. unless the sun inside you is burning your gut, don't do it.  when it is truly time, and if you have been chosen, it will do it by itself and it will keep on doing it until you die or it dies in you.  there is no other way.  and there never was.

      The word for today is... "chocolatemilk" It would seem to be some kind of inside joke, like teasing someone at work, maybe. Why, something like that could quickly turn into a long-running series of quips and one-liners, sure to cause high fives after each and every one. (hee-hee)    There's an old vacant place not far from work, one of the first ever convenience stores in the area, one of the first to stay open late, years, years ago. When nothing else was open, "I'm going down to the 'Milk Jug' for some smokes... toilet paper... a soda..." whatever. It shut down years ago, and has stood vacant ever since, still has the sign out front.  Good one, if I say so myself, earned me high fives all the way around the table. "Hey did you see the news last night? They're trying to revamp the area, open new stuff around here finally. They're gonna reopen the Milk Jug, but this time they're calling it the 'Chocolate Milk Jug."  Aww, Billy, you know we're just kidding.

      I'm up early again this morning, browsing the sites and listening to the radio. It's gonna be a long day, and I'm gonna hate it.  These late days just kill me. But for now I'm waiting for some of my favorites to spin on the Buzz.  ... How much coffee will it take to get through the day?  I took an AQ quiz last night, scored a 9. I guess that's a good thing. Lol. I also found out my elven name (from a Hobitt site) is Anarane Nolatari.  Boredom has its rewards, I suppose.  For the past few days, I've been in a major rut. Very low. I just feel kind of lost right now, can't relate the way I need to. Can't connect... and what's the reason for that? Static? Interference? Weak signal? Who knows. Distance maybe. Am I losing what little connection I had? I feel like I'm losing my best friend.  Just get this day over with.

      Bridge  This tree has the perfect shade of royalty in its living  and breathing. I'd wish for it to last, snap a picture to capture part of the real life  third dimension, ten-fold.  Would anyone passing now,  this early on Sunday morning know exactly, how it takes one hundred and seventy-five steps from the foot  of the bridge to reach this point?  (Take the picture)  And what if you did actually lay down among the green  and silver tonight, pretend for a moment and recall easier times? What if? Could you rest deeper then, enough to face the next day with a heart less heavy?  (Just take the picture)

      Ok, it went something like this...  "You have incredible images going on but in stanza 2, and lines 2, 3, and 4, you could have replaced 'what you wrote' with 'some word or phrase of my choice' and in stanza 4, lines 1 and 2, you already stated 'this' when I would have put, 'blah, blah, blah'...  I kept thinking, what is she gonna tell him next? Maybe something like "Here's what you should do. Print out your poem, send it to me via U.S. post, but before you put it in the envelope, hold it out in front of you and tear it in half, then tear again until you have 50 pieces of paper. And I'll rewrite the whole thing myself."   Makes about as much sense as the mud offered before, ha. And all this after seeing three separate acts of cruelty from the same person.   So.. there goes my morning vent.. we'll see what happens later.

       A good friend from work forwarded this to me yesterday. I'd really be interested to see what comments this generates, so if you have any feelings about this, please leave your comments at the bottom, (I promise I won't slam anyone for their opinions)...        This is not very long, but very informative. You have to read the catalogue of events in this brief piece. Then, ask yourself how anyone can`take the position that all we have to do is bring our troops home from Iraq, sit back, reset the snooze alarm, go back to sleep, and no one will ever bother us again.    In case you missed it, World War III began in November 1979... that alarm has been ringing for years.    US Navy Captain Ouimette is the Executive Officer at Naval Air Station, Pensacola, Florida. Here is a copy of the speech he gave last month. It is an accurate account of why we are in so much trouble today and why this action is so necessary.                                            AMERICA NEEDS TO WAKE UP!   That's what we think we heard on the 11th of September 2001 (When more than 3,000 Americans were killed -AD) and maybe it was, but I think it should have been "Get Out of Bed!" In fact, I think the alarm clock has been buzzing since 1979 and we have continued to hit the snooze button and roll over for a few more minutes of peaceful sleep since then.   It was a cool fall day in November 1979 in a country going through a religious and political upheaval when a group of Iranian students attacked and seized the American Embassy in Tehran. This seizure was an outright attack on American soil; it was an attack that held the world's most powerful country hostage and paralyzed a Presidency. The attack on this sovereign U.S. embassy set the stage for events to follow for the next 25 years.   America was still reeling from the aftermath of the Vietnam experience and had a serious threat from the Soviet Union when then, President Carter, had to do something. He chose to conduct a clandestine raid in the desert. The ill-fated mission ended in ruin, but stood as a symbol of America's inability to deal with terrorism.   America's military had been decimated and down sized/right sized since the end of the Vietnam War. A poorly trained, poorly equipped and poorly organized military was called on to execute a complex mission that was doomed from the start.    Shortly after the Tehran experience, Americans began to be kidnapped and killed throughout the Middle East. America could do little to protect her citizens living and working abroad. The attacks against US soil continued.    In April of 1983 a large vehicle packed with high explosives was driven into the US Embassy compound in Beirut. When it explodes, it kills 63 people. The alarm went off again and America hit the Snooze Button once more..   Then just six short months later a large truck heavily laden down with over 2500 pounds of TNT smashes through the main gate of the US Marine Corps headquarters in Beirut and 241 US servicemen are killed.  America mourns her dead and hits the Snooze Button once more.    Two months later in December 1983, another truck loaded with explosives is driven into the US Embassy in Kuwait, and America continues her slumber.    The following year, in September 1984, another van was driven into the gate of the US Embassy in Beirut and America slept.  Soon the terrorism spreads to Europe.    In April 1985 a bomb explodes in a restaurant frequented by US soldiers in Madrid.  Then in August a Volkswagen loaded with explosives is driven into the main gate of the US Air Force Base at Rhein-Main, 22 are killed and the snooze alarm is buzzing louder and louder as US interests are continually attacked.   Fifty-nine days later a cruise ship, the Achille Lauro is hijacked and we watched as an American in a wheelchair is singled out of the passenger list and executed.    The terrorists then shift their tactics to bombing civilian airliners when they bomb TWA Flight 840 in April of 1986 that killed 4 and the most tragic bombing, Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, killing 259.     Clinton treated these terrorist acts as crimes; in fact we are still trying to bring these people to trial. These are acts of war. The wake up alarm is getting louder and louder.     The terrorists decide to bring the fight to America. In January 1993, two CIA agents are shot and killed as they enter CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.      The following month, February 1993, a group of terrorists are arrested after a rented van packed with explosives is driven into the underground parking garage of the World Trade Center in New York City. Six people are killed and over 1000 are injured. Still this is a crime and not an act ofwar?  The Snooze alarm is depressed again.   Then in November 1995 a car bomb explodes at a US military complex in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia killing seven service men and women. A few months later in June of 1996, another truck bomb explodes only 35 yards from the US military compound in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. It destroys the Khobar Towers, a US Air Force barracks, killing 19 and injuring over 500.  The terrorists are getting braver and smarter as they see that America does not respond decisively.    They move to coordinate their attacks in a simultaneous attack on two US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. These attacks were planned with precision. They kill 224. America responds with cruise missile attacks and goes back to sleep.    The USS Cole was docked in the port of Aden, Yemen for refueling on 12 October 2000, when a small craft pulled along side the ship and exploded killing 17 US Navy Sailors. Attacking a US War Ship is an act of war, but we sent the FBI to investigate the crime and went back to sleep.   And of course you know the events of 11 September 2001. Most Americans think this was the first attack against US soil or in America. How wrong they are. America has been under a constant attack since 1979 and we chose to hit the snooze alarm and roll over and go back to sleep.    In the news lately we have seen lots of finger pointing from every high official in government over what they knew and what they didn't know. But if you've read the papers and paid a little attention I think you can see exactly what they knew. You don't have to be in the FBI or CIA or on the National Security Council to see the pattern that has been developing since 1979.     The President is right on when he says we are engaged in a war. I think we have been in a war for the past 25 years and it will continue until we as a people decide enough is enough. America needs to "Get out of Bed" and act decisively now. America has been changed forever. We have to be ready to pay the price and make the sacrifice to ensure our way of life continues.. We cannot afford to keep hitting the snooze button again and again and roll over and go back to sleep.   After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Admiral Yamamoto said "... it seems all we have done is awakened a sleeping giant." This is the message we need to disseminate to terrorists around the world.   Support Our Troops and support President Bush for having the courage, political or militarily, to address what so many who preceded him didn't have the backbone to do--both Democrat and Republican. This is not a political thing to be hashed over in an election year; this is an AMERICAN thing. This is about our Freedom and the Freedom of our children in years to come.

      It was the best birthday cake this year, and it wasn't even my birthday. There's a lady at work who'll bake a cake and bring it to work anytime one of us has a birthday... She had such a hard time with mine over the past few months.  Understand that she lives downtown and walks to the bus stop every morning, then she walks another couple of blocks once she gets to Independence. One time she was distracted and left it on the bus, another time she was chased by a pit bull and wouldn't you know it, the cake happened to end up in someone's open trash bin, and she sure wasn't going in after it, especially not with that dog still hot on her heels. I'd keep telling her, it was alright, she didn't have to bring one, after all that.. But she insisted. So today she brought the best coconut cake. Made from scratch.. Wow. Cool... Double wow.. and I would imagine Dun Laoghaire knows the rest of that story.

      The Contentedness Of Dreams  Not the trivial grind of today. No tv, no work, no hot shot company reps, no politics...  Instead tonight I will wonder and think-tank on faith in words and dreams, wishing so desparately to offer the one I love the relief he deserves; solace to him when lost  in self doubt, I wish him restful  sleep with none of the troubled  circumstance.   Take away this anxious time, replace it with alternating currents of relaxation and excitement,  the contentedness of dreams, lightning bugs caught across summer lawns and  saved in jars, blankets over picnic  grass, to clink plastic tumblers of  Vanilla Coke to chase thirst away  with a satisfying bite, walks in the  rain, for the rain's sake alone...  Just dreams, and such wonderful dreams at that.

      Spent Sighs And Whispers  There are times each day you are terribly missed in private, quasi-private,  with too many chances to be alone with my wishes.  As in this moment when the night promises endless hollow, hungry hours, when again I'm alone with my thoughts and myself, to quiet the deep sobs that catch  so complete, spent sighs and whispers sent to some outward intangible, always something  I can never touch.

      A Thistle For Nothing  They don't call it a thistle for nothing, purple spikes that are not grown hydroponically, with care and tending, but wild along the roadside with the freedom to spring up just wherever they want.  Who in the world would not pray for an option like that?  Most of them tiny, in scattered bunches, but along the journey there's always the few odd ones, proud, tall and thriving in the  soil and sun, having soaked up  what delicious rain fallen  the night before  so that in the morning they have slept well enough  to survive another day  of fumes and exhaust.

      Well the trip to the library yielded some Bukowski books I had on order that got sent back... I looked around for another book in particular, The Fiery Cross by Diana Gabaldon, they didn't have that. So I looked around some more and found this:     So this is what I'm reading right now. I would have gotten a good start on it earlier today while waiting on the bus home, but someone came by with a grocery store ad from the mail and couldn't help expressing loud absolute amazement at all the bargains, lol. It's a huge book, gonna take a while, looks awesome though.

      It's my day off today... I don't have much going on. I'm stuck in this awful rut, and not really know the best way to go forward. I'm stagnating here in this town and I keep thinking all I really need to to is something drastic to perpetuate a change.. good, bad, but not indifferent. Inertia brings its own brand of hell. I have to do something.... anything.  Pondering on the pro's and con's takes too much time, especially when it seems like that's all you've done for months. You eventually get to where you say, "enough." Its past time I stopped dragging my feet and do something to see some positive results. Some progress I can see in relation to what plodding away on this daily basis brings. I'm emo, I'm frustrated, depressed because I see no end to this right now.  "Whah!" I'll get over it in time... Just a little bit of where my head's at today, that's all.

      Soul  Everything here comes with a thousand words. His face could mystify sages of ancient times, become a  wistful sonnet so full of meaning, tenderness.  Eyes much more than windows, God only knows how it's a day's work to look into, or ever find them. Keeping mindful of visions that ever holds those stars adrift, clear.  Watch how they glitter,  coat the mountain breeze, the air so thin and pure here. Just these short hours under  the night and the breathing  is easy, sighs so fulfilling. Look at him sleeping, so content, he has a beautiful soul.

      Today The Metaphor Is Free  And I could spend hours each day scanning these pages for the one  poem so delicious I could devour it whole.  Where these words have a mind of their own to wrap tight into, enough to feel the pulse,  surrounding heat beyond the heat of summer.  A page where just the breath of speaking can toss clouds shifted  by a humid breeze, change images  like erosion of sea to sand  where I bury continual hurts, watch as they are washed away  to make room for something brighter.

      At last communication, Laura and her dad were on their way back from Fargo, and she has finally resumed the trip back home. They should be back in town sometime tonight.. Well, what a trip that turned out to be. Somebody should write a letter to the MTV show, Pimp My Ride and have them fix up the entire car for her, for as much she's been through with that fool thing.  I went out with some friends from work last night. Started out at this Mexican restaurant just up the street. Palomino's (Decent food, and pretty reasonable) From there, went to another place with a DJ, celebrated a co-worker's birthday. I kept having to tell her 40 ain't so bad.. I don't think she was all that convinced, though. Anyway, I had a good time there, I haven't been out like that in quite a while.. but as much fun as I had, I don't think I'm gonna be doing it again anytime soon. I'll be starting my 2nd job next week so I'm going to be more appreciative of my days off and spending that time to myself, doing the important things like laundry, writing, errands, cleaning house, writing, grocery shopping, writing, and writing.  I slept in today, then went to get some supplies at Wal Mart, and was wanting to get to Barnes and Noble.. but I got such a late start, plus having to wait on the bus.. I didn't think I'd make it back in time for the last transfer. Bus went right past the bookstore too :(   So, later for browsing the poetry section, maybe next Friday if I have the chance.

      Boredom Falls In Canada  They rolled up the sidewalk  precisely at 7 p.m. last night and in the blink of an eye what little there was is now already shut down.  So much for the middle of this Odessa-like nothing, the space so  much forgotten, lost in Gladstone.  Tennis shoe heels like two pogo sticks, mad as a March hare in June  when the crow flies, and now you're skipping down the street like the  gay guy in Jackass the Movie,  regardless of the strange looks  from those two kids on bikes.  Still not taking pictures of the  maple leaf, the empty gas station,  the darkened restaurant and grocery store, walking, walking who knows where? Its all for the sake of exploration,  and well you know, years from now this  will all be the source of laughter,  good times, still good times.      (Something for my daughter, who's stuck in Canada at the moment.)

      Would you like some good news first or maybe the not so good news? Ok, and now for something completely different. I was hired for the perfect 2nd job I was hoping for. I start the 14th of this month. Perfect because its as close as my other job as I can get, right across the street.. and it'll still be daylight when I get off, which is good. I'll still get to see the light of day on my own time :D My daughter's been in Canada last week, visiting a friend. I call this the trip from Hell. I swear she's had soo much trouble (car trouble) since the very beginning. I won't give all the details, but for the duration, it's been one thing after another. Well, now she's on her way home, and this thing happened yet again. So last I heard she was still waiting on assistance (after she called them a second time and found out they were headed in the wrong direction) How's that for an outfit who's expertise is roadside assistance? Lol. I will keep updates on this, till she gets home.. as I've been doing on my Xanga site, since most of her friends read that one... I was keeping them posted on the trip when she didn't have access to a computer. I suppose this is all for now... Unless I have some thunderbolt of inspiration in the middle of the night, and I'll have to get up to furiously post online... provided my son isn't hogging the keyboard then.. Cherios!

      Well, it was a good day at work... No big shots or supervisors to get in the way of doing a job; in fact, one of them is on vacation for the next two weeks and we can all work without being spied on. And for once, they didn't short us on the linen this time (however, I'm still going to have to call tomorrow for some empty carts for us to use) They guy even came and took the dirty linen on time for us... which brings me to the close call I had this morning. Just outside the door to the dock, there is a long ramp to the right. I was sitting on the bench, and there were two other co-workers further down, at the end of the ramp. I just happened to look up and there was this cart full of dirty linen headed straight for me. Somehow it swerved and hit the wall next to the bench, but as soon as I jumped up, here comes another one. Luckily this one wasn't going all that fast so it could be stopped with no problem (or injury). Well anyhow, I counted that as enough excitement for the day, lol. At least it broke the monotony of an otherwise boring day. When things start going too smooth, it would seem the "gods of the "workday" like to keep us on our toes.

      Flip Side OF The Void  Ask how there can be such vague comparisons in the  search for something valid and meaningful within.  Have you read forever, whatever there may be  to seek, called upon words  to find more questions  in the answers?  What is your outcome now? If my wishes owned a vision,  dreams a voice, I would see and hear a comforting tone  that sounds strangely like his.

      I spoke to my old boss again yesterday. She called me and asked if I still wanted the part-time evening position at the Groves. So I guess tomorrow around 9 a.m. I'll put in the application, be interviewed and hired on the spot. Doris set it up like that, since she'll be on vacation. And after that... orientation on the 14th. So I guess I'll be actually start on the 15th. I'm still not sure if I'm doing the right thing.. yeah, I need the money, and yeah I couldn't do much else right now without it. But am I effectively condemning myself to this place by taking this job? I've told myself a lot lately that if I don't do something about this rut soon, I never will. Is this a good step in the right direction, or just more inertia. I can't seem to figure exactly what this is going to do.. will I be asking myself everyday, "what fresh hell is this?" or will I be able to easily see that this is just what it takes to get what I truly want? And if so, how long does this have to take? I'm usually patient, but this is just the tip of the iceberg with the self-nagging questions.

      Saw the news last night... then I came in to work this morning and saw this:  Message From The CEO  July 20, 2004  MEMO TO: HCA Midwest Staff  FROM: Dan Jones, CEO  SUBJECT: Certificate of Need  &nbsp;  I'm extremely pleased to inform you the State of Missour yesterday approved our Certificate of Need to establish a new 257-bed hospital in Independence that will replace and consolidate licensed beds at IRHC (Independence Regional Health Center) and MCI (Medical Center of Independence).  The new facility - to be built at the northwest corner of 39th Street and Selsa Road in Independence - will open in 2007, with groundbreaking expected later this year. Throughout the construction and transition process, we will ensure area residents have access to high-quality health care. IRHC and MCI will remain open until the new hospital is completed. Although we have an exciting transition ahead of us, we will remain focused on providing the best possible health care at our two existing facilities until the new hospital is complete.  This is a great time for IRHC and MCI staff. I want to personally thank each and every employee for your tremendous support throughout this process. We are absolutely committed to providing first-class health care for this community, and a replacement hospital will allow us to achieve that goal.  As this project moves forward, I will keep you informed of&nbsp; new developments every step of the way. You are the backbone of this organization, and you will be instrumental in making this transition a smooth one.  Thanks again for your continued support.  Dan Jones.  &nbsp;  So its official.. they are definitely going to close the hospital.&nbsp; Only thing, though, I'm not waiting around for it to happen. It's time to move on. It's been time for that for too long already.

      Well I guess that's not the only thing I've been sick of lately. My job, this city, this life...&nbsp; If I don't chicken out, there will be my two-week notice announced by the end of this week. I've really had it.. I'm just so burned out with that place, the new company that took over last year. It doesn't even matter that they all went to Jefferson City today to debate the closing of two of the area hospitals.. that doesn't matter to me any more. All I know is I want out of the whole mess.&nbsp; This city.. I don't know what compelled me to come back here in the first place. Well, on second thought, I'm certain of why.. but what I can't understand is why I felt like I had to stay here so long afterwards.. I'm tired of hoping for something that I'll never end up with. What a ball of chaos this blog is today.. Tired of being lonely, always hoping for something that will never happen.... This really sucks.

      Ok, I'm already sick of hearing about Martha Stewart. I didn't care one whit about her before, why should I now? Is anybody with me on this? Oh, what a centered individual with inner strength. Not. More like an actor on cue, if you know what I mean.. Who really cares? I don't know personally of anyone who does. So enough with the Martha bit, OK?  I am currently out of the webtv loop at the moment, which means I have no access to the internet at home. Until I can get this straightened out, I'm stuck with posting and returning emails from the library, so bear with me... I'll be back. (hehe, seems I've recently heard that somewhere before, just can't quite place it, lol)

      Godiva   Allow me this  box of cornstarch  to cover your naked body with...   Such a deep massage, it will feel like silk,  sprinkled first on your back after those  hard hours at work,lounging, stretched out,  relaxing on your bed.   It will be fluid motion, my hands like waves  lapping the beach on the way to your hidden  endings and loving every minute of it.   My fingertips will travel slow,  oh yes, they will travel, playfully  winding down past, toward the back  of your legs, lingering long enough  everywhere to draw random swirls  of patterns in the dusting.   Soft like the weightlessness of silk  remaining, covered, you, your skin,my touch.  &nbsp;  Turn now, allow me to become  your Lady Godiva, riding your  horse steadily to the ocean;  my passions continue, warm and loving.   Moan for me, my love.  I swear I would give you my all.

      What They Want&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Dusk winding open along the road turned devious through the onslaught of&nbsp;fragmentation, thoughts too splintered  these days any longer to find the right words,  the way to continue making sense of&nbsp; this. Or who to pray to now who could turn back the clock. &nbsp; In the sky, at my back  the clouds were shifting, forming shapes that dissolved  into puddles the next day. &nbsp; And the hills of&nbsp; these streets, a killer to the muscles in your legs. The concrete of this building, doomed and razed, demanding refusal  to go down with the ship.

         This is the new Cure cd I bought yesterday. It still has the plastic shrink-wrap on the case, just begging to be opened. I love the Cure, but at the same time, a dear friend is also very much into them, and with a birthday coming up in the next week I thought it would be the perfect gift. :D  And speaking of birthdays, there were two events I was invited to on the same night... I opted for the first one that came up. A friend in NE KC. It was a nice place, an older house. I love the set-up of the place, with it's huge windows, just awesome. Also a creative idea for the party was to place disposable cameras at various locations through the house, with a sheet of paper for each one, to list who took the picture, etc. Haha, great concept and good theory, but the cameras seemed to be creeping all over the place, getting mixed up and all.. two in one location, three in another..  But the pictures should be very interesting.. hmmm... except for the "Unlucky Seven" who drank too much.. some of us were kept very busy with towels and carpet cleaner.. But all that aside, I had a great time and am really glad I went. So thanks Epsilon, and Happy Birthday!

      A good friend has done some occasional writing in the past and has allowed me to post them online. I think they're definitely worth reading, what do you think?   Through trials and heartaches I must endure. I know that His love will make me sure of a love so true, it can be mine for the present and for all time. -Lisa Baker  How many times have you been in despair and felt so much pain? How many times did it seem no one cared as if the world was to blame? I've tried and tried so many times  to put my trust in you, but its so hard to realize you see, who wants a prisoner like me. - Lisa Baker

      I want to write about how when the balance shifts, it tilts everything to the extreme, like some pinball game gone rabid,  how when I sit and daydream, my pen sprouts Warholian wings and flies away to the moon on cow wallpaper and side-by-side images of Coca-Cola bottles. I want to write about how the park I used to steal away to when I was a kid, crossing trails and railroad tracks (always "to the tracks!) to steal the flattest stones from its creek bed and skip two, three, four times in a row, the dance made mad ripples in the rush, now stagnant, standing unmovable until the next tornado season, bringing along its heavy rains just perfect for flooding the adjoining tennis courts the city just replaced in time for spring. I want to write about all this but tonight the total wreck of imagination is nonexistant.

      Broken  I want your face to be the last thing I see tonight, the last thing I ever see in this life.  Every day I read and write and lose some part of myself, wondering who is the one lucky enough to hold your  heart.   Every day the city, place of  my secret wish, bench of my tearful break.   The remembrance of such split loss of ideals, the system of beliefs, faith in a man, who you are is everything. I'm the one who needs you.  This daily dose is harsh  reality, what is never  to be, never more, no love,  slow dances, no touch, warm and loving, there is no laughter tonight or any night.

      We Were Busy  They had it way back then, even said as much, that war is hell and unhealthy  for children and other  living things.  They said it, and we turned  our backs, indifferent, in  favor of buying Prada and tabloids because enquiring minds wanted to know the latest shenanigans of Jagger and Jeri, the rise and fall of disco, took artists to court trivialized words and meaning.   We were busy and technology grew in leaps and bounds, while battles turned stealth- ridden and nothing is remembered of the fairness in a street fight.  There will be no shootout at the  OK Corral, no 30 paces, no challenge issued by the sheriff at high noon,  for the break of dawn. So put your guns away.

      Missing  Missing again, that one thought I had tucked away, I thought safe,  the ideal that was the perfect one to build on.   Should have seen it coming. That split-second distraction; the car speeding by too close  to the curb, the sparrow dive bombing the neighbor's cat  from his arial tree top perch,   Should I design a "lost" poster of some sort, notify the authorities, Independence's finest boys in blue,  thumb a ride to the nearest Krispy Kreme to file my report.  The sketch will grace the carton  on your breakfast table... "Have you seen this thought?" Was last seen in the vicinity of "WALK" and "DON'T WALK"  Retrace the steps now, or in my sleep you will be found again, in that brief moment before REM drifts soundless,  wordless, inside a dream, where in  my dream I'm reaching for the pen and paper.

      I was talked into seeing Napoleon Dynamite instead of The Village.  ...And I was so looking forward to a good scary movie, Gosh!  This is a very quirky movie.. a lot of retro 70's/80's references in it. So many of the scenes were really so stupid they became funny for the pure fact that the deadpan delivery just kind of grows on you... like mold. Haha, I really don't see how the guy could say all this lame dialoge with such a straight (more like blank) face without bursting into insane laughter at the geekiness of it all. Like I said, a very quirky movie.  Def Poetry on cable last night was really a good one, I've been recording a lot of them just to go back and watch again. I'm trying to get some discussion started on this topic in my poetry group, Bailey's Java Cafe on Yahoo.   Oh, look at the time... I've got to get ready for work again.  Oh joy...

      Where to start?? I dread these next couple of weeks. At work. Word has it that the JAHCO inspectors have a major beef with HCA stemming from that Medicare fiasco some years back, so they'll be nitpicking the staff like crazy... We've already been told: "Now is NOT the time to air your grievances." Great... No pressure there, hehe. I am not looking forward to this in the least. My ex bf is staying with friends in San Francisco, got kicked out from his best friend's place... I think it was over not having a job. Now he's wanting to come back to town to stay at his dad's. His dad lives a few blocks away from me.  I can't get motivated... in anything much outside of work. I'm having a hard enough time staying motivated for work.  Hey, at least I'm still writing, I always have that. Thank God. Don't know what I would do if I couldn't just write stuff down whenever I feel like it. I can remember when I couldn't even do that, it wasn't really all that long ago it seems. Went out last night... very, very informal time of it, haha... unavoidably late, but I can understand, he's got a close friend who's elderly and physically handicapped now, that he takes care of quite a bit, and those things take a lot of time. I don't think his friend can even get around without his wheelchair, and an oxygen tank.. that's really some major lugging stuff around, and it takes extra time just to get him in and out of the van whenever he needs to go somewhere, poor guy.. He's trying to get him into a program where a home health worker can come in and take up a lot of the responsibility, cause he's wearing himself out just taking him to the doctors, etc. My son Jason came home yesterday after job hunting, all upset cause everybody he talked to acted like they didn't have time for him, or had already hired somebody else. That's what you get for wearing a lip ring to fill out applications. Damn... It used to be kind of funny. It's not funny anymore. Me and Laura both sat right here and told him it was a bad idea, just last weekend. Now he says, we never told him that. But even if we didn't you'd think it would occur to him to take it out whenever he goes job hunting, sheesh. Well I guess this is my rant for the day. It's gotta get better from here.

      Willie Gee Is Tappin' The Keg  Willie Gee says, "My mind is pickled."  Willie Gee says, "If they were to open up the top of my skull like this pull tab, there would be more than enough alcohol inside my brain to flood Japan."  Never mind the Saki, he's an MGD man. Be there at the party, God willing and the creek at Hill Park don't rise like some bad-ass monster from a B-grade movie.  Imagine if you will, Godzilla slain off the coast of Anheiser Bush, why the  tidal push alone would spawn a brand new generational wave of mis-queued sound bytes.  (Honestly, there is a Willie Gee, but the name has been changed to protect the infamous... And that's the beauty of poetry sometimes, that you can take so many different elements and people you see, and hear of. It can mean so many different things to different people...)

      Rejection noticed me, I told you I would withstand, I am still here after all this time ...  Confuse me, rip my insides nightly, have your way, your way.. make me love you, me who  is not enough for you.  Give me hope from the start, you, also one needing hope. Take it away from no one,  the telling; tell me, tell me to keep what's in my heart, this is what's been done,  there has been  no other way.  Destroy me, trip me, find  me stumbling in the dark without a clue, having found nothing of reason, blind and  bleeding a torn soul. You have been too deep within me to give anything now  without this absolute pain.

      The Blackbirds are Rough Today by Charles Bukowski  Lonely as a dry and used orchard spread over the earth for use and surrender.  shot down like an ex-pug selling dailies on the corner.  taken by tears like an aging chorus girl who has gotten her last check.  a hanky is in order your lord your  worship.  the blackbirds are rough today like  ingrown toenails in an overnight jail--- wine wine whine, the blackbirds run around and fly around harping about Spanish melodies and bones.  and everywhere is  nowhere--- the dream is as bad as  flapjacks and flat tires: why do we go on  with our minds and  pockets full of  dust like a bad boy just out of  school--- you tell me, you who were a hero in some revolution you who teach children you who drink with calmness you who own large homes  and walk in gardens you who have killed a man and own a  beautiful wife you tell me why I am on fire like old dry garbage  we might surely have some interesting  correspondence. it will keep the mailman busy. and the little butterflies and ants and bridges and cemetaries the rocket-makers and dogs and garage mechanics will still go on a while until we run out of stamps and/or ideas.  don't be ashamed of anything: I guess God meant it all like locks on doors.

      Now and Then  There is now the sense of  not being right with anything.  Back in the old-school day I was not fragile, was only serious minded.  All these years and when I found it, it was seen  as half full, yet the glass was not mine to taste from.  Now so convoluted with those tiny hairline fractures that  could shatter at any moment the thing that would be torn apart, how life threatens to break a heart over and over again.  How today everything I saw or heard or felt was such a  reminder of loss that I ask myself, How much is too much? I couldn't begin to reason  a guess from the fragmented thoughts and tones of   perpendicular ideals that  only come from feeling too much, going too deep for  there ever to be much hope  of finding the way back. How true? Too fragile for  love, after all.
