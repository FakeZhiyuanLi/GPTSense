       yo! hi everyone!!! been really messed up lately, all the exams and all that. while it would be a waste of time bragging or condeming myself about how much or little i studied, i have to say that this exams... i go in with least preparation. but just about the same confidence i guess. i mean not confident about getting the marks but just not panicking all over. like a test tube spilling all over with hot chemicals like some girls will be i guess. nah, not any discrimination against girls, just a fitting description. yah, very unprepared... like facing a dragon without armour... what kind of senario is that?  sorry, i told you, a little messed up...  hmm, why everyone? well, i guess its just a greeting. Not expecting a lot of people. In fact, i had chosen to just keep this little blog a low profile. i mean, not that i don't want anyone to see it. its just if less people know about it, i can be freer to write things without being judged.   Had.   so now, it doesn't really matter, i mean im still gona write freely. it's alrite if people read. i will be proud if they read. guess i will be :)  both my roomates got .. haha how shall i say it without being too commercial... someone to care for. yah. and. I'm really happy for them. really. more happy than u think i am. im really glad. those kind of serene, old-age, soothing glad. really. yeah. oh well, which very reminds me of my so-called policy. now, i really dunnoe what i feel here. its just... void?   which reminds me... 5th July, her birthday, i wanted to make a card for her but now... as in NOW... i am just too unspirited... ok fine, plain lazy. i dunoe. dun feel like investing all my efforts just to make her happy. not that im asking, "what for?"  not that im asking, "so???"  but i don't know... i don't feel like doing it anymore.  someone to care for... do i not want that?   life... and life's little own pesky, irritaing, shitty, seemingly-over-important problems.

       Just came back from an overnite stay at my bp friend's house. Slept at 5 plus... really spent. Took the 1 hour mrt ride all the way back to the east. Fatigue, man... solemn fatigue. I didn't even smile a bit for once throughout the way back.  Shagged.  Damn, why do 1 worded paragraghs always look so cool. it's darn poser la... no, i mean poseur... i should realie minimize the use of 1 worded paragraphs.   Whatever.  Anway, im returning to where i live in. In a few hours time. haiz, it means many things. no decent internet connection. no blogging. so there will be no posts for the next few weeks? And much more. No more slacking, which is REALLY necessary. No more contact with the rest of the world. woah, it looks like im returning to Mars, huh? Yah, got the front few letters right.  I have been thinking about a lot of stuff recently... in fact all this while. Stuff to write in my blog. Stuff, basically. But i guess now its not the time. im about to leave and im nowhere near "starting to pack". yeah, and i better HURRY UP. till the next time, i guess...   by the way sis, if you read this, thanks for reading and thanks to whoever who reads... haha. drop your comments at will of course.

       What happens when  emotions  and  logic  clash? Logically,  logic  wins. More often than not,  emotions  rule.    Logic   always  wins.  Of late, i have been a dead man walking, rather, an empty coffin rumbling about. As if whatever is inside's been robbed. Harshly extorted away. By grave robbers of the unseen. As if, the soul has seeped throught the cracks and slits in the coffin. As if...   I think i have found my corpse. I think, I hope...  Perhaps it was my roomate. Suffering from some sort of depression. No motivation in life. Anymore. It's like a condition. It suddenly happens, not gradually slipping into it. Like suicide. They say suicide is like a condition. But, he's recovering, getting on back with life. When he was down, he was like a depression himself, sucking me within. like emptiness gushing profusely into me. creating depression from my once full soul.  Perhaps it was my fatigue. over-worked myself... yeah, right. maybe the dullness of life does grind into you sometimes. taking out whatever moves you on. making you slog to a halt. and when it happens, it numbs it almost hurts. and i hate it.  walking in life, with every step dragging into the ground... i lost my point in moving forward. as if always asking, whats the point in going on? why? when? and to slump into loneliness and illusion. completely lost the jazz and bubble in life. i don't know what exactly happened. but it was really draining me. if i had to go through it again...  i was hoping for a miracle, a sudden light. an immediate change. but i realized that, it took me over some time to regather my bits and stitch them back again. i was hoping it would be something exciting to bring me up. and it was.   Competition brings out the  best  and  worst  in a person.  It brings out nearly everything. nearly. it brings out all the spirit, the fight, the strength. how one can struggle against all odds through the end. how one can show all his cards and trumph over with all his might. and what if it brings out the red side of you. all the anger and fear. the iresistable urge to bash the way to the destination. to win. at all costs. and when the dark side comes out, it's the worst.   do i want the best  and  worst? do i? do you? or can we do without it?   i have let people down, i know. and i won't WISP (wallow in self ptiy) here now. while i will now be  lesser ....how much does it matter actually?  i am what i am.  so what? what can i do otherwise. i give my shot, it returns and slap me in the face. that's bout all i can do. all in all, i cant be too bothered to give too much of a damn afterall. i do what i can. nevertheless, i'm still a little bitter about it.  bitter...   i'll be fine. i know i will.  i don't know how to say, but well... sis disowned me temporarily today. is this where i insert "haha"?  was kinda seriously ... . coz ... but i am realli sorry. really really am. i failed to do my part. i failed my duty. i can't describe it. that's one of the worst things to do. to not fulfil a duty. but...  "duty is the greatest of joy, the deepest of sorrows" -neverwinter nights  seems like lots of gibberish penned down here. it bores even me. think i will write with less fog next time.

        went back to my previous school today. nice. when you are with people whom you are nearly completely comfortable with, it's wonderful. beautiful.    had a quater school day. let off freaking early. went with class to watch movie. except i didn't watch. I, Robot. didn't really want to watch.... didn't attract me. neither did brotherhood. no appealing movies. no interest. didn't really feel sad. i'm quite alright about it. been more anti-social recently. not to a significant extent but i can feel it.    bought spawn: simony. yeah, great artwork but story disappoints me. i would not have made the trip back for some stupid prize. if not for meeting my friends there, i would not have wasted my time friggin about all over the place.    really love it when i'm back with those good old friends. it's like i can fall into place perfectly with them. i can always talk or stay quiet, it feels just as good. i can always trust them that some things within our selves will never change. it's more than jigsaw pieces fitting perfectly. it's different jigsaw makers crafting many different pieces, and all of them coming to fall in place naturally. that, is the  completeness . i would give anything for them. yeah,it's different from my present. but it'll be alright. it'll be fine.    been having problems on some of my bridges. anti-social? haha. troubled? perhaps unnecessarily so. i'll prefer not to think of it. -sigh-

         walked with this nice girl around the area this evening. it feels...    anyway, don't ask me about the title. i'm not sure why and how. but it is. yeah, i have not been writing for a while. couple of reasons.. or well, excuses. i write for myself in any case, and not for others to read.    bullshit.    yeah, i do write to let others read. yeah, i know it's an age-old topic. darn. yeah, i'm just sharing my thoughts. revealing my experiences. rearranging prejudices...    was sick last monday anyway. felt really good. you need to get away from it all for a brief moment, though it's just as brief as a twinkle of a star. spent 3 really beautiful hours sitting, reading and eating at delifrance. whenever i'm at delifrance, it always feels to me as if time had stopped. as if i had all the time in the world, just relishing every single moment there, savouring the aroma of carefreeness. as if i'm in love. as if.    i was caught with my laziness and medieval: total war. been sleeping, playing and all that. really wanted to write, but haha does it matter anyway? medieval total war's not bad. to me the idea is quite fresh in certain aspects. but graphic's really not good. have not been crafting lately, in fact for a long time. can't wait to play a good game. not only that, of late i have been REALLY desperate to get a nice old amateurish game of magic the gathering. i guess i will always be in love with this game. just love it.     shedding the hazy memory of my past week, i cant seem to forget the incident when my gp teacher shelled me. yeah, i know, you can say, " hey get over it ok?" but... i cant stand merciless shelling from a point of authority against an indivivual defenseless victim. she just coolly blasted me, yes, for reasonable reasons, staring out the window and not preparing my work ( i can't accept it when she friggin said i was smart alecky, even now, i feel a little outraged). i was not angry at that moment. really,  not angry. i don't know. just crushed. a friend sitting in the front row winced in pain (i was later told). glad to know that there are friends good enough to share the pain.     anyway, i guess i have to admit that i don't get over this kind of experiences easily. the time when i got pumped by the PE teacher for not wearing PT kit while i was about to play my little own basketball game. It stalked across the ground, its gleaming egg head bobbing up and down in the burning rays. It spitted out noises, forcing its miserable pathetic self upon us. i looked downwards at its sickening eyeballs and tried my logic against its useless piece of shit in its skull. defenseless. and i succumbed. i fell. into pumping position. a certain barbaric bloodlust in me. like lava going down my throat. give me permission, i will butcher it with a blunt knife, fingers, toes, limbs and head. i will bring it so much suffering upon its helplessness that it would wished it and its egg head were never born.    so much  anger . so little  reason .     hate it. just don't like myself being so angered by that worthless form of existence. haiz... wished i never succumbed. wish i had stood tall and face injustice without cowering. wished... always look forward...       friend, don't stop writing. don't stop sitting by me, don't stop telling me the story that has yet ended. i try not to admit, but your voice has inspired me to tell one of my own. even when some of your audience has left, even when the tree which you sit under has changed, some of us are still here. when you feel that no one really listens, feel again. the breeze is there still. go on. writing, please.       she called me last week. for some convienient purpose. then an exchange of messages. i no longer feel the same. yes, i still feel the bouts of excitedness. but really, really, it's not there. it's like flying a kite you did not make. i can just let go... free of any strings attached... the weight of the wind flowing from the hand's grasp...    i don't know how i feel anymore. what i really think. so what if two comes together? is that what i really want? is it? i'm thinking. how about just pure uncomplicated friendship. just bask in each other's presence and simply enjoy it. and live things as they are. should there be a difference? is there a need to differ? i feel that in fact it's ok...    i was just accompanying this girl walking around. talking. killing time softly. it feels alright. and to tell the truth, i wasn't just being nice, i think i was just enjoying my time. was i? i can feel the kinda life she lives in. because i have lived it for years. it's not easy but one will get used to it. i can't really see what i am driving at, i don't want to go on gibberishing.    sis, smile ok! whatever it is, bro is always here. haha, even if you can't see him.

       "you see my middle finger?"  that was what i got from one of the passers-by today. talk about kindness.  oh yeah, haha, no kidding. maybe i heard wrongly, maybe he wasn't talking to me. but well, maybe the maybe-s, that was what i got (but don't worry he didn't exactly show it, otherwise i would have bitten off his head or well, maybe his finger there and then). i guess there's a first for everything, a middle finger for every situation.  anyway, yah, the four words today seem totally unrelated huh? yeah, was on purpose. will cover them. my schedule was fully packed today, hmm... for once (in a long time). morning was a total waste of time. just went to school and showed my face for an uncomplete cashflow game. its like proving my presence to the former excos... i ejected once the parents came in for the explanation of its relevance to the VIP programme. it feels like the VIP seems rather well-rounded... which is good.  the main chapter of my day is the busking duty in orchard road. the buskers were rather good. an enjoyment to work near them, i would say. oh yah, the good old tax collector. going around with a box intimidating hordes of adults. its amazing how a seemingly harmless donation box can send people running away helter-skelter. haha. nah, that's not true. nah at all.  hey, com'on i can't be biased. there were many good people out there, willing to take their time and spare a few cents. and some who donated repeatedly, from box 3 at the recycle bin to box 8 at the steps and then to box 5 further down. and we have those really surprising ones who forked out dollar notes. yes, ten-dollar notes. well, yes goodness naturally. don't mention recovering the glimpse of hope in humanity. it was never lost.  i don't want to talk about those who just hardened their faces and walked right through me or those who shied away with a smile or wave of hand. i'm really alright with these people. it's your money, i don't decide how you  should  spend it. yah, and there are those who grumbleed "already donated!" haha, laxing la, i'm only asking, besides nothing wrong with donating again right? then, i got that constructive criticism...  wasn't exactly angry. really. can't be bothered with every idiot on the street who gives you trash right? wouldn't that make me a really angry idiot. just kinda very unexpected. and well, im not asking ransom for your pet bitch, besides its for good cause, so spare the act-cool act-tough remark will you? haiz...  volunteerism. my work today was purely voluntary :). almost, if not for the 4 hours cip, which i don't really need coz i got 10 already. and it does feel kinda good. like another little candle lighted up in a wax museum. (haha, don't ask how i derive out-of-the-air wierd expressions) and why do i do it? i could spend that time better sleeping or playing stuff. haha, or mugging (yeah, right). not too sure. but i would like to strip things down to its necessary bareness. i would like to do that for everything.  maybe i just want to show off. add another point to my niceness factor. show that im a kind and whole person. maybe i want to spend my time meaningfully. otherwise, i guess i will be wasting my life away again. probably at the computer. or bed. maybe, it's just me feeling like doing something good. for the community. a payment in energy and labour. and yes, i do feel more whole. like i am proud of my day and have a purpose.   :)   im not too sure how to define it.  haha, and was i exhausted. tired with my legs zombified already. then my roomate brought me around orchard area to let me familiarise with the area. i have been around the country for years more than him but i am walking blind when in that area. embarassing yes, but it's gotta be corrected. i basically went around, also looking for my much desired spawn comic books. there's some finds in a small cool shop in cine but freaking blast shards in the big shop in taka. way too big. it's like "we have found what you want, it's on earth."  thanks. and frigging popular was closed in comic section. in the end... empty-handed but wallet-full though. spawn seems to be a rare species anyway, endangered? hard to find. other heroes seem to be less interesting. argh, been sneezing for the past few half-hours.hate sneezing, makes me utterly spent. oof...  saw her today. in fact, she saw me. and said "hi!". i was surprised that i didn't do a thing. didn't talk more. didn't ask for her new number. didn't ask how she's doing. didn't ask her to go drink some coffee together. didn't do anything. except say "hi!". except looked surprised. except look at her walking away, lost in the crowds. lost...  i don't want to misunderstand myself. i think i have over-exaggerated stuff a little. gimme music, coins and books, you can take my blood...

       haha, nah was just debating with my friends on the frigging names of the two atomic bombs. is it fat boy? little man? wth... coz we firmly believed in the name fatboy  as we had seen it in computer games... Argh!!! computer games.... darn! anyway, it's fat man and little boy. i checked it out already.   mum's been sickeningly worried about my xams. yeah, yeah, i know she's only concerned. besides, i haven't been working hard for the frigging mid years. it's real bad i know. i'm not exactly worried about mid years, coz i know i don't really have any expectations for it. so, laxing... don't worry about something if you cant do anything about it anymore. so, here i am geared up for the promos... to burn it all up. YEAH! it's just the way mum worries. Sickens me.  realised i don't talk  that  much about school day and stuff... i guess everyday is quite the same as the other... well, haha unless i forget anything, that is. it's not ordinary, it's just equal. i love it. everyday fun filled... with joy and laughter together with friends and play. with stress and frustration while coping with undone tutorials and greek lectures. (yeah, and copying work, which i do intend to curb, and hiding the fact that i didn't do my work from teachers. oh heck) yeah, you could say i love everyday. haha, almost.  OC. anybody out there who is a fan of it? haha, its on tomorrow at 2230 i tink. which means shit. light's out at 2300. means they will damit lock up the tv room. haiz, and i hate to watch a nice show cut halfway. i like the oc. nice. it stirs up something in me. and well, ahem , besides that the girls are HOT... the center guy is very... cool? i don't know. he's got this air around him. very shure of himself and awe-inspiring...  confidence  i think... it's confidence that brings him out. and it's very role-modelish. and i wana be something like that too. that inner strength in you. like you are very sure about yourself. and i say it's not easy. it isn't just like that. splat you have it- confidence. no.  because you are always concerned about what others think of you.  and in a way, he doesn't for most people. and being concerned about what others think of you isn't BAD. it's just  natural . (hey, i'm refering to myself only and no one in particular ok?) it is alright, i believe. no problemo. but one has to be aware of the degree one is conscious of oneself. you are what you are, don't worry. (i won't drag on talking about how you ahould be ... like this and that coz it's disgustingly naggy)  and that's what i'm trying. (yeah, don't laugh...) do you believe in masks?  wearing a mask long enough will make your skin grow into it.  i kinda believe in that. hence, i don't believe that putting up a front is all bad. it's up to you. and confidence is really that important, i feel. though it ain't all.   yeah, sis don't worry about me. i'm alright ESPecially emotionally. coz its really a long time ago. i'm just... i don't know. but i'm really feel nothing much anymore. numbed? frozen? or stoned? i guess it's nothing like that... it's just dust swept away... swept away...  it's nice enough to just hear a hi. thanks. makes me feel glad enough. hehe, am i happy too easily? sometimes, it just frigs me out to think that there is so much, so much inside me (or you) which i don't say out loud. to many people. many things i would say. why must people hide their emotions and thoughts like a bullet in a wound... deep within?  haha, yeah i know.... all sense is spiralling downwards now. yup, better stop for now.

        "One way to look at an emotion is as the product of any discrepancy between our expectation and actuality. That is why happiness, love and delight wear off, even if the stimuli that initially caused them are still present." -Fieldhead The Mind Game   Just re-read a really nice non-famous book that i really enjoy. The Mind Game. by Hector MacDonald. Really nice. you people out there should give it a shot. It has a lot to do with with emotions. and stuff...  Right, the exams finally over. yeah, like GONE BABY!!! haha, feels good to know that i no longer have to force myself to slog it out. but well, the results... oh what the heck. why should i waste space and time discussing it?   one of my friends has been telling me that i don't really blog  that  often... haha, oh well... never mind. anyway, i was thinking, are blogs exhibitionistic? are they? i guess so. in varying degrees, all blogs are "for show", for others to read. but as i said... varying degrees. there are those who are writing hoping the whole world notices them. some, just contented that there are a few out there... reading... i don't really know and can't settle a conclusion here.  how do i view my blog?  will i still continue if i knew no one, as in no one at all, will read it? will i? will you? does it matter? nah, it's just some thoughts of mine... it really doesn't change much. but if you have any thoughts, tell me... my ear's right here.  recently, been up to SPAWN... yeah, spawn. damn cool, but at 6 friggin bucks for each comic, i could just go rob the bank, or well, rob the comic book shop. so i guess i will stop buying these 6 bucked thingy and as my roomate said, go for the big ones... like thirty buck stuff thats thick and expensive but hopefully more worth it. why spawn?   cause i love it. spawn's been the one standing favorite childhood superhero of mine. spiderman, yeah yeah. by the way, spidey two was great. i thought it was just some over blown movie... but after watching it, hey it is as good as the four stars gleam. so alright, i loved it. used to complain about the main actor's woodiness, but i guess woodiness is very part of parker too.   spawn, a mixture of good and evil. it ain't just all good... in fact it is born of evil. what's with a character that is all goody and stuff? how about evil that is  tainted  with goodness? how can this evil be judged? a sacrifice to evil to triumph evil? that's what fascinates me. wacha say?   i still have a lot to say in fact but im wrapping things up for now. things are quite alright for me, i would say im isolating my isolationist policy... yeah, and yesterday was 5th July. i sent her a message... just to wish her a happy birthday. i told myself, i don't really care. but i was kinda like, waiting around the handphone all day long... waiting for the " 1 message received " thing to appear. do i really care? do i feel anything anymore? is the past etched in stone?   look forward... don't look back...

        back in my previous school, i used to write erm what they call English Writing... so this is something like taht... just writing every week... but not under the whip and stick of the english teacher. just free-lancing i guess. feels kinda carefree...       whatever... been thinking more bout year-end recently. and i really want to do well this time. and whatever for? im not too shure. cant seem to find any real purpose. for myself? satisfy my pride? my ego? to show off? to show the world that i too can be "brilliant student"? for my parents? so that they will not be disappointed once again? tell me... coz i really dunoe and can hardly see a purpose.  tell me.      a fight that has lost its purpose is a losing battle.       anyway, im thinking for making up a list i WANT to do for say maybe this year or by the next. hmm.. could be interseting... but it maybe a little striking? or something like that. haiz... i must be running out of things to think about...       "she's a walking pool table"     "look at him... how his nostril hair sticks out"     "the great white shark"       i do crinch inside when i hear stuff like that. sometimes. i'm not exactly shure why. maybe it is the monstrous unfairness of it all. taking someone's physical attributes and nailing him or her down. it hurts. does it not?       maybe its just that i kinda know how it feels. how it just is not fair, unjust when something like that happens. and i know. sometimes, i laugh along... succumbing to peer pressure. making me feel hypocritical ta the same time.      "stones and stick can break skin and bones. but words can hurt even more"      got something like that from some book i read. so sad to think that our image is so critical... today... even in the past... and definitely in the future... wished that more people can look past the mask. but i know, i myself cant even do that. its just one big mess...      well, cant be too bothered... waiting for tomorrow to come.

         have you ever mad e a girl happy? do you know how happy that makes you?       this is in fact about a few days ago. i was slogging through that friggin interview thingy... writing down the entire transcripts and all. and it's in fact quite simple.   step 1) play tape step 2) stop tape and write down whatever you have made sense of step 3) rewind tape now repeat the above three hassle-ful, easy steps for  n  times where  n  is the maximum number of times you can flex your fingers or thumb before they drop right off. For every ten repetitions of these steps, step 2 cannot be carried out at all. Nevertheless, repeat the three steps faithfully for another few times. Bang your head against the wall. now, skip step 2 until it can be carried out.  and before i was near halfway done (trust me, you will want to tell yourself you're very near the end of the interview after every fullstop), i felt like going to sleep already. but, i thought of the pleasant surprise sis was going to receive the next day, and i knew then and there i would finish the whole thing that night before i touch the bed.  i don't really know how happy she was. or how surprised. or for how long. but that smile on her face. caught between the tick of the second hand. the twinkle in her innocent eyes. feeling the joy. and knowing that i had slogged through the 3 steps  n  times the previous night. just for that short instant. that smile...   priceless...     Anyway, todays the celebration and stuff. how very boring. the emcees... haiz, seriously cant make it. sorry for saying that but maybe it's just the scriptwriter that suck. but anyway, hope they get better next time, right? it's always a risk. everytime you go on stage, there's a good chance some idiot down there says you suck. and so and so and so...  watched the best action drama comedy film this year. the house of flying daggers. i think it's the only movie that fits that category. wasted my friggin bucks. darn. though i got a few good laughs out of it. the main girl died and awaken at least five times i tink. haha. damn funny.  yeah, then walked around the area for the rest of the sunny afternoon hours walking walking walking... i had to admit it isn't the most exciting thing to do on earth.. but it really is alright. they kept asking me why i look so bored and tired and was afraid that i would be pissed. but frankly, i'm alright. it's fine to walk about a little.  i was thinking about how very fragile and volatile happinesss can be. how it can, like a cheap lousy perfume, just fade away just minutes after spraying it. how it can, like the bones in your body, be so easily and simply fractured and shattered with a blow.  and how sadness and sometimes anger can cling on to you. like a parasite. how it stays on you... and steadily eats you inside out. like a long breath out, one you can never stop.
