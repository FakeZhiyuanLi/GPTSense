       Spinning: Clay Aiken - I Will Carry You*   Revision's been stagnant.  Too  stagnant. I've only gone through 'the multiplier process' and 'equilibrium national income' of Macroeconomics - Theory of Income and Employment... Uh-oh.  It's times like these, I'm thankful that I'm not taking four A level subjects or any heavy subjects like Geography or History. Literature's all the reading and novels - something I wouldn't mind doing cause its one subject I really like. Math's all practice - so I'm hoping I can do well in that. Economics is a whole bunch of concepts to understand. Once I'm done with that. Yee-hah!  In the meanwhile, I just can't get myself started. I'm in for a whole lot of trouble if I don't start. It's not that I don't know it, it's just, I can't get started. Those who take Chemistry would know: There's just not enough activation energy!  (P.s. Life seems to be all about revision now huh... Sigh.)  Hoping God kicks me in my behind to give me a jumpstart, Sherm

       Spinning: Kelly Clarkson - Beautiful Disaster*   I refuse to go through my whole mourning phase again. I refuse to choose to walk around with a vacuum instead of a heart. I refuse to be where I was a month ago.  I will lift my head up high. Trample whatever obstacles. And move on.  Life still goes on. And I better get back to the flow of things. I'll start by studying for my common tests. Heh.  (P.s. Economics is just about to frying my brain already.) Sir Germy

      I made this montage with me Pre-U Sem pictures. The background's actually the montage we did during one of the activities during the seminar.  In the process of 'changing it up'... A paradigm shift. Haha. Redirecting me focus to God.   urlLink    Dream Team - that is only a memory&nbsp; urlLink

       Spinning: Nothing in particular.   The study group thing didn't happen. How silly of me. Still living in the Pre-U Sem days. But isn't everyone? I thought they were... But everyone's moved on.  I checked out Christopher's blog yesterday. He's moved on. I checked out Adel's... It's not sure if she has but I think she would have already, seeing as she's taking her A's this year and all. Amiirah has, her display picture's no longer of the Pre-U Sem group. Not that that's a big sign. Rachel too, she moved on the day she came back... Had to play for mass. Even my "darrrling" haha... Jeremy... He's busy mugging. Don't know if he's moved on, but yeah. I'm not blaming them, not gonna, cause we'll all move on sometime. If not sooner, later.  But what happened to the 'Dont lose touch'-s and the 'Dont let it fade'-s? Did they mean nothing? Boy does that suck. And poor gullible me still thought it wouldn't happen. Well it did. Apparently.  Maybe I'm overreacting. Maybe I'm just being an idiot. Maybe I shouldn't have placed so much hope in such a thing to start with. The only reason I placed so much hope in it was cause they gave me such security. Don't ask me how, but they did. Sigh.  My security should be in God. Not people, not things. Missing my Pre-U Sem mates heaps   Security - Stacy Orrico +  Another day, all alone again Someone please love me Another game, another broken heart Why do I do this to myself  I could look and try to find someone Who won't leave me lonely But then I found I didn't need to search Cause You were the one and You came to me  You fought for my heart and You have won it You're taking me over and I like that I tried other love but couldn't feel it I'm so glad you found me because  I need you so close to me Cause You're the only one that makes my life complete Oh Lord, I know that it took so long to see That You're my security You won't go away from me And now I know that I don't ever have to worry Cause my heart feels so very free You're my security...   Moving on and changing it up, Sherm, better known as Sir Germy. Hehe.

       Spinning: Buffy on television   I found out through the course of this week, that JC life can be summarised with one word. Mugging. That's all my classmates are doing, that's all close to all of my Pre-U Sem mates are doing, that's all probably more than 80% of the JC students in Singapore are doing. Not that I blame them. In fact, good on them!  Part of me doesn't care and part of me knows I have to join the muggers sooner or later. In fact... I'm might just be joining a few of me Pre-U Sem groopies to study tomorrow. Only... I find it pointless. Like I don't have a motivation to study.  I guess what's settling in is a sense of purposelessness. Something that I'll have to face. But thanks to God, I don't have to worry about purpose. So help me God.  Then... There's this nagging feeling inside. I don't know what it is. I guess, cause me Pre-U Sem mates kinda gave me a sort of security, they can also take it away - deliberately or not. You see, I've been trying to get a sort of group study thing happening, but apparently it ain't. It's really not their fault. Priorities are priorities. They need to study. Not in a group cause it's not the best I guess...  But that's not the problem. Is it? I don't know what is. I'm going mad. Ignore me.  Germy

       Spinning: Guy Sebastian - All I Need Is You*   Hahaha! Well apparently, someone at home damaged the taphead of our shower and now water won't stop flowing from it. That meant we had to cut the mains. It was really amusing how we collected water to last the night until tomorrow morning when my dad gets a new tap or shower mixer as they call it. Water's precious. Save every drop of it. Sounds like a campaigh huh.  I thought I should have taken some pictures and... I did. Hee. Here they are... Haha!   urlLink    Collecting water in buckets&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Bottles filled with water for drinking :S&nbsp; urlLink

       Spinning: Guy Sebastian - What A Wonderful World*   I really do. They're always jam packed, humid, stuffy, not  that  clean and hot! And it just ticks me off that it causes my short fused dad to well, lose his temper. And I hate when that happens.  We went to this hawker centre at Changi Village which supposedly has good food for dinner and I wasn't all happy with the idea but I went along with it anyway. And well... my dad was just showing his frustration. Won't blame him for that, cause that's how my grandfather was, but yeah. You're christian now dad... Won't you behave like one?  It just irritates me, these places known as hawker/food centres... Grr! I probably should get jogging now anyways...  Germy

       Spinning: Will Young - Love The One You're With*   A new blog. A new beginning. How apt. I think I'm at a turning point in life now...  Anyone who reads my blog and anyone who really knows me would know that I'm walking around with a gaping hole in my soul. Something I lack - the feeling of being loved. It came up as looking for love and acceptance in the area of music, fame and popularity. Also appeared as the constant desire for that love and acceptance to come in the form of a one person - my soulmate.  But I was at a point in my life where I was just broken. Running on empty. And yeah, it felt like I was walking around with a huge gaping hole in the core of my very being.  Not now. Not anymore.   Lord I give you me I give you my all I hold nothing back I'm answering your call Though I live or die Your glory is my life My royal destiny Lord I give you me  Lord I give you me It may not look like much I know that I need change I know I need your touch Take me as I am Place me in your plan That's where I want to be  Lord I give you me Lord with every breath I worship you in life I worship you in death I lay down my heart That's all I have to give As long as I live Lord I give you me   I've got to go for Prayer Meeting soon but I'll finish this post when I get back...  See yawl Rock on peeps. Sir Germy ;)

       Spinning: Jason Mraz - The Remedy (I Won't Worry)*   Do they?  First it was the Lit PC Paper, then Math and Econs clashing, then Lit Paper 1 and 4, then my AO chinese oral exams and now this.  I know I'm gonna get slaughtered for putting so many 'then'-s in one sentence, but yeah.  I'm way stressed out. I screwed up my Math, Econs and Lit up, that's practically all my papers, but I won't know until I get the results I guess. But my orals, I'm sure I messed up - BIG TIME.  I supposed to lead worship tomorrow and Sarah can't play. I don't wanna put her in a difficult spot either, so I'm stuck having to get things working. I have no idea how. And I'm feeling a tinge of regret. Regret for not picking up the keys earlier this year. Ahh!!  God you take everything k. EVERYTHING. Cause I'm breaking - I know it'll work out. Cause God, you always pull through. ALWAYS.  Hopeful, Sherman

Whether I've done it well or not is another thing. Guess what? I think I my math paper's done for. And Lit PC? Nonononono... Miss Kon said more than half the papers she already marked have an actual fail... Oww!  AO Chinese oral exams today were aiight. Guess what? I read snow skiing as ice skating in chinese!! Ahh!! A complete giveaway huh. Telling the teachers straight in the face that my chinese SUCKS. Heh. The best part is, those two words came out like. 5 times in the whole passage. Yes, five times. I'm sooooo glad I didn't look up 'cause I'm sure the teachers must have been laughing their bottoms off.  I thought there were a lot of things to do during the exams period. Who knew. More stuff to do now! I need to get a haircut, use this Haagen Daz voucher, shorten my CDs-to-buy list ;), maybe get my hair highlighted, meet up with me Pre-U Sem mateys, do my holiday assignments and I know there's much more, just that I can't remember! :S  I can't believe I'm about to say this, but I might actually miss exam life! Heh. The going-homes before 4, the homework-lessness and the air-conditioned hall! Haha!  P.s. Missing my Pre-U Sem mates heaps... - Amazing what living with people for 6 days can do to you huh.

       Spinning: United Live -Free +   Yes! I'm left with Lit Gothic and Silas Marner now. Wahahahahaha!  Gp was aiight. Nothing much to be talked about, 'cept I'm beginning to loathe application questions. Lit Practical Criticism paper... I couldn't do like half the paper... :S Chinese. I could actually understand and do the comprehension and summary! THANK YOU GOD!  Had Math and Economics today. What a combination right? Both heavy papers together. Agh! Spent the whole of yesterday doing Math, only to find out that the paper was a killer. Didn't touch Economics except in the holidays and it was freakin' simple! Could have done it well if I ACTUALLY read through it yesterday... Grr!!!  That aside... I'm just lost now. Blur. So many things happening at once. I have to choose songs for worship for the next two weeks, AO Chinese Oral examinations are on Friday, My lit texts for Friday are untouched, my gosh. So many things on my plate.  I think I'll start studying only tomorrow. Hmmm...  Taxed to the max, Sherm

       Spinning: Nothing in particular.   I haven't been updating this thing regularly lately huh...  Sigh. My results suck. I failed Math miserably. 35.7% - An AO pass. Which means I'm still at the O level standard. Econs, I topped the class, but the results weren't great anyway - a 47%. A bare A level pass. And guess what? I FAILED GP!!! AHHHH!!! And the best part? By one mark!!! 44%!  But that's not gonna get me down. I won't let it. And that's not the problem... About other stuff though, sometimes one has to wonder why me and why  not  me. I'm not gonna wallow in self-pity, but like I said. sometimes one has to wonder why.  I hate to have such an entry after awhile, but yeah.  I know I have to trust. Trust God. And I'll try...

I got myself in for a whole lot of trouble today. I unwittingly got myself as the head of some planning committee for a carnival happening on Racial Harmony Day. Ouchies. I'm just hoping God helps me through this!  I picked out a couple of pictures to put in my locker already. It's cool! Cause I got myself some photo clips specially for lockers. Hee. I should put up a picture of it here when its done.  Sigh. Changes... Gerald from my secondary school's leaving for New Zealand tomorrow. When I saw Jocelyn's nick saying we should meet at 6 at the Changi Airport MRT Station, I seriously thought it was 6am! Well anyway... So many people that were in my life are going overseas already. There was Jessie, Aarika and now Gerald. Joanna's going overseas soon too. I think it's a matter of time before I decide to leave too. Sigh.  Nostalgia sets in as the memories I have of those peeps sorta surface.  Sherm.

Cause it was either I'm way stressed out or I just watched Message in a Bottle - it does that to people. Haha!  I think it's not that I'm low or I'm wallowing in self-pity, it's just that I've sorta come to a realisation of certain things, and I might just have to get used to things.  We can't change our circumstance, but we can change how we treat the circumstances. And thanks to God, I can react to these circumstances in the way He thinks its best.  Fantasia's a good singer! Haha. I bought her single today. Wow. Heh.   It had nothing to do with buying Fantasia's CD, but I need to go for vocal training real soon!  Sherman

       Spinning: Jason Mraz - You and I Both*   Love.  I saw the Message in a Bottle just. I wasn't exactly excited about the ending, but nonetheless, it was a good show... I guess.  Love lost, love found, and love lost again.  If ever I were bless with an opportunity to love and be loved. And if my mate was taken away from me, I'd be crushed. Like Kevin Costner's role in the movie, Garrett Blakes? Yeah. I'd die. Or part of me would.  Love's strange... to me at least.  Never actually had a chance before. Heh. Talk about a hillbilly huh. Everyone in the world's now like in love. "Oh I'm so in love with so and so," "Oh I think I'm in love! *shrills*" -_-*  Love'll never be mine.  Don't ask me why I added this. I sorta have this gut feeling, like I'll never meet my soulmate before I go home to be with God. I stand to be corrected. And 'Disclaimer' I never was planning to speak it into existence, if I was actually meant to even have a soulmate.  Love has to be cherished.  As Maisarah so affectionately puts it, "it's true 'la' in life, expect the unexpected". You people out there, who actually have or had love, cherish that. Some people aren't as lucky.  I'll stop preaching now. Sherm

AND, there's a PW meeting too! Damn! That means, no going home before 2. Agh!  I don't know if I'm alright. I really don't. I've been brushing whatever I'm feeling aside cause of the speed of school life. I'm also soooo grateful for two more people... Melissa and Sueann. Thanks you two, for checking up on me and praying for me respectively. Thanks heaps. I really need prayer! Heh.  I don't wanna brood about things anymore... I'll just end up all depressed and all, so yeah... I'm only brushing it aside again, but it'll come back. Sigh.  Me Kayaking course is this Sunday. And I've got a Photography Club outing on Saturday... I don't think I'll be in church this week. Maybe its better also... To take a break from all that church.  And to Rhordan, Angie, MJ and Jo...

I got back my results and I got a D7 in GP (A fail!), a C6 in Mandarin (I can't believe I did better in Chinese than in English!), an AO pass for C Math, a D for Lit (Still an A level pass k!) and an E for Economics (Still a pass also!). I think it's pretty ok. Everything's seemingly great for me, but it ain't.   Note to God: I've tried going on in faith, hoping you would work things out for me God, but they haven't. I'm none more than disappointed. Ok, maybe more than that, I'm hurt... why didn't you do anything? Maybe I'm being silly by blaming you, but really. I can't go on anymore. Won't you do something, something that really matters to me, and win my trust again God? - your kid that really needs help, Sherman   Maybe I should take my results as something that mattered when it didn't? Sigh.  Sherman

       Spinning: The NKF Childrens' Medical Fund charity thing on television.   I wasn't feeling too good about everything and I was having this conversation with Sarah Tan and Jessie. It was then I realised why God made the church. Why he wanted the church to be a community. Cause it was in the conversation with Sarah and Jessie, that I took a step back and looked at it, and smiled. I'm so thankful for these two peeps. It's not that I became all well again, but I was thankful that I knew I could fall back and these two people, heck, my whole small group would be there for me. I'm not all better and everything - not that they didn't help, they did. But I was happy and I was sure God was smiling too. As Rhordan would say 'Bullseye'.  Sherman

       Spinning: Horrid Mediacorp Artistes  trying  to sing on television   I didn't feel up to being social today, so after worship I left service and went to chill at Superbowl - the country club my parents have a membership at. I went for a good swim. Cause the sun was like high up in the sky, I no longer look like the pale sickly guy I've been looking like the past two weeks or more.  I'm slipping back to the mode I was like some time ago... Walking around with a huge gaping hole. Sigh... I know not what to do...  Sherm

      I hate life.  I hate having to wake up to go to JC in the morning.  I hate never being able to go home before 4 on weekdays.  I hate being all alone.  I hate being stuck by myself.  But I can't do a sh*t about it.  And the only one who can do anything about it ain't lifting a finger to help!   That's maybe why I'm drifting off...   Sherm

      Spinning: My aching head.   What a week.   All that hustle and bustle.   What scares me is, God wasn't a part of it.   And I don't wanna become a pagan.   Or do I?   Sherman

       Spinning: Hills - More Than Life +     &nbsp;  So many things have been happening. Way too many things.  I got my kayaking one-star&nbsp;award already!  I'm a qualified kayaker now. Way to go! Haha.  I'm officially done with Racial Harmony day.  Oh wait. I still have an evaluation to do. Darn.  I'm lagging behind so much in my studies it ain't funny.  All my A level subs 'cept lit. Sigh.  I'm hovering between going back to God,  and being deterred from ever going back.  Good or bad? I have no clue.  I'm emceeing for Guitar Night and its tomorrow night!  I'm officially Mr. Morning Announcements.  Thank God they're doing something about it.  I'm running Recollections for the National Day Concert.  Way to go Sherman. Sticking your nose into so much stuff.  Your studies might just be affected. Your health is suffering.  (I make it sound like I've got some terminal illness don't I?)  Heck your faith is wavering. Get a grip!  I'm working on it!    jesus&nbsp;i believe in you, jesus&nbsp;i belong to you, you're the reason that&nbsp;i live, the reason that&nbsp;i sing, with all i am...     &nbsp;   i love you, all of my hope is in you, jesus christ, take my life, take all of me...    I really wanna sing those two choruses with all I am. But I really feel I can't. I'm working on it! God... help!

The past month has been crap. Seriously. C.R.A.P. I'm lagging so much behind in math and econs. But it's alright. Everything's fine. I was drifting away from God then.  But now I'm back. And I've got God. Nothing is impossible. Nothing. God. Take all of me.  Sherm.
