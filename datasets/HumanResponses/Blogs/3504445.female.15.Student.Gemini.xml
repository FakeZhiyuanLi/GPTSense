      i don know what is happening now? is it me or is it really the end of our friendship? i don know. never call never sms never email. no news nothing. i wonder if whatever i confess to him causes all this to happen. but it can't be. i already ask him to promise that whatever i told him will not affect our friendship. he promised! but what is happening now? it's been exactly one month since he last called me. can he be that busy that he can't call me? well who am i to him for him to call everyday ritee. i'm nobody. nobody who loves somebody. i really treasure this friendship. he's the only one whom i still keep in contact with. he's always making me laugh and make my day. i still remember everytime he calls my heart will beat faster. after that last call, i've been like a fool. running to the phone every time it rings but in the end to be heartbroken to find out it's not him. even if he doesn't want to talk to me anymore, i'm kinda fine with it but couldn't he just open his mouth and tell me?? keeping quiet is more hurting then saying it. i'm now confused. can't reach him via his mobile. wonder if he purposely change his no. probably. i din say it is true that he changed his no. well wanted to call his house alot of times but i'm just afraid. afraid of him. afraid that he doesn't want to talk to me. but all i wanna know is  are we still friends? are you still talking to me?   plss i want to know. don keep silent. silent kills. it hurts soo much after you left me years ago. but you manage to heal my heart when you decided to keep in contact with me. i;m so faithful. i'm still liking you. but you just can't see it. now don break my heart again with your silence. well i let destiny decide..       LOVE ME NO MORE (by Bardot) i toss and turn in bed can't get you out of my head even though you're so far away i need you here with me oh boy, why can't you see that i can't live without your love when i close my eyes i think of you well i wish i had you here with me but there's nothing i can do, oh oh  chorus counting every day that goes by and the tears that i cry (tears that i cry) you don't wanna love me no more wish that you could hold me tonight i'm hurting inside cause you don't wanna love me cause you don't wanna love me love me no more  i tried to call your phone but you ain't been at home i need to find out where you are so i can make you see that you belong with me for me there is no other love when i close my eyes i think of you i wish i had you here with me but there's nothing i can do, oh oh  repeat chorus  all i know is that i can't live without you ooh, but i wanna know what made you feel this way i'll be right here for you (right here for you) and everything that you do (thing that you do) but how can i get close to you when you don't feel the way i do, ah hah  repeat chorus to fade

      well. i feel like i'm fated to be with an aquarius. look at this   test no one. took it at www.astocenter.com    Gemini & Aquarius  The Aquarian ability to devote body and soul to the cause of justice attracts the respect and love of the Gemini, who will vie to conquer this rare love. Once the two Air signs are united, they will merge into a shared pleasure in action, excitement, and rebellion against stuffy conventions. Together, they believe life gives them the right to freedom and independence. Nothing stops or separates them. Friends as well as lovers, they will unite their souls in making their life into a masterpiece, a great and exciting adventure.    test no two. took it from http://web.tickle.com  Rafidah, the best Zodiac Match for your personality is Aquarius   Aquarius, the Water Bearer (January 21 to February 19): This friendly and thoughtful partner is just your type. Initially, an Aquarius may catch your attention by showing you their intellectual side and optimistic outlook. But as you get to know them better, you're likely to be even more drawn to an Aquarian's idealistic resolve and focus on making positive change. People born under this sign are frequently capable of seeing both sides in any dispute. This can make them quite talented when it comes to finding creative solutions in your relationship. Your Aquarius may be a bit headstrong at moments, but they'll also tend to look for the bright side in times of trouble. In the bedroom, you'll likely find the Water Bearer both discrete and cautious. An Aquarian will ordinarily make sure that all areas of your relationship are strong before plunging into sex. Overall, Aquarians are solid, unwavering partners and complex people. So, it may take you a little extra time to get to know your Aquarian match, but it's apt to be well worth the wait.   and now some free zodiac compatibility thingy at http://astrocenter.astrology.msn.com//msn/deptlove.aspx?af=-1000  Gemini & Aquarius    The Aquarian ability to devote body and soul to the cause of justice attracts the respect and love of the Gemini, who will vie to conquer this rare love.
