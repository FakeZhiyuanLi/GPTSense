       urlLink Seamania Writings   I have been very busy today. Not sure what brought this sudden rush of enterprise onboard, maybe bacause upon my return next trip I will have a son to occupy all of my attention I know not. But my sudden rush has produced a few little bits and peices here and there. Not great mind boggling stuff but the usual humor prevails and  can be found at these places:      The Three very latest Articles are: One each in the Grumbler, the Psychiatrist and the Politician.  urlLink The Trash Collector ,  urlLink The Mobile Councilor  and  urlLink My Little War . The last two tend more to be largely fictional in style but they suit the topics they were written for.  As with everything else at Seamania take them with a pinch of salt.      Above writing all in a mad rush this morning I have uploaded some more photographs. These are of Taiwan and of Singapore and can be found in the usual  urlLink photograph  section where all photographs are usually located.    Well, must dash and see if I can keep up the pace - might have some excersie now and as all of this beding over the keyboard is well ..... back crunching!

       urlLink Seamania articles and Stories   I actually wote an article this morning, something that I have not done for a while. I got up at the unusually early hour of 6am so maybe that was it! Anyway, strangely enough this article is aout 'writing' and it is called  urlLink The Brain Drain . Have a good read.  Not much else occuring at seamania. I am Still awaiting my marching orders to go back to sea! Terrible time the departures of life but they are more than made up for by the returns or the arrival back home. For every departure there is a subsequent return. The sadness and the happiness in life, the troughs and the crests. And there is alot to say for the expression "absence makes the heart grow fonder", I know from experience that this is true.  Well, I might just go and write another article or have an afternoon nap - seeing as how I got up so early.  Ieuan Dolby

       urlLink Seamania: Travel articles, Marine writings and Cultural Diversity   I received this email from an upset webmaster this morning..............   Dear Mr Dolby,  In what section of our links would you like to be?  In the meanwhile, could I make a few comments/suggestions? First, when you write to someone else asking for a link, it would be nice if you already had the 'reciprocal' link in place :)  Also, while we are not worried about your use of javascript (in fact, we rather like it that Paypal does not appear, nor do the Google advertisements) why do you try and set cookies? Lastly, it is very annoying to have to scroll sideways to see the whole screen - you seem to use a program called "AceHTML 6 Pro" which does not respect an 800x600 screen (still accounts for 80% of users worldwide).   Wow, that is me certainly been told to go and stand in the corner with a dunce cap on!   I feel small, enough to fit through the eye of a needle - except, in contrast to that specific email, I did receive three nice ones. Complimentary ones so my website cannot be that bad! His email had me so worried and upset last night that I did not go to bed. Instead I spent all night searching for imaginary ghosts and spies in my webpages until at 5am I decided that the abusive webmaster was using a linux system or one that was not configured correctly.  Och well! All back to normal!  Must go and have some cheese!

       urlLink Seamania: Travel articles, Marine writings and Cultural Diversity   Quite an amazing thing  found out today - there is this guy in Cuba who can drink water and then spray it out of his eyes - gets up to a 70cm jet distance! If he could get visas he would go travelling around the world to show off his art and make some money on the side - would you pay to go and see that?   I certainly wouldn't.  Anyway, that is not all that is bad with the world. Additional to my latest article on  urlLink mobile phones  I have now found out that a couple in the UK (both over 50yrs) are now seeking councils help. They noticed one fine day that they could not talk to each other, even in public and the only way for communication to exist was through texting each other on their mobile phones, even if they were standing right next to each other. Poor guys, but is there any hope for them? A german doctor reckons that there are 380,000 suffferers alone in his country - and he went on to say that the suffering can lead to depression and personaility disorders not to mention a spiralling phone bill.   Naturally Andreas Herter, who said this might possibly be writing a book on the subject and is by trade a phschotherapist - makes me wonder if he is short of customers, money, fame or attention! Maybe he himself is a manic mobile phone user, but then to give him his due he did make the above observations due to the high number of people turning up at his clinic with mobile phone disorders!  By the way a cheaper therapy for manic texters can be had direct to your mobile phone. A three week texting course on how to stop texting!!!!!!!  Oh well, better go and write some useful article for my website. One week to go before I am due back to sea ..........And silence will reign over the website for another two months at least!

      I spent all day today with a sore neck and a curved back, bent over my computer screen like it was trying to run away from me. And the thing keeps on seizing up like a 20yr old un-oiled bolt with a baby on the end of the spanner.    I bought a computer in Taiwan. The software that came with computer was all in Chinese (of which I don't speak the language) and so I spent the first year writing articles and solving trechnical downloads/setups etc without having a clue as to what I was actually doing. Then I managed to get some English software and after loading windows XP in English all went well for about ten minutes. The my computer started to crash all the time. So I decided in a fit of anger at MSN to load up some linux and get to grips with that - gave up on that as all my previous works were in windows and impossible to convert without much pataince and a computer that works.  And now? I am at the stage of having reverted back to windows but an ME version as the dog bit the XP CD. But the ME just drives the all-powerful all singing and all dancing machine into "rock" status just when I have made some important alteration or addition.  The expert has informed me that my motherboard is out dated and that my RAM is too small for the programs that I use - he had to leave a note as I went out to look at a good old fashioned typewriter - unconnected and can be used anywhere!

      As an interesting sideline does anybody in this world that is not connected to the sea, (often termed a landlubber) know what a seafarer does all day? I would be interested to find out and if possible to publish the answers on my website.  I have in the past published some replies as gained from the OUAP website but I would now like to build upon this - so the question is "What do seafarers do all day"?  Apart from drinking and getting into trouble!  Email me your thoughts on the matter, be they long, short or tall. Sensible, jargon filled or totally abstract they are all welcome - although i retain the right to publish them as I see fit. Names will be attributed to those replies publsihed.  or go to my website and put your answer in the guest book or email me from there.   urlLink Seamania   Thanks again  Ieuan Dolby

      Okay, as an introduction I am a seafarer of eighteen years (if a day) and now writing about it all. Writing about the world, the landlubbers, the culture shocks, the last outbacks of civilisation and just people and situations from all over the globe.  My site can be found here:  urlLink Seamania   Now, this is a blog about my website: a relief from having to write sense and normality to attract customers and hit points, to fight the big companies for placements on search engines and for links with those that see no profit in a "wee" site.  In basis, my website is all about my writings. I write about the sea, and ships in anyway that I choose. I write about travel and cultures from around the globe. I have somephotgraphs of the sea and ships, some that I have worked on. I have a humorous section and a marine glossary. That is my site. It is all free and hopefully it will stay that way.   But increasingly so much time is spent trying to keep the site in the public eye and high up on search engines lists that far less time is spent on actual writing or producing content which is how the others call it. If I dont tend to the marketing then I will just end up with plenty of contnt, if I spend all my time currying favor then I end up with old and stale content. Big companies get around this by paying lots of money ........ I say no more!  But let this blog be a fun filled blog of blogs about nothing and everything and may it bring customers to my site ........othwerwise why would I spend time blogging?  Ieuan Dolby
