      THe day started off a little shakey went to the Jcc and played basketball wiht alex like always. and then i saw jenny skeels and some of her really gay friends but its cool. we layed out for a little and then we jumped off the high dive for a long time. its so much fun hanging out there with alex, i always go off the high dive and it looks like im gunna smack my face on the water but i flip at the last second everytime. and then i met alexs friend Chase Bono who was hillarious. after working out we tried playing basketball but we were so sore we both air balled the first 4 shots. eventually alex caught on but i was still shooting bricks. then we went back in and worked out, even though i always feel out of plce there becasue of body being wat it is, i felt really confident after working on my legs, i lifted twice as muhc as i used to. then we just rode home and talked about stuff like we always do. and then i was informed im invited to Katie wambolds cottage this thursday to saturday. i have to say im pretty excited. alex went far out of his way to get me up there so i really appreciated that. now im just waiting here for the pistons game to come one at 8:30. i have a feeling we will lose, actually i know we probably will its the freaking lakers. but if we could just learn how to control shaq this game better than the last one i think it might be interesting. well im out

      I Took my last exam this afternoon it was a science one and it was 200 fucking questions long. but the period before that was cool i was in commons hanging out wiht Neal Johnson, Casey Riggs, Brian Davis and Brian Harden. there some pretty cool kids i dont know why i never hang out with them. maybe its becasue im so used to my friends i find it hard to go off on the weekend and do stuff with other kids. its like an instant reaction to pickup the phone and call alex or taylor or jared, which is deffeintly not bad. Alex Box has been my best friend since probably somewhere around 2 years ago. our dads where good friends all the way through highschool and still are. im sure youll be hearing alot about him if you actually take the time to read my blog becasue we hang out everyday. Ive known taylor since first grade up to fourth and then i moved and we stopped hanging out now we go to southview toghther. And of course Jared Jakes one of the funniest akward kids i will ever know. i dont know how many words i can find to describe Jared. and no SILENT would deffinently not be one of them. Well im off to the Jcc wiht alex to ball it up, i think ive been getting alot better since ive been going everyday. see ya

      well a Blog of my own its kind of wierd... just the fact that ill probably come home everyday and say what ever i feel making me so vulnerable to the rest of the world to see my feelings and have them judge me. well i think i mostly created this to remember this up comeing summer , hopefully it will be a good one now that this is my first year going into my second year of highschool. for those of your wondering umm "Elsie's Food" is like that becasue Elsie was my old dog actually she was my first dog. and what was funny was that we both had the same favorite food. even if she was just a dog but anyways i gotta study for exams. ok i lied im not gunna study im talking online and i shouldnt be doing that. my mom just walked in from her bool club, i never understood that, of course i never read books... i did read half of Harry potter but then my teacher started reading it so i just let her take over. oh and for those of you whos not up with it pistons won last nights game. so theres one thing to be happy about today
