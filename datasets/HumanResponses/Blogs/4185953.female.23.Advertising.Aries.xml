       I miss miss miss the anime...   I need to watch it to help me realise where i am now and where i should be heading next.   Is life a dream?    When will i finally get to wake up?    Yes... i am totally trapped! How to get out from this bebop web, return to reality and face the truth... what exactly is the truth that everyone is searching for?    Reality is self constructed

        I am the closest stranger to you.     I am who i am because this is who you want me to be...     I do have problem revealing the real me. Not that i am a secretive person... i just do not fancy the thought of someone understanding me as much as i understand myself.     I hate to ask for help... would only do it under desperate measures. I've always been independent, especially emtionally. And i totally hate it when someone ask me to take care of myself, do you think i need your reminder? I love myself more than anyone else... so leave it to me, i can handle this. I know how to take care of myself and i do not need people to ask me to do so.     I am in the journey of finding myself.

        I feel so invincible today!!! i am so so powered up!!! I broke Sharon's key today... YES!!! as in literally broke it into two pieces!!! I accidentally broke it while trying to open her block's back door... when i tried to open the door, it refuses to, so i turn it REAL hard... out came the key.. only the head! the bottom of the key was stuck in the key hole!!! wahahahaha       Come to think of it... i've broke 4 hangers just last week.. all becoz i used too much force to try remove the hanger from the rack. -__-"' What is so wrong with me??? Will you fly if i punch you right in the face? Maybe i could try... so that i can fly you to the Moon!         Fly Me To The Moon        Poets often use many words to say a simple thing But it takes thought and time and rhyme to make a poet sing      With music and words I'll be playin' For you I have written a song To be sure that you'll know what I'm sayin' I'll translate as I go along (yeah oh yeah)      Fly me to the moon and let me play among the stars Won't you let me see what spring is like On Jupiter and Mars      In other words hold my hand In other words darling kiss me      Fill my heart with song and let me sing forever more 'cause you are all I long for All I worship and adore      In other words please be true In other words I love you In other words please be true(please be true, I just want you to be true) In other words I love you(I love you, I love you) (to the moon)       Just take me to the moon and far yeah           Utada Hikaru

         Been too too lazy to do anything to my old blog... and i've given myself enough reasons to abandon it. Therefore... here i come!!! A new blog, a new look, and maybe a more commited me!  I do not know if life had been kind to me. But i do realise i had been thrown with lotsa decisions to make, some split second decisions that could change my life forever. Who am i to be in control of someone's esle happiness n sorrows? Why am i put into this difficult position? And what makes everyone think i am in the right mind to make the right decisions.  Decisions , Decisions, Decisions... Life is about making choices... the right ones that make you move forward and the wrong ones to make you look back and reflect.  I would think that i've made the right choice today... but this choice could backfire me anytime in the future.       Being me, i am a risk taker and have always been. But not this time...
