      Often in discussions with  friends, we hit on the state of the Catholic university student in America.  Perhaps I sound like an unrealistic optimist, but I am usually pretty hopeful.  For four years at Christendom I was surrounded by serious young Catholics.  It was "normal" to see a great percentage of the students attend daily Mass.  We all agreed on the basics.  Now that I'm home, I'm able to get together with my old friends from high school.  They too are all good Catholics, but we all have different college stories to tell.  Some who went to larger Catholic universities do not share my optimism. They tell stories of low morality among the student body and Catholic professors who are far from authoritative on serious issues.  Some friends often felt isolated and their desire to participate in the social life of the university clashed with their personal disgust with the lives many of their fellow students.  While I am grateful for my experience at Christendom, sometimes I wonder if it presented me with an realistic impression regarding the state of our young university peers.    Some of my friends are now in graduate school and their observations regarding the morality of their fellow students is equally troubling.  Those in medical school tell of professors and students who disregard the transcendent dignity of the human person in favor of a cold, utilitarian vision of medicine. In our discussions, my friends and I agree that many young Catholics feel a void in their souls.  They are searching for something that would give meaning to their existence.  If they are presented with the truth in a way that personally relates to them, they will usually respond. The "If it feels good, do it" motto of our parents' generation has become old and many young people are beginning to realize this and are embracing religion in the hope of finding meaning and fulfillment. Many have accepted the challenge of Pope John Paul II to live a life of responsibility and holiness.  Our current culture preaches a radical individualism that results in a sense of self-alienation and emptiness.  There's definitely a lot of work to do, but it looks like there is a light at the end of this tunnel.  Young Catholics are embracing their faith with renewed appreciation and hope.  Maybe we could start a little discussion of our own experiences and thoughts regarding this topic.  We all come from different backgrounds, some are students, others are in the work force or military, so each insight will be extremely useful in arriving at a better understanding of the current situation.

      One reason US Army Ranger Pat Tillman’s tragic death in Afghanistan has captivated so many people is that his death put a human face on the more than 800 American soldiers who have died serving their country.  In so many ways, Americans are grateful for the sacrifice of this young war hero.  He dramatically personifies what can easily become just a numerical statistic, reminding everyone of the tragedy of each life lost.  He will also continue to inspire young Americans and teach them the meaning of sacrifice, honor and duty.  Pat Tillman was only 27 years old but his life reflects a larger movement among young Americans who are called by a sense of service and responsibility.  The pop-culture in America today relentlessly targets the young with a “if it feels good, do it” motto.  This message, aimed directly at impressionable young minds, promotes radical individualism, overindulgence and narcissism.  Freedom and love are divorced from any notion of responsibility.  Despite the powerful and unfortunate grasp this message has on many young people, a growing number of them are realizing that such a lifestyle will leave them with a painful emptiness.  Such young people, like Pat Tillman, realize that a life of service results is a much more fulfilling vocation. In light of the growing controversy over the Iraq prison abuse, it would be helpful and wise to remember that the great majority of our young soldiers is made up of individuals, heroes, like Pat Tillman.   urlLink    Pat Tillman  Tillman understood clearly the risks involved in joining the Army Rangers.  He was deeply affected by the events of September 11, 2001 and felt called to serve a higher purpose.  He willingly embraced a more difficult vocation with all the risks involved, leaving a multi-million dollar career in the NFL to serve his nation in the war on terror.  He was called to serve and to protect the liberties he and all Americans enjoy on a day to day basis.  It was a service ultimately rooted in love of neighbor.  His decision to serve was a sincere one, so sincere that he avoided any and all fanfare to follow him as a result.  The Holy Father often reiterates that only in giving of oneself, completely and unreservedly, can one find fulfillment and purpose in life.  This “gift of self” comes in many different forms throughout one’s life.  Certainly Pat Tillman, who understood the meaning of a higher calling, personifies this notion of “gift” to a heroic degree.  He responded, in his own way, to the call to live a life for others. Tillman helped Americans identify more personally with the other soldiers who, in a similar manner, offered up their lives in the name of service and love.  It is a sad fact that many of the soldiers who have died in combat were young.  It is a remarkable tribute to their character that these young citizens undertook such a self-less and dangerous task in the prime of their lives, fully aware of the perils that lay ahead.  These soldiers embody the very best of the current generation of young Americans.  America’s youth will no doubt be inspired by the example of Pat Tillman and will likely emulate his life of service and sacrifice in their own way.

      Time will tell how large an impact the presidency of Ronald Reagan will have on history.  For now, it’s safe to say that much of what we enjoy as Americans today can be traced back to Reagan’s legacy.  National pride, national security, and economic prosperity were brought back to a nation that for years had been lost in a mix of scandal, botched military missions and erroneous economic policies.  He also reminded us that the United States of America is a nation set apart, a shinning city on a hill with a global mission to summon the world to the cause of freedom.  In response to the godless Socialism of the pernicious Soviet Union, Reagan boldly asserted the Judeo-Christian morality of Western civilization.  In opposition to détente, Reagan favored strong confrontation of Communism, determined to see its demise.  He reasserted and reinforced the strength of America’s military abroad, and as a result, boosted the morale of our military.  In response to the big government mentality dominant since the time of FDR, Reagan proposed that “government is not the solution, it is the problem”.  He believed in the ability, and dignity, of each individual to achieve anything, so long as government did not interfere.  He reminded us that the strength and beauty of America lies not in the halls of Congress, but in the hearts of ordinary Americans.    Throughout the sixties and seventies, Americans had become rather jaded.  The Watergate scandal had sapped a good deal of credibility from our politicians.  The prolonged conflict in Vietnam, resulting in thousands of American casualties, left America feeling humiliated on a global scale.  America’s ignominious retreat in Vietnam was due more to the incompetence of our political leaders rather than any failure of our military.  Other events, such as the American hostages in Iran and the botched rescue attempt by the Carter administration again left Americans feeling shamed.  While Communism seemed to be spreading without limits, the United States seemed crippled and weak.  When Ronald Reagan came into office after a landslide victory, he immediately let it be known that America was back and injected into our society an optimism and excitement not felt since the early days of the Kennedy administration.  The American hostages were released upon Reagan taking office and over the course of his presidency, the Soviet Union would face a gradual decline in power and influence eventually leading to its collapse.  Reagan insisted on a pay increase for the United States military and restored America’s trust in her Armed Forces.  Reagan believed that if Americans had more control of their hard-earned money, the nation would prosper as a result.  He was right.  His tax cuts resulted in an economic boom and his small government philosophy demolished forever the appeal of big government.  Years later, Bill Clinton himself declared famously, “the era of big government is over”.  Ronald Reagan was unabashed in his faith and trust in God.  This stood in stark contrast to the atheism running rampant throughout Communist controlled states.  His spirit inspired us to once again believe that America was a unique country in world history and that ours was a nation to be proud of.   His joy, humor and optimism was infectious and touched Americans of both parties.   In his eulogy, President Bush said memorably that “Ronald Reagan belongs to the ages now, but we preferred it when he belonged to us”.  This is true.  In a very real way, he is still with us though.  Certainly his policies have had an everlasting impact on the conservative movement in America.  The person of Ronald Reagan transcended the label of “Republican” and party politics.  He was and always will be quintessentially American.    urlLink    Ronald Reagan&nbsp; urlLink

      The United States is a young nation.  Since the founding of this country, we have become an ever-increasing mix of different races and religions.  Contrary to other countries around the world whose people are united by a common race, history or religion, we Americans are united by the principles of our founding; life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  Our ancestors left the Old World for the New World in search of opportunity and freedom.  These prized, sought after goals summoned people from around the world and resulted in a broad melting pot of cultures rarely seen in the history of the world.  Citizens from nations that were hundreds, even thousands, of years old left behind their motherland for this virgin soil.  The United States now harbors within her borders Chinese, Indians, French, Russians, Latin Americans, Italians, Africans, the list goes on and on.  An important question needs to be considered; What is American culture?  If culture is something that results from a people’s shared experience in history, resulting over centuries of societal evolution, what can be said of “American culture”?  Could it be that we have an identity crisis within our borders?    urlLink    American Life&nbsp; urlLink     It would be helpful to consider the role of religion within the life of a culture.  The ancient nations of the world have been molded by the influence of whatever faith is dominant in that particular society.  As a result, religion becomes perhaps the dominant factor in a society’s culture.  Elements that make up a particular culture (art, music, literature or just daily life) are strongly influenced by its particular religion.  This perhaps can most clearly be seen within the life of European nations.  In addition to having very distinct national cultures, (there is a “French way”, an “Italian way”, a “Spanish way”, etc., of doing things) there does exist a shared European culture among most of the nations, in particular the Catholic ones.  It has been said for example, that in Spain the Catholic Church is not a Church, but the Church.  It literally defines the culture of Spain.  Christianity is undeniably the most formative force on the European continent.  Attempts by European leaders to resist acknowledging its Christian heritage in the EU constitution is nothing short of a continental state of denial. This kind of cultural formation can be found on other continents as well, regardless of the religion.  Certainly the ancient nations of Asia have been molded over the millennia by common experience, including most especially, common religion.  Enter the United States of America.  The United States is becoming more and more diverse.  Recent statistics show that Asians and Latin Americans are immigrating to the United States at a massive level.  What defines us as a nation?  Do we have a “way” of doing things?  Is a cultural identity possible with such a diversity of immigrants who possess a wide range of beliefs and values, rooted in vastly different historical contexts?  In what are we “United”? Perhaps it is better to ask, What unites us?  The United States of America is proud of its diversity of different religious beliefs.  Whether Catholic, Jewish, Hindu or Muslim, we are all Americans.  We coexist with any and all peace loving people.  But if what defined a people for centuries was their culture, rooted in ancient religious tradition, what can be said of an American culture?  What will the role of religion be in our culture? Are our founding principles (liberty in particular) enough to form an authentic “culture”, especially since our “culture” is put together by a mixture of other different, and much older, cultures?   At such events as the Olympics, we wave our flag as proudly as any nation.  Our flag is lost in the sea of flags from the nations of the world.  For each flag, there is a distinct culture, a way of life that corresponds to that flag.  The question remains…what is our culture? I'm not suggesting that we don't have one, but it might be harder to pin down than others.

      In my opinion, the situation in Iraq is going very well. Despite the constant barrage of negative news, magnified and dwelled on by the liberal media, the fact is that we’ve accomplished a lot in a short amount of time with a surprisingly low number of casualties. In a little over a year, we’ve toppled a dictatorial regime, captured the former leader and most of his henchmen, and installed a new government. All of this comes with less than 700 American combat losses (some 200 have died in non-combat, accident related incidents). Of course every loss is a tragedy, but we must maintain a sense of perspective when dealing with this issue. For example, before the D-Day invasion of France during WWII, the US lost over 700 troops in a training exercise alone! Remember before the war, so-called experts were predicting tens of thousands of US losses and hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilian deaths. Pessimists are bemoaning that this is another Vietnam-quagmire; “Bring the troops home!” “How long will our troops stay in Iraq?” The answer is, as long as it takes to get the job done. US soldiers remained in Germany and Japan for years after the conclusion of WWII to assist with reconstruction. We’ve been in Iraq little over a year and already, some are getting tired calling for a withdrawal. What ever happened to our resolve and appreciation for history? The great potential of a free and democratic Muslim state in the Middle East threatens the very existence of terrorism. Terrorists thrive under corrupt governments that refuse to root them out of their society. They operate under the cover of secrecy and darkness. A free and open society, with leaders held accountable to the rule of law, naturally deters terrorism. It’s no wonder the terrorists in Iraq are engaged in an all-out battle to undermine and destroy the new Iraqi government. It seems like they realize what’s at stake more than the American left.    urlLink    American Resolve&nbsp; urlLink       The insurgency remains a problem, and a case can be made that we underestimated their resolve going into the war. However, this does not mean that America has lost control of the situation. The media gives the impression that Iraq is on the verge of all out chaos. This conflicts with the reports of numerous soldiers who have returned from Iraq and have commented that the situation is not nearly as dire as reported by the American media. One soldier commented that he was more worried about the situation as a result of watching media coverage here than when he was actually fighting in Iraq! The fact is the attacks in Iraq are committed by a relatively small group of terrorists and insurgents. Recently, insurgents threatened to kill foreign terrorists who have been responsible for the murdering of innocent Iraqis. This indicates that Iraqis are uniting in their efforts to rid their land of terrorists. Iraqis understandably don’t want to be occupied by a foreign army, even less do they want to be plagued by car bombs, which result in hundreds of dead innocents. As much as they oppose US occupation, they realize that the real enemy is the terrorist, not the United States. The goal of the terrorists was to unite with the insurgency to force an American withdrawal and they have failed. As Iraqi security forces are taking an increasingly visibly presence in Iraq, the everyday Iraqi will unite behind their security forces and the terrorists will be on the run. We need to view operation Iraqi Freedom in perspective and realize how much we have accomplished in such a short time. We also need to remember that the best way, the only way, to honor the fallen is to get the job done.

      This is an article that I recently finished as part of my CCHD internship and will be part of a regional push for the CCHD fund drive. I thought that perhaps it could elicit some thoughts, as real justice is unfortunately hard to find in these days. It is very a popular catch phrase and has been commecialized more than any other virtue; except Love.   The Catholic Campaign for Human Development (CCHD) works to foster justice throughout America.   Justice is based upon the uninfringeable dignity of the human person, made in God's image and likeness and destined for eternal bliss forever in heaven. When we consider the respect every individual deserves "from the standpoint of divine revelation, inevitably our estimate of it is incomparably increased. Men have been ransomed by the blood of Jesus Christ. Grace has made them children and friends of God, and heirs to eternal glory."   A thorough regard for the rights of all men begins with the just ordering of civil law, "to the upholding of which we Christians have to contribute with all our strength as exemplary citizens." This begins with the laws that defend the right to life, that principle right, from the moment of conception.   However, this vital contribution, which we must make wholeheartedly, is not enough.   We are constantly confronted with opportunities to be vessels of justice in our interactions with each other. We must strive to be honest in our dealings with others, avoiding rash judgments based on calumny or hearsay, and also gossip that needlessly embarrasses others among their friends or society at large. Ultimately, just actions propel us to give to each person what is his due. Can we really be living as God asks if we are not considerate in thought, word, and deed towards our brothers and sisters for whom Christ was crucified?   "Acting justly towards our neighbor is not simply a question of avoiding doing him or her any harm. Nor is it simply a matter of denouncing unjust situations as they crop up." Lamenting the evils in our world is useless if it does not motivate us to do something to remedy the situations that cause us to grieve. All Christians must ask themselves how they can put the virtue of justice into practice in their everyday lives. This naturally begins with prayer.   We all need one another; we can all help one another. We must keep the needs of others in mind, we must be capable of saying: cor meum vigilat, my heart is awake.   CCHD provides one avenue to assist those who need our attention, and help form a more just, a more human world. During my time at CCHD I have had the opportunity to meet many people in need in our diocese, good people who, often times due to circumstances out of their control, are now forced to humbly ask for help to live with the amenities that most of us take for granted.   I have tried to tell their stories and laud the efforts of our current grant recipients who have been working to improve the lives of the poor in our diocese in the following pages. I encourage you to be generous in the CCHD collection on November 21st; your donations ensure that CCHD will continue to work diligently for justice on a local level.

      The Aids conference currently under way in Bangkok, Thailand has once again turned into a forum for the world to criticize the United States.  Despite the fact that the US has spent twice as much as other donor nations combined (we have pledged $15 billion), world leaders, actors like Richard Gere and United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan have stepped up the criticism.  They are accusing the United States of ignoring the plight of Aids victims while focusing too much attention on the war on terrorism.  Addressing the conference, Richard Gere said “There is a vicious terrorist out there and it’s not Osama bin Laden, it’s Aids.”  He went on to say that Aids is the most fundamental threat to our happiness and livelihood.  His comments are so absurd that they need no further elaboration.  Kofi Annan, in a veiled criticism of the United States implied that our enthusiasm in fighting the war against terrorism is disproportionate to our desire to fight Aids and suggested we could do more.  Convinced that the United States’ policy is driven by “neo-conservative” ideologues, few at the conference seem willing to even consider the effectiveness of an abstinence program.   urlLink    Protesters in Thailand Demonstrate Against Bush&nbsp; urlLink     The policy of President Bush has been to promote abstinence programs throughout the world, rather than relying solely on “safe-sex” and condoms.  Interestingly enough, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has supported the Bush policy, and as a result has become a target of criticism.  His country is a rare example of a success story in Africa, a continent ravaged by Aids.  By enforcing abstinence programs, his country has seen a drop in Aids infections.  Those supporting condoms as the only way to prevent Aids seem to think that abstinence is cruel and unusual punishment.  Asking people to wait until marriage before having sex is unrealistic, according to the critics of the Bush policy.  This reaction ought not be surprising. In our sex-absorbed culture, it seems inconceivable for some to even contemplate abstinence.  But the question must be asked; what is really going to solve the Aids problem?  The only way to ensure that Aids will not be transmitted is by not having sex and not taking drugs.  It seems so obvious, so why all the confusion?  As usual, the Left has a quick fix for a serious, deep seeded moral problem that they refuse to recognize. Their message is the equivalent of saying; “play with this loaded gun, just be safe”.  Refusing to address the root cause of the Aids epidemic, they look for simplistic solutions to a moral crisis.  Since their understanding of sex is not rooted within any moral context of procreation, love, family and responsibility, they cannot be expected to see the moral roots of the Aids crisis.  Abstinence programs, on the contrary, encourage a responsible and humane understanding of sex; that is, sex within the context of the married life is the only authentic purpose for human sexuality.  Abstinence attacks the root of the problem, addressing the moral implications of sexuality.  The source of the anger toward the president results from President Bush's refusal to use the bully pulpit as a spring board for the homosexual agenda.  While Bush certainly wants to find a cure for Aids, he will not use his office as a propaganda machine for the homosexual movement in this country.  I’m afraid that the criticism of the United States in Thailand is yet another example of the “blame America first” movement and has more to do with ideology that with fact.

      The recently released, bipartisan 9/11 report confirms much of what the President has been saying since the immediate aftermath of the attacks. The report confirms that we are engaged in an epic battle against the forces of radical Islamic terrorism. Despite the relentless criticism being unleashed on President Bush by Michael Moore’s "documentary" Fahrenheit 9/11 and other "expert" media talking heads, Bush has once again been vindicated. Many of Moore’s accusations are put down in the report, for example, that there existed a Bush-Saudi connection prior to 9/11. It’s simply a fact that we have not been hit with an attack since the events of 9/11, and that is a success story. Clearly, the steps this administration has undertaken since 9/11 have prevented further attacks. The Patriot Act, much scorned by the Left, has been remarkably effective in identifying potential terrorists and terrorist cells within our borders. Despite cries of civil rights violations, not one case of abuse has been proven accurate. The commission report says, "Although we are safer, we are still not safe". The report does levy some criticism of both the Clinton and Bush Administrations. The fact remains that Clinton was in office for eight years while Bush was only in for 8 months. Nonetheless, we must look forward and act to ensure we do all we can to prevent another 9/11.   The policies of this administration have shown terrorists that their actions will not go unnoticed or unpunished. While some claim that the Iraq war has actually increased terrorism, or the likelihood of a terrorist act, I believe the opposite is true. According to the president, the former regime in Iraq was a gathering threat to the United States. President Bush never used the term "immediate". His goal was to address the threat before it became an imminent one. This is a vital component of his doctrine of preemption. We can no longer wait to see a threat gather, because then it may be too late.&nbsp; The alternative, to wait while&nbsp;rouge nations build up&nbsp;illegal arsenals, or while&nbsp;terrorist cells organize under the watchful eye of such nations&nbsp;would be dangerously&nbsp;irresponsible.&nbsp;The fact that Libya has since voluntarily opened up to the world and no longer seeks illegal weapons can be seen as a positive&nbsp;effect of the war in Iraq. Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have also stepped up their efforts at rooting out al-Qaeda cells&nbsp;within their borders. Certainly, there remains much to be desired, in terms of major societal reform of many Muslim countries, but I believe that important first steps have been taken. These countries know that the United States is serious when it pressures them to seek out terrorists in their countries. In addition to rooting out terrorists through force, Muslim leaders must reform their education system, which regularly indoctrinates young, poor students to hate Christians and Jews. This is a serious problem in Wahhibi-dominated Saudi Arabia and in the poor, rural areas of Pakistan. The war against terrorism is a multi-pronged effort, which will inevitably involve dangerous battles as seen in Iraq.&nbsp; We need&nbsp;strong leaders like President Bush who will make the difficult decision to go to war if necessary when the security of&nbsp;our&nbsp;people is at&nbsp;stake.&nbsp; Preemption is a vital element of the Bush Doctrine in 21st century warfare.&nbsp;As important as the physical battle is the evolution of Islam itself to face modernity and Western civilization.&nbsp; Islam must do an&nbsp;examination&nbsp;of conscience and realize that if it is to remaim a relevant religion in the&nbsp;21st century, it must face&nbsp;down those within its fold who seek to turn it into a religion of terror.&nbsp;This will involve religious leaders uniting to condemn, without qualification, violence in the name of religion.

      The release this past weekend of the latest letter from the Vatican entitled, On the Collaboration of Men and Women in the Church and in the World, presents us with another opportunity to explore the Holy Father’s understanding of the human person.  In particular, we could focus on his thoughts regarding man and woman and their relationship to one another, otherwise known as the theology of the body.  I’m hardly an expert on the theology of the body, but I am at least a little bit aware of its potential impact on the world. I believe it was George Weigel who said that the theology of the body is a “theological time bomb”.  It is widely believed within Catholic circles that at some point down the road, not too far away, this rich collection of reflections on the meaning of human sexuality will be embraced by a culture desperate for meaning.  There are still a surprising number of people who are unaware of the Pope’s contribution to the understanding of human sexuality and marriage.  Fortunately, individuals like Christopher West have begun “unpacking” this complex yet monumental vision. He has a great website with salient, thought provoking articles perfect for those interested in exploring the Holy Father’s vision in-depth. www.christopherwest.com  In a beautiful way, the Holy Father ties together the marital act of a husband and wife to the mystery of Christ’s relationship to the Church.  By discovering the connection between marriage and Christ’s betrothal to his Church, the meaning of our entire life is illuminated and enriched.  The “gift” of husband to wife is physically embodied within the sex act.  In giving oneself completely to the other, each finds total fulfillment.  The union is so perfect that it is life giving.  Man and women become co-creators with the Almighty in the creation of new life.  The union of bodies within the marital act is meant to parallel Christ’s eternal union to the Church.  The life giving union of marriage is also a reflection of the most perfect union found within the Blessed Trinity, the Holy Spirit proceeding from the reciprocal love between the Father and the Son.  The beauty of the theology of the body is in its “incarnational” character.  The Divine life of God is brought down to earth in Jesus Christ.  In the Person of Christ, God and humanity are intimately and eternally united.  Thus the most intimate and beautiful of human acts, the gift of self between husband and wife, can be directly linked to the mystery of God.  Time will tell what impact the theology of the body will have on our culture.  More likely than not, after the so-called sexual revolution of the 1960s, men and women will be hungry for an understanding of sexuality worthy of their dignity as created in the image of God.  As the Church has predicted, sex outside the framework of marital love or perverted via contraceptives will only lead to self-alienation and conflict between the sexes.  On the contrary, sex understood as a self-giving and unrestricted act leads to self-fulfillment and a deepening of love between husband and wife.    urlLink    The Creation  urlLink

      As the arguments over whether it is permissible to vote for a pro-abortion candidate rages on, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger has been quoted by the U.S. Bishops in a way that seems to allow for Catholics to have more voting freedom.  Cardinal Theodore McCarrick has said that Ratzinger feels that,  "A Catholic would be guilty of formal cooperation in evil, and so unworthy to present himself for Holy Communion, if he were to deliberately vote for a candidate precisely because of the candidate's permissive stand on abortion and/or euthanasia. When a Catholic does not share a candidate's stand in favor of abortion and/or euthanasia, but votes for that candidate for other reasons, it is considerredremote material cooperation, which can be permitted in the presence of proportionate reasons."  Many liberal mouthpieces, such as Andrew Greeley, have run with this statement claiming that this implies that Catholics are free to vote for whomever they choose, including John Kerry, if they find other reasons to do so.  In his July 16 article in the Chicago Sun-Times Greeley shows his true colors by making a cheap stab at the Bishops who have defended the Eucharist by stating that, "The few bishops who excluded Catholics from communion if they voted for Kerry didn't know much traditional moral theology."  Individuals like Greeley are entirely political and have no desire to educate the laity. In the same article Greeley then suggests that the bishops could better act as beacons of light if they would "more noisily oppose the Iraq war and suggest that Catholic politicians who support the death penalty are not following the teachings of the Church. "  By simple consideration of the numbers anyone can see that abortion is taking more lives than capitol punishment and while we cannot forget about capitol punishment, abortion is clearly the dominant issue of our day.  However, it's worth analyzing whether Ratzingter's alleged point is truly applicable, or just ammunition for more useless palaver. The question is: What are proportionate reasons? How often do they exist? Are we really faced with such a situation now? Despite Kerry's liberal positions on life issues are his other beliefs enough to render Catholic support of his campaign "indirect material cooperation?"  Allow me to quicky opine . . . I virulently reply "No!" Simply research his incomprehensible voting record. I could continue but would rather leave it to everyone else to discuss.  What are "proportionate reasons?" Many American Catholics are now using this arguement to support a number of questionable politicians.  Could they be right?

      We’re all aware of this memorable phrase by Thomas Jefferson. We hear it repeatedly from the ACLU and other opponents of Church “interference” in state matters.  Although the words “separation of church and state” never appear in the first amendment, they might as well be there now.  So engrained is this idea on our national conscience that even the pledge of allegiance has come under attack, in addition, prayer at high school football games and within the classroom.  Religion, in a certain sense has become enemy number one of activist judges.  It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to state that religion has come under attack in America.  Even though the majority of Americans consider themselves religious, the elite of this country, once again proving that they know better than we do, are attempting to erase the important role religion played in our nation’s founding.  Quote after quote can be pulled from the dialogues of the founding era affirming the benefits, even necessity, of religion and morality in public life.  Washington himself went so far in his Farewell Address to say that these two pillars are fundamental components of a successful republic.  Even Jefferson, probably the least “religious” of the founding generation, doubted that a state could function without Christianity.  De Tocqueville marveled at the religiosity of the American citizen.  Not being able to deny the prominent role religion occupied in the founding, attempts are now being made to dismiss religion in the founding era as “cultural” or “historical” conditioning.  “That was then, this is now.”   The idea that religious-inspired values and morals ought to remain outside the public debate would have sounded completely foreign to the founders.  While they affirmed reason’s ability to reach certain truths, they were doubtful that over time, reason alone would prove sufficient in guiding man along the path of moral truth.  As we all know, the only intent of the first amendment was to prohibit Congress from establishing a national religion and to ensure the freedom to worship as one pleases.  Today however, we have what Father Neuhaus calls the “naked public square.”  President Bush is accused of being a zealot, leading this country on his religious convictions rather than national interest.  The courts, which were intended by the founders to be the weakest branch of government, have arguably become the most powerful.  As we have discussed, politicians opposed to abortion are accused of “imposing” their religion on the electorate.  Bishops who speak out against abortion and warn politicians who support it are likewise criticized. The important social issues of the day such as life, marriage and the family, etc., are influenced more by the secular creed than any religious one.  What is the remedy for such hostility toward religion in public life?  How can we reclaim our nation’s appreciation for religion in the public square?
