      Alton Brown will be at the orange county fair on Thurs, July 29 at 5:30PM. I will also have to find a way to be there. I think i may have a convienent 3:30 doctors appointment that day.  They couldn't possibly have picked a stupider time to schedule him. oh well, it'll be worth it.  anyone else want to come?

      This weekend on "While You Were Out," instead of paying the money for stained glass they decided to make something that would look similar. they took some sort of acetate, lined up gummy bears in an attractive pattern and melted them in the microwave. Now it was unclear how they enclosed these now melted gummy bears, but somehow they added another sheet of acetate, bent it into a half cylinder and made 2 wall mounted lamps out of it.  It was definitely cool, because it's not my house. I hope those people don't have ants.

      I don't understand.   I've been doing a lot of faxing lately and maybe that will be a separate post, but since I've been standing by the fax machines I've had lots of time to go through the box that they put resumes in. Currently there are  only 5 resumes/cover letters in the box but they all have very, very basic grammar errors. I don't understand why they couldn't just press spell check, or grammar check. Because it would have caught these problems.   Meanwhile my resume is pristine, clear and simple. I don't use big words for the sake of using big words (like 2:5 of the resumes). Everything is spelled correctly. When I write my cover letters I never say crap like "Please call me so we can discuss how my capabilities can be applied to the realization of your companys goals" [yes, company plural, not company posessive]  Am I doing something wrong? Should I make major grammar errors. Should I be wordy and vague? Should I sound like a person who has never written anything in my life and make it seem doubtful that 7:10 times I can form complete thoughts into complete sentences?  I am very glad I am going back to school. And maybe in a year I'll quit working and do it full time. Because one thing is obvious. I need to be in a supervising and hiring position. And if people call to inquire about  resumes they sent that weren't up to my standards then I will tell them that we don't hire people who have more than 2 errors in their resume and maybe they should think about having someone proof read it for them.  I don't understand why I can't get a better job if this is the caliber of people out there. Is it because I refuse to use buzzwords?  I'm going to hang out by the fax and wait for more resumes, and memorize these people's names. If they get hired, I may just have to quit.  p.s. I'm well aware that my blog is nowhere near perfect gramatically, and most of the time i can't be bothered to use capital letters. It is NOT a resume though, and the only job it will find me is when I become famous and they publish it as a book.

      I finally did it. I was a little too hasty with my spring rolls and I finally got a small burn on my wrist from the 350 degree oil. Oh well, it's hardly noticeable and I'm hardly dying. It was totally my fault, no fault of the deep fryer, except for having the most useless basket in the history of deep fryers.  The spring rolls were great though, and a steal at $.99.

      The McDonald's neopets promotion is now over. I'm sad because I still need 5 more. I'm happy because I can stop eating the food.  I've pretty much given in and decided that I've been totally screwed by the lady on ebay and i've lost my $28. And I will never see those neopets i ordered. So, yesterday (thurs) I made a last ditch effort to collect the neopets the old fashioned way. I went McDonald's yesterday. A new record for me. I went at lunch time to the wonderful one that gave me 2 unis last week. but alas, they were completely out of neopets. they did however try to offer me at least 4 different types of toys they had left over from previous promotions. I didn't even try going to the other one by my work, because they ran out of toys last week. I considered going to the one in the mall, which i could have reasonably made it to and back without being more than 5 minutes late. But I went 2 hrs before closing on wednesday, and they only had wockys, and lots of them.  So, after work I headed to the McDonalds that I thought would be my heaven. And it turned out it was, on wednesday. Wednesday they opened their 2 "customer satisfaction" boxes that held some of all 16 toys. ALL 16!!! But yesterday they only had grundos. And, this is the ugly frog thing with antennas that I'd been avoiding the most. But, I bought it anyway.  Then I tried another McDonald's on my way home. This also proved useful, because I picked up a red yurble and a yellow quiggle. I also tried minute maid strawberry soda, which I highly do not recommend. uggh! I don't know if i didn't pay attention to every other mcdonalds i'd been to the the last month, but I'd never seen it before. And hope to never see again.  Then I got greedy, I thought I'd go a little out of my way to try the mcdonalds by el camino community college. I figured these were people desparate to prove to someone that they were grown up and legitimate. That mcdonalds would have plenty of toys left. But no, they were completely out. They did have some kind of cool wizard lego toys that i almost bought, but with 3 happy meals in my car already i decided against it.  I tried to ask people to buy their display of neopets in the plastic case (the promotion was over after all). But the only one who had a reasonable, informed answer told me that they couldn't sell those toys. The give them to the workers after the promotion is over. I should have totally gotten a part time job at mcdonalds. I bet i'd really like making egg mcmuffins.  I need 5 more neopets, and I guess I'll end up buying them individually on ebay. Unless anyone has them to donate to my cause. Factoring in the techo that Stephanie is going to give me these are what I still need:  Aisha Blumaroo Moehog Lupe Shoyru  I don't feel so bad, I made a good show of trying to get them. The only one I had an opportunity to buy, but turned down because I thought i was getting it on ebay was the moehog.  p.s. I have an extra yellow ixi if it'll make anyone trade me for one that i need. I'm also considering listing my cloud scorchio on ebay. Last night one sold for $10.50 plus $3 s/h

      Malibu rum has new flavors. and a funny new radio commercial featuring rastafarians giving job advice.  The point is, the classic coconut-pineapple taste that you get from ordering malibu and pineapple. can now be acheived, with much less liquid by having a stiff drink of malibu coconut and malibu pineapple. they also have malibu mango, and i'm not quite sure the world is ready for mango rum. i know they've been increasing in popularity ever since that 1996 win in the pilsbury bake-off. but, i just don't know.  now, a few years i swore off alcohols in the 40 proof range. this meant goodbye girly things like midori and malibu. then i realized you could get most of the taste more of a kick when you just added some vodka. silly me for taking so long to realize that. even the stupid beauty bar knew that, you can get malibu, vodka and a splash of pineapple juice served in a martini glass and a crappy manicure for $10, plus tip. for a better $10 martini and manicure i recommend the lighthouse cafe in hermosa beach on wednesdays.  so here's my new drink idea--not that it's all that new or different.  1 part malibu coconut 1 part malibu pineapple langers coconut-pineapple juice to taste  this from the person who wouldn't buy a bottle of tequila because i would never finish it, now is relying on owning 2 flavored rums. maybe when i open the school themed bar....

       urlLink Berkeley legalizing prostitution?   Obviously they can't legalize it, because they're just some dumb city. But they can decriminalize it, i guess. Maybe those massage parlors will open again. And, any poor kid who somehow ends up on a web cam having sex with a prostitute will only have to be embarassed, and not worry about legal action against him. And that gay purple teletubby will not only be welcomed openly by the city council, he can have a prostitute while he's visiting too.  An open letter to the Berkeley city council.  Seriously, city council. I don't know why you would decline to comment on legalizing prostitution, you do so much other crap. Afraid you'll all finally be ousted for pissing off too many people? We know your opinions on teletubbies, and we know you hate students, renters. What about prostitutes? I need to know, so i can form the opposite opinion.  I don't care anymore. I'm never going to live in Berkeley again. But really, do something useful for a change. Stop bitching about how the University takes over your precious little hippie hovel and realize that without the University you might not even have a hovel. And that thing about not being able to "own" pets. Pure crap. Maybe I should come steal your dog. Since you don't own him, it's not really stealing, is it? Work on apartment buildings near campus, bring in some corporate money to help. You know what also would be helpful, allowing businesses to stay open past 6pm without a special permit. Focus on things you can change, not the things you can't. And remember that law about sitting on the sidewalk? Don't do any more crap like that. You're as useless as the ASUC, but older, so you should know better.  If you stop debating useless and stupid things, you'll probably have more time on your hands than you know what to do with. Let me offer you a suggestion: Instead of debating, and passing bills and such post your dumbass ideas on a blog. It will take up your time, you'll still allow people to hear your useless ideas, and it will improve your typing speed. Believe me, this blog thing works to relieve your boredom.  p.s. I just heard about  urlLink w ketchup,  you may want to purchase some so you can debate it and declare it evil. If you do, can I please buy a bottle off of you? It only makes sense to buy in bulk, and I don't eat very much ketchup.    wow, i must be really bored today.

      What's wrong with me? I'm posting about video games. I bet you all never thought you'd see the day.  My sister somehow convinced my dad to fish our old atari computer out of the garage, because she thought it would be fun. I don't know the the exact model off hand, but this thing is a good 20 years old. And because we had this, we never got a nintendo, therefore not exposing me to loads of pop culture that would have proven useful for me in the future.  and then i read  urlLink this  this on yahoo news today.  I haven't spent much time with the new/old toy yet. But, so far, IT'S B-O-R-I-N-G yet oddly time consuming. You think i'd just stop when it's not fun anymore, but i just keep waiting for it to get good. For a person who spends no time playing video games, you'd think they would be a bit harder. and maybe less boring. at least the music is good.   i have yet to play the classics like pac man, donkey kong, q-bert, dig-dug and pong. but if the games i have played, including popeye, frogger and food fight, are any indication, i should just sell the whole thing on ebay.  i guess video games are not for me. the new ones are too hard, and the old ones are too boring.  classic games convention. whatever!

      Thanks to this Sunday's LA Times Magazine I now have a huge list of restaruants that sound good, but are too much trouble to go to, and also, are not inviting to the un-celebrity likes of me. And I like to think that being a girl, who on occasion can flaunt my sexuality to get me things would help me in these situations. But, this is LA and there are already a gazillion other girls, who are blonder and surgically enhanced trying to do the same thing.  Luckily, for me this drink is fully explained and pictured:   The libation is called You're a Pepper Too, and it  is  just the thing of you've had the daylights slapped out of you for no reason. You get an 8-ounce bottle of the original Dublin Dr Pepper, along with two sidecars, one with Absolut Vanilla and the other with Monin brand organic vanilla syrup. And there's Dr Pepper Jelly Bellies to boot. Not approved for sniffling first-graders, but quite and attitude adjuster nonetheless.   In the picture it's served with an adorable giraffe swizzle stick. It looks fantastic. And with the non-celebrity substitutions of regular dr pepper, and torani vanilla syrup, you'll have quite the cocktail.  On a side note, I don't drink enough. It's not really worth it for me to buy entire bottles of alcohol, because they'll never get finished. I have half a bottle of absolut that i opened a year ago. I need lydia back, we encourage eachother to drink well.

      It's been a while since i've had a frying update. Maybe next week i'll have something good to post, but for now:  trader joe's frozen crab cakes = delicious especially when served on a bed of cheddar mashed potatos (not deep fried)  also, I finally fried the last of these frozen hash brown patties that my dad accidentaly bought. they were completely raw, unlike the delicious pre-browned kind found in every supermarket and trader joes. Don't ever buy the completely raw kind. they're just not good.

      This weekend, trying hard not to be "LA," but failing miserably, I gussied myself up and took a trip to the Beverly Center. Now, the Beverly center, for those of you who don't know or have forgotten, is disappointingly far from the freeway. This is a very bad trait in locations, and usually keeps me from them. But, Beth was driving, so I was fine. We managed to get there, finally, purchased a few sale items and made our way up to the food court where we were going to the A&W restaurant to get a root beer shake. Now, the A&W store is a magical place. I'd never seen one before the first time I went to the beverly center, and since then I've seen them attached to Kentucky Fried Chicken establishments, but never stand alone. And, nowhere besides the beverly center did they have milkshakes. Root beer floats, yes. But not a milkshake in sight, not even the regular flavors. And let me say, as strange as it sounds, the root beer milkshake may be the best milkshake I've ever had. And, I've had a milkshake or two in my day. This is made with some kind of root beer flavored syrup.  So, we make our way up the escalator toward the food court, look around, look around again, and alas, there is no A&W in sight. Now I will never have a root beer milkshake ever again. And that makes me very sad.  Also, failing to not be LA, we stopped by Fred Segal, where someone on ebay said they carry a line called "Barbie Vintage" and I wanted to try on a shirt, to make sure it wasn't too small for me, the way this size Large Barbie  tanktop is at Hot Topic. Of course there's no Barbie in sight. There is however, a large pile of "disney vintage" shirts.  Also, in the disappointments category, no neopets yet. And I got an email from some freak who contacted me because he saw that I won an auction by the seller, and he won an auction and hasn't gotten his thing yet. I spent $28, and if i don't get my neopets, drastic measures may need to be taken. I have the mailing address, and I recieved an email confirmation that my payment was recieved, so the address is valid. Now may be the time to start plotting revenge. You all can help.  so, right now i'm a good 700 calories lighter from not having a milkshake, and pissed off about ebay. Of course, that will all change when i find a set of high numbered baby-sitters club books selling for a low price.

      i don't really like competiting myself. can you think of a more non-competitive profession than librarian? But competition is fantastic. Especially watching it on tv, or reading about it in the new book i'm reading called  Cook Off- Recipe Fever in America  by Amy Sutherland. Apparently cook offs are quintessentially American. And I'm pretty darn quintessentially American (in the good sort of way). Really, if we can think of something, we can think of a way to make it competitive.  Sit me down in front of the tv watching iron chef, junk-yard wars, animal face off, trading spaces, the pilsbury bake off, food festivals etc and i'm set. people who are good at what they do make me happy. and watching them fight to the death (or for a new stove) is even better. And that word freak book about competitive scrabble. I love the crazies!

      The McDonald's i went to yesterday has pictures of its charity projects on the wall and stuff. it's a little odd. but this little kid probably under 4 yrs old points at some old picture of someone and Sam the 1984 olympic eagle, and asks "who's that". and with only a very short pause the mom answered back correctly that it was sam the eagle. I thought for sure that she wouldn't know. She looked like the dumb type. Obviously she wasn't smart or she wouldn't be feeding her kids such food at such a young age. then I tried to figure out how i knew the answer was sam the eagle. i have no memories of the 1984 olympics. certainly, the olympics are boring now, they must have been horribly boring for my four year old self. and i don't know any olympic mascots since then. i'm confused. was sam super popular, or is it just an la thing? i just used the phrase "la thing". arrgh!

      So apparently torrance elementary schools got out at lunch time today. and all the children converged on the local McDonald's establishments. I was not aware that this would happen today.  First I went to the one on crenshaw and skypark (by the crossroads) and was jarred as I walked into a room full of children playing with their quiggles. there must have been at least 30 of them. and i went to the counter to ask what toys they had and the lady showed me a grimace driving a car and said that was the only thing they had. i'm not blind! i saw the quiggles! not that i wanted a quiggle, but the neopet promotion doesn't end for an entire week. apparently all of those horrible children had got the last of the neopets. i hardly believe that, but we'll see. I needed a short pep talk from lydia at this point, but continuted on my way. I'm debating writing to McDonalds about this. It got lydia a white ixi.  I finally got to the McDonald's on PCH just off of Hawthorne where they have a small room for kids and video games, so it kept the main part of the place less kid dense. And i saw a few kids with grundos, but I decided to wait in the relatively long line because I couldn't believe my luck could be that bad. And it wasn't. First, my order was taken by the nicest Japanese boy I'd ever seen at a McDonald's. He was well groomed, friendly and generally helpful and good at  his job.  And he had unis! I got a red and a yellow. and lydia promised me her blue. that means i'll have all the primary colors, and I can breed them into secondary colors!! (okay, maybe it doesn't quite work that way)  The lovely Japanese order taker, gave me the unis. The order filler people also gave me two grundos. I was in such a good mood that I was honest and gave them back. Besides, no one likes the grundo.  Now I can finally stop going to McDonalds. I'm going to get that set from ebay, eventually. And, I have doubles of all the ones I want doubles of, except maybe the aisha. But, it may be too late for that.  Two happy meals is more food than I realized. It's too bad I forgot to get apples instead of fries in one of them.

      It's been exactly a week since I won my neopets auction. And It's been exactly a week since I've heard anything from the girl who has the toys. And she hasn't left me feedback. Will I get my neopets, ever? This I can't blame on the former president.  Meanwhile, while on ebay I checked out the auctions for the complete set of 109 neopets toys:  the ronald mcdonald house made $1,715.00 and the neopet charity made $1,225.00  that's $15.73 per toy. if you go to a cheap mcdonalds you could get 7 happy meals for that price. not too shabby for some cheap marketing toys.   give me 5 years. then I should be able to competitively bid on things like this.

      Seriously, I do not get paid enough, really, to make me want to answer the phone from non-mafia people. When there's a chance the Nigerian mafia is calling there's no way in hell I'm picking up the phone. I don't care what my boss says. So I smile, and I nod and let her go to lunch confident in the fact that if Claudio from Chile calls or Mike from Scotland calls that I'll answer. They can leave a message, they're nice guys, and will completely understand that I'm not answering the phone because I want to live.  I only like the Al Capone type mob, or maybe Sonny from General Hospital. But Nigeria, there's no glamour there!  Now to explain myself: One of our sales reps got a lead from this shady guy in Nigeria. We're pretty sure it's a money laundering scheme because we quote them absolutely ridiculous prices and they're willing to pay without even trying to bargain. We ended up saying that we can't sell to Nigeria, but this guy keeps calling.  I so do not get paid enough.

      Since my internet connection is down, and posting to this blog was supposed to be my new hobby, i think it might be time to tell you all about my sunburn. WARNING: this may be more info than you need to know.   the guys at victoria's secret are marketing geniuses. and they have a line of bathing suits. i got the best one of the lot. just the bottom, because i'm still not comfortable with those ridiculous pieces of triangle fabric that they consider a top. and it's black, with magenta trim. AND... a heart cut out on the butt. Genius! it allows you to give in to their marketing campaign and wear a  skimpy bikini with major VS sex appeal and feel like tyra banks. Yet, you can still aspire to be good and cheerful and all that's right with the world, like a care bear.  I think I will be victoria's secret bear. I laid out for an hour on sunday, completely covered except the heart on my butt. It's friday and my heart is still pink as ever. I really have to admit that my ass is adorable. I didn't have much of a strong opinion about my butt before. But now that I'm practically a care bear, it's great. Also, I want to spread joy throughout the land. It's a good thing I don't know any care bears songs, because I would be singing them. It's also good that I've been taking belly dancing, because I bet it'll help with my care bear stare.

      Now, I like Ronald Reagan as much as the next person. Maybe more, because of my elementary school brainwashing. He was my first president and I've had nothing but good feelings toward him, because I was 0-8 when he was in office and not exactly capable of analyzing his attitudes and policies. I just knew what I learned in school about civic duty and all that. The president was an good, important man. And, It's very sad that he had alzheimers, and it's sad that he died. But we don't need to have a federal holiday! Some things transcend people and should carry on as scheduled, like mail!!!  Mail is often the highlight of my day. I get catalogs featuring necessities like leg lamps, and postcards and sale ads from Joann's promising me 40% off any single regular priced item. I even get a few bills, but they don't mar my enjoyment of mail, especially when you've ordered something online and are waiting for it... like neopets! I mailed off the money order to a girl in irvine yesterday. That means, she could have potentially recieved it today, potentially mailed off the neopets today and I could potentially have them tomorrow. But no, the ex president had to go and die, and they had to shut down the government. And I won't have my neopets until Monday at the very earliest, but probably tuesday or wednesday. Now, based on what I know about my first president, which is deplorably little, I'm sure that he would want me to have neopets. He was a regular guy with a little longing for the cowboy live he loved so much in movies. And I think he'd understand, and encourage the neopets to get to me quicker. So, when I die, I want the mail to continue. Also, it'd be really cool if I could still have mail but close down all the schools. Because I understand, I want people to get the day off to sit by their mailboxes waiting for their packages.  In the meantime, I'll see you at McDonalds.

      from yahoo/AP  KORNEUBURG, Austria - Here comes the bride, and there goes her veil — all 1.7 miles of it. Eva Hofbauer went to her wedding on Wednesday claiming to be wearing the longest bridal veil in the world, the Austria Press Agency reported.       Her groom could only watch, robbed of any attention, as Hofbauer was assisted by hundreds of young people who carried the veil into the church in Korneuburg, a town on the Danube River just northwest of Vienna.    Mayor Wolfgang Peterl said he hoped the veil would earn a place in the Guinness Book of Records. The previous record-holder was said to be a Japanese bride whose veil was 1.2 miles long.

      what if you took a twinkie and injected it with nutella...  and then deep fried it...  also, i went to the jelly belly website to see if they had anything to say about Ronald Reagan. They did. But this is much more interesting.  http://jellybelly.com/Cultures/en-US/NewsEvents/NewsStories/Wedding+Beans.htm  somehow i think i'll manage to have a jelly bean free wedding. although i'm not promising anything to the kind people who have said i could plan their wedding on the TLC show.

      so, i'm trying to stop being crazy about the whole neopet happy meal thing, but things like this make it very, very hard.   urlLink http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=5902391736   my tuition for next year is just over $600 per class. I can assuredly say that i want to go to library school more than i want 109 neopets. i think.   urlLink http://www.neopetsfoundation.org/   do you think they need someone to wear the chia costume?  the 20 minutes later update:  i bought the set of 16 neopets on ebay for $28 (free shipping). That's $2 cheaper than the buy it now price. At the 44 second mark it was only 23.50. darn those last second ebay people! but now i can relax a little, and stop forcing myself to eat happy meals. thank goodness that next months promotion is going to be awful and i can stop buying them then.

      What I'm reading now:   I want that! How we all became shoppers  by Thomas Hine  From the front cover:  Shopping has a lot in common with sex. Just about everybody does it. Some people brag about how well they do it. Some keep it a secret. Most people worry, at least a little, about whether they do it right. And both provide ample opportunities to make foolish choices _______________  You don't  need  Barbie. You do need water, but you don't need bottled water. Nobody needs a ceramic sculpture of mother and daughter hippopotamuses, but at under eight dollars, few would label it a luxury. -Page 16  ___________________  One study revealed tha tif you put mena nd women on treadmills the man will walk faster. But if you put the same couple in a mall, the woman will walk faster. Women feel that they are accomplishing something when they shop. Men don't. -Page 27  *****************  Books I returned to the library yesterday.  *The ultimate brownie book : thousands of ways to make America's  favorite treat, including blondies, frostings, and doctored brownie mixes Weinstein, Bruce, 1960-   I made cormeal brownies--surprisingly good--  and I made S'mores brownies-- slightly disappointing   *Salt : a world history Kurlansky, Mark.

      also on the apple cider kick:  mix 3 parts apple cider (trader joe's  brand of course) and 1 part butterscotch schnapps. it may be the best drink ever. Not particularly alcoholic, but delicious.  I haven't tried it, but i bet if you add in some vodka it will be legitimately alcoholic. or i wonder how spiced rum would work. hmmm....

      Hello, welcome.  Just though I'd let you all know the best donut recipe ever. I stole it from someplace online. I used trader joe's apple cider. I think that makes the difference. Don't be fooled by the baked apple cider donut recipe that's floating around. If it's baked it's a small cake, not a donut!  Vermont Apple Cider Doughnuts  1 cup apple cider 1 cup sugar 1/4 cup solid vegetable shortening 2 large eggs 1/2 cup buttermilk 3 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 2 teaspoonbaking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg vegetable oil or shortening for frying  2 cups confectioners' sugar 1/4 cup apple cider  Boil apple cider in small saucepan until it is reduced to 1/4 cup, 8 to 10 minutes; cool.  Beat sugar with shortening until smooth. Add eggs and mix well, then add buttermilk and reduced cider. Stir together flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt and nutmeg in another bowl. Add to liquid ingredients; mix just enough to combine.  Transfer dough to lightly floured board and pat to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut with 2 1/2- to 3-inch doughnut cutter; reserve doughnut holes and reroll and cut scraps.  Add enough oil or shortening to fill a deep pan 3 inches; heat to 375'F. Fry several doughnuts at a time, turning once or twice, until browned and cooked through, about 4 minutes. Remove to paper towels with slotted spoon.  For glaze, mix confectioners' sugar and cider. Dip doughnuts while warm; serve warm

      Oh my gosh, I can die happy now.  I took off work yesterday and headed 30 miles south to the orange county fair. I've been to the fair probably over 10 times. and this was definitely the best one ever. quite possibly in the entire history of the fair.  before we even got in the gates some nice old couple gave the 4 of us 2 free tickets, so we got in for half price, a fantastic way to start a fantastic evening. i was sure it was my good karma from bringing 3 people who had never been to the fair.  we got in, took some pictures in front of retarded grape signs and headed off to eat some australian battered potatoes... the thing about the fair is that it changes enough to be interesting, but everything is always the same. and even though i hadn't been for an entire year i knew exactly where the potato shack was. the potatos are basically why i go every year, they've been a favorite of mine since before i realized that deep frying is the best method of cooking ever. and i got to share my potatos.  on our way to the potatos we passed by a curious sign though. it was the kind they have in department stores with a metal frame that holds a small poster sized piece of cardboard advertising sales, or in the case of robinsons-may it holds the picture of the store manager. this sign however, and the 5 others we saw, informed us that if we wanted to come back friday we could meet the great Arnold, governor of this lovely state. I of course made my usual 10 second tirade about how he should be fixing the budget and letting kids go to college instead of hanging out and eating potatos. and then quickly forgot about him because there was only one man on my mind, and boy is he a man.  I am more in love with Alton Brown now than I was 24 hrs ago. If only he wasn't married.  We passed by the stage that Alton was going to be at when we got there at like 3:30-4:00, there was some band singing oldies songs, i thought there were suspiciously a lot of people there for that show. but i never would have guessed they were waiting for Alton. Then we ate our potatos, looked through the children's room and came back out to see mobs of people around the stage 50 minutes before his scheduled time of 5:30. So i let my friends go have fun, and i set out to find myself a vantage point. no amount of $1 rides (before 6 on thurs) or corndogs was going to make up for me not being able to see alton. and after unsuccessfully looking for an actual seat (you'd think one person would be able to squeeze in somewhere) i found the best spot ever. it took a little while, and a little squeezing in where someone a few inches taller wouldn't have dared. but i managed to make my way to the corner of the stage behind a little old lady who was shorter than me, and some  35ish lady who was definitely legal midget status, although she was porportioned like a regular person. Then half way though the show the little old lady had enough, and i got her spot at the stage!! i was so ready to die happy.  So, after standing in my cramped bit of space for 45 mins, Alton comes out, and everyone forgets their troubles. Or at least i do. He comes out and takes a video of the whole crowd cheering with his camera phone and tells us all that in a week we should be on his website. Isn't he cute! oh yeah, you know how on tv he's always wearing a hawaiian shirt, or a bowling shirt to match his retro kitchen accessories. he wasn't. he was wearing a white shirt and a kilt. the boy was wearing a skirt. and i have to say that at one point he was close enough that i could have looked up his kilt, but i managed to stop myself. apparently it's something called a utilikilt  urlLink www.utilikilts.com . and they're popular with a certain crowd. When asked why he was wearing a kilt he said, "Because I have great legs," and indeed he does for someone who turns 42 today.  So he starts off with like a monologue, about him coming to the fair, and last year's fair (apparently he was here last year and i just didn't know) and he's being cute and charming, self-depricatingly funny and generally someone i definitley want to know, and have children with... and i was in heaven. then he starts making fun of people in the audience, they ugly stuffed dog on the floor, the guy with the mohawk, the lady with the fringy parasol. i totally puffed out my chest,  because i found the perfect use for my "talk nerdy to me shirt" (not that i really needed help, because the t-shirt for being so dumb fits me awfully well). but alas, he didn't notice me. but my friends made me feel better when i told them this later by saying, it was because he thought i was cute that he didn't make fun of me, and you don't make fun of people when you're staring at their chest. (unless you're the lady we passed who was wearing the hat that said "got tits," and yes she did.  then he started "cooking" there wasn't anything special. in fact, i wasn't really impressed at all. he had to use grapes, because the fair was grape themed. he did make a grape smoothie with frozen grapes, muscat wine and mint that i might try. but grape gazpacho, that's just retarded no matter if the man i love is making it or not. he got some kid volunteer to help him make the crust for his no-bake grape cobbler. it didn't look horrible, but it didn't look great. and this fat nerdy kid who wore a fanny pack with hand sanitizer dangling from the outside that alton made fun of was just in heaven. it was cute. then he picked some cute, very orange county type 35ish lady to help stir/melt some butter and brown sugar. he let her drink some of the grape smoothie, out of his glass! that's practically like kissing him! or so they say in carls jr commercials. anyway, she poured her mixture on top of his thing. then she held the pan while alton scraped out the last bits. and he called her a "limber vixen." that's like my fantasy. me and alton cooking together, he scrapes out the pan, he calls me a "limber vixen" and then we really go test out how limber i am. if i was on stage with him, i probably would have just melted. dropped the hot pan on my foot and had to go to the hospital where alton would come visit me and then we'd get married. his live show was even more fun than his tv show. for lots of reasons i'm sure. it was also a bit more raw. he made a lot of drinking jokes and was just a bit less polished and family friendly, nothing actually dirty though. there were kids. in fact one group had a sign that read "alton, you could out cook bobby flay in your sleep" he took the sign as a souvenir, then made a joke about if anyone had a sign for him that said that about a "mr. lagasse"  after his demo he had a Q&A. and there were Alton freaks like there are comic book/sci fi freaks. it was awesome. 2 of the nerdiest possibly guys were there asking very technical questions regarding one aspect of one show. unfortunately they weren't so attractive (the way you'd imagine), and meeting them would not have made a good alton substitute. anyway, like a good fan, i was carring his book around, hoping he would sign it. but apparently everyone else was too. the autograph line started in the back, and i was in the front. people were actually standing in the line while the show was happening. if i wanted to stand there for 3 hrs i probably could have had my book signed.  but i wasn't that crazy, i'd already wif he comes back next year, i'll know to stand in the line first, since i've already seen him up close. he comes out with a baking book in october. that is the most exciting news i've heard since i learned he'd be at the fair.  so after his thing was over i gave up on the autograph line and went to see the zebra, i didn't believe there was a zebra, but there was, and it wasn't just a painted stripey horse, it was a real zebra. the saddest zebra i'd ever seen, stuck in a cage in the petting zoo. petting zoos are for farm animals, goats, sheep, pigs, chickens... even alpacas, but not zebras. it was cool to see a zebra, but he made me sad. then i got a fried twinkie to try to east my sorrows, because a budwiser (fair sponsor) just wasn't going to cut it. and it was good. the first fried twinkie i've had. it was VERY lightly battered, and had a little strawberry jelly on top. it stopped tasting like a twinkie and  was more like a donut. the filling was all melty, and much better than the room temperature cream filling.  after this we went back, and the alton line hadn't gotten any shorter. so we got up close took a picture "with" him when he turned around and went on our way. i was able to drown my sorrows in a blue icee, because in southern california we're civilized and have lots of blue food to choose from.  Last night I dreamed of Alton. we were at the fair, at the same stage, but i was standing on the aisle in the back row. and he does that celebrity running thing where he's jogging by touching hands with everyone on the aisles. so he does that all the way down. and stops at me, and since i'm at the end he just starts talking to me and he's smart and charming and funny.... He's wearing his usual hawaiian shirt and pants. and that's pretty much the dream. I'm just giddy to be talking to him. ahhhhh.....  i realize now that i should have waited in the autograph line. i could have gotten him to sign my ass and then have it tattoed on. then i could be a care bear on one cheek and a cabbage patch kid on the other.  i'm still giddy. i was *this* close to Alton. yea! it was the best thing ever. like if zack were to get a swimming pool full of cane sugar dr. pepper while everyone else in the world had a glass full of mr. pibb.

      I don't know if anyone else has noticed, but there is a new car color on the market and it's metallic orange. My theory on car colors is that cars should be metallic. White, and black to a lesser extent are not good car colors because they don't shine in the sun. Metallic orange is really going too far though. My favorite color is dark gray. I've never called cars sexy before, but nice sleek dark gray cars really are.  It took me a while to decide my opinion on this orange color. In the beginning I saw far too few of them. But now, i've decided. It's the color of metallic vomit. There's a guy who works in my warehouse who drives one. How an 18 year old can afford a shiny new car I don't know. But maybe I should have bought him a pound of the vomit jelly bellys to match his car.

      Does south-northern calif. have something against blue?  I tried to buy a blue icee at bonfante gardens, there were 2 kiosks that sold strawberry and cherry. 2 red flavors, that never happens! and the strawberry icee is definitely the worst flavor ever. much worse than candy cane.   then i tried to buy a blue snow cone at the garlic festival. silly me assuming that the 2 most likely colors are red and blue. luckily they didn't try to sell me a garlic snow cone, and they had bubble-gum, but it was pink.  I think by signing some pact with the devil to give up flourescent blue food gilroy got the right to have more vanity license plates than should be in a small town.

      &nbsp; I didn’t get to fully experience the wonder of the Gilroy outlets because we wanted to try to get home at a reasonable hour. But I will tell you about the 2 shops I bought stuff in:  Jelly belly outlet: They had 3 different bags of belly flops. 2 were the boring fruit flavors and 1 was all garlic (uggh!) so I decided against them. They were also selling all the harry potter jelly beans in the individual containers the way they do at candy stores. You could buy a full pound or more of just vomit, or dirt or earwax. I thought about asking if anyone buys them when they’re not in a cute little harry potter box, but I thought I would be happier if I didn’t know the answer. I managed to escape the brightly colored wonderland only buying $3 worth of jelly beans. None of which involved harry potter or garlic.  Easy Spirit  Most of you know what ugly shoes I usually wear. Mostly sneakers every day at Berkeley. This is because I have very low tolerance for foot pain. I managed to find a new pair of sneakers I liked for only $40. I would have bought 2, but they only had one in my size. Also I bought a very comfortable pair of sandals that aren’t very attractive. But they’re starting to grow on me. They’re beige colored and look a lot better with the khakis I’m wearing today than they did at the store.  There was also an In-and-out. It may have been the fastest one I’ve ever been to.  &nbsp;Conclusion: insufficient data

      It was HOT at the garlic festival. Like 90 degrees with little shade. But that wasn’t really their fault. Also, there was a lot of traffic, but that wasn’t their fault either. It actually was surprisingly well run. You park in a huge lot and get shuttled to the fair entrance. The line for the shuttle was long, but went quickly. And the shuttle was a full on charter bus with plush seats and A/C. Not some rinky dink school bus.&nbsp; There were plenty of lines to buy tickets to get in, and I didn’t have to wait at all. The food lines looked long, but the booths were so well run that it didn’t take long at all. It was a miracle that such a well run fair could spring up in the middle of nowhere. But I guess they’ve had years of practice.  And the thing about the middle of nowhere is that people are friendly. Usually I’m suspicious of friendly, but since I had driven around enough to see just how isolated Gilroy is I could understand. They were all just happy not to have to look at the same 20 faces they see day in and day out. The guy who sold me the garlic shot glass seemed genuinely interested in where I was from and my trip to the bonfante gardens. I guess they get bored. Another thing to support this theory is that most people have super nice, new houses. But we passed this one run down shacky place that had 3 satellite dishes. They knew what was important tv, a connection to the outside world.  I tried the garlic ice cream, and surprisingly, it didn’t make me want to die. It wasn’t the worst thing I’ve ever tasted. It tasted like vanilla with a garlic after taste. Actually it wasn’t ice cream at all, it was soft serve. This seems like false advertising. Maybe I’ll get my own ice cream maker and try to make actual garlic ice cream.&nbsp; The garlic jelly bellys however, were quite awful.&nbsp; I was trying to figure out who I could buy a full bag of the garlic belly flops for. But I don’t hate anyone that much.  I ate a combination plate containing a garlic sausage, garlic mushrooms, garlic chicken pasta stir fry, garlic bread and garlic shrimp. I also tasted the calamari (surprisingly unbreaded and unfried), and pesto garlic pasta.&nbsp; Later we passed by the fried garlic bologna sandwich booth, I wasn’t hungry, but since I read about it in the paper I had to try it. I can’t tell if it was a disappointment because I didn’t like the bread, because I expected the bread to be grilled along with the bologna, because I wasn’t hungry or if I just didn’t like it.&nbsp; I have to say the most disappointing thing was the bun for the sandwich and my sausage. I don’t know why, I just didn’t like it. But that’s an awfully good sign that I didn’t like the pre-packaged food, and I liked everything they cooked there.  I saw the garlic bobblehead doll. I wanted to buy it because I read about it, but it was just so ugly that I couldn’t bring myself to do it. Poor ugly garlic man.  The biggest disappointment was that the garlic man was no where to be found. This was probably good for him, because he might have died from heatstroke, but sad for me. (meli if you have a picture with the garlic man, send it my way, I may just photoshop myself in)  We stayed shorter than I would have liked, but just about as long as we could because of the heat. Maybe if it was an ice festival we could have stayed longer.  Conclusion: fun, but I’m glad the whole trip wasn’t just for the garlic festival, that would have just been a freaking long drive.

      Much cuter than Disneyland. Much shorter lines. Most of the park was reasonably cool and shady even though it was 90 degrees on Saturday.&nbsp; Unfortunately it has many fewer princesses and much less cool souvenir stuff to buy than Disney. I’m in love. Although, I think it’s definitely a place for women and children. None of the rides are scary, and it’s awful cutesy. Probably, the only one who reads this blog who will love the park is Meli (if you haven’t seen it, go, go now!).  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  For those of you who haven’t bothered going to the website.  urlLink www.bonfantegardens.com  Bonfante gardens is a theme park with an agricultural theme. The main/ first attraction was the circus trees which are really a bunch of trees grafted together to make shapes and stuff.&nbsp; Michael Bonfante made them himself, was the only one who knew how, and took the secret with him to his grave. This makes him a big jerk! And I don’t like him, I hope he’s spinning in his grave about the fact that paramount is running his park and selling their crappy souvenirs.  The kiddie ride part of the park is equally great.&nbsp; Most of the rides are food themed: artichoke, strawberry, apple, banana, garlic, mushroom… and unlike every other theme park in existence that makes all of their rides shiny like a carousel horse, many of these rides were matte. And they had very much attention to detail.&nbsp; Fine lines, shading. The artichokes even had the little pointy tip debossed and painted. It is also the first theme park that I’ve noticed artichokes being sold, granted they were deep fried, but still impossible to imagine being anywhere else. They had a pedal boat attraction, but of course it wasn’t a regular pedal boat, they were duck pedal boats. There were mallards, yellow ducks and swans and they looked so ridiculously adorable floating around the pond.   The strangest part about the park was the total laid back California attitude. You could pretty much do whatever and nazi teenagers wearing leiderhosen or old fashioned dresses weren’t around to stop you. They didn’t offer any instructions on how to drive the pedal boat ducks, they just slapped you in a life vest and sent you on your ducky way. The park was so uncrowded that most of the rides all you had to do was wait for the current cycle to finish and you’d get right on. They made sure you were safe and that your belts and bars were all correct, but somehow it seemed to be more laid back, and that made it run more smoothly. The only thing they were picky about was the 1 adult per strawberry car limit. Even though two of us could have more than safely been under the weight limit. And the words “please keep you hands and arms inside the car at all times” were heard so very little, it was refreshing.   Another great thing about the park is that there is a small mid-way section with games and over half of them involve you winning a prize just for paying your $3. This is how we almost ended up with a car full of stuffed toys, but last second managed to talk ourselves out of it. We did, however, come home with velvety plush roses with a bendy stem.   Conclusion: go, go, GO!

      I try not to complain, or at least be amusing when I complain on my blog so people will still read it. But, not this time:  Traffic out of LA on Friday night was surprisingly light. Why? I can’t really tell. Maybe everyone already left for Gilroy on Thursday, because everyone in the whole freaking world seemed to be there.  Saturday morning it took us&nbsp; about 90 mins to get to Bonfante gardens. It took us less than 30 minutes to get back to the hotel because we skipped the freeway and took surface streets.&nbsp; We took those same streets on our way to the Garlic Festival and probably saved ourselves over an hour.&nbsp;   After leaving the festival we stopped by the Gilroy outlets, unfortunately they were on the way to the freeway and there was traffic. More unfortunately, there is a highway 152 that mapquest told us to take. It’s one lane each way. And there’s a yielding thing that caused a 15 mile backup which took us a good 90 mins to get through.&nbsp; So, we finally thought we were out of the woods, made it to the 5, made it to the grapevine, and there’s some major accident that makes traffic stop. Literally, people were getting out of their cars and hanging out on the freeway. And by this time it was very, very late, and we wanted to die. But no one could run over us and put us out of our traffic misery because no one could move. I got home at 1am. The trip that was supposed to take less than 5 hours took 8. Thank goodness that I don’t have to commute to work on the freeway anymore. Because I think I would rather have quit my job than face traffic again.  &nbsp;Conclusion: I need a private jet.

      I was driving to work this morning and I had just passed a truck, when I ended up stuck behind another one. But this one was different. It said "Shred-it mobile and on site document destruction"  urlLink http://shredit.com/   Here's a bit from their web site:  &nbsp;We provide you with the security of knowing that your confidential materials are destroyed completely – right at your doorstep.

I guess this is why I haven't struck it rich yet.

      I am a bad person. I may actually have a medical condition of some sort, because my mom has it too.&nbsp;Or quite possibly it's a gender flaw. But I can't myself from buying things I don't need, or will really ever use.  A year or so ago I bought a $4 tank top from Hot Topic that reads "I *heart* shy boys." Why did i buy this? because it was cute, and cost $4. Not because I'd actually wear it. Months and months later I finally decided it was reasonable to sleep in. So I do. and I'm very proud that I was able to put my dumb purchase to use, even if you can't put it in the clothes dryer.  But yesterday, oh boy, I bought a $5.50 clearance shirt from ross. It's brown and in big white glittery lettering it says "Talk nerdy to me". This I cannot wear to sleep, because it will shed glitter in my bed, and it's not particularly soft. It's not even that attractive.  If anyone wants to match me there are at least 30 more, and they come in small, medium and large. The also have shirts that say "too young for ashton" "ashton's future crush" and "you must be this tall to ride this ride."  Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, for a certain person I know who has a boyfriend named Justin, they didn't have any Justin shirts. If I had a boyfriend named Justin I probably would go out an buy the $40 shirt from urban outfitters that says "I did Justin, 3 times"

      Great!  The box is pink and has a squirrel with big&nbsp;pink cheeks&nbsp;wearing a chef hat hiding behind an apple. So I had to try it. And it's good. It tastes good, apple-y and sweet, but it smells even better. And, now that I can finally breathe through my nose again, I appreciate it even more. Maybe I'll try honey next time.  The entire box only has about 60 calories and 2 grams of fat.

      I can't believe so much fun is happening in one weekend. I'm going to the garlic festival in gilroy. But for those of you lucky enough to be in LA there is the tofu festival. Apparently there will be a guy dressed as the "tofu ninja" which alone seems worth the $8 admission. Huell Howser and the food network are also supposed to be there.    urlLink http://www.tofufest.org/    and lets not forget the cat olympics:    urlLink http://www.meowmix.com/newsevents/goldmedal/about.asp    i think some people i know should go to the events and give me a recap.

      Yesterday I got a letter from ING Direct. that bankish thing that has a orange sphere as it's main image even though i think it actually has a lion as its logo. Apparently I've been pre-approved for.... no, not a credit card like everyone else sends me.... a mortgage. me, pre-approved for a mortgage. I've spent the last few days seriously trying to figure out how i can afford an apartment, and they want me to buy a house. Somehow they didn't mention how much of a mortgage i'm qualified for.  I want a house, more than anything, really. But it'll be a while before I can afford one. Maybe my credit line will still be there when I'm ready.

      For a few years now, basically ever since I heard of it, I wanted&nbsp;to try botox under my arm to kill my sweat glands. I can't really justify the cost now,(or the fact that i'm willingly injecting posion into my body)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but It was on my wedding plans list. Weddings make perfect excuses for mostly everything.  &nbsp;  But, this procedure could be equally as useful.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  urlLink Podiatrists can plump you up for stilettos   People fattening their feet so their shoes are more comfortable.

      at $9 a bottle I expect a longer lasting nailpolish. It's actually really a good consistency and makes my nails feel very strong when I'm wearing it. It just peels off too easily. And not just chip, but peel. This I thought I was over with that bonnie bell kids stuff "brush on, peel off." &nbsp; conclusion: next time I'll buy $3 nail polish from the drug store and buy a $13.50 lipstick to push myself past the $19.50 mark for a free gift. or maybe 2 pencil sharpeners at $1 each.

      I'm going to try a new labeling system, and see how I like it. It will make it easier for you to sift through my blog on those days when I post 5 times. I am worried that my newly formed creative title writing skills will once again disappear, so maybe i'll make that the first line of the body.... anyway... &nbsp; I spent most of the weekend on the couch watching tv deciding that I was dying of tuberculosis, malaria or SARS, but somehow I managed to survive, despite all of the crap I watched. By far, the worst show I saw was MTV2's from Wack to Mack. Now, I should have gotten a clue by the fact that it's an original MTV2 series, but I didn't quite realize that until at the end of the makeover the kids said "thank you MTV2" in whatever vernacular they were using. &nbsp; Now, I've seen a makeover show or two in my day. And in every makeover they start out somewhere between hideous and mediocre and they aways improve.&nbsp; Always. Leave it to MTV2 to be on the cutting edge and take a guy from looking horrible, to making him look equally horrible, yet different. Quite possible this is because my taste runs more classic or preppie than hip hop star. But, honestly, his parents couldn't have liked his new look much more than his old one. They were just happy he chopped of his stringy disgusting long hair. And the before picture of the girl was her wearing some kind of logo tracksuit not much different than the after look of the guy. Also, they went to Jacob the jeweler, who is apparently mentioned in some kind of popular song. I didn't quite understand if they got to keep the 75 carat total diamond cross on a diamond chain or the 8 carat diamond ring and matching earrings. but, wow. those were probably the most expensive things those kids had ever touched. mtv doesn't have that kind of budget i'm sure. now that i think about it, it's pretty mean. taunting these kids with what they can't have... &nbsp; anyway. this is a horrible show. at least the girl got a good haircut out of the deal. I think clinton and stacy need to have the learning channel call mtv and give them some advice. &nbsp; Yes, I know I'm old. and square. &nbsp;

      Catfight: Women and Competition by Leora Tanenbaum   I don't recommend it. So, far i'm not quite 1/3 of the way through the 300 pages, i hope it will get better, but i doubt it. As you know, I judge books by their covers, and I seriously mis-judged this one.   I don't like being told that i'm oppressed, or being held down by the man, or whatever. I am totally privilidged, and have never felt any real effects of sexism. I can form my own opinions, thank you. The author is a woman with absolutely no self-esteem, where every guy on the street, every magazine ad, every hollywood profile makes her feel inferior. She needs to get over herself. The book is peppered with examples of her youth where she let herself feel inferior to just about everything. Unfortunately for the american public, she got over this just enough to make herself write a book, but not enough for the book to be good, or helpful to me.   Let's take a look at some of her insight:   You'd think the desire to be liked would make girls and women bloom beneath the rays of another woman's admiration. Yet the opposite is often true: We worry that admiration could lead to envy and resentment. When a female friend or colleague tells us how much she respects our work, we're inclined to say, "Oh, it's not as important as what you do." If she admires our outfit, many of us habitually respond, "This? Uch, it's just something I got on sale five years ago" or "really? you do?" the words "thank you" don't occur to us. God forbid we come across as complacent or proud.   I don't know about this "us" and "we" thing. I personally tell people thank you every time they compliment me. IT'S THE FREAKING POLITE THING TO DO! And, I believe that I deserve every compliment I get. But I don't go out of my way to get compliments, because I don't base my self worth on what other people say. And when someone compliments my outfit, i will usually say something like "thanks, i got it on sale for $10 at ross" I'm not belittling my self by saing i got it on sale, in fact i'm proud of it, and i'm offering people tips so they themselves can find a great skirt for $10.    So   Dear Leora Tanenbaum, and whoever wrote that Men are from Mars... crap,   Please, next time you feel free to categorize an entire gender, leave me out of it. I will make my own rules for myself. And I don't want to listen to you telling me about how I am.   Do you know why I'm not an astronaut? Because I had some really bad science teachers in High School that made me lose interest in science. Who's fault is this, my own, for not keeping the interest up on my own. I wasn't given bad teachers because i was female, both genders equally filled the class. Not because I don't feel like I can compete with men in a male dominated profession. And not because my lack of a penis makes me bad with figures, numbers and concrete examples.   Do you want to know why I'm not a fireperson. Because I prefer a career path based on brains rather than brawn. Not because I couldn't be strong enough if I tried. Not because it's "men's work"   Why do I not look like a supermodel? Because I choose to spend my time and money pursuing other things, like education, and having a healthy relationship to food. If my full time job was to be beautiful, then I could certainly succeed. I could excercise, I could starve myself, I would have people paid to dress me, fix my hair, fix my makeup, and I could be up on a pedestal (a tall one to make up for my height).   In the immortal words of Mattel "We girls can do anything. Right, Barbie?" And if Barbie could talk the astronaut, rock star, WWF panda protector, fashion model, presidental candidate, ballerina, teacher, army recruit, equestrian, and fantastic date would say "Abso-fucking-lutely."   Once again, please, in your writing, please change the word "women" to the phrase "women, except Cynthia and others like her"   thank you,  -------   Conclusion: gender studies is crap  Conclusion 2: It's not my fault so many women have such low self esteem. I'm doing my part.  conclusion 3: i should write a book and show these cowering jerks how it's done.

      Book Review: The Thoroughly Modern Married Girl: Staying Sensational After Saying "I Do" by Sarah Bliss  The spring/summer 2002 i read through a stack full of books with titles like bombshell manual of style, swell girls guide to the good life, fantastic flirty and fun, the single girl's guide to being fabulous, good fabulous pink stuff...--okay, so i've made up some of the titles. but you get the picture. there are gazillions of these books on the market. none of their content is very different from eachother, so you really should pick based on the pictures.  but i was at the library last week and saw  The Thoroughly Modern Married Girl  which is exactly the same as all those books, except it's for young, fabulous and married women. i think it actually expects you to have read, or at least have a good knowledge that the previous books exist, or maybe the opposite. because the author takes exactly the same tone as all the rest of these books. you are already fabulous, now just make a few changes to be fabulous and married.   for some reason my mom got a subscription to ladies home journal and in the last week we got 2 issues. this is a very, very bad magazine for old boring people. one of the articles was how the author tried to go on a romantic date with her husband, they swore they wouldn't talk about bills, children etc. 5 minutes into dinner they started talking about the children, and then decided to go straight home after dinner to be with the kids. the concusion was not: oh my gosh, i'm old, boring and horrible. it was: yup, that's the way it is, i've grown out of all the fun and romanance and everything good, and i wouldn't have it any other way. the recipes aren't even any good.  now if you cross a much younger ladies home journal without all the depressing boring old people articles but still the same concerns about how to have fun, how to hang out with another couple when one is your friend and the other is the dumbest, worst person on earth etc with any one of those single girl books written by single girls who think the whole world revolves around them, you'll get this book.  i could have done with less condesending fake situations and a few more real life examples, recipes, and song lists.  conclusion: don't buy it for yourself. but it wouldn't make a half bad wedding shower gift. i read/skimmed through it in less than 2 hrs. the cover is cute, and there are a few cute illustrations inside. also, maybe someone who didn't spend months reading pastel colored self help/entertainment/reference books might find this book new and novel.  second conclusion: i should write a book. too bad i'm lazy.

      I woke up again today with a sore throat. I totally thought I was over that on sunday, but I guess not. I had 2 large cups of tea this morning, but they did nothing to soothe my throat. Then I debated if i should eat my lunch or go buy Jamba Juice and vitamin shock my system into getting well. Somehow my leftover ravioli and meatballs sounded better, even though I didn't have an appetite when I started, and it looked rather disgusting all cold and congeled. But as I was eating i started to feel better. It wasn't just the food, because I ate breakfast. It was totally the meat. Meat made me feel better. But only while i was eating. It's back now. I just came back from the store though, and I'm hoping if i drink 1/4 gallon of orange juice in the next 3 hours it will help.  And speaking of oj, what happened to donald duck orange juice? It was no where to be found at the vons i went to. that stuff was good.  Now i'm thinking i should go home and marinade a steak in orange juice for dinner. Although, I bet that works better without the pulp.

      I was totally wrong. I got my two favorite atari games working. And video games are for me! at least Mr. Robot and Spare Change are. For those of you who haven't been blessed with these wondeful games, Mr. Robot is an obstacle course type thing that involves trampolines, conveyor belts, escalators, fire poles to slide down and alien fires to kill. It also has the best song I've ever heard come out of my atari. Spare change takes place at a carnival. You have to fill your token box with 18 tokens before the zerks fill their piggy bank with 5. If you do they put on a show for you. ahhhh. good times.  p.s. does anyone know if i can get the frogger song as a cell phone ring tone?

      I saw Supersize Me this week at the $3 theater. I was happy that i only had to pay $3 but even happier that i didn't have to get my ass on the freeway so i could go see it somewhere trendy like los angeles or santa monica. there were about 35 people in the theater with me. all of them were of average weight or below. not one single fat person was there.  it was exactly the movie i was expecting, no surprises. and it kept me entertained. i was very happy to see that his final conclusion was basically "stop the supersizing already, the food is bad enough in it's regular portion" this adds sense to the rumors that mc donalds is doing away with the supersizing because of the movie. no news story that covered it mentioned that was the guy's conclusion, so it didn't make any sense to me that the end of supersizing was a reaction to the movie. but apparently it does answer that. i blame shoddy reporting.  and now i want fries.

      I am not registered with a political party, I hoped that this would save me from getting all sorts of political crap in the mail the way my parents do. I am officially registered as "Decline to state," and have been since I've been for the last 6 years (wow, I'm old). And as you all know, I do lean a bit left. But, God bless the republicans!  First Lydia made me aware of the  urlLink W Ketchup   then, today  urlLink yahoo news  reminded me of the ketchup and introduced me to   urlLink star spangled ice cream   You can buy 4 bottles of this ketchup for $20 including shipping. This seems a bit pricey, but the price goes down when you buy in bulk.  However, for the republican ice cream in various politically charged flavors you will be paying $76 for four quarts including shipping. That's $19 a pint. That's almost 8x than the low trader joe's price of $2.50 a pint for Ben and Jerrys you can. If i'm going to pay $76 dollars for ice cream I'm going to buy it by the bucket and fill a large bathtub and swim around. The republicans better have damn good ice cream if they expect to sell it.  And, better yet, for $5 a pint, plus $100 label design, plus shipping that includes dry ice packing that they warn you will be "signifigant" you can get your picture on the ice cream. Now, that would be a fantastic wedding favor. It beats my personalized water bottles idea by far.   God Bless America! The land of the people who will spend $19 on a pint of ice cream and not bat an eyelash.

      So, apparently the weekend of July 24 is the cool weekend to hold events. It is the weekend of the Gilroy Garlic Festival which I'm going to. It's the weekend of the cat olympics in Santa Monica. And it's the weekend of the LA Tofu festival, which i knew, but didn't know until monday that they food network is going to be there. If they're there, can they also be in Gilroy? or have they already been to gilroy too many times and they're just going to eat tofu? I will be sad if the food network doesn't show up in Gilroy. But not sad enough to not ride in a giant garlic, and get my picture taken with a giant garlic man. They probably wouldn't let me in anywhere else afterward anyway, on account of my garlic breath.

      The Pillsbury bake off (oh my gosh, Microsoft word knows that Pillsbury is a word that should be capitalized and auto corrected it!) was 2 weekends ago. This threw me for a loop, because they don’t usually have it in the summer. And it was held in la. I wish I could have gone.  I will when I get my makeover show. I bet I could have done my makovering there.  This is the million dollar recipe:   urlLink Oats 'n Honey Granola Pie   I’m planning on making it soon. I’ll be the judge of it being worth a million dollars.  You can go   urlLink here  to see all the entering recipes.  I’ve decided I need to enter contests, and I need to win more prizes. Unfortunately, it seems that people really need to dedicate themselves to winning prizes in order to do it. And I just can’t fully dedicate myself to a hobby that involves more than sitting on the couch. I’m hoping that when I start school again my need for procrastination can be filled by contests and cooking.  And, once again I’ll recommend  Cookoff: Recipe fever in America  by Amy Sutherland. I’m almost done with it and it’s very inspiring, well not so much inspiring as making me want to win contests.

      it was well stated in the movie mean girls, and i'm not sure anyone really had the guts to point it out before in such mass media, even though it was a well known phenomenon. girls are just dying for the opportunity to look like whores and still be socially accepted. not real whores, because real women who sell their services, are doing it for the cash and not as a hobby. they don’t put nearly the effort into their choice of clothing and lack thereof as the subset of anime girls. Now, most normal girls can only dress up in something truly skimpy one day a year, Halloween. Everyone will tell them how cool their costume is, the boys will notice them and the girls wearing more modest outfits will covet the attention or talk behind their backs, or both. For nerdy girls, this opportunity comes twice a year, Halloween and Anime Expo. And for the really geeky ones who stay in and hand out candy in their sweats, AX is the only chance they have.  Now, I have to say that this year either people were showing a bit more restraint, or I was blissfully not paying attention to the super ugly girls who were baring way too much skin. Besides a few girls and  urlLink man faye  I was pretty comfortable with people’s clothing choices. The super ugly girls are sad to begin with, but dressed up in little more than underwear and they become the saddest population, and makes one want to avoid conventions just to stay away from the unpleasantness. So, un-self-aware yet aware enough that they aren't sexy and dying to be sexy these girls equate very little clothing with being attractive, and you feel bad for them, yet not too bad because you’re forced to look at the train wreck that is them, and it’s not fun.  To them I say, save up some money and then get a professional makeover, or sell your soul for a tv makeover.  Everyone will be better for it, and once you’re attractive you can replace your fake anime friends with real ones. Just as a general rule, if you have to buy all of your clothes from the plus-sized section, please wear that clothing. You may be a lovely person, with lots of good qualities, you may even find a boy and get married one day. but you’re not going to attract anyone based on looks alone, please stop trying.  Then there is the other, super minority, the super-hot girls that you know are way too hot to like anime and be at the convention. Why are they there? It’s a completely mystery, because they could be in the Bahamas living a life of luxury being kept by some rich hunk.  Maybe they’re too young, and the day they turn 21 they’ll be on that plane. Or maybe their robot will fly them there. To the girl in the red Chinese type dress who was showing a mile of leg, and the one in the furry bikini, god bless you for giving every geeky boy hope that one day he can meet someone half of your attractiveness and she will give him the time of day. Because these boys need hope. And those  urlLink MPS  boys are going home with a burst of inspiration because of Lydia’s  urlLink dress . They’re going to win their next competition, and she’ll probably get a robot in the mail next week. And I’m very jealous of that. Note to the second mps boy from the right: I can’t help you build robots, but I’m a girl. If you want, I can paint them, or help you pick out fabric for the insides. And I will hook up with you if you let me drive the robot, you can park it though.   I should skip this whole library school thing and take up cosmotology, fashion and poise. I really need to work behind the scenes at a makeover place/show. I’m pretty sure my true calling is making people better at being themselves. Screw this whole defending free speech, free information and promoting literacy crap.

      who knew i was such a trendsetter? as many times as i wore those ridiculous earrings from the late 80's to the early 90's. as often as i carried my dumb ornament sized teddy bear to school in middle school. nothing ever caught on. but now i guess i've blossomed. I am popular, a trendsetter if you will. People do things that i do. I experienced this a little with neopets. but this blog thing has really caught on because of me. i have to use my power for good, not evil. what should i make catch on next? suggestions?  I guess now is the time to put my toaster idea into action.

      there's a brand of vodka they're advertising in this week's Albertson's ads. I've never heard of it, but it's called UV Vodka and it comes in 3 colors, flavors actually, icee flavors. Red cherry, Blue raspberry and regular. Perfect for the 4th. except they're vodkas and they weigh the same so if you tried layering them to get a red white and blue drink you'd just end up with purple.  I haven't decided yet, but I think i like the blue raspberry alcohol concept.

      I was listening to an interview on the radio this morning with Puff Daddy, or whatever his name is. And, I came to the conclusion that I would totally like him if he spoke proper english. I already like the fact that he's not ashamed to be extragavant. He just needs to learn to talk.  He apparently is also a big fan of the library, even though he insists on calling it the li-berry. He said he knew he wanted to be in music, so he went to the library and read books on it and found himself an internship because of that. And the rest is history. He talked about how great the library is for at least 30 seconds, which is a lot in a short interview.  Maybe when I'm a librarian I'll get invited to his parties.

      The tin of altoids i bought at the 98 cent store with the abominable snowman (labeled: abominable snowmint) on it is making my desk drawer smell like mints, so i had to switch it to a draw that didn't contain any other food. in the process i noticed that the serving size is 3 pieces. 3 pieces has 10 calories and 2 carbs. 2 carbs for 3 mints. now why would they ever make that sugar free crap if you could get something respectable like altoids at less than 1 carb per mint?   i fished the box of tic tacs out of my purse and found that one tic tac has less than .4 grams of carb. further investigation led me to find that 2 tic tacs are about the same size as 1 altoid, and that at 3 calories for 2 almost the same as an altoid.  now i'm going to find some buttermints. those must be worse for you, because they taste better.

      I start library school at the end of the month, in preparation for that I have orientation this Saturday. And in preparation for that, I had to complete the "new student technology course" this week. This course consists of 6 short documents you have to read, one evaluation of fill out, one super short assignment basically there to make sure you know how to upload a word document, and free run of the new student message board, which, when you start class for real will be full of class discussion relevant to class, but is now full of pictures of people's cats. I totally thought librarians and cats were just a stereotype, a stereotype based in reality is more like it.  So the assignment was to write a paragraph about yourself in a word document and then send the word document via the electronic "black board" site. Really, really simple, I'm not sure how to even mess that up. So I sent in my paragraph yesterday, it was about me going to the garlic festival and trying garlic ice cream. And this morning I checked and I recieved 10/10 points. Yea for me. I can attach a file. And the person checking all the files wrote me back a few sentences so I could see where instructor comments go, how that works and stuff. She also said she'd always been curious about garlic ice cream. Nice, cordial response, the black board works fine. Great. Then I notice that the average class grade is 8.73. Not that the grade counts for anything, but really how do you do that assignment wrong? Are there just a few losers who didn't attach the file correctly who got a zero? and that brings everyone's 10 grade down, or are there people who get less than the full 10 points? or are the grades just random to show a reasonable class average? I don't know. But I can only hope that the rest of my assignments are 1/10 this easy.  Meanwhile, this internet thing is great an all, but I'm meeting these people on Saturday and I don't know what to wear. If I wear my cardigan will they think i'm some freakish librarian stereotype? (not like they don't all have their cats at home). Do I dress for school, or do I dress for business? Should I carry a backpack, messenger bag or a large purse? Some things are so complicated.

      I think this link should take you past the first page where you have to enter your birthday   urlLink Ciroc   anyway, this is the greatest vodka ever. somehow, it's made of grapes, the special snap frost grapes, from france. or something.  anyway, i read about it last week in the la times business section. it was an article about how the california pizza kitchen guys are planning to change the mood of their late night dining. it will still be kid friendly by day, but by night they're trying to draw in a hipper, cocktail drinking crowd. and they're starting with this magical vodka. I don't know if it's available at the CPK near you, or anywhere yet. But I tried it at the LA Food Show (1 restaurant so far in manhattan beach) and it was amazing. I was a little wary about trying it in a cosmo, because i thought the other flavors might mask it, but it was the first drink on the list, and i couldn't have been happier with it.  then the waitress left us for freaking ever, and i couldn't order a second drink. I wanted to try a ciroc and tonic to truly taste it. but my pocketbook thanks her for being inattentive.  I have yet to see this in a store, but I also haven't been looking yet. But, when I do find a bottle, I will own one.  My friends who tasted it with me tell me it's flavored like Japanese grape candy. I also need to try some of this candy.

      I saw the cutest dog this morning. it was a miniature collie. I'm pretty sure those don't exist, but i swear i saw one. Maybe it was some furry little lap dog that had the good fortune to be marked like a collie. But, that thing was cute. I don't think it could pull you out of a well though, nor would it even bother trying.

       urlLink Texas Sex-Ed Textbooks Face Contraceptives Battle   This is not really surprising news. but the news isn't the interesting part, this is:  They say the books are lacking. For example, one textbook under review advises that a good way a teen-ager can prevent a sexually transmitted disease is to get plenty of rest so he or she can have a clear head about sex and choose abstinence.

      Splenda did me in again. But I'm learning my lesson.  I went to the 98cent store today at lunch as I often do. And they got in a lot of cool new stuff since I went last week. So I was distracted and happy as I wove my way into the grocery section. And I was craving something that was ridiculously flavored, and I stopped in front of the Jones soda section in the fridge. Did i want blue, i always get blue, i should try something else. how about green, hmm maybe. Vanilla cola, could be good, but I'm in the mood for something fruity. chocolate fudge, i remember trying a chocolate soda like 15 years ago and it was the worst thing ever. then i see it. Watermelon, that could be great. So i picked it up, avoiding the one with the kid making a funny face, opting instead for a skateboarder. Wow, this was gonna be great! A new flavor of jones soda!  In chosing Jones soda I passed by the large display of melon soda in a super cool metal bottle, imported by Sangaria, Torrance. product of japan. I pick up a bottle of that on my way to the checkout as an afterthough.  And i pay, and get to my car, very excited about trying this new watermelon flavor, i crack open the twisty cap, take a sip, taste the watermelony goodness going down my throat, and pause. "Hmmm, something is a little strange" i think. So i look at the front label. No, it doesn't say diet. So i look at the nutrition label. 90 calories, that's suspiciously low, but it does have 89 more calories than diet soda. then i start on the ingredient list. carbonated water, corn syrup, color... splenda. the last ingredient is splenda. I bought Jones's version of C2. UGGH. I was so disgusted with myself I had to stop drinking, even though it wasn't horrible, just a little off...  Splenda,  is slightly less  disgusting than the other fake sweeteners, but not less disgusting enough. and really, why do they think they can just stick it in stuff and not have people notice. at least with nutra sweet and the like the packages are CLEARLY labeled. grrrr.  So, I'm learning my lesson. I will try to stop making horrible impulse purchases at the 98 cent store. I know that horrible bottle was meant for me because the fortune said "you will find much fufilment with someone special very soon" surely, that was for me.  Meanwhile, this melon soda is fantastic. I may have to go back and buy a case. This will not be a horrible impulse purchase if i still want it tomorrow.
