      SO I guess I'm going to try to make a effort to post in this thing so here goes...  Mike and Joe slept over last night, which was cool, but we really didn't do much of anything. Mike stayed up till 5 playing playstaition, I fell asleep at 2ish and as usual Joe was out by some stupidly early time. We then went to Net 24 (aka geeky lan party place) (LAN-local Area Network) (aka lot's of computers hooked up together) which was fun because I haven't played Counter Strike in a couple months and haven't gotten a chance to show off my mad 1334 skillz! (yeah...)  So I showered woohoo, then went out to dinner for Julae's b-day. That was mucho fun cuz we went to sarahs house afterwards and "did stuff" WEEEEE -cept not..........  And now I'm home, I really need to call rachel, cuz she doesn't have a sn but I've been so busy I haven't been able to call her. I just don't want her to think I'm blowing her off.  Well this has been your friendly neiborhood spid... I mean, thespian...  JEFF

      So my first post... right... I don't really know why I got one of these. I really didn't want one but I feel presured by everyone's sudden interest in them. So today I woke up and played with my NERF N-STRIKE!!!! Booyah!!!! It's the coolest ever. They haven't started selling them in Illinois yet but my parents got it for me when they dropped my sister off at Iowa yesterday. Well really they didn't drop her off because she took her own car but you understand. So really the N-Strike is a Nerf system, made up of three "blasters" that all can be used seporetly or combind into one massive nerf gun.    Above you can see all three guns apart. The Scout: A small pistol, not as good as the nitefinder, or the tech-target but not bad, and I really like the cocking mech on it. It's a lot like the locknload (the one greg has that i flipped out about) so I look forward to modding it. The Hornet: A six-shot rappid fire gun that looks very promissing. I was a little confused with it at first because it has a cocking arm and a pump but the arm really serves more as a safty. Now that I have figgure that out it's so much fun to shoot. It's semi-out with single shots or all six darts can be fired at once. Very cool. The Titan: A bazooka-ish gun that fires a 12 inch missile that feels like someone is is slapping you. Mike and I took turns "testing" it out on each other. It's crazy. It takes over 16 pumps to load, has a pressure gauge, and has a safty mech that you cant fire it about a 45 degree angle so that you can't shoot your self in the face if you choose to pump with your feet.    Now here they are all hooked up. Both the hornet and titan can be pumped form the same pump. As cool as it is hooked up, it's so huge that it's really anoying. Meh owell.  So in conclusion, best $40 nerf set ever. Be warned. If the titan can shoot that giant missile 50 feet, how far do you thing it will shoot a stephan (my tiny darts) once I mod it. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  I'm sorry I put you all through that. In other news I am going to Jason's tonight for the BBQ. Should be fun.  "TC IS SHIT FREE" - Cassidy I'm out- Jeff
