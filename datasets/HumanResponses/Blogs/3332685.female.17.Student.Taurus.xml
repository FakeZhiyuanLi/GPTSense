      yesterdays end of the begining of the day sucked.  but the begining of the end of the day was raw.  i had met up with MaryJane and she kept me company until around 9.  then i fell asleep.  i had gotten into a argument with some people at school.. oh well its over and today is a new day... then it will end.. and tomorrow always comes.  so far today has been good... waiting until 215 to get out of this damned school. after school is over we need to go seek maryjane... she is hiding and we need to come up with a way to find her... hehe:)
