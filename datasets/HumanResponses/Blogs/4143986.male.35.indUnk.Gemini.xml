						   I have been listening to the radio this morning where they have been discussing how the big retail stores (especially the major supermarkets) use headology techniques to seperate me from my hard earned money.  At lunch I decided to pop to one of the numerous sandwich bars that can be found in Central London. When I arrived I was, as always astounded by the wealth of options for my snack. Then..  I noticed some of the pre-packaged sandwiches had a gawdy red sticker claiming them to be a "MEAL DEAL! £2 (or less)". Under that were the details of the deal. It claimed that I could claim my meal deal price if I had a meal deal labelled sandwich (95p each), any 60p soft drink and and standard packet of crisps (40p) .  Well I thought this sounded like a super deal, and purchased all three, although I don't normally buy crisps... but what the hell... It means I could get the deal if I had them as well. I payed £1.95 (as promised it was less than £2)  and went on my way.  While sitting in a small area of greenery I munched my deal, and had some time to think about the offer. When I totted up all of the costs I realise that there was no special deal for buying all three. Just adding them together, without any discount is £1.95. The buggers!  I know it seems petty, and probably it is, but I don't like being controlled in this way. I like to look for good deals, but I also like to just get what I want. If I am going to buy something extra as part of a promotion or deal then I like to actually GET a deal.  Well.. That's my moan done for today :-)

						   I include this on my blog because a) it made me laugh, and b) it made me laugh :-)   Once upon a time, in a land far away, a beautiful, independent, self-assured princess happened upon a frog as she sat, contemplating ecological issues on the shores of an unpolluted pond in a verdant meadow near her castle.  The frog hopped into the princess' lap and said:  "Elegant Lady, I was once a handsome prince, until an evil witch cast a spell upon me. One kiss from you, however, and I will turn back into the dapper, young prince that I am and then, my sweet, we can marry and setup housekeeping in your castle with my mother, where you can prepare my meals, clean my clothes, bear my children, and forever feel grateful and happy doing so."  That night, as the princess dined sumptuously on a repast of lightly sauteed frog legs seasoned in a white wine and onion cream sauce, she chuckled and thought to herself:  "I don't f***ing think so..."

						   I was reading a "Yahoo" short news article this morning and there was one about that most wonderful and amusing American President George Bush. Apparently yet another "Bushism" has been spouted.  Is it possible for one man to make so many vocal errors? Or are they scripted into his speeches? As an Englishman looking across the pond to our American cousins I would say there’s every chance that it’s a smoothly run operation to ensure everyone thinks he’s a bit dull. It probably raises his ratings in the personality polls at least.  The more I think of it, the more I think it’s due to the "Simpsons" effect. Perhaps George is trying to emulate that icon of the great Cultural Revolution "Homer Simpson".  D’oh!

						   Welcome to the world of "Basically Irrational".  I love to listen to what is going on in the world, and most of what I hear leaves me wondering "Why?". I have a sneaky feeling that I’m not the only one who feels this way. Sometimes it’s international events of great world importance, and other times it’s local goings on that make my jaw drop.  I thought I would start up this blog to share my views on some of the events that I see and hear going on around me. What I would love is to hook up with others who are left gobsmacked by life in general. Perhaps they will live just up the street, or maybe half way round the world. I am going to write up my first story for posting. If someone out there beats me to it then that’s cool.  I hope you enjoy getting my views as much as I’ll enjoy getting yours.   Marty
