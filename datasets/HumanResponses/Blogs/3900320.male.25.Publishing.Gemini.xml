      "Drug deeling just to get by, stuck your money to get sky.  We weren`t sopporsed to make it past 25, jokes on you we`re still alive.  Throw your hands up in the sky, and say we don`t care what people say."  written by Kanye West.  First time that I heard of this lyric, honestly I was irritated by his irresponsible message.  What the heck this artist trying to say?  Is he encouraging us to do a drug deeling?    However, when I comtemprated the lyrics deeper, I reliazed that it is not that easy to say, "I don`t care what people say about me", because all of us, human being, are tied together in the manner of social lives.  It must require some firm detemination on what you are to do.  Trust yourself and don`t let anyone make you feel ashamed.  Maybe that`s it.  Everyone needs to make a living somehow.  No one can`t make a fool of it.  Thinking in that way makes me feel ease.  I work from 8 a.m. until 10 p.m. everyday, and it is just an ordinaly thing for Japanese workers.  This is how I do.  And I know this struggle is sure to be worth it someday.  But I just wish....picture in my head, like what if my life goes a little slower, so that I can make sure every step that I take is safe and it is on the right track.  I just wish I could go slow.  So I name this blog as "Live Slow" and put my little hope in it.  This is my first entry of Live Slow.

      Hey, ya`ll.  How are u doing out there? Some of you might in US, some in Europe, or some with me in the hottest city here, Tokyo.  Although we have different lifestyle and all, we`re all connected here in this blog.  I wanna say, how cool that is!  We don`t have to worry about not keeping in touch or not having sent an e-mail for so long.  We can just keep ourself posted out here.   Like I said, we don`t have to go to each country to talk about daily lives, just post it here.  However, topics that I am going to tell you might be not up-to-date one,  Today, I am done with my work very early, like around 5:30 pm.  So I decided to call up one of my friend and go to movie.  But you know what?  I am going to watch "The day after tomorrow".  Can`t you believe that?  The day after tomorrow is still playing.  Oh man.   Most movies playing in Japan are almost turning into classic.  Not classic as cool but classic like a picture-hanging-in-music-room kinda thing.  Anyway, if it is a good one, then ppl don`t care if it is old or not.  Right?  So I am bouncing to theatre now, hoping that The day after tomorrow turn out to be such a composer portrait in music room.
