      For you who watched the race you know about the red flag well I was there and it was heck. Around the 90 or 100 lap area a really bad storm came and there was bad lightning and everyone in the grand stand was ordered off the stand so we went to the ground floor and waited and waited. After about an hour of waiting we thought they would call the race since all the cars were put up and everything and 1 hour and 40 mins. after we left the started the race grrr that made me mad. well im sorry this post is so small its just i have to go i'll try and post something tonight bye

        A couple of days ago I saw the 3rd Harry Potter movie with my friends Abby and Alex. It was a pretty darn good movie except there were some mistakes like when Harry looked at the poster of Sirius Black. The first time the number was 390 and the second it was 007, when filming in the Shrieking shack, whenever Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) went to say his line, you could see Hermione (Emma Watson) mouthing it, and at the start of the film when Harry blows up Aunt Marge it is light, but when he storms out it's night time. Hello is the director making mistakes because he is new at this or what!?!    Today I am packing for a trip to Tennesse. Why? Because my family and I are visiting my Aunt, Uncle, Grandma, and cousins. Also on Saturday if you Nascar fans out there are reading this you should know about the race on Saturday. Well we got tickets to see it so I get to watch it. It would be even cooler though if Jeff Gordon was racing there because if you havent guessed yet I am huge Jeff Gordon fan. Go # 24 hehe lol.    Melinda and I are friends again, but one of her friends in Kansas if being a rude little biotch to me and i'm like melinda and I are friends again so you can stop being a female dog to me and she said just because you two are friends again doesn't mean I have to be your freind and I said wait when did I ever say i wanted you to be my friend. Grrr she made me sooo mad.    I won't be able to post anything on here on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday because of me being out of town. Well I better start packing buhbyeness.

       Last night was the second night for me to sleep on the couch I guess it is just easier for me to get up in the morning when everyone is walking past you and turning the tv's on. Tonight I am having a friend, Brittney L., spend the night, so yes again I am sleeping on the couch. Yippee!! I don't know if me and Melinda are friends again, so if I want to say anything about her I will just say her name and not my friend. Around 2pm my little brother Michael and I went to the swimming pool (Fun Fun!!). I saw Chelsea, Heather, Brittney, Christian, Dillion, David, Billy, Cassie, Alyson, Megan, and last but not least Brandon. Some of these people are my friends and some I don't hate, but dislike greatly. Yes, if they were to get hurt I would care no matter who it was just because I am a christian and God wants me to love my neighbors. When my lil bro and I got back he wanted me to put water in his water worm so I got the hose and started filling it up and when it was half full it broke. He was all upset because he had just got it yesterday and I felt bad because I was the one filling it up and I felt responsible. Later we started playing hide-and-go-seek in the house guess who always found the other the fastest? If you said me then you are correct! The guitar I want to get is black with white in the middle it is $119 that's with shipping and handiling. My step dad says I should get an acustic (I don't think I spelt that right) before I get an electric but I really want the electric guitar so I'm gonna have to find someone who can teach me how to play it. If anyone who knowes me has any advice please tell me. Thank you very very much. Everyone has a favorite quote and I can't think of anything else to write so here is my quote that I go by or you could say I just like it.  Winners only win because the losers are afraid to try.  I've heard that soo many times and if anyone is affended by that then tell someone who cares. Well I need to go. Love ya all. Buhbyeness (

       Today Melinda and I went to go see a movie just so you know it's called "Mean Girls" I would recommend it to friends, but to the guys no because it is a girly girl movie hint hint: a 'Chick Flick' aka most guys wouldn't like it. There were some funny parts in it well I guess because other people were laughing and so was Melinda, the only part I thought was funny is when these kids were saying on the third day God created the rifle (some kind of gun like that) so that man could fight of the dinosourse and the homosexiuals. lol it was great (not really but okay). hmmm... for your Info I can't spell that good so if i make a mistake that's why! If you have a problem with my spelling call  1-800-I-DONT-GIVE-A-CRAP!! Have a nice day lol! :-P  Nothing really eventful happened today. All I really did was baby-sit my lil bro from 10am-4pm. No biggy. Oh some interestin news is i'm trying to save up $$150-160 to get a gutiar the colour on it is called sunburst it's all good lol. My nose started to peel today FYI I got a sunburn Saturady (ouch)! hmmm but now I have a tan! yippe. Guess what?! Tomorrow and the next day and the next dat and the day after that I get to watch my lil bro so exciting I know and I know you wish you could be me, but i'm sorry you can't lol joking wit ya. The only good thing about baby-sitting is the pay check lol. Today it rained and we got some hail bout the size of marbles. yup. Well that pretty much ends today buhbyeness

         Hey yall. Today my uncle his wife and daughter came and later my aunt and her husband and three kids will be coming. So it is crowded here!! We rented a hotel for my aunt her husband and kids because she has a 9 month old baby and lets think a child that age usually screams crys and isnt always a happy lil camper so this was just the best way everyone is happy and anywayz our house would have been too cramped ( we don't have enough room). And on Monday my unlce hise wife and daughter are goin back to Virginia (don't know if I spelt that right). Andddd me and my brother and cousin are goin back too so Fun Fun.

      Sorry I haven't been updating lately I've been busy. Nothing has been happening lately soo I really don't have anything to talk about.  Last weekend I was at my dad's house and I finally got to meet Eric. I think Abby annoys him, Abby is my dad's gf's daughter, because she always tells him how much she likes him and how cute he is. I mean it's like she thinks they are dating (sry abby if you read this plzz no hard feelings). I mean telling him once is fine but after awhile it gets old. I also learned that the horses they have aren't for riding (what a bummer). There is this pony for sale and I want to by it and then ask them if it can stay in their feild since it is huge and they have ponies that it could get along with (hopefully), but the chances of that (me getting the pony0 are slim to nothing.  I've bleached my hair, blonde of course duh, we are gonna keep bleachin it till it gets really blonde and next summer I'm gonna beg my mom to let me get blue highlights.  Today when i was taking a bath around 1pm, my mom came home for her lunch break and I always bring my boom-box into the bathroom so i can listen to music while I take a bath. And the song playing was Le Freak by Chic and she came in a started dancin till the song stopped and I'm like mom hello I'm naked!   On July 25th (I think) I goto Washington, D.C. with my Uncle, and we are going to see all the koo sights, and for like soposibliy for like three of the days we are there (FYI we are staying there for a week or a week and a-half) but anywayz three of the dayz we are there we are gonna be at the beach. Can you say Tanning!? lol.  Tonight my bro had friends spend the night. FUN FUN!! (NOT!!!!)   Still single (broke up with my bf like a couple of weeks ago or more)  I'm in marching band.  I went shopping today.  Maybe tomorrow I can get some shoes.  FYI I like no LOVE shoes!  Well g2b buhbyeness. Love yall

      Okay here is why I'm sad. For the past three or four days I have been going to the power house ( Its a place were teens can hang out) and there is this guy there I like and my friends know that I like him so they decided to do something about it well he said I was pretty ( thats is what my friend said he said but I don't believe it) and he said if he got to know me he might like me too, something like that, and so I kinda had some hope. So Megan went to him and was talking to him and then all of a sudden he says he likes this one girl and she is my friend, but she doesnt like him so I have no chance now and I'm very sad. well g2b buhbyeness stay safe.
