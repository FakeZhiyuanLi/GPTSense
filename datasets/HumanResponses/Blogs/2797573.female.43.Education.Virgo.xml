      Today I thought it would be fun to start a BLOG.  I'm still not sure exactly what it is, but didn't look too hard to do.  My family is interested in many things, so this will probably be a compliation of lots of different kinds of things.

      Now that I've given a short, but sweet version of our last couple of years, I will keep this part more up to date.  Right now 2 of my children are deep in the middle of rehearsal's for a play, Anne of Green Gables.  They are having a good time.  I didn't get a part this time and I have been kind of bummed about it, but it's a humbling experience to look on instead of being involved.  I'm sure it will help me understand them better when they have to look on.  We all fight for our time on the computer, which is kind of a pain.  So, not only do I spend time on the computer, I have started another hobby, knitting.  I'm working on an afghan right now.  I just finished a baby blanket for my niece's new baby.  I mailed it on the way home from school today.  I hope she likes it and understands that even though there may be mistakes, I put some of myself into it.

      Just as we were finally adjusting to life here in Ky, my dad, who is a pastor, received a call to a church in Alabama.  He had semi-retired from a church he had been senior pastor of for about 20 years.  It was also the church he had attended before going into the ministry.  For the past six months he had worked as an interim pastor in a congregation not too far from the parsonage where he and my mother were still living.  They had been warning the family that they could be relocating soon, but everyone was shocked when they found out it would be Alabama!  Sean, myself, and our 2 youngest children, flew out to southern CA to help them pack and drive their cars out here.  Of all my siblings, I was the most excited since they would now be a lot closer to us.  The trip out here was pretty exciting.  We seemed to follow a storm the entire way.  The worst part was the evening we were trying to get to Fort Worth, Texas, for the night.  My vision isn't as good as I would like when it is dark and to make matters worse there was a torrential rainfall and road construction.  Wouldn't you know there were semi trucks everywhere?  I becamse seriously disoriented and asked everyone if we could stop as soon as possible for the night.  Thankfully, there were no accidents or anything, but I wanted to stop before any could happen.  After we arrived in AL, Sean and I still had to drive back to our home.  We arrived around 4:30 am.  Our older 2 children were glad we were back.  They managed pretty well while we were gone and we were very proud of them.  I'm trying to skip some of the more tedious details, but all in all things have been pretty eventful.  We've been down to AL twice now, once for a weekend right after my parents moved into their new house, and again for a week of spring break.  We've enjoyed getting to know the area.  Both Sean and I really like the town they have moved to, and the congregation is great.  They have a restaurant that Sean could eventually transfer to, so we are keeping our options open.  We did decide, however, to commit to one more year here in KY.  I promised the principal I would stay one more year so i could be under contract and have a steady income.  Jacob will be starting college at the end of June not too far away and we would like to stay close at least his first year.  Sean also would like to work on some things in his job which would make it better for him to transfer.  Now that we are happier where we live, we are happier with staying.  Having family fairly close also helps, we can visit more often.  They are even planning on coming here for Jacob's graduation.  All in all, things are looking up.  The only real problem we seem to be having is financial.  We just can''t seem to get it together!  Another reason for staying put a little longer.

      When the kids and I left for our summer-long vacation I was extremely homesick for either CA or ID, I didn't care which one, just not KY.  I had been teaching at DCA and was not in the mood to think about a whole next year, so I foolishly didn't sign a contract, but left it open.  Unfortunately, when we returned I went to talk to our principal and discovered he'd filled all the positions and didn't have anything for me!  Ouch!  Just as I thought I'd be out of work, one of the teacher's had a family emergency and couldn't start the year.  I worked as a long term sub for the first nine weeks of the school year.  I really enjoyed the class.  I was sorry when the teacher came back.  They had a few other temporary things for me to do for a couple of more weeks, but then I was done.  During the couple of weeks I stayed home I had to deal with a few health problems.  Just when I started to get used to not working one of the teachers resigned and I was able to fill in.  Another teacher who was teaching PE part time was willing to split the class, so I teach 4 days a week and she does 1.  It's nice having that extra day off.  The week before Christmas we found a different house to rent.  It was a few more miles away and would have put the kids in a different school district, but we got permission to keep them in the same school they were already in.  We have liked it so much better!  It's very homey and comfortable for our family.    So, I ended last year in a very negative way, but am feeling much better about this year.  We've been involved in community theater, which I love.  The kids are doing better in school.  We love our house.  So, we will spend at least one more year here.  I've even committed to teaching fulltime next year.    I still havent even gotten into what my parents have been up to!

      He did it!  Jacob pulled it off and graduated with his class.  After the struggle he had for 2 years I am proud to say that he made it.  He even graduated with honors.  If he hadn't gone through that tough time he may have even had more honors.  My parents were able to come up for the ceremony.  It was nice having them here.  I wish they could have stayed longer.  We've had tornado and thunderstorm watches the last few days.  It's kind of exciting, but we never get the good stuff.  It seems to pass either above of below us.  I know it doesn't seem right to wish for bad weather when so many people are suffering from it.  I have this overwhelming urge for a serious storm to blow through.  I don't know why, I think it has something to do with why I always seem to have trauma in my life.  I like to work through tough things.  It's what makes life so interesting.    Tomorrow I am going down to Alabama for a few days.  My dad flew into Portland early this morning and is driving my sister, Elizabeth, back.  She's going to start a new life and go back to school.  Things have been pretty rough for her in Oregon.  We are hoping their weather is ok for the trip.  My mom and I are driving to Atlanta to pick up my d√°d's car from the airport.  I've never been to Atlanta, so I'm looking forward to it.  I found out something really strange yesterday.  The pastor of our church here in Danville was on the same Luther Tour to Germany that I was on 21 years ago!  I don't remember him and he doesn't remember me, but that was a very weird coincidence!  I'm going to show him my pictures some time.

      This is a crazy time.  Jacob is graduating and there is so much to do.  Yesterday he had a picnic for his school club and then he had his baccalaureate service.  I have lots of papers to grade and report cards to do.  Then, after school tomorrow I have to clean and organize my classroom.  My parents are coming on Friday for the graduation, so I need to have the house looking semi decent.  Our land lady is coming on Saturday, so we want things to look good.  I like to be busy, though, so that is a good thing.  I am more productive when I'm busy.  Next week my dad is flying in to Portland to help my sister drive out to Alabama.  She is starting over.  I hope it goes well for her.  Then we are going down to AL next week, also.  Sarah is going to summer school, so we have to come back on the sixth.  Sean is taking his vacation on July 5, so we are going to go camping down at the gulf coast.  I'm looking forward to it!

      Anne of Green Gables is over.  It's always sad when a production ends, even if I wasn't in this one.  I like all the people I see at the theater.  Yesterday Sean and I went to the park alone and had a good talk.  We haven't really done that too much lately.  He may even try to look for another job.  It would be so nice if he could work a normal work week and spend more time with the family.  His job has been so stressful lately.  It was good that we could talk about how we are feeling and not get mad at each other.  I spoke to our lawyer this morning and she gave me some hope that we can get our finances under control.  We may be able to get our monthly payments lowered or even stopped.  They've taken so much out of our checks that we don't have much to live on.  What a relief.  Now, if I could start having my body feel better I would be happy.  I have a dr. appt. this afternoon.  My dr. is leaving the practice soon, so I'm very bummed.  I hope she can help me get established with another dr. so that I don't have to start all over again!  Tomorrow night Jacob is receiving his scholarships at an awards ceremony at his school.  We are very proud of him!

      Time for my weekly update.  Our finances just seemed to go from bad to worse.  By Wednesday I was so depressed I finally did something I had never done before and hated to do.  I called my parents to ask for money.  It was hard on my pride because I am the oldest of 5 children and pretty much the only one who hasn't asked for help.  I like to be independent and think I have it all under control, but right now I don't.  We had a whole week to go before either of us was paid and we had a 7 dollar balance in our checking account.  We had been trying to get ahold of our lawyer the last month, but she seems so hard to talk to.  At one time I spoke to someone at her office and they said she would help reschedule our payment plan, but then I never heard anything more.  I also had been trying to access my retirement account to make an emergency withdrawal.  Nothing seemed to be coming together.  My parents offered to send a little money.  It is enough to get us through until Friday.  Another good thing is that we called the trustee and explained the problem we are having with our lawyer and they gave us a number to call to get help with this problem.  Things are gradually working out, but we are still sunk into a pretty deep pit.  On the good news side, the kids had their opening of the play they are in.  Friday night Joseph had a crisis.  He somehow was led to the wrong place for curtain call and came in at the wrong time.  He was very embarressed about it, but life goes on.  Then, on Saturday, Sarah's skirt was stepped on while she was going down some steps and it ripped pretty badly.  She was pretty upset.  I came to the theater on Sunday and repaired it.  It will be fine.  So after 2 tough nights, Sunday's performance went pretty smoothly.  I'm still kind of jealous about not getting a part.  I'm trying to be mature about it.  Sometimes it is hard.

      When I'm not writing I think of lots of things to say.  I've written whole stories in my head, but now I'm blank.  This is my day off.  When I agreed to finish the year for another teacher, I didn't really want to teach full time.  There are a lot of reasons, one of which is I'm basically lazy.  But the legitimate reasons have to do with my family and my health.  I have a 3 year old who I really like keeping at home.  He's such a home body that he doesn't like to go anywhere.  I never had that option, except in the summer, with the other children, so I fight for time home whenever I can.  Another reason is my health.  I have some kind of autoimmune disease.  I've been to 4 different specialists and they can't seem to agree on anything.  I have constant back pain, sciatica, restless legs, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, acid reflux, and an asortment of aches and pains that come and go as they please.  I've taken a ton of meds.  Pain killers don't do much, maybe it's because the pain is so bad it would take too much to help it.  I don't like to be a whiner.  I really try to be as positive and upbeat as I can, but sometimes I just want to cry.  That explains the antidepressants I also have to take.  My dr. has been helpful, but she is just as baffled as I am.  Sometimes I really do think it's all in my head, but she assures me that it isn't.  That's kind of a twist, usually you hear about drs. who think you are making everything up, but mine believes me, she just doesn't know how to help me.  We keep things like blood pressure and cholesterol under control with meds, but I still wonder if there is something we just haven't figured out yet.  A few weeks ago I had a terrible kidney infection.  We treated it with strong anitbiotics, but as the infection got better, I felt worse.  It turns out I have a kidney stone.  It's lodged in the kidney, but could move out at any time.  I will have it checked again in a couple of months.  If it gets any bigger, I could have a hard time passing it.  AS of today, I feel pretty good, but my back is nagging, my ankles hurt if I stand too long, and I have cramps.  That is actually a normal day for me.  I don't remember what it is like to not be in constant pain.  So, you can see why I like having a day off once in a while.  I do enjoy teaching, though.  I am looking forward to next fall.  I'm hoping to have my own class again and I'm looking ahead to lessons plans, etc.  I want middle school, but may end up staying in second grade.  Either way I am excited.

      So many ups and downs in my life.  I took the two older kids out job hunting on Monday.  Jacob filled out 4 applications.  Sarah only filled out 1, but it was for the pet store.  She would love to work there!  She may try vet offices, too.  Jacob hasn't been feeling real well this week, so that may affect his search.  We got bad news that we can't qualify for a parent loan for his education.  I knew our credit was bad, but I had hoped we could swing it for him.  We are reevaluating his education goals.  He may have to commute for the time being and work on the weekends.  I hope it works.  I asked my brother to cosign a student loan, but he declined.  I'm a little frustrated because I had done so much for him when he was growing up.  I don't ask for favors very often, so had hoped he might be willing to help out.  He wouldn't have had to pay anything because I have every intention of paying it myself.  I guess our best course of action is to get relief from our bankruptcy.  I mailed out the information the lawyer requested and hope she can make things happen.  If that works out, then we can afford to pay tuition and even get him a usable car.  He will still need to work to pay his personal expenses, but that would be ok.  Sean is also looking for a different job.  He is interviewing at a couple of places today.  I'm a little nervous about his leaving CB because it is a known quantity.  I like the company for the most part, but he's been under a lot of pressure lately.  I would only want him to change if it means a definite improvement in finances and/or work conditions.  The kids have been driving me crazy!  They just sit around the house.  It would help if they had jobs.  I almost feel like trying to get a job just to get out of the house myself.  I am looking forward to school starting.  I'm anxious to set up my classroom.  I have a lot of ideas and am looking forward to trying them out.  This is a hard summer, but I think things will get better.

      Sarah started summer school this morning.  It was strange taking her to school and everyone else was just sleeping.  There seemed to be quite a few kids, a lot of them looked like the rougher sort, so I hope she does ok.  Last week the kids and I went down to Alabama to stay with my mom while my dad went to Portland to pick up my sister who is moving in with my parents.  My mom and I had to drive into Atlanta to pick up my dad's car from the long-term airport parking.  The trip went pretty well except for the part where my mom accidentally got off the interstate when the lane ran out instead of moving over.  She still talks about how harrowing the experience was.  It really worked out ok because we met up again at the rest stop as you enter AL.  She doesn't venture too far from home by herself much, so I guess that was pretty exciting for her.  We had originally planned to stay through Sunday because I wanted to go to my Dad's church, but we left early so Elizabeth could have the guest room.  I have mixed feelings about Liz's coming.  I'm glad to see her, she is my sister, but I really don't care for her life style.  I feel like my parents put up with a lot from her, in fact they almost seem to encourage it!  When my brothers and sisters are around I don't feel like I fit in with my own family.  It's very strange.  The only other real issue bothering me right now, besides how we are going to survive this summer and get Jacob off to college, is Sean's career.  He could go to a different restaurant in a second, but is that what he really wants to do?  I know he's getting very frustrated at work right now, but if he leaves this job, I would rather see him do something completely different.  Unfortunately, he would have to start so far down the ladder, that we probably couldn't survive financially.  I'm trying to trust God to take care of us, but it gets awfully hard sometimes.

      It's been awhile since I've updated.&nbsp; This has been a strange summer.&nbsp; Sarah went to summer school the first 3 weeks and Jacob started college on June 28.&nbsp; He hasn't been able to get his driver's license yet.&nbsp; Here in Stanford they only do the driving test on Thursday afternoons and he has an important class at that time.&nbsp; This has resulted in my having to take him to a drop off point every morning to catch his ride to Lexington.&nbsp; He also needs to be picked up every afternoon.&nbsp; Then, if he works, I have to take him and pick him up when he works.&nbsp; It will be nice when he can drive on his own.&nbsp;&nbsp; He's doing well in school, but sometimes I feel like I'm always going to have to be there to hold his hand.&nbsp; I have to sit with him when he does his homework.&nbsp; I don't mind most of the time, but sometimes it is frustrating because he wants to do it on his time table, not necessarily mine.  Last weekend some friends from Idaho came to visit.&nbsp; It was nice to spend some time with them.&nbsp; Sarah was especially happy since it was her best friend and mom who came.&nbsp; They spent the weekend in Louisville at the six flags park.&nbsp; We all went to see Spiderman 2 on Friday and out to dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp; A nice change of pace.  Tomorrow I'm leaving for Pensacola, Florida, for an ABEKA seminar all week.&nbsp; I'm looking forward to it, but am a little concerned about leaving my family.&nbsp; It's probably good for all of us if I am not around.&nbsp; Maybe they will learn how to look out for themselves.&nbsp; Sean has 2 days off while I'm gone and works day shifts the other 2 days.&nbsp; He'll be able to make sure they get fed and Jacob gets to school and work most of the time.&nbsp; Jacob needs to work out transportation for Wed. and Thurs., but other than that it has all come together amazingly well.&nbsp; So much so, that I believe it's something I am really supposed to do.&nbsp; I'm working on getting ready for the school year, but haven't been able to do much in my room yet because the other teacher needed to move her stuff to the other campus.&nbsp; They were going to do that today, but now it will be after the Florida trip before I can get up in my room and start putting it together.&nbsp; That gives me a week.&nbsp; I'll try to get it done as soon as I can so I can concentrate on the curriculum and getting the kids their school supplies.
