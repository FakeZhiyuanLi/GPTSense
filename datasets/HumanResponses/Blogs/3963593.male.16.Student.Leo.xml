      Today I went to Fiesta Texas with Tim, Regan, and Peter.&nbsp; I personally had a great time, and would do it again in a heartbeat.&nbsp; We ate breakfast at Rudy's and started the trek around 8:00.&nbsp; We got to the park at 10:00, when the park opened and hit the rides.&nbsp; Because it was Tuesday it wasn't too bad of a crowd so the longest wait was about twenty minutes.&nbsp; The only problem I had was that I was almost too TALL for some of the rides.&nbsp; Now I've heard of people being too fat, but too tall? Well the first ride, Superman Krypton Coaster, the shoulder harness hit my shoulders so early, it was hard&nbsp; to buckle the safety strap, and when I got it buckled, it was cutting into my shoulders.&nbsp; Then the Poltergeist the lap restraint hit my lower thighs instead of lap, so they had to have like two people pushing down on it forcing it down on my legs so they could buckle the safety strap.&nbsp; The Rattler was similar, the lap bars weren't too comfy, but it worked.&nbsp; The best part of the trip was when we rode the family slide like four or five times in a row.&nbsp; We kicked ass on that ride.&nbsp; On all of the banks the tube would go all the way up the wall, and then some, it was awesome.&nbsp; I finished off the day with the last run of the Rattler for the day, and I got me a Jon Deere shirt, I think I'm country/redneck enough to wear it.&nbsp; We got home late, and I got in trouble because I never answered my phone when my parents called, because I couldn't hear it.&nbsp; discipline aside, I had a great time, and it was a great adventure to have one of these outings with just a group of friends, everyone would do it sometime.

      I watched him take the two strike call: He hadn't tried to swing at all. I guess he'd had all that he could take, He walked away, for goodness sake. His father's voice was loud an' mean: "You won't amount to anything."   That little boy quit tryin', He just walked away. There were teardrops on his face. Tell me, how would you feel? You'd probably give up too, If nobody believed in you.   That old man said: "One more try, "I know I'm not too old to try. "I promise, son, I'll do my best, "This time, I'm gonna pass the test." "Give me the keys, Dad, an' get in." His father never drove again.   That old man quit tryin', He just turned away. An' there were teardrops on his face. Tell me, how would you feel? You'd probably give up too, If nobody believed in you.   We take His name out of schools. The lawyers say it breaks the rules. Pledge of allegiance can't be writ, An' under God, should not be said. I wonder how He will take. I just pray it's not too late.   What if God quit tryin', He just turned away? There were teardrops on his face? Tell me, how would you feel? You'd probably give up too, If nobody believed in you.   Tell me, how would you feel? You'd probably give up too, If nobody believed in you.   This is one of my new favorite songs.&nbsp; It's touching and shows how important to have someone support you in what ever you do.&nbsp; Without motivation it is hard to do well in anything.&nbsp; I think the saddest part in the song is the part with the old man.&nbsp; I don't know why, but I guess it was the music video that did it.&nbsp; The son looked so mean, and the old man looked so sad, it just got to me.&nbsp; The other sad part is the beginning with the little boy.&nbsp; I've played little league, and I'm thankful that my dad or coach wasn't that way, if they were I'm not sure how I would have turned out.&nbsp; Joe Nichols is officialy my favorite country singer, if you haven't heard of him, look him up, his songs are great.

      Some people have commented on how great of a poem the last was, so&nbsp;I'll try it again.&nbsp; This one won't be as emotion filled, but I'll do my best to make it good.&nbsp; (You may wonder why I call the poetry entries as spill, this is because I'm spilling all of my emotions on the screen for everyone to view and interpret themselves).   -MISTAKES   I'm sorry to lead you down this path,  The path with no truths,  Never ending in it's curves that trick and deceive.  Overwhelming in the untrained eye.   A missed chance, all it was,  The opportunity was there,  But I didn't answer your call.  Are jobs more important than true friends?   In a time of need,  I couldn't support one of the people that needed the most.  Instead I obliviously turned my head,  And gave the cold shoulder, without a thought.   Back in touch,  Discussion is necessary to clear this problem up.  You may not realize, but the effect is great.  To make others happy is second nature.   A mistake, that's all it was.  To forgive and forget, however,  A task that sounds so simple, is seemingly impossible.  You may not mind, but in troubled eyes, it was only a mistake.   -zack g.   &nbsp;

      I'm not sure what I'm feeling, but I feel like I need to get something out, so I'm gonna try my hand at poetry.&nbsp; Some say I write good poems, I'll take their word for it, but this won't be thought out, I'll just put down whatever comes to mind.   -UNSCATHED   Feelings, thoughts,&nbsp;such confusing topics,  especial for the simple adolescent mind.  Like fireworks a euphoric explosion sends you upward,  But the hope is suddenly destroyed with a fiery explosion.   One knows that everything comes to an end,  But why?&nbsp; It never started.  The chance was evidently never there,  However, hope and emotion blocked the evidence,  As in shrouding it in a cloak of darkness.   Hate doesn't exist,  Only confusion, frustration, unable to understand.  How is the game played? How does it work?  Questions no one can possible answer,  Only answers can be experienced.   Many styles, strategies,  Not a single alike, everyone's different.  As a flock of birds, many look identical,  Yet all different in evident ways.  Each does what it needs to survive.   friendships begin, but don't end,  Nothing like it on this earth.  Life is only similar,  Life begins, and ends on earth,  But the end is only the beginning in an unknown paradise.   Each bump is only temporary in the road of life.  A wreck can be fixed,  But only to an extent.  Petty things don't matter,  I'll go through the flames unscathed.   -zack g.

      I've been getting into the Hannibal Lecter movie series.&nbsp; I find these movies very interesting, and a breath of fresh air from other scary movies.&nbsp; It is very intriguing how they are made, it seems like it's inviting you to help solve the crimes.&nbsp; They make you want to think about what's going to happen next, which very few movies make you do.&nbsp; They aren't really what I would consider a horror movie.&nbsp; The scare doesn't come from something that jumps out at you, but the way it unfolds.&nbsp; There is a sort of creepy sensation that you get when watching it that it can really happen, but it's just far fetched enough to know that nothing like that could possibly really take place.&nbsp; The most recent, Red Dragon, is the perusal to the Silence of the Lambs.&nbsp; This is my favorite of the three because it very effectively shows&nbsp;Lecter's intellect rather than his savage side.&nbsp; It shows that he wants to help, but is stubborn enough to make the agent think, instead of giving him all of the information he needs.&nbsp; This is what makes the movie so exciting.&nbsp; The Silence of the Lambs is the original movie, and is very similar to Red Dragon.&nbsp; It shows the same type of intellect and mind set of Hannibal Lecter, but portrays him more of the villain.&nbsp; It is still a great movie.&nbsp; The third and final, Hannibal,&nbsp; Lecter is the sole villain in the movie, witch is very unsatisfying because you miss out on a lot of intellect that I love about his character.&nbsp; The ending is suitable, and leaves kind of a cliff hanger to allow for you to create your own ending.&nbsp; I think more movies should be made like these.&nbsp; A kind of trip out of reality, that seams like reality in sorts.&nbsp; A dramatic thriller that invites you to help solve the mystery as it unfolds.&nbsp; If you don't like scary movies, this is a rare exception, I believe that everyone should see at least one of these films.&nbsp; Hannibal Lecter is the greatest cinematic character ever introduced.&nbsp; It would be hard to create another so flawlessly.&nbsp; Good evening Clarice....Till next time.....

      We go out to a party somewhere  The moment we walk in the door  People stop and everybody stares  She don't know what they're staring for   She don't know she's beautiful (never crossed her mind)  She don't know she's beautiful (no she's not that kind)  She don't know she's beautiful  Though time and time I've told her so   There she goes just walking down the street  And someone lets a whistle out  A girl like her she just can't see  What the fuss is all about   And she don't know she's beautiful (never crossed her mind)  She don't know she's beautiful (no she's not that kind)  She don't know she's beautiful  Though time and time I've told her so   Morning comes and her hair's all a mess  That's when she thinks she looks her worst  It's times like this she don't know why  I can't take my eyes off her'   Cause she don't know she's beautiful (never crossed her mind)  She don't know she's beautiful (no she's not that kind)  She don't know she's beautiful  Though time and time I've told her  She don't know she's beautiful (never crossed her mind)  She don't know she's beautiful (no she's not that kind)  She don't know she's beautiful  Though time and time I've told her  She don't know she's beautiful (never crossed her mind)  She don't know she's beautiful (no she's not that kind)  She don't know she's beautiful  Though time and time I've told her so   I like this song.&nbsp; It gives me a feeling of hope in some weird way.&nbsp; It has a good tune, and reminds me of some girls I know.&nbsp; The main reason I put the lyrics up is because Jessee asked me too because I told her the song reminded me of her.&nbsp; I didn't only say this to flirt, but there is also a lot of truth in the comment I made.&nbsp; She just is realizing that she is a beautiful person inside and out, and I greatly admire her for that.&nbsp; I hope more people can realize this as she did, the world will be a much better place.&nbsp; People will be much more happy and confident.&nbsp; Have a nice day.

      This is about my friend Tim.&nbsp; He's going after this girl named Christine that we work with.&nbsp; I give him my support, but I do have a few problems with it.&nbsp; First, she's way out of his league, maybe he can charm her enough to convince her to give him a chance, but I'm not sure.&nbsp; I don't know her very well because she is afraid to talk to me because I "scare" her with my size.&nbsp; This leads me to believe that she's kind of shallow.&nbsp; Tim is as well though, so I'm not sure what to make of this.&nbsp; He's already asked her out to the movies, and as I see it, she turned him down lightly by saying that she "doesn't like the movies".&nbsp; Since this He has reportedly sent her $80 worth of flowers, and has big plans to take her out on an extravagant date.&nbsp; Here's the plan:&nbsp; Start out by taking her to breakfast at IHOP, then taking her to Six Flags for the day.&nbsp; At Six Flags he will pay for her admition, any food, drink, games, or souvenirs that she desires.&nbsp; At the end of the day the plan is to take her to a nice restaurant (ie: Gumbo's downtown) where he will let her get whatever she wants off the menu, and he will pick up the tab.&nbsp; Although it is a nice gesture to do this for her, keep in mind that this is their first date.&nbsp; In my eyes he's trying to impress her more with his money more than a charm and personality.&nbsp; I know many girls that would rather see how much the guy cares for her than have him blow hundreds of dollars trying to impress her.&nbsp; Tim, like I said, you have my full support, but please take what I have said into consideration.&nbsp; I hope this helps Tim, and maybe some others, listen to my words of wisdom (although I have never had a girlfriend, I've done a lot of thinking, and questioning).&nbsp; Till next time..... I have nothing else to say.

       urlLink     I enjoy looking at this pic for obvious reasons. I find it funny, and so do many girls, which I find surprising. I would think that many would be offended by this, they they find it hilarious. I guess the find the attention to their breasts is inescapable, so they just make a big joke about it. The only problem about shirts like this, or shorts that have things written on the butt, if you comment on them the girls that wear them get all pissy, and yell at you for staring at their boobs or ass. Can someone please explain this? Words are such a mish mash of these symbols that we call letters that naturally draw the eye, and then if it says something funny like this one feels compelled to comment. If you hold yourself back, you feel like that u have un finished business, but if you do comment you are at risk at getting yelled at, unless the girl is cool and laughs because she got the article of clothing to be looked at, and that's how it's supposed to be. I guess some people don't get this. People can be really stupid. &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    To be honest, im not sure what to make of my last blog, so I'll just lighten the mood with another photo.  I dont think I'm fat enough to wear one of these shirts, but I still think its a great idea.  Fat people are always funny, and I can say this because I am fat (not obese, but overweight, but I'm mostly muscle, well, kind of, just drop it).  Although many may say that anorexia isn't a problem to joke about, I think and act for myself, and I say it's a great and easy topic to poke fun at.  If you are offended by this because you are an Olsen twins fanatic, go away, I don't want anyone who takes things too seriously reading this any way.  Until next time, I have nothing to say.&nbsp; urlLink

      The goal I've set for myself for this junior year of high school is to have a true girlfriend by the end of the year.&nbsp; If not, I have decided that I will declare myself a failure at being a guy.&nbsp; This doesn't mean I'm gonna turn gay, or totally give up, just that I won't be happy with myself.&nbsp; Right now I'm not even sure who I have a chance with, or who exactly I would like to have as a girlfriend, I guess it's kind of one of those "I'll know when it happens" kind of things.&nbsp; I really like Jessee, but I think all I've really got with her is a friendship.&nbsp; Each time I see her she looks better, and I really like her company, she actually listens or at least pretends to listen to what I have to say.&nbsp; Sometimes I feel like I would like to go to the next level with her, and I sometimes think of what it would be like, but I've decided that it would probably never happen for a few reasons:  1. I'm too shy around her and other girls, although after a while I open up, but it doesn't do much for first impressions  2. I'm not catholic  3. Our personalities are different, not worlds apart, but not dead on matches  4... Well... I can't really think of other reasons, but I know that they are there, I just can't think of it.  I'm gonna keep having fun with her, or at least I plan on it, and I'm gonna do my best to stay in the game, and fulfill my resolution as a junior.&nbsp; I have a car, I have a good chance of making the varsity football team, I make good grades, and Monica says I'm a gentleman (I'll take her word for it).&nbsp; Nothing's stopping me besides myself, wish me luck.

      I got rice cooking in the microwave  Got a three day beard I don't plan to shave  And it's a goofy thing but I just gotta say  Hey I'm doing alright   Yeah I think I'll make me some homemade soup  Feelin pretty good and that's the truth  It's neither drink nor drug induced  No I'm just doin alright   Chorus:And it's a great day to be alive  I know the sun's still shinin' when I close my eyes  There's some hard times in the neighborhood  But why can't every day be just this good?   It's been fifteen years since I left home  Said good luck to every seed I'd sown  Give it my best and then I left it alone  Oh...I hope they're doin' alright   Now I look in the mirror and what do I see?  A lone wolf there starin back at me  Long in the tooth but harmless as can be  Lord I guess he's doin' alright   Chorus   Sometimes it's lonely  Sometimes it's only me  And the shadows that fill this room  Sometimes I'm fallin'  Desperately callin'  Howlin' at the moon...Ahwoo!Ahwoo!   Well I might go get me a new tattoo  Or take my old Harley for a three day cruise  Might even grow me a Fu Man Chu...Oh Aww!   Chorus (2 x's)  -Travis Tritt, It's a Great Day to Be Alive   I like this song, and just felt that it would be good to post it.&nbsp; If you haven't heard this song listen to it.&nbsp; Even if you dont like country, it will put anyone in a good mood.&nbsp; This is one of the songs I take to explain my live and personality.&nbsp; I try to be in a good mood, even through the hard stuff, and I don't sweat the small stuff.&nbsp; I hope everyone can relate to this song in some way, if they can't, I'm sorry that they are incapable of being truly happy.&nbsp; Think about the words of the song,&nbsp; I hope you can see yourself in it.&nbsp; Till' next time.....

      I went to the RR Express game with Dan today, and a couple of people I've met only a few times.&nbsp; I was just expecting just kind of the norm, either sit around, and watch the game without much happening, or go wild and have a great time.&nbsp; I never know what to expect really, but either way I have a good time, and I was happy to spend time with him because we haven't hung out much over the summer.&nbsp; It ended up to surpass my expectations, and I had a great time.&nbsp; For some reason it was a little easier to break the ice tonight with people I don't know very well than it usually is.&nbsp; I'm not sure if this will be a trend, or something just happened.&nbsp; Any ways, we had a great time and I cant wait to do it again.&nbsp; It seems sometimes that I have mediocre expectations for things that end up being great.&nbsp; However I love to go to the games and hang out with my friends, and sometimes make new ones.&nbsp; I wish I can do stuff like this more often.&nbsp; I also went mini golfing With Jess and Monica the other day, I had high expectations, but I had a feeling that I would screw something up or break the mood in some way.&nbsp; There were some awkward moments, but I think it was good practice for the future, and I personally had a great time.&nbsp; The trend of this story is obvious, but its also important to me.&nbsp; I love having fun with friends, no matter what the setting, or who they are.&nbsp; These past two days have been great.&nbsp; I hope that it can continue.&nbsp; "These are the best days of our lives, these are the days worth living, don't let these days slip away" -some song I heard today, not sure on the words, but it gets the point across.

       urlLink    (The sign says "SPEED LIMIT ENFORCED BY AIRCRAFT") I know that they are cracking down on speeding, but this is rediculous. I do, however, find this pic amusing. Im not sure if its ben doctored or if its real, but its fun none the less. But assuming that it is real, why would they use a military helicoptor? Maybe this was taken in Iraq, I dunno.&nbsp;&nbsp;More to come...&nbsp;untill then, go away.&nbsp; urlLink

      I haven't been typing much, so I figured that I should give an update. I just got my license and I've been driving all over the place, and having a blast. I no longer work at Pancho's due to football and school. I'm kinda happy to leave but I made some good new friends so it's bitter sweet. Yesterday I hung out a Jessee's house for most of the day. I had a good time, got to finally meet Sadie and Zsofi. We played video games, and did cross word puzzles, but there were some times that were quiet where there was some what of an awkwardness, but in all it felt right. Today I went to Matt's and just played video games the whole time. We also went to lunch at the Frisco Shop with his dad, who is the coolest person I know, and we just talked about Napoleon Dynamite. I saw Napoleon D. with Tim on Tuesday, and it was easily one of the greatest movies ever made. I was surprised at how it depicts the troubles of high school, and shows how everyone can relate to the most unorthodox person they have ever seen. It was the only movie I've seen this summer, and it was great. After lunch, Matt and I went back to his house, and we talked, and looked at my truck. We decided to take some stickers off of the back window, and this proved to be more challenging than we thought. The tint was placed over the stickers, so now I have this square in the back window that doesn't have any tint at all, it's so awesome! Summer football practice is almost over, all we have left are one practice a day, and it only lasts for like an hour and a half and a scrimmage on Saturday, then school starts. I wish the summer can be longer, but I'm excited for school to start, it's another bitter sweet type of deal. That's it for now, rock on..... till next time.......

      I finally got it!!!  My '82 f-100 pick up no longer just sits in the road next to my house.  The day of my birthday my dad picked me up from football, and we went directly to the DPS and got my license.  Then we went to grab a bite to eat at Sonic, and it just so happens that the Sonic was next door to the little resteraunt that my parents were getting food at when my mother went into labor with me exactly 16 years earlier, that was just kinda cool, and mind boggling to think about how cool of a coincidence it was.  I've been driving for a few days now, and I already feel realy comfortable behind the wheel.  I crank up the stereo and go speeding down the road.  I do my best to keep at the speed limit, but it's always fun to break the rules a little, but I stay cautious.  So far I've only driven to work and football practice, so I still need an excuse to go out for the hell of it just to hang out with friends.  O ya, and also today, I went to Magnolia Cafe today with Tim.  That was good, but I couldn't finnish my food,  two eggs, four triangles of toast, spanish rice, and two GIANT pancakes is a lot of food!  Any way, today I finnished my last day of work at Pancho's, and I'm glad it's over, but still kind of sad, because I had a great time with all of the new friends I made there.  I hate bitter sweet emotions, it's hard to know what to feel.  Well, thats it for now... more to come.

      Ok, so 2 a days started today. These are two, two hour practices with only a 45 minute break in between. I like to play football, but these practices almost make you not want to do it. We started the practice with weights, so we could get good and tired before we did anything. We went on the turf, and it was so damn hot! Today was the hottest day of the summer, and the next two days are supposed to top that. I have a shot a varsity this year, and I'm not sure about the outcome, I'm what they call "on the bubble", but I would say I have a good chance at making it. So, for now I get all of the privilege of varsity, but I'm not on the team yet. I went to Chipotle after practice, and I think I'll do that almost every day, I love that place! The coaches tell us that we need to eat a lot when were resting, I don't have a problem with that, but I'm trying to lose weight, so I'm trying to eat healthy. Also, it's almost my birthday, only three more days till I can drive! My truck is ready to go, and right after practice my dad will take me to get my license, I can't wait! I've run out of stuff to talk about, so I'll go for now.
