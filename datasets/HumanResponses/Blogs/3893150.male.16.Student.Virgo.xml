      so yesterday was pretty cool. my friends, Bartlett (Devon) and Reynolds (Jeremy) came over. we sat around, watched Boondock Saints and discussed the many ways to make and eat a PB&amp;J. also had a nice discussion on how kids today are not as innocent as kids were when we were kids. I personally think it started with Super Mario Bros. 2. what a fucking trip, you have to be a savante to finish that game, without going insane, that is. but it's true. the worst thing we had as kids was Mortal Kombat. nowadays, kids have The Suffering, Manhunt, Max Payne, GTA. certainly not bad games, but still..kids are getting desensitized...which isn't a good thing. but whatever, I'm sounding a little too grizzled for a 16 year old. later that night, we met up with my other friend Farrell (Andrew) and played some water frisbee, sans Devon. good times. for the next three minutes, I have to help my dad with our cabin..it's finally getting taken off the stilts it's been sitting on for 12 years and put in a foundation. so I'll be working on that until saturday evening. it's my punishment for not having a job. better than flipping greasy cowheads all day I guess. I guess thats it for now.

      ok...so my week consisted mostly of watching movies and playing vice city. I spent the wonderful day with Claire last wednesday so we know that. but yeh...I had some movies rented, so I watched them. one a day for five days. good-ness. watched Dazed And Confused, Up In Smoke, Half-Baked, Game Of Death and Boondock Saints. and some others on TV and what not. now, prepare for a little spiel here. it's taken me quite some time to see Boondock Saints. came out in 1999. I've heard about the movie for a while, from random friends from forums and reading threads about it on IMDb. I'm kicking myself now for&nbsp;not seeing it sooner...one of the most stylish movies I've seen since I first seen Kill Bill. so well shot..everything about it I loved. Willem DaFoe owned, as usual. he's one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. so versatile. also seen Spiderman 2 tonight, with claire and some of her friends. I'd say it lived up to the hype and everything. not extremely polar-opposite from other superhero movies, but it was developed well..with the Peter/MJ love struggle thing and what not. good times. the third movie is gonna be cool, although I think every Spidey fan in the world is waiting for the movie with Venom and Carnage and all those cool cats. yeh...maybe that's it for now? claire is leaving tomorrow. thats sad...but she should be back soon. hopefully. tata, internet stalkers.

      just spent the day with one of the best people in the world, Claire Barbour. honestly, she is one of my favorite people in the entire world and I'm a better person having met her. we sat around all day, talking about everything, catching up. we went for a walk out around, watched The Neverending Story with subtitles in Spanish. one of the best days I've ever had.

      driving today, I swirved into the other lane and almost took out some lady in a silver Windstar. I was staring at a fat lady having a yard sale on the side of the road, dressed in her pyjamas. hicks fascinate me way too much.

      OK so this is my first post in my new blog. well, I suppose I should get to the personal bs.  I'm a 16 year old kid from Newfoundland, in Canada. I'm pretty normal for my age, I think. I like watching movies, playing frisbee, hanging out with pals and the occasional pinner. as far as movies go, I'm a big Quentin Tarantino fan. love all his stuff. I like the LOTR series, Trainspotting, Kevin Smith's stuff, The Godfather: Part 2 and The Goonies. music..favorite bands are the Misfits, Queen, Talking Heads, The Clash, Alexisonfire, Dropkick Murphys, Gwar and Radiohead. that it? I think so.  that should be ok for now. I'll update again when somethign interesting happens.

      friend o' mine, Katie, had a party. close to 20 people in a very cozy house. smoked some cannons and hotboxed a bathroom. watched Enemy At The Gates with my dill pickle-lovin' compadre Reynolds. what did YOU do last night?  PS: I have a new AIM with no one on it. jacktheworld13. add me if you're reading this.

      so last weekend, it was family-o-rama. went to my grandparents house and spent some time with relatives who were home for a visit. it seems as though every person I've ever known that moved away was home this summer at some point. didn't get to see all of them, which was a bummer. anywho, family time all last weekend. picked up a couple books when I was out there, too. Bankok 8 by John Burdett. about a cop in Bangkok who witnesses the murder of an American marine and his partner. big conspiracy, who-can-you-trust thriller. damn good. well, I got home that sunday, just chilled out monday. Tuesday, me and Reynolds went swimming and we smoked up. good times. chilled out on my own the rest of the week. whole lotta PS2 and movies went down. Friday, went out with Bartlett, Reynolds and Shauna. met up with Farrell later on. smoked a doober around 12, hung out at a playground, being high fools for a couple hours. didn't do anything over the weekend. maybe swimming later tonight...maybe not.  on a sidenote, I have this sick fascination with trash TV that comes on really late at night, roundabouts 4 am here. shit like Jerry Springer, Elimidate...it just makes me laugh. I'm glad there's fools like this to keep me occupied during the wea morning hours.  this summer has flown by. I have a supplementary math exam one month from today.  gotta start studying for that sometime soon...within the next couple of weeks, for sure. fuck man....my last year of high school. never thought I'd see the day. King Of The School, baby! hah...not likely. I guess that's it for now. it being 4:35 in the PM, I should probably get dressed and showered soon. chow.
