      The blog is blue now!  Jim- stellar.  I'm lovin' it.    I WISH JACOB WOULD GET ON AIM!!  HE IS PROBABLY ASLEEP, THOUGH.  KEEPS TALKING TO ALL OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS ON AIM.  You do not understand what I am saying.  Ni bu meing pei, wau shaw shan-ma.  (My own version of romanization, not Yale or Pinyin or Wade-Gilles.  Call it Miryin.)    Gathering of the Yomen.  Quetzalcoatl.  Merry Christmas.  Happy Easter.  Have yourself a merry little Christmas.  If I had just one tear rolling down my cheek, maybe I could...(forgot the words).  A Lesson in Whinfamy.  Mwahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah.  Saxamuffin.  Fellytone.  Affy tapples.  Cadillac tears.  Iguana paste.  Casa Blanca.  Elleanor Roosevelt.  Cadillac bridge.  Wau bu meing-pei, wau shaw shan-ma, and that's the truth.  Lexis.  Battle of New Orleans.  In 1814 I took a little trip, along with Colonel Jackson down the Mighty Mississip.  The battle was slow at Custer's last stand.  North to Alaska, goin' north, the rush is on.  K, enough Johnny Horton already.  Save our souls.  Jim wants a burnt orange car.  He has good taste.  G'night.

      MMBC blog is not sick.  It is mostly just odd stuff that sounds like it is saying, "I know that I just walked home with you from summer school and then talked to you on the phone for three hours, but I really miss you.  We have to do something together tomorrow.  Are you sure there are no movies to see?"  Yes, I know, very messed up.  We are very odd.  Well, that blog is back to life.  It has had many posts on it.

      Whit got her French horn and it is awd.  I don't think I want to know what the MMBC blog is, really.  Too disturbing, I bet.  I was actually really happy to go to band and see people... I was getting sick of spending all my days jumping at chances to ride along to discount stores and correcting people's grammar.  (The people whose grammar I was correcting where getting sick of it too.)  It was nice seeing so many people... school folks, though many of them I haven't met... but will at the high school.  People, I am not a Mir... well actually I am.  Whatever.  Kaitlyn, I want you to give me lessons on engaging in conversation with people you don't know if you have time this summer.  Seriously, I need it.  Especially before high school.  Have fun at the convention!

      I am posting a ton of stuff in hope of being able revive this awesomely dead blog.  Well, I guess, It is not as dead as the fluff blog or the Tipic blogs or the MMBC(PPSFABTOJCIY) blog, man, that thing is really, really dead.  Well, I must go and try to revive the other blogs. Also, Mir, I didn't know you could have band practice in the summer.  I am really board right now.

      Great, the horrible plague is spreading.  I miss school. Not the homework or gym, of course, but the being able to talk to friends in the morning, and at lunch, etc..

      Hello everybody. Mir, I deleted the kimo thing or whatever it was that you put - it was screwing up the sidebar thing. Sorry. If you want to put it back on, then at least put a space between the kimo's so it does not screw up again.  I have an idea how to fix Kat's problem with Jacob - it involves Mir. I will stop there. Sorry if I just offended anyone there. (Jacob doesn't count)  Oh, by the way, MOW!

      I am keeping myself busy, so as to keep myself from getting all sappy about leaving the middle school.  It's working so far, and I just made up a list of my summer goals and priorities.  Hum-dee-dum... let's see here  1. Complete Pimsleur "Mandarin I" course with basic understanding of the spoken language 2. Learn more about history and international affairs and economics. 3. Train for cross country. *4. Get Whitney in shape. 5. Make some money. 6. Spend more time with family. 7. Quit fighting with Whit  *8. Convince Dad to let me be a foreign exchange student in high school 9. Begin writing a story and add to it daily.  *seemingly near impossible, but I'm not giving up hope  I've talked to Whit, and the M-exercise! program kicks off tomorrow.  Whit's goal will be to get at least an hour of aerobic exercise each day.  We will start out in 15 minute chunks with relatively undemanding types of exercise and build up.  I'm thinking of starting her first chunk tomorrow on tap dancing.  This is a very important goal of mine, since Whit really does need to get into shape.    Any-hawase, I've got to go now and find a site on foreign policy or something.  See you in a jiffy! (The party tomorrow, that is.)

      I miss school.  Maybe I can get Mr. Jeter to assign me some homework.  His was the only homework I truly enjoyed anyway.  I hope to see many people from school this summer.  I am really currently in denial still since it feels like a weekend and I just had homework two nights ago.  I MISS SCHOOL!!!!!!  MIDDLE SCHOOL!!!!!!!

      Also, I love the new web page!  The blue and white is so much more appealing than the black and gray!  (It WAS black and gray, wasn't it?  I can't be sure, what with my messed up and discolored monitor.)  It's swell!!!

      Sweet blog!  I love the contrast between the lettering and the background.  Black and white- very high-definition.  Anyways, yeah.  YOU PUT THAT "FISH FACE" PICTURE ON THE INTERNET!!!!!!!  AHHHHHH!!!!!!  Seriously...  Thanks.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Hmmm... David won't answer me on AIM.  Hum-dee-dum, why don't I just go to bed?  Because I'm on a birthday cake sugar high, that's why.  Anyway, WHY DID YOU PUT THAT ON THE INTERNET???  Ahhhhhhhhhhhh, thank you for choosing such a very flattering picture.  Right.  Well, I am tired.  I was just watching a speech Reagan made in '87 on TV.  It was sort of interesting, I 'spose- must've been, since I watched the whole thing.  But now you see what happens to a person when they don't have cable channels over 25 (except for 76, 77, 78, and 98.) Seriously, you are so lucky!  You get CMT!  Gosh, I don't want to go to bed, but I don't want to be tired for church, either.  Can't lose, can't win, can't never do either.  Swell.  Ah, I'm tired.

      After 4.5 long hours, still have not fixed it so I can make this blog show up on the main page, much less let everyone have their own avatars. I am just going to put major information up on the main page and all the information on here. And no, I did not sleep last night.

      I hope to figure out how to intergrate this blog with the main page except I most likly won't have avatars on there then :( - this also means that this blog will be down for quite awhile.  Someone know how to do that?

      The JNeumann.com version 3 (which is really v2.5) is online. See it  urlLink here . I will not keep the alpha build up after I make it the main site, but that is still 5 hours away.  I will also not create a new post for every new build - I will simply comment on this post.

      Ahh, I do not have the heart to ramble on right now, but I love the Chinese.  I wonder if Jim will ever figure out what it means.  Did we already tell him?  If so, I doubt if he remembers.  Mir, COME BACK ON!!!!
