       Well, the buddy list actually has a scroll bar on it now, so Caravan people must be back :-P.  Ahh, band camp begins tomorrow.  I don't care what anyone says, Band Camp is way fun... especially if you're in the drumline.  We *know* how to party... especiall when Tyler is trying to act black, which is often, and always hilarious.  I'm gonna miss all the graduated seniors though... Allison, Matt, Jason, Bjorn,  you guys were great.  Thanks for the fun times (and the duct-tape-the-sophomore-to-a-tree night).  I finally wrote down my life story... it's not that long, only 11 pages, but I didn't go into detail so that I'd be able to share it w/ people... and my life's only been interesting since 9th grade anyway... yeah... :- It's now been 3 months since I began dating Mandy... and what a great 3 months those have been... Mandy, I love you, and I always will :-)  School starts in what, 2 weeks? And it's on a Wednesday too! WTF is up with that?  That means we might actually have to do something on that Friday... gross.  So yeah... it's Sunday.  Mandy's in Minn., Laura's in Colorado, my dad's in Baltimore, it's been just me and my mom *shudder* since Thursday.  Today has been especially boring... I watched Deep Blue Sea for the 3rd time in as many days.  Of course, the Red Sox never make it on TV around here, so I can't even watch those games. *sigh*  Oh well... I can smell food cooking downstairs... so I think I'm gonna go eat.  Nic  Mood: Bored, but happy. Music: Politik (Coldplay)

       Well, I didn't post yesterday cause I was really busy, so this is a compelation of the last 2 days.  Went to the doc to check and see if I had lyme disease... thankfully I don't.  Then today, I had to go and check in for band and such at school... yuck... I have to go to school next week for band camp... yeah, laugh if you want, but apparently the band camp members are good at sex ;-) (yes, I finally saw American Pie and American Pie 2).  Well, school is starting on a Wed. this year... that blows.  But oh well... I still get to be a senior and get out 5 or 6 days early.  I'm getting way excited for school to start though.  I get to see all my friends again, I get to see Mandy every day (God, that will be wonderful), and it'll be my last year.  Plus, there's drumline season (and the football games, I guess...), band (which I don't care what people say, it's still fun), the choir trip to Flordia, etc. al.  Now if Mandy's ex would just stop being annoying... life would be wonderful :-)  Well that's about it... I'll leave you all with this.   I saw a sunflower growing on the freeway today.   Yes... a real, honest to goodness sunflower... growing right up out of the cracks of an overpass on Hwy 218.  I did a double take when I saw it... or at least, as much of a double take as I could while passing it at 70 mph.  It had grown a couple of feet out of the ground and was as big and bright and perfect as any sunflower could ever hope to be.  As I watched the brave little flower that was determined to hold it's own in the cruel world of concrete, metal, and exhaust that some wayward bird had no doubt left it in, I thought about the children's book "Hind's Feet on High Places."  There was a little red poppy in the story that grew from a crack of a mountainside.  As a seedling it had been left there by it's enemies to die... but because it chose to forgive them and love them, it found the strength and the will to survive and flourish in that barren and desolate home.   Sometimes I feel like that sunflower and that poppy.  I've been dropped into a harsh and cold world.  The environment I live in isn't the environment I was created for.  It's so hard for me to remember that the only way I can survive in this world is to let the love and forgiveness of Jesus Christ give me the strength and the will to survie and flourish in the alien world we call Earth.   I'm so thankful I passed that little sunflower today.  It's picture is etched in my mind as a constant reminder that I was not made for this world... but by God's grace I have been equipped to live in it.

       Well, today was pretty boring overall... my leg finally stopped oozing... it was pretty "cute" (as my mom put it) earlier today.  I got to talk with a good friend I made at the Waterloo Community Playhouse for a while today... that was pretty much the highlight of my day.  I'm in the process of finding a new NFL team I like... not only have the Vikings drafted a former WWE superstar in Brock Lesner, but now rumor has it they are moving to LA in 2007... not cool.  I know Mandy's vote on the matter (the Bears) and Chris' (the Chiefs) and Laura's parents (Packers... *vomit*)... but gimme your ideas :-)  That's about it for me... at least for today.  Hopefully a bunch of us are gonna go see the early show of I, Robot tomorrow... so let me know if you're interested.

       Well, today was a pretty damn decent day.  I finally got me one of these lil' Blog thingies, so now I can actually write down what I do and what I'm thinking and such... and then others can read it too.  Yesterday, after church, I basically sat on my butt, it being the first day in 3 weeks without me having to concentrate on the play... then Mike and I went out for Chinese, ice cream, and then we rented Blue Collar Comedy Tour and watched it with his parents... which was humorus in itself, listening to Carla (Mike's mom) laughing harder at the whole thing than we were... wow :-P  Today - My mornings are always boring, filled with chores and stuff... you'll find this a common factor over most of my Blogs... Went and picked up Mandy at 1, came back to my house, and just hung out and talked for the first time in 2 weeks.  She's been gone at Girl Scout camp, and I've been busy with The Buddy Holly story... God, I miss that.  I miss all the people from the play, all the fun times we had, and just the experience that I had while I was there.  If you ever get a chance to act or perform in a play or a musical... jump on it.  It's a great time.  I got bored tonight, so I went and joined Mike's church league softball team, which was exciting.  Church league, and Mike still gets mowed down at the plate by some stupid base runner... the guy got ejected though... and I've forgotten to slide since I played baseball 3 years ago and cut my leg up nice.  I'm glad that my "family" is all back in one place again... but sadly, Laura is leaving us again on Wednesday... going on vacation... and then Mandy is leaving on Saturday to go on vacation... and so I'm  either hanging out with Mike, or going to band camp... *blink*.  I don't really wanna get into detail about how my leg hurts, so I'm just gonna go change the bandages on it.   Mood: Mellow Music: Jainy (Five for Fighting)
