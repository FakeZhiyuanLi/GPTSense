      So I was reading this article the other day about modern day protests, and I screamed!  What the hell happened to real protests and real protesters!  This article (find it on CNN) discussed how modern day protests are now scheduled into peoples daily lives as an aside.  Whatever happened to the days when a protester woke up at dawn, went to the protest sight, protested all day and into the night, went home, ate, slept, and then came back the very next day to do it all again!  Now it's "hey I have 30 minutes left on my lunch break, I’ll go to that protest, then go back to (work/school)"  UGH.. COME ON PEOPLE!  Actually grow some balls and be devoted to a cause!  Put some actual effort into devoting yourself to a cause and make a bigger difference.  I'm sorry but our society has become too detached from the events that it needs to be attached to and it's pissing me off!  Ugh.. I need a big closet to shove all those dumb-ass non-committed people into, along with all those terrible parents!  So my point is this.. don't you dare tell me you are an activist if you spend only the time convenient for you protesting! True activists are ones that put their cause before all else, they are the ones that make a difference and really care about what is going on in the world!

      Wow, thinking about it I have a ton of stuff I can write about.. so I shall begin..  I said I wasn't cheating then I began repeating.. I said I wasn't cheating then I began repeating...I said I wasn't cheating then I began repeating...The abundance of redundance flooded her head...And she said "If I'm leaving with a broken heart...You're leaving with a bleeding nose."...Look out man 'cause here she comes yeah...No no no...I think she knows what happened at the part yeah...No no no...Did you really sleep with that chick man...Yes yes yes...Are you gonna tell her straight up man...No no no no...I said I wasn't cheating then I began repeating...The abundance of redundance flooded her head....And she said "If I'm leaving with a broken heart You're leaving with a bleeding nose."...This is the last time you'll see me...Check your mood ring 'cause I'll bet it's green...Check our cash flow and I'll bet it's low...Hey how was the party last night honey...No no no...Oh it wasn't bad I saw a fight honey...No no no...I bet that wasn't all you saw now was it...Yes yes yes...Stutter stutter I couldn't quite slip it...No no no no...Check your sex toys, check your playboys...Check all your things yeah...I bet they’re destroyed...Cause I'm a jackass - Jettingham - Cheating  I love this song! It had been in my head all day, so I figured I should post the lyrics.  Ahh.. such a good song... such a great warning... hehe.  I used that line once.. it's a great line.. he laughed, until I punched him.. hehe.. ;)  So today my mind got to thinking, why is it girls suck?!  I'm going to start wearing my "Girls Suck" T-shirt more often!  So as some of my closest friends know I am currently having drama with one of my girl friends.  There was a time when I considered her one of my best friends, but now I'm not sure she ever was.  This entire drama that is occuring has shown me how immature and attention seeking she is.  I have talked to someone that has shown me that with all her guy friends all she wants is the attention and that she doesn't really care about them.  He made me realize that she doesn't want me hooking up with this awesome guy that I am seeing because she would thus lose his full attention, and she wants nothing more than just his attention.  Ugh.. she is being so self destructive.. She's gonna have her life get fucked up like mine did in high school, but hell we all have to learn sometime right.  Hopefully she'll come out of this with a better understanding of herself and a whole bunch of apologies to the guys she is treating this way.  I don't know if our friendship is going to be salvaged, and right now I am not sure that I want it to be.  If she can not respect the fact that I am REALLY into this guy and if she can not back off, then I'm not sure I want her around me. I'm sorry but I don't like the guy I'm seeing being felt up by another girl because it is a GAME to her.. I would rather she be feeling him up because she wants to sleep with him and ME!  But hell I digress.  I just hope she watches herself and realizes what she is doing. k.. I have said my share on this and don't feel like ranting anymore.. planning to move on to better issues!

      Well I have finally crossed into the techie world... Peer pressure made me do it man! Seeing as this is the very first post it should be original, unique, something that sets the standards for the following posts rather high. Hmmm.. where to begin...   And on that note we cue the music... My boy lollipop, He makes my heart go giddy up, He's as sweet as candy, He's my sugar dandy I love him, I love him, I love him so, and I just want him to know that I'll never let him go,  Oh.. My boy lollipop....  Music is a huge part of my life as most people come to realize.  And as you can probably tell from the current song that is playing in my head things are going well!  Yes I have met a new boy, one that I like quite a bit!  I will say that he and I have so much in common it is frightening in a good way.  And amazingly I did something I didn't think I would do.. I stopped dating the other guys I was dating.. They are so supportive it's awesome...hehe.. but more to come on that later... So back to music.. well as most people know I am terrible at naming songs and artists, but I can recite the lyrics to thousands of songs after hearing only the first few notes...so it's a gift and a curse.. haha..LOL... I just recently spent this past weekend at Hully Gully and Dungeon dancing to some very nice industrial/goth music..and plan to go dancing at Dungeon again this weekend.. Some of my friends are taking me to a club on friday night which should be a ton of fun.. I am looking forward to it.. Well my brain is beginning to hurt.. a sign that I need to do something a lil more fun.. So my synopsis...     Dating realm- very nice, having an excellent time with one man (yeah he's not really a boy,hehe)    School - going well, although very stressfull, remind me why I am enrolled in 5 classes and work full time!?    Work - going good, most of the kids are sick... ugh..     Friends - have a few rough patches to fix up but in time, in time... Well I am off to dream of fangs and velvet.. where is my vampiric man when I need him...

      Come what may, I will love you until my dying day!  Well this week was interesting.  I stressed over an assignment that I thought was going to be discussed in class, come to find out it wasn't... bah!  So the weekend has been pretty good so far.  Friday night I went to the Block with Becca, Mike and one of Mike's friends.  We had a yummy dinner at Cafe TU TU Tang.  We walked around the block and when we became bored we went home. It was alot of fun... I love hanging out with Becca!  Today was a good day, I slept in which wasn't good and missed the teacher recruitment thing.. but I plan to go to the one at school, so no worries!  I met up with Dave and Becca at the Aquarium, we had a lot of fun walking around the aquarium and playing in the rain.  Becca got soaked, silly girl!  We had a yummy dinner at this yummy mexican restaurant, very yummy salsa!  I'm gonna have to take Nathan, Will and Mauro.  Missed going dancing with Bryan last night and tonight, bah...meh... hopefully he and I will meet up soon!  So that is my weekend thus far. Tomorrow I plan to pick up my spikes and visit Nathan.  It should be a fun day.  As for my rants I have several things I want to discuss, however, Becca and Dave are still here (watching Moulin Rouge) so I will not be rude and will write them later.  Hope all have had a fantastic weekend in the rain.. ummmmm I love the rain! urlLink

      Current Status: And the rants begin.. FURIOUS!, yes furious is the word for it.  Parents are driving me insane! If I could I would lock all those parents in a closet and throw away the key!  Case in point, Austin's parents have been sending him to school with a fever over 100 degrees!  Yet they say that he is fine and doesn't have the flu! UGH WHATEVER! Someone please donate a closet!  So this and many other issues that I will rant on about over time lead me to one of my major goals in life... PARENT LICENSES. Yes that is right parent licenses.  In order to become a parent you must hold a parenting license. To obtain a parenting license you must: complete courses regarding child care, education, overall knowledge of how to raise a child etc; pass a live child test in which you must take care of a real baby for 1week to 1 month; a written exam; and lastly a psychological exam. You do all this and pass and you get a license to procreate/adopt.  Those people that can truely take care of a child in all realms with no form of neglact will thus pass. This will thus make me happier and provide for a much smaller closet to lock the dumb ass child neglecting parents into.  It's been a real eyeopener how many children are neglected on different levels. It really breaks my heart. K.  I will continue this later, because it is starting to get to me.  I must add that my close friendships are going very well right now! Surprisingly I have not disappeared off the face of the planet yet!  It's been 3 months now!  LOL... I have been making an effort to call and chat with EVERYONE I know and I am happy that this blog is out there to keep everybody up to date, just in case they haven't heard from me in a couple of days, especially if I fall off again, but with the current situations I don't think that will happen any day soon.  (Should any of you have anything to say let me know, I'm interested in your opinions  )  K.. I am needing to read for class so here I shall end.. Until I feel like typing again.. ;P

      As you'll come to see these pages will reflect not only the inner workings of my mind but also a recap of my daily hijinx. This past weekend was quite fun!  My recap is as follows: Friday, the end of a long work week!  Austin had been suffering from the flu all week and had went home early almost every day.  So, Friday I needed a chance to be around healthy people!  I visited my aunt Leigh, since she had recently came home from the hospital.  She had phnemonia and is doing better although it is killing her that she had to give up pot and cigarettes! I told her she should bake more.  LOL I swung by the McDonald's car show to pick up flyers.  They are having a cruise for two cruisers that were badly burned while working on their classic in their garage.  Ok people not to be mean, but this is why I say "Work on your cars in a WELL ventelated area or better yet out doors!"  I do wish them both a speedy recovery and am glad that they are participating in the shows despite their pain.  After that Will and Mauro picked me up and took me to Hollywood.  We ate at this really yummy, small, quaint, italian restaurant on Sunset.  They had this excellent wine which we didn't get the name of, but ah it was good!  We then headed to Circus. Oh so many gorgeous men!  I had my fill of eye candy!  The club was fun, although very hot.  I had an excellent time with the boiz.  Will and I are very depressed that Nathan was unable to partake in the fun.  He said he had blah, blah, blah. Yeah like that is more important, sheesh. Will and I were crushed and hardly found the will to dance. Saturday, My parents were gone for the entire weekend so I was able to sleep in! Ahh it was soooo nice.  I spent the day relaxing then took off to Jacki and Jud's house.  They took me to Red Robin for my belated b-day dinner, very yummy southwest salad... I recommend it!  We went back to their place and watched the last of the Kings game - they won 2-1.  Yippeee, see I am their good luck charm (so who wants to buy me season tickets, LOL)  Around 10pm I took off because I was SUPPOSED to meet Joy at my place for a trip to Dungeon.  But Joy is a punk and is deathly sick with the flu.  So being bored and debating if I should go, I got online... A friend was on that should have been at work.. Conversation was "Dungeon" "K, be there shortly" LOL  We arrived at Dungeon at the stroke of midnight, the place was packed!  I danced my bootie off, ran into Bryan, danced my bootie off some more. By the time I left I must have weighed 10 pounds less! I had a blast and many of my fav songs were played so I definitely enjoyed my evening there.  Afterwards, I grubbed at Denny's, went home, and died.  I slept oh so well, it was great.  Sunday, Slept in a lil, my parents came home.  I spent the entire day in my pjs, hehe.  Worked on laundry, homework and chatted with friends.  Didn't do too much because my body really hurt, but in a good way. hehe So as you see my weekend was very fun!  I was bummed that I didn't get to hang out with Nathan or Joy, PUNKS! LOL And there you have the weekend wrap up.

      At first I was afraid, I was petrified, Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side, But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong, I grew strong, And I learned how to carry on, and so you're back, from outer space, I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face, I should have changed my stupid lock, I should have made you leave your key, If I had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me, Go on now go walk out the door, just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore, weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye, you think I'd crumble, Did you think I'd lay down and die,  Oh no, not I, I will survive, as long as I know how to love, I know I will stay alive, I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give, and I'll survive, I will survive, It took all the strength I had not to fall apart, kept trying hard to mend, the pieces of my broken heart and I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself, I used to cry Now I hold my head up high, and you see me, somebody new, I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you, and so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free, now I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me, Go on now go walk out the door, just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore, weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye, you think I'd crumble, Did you think I'd lay down and die,  Oh no, not I, I will survive, as long as I know how to love, I know I will stay alive, I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give, and I'll survive, I will survive So as most of you may or may not know this song has been my mantra for quite some time.  It is a rather empowering song, don't yah know.  It has gotten me through quite a lot of crap, boi related and otherwise.  Today I was thinking about it again. Not because I am having problems of any sort, actually things are going so well I am about to bust, but because I was thinking of the way music can influence us and help us in times of sorrow. With everything that has  been happening lately we should blare Gloria's song across the world! LOL  But honestly the music I love has helped me deal with all that has been happening and I am glad that I have it!  If I didn't I don't know what I would do...maybe sink back into a bipolar state and cut off all contact thus removing my existence from the world, or maybe I would just go crawl back under my rock. Ok so on to other news...I'm not so stressed over school anymore, yippee.  I still have projects and reports to do, but since I have thusfar been doing well I feel I can accomplish anything!  It's so strange to actually be excelling, ok yes I do remember that I was in the honors program, blah blah blah, but this is different.  I'm not sure how to explain it, it just is.  Oh well I guess I will have to think more on it. Last night was excellent!  Nathan came to see me, hehe. I feel so special.  Have I mentioned that he is rad!  Well he is, and he's tubeular!  He is alot of fun and I had a great time with him, although sometimes I feel like I'm the biggest dork in the world and he's going to realize that I am! LOL  I can not wait for our trip to Vegas next weekend! It is going to be a blast.  Tomorrow is the Kings game (against Boston) I hope they kick ass!  The last game was so Hella good!  GO KINGS!  I'm glad Nathan agreed to go, it should be hella fun. Well I have more I want to write, but I shall begin another post since this one is becoming rather long!  It should be up shortly!  urlLink

      My heart is weeping right now.  The beginning of the war has saddened my heart and has me reflecting inward more and more.  I hope that all will be safe while they are defending our country and that they will have a speedy return home.  My hope is that a resolution will occur without much bloodshed.  A question to leave you with... Will there ever be a day when ones personal religious beliefs will not become a cause for the death of others?  May the gods watch over us all and protect us from death. urlLink

      So they have taken me away.. far, far away to a place where I am about ready to kill people for their lack of intelligence!  BAH...So much is on my mind, yet I haven't the fondest where to start my rant from...Hmmm should I start on those idiots that feel they own the freeway and drive 40 freakin miles an hour in the fast lane, or maybe those people that think that they can just cut in front of you, in traffic, and give you a dirty look instead of a friendly wave to show thanks.. Ugh people suck!  And then computers suck.. mine has been killing me all evening.. I am about ready to take it to the mountains and go "Office Space" on it! So on to my weekend wrap up...  Well I stayed up late last night... I'm back to my old habits again... sleep, wake up, sleep, wake up.  Take last night for example...I crashed somewhat early, like 1am or so, and I kept waking up because the heater was on and cooking me to death.  By the time this morning came I was nude and still burning up!  Oh well... I digress, like anyone cares that I was nude.. haha... ok so today was a beautiful day. The weather was outstanding, I went out to Riverside to see Nathan, and the whole way there I was amazed at how beautiful things looked. If only So Cal skies looked like that every day. It would be heavenly.  Speaking of heavenly, I spent a great deal of time with a dreamy boy. I must say I rather enjoy spending time with Nathan, he is a rad (yes rad) guy.  (I could digress here, but I'll spare you all, if you really want to know then ask me!)  We met Will and Mauro for Coldstone and shopping at the mall. Can you believe I didn't buy anything!  What a change, although we did go into VS and I found quite a few rather cute things I wouldn't mind owning.   So the evening ended after a nice goodbye to Nathan and now I sit here in front of my malfunctioning 'puter. Wishing I was still in Riverside, rather than here in too much homework land. LOL. Bah, next session I am not taking 5 classes!  Oh well .... I should go back to my readings.  I will hopefully find time tomorrow to add to the blog.. If not expect something within the next couple of days.   Oh yeah.. must find sex convention....awesome show.. must look into!

      The War - I am so numb!  This whole situation is tearing at my heart.  How could anyone kill their own people, has the world really gone down the tubes?  I hope that the gods have a greater plan that they are working through because I can’t fix everything. :(  Life goals - I’m still so torn over the rest of my life.  So many times I wish I was back in UCR during my Freshman year. There were no worries, I had no real cares and the future was so far away.  Now I need to be an adult.  I love teaching, but I have no confidence in myself as a teacher.  I keep doubting my abilities and thinking that I am going to be a terrible teacher and that I will end up not teaching my students anything.  It is such a huge responsibility to educate our youth and I want them to know everything and be able to understand that which most people don’t want them to.  Carla keeps telling me that I will be a fine teacher, but I still have my doubts.  I guess when you come from the thralls of mental abuse you tend to doubt yourself more than others.  Overall though I am happy.  Things in most realms of my life are going well.  I am so looking forward to my trip to Vegas with Nathan this weekend.  It will be very nice to get away from my regular life and be able to enjoy his company.  And I’m gonna finally see Gladys Knight, yippee.  So I have done so much reflecting in my life lately... I am trying to get most of it put to paper.  More for a help to my soul rather than as an update for my friends.  I can finally say that life is good and will only get better. :)

      If life is a bowl of cherries, I’ll take two.  You say you love me You say you care But when I call You’re never there You say they’re just  A passing phase Something to pass The time while you wait You say you love me You say you care And now I’m here Completely yours My heart is open But all you wants Behind closed doors You say you love me You say you care My heart is bleeding You cause the tears You break it down And seem not to care I’m just your play thing Nothing more You plan to break me Even more You say you love me You say you care I only want to have a clue As to what you want to do Do you want to be lovers Or friends that F*** Or do you just want To break me and toss me off I need an answer sometime soon As to what you want to do You say you love me You say you care 11/11/02  The above like all my other work reflects where I was at the time I wrote it.  It’s funny how my perspective on a certain friend of mine has changed so much in the last 7 years.  I have finally let him go and I’m not sad.  I realize that I was being used and that real true friends do not abuse each other.  I still love him and care about him and I have finally accepted the fact that things will never work out between us in the way we once thought.  So I’m wishing him the best in his life and hoping that we will remain close.  I hope that those few friends that read this blog know how much I care about each of you.  If I didn’t I would not have given you access to a page that contains so many personal and private thoughts.  As most of you know I’m not one to share all the details of my life and most people mistake this as my being a bitch.  I’m not, well anymore, LOL.  There are a lot of things that I did in high school that I regret now, thank god most of you didn’t know me back then...LOL. Thank you to the Catholic church for creating the sad child I once was.  Currently I am trying to be a better friend to those individuals that I care about and I try to let each of them know how much I love and cherish them and their friendship.  SO DAMN IT I LOVE YOU ALL!  And you know that I don’t use the phrase “I love you” all that often.  So on to the phrase I love you.  I had the strangest dream the other night.  I’ll describe it here, but I’m not going to try to translate it.. I think the meaning will come in time.  So I was with a boy in this dream.. I’m not sure who he was, I didn’t see a face.  But his voice that I did hear and it was nice and deep.. Hehe.  Well anyway, he and I were describing all the things we like about each other to each other and in the middle of his description he threw in the words “I love you.”  Well, I didn’t know how to respond in the dream so I just continued to listen and decided not to comment on it.  The dream continued with he and I having a very deep conversation about life and the meaning of friendship.  Yeah, it was another one of those dreams, hence I’m not thinking about it too much yet.. Once spring break comes though I will!  So anyway, I thought this was interesting, considering I don’t usually remember my dreams. If you have an interpretation of the dream let me know. :)

      War - A price we must remember... The accident brought the total number of coalition deaths to 23 -- 14 Britons and nine Americans. In addition to the death in a grenade attack in Kuwait, two have died in combat, and the rest were killed in accidents.  - May they find their way to the eternity.  My heart and prayers go out to those who have lost their lives in the fight for freedom and to their families and friends. urlLink

      Songs from a good album Garth Brooks - Unanswered Prayers   Just the other night at a hometown football game  My wife and I ran into my old high school flame  And as I introduced them the past came back to me  And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be   She was the one that I'd wanted for all times  And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine  And if he'd only grant me this wish I wished back then  I'd never ask for anything again   Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers  Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs  That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care  Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers   She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams  And I could tell that time had changed me  In her eyes too it seemed  We tried to talk about the old days  There wasn't much we could recall  I guess the Lord knows what he's doin' after all   And as she walked away I looked at my wife  And then and there I thanked the good Lord  For the gifts in my life   Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers  Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs  That just because he may not answer doesn't mean he don't care  Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers   Some of God's greatest gifts are all too often unanswered...  Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers   ------------ A song that keeps things in perspective.  Have you ever prayed for something and promised God for something.  I know I have.  We are so involved in circumstances that we don't see the full picture.  I am very thankful that God has not answered many of my prayers the way I asked for.    I stopped asking for things in prayer a long time ago.  Now I am a thankful questioner.  ------------ The Thunder Rolls  Three thirty in the morning, Not a soul in sight, The city's looking like a ghost town On a moonlit summer night.  Raindrops on the windshield, There's a storm moving in. He's heading back from somewhere That he never should have been.  And the thunder rolls. And the thunder rolls.  Every light is burning  In a house across town. She's pacing by the telephone In her faded flannel gown.  Asking for a miracle, Hoping she's not right. Praying it's the weather That's kept him out all night.  And the thunder rolls. And the thunder rolls.  CHORUS The thunder rolls, and the lightning strikes. Another love grows cold, on a sleepless night. As the storm rolls on, out of control. Deep in her heart, the thunder rolls.  She's waiting by the window When he pulls into the drive. She rushes out to hold him Thankful he's alive.  With all the wind and rain  A strange new perfume blows, And the lightning flashes in her eyes, And he knows that she knows.  And the thunder rolls. And the thunder rolls.  CHORUS  ----------------  Always loved this song.  First time I heard it was during a storm.  Hearts filled with thunder... hum... familiar.  --------------- Friends in Low Places  Blame it all on my roots  I showed up in boots  And ruined your black tie affair  The last one to know  The last one to show  I was the last one  You thought you'd see there  And I saw the surprise  And the fear in his eyes  When I took his glass of champagne  And I toasted you  Said honey we may be through  But you'll never hear me complain   'Cause I've got friends in low places  Where the whiskey drowns  And the beer chases my blues away  And I'll be okay  I'm not big on social graces  Think I'll slip on down to the oasis  Oh I've got friends in low places   Well I guess I was wrong  I just don't belong  But then I've been there before  Everything's all right  I'll just say goodnight  And I'll show myself to the door  Hey I didn't mean  To cause a big scene  Just give me an hour and then  Well I'll be as high  As that ivory tower  That you're livin' in   'Cause I've got friends in low places  Where the whiskey drowns  And the beer chases my blues away  And I'll be okay  I'm not big on social graces  Think I'll slip on down to the oasis  Oh I've got friends in low places   I've got friends in low places  Where the whiskey drowns  And the beer chases my blues away  And I'll be okay  I'm not big on social graces  Think I'll slip on down to the oasis  Oh I've got friends in low places   I've got friends in low places  Where the whiskey drowns  And the beer chases my blues away  And I'll be okay  I'm not big on social graces  Think I'll slip on down to the oasis  Oh I've got friends in low places   I've got friends in low places  Where the whiskey drowns  And the beer chases my blues away  And I'll be okay...   ---------------- Great song. So much fun.  hehe, yeah I had tons of friends in low places.. hmmm.. wonder whatever happened to them.  Better not to know I guess.

      I feel I need to make a brief update on my friend situation - Have tried to talk to her since this whole thing happened at the beginning of last month.  Have been given, what I feel to be, the run-around.  I am at a loss as to what to do, and have been for three months now.  I want to discuss things with her.  But what can you do when the other person is avoiding you?  So what do I want to say to her?  Hmmm.. What I wrote in my original letter is all true.  I wish we could discuss things like adults.  My impression based on her behavior was that she was all for me and him getting together.  I am grateful that she introduced us.  I worry about her.  I want her to be happy and to find happiness.  I don't want to see her make mistakes I once made.  There is so much that my current circles of friends do not know about me.  I was a different person in high school and thus have not kept those friendships from my high school years.  There is not much I share about my past with people because I am still trying to figure it out and make sense of everything.  One day I will be able to share, and I have been slowly sharing with those people I feel closest too (and there are not that many).  I hope that our friendship can be salvaged.  Who knows what the future brings. BAH!

      Nathan, I applaud your most recent blog!  Yours is a passion that I wish more people had!   I could not have said it more clearly, "Sadly, civilian casualties are inevitable in any war and this is most certainly true in a nation where the dictator INTENTIONALLY and THREATENINGLY forces innocent civilians into his armed forces and uses them as human shields around military weapons stored in places like mosques, schools, nurseries, and hospitals; the technology possessed by the United States military has kept civilian casualties to such an amazing low that our soldiers and scientists should be applauded for their humanitarian efforts; The tactics employed by the Iraqi military are highly questionable and without honor; Don't stop supporting our men and women abroad simply because things don't go your way. Let's keep the support going and let them know that we appreciate the risks they are taking."  You definitely inspired me!    Hopefully my earlier blog inspired those that read it to think about the war.  We are so detached from it that I think we lose sight of the real meanings and purpose.  If the war were being fought in our own backyard would we have different opinions, feelings, beliefs?  Ask yourself, "Do I ever really think about this?"  I ranted this morning because I have been thinking so much lately.  So I shall answer my own questions and will hopefully inspire you to think/answer them too.  1) Is it really possible to keep civilians safe?  In my opinion absolutely not.  There is no way for anyone to keep all civilians safe in time of war, everyone is at risk.  All that we can do is attempt to harm as few individuals as possible.  There is bound to be casualties in both the military ranks and the communities being targeted.  From our perspective we must try to harm as few people as possible, yet understand that some people will be sacrificed.  From the "bad guy" perspective - Hell they are using their civilians as shields, murdering those that do not conform... hmmm do you really think they have any respect for human life?  2)  Is there any army that can target an enemy without killing an innocent?  No.  There are bound to be "accidental" deaths.  Technology can limit the number of deaths, but it is inevitable, someone is always "in the wrong place at the wrong time" so to speak.  3)  Can things be done differently? Hmm. This is a tough one.  Things can be done differently, but everything in life can be done differently.  It is my hope that things are being done in the best way possible.  I have high faith and hope in our military and most of our leaders.  If I didn't I never would have wanted to join in the first place!  Who am I to say what should be done, I can only try to see every side of the issue and understand it.  4)  Organized massacre, is it really needed?  Ok this was not a question created by me, I actually read it on another web page and it struck a thought.  Ever read Animal Farm, The Lord of the Flies, If you have you will notice that war is inevitable.  There is always a clash between groups and a war to follow.  We must realize, accept and work to better ourselves and the way in which we kill.  I know it is brash, but honestly I do not think that in my life time I will see peaceful resolutions to 100% of the conflicts in the world, there is always going to be war and bloodshed to some degree, we can only work harder to limit it.  So remember to support those that are fighting for the freedom that we all take for granted.  Keep your thoughts open and your hearts warm.  Remember that we are the lucky ones and we should never take that for granted!

      BAH!  I must rant before I leave for work.  Is it really possible to keep civilians safe?  Is there any army that can target an enemy without killing an innocent?  Can things be done differently?  My deepest sympathies go out to those innocents who have been killed in this moron's war.  May our troops come home safe, we have lost too many already!  Organized massacre, is it really needed?  Support our troops and pray for their safe return! :-(

      Alright, Nathan's blog was so thorough, but I do think he left a few things out.  First, Nathan thank you so much for joining me on this little adventure.  I will definitely remember this trip!  I hope to make future arrangements with you for places just as fun.  On to my recap additions:   Thursday - I felt terrible for being a bit late for dinner!  I absolutely hate non-moving traffic!  Nathan's mom is a wonderful cook, I loved the peppersteak!  I had a wonderful time talking to Nathan and his parents.  It is amazing what you can learn about a person based on their interactions with their parents.  The stupid action... well I too will not tell about it, so don't ask!  Nathan it was still fun and no matter what everything will be ok. Friday - We woke up late because we went to bed late, I believe it was 1:30am.  Nathan is a great driver (otherwise I wouldn't let him drive my car) and we made excellent time into Vegas.  Ok, I admit, I was wrong about the check in time, but I do remember saying "I think it's 12 and 2."  Sheesh, he's so picky. LOL.  We did kill time and had a free meal though so it wasn't that bad.  *cough*Get over it*cough* ROFL  I'm thankful that Nathan is such a good sport and an undisputed gentleman!   Nathan have I told you how unbelievable you are?! ;)  Thank you for dealing so well! I promise next time he won't be there!  Now back at the room I think Nathan meant to say that he collapsed onto the bed and slept.  I'm not sure that is classified as killing time.  LOL.  Gladys Knight was superb, I too recommend the show!  After the show we went back to Paradise Garden for dinner, then back to the room to change and "rest" before heading to an empty Fremont Street at about 2am.  The intoxicated lady was great! She had me so entertained.  Nathan, thanks for sharing the thong story! :)  Now honestly was the kiss purely for entertainment, I believe you enjoyed it too.  hehe.  No blackjack tables sucked, but it was great all the looks we got from everyone... I'm telling you they were all envious!  We arrived back at the motel around 3:30 or 4:00 and went to bed.  I think we finally fell asleep around 6am, I remember the sun being up.  I wish we would have watched the sun rise over the desert... hmmm lets keep that in mind for next time. Saturday - Nathan, do you recall going to sleep at 6?  If so then it makes perfect sense that we woke up at 11:30!    Well the gambling was bah!  Nathan, you were supposed to be a good luck charm ;)  I guess I do need to admit that I did not do too badly with you there next to me. hehe.  It wasn't bad playing, just an absence of lady luck!  Might I add that Nathan of course fell asleep while we were preparing to go to Becky's party! LOL.  (Nathan have I mentioned that you sleep too much, hehe)  I agree, Kahunaville is a excellent place!  Erin totally rocks.  Now I must say here that Nathan ruined my game!  I took Erin a piece of B-day cake as a ice breaker.  When I turned around who do you think was standing right behind me!? NATHAN! Bah.... I couldn't work my thang with him there!  How dare he! LOL.  Nathan we must plan a return trip to Kahunaville soon, and this time let me handle it! 'Cuz I know if you weren't right behind me I could have had her at the motel after her shift.  Now back at the hotel room I did decide what I wanted to do and did do part of it!  However, I also wanted to go dancing, but Mr. Sleeps-alot was not in the mood. ROFL.  So we stayed up for a bit talking about some things and then crashed around 2am. Sunday -   The last of our trip was upon us, it did not last long enough!  I would have loved to spend a couple more days in Vegas with Nathan.  I must say that by rubbing my arm softly you will not get me to wake up... that only relaxes me more!   *cough*before 9am, I told you*cough*  egg McMuffin, yummy!  We made great time home and the scenary was great.  K the hot girls were ok... The baseball cap one was brunette not blonde.. sheesh you would think he would remember.  And I agree they were all very hot, but not as hot as me.. hehe.  I did stay at Nathan's parents until about 4pm and I made it home in 35 minutes.  I spent the rest of the day working on my computer and trying to relax.  Nathan thanks for going with me and for being so cooperative ;-)  My father sparked an idea in me... I am now thinking about moving to Vegas.  It is looking more and more like a possibility. hmmm More to come later on this though... I still need to think about it.

      WOW!  Vegas was a definite experience all thanks to Nathan.  I must say I had a lot of fun. I wish I would have won some money but oh well.  Luckily I have this week off from CSUDH, so I plan on using the time wisely.  Hopefully I will be able to hang with friends that I haven't seen in a while and also catch up on some work. BAH.. I'm tiredish.. I think I'm gonna go watch a dvd....Did I mention War sucks, Bush is a moron, my dad is an ass.. hmm I think that covers it... for now.

      Son of a Preacher Man - Dusty Springfield   Billy-Ray was a Preacher's son,  And when his daddy would visit he'd come along,  When they gathered round and started talking,  That's when Billy would take me walking,  Through the back yard we'd go walking,  Then he'd look into my eyes,  Lord knows to my suprise:  The only one who could ever reach me,  Was the son of a preacher man,  The only boy who could ever teach me,  Was the son of a preacher man,  Yes he was, he was, oh yes he was.  Being good isn't always easy,  No matter how hard I tried,  When he started sweet talking to me,  he'd come tell me everything is alright,  he'd kiss and tell me everything is alright,  Can I get away again tonight?.  The only one who could ever reach me,  Was the son of a preacher man,  The only boy who could ever teach me,  Was the son of a preacher man,  Yes he was, he was, oh yes he was.  How well I remember,  The look that was in his eyes,  Stealing kisses from me on the sly,  Taking time to make time,  Telling me that he's all mine,  Learning from each others knowing,  Looking to see how much we'd grown.  The only one who could ever reach me,  Was the son of a preacher man,  The only boy who could ever teach me,  Was the son of a preacher man,  Yes he was, he was, oh yes he was.   What a great song... If I am in an upcoming talent show I think this is what I will sing.  Men suck!

      Well I took Becca out to celebrate her new found independence.  We had a great meal at Rocky Cola!  Have a fun time being girls.. hehe.  K... I have a rant.. Hmmm reason why I keep my circle of friends rather small.... because people tell you one thing and then do another!  This totally pisses me off!  I can not stand it when someone says, "Wanna do this?  I'll call you."  And then they never call.  So you are left thinking... hmmm did they really mean it or did they just ask to get off the topic?  I FUCKING HATE THAT!  If you say you are going to call, email, text, im, etc then FUCKING DO IT!!!  Bah. You don't know how much this bothers me!  So I am debating cutting this person off for a while.  Hmm. Haven't made a decision yet, but I am a bit hurt!  See this is why I fall off the face of the earth. BAH.. ok.. I have ranted... I am going out. Fuck this waiting shit, this person is becoming "not worth waiting for"  K.. I have waited, ranted... now it's time to get piss ass wasted.

Well I am glad that it finally happened.  Good for her!  Ok.. Austin.. I must rant about him.. He is driving me nuts.... He keeps trying to elope.. We are getting ready to lock him in the closet. And Friday is Jump Rope for Heart.. Oh gosh...... I am not looking forward to it.. I can see him now.. UGH.  Well I am still stressed about life but what is new!  My comments on the issue of the war.... Well let us not get too cocky or ahead of ourselves until we know for certain that the madman is dead!    K.. I am not really in a talkative mood this evening. So I am going to go... Have a pleasant evening... Go get laid.

      K.. time to add to what I wrote Sunday.     Last week was probably one of the most stressful of my life.  I had to make a decision that I never thought I would ever need to make.  I was still confused by my answer, not sure of it still.  But I had a very wonderful discussion with Nathan that made things easier.  On Sunday I received some excellent news and hopefully it will be confirmed Thursday.  Through all of this I have learned so much about Nathan and his character.  I am so impressed by how tremendously supportive and understanding he is.  I was so impressed that I have revealed some very personal things to him which I never thought I would.  Funny what trust can do.  So now things are going well again.  I hope it continues to go as such.   The car show was great, we had an excellent turn out and a good 50/50.  Next month begins our twice a month and later hours.  My parents keep telling me that the cruisers want me to host them instead of my mom.  I've been thinking about it... only thing is if I did it for every show I would be losing valuable dating time..hmmm .. .must think more on this.   Sunday started out on a down note... I was thinking way too much.. doing too much reflecting.  I was beginning to go crazy so I called Becca.  She and I met up for the yummy lunch and did some good girl time stuff.  No I am not going to describe the outfit I bought.. only the priviledged will get to see it... if he comes to see me.. hehe.  I love Frederick's sale rack!   Well I must admit that yesterday I skipped my classes.  I spent that time working on papers that were due today.  Lack of focus last week, well we see what it does to me.  But it was nice not to go to those classes!  Tonights classes were excellent and highly enjoyable!  I was even released early, so I was home at 9:30pm.  How cool is that.  There are only 5 weeks left in the semester, ugh... and I still need to sign up for summer school, double ugh.   Well anyway, things are looking up.  Next week Tulita has spring break so I get to sleep in every morning and not go  to work.  I still have classes at DH, but it is not too bad.  It will be nice to get away from Austin for a week! hehe.   Well I have some stuff to do, so I think I shall wrap this up with a thought.  When you look at yourself in a picture do you recognize yourself or do you think you are looking at someone else?

      Bah, CSUDH break is over.  Didn't get much work done.. had too much on my mind.. climbed under a rock.. and visited a cute boy one day.  My weekend was good. The car show was great and I had fun announcing.  Nathan tried to torture me with his arm, but he didn't!  He thinks he made me jealous.. ha the only thing I was jealous of is that he got to drink while I was busy tormenting myself with the thoughts of my stupidity from a week before.  Funny boy.  Today was great, ate at El Torito Grill with Becca, did a lil' shopping, bought a really cute outfit that only a certain someone will end up seeing.  Now I am off.... Will write again when I have more time.. I hate this time change.. I want my hour back!

      Had a moment of hillarity earlier this evening.  During my math methods class I received a call from Darren.  Well after class I called him back. Come to find out he was right down the street at his family home, so I headed over there to say hello.  When I arrived D was working on his garage door.  Well the wire that moves the door was off its track too, this door was having lots of problems... Well we fixed it... and man was it funny!  I thought we would have to call Mr. Fix-It to come help... LOL.  Hey now we can go into a garage repair service!  I guess it is just one of those things where you had to be there.  So now Becca is coming over and she is taking me out to dinner, even though I have a yummy steak waiting for me here.   And speaking of food, I had forgotten how hard it is to give up bread and products made of flour!  I can't eat some of my favorite foods for the next 8 days, but it is a tiny sacrifice.    Anyway. I am off. Oh yeah, it is official, I will be one of the acts at Mauro's talent show. I am looking forward to it, although I am a bit nervous seeing as I have never sung in front of anyone other than my closest friends. I hope I don't throw up... But hey if I do well then maybe I'll audition for the next American Idol. LOL. We'll see.... Patti.. Superstar... hehe.

Oh yeah it is official I am now singing Son of a Preacher Man at the talent show on Saturday, may the gods help those listening. I hope they have enough ambulances to take the people with bleeding ears to the hospital! LOL.  Anyway, I hope that everyone reading this is doing well.. can you tell I don't have much to write about.. LOL.. K so now I think I am going to go.

      K. Nathan pointed out, so nicely, that I neglected to add a Godsmack cd.  So my next purchase shall include. :-)  Been re-reading books I haven't picked up in a while and I even bought a new book.  I decided to get back to that place of peace that I once lived and breathed.. so watch out spiritual world, here I come.

      So I decided to splurge on myself today.  Being on vacation is bad for me... I spend way too much time on the computer. Anyway, here is what I bought: 1)  Disturbed - Believe 2)  Korn - Issues 3)  Eminem - The Eminem Show 4)  Eminem - The Marshall Mathers LP 5)  Disturbed - The Sickness 6)  Korn - Untouchables 7)  Korn - Follow the Leader 8)  Korn - Life is peachy 9)  Gladys Knight and the Pips - The best of 10) Gladys Knight and the pips - the ultimate collection 11) Gladys Knight - At last 12) Metallica - Metallica (my tape has been eaten by my tape player so it needed to be replaced LOL)  Ok. I know, I know.. But I have been wanting these CDs for like forever. I could have downloaded the songs, but I have not been having the best luck with that as of late. So I bought them oh well... It's been forever since I have bought cds.  Anyway they should be here in like 10 days... yippee.. and I didn't spend that much on them.. most were only 3 bucks or free! yippee!

      K. Update on my 4/11 blog.  Well lets just say that the stress of the things occuring in my life had finally gotten to me.  I have talked to my closest friends about this and the person involved and have decided that I was a bit harsh.  Although not doing what you say you are going to do does piss me off like you would not believe.  But I am not going to cut anyone off for not doing as they say.  I shall be a lil more understanding.  I need to stop letting the stress in my life dictate everything..Bah only a few more days until the stress is gone.  But anyway, if my 4/11 rant hurt anyones feelings I am very sorry.   So I've decided to make a list of the things that tend to piss me off. It is rather hard to piss me off but these are the things that can: 1) as stated above - When someone doesn't do what they say.  It pisses me off most when I do this, as I have done a few times.  But I have been working hard not to do this and I expect those people closest to me not to. 2) People that drive down my street at 45+ miles per hour.  Don't they know that there are kids that live here!  Go ahead run into one and kill them, then see how you feel.  Ever seen someone get run over? It's not pretty!  So SLOW THE FUCK DOWN IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD!   3) But when you are on the freeway HURRY THE FUCK UP!  The freeway is for us to get places faster! If you plan to do 30 miles a freak'n hour get off the freeway and take side streets! 4) People that lie for their own gain.  Don't ever lie to me to make yourself get something you want, I will hate you forever, hence my relationship with Northwestern.  I am probably the most brutally honest person.  I lay everything out, even things that I should keep inside.  I will tell you no lies, I expect you to do the same.  And no I don't tell secrets! If someone tells me to keep something personal I DO!!! I don't believe it is my place to tell someone's secrets, let them do it themselves.  But ask me anything about myself and I'll probably tell you. 5) People that abuse the planet.  I love the out doors, animals, well hell I love all of nature.  Don't fucking ruin my planet!  Don't throw your trash out your car window, don't dig up a park to put in a strip mall. Gosh Dang it leave the beauty of nature, stop killing it.   6)  MORONS! Like half of my family and Bush.  I hate bloody ignorant dumb ass people. They bug me. I deal with them, but man do I want to lock them in a closet!   Ok. I know there are a few more. But I need to go to sleep.  I have so much to do tomorrow. It's my dad's birthday and I need to get him a gift.  Good night my friends.

      The Natural Born Killers Soundtrack is the best.. Still need to see the movie. Something I Can Never Have - Nine Inch Nails  I still recall the taste of my tears. echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears. my favorite dreams of you still wash ashore. scraping through my head 'till I don't want to sleep anymore. come on tell me. make this all go away. you make this all go away. i'm down to just one thing. and i'm starting to scare myself. make this all go away. you make this all go way. I just want something. I just want something I can never have you always were the one to show me how back then I couldn't do the things that I can do now. this is slowly take me apart. grey would be the color if I had a heart. I just want something I can never have. in this place it seems like such a same. though it all looks different now, I know it's still the same everywhere I look you're all I see. just a fading fucking reminder of who I used to be. come on tell me. make this all go away. you make this all go away. i'm down to just one thing. and i'm starting to scare myself. make this all go away. you make this all go way. I just want something I can never have think I know what you meant. that night on my bed. still picking at this scab I wish you were dead. you sweet and perry ellis. just stains on my sheets.  Leonard Cohen - The Future   Give me back my broken night  My mirrored room,  My secret life  Its lonely here,  There's no one  Left to torture  Give me absolute control  Over every living soul  And lie beside me, baby,  Thats an order!  Give me crack and anal sex  Take the only tree thats left  And stuff it up the hole  In your culture  Give me back the Berlin wall  Give me Stalin and St Paul  Ive seen the future, brother:  It is murder  Things are going to slide,  Slide in all directions  Wont be nothing  Nothing you can measure  Anymore  The blizzard,  The blizzard of the world  Has crossed the threshold  And it has overturned  The order of the soul  When they said REPENT REPENT  I wonder what they meant  When they said REPENT REPENT  I wonder what they meant  When they said REPENT REPENT  I wonder what they meant  You dont know me from the wind  You never will, you never did  Im the little jew  Who wrote the Bible  Ive seen the nations  Rise and fall  Ive heard their stories,  Heard them all But loves the only engine  Of survival  Your servant here, He has been told  To say it clear,  To say it cold:  Its over, it aint going  Any further  And now the wheels  Of heaven stop  You feel the devils riding crop  Get ready for the future:  It is murder  Things are going to slide ...  There'll be the breaking  Of the ancient  Western code  Your private life  Will suddenly explode  Therell be phantoms  Therell be fires on the road  And the white man dancing  Youll see a woman  Hanging upside down  Her features  Covered by her fallen gown  And all the lousy little poets  Coming round  Tryin to sound like  Charlie Manson And the white man dancin  Give me back the Berlin wall  Give me Stalin and St Paul  Give me Christ  Or give me Hiroshima Destroy another fetus now  We dont like children anyhow  Ive seen the future, baby:  It is murder  Things are going to slide ...  When they said Repent Repent ...  Such great songs.  Well it's a rainy day.  I've already been outside to play.  Wish I didn't need to go to class tonight.. I'd go play some more. hehe. I love the rain.  Gosh I love the feeling of peace.

      Well this weekend was nice.  I must say Thursdays visit was very enjoyable, despite the one little thing.  We took a nice walk to the park and had fun with the waitress at El Torito. hehe.  Friday with Becca was fun.. I even got a ton of sleep!  Saturday was nice even though I was awake at 6am.  Spent the morning relaxing.  Dave backed out of hanging out with me, Becca and Nathan so I took off to Riverside.  Enjoyed the OBF, I love sno-cones! hehe.  Had yummy food at a BBQ, I finally met the famous Jill and Paul.  They are hella funny, I was rolling!  Very fun.  Took a nice little drive, kangaroo rats are cute!  Homewood is a yummy wine!  BoyzIIMen are still cool.  Lets see what else.  Sunday I slept in again, but got to watch a cutie while he slept, hehe.  Have a good conversation, even though I freaked out a bit.  Spent the afternoon and evening with Becca shopping, bought some really tight jeans.  Ran into Jonathan, had him do a reading on me.. boy that kid still knows me.  Went to bed fairly early last night.  Have been doing a lot of thinking.    The old me once would have ran away from my situation, would have abandoned my life and began another only to run from that one too.  I've been doing a lot of soul searching and have finally found peace.  I will not run, I will not hide, I will be strong and not worry about what the future holds, I will live in the now because everything is just fine and will be just fine.

      So over the past several days (and couple of weeks) I have been going through one of the toughest experiences of my life both mentally and physically.  I have been so drained and overwhelmed by this experience that I have neglected to keep touch with the outside world.  Well this weekend was filled with the most stress, but also a lot of fun.  I spent the entire weekend with Nathan, which is becoming one of my favorite things to do ;-).   Let's see... Friday was cool.. I met Nathan in the afternoon for a meeting. Introduced him to Market Broiler.. K apparently I am no longer allowed to choose the restaurant. LOL.  Finally watched the "Fast and the Furious."  Found a cool lil mud puddle at the Metro link, hehe... gotta go off roading...hehe.  Belts are cool.. hehe... wonder what else Chris and Jen think?!  So spent a great time with an awesome guy. ;-)   On Saturday I enjoyed a wonderful Mongolian BBQ meal with Nathan, Will and Mauro.  Will mentioned an upcoming "prom like" event that sounds like fun.  (I went out and bought the "dress that was made for me" today. It's beautiful! I will be getting it on Friday! I can not wait. It is so purty! Yes Nathan it is the one from the mall that we saw!)  Then it was off to the talent show. Well of course I had forgotten my Pulp Fiction cd at Nathan's apartment, so Will, Nathan and I had to run to two different stores to find it.  I bought the collectors edition and gave Nathan the other one. (Sorry Will)  So we then went to the talent show.  I was so nervous!  I am comfortable SPEAKING in front of people but I have never SANG in front of a crowd without someone beside me.  Well I gave the song my all and I made the small mistake of looking at Will and Nathan, so I became even more nervous.  But, I finished the song to a roar of applause.  I did do the Dusty Springfield song I had planned originally.  Well when I was done I couldn't believe the applause.  And the DJ/MC seemed to love me.. hehe.  Well that just made me all the more nervous so I quickly went back to my seat and put my head in Nathan's lap to avoid throwing up.  The other performers were awesome and I thought there was not way I would win.  And Mystique.. oh my goodness.. what can I say.. what an excellent and entertaining performer and damn what a body!  ;-) Oh yeah.. Nathan can not blow up a balloon.. that's funny.. hehe  So finally it was time to be judged and we went back on stage.. I knew for certain that the other talents would all win and I was prepared to clap my lil heart out for them.  Third place was given to the Gloria Gaynor impersonator, second to the Marilyn Manson impersonator.  So it was down to myself and the gentleman that sung a beautiful Spanish song.  I was thinking "that is so great that he's going to win, he did a great job!"  So I was SHOCKED beyond all belief when they announced that I won first place.  I was so amazed and I still am!  I couldn't believe it.  Me.. Hehe..Watch out American Idol here I come!  I did not receive the lifetime supply of lube or the book of 1,000 great sex positions, but what I did get was awesome.... a portable radio/cd player.  I've been needing a new radio in my car so this will be a perfect substitute for a while.  So.. After the talent show we headed back to Nathan's for a nice relaxing evening. Showers.. hehe...  So on to Sunday... Due to the meeting on Friday and the not so good news that I received (sorry my friends but I am keeping this to myself) Sunday was one of the most painful days of my life.  I never thought my body could hurt so badly!  I am so thankful that Nathan was there to support me.  Have I mentioned what a wonderful and caring man he is! :-)  Well I missed the turkey dinner with my parents and arrived back home around 7:30pm.  The turkey was great and Becca came by to give me an Easter basket.  I thought she was going to cough herself to death.  I hope she gets better soon!  So it is now Wednesday.  I am feeling much better, my body is still sore all over but it will be ok.  Things are looking up.  NOW FOR THE BIG SURPRISE................................................... .................................................................................................. is the suspense killing you yet?.................................................... ................................................................................................. I am moving to RIVERSIDE!!!  Yep... you heard right. I have given this so much thought over the past 3 years and have decided that that is where I am going to buy a house.  I am planning on transferring to either CSUSB or UCR and finish my credential out there.  So currently I am looking for a new job, hopefully something related to teaching, and a new house.  It was something that deep down I have always known I have wanted to do.  I am not saying it'll be for the next 30 years but at least the next 3.  So I know some people, Becca, will be mad to hear this and others may be ecstatic.  I am super excited and am finally looking forward to the future.  I can finally say that I think everything is going to be ok with the rest of my life! WOO HOO!

      Unfailing Love    Love can fail, and we must know that it can fail. For if love was always reciprocated, how could there ever be sincere love?   Rather, every person retains his free will. No matter how strong you pull with cords of love in the right direction, he may always turn his back and run away.   But you have done your part, you have shown love. And what is the reward of the mitzvah of love? It is the elevation of your soul, and his soul, and the drawing of the Infinite Light upon all the community of Israel and all the world. It is the entire Torah.   A Daily Dose of Wisdom from the Rebbe -words and condensation by Tzvi Freeman - 29 Nissan, 5763 * May 1, 2003  ----- Something to think about. So very true.

      Was thinking today... Something I've loved since I was a kid is the sound of crunching leaves, branches and brush under my feet.  To feel the anticipation as you wait for the loud crunch.  To feel the crumpling under your shoe as it resonates through your sole and into your limbs.  Ah it is the neatest feeling and sound.  Another reason to love fall, besides Halloween!  So go and crunch some leaves today.

Anyways, life is really stressing me out and it is showing. I am currently in a state of trying to step back from things and of accomplishing things one at a time, but man is it worrying me.  Bah. Anyway, side thought... taffy is hella good! That is all, you are dismissed. ;-)

      Criticizing another person is not out of the question. It's just that there are a few conditions to attend to before you start.  The first condition is to make sure this person is your close friend. Those are the only people worth criticizing--not just because they may actually listen, but also since you run a lower risk of making them into your sworn enemies.  A Daily Dose of Wisdom from the Rebbe -words and condensation by Tzvi Freeman  This is something I think we all need to think about sometimes.  We let our emotions heat up and get in the way and do not truely listen to what is right.  We all make mistakes, the question is are we big enough to forgive and move on?

      Well I am back from Riverside.  Let's see... the recap is... Friday, met up with Becca and went to pick up my dress.  Well the dang thing was TOO BIG!!! OMG! So the store needs to get a smaller size and I'll be able to pick it up on Wednesday. Yippee!!!  I came home, missed the talent show that Nathan went to, Damn this living in LA, not much longer though ... hehe.  Stole Nathan away and went to the Old Spaghetti Factory at 10pm for some grub! yummy.  Surprisingly we went to sleep early.. had an appointment and found out that everything is fine, yippee... no more being a dumb ass!  We went shopping at Ontario Mills and I bought a really cute lil purse thingy.  Then it was off to the park to swing and be a kid.  Had a blast watching the kids play, even took a pic of Nathan playing.. hehe center of gravity is a bit off.  We went back to Nathan's house to figure out what to do.. on the way we saw a kid doing something for the "Show us your KCal competition" and I took a picture and even filmed a little of it.  Well we couldn't figure out what to do so we went and looked at houses in Riverside and Moreno Valley.  I found an awesome house!  I am going to call the agent tomorrow and see if I can set up an appointment and maybe make an offer. My fingers are crossed.  I would love to have a house!  Now I need to work on finding a job.. ugh.. Big stress there... ugh.. Life changes are so stressful for me. But in the end it is all worth it!  Well after that we watched Cannon Ball II, an excellent film and one of my favorites, and I got to grub on my left over food! yummy Mizithra!  Then off to sleep, again with the early, wuz up wit dat?  Had a nice morning this morning ;-)  and was off to Downey :-(  But I did meet up with Becca!  We had a yummy lunch at Lucilles and then went shopping.  I bought a magazine with the updo and makeup that I plan to have for my dress. Now I just need to find shoes and I am set.. well and I need to get a tan by May 31st.  LOL.  And now I must work on homework.. gosh I hate homework.  Why can't it be something fun rather than boring papers. LOL. Anyway, I had a great weekend.  I really love spending time with Nathan...hmmmm is moving to Riverside a good idea.. hmmmm.. LOL.... will we ever get any work done then.. LOL ROFLLMAO... Well I will add more later. Hope all those that read this had a nice weekend too!

Then the car show was canceled so I no longer have plans for tomorrow night, bah, I want to do something, since I'll be in front of this dang computer all day Sunday working on the last of my homework.  So, if anyone has something for me to do Saturday night let me know, otherwise I'll be bored stiff!  Anyway. I am off.

      I just read this in an email and thought it was interesting. I am also working on some comments on the topics of hate and love, which will come hopefully some time soon. But here is something to think about until then.  Madly in Love By: Tzvi Freeman ----------------  Question:  There is a woman whom I knew for a long time. I love her so much, but we're not together anymore. It's been more than a year since she broke off all contact with me. In two months she's getting married. What should I do? I am still convinced that she is the only one in the world for me.  Answer:  Your situation is obviously a very difficult one. It is also a dangerous one, because she is marrying another man and you certainly don't want to destroy her marriage. One thing I must explain to you about what we call "love": The One who  created us wishes us to marry and have children. This is His greatest gift to us, for this is how we become most like Himself -- creators of life. But He knows that if we were all sane, controlled people we would never do these things. So, when we get into a relationship with a member of the opposite sex, He arranges for us to go insane and lose all trace of common sense.  This insanity is a very good thing. But the problem is that it has been made to be part of our natures, so it is indiscriminate. Meaning that it can work against us, too. We see, over and over, how destructive this wonderful insanity can sometimes become. You are young. Like they say in America, there are plenty more fish in the sea. Especially wonderful Jewish girls. My advice: Save your beautiful insanity for another one. Let this woman marry and raise a family in peace. And you will merit to do the same.  - So think on it. Bawahahaha

      I should be working on my homework right now... LOL.. boy am I a slacker.  Anyway, I had another fine weekend.  It was very nice. Let's see Friday night... Nathan was already here, since he had his Jeep worked on by my dad's friend, and we invited Becca to go to the Block to meet up with Brian and his friends for dinner.  So we reached the Block and I had a wonderful Midori Ice Tea and yummy food.  We all chatted and had a nice time.  Took a lil walk around and window shopped.  Nathan is so cool, while I was talking to Brian and Becca he went off and came back with a long stem rose for me.  He is full of surprises... hehe I knew there was a reason that I liked him, hehe ;)  Anyway, we came back to my place and hung out for a little while... we corrupted Becca, then decided it was time to take off to Riverside.  I spent the night next to a cutie, god I love that!  Saturday we headed to UCR, while Nathan was at work I spent the time doing some homework and reading.  It was great to be back on campus with the rain and the beautiful sky.  I loved it.  We met back up at 2 and had a yummy lunch at Carl's Jr.  Of course I forgot my jacket at his place so we had to go back there.. but it was worth it...hehe.  Finally we went back to my place and I spent some time on my 'puter.  Spent a little time being annoyed by my parents, but they weren't too bad.  Then it was off to OLPH to watch Chris play with his band.  The show was good, although they need a new lead singer.  But Chris was great on the drums and they played some great classic rock.  Well by 9:30 we were hungry and we went to Casa Gamino for a yummy dinner.  So back to my place for an interesting night.. very nice.  But alas, he had to go home... :(  awww... So I finally crashed at 2am and woke up at 11:30 today.  I needed the rest and feel so much better.  I talked Becca into coming over.. well I bribed her with an offer to help her on her homework.  She is actually doing pretty well with it.  I've had some great food today, love that cheap hole in the wall.. hehe.  So as you can read it was a nice weekend.  I can not wait to find a place in the Riverside/Moreno Valley area.  It will be so nice to live where I am motivated.  Hehe and the little bonuses will be good too.  I never thought I could be this addicted to anything. What a great feeling.

      Hola! I am so relaxed today!  Woo hoo.  Last night I was bored.  Called Robert to shoot the shit, as my aunt would say.  We got to talking and realized we were both bored, so we decided to go bowling.  We took off to Del Rio and bowled 3 games next to the drunkest, loudest redneck.  He kept yelling that noone was going to drive his car but him.  He made a total ass out of himself.  I was too distracted by him to actually bowl well.  Finally he and his friends went into the bar to sober up and my game was slightly better.  After our 3 games we decided to kill time in the bar until Cosmic Bowling started.  We watched the "regulars" sing Karaoke (I don't think I spelled that right.).  Cosmic Bowling was fun, although I still sucked!  We bowled for two hours, I mastered the gutter bounce, woo hoo, knock that one pin down baby!  I had some great set ups and too bad they were not all in the same 1 game rather than across all the games.  Well after 2+ hours of bowling I finally got into my grove during the last game... I had a 114 going into the last frame, Robert really sucked that game and had like a 70 or something.  Well in the middle of my last frame time was up so I didn't get to finish!  But after losing all the other games I totally humiliated Robert in the last one.. Woo hoo, go ME!   Anyway, so back to my place to munch on yummy Chinese food and to watch Ground Hog Day.  Well Robert passed out 10 minutes into the movie. I watched the movie in and out of sleep and finally went to bed when it was all over. (No I didn't go to bed with Robert! Get your minds out of the gutter!)  Robert was funny, he woke up two times and attempted to go home but ended up falling back on the couch and crashing.  I finally arose at about 10:30 and made egg burritos for us to eat.  He took off and I kicked it for a bit, then fell asleep at one and woke up at four (very nice nap with really good dreams of a hot little prince).  So my day has been nice and quiet, my parents have been gone for most of the day.  I am feeling very relaxed and am looking forward to hanging out with two of my favorite guys tomorrow.  Oh yeah, I started putting together Nathan's birthday gift.. It's going to be so damn cool! L8

      Well today was... tough.. I spoke with Roland today... finally had some type of closure. I am happy for him and hope that he can find happiness just as I have.  So yeah.. That's enough on that I think.  Well today I had my last official class of the semester, woo hoo.  Next week I just need to go and check in to get my grades and papers. Oh yeah and to turn in that one final.  I really, really, really hope that all these classes will transfer to the school I choose. If not damn, I'm screwed.  Bah... have I said how much I dislike the Cal State system. LOL  I'm am really starting to look forward to Nathan's little shin-dig.  I have everything taken care of.. Wow I am actually not procrastinating for once in my life, LOL. Anyway, it should be fun and I can't wait to wear my dress.. only where oh where can he rip it off of me at.. hmmmm.. hehehehehehehehehe (wicked laugh).  Anyway, oh yeah, I finished "Belinda" by Anne Rice. Totally awesome book, very erotic.  I will definitely re-read it.  But first I have so many other books to go through!  I haven't decided what I am going to read next, hmmmm.. Maybe a RICA study guide, LOL.  Well to my friends that read this .. I hope you are well!  We should hang out soon!

      The lack of stress in my life is very nice. I only have one final to complete so far, yippee. But no homework is making me mad. I was so bored!  But I made all my appointments for the 31st, hehe.  Also found out that Roland is moving to Rochester, wow.  I am happy for him but also sad, seeing as he was such a big part of my life.  Oh well I guess time will tell what will happen.  Anyway, Now it is time to find a job and a home in Riverside, yippee. I am off to bed soon. Buh bye

      Let's see... Yesterday my group came over and they were gone by 11:30am. BAH! Can I just say that I hate having group work with people that don't contribute. Susan is the only one that ROCKS!!!  Anyway, so they left, I was bored and started to call people and share that information with them.  Then I looked outside.. "Hey self it is a beautiful day, why don't you go outside and work on tanning your back." So off came the shirt and down I lay.  I was probably only out there for about an hour. I started to read Belinda again, I am almost done, I like how the ending is progressing so far, it's not too happy.  Then came back into the house, plopped down onto the couch and kept reading.  Well at about 5pm my mind began to wander to thoughts of "Table for two" and the "Spaghetti Factory"  I was getting hungry, hmmmm who could I call to eat with me in Riverside???  Hey how about Nathan. So I called my sweetie and asked if he would like to have dinner with me.  He said yes and I was off to pick him up.  Well I was surprised that he let me choose Table for Two considering the Market Broiler fiasco.  We had a wonderful meal, he actually liked it and is willing to go back.  hehe. We also had a very good conversation and I am thankful for his opening up to me.  Well after dinner it was time for us to be creative and think of something to do. LOL. We both suck at thinking of things to do, must make possible list of suggestions from friends for later uses. hehe. Well we decided to go mini-golfing... but went the wrong way on the freeway. So we turned around and headed back in the other direction (by the way Nathan was driving). As we were proceeding to mini-golf Nathan asked if I would like to go wander B&N, duh, everyone knows I love to spend countless hours there, so there we went.  I found my sections rather quickly and picked up a very interesting crime book, I must remember to see if Jon has it.  Nathan finally found me sitting there reading and he found a good book on the Zodiac killer.  Well after that it was my turn to decide what to do... Dancing was out (punk) so I thought let's go drink!  Off to the store to buy some yummy Cranberry Mike's.  So what to do now.. Back to Nathan's place (it's gonna suck when he's not there anymore, but anyway.)  Drank and enjoyed his, uh, company, hehe.  I was beginning to get sleepy and I still had to drive home for mothers day, so I didn't want to drink as much as I originally planned (seeing as it is a wonderful sedative).  I took a brief nap and then off I went.  I was home slightly before 3am and I crashed.  I had wonderful dreams of a hottie all night, ummmmmm.  So, I had a nice night and wasn't bored.  HEHE. I love spending time with Nathan, he's fun.    Now it is Sunday and Mommy Day. I gave my mom a card and will be making her a nice chicky din-din. Hehe. I have a bunch of stuff to do for school so I better get off the web and get to work, bah, I hate work. Bah. Anyway.  I'm still happily lovey...life is great and so is my man.. hehe. buh bye.

      Well the dreaded move has begun... Bah.. I am not being nice about it either. Screw them!  Anyway, for the first time in months I will be sleeping tonight in a different room than my computer.  I am beginning to feel the withdrawls. LOL.  Anyways, I just finished hooking up the 'puter and I am tired. I have a long day ahead of me tomorrow.. So much to do... And I know an argument will probably occur. But what can you do huh?! Laters

      To all my friends out there.. Sorry I wasn't online when you sent me a message... After the day I had I needed to get away from the house and be out ... If you ever need to get in touch with me PLEASE CALL MY CELL!!!!!  I will always answer, well unless I am getting busy with a cute guy, ROFL!  Anyway, please feel free to call me if you need me, ok!  So now on to my day... Bah... I hate people... Bah... Mother Fuckers... Bah.. Can you tell I am pissed off... LOL... so this morning I wake up, chat with Nathan, the day is going really well.  Then I walk out the door to go to work.  As I walk to the door I realize that "hey one of my cleaning rags for my car is on the ground.. Hmmm... Maybe my dad got into the trunk... No that's not right he didn't have my keys."  I open the trunk. "WHAT THE FUCK!"  My fairy wings are all bent up, my trunk is torn apart.  "Where the hell is my bowling bag???"  I go to put my bag for work in the front seat and yell even louder, "FUCK!!"  Some GOD DAMN MOTHER FUCKER opened my glove box and rampaged everything in it and the books and the papers in the back seat too.  Well I was pissed off.  I went into the house and looked quickly for my bowling ball, but I didn't see it.  I went into the kitchen and called the police.  I filed a police report and was told that "No, we will not dust your car for fingerprints because it was a petty crime, if they would have broken the window to get in then we would."  WHAT FUCKING BULLSHIT!  So I cleaned up my car and went on to work.  At lunch I checked out my car a bit better and found that the assholes had jimmied my lock to get in.  So my lock is slightly fucked up.  But at least it wasn't my fault.  So now I'm thinking they stole my bowling stuff, why the hell didn't they just leave the crap and take the fucking car?!  Then at least I would have been a step closer to getting my Jeep!  Well it sucks, I feel like going on night patrol and kickin some ass, I want my bowling stuff back!  BAH.  So that is what happened today.  Thanks to Becca, after class today she distracted me by taking me to this teacher meeting thing.  I talked her into going to Rajun Cajun for dinner... she actually ate the shrimp, lol.  Went to Starbucks to get a dose of Jaime.  Now I am home.  So it was a day.  Bah.

      Woo hoo.... starting to bubble over with excitement... tomorrow I get to wear my awesome dress, I am so excited.  And I cannot wait to see Nathan all "cleaned up" hehe.  I'm really looking forward to spending tomorrow night with him.  Cheese factor is setting in.   So today was good.  Work was good.  I can't wait to have the "show down" with Kristie.  The aide they hired to work with Austin this summer is so Psycho, but I gave her my number anyway, LOL.  After work I went and got a manicure and pedicure, hehe.  It's been like 8 years or so.. Ah, it was so nice to have someone do my nails and not mess up like I do.  Anyway, I came home and cleaned up my room a bit, it's neater, but there is still so much to do.  Becca came over not too long ago and we went to Frisco's to grab dinner.  Came back here and ate, while being bothered by my parents.  Bah.  So now I sit here typing, surfing, chatting with my hottie and watching Becca read one of my books on my bed.  In all it was a very good day.  Tomorrow is going to be so much fun.. I plan to have lots to say and tons of pics on my website.. Good night ya'll I'm outie.  Music: Ziggens - Time to sober up

Anyway, I am so happy and giddy right now, even with all the huge life changes that have been going on.  I see the future baby and it is no longer murder, it's happy little fluffy bunnies with big floppy ears.  Woo hoo.. Love, life and happiness all rock. Later gators!

      Ah... What a start to the week. It feels like Monday!  Becca came over this evening and we had a yummy dinner at Casa Gamino!  I tried to help her with her math, but she was too tired because of her long weekend.  But it was good to hang with her, if only for a little while. So my weekend update...  (seeing as I have been slacking and this is supposed to be my journal and all!) Friday night, packed, cleaned my new room.  Saturday, Moved stuff all day long and was exhausted by 10pm.  Sunday, finished moving everything by 2pm, but was too tired to completely put everything away so I said "Screw this!"  Talked to Nathan and could not stand not seeing him, so off to Riverside I went.  It was a great drive with very little traffic! I met him at his parents house and we had a yummy dinner of hamburgers!  His mom makes a great tato salad just like my mommy!  Then it was off to hang out with Will (after we stopped by his place to pick some things up, hehe).  We went to Starbucks and had a wonderful chat, saw a really cute guy, took lots of photos (which I published on my webpage - www.geocities.com/lilangelfuk78), hung out at Will's place until the wee-hours of the morn, then went back to Nathan's place and died.  I was so tired from the move!  Sunday, despite my better judgement, we woke up early! Bah.  We went back to the 'rents house and had a yummy meal to start the day, more picking on Nathan (although he took his stabs at me, LOL) then it was off to the mall.  I was impressed, all I did was window shop, amazing, really!  After resisting the temptations of the mall we headed to Will's house for a Memorial Day BBQ. The food was awesome and so filling!  And those bean chips were great!  Then Nathan had to go home to a meeting so it was off again.  I kicked him out of my car and headed home.  There was no traffic and I made it home in 35 minutes! woo hoo.  I worked a bit on my webpage and then headed over to my aunts to see how she was doing.  Had a nice long talk with her and she is looking forward to seeing me all dolled up again this upcoming Saturday.  LOL.  So I came home and crashed and didn't want to wake up this morning! Nor did I want to go to work.   So I had a great weekend. As always the highlight was my little trip to Riverside!  I can't wait to live out there again, although I hate moving. Bah. Today was a good day, Austin was a punk.  I don't think he is taking all his meds.  He is really starting to show the schizo side. Poor kid.  Well I still am mad at our bosses for what they did to Carla, politics suck! Well, anyway, that's the update for now.  I know I have been slacking and I guess it's just 'cuz I have been so tired and had a lot of things on my mind.  Hmmm I shall try to update more often, but we'll see. Later gator.

      AUSTIN IS A LITTLE PUNK ASS BITCH!  I'm telling you this kid needs a good ass kickin'!  Anyway, he was off all day long, throwing things, destroying what was left of the room.  Helen and I took the rest of the class out to the playground, I don't think they were in the class for more than two hours the entire day! And it's a 6 hour day!  Well the theory that Carla and I have is that Beth and Allan are not giving the meds to him because of the threat of reduced services.  We think their logic is "Make behaviors worse, get more services, worry less about taking care of our own son since someone else will do it for us!"  So yeah, I'm not too happy about it.. and even though I'm not supposed to say anything to Austin's nannies or parents I have been. I'm not going to be there next year and it's about time that I voiced my concerns.  So I've been polietly going off.  Nicole has been so nice and has apologized for what has been going on, she's nice.  Anyway, I'm tired and done ranting for now.   I cannot wait to see Will tomorrow, it's going to be so much fun. hehe

      So today was an interesting day.  Before I left work I checked my phone, hmmm a voice mail... from my dad... Strange.  Well he called to tell me that my little cousin is in the hospital.  I called him back and found out that she has been in intensive care since this morning and that she is not doing well.  So I rush to the hospital from work and find her lying in a bed almost comatose with her boyfriend (that apparently noone in my family likes) sitting by sleeping in the chair next to the bed.  I woke him up and talked to him for a bit.  It turns out that she had not been feeling well for a couple of days and that she has been throwing up for since yesterday morning.  Since she is diabetic her blood pressure and sugar levels were out of control.  My aunt and uncle took her to the hospital this morning and the doctors have been treating her ever since.  Well when I got there she looked awful.  I thought she would go into a coma at any minute.  Luckily she didn't.  She woke up and actually smiled at me, something she hasn't done in a very long time.  She and I chatted for a while and it was really nice to have such a friendly moment with her.  I had been there about 2 hours when her mom arrived and we gave Kate a sponge bath and took care of her.  The three of us sat and chatted for about another half an hour.  My uncle showed up and then some one else and it was getting close to the time for shift changes so I finally said goodbye to her and told her I would be back tomorrow to see her.  She was smiling and seemed to be happy which is the first I have seen from her in a very, very, very, very long time.  I am glad I had that moment with her, even if she turns bitch again tomorrow at least I had one day with my little cousin like I used to have.  May the gods bless and watch over her.

      Well I am eating my words and boy oh boy are they sweet and sour.  So about a year or two ago I said I would "never be blonde again!"  I was dead set against being a blonde.  So I did everything to keep my hair from going blonde.  When I dyed my hair maroon I was in heaven!  My thoughts were that it would be the color for the next several years.  Well NOW I must eat those words.  Several days ago I was talking to Nathan and he happened to see pics of me as a blonde.  Well his excitement and the cute way he asked have made me change my mind.  Yes I am going blonde again.  Yes you heard right.  I shall be going back to my roots.  The look on his face every time I mention that I am going blonde is definitely a great motivation and has actually made me a bit excited about the whole thing.  So yes, the power of persuasion was used to overcome my previous desire.  I'm not bitter. I am quite happy and I am quite happy that I can make Nathan so happy by something so small. But I am bitter that my hair is not growing out as quickly as it should. Bah.. I want my long hair back, although once it is back I will probably hate it, as I remember why I cut it in the first place.. all those knots. LOL. Thank you Nathan for being such a wonderful bad influence ;-)

      Well I had an awesome weekend!!!   Saturday was cool, I picked up Becca and we headed to the mall for my hair appointment.  Fairy did an awesome job on my hair!!!  Then it was back to Becca's to hang for a bit and to touch up my nails.  We rushed to Downey and on the way there I got stuck on the 91-710 interchange due to some sort of funeral procession for either a cop or a fire fighter.  I was a few minutes late to my make-up appointment but it was no biggy.  The lady did a pretty good job.  Anyway, Becca was hungry so we went to Olive Garden and had a nice late lunch.  Our waiter was totally hot and said he will be going to CSULB beginning next quarter, I told Becca she should transfer early, LOL. Anyway, I wanted to leave her number for him, but she said "NO", boo hoo.  Well we came home and I finished getting ready.  Nathan looked totally hot, as always, but I was very shocked to not see his Metallica cap on his head.  Hubba Hubba... he's such a hottie.. hehe.  Well my parents took a ton of pictures, bah.  I think my outfit turned out totally awesome!!!  I was so happy to finally wear it!!!!!!    Anyway, we headed out to the Paradise Pier for Nathan's little gathering.  When we got there it was kinda empty and the Ducks/Devils game was on.  I talked Nathan into letting me watch the game, hehe, he's so cool.  And the Ducks won, woo hoo.  Go Cali!!!  But Nathan talked me into taking pictures, bah, no proof I tell you, no proof, ROFL.   So Nathan is Mr. Popular Social Butterfly.  Hehe. It's so cute, he's so... needed.  Anyway, the banquet was cool.  I enjoyed myself and enjoyed watching Nathan in one of his many elements.  Oh and the bartender there made very nice drinks!  For the first time since my birthday I got to see Anjane and Rex.  Both looked nice in their outfits.  It was nice to get to talk to Anjane for a few minutes, although I know it was a bit strange.  Oh well, not much I can do anymore.  The night in total was very nice.  On our way out of the hotel we found a "tv" room that was showing old Donald and Mickey cartoons.  Did you know that Pluto barked like a seal at one time?  hehe.  The room was pretty cool.  It had beach benchs for kids and adults and the tv was in the center of this castle piece, that Nathan pointed out had crosses on it, even though the head of Disney is Jewish, hmmm.   So we watched a couple of cartoons.  Spending that time with Nathan was great, he is such a great guy to be around.  We booked it kinda early and came home to uh... "crash" hehe.  Can I just say it is nice to have a lock on my door.   We had to wake up early this morning to go to the RenFaire with Brian and Andrew (two of Nathan's co-workers).  We arrived at CSUSB at 9am and awaited (for a damn long time) his friends.  Well what a wait, I'm surprised that Carl's Jr didn't come out and ask us to stop loitering. LOL.  Anyway, I finally made it to RenFaire.  It was awesome, but very hot.  It reminded me of the Sawdust Festival, only with costumes and accents.  Many good looking people.  Tons of great outfits that I wish I had the money to buy.  (It sucks being poor)  We walked, drank a good concoction that Brian made, ate a yummy crepe, watched a funny performance of "Goldilocks and the three bears"... Someone's been sitting in my chair, it's all sticky; someone's been sitting in my chair, it smells like fish. ROFL.  That was great.  Then lots more walking was done, Nathan's Scottish accent was great.  On the way out we stopped to watch a comic juggler.  He was drop dead funny.  He took some girls cellphone (which she was talking on) and said, "Who the hell is this? Well where are you? etc" He continued to have a conversation with the person on the other line.  Then when he was done he handed the phone to someone on the other side of the audience.  It was great.  Oh and these kids kept getting up and down in the front row and he finally had had it and yelled at them, "Sit Down"  oh it was classic!  He was totally cool!  I loved it.  It was a lot of fun, but very hot.  My neck is all sunburnt, but it's not as bad as Nathan thinks.  We took off at about 1:30 to head back to Downey so that Nathan could get home in time to prepare for his meeting.  On the way home we had a flat tire, so we were delayed.  But Nathan was so manly and fixed it all by himself.  Hehe... he's so sexy when he gets his hands dirty!  Well we had to blow the tire up and luckily we were right next to the Mountain exit where the Arco and Tommy's are.  So after fixing the tire I devirginized Nathan and got him a yummy Tommy's burger.  I think he liked it ;-)  Then it was on to home.  By the time we arrived it was 4:00pm.  Nap time.  I had to wake Nathan up so he wouldn't be late for his meeting.  Hopefully he didn't mind.  When he left around 5 I jumped in the pool, quite refreshing.   And now I am here.  Kinda bored, but have tons of stuff I could do.  Oh well.  Anyway, I had a totally awesome weekend.  I spent so much time with Becca and Nathan it was great.   It's wonderful to be able to have such a nice connection with someone.  Nathan, you are the greatest, most rad, bodacious guy I know and I thank you!  Well peeps I'm outtie for now.  Late.

      Woo Hoo, It's friday the 13th. One of my favorite days.  No wonder certain things have been happening... muwahaha.   I am hoping to talk to a certain friend sometime soon, I haven't talked to you in several days and miss you.  And I think you know who you are, so I'm not going to mention names.  Oy I almost forgot!  I've been talking to my friend that I haven't talked to since March.  It is nice.  I am glad things are finally getting better, I hope.    Ok.  That's all for now.  I am off to work, only 4 days (counting today) left before no more Tulita *tear*.  I am definitely going to miss that place.  But now I must find a job, a home and transfer schools, argh.  Buh-bye

      So today on the way home from work I stopped by my aunt Lee's house to see how things with Katie are going.  Well apparently Katie left again.  She apparently had another big blow out all because she wanted her boyfriend to spend the night! Dude she's only 18 she should know to wait, that would never work with an Ellis, she should know that.  Anyway, my aunt is fed up again.   She and I talked for about 2 hours.  It's too bad that she can not see where everything went wrong with Kate.   So anyway, I'm still gonna try to find her and help her out, but we'll just have to wait and see.  In other news... Hmmm... I don't know... I'm stressing over this whole finding a job/move thing.  I hate change! Did I mention I hate change?  I am still really excited about everything and looking forward to being back in the hood. LOL.  Anyway. I really need to get my resume done. BAH.  ok... I can not think of anything else to say.. so I shall come back another day.

      K.. New Rant... AUSTINS PARENTS ARE GOING TO GET THE SHIT KICKED OUT OF THEM BY ME!!! These people are totally abusing this poor kid by fucking with his med dosage and not being consistent.  Just because they are having divorce issues doesn't mean they should fight through the fucking kid.  They are going to seriously hurt him or even worse kill him.  So for the past 2 days Austin has came to school so drugged and out of it, so that all he has done is fallen asleep! We've sent him home both days before 11:30am.  His parents then proceed to tell Carla one thing and me another. I swear I want to rip their heads off. Bah.. Well at least there is only 5 days left.

      Dude why do people assume things about you and never discuss it with you. Really that pisses me off!  I don't care if someone is gay, straight, bi, whatever, hell we all know that I'm not straightlaced.  Why is it that people assume that I am some sort of innocent angel just by looking at my face.  They think that my appearance tells all about me.  "Oh she's blonde and has a baby face she must know nothing about life."  Well you know what, "FUCK YOU!"  That's bloody bullshit.  I can not stand that and I can't stand people thinking that I am quick to make assumptions.  Screw you too!  If you think I am assuming something then just come out and ask otherwise you're going to piss me off, kinda like I am right now.  In the famous last words of Jonathan, "You are dismissed, move along." *editors note if you are named christina or kristie this is for you*

      Ok. I must rant about the whole online thing.  There are reasons why I love being online and reasons why I hate it.  Tonight I shall discuss my hatred.  ASSUMPTIONS!  Because chats online lack that personal discussion that occurs during face to face communications it also lacks the emotions of those conversations.  One person may be joking and making lighthearted comments that another believes are not that way at all. There is no real way to know exactly what the other person is truely saying because you can not hear the seriousness or the laughter in their voice.  Think of it, how many times have you had a conversation online with someone and thought one thing, then discussed that chat in person and realized that you assumed the completely wrong thing.  You can not assume anything when it comes to online.  If something is said that hurts your feelings you need to say exactly that and ask for a better clarification.  As those who know me know I am very long winded and will go on and on about things, so ask and I can explain.  Since I hate assumptions I try my hardest not to assume anything and when I do sense an assumption I ask.  Now I can read people rather well and I know when someone is being completely honest and I know we aren't always that way. Anyway, I digress... So if you are a friend that reads this and have assumed that my comments to you were completely serious please reconsider, many of the things I say are in jest.  If I am serious I will let you know.  So yes I hate assumptions and I hate  the lack of "voice" that online creates.  If I have offended anyone or hurt anyone's feelings lately I am sorry and hope that you can see things differently after reading this.  I love you all to some degree, if I didn't I would not have let you read this now would I. ;-)

      "WEEKEND UPDATE with PATTI.. Now your host, Patti."  Well the weekend is  coming to a close.  I had a very nice weekend, right now I am suffering the after effects of going to sleep at 5 am and not being able to sleep past noon.     Oh well, it was worth it.  Let's see.  Yesterday morning at about 9ish I stole my mom's car and took off to Riverside.  Stopped into Walmart to pick up a few things, went to the bank, then delivered myself to Will's house at about 10:30am.  As we waited for the weather to heat up we explored Will's computer.  Oh what wonderful files he has, hehe. I can't wait to get a copy of some of them! ;-)  Well it finally heated up and we went outside to tan and swim. The pool was freezing at first, but as we adjusted it became very nice and comfy.  We had some quality chat time and came back in to take showers and get ready to hook up with Nathan.  Well there was a slight misunderstanding and as we waited for Nathan to arrive at the house we received a call... Nathan was waiting for us at Kings Buffet.  LOL, talk about crossed signals.  Anyway, the food was good and it was very inexpensive.  We had a nice chat, it was super fun being evil to Nathan, but of course I caved in and started being nice again.    Will and I finished our meal while Nathan went to do somethings.  We then went apartment shopping.  Can you believe that all the rental offices were closed on the weekends!?  So we cruised past a few and then got an idea.  We decided to check out the newly built houses by the MoVal mall.  With 20 minutes before closing we were able to view all of the floor plans.  We found one that we really liked and decided that if we could take different aspects of each and combine them into one we would have the perfect home.  On the way out we sold ourselves as a couple looking for a starter home.  The cute guy that worked there bought it... hehe.  We were headed back to Will's to meet up with Nathan when we came up with the best idea, that we of course shared with Nathan.  As Nathan sat there he was very nervous, all good plans created by Will and I apparently are not originally viewed as good.  So we broke our plan to him.... In a few years, when Will comes back from Japan, the three of us should buy a nice big house and be roommates.  If we buy the house then we have a great future investment that later down the road we can sell or rent out.  Surprisingly Nathan agreed to the plan and thinks it is a good idea too.  Wow, I was shocked, for some reason I thought he would tell us we were insane.  So instead of buying a house sometime in the near future I am going to save up my money and prepare for this possible investment.  I agree with Will, I think the three of us would be pretty cool roommates.  So after that discussion we decided to hop in the pool.  Nathan tossed Will and I in, PUNK!  And after a while the 78 degree water became chilly!  To warm me up I was made into a sandwich, hehe, I like sandwiches.  When the boys began to get cold (I was warm in my lil sandwich) we decided to go in and take our showers.  Will chose his computer over a nice little show.... hmmmmm..... hehe.  We took off to get some dinner at Boompa's, which of course turned out to be closed.  So we headed farther into downtown to eat at the Riverside Brewery.  We shared a yummy sampler platter and BBQ chicken pizza.  I had a great time chatting with the guys.  Funny thing is while I was sitting there I was thinking about a few things that had happened while I was still at UCR and as I was reflecting I look up and who did they just seat at the booth directly behind us but the one female that I actually tried to kill. LOL.  It was very funny, she was there on a date and for the first time I didn't care about her.  So that was interesting.  After our yummy dinner we went to Back to the Grind to get some yummy drinks and to say hi to Will's friend.  Well as I came out of the bathroom I saw Mauro so I went to say hi. He looked like he was having a nice evening at his shin-dig next door.  After that I went to find the boys.  We then took off back to Will's after some forceful proding.  I had ate too much greasy stuff, this whole healthy eating thing is for the birds!  By the time we put in "Die another day" I was feeling a bit better and very randy. hehehe. Well the rest of the night was interesting, but the boys definitely take forever! LOL.  Anyway, I had a nice time with Will and Nathan and did somethings that were very interesting.  I finally left Will's around 4 am and by the time I arrived home I was extremely tired.. and the rest is history.  Today.. My parents bought a surround sound system for the den and of course I had to hook the whole thing up.  It's kinda cool.  It has DVD and VHS included in the system along with  the tuner.  It's pretty nice.  I think they bought it at Cosco.  So I finished putting that together and now I am here online.  I plan to do some job hunting today and maybe go and see someone, we'll see.  Anyway, I'm outtie.. lates.

      Well after yesterday my body hurts... my neck is killing me and so are my shoulders... oh well, shouldn't have let Rob leave without that massage... LOL.  Anyway, today is the day, we leave for the mystery place later today.  I'm hoping that we don't hit much traffic.  I think it's going to be a blast.  I'm going with two of the coolest guys that I know...hehe.  Anyway, found out a friend did something really stupid.  I still love her, but I'm disappointed, I thought she was stronger than that.  Don't ever mess with your ex if they were an ass in anyway while you were dating them.. that's my advice for the day.  I should know.  Anyway, I know what she's been going through sucks, but there is somthing better out there for her, if only she had patience.  Lets see what else... Oh I finally told someone that I hate him.  And I do, after everything he's put me through and all the attempts at friendship I've made.  I can't stand him, kinda wish he weren't in the same state as me. LOL. Anyway, it felt good to be so truthful. That friendship has been over for a very long time and I don't think it will ever come back, unless he makes the effort.  Oh yeah... I'm gonna disappear after this little trip. I've got alot of things that I really need to think about and re-evaluate.  Lots of things aren't as they seem and I've been played for a fool too many times.  I need to regroup and get a better grip on things.  Who knows when I'll be back.  We'll see.  Well for those of you that read this, and I'm not even sure who that is, have a great weekend and enjoy the summer.  I'm out. Lates.

      Well I just finished my bike ride with Robert.  We took a nice long ride... My ass is sore!  But it was alot of fun.  We saw so many "ranch" style houses with horses.  And a kid making meth. LOL.  Anyway, I can't wait to learn to rollerblade.  It was a good long ride and we'll be doing it again soon.  Although my body is hurting, it is a good hurt.  Oh good news I found the jewelry I thought I had lost.  It was in one of the pockets of my backpack that was in the bottom of my closet.  Yippee. So now I am much happier.   Well I am off to the shower, then I have a ton of stuff I need to do before my weekend adventure with the boys.  Lates.

      Well today was the last day at Tulita.  I am both happy and sad about it.  I will miss many of the ladies that I worked with and several of the kids, there are several people and kids that I won't miss.  I spent the day in the classroom with Carla and Austin while the rest of the kids and Helen were outside with the field day activities.  I was glad to be inside, I didn't really feel like being outside with all the noise.  It was nice to chat with Carla and have a good day with Austin.  He wasn't as bad of a terror today as he had been before.  Well onward with my life.  Now the job hunt and apartment search begins.  Yesterday when I came home from work I was feeling horrible and needed to take another long drive.  Nathan was on and asked me to meet him at Ontario Mills.  I cleaned myself up and headed out.  There was a little traffic, but nothing bad.  I surprised him when he came into the bookstore as I was kneeling near a bookshelf while he was looking around for me and I popped up when he didn't expect it.  We shopped for gifts for Carla and Helen and did a little browsing.  Nathan kept setting off the security alarms at the stores we went into... sure he didn't steal anything, uh huh that's his story.  LOL... anyway, after shopping we walked over to Chevy's and I had a yummy dinner and conversation.  I think the hostess thought we hated eachother as Nathan was trying to tell me that my last post sounded full of vengence. Which it isn't. Anyway, we had a nice conversation and then went back to the car to chat and figure out what we could do.  Well I must say that Nathan is very sexy when he has one thought on his mind... hehe.  We went for a little drive into the business district and enjoyed eachothers company.  Then it was off to home. Leaving him is getting tougher.... anyway, I came home and wrapped the gifts I had bought for the ladies and then crashed.  And so the day ended around 1am.  Nice and long as usual.  Tomorrow I get to sleep in, for a little while at least.  I can't wait to go for the bike ride.  Woo hoo.  Anyway, right now I am working on laundry and preparing for my kidnapping of Nathan on Friday.  I still think he knows exactly where I am taking him.  It is going to be a lot of fun.  I can't wait to spend the time with him.. and Will too.  It will be the first trip I've taken with Will and that should be fun.  Hehe....hmmm how are we going to work the "hump" factor.. LOL.. anyway. I can't wait... *bouncing with excitement*    Well I am outtie for now.. Gotta go do more laundry. Late.

      Only today and tomorrow left at work!!! Woo Hoo! Yippee!  I'm excited, but then it sucks 'cuz I won't be getting any more money...ugh gotta find a job.  Anyway, I started walking with my mom last night.  We figure we'll walk until I move that way she and I can get back into our exercise routines.  It was nice talking with her, even though she's nosy! hehe.  I'm super excited!!! I talked to Robert yesterday and we're going for another ride on Thursday!  We're gonna try to go riding as often as possible which will be really cool!  I miss riding every day, so this will be fun.  He even offered to teach me how to rollerblade!  I've been wanting to learn for a while now, ever since Jeremy learned way back in the day, so I think it's about time I learn!  Although I'll probably fall on my ass a gazillion times, LOL  I'm so giddy, woo hoo, *chants* "gonna learn new stuff, gonna have some fun" hehe.  So yeah, it's cool.  hehe.    Anyway, I am off to work.  Bah.  Austin was a punk yesterday and I spent a vast majority of the day outside with the other kids while Carla dealt with him tearing up the room.  I only hope he's not like that today.  It is so sad to see what bad parenting can do to a child.  Oh well.  On a lighter note I'm going out of town this weekend and it's to somewhere I haven't been in a while.  I am looking forward to getting away from LA and all the crap I've been dealing with.  Hurry up Friday and get here.  Well I'm off ... Snoochie boochies.

      K.  I had a nice relaxing day yesterday, so I'm back to my old self. LOL.  You know there are just those times when you lose yourself and forget.  Well the events from yesterday helped bring me back from hateville.  So Friday I didn't do much.  Had dinner with my aunt and had a good discussion with her about my past and the things that have been happening lately.  She reminded me of what I needed to hear, that even though I want friendship with someone it is not the best idea yet.  Well to begin I was pissed at her for being right, but now I feel better and realize that.  I spent alot of alone time Friday night and into the wee morning hours, which was needed.  It was both good and bad, but helpful.  After an ok rest Saturday was finally here.  I was still abit pissed off at the world and mainly myself, but with Nathan's arrival and the trip to the aquarium, that all changed.  I had a wonderful time at the aquarium with Nathan, he's as dorky as I am... hehe.  It was alot of fun, there were so many people there, but I renewed my membership so now I can take my friends for free again.  I am hoping to go by myself at least once a week and to take a friend at least once or twice a month.  It is such a wonderful place to relax.  Anyway, did I mention that I had a great time with Nathan. hehe.  The urge to eat was upon us and we went to Tequilla Jack's for a lunch dinner thing.  I had very yummy food and good conversation.  Although I thought Nathan was going to fall asleep a few times. LOL.  Then it was off to walk around and find my dad a brownie.  Then back to the car to go to B&N to look for the book "The Language Police"  which I definitely want to get!  Then it was back home to chat with my parents for a few minutes (thanks to Nathan for putting up with them)  and then movies and fun.  Well I finally saw "Jackass the Movie"  OMG some of that stuff was hella nasty and sick, but it was funny!!!!  Then I got to enjoy the wonderful company of Nathan and watched "Queen" again for like the billionth time.  After the movies it was so nice to fall asleep in Nathan's arms, he's so comfy!!!  It's amazing the way he feels.  Ok... I'll stop boring you.  Anyway, I kicked him out around 1am and tried to go back to sleep, but after being so comfy in his arms I of course could not. Bah.  So I stayed up for several hours and then finally when I was too exhausted I crashed and burned onto my bed.  Oh yeah, I almost forgot! I gave Nathan his birthday gift.  I think it really surprised him and from his giddy-ness I think he really liked it. Hehehe.  I'm so glad it was a hit. ;-)  So this moring, I had wonderful dreams of Nathan, junior high (hehe), and high school.  It was really interesting considering I haven't been able to remember any of my dreams in a couple of weeks.  So after thinking about each I ventured out to find the house deserted and myself all alone.  I decided to watch "Old School"  and you know what?!  I enjoyed it, and I think that if Nathan gave it a chance he would too!!!  It was funny and actually had an interesting story line.  There lives are just as fucked up as mine... LOL.  I definitely think everyone should watch it at least once.  You know Luke Wilson and Vince Vaughn are both very hot in that old guy kinda way.  hehe.  Well anyway, I am off, I have a few things that I want to do today.   I'm happier today then I have been all week which is good, maybe it was just PMS... Putting up with Major Shitheads.. LOL... anyway... I'm off to a happier state of mind.. late.

      Wow.. I just spent 2 hours in the back yard working on the flower beds.  I worked off alot of that tension and stuff that's been building.  I feel great.  I had a nice "English" talk with the flowers... I think my neighbors have now confirmed that I am nutz. hehe.  Anyway, it was great to be doing that again.. I never realized how much I missed working in the garden.  Well when I was all done, for today, I jumped right in the pool and boy did it feel good.  Ahhh.. Yeah I know I am sick and probably shouldn't have.. but you know what, since then I feel 100% better.  My throat doesn't hurt, my nose stopped running.. I feel pretty damn good.  I'm still going to keep taking my meds though, just in case.  But I'm hoping that this little cold will be gone as soon as possible.  I'm not very fond of being sick.  So anyway.  My room is a mess I still need to do laundry and stuff... being sick and everything that has been happening with my aunt has really put me behind.  Anyway.... I'm off.  snoochie boochies baby!

      Wow, I haven't blogged in a while... Sheesh.... Well my throat is still a bit blah, but oh well, such is life.  Let's see I guess it is time to write about Vegas. hehe  Friday morning I awoke and finished some things around the house then headed out to Riverside.  I stopped at the Extension Center to visit Lina.  She has a new position and an office and everything.  It was good to sit and chat with her for a while.  Well by the time I had found Lina and started chatting (as we know Lina is always running around and talking peoples ears off hehe) I was a bit late for picking up Nathan.  Once he called that gave me good reason to gracefully bow out of the conversation and take my leave.  But Lina will be having a BBQ next month that I'll definitely be going to so WOO HOO.  Anyway.  Went to Nathan's house and was rushed away by him even though I was having a nice chat with his mom.  We loaded his stuff and went to a nearby park, because I wanted to swing and we didn't have much else of a plan.  We waited for Will to get off work and then went to pick him up.  We finally left MoVal at about 6pm and luckily didn't hit too much traffic.  It was nice to drive my mom's car out there with it's working speakers and cd player.  Will and I made some cool cd's to listen to and we enjoyed our nice drive out.  When we arrived in Vegas it was around 9:30 or 10:00, I don't really remember, we checked into our hotel and found out that two beds would cost a small fortune, so it looked like the three of us would be sharing one bed... woo hoo me and too guys, you know I'm lovin' it!  Anyway, Will found a place to eat and we trecked over to the Stardust (I believe it was) for a very crappy meal.  The food really sucked and I wasn't that hungry any way.  So after we ate we visited some casinos then went back to the hotel to crash.  After trying to fall asleep several times, Will began to snore, Nathan and I had a little time to ourselves and then I wanted to either jump on the bed or hit Will with a pillow, it was really funny (at least to me), but no attacks were made on Will.  I still couldn't sleep and decided to go pee, while I was sitting there the wallpaper started to do that trippy thing that those eye thingys do... so it was all like 3-D and stuff, I felt like Alice in Wonderland with the wall moving and stuff.  I was in there quite a while and when I came out tried to explain how cool it was to Nathan. I think he thought I was nuts. (Well of course I am, we all know that).  Anyway, I tried to get some rest, Will had stopped snorring, but I couldn't really sleep well.  The next morning we got up and went to Leatherby's, that really cool icecream shop.  We had a nice big lunch and some yummy icecream.  The waitress was really nice and told us all about the huge icecream that you could get a plaque for by eating it yourself.  After the coma-inducing lunch we went to the casinos and the boys played a bit.  We walked around the shops at the Venitian and found a store that has suits that Nathan would look so HOT in!!!  So more walking and looking etc. Then back to the hotel to get a game plan for the night and a nap.  We took off to Excalaber (I don't think I spelled that right) and had a yummy dinner while checking out Will's eye candy.  Then it was back to the hotel to clean up and get ready to go to Gipsy.  That was fun.... Will and I locked Nathan in the room and went dancing. hehe.  There was lots of eye candy at the club and very yummy drinks.  Once Will's friend got there I decided it was time for me to go and get the attention I deserve, so back to the hotel I went.  I spent a lovely time at the hotel with Nathan and then out on the strip.  We stayed out until probably 6 am which was nice.  I really loved having his company all weekend.  Then it was up to the room to crash with Will.  We awoke with an hour before check out and got all situated and went to Downtown for our first meal, went back to the strip to win me a Jeep at the casino next to the Westward ho... (ok who is the ho? whose the whore? whose the slut? ROFL)  Got there and I felt like shit, kinda like I'd been run over by a truck... anyway, we went in and I lost all my money, didn't come home with a Jeep.  Around 2pm we headed home, broke and Jeepless :-(   We finally rolled into MoVal around 7:30 because of accidents and traffic.  I must say I had a blast in Vegas.  I totally destressed and spent that time with two wonderful and fun guys that I love very much.  They made the trip great.  Thanks guys.   So after the trip I had dinner at Nathan's with his parents, his mommy made a very yummy stew.  Very filling.  Nathan loves to steal me away apparently ;-) and we went back to the park to talk.  We had a nice conversation and he really helped open my eyes to some things.  I must say that no matter what he thinks he is unbelievable and I'm so so so very happy that he is a part of my life.  Thanks babe!  Anyway, after the park I was too tired to drive home so he let me crash on his bed for about an hour. I was still kinda out of it when he woke me up... have I mentioned I love having him wake me up?!  anyway, and I ventured home.. I have no idea how I made it home, I was so out of it.  I died on my bed and well the rest is history.  hehe  Anyway, Vegas was awesome! I really had a blast and it was a well needed break.  It helped me clear my head and I'm feeling better about things.  I figured out why I have been so bitchy and well now things are going well.  So it's time to get that awesome job. Viva ME!  hehe.

      Some thoughts from "A Daily Dose of Wisdom from the Rebbe -words and condensation by Tzvi Freeman"  Redefining the Past  -------------------  Nothing can hold you back -- not your childhood, not the history of a lifetime, not even the very last moment before now. In a moment you can abandon your past. And once abandoned, you can redefine it.  If the past was a ring of futility, let it become a wheel of yearning that drives you forward. If the past was a brick wall, let it become a dam to unleash your power.  The very first step of change is so powerful, the boundaries of time fall aside. In one bittersweet moment, the sting of the past is dissolved and its honey salvaged.  Trust Over Hope  ---------------   Trust transcends hope, as the space beyond transcends the atmosphere below.  When the mind clings to a thread of hope, it is anchored to earthly bounds. The thread snaps, and the mind looks up and sees nothing more than the open sky. All limits are gone.  That is Trust: When you stop suggesting to your Maker what He should do. When you are ready and open to surprise and miracles.  Unimaginable Journeys  ---------------------   Each journey the soul travels takes her higher.  There are journeys that are painful, because there is struggle. Struggle to wrestle out of one place to reach another, struggle to discern the good from the bad and put each in place, struggle to face ugliness and replace it with beauty. But in each of these, a sense of purpose overwhelms the pain and brings its own joy.  Then there are journeys that seem to have no purpose. Where nothing appears to be accomplished, all seems futile. There is no medicine to wash away the pain.  But every journey the soul travels takes her higher. It is only that in some, the destination is a place so distant, so lofty, she could never have imagined. Until she arrives.

But I may not be online to chat if you need me... I have some serious thinking to do. Bah.. I hate seriousness... Anyway.

      Well I corrupted Becca hehe.... We went to someone's house so I could rant and so we could get free alcohol.  I hate his cats!!! They bother my nose! LOL. K so yeah yesterday around 11am Becca and I arose from our slumbers (we went to bed around 2:30) and we had some yummy breakfast.  I had cereal and my leftover ravioli from the Olive Garden.  Then it was out to the pool to swim and relax.  The pool was nice and I can jump higher than Becca. LOL.  Well around 12:15 I decided to check the time and realized I was running late.  I came in and took a shower and got ready to head to Riverside.  I was ready around 1:30 but then I realized I still needed gas... Bah.. so off to the gas station.  I finally rolled out of Downey at about 2pm.  Nathan called and said he would be home at 3 so see I have perfect timing.  I jumped on the freeway and made it to MoVal at 3pm exactly.  Nathan and I went to a couple stores to buy me some rollerblades.  I found a really nice pair that are pretty dang comfortable.  Then we headed to the Performance center to buy a bikini top for his Jeep.  Back at Nathan's we took off his hard top, wow his Jeep looked so different all naked (although it is very dirty and is going to be massively cleaned by me very soon!!! he shows no love for his Jeep!) We got the drill out and made a few holes then installed the top.  It looks  a bit funny but who knows why!  I'm sure he'll figure it out.  Anyway, the Jeep looks really cool and is very airy, now I have got to remember to bring a hat with me. LOL.  And so after 2 hours the Jeep was complete and we were hungry. Nathan took me to Alculpolco (I don't think I spelled that right) and we had a very yummy dinner.  My burrito was huge! hehe I like things big hehe Anyway, Since we were sitting next  to one another we inspired another young couple to sit next to one another... aww ain't that cute.  We had their attention and the attention of the couple behind them throughout the whole meal.  I think they were just looking at the hottie I was sitting next to.  hehe.  So after a good meal we decided to return to the house make out for a lil and then head to the park to teach me to Rollerblade.  We almost got a ticket for parking in the park because apparently the park closes at 10 and it was 10:30, stupid rules.  So we moved the car and kept skating.  I have got the motion thing down I'm just not very good with the stopping or the turning, but with time I shall get better.  It was alot of fun... I was a dork... Nathan's cute when he's skating...plus from behind, yummy.  Anyway..... ahhhhh.. ok I'm back.  So I can kinda rollerblade. hehe.  Thank you Nathan for such an awesome night... working on cars, good food, skating, your right though it was missing one thing... ahh..next time. And so, I had a nice fast drive home last night. Was home around midnight.  Got online for a few minutes then crashed.  I gotta say that I love how Nathan is cool with my "tomboyish" side.  hehe... hehehe...   So I guess this is the week for working on cars! Nathan's Jeep, my dad's Chevy.   I just came in from helping him put a crank in his engine.  I smashed up a finger, but I don't think it is going to bruise.. cool.  Anyway.  I'm not sure how I'll spend the rest of my day.. I am waiting for my resume from someone so I can begin sending it out.  Other than that I think I'm just gonna try and relax and get some rest before the weekend comes.. it's the fourth of July.. I love the fireworks.. I love the outdoor bbq's, the alcohol.. wow so many good memories of the fourth. cool...

      What a day.  I have been such a major slacker and you know what I don't care!!! I need this little vacation that I am taking and I don't care what anyone else thinks!  So yeah last night I got in early and let Becca and Johnny do their thing in private.. ehehehehehehehehe. Had a really nice sleep and great dreams, oh boy!  Anyway.  Woke up to an empty house and went out side to tan this white little body of mine.  Well I came in to put on some shorts so I could help my dad take the hood off his car and I saw Becca online. Well I talked her into coming over to lie out by the pool.  She came over and we toasted our little bodies then took off to Orange County to pick up my mom's Ford from Barry.  The paint looks awesome.  Since Becca has never been in the Ford I took her for her first ride.  We cruised to Frisco's and bought some burgers. then it was back to the pool and more burning.  I tried to help Becca study for her geography exam and hopefully she'll do ok.  My dad came out and told us it was 4 and Becca almost freaked since her class starts at 5 and she'd have to battle traffic to get there.  But I know she'll make it.  Anyways, I took a look at my body and since I am wearing my new bikini top I am fried all over... but it doesn't really hurt yet.  Nothing a little lotion won't fix.  So I then proceeded to help my dad work on the Chevy (while still in my bikini, hehe, car magazines would love that!)  We pulled out his engine and had a hell of a time because the crane got stuck on something.  We scratched a small section of the paint and sent antifreeze all over the place, but it's all good.  Once the engine was pulled we noticed that there is a ton of transmission fluid all over the place, apparently a line leaked during our adventure.  So there is a huge mess out on and under the car, but the engine is out and ready to be worked on.  We might bring home the Mustang later this week. I am so excited that I am bouncing.  My mom doesn't want me to because she is afraid I will drive it even though there is no insurance on it.  I told her I am not that stupid, 'cuz it would be my luck that someone would run into me and total out the Mustang... then I'd have no money to fix it or buy my Jeep.   So we'll see.  I am hoping to have it home soon so I can start all the work I have planned.  I really miss working on it and am looking forward to gettting my hands dirty again. Hehehehehehehe. Anyway.  That's the extent of my day thus far.  It's been pretty cool. I should head over to Old Navy and see if I can find the matching bottoms for the Bikini top that I bought yesterday.  It's really cute and kinda sexy.  I also bought this really short denim skirt and these super tight jeans, oh and a whole bunch of tank tops, so I am ready for summer. Woo hoo.  Watch out boys here I come. ROFL. NEwayz, I'm outtie for now.  (My shoulder is burning.. where the hell is that damn lotion?!) Oh yeah.. .. Jonathan was jealous that I was hanging out with Becca by the pool today ..... ROFLLMAO too funny... dumb ass!

      Well it's now time for the weekend update with none other than me, Patti.  Friday - Began the day with laundry and cleaning.  Spent next to no time sitting and relaxing, which was kinda good since I needed to be on the move.  Nathan came out earlier than originally planned, which was cool and after a nice hello we took off to Torrance to Islands.  I had a certificate from Carla and her note was to take my cutie out for a good meal... So I did just that.  After dinner we cruised around PV, through the fog, and had a nice chat.  I also took Nathan to one of my parks and we were disappointed to see that the swings were all wet with the dew :-(  So on to the movie theatre.  I had wanted to see The Italian Job anyway so I was glad that we saw it.  Nathan was kind enough to let me rest on him during the movie... he's so comfy!  Anyway, after the movie we came back to Downey and tried, to no avail to find a store to buy some drinks.  So back home to watch one of Nathan's movies and enjoy some time together.  Nathan fell asleep while I watched my Metallica DVD.  At about 5:30 I heard my mom get up so I went out and chatted with her.  Finally I came back into the room and melted around 6.  We awoke on Saturday morning to an empty house which was very nice.  Have I mentioned that I really enjoy waking up next to him. :-)  Anyway, we ventured out to the junk yard and had no luck finding any Jeeps or parts that could work on a Jeep.   So we ventured out to the performance center.  The selection on their floor sucked and they could have provided a larger showroom with all the space they have in the building.  So back to Downey we went.  We decided to go swimming and get a bit of sun.  My parents did a lot of cooking and I asked them where the army they were planning to feed was.  But the food was yummy, I only wish it wasn't so hot so I could eat more.   We then went to the dinky little movie rental place to find Braveheart, but that didn't work... So instead we rented another one of Nathans favorite movies.  I really enjoyed Traffic!  So many good movies that I now like.. hehe.  Well Nathan had to go :-(  So Becca and I decided to hang out.  We took off to get some Coldstone, yummy!  Then it was off to cruise the beach.  The weather was great and we took a nice long drive.  Had a ton of good girl time.  On the way home Johnny called and wanted to know if we were up for hanging out.  I said sure and we took off to his place.  Well Becca and Johnny hit it off like I knew they would, hehe and we hung out and talked for a while.  They couldn't decide what they wanted to do and I was too tired to decide, plus the one thing I wanted to do was in MoVal and well probably already asleep ;-)  So finally it hit Becca's curfew and we took off.  I came home and crashed out.  I had a good rest which has been really rare lately.  Then woke up this afternoon after a ton of IM's and calls ;-) from Becca.  I went out and helped my mom get the carshow stuff ready then loaded up my bike and headed to Torrance.  Becca and I loaded our bikes into her dad's truck and took off to the beach.  We took a nice ride along the strand and can I say that there were sooooooo many good looking hotties out there.. oh my gosh! and Becca goes speeding past this group of really hot guys... Damn... of course I slowed down to get a better look. She and I decided that we absolutely must spend more time at the beach. hehe.  Anyway, we stopped on our ride at Ruby's to have burgers and chat.  The restaurant next door had a live dj and was playing all sorts of dance music.  They played Nathan's Shiny Disco Balls song and I had to text message him about it.  Becca and I were cracking up.  It was a blast.  Remind me to not let Becca order anything that spills! LOL   Anyway, after lunch we headed back to the car then back to Becca's house.  We then went to Old Navy and did some shopping.  I bought some really cute stuff.. damn it, I'm supposed to be saving money and there I go spending it on clothes... ROFL  oh well.  Anyway, we headed back to her place and showered then got dressed and headed out.  We went to one of the parks and went to play.  There were lots of cute little kids running around on the playground.. they were really cute.  We played on the swings and then I got really nauseated and told Becca we should probably go eat.  We called Johnny, because Becca wanted to see him, and decided to meet up at vinces.  Well we got to Vinces at 9:05 and they were closed so we headed to the Olive Garden.  There the three of us ate and I ragged on Mike and we had a good time. I forced Johnny to sit by Becca (by not moving) and let the magic work between them.. hehehehehehe.   After dinner they wanted to go do something and I told Becca that I was too tired and wanted to go home (uh huh, sure)  So we went back to her place and I loaded up my bike and set off home... wonder what they are doing.. hehehehehe.. I'm such a great match maker.  ROFL. Anyways, so now I'm home and a bit lonely.. missing that special someone... damn I need to move to Riverside.   So as you can see I had an excellent weekend. I spent it with the people I care most about and did lots of fun stuff.  I shall be off to bed soon as I have to help my dad work on his car tomorrow and I need to apply for some jobs too.  If I ever get that edited version of my resume from someone ;-)  I'm outtie for now.

      Ok.. so I am back home, Nathan had to go to work this morning :-(   Anyway.. I know I should finish the update of the week but I shall write with what I kinda remember, Last night. So Nathan's "bad ass" party was last night.  We cleaned his house and made it nice and spiffy for his guests.  He had quite a bit of alcohol and we went to the store and picked up a bit more just incase.  Will arrived and brought some Rootbeer and Smirnoff Vanilla Vodka.  We headed to the kitchen and he created an "Ice cream float."  Boy was that good.  So Nathan's friends begin to arrive and Will and I decide to play some card games.  We begin with Will teaching me his "Bond Game" and then decide that we need to have a drinking game.  So we decide it's black jack and vodka time.  I would like to say that Will must have rigged the deck, because I lost about 4 hands in a row and had to down a full shot for each.  By the end of the game Will had like 3 or 4 shots and I had about 7.  The bottle by this time was missing quite a bit of liquid.... and boy is it good liquid.   Anyway, while we were playing Anjane came over and she, Will and I decided (more them than me) that Nathan is a light weight that is all talk... Sure he says he drinks alot and can handle it, but no one has ever seen him drink as much as he says.  They agreed that he "milks" his drink and tries to play off as if he's had a lot.  Ok... I know he's my man and all but this had me rolling and I decided to go with the flow and agree with them. ROFL.... Anyway, after my game with Will was over and my buzz was beginning to kick in, Nathan decided to come join our game.... Well there was no way I was drinking anymore without eating (since I had only had cereal for dinner since I wasn't originally planning on drinking much) and Will and I wanted to get some food.  So Nathan came a bit late to our game, if only he would have arrived sooner then I wouldn't have had to drink so much.  So anyway, I decided to give in to the alcohol and Will and I jumped in his car and took off to Jack in the Box.  We grabbed some food and headed back to the party.  Nathan seemed to be enjoying himself with his friends and Will and I were having fun so we ate, cracked jokes and all was good.  I decided it might be best for me to get some fresh air so Will and I ventured outside.  We sat and had some good conversations, burned a worm, enjoyed ourselves.  I'm the most shy person I know so it was good to be with someone that likes to be in the background too.  Nathan came out to visit us and we sent him back inside, primarily because it was his party and we didn't want him to miss it.  As we sat and talked I let the vodka roll through my sytem... sadly my mind was completely alert and sober but my body, due to lack of sleep, was another issue.  We went back into the house and invaded the cd player with Marilyn Manson.. ahhhh good music.  Nathan was playing some game at the table and we were dancing in the living room.. ... Oh yeah, mirrors are cool 'cuz you can watch people without them knowing. Muwahaha.  At some point Will and I were orgasming together, I think that was his idea, ROFL, then next thing I know I'm wrapped around him and he's carrying me through the house....  Hmmm getting more attention from the best friend then the boyfriend.. what a drag... yeah well... anyway.. Will and I ventured back into the kitchen for more drinks.  Who the hell plays "truth" or "truth or dare" anymore really... it's such a high school game.. geez people... Anyway.... so watched someone make flirty passes at my man, but that's cool.  Walked Will out to his car and had another really good conversation.  We noticed the cars were leaving and we said our ados... I went back into the house to find that Nathan already had almost everything back to normal.  So the house was clean the party was over... I had a nice time with a good friend... It was definitely interesting to not be the watcher that I usually am.  And maybe that's a good thing.. anyway.  Went upstairs and had a brief chat with Nathan.. apparently there was some sort of misunderstanding.... I don't really remember much... things are starting to blur.. oh well.. I do know that I woke up, after about 3 hours of sleep, feeling good yet crappy at the same time... Currently I feel fine although I am really tired.. But other than that things are cool.   So I left MoVal this morning... Didn't want to ... would have loved to stay in Nathan's arms all day, but oh well, what can I do.  Anyway.. I'm sleepy and the house is quiet I'm gonna go take a nap.

      Ok... so I am still in Riverside...  Traffic was well the usual.  I sent Becca a text message that explained my insanity of the drive LOL.  Anyway, I got to Moreno Valley shortly after 5pm, even though I left my house at about 3:15PM.  The weather out here is so nice.  Anyway... after a brief hello to Nathan we took off on our Rollerblades.  Slight inclines are not very nice.  I still need to learn to stop. I'm so used to my rollerskates that the whole stopping with the back of my foot thing doesn't really work yet.  Well we arrived at this one corner where I had to go onto the street and the "good" path had lots of little rocks and stuff that I didn't think I could manage... So I asked Nathan to come over to the curb to help me onto the road.. well guess what the momentum kicked in, I tried to stop with the front of my skate, and next thing I knew I was going into the Sunflower plant that was there.  So I feel back on my left elbow/arm and into the sticker thingies of the plant... word of warning to all... DON'T FALL INTO SUNFLOWER PLANTS THEY HURT!!!  So my left arm is scratched up, nothing too bad.  My back is a little road burned but not bad.  Nathan put some neosporin on it so it will heal nicely.   So yeah that was fun.  I still need to practice and I should do fine!  I like rollerblading I just need to get the hang of it.  Woo hoo... So now I am off to watch some movie or something.. YeeeHAWWWW ....

      K.. Let's see.. I think I'll cover Friday....... So Friday was the Fourth of July and also Will's birthday.  I spent the morning cleaning and took off in the early afternoon.  I arrived at Will's at 1pm as promised and found that he and Nathan were trying to hook up the stereo.  The weather was great and I was looking forward to swimming.  Well I wasn't looking forward to wetting my hair... as I had just bleached it a little the night before... but Luckily it didn't turn green... oh yeah I still have like two more steps and then I'll be back to the blonde I once was... hehe.  Anyway.  We swam, had great food that Will made all by himself.. yummy!  Then as the party came to a close Will, Ruben, Nathan and I went into the house to catch some of "Dead like me" which is a funny show... and the chick is hot!  Anyway, after the show I really wanted to take a ride in the Jeep and go see the fireworks.  Nathan happily obliged and we were off.  hehe.. I love Jeeps... So we found this one spot that wasn't all that great and on the way to look for a better one thie guy with a cool dogie told us about a spot he usually goes to and so we were off.  We found the spot with no problems, but there were already a lot of people there.  So we made our own little parking spot and didn't have any close company, which was nice.  Nathan decided to have a little chat once the fireworks began so I missed some of the show.. but it was WELL WORTH IT!!! hehehehehehe.  The firework show was awesome and the fact that I was sitting in the back of a Jeep with an awesome guy made it all the better.   When the show was over every one else went along their merry way and Nathan and I finished our conversation.  We had a nice little time creating our own fireworks until a truck/van came along.  What a conversation killer.  So back to Will's we headed.  Once there we finished watching "DLM" then decided it was time to head out.  Nobody had any ideas on where to go so I thought it would be a good time to head home before I got too tired.  The drive home was great and I was full of energy...primarily because of the chat/firework show.   So I must say it was an awesome holiday, spent with good friends and good food.  Gotta love it!  Hmm let's see... I'm not too tired yet so I guess I can begin to tell about Saturday...  I awoke late-ish.. hehe.. Nathan arrived in the early afternoon and we set out to clean the "Dark Prince."  Boy oh boy was it dirty!  After using all my daddy's fun cleaning supplies the Jeep was finally shiney and looked like a thousand bucks.  I told Nathan he better keep it clean (with exceptions made for offroading) or I would kick his butt... and I could take him if I really wanted to!  By the time we were almost done I was starving and Becca (who said she'd help but instead lounged by the pool... I still love you girlie) had to go see about a 4runner, so Nathan and I headed to the hole in the wall mexican joint.  We ordered a grip of food and brought it back to the house to have a nice meal near the pool.  I think Nathan liked the food.. hehe... I'm glad he enjoys all my favorite places to eat.  Anyway... after we ate we finished putting things back in the Jeep... Becca came back.. Bill and Sue brought Abby over so I could go swimming with her... Nathan, Becca and I jumped into the Jeep and headed to Signal Hill.. My dad said there should be some places there for us to take pictures.. well there wasn't so instead we took a cone.  LOL.. that'll teach 'um.  Anyway... we cruised up 7th and headed to PCH.. there we decided to go to LoneStar to see if EJ was there.  And guess what! She was.. and she was our waitress again!  hehehe Yeah, she's hot.  So anyway....EJ remembered Nathan and was totally flirting with him and hitting on him.. I thought it was cute and a total compliment! Anyone attracted to my guy is definitely cool!!! Well for the time being...hehehe... So there was a slight case of mistaken identity with a guy at a table near us... Nathan was cute... great story to tell later..  we ate.. barked and moaned on the way home.. bought alcohol... came home.. Becca fell asleep.. Nathan and I watched "Phone Booth" which was good.. The acting was good too!  Becca took off after the movie... Nathan crashed until 4:30.  I finally crashed around 6.... It was a good and productive day.. did I mention that I love Nathan's Jeep.. *Must learn how to drive stick so I can steal Jeep* hehe  Ok.. Sunday. I'm too tired to write about Sunday... Plus I'm using my dad's computer, since mine is a POS!  So I'll be in Riverside until like Friday or something.. hehe I love spending time with my man.... I'm also planning on spending lots of time on campus, which I haven't done in a while.  Anyway... I don't know when I'll write more but I'm sure it will be interesting. :-)

Learn how to communicate a thousand expressions of love -- all without saying a word. Your Pisces will be able to read your soul by looking into your eyes. Be a good support to your Pisces; learn how to ground them without dragging them too far down to earth. Your Pisces will teach you how to notice shooting stars and pictures in the clouds. Think of ways to show your Pisces that a true love story of the classic variety can exist between the two of you today. They will, in turn, show you how this love story can last forever. Enjoy good art and fine wine -- your Pisces will love you for it.  Don'ts  Don't rely on your Pisces to be the financially astute one in the relationship. A Pisces would often rather leave financial matters up to others; their mind is in a different place. Don't reproach a Pisces too harshly for being a daydreamer instead of a doer. The Fish are known for being in tune with the spiritual, not the material. Never knock old-fashioned, hearts-and-flowers true love. Pisces believe that it exists, and are not going to be satisfied with a casual affair instead. Be careful not to step on your Pisces by accident; you may injure their feelings without even noticing. A Pisces might not yell or throw things when they get hurt, but they feel it very deeply all the same. Never treat your Pisces too casually; don't toy with them or let them see you play the field. A Pisces does not like this behavior, as it goes against their ideas about true love and spiritual connection. Do not subjugate their artistic impulses -- this is a truly creative Sign, and you may be standing in the way of their happiness and a fine piece of art.

      Well my computer is slowly dying! This bites.. now I think I may have to invest my savings into buying a new one. Bah... much sooner than I expected.  But on the plus side, I think I'm going to buy a laptop. Now I just need to start researching.   "The Neck"     A Daily Dose of Wisdom from the Rebbe -words and condensation by Tzvi Freeman 16 Tammuz, 5763 * July 16, 2003  Between the head and the heart lies a narrow passage called the neck.  This is to our advantage, so that when the heart rushes in frenzy over its desires and its fears, the head can still  observe from its perch above the rapids and direct the heart back on course.  It is also to our disadvantage, because the head must speak very loud and clear to make itself heard to the heart so far below.   You know how I love to reflect on things.  Well these two I thought were very interesting and could provoke several different types of thoughts.   "Man and Woman"   A Daily Dose of Wisdom from the Rebbe -words and condensation by Tzvi Freeman 9 Tammuz, 5763 * July 9, 2003  It is a mistake to consider man and woman two separate beings. They are no more than two halves of a single form, two converse hemispheres that fit tightly together to make a perfect whole. They are heaven and earth  encapsulated in flesh and blood.  It is only that on its way to enter this world, this sphere was shattered apart. What was once the infinity of a perfect globe became two finite surfaces. What was once a duet of sublime harmony became two bizarre solos of unfinished motions, of unresolved discord.  So much so, that each one hears in itself only half a melody, and so too it hears in the other. Each sees the other and says, "That is broken." Feigning wholeness, the two halves wander aimlessly in space alone.  Until each fragment allows itself to surrender, to admit that it too is broken. Only then can it search for the warmth it is missing. For the depth of its own self that was ripped away. For the harmony that will make sense of its song.  And in perfect union, two finite beings find in one another infinite beauty.   Gosh, so deep, so related to ways in which I am feeling.  The Rebbe is definitely one of my favorite thinkers.

      Ok.. I have decided that looking at the online version of the AutoTrader is very very very very BAD for me!!! There are so many really cool Jeeps within 75 miles of me that are for sale.. Bah... It sucks.. I found the perfect one too!!! Low milage, hard and soft tops, tuffy console, cd/casette player, everything... Bah.. I'm only lacking $3000 and the job to cover the insurance.  But I shall not be dismayed! This shall only motivate me to get the dream job that much faster so I can afford the Jeep.  So... I REALLLLLYYYYY WANT A JEEP!!! Ok.. enough whining.  Let's see.... Wednesday I went out to Riverside to pick up some applications and to fill out some applications with the school district.  We'll see how that goes.  Then it was off to UCR to see Nathan.  The weather was nice and warm and there was a cloud cover which made things nice.  Anyway, I met him behind the bookstore and we took off to his house.  Said hi to his mommy then it was off to find something for my computer, but alas I left the paper I needed in my car so that didn't happen. Instead we looked at DVD's and Nathan bought a really cool set of DVD's.  Then it was back to his place then off to the store to buy something to go with dinner.  Dinner was great, his mommy made yummy sloppy joes (one of my favorites) and a yummy pasta salad too!  I ate alot!  hehe.  We hung up some of Nathan's pictures and finally I got to watch Braveheart.  It is a very good movie, but the plot is predictable ;-)  Anyway, I really enjoyed Braveheart and I think I'm going to buy it for myself!  Oh... I think the VCR really liked it too, because it ate Nathan's tapes!  That really sucked and I felt bad for him since it's his favorite movie.  He's one strong guy though.  Anyway... after the movie we laid in bed.. which was nice, he has such comfy arms.. where was I, oh yeah... then we decided to do a little late night offroading.  We went back to the spot that had the big hill and found a nice little spot to look at the stars and well you know. hehe... Anyway, it was an amazing time outdoors, the sounds of the animals, the stillness of the night, the moon, the stars, what looked like the big dipper.. It was great.  And well just being with Nathan was all I needed.  So it was an awesome end to a day.  I ended up getting home at like 1:15am and was happy I had such a wonderful day.  Let's see, yesterday I did some house cleaning then went to pick up Becca from the airport.  We had a funny telephone conversation and then headed out.  We stopped at a place near Xerox for burritos and tacos and well the eye candy too.   The manager was totally checking Becca out, and she said he was too old... but he was really cute.  There were tons of military boys there... she was loving all the men in uniforms.  I had forgotten how many good looking people work in that part of El Segundo.. now I remember why I used to go there so much. Hehe.. anyway.. we had a good lunch then headed back to her place.  After watching Becca tantrum I finally decided I needed to go home... I still had a lot of work to do and the day was going by fast.  So when I got home I found that Bill and Abby were here. She is so cute.  Then Johnny (the carshow guy we're helping this weekend) calls my dad and asks if I would want tickets to a concert.  My dad hands the phone to me and I find out that he has 4 free tickets to the Counting Crows concert, well I wanted to go but wasn't sure if I would be able to find anyone else to go with.  I talked Becca into going and then decided to call my #1 boy and coolest friend ;-)  So I called Nathan left him a gazillion messages, I finally got a hold of him and he said he would like to go.. so one down. Will returned my call and said he would like to go too.  So we made the arrangements and I now had all the people that I wanted to go with me going.  Nathan and Will arrived early so we headed out to Torrance and picked up Becca.  We made it to  the concert right as the Crows were beginning their set.  I really enjoyed it!  It was great to sit there in my mans arms listening to such "foo-foo" music.  Will and Becca went boy hunting and were gone for quite a while. Nathan and I had a little fun of our own... mmmmmmm... anyway... it was great... and the guys that were sitting next to us moved... ROFL haha.. and the ten year olds, come on now!  Anyway, it was a blast.  After the set was over we found Becca and Will and did a couple walk throughs of the place.. saw some cute guys for them, but to no avail... then they dragged me out of the Staples Center to go to Deiday Reese (I'm not sure I spelled that right) in Westwood for icecream and cookies.  Well the line there was the same as usual and I think that Will and Nathan really liked it.  They were plotting something though.  Anyway, we walked around, followed this really cute guy that Will should have said hi to!!! Then found me a bathroom before my bladder exploded.  We were there about an hour and I know I was having a really great time... Everyone, except for me, got "white" stuff all over them... it was very funny.  So back to the car and back to Becca's.  On the way home the San Diego radio station was coming through very nicely so I had great entertainment while everyone else slept.  We dropped her off then it was back to my place.  The boys had to go since they had work the next morning and I came in after saying good bye and played on my 'puter for a while.  Had a nice sleep in my cool room... I put stuff on the windows to cool it down.  Although it has been raining so that may be why it is cool.. but I'm hoping it's also because of what I did to the windows.  The room is a lot darker now which is really nice. Hehe.. anyway..  Well my food just arrived so I'm gonna go

      People are absolutely amazing.  I was eating this morning and watching Good Morning America, well there was this segment about a man from SC Edison.  Apparently his wife was in a comma and his time off was running out.  Well his coworkers donated their time off to him so he could remain with his wife.  They donated over 300 work days worth of hours!  When I heard that I was amazed!  People really can amaze you.  To those individuals that donated their hours I applaud you! If only everyone had such caring hearts!

      Well Comicon is fast approaching.  I've been doing a lot of thinking and have checked my finances.  Well I've decided that I'm not going to go this year  :-(   I know, I know, I've gone every year for like what the past 5 or 6 years, geez I've lost count.  But there are a lot of deciding factors in this decision: 1.  It is pretty much the same thing every year.  Same booths, same people, same stuff. 2.  There is no one on the roster this year that I'm really excited to see. 3.  The cost is just too much, with all the trips and birthdays that have come up lately this is just an expense I can't really do... $30 to get in, anywhere between $30 - $40 for gas, Food which can range anywhere from $30-$100. 4.  In the past it was a weekend trip spent with a large group of friends and we'd crash at a friend's house, well that ain't happening this year and some of those friends that I know will be going this year I don't want to run into. 5.  If I am not working the car show I'd rather be doing something else that's more fun.  Comicon just doesn't sound like it's going to be fun. So, yeah, I was up pretty late thinking about all this last night.  I know it's so unlike me not to want to go to Comicon but my heart is not in it this year, maybe next year it will be different.  At least this way I'll save anywhere from $90 to $170, not  including what I would have spent on "crap."  So yeah, I'm happy about my decision.  I think I have made a very intelligent choice and not a rash one.  I've really thought this through, which is so unlike me. ROFL.... Anyway, now that this is out of the picture I need to find something to do all dang day on the 19th, that isn't going to cost much... that way I can still tell my parents that I'm going to Comicon and that the ticket is non-refundable and then I'll get out of hosting the carshow.  Hmmm... gotta figure out what to do... oh well... if anyone has ideas pop them this way.    I'm outtie for now... gotta do the job hunt thing.. lates.

      Well the official job hunt has begun!  I found several jobs I think I would really enjoy... but today was way too hot to work in this sweatbox of a room I have so I spent it in the cool water of the pool and shade.  Now tonight I can work on preparing everything to go out first thing in the morning. Woo hoo!  Wish me luck.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed and I know the perfect job will fall in my lap! It's about bloody time that it does.  So yeah, anyway.  That is perty much the latest update on that front and now time for the recap of last week...   So Sunday, that was like the 6th or something.. hmmm.. lets think back.. Becca came over and we spent some time sunning ourselves in the pool.  Bill and Sue brought Abby over and we taught her to love the water, she even goes in all by herself, it's so cute.  We had a yummy BBQ of good food that my parents cooked up.  Then it was time for Becca and I to release our boredom.... so we took off in her car and cruised around Lakewood, Hawaiin Gardens, Cerritos and Long Beach.  We even began to call people because we were so bored.  Nathan so graciously let us bother him.. hehe.  Anyway, we drove around for quite some time and then headed back here.  I don't remember if anything else memorable happened... I don't think it did.. But in all it was a very fun day.  Monday... I hate traffic.. have I ever told you I HATE TRAFFIC!!!! That's right.. It took me forver to get out to Moreno Valley to see Nathan.  But at 6pm I arrived and with some day light left we headed out in the Dark Prince to take some pics for Nathan's website and for the JA website too.  We found some great spots to take pics and great places for uh.. other things.. hehe... anyway.. On our way back to Nathan's we found this other hill that looked like fun.. so up we go.. we get to the top and Nathan says he thinks the path down the back will be better then the one we took up... ok .... so down we go.. then comes the big OH SHIT.. there is this drop and rocks.. hmmm very fun yet uh.. I'd never spotted someone going down a hill before... there was no way to turn around so down he came... and boy was it cool.. We got some really cool pictures as proof of the fun. (Gotta get me a Jeep!!!! or steal his.. hmmm gotta work on that driving stick thing)  After our little adventure we headed back to the house to get cleaned up  'cuz you know we were dirty... then it was off to pick up the half doors for the Jeep and dinner at the Spaghetti Factory, yummy.  We came back to Nathan's and had a nice evening together.  Off to sleep at last then it was up early in the morning so Nathan could get to work and I could go back to LA.  Ugh.. I hate LA.  Anyway.  I had a wonderful start to the week.  So Tuesday I headed back to LA and went by my Aunt Lee's house.. Well Jack and Jackie were over so we all decided to go out for a late breakfast/early lunch.  Then I spent a couple hours visiting with my aunt and running some errands.  We were all over Lakewood and Cerritos.  And boy was it a hot day too.. in that black little car.. ugh.  Anyway, I headed home and found out that the computer was not working so I spent several hours cussing it out and buying useless parts and Becca came over to try to help me relax.. and finally we all know how this story ends.  So Tuesday wasn't such a horrible day except for the computer thing.   Ok.. Let's see the movie that I watched on Wednesday was the Bourne Identity.. I must say it was very good.  Matt Damon... ahhhhhh.... *drool* ... oh hi... I'm back, anyway, very good movie.. could have picked a better leading lady though.  She didn't do it for me.  Oh well.   Crashed at Nathan's then on Wednesday night...  he's so cute when he sleeps... Gotta love him.. anyway...   Thursday.. woke up... headed to the donut shop.. grabbed a paper and some food.. then headed to UCR.  Nathan was already at work so I headed to the Rivera Library to do some reading.  As I was entering the building I ran into Rick.  Rick was Roland's old boss in Gov. Pub.  He asked how things were going and how Roland was, I told him about the moves for both of us and the break up and we chatted for almost 2 hours.  Rick has always been such a nice guy.  So yeah it was great to see him again.  So I headed up to the second floor (by the way the library has changed so friggen much, I miss my old dank, dusty, crappy library)  Well I found a nice secluded table by the window and began reading.  I look up not to long afterwards and who do I see but one of my old "bosses" from when I used to work in the Reserve!  ROFL.. Well he and I had a Hate-Hate relationship (I think it's 'cuz he was madly in love with me)  Anyway... I watched him out of the corner of my eye and at the instant he looked over in my direction I noticed that he recognized me and his face kinda went pale.. then he got up and left!!! The guy wasn't there more than 5 minutes and he left.  Oh I was rolling on the floor laughing it was so fucking hysterical!!!  I only wish I could remember his bloody name.. I remember the name of the cute frat guy I used to work with but I can't remember this ones..ROFL.. Anyway... So yeah that was funny... So I decided to head up to the fourth floor and find a private conference room to read in, so I wouldn't run into anyone else that I knew. Well I got carried away with my book, The Day the Voices Left by Ken Steele, it's such a wonderful book!!! Anyway, I was so caught up that when Nathan called to say he just left work I was totally shocked!  Mainly because it was 2pm and I hadn't even had lunch!!! So I met Nathan down in front of the library and we headed back to his place.  We decided to go to Jack in the Box for lunch, but when we got there it was all taped off by the cops and there was a new pt cruiser backed into a pole.. so we headed to Carls Jr.  We had a nice chat... discussed ties and button shirts and the girl in the car.  Very nice lunch indeed.  Then it was off to buy alcohol.. even though we forgot cups and milk, ROFL.  We came back to the house and cleaned and well the rest is history.  So it was another good day.  So I've already written about Thursday.  Let's see.... Friday I came home... things were not too eventful... Hung out with Becca and that's about it.  Saturday.. ahhhh Saturday..  Well I need to add a side note... I miss Nathan terribly when I am away from him, bah.. didn't think I'd feel this way so soon again.. Silly girl... ok... so Saturday... well Joy called on Friday and we decided it had been long enough and we needed to have lunch.. so she came over that morning and we headed to Roadhouse.  We had a very yummy lunch and a long conversation.  We came back to my place and continued our chat.  She's been having some issues with work.. hence the reason why I don't want to go back to corporate america at all!!!  So we chatted and then Nathan came (yippee).  She discussed her issue with him and hopefully she left with some good advice.  Well Becca soon arrived and the three of us took off to my parents first car show at the new location. We walked around and had lots of fun.  Becca tried beating up Nathan.  Becca got hit on by lots of old guys. In all it was fun.  My parents pissed me off but what's new.  Anyway.  So afterwards we brought the Ford back, piled into my car and headed to Friday's.  Friday's was fun.  We had tons of food and a really good waiter, too bad he wasn't all that cute.  There was a party on the other side of the wall that was clapping and having a good ol' time and there were a few instances where we felt inclined to join in.  What a blast.  So back home we came... So original plan was for all of us to get toasty on Becca's Absinthe.  So we open it up, Becca and Nathan take a quick drink from the bottle... boy was the expression on their faces priceless!!! Oh it was great... Well nobody really wanted to drink it after that. ROFL. So Becca took off since it was close to 11:30 and she had work the next bloody morning.  Nathan was about to leave, but I really really really wanted him to stay.  He decided to stay since he said it was too cold outside... woo hoo.  We had an amazing time together.. he's so  uh... complimentary. hehehe..  I drained him of his energy and we both fell asleep.  It was awesome to wake up next to him.  And I love to watch him sleep.  He looks so peaceful. Anyway, the alarm went off and he decided to turn it off. ROFL. We slept for another hour and a half and he decided he really had to go home to do his work.  So off he goes only to come back 2 minutes later to take pictures of the Bikini top on the Jeep. I stood in the door waiting because I knew he'd forget and then remember.  We took quick pics and then he was off.... I gotta move closer to him!!!  Anyway... I came back into my room.. worked on the computer for a bit then headed out to Becca's.  She and I headed to the Mall, ate at Islands... had a girls day... came back here and ordered pizza while we watched "The Englishman that went up a hill and came down a mountain" for her class.   She finally left and I came in to blog and vent... Then was calmed by Will and Nathan, they are both amazing guys.  And finally I was able to fall  asleep...   So I have just written a ton of stuff and I need to give my wrists a break.. I've got so much more to write about but that will come later... I'm outtie for the time being. Tubular!

      So I know I need to finish telling about my awesome week, awesome friends and awesome boyfriend, but that will hafta wait.. time to ponder.  So I am reading this article called " Pope says EU needs Christian base ," you can find it at the following link  urlLink  , and I realize that, wow, christianity is a big friggen deal to some people.  LOL   Well really what I started to think about is the fact that the EU is probably doing the right thing by leaving christianity out of their constitution and the pope is still just power hungry.  LOL... ok well really.  I think it is a fine thing that the EU is not including christianity into their new constitution, not everyone is christian so if they want to include christianity well then they should include all religions into the constitution as well.  I think a country can be highly religious without having to include their religious beliefs into the political mombojumbo.  So anyway, I thought this was interesting and that some of you may also.

      Oh my goodness.  So I went to bed at 12:30am and I've been up for two hours now.  I've spent the last two hours in bed tossing and turning.  I don't think I've ever been this excited about my upcoming day before.  Nathan hasn't told me anything about how we are going to spend our anniversary and I'm absolutely giddy!  I can't wait to spend such an awesome weekend with him.  I have some awesome things planned for Saturday and I'm absolutely sure he has some awesome things planned for today, so I can't sleep 'cuz I am so excited.  But this sucks because I'm afraid I may get really sleepy and need a nap at some point which will suck!  Bah.  But anyway, so yeah, he's the coolest, radest, most awesome boyfriend ever!  That is all. ;-)

      Alrighty.. I am reading Anne Rice's last book... Blackwood Farm... And I must say it is quite excellent.  I have been captured yet again by her elaborate story.  It is amazing how she pulls at my mind.    So.. I was reading this joke on JA earlier today and I thought it was great.  It was about "if a man wrote advice columns"  and boy was it stereotypical.  But it had me laughing so hard and gave me an idea.  So yeah... we women are to give blow jobs and fix meals as a main source of daily "love" for our man.  But I think the best idea is making your man a video of yourself pleasuring yourself.. hmmm now where is that video camera............  That reminds me of "Steak and Blowjob day - February 16th" (I believe that is the date)  Hehe what another great holiday.

      So today was a day spent online and doing other stuff.  Becca came out and we went to Frisco's for lunch.  It's so funny that I've made her addicted to it. ROFL.  Anyway, while we were at lunch I got a call from Brian P.  He's getting some of the old Copy Center gang together tomorrow at the Getaway Cafe in Riverside for dinner, drinks and catching up.  So it looks like I am going to be heading out to Riverside after all!  Well it's been a while so I know it will be fun.  Woo hoo Riverside here I come.  LOL.  Yep.  So I don't know what time I'll leave to get out there, but I know it will be early enough to miss traffic... so I'll probably be hanging at the University for a couple of hours while I wait for us to meet up at 6pm.  Hmmm I guess I could read my book under the Bell Tower. I haven't done that in a while.  Yeah, so I'll probably try to get to Riverside before 4pm, that way I don't sit in traffic for FOREVER! LOL.  Anyway... I can't wait. Ok.. I'm off to make a cool video. hehe.

      Better start living now!   Young.  Really young.  I'd say anywhere from 15-35. But you'll go out with a bang.  You'll get in a car accident or be shot.  You'll never have to see yourself get old.  Sad though.  Really sad. By the way, its common knowledge that more people with great goals and aspirations die young.

      ROFLLMAO   Hanging. This is most like you because you want to make somewhat of a spectacle out of your death. It shows that you are organized and cool headed because you had to slip the noose over your neck, then actually hang yourself. This is an almost painless way to go...you may not dislike pain but you prefer no pain. You are different than gun shot in that you are not impulsive and you have thought this through thoroughly.    urlLink   What Form Of Suicide Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Well I am going to get a laptop.  If funds permit.  I think I have it all picked out too. Yippee.  Finally a laptop, I've been wanting one for so long!  So today started out sucky.  My computer crashed a gazillion times it seemed.  Oh well.  I did get stuff done though.  I did a lot of reading and relaxing which is good.  And I had a nice day.  Becca came over this evening and we headed to Friday's to get some food since she was hungry.  We ended up sitting next to this table of 8 really hunky looking guys... Boy did we have our share of eyecandy!!!  I let Becca have the seat that gave the best view.  I was more interested with what was on the tv. ROFL.  Sheesh.. what's come over me! ROFL.  Anyway, Becca thought a couple of them were really hunky.  So I had this yummy strawberry shortcake sundae.  MMMMMMMM.   Then it was off to B&N, as we walked past the group of guys that Becca didn't even look or smile at. BAH.  Went to B&N didn't find the book I wanted, didn't see the person Becca wanted to see, back to the car.  Back home.. now I'm here chatting with a cutie and getting ready to order my laptop... woo hoo. ok.. I'm done rambling. buh bye

      Well yesterday was blah.  I spent part of the day on the raft in the pool.  I am getting a nice tan, and it's about time!  Then Becca came over and I got ready to go to the car show.  Well it was hot and humid outside.  Bah, I was dying!  We got to the car show at 4pm and were bored out of our minds.  It turned out that we only had about 84 cars because of the weather.  I don't blame people for not wanting to come, it was miserable.  Although it was kinda cool that Johnny's wife, Carolyne, gave us free hot links and drinks.  We started the raffle at 7 because there was so much to give away.  I had a better time MCing then I did sitting around.  Lots of fun was had making fun of the soccer boys!  There was this group of really hot guys, OMG, but of course Becca wouldn't go say hi.  Bah! If you want a guy you need to introduce yourself!  Anyway, despite their checking us out no numbers were gotten :-(   Although, the cutest one won for best muscle I think.  And he's from Downey, hmmm maybe it will inspire Becca to like Downey more.  ROFL.  Well My mom won one of the big (3.0L) bottles of wine, which she gave to me... woo hoo... Babe, We are going to really enjoy ourselves with this ;-)    Anyway, so when the show was finally over Becca and I took our booty and headed home.  After a quick bite to eat Becca and I started the long process of highlighting her hair.  I just have to say that long hair is a bitch to pull out of those caps.  But by the time we were done it came out ok.. although I think that Becca learned not to listen to my mom, ROFL... Anyway, I think it looks pretty good and hopefully she likes it.  Well I guess I will just have to wait to see her in the light, then I'll know for sure.  It was around midnight when we were finally done and Becca had to head home because she had to work in the morning.  I got online and chatted for a few minutes with this really cool guy.  Then it was off to bed.  So I got to sleep in today, but my head has been hurting and the middle of my chest wont stop hurting.  I'm not sure what is wrong, but man it hurts like a biatch!!! Oh well.  I think I am going to try to eat and maybe rest and then hopefully the pain will go away.  Bah... If that fails then it's time to find the meds.  LOL.

      Well yesterday began my IE adventure weekend.  I rolled into Moreno Valley in the early afternoon and spent some quality time with Nathan.  Then it was over to Will's to eat a yummy BBQ chicken pizza from Trader Joe's and watch some tv while reading some great materials.  We decided to venture out into the city and went to Back to the Grind for some coffee and then for a nice long chat and walk.  We had a great bonding session.  Will is definitely a fun and interesting guy.  Came back late and had a visit from Nathan then I read a bit more of Blackwood Farm and it was off to bed.  I had a wonderful sleep and awoke without an alarm, very cool.  I spent the day lounging in the wonderful IE sun, visiting with Rocko and Padington, I think I have a new admirerer in Rocko, hehe, watch out Nathan. ROFL.  Anyway, I had a great relaxing day and finished JP from cover to cover, good issue.  Then it was on to BF, that book is amazing, I think Anne did and excellent job with this one.  I fell asleep while reading and had the most wild dreams, it was great.  So now Will is back and we're getting ready for another night of extreme fun... Thanks Will, he's such an awesome host! I'm so very glad that I met him and tht we are getting the chance to get to know each other better, he's one crazy cool cat! Lates!

       urlLink   This has given me an idea... Now that DNA can prove oh so many things for us mere humans here's my proposal...  At birth we take a sample of each child's dna, we put it on file with their fingerprints, this file is then used later in life to match fingerprints and dna samples from crime scenes etc.  Think of it, everyone logged, everyone known, no one could get away with anything.  Parents could use this as a way to keep their children in line "remember johnny if you steal that candy you'll be caught 'cuz you're already on file" oooooo.  See this could work.  Ok... so now whose gonna fund my idea?

Started with Tomb Raider (not enough of the Jeep though), dinner at the Mission Inn, a walk around downtown, back to my place, yummy breakfast, Pirates of the Caribean, dinner at the Orange County Fair, Alanis with James Mraz, the Orange County Fair afterwards, and Spiderman.  It was an awesome weekend with an awesome guy that is turning out to be the man of my dreams.  So today I hung out with Will and had yummy Coldstone, watched tons of Anime and we had yummy Thai soup thingies.  Definitely another fun day with Will.  Can't wait to hang out with him later this week too.

      Duets - A Daily Dose of Wisdom from the Rebbe -words and condensation by Tzvi Freeman 10 Menachem Av, 5763  On the other side of ecstasy lies a painful emptiness. On the other side of bitterness lies joy. Where one goes the other must follow.  In the ecstasy of understanding lies the gnawing pain of a new frontier of ignorance.  In the agony of yearning lies the ecstasy of love.  In the ecstasy of prayer lies the agony of smallness and distance before the infinite light.  There is no sweet song that is not equally bitter, save that which is shallow and meaningless.  He formed His world from delight and so must share in its bitterness. Until the time when darkness will shine.  - - - - - - - - - - - - Progress and Challenge  People live in varied situations. For one, it seems, everything is easy, for another there is one problem after another. Or a particular individual goes through different periods of his or her life. A time of ease and simplicity might be followed by a time of challenge. Hopefully, soon everything is calm again. But all too often it is not so simple.  Correspondingly, in response to our progress, G-d "opens" the spiritual realms for us. Beautiful! Great!  It sounds good; but there is also another mode. This is when we face challenges. Difficult problems, which seem to envelop us. Everything is dark. But we are not cowed by this. We gather our courage and tear through.   G-d responds to this by "tearing" the veils of existence. In a unique and incredible way, we glimpse intimations of goodness and holiness beyond anything we ever imagined. At that moment we see that all is One.  Through facing challenges, eventually we reach deeper and more incredible discoveries. That is the promise of the Torah, applying to every aspect of life [3].  3. Based freely on the Lubavitcher Rebbe's Likkutei Sichot vol.24, pp.39-40.  ----------   Blind Love - A Daily Dose of Wisdom from the Rebbe -words and condensation by Tzvi Freeman - 3 Menachem Av, 5763  The greatest gift of love is to turn a blind eye. The most essential glue of any union is the ability of at least one of you to say, "I understand. It's okay. Let's just get on with things."  After all, that is what we continuously say to our selves, out of our great self-adoration.  --------  I stop to reflect more and more as of late.  Things are changing and I'm glad for once.  I am the happiest I've been in a very long time!

      So, after doing a bunch of work this morning my dad asks if I'd help him drop the motor into the Chevy.  So out I head.  "This should take about ten minutes and we'll be done," he says.  I think to myself, "Sure."  Well sure enough 2 hours later we're still trying to get the motor mount fixed because the damn thing is bent.  After pushing, pulling, hammering etc we finally got the damn thing in, I should say I got the damn thing in as I did a majority of the work getting it in.  It's not as big as he thought it would be but it looks nice.  So yeah it ended up taking us 2.5 hours. Next time I'm gonna make sure the mounts aren't bent.  What an adventure that was, I kept poking fun at him "Ten minutes, hmmm, ten, you sure about that."  The funny thing was he didn't bitch at me at all. ROFL.  Anyway, that was how I spent the past several hours of my day.  I am still really greasy and dirty, gotta love working in them there bikinis.  So, I am off to take a shower and I think I may go and visit my aunt tonight, I haven't seen her in a very long time.  Later gators. =)

So we had a great evening, I so enjoy spending time with him.  And I absolutely hate it when he leaves.   So today is another day of searches, apps and getting things together.  Bah.  But like I said I am determined.

      K.. Just thought of something... In the list of concerts of all time that I have really enjoyed I must re-rank them.   First I must say that Blondie was the awesomest show ever.. second row center and I even saw her boobies.. hehe.. That was great.  The Hard Rock was cool too, I think that was one of the better times that I spent with Roland.  Anyway, second would probably have to be Alanis with Nathan which is tied with The Monkees.  Both were great shows that I really enjoyed.  The set ups were great and the sound was awesome.  Goldfinger at the Glasshouse with Darren really rocked and the Britney spoof was really hilarious.  Goldfinger at the grassy knoll was too cool.  Love watchin' those guys take a pee.  hehe.  Let's see what else... there was the Ringo Starr concert which was really fun... I swear that was funny.  Radiohead was probably one of the worst/best concerts, the lead singer guy was a real jerk.  Violent Femmes was cool and spawned the music video that noone recognizes me in.  There were a whole bunch of New Kids concerts but we won't go there.  Anyway, this weekend is Metallica!!!  I think that this might beat out Blondie for number one seeing as  Nathan and I have pit tickets.. hehe time to go kick some dorky long haired guys butts... hehehe and you know save Nathan's ass when he gets too involved in the excitement. hehehehe.  (I think I'm funny, I think I'm cool)  Anyway.. Nathan is standing here looking over my shoulder, so I think that's a sign to go.  So I am off to get dinner or something.  hehe.

      Well let me just say thanks to Will for showing me such wonderful hospitality.  I loved his comment about spending money on me, hehe.  NEwayz, Thursday was cool, Will made yummy spaghetti for dinner and then we headed to Trader Joe's to pick up food and yummy wines!  Then it was back to Will's to meet up with Nathan and go shopping for alcohol.  We bought some yummy stuff at the market and then went back to the house to relax a little before going off to sleep.  Nathan stayed over which was great, he and I had some excellent conversations during this little adventure.  Friday morning Nathan and Will took off to work and I headed to the shower to prepare for Becca's visit.  She arrived around 11 and after introducing her to Padington and Rocko we headed to Downtown Riverside.  We had a yummy lunch at the Spaghetti Factory (I took Becca's cherry hehe) and then it was off to explore the Mission Inn.  Becca I think has decided to get married there.. haha, but I had the idea first. LOL.  We then took a nice walk around Downtown and explored some of the really cool shops.  I also took Becca into the CMP and taught her a few things about photography.  The current exhibits there are great and I look forward to going back several more times before they rotate it out.  I definitely plan on taking Nathan, I think he would really appreciate the video and photos that are on display.  After our tour of downtown I took Becca to the MoVal mall to Spirit of the Moon.  On the way there she asked if we could go offroading, I told her we'd call Nathan and see if he was up for it.  Once at the mall we left him a message and did a little shopping.  I bought two interesting religious studies books and we did a lot of browsing.  Nathan finally called us back and was willing so we met him at Will's house and took off in his Jeep.  We headed to the hills where we watched the fireworks, then Nathan asked "Should we?"  knowing exactly what he meant I bounced excitedly and said, "Uh huh"  Then we were off to the BIG MEAN HILL!   We took Becca to the hill that Nathan and I found and he has the pics from on his website.  Becca's reaction was great "We're not going up that are we? No Way?!!"  "Uh Huh"  And off we went.  It was great, Becca and I were squealing with delight.  We made it to the top and the only way down was the other side, which as we began to go down Nathan realized would probably be different then the last time we went down because of the rain.  And it was! It was a bit slippery but a ton of fun.  As we went down the back we came to the point where we were on just two wheels, Nathan pointed this out to Becca by rocking the Jeep back and forth, her expression was priceless.  It was great.  We made it down the hill, and were followed by two motorcyclists. Then we decided to go do some more exploring.  We found a canyon area that looked like a mini grand canyon... and off we went, the sand was slippery but Nathan did a great job (Hehe)  We narrowly avoided hitting a nose dived car, apparently this canyon was the burial grounds for several old cars.  We ventured deeper in, scratched an slightly dented the front of the Jeep, because of the evil overgrown bush that liked to get its sticker things down the back of my pants!! Ugh. That sucked... but it was a blast.  Becca really enjoyed herself and so did I.  After we hit a dead end, well it was more like a tight squeeze between bushes we turned around and headed out the way we came.  By this time it was time to meet up with Will so we headed back to the house.   After a quick shower and discussion of where to eat we headed to Don Jose's (I believe) and had a yummy meal (the taquitos are great).  We headed back to the house to get ready for Will's party.  Nathan, Becca and I had a little pre-party entertainment before we headed downstairs to be with the others.  Becca is such a cutie when she's buzzed, hehe.  Nathan makes a great seat.  Absinthe should be drank with good cranberry juice!  hehe.  So Will had several of his friends over for the party, I had a great time being with Nathan, got to see Darren, enjoyed watching Becca.  I'm glad she controlled her bitchslapping tendency hehe.  The party ended kinda early and Will, Becca and Ruben (not sure if that's the right way to spell it) crashed.  Nathan and I well.. it's none of your business what we did.. but I do love his company... we were rudely interupted, but oh well... I think I finally went to sleep around 4am.  Nathan left early to help Andrew with his truck, I went back to sleep and awoke to Becca's telephone conversation, ROFL.  Then she and I invaded Will's bed and the three of us decided to watch tv.  So we watched some tv, ate some yummy food and then Hell froze over! LOL Will you crack me up, thanks for that laugh!  Becca and I took off at around 2 and headed home.  We ordered a pizza and chilled then went to Becca's to await Miriana's call.  I watched a really interesting show on the Mayan kings origins that were found through a dig that occured, it was so cool.  Then we picked up the girlie and headed to Starbucks.  Had lots o' fun there then it was off to B&N.  The girls went to cause trouble in the sex section while I headed to Eastern religions to read up on some things.  About an hour later they came looking for me and joined me where I was sitting.  They read some interesting astrology books, I found "Horoscopes for the Bastard Male," I believe it was called, especially entertaining.  We read for another hour or so then decided to get some alcohol in Mariana.  So off to my place.  We hung there for a while, then I got way too tired from my previous days activites, so the girlies left and I came in to be on my computer and hit the hay.  In all I must say that was an extremely fun 4 days.  Today was spent by the pool with Becca, our tans are becoming lovely, and at Target.  I bought two bottles of hair dye to do my hair tomorrow since my mommy said she'd help, hehe.  I'm going to be so blonde hehehehehehe.  Anyway, I'm reading some excellent books right now, so I think I'm gonna go back to reading them.  Yeah.. ok.. that's it for now.

      Man was I bitchy last night.  Considering the parental drama, my migrane that I had due to my wisdom teeth moving, the pain from my fever blister, sheesh I was bitchy.  To those of you that I was rude towards I am so very sorry.  :-(   I was miserable yesterday and now I am miserable today because I know I hurt some peoples feelings, and I am soooooo utterly sorry.  Anyway, today is a much better day, my mouth and lip are really sore but the pain is not as intense and all encompasing as yesterday.  Hopefully it will be gone as soon as possible.

      I have determined that when I'm pissed off at my parents it is not in the best interest of my friends to "joke around" with me.  I've determined that this makes me pissed off at them too and that's not a good thing.  My parents make me very emotional and I can't deal with so many people pushing my buttons.  So as a warning to all you out there in the expanse, when I'm upset with my parents (like I currently am) don't fuck with me, I'll only get pissed off at you.

      K.. here is a tip for all you boys and girls out there.  I just learned this trick from a website and boy does it work. If you have a door that gets stuck or sticks when you try to open it here's how you fix it.  Go get some car wax, that's right car wax.  I suggest Mothers Canuba Wax.  Anyway, take the way and apply it to the jam, the edge of the door, anywhere where the door touches the frame and on the frame too.  Now close your door.   Open it! Wala no more stuck popping door.  It's so cool!  I just had to share this tidbit of knowledge. hehe.

      Unbelievable how hot it is!!!  Anyway, I just finished reading Nathan's blog about the Metallica concert and he did an excellent job summing it up.  (I think I may steal some of it and post it here, ROFL)  Anyway, I'm still super giddy from the concert!  And yes babe my left ear is still ringing.  ;-)   Sucky thing is that I have a fever blister from the heat, damn it.  Oh well it will be gone soon!  Let us see.. oh yeah.....    METALLICA ROCKS!!!

      So this weekend has been a blast!!!  Friday I headed out to Riverside and hung out with Nathan, we had yummy stir-fry that his mommy made... mmmmmm.... Then it was off to Margaritaville to party with Darren.  We of course arrived early, ran into someone that Nathan knew, then Darren, Anjane and Monica showed up.  We danced our booties off, had a non-Screaming orgasm, danced somemore, then came back to Downey well into 3am.   Saturday we arose later than usual and headed to Frisco's for some yummy fuel before the show.  (It took forever for us to get our food) Anyway, we took off around 2 something, got stuck in traffic and finally made it to the Colluseum.  Parked at USC and went to find the very long line at the gate for entry onto the field.  That's right, we had Pit tickets...hehehehehehe..... Anyway, we got in just as Mudvayn was finishing up their set, no biggie.  We sat, chatted, enjoyed eachothers company, then it was time for Linkin Park. Even though I wasn't a big LP fan to begin with I must say that they put on a very good show and are very trendy cute.  I enjoyed their set. It was time for a potty break, I got behind a girl (good idea Nathan) and luckily got a clean portapoty!  Then it was a short break for Limp Crap!  I'm sorry but they SUCK!!!  They only played like 4 songs and Fred Durst is an ugly ass.  So yeah, they bored me!  We had some time before Metallica so we made our way to the front.  We were really close to the front and had to wait a very long time for them to set up.  We were highly entertained by the women that were flashing their boobies off and the old people that surrounded us.  Nathan was a perfect gentleman.  I must add here that I am so glad that I went with him... he made the whole thing so much fun!  Anyway, so Metallica finally began their set and they started with Battery.  OH MY GOSH DANG GOODNESS!!! They so rock!  I must say that Metallica is the awesomest band.  I loved it!!!!  They are so amazing live!  I had a huge smile on my face the whole time!  It was great!  I got to bang my head around and enjoy myself alot!  It was great! *bouncing giddily in remembrance*  And Nathan's so cute when he's listening and bobbing to the music! hehe.  Anyway, Metallica was amazing, I have made them my #1 favorite band of all time and #1 concert experience.  I can't wait to see them again!  And no more of those "seat" seats, it's pit from now on baby, yeah!  Anyway, it was awesome.  Nathan bought me a really cool tour t-shirt and I had such a blast with him.  Thanks babe, you rock and you are so totally hella rad!    I'll add more later as I need to take a shower and change and stuff.

      The Idiot Savant  -  A Daily Dose of Wisdom from the Rebbe -words and condensation by Tzvi Freeman 12 Menachem Av, 5763  There is an urge within us, at once both imbecile and ingenious.  Imbecile, because it will not look beyond its mud hole and move on.  But within that mud hole, ingenious. Because to defend its stance it will summon circumstance and DNA, unfit parents, incompetent teachers, society, evolution, creation, low self-esteem -- a myriad of excuses to avoid making one step ahead. Every excuse but the real one: Its instinctive obstinacy that it must remain in the mud hole it knows so well.  - - - -  How very true.  We get caught up in patterns and excuses, anything to make the downward spiral we are on more acceptable.  Some of us never find the strength or courage to pull ourselves up and out and move on.  I have found the strength and courage, that I need to battle that which lies before me, in a wonderful man.  I am truely  greatful and thankful each day that he is a part of my life.  He has made me believe in myself, which is something I haven't done for a long time.  To him I say thank you!  You have changed my life in so many ways and I will alway s appreciate you for it.    ____________________     The Withered Lover    urlLink   What sign of the Black Zodiac are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Who knew I would be my favorite jewel!!!

      I swear, as soon as I get some damn medical insurance *swears at ex* I'm going to go get a cat scan and all those other fun tests.  My headaches have been getting worse and much more frequent.  The sucky part is that I'm not exactly sure why.  Oh well, hopefully it will be nothing serious, and something that meds can cure.  (My head is currently pounding, if you hadn't figured that out yet.)  So things are going ok.  The cool job I thought I might get well I didn't get it.  They chose to not accept me because of my commute.  How horse shit is that!?  Really, but I've thought about it (thanks honey) and have decided that any company that would make a decision about hiring someone based on something that should be that persons decision is a crappy company and not one that I want to work for.  But the experience has led me to determine what exactly I want my life path to be, so that is good.  I'm still going to get my teaching credential, but I've decided that I want to make a difference in other peoples, especially kids, lives.  I've decided that I want to spend the rest of my life helping kids discover themselves and their inner beauties and intelligence.  There are a couple of people in my life that were wonderful role models and friends as I was growing up and I want to emulate their goodness by helping others.  So yeah, I have decided where I want to take my life.  Now I just need to find the right job.  And so the hunt continues.    I spent a great day with Nathan yesterday.  I kidnapped him when he got off of work and took him on a little job searching adventure.  He was a very good sport and he even bought me a yummy chocolate covered cherry blizzard!  He's so cool.  So when we got done with the yummyness he took me on a brief tour of his old high school.  I tripped out because their mascot was the vikings too!  Wow, crazy!  So he showed me around and I could understand what he meant when he talked about having pride in your school when no one else does.   So after the brief walking/vehicular tour we took off to find something to do.  Well since the used bookstore idea was a bust the last time I was with him, sorry babe, I suggested we go to the one that I knew about in Downtown.  So off we went.  I couldn't believe it when I went to the back corner of the store to go downstairs and the stairs were blocked!  Apparently they are not letting anyone in the basement anymore, which is a bummer because they had a lot of great books down there.  We browsed around the shop for a while and then i had the idea to go to the Mission Inn and chat.  So I took Nathan to my favorite spot there, yeah I know it's not the prettiest or most interesting, but I like it.  We chatted for a bit and then headed downstairs.  Nathan sat in one of the big armchairs and i joined him on his lap, hehe.  We had a nice little chat and I told him something I haven't told anyone before.  After the chats we decided to go get some yummy food from my favorite place.  So we head to the car.  When we get to the car I realized that somewhere during our little adventure I have lost my sunglasses, Nathan drops me off near the book store and I head to the door, but as I'm walking towards it I realize exactly where I left the glasses.  I run to the car and tell Nathan that I'll be back and I take off at a fast walk to my spot at the MI.  As I am walking up the stairs I notice that Nathan has been following me, he's so cute.  Anyway, my glasses are right where I left them.  Good thing about the MI everyone is so rich they don't need to steal sunglasses, ROFL.  So now that I have my shades we head back to the car and to my fav place.  We have a short wait, during which we sit out front and have a lively conversation about S&M, ROFL.  Dinner was great, the bus boy was hot ;-)  the waiter was ok ;-) ROFL J/K.  We were in the kid section, maybe it's a sign. (I should work with kids, not the other type of sign you silly willys)  Dinner was yummy, so much good food in one day!  Then it was off to pick up the Jeep and head to Nathan's.  His parents were watching Chicago, I definitely need to see that movie.  We headed upstairs to do our work and hang out.  I got to be in Nathan's arms again which was really nice, it's definitely one of my more prefered places to be in life. hehe.  It was getting late so I headed home and was back before 1am.  I definitely need to move to the IE soon!!!  So it was another nice time with my man.  I can't wait to go Rollerblading on Saturday with him. hehe.

      Following the path that's created for you.  Walking the line that leads to your destiny.  You search and find what you are looking for.  An inner strength you never knew emerges as one believes in you.  Someone with the strength, insight and courage of a milenia has found in you what you had forgotten was there.  With strength and courage you seize the day, you battle to the top.  You will come out the victor, you will succeed, thanks to the insight of a lovely man.

       urlLink   Do we not teach art and art appreciation in schools?  Really isn't this taking things a bit too far.  David is one of the most well known pieces of art!  Communities should embrace art and culture and teach our children more!  We shouldn't hide that which is so amazing.  Big deal that David's weewee is showing or that the mermaids tatas show, it's ART.  Dear goodness we should be embracing the human body and it's beauty, rather than making it seem like it should be hidden and dirty.  The body is a wonderful thing and when it is displayed in art we should step back in awe at the amazing work in which the artist did!

      Well I had a headache for most of yesterday and all of last night.  Spent a very fun day with Will shopping, talking and eating yummy stuff.  Around 4:30 I arrived at Nathan's, since I hadn't seen or talked to him much since Wednesday it was great to see him again.  We spent lots of time talking and relaxing. He's such a sweetie.  We attempted to find a used bookstore, but that didn't work out.   So we spent the majority of the evening in each others arms watching "Evolution," "Speed," and "Behind enemy lines."  My headache came and went throughout that time and Nathan was such a sweetie to try and help me feel better.  I finally headed home around midnight and died on my bed, but every little noise hurt my head.  It finally stopped hurting and I drifted off to sleep.  Whether or not I had any dreams I have no idea.  But I did wake up with the "Shiny Disco Balls" song stuck in my head. ROFL. Oh well.  A week that was painfilled and evil on my head ended rather nicely and semi-in the arms of the man I love. hehe. :-)

      Nathan has got to be the radest guy!  So yesterday we were driving back to his place from offroading and he asks me if I want to do something else.  Well I ask what he has in mind and he says that if I want he'll teach me how to drive a stick.  Well I couldn't believe it, Nathan was willing to teach me how to drive the Jeep.  Of course I said yes.  So we went to the new school parking lot and he switched me seats... after a brief verbal lesson, a broken nail and the jitters I finally gave it a go.  I'm a little shakey on the take off but I had a few really nice goes!  Shifting is pretty easy and he said I do a good job at it.  hehe.  It was so exciting.  Overall I only stalled a once the other two times I was laughing uncontrolably.  So yeah, it was totally awesome.  Nathan even let me drive from the school to his house, which involoved rather major city streets!  When we got back to his place Nathan let me tell his parents what we did.  I was giddy.  His dad was amazed, he said, "He let you drive the Jeep? Wow, do you know what that means?"  Hehehehehehe.  I LOVE YOU BABE!  Thank you so much for letting me drive your baby, now I know how to steal it...*muwahahaha*

      Bah... Things always seem to never happen the way they should.  My computer is going wiggy, my dads computer is going wiggy.  So instead of working on my car this morning like I had planned I am now working on fixing two computers!  I think I am going to ask for help buying a Laptop for christmas rather than a car cover.  My computer needs a major overhaul!  Oh well.  Nathan said he would take a look at it the next time he's over, hopefully with the two of us working on it it will be fine. So since I have been working on these dang machines I haven't been able to work on my car at all today.  Ugh.  I really wanted to finish cleaning it up.  Oh well.   But I guess it's a good thing because my back and legs are still hurting pretty badly from my 6 hour wax job that I did to it yesterday.  So maybe one day of rest isn't going to hurt.  But I still have many things to do to it.  Just another project..  Oh so there was something funny that happened when we were bringing it home the other day.  My dad forgot the tie downs so I had to take them to him, well this guy was there and he wanted to buy my Mustang right on the spot, I told him flat out "NO" then he asked if he could buy the honda, well I figured he was a shady character so I told him no, plus I still need the damn thing. ROFL.  Anyway, it was amusing. Well I'm off to fix my computer now, seeing as I have my dad's up and running. :-)

      Well my Mustang is finally out of storage.  And it still purrs like a kitty. hehe.  Anyway, I am going to spend all of tomorrow washing, waxing and babying it.  I need to check all the points, add some transmission fluid, add air to the tires and give it a good look over.  Maybe even an oil change if I have time.  I just hope that tomorrow isn't as muggy as today was.  :-)  But yippee my baby is back, I feel whole again.  Now I just have to get cheap yet good insurance on it. Hmmmm.  Well I am excited I'll be taking Nathan's cherry and taking him on his first trip to Laughlin at the end of next month.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  Mike and Debbie are going to be there and I haven't seen them in ages. Woo hoo.  So I'm really looking forward to it.  What else,  oh I've finished the first 3 Harry Potter books that my mom won for me.  They are really addicting and good.  I have been enjoying them emensely and am glad that I had the time to read them.  I am going to start the fourth one tonight, it may take a bit longer to read as it's the biggest one so far.  But I definitely recommend the books they are a nice easy and entertaining read.

Until I get that awesome job I'm going to be enjoying Tulita and working on that experience thing.  Woo hoo! Life is stressfilled but with the love and support of my closest friends and family I know everything is going to be fine.  Plus I can always make Nathan go with me to the aquarium to watch the cute little otter play with the fake seaweed... that was so cute, I knew I should have taken my camera! ROFL.  Love ya babe.

      Is nothing sacred???? Really! Oh My Gosh!  So I'm sitting here, eating my dinner and watching the WB, since there isn't really anything else on and I'm totally bored!  So what do I see?  A preview for the WB's new show this fall, TARZAN!  Can't they just leave the classics alone.  Ok it was cool that they turned Buffy into a show, because the movie sucked ass.  Then they had to go and create Smallville.  Superman is cool and all but leave it in the comics!  And now Tarzan.  A book that I loved as a kid is now the next big show on the WB.  I can't stand it!  I knew there was a reason I stopped watching TV!  Geez, what other childhood story that I loved will they ruin!!!

I am taking the Mustang out there and I think we are going to take it to the car show on Saturday, which should be fun.  I always have such a wonderful time with Nathan, I can't wait. So my laptop still hasn't been credited to my credit card yet. I'm going to call again in the morning and see what's going on, because I really want it!  Grrr.  Anyway, I'm off to bed, I have an early morning and long weekend ahead of me.

      So much has happened!  Yesterday I bought my dream laptop.  It's going to be shipped to me sometime in the future and I can not wait, WOO HOO.  I'm very excited.    I spent a wonderful weekend with the man I love!  Got to drive the Jeep, worked a little on my tan.  Finished things on my to do list.  In all it's been nice.  So today was the first day of classes at Tulita!  At first I thought Austin wasn't going to be there, but his dad finally dropped him off and it dawned on me, ahhhh he's coming with dad of course he'll be late.  LOL.  Anyway, dad told us that Austin's been really medicated and has been slow to respond and that those verbal responses that he does make you can bearly hear.  Mom comes a few minutes after dad drops him off and tells me pretty much the same thing.  She said that the amounts of meds that he's taking are making him really out of it, although he's not falling asleep like he did last year.  Well of course one look at Austin tells me he is highly over medicated. I feel sorry for the poor kid.  When I saw him I rememebered how much I like him.  He's a good kid, all he needs is a loving stable home, not the mad houses that he lives in!  Anyway, so he spent the whole day on slooowwww motion.  It took him over 45 minutes to eat his lunch, I waited for him to finish everything because he looks much thinner than he did in June.  He was able to complete some tasks today but they just took forever because he was going so slow, and it's almost like he forgot how to do some things.  Anyway, we'll see how the rest of the week goes, I'm going to play it by ear and let him lead the way, I don't want to push him too much during the first couple of weeks, especially if his mom gets the doctor to start playing around with his meds again.  It's good to be back at Tulita, the staff are all really great.  I'm in a new class with a new teacher and aide, so this will be interesting.  We'll see.    So now a rant.... Over medicating your autistic child should be illegal.  These poor kids can bearly function and comprehend all for the sake of the parents sanity.  If we educators can create a stable positive environment that controls the childs behaviors the parents should also be able to create such a stable environment.  It's not that hard, all it takes is patience and understanding.  Ugh... I'm back to believing that everyone should obtain a license before they are allowed to have kids! If you can't pass the exams to get the license then your ovaries and testes should be removed!!! So many people are not fit to be parents, hell I may even be one of them, but god damn it look at the state of our children! This makes me sick!

      So today was another day at Tulita.  I'm telling you, Austin needs new parents.  I think the best environment for this poor little boy would be institutionalized placement.  He would do so well in a structured and balanced program, unlike the caotic life he has now.  I would love to just smack his parents up side the head!  So lets see what else about the new class that I'm in....well I must say that I'm not impressed at all with the teacher.  She's not suited well for special needs kids.  Hopefully the district will figure this out.  Oh, we have a zoo in our room.  We have two mice - snowball and freckle, two hamsters - muffin and rascal, and four illegal walking sticks, oh yeah and we have two frogs, there were three but one died.  So little rascal, he's so tiny, he fits completely in my one hand.  Well Suzanne asked me if I know anything about animals, I told her that I know a little and she asked me if I could look at rascal and figure out if anything was wrong with him.  So I pick him up and turn him over and his private area has some blood and puss.  I get a nice cold wet paper towel and start to clean him off.  He lays perfectly still on his back in my hand while I inspect and clean him.  After working with him for over 20 minutes I tell Suzanne that I think that Rascal needs to see a vet today.  So we prepared a little cage and she took him to the vet as soon as she left the class.  I am hoping that he'll be ok.  He is the cutest little black and white hamster.  I would love to bring him home but I know my parents would have a cow!  So I'll keep this posted with how the little sweetie is doing. :-)

      I'm telling you I am so sick of these parents that don't take good care of their kids, and expect us to be babysitters. UGH!  Oh well, today was picture day at Tulita and well things went well.  Since I wasn't sick this year I think that I'll look half way decent in the picture for once.  Woo hoo.  I'm so excited, Friday Nathan and I are going to Laughlin for the weekend.  Since he's never been it should be a blast.  We have so many fun things planned.  My friend is letting me borrow his jetski for the weekend, so we'll get to have tons of fun on it and the house boat.  I'm really looking forward to it.  I'm also looking forward to the break from work.  I know I deserve it. hehe.  Woo hoo.  *bouncing with excitement*  Let's see what else can I talk about.. hmmm not much else has been going on.  I've been so addicted to my new laptop, it's so cool... I love playing around with it!  Oh and school is going well, I have tons of weekly projects and readings to do, but at least the topics are kinda interesting.  So that's about it.

      These are some posts that I wrote at work last week and today... enjoy.  Friday- So I now have a cool little laptop that I can take everywhere with me and have loads of fun with.  I am so excited it is so awesome.   Finally no more crappy desktop!  Yippee  So tonight Nathan is coming over and my parents will be gone for the entire weekend.  I am so looking forward to spending some nice time completely alone with Nathan.  It’s going to be great even if we don’t do anything but sit around in each other’s arms all night.  Yippee.... Well I must get back to work. Bah.. Only one hour left then I get to go home!  Today- So Nathan and I ventured out in the Jeep one night as a way to alleviate our boredom.  (Reference Nathan’s post here) It was such an awe inspiring building.  I couldn’t believe that something like that could be out in the middle of nowhere.  Amazing.  I wanna be a scientologist just to see the inside of the buildings.  That was a fun night.  I am so glad that Nathan is so eager and willing to drive me around in his Jeep.  I must find a way to steal it from him... hmmm... Maybe I can drug him!  Hmm nah, he’s probably got a resiliance to certain drugs... hmmm... must keep thinking.   Oh, so today I am having a earlier and longer lunch than I usually do.  Austin came in to school today in an unbelievable state.  I couldn’t believe the nanny just dropped him and left.  He was GREEN!  Yes, Green!  He was so out of it and so sleepy.  We went to the assembly and he couldn’t even sit down... it was like his body wasn’t working.  Then we tried to go to speech.... Well we made it to Lo’s office, but he as just so sleepy and out of sorts that after 15 minutes we decided it was pointless and I brought him down to the nurses office to call his mom.  Well the principal called mom and told her that his state is just unacceptable for school.  As we waited a full 2 hours mom finally came to pick him up.  While we waited he wouldn’t put his feet up on the cot instead he put his head on my arm, shoulder and leg and fell asleep for a majority of the time that we were there.  Mom tried to play it off like he’s doing this to get out of school and to be brought down to the office.  I told her point blank that this is the first time we’ve ever brought him down to the office for more than 15 minutes and that he has been sleeping a majority of the day.  I let her know that he just wasn’t functioning.  She was trying to make excuses to keep him here, but I made sure that she took him with her.  I don’t think she was very happy about it.  Oh well, learn to take care of your kid!  So, see now I have an early lunch since he’s gone and I actually get to take an hour or even more if I want.  Score.  How nice.  And surprise, surprise I‘m not coming on Friday, hehe.  So I figure I have at least 6 sick days that are available to me before the end of December as I should more than likely be student teaching beginning in January.  So why not take these days and enjoy them! Right?  ROFL.  So I am going to take my first day this Friday, I need to call the sub line tomorrow so they may get a sub.  I’m really hoping that they won’t, that way they’ll see exactly how tough it is to work with Austin and that they just can’t expect me to work with him ALL the time, they need to see that I need frequent breaks too.  But I digress.   So I’m thinking I’ll take my next day, possibly days, surrounding the weekend that Nathan and I go camping, which means that he and I need to plan our camping trip, seeing as October begins next week. Hmmm.  I know it will be so awesome, as long as we do it before it gets too cold.  So that leaves me with 4 days. Hmmm.  Well I should take the November 1st, that way if I go to any parties I will have time to recuperate and I’ll be able to have a nice Halloween with my friends.  So... That leaves 3 days.  Hmmm... I should take at least one in November maybe around the middle of the month.  That leaves 2 days... hmmm.... I think the last two should be the two days before Christmas vacation begins.  That will give me a nice and slightly longer vacation.  Hmm... sounds good.  So this will be the tentative plan.  Sounds good so far, but it is subject to changes.  So today was a relatively good day.  Right now I’m sitting in the Library waiting for my 8 o’clock class to begin in an hour.  I’ve got my crazy class next... oh my gosh is the teacher out of his mind.  He’s so nutz.  He goes from one topic to the next and has me completely confused 90% of the time.  But at the same time he cracks me up and I really enjoy the laugh.  So it’s always interesting.

      Had an amazingly productive weekend!  Nathan came out on Friday afternoon and we had a lovely time together.  After our showers we ordered a pizza and some cheese sticks from Papa Johns and settled down to watch Amadeus.  (I find it amazing that Nathan had never seen it before!)  So we watched the movie, grubbed, ate lots of junk food and enjoyed each others company.  Since my parents were gone for the weekend it was nice to be completely alone again.  After the movie we played with my computer a bit and enjoyed more time with each other.  It was such a nice evening.  I awoke early on Saturday and watched Nathan sleep for a bit, he's so cute.  Then we finally decided around 11am it was time to be productive.  We headed outside and began our weekly ritual of car care.  We washed the Jeep (I of course had to spray Nathan several times with the cold water to put a nice big cheery smile on my face) then we cleaned up the Honda (I still need to clean the windows though)  and lastly we gave the Mustang some well needed attention.  A couple hours later all the automobiles looked pretty and we were hungry.  Nathan suggested renting Harry Potter 2 since we were not able to the last time he was here.  So we decided to make it an event and head to Arby's to grab lunch.  So 20 minutes later we had our food and our movie and we settled in on the couch to enjoy.  The movie, food and junk food was great, and the company was even better ;-)  Thanks honey!  After the movie we decided to buff out Don's doors so Nathan could return them to him this week, minus some of the scratches from our little adventure we had with Becca.  Then it was time to clean up and head out to Loretta's birthday party.  We arrived a bit late, but hey gotta make an entrance.  The first thing Lo said was "I've heard all about you! He's hot!" and "You guys make such a good looking couple!"  Gotta love Lo!  So we got a nice little drink from the bar, found the pool tables and well all I can say is that Nathan is a lucky bastard! ROFL.  How many games was it? 8?  So that was cool. We had cake, watched some old dorky people and had a pretty nice, random time.  We headed home a little after 11pm and had some more quality time together.  I loved falling asleep in Nathan's arms last night.  Wish I could do it every night.  So this morning we arose at 9 so that Nathan could make it to work on time.  :-(  But he was awesome and helped me with my endeavour to rearrange the kitchen.  What a job.  Thanks babe.  In all it was an amazing love filled weekend, that I can't wait to repeat.  I love you babe.

      So at 5 I was watching the goober race stuff (hehe) and well I fell asleep.  LOL.  My parents ended up waking me at 7pm for dinner.  I couldn't believe that I slept so long.  So after dinner my dad rushed into my room and old me to come with him.  I put on my pants and ask where we're going.  Turns out that Ronnie was having real bad trouble breathing, so we were headed over there to check him out and see what was going on.  Well when we got there he was in really bad shape.  We got him hooked up on the nebulizer and he was doing much better.  My dad went back over there to make sure everything is still ok and to take some of his other meds.  So yeah, that has been my evening so far.  I'm off to take a shower even though scrubs looks really funny.

      So I'm sitting here, and I'm flipping tv channels and what do I come across? The season premiere of Angel!  WOO HOOOOOOO!!!!!   I had no idea that it was on tonight and low and behold there it is!  Then even more news, Spike is back!  I'm in heaven!  I am so happy!  Hehehe.  So I do some research and it looks like Josh is going to bring alot of the old Buffy characters to Angel.  I think this season is going to be great.  This first episode was funny and I think well written compared to previouse season openers.  So I'm very happy!  Yippee...  I think this is going to be my most favorite season of Angel ever!  Anyway, we now return you to your regular scheduled programming.

      I had the most amazing weekend in Laughlin with Nathan.  I can't believe I've found someone that I love spending so much time with!  Thank you honey for a wonderful and amazing weekend!  So yeah, the weekend was jam packed with driving, water lounging, gambling, car showing, eating and most of all relaxing.  It was so nice to just unwind and not worry about anything.  Nathan definitely knows how to make me relax.  So I had a great weekend and now it's back to work and school, ugh.  Oh well.... oh yeah went offroading tonight, our really cool hill has been closed off and we can not use it anymore, until we find a new way to it, bummer!  But that just tells me that it was more popular than we originally thought.  Well I'm super tired, I'm off to bed. Night.

      So I am sitting here in my room, doing some work before I start packing for my weekend in Mo Val, when I get the feeling that I haven't had in a very long time... It feels like christmas!  Those winters back in high school, when it was dark and grey and cold.. it looked like it would rain any minute... you came in the house, lit a fire and sat by the crackling wood while watching faily oriented programming on the teli.... Yeah that's the feeling of christmas for me... where I would cuddle up in my fuzzy blanket with my cute little teddy bear and read my favorite books by the fire... so right now is feeling like that for me.  And I realize that I miss that old holiday feeling.  I miss the way holidays feel when you're a kid.  As you grow up you become so unconnected from it all that you don't pay attention to the little things.... So right now I'm grateful that this feeling has come upon me.  It makes me look forward to the upcoming holiday season.  I think it's going to be all holiday feeling once again for me, yippee.

      Well  I am having a blast out here at Nathans.  Went to the Science Library at UCR today and worked on my lit review, I am almost done and it's due on Monday, yipee.  Let's see, then we went to Don's and checked out the process of his new roll cage, that thing is Bad ASS!  Can't wait to see Zesty when it's all done.  Went to find a parts dealer, but of course it was closed... and well tonight it is yummy food, great company and who knows what else. Yippee.. I love it.  Why can't every day be this fun!

      Last weekend was so much fun... I hung out at Nathan's house, we went offroading, visited Don, had yummy food and relaxed.  I can't wait to spend this weekend with him too.  Today Austin was an angel!  It was amazing, he was such a great kid today, I knew it was there in him!  So I took Austin to the office to go pee and when he was done he sat on the bench to get his two gummy bears for peeing.  When he finished his gummy bears I asked him, "Are you ready to go back to class?"  Now lets remember that Austin never answers this question when I ask him, he just kinda gets up and follows me, so imagine my shock today when he replied quite clearly, "I don't want to."  I was so taken aback that I busted up laughing looked at him and said, "Uh ok." The other staff members in the room were in shock too, none of us could believe it.  So I said, "Austin, if you don't want to go back to the room what would you like?"  He looked at me and said, "Could I have a gummy bear?"  Well now that he is responding so appropriately and HELL HE'S RESPONDING, I said, "Well Austin you only get gummy bears when you pee and poo, do you need to poo?"  "No" "Well then I can't give you a gummy bear."  He tried his luck again and asked for another gummy bear and I told him no.  I gave him a two minute "rest" and then he stood up and walked with me back to class... well we raced eachother back to class.  But it was so amazing.  This was proof that there is a great little kid in there!  So after school today the Upper and Lower grades had a bowling competition.  I went to watch every one bowl, cuz I think they are nutz due to their rivalry... Well as I'm talking to some of the teachers Debbie, the secretary, comes over and asks me to sub for Colleen, the nurse, since she is coming late...  after some arm twisting I finally agree.  I was on a team with Debbie and Judy.  We did pretty well during the first game.... then towards the end of the game my ball, which had a jagged hole, sliced into my thumb.  So my second game wasn't so good.  But it was a ton of fun.  We may begin a Tulita league that bowls once a month.  I think that would be a ton of fun!  So I got home later then I wanted... I still have so much to do.. Ugh.. I wish the days were longer.  Oh well.

      I just finished a nice long shower after a wonderfully refreshing evening.  A couple of days ago two of the teachers at Tulita invited me to go golfing with them, since I haven't golfed in almost a year I said sure.  We met at the Lakes for a friendly round at 4pm and were done around 5:40pm.  My game was off but surprisingly I had a 54 and a 6 on the last whole!  It was alot of fun and afterwards we decided to go have dinner.  We traveled to this "deli" which turned out to be a really nice, yet kinda pricey place.  The ladies surprised me with the offer to buy dinner for me to initiate me into the "Our Lady of Golf" Club.  It was so sweet of them.  Dinner was great, we chatted about so many things and I really enjoyed getting to know both Laura Jo and Judy more.  The meal was really good too and the company was great.  I got a couple of text messages from Nathan during the meal which they thought was super sweet.  They kept telling me to message him back, but I didn't want to be rude.  We finally left the restaurant at about 7:30 and I made it home to shower, although I realize now that I missed friends, bummer.    I realize that golf is/was a very theraputic sport for me.  I have not been sleeping well at all since these problems at work began and well I've been bitchy and moody towards people that I shouldn't be.  I think that during these tough times at work I need to stay extremely active and not stop to think about things, otherwise it will be like yesterday - barely ate anything for lunch, didn't have dinner, couldn't sleep all night, felt like throwing up the whole time, was crabby towards some people... Yeah it's not a good thing.  So tonight I feel refreshed.. I'm still upset about the work situation and I still doubt the trust I was building with "newer" coworkers... but I know that there are two people I trust most in this world and well we'll just leave it at that.  Oh yeah... I love to play... Austin and I played almost non-stop today... it was a blast.. we had tons of little tickling and shark games going that it was great to see him break out of his stupor and smile.  He's such a cute kid.... I really hope that the future holds great things for him.

      I've been awake on and off all night since I began to attempt sleeping.  I guess I have so many people lying to me right now telling me one thing or another that I'm just getting fed up with everything.  And I guess my body is trying to tell me by not letting me sleep.  I detest people who lie and so many have lied to me that I am starting to have little faith in humanity.  My mom asked me today if I could trust a certain someone, I told her that I think I could trust this person completely, that they would never back stab me... but now I'm beginning to doubt.

      So I've just finished watching Angel...  I must say that I am hooked again.  Anyway, I was surfing CNN before I turn into bed and I find an article about the new season of Angel!   urlLink    It's a good overview of the reasoning behind the changes in the show.  I must say that so far I like the changes and the direction they are going in.  I only hope that they will keep it up.  I still wish that they didn't cancel Buffy!  Oh well.  Still disliking my coworkers.  Nathan you are an amazing boyfriend and I thank you for your support.  I miss crunching leaves underfoot .... when is fall going to get here?  Have I mentioned that I have 25 sick days?  I've decided to take Halloween off from work to prepare for camping and fun with Nathan...hehe.  Anyway, I'm off to bed, time to catch up on that needed sleep.

      Well I have determined that I hate several of my coworkers!  Actually I can't stand the ones that I work with in the classroom!  I had a blow up conversation this afternoon with one of the aides.   I can't believe the nerve of some people.  ugh.. But I've found some awesome people at work to chat with and that understand what I'm going through and for them I am thankful.  Great news is that I calculated my sick hours into days and I have 25 sick days at work!!!!  25 days, that's unbelievable... I guess that I haven't taken all my sick days over the past 2 years and they have added up! Yippeeeee!!!! So guess whose taking lots of time off! hehehe. That's so cool!  So yeah! Yippeeeee... Did I mention YIPPPEEE!  Oh I went rollerblading with Becca today, her skates sucked!  The wheels barely even moved and so she couldn't skate much.  It was kinda funny watching her.  It was kinda fun.. But I've gotta find a good and big place to skate at. .... ugh the dilema... oh well.  So anyway, I'm not in as much of a funk.. I've actually had some reallly heart to heart conversations with some people and well it's been helping.... I've come to understand alot more about myself and them.   I've had some closures... I'm glad I can understand the other perspective of things.  I must say that AIM is a good thing today.

      Ever had one of those days where your heart just sinks and you feel like crying, but you're not sure why?  Ever miss a lost friendship and got it back?  Ever wonder what the hell you're doing and where you began to fuck it up?  Ever wonder if you're going to make it through another day?  Yeah, I'm back in my funk.  I hate teachers that waste your time and don't teach you a gosh damn thing!

      What a week.  My coworkers are unbelievable. ugh.  Oh well, I really don't feel like ranting about them right now... I'm in too good a mood.  Right now I'm at Nathan's, yippee.  Tomorrow afternoon we are taking off to Joshua Tree to camp for the weekend.  It's going to be super cold, but I think we'll have a really good time!  It's definitely going to be a good release from the crap I have had to put up with at work.

      I had an awesome weekend... My crap filled week ended on such a high note.  Friday night I rearranged my furniture in my room, well that continued on during Saturday and I did alot of cleaning and moving.  It took most of the day and luckily I was finished and out of the shower before Brian got here.  We headed out to City Walk and had a couple drinks, a big platter of food and the pig sandwich.  It was a blast talking with him and hanging out.  We even got to keep the glasses from our largest drinks, good stuff, good stuff.  After that we walked around, I was amazed at the large quantity of people there were there, then I felt old when I looked around and noticed that most of them were younger than I.  So we headed into Howl at the Moon, this really fun piano bar.  The pianist there were hilarious, but I'm still upset that they didn't play my song!  Oh well, at least he smelled my hair as I dropped off my request, ROFL.  We had a few more drinks while we were there, sat next to the "Ellis Reserved" tables, hmph, and the bitchy drunk chick.  I had a great time shootin' the shit with Brian.  Our few hour adventure turned into several hours and we made it home just fine (thanks Brian!).  As we pulled up and I began to walk into the house I noticed Nathan was coming across the grass, apparently he had arrived here a bit before us, although he will not admit how long before us.  We came into the house and had a wonderful evening together,  falling asleep in his arms was a great way to end the day.  We awoke early on Sunday (thanks to the time change) and went to brunch at El Torito with my parents.  We noticed the discount tequila night and made a comment that we should come back.  The food was very filling and the company was nice.  After we came back to the house and prepared for our camping trip this upcoming weekend.  We picked a tent, set it up, cleaned the water jug, and got everything we needed ready.  Afterwards we came in and prepared my stuff for the JA photos.  We headed out to Azuza Canyons, I hadn't been there since I was a kid.  The sky there was beautiful and clear, none of this ash and smoke from the fires.  We spent an hour taking photos and playing in the Jeep.  Nathan is going to submit the photos to JA sometime within the week.  Afterwards we headed back to the house and had dinner with my parents, watched a bit of Matchstick Men, became distracted and then Nathan had to leave to make it to his meeting on time.  It was a wonderful weekend and I had a great time with a good friend and the love of my life.  I am very much looking forward to this upcoming weekend.  I haven't been camping in ages!

      I realize that I haven't really blogged much in quite some time and I now have so many things to share.  Oh the dilema of what to talk about first!  Well I guess I will just keep typing until my fingers fall off.  LOL  So today I went to my old high school, Saint Joseph High.  Why you might be asking?  Well stupid DH made me take the CSET today, which I was totally unprepared for (later story).  I realized as I parked my car across the street from the school and looked at it, that I hadn't been back in SJ in 8 years.  Yes, I've been there for the carnivals every now and again, but that is different, it's late at night and there is tons of rides and games, so the school has a completely different feel to it.  Today I set foot on the campus at the time I used to 7:15am.  As I crossed the street I noticed that the parking lot set up was completely different and appeared to hold less cars than before.  As you enter one of the side gates there is a rather large statue of Mary (I think) I didn't get a close look.  Sister Marianne was taking soda cans and water bottles out of the trash cans, just like she did when I went to school there.  In the middle of chapel court is a huge water fountain and the campus looks so different.  The old ASB office is now a bookstore, the lockers where I almost beat the crap out of someone my freshman year are still there, one even had decorations for one of the girls birthdays.  The test was in a History classroom that used to be used for Freshman classes, now it's a juniors classroom.  The theme of the lessons for that class were "Fabulous Females of History."  Great stuff, I'm wishing that my history class would have taught us something about the women of history.  As I walked through the hall I felt at home, I realized that SJ, despite how much I didn't fit in, was one of the best experiences of my life.  I had some great friends, wonderful classes and teachers, and I discovered who I really am there.  It amazes me how much my little high school has changed and grown, and it seems like it will continue to grow.  The Flynn center is amazing and full of such wonderful advancements, I only see the school going up from here.  I have thus made a new goal for my self... as soon as I obtain my master degree in English and my single subject in English I am going to go back to my alma mater and teach!  It was a wonderful place for me and it really instilled in me the desire to educate others, thus I want to give something, other than money, back to it! hmmm maybe I should apply at my old elementary school too! hehe  Tonight was our Annual Charity Car Show for the Women's Shelter of Long Beach.  We had a good turn out, although not as big as previously, and gave away lots of great stuff.  We were able to provide a truck full of toys, Mary Kay products, almost $400, and tons of cheer to the WSoLB.  I'm so thankful that our family puts this on.  My mother was a victim of domestic violence for many many years and is a survivor and I think that women that are out there being beat by their parents or significant others or both should have a place to turn to inorder to get their lives going on a different path.  I hope that next years show will provide more to the women and hopefully we've helped at least a few families.  Well I have begun to golf again!  I went to the Lakes again on Thursday with Judy, Laura Jo and Kathy.  I must say that I'm doing pretty dang well for being off the courses for so long!  My first time out I had 56 with a 5 on the last hole, I never got under a 7 on that hole before!!  My second time out I did fairly well too!  I had a 53 and a 5 on the last hole!  It's amazing.  The ladies are so fun to golf with too!  It's strange to be playing with women rather than men!   I do miss the antics of Roland, Ryan, Mel and Jeff!  They were always too funny!  So anyway, I am excited to be golfing again!  Oh LJ has this awesom club called the "King Cobra," it's her wood and man is that thing awesome, she let me use it and I have never hit a ball as far as I did with that one!  So if anyone is looking for a gift to get me for christmas or my birthday I'd love to get one!!!  hehe  Oh, I am so loving how it feels like the holidays to me!!!  I haven't felt this warm and gooshie inside at night for a while!  I definitely am filled with the holiday cheer.  Yeehaw!  I think I may even go take pictures with Santa at the mall! hehe  Tomorrow is Bill and Sue's going away party.  I'm so bummed they are taking Abby to Utah with them.   :-(   Apparently, from what my dad says Bill really likes me!  Who would have thunk it!  I know I never would have, but I guess my love off Jeeping has really made him like me.  So today at the show I was talking to Bill.  He said that he and Sue have made a room for me at their house in Utah and that I am welcome to come out and see them whenever I like!  Bill even said he's going to get another Jeep to ride the trails with near their home!  I'm going to pass the Jeepaholics information on to him so he'll be able to meet some more people in his area to go on rides with!  He's even told me to bring Nathan and the Jeep along to try out the trails around him, he said there are a ton and that they are beautiful.  I can't wait to go!  If you would have asked me a year ago if I thought Bill liked me I would have said you were on crack! LOL.... So now I am thinking ... I'll borrow my parents trailer, put Nathan's Jeep on it (if he lets me)  and take Nathan and the Jeep out to Bill and Sues over the Christmas holiday.... Jeeping for the holidays that would be cool... hmm gotta talk to Nathan about this!  Wow that would be cool!  And then I'll get to see Abby again too! hehe

      Parents absolutely infuriate me!  So I was at the Mobil tonight getting gas and I look over, this guy in a BRAND NEW BMW lets his little girl, who was probably no older than 10, out of the car at the Mobil and drives off!  The girl looks back at the car and then takes off at a run.  She was headed to the dance studio that is two buildings over from the Mobil, past dark corners and an auto shop.  The father didn't even look back to make sure the girl was ok.  And the kicker is that the drive way into the dance studio wasn't that far away and has a turn around.  I swear, what kinda father is that, in this fucking city his daughter could have been picked up by some stranger!  See this is why I say PARENT LICENSING!  So that is my rant!

      When it rains it pours!!!  Thursday I headed out to Nathan's and had a nice relaxing evening. Friday I woke up early and headed to UCR with Nathan, he had work and class so I decided to use the time wisely!  I headed to the science library and set up shop on the third floor, I spent 4 hours working on my lesson plans and redoing the whole thing.  Nathan picked me up and we had cheep sandwiches at the shop I went to all the time back in my UCR days, then it was off to Nathan's to load up for camping.  We packed all the gear after a few delays we were finally on the road.... boy oh boy was it cold... so we chose a really cold weekend to head out to Joshua Tree.  We made it to the park and once inside, since it was so dark, we got lost.  Well finally at 10pm camp was set up and we were ready to retire for the evening.  We had wonderful cuddle time and I listened to the sounds of the rain as it pitter pattered on the roof of the tent.  I had tummy troubles most of the night and was up before the sun rose.. I actually watched the sun rise over the desert!  It was awesome, yes Nathan slept through it, punk!  Anyway, I was up for several hours before Nathan finally emerged.  We took a nice brisk hike, saw a skull in the rock, then headed back for some offroading... well that was  fiasco and Nathan has written two nice write ups on JA and his blog so I'll spare everyone the details.  Although, I'm very glad that the windshield didn't shatter in on us, that the radiator was fixable and that we made it home safely on Saturday night, yeah we had to leave early on Saturday due to the accident!  But the short trip was relaxing and fun and definitely well deserved.  I had a wonderful time hanging out with my man, if only I had more money and time to do so!  So Sunday we arose to price windshields, fix the radio fuses, pound out the dents in the hood and finish our homework.  I finally arrived home around 9:10 last night and my back was killing me.  I woke up at 2:22 this morning and lay in pain for an hour, tonight I stole the heating pad and boy does my back feel better!  I am going to see the doc tomorrow about all that has been ailing me over the past 4 days, does it ever end?!  Anyway, I had an eventful and enjoyable weekend with my man.  The next couple of weeks are going to be busy and stressful for both he and I, but I know we'll make it through it as long as we have each other!

      Today was such a laid back and relaxing day.  Nathan came out to visit and we took off to the aquarium.  It was so nice... I think I may go back tomorrow to watch the seals some more... they need to put a bench in the center so you can watch them as they swim... But anyway... I had a great day... I wish that he and I could have more days during the week like today... So I am bound and determined to get into the IE... I just wish it would happen sooner than it is.  I miss it and him oh so much. Ugh... Well I'm outtie... PTHT

      Today was soooo nice.  I spent a wonderfully relaxing day with Nathan... We had a yummy lunch at Alcapulco, picked up parts for the Jeep, fixed the Jeep, had a yummy dinner, spent some great quality time together.  So yeah it was an awesome day.  I love spending time with him, no matter what we do it's a blast!  When I arrived home this evening I found that my parents were done with the Christmas decor!  They decorated the den and the living room already with the christmas tree and with the moving peoples.  I can't believe that they decorated two weeks early, especially after my dad's speech last year that he was no longer going to decorate. ROFL... They are to wacko.  So anyway, the house looks all christmasy and it's kinda nice.  I love the holidays. hehe.

      Yesterday was a pretty good day.  At 10 I went to DH and met Alison and Anthony to work on our Science Methods lesson plans.  We accomplished alot and only have a little left to add and some refining to do.  We spent 4 hours working on the plans and Anthony was nice enough to buy us lunch at the Cafeteria.  So at around 2:30pm I was finally headed home.  I had a very nice phone conversation with Nathan since he was stuck at home.  When I finally arrived home I began making calls to see who might be going to Howl at the Moon this Friday night.  So far I've gotten a few positive responses and sadly a couple people that I would love to have there will be out of town or working, so they won't be able to show.  I'm hoping that those who can go do, since it is a load of fun!  Anyway, so after making those calls and with Nathan finally off to his retreat, I made myself some dinner and vegged in front of the tv.  My mom arrived at around 6:30 and we began to make peanut butter balls for Thanksgivings trip to Nathan's.  I was done by 7:30 and was able to call Alison about the Dungeon.  Since we had talked about it earlier in the day she was interested in going and had a friend that wanted to go to.  So I got changed, picked them up at 9:30 and we headed to Dungeon.  We luckily got in for 5 bucks and as usual it was not so crowded in the beginning.  The ladies took a look around and Chris realized that she didn't really fit in, she looked like she walked right out of a BR bromag. hehe.  So we took in the first show which was an unattractive man being dom-d by a woman.  Alison headed out to the dance floor and I looked around for some people I know.  We headed back to the table to see what Chris was up to and she was watching a girl on the horse get whipped.  The dance floor became full so we decided to hang out there and I got about an hour and some worth of dancing in.  It was great to be dancing again... I have definitely missed dancing every weekend.  (Babe lets go dancing more, hint hint)  At around 1:30 the ladies finally had their fill and so we headed back to Alisons.  The ladies said they had a good time, but they would probably never come back. I told them it was awesome that they went, everyone should go at least once since it is such an interesting experience!  So I am glad they had fun and were able to keep an openmind.  I finally arrived home and dived into bed at about 2:10am.  Once my head hit the pillow I slept like a baby and had an awesome sleep, although I wish a certain someone were there next to me.  Anyway, I'm now up and ready to go visit Nathan once he gets home.  It's been a good weekend thus far and I can't wait to make it a better weekend by rushing into his arms.  Hope your weekend was awesome.

      Well Thanksgiving is almost here and after 10 months of dating Nathan's and my parents are finally going to meet.  This is going to be an interesting Thanksgiving.  I think Nathan is more worried about it than I am.  I'm sure they'll find things to talk about...if not I'm bringing lots of dessert! LOL.

      Introverted 67%, Intuitive 67%, Feeling 22%, Judging 22% You are:  distinctively expressed introvert,  distinctively expressed intuitive personality,  slightly expressed feeling personality, slightly expressed judging personality  Portrait of the Counselor (iNFj)  The Counselor Idealists are abstract thought and speech, cooperative in reaching their goals, and directive and introverted in their interpersonal roles. Counselors focus on human potentials, think in terms of ethical values, and come easily to decisions. The small number of this type (little more than 2 percent) is regrettable, since Counselors have an unusually strong desire to contribute to the welfare of others and genuinely enjoy helping their companions. Although Counsleors tend to be private, sensitive people, and are not generally visible leaders, they nevertheless work quite intensely with those close to them, quietly exerting their influence behind the scenes with their families, friends, and colleagues. This type has great depth of personality; they are themselves complicated, and can understand and deal with complex issues and people.   Counselors can be hard to get to know. They have an unusually rich inner life, but they are reserved and tend not to share their reactions except with those they trust. With their loved ones, certainly, Counselors are not reluctant to express their feelings, their face lighting up with the positive emotions, but darkening like a thunderhead with the negative. Indeed, because of their strong ability to take into themselves the feelings of others, Counselors can be hurt rather easily by those around them, which, perhaps, is one reason why they tend to be private people, mutely withdrawing from human contact. At the same time, friends who have known an Counselor for years may find sides emerging which come as a surprise. Not that they are inconsistent; Counselors value their integrity a great deal, but they have intricately woven, mysterious personalities which sometimes puzzle even them.   Counselors have strong empathic abilities and can become aware of another's emotions or intentions -- good or evil -- even before that person is conscious of them. This "mind-reading" can take the form of feeling the hidden distress or illnesses of others to an extent which is difficult for other types to comprehend. Even Counselors can seldom tell how they came to penetrate others' feelings so keenly. Furthermore, the Counselor is most likely of all the types to demonstrate an ability to understand psychic phenomena and to have visions of human events, past, present, or future. What is known as ESP may well be exceptional intuitive ability-in both its forms, projection and introjection. Such supernormal intuition is found frequently in the Counselor, and can extend to people, things, and often events, taking the form of visions, episodes of foreknowledge, premonitions, auditory and visual images of things to come, as well as uncanny communications with certain individuals at a distance.  Jane Goodall, Sidney Poitier, Emily Bronte, Carl Jung, Mary Baker Eddy, Mohandas Gandhi  and Eleanor Roosevelt are examples of the Counselor Idealist (INFJ).   Beneath the quiet exterior, INFJs hold deep convictions about the weightier matters of life. Those who are activists -- INFJs gravitate toward such a role -- are there for the cause, not for personal glory or political power.  INFJs are champions of the oppressed and downtrodden. They often are found in the wake of an emergency, rescuing those who are in acute distress. INFJs may fantasize about getting revenge on those who victimize the defenseless. The concept of 'poetic j ustice' is appealing to the INFJ.   "There's something rotten in Denmark." Accurately suspicious about others' motives, INFJs are not easily led. These are the people that you can rarely fool any of the time. Though affable and sympathetic to most, INFJs are selective about their friends . Such a friendship is a symbiotic bond that transcends mere words.   INFJs have a knack for fluency in language and facility in communication. In addition, nonverbal sensitivity enables the INFJ to know and be known by others intimately.   Writing, counseling, public service and even politics are areas where INFJs frequently find their niche.    Functional Analysis    Introverted iNtuition Introverted intuitives, INFJs enjoy a greater clarity of perception of inner, unconscious processes than all but their INTJ cousins. Just as SP types commune with the object and "live in the here and now" of the physical world, INFJs readily grasp the hidden psychological stimuli behind the more observable dynamics of behavior and affect. Their amazing ability to deduce the inner workings of the mind, will and emotions of others gives INFJs their reputation as prophets and seers. Unlike the confining, routinizing nature of introverted sensing, introverted intuition frees this type to act insightfully and spontaneously as unique solutions arise on an event by event basis.   Extraverted Feeling Extraverted feeling, the auxiliary deciding function, expresses a range of emotion and opinions of, for and about people. INFJs, like many other FJ types, find themselves caught between the desire to express their wealth of feelings and moral conclusions about the actions and attitudes of others, and the awareness of the consequences of unbridled candor. Some vent the attending emotions in private, to trusted allies. Such confidants are chosen with care, for INFJs are well aware of the treachery that can reside in the hearts of mortals. This particular combination of introverted intuition and extraverted feeling provides INFJs with the raw material from which perceptive counselors are shaped.   Introverted Thinking The INFJ's thinking is introverted, turned toward the subject. Perhaps it is when the INFJ's thinking function is operative that he is most aloof. A comrade might surmise that such detachment signals a disillusionment, that she has also been found lacking by the sardonic eye of this one who plumbs the depths of the human spirit. Experience suggests that such distancing is merely an indication that the seer is hard at work and focusing energy into this less efficient tertiary function.   Extraverted Sensing INFJs are twice blessed with clarity of vision, both internal and external. Just as they possess inner vision which is drawn to the forms of the unconscious, they also have external sensing perception which readily takes hold of worldly objects. Sensing, however, is the weakest of the INFJ's arsenal and the most vulnerable. INFJs, like their fellow intuitives, may be so absorbed in intuitive perceiving that they become oblivious to physical reality. The INFJ under stress may fall prey to various forms of immediate gratification. Awareness of extraverted sensing is probably the source of the "SP wannabe" side of INFJs. Many yearn to live spontaneously; it's not uncommon for INFJ actors to take on an SP (often ESTP) role. > Famous INFJs:  Nathan, prophet of Israel Aristophanes Chaucer Goethe Robert Burns, Scottish poet U.S. Presidents:   Martin Van Buren James Earl "Jimmy" Carter  Nathaniel Hawthorne, author, poet Fanny Crosby, (blind) hymnist Mother Teresa of Calcutta Fred McMurray (My Three Sons, various movies) Shirley Temple Black, child actor, ambassador Martin Luther King, Jr., civil rights leader, martyr James Reston, newspaper reporter Shirley McClain, actor (Sweet Charity, ...) Piers Anthony, author ("Xanth" series) Michael Landon, actor (Highway to Heaven, Little House on the Prairie) Tom Selleck, actor (Magnum, P. I., Mr. Baseball) Oprah Winfrey, talk show host John Katz, critic, author Paul Stookey, folk singer (Peter, Paul and Mary) Angela Lansbury, actor (Murder, She Wrote) U. S. Senator Carol Moseley-Braun (D-IL) Richard Gere, actor (Pretty Woman, Sommersby) Billy Crystal, actor, comedian Carrie Fisher, actor (Star Wars)  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Introverted iNtuiting Feeling Judging  by Marina Margaret Heiss  INFJs are distinguished by both their complexity of character and the unusual range and depth of their talents. Strongly humanitarian in outlook, INFJs tend to be idealists, and because of their J preference for closure and completion, they are generally "doers" as well as dreamers. This rare combination of vision and practicality often results in INFJs taking a disproportionate amount of responsibility in the various causes to which so many of them seem to be drawn.   INFJs are deeply concerned about their relations with individuals as well as the state of humanity at large. They are, in fact, sometimes mistaken for extroverts because they appear so outgoing and are so genuinely interested in people -- a product of the Feeling function they most readily show to the world. On the contrary, INFJs are true introverts, who can only be emotionally intimate and fulfilled with a chosen few from among their long-term friends, family, or obvious "soul mates." While instinctively courting the personal and organizational demands continually made upon them by others, at intervals INFJs will suddenly withdraw into themselves, sometimes shutting out even their intimates. This apparent paradox is a necessary escape valve for them, providing both time to rebuild their depleted resources and a filter to prevent the emotional overload to which they are so susceptible as inherent "givers." As a pattern of behavior, it is perhaps the most confusing aspect of the enigmatic INFJ character to outsiders, and hence the most often misunderstood -- particularly by those who have little experience with this rare type.   Due in part to the unique perspective produced by this alternation between detachment and involvement in the lives of the people around them, INFJs may well have the clearest insights of all the types into the motivations of others, for good and for evil. The most important contributing factor to this uncanny gift, however, are the empathic abilities often found in Fs, which seem to be especially heightened in the INFJ type (possibly by the dominance of the introverted N function).   This empathy can serve as a classic example of the two-edged nature of certain INFJ talents, as it can be strong enough to cause discomfort or pain in negative or stressful situations. More explicit inner conflicts are also not uncommon in INFJs; it is possible to speculate that the causes for some of these may lie in the specific combinations of preferences which define this complex type. For instance, there can sometimes be a "tug-of-war" between NF vision and idealism and the J practicality that urges compromise for the sake of achieving the highest priority goals. And the I and J combination, while perhaps enhancing self-awareness, may make it difficult for INFJs to articulate their deepest and most convoluted feelings.   Usually self-expression comes more easily to INFJs on paper, as they tend to have strong writing skills. Since in addition they often possess a strong personal charisma, INFJs are generally well-suited to the "inspirational" professions such as teaching (especially in higher education) and religious leadership. Psychology and counseling are other obvious choices, but overall, INFJs can be exceptionally difficult to pigeonhole by their career paths. Perhaps the best example of this occurs in the technical fields. Many INFJs perceive themselves at a disadvantage when dealing with the mystique and formality of "hard logic", and in academic terms this may cause a tendency to gravitate towards the liberal arts rather than the sciences. However, the significant minority of INFJs who do pursue studies and careers in the latter areas tend to be as successful as their T counterparts, as it is *iNtuition* -- the dominant function for the INFJ type -- which governs the ability to understand abstract theory and implement it creatively.   In their own way, INFJs are just as much "systems builders" as are INTJs; the difference lies in that most INFJ "systems" are founded on human beings and human values, rather than information and technology. Their systems may for these reasons be conceptually "blurrier" than analogous NT ones, harder to measure in strict numerical terms, and easier to take for granted -- yet it is these same underlying reasons which make the resulting contributions to society so vital and profound.

      There was a great post on JA today that I read (thanks babe for pointing it out!)  Anyway, one of the JAer's posted this topic about people being too touchy!  I so wholeheartedly agree with what he was saying.   Here is the link.. http://www.jeepaholics.com/citizensband/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=23283  Anyway, in my opinion people, some of my friends included, are way too touchy.  They get offended at the slightest comments.  I grew up around construction workers, these guys know how to tell a joke, cuss you out and call you names.  But they also know how to respect each other and how to look out for one another.  It takes a whole hell of a lot to offend me.  People need to lighten up, to take a joke and to understand that society is not going to get any better with us dancing around and trying to not offend everyone.  Hell people grow some balls, suck it up and laugh at what is being said, shit even call the person a name back and see how they respond.  So yeah, I think society needs to lighten up quite a bit!  Just because you're a FOB, Gay, Straight, Bi, Hispanic, American, etc so on and so forth doesn't mean that people should tred lightly around you... get over it!  Hell if every blonde comment I heard in my life upset me I would be a basket case, but it doesn't I realize that hell they are funny and you know what that's life.   So on that note... *singing* "You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille, You bitch, You slut, You whore." and "It's hard to say I love you when you're sitting on my face."  God I love those songs! hehe

      Well this weekend was a blast!  Friday I left work early and stopped by the Garden Patch to pick up veggies. Then I headed home to do a little light cleaning in my room and begin a yummy dinner for Nathan.  Nathan arrived around 5 and we had dinner around 6pm, I made my famous chicken and veggies.  After dinner we got cleaned up and headed to Universal Citywalk.  Traffic sucked on the way out there, but we made it in time to get fifty cent drinks.  While we were waiting in line we ran into Will and the three of us ventured inside.  (Side note, on the way to Howl Nathan and I ran into Judy from NWM, oh my goodness, she's still there, what a crack up!)  Once inside we noticed that the place was packed, there was a grand variety of people and the guys on stage were in full swing.  It wasn't long before Joy, Chris and Sylvia showed up.  Joy seemed to enjoy it rather much, hehe.  Darren showed up not to long after and so did his sis and coworkers and friends.  Nathan and I had a screwdriver and a cranberry and vodka... they are definitely not as good as their 7 deadly sins!  Those are the best!  Anyway, it was a blast, they sang many of my favorite parody songs!  Around 10 Ali and her friend Kris showed up, they had a blast and appeared to like Howl a bit more then Dungeon.  Darren had met Ali earlier in the week and he was the first to spot her.  Anyway, we all sang, groved and enjoyed ourselves!  I am glad that those who could make it showed up!  Nathan and I arrived home around 1pm and after chatting about the evening we finally hit the bed around 3.  Saturday was rather nice and relaxing.  I surprised Nathan by taking him out to lunch at Kings Hawaiian in Torrance.  We had yummy and filling food and excelent deserts!  I think I am going to take their cakes to Nathan's for Thanksgiving an then to Jacki and Juds!  Yummy yummy stuff.  After lunch we ventured to Michaels for supplies for the calendar I am making.  It's gonna be so cool!  The time was approaching 4 so we headed home to figure out how to spend the rest of our evening.  We played around on my computer, I showed Nathan my journal and pictures from Hungary, he got a real kick out of it.... Justin's address was in the papers and then began the search to find out if Nathan knows him, 'cuz he thinks he does... ugh.  Anyway, we had a moving conversation, spent some great quality time together and fell asleep in each others arms at around 2 because we were so exhausted.  Today we awoke around 11 and had yummy pancakes, then we cleaned the Jeep and Honda, both were super messy.  After cleaning ourselves up we ventured out for lunch at Jack in the box... then it was leisure time together.  We took a well needed nap and relaxed and chatted, which was rather nice.  Subway made a very yummy dinner and a little after 7:30 Nathan took off to his meeting.  In all it was a wonderful weekend!  I must say that the time I spend with Nathan is definitely high quality.... Thanks babe.

      So being sick sucks.  I have spent the last three days in bed. Ugh.... Yesterday it felt like my nose had been hit several times with a baseball bat.  Very very annoying.  My body is exhausted!  I am so glad that I didn't go into work, because I just don't think I would get any better if I did.  I have a doctors appointment tomorrow morning, I'm gonna see if he'll give me a clean bill of health or if he'll say that I'm still sick.  I guess I just have to wait and see.  I just want to be healthy again.  I have so many little projects to complete but currently have no energy to do them... ugh.

      Well I am home from work today!  LOL and not for a fun reason either.  Apparently my doctor has diagnosed me with a Sinal bronchidial Infection (I know I must have spelled some part of that wrong).  Anyway, I had a bronchitis infection that infected my sinuses and now both are out of wack and pretty dang bad.  He has told me to take the rest of the week off of work and to rest.  Then if I'm not better by Friday I have to go back to his office and have xrays taken of my nose and chest.  He said it could be worse then this infection and we have to wait and see what the medicine does.  Oh boy oh boy.  I'm so looking forward to it.  So anyway, this being sick sucks.  Seems like since I had that ear infection at the beginning of the year my health has just gone down hill from there.  Somebody want to give me a healthy immune system?? haha.

      WOOOOOO HOOOOOOOO!!!! So much has happened lately!  Life has been awesome!  Saturday I awoke feeling so much better.  I worked all day on my lesson plans and accomplished one goal.  Then Sunday I went out to Nathan's to take care of him.  He helped me edit my plans and I finished the last of them.  I came home early and printed all the plans out and was done well before midnight!  So goals 1 and 2 for the weekend were taken care of.  On Saturday I also went to Cinguar and got a new phone!  It's so cool!  It's not the newest but it's what I need and want.  So goal 3 was accomplished.  So Monday was great... I turned in my lesson plans for Social Studies and Science.  Both went really well!  I'm thinking that I'll get an A in both classes.  At 10pm I checked my CSET scores, I was so worried that I failed the Science/Math section.... But I PASSED ALL THREE SECTIONS!!! WOO HOOO!!! So this now means that I will be in Student Teaching in January and will be able to complete my credential by the end of summer.  I am so excited... this is so awesome!  And I have a parttime job offer from Cheryl which rocks and I'll be making 5 or more dollars an hour than I do now.  Things are going so great this is awesome.  I'm so happy.  Before I know it I'll be out in the IE like I originally planned!!! Woo Hoo!

      Little kids totally rock!  This evening Mike and Cathy brought over Chance while Jeremy and Jennifer brought over Wylie. (Yes I know my friends have kids with odd names.)  Anyway, they are the most adorable kids ever!  Chance was playing with my mom's slot machine, I believe he is addicted and needs to seek professional help! Seriously!  While Wylie is just an adorable little thing.  She got this really cool McFlurry machine from my parents and I.  She and I wanted to make the treats while all the "adults" said no!  So instead I spent a half-hour putting the dang thing together, and I must add that it was no easy feat!  Wylie was so cute, the whole time I was trying to put the thing together she was egging me on to hurry while trying to get one of the adults in the room to bring her milk so she could make a McFlurry.  Then it was time to do summersaults!  She and Chance were rolling around all over the floor!  It was so cute.  I wish Nathan could have been here to see them, he would have definitely got a kick out of them! hehe.  So that is just a small part of what I love about this holiday season!  The kids are adorable and great and can't wait to see what santa brought them.  Gotta love it.  Anyway, My parents and I opened our gifts tonight as is our tradition.  There is still no way in hell I am letting my mom wake me up at 4am to open gifts! LOL.  So I got some really cool things... but I'm not going to say what they are until tomorrow. hehe.  Although one of the gifts I'm going to take to Utah with Nathan and I this weekend.  hehe.    Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night.

      What a busy couple of days I have had.  Yesterday I headed to Will's and we had a yummy lunch then it was off to finish our holiday shopping.  I was finally done with shopping, but I spent way more then I should have! lol.  I ended up at Nathan's house a whole 40 minutes early (he lives much closer to the mall then I guesstamated).  I had a nice conversation with his parents then stole him away to Will's family Christmas dinner.  (Thanks Will)  Anyway... I had a wonderful evening with some good friends and even made a new one.   Dinner was very yummy... In a nutshell.... Ham and cheese from package alone not good, but together good; stuffed olives are gross; smoked turkey is not as yummy as smoked ham; yams are a squash; it's amazing how quickly a dinner table can be cleaned when alcohol and chocolate are going to be purchased; hell may be freezing over soon; and it is wonderful to spend the holidays with good friends and good food. Yesterday was so exhausting that I crashed at Nathan's place, luckily I took my contact case with me!  I awoke at the butt crack of dawn this morning to come home and work all day!  The house is clean, every gift is wrapped and sorted, my room however looks like a hurricane hit it.  I have so much to do between now and tomorrow morning... ugh.  But I'm looking forward to it.  Lates!

I think that I am finally over this sinus/bronchitis infection, but man was that hell.  I have been running around trying to get ready for the holidays, still so much left to do.  Anyway, I just spent the last four days running around with Nathan, we got so much accomplished and now I am exhausted.  I think I am going to call it  a night.

      I had a wonderful holiday season this year!  I did so many things with Nathan it was great.  So what all happened you ask:  1.  My first Hanukkah shindigs 2.  Christmas dinner at Will's house 3.  Christmas dinner at my house 4.  Lord of the Rings 5.  Utah for 4 days 6.  New Year's Eve in Vegas 7.  Buying the wrong movie 8.  Lots and lots of wonderful time together!  So looking back I have had a wonderful two week vacation.  I don't want to go back to work but life is moving forward for me!  I hope 2004 is a better year for me then ones in the past.  I must say though that 2003 was an awesome year, I made a couple good friends and met the love of my life... ahh happiness is great.  Oh I'm still a little sick, which totally sucks, but oh well.

      Why is it that propells us to lose contact with our closest friends when we obtain a significant other.  I admit that in the past I let many good friendships sail away, but I have been trying my hardest to maintain my current friendships while enjoying my wonderful relationship.  Yes I am thinking of someone in particular.... so why is it that after all the bonding one does with another that a penis or vagina can change things?  This I do not understand.  What is it that causes best friends to not return phone calls and text messages.  Oh I have my theories, one is that that person doesn't want to hear I told you so when the relationship starts to turn bad.  Oh well.  I guess everyone must learn from their mistakes or be unhappy for the rest of their lives!  Good thing I learned from my mistake and am a happily taken woman.

Did he not think that he would cause a stir or was he trying to and it just took some time?  Why do big businesses take some things so seriously, especially when it isn't hurting their business?  Really!  I think this world is just coming to an utterly horrible state of control freaks! Doh

      Well no more Tulita! Yippee!  I am so excited that I will be moving on in my career!  With this change comes many other changes.  And thus after looking at this blog I have decided to change it.  I've noticed that I don't really write about my day to day life on it that much any more.  I've just run out of time.   So, I'm going to dedicate this blog to the following topics: 1)  Politics 2)  Favorites - Authors, Movies, Foods etc 3)  Anything I can think of 4)  Rants 5)  Praise  6)  Etc  So it will not be updated that frequently, but it will be updated.  Sorry for those that wish to read about my daily life, I just don't have time to write... so drop me a line and we'll chat instead. ;-)

      I hate people that are so friggen fake. I hate people that use you and then dump your friendship the first chance they get. I hate people that are rude and cut in line. I hate people that treat others like crap. I hate people that treat their kids like shit. I hate the school system in which I work because it is run by politicians that know nothing about teaching.  I love the cold crisp air in the mornings as I take a walk from here to there. I love the bright blue color of the sky. I love the crow that sits on the telephone line and watches me as I work. I love the sound of my boyfriends voice over the telephone. I love the warmth of his arms as he holds me tight. I love the thrill of offroading up the side of a mountain. I love the crisp green of a new lawn. I love the sounds of a childs laughter. I love to watch people as they think they are not being watched. I love life and all it has to offer.  Live life and be happy.

      So I'm in Target today buying supplies for my student teaching position that starts next week.  As I walk past the Valentine's cards I notice a mother and daughter.  They are apparently having a discussion about something.  And as I walk past them the daughter, who I would say is no more than 15, stomps her foot rather loudly and says, "Why won't you let me buy it? I want to buy something for my sister because I love her!"  The mother proceeds in Spanglish to say, "I love my son, your brother too but I'm not going to go out of my way to buy silly cards."  I could not help but let out a little laugh.  Thank god for mothers who stand their ground, but I would never stomp my foot at my mother.  I could not believe what this girl was getting away with.  And as I continued to shop I found that everywhere I turned children were pushing their mothers around and getting what they wanted.  What has happened to the discipline factor?  Where has the morals and standards of our society gone to?  I know it is tough to be a parent, when you work in SE you tend to be a parent for 6 hours of the day, but come on people and show a little backbone.  No wonder our world is so messed up, kids push their parents around and have no boundries. Parent licensing people, it's all about parent licensing.

But you know what makes him the awesomest boyfriend ever?!  He bought me a Tiffany's bracelet that I have been drooling over for forever!!!  Isn't that the coolest thing ever!  He's so damn rad.  I just had to tell the world that my man is the bomb!!!!

      Go Clark Go!  In other news... I have begun my student teaching and so far so good.  The kids are great and I am looking forward to teaching them.  Life has been very very busy with the addition of student teaching, I am arriving home anywhere from 3:30 to 4:30 and some days not until 5 or 5:30!  But it is great.    The California education system needs a rehaul!  The open court system is not an effective learning tool for demographics other than upper class caucasian classrooms from the East coast!  The effect this is having on our children is astounding and should bring all able bodied citizens to fight for their children's educations.  It is absolutely ridiculous! Eh!   urlLink   After reading this I am just utterly, well UGH!  What gives the pharmacist the right to deny a patient their requested medication, especially if they have a prescription for it!  Just because it's for the morning after pill that doesn't give the pharmacist the right to not fill the prescription.  I can not stand it when people do crap like that!  If I want to put something into my body that my doctor gave me a prescription for then it is NO ONE's right to tell me I can't take it!  I'm sorry but if a woman chooses to protect herself or prevent pregnancy then it is her choice and she should be allowed to do so!  NO ONE has the right to tell another human how to live their life.  So in conclusion all you right to lifers out ther can kiss my big toe! PTHT

I'm so glad to see that at least one state is telling Bush to stick it.  So this leads me to say that UNLESS YOU ARE AN EDUCATOR (not an administrator) YOU SHOULD NOT BE TELLING THE EDUCATORS WHAT TO  DO!!!  Educators should be left to decided what is best for their students and their schools!  Who knows, better than they do, what they and the school can accomplish!  Politicians and non-educators should not have any say in what happens!  They should impliment what the teachers believe is best.  And that's what I have to say about that! Humph!

      Well Clark has been out of the running for a bit.  I was rather disappointed to see his numbers decrease and then to hear that he had dropped out of the race.  There is not one candidate that I feel like supporting in this race at all.  I think that Dean will screw us educators where the sun doesn't shine, I think that Kerry will not follow up on promises made to educators, and well as for the other nominees I don't think they are going to be around much longer.  So I'm not very happy about this election, I'm going to wait and see what else comes out before March 2nd in order to make my decision.

       urlLink    Well I am in mourning!  As they say "all good things must come to an end."  It has been wonderful watching first Buffy and then Angel.  The stories were both funny and serious from time to time and was a great escape from my hectic life.  To hear that now Angel is being canceled is saddening, but I can understand.  The WB wants trendy shows that will produce large sales in merchandise and corrupt teen life, I can understand that, that is business.   So I guess this means I must now purchase all the Buffy and Angel DVD's so I can relive those happy moments on my own.  Ah, farewell dear friend, you will be missed.... hmmmm maybe they'll do a spin off for Spike, now that would be cool!

      Ronnie, fellow cruiser, my father's best friend, self proclaimed sex symbol of Bellflower, a good man despite his flaws, has left this realm for the next.  Two hours after the love of his life died he was in the hospital himself.  Within 6 days his health had deteriorated, he had approximately 5 heart attacks and 2 strokes, phnemonia and an undiagnosed heart problem.  At around 3:20pm today right after a short prayer surrounded by family and friends he left us.  He will be deeply missed by many.  I have many fond memories and only wish he could have lived longer!  (Since he was my only living witness that my dad owed me over $30,000 for smoking! ROFL)  This Saturday we are hosting a Car Show/Memorial for Ronnie before his sister takes his body back home.  It will be from 10 to 2 at the Frisco Burger on Woodruff.  The 50/50 will be donated to an animal charity like the SPCA due to Ronnie's love of dogs. Rest well Ronnie, see you in the after life.

      It's been forever since I've written anything about my life, I completely understand that.  And it's not like anyone really reads this thing anyway... People have probably forgotten that it exists... but there are tons of changes going on in my life right now! Lets see... 1. Student teaching is over! Woo hoo! I only have one class left and I am completely done with my credential. 2. I'm buying a house with Nathan and will be moving in with him in the beginning of July.  I am so excited about this! It's going to be the greatest thing since sliced bread baby! hehe 3. I'm beginning my job hunt... ugh. 4. I just gave my resignation to Beth, a month and a half early.  Well I guess that isn't much but they are all big changes. Number 2 is the greatest, of course followed by number 1.   So that is the life of me.. You may now return to your regularly scheduled program!

      Well you might have guessed that I just got in from seeing "The day after tomorrow" with Nathan and his parents.  I must say it was an interesting movie.  I enjoyed watching LA get torn up by tornados!  LOL  Wonder if they hit NMSFG!  I could only hope.  Anyway, it was quite interesting with very good visual effects.  Definitely a good way to spend time if you don't have anything else planned.  Although I still want to go see Saved! LOL

      Well right now it is a very merky looking Friday. Ugh.  Of course it doesn't help that I woke up with a very bad backache, a swollen and aching nose, a draining and hurting ear and finally eyes that were beginning to swell.  The fun of allergies and overworking the body. Ugh.  So I must say that today was off to a very bad start.  Oh well at least I didn't have to work today, but I do have to work with Austin on Sunday, ugh.  I can't wait to get a nice paying job! LOL  Anyway, just thought I would bitch about my crappy day so far.  Hopefully the weekend will be better, but I doubt it, I don't think this pain is going to go away anytime soon. Did I mention? UGHHHHH

      Saudi jailed for battering wife Rania's injuries have caused global outcry (picture: Arab News)  A Saudi man who severely beat his TV presenter wife has been sentenced to six months in prison and 300 lashes, a Saudi newspaper reports. The judgement by a Jeddah court against Mohammed al-Fallatta came on Saturday, the Arab News said.   A lawyer for Rania al-Baz described it as relatively lenient.   Mrs al-Baz suffered 13 facial fractures and agreed to let papers print images of her injuries to raise awareness of a problem affecting the whole kingdom.   Her lawyer, Omar al-Khouli, said the sentence included time already spent in custody since al-Fallatta's surrender to the police on 19 April, leaving four-and-a-half months to complete.   Earlier, an attempted murder charge against al-Fallatta was dropped.   Seeking divorce   Mrs al-Baz accused her husband of first trying to strangle her until she became unconscious, and then smashing her face.   Doctors said she was lucky to survive her horrific injuries.   Mrs al-Baz, who is seeking divorce and custody of her two boys, said she did not want to comment on the sentence.   Her lawyer said a private claim would likely follow the public case.   Under Sharia law, if Mrs al-Baz insists on compensation for her suffering, her husband could either be ordered to pay damages or be given a beating of equal severity to the one he inflicted on his wife, the newspaper said.    ---------------------- I think they should beat the crap out of him!  Hell we should punish all abusers in such a manner! They deserve it!  I hope she wins!

      So I had an interview for Riverside Unified School District and an hour after they phoned and offered me a very nice job! Woo Hoo! I'm super duper excited and nervous all at the same time.  I'll be teaching 5th grade in a year round school so my school year starts on June 30th.  Not much of a summer for me but that's ok.  So can I just say *Bouncing* I GOT A JOB! Woo hoo.

      Well I will be moving out this Wednesday night and into Nathan's bedroom (until his parents move out).  I have very little packed and am positive that I'll end up leaving things behind.  I'm super excited about my new job and have bought tons of stuff for the classroom.  I'm hoping that the trainings this week and next will be worthwhile!  And well that's about all I can think of.  My brain is currently on overload and wanting more sleep than I'll possibly be able to get! ROFL oh well... Night.

      Today Nathan and I took a fun little trip to the North side of town to get prices on different things.  After laying on several matresses and finding that we are too poor to buy the ones we (I) like we ventured on to Target, Linens 'n Things, Pier1 and Lowes.  We found many things we liked and wrote our ideas down so we would not forget.  Luckily while we were at Lowes we decided to check out the tile section one more time before leaving... this led us to find the bathroom tile that we really liked that is super inexpensive.  So jumping on this rare chance, not willing to test our luck and their future stock, we bought enough tile to do our third bathroom (Cryntel - Corsica Blue).  Although now that we have all the tile we are not sure which bathroom to do in blue and which to do in black and white.  Lucky for me this will be Nathan's decision!  So yippee for us, we are one more step closer to having our building materials all bought. Woo hoo.

      Patti and I just returned from Lowe's where we purchased our new bathroom tiles. So far, its only for the master (upstairs) and guest bathroom (downstairs). For the master bathroom, we chose the  Congoleum - Triumph Natural Stone . The bathroom will be very "earthy" with natural colors and patterns. For the downstairs bathroom, we're going for a two-tone look (this one is mine!) and it will be black and white. The flooring is  Armstrong - Granville White .  As soon as my parents move out, we'll be painting the bathrooms and laying down the new floor. But this is our first house purchase!

      Next weekend will be another step in making the house a little more "ours". Patti and I will be picking up the new tiles for the bathroom floors and also replacing the curtains on the door to the backyard. The guy who fixed the upstairs carpet (and put in the new carpet border downstairs) tore the curtains! We may be changing the tiles for the downstairs bathroom to something stronger and nicer, but we'll decide that when we get there.

      Welcome to those of you that dare to venture into the insane world of myself and Nathan.  By now you are aware that we are starting a life together in just a few short weeks and we want you to be a part of it.  Well aren't you special! ;-)  If we didn't love you we wouldn't have told you! Ok well maybe we just want to gloat a little. ROFL.  But anyway, welcome to our site about our new lives.  Hope you enjoy reading about it!

      Our names are Nathan and Patti. We just bought our first house together and we're really excited about it. Between the two of us, we have at least 15 blogs, but none of our blogs that we share are viewable for the public. So we decided to create this as a journal for our friends (that would be you) to check whenever you are absolutely, completely, undeniably bored. After all, we're sure you're lives are more interesting than this blog, but nevertheless, we subject ourselves to your scrutiny, adoration, criticism, envy, and pity...and it can continue 24 hours a day because the Internet never dies.  Sorry, back on topic. This blog will be about our adventures in home ownership and our lives as an unmarried couple living together. I already told you that we are excited so I won't mention it again. (haha)

      With her training beginning tomorrow, Patti has moved in with a lot of her stuff tonight. It took less than 45 minutes to get it all in the house and about 15 - 20 minutes to organize and lay out. Before she arrived, I cleaned most of the bathroom (didn't have time for every square inch), my bedroom, and did a lot of vacuuming and dusting. I also cleaned off my entire windowseat. "Ever since I was a little girl, I've always wanted a windowseat that I could work on." So now she has one.  I did everything I could to create as much space for her as possible so she wouldn't feel cramped for the three weeks until my parents move out. Its not a Marriot, but I can still see some of the floor and have access to all my stuff. Worked out pretty well in my opinion. She's already hooked up to the DSL router and her stuff is all over the bathroom. With all four of us under one roof, this is going to be an interesting three weeks!

      Well with New Teacher Training this Thursday I have tons of things to wrap up here in Downey before I move to Moreno Valley.  I have so many things to pack, just clothing is a ton.  Then there will be the frequent weekend trips to pick up forgotten things.  Ugh.  On a positive note I will be signing the loan papers this Wednesday for the house, so things seem to be moving along nicely. I'm super excited but super stressed... Oh well, what's new! ROFL

      Now that Patti has a job teaching 5th grade at Jackson Elementary in Riverside, schedules have to change a little. She will be moving in to the house in the last week of June and will (unfortunately for her) be here for my parents' moving out. She'll get to witness the chaos and stress first hand. It also means that my room just got more cramped! Yesterday, we went out and purchased a 4' tall plastic chest of drawers so she can keep clothes here for work. She and I will probably be going back to her parents' house every weekend in preparation of moving out here permanently.  I have to get ready to share my space with someone else and not really having the space to do it. I have a bathroom and bedroom meant for one. But it will definitely be fun and exciting! I think stuff like this just brings us closer together. (Ain't that sappy?) I'm looking forward to it. As I see it, I get a preview of living with Patti BEFORE escrow closes.. *evil grin* ;)

      My parents have bought a home in Amherst, NY. Its more than 300 sq. ft. larger than our current house and is BRAND NEW. That's the biggest surprise to me. It isn't even done being built yet. Construction is scheduled to finish sometime in August, but my parents are still leaving in July and will stay in a hotel until its done. The concern they have about that is what to do with Vickie. I have a feeling she will be staying here, but my hope is that Sue (my Dad's co-worker and Vickie's former owner) will take her in.  The house is 2 stories plus a basement, with the top floor being a decent sized loft. The basement that is the full size of the house. There are two bedrooms with the loft acting as a third. There is also a kitchen with a dinette and a separate dining room, living room, two walk-in closets, and a two car garage. It comes with a real porch in the front of the house and their new association will pay for all gardening and water. There's also a country club nearby that my Mom has already had lunch in.  So progress continues in this tumultuous process. This means Patti and I are one step closer to living together. :) Oh yeah - my parents will have to buy a new stove, but Patti and I get to keep the microwave. Probably for a garage sale.

      As I wrote an e-mail to a friend, I realized that not everyone I know will understand the name of this blog (Welcome Home (Sanitarium)). So here's a brief explanation...  Patti and I were looking for a name for the blog and wanted something that would reflect who we are but also be somthing "home related". After chatting about random phrases, expressions, and word play, I suggested something musical. Namely, something from the realm of Metallica! I sifted through titles and lyrics, but there was one obvious choice: Welcome Home (Sanitarium). For those of you playing along at home, you can find this musical masterpiece on track four of their third album release "Master of Puppets" ( Lyrics ). Patti and I are both certifiably nuts, but we're both Metallica-loving homeowners so the song works!

      Two tin cans and a string would be easier to deal with than the crap I've had to put up with lately.  4 states 3 time zones 5 cities 15 people 2 weeks  The premise of a new reality show? Nope! A cool trip Patti and I are planning? Nope!  This is what it took for us to order DSL! Best of all, the order still hasn't been placed! That will happen tomorrow morning and once I get the necessary software and hardware, this process will be finished. In my effort to make the lives of my friends (that's you) a little easier and my goal of leaving a mark in history, I make the following recommendation:   AVOID  VERIZON   AT ALL COSTS!   Their customer service is atrocious, their capabilities are nothing more than a Neanderthal at Comdex, and their internal computer system is less reliable than two tin cans and a string.  ...in other news...  Patti and I had our first barbequed meal tonight. It was her famous aluminum foil chicken dinner and I had it for the first time. I will definitely request that again. Its really good! Food aside, I'm 2/3 done with installing the new tracks on the kitchen drawers and Patti has been busy putting shelf liner in and we're cleaning a whole bunch of pots, pans, dishes, and glasses everynight. She broke her crockpot tonight and had never even used it before. We also bought two new cordless phones last night from Target and they work pretty well. I like 'em and that's teh important thing because she didn't seem to care. Shopping was fun for that!

      Its been too long since the last update to this blog. As you might imagine, Patti and I have been extremely busy with work and, of course, making our new home reflect what we'd like it to look like: ours.  One of the most recent things we've done is a trip to Lowe's to get some paint and get started on changing the internal colors of the house. Patti got the idea to paint the walls behind the&nbsp;laundry and the refrigerator a bright white in an attempt to lighten the areas. It has worked considerably for the area behind the fridge and the washer/dryer area is still to come. She also had some designs for her closet. After doing a considerable amount of cleaning of the walls and shelves, she and I ripped out the carpet on the floor of the closet and replaced it with a nice piece of pine. Then the whole closet got painted white (same as the fridge area) and it looks awesome. We've decided that the whole bedroom will now be white because it looks so good.  For me, the projects have been somewhat less successful. My first mission was a new dog door for Blacky to fit through. A sawzall would have come in VERY handy for this project. But instead, I went ghetto and had to chisel through wood with a hammer and screwdriver. After hours of back-altering work, its about 75% done but easily usable and Blacky has adjusted very well. He hasn't moved yet, but at least we know that when he does, we won't have to worry about him using the door. My next project installing a new lighting fixture in the entryway to the master bedroom. I attempted that at 8:30pm and called it quits around 9:30 when things just didn't seem to be fitting right. I may end up taking it back to Lowe's and getting a smaller one more appropriate for the location.  So in summation, Patti's projects are going great and making things look better while mine seem to serve no other purpose than stripping my masculinity and leaving me with failure. (Was that over dramatized?!) But throughout all of these projects, we've been dealing with the details like utility companies, washing the dishes that have come out of storage, working and going to school, and ordering lots of take-out. I'm also still the Yard Commander and in charge of insect patrol, lawn maintenance, tree trimming, etc.  Its been a lot of hard work so far but I wouldn't trade it for anything. I think we're having a great time with the projects and living together has been wonderful so far. We will be moving all of the furniture this weekend and my friend Andrew has been kind enough to offer his assistance. Hopefully, once that final phase of major moving is completed, we'll be able to put the house together the way we want it.  After all is said and done, and we finally have settled in, we will be sending out invitations to our housewarming party. We're really looking forward to having all of you come and visit the new home and drink with us. I've already started preparing the alcohol supply for a diverse and prolonged necessity of thirsts. :)

      Escrow will officially close tomorrow and my parents will become squatters! I told them we would charge them rent if that made them feel more comfortable and respectable. ;)  Patti and I will pack up her room at her parents house on this upcoming weekend and then have all of her stuff (bedroom and storage) moved in by the end of the month. It will take a few trips, even with the Jeep, truck, and rented trailer, but it will finally be done. Hopefully, the housewarming party will happen by the end of August. We've already come up with a cool contest idea for the party (not sharing it with you yet) and our wish list for the house is enormous.  Patti and I have been putting a lot of time and effort into the landscaping of the house and preparing it for some of our ideas. She's done an incredible job working over a lot of the land and cleaning things up. We estimate that we can start our cactus garden in 2 - 3 weeks and we are looking at ways of removing the tons of lava rock all over the property. I've been on bug detail for a couple of months and go around smelling like pesticide. Everytime someone spots an ant anywhere outside, I'm called in with the sprayer to be John Goodman. Its fun and chemically educational!  Other than that fun stuff, my parents things get packed up on Wednesday and shipped out on Thursday. They'll be staying in a hotel until the 21st and then they board a plane for Buffalo. On the 16th, they'll be returning to the house to help do a lot of the cleaning (since all the furniture will be gone). Oddly, the house will be nearly devoid of furniture for over a week since we're not moving Patti's stuff until the weekend of the 23rd. I called most of the utilities today and taken the necessary steps to have the accounts put into my name. But it looks like we'll save a nice chunk of change if we switch to SBC for phone service and get their DSL service. I'll tackle that tomorrow.

      Patti and I did a huge amount of shopping for both groceries and home improvements. We started at Target with a list of four things we wanted to buy there. Big surprise - they didn't carry a single item. That sucked, but since a couple of the items were for Blacky, we just went next door to PetSmart and got them there. One of the things Patti bought was a new ID tag for Blacky with his new address. :)  After that, we headed to Lowe's and just went crazy. We're finally getting around to working on the master bathroom and wanted to buy all new stuff for it. That includes lighting fixtures, accessories, and paint. Not only did we get that stuff, we also bought a ton of other stuff for some other household projects and after purchasing the items, realized how poor we really are. LOL. :) Damn houses are expensive!  After that, we did a bunch of shopping for groceries at CostCo. I pointed out to Patti that we had reached our monthly grocery budget and could no longer buy food for the rest of August. We'll just have to starve. Damn food is expensive!  The good thing is that we are keeping good records of our purchases and staying within our budget (as best we can). Since this is the first month of budgeting and record keeping, I think its going along nicely. I've created some useful Excel spreadsheets to aid in the process. I strongly recommend doing that for anyone keeping a budget.  NEwayz, the house is coming along nicely and we look forward to getting it "done".
