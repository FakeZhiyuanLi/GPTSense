      We wanted to go out of town for the weekend, but we decided to stay in instead. Chris is with his Dad this weekend, so we're on our own. I thought I'd turn the house a little bit more "hotelish" for us. I went out and got some fresh flowers, candles and wine. We had a very romantic dinner last night. Tried out some Yellow Tail Chardonnay. It was OK. I don't think it's worth getting again, but it hasn't turned me off to Chardonnay yet. We've got some more Aussie wine to try out tonight.  Dennis took me to see Shreck 2. It was pretty cute - very silly. I want to check out The Day After Tomorrow as well.  Our plan for today is to go to the Soulard Farmers Market with the cooler this morning, then head over to Belleville to pick our own strawberries. :-D

      The picnic worked out wonderfully. I grabbed a new basket, a citronella candle, a pre-made turkey club sandwich on wheat, some bottled water, some grape tomatoes, some yummy crackers, and some nectarines at the store. I took along our goat cheese, cranberry curd, a white wine, and the chocolate chip cookies.  We went to Sandy Creek Covered Bridge and ate - everything! Then I walked up and down the creek a little. Should have gotten Dennis to wear his slip-on shoes so he'd come in with me. The baby bluegill were picking at my toes :-D  (The wine made me giddy followed by sleepy!)  It was so nice to get out and just spend time with Dennis and not worry about anything at all. Something to do more often for sure!

      I want to take a romantic picnic in the park this evening.  We're celebrating the two year anniversary of something this month.  It isn't when we met, when we started dating, when we fell in love, or when we moved in together.  It's just some random time between meeting and dating when our contact started to increase beyond "some person I see at various events around town from time to time."  I'm taking some goat cheese - we have that already, I'm going to go make some chocolate covered strawberries in a few minutes.  I don't know what else to take, but I'll settle on something as I stroll through the grocery store after a bit.  Always dangerous to do with the debit card in hand :)  I'm tired.  It's been a hard week at work.  I can't even count the number of tiny things I've been criticized for, and I was in the office by myself all day Monday.  Of course accepting criticism is not one of my strong points as it is, but come on already!  It just wears you out after a while, to have everything picked over like that.

      Well, date day and night with my son that is :)  Dennis is gone to Wisconsin, so Chris and I headed up to Forest Park.  We rode the Giant Wheel that is there to celebrate the 1904 World's Fair.  Chris had to keep me safe cause I got a little scared :)   Big Scary Wheel:     View of downtown you don't usually see:    After the wheel, we went to picnic by the boathouse.  We fed some lettuce to ducks.  They didn't really like it.  Snobby ducks!  Then we rented a peddle boat.  We made it all the way to Post-Dispatch lake at the bottom of Art Hill.  Oh, it was fun.  Chris was a good peddler too.  He never really did stop or get too tired.  Good thing, cause I would have worn myself out without help!  We ran back home for a while to rest up, then headed back out for the Muny's production of Meet Me in St. Louis.  Chris liked the real trolley and the fireworks at the end, but I don't think he was totally thrilled by the rest of the show.  I can't really say that I was either, except watching a play about the 1904 World's Fair in Forest Park where it actually took place was pretty spectacular!  We got home very late and found Dennis already here!  Yea!

      We were at the Sears Craftsman Nationals Friday night.  Here's what I wrote then: (from  urlLink Neons.org )  "Top Fuel wasn't running as hot as Funny Car. In between rounds we went back to the pits and watched Darrell Russell's crew for the entire rebuild. Darrell is very nice, not at all like stupid John Force  He packs his own chute and pours his own gas too. (And did I mention he's quite cute on top of all that?  ) Anyhoo, we must have been good luck, cause he came out in the last run of the night and busted a 4.511 @ 328.54, for the #1 spot and obliterated the track record. This was the quickest run I've ever seen. Awesome!"  I was so impressed with Darrell Russell.  He was going to be my new favorite race car driver.  I even dragged Dennis out of our way to pass by his pit one last time after he put down that amazing run!  I checked up on the results last night on the NHRA website.  I saw that Russell had had a crash, but there were no more details at that time.  Dennis left for Wisconsin with his Dad first thing this morning.  I came back in from seeing them off and flipped on the TV.  The first thing I heard was, "Stay tuned for details of the fatal crash at Gateway last night."  Oh crap!  I knew exactly what that meant.  I was stunned and shocked and upset much more than I probably should have been by the news that he had died in that wreck.  I had a very upsetting day at work because of it.  Just cast such a pall over everything.  Strange how that happens sometimes at the news of death.  Maybe it's just my birthday yesterday has got me more in touch with mortality in general right now.  I just know that Darrell Russell was absolutely NOT dead Friday night.  Everything was so normal, so routine.  Nobody had any idea what was coming.  Of course Dennis and his Dad just left to go drag racing too, which isn't helping matters any!  Rest in Peace, Mr. Darrell Russell

      Well, I'm 27.  Just about time to quit telling!  As promised, text from Dennis's card:  "A Promise of Love for Your Birthday"  I wish I could buy you A thousand beautiful gifts For your birthday - Fancy things, luxuries, Suprises to delight you - But I know the things That make life happy Can't be bought  ...like love, And the closeness Two people share  Time - Days spent together When we're happy No matter what we're doing...  Kindness - The little things we do For one another...  These things can't be bought, And yet They're the best gifts of all...  And so, For your birthday, I'm giving you this promise As part of my gift - To love you even more And make you Even happier, To make all our days Together Days to remember Always.  Happy Birthday All my love always  Dennis   Yes, vomit :)  It made me cry when I got it.  He makes me such a girly-girl.  *sigh*    For my birthday gift, Dennis, Chris and I went to Litchfield.  We stopped by my folk's house and picked up Mom.  We all four went to the lake to play at the playground.  There is a "pizza pan" spinning thing that I almost made Dennis sick on!  Then we went to  urlLink The Ariston , which is an old cafe on Route 66.  I just love the place!  I had a french dip, which was excellent as always.  The suprise of the evening was an ENTIRE two layer red velvet cake.  This place has the best desserts.  Oh, it was heavenly!     I love the way Dennis listens to me and goes out of his way to please me.  This was such a special birthday because I got something so simple, but so me.  It's so nice to be loved!  If you ever go, though, you really should get a horseshoe sandwich.  It's the central Illinois thing to do.   From cooking.com:  The signature food of Springfield, Illinois is a sandwich known as a horseshoe. It has been credited to a chef that worked at the Leland Hotel in 1928 and has become Springfield's most famous contribution to the world of food. It consists of two hamburgers on two slices of toast, covered with cheddar cheese sauce and buried beneath a mound of French fries.   For the Welsh Rarebit Sauce: 2 tablespoons salted butter 1/2 cup beer 2 egg yolks 3 cups grated Old English or other sharp white cheddar 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 1/4 teaspoon dry mustard Salt  For the Sandwich: 1 1/2 pounds ground beef Salt and freshly ground pepper 8 slices toasted thick white bread 2 pounds cooked French fries   TO MAKE THE SAUCE: Set up a double boiler or set a medium-sized stainless-steel bowl over a pot of simmering water. Check to make sure the bottom of the bowl is not touching the water. Melt the butter in the double boiler and then add the beer. While constantly whisking, slowly incorporate the egg yolks. Add the cheese and stir constantly until melted and the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon: this should take 5 to 8 minutes. Add the Worcestershire and mustard. Season the sauce with salt to taste. To avoid a stringy sauce, it is important to constantly stir the cheese and be sure that the water is not boiling, but rather simmering.   TO COOK THE BEEF: Season the beef with the salt and pepper and form it into eight 6-ounce patties. Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat or set up an electric grill, and cook the patties, a few at a time, 5 minutes per side for medium.   TO ASSEMBLE THE DISH: For each serving, place two slices of the toast on a large plate and top each with a patty. Pour the rarebit sauce over the beef and top the sauce with French fries. Serve immediately.   Recipe courtesy the Leland Hotel, Springfield, Illinois   Of course you can always get your horseshoe with ham instead of beef.  I actually like the ham better.

      Tomorrow is my 27th birthday.  Dennis and Chris made a run to Target to get my gifts.  Dennis got Austin Powers on DVD and Chris got Bruce Almighty on VHS.  We took Chris to see Bruce Almighty at the theater.  I did like it, probably not enough to own it, but it's really very sweet that he remembered.  :)  What a cutie I have!  Dennis's card was disgustingly sappy!  I'll have to type it out when I've got a bit more time.  (Wordy...)

      I finally have time to read again!  I used to read voraciously, but school reading really cuts into leisure reading.  I'm graduated, so it's time to start up again in earnest.  I think I missed too much literature during my science & math heavy college career, so I clipped the Cliff's Notes list as a "summer" reading list.  Of course it's going to take much more than summer to do it, but you always have to force yourself into reading the "classics."   I cut what I had read within a reasonable amount of time.  I cut a whole slew of Dickens.  I cut randomly.  I had Dennis shout "delete" at whatever interval he felt like.  The list is still too long.  Yes, I have missed quite a bit!  No, I honestly haven't read any of these except for Pearl Buck's The Good Earth, which I believe we tackled in 10th grade?  I'm sure I'll gain new appreciation to re-read it.  Ambassadors, Henry James Anna Karenina, Leo Tolstoy As I Lay Dying, Faulkner Bean Trees, Barbara Kingsolver  Black Like Me, John Howard Griffin    Canterbury Tales, Geoffrey Chaucer Death of a Salesman, Arthur Miller Different Drummer, William Melvin Kelley  Dubliners, Joyce Ethan Frome, Wharton Farewell to Arms, Ernest Hemingway Frankenstein, Mary Shelley  Giver, Lois Lowry Good Earth, Pearl Buck   Idiot, Fyodor Dostoevsky Inherit the Wind, Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee Jane Eyre, Charlotte Bronte Killer Angels, Michael Shaara Light in August, William Faulkner Madame Bovary, Gustave Flaubert Man and Superman & Caesar and Cleopatra,  George Bernard Shaw Miss Lonelyhearts & The Day of the Locust, Nathanael West Moll Flanders, Daniel Defoe   Nana, Emile Zola Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass Notes from Underground, Fyodor Dostoevsky  Old Man and the Sea, Hemingway   One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Kesey Outsiders, S.E. Hinton's Pearl, John Steinbeck Pickwick Papers, Charles Dickens Picture of Dorian Gray, Oscar Wilde   Raisin in the Sun, Vivian Hansberry Red and the Black, Robert Stendhal Red Badge of Courage, Crane Rivals & School for Scandal, Richard Brinsley Sheridan Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen Sound and the Fury, William Faulkner Steppenwolf & Siddhartha, Herman Hesse Stranger, Albert Camus Sun Also Rises, Ernest Hemingway  Tender Is the Night, F. Scott Fitzgerald Tess of the d'Urbervilles, Hardy Three Musketeers, Alexandre Dumas Victory, Joseph Conrad Way of the World, William Congreve Winesburg, Ohio, Sherwood Anderson Winter's Tale, William Shakespeare Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte Yellow Raft in Blue Water, Michael Dorris  I have every intention of picking up more from the Cliff's Notes list at a later date.  This is more than enough, no?

      Oh boy, I really hurt my back!  I have no idea what I did, but I know that every possible position I can put my body into hurts.  A lot.  I hope I didn't do anything serious to myself!  Dennis has been quite a help.  I can't do much but lay in bed.  Sheesh!  I have to work this week.  I wonder how that's going to be?  We needed to get the apartment ready.  Chris is coming back from his grandparent's house this evening.  He's starting summer camp at the Y tomorrow morning.  *fingers crossed* for smooth sailing getting ready!

      I took my sister to her first good rock n roll concert Saturday night.  We saw  urlLink The Wildhearts  and  urlLink The Darkness  at  urlLink The Pageant  in the Loop.  I'd never been there before, but it is a huge improvement over Mississippi Nights.  Excellent club, excellent crowd, excellent show, amazingly LOUD!  I had a great time, reminded me of good old rock n roll shows that I used to drag my poor mom to.  Apparently Ginger of The Wildhearts wasn't fibbing when he said St. Louis was great...   urlLink Tour Diary Page .

      Oh wonderous!  I got bumped to part time at work.  How annoying.  I know I'm on my way out anyway.  I believe my boss is incapable of being pleased with anything - ever!  Hopefully they'll fund my job search.  Part time with no benefits is just too much to take.  Shame, I honestly do like the work.

      Not the metal band, but the book.  I got it. I read it. I didn't hate it. I just can't  love  it. This is a great American writer, and a great American book from the last century. I see the richness, but it rang a little empty for me. I was instantly reminded of Edgar Lee Master's  Spoon River Anthology , which was written 15 years earlier and is much prettier, at least as full, and just as biting and ironic, and hits just as sharp a chord of "America" as Faulkner does, not to mention the close connection with death and dying. Of course poets (seeds in a dry pod) can always brave new territory first, but let's be honest. Faulkner wasn't pioneering stream-of-consciousness. It'd been going in poetry for - ever? And Ulysses, king of the genre, was published about 10 years earlier. Anti-Victorianism had been going on since the 1870s. Heck,  Anna Karenina  had some serious stream-of-consciousness sections in it and it was published starting in 1873. Did catch an  urlLink interesting paper  someone wrote about Faulkner and cubism and surrealism. Maybe I'm just reading it so late that the freshness isn't fresh anymore?  Beyond all of that, I did like the book. I like the fact that I can say "I've read that" if it ever comes up in conversation for some reason. I like the fact that I've been to Yoknapatawpha County, even if I could never spell that without looking, and I'm not 100% sure I can pronounce it :)   My favorite passages are when Faulkner breaks through his characters and slaps down a big hefty chunk of prose.  WOW!  Now if I can get  that  in larger doses, please?  I will read more of him just because I saw what's hiding behind all of those darn ourns and tothers.

      I spent some time this morning adding text to my footer, moving my Blogger and Site Meter buttons down there, and adding a Links section to the sidebar.&nbsp; I even managed to make it look like the other sidebar lists.&nbsp; Wow!  After that, I realized that I don't have much to link to.&nbsp; My email and homepage are listed in my Profile, and everything else I've got up as a link right now is already accessible from my homepage.&nbsp; I guess I ought to think of some more interesting links, and work on adding those this afternoon.  *yawn*&nbsp; I don't really enjoy my days off.&nbsp; I wish I was working five days a week because staying home is not too much fun.&nbsp; I know it is stressing me out, and stressing Dennis out too.&nbsp; Blah.&nbsp; Maybe I should volunteer for something?

      I'm going to finish reading Tolstoy's Anna Karenina today.&nbsp; It reads very quickly for such&nbsp;a long book (my copy is 817 pages.)&nbsp; I just found out that The Penguin Classics version of it is the current selection for  urlLink Oprah's Book Club . I feel like such a joiner! I didn't know until I saw it on display on an endcap at K-Mart with a big banner announcing it as "Oprah's Summer Pick!"   Now I know why it was so darn hard to get my hands on one of the 20-something copies the library keeps.&nbsp; I think I may sign up for Oprah's book club just to see what other people are saying about it.&nbsp; I may have a bit of an unique view of it since I have been through leaving my husband for another man.&nbsp; Maybe I'll even have something meaningful to contribute.   I'm so glad I've started reading!&nbsp; It makes me really happy.&nbsp; Anna Karenina is not a happy book, but it is so beautifully written.&nbsp; I think this was an excellent choice to follow Henry James's The Ambassadors.&nbsp; They were both writing inner monologue, they both handled their novels in a similar fashion.&nbsp; But where James is nearly impossible to read sometimes, Tolstoy shines.&nbsp; There are difficult passages, the characters go through exceptionally complex trains of thought, and the whole time you can't help but understand everything.&nbsp; I personally think James went too far in the academic sense of what he was doing.&nbsp; So far that the story almost disappears.&nbsp; The things he left out were almost too big to make anything of it.&nbsp; Tolstoy is a much better read.&nbsp; It seems that  this  is what James should have done.&nbsp; The sense of accomplishment I had after I finished The Ambassadors was mostly "whew, I made it through that!"&nbsp; I am honestly enjoying this one though.   Oh, got the bug to go read.&nbsp; Sitting here typing isn't getting me to the end of the book any quicker :)

      We went drag racing last night.&nbsp; Not much exciting happened, but Dennis's new car is  slow !&nbsp; As in 16.6 @ 82.&nbsp; Much slower than it should be.&nbsp; I ran two 15.6s at 89 and 88.&nbsp; Both on high 2.3 60' times.&nbsp; Bleh.&nbsp; The air was heavy and the track wasn't great, but I expected more MPH out of the car since I changed the computer.&nbsp; I know I short shifted the first run because I forgot the how high the new rev limiter is.&nbsp; Hehe!  Right as we were getting ready to leave, Chris got bit / stung on the ear lobe by something.&nbsp; Poor thing :(

      Yesterday&nbsp;was Dennis's dad's 52nd birthday.&nbsp; Dennis called  urlLink The Pasta House  and ordered Chicken Flamingo, a dozen rolls&nbsp;and their famous salad from the bulk carry-out menu.&nbsp; We stopped by the grocery and grabbed a&nbsp;triple chocolate layer cake and a quart of Neopolitan ice cream, then&nbsp;picked&nbsp;up our chicken and took it all down to his parents' house. &nbsp; It was a nice dinner, but Romeo (their&nbsp;Yorkie) and Chris don't get along very well.&nbsp; They were both very wound up and both very noisy!&nbsp; Neither one of them listened to us either ;)&nbsp;

      I had a job interview once that included a personality test.  It is lame because you can easily defeat these quick-hit versions.  They are doubled up to catch you in lies, but if you keep with your story and keep in mind what your boss would want to hear, it is pretty easy.  I just did this with no intentions behind my answers.  So if you believe in these things, this is me:                     Introverted (I) 58.33% Extroverted (E) 41.67%  Imaginative (N) 53.49% Realistic (S) 46.51%  Intellectual (T) 50% Emotional (F) 50%  Organized (J) 52.63% Easygoing (P) 47.37%

      This song cracks me up!  I hear it at work and almost laugh out loud because it reminds me so much of the summer Dennis and I met.  Liz Phair - Why Can't I?

      My summer reading list is going very slowly.  It took me a long time to finish Henry James's  The Ambassadors.   It was a different kind of read.  Lots of internal dialogue and ramblingly beautiful sentence structure.  There are very few people I would recommend it to, because it takes a special kind of patience and a very quiet room to get much from James's classic "late James" style.  I know a lot of people who would give up after the second paragraph though :)  Dennis gave this one a whirl:  "The principle I have just mentioned as operating had been, with the most newly disembarked of the two men, wholly instinctive - the fruit of a sharp sense that, delightful as it would be to find himself looking, after so much separation, into his comrade's face, his business would be a trifle bungled should he simply arrange for this countenance to present itself to the nearing steamer as the first 'note' of Europe."  It slows you down a lot :)  The library has lost the copy of Anna Karenina that I put on hold Monday.  I hope it shows up soon.  They'll get me another copy, but still, it sucks to lose a book like that.

      The  urlLink St. Louis Cardinals  are heading into the All Star Break 7 games ahead of the second place Cubs!  They're the second best team in all of baseball with a silly record of 54 - 33.  Get ready folks, we're going to have some rough losing streaks in the second half.  At least there will be Olympics to distract us for a while...

      Finally got around to scanning this:     It's from our  urlLink trip to Six Flags on the 4th .  I know it says that right on the picture :)  We watched the alligator show, then paid $5 for this horrible Polaroid.  Chris is holding a three-year-old alligator, and I'm holding Chris.  Apologies for the terrible over-exposure of the print.

      Work annoyance:  This morning one of the things left on my desk was a pile of fax cover sheets.  Here's why: My boss rarely uses a computer, so they're already copied and you have to *gasp* use a typewriter to fill them out when you need them.  I am not good at hitting lines with a typewriter.  So I decided last Friday to make my own fax cover sheet on the computer.  I printed it out on letterhead and everything.  I thought it looked quite nice, plus it is now a template like all of the other forms we use.  Apparently that was bad and wrong, and I must be too stupid to make my own copies from the stack of 58 fax cover sheets I already have.  Oh well.  Gotta concentrate more on the job search.  I don't know how I'm supposed to develop loyalty to this :)  Yeah, if you could just take care of the covers for the TPS reports, that'd be great...   Apartment annoyance:  Somebody doesn't like us closing the pool.  In their very best impression of second graders, they called the landlady and tattled that we were, "at the pool till 10:00 after we made everyone else leave at 9:00," and that my son was, "in the pool all by himself, with nobody watching him."  Neither was true.  We were at the pool later than anyone else, but we locked up at 9:00 by the watch we took down there with us so we wouldn't be late.  It's pitch black at 10:00.  Wouldn't we have noticed???  Chris got to the pool before we did by about 45 seconds.  I had a shoe delay :)  I was irritated that he went straight in, but we could see him the whole time and the pool was full of people.  He did get spoken to about it last night though, and again today after we found out we're living with a mole!  Landlady called with a long message today.  Later found out who was responsible for the call, that the landlady knows it is all crap, and that my neighbor is even more of a drama queen that I had figured.  And I had figured her for a BIG one all along!   Moral of the story:  WHO CARES!  IT'S FRIDAY!!!

      Just got back from the cookout at Chris's day camp.  There was only one other parent there today.  I hope that makes him feel special :)  Especially after all of the things I could have gone to if Paul would have only bothered to tell me about them.  The Circle Y Ranch is pretty cute.  It's back in those Jefferson County hills I want so badly to move into.  Or on top of, I should say.  There's a beautiful little creek that runs through the middle.  It's got a rock bottom, of course, as all of the creeks in the hills seem to have.  There's also a nice weathered section of limestone bluff along one side for a while.  It was exceptionally humid, since it had just finished raining when I arrived.  Steam was rising off of everything around.  It had rained very hard on my way down, so that I almost missed a turn because it was hard to see, and my brakes were really soggy so I almost missed it again after I'd finally found it.  The kids had caught about 10 frogs and toads and the cutest little red / orange salamander!  I'm not sure what species it was since our little field guide only has about 5 types altogether.  Hrm, I should invest in better field guides.  I do wish I had one every so often, and they'd make great bedtime stories for Chris.  Didn't bring the camera again.  I need to velcro it to myself!  I'll try to remember next week.

      Edited pictures of last night's storms.  My degree in meteorology was't an accident.  I love bad weather.  I was excited to have gotten two lightning pictures.  It's hard to do.  Just lucky, I should say.  The volume of strikes last night made it a lot easier!

      It's our last day off together.  Dennis's last day of an eleven day vacation!  We're being vegetables.  I think I'd like to be celery.  Maybe Dennis is an eggplant?  We were going to go downtown to Fair St. Louis Saturday night to see the big fireworks, but after it got rained out Friday and there was a good chance of rain Saturday, we opted for another trip to Festus.  This time we took Chris with us and got another $30 worth of fireworks.  Chris is taken with sparklers this year.  Forgot to take the digital camera though.  Darn, there would have been some cute pictures!  Yesterday I got my birthday present from my parents.  We all went to Six Flags.  Oh, my dad was in fine form.  :x  Dennis tried really hard to keep him entertained and distracted.  It was a nice try, but it didn't work.  He wound up going to sit by the entrance for the rest of the day.  Weeine.  It gave Dennis a good glimpse behind the scenes.  Not sure that's exactly what I wanted him to see :)  I didn't let it ruin my day.  We tried really hard to have fun.  As always, the 4th of July was HOT and MUGGY.  Blah.  I didn't get to ride The Boss, Mr. Freeze, or the Screamin' Eagle.  For some reason they shut some of the coasters down for the day?  We didn't make it to the water park either, which was fine by me!

      Due to a schedule conflict with Paul, Dennis and I wound up going to Festus to shoot fireworks by ourselves last night.  We bought about $80 worth.  I'm still very childlike about fireworks, since we had a very limited selection in Illinois when I was a kid.  Oh, and blowing stuff up is cool too!  We had a lot of fun.  We almost always have fun.  He's a fun guy.  Being in love is fun!  Being in love and shooting fireworks is even more fun!  *yawn* we were out late, for a couple of old fogies...

      Chris and I spent the day at the  urlLink City Museum  today. We did so much climbing and crawling and sliding! I'm worn out!  I got scared when we were way up in this airplane. It's higher than it looks up there, and it's just built over the parking lot...     The new caves are really cool too. They used the old lightwell of the building for part of it. It's very neat!    It was so fun!  It's really tiring though.  I came home and took a nap :)

      Dennis took me out to the Bella Sera Italian Grill on Gravois Friday night. We just had sandwiches. I got a grilled chicken club, and he got a steak and cheese. They were both very good. Not as good as the fish tacos at the same location when it was a mexican grill though :) Sandwiches came with fries, which they graciously substituted with sauteed spinach. The spinach was excellent! Neither of us felt up to a $5 glass of wine. I didn't see until we were leaving that they had Schlafly on tap, or I would have had some of that with my sandwich. If they stay open longer than the mexican place did, we will go back.  Then we went to  urlLink Oberweis  for desert. He had a very fancy waffle cone with brownie ice cream. I had a hot fudge sundae. He liked it better than Ted Drewes, but I didn't. It was  very  good though.  We rented three movies, watched one each day over the weekend: Bad Santa (hated it!), The Butterfly Effect (liked it a lot, and it didn't creep me out), and Secondhand Lions (liked it, very cute).  For all of that, it was a very boring weekend.

      Dennis and I met before the Gateway Neons meeting at Clydesdale Park.  We talked and cuddled and talked.  Then he tried to kiss me!  I ducked a little bit.  We decided to skip the meeting and head for the fireworks instead.  We stopped by Mobil to get some gas.  I suprised him with a quick kiss on the lips.  Awww, our first kiss!  And nobody died either...  After the fireworks, we went back to south county and ate at Steak N Shake.  We kissed again in the parking lot - with feeling :)

      From:   dennis   To:   marfells@hotmail.com Subject:   Who me? Victim? Nope! Date:   Tue 07/09/02 09:45 PM        **I know this reply is late(lost the 1st attempt! DAMMIT!), and a lot of the things in this email have been resolved, disolved, and covered in real life, so I'll keep this reply brief so I can get to the others ;-) It's harder to reply to these now, because I have been seeing you so much in real life, and I would much rather do this for real than in email!!   LOL - hahahahaha, you are officially a victim of the drunk dial!  I wouldn't say drunk, maybe, but it sure was the "been drinking" dial ;)  I was drinking by myself :'''''(  **If you ever need to call. Call. If I'm here, I will pick up. If not, I will get to you as soon as I get the message.   Paul was out until 1:30 (in the morning)  I got scared - a lot!  Then I tried to get him to talk - he still won't talk so much.  He did say DENNIS a few times.  He doesn't think he deserves to be happy.  :'''''''(  I hate hurting people.  It is hard to *get tough* when he gets like that - I know he hurts, but I don't know how much he's acting out - pressing my button - every other time I've almost gone, all he had to do was cry and I lost all confidence.  This time, if he can't be a big boy, I'm going to have to just buckle down and get "mean" with him, I guess.  *sigh*  Why do we have to make things harder than they need to be?  *ouch*  **It looks like things are going OK now in this respect, or at least have improved since I received this email. I'm glad that he is at least trying to be civil with me in real life, even if when I leave he hates me.   I had to force myself to stop thinking about you.  I got close to "run away to Dennis" thinking - when I was trying to have Paul hold me - trying to hold him - he just can't do it right anymore...  It was hard - I really had to THINK --- concentrate on the moment instead of dreaming it away with you in my head.  I know I need to feel all of this - I can't lean you thoughts of you too much - this is for me, afterall.  What's the point if I don't get anything out of it?    **I'm glad you see that. I'm glad you are trying to do that. I want you to be done with that (as much as you can be) before you start this. Ha! Who am I kidding...we've already STARTED this....  What's the point if I build you up to some superhuman mystical creature that you can't possibly live up to in real life anyway?  **I know. That's what I was concerned that we were doing all along by doing all of this email/aim stuff and not seeing each other in person so much. But now that we've spent time together in real life, I realize that the aim/email showed us the TRUE us, the us that we are in real life without the distractions, without the filters that are required in order to live day to day. It allows us to be oursleves without fear when we're together. It accelerated our "getting to know each other" process tremendously, and was a positive thing. I know it has brought us closer than we would have been otherwise. I can't imagine our history being any other way.   Paul sees how much I love you - he saw it Thursday night.  He felt like a third wheel.  I told him that THAT is the REAL me - the me I can't be around him, the me that comes out when I'm at work, with friends, home alone - the me that runs away when Paul comes home, the me that he has hurt so many times.  I guess we really can't stay married if he's not married to ME, can we?  **And I know you've told him a lot more since then(just got off the phone w/you;-) and I'm glad that he's taking it as well as he is. I'm actually GLAD that he was there today. I got to look him face to face and be honest with him. To see that he CAN deal with me.....if he has to.  **The only thing that worries me is what is happening with his command of you not to see me....  I cried last night.  :''''''(  **I'm sorry to hear that.  ^^^Doh, thought I wasn't going to involve you :)  I suck at not  involving!  **You are doing OK. I am very curious as to what is going on, because I'm part of it. I can't NOT be part of it if I'm with you. AND DAMMIT I'M GOING TO BE WITH YOU!  Well you ARE a little scary...  :)  **What about me is scary to you???  God, I'm so sorry...  I mean sorry that we have bad timing :(  Sorry that I can't promise you there won't be some measure of OUCH involved...  Sorry that you have to experience it like this instead of under perfect conditions.  Sorry sorry sorry.  **I know what I'm doing here. I know the possible outcomes, including the bad ones. Don't be sorry. The fact that you are always telling me you're sorry kind of worries me... :-/  But I'm HAPPY too :-D  You make me happy.  Making you happy makes me happy.  Being with you makes me happy.  Getting email from you makes me happy.  Getting IMs from you makes me happy.  Reading your website makes me happy.  Reading you silly screen name makes me happy.  Thinking about you makes me happy.  I'm just one big ball of happiness :)  **:-) I'm happy and can ecco all of those things :-) But my fingers have a long night ahead of them, so I won't retype ;-)   I'm just scared today and sad.  I HATE hurting people.  I won't be able to handle hurting you...  "What have I become, my sweetest friend?  Everyone I know goes away in the end.  You could have it all...  My empire of dirt.  I will let you down,  I will make you hurt..."  You know, that song scares the shit out of me... except the last two lines!!!  "If I could start again, a million miles away... I would keep myself, I would find a way."  **I know that song is HURT. We can only be us. We can only play out these cards we've been so absolutely lucky to get dealt. Let's enjoy winning this round of cards, even if we don't end up going home with all of the money. You can have a lot of fun gambling, even if you don't win. Although I think we've got a steady supply of aces up our sleeves, and I KNOW we're both smart enough to play this game without losing it all.  There's always a little tiny piece of hope somewhere, isn't there?  **LITTLE TINY PIECE??? HOW ABOUT FRICKING HUGE!!!???!!! Shit, if I didn't beleive in my heart that this would turn out well I wouldn't have come this far with you!!! Do you think I would? With everything on the line? Do you think I'd throw you this rope if I wasn't going to pull you up with it? Do you think I'd give this much of my heart to you if I didn't truly beleive the risk was worth taking? That the odds were beatable?  **And that last line. That's bullshit. I wouldn't change a thing I've done since I met you. I would not keep myself a million miles away. Would you?  >**Sorry for being short on the hug, just had to get to work.   The hug was wonderful!  Just like you...  **:-) Thanks:-) You're quite a nice hugger yourself....:-)  Yeah, I try :)  To confuse you???  LOL!  I'm confused too - so just hang on :)  I'm not going back to the place where I hide from you... No more *coughing* - I'm just not going to get more involved as in anything "official" - just hangin out is enough for me at the moment.  I WANT more, don't get me wrong, I want to be with you totally.  But we've agreed that it's worth waiting for, so until then...  That's what I mean :)  **I understand. We've made ourselves quite clear, and I respect you along with your opinions. We'll find our way as we go along. Things change. We'll just have to see what the future brings us.   >**I'm waiting :-) :-) :-) I'd be crazy not to. What we have has finally sunken into my thick head. What we have is so special, I'd be a complete friggin idiot to not give it a little time. I mean, where else am I going to find an attractive, smart, pleasant, super sexy, caring, loving, wonderful, car chick that is in love with me? Nowhere! That's where! The fact that you're saving yourself for me makes me feel very loved.   LOL - just so you know, that doesn't necessarily rule out sport fucking for either of us ;)  I mean, dang, I gotta work on that total, right?  ;) ;) ;)  Since I'm competing with Karla and all...    **I'm not comfortable with the thought of you "sport fucking". The other day I said that if you had to, to not tell me about it. The more I think about it, the more I realize that I just don't want you to be with anyone else but me. And I surely don't want to be with anyone else but you!!! Please do not go down that road with me..... I can't say what my reaction will be :-/  **Your "total" and sexual history means nothing to me. The only thing I care about is your sexual future ;-) I only compare you to Karla because you're the only 2 women I know well enough to know your sexual histories. You are not competing with her, and don't feel like you are. I love both of you. Her as someone I've known forever and did LOVE like that once..... I guess there's a part of me that still loves her like that....always will be....but I'm over it and understand that she and I are just not compatible. And I just don't want to be with her in the same way I want to be with you. In my mind, there is no competition, only you. She is my friend, and I will continue to be her friend, but  you are the person I choose as my lover. 100%.  Hrm, I think I'll like being single for a while - I'm not sure - haven't thought it out totally.  I don't want to leap straight from BIG relationship to BIG relationship, at least that's how I feel today...  I don't know - let me know how you feel about that?    **I want to go into this with you SLOWLY. I know you don't think we can do it, but I KNOW I can. I have to. I'm transitioning from a complete single person with NO responsibility to someone that wants to share his life with you in every way.....plus there's Chris... I need to do this slowly. Neither of us should feel trapped or like we're doing this for any other reason than because we love each other and we want to be here.  What you said about being alone today on the phone worries me. That's exactly the kind of reasons that I want to go slow. I want you to have a chance to be a little bit alone. To realize that it's OK. To realize that you don't HAVE to be with me(or anyone!), and that you WANT to be with me.   I just feel incredible pressure to do everything right.  Have I  mentioned that I can be a terrible perfectionist?  Oh, yeah, and when I don't get things to work out the way I want them, I can sometimes get pissy and pouty?  I can be a big baby when I want to.  I'm not proud of that, but at least I know when I'm doing it.  Sometimes I even do it on purpose!  Depends on the situation - cause I don't give a shit about a lot of people I meet, and I have no problem using them to my own advantage.  I sure do have a treacherous, ruthless side of myself.   *edit* I do give a shit about you, so don't worry :)  **I'm a little like that too. I definitely feel a lot of pressure to not fuck this up. I really think we have a chance at something great here. It already is GREAT, but I want it to last.... I just want to learn 1 thing at a time instead of trying to learn physics over night ;-)  Anyway, yes, I'm sure I need time - otherwise I will hurt you - hurt me, do this whole dance all over again.  I totally see how the pattern repeats itself - people like to stay in grooves.  I'm getting out of this groove - I'm going to skip my record.  LOL - at least you are old enough to know what that analogy means :)  **Whatever you need, I will try to do. You asked me the other day on the phone if I thought we could stay apart and take some time. I said no. That's how I felt at the moment, but I will try if it means a greater chance of success for us. I do not beleive that it effects our outcome. You were the person who ended it with Paul. You were over him long ago as far as I can tell.... He'll be the person "rebounding".  I can play so nasty.  Don't let me get away with it.  I *need* a force in my life that is big enough to tell me NO.  Sometimes I get pretty full of myself.  Don't be afraid to "slap me around" of course not literally, just give me a good *shake, DUH!!!*    **I can play nasty too.....if I have to. I don't like to, but I WILL defend myself and stick up for myself. And I will tell you if I think something you're doing is bad for you or bad for US.  I remember a poem I wrote a long time ago - I have to find it.  It was good.  It was back when I knew myself better.  I usually don't do well with poetry...  I'm too picky gramatically.  When I do bust one out, it's fucking awesome!  :-D  **I knew you would be good at poetry. I have never really tried poetry, usually I just string some sentances together when I'm feeeling extra artistic, not really a poem, but better than just regular text. Kinda like my email from the other day "some words".  >**:-) :-) I can't stop smiling. See what you do to ME?   I'm glad.  I'm just a little ray of sunshine *roll eyes*  I'm so happy you "get" me.  I don't feel so fucking crazy now.  **You felt crazy before?   **That's your new nickname: Sunshine! ;-) Maybe Black Sunshine???  >**If I ever need you, you will know. Heck, I need you now, but not like that :-) I need you in my arms. I need your eyes to look into.   *sigh*  I want that too, and just that.  I don't need anything else right now!  I know *exaclty* what you are saying!  **:-) Yep, we're going to have a lot of fun together for sure! And spend a lot of time in each other's arms!!!  >**And handling your thong isn't the same as getting in your pants..... but it could be!   It would be if I was *wearing* it, now wouldn't it???  **uhm.... I don't know...technically. Let's try it?  >**And I got tubular exhaust pipes, mufflers, axle shafts, cheater pipes, catalytic converters, and intermediate shafts. ;-)   Ooooh, Dennis!  Don't stop!  **How about camshafts, pushrods, lifters, driveshafts, output shafts, and shift rods?  >**I know you are changing more than your lifestyle right now. This will be a big change for me too. I've never had someone to care about like this before. Someone to be with. Someone to love like this. Someone to think about a future with.   Well, I will help where I can.  I don't want to sway you - sometimes I think I must have made you into the person you are somehow - maybe it's all a digital illusion.  But then I see you in the real world, and you're the same.  I remember when we first started talking, and I know that you were pressing buttons from day one.  You have to be real - it's really you - why on earth would someone fake this much for me?  Why on earth would you even begin to consider the things you've said to me if you weren't 100% real?  **Thanks for the offer to help ;-) I think the best thing you can do to help is just be you :-) And be understanding while I adjust :-)  **Yep, I'm real. What do you mean by pressing buttons?  LOL - well, living with someone is like living with your parents.    **OH NO! NOT THAT!!!! ANYTHING BUT THAT!!! :-O LOL!  You have to respect them, but there are times when you feel like getting away, taking a trip, hanging out with your buddies, whatever.  Sometimes you do nothing, sometimes you fight, sometimes you bonk heads while you're both trying to brush your teeth at the same time :-D  It's a lot of time to spend with one person - it can get intense.  Intense in all ways.  Meh, but I'm easy - treat me good and I'll treat you good.  That's about all there is to getting along with me :)  **I understand what you are saying. You aren't really telling me  anything that I didn't already sort of know, I do live at home you know ;-) Maybe before too long we'll get to find out what living with each other is like for real? I mean PLAY house, not jump all the way into it... like I said on the phone.  >**Yes, I do CARE about you, all of you, what's in your head, what's in your heart, all of you. Every aspect. YOU as a whole.   Thanks.  Thank you.  Thank you thank you thank you!  You have no idea how nice that feels!  **:-) No problem :-) I'm glad to make you feel good!  >**LOL! Finally, I get to take your virginity at SOMETHING, lol!   You can have all of the other kinds I have left too ;)  You got my drag racing virginity already.  And I want your rollercoaster virginity such as it is...  **;-) You will get my roller coaster virginity soon enough ;-)   **And there's always your "uncut" virginity for me to take :-D  >**The longer I wait to do something, the more worked up I get about it. After we kiss the first time, I'll be fine, lol. I'm just silly like that!  I'll all about making big deals out of nothing ;)  Doh - I mean I *posted* on OT when something was bothering me :o :o :o :o   OMG - I am still affected by telling you that :o  I'm a dork!  I can't believe you got that out of me!  **I guess I really don't need to say much about kissing now, other than I need to devolp more skills at it! What you've got out of me is all that I know, lol. Hmm... I've read a bunch of things about how to have better sex but not one thing about developing my kissing skills! Maybe I'll change that...  This question will have answered itself within 36 hours.  **It did :-D  A peck never hurt anything, BTW, if you feel that would be easier.  Whatever - I'm easy, like I've said.  **Well, that's how I broke the ice... with a peck, sorta. Now I'm pretty comfy and would like to just sit and "practice" w/you, develop some new skeelz ;-) Do some REAL kissing :-D  >**YES!!! Honesty rawks! ;-) This fact alone increases our odds of relationship success by a power of 100. Seriously.   I know.  You have an idea, I'm sure, but you'll never truely understand what it means to me that you are honest with me.  Even at the risk of sounding bad.  I don't mind feeling sad if it is for a good reason.  I just don't do well with senseless pain - hurting someone just to hurt them.  I'd rather be told something when it is a tiny complication than have to hear it when it seems like the end of the world, ya know?  **I agree 100%. No argument from me.  >**I agree, as much as I want to be with you now, I want to be with you the RIGHT way even more. We are lucky and smart to have been good this long :-) You are worth waiting for too. Trust me. I can wait. Like I said, where else will I find someone like you that is so compatible with me? Just don't go gettin all friendsy on me while I'm waiting, OK? Don't worry that I will! I want to fuck you like I've never wanted to fuck someone before!!! You are better than porn, even better than my own imagination. You are super sexy. And I'm not kidding.    :o   I know you're not kidding.  I know it, but I still don't fully believe it.  No, that's not right either, I DO believe it.  I don't completely comprehend it!  *found the word I was searching for*   "I want to fuck you like I've never wanted to fuck someone before!!!"  -- you know, you can say that to me a million times if you want to.  Thank you!  It makes my eyes roll back reading that.  *whew*  :-D  Good greif I like you, and you do make it so very hard to be good.  That will still sound good after you've been fucking me for years and years.  If I can only keep you interested that long ;)  **Don't worry. I'll always tell you how I feel, and I'm sure I can come up with something more romantic than that by the time we're old :-D   You realize that we've gotten ourselves back to where we were quite a while back.  I think we *knew* this is where to stop for now.  We just had to feel it...  Thinking it wasn't enough.  Do you get that sense?  **Yes, I agree. We had to wait until we were acclimated(sp?) to the feelings that are so powerful to both of us.   Do you think the fact that you haven't been here before is an obstacle for us?  I mean if it sounds this good with an "unavailable" married woman, how much better would it be with someone else?  Someone who could be truely yours without the wait?  Someone with extra (more than any other human) baggage?  Someone unattached with no children?  Will you ever wonder?  **NO. I want you. I want ONLY you. I wouldn't trade you for anyone else. I've met so many women, but you're the only one that has tripped my trigger like this. How much do you think I had to like you originally to pursue you even though you were married, had a child, smoked, and live 80+ miles away? My feelings for you have only grown since I met you and got to know you better. Why would I risk losing someone like you for a chance at some bimbo?   OR   Damn you're lucky!  Maybe that's the way it is supposed to work out!  The first time you *really* feel it like that - cause you're careful with your feelings.  Maybe, if I would have been awake, I would have noticed - felt the zing the first time I saw you - whatever it was.  But I always miss it.  It didn't take long once I got to talking to you - it was a *powerful* zing!  **Yep. I can sum most people up in about 5min and know whether I want to know them well or not. By the end of the Dave/trans meeting you were stuck in my head, a small note on a stick pin that said "This woman is quite promising." THEN I found out you were married! ACK! Now what? Friends?.... and you know the whole story so why rehash yet again?   (someone has been thinking again!)   Guess what?  Regret is a waste of spirit.   Pretty good, huh?  Too bad it isn't mine.  I am sampling again :)  **Yes, regret is a waste of time. I don't regret anything I've done since I first met you. And I want to make damn sure I don't regret anything I do now!   I still have your IM from this morning open.  I like to keep them around to read over and over now.  I memorize everything you say to me anymore.  With my quasi-photographic memory ;)  **Like I said in real life, I keep your aims open too, and save the good ones when I remember :-) I don't so much memorize everything, but I do remember all of the important details :-)   I love you   **I love you TOO!     Guess what?  At some point, after the paperwork is all getting done and what not, I'm going to visit Mookie!  He lives in Philadelphia.  I've always wanted to see the big cities on the east coast.  He's going to show me all of the good historical stuff out there.  I'm a sucker for history.  And he's going to buy me a cheese steak - he claims to know where the best one in town can be found.  And if I'm super lucky, he's going to cook me dinner - gotta love those Italian guys ;)  (((for food, of course!)))  Oh, and I get to stick it in his butt!  Hehehehe!  That's a running joke of ours - he promised me his ass once, and I'm going to take him up on it ;)  (LOL, not, but you already know how I feel about that anyway.)  If he's super, super lucky, I might fix his POS Neon for him.  The best way I know how, the secret overnight transmission swap ;)  Er, wait, should I repaint it?  You know, Bright Jade is a super ghey color.  HAAAAAY, maybe you and Mookie should hook up, you fucking fags!  :p  Just remember, I called video!  And if I'm SUPER SUPER lucky, Don  will come up too - so I can finally get my fucking ride he promised me!  AND I can check out my second favorite Neon in the whole world :)  (er, I mean 3rd favorite, of course I love the ACR, cause you twiddled it!  I can't see that car without thinking of you...)  **Reading that paragraph makes me VERY happy :-) It lets me know that you are feeling happy and free. I like knowing I that played a part in helping you acheive your freedom and happiness. The last thing I want to do is take your freedom.   OMG, speaking of cars, you've got me checking out Acclaims now.  LOL the damn things are EVERYWHERE!!!!  And I notice every single one of 'em.  Gee, thanks :p  **You've got me checking out R/T's....especially red 2dr ones w/ill plates!    I think about you way too much, I think.  :)  **I know I think about you too much :-)   Well, my fingers are tired.   It took me more than 5 hours and 45 minutes to get through all of this - I had a few distractions along the way, and I read and reread it a lot more than I have been lately.  I'm feeling edit-y today :)  LOL - but I only fixed two things anyway.    **This is the 2nd time I've poured my heart out in this email and dammit I'm saving it this time!!!  My typing is starting to get very conversational with you and informal.  Hehe, cause you ain't perfect either :)  **Hey now! Make up your mind! Am I perfect or not??? ;-) :-D :-)   *HUG*  *****HUG******   I can't WAIT till tomorrow night.  I am going to give you the best hug evar...   LOL.  More OT speak.   **Yep, you did. You gave me LOTS of good hugs, and a couple of nice kisses :-)  **Talk to you tonight on AIM!  Dennis

      I had been honest with my husband.  It finally got to him enough to email Dennis about it.  I can't really say how I felt about it at the time.  I was selfish.  If you don't take a stand for yourself at times like these, you don't make it through; you don't make it out.  I did what I felt I had to do.  I never got to reply to this to Paul.  Dennis didn't want Paul to know I'd seen it.  Oh! did I ever have things to say about it!  I still do, with a few years' perspecitve on it now.  Hurting someone you love (or loved) is not easy.  I wish Paul could have told me he wanted to make me happy.  I never got that impression from him - NEVER.  I had come to believe that he truely wanted to make me miserable.  That's the way he acted - almost as long as we were together, except for the six months or so when we got on really well right around our wedding.  From:   Paul Yevcak   To:   spoolboy@autospeed.com Subject:   This is Paul!! Date:   Wed 07/10/02 09:10 AM      Hey Dennis,  Don't know if you're at work now, or at home.  Doesn't really matter though, I guess.  At any rate, I just wanted to get some stuff of my mind, and clear up a few things with you.  First, and most important, I'M NOT MAD AT YOU FOR ANY OF THIS.  Like I said yesterday, I like hanging out with you, talking to you, BS'ing with you; whatever the case may be.  I don't blame you for anything that's happened.  I'm sure that for you, as it is for me, parts of this situation are entirely too "weird".  I get upset when I see you and Shannon together, goofing off, or joking around.  NOT because it pisses me off, or that I think you guys are going to go around the corner and have sex or something.  But I see the way Shannon looks at you, and I see the smile on her face that never diminishes.  I hear the way she laughs with you.  That's what hurts most of the time.  It's  just another nail in the "Shannon and I aren't meant for each other" coffin.  I wanted to be the "Dennis", I wanted to be the one that can make her laugh, I wanted to be the one who can always put a smile on her face.  But in all honestly, I can't.  I have to literally WORK to accomplish those things. You do it with ease.  So yes, it gets uncomfortable, and it gets discouraging, and it hurts me to no end.  I'm the husband!!  I should be the one who makes her feel like that!!  But I'm not, and never will be.  As  I said, that is THE only reason I get quiet.  I feel like the 3rd wheel when the 3 of us are doing anything.  And I'm sure that you've noticed that same thing.  And I know this is NOT your fault by any means, that you never set out to do anything will ill intent.  And at home, I DO use you as an excuse often, or use you as a "stick" to poke at Shannon.  Deep down I know that's wrong, but a lot of times I'm just grasping at straws, so to speak.  I'll write more later, but I was in a 3-car accident this morning on my way to work, and I have another insurance company to call. But I just wanted to let you know that I DO NOT blame you for any of this. Not one part.  I'm just trying to figure out how to deal with it. Perhaps once Chris and I move it may be easier for me?  Not 100% sure.  But I'm envious, and jealous.  Shannon has never acted, around me, the way she acts around you.  And that's what hurts.  I never realize how bad it is until she's around someone else.  And at that point I realize, "Gosh, have I ever been dragging her down."  Anyway, I've said it before, and I DO mean when I say that you're a pretty cool guy.  I could hang out with you all the time and never get bored.  But right now, it's just kinda weird.  Hopefully though, when this is all said and done, we'll still come out friends in the end?  I'm shooting for that.  Gotta run.  Paul Yevcak  P.S.  I got that Blackdog fuel rail installed.  And I did it right!!  No leaks at all!!

That's what I want.  Ok?  You say things to me that indicate that you're ready, then you back off.  I'm doing the same thing, I suppose.  I'm ready now, not going to recant that.  You can only dance so long before your legs get tired :)   Dang, hehe, I wish I was even close to being awake :)  I'd be more understandable that way.   Sorry if I'm not being CLEAR.  I feel clear, but damn words...  You know.   Hehe, I'm laughing at myself, I'm a dork, a silly tired in love dork.  :-D   I can back off - give you time?  Is that what you want?  Or do you want me to work on convincing you?  I'm not sure how I'm supposed to be  - the only thing I'm going on here is feeling.  My brain is getting fried, now that I know what I want, I can't really fight anymore to try to get myself talked out of it.   I still want to do things RIGHT, Dennis, I never said I was willing to fuck it all up.  Ok?   I just feel very strongly that right may not mean waiting for ever?  It's also not pressuring you.  YOU need to tell me what YOU need - whatever you say is what I'll do.  I want you to be as comfortable as I am, to not be scared anymore.  I'll still wait, don't ever take it to mean that I won't.   Hehe, talk to me after I've slept for a few hours ;)   Ugh, maybe between these last two emails I've managed to make a lick of sense?  I hope so - I know what I mean anyway :)   STILL in love with you :)   Shannon   BTW - call me if you want to talk today - or don't if you want time to think about stuff... whatever, I'm easy :)  And don't feel like you have to stay up all night chatting with me - I can't help but feel like a loser with a shitty job sometimes.  (Uh, cause I have a shitty job???)  Let me know if you still want to hang out Saturday - I'm thinking I'd love to catch a movie with you...

I still mean it, I'm still in 100% - come what may, when it may, as it wishes - whatever.   I don't know what to say to you - so much of me wants to convince you, but that's wrong.  So I'm a little stuck...  I don't want to back down either, I won't change my mind about you.     I'm just done being scared.   I feel like I faught the good fight, did everything I could and I *still* love you more than I've ever loved anyone, anything ever.  And I know you love me too.   I wish I could give you my not-scared brain for a day :)   When you're ready, let me know...  I'm waiting, I'll wait as long as you need me too, until you're ok with everything.  I'd never, ever, ever want to force anything on you.  I don't mean I'm ready to do anything wrong.  I'm just ready to be yours.   I'm IN, Dennis, as of this moment, for good.  You've got me.   Call me, IM me, email me, whatever - when you're ready - before you're ready - as soon as possible - whatever.  :)  I'm yours.  I love you.

It has been a slow night tonight ;-) I work from 3-11:30.   **I'm adding this paragraph last before I send this. I was really  reluctant to send this. I'm opening up my armor to you big time here. A part of me was concerned that this email would get kept, dwelled on, and possibly used against me or Shannon. Please respect what I've done here and don't do that. It will not be for the good of anyone involved if you do that.  @@I fully realize that.  And I give you my word, no bull-shitting that I will NOT be printing these, saving these, or dwelling on these e-mails.  I am also opening up, and discussing things with you that would cut me to the bone.  I know that you won't use any of this against me, and rest assured that I have ABSOLUTELY NO intentions of doing that to you, either.  **Yeah, I like hanging with you too Paul :-) This *IS* very weird, especially since the 4th of July.... I felt very bad for you that night. I have tried very hard to think of you, to put myself in your shoes, and treat you how I'd want to be treated if I was in your place. It is very hard as it is. I don't want to make this any harder than it has to be for anyone. I WILL NOT disrespect you or your marriage by doing things with your wife that I shouldn't do.  @@I've known for some time know that you never actually WOULD do  anything that you shouldn't do; but I will admit, there are many times that I have to remind myself of that.  I'm still working through all of my feelings about all of this, and there is SO much going through my head that sometimes I just can't keep it all straight.  I REALLY hit rock bottom Sunday night; and Monday morning I took it upon myself to contact my friend Cindy.  She  used to work here at SSI, and Shannon may have mentioned her already.  This past Saturday and Sunday, I didn't eat much.  I had a bowl of oatmeal on Sunday, and that was it if I recall.  Still, I wasn't eating, I literally got sick twice Sunday night, and spent at least 45 minutes literally crying my eyes out.  I knew then and there, that I would NOT make it through this without having at least one person to talk to.  Cindy was the only one.  During her time here at SSI, I helped her through some incredibly traumatic things in her life.  Sometimes I was an open ear; sometimes I was a "shoulder to cry on"; and yet other times, I was just a wall for her to bounce ideas off of, for the sole purpose of letting her maintain her sanity, and reassuring her that she WAS NOT crazy for thinking the things she was thinking.  And I can tell you right now that it feels so very good to have someone to talk to.  My apetite has come back, my stomach aches are gone, and so are my headaches. So now Cindy and I have switched places.  I'm the one in dire need of help, and she's taken the role I once had. And I know that you didn't come in and steal anything from me.  I've been pushing Shannon away for so long...again, I DO NOT BLAME you.  And I mean that.  **I know. And I have tried to avoid putting you in that situation. I hope you can see that I have. Sometimes though, it just seems like I'm trying to stop a train by holding it with my bare hands. If there is anything I can do to minimize your pain, I will do my best to do it. If you don't want me to be with Shannon until the divorce is final, I will do it at your request, out of respect for you. But it won't be without dificulty. She and I have become very close friends and I want to be there for her to talk to and be there to support her through this rough time. And I also want to be with her because I genuinely enjoy her company very much.  @@I competely understand what you're saying.  And yes, I HAVE noticed you trying to stop the train.  Or at least get it to slow down some.  But as it is in real life, it's DAMN hard to stop a train.  I'm still not 100% sure about how I feel about you guys going out to eat, and to a movie and such.  I honestly don't know about that.  I guess it wouldn't be so hard if it wasn't every weekend and such??  I need help getting the house ready to sell.  I MUST have help with all of that.    **As I've said elsewhere in this email, I respect you and your marriage and will not do anything with Shannon that I shouldn't do with a friend's wife. I hope you can see that from the times you've been around.  @@Yes, I understand.  And honestly, I DO believe you.  BUT it's taking a long time for me to get used to that.  Deep down I know that you mean it; but for some reason, it's just not soaking in as fast as other things do. My apologies.  **I don't want you to be hurt Paul. I don't want to hurt you.  @@And likewise.  I know that I've said things to Shannon that I don't mean, or that I wish I could retract.  Again, there are so many thoughts running through my head that occasionally I have mental traffic jam, and end up saying things I don't mean.  **I do know where you're coming from, if not exactly. I spent 4 years loving a woman that, although she loved me back, did not love me as much or in the same way as I loved her. I wanted to be with her very badly, but no matter what I wanted, no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't make it work. It felt so right to me for so long.... but it just never was. I am still friends with her. I have had the experience of seeing her with several men since I've known her. Even had to endure her confessions and stories of her love and sex life. Talk about pain! I've been over her for about 3-4 years, but it still hurts to hear her talk about being with someone else.   @@EXACTLY!!!!!  That's EXACTLY what I'm feeling!!  And don't ask me how to explain that!  ;)  **I don't think you ever truly stop loving someone once you start, you only learn how to deal with it and understand that concentrating on the pain only makes it worse.   @@And unfortunately, I'm not dealing with it too well yet, am I??  Takes time I guess....  >You do it with ease.  So yes, it gets uncomfortable, and it gets discouraging, and it hurts me to no end.  I'm the husband!!  I should be the one who makes her feel like that!!    **I'm sorry. I'm just me. I can't beleive Shannon feels like this about *ME*! I'm just a simple guy. I'm poor. Not that attractive. I live at home with my parents. I have a barely decent job and too many expensive hobbies that I've used to replace all the things that I've been missing in my life.   @@Trust me, I know EXACTLY what that's like.  I'm still, to this day,dealing with that.  What did she ever see in me??  I'm underweight (aka too damn skinny), I'm nothing to look at, and until recently, have never been good at any one thing in my life.  A few years back I found out that I had a nack for R/C stuff (radio-controlled), especially Nitro R/C (aka gas-powered).  That is THE ONE AND ONLY thing that I have EVER been good at. And that's really frickin' sad.  **I guarantee you I never expected that sending her an email would have resulted in this. All I ever wanted to do was find out more about a new club member and maybe make a new friend. But no matter how I tried to deny it, there was something growing in me every time we talked. A feeling that I tried to fight, tried to deny. But it was very strong, and it's even harder to fight something when someone else tells you that they're feeling the  same way.   @@Trust me, Dennis, I've been there before.  I'm 100% sure that you know about the whole Lauren thing.  I never ONCE thought that what happened would happen.  Make sense??  In a nutshell, the whole thing started out because I was helping her boyfriend Jason.  He and Lauren were having some probs, and he started confiding in me.  Eventually he asked that I begin to speak  with Lauren, and I told him that I'd be glad to do that, to get HER side of the story, so that I can continue on as a mediator.  Well as you just said, things started building up and up.  But enough of that; I'm trying to not talk about that whole situation anymore.  **Neither one of us initially wanted to be where we are now, but it just sort of happened along the way. And I'm just as much to blame as anyone in this situation, because had I not told Shannon the way that I felt...  Somtimes I think I'm just too honest.  @@I won't hear any of that.  You DID do the right thing by being honest.  **Thank you Paul, but I do feel like I am partly responsible for all of this. I have realized you feel bad in that way, and I've REALLY REALLY tried to minimize your exposure to these situations.   @@Duly noted.  And THANK YOU.  **I'm sorry to hear about that. When I spoke with Shannon, she said that you were OK, or I would be asking! Is the Concorde OK?  @@Yeah, believe it or not, I was spared from total destruction.  ;)  All I got was a group of scrapes and scuffs along the rear bumper cover...the body shop will more than likely just buff out.  If Chris wasn't in the car, I would have been hoping for something a bit worse...so that State Farm would total the car, pay me, I could pay the car off, and be done with it.  But that's neither here nor there.  ;)  Any urges for performance driving will be quickly sucked from your veins just as you place your butt in the driver's seat.  LOL!!!  **The things that you are saying are very rational and adult. I know how easy it is to say something and not mean it. Everything I've said and will say to you is the truth and 100% how I feel. I hope that what you are saying is what you are truly feeling.  @@I give you my word right now that I am being, and will continue to be, totally honest.  At this point, hiding anything I'm feeling, or masking anything as something else is going to serve no purpose.  I ask you for the same thing, and I already know that you'll be doing the same for me.    **I hope so. You are a very good and decent guy Paul. I hope that you can find happiness and love, you deserve it. If I honestly believed that I was preventing you and Shannon from being successful together, I'd leave right this second and not talk to her ever again.   @@Trust me, there is NOTHING that will make us successful together.  It just wasn't meant to be; we're polar opposites.  But I do feel somewhat relieved knowing that she can now be herself with and around you; and not have to try and conform to something that she's not; which is the case with me.  **I'm sorry that that is how it is. I really do feel for you. I don't think that you were dragging her down on purpose, but more that the situation was what was dragging her down. I'm sure you were not feeling great either if she felt like that. I hope you can be happier now that you are both going to be free of this.  @@I know for a fact that we'll both be happier.  I already have found quite a few NICE apartments and condos near work.  I will begin looking at those next week.  I'm very excited, and I literally can't wait.  Maybe I'll pick up a bigger TV?  Maybe I'll go through a "super-early mid-life crisis" and get that Corvette I've been looking at??  The possibilities are endless, and I cannot wait to begin exploring them all.  Yes, divorce in general just plain sucks; but this is the RIGHT thing.  I know it, and I can feel it. And I'm so excited about what the future holds that I literally get giddy like a child sometimes.   **Thank you. I'm certain that without these extraneous circumstances, we would be friends. Maybe not the closest friends, but friends for sure. I hope we can still be friends despite this situation.   @@That's one of my goals, Dennis.  We WILL come out of this as friends, and I'm determined as a mother f***** to make sure that becomes a reality.  **I feel like we have been friends until now, I do hope it continues.  @@I feel like we've been friend all along.  Yeah, it's weird right now, but that will pass with time.  I also hope it continues.  **Cool! Good job! How did you end up dealing with the fuel line and compression fitting?  @@Well, I ended up removing the coolant overflow bottle (and replacing that leaking POS with the new one).  Once the coolant bottle was out, I had access to the hard line with my pipe cutters.  I cut it about an 1.25 inches back from the bend, just where we were looking at it.  Any farther back, and the shape of the firewall would prevent me from making a full 360-degree loop with my pipe cutters.  All in all, not bad!!!  Got the fuel rail on, and at the same time, replaced that stoooopid coolant bottle!!

Silly me :)  It's going to be OK.  All of it.  This calm is not leaving me!  I read the email from Paul to you back to Paul again - thank you - gee, it sounds like you guys are about ready to smooch    I get pictures :-D  What you wrote back will help me out a lot.  You're outside, you're very intelligent, you're level-headed about all of this.  I know Paul needs someone to talk to.  I need someone to talk to too.  You're really helping out with everything.  I didn't plan on putting you in that situation.  You've got some kind of grace.  And I mean definitions #2 and #3:  2.  politeness:  dignified, polite, and decent behavior  She fended off queries with her usual grace.   3.  generosity of spirit:  a capacity to tolerate, accommodate, or forgive people  You've got it in great quantities.  I'm learning!  Will you teach me that?  Among the million other things I want to learn from you, can you slip that in somewhere along the line?  Please?  You never cease to amaze me!  I think I'm unserstanding something new!  "Growing old with someone" is about GROWING, not getting wrinkles...

      From:   "Shannon Yevcak"   To:   spoolboy@autospeed.com Subject:   I totally nailed 'em! Date:   Thu 07/11/02 06:19 AM      I just knocked out the 10 best radios of my life!  I totally rocked - I mean they were perfect!  Damn, and I didn't even think about saving the tapes...  Tapes?  Hehe, they're digital now anyway...  I though for sure that you'd have me all screwed up and my voice would waver / crack.  But no, not in the least!  I'm so fucking happy that it just shines through in my voice - the whole world is hearing me smiling :-D  You did this to me :-D  I thought they would suck big time this morning because I did them about 30 minutes after you went *poof*  I wasn't sure how I was feeling after that - I sorta 1/2 way freaked myself out for a little bit - about 10 minutes?  Sent you a little email right then, and yeah, I tried to call you :)  Hehe so sue me :p  But then this lovely calm feeling came over me - the same feeling I have when I'm in your arms.  I know you're coming back, I'm not scared anymore.  (Hehe, watch my karma - now that I'm sure you're coming back, I've scared you off for good!!!  :-D  )  You finally got through my thick head the last little bit.  I guess I let go of whatever I had keeping you out?  I don't know - I haven't cried for joy in a good long while, thanks for that!  Thank you a million times - I mean it from the bottom of my heart, the deepest part of my soul - just thank you!  Ok, so on to replying!  >**If you say you're sorry again I'm going to tickly you with a feather until you scream!!! :-D Especially if it's about something that you didn't cause!!!    I'm like that - it's another phrase I overuse.  I mean it lots of different ways, it's just something I say.  I'll work on quitting it, ok?  I don't always mean I'M SORRY...  like that.  Here, Encarta.com says:   1.  apologetic:  feeling or expressing regret for an action that has upset or inconvenienced somebody, or for a similar future action  2.  sympathetic:  feeling or expressing sympathy or empathy, especially because of something that has happened  I felt sorry it had to end that way.   3.  pitiful:  pitifully bad or neglected  4.  very bad:  pathetically or contemptibly unsatisfactory  a sorry excuse for a car   interjection   1.  apologizing for something:  used as an apology for hurting, interrupting, or inconveniencing somebody  Sorry - I didn't realize that was your foot.   2.  asking somebody to repeat something:  used with an interrogative inflection to ask somebody to repeat something (informal)   3.  correcting a remark:  used to introduce a correction in speech  The company employs ten thousand - sorry, twelve thousand workers nationwide.     See, it's a handy little word ;) AND if you keep threatening to tickle me, well, I may just say it on purpose ;)  >**Now, if you had a PLAN for us to get caught.... that's a different story....   Nope, was not planned at all.  But I'm glad it happened that way.  I wouldn't change any of this, I think we're going a great job with what we've been given, don't you?  >**Yes, I knew it was only a matter of time before we got "caught". I felt very strongly that today was the day, and that's why I didn't want to come out. But I figured that if we got caught, oh well, WTF... once I was there, my "fuck-it" attitude quickly retreated. I realized that Paul is a human being too. And how much it would hurt him to see us together. I'm just glad that he showed up right when I did, not after I'd been there a while. I know we'd have been together on the couch in one way or another... and that would have been VERY BAD for him to find us there. Even if all we were doing was laying there spooning....yeah, right....that's all we'd have been doing....:-/   It would have been about all that we would have been doing.  Or kissing.  Nothing **that** bad.  Sometimes it's actually easier to catch someone in the act.  When Paul and I were going through the Lauren stuff, I *wished* he would have fucked her.  Because I can compete with that - I know what I'm doing in that department.  I couldn't compete with her *love*.  That's how Paul is feeling about you, I'm certain.  And I've always known he's a human being - you have no idea the guilt I've carried around regarding him.  Thanks for being so smart...  I couldn't do this with a dummy!  I'd have gotten into a HUGE mess by now.  (uh, yeah, you know what I mean?  A huger mess!  A messier mess?  :-D )  >**What does wonkey feel like? :-)   Come feel me ;-D  >**:-D I understand. Beleive me, I wanted to be there. I will not go somewhere that I know I don't want to go.   I believe you!  I do I do I do!  Thanks for the support, how is it that you manage to be exactly what I need exactly when I need it?  I hope I'm as good for you as you are for me...  I want to be!  >**Remember that us fat guys don't look so hot all contorted up like those skinny fuckers do! ;-) And we're not as limber either!! But we snuggle and hug MUCH better!! And you can always use a fat guy to stop a car with if you're downtown together ;-)   You're silly.  I don't care what you look like.  I done told you - I actually *really* like you the way you are!  To OT on you, you're solid :)  It's fucking cool!  I could play with ya (um?  yeah, that's not Freudian!) for hours - just seeing if I could tip you over...  Hehe, I'm going to make myself blush, but it's kinda nice to, uh, know a guy is there...  uh, yeah...  LOL  :o  Haha, hahahahaha!  I MEAN to say that I remember when I made the switch from Ray to Jimmy, I was like, where's the beef :-D  OMG, I just giggled at work, and they're asking me what's so funny!  :o :o :o  *exposed!*  >**I am trying to find a reason why I should use the brakes.... I know the thing you said about Chris is a good reason.... but Paul already thinks we're fucking.... and it's so easy to "give them something to talk about".   We're going to be just fine.  No more self-doubt.  No more questioning you.  We seem to be getting what we need when we need it, when we get to a *stuck* place - life drops the answer in our laps.  >**Well, if being physically naked in front of me is not an issue....;-)   It's not - come see - you owe me a tickle anyway.  I'm not perfect, I can tell you that.  But I'm ok...  I feel good enough for you.  Which is NOT to diminish you at all - I feel like we were made for each other in some way.  I never really felt happy with me - like I wasn't good enough.  Jim tried once or twice to let me know I was - he really thought I was hot, but I wasn't quite able to accept it from him.  Hehe, and I had a better body back then too, dammit :)  But you make me feel "perfect."  I could get way used to this :-D  >**And I find it very entertaining that I bring out your "girly" side, lol. I figured all of the talk about cars and stuff like that would stimulate your "male" side, lol! But I guess we do talk more about sex and romantic things than cars anymore... and I think I like your girly side :-) But I like the other side of you too! Hmm... don't think to hard about that.... there's a dirty joke there somewhere! ;-)   Hehe, that's cool ;)  We still have a whole lot of car talk to do - and I'm not about to give up on the cars!  I'll always be your "car chick" ;)  Like I said, I'll be glad to wrench with you anytime, as long as you promise to clean up with me afterwards ;)  Just let me be me...  (uh, that's Eminem again, isn't it :x )  >**YES. I still say YES. Yeah, you SO tried to convince me otherwise, but all you really convinced me of was that you cared about me enough to discourage me, which made me want you even more. Plus there's my "prove you wrong" and "argue" side that you stimulated by telling me that I didn't want to say yes...   I know :)  I'm happy it's worked out this way so far :)  HAPPY like you wouldn't believe!  That was the plan the whole way:  I'm going to act all shy and unsure and make Dennis fall for me...     >**You're not going to lose me. I'm here. Not going anywhere. What do I need to do to prove it? I would like to see you being independent a bit, but only just as badly as I want to be with you.   I know!  I finally know totally how YOU feel, and you can't hide it from me anymore :)  So stop trying!  Ok?  It's killing me, a little bit, to watch you struggling too.  But know that I'm with you.  I'm feeling the same things, different motivation for the feelings, but the same feelings.  And now that you've proven (later in this email) yourself, I am absolutely not scared one bit of losing you.  (hehe, except for you inexplicably leaving me this morning ;)  )  >**I'll help you. I will keep us going slow. I know I can, at least until I feel that it's right to speed up.   Yeah, I feel the same way - but trust me, when we're both ready to actually move on it, I don't think it will be slow anymore.  You know, Mopark was 9 1/2 weeks ago...  Hehe, 9 1/2 weeks...  LOL, well, I know what movie I'm watching after I wake up today.  You're not Mickey Rourke; I'm not Kim Basinger - it's good evidence of what NOT to do :-D  Uh, and then there's the sex ;)  Hehe, poor couch!  I digress...  WHEN we're both ready - and yes, I'm waiting - I'm not *ready* yet either, you know that - when we're both really ready it's going to be fast.  I'm not worried, as long as we stay honest and hang on until we're both *really* ready to let it go.  (Getting excited!!!)  >**Damn girly side! ;-) I'm not going to leave. I won't let you hurt me, I can only hurt myself. And I can't imagine anyone that I would be more satisfied with than you...unless maybe I met a woman with multiple vaginas?   You know what, I learned (relearned, actually) that snakes have penii :)  Hehe, just a random thought that you made pop into my head :)  *pop*  >**You're not a loser. This is still so new and I worry about losing you too. I know you're real tho. I have accepted it. I guess it's easier for me because I was the pursuer, not the one being pursued from the begining.  Are you SURE about that?  Who said the word "crush" first?  Huh?  We are both guilty as charged.  I'm not about to go claiming innocence!  "Ooooh, I was poor little married me, just going to Travis's house to hang out with the Neon dudes, when this horrible ogre started making passes at me!!!"  Yeah, whatever!  I'm every bit as responsible as you are, buddy :p  >** There, you happy now?! lol! :-D If you'd just look into my damn eyes you'll see your security blanket! I'm goofy, silly, stupid in love with you. How could I not be and be acting like this? I've never felt like this before. You make me deleriously happy just by being in the same area as me!!! What do you need??? I'd do anything for you, except hurt you, lie to you, or something that would jeopardize our future together.   YES!  I'm happy!  Blissfully happy!  I'm goofy silly stupid in love with you too, and I LOVE it :-D  You're turning me into things I never thought I'd be.  I didn't know I was this fucking sunny and perky and *happy* - I didn't ever feel like much of an optimist.  You're challenging me, don't stop.  Don't ever stop :-D  >**Thank you so much for telling him. He knew it already and lying to him would only make things worse. How long could we keep up the lie anyway?   We couldn't.  I had already told him a lot anyway.  He'd seen a lot more.  I am still having a hard time with some parts of the email he sent to you.  *sigh*  I mean him no harm.  Not anymore, not ever again.  It wouldn't be *right* to lie about it - besides, it's not like I can deny it anyway!  >**I ask myself that all the time. What makes Shannon love me so much? What makes me love her so much? I have no answer really, other than "I just do". There are a thousand good reasons why I love you, like the fact that you're loving, kind, smart, caring, sexy, beautiful, and about 10000x more stuff that my fingers are saving themselves from typing.   Thanks :-D  I like it when you say nice things to me.  It just sounds so good!  What makes me love you so much?  Hahaha, well, you do, silly!  You're kind and loving and honest and brave and smart and you do cute things and you turn me on like crazy and you're a little bit shy and insecure which makes me want to take care of you and you're funny and you're silly and you're "solid" and you're cuddly and you're just everything I've ever thought might make another person *good* Ok?  You're stubborn enough to handle me, you're naughty like me, you're always questioning things.  You're a little bit contrary, and I like that a lot.  You won't let me get away with shit, and at the same time you're supportive.  Just amazing!  Just exactly how I'd make you up, if I could have.  But I didn't have to, cause you're real!  I'm lucky as hell!  Oh, yeah, and it's ok with you if I get lazy and don't use as many commas as I should ;)  >I won't ever change my mind, Dennis. You are worth it. All of it. In the grand scheme of things, when I weigh what I have to look forward to with what I have to do to get there - it seems way too easy, belive it or not. As hard as each step seems, I know that it's bringing me one step closer...>**:-) I know you feel that way. Thank you for saying it! You are worth all of this too.   :-D  (sometimes there isn't anything left to do but smile like a dern fool)  >**I'm glad that you shared your feelings with me. Yes, I have been completely honest with you, and always will be. Everything is exactly as it seems, as long as you are reading the same emails I am, lol. Your girly side is being kind of troublesome! She has been kept in the closet for so long that she is running around screaming at the top of her lungs now that she's free! I understand and can deal with that, just please do your best to not let your neediness lead us down the wrong road.  I won't go down the wrong road.  I won't!  Nope, not me!  Not now!  I've got that girly shit under control now, I think I'm channeling it into sexual energy ;)  (uh, if that's ok with you?  Hehe)   >**I do sometimes have a hard time believing you are real too.   I'm real, 100% American made ME!  No fillers, no artificial colors or flavors...  >**I want to be with you, very badly. Cuddling with you and talking sounds absolutely great right now! I don't know how long the paperwork will take for your divorce, but until then it looks like we will not be seeing each other in person :-( I can do it. I will not gamble with Chris. We've done pretty well on just AIM and emails so far, and only recently have we been able to BE together in real life. I think we can make it :-) We have to! :-)   Yep :-D  We can do it, I know we can.  But we may not have to, depending on how long it takes Paul to realize what's up and let me see you without holding Chris over my head.  Either way.  Ya know?  >**You should tell Paul "thank you" for making us take some time apart in real life right now. Tell him that you are glad and that you beleive it will increase the odds of you and I being together. If anything will make him not care if you are with me, that will do it. Gotta love reverse psychology! lol   Hehe, you're BAD!  Actually, it may be good for us anyway, so if that is the way it shakes out, I'm not going to fight it.  Everything has worked out so well from a "random shit" aspect, I'm kinda thinking of just riding it out.  But then again, if he's going to let me see you, I'll do it.  Respectfully of course, I'll get home on time and everything, just like Daddy tells me to :)  *rolls eyes*  And you think you've got troubles living with your parents...  >**When I asked you these same questions only days ago, you had no answers for me other than "I can't see the future". What makes you think I can now? I really don't know. I want to be with you. I want to make this work with you in the best way I know how, but you have to understand my lack of experience and how much I'm growing right now to even meet you here. I do respect how far you've come for me!!! And I will go as far as you want me to(because I want to!), but I have to do it slowly. I've never even dated someone, let alone tried to live with them, or give all of myself to them.  That's fine, I do have a pretty good idea of where this is going, but I'm not going to PUSH you to get there.  I appreciate your honesty.  I respect your boundaries.  I'm cool.  I've grown a lot too, don't think you're experiencing any of this on your own, ok?  I've done things I never thought I could.  >**Yes, dating. I want to do a whole lot of that! Do you realize that if I'm dating you, you are the first person I've ever really dated?  :-D  That is so fucking cool, I don't even know what to say!  (sometimes there's nothing left to do but smile like a fool!)   >**Last night I stopped for coffee at the gas station on my way home. The guy at the register asked me what I was doing drinking coffee this time of night, was I going on a road trip, etc. I replied that my girlfriend was at work tonight and I wanted to stay up so I could talk to her, so I needed some caffeine. You know what? That is the first time I've ever been able to refer to someone as my girlfriend.   I love you!  I want to kiss you and hold you and be with you for shit like that!  I feel it is supremely unfair not to be able to share things like that with you.  I'm so flattered I think I'm going to have some kind of attack now :)  Hehe, you sure do make me smile.  I'm going to have wrinkles from you, dammit!  >**Do you understand what I'm saying here? Do you get any idea of why I have to take this slow yet? I've never had anyone before that I could call mine. Never. I don't know how to do this. I'm doing good so far, but I need to learn 1 thing at a time.  Awwww, :-D  Yes, I understand.  I love you anyway, I love you because of it.  Thank you - this is some of the first *real* insecurity you've shared with me - I mean that way deep stuff...  You don't even know how much I want to kiss you and tell you it'll all be ok :)  Dennis, I will do everything in my power to make everything right for you.  You deserve it!  :-D  >**Please just go slow with me. I KNOW I can't go fast now. I understand that you do want someone to be with, and that you are used to having someone in your life. I am not used to it, although I want you in my life very badly!   I'm scared too - we're coming at this from different angles.  That's all.  I'm just as insecure as you are.  I want you too!  A little 0:-)  I'm used to having the wrong person in my life and being lazy with my relationship and doing a lot of mutual hurting.  I'm worried that the patterns are going to stick around.  I need to fix that about me.  I'll do it.  You make it easy anyway, I can't be mean to you, I can't hurt you.  >**In the past I have filled my life with so many hobbies to fill the time most people spend with their b/f or g/f or even the time spent with their friends. And now, I've grown used to these hobbies, and giving them up is hard to do. I realize that I will simply not have enough money to play like I do if I move out of my parent's house. I will do these things to be with you. I care about you that much. These things are fairly minor by themselves, but they all add up. I'm spoiled, please try to understand me.   I'm spoiled too, believe me.  But in a totally different way.  Things are just things - stuff is just stuff.  That comes and goes.  You're not supposed to start your life out with a lot of money anyway.  That's the way it goes.  I'm not worried about that at all, I'm already living on less money than I need, I'm good at penny pinching.  Yet I still manage to put new stuff on the Neon once in a while, don't I?  >**Back around my birthday Karla, Koby and I were talking and discussing old times. We realized that right now is the happiest we've ever been. None of us has ever been very happy before in our lives. Never felt free or comfortable with ourselves until just recently. I am so free and can do whatever I want, whenever I want. That is very hard to loose, but you are worth it! Just understand that I need to leave my freedom slowly, not overnight. Simply moving out will be a VERY big step for me that I've been putting off for so many years because I'm spoiled.   I hope you realize that I don't want your freedom?  Not really.  I want you with me, but that does NOT mean you lose the rest of your life!  As long as you come back eventually, you're free to come and go...  I've never tried to be a ball and chain, don't care for that role.  I'm not like other women, so living with me is not like all of the cliche jokes you always hear.  I need my own shit, ya know, my own freedom, my own friends, all of that good stuff!  >**I'm trying, but you aren't making it easy lately ;-) Your girly side is surprising me with her neediness too. I've been thinking hard all day today. I've been in a rather "outside of the situation" state of mind. Kind of sad. Sad because when I look at it that way, I can really see all of the ways that things could go bad. I can always see them, but when I can get up the nerve to step outside, I can REALLY SEE THEM. I'm picking the road for us that I see the least obstacles on. Please go down it with me. Eventhough it's longer than the dangerous road, it is MUCH safer for both of us in the long run. 1 wreck on the short dangerous road will take us out of the race for MUCH longer(if not completely) than if we just keep a steady pace on this long safe road.  Girly side in check.  Until you're ready for it, some day you'll have to face it head on, but I'm good for now.  It's an adjustment for me.  I'm growing and changing and learning and everything that you're doing.  I'm thinking.  I'm WITH you :-D  This is definately a journey, and yes, I'll go with you, and let's agree to pick the path together?  I can't stop fucking smiling!  I'm so happy!  :-D  :-D  :-D  :-D  Hehe!  Have a good day, maybe sometime I'll find out why you disappeared???   Take care,   Shannon   BTW, I'm trying to scale back the drama big time.  It's silly - I like it to a point, but I'm going to make a concerted effort to be more level-headed with you.  I can't give you courage if I'm always freaking out, can I?  ;)   Want to kiss you a lot today!

      This is Dennis's reply to Paul's email from the day before:  From:   dennis   To:   marfells@hotmail.com Subject:   This is Dennis Date:   Thu 07/11/02 02:24 AM       >Hey Dennis,  >Don't know if you're at work now, or at home.  Doesn't really matter though, I guess.    **I was at home when I got this this morning, but didn't have time to give you a quality reply until tonight at work. It has been a slow night tonight ;-) I work from 3-11:30.  **Thank you for contacting me.  >At any rate, I just wanted to get some stuff of my mind, and clear up a few things with you.  First, and most important, I'M NOT MAD AT YOU FOR ANY OF THIS.  Like I said yesterday, I like hanging out with you, talking to you, BS'ing with you; whatever the case may be.  I don't blame you for anything that's happened.  I'm sure that for you, as it is for me, parts of this situation are entirely too "weird".  **Yeah, I like hanging with you too Paul :-) This *IS* very weird, especially since the 4th of July.... I felt very bad for you that night. I have tried very hard to think of you, to put myself in your shoes, and treat you how I'd want to be treated if I was in your place. It is very hard as it is. I don't want to make this any harder than it has to be for anyone. I WILL NOT disrespect you or your marriage by doing things with your wife that I shouldn't do. I'm very glad that you are handling this situation in this intelligent and adult manner. I understand how easy it is to hate someone like me. Even though I didn't come in and steal anything from you, it would sure be easy to blame me  for doing just that. I really respect you, and have respected you since I learned so much about you through Shannon. I really respect the fact that you've taken care of her and your son all of this time. There are not many people that would have done that. Thank you for not blaming me. I really do beleive that we can be friends through all of this and even afterwards, however things may turn out in the end.   >I get upset when I see you and Shannon together, goofing off, or joking around.  NOT because it pisses me off, or that I think you guys are going to go around the corner and have sex or something.  But I see the way Shannon looks at you, and I see the smile on her face that never diminishes.  I hear the way she laughs with you.  That's what hurts most of the time.  **I know. And I have tried to avoid putting you in that situation. I hope you can see that I have. Sometimes though, it just seems like I'm trying to stop a train by holding it with my bare hands. If there is anything I can do to minimize your pain, I will do my best to do it. If you don't want me to be with Shannon until the divorce is final, I will do it at your request, out of respect for you.  **I don't want you to be hurt Paul. I don't want to hurt you.  >It's just another nail in the "Shannon and I aren't meant for each other" coffin.  I wanted to be the "Dennis", I wanted to be the one that can make her laugh, I wanted to be the one who can always put a smile on her face.  But in all honestly, I can't.  I have to literally WORK to accomplish those things.  **I do know where you're coming from, if not exactly. I spent 4 years loving a woman that, although she loved me back, did not love me as much or in the same way as I loved her. I wanted to be with her very badly, but no matter what I wanted, no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't make it work. It felt so right to me for so long.... but it just never was. I am still friends with her. I have had the experience of seeing her with several men since I've known her. Even had to endure her confessions and stories of her love and sex life. Talk about pain! I've been over her for about 3-4 years, but it still hurts to hear her talk  about being with someone else. I don't think you ever truly stop loving someone once you start, you only learn how to deal with it and understand that concentrating on the pain only makes it worse.   >You do it with ease.  So yes, it gets uncomfortable, and it gets discouraging, and it hurts me to no end.  I'm the husband!!  I should be the one who makes her feel like that!!    **I'm sorry. I'm just me. I can't beleive Shannon feels like this about *ME*! I'm just a simple guy. I'm poor. Not that attractive. I live at home with my parents. I have a barely decent job and too many expensive hobbies that I've used to replace all the things that I've been missing in my life. I guarantee you I never expected that sending her an email would have resulted in this. All I ever wanted to do was find out more about a new club member and maybe make a new friend. But no matter how I tried to deny it, there was something growing in me every time we talked. A feeling that I tried to fight, tried to deny. But it was very  strong, and it's even harder to fight something when someone else tells you that they're feeling the same way. Neither one of us initially wanted to be where we are now, but it just sort of happened along the way. And I'm just as much to blame as anyone in this situation, because had I not told Shannon the way that I felt.... Somtimes I think I'm just too honest.  >But I'm not, and never will be.  As I said, that is THE only reason I get quiet.  I feel like the 3rd wheel when the 3 of us are doing anything.  And I'm sure that you've noticed that same thing.  >And I know this is NOT your fault by any means, that you never set out to do anything will ill intent.    **Thank you Paul, but I do feel like I am partly responsible for all of this. I have realized you feel bad in that way, and I've REALLY REALLY tried to minimize your exposure to these situations.   >And at home, I DO use you as an excuse often, or use you as a "stick" to poke at Shannon.  Deep down I know that's wrong, but a lot of times I'm just grasping at straws, so to speak.  **I understand. I know how easy it is to do things that are wrong. We are simply humans. We are weak and often driven by our emotions.  >I'll write more later, but I was in a 3-car accident this morning on my way to work, and I have another insurance company to call.  **I'm sorry to hear about that. When I spoke with Shannon, she said that you were OK, or I would be asking! Is the Concorde OK?  >But I just wanted to let you know that I DO NOT blame you for any of this. Not one part.  I'm just trying to figure out how to deal with it.  **The things that you are saying are very rational and adult. I know how easy it is to say something and not mean it. Everything I've said and will say to you is the truth and 100% how I feel. I hope that what you are saying is what you are truly feeling.  **I also know how things change. You could be fine right now, but not so fine later or yesterday. Emotions seem to come in waves. And it's so easy to justify an action with an emotion.  >Perhaps once Chris and I move it may be easier for me?  Not 100% sure.  **I hope so. You are a very good and decent guy Paul. I hope that you can find happiness and love, you deserve it. If I honestly believed that I was preventing you and Shannon from being successful together, I'd leave right this second and not talk to her ever again.   >But I'm envious, and jealous.  Shannon has never acted, around me, the way she acts around you.  And that's what hurts.  I never realize how bad it is until she's around someone else.  And at that point I realize, "Gosh, have I ever been dragging her down."  **I'm sorry that that is how it is. I really do feel for you. I don't think that you were dragging her down on purpose, but more that the situation was what was dragging her down. I'm sure you were not feeling great either if she felt like that. I hope you can be happier now that you are free.  >Anyway, I've said it before, and I DO mean when I say that you're a pretty cool guy.  I could hang out with you all the time and never get bored.    **Thank you. I'm certain that without these extraneous circumstances, we would be friends. Maybe not the closest friends, but friends for sure. I hope we can still be friends despite this situation. I feel like we have been friends until now, I do hope it continues.  >But right now, it's just kinda weird.  Hopefully though, when this is all said and done, we'll still come out friends in the end?  I'm shooting for that.  **I am too! By not being cool about this, we would only be making things harder and more complicated for everyone involved.   >P.S.  I got that Blackdog fuel rail installed.  And I did it right!!  No leaks at all!!  **Cool! Good job! How did you end up dealing with the fuel line and compression fitting?  Dennis

      From:   dennis   To:   marfells@hotmail.com Subject:   Today, Paul, etc. Date:   Thu 07/11/02 12:48 AM      Awww, man, no email from Dennis :(   Waaaait, yes there is!   And it's about trench mouth!     Great!   :)  **LOL! You would have had that last email already, but it got lost on the first attempt! DOH! The trenchmouth thing was a copy/paste of a fwd that I got from someone. I thought it was kind of interesting.    I feel bad right now.   Really really bad.   Dang it, I'm sorry 1000 times over.  **If you say you're sorry again I'm going to tickly you with a feather until you scream!!! :-D Especially if it's about something that you didn't cause!!!  **Now, if you had a PLAN for us to get caught.... that's a different story....   I suppose Paul had to come home, had to force the issue, don't think he knew at the time, but someone (something) sent him, I'm sure of it.  **Yes, I knew it was only a matter of time before we got "caught". I felt very strongly that today was the day, and that's why I didn't want to come out. But I figured that if we got caught, oh well, WTF... once I was there, my "fuck-it" attitude quickly retreated. I realized that Paul is a human being too. And how much it would hurt him to see us together. I'm just glad that he showed up right when I did, not after I'd been there a while. I know we'd have been together on the couch in one  way or another... and that would have been VERY BAD for him to find us there. Even if all we were doing was laying there spooning....yeah, right....that's all we'd have been doing....:-/   Now I'm feeling all wonkey.  **What does wonkey feel like? :-)   I don't ever want to put you into uncomfortable positions (unless we're naked, or course...)     **:-D I understand. Beleive me, I wanted to be there. I will not go somewhere that I know I don't want to go.   **And what kind of uncomfortable position would you like to put me into naked? Remember that us fat guys don't look so hot all contorted up like those skinny fuckers do! ;-) And we're not as limber either!! But we snuggle and hug MUCH better!! And you can always use a fat guy to stop a car with if you're downtown together ;-)   I am really really trying to find the brakes that worked so well about 10 days ago.  They're not working so much for me anymore, DAMMIT!  I see what I want, I can touch it, taste it, smell it, hold it in my hands.  So fucking close!!!    **I am trying to find a reason why I should use the brakes.... I know the thing you said about Chris is a good reason.... but Paul already thinks we're fucking.... and it's so easy to "give them something to talk about".  And I'm finding that this "girly" part of me you bring out (you know, being physically naked in front of you is not an issue, because I feel naked around you anyway!) is not such a strong person.  This girly part of me is even more impulsive than what I'm used to!  You don't know how long I've waited, how many nights I've dreamed --- yes, yes you do know -- you've been there too.  When I close my eyes, it's to fight off the girly needy part - the part that just can't wait.  To force myself to take it for what it is, to take what I'm getting and be damn grateful  for it.  (It's not bad - I'm not complaining!!!)  **Well, if being physically naked in front of me is not an issue....;-)  **And I find it very entertaining that I bring out your "girly" side, lol. I figured all of the talk about cars and stuff like that would stimulate your "male" side, lol! But I guess we do talk more about sex and romantic things than cars anymore... and I think I like your girly side :-) But I like the other side of you too! Hmm... don't think to hard about that.... there's a dirty joke there somewhere! ;-)   *sigh*   I told you once you said YES you were saying YES, didn't I?  I tried like hell to convince you otherwise.  **YES. I still say YES. Yeah, you SO tried to convince me otherwise, but all you really convinced me of was that you cared about me enough to discourage me, which made me want you even more. Plus there's my "prove you wrong" and "argue" side that you stimulated by telling me that I didn't want to say yes...   I guess this feeling is what I was worried about - now that I'm standing here all alone...  I feel super exposed - and I'm terrified that I'm going to lose you!  **You're not going to loose me. I'm here. Not going anywhere. What do I need to do to prove it? I would like to see you being independent a bit, but only just as badly as I want to be with you.   Damn, I want to rush things.   I have to work.  This is some of the hardest work I've ever had to do.  **I'll help you. I will keep us going slow. I know I can, at least until I feel that it's right to speed up.   The consequences scare me --- and the scariest ones all have to do with YOU!  You leaving, you getting hurt, you not being satisfied - GAH!  It's girl stuff!  **Damn girly side! ;-) I'm not going to leave. I won't let you hurt me, I can only hurt myself. And I can't imagine anyone that I would be more satisfied with than you...unless maybe I met a woman with multiple vaginas?   God, are you still sure?    **YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I want to know, I know I'm a loser for asking!    **You're not a loser. This is still so new and I worry about losing you too. I know you're real tho. I have accepted it. I guess it's easier for me because I was the pursuer, not the one being pursued from the begining.  Of course I know, but I've got such a track record of scaring people away...  Hence the lyrics to "Hurt" - everyone I know goes away in the end - I can't shake that last bit of insecurity.  Maybe that is a good thing, it's keeping me in line?  I'm not sure, maybe that insecurity is hiting me in the ass - that's what is causing me to want to rush rush rush - like I want to somehow find a way to pin you down or something???  No, not pin you down.  I just want some type of security blanket, I guess.  Some type of concrete evidence that you're not going to run away? And yet, if I look, it's all around me.  You've done everything but  hit me over the head to let me know how you feel.  And damn it all if there isn't a part of me that probably wouldn't get the message if you did hit me over the head.  I'm stubborn, did I bother to mention that?  :)  **  There, you happy now?! lol! :-D If you'd just look into my damn eyes you'll see your security blanket! I'm goofy, silly, stupid in love with you. How could I not be and be acting like this? I've never felt like this before. You make me deleriously happy just by being in the same area as me!!! What do you need??? I'd do anything for you, except hurt you, lie to you, or something that would jeopardize our future together.   I'm blabbing, I hope you see that I'm working things out in my head as I sit here and type - so if something sounds shocking at first, just hang on, I'm trying to get back to a comfortable place.  **Yes, I understand. NP! :-)    I was not ready to tell Paul everything yet.  But I guess I had to.    **Yes, I knew you weren't. Thank you so much for telling him. He knew it already and lying to him would only make things worse. How long could we keep up the lie anyway?  I wasn't going to do it - until I saw you, and pratically threw myself at you damn the consequences... Yes, I do like you that much!  How the hell did this happen again???    **I don't fucking know!! I ask myself that all the time. What makes Shannon love me so much? What makes me love her so much? I have no answer really, other than "I just do". There are a thousand good reasons why I love you, like the fact that you're loving, kind, smart, caring, sexy, beautiful, and about 10000x more stuff that my fingers are saving themselves from typing.  I saw that there was no way to hide it anymore, really no reason to do it anyway.  I've been honest with Paul all through this, when I told him that I loved you like a Kit (best friend love) I meant it, because that is where we were at that moment in time.  He thinks I'm changing my story - but I'm not - I have been honest with him.  I've basically told him everything now (excluding the cyber sex - hey, when are we doing that again???  I'm getting horny here!!!) and he's dealing.  I used one of your lines (thanks, check is in the mail) about feelings - you can't  control how you feel, only how you react to it.  **Thank you for being honest with him. It's really hard to use something against someone when you throw it in their face and they just say "Yeah, I know, I'm the one that told YOU."   He is mad - but I think he sees the way out...  I told him if I was that focused on Dennis, why didn't I run off with Dennis, sign all of my shit over and get it done with?  (Neglected to mention just how close to doing exactly that we came...)  I just told him that I am really intent on doing the right thing - which means I have to put my obligations to both he and Chris first.  (Get this!!!  He said, "Well, how do I know that you won't run off and fuck him?  You've lied about other stuff!"  So I had to say, "I could stand naked in front of Dennis and work it for all I was worth and he'd still tell me no!"  Uh, so if he asks, no  matter what might actually happen, you'd say no, ok???)  Haha, I had to tell him (was NOT ready for this!!!) that you are worth waiting for!  OMG - that was hard to say - the look in his eyes - gawd.  But I did it :-D  I can do anything as long as I know you're there for me.  Thank you thank you thank you!  **:-) I'm glad that you two are talking and dealing with this, not fighting. I'm very proud of you. And thank you so much for the flattery! I'm glad that I make you strong :-)    I won't ever change my mind, Dennis.  You are worth it.  All of it.  In the grand scheme of things, when I weigh what I have to look forward to with what I have to do to get there - it seems way too easy, belive it or not.  As hard as each step seems, I know that it's bringing me one step closer...  DAMN!  (shut up, silly impatient girly parts!!)  **:-) I know you feel that way. Thank you for saying it! You are worth all of this too.   Dennis, I love you.  I hope and pray that everything is as right as it all seems - I have nothing but good feelings about this - this being US.  I guess the hardest part was taking the first step.  (and still, there is nagging, I didn't know I was this needy - please just put up with the neediness - I've been waiting so long, and you are so incredibly perfect - I still have trouble believing you're real - except when you're holding me in your arms, then I know)  I'm so afraid of messing up!  I am afraid that telling you this is going to scare you away - let you see just how insecure and needy I am, and turn you off?  Geez, I'm a wreck!  Meh, it's only been about 90 minutes since I told my husband I'm in love with another man, I guess I deserve a little bit of this, don't I?  **I'm glad that you shared your feelings with me. Yes, I have been completely honest with you, and always will be. Everything is exactly as it seems, as long as you are reading the same emails I am, lol. Your girly side is being kind of troublesome! She has been kept in the closet for so long that she is running around screaming at the top of her lungs now that she's free! I understand and can deal with that, just please do your best to not let your neediness lead us down the wrong road.  **I do sometimes have a hard time believing you are real too. Today I was feeling that hard-core while I did my "serious thinking".  Yeah, I'm getting better at thinking while I type.  I won't be able to think without a keyboard if this keeps up!  **LOL! You are funny!   So, I really want to know some kind of a plan?  I don't mean we have to nail everything down exactly - it's just so damn hard to be "open ended" totally.  I'm going to move to Litchfield for at least a while.  Get the house ready to sell - there are a few things to fix up, a few things to clean, etc.  Get stuff sold / moved / divided / given away whatever.  I don't know how damn long it will take to sell the house - the market is supposed to be good right now...  Sometimes that shit drags on forever.  Get back to school - I start August 26th.  I guess I'll commute from Litchfield - yipee, what fun!  (I'll have timing belt mileage on the car in no time that way, Dennis :p )  I'm going to have to work sometime - which won't leave me a whole hell of a lot of time to study - damn this is going to be like work!  But Paul will have Chris, so I'll have to send him some money every month.    **A plan eh? Well, I've told you what I thought a good plan would be, but you really don't seem to want to hear it right now, lol :-) I move out and get an apartment. You visit me and stay with me progressively more, as much as I can stand, but you DO NOT move in with me, at least until you are out of school. That way I can have a chance to adjust from nothing to everything...know what I'm saying? After that, when you are making better money, we can move up in the world from an $11/hr standard of living.  I'll have a better explaination of my reasons for going slow in the next email. I'm trying to be breif so I can get through all  of these ;-) Plus I'm still grinding on Paul's reply... don't want to make a stupid mistake with him and create a chink in our armor.   I want to see you - be with you, catch a movie or whatever whenever we have the time together.  Just cuddle and tell you about the mundane aspects of my life, ya know.  Just listen to your voice - I love your voice :-D  Hopefully sometime during all of that, the paperwork will get finished?  I've not gotten a good answer yet for how long it takes.  :x  Stupid details!    **I want to be with you, very badly. Cuddling with you and talking sounds absolutely great right now! I don't know how long the paperwork will take for your divorce, but until then it looks like we will not be seeing each other in person :-( I can do it. I will not gamble with Chris. We've done pretty well on just AIM and emails so far, and only recently have we been able to BE together in real life. I think we can make it :-) We have to! :-)   **You should tell Paul "thank you" for making us take some time apart in real life right now. Tell him that you are glad and that you beleive it will increase the odds of you and I being together. If anything will make him not care if you are with me, that will do it. Gotta love reverse psychology! lol  Then what?  Dang it, I just want to know everything right now :)  Hehe, I'm a silly one, aren't I?  What are you thinking?  Where do you see us?  What's going to happen?  I know what I'd like, but I don't know where your head is on it.  I feel like we're already kinda dating, ya know?  **When I asked you these same questions only days ago, you had no  answers for me other than "I can't see the future". What makes you think I can now? I really don't know. I want to be with you. I want to make this work with you in the best way I know how, but you have to understand my lack of experience and how much I'm growing right now to even meet you here. I do respect how far you've come for me!!! And I will go as far as you want me to(because I want to!), but I have to do it slowly. I've never even dated someone, let alone tried to live with them, or give all of myself to them.  **Yes, dating. I want to do a whole lot of that! Do you realize that if I'm dating you, you are the first person I've ever really dated? I mean I go and do stuff with Karla, be she and I have never "dated". We never referred to each other as boyfriend or girlfriend. And I went on 1 date with a crazy truck-driving chick, who was in love with me by the end of the date, despite me not really being so nice to her or even showing her any affection. I had to stop talking to her after that date! SHE WAS  CRAZY!!!  **Last night I stopped for coffee at the gas station on my way home. The guy at the register asked me what I was doing drinking coffee this time of night, was I going on a road trip, etc. I replied that my girlfriend was at work tonight and I wanted to stay up so I could talk to her, so I needed some caffeine. You know what? That is the first time I've ever been able to refer to someone as my girlfriend. Do you understand what I'm saying here? Do you get any idea of why I have to take this slow yet? I've never had anyone before that I could call mine. Never. I don't know how to do this. I'm doing good so far, but I need to learn 1 thing at a time.   I'm really really getting frustrated with not being able to "be yours."  There is so much restraint - such a big part of me that you just can't have yet.  I want to share, I trust you like I've never trusted another human being in my life, respect you, love you.  God's honest truth, I've never felt like this before either.  I never really believed that it was like they say in the movies :)  I've had glimpses - I do know that I have been in love.  But the trust, the respect, the urge to give myself over to you and let you take me where you will?  The equally strong  urge to show you everything I know, to teach you, find things out  together - it's all new.  **Reading that makes me feel SO happy and loved! Thank you so much for writing it! I know you are frustrated. You are much more experienced at dealing with having a person in your life that you care about than I am. Please just go slow with me. I KNOW I can't go fast now. I understand that you do want someone to be with, and that you are used to having someone in your life. I am not used to it, although I want you in my life very badly! In the past I have filled my life with so many hobbies to fill the time most people spend with their b/f or g/f or even the time spent with their friends. And now, I've grown used to these hobbies, and giving them up is hard to do. I realize that I will simply not have enough money to play like I do if I move out of my parent's house. I will do these things to be with you. I care about you that much. These things are fairly minor by themselves, but they all add up. I'm spoiled, please try to understand me.  **Back around my birthday Karla, Koby and I were talking and discussing old times. We realized that right now is the happiest we've ever been. None of us has ever been very happy before in our lives. Never felt free or comfortable with ourselves until just recently. I am so free and can do whatever I want, whenever I want. That is very hard to loose, but you are worth it! Just understand that I need to leave my freedom slowly, not overnight. Simply moving out will be a VERY big step for me that I've been putting off for so many years because I'm spoiled.      **I'm trying, but you aren't making it easy lately ;-) Your girly side is surprising me with her neediness too. I've been thinking hard all day today. I've been in a rather "outside of the situation" state of mind. Kind of sad. Sad because when I look at it that way, I can really see all of the ways that things could go bad. I can always see them, but when I can get up the nerve to step outside, I can REALLY SEE THEM. I'm picking the road for us that I see the least obstacles on. Please go down it with me.  Eventhough it's longer than the dangerous road, it is MUCH safer for both of us in the long run. 1 wreck on the short dangerous road will take us out of the race for MUCH longer(if not completely) than if we just keep a steady pace on this long safe road.   Well, dang, and I'm going to have you late at night too!   I'm one lucky woman :-D   You're amazing!   Love ya :)   **Yes, and I'm lucky too to have found you!! I love you!   Dennis

      From:   dennis   To:   marfells@hotmail.com Subject:   Getting to 100% Date:   Fri 07/12/02 04:21 PM     **Don't worry that you're dragging me into pain by confiding in me during your divorce Shannon. I'm here to support you. I understand what I got myself into. I've known all along. And being with you, even just on the phone, makes it all worth it.  Let me know what you need, ok?  **Trust me, I will and so far I think I have :-)   I still mean it, I'm still in 100% - come what may, when it may, as it wishes - whatever.  **I know. It means so much to me that you say that. Thank you for  telling and showing me that :-)   I don't know what to say to you - so much of me wants to convince you, but that's wrong. So I'm a little stuck... I don't want to back down either, I won't change my mind about you. I'm just done being scared. I feel like I faught the good fight, did everything I could and I *still* love you more than I've ever loved anyone, anything ever. And I know you love me too.  **I appreciate you sharing that with me and I smile every time I read that :-) I do love you too! What is there to convince me of? I love you. I want to be with you. I'm not going to be 100% until we CAN be 100%. There are outisde circumstances that keep us where we're at. But I am 99.999% right now and giving you all I have to give of myself. I just need to hold that one little tiny piece back, because I've never done this before, we can't REALLY be together just yet because of your current situation. Eventhough I want to give that last little .0001%, I can't do it honestly, not right now. I know you can understand and be satisfied with that :-)   I wish I could give you my not-scared brain for a day :) When you're ready, let me know... I'm waiting, I'll wait as long as you need me too, until you're ok with everything. I'd never, ever, ever want to force anything on you. I don't mean I'm ready to do anything wrong. I'm just ready to be yours. I'm IN, Dennis, as of this moment, for good. You've got me. Call me, IM me, email me, whatever - when you're ready - before you're ready - as soon as possible - whatever. :) I'm yours. I love you.  **I don't know what to say to that really. I'm not scared, never really have been "scared" so much as cautious about going to a new place.   **Since you wrote this I HAVE called you, IMed you, emailed you, and even "whatevered" you ;-) I did it when I was ready and as soon and as often as possible. You know I'm yours, but I'll tell you I'm yours anyway. I love you! :-) :-D   Let me know what I need to do - to do this the right way - a way that we're all comfortabe with. That's what I want. Ok? You say things to me that indicate that you're ready, then you back off. I'm doing the same thing, I suppose. I'm ready now, not going to recant that. You can only dance so long before your legs get tired :)  **I know what you're saying. I'm VERY ready to be with you, to spend endless hours with you, and to love you. I am already doing these things. I just need some adjustment time as we take each step. I've grown a lot in just the last day, I'm sure you can see it :-)  **I'm not going backwards from here, only forwards. You know my plan, my road, my path. I won't go any slower unless I have to for both of our sake. I'm not dancing. I want to be with you.    Dang, hehe, I wish I was even close to being awake :) I'd be more  understandable that way. Sorry if I'm not being CLEAR. I feel clear, but damn words... You know. Hehe, I'm laughing at myself, I'm a dork, a silly tired in love dork. :-D  **I think you were pretty clear. If my replies make it seem like I didn't "get it", then type to me again. :-)   I can back off - give you time? Is that what you want? Or do you want me to work on convincing you? I'm not sure how I'm supposed to be - the only thing I'm going on here is feeling.   **Just do what we've been doing. Walk down this path with me, don't run. Be like we have been. And take the time to make sure that you're doing what you need to do for YOU right now during your divorce. I don't need convincing, I'm already convinced :-)  My brain is getting fried, now that I know what I want, I can't really fight anymore to try to get myself talked out of it.  **Don't fight yourself. Don't try to talk yourself out of this. I want to be with you, but I don't want to marry you overnight, that's all I'm saying :-)   I still want to do things RIGHT, Dennis, I never said I was willing to fuck it all up. Ok?  **I know.   I just feel very strongly that right may not mean waiting for ever?  **I'm pretty sure we're already past this issue, but if not, you know what to do :-) We're moving forward, as much as we can considering the circumstances, each day. Each time we talk. I just want to take small steps. I still want to get to the same destination :-)  It's also not pressuring you. YOU need to tell me what YOU need -  whatever you say is what I'll do. I want you to be as comfortable as I am, to not be scared anymore. I'll still wait, don't ever take it to mean that I won't. Hehe, talk to me after I've slept for a few hours ;)  **We did talk and I beleive we've resolved this:-)   Ugh, maybe between these last two emails I've managed to make a lick of sense? I hope so - I know what I mean anyway :)  **Yes. You made sense :-)   STILL in love with you :)   **I never doubt it for a second! And I'm in love with you too! :-D  BTW - call me if you want to talk today - or don't if you want time to think about stuff... whatever, I'm easy :) And don't feel like you have to stay up all night chatting with me - I can't help but feel like a loser with a shitty job sometimes. (Uh, cause I have a shitty job???)  **:-D There you go apologizing again! Remember that feather??? You're gonna get it!  Let me know if you still want to hang out Saturday - I'm thinking I'd love to catch a movie with you...  **Of course! We just gotta decide what movie to see and when. I'm  thinking something around 6ish so we can eek out a little "extra" time together ;-) Don't know what's playing right now, we'll just have to see. I'll have you home by 9, so don't worry :-) If that's too long or Paul doesn't go for it, I can do whatever we need to do. And let me know what's up with the Blaise PCM deal....  I just knocked out the 10 best radios of my life!  I totally rocked - I mean they were perfect!  Damn, and I didn't even think about saving the tapes...  Tapes?  Hehe, they're digital now anyway...  I though for sure that you'd have me all screwed up and my voice would waver / crack.  But no, not in the least!  I'm so fucking happy that it just shines through in my voice - the whole world is hearing me smiling :-D  You did this to me :-D  **Thank you! I love you! You do the same thing to me! I wonder if the people listening to your radios will know you're in love?  I thought they would suck big time this morning because I did them about 30 minutes after you went *poof*  I wasn't sure how I was feeling after that - I sorta 1/2 way freaked myself out for a little bit - about 10 minutes?  Sent you a little email right then, and yeah, I tried to call you :)  Hehe so sue me :p  **It's ok. I understand. It sucks getting cut off like that in the middle of a good conversation. It made me happy to know that you trusted me and knew I was coming back. You are finally starting to trust our love and it's very nice :-)  But then this lovely calm feeling came over me - the same feeling I have when I'm in your arms.  I know you're coming back, I'm not scared anymore.  (Hehe, watch my karma - now that I'm sure you're coming back, I've scared you off for good!!!  :-D  )  You finally got through my thick head the last little bit.  I guess I let go of whatever I had keeping you out?  I don't know - I haven't cried for joy in a good long while, thanks for that!  **Thank you for sharing that with me. You make me feel so good inside!!! I don't know what to do with myself sometimes! :-D:-D:-D:-D :-) :-) :-)!!!!!!!!!!  Thank you a million times - I mean it from the bottom of my heart, the deepest part of my soul - just thank you!  **You're welcome :-) I'm so glad I can make you feel like that. Just little old me.... :-)  >**If you say you're sorry again I'm going to tickly you with a feather until you scream!!! :-D Especially if it's about something that you didn't cause!!!    I'm like that - it's another phrase I overuse.  I mean it lots of  different ways, it's just something I say.  I'll work on quitting it, ok?  I don't always mean I'M SORRY...  like that.  Here, Encarta.com says:      See, it's a handy little word ;) AND if you keep threatening to tickle me, well, I may just say it on purpose ;)  **Yes, it is a handy word, but don't feel like you ever have to  apologize to me for loving me or wanting to reach out to me. That's what I'm here for. I'm going to get you to kick your self esteem up a few notches yet....:-)  **And I've heard that a feather duster can be used to have a really good time.... ;-)  Nope, was not planned at all.  But I'm glad it happened that way.  I wouldn't change any of this, I think we're going a great job with what we've been given, don't you?  **Yes. We're both smart, logical, and caring people who like to talk things out. We have been doing excellent!   It would have been about all that we would have been doing(spooning).  Or kissing.  Nothing **that** bad.  Sometimes it's actually easier to catch someone in the act.    **I know, but kissing passionately on the couch would have been pretty tough to take from Paul's perspective. And it would have ended any chance for us to be together now... know what I mean?  Thanks for being so smart...  I couldn't do this with a dummy!  I'd have gotten into a HUGE mess by now.  (uh, yeah, you know what I mean?  A huger mess!  A messier mess?  :-D )  **I know. And thank you for being so smart too! And so strong. A weaker person would have found my buttons, pushed them, and completely detoured around my intelligence by triggering my emotions.  >**What does wonkey feel like? :-)   Come feel me ;-D  **Uh! Ok! Still feeling wonkey? Does it matter?  >**:-D I understand. Beleive me, I wanted to be there. I will not go somewhere that I know I don't want to go.   I believe you!  I do I do I do!  Thanks for the support, how is it that you manage to be exactly what I need exactly when I need it?  I hope I'm as good for you as you are for me...  I want to be!  **You're welcome! I don't know how I manage that. I just be me and it seems to work! You are very good for me!  >**Remember that us fat guys don't look so hot all contorted up like those skinny fuckers do! ;-) And we're not as limber either!! But we snuggle and hug MUCH better!! And you can always use a fat guy to stop a car with if you're downtown together ;-)   You're silly.  I don't care what you look like.  I done told you - I actually *really* like you the way you are!  To OT on you, you're solid :)  It's fucking cool!  I could play with ya (um?  yeah, that's not Freudian!) for hours - just seeing if I could tip you over...  Hehe, I'm going to make myself blush, but it's kinda nice to, uh, know a guy is there...  uh, yeah...  LOL  :o  Haha, hahahahaha!  I MEAN to say that I remember when I made the switch from Ray to Jimmy, I was like, where's the beef :-D  OMG, I just giggled at work, and they're asking me what's so funny!  :o :o :o  *exposed!*  **:-) I know what you're saying. Thank you for saying it. Play with me whenever you want! 0:-) I'll show you where the beef is ;-) It's in your coffee and you can trade it for a throttle body! LOL! :-D  We're going to be just fine.  No more self-doubt.  No more questioning you.  We seem to be getting what we need when we need it, when we get to a *stuck* place - life drops the answer in our laps.  **Yes, it is kind of odd how we've made it this far. I don't know about life dropping the answer in our laps, but there has definitely been a "planned" or "guided" feel to this.  >**Well, if being physically naked in front of me is not an issue....;-)   It's not - come see - you owe me a tickle anyway.  I'm not perfect, I can tell you that.  But I'm ok...  I feel good enough for you.  Which is NOT to diminish you at all - I feel like we were made for each other in some way.  I never really felt happy with me - like I wasn't good enough.  Jim tried once or twice to let me know I was - he really thought I was hot, but I wasn't quite able to accept it from him.  Hehe, and I had a better body back then too, dammit :)  But you make me feel "perfect."  I could get way used to this :-D  **You're such a tease! ;-) You're going to get tickled really bad if you keep asking for it! I'm glad that you can feel comfortable like that with me. It will be tough for me to be naked in front of you at first. I'm very self conscious about my body. BUT, I will feel more comfortable in front of you than anyone else. And it won't take long for me to get to 100% in that comfortable department. And you ARE HOT NOW! GET USED TO IT!   Hehe, that's cool ;)  We still have a whole lot of car talk to do - and I'm not about to give up on the cars!  I'll always be your "car chick" ;)  Like I said, I'll be glad to wrench with you anytime, as long as you promise to clean up with me afterwards ;)  Just let me be me...  (uh, that's Eminem again, isn't it :x )  **I wouldn't want you to be anything but you. I've always wanted a car chick, and now I've got one! Yeah!!! :-D :-)  >**YES. I still say YES. Yeah, you SO tried to convince me otherwise, but all you really convinced me of was that you cared about me enough to discourage me, which made me want you even more. Plus there's my "prove you wrong" and "argue" side that you stimulated by telling me that I didn't want to say yes...   I know :)  I'm happy it's worked out this way so far :)  HAPPY like you wouldn't believe!  That was the plan the whole way:  I'm going to act all shy and unsure and make Dennis fall for me...     **You're silly! And you know I'm happy like that too!!!   >**You're not going to lose me. I'm here. Not going anywhere. What do I need to do to prove it? I would like to see you being independent a bit, but only just as badly as I want to be with you.   I know!  I finally know totally how YOU feel, and you can't hide it from me anymore :)  So stop trying!  Ok?  It's killing me, a little bit, to watch you struggling too.  But know that I'm with you.  I'm feeling the same things, different motivation for the feelings, but the same feelings.  And now that you've proven (later in this email) yourself, I am absolutely not scared one bit of losing you.  (hehe, except for you inexplicably leaving me this morning ;)  )  **:-) I'm glad that we're seeing eye to eye here. This paragraph makes a lot of the things I replied to at the top of this email pretty redundant!  >**I'll help you. I will keep us going slow. I know I can, at least until I feel that it's right to speed up.   Yeah, I feel the same way - but trust me, when we're both ready to actually move on it, I don't think it will be slow anymore.  You know, Mopark was 9 1/2 weeks ago...  Hehe, 9 1/2 weeks...  LOL, well, I know what movie I'm watching after I wake up today.  You're not Mickey Rourke; I'm not Kim Basinger - it's good evidence of what NOT to do :-D  Uh, and then there's the sex ;)  Hehe, poor couch!  **Yes, when the time is right, slow will not be a word I use! And I think you are MUCH hotter than Kim Basinger...;-) She's too tall and lanky. She just doesn't "do it" for me. You GOTTA keep that couch!  I digress...  WHEN we're both ready - and yes, I'm waiting - I'm not *ready* yet either, you know that - when we're both really ready it's going to be fast.  I'm not worried, as long as we stay honest and hang on until we're both *really* ready to let it go.  (Getting excited!!!)  **Yes, that is the exact thing I wanted you to see. Besides, we CAN'T really be together right now. You've got a LOT of work to do that I will distract you from. You've got a lot of issues to deal with, that I may distract you from. If you need to slack off on the emails and calls a bit, that's fine. It will be very hard to spend this kind of time talking with each other while you are getting a house ready to sell, moving in with your parents, doing your homework on your divorce, etc. You know I'm going to hang onto you!!! And I will always be honest with you, even if I know it will hurt you. I owe you that, just as you owe that to me.  >**You're not a loser. This is still so new and I worry about losing you too. I know you're real tho. I have accepted it. I guess it's easier for me because I was the pursuer, not the one being pursued from the begining.  Are you SURE about that?  Who said the word "crush" first?  Huh?  We are both guilty as charged.  I'm not about to go claiming innocence!  "Ooooh, I was poor little married me, just going to Travis's house to hang out with the Neon dudes, when this horrible ogre started making passes at me!!!"  Yeah, whatever!  I'm every bit as responsible as you are, buddy :p  **Ok. I'll give you that... but I did send the first PM! AND you know I was thinking naughty thoughts as early as Mopark.... DAMN RICH!  >** There, you happy now?! lol! :-D If you'd just look into my damn eyes you'll see your security blanket! I'm goofy, silly, stupid in love with you. How could I not be and be acting like this? I've never felt like this before. You make me deleriously happy just by being in the same area as me!!! What do you need??? I'd do anything for you, except hurt you, lie to you, or something that would jeopardize our future together.    YES!  I'm happy!  Blissfully happy!  I'm goofy silly stupid in love with you too, and I LOVE it :-D  You're turning me into things I never thought I'd be.  I didn't know I was this fucking sunny and perky and *happy* - I didn't ever feel like much of an optimist.  You're challenging me, don't stop.  Don't ever stop :-D  **I won't ever stop! And I'm so glad to see you "optomistic"!  >**Thank you so much for telling him. He knew it already and lying to him would only make things worse. How long could we keep up the lie anyway?   We couldn't.  I had already told him a lot anyway.  He'd seen a lot more.  I am still having a hard time with some parts of the email he sent to you.  *sigh*  I mean him no harm.  Not anymore, not ever again.  It wouldn't be *right* to lie about it - besides, it's not like I can deny it anyway!  **Think of it this way: The pain and conflict that he has felt for so long is finally coming to a head and he will finally be free. It hurts to lance the boil, but it feels so much better after it has drained. And you will never hurt him again after this. Take comfort in this.  >**II ask myself that all the time. What makes Shannon love me so much? What makes me love her so much? I have no answer really, other than "I just do". There are a thousand good reasons why I love you, like the fact that you're loving, kind, smart, caring, sexy, beautiful, and about 10000x more stuff that my fingers are saving themselves from typing.   Thanks :-D  I like it when you say nice things to me.  It just sounds so good!  What makes me love you so much?  Hahaha, well, you do, silly!  You're kind and loving and honest and brave and smart and you do cute things and you turn me on like crazy and you're a little bit shy and insecure which makes me want to take care of you and you're funny and you're silly and you're "solid" and you're cuddly and you're just everything I've ever thought might make another person *good* Ok?  You're stubborn enough to handle me, you're naughty like me, you're always questioning things.  You're a little bit contrary, and I like that a lot. You won't let me get away with shit, and at the same time you're supportive.  Just amazing!  Just exactly how I'd make you up, if I could have.  But I didn't have to, cause you're real!  I'm lucky as hell!  Oh, yeah, and it's ok with you if I get lazy and don't use as many commas as I should ;)  **I'm grinning like a domokun! I wish I could give you a giant **HUG** right now! You make me feel so good. Good like I've never felt before. Thank you so much for being part of my life and sharing your love with me! :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  :-D  (sometimes there isn't anything left to do but smile like a dern fool)  **You make me feel like that a lot!!!:-D :-)  I won't go down the wrong road.  I won't!  Nope, not me!  Not now!  I've got that girly shit under control now, I think I'm channeling it into sexual energy ;)  (uh, if that's ok with you?  Hehe)  **No, don't do that! Anything but SEXUAL ENERGY!!! I have no idea how to deal with that!!!   ;-)   >**I do sometimes have a hard time believing you are real too.   I'm real, 100% American made ME!  No fillers, no artificial colors or flavors...  **Reading that really makes me want to lay a big 'ol kiss on you!!!  >**I want to be with you, very badly. Cuddling with you and talking sounds absolutely great right now! I don't know how long the paperwork will take for your divorce, but until then it looks like we will not be seeing each other in person :-( I can do it. I will not gamble with Chris. We've done pretty well on just AIM and emails so far, and only recently have we been able to BE together in real life. I think we can make it :-) We have to! :-)   Yep :-D  We can do it, I know we can.  But we may not have to, depending on how long it takes Paul to realize what's up and let me see you without holding Chris over my head.  Either way.  Ya know?  **Yes. We can make it through that. It's so minor compared to how far we've come and how far we are going to go! And besides, think about how absance makes the heart grow fonder! I know I'll be able to see you Saturday, but I don't know when we'll be able to see each other next after that, so I'm still not going to get my hopes up too much.   >**You should tell Paul "thank you" for making us take some time apart in real life right now. Tell him that you are glad and that you beleive it will increase the odds of you and I being together. If anything will make him not care if you are with me, that will do it. Gotta love reverse psychology! lol   Hehe, you're BAD!  Actually, it may be good for us anyway, so if that is the way it shakes out, I'm not going to fight it.  Everything has worked out so well from a "random shit" aspect, I'm kinda thinking of just riding it out.  But then again, if he's going to let me see you, I'll do it.  Respectfully of course, I'll get home on time and everything, just like Daddy tells me to :)  *rolls eyes*  And you think you've got troubles living with your parents...  **Don't worry, your "daddy" has met me and he even seems to approve of me.... sorta... :-) Imagine how much harder it would be for him if I was treating you bad, or genuinely not a nice guy, a guy that he could see was bad for you. Don't worry. I'll get you home on time! And I hear you about riding it out.    >**When I asked you these same questions only days ago, you had no answers for me other than "I can't see the future". What makes you think I can now? I really don't know. I want to be with you. I want to make this work with you in the best way I know how, but you have to understand my lack of experience and how much I'm growing right now to even meet you here. I do respect how far you've come for me!!! And I will go as far as you want me to(because I want to!), but I have to do it slowly. I've never even dated someone, let alone tried to live with them, or give all of myself to them.  That's fine, I do have a pretty good idea of where this is going, but I'm not going to PUSH you to get there.  I appreciate your honesty.  I respect your boundaries.  I'm cool.  I've grown a lot too, don't think you're experiencing any of this on your own, ok?  I've done things I never thought I could.  **Yes, I realize what you are going through!!! Thank you for sharing this with me. This is a very big and important experience for both of us. Thank you for being part of my life, for helping me to grow, for giving me your love and letting me give you mine. I know you would never consciously push me, but that damn girly side sometimes doesn't realize what she's doing. She wants to be loved so badly, and she's been doing without love for so long.... I understand. I can deal with it.  >**Yes, dating. I want to do a whole lot of that! Do you realize that if I'm dating you, you are the first person I've ever really dated?  :-D  That is so fucking cool, I don't even know what to say!  (sometimes there's nothing left to do but smile like a fool!)  **I'm glad that is cool to you. Some women would be scared away by that. I was a little worried.... just a little.... but I figured you were hooked either way so I could share anything with you now!;-)   >**Last night I stopped for coffee at the gas station on my way home. The guy at the register asked me what I was doing drinking coffee this time of night, was I going on a road trip, etc. I replied that my girlfriend was at work tonight and I wanted to stay up so I could talk to her, so I needed some caffeine. You know what? That is the first time I've ever been able to refer to someone as my girlfriend.   I love you!  I want to kiss you and hold you and be with you for shit like that!  I feel it is supremely unfair not to be able to share things like that with you.  I'm so flattered I think I'm going to have some kind of attack now :)  Hehe, you sure do make me smile.  I'm going to have wrinkles from you, dammit!  **You didn't react to that in the way I thought you would. Thank you. Thank you so much for appreciating my weaknesses along with my strengths. I want to be with you so much right now. This is what love is about. It's about loving all of someone, even the bad parts, the weak parts, the parts that are hardest to love. Loving those parts is true love. Oh, and sorry for almost making you have an attack! As I typed that above, I actually was a bit teary eyed. It hurts so bad sometimes to think about how long I've been without someone to call my own. Without someone to  love. There were nights that I layed in bed and cried for someone to hold, to have, to be mine. I have wanted someone to share my life with for so long, but I've never found anyone that I felt like I could actually be with..... not even Karla..... but now I've met you. It hurts to type some of this. And thinking about being with you, and having you in my life right now is bringing tears of joy to my eyes. Tears of pleasure. I love you. I truly do. I can't imagine ever being with someone besides you. I've given as much of myself to you right now as I can spare. You love in the same way I do. And that means a lot to me. :''') :-)  >**Do you understand what I'm saying here? Do you get any idea of why I have to take this slow yet? I've never had anyone before that I could call mine. Never. I don't know how to do this. I'm doing good so far, but I need to learn 1 thing at a time.  Awwww, :-D  Yes, I understand.  I love you anyway, I love you because of it.  Thank you - this is some of the first *real* insecurity you've shared with me - I mean that way deep stuff...  You don't even know how much I want to kiss you and tell you it'll all be ok :)  **Thank you. Thank you for understanding me! :-) :'''D  Dennis, I will do everything in my power to make everything right for you.  You deserve it!  :-D  **Thank you. And I will do the same for you. It means so much to me that you say that.  >**Please just go slow with me. I KNOW I can't go fast now. I understand that you do want someone to be with, and that you are used to having someone in your life. I am not used to it, although I want you in my life very badly!   I'm scared too - we're coming at this from different angles.  That's all.  I'm just as insecure as you are.  I want you too!  A little 0:-)  I'm used to having the wrong person in my life and being lazy with my relationship and doing a lot of mutual hurting.  I'm worried that the patterns are going to stick around.  I need to fix that about me.  I'll do it.  You make it easy anyway, I can't be mean to you, I can't hurt you.  **I can't wait to see you on Saturday. I am going to hug you like you've never been hugged before. I may not turn loose of you until it's time for you to go home! We're sure going to look funny walking into the theater sideways! ;-) I hope we get one of the theaters that has the fold up armrests! Ronnies has a few theaters with that feature, and they ROCK! Seem like they'd be GREAT for cuddling! But there's no way to know if you'll end up in a theater that has that feature or not, it's just luck of the draw.  >**In the past I have filled my life with so many hobbies to fill the time most people spend with their b/f or g/f or even the time spent with their friends. And now, I've grown used to these hobbies, and giving them up is hard to do. I realize that I will simply not have enough money to play like I do if I move out of my parent's house. I will do these things to be with you. I care about you that much. These things are fairly minor by themselves, but they all add up. I'm spoiled, please try to understand me.   I'm spoiled too, believe me.  But in a totally different way.  Things are just things - stuff is just stuff.  That comes and goes.  You're not supposed to start your life out with a lot of money anyway.  That's the way it goes.  I'm not worried about that at all, I'm already living on less money than I need, I'm good at penny pinching.  Yet I still manage to put new stuff on the Neon once in a while, don't I?  **:-) Yes. We'll be ok. I know things will be tight for both of us for a while(no pun!), but we'll do ok. I don't see how we could ever not be successful in life now that we've come together. We give each other so much confidence! We give each other so much support! The only downfall is that we'll literally have to pry ourselves apart to get anything done! ;-)   >**Back around my birthday Karla, Koby and I were talking and discussing old times. We realized that right now is the happiest we've ever been. None of us has ever been very happy before in our lives. Never felt free or comfortable with ourselves until just recently. I am so free and can do whatever I want, whenever I want. That is very hard to loose, but you are worth it! Just understand that I need to leave my freedom slowly, not overnight. Simply moving out will be a VERY big step for me that I've been putting off for so many years because I'm spoiled.   I hope you realize that I don't want your freedom?  Not really.  I want you with me, but that does NOT mean you lose the rest of your life!  As long as you come back eventually, you're free to come and go...  I've never tried to be a ball and chain, don't care for that role.  I'm not like other women, so living with me is not like all of the cliche jokes you always hear.  I need my own shit, ya know, my own freedom, my own friends, all of that good stuff!  **I know, I realize that. What I meant by my freedom is that I've never had someone like you that I want to spend SO MUCH time with. I'd rather be with you than do a lot of the stuff I used to do. I'm sure that after a while we'll get "satisfied" with each other enough that we'll go back to doing our old stuff. Enjoying old hobbies. But right now, I am completely and totally in to you!   >**I'm trying, but you aren't making it easy lately ;-) Your girly side is surprising me with her neediness too. I've been thinking hard all day today. I've been in a rather "outside of the situation" state of mind. Kind of sad. Sad because when I look at it that way, I can really see all of the ways that things could go bad. I can always see them, but when I can get up the nerve to step outside, I can REALLY SEE THEM. I'm picking the road for us that I see the least obstacles on. Please go down it with me. Eventhough it's longer than the dangerous road, it is  MUCH safer for both of us in the long run. 1 wreck on the short  dangerous road will take us out of the race for MUCH longer(if not completely) than if we just keep a steady pace on this long safe road.  Girly side in check.  Until you're ready for it, some day you'll have to face it head on, but I'm good for now.  It's an adjustment for me.  I'm growing and changing and learning and everything that you're doing.  I'm thinking.  I'm WITH you :-D  This is definately a journey, and yes, I'll go with you, and let's agree to pick the path together?  I can't stop fucking smiling!  I'm so happy!  :-D  :-D  :-D  :-D  Hehe!  **I know. I can handle the girly side, but she was a little different than what I had been dealing with up until now. It's ok. I LIKE the girly side! TRUST ME! And yes, you have a 50% say in the path we take. You always will. We're both stubborn, but we're both smart too. We'll do ok! :-D :-) :-D  Have a good day, maybe sometime I'll find out why you disappeared???   **You did find out!;-) DAMN PHONE LINES!   BTW, I'm trying to scale back the drama big time.  It's silly - I like it to a point, but I'm going to make a concerted effort to be more level-headed with you.  I can't give you courage if I'm always freaking out, can I?  ;)  **Just be you. That's all I ask. Do what you think is right. That's all that you can do. I can't help you with things unless you talk to me about them. How you present your problems to me is up to you.   Want to kiss you a lot today!  **KISS**!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It's going to be OK.  All of it.  This calm is not leaving me!  **YES!!! I'm glad that you finally realize how much I really do want to be here, how much I really am not going anywhere, and how much I REALLY DO LOVE YOU! Be calm! I'm glad I can give you that!  I read the email from Paul to you back to Paul again - thank you - gee, it sounds like you guys are about ready to smooch    I get pictures :-D  **You're a better kisser than he is....;-)  What you wrote back will help me out a lot.  You're outside, you're very intelligent, you're level-headed about all of this.  I know Paul needs someone to talk to.  I need someone to talk to too.  You're really helping out with everything.  **Thank you. But understand that I'm NOT outside. I'm as inside as any of us. I am very intelligent. I am very level headed. But I also am biased like a MFer! I can and will talk to Paul, but remember that if any issue comes up, I'm taking YOUR SIDE. That will not be the best scenario... I'm glad that I can help so far tho. I'm glad that Paul has Cindy to confide in. I can't and won't be his counselor. I can only do that for you.   **Plus I got my own issues right now with Karla. She's really trying to make me think. And I'm really trying to help her deal with this. But she is really, really, really weak right now. Don't worry that I'm even considering being with her in any sort of romantic way. But she is forcing me to feel a lot of shit that I haven't felt in a long time. It doesn't matter tho, I am DONE with that. I know that all she's doing right now is reaching out, trying to compete for attention, and trying to hold onto something that isn't rightfully hers to have, but yet she's had it for so long, it still hurts to let go, eventhough she knows it  WAS never hers. And she's feeling guilty for hurting me. And she's feeling guilty for being selfish. And she's feeling old. And she's feeling like she may never find someone as special as me to be with as more than a friend. She's sad that a mere friend has meant more to her for this long than any of a number of men she's had as b/f's. She thinks I'm her soul mate, and has said so plainly. She's worried that if I'm her soul mate, what does that leave her in the significant other category? I'm trying to help her, but I'm beginning think I'm only making her pain worse by seeing her and talking to her :-/  I didn't plan on putting you in that situation.  You've got some kind of grace.  And I mean definitions #2 and #3:  2.  politeness:  dignified, polite, and decent behavior  She fended off queries with her usual grace.    3.  generosity of spirit:  a capacity to tolerate, accommodate, or forgive people  You've got it in great quantities.  I'm learning!  Will you teach me that?  Among the million other things I want to learn from you, can you slip that in somewhere along the line?  Please?  You never cease to amaze me!  **Thank you! I'll do my best. I don't know how I learned it. I'm just me. Damn you've given me a lot of compliments! More than anyone else ever. You must like me or something ;-)  I think I'm unserstanding something new!  "Growing old with someone" is about GROWING, not getting wrinkles...  **YEP!  Thanks for sending that to Paul.  **NP! :-)   I forget that he doesn't ge my jokes, so I asked him, "Did Dennis reply to your email yet?"  "Yeah, just a little bit ago."  "Well, can I go see him or what???"  I was just being a smartass - forgot myself for a minute, oops :o  He didn't like that too much.  I'll fix it - laugh it off, no worries :-D  **I think he's coming around. Don't know what the future will bring tho.   Hehe, well, as you can see, here I am *again* checking my email at odd times of the day...  **:-D Sorry I haven't sent much lately. Maybe this will make up for it a little???   Thought it'd be a great time to sneak in a few *kisses* and a great big *HUG*  **:-D Here's a few sneaked back! **HUG** *KISS* *KISS* **HUG**^100   **Ok, you happy now? :-P I didn't want you to cancel on me or something!   **Just when you thought you were gaining ground on the amount of bytes sent... :-D  **See you soon!   Dennis

But I want to reassure you that I have NO ill intentions WHATSOEVER with respect to your message, and your feelings.  I have NO plans of doing anything sneaky, anything nasty with what you sent me.  I printed that e-mail out yesterday, and let Shannon read it.  Immediately after she read it,  I tore it into a hundred or so pieces.  Shannon can vouch for that.

      From:   "Shannon Yevcak"   To:   spoolboy@autospeed.com Date:   Sat 07/13/02 11:02 AM        >**Don't worry that you're dragging me into pain by confiding in me during your divorce Shannon. I'm here to support you. I understand what I got myself into. I've known all along. And being with you, even just on the phone, makes it all worth it.    Meh, if you say so.  I'm feeling quite a bit like I'm trying to stand on a razor blade.  I've lost 5 pounds (not such a bad thing) in the past week (bad thing!) since I've told Paul it's over.  My tight pants are a little loose!  I don't want to buy new small clothes.  The bummer is that I never seem to loose any weight below the waist :x  It all comes off up top :x  Hehe, do they make negative bra sizes?  This is really hard.  The good of that is that I'm going through it!   I have had strange dreams for the past few days.  Yesterday on the couch and twice last night.  The one yesterday was some kind of sadistic lesbian freaky weird thing.  Disturbing because I don't swing that way at all!  I'm thinking it's a reflection of implied or inferred misogyny in my life with Paul...  Then the first bad one last night (which I remembered clearly when I woke up, but is fading now) involved very graphic pictures of dead bodies.  I awoke in a cold sweat from this one, and grasped out for Paul.  But the bed was empty.  So I curled up, wrapped myself in my blanket, and prayed for the pictures (which were really really gross!) to leave.  Did some breathing and got calm enough to go back to sleep.  The third one escapes me - I don't remember the content much, except it was sexual again, and disturbing enough to wake me up about 8 minutes before the alarm went off.  I hate that shit!  :x   There - done bitching about my sucky life.  Don't worry that I'm not "going through" this - I am!  I'm lucky enough to have a problem that has put me on the couch more than a few times, and I've got a ton of coping skills at my disposal.  I used to play with my shrink - Sherrie.  She was neat, but I was able to outsmart her most of the time.  She never really got to the meat of any of my issues - but I felt better after I talked to her anyway.  I think most of this email needs no reply - it's just mushy gushy stuff - we agree on it all, we're disgusting - LOL - I *hate* lovey stuff :-D  >**I'm not going backwards from here, only forwards. You know my plan, my road, my path. I won't go any slower unless I have to for both of our sake. I'm not dancing. I want to be with you.  So, what are you saying?  You won't dance with me???  :(  >**Don't fight yourself. Don't try to talk yourself out of this. I want to be with you, but I don't want to marry you overnight, that's all I'm saying :-)   Awww, dang, and I was sooooo hoping to jump from marriage to marriage...  SHUCKS!  >**:-D There you go apologizing again! Remember that feather??? You're gonna get it!   PLEEEEEEASE!?!?!?!?!?????  Stop teasing me!  >I'm so fucking happy that it just shines through in my voice - the whole world is hearing me >smiling :-D You did this to me :-D  >**Thank you! I love you! You do the same thing to me! I wonder if the people listening to your radios will know you're in love?   Probably - if they're perceptive.  LOL - now I see some little old Granny calling to get the forecast and getting a knowing smile from hearing me...  Hehe!  *cute!!!*  You're MOM thinks you're in love :p  >**It's ok. I understand. It sucks getting cut off like that in the middle of a good conversation. It made me happy to know that you trusted me and knew I was coming back. You are finally starting to trust our love and it's very nice :-)  Yep, I'm in - you've got me, I've always trusted YOU - now I trust US.  >**(sorry)Yes, it is a handy word, but don't feel like you ever have to apologize to me for loving me or wanting to reach out to me. That's what I'm here for. I'm going to get you to kick your self esteem up a few notches yet....:-)   You really think I've got a self-esteem problem?  I don't - I've got massive quantities of it.  I'm in an unsusal situation, under a lot of stress, making decisions that are **critical** to the rest of my life, and more importantly to the rest of my son's life.  You expect me to do that without a whiff of self-doubt?  That would be wrong, selfish and cruel.  Plus I'm dealing with the constant put-downs I've been submitting to for a few years - they never really affected ME - they made ME go into hiding.  Give me some time to adjust, would ya?  :p  >**I know, but kissing passionately on the couch would have been pretty tough to take from Paul's perspective. And it would have ended any chance for us to be together now... know what I mean?  Yeah, I know.  :?  Poopie!  We did ok - we're doing ok, I don't doubt that we'll continue to do OK.  The only thing I've ever tried to do is "the best I can."  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but it sure does reduce regrets.  >**:-) I know what you're saying. Thank you for saying it. Play with me whenever you want! 0:-) I'll show you where the beef is ;-) It's in your coffee and you can trade it for a throttle body! LOL! :-D   Yeah, BEEF is going to be a theme for us, isn't it?  Grrrrrrreat!  >**You're such a tease! ;-) You're going to get tickled really bad if you keep asking for it!   What do I have to do to get you to make good on this promise?  >**I'm glad that you can feel comfortable like that with me. It will be tough for me to be naked in front of you at first. I'm very self conscious about my body. BUT, I will feel more comfortable in front of you than anyone else. And it won't take long for me to get to 100% in that comfortable department  Meh, I'll close my eyes, ok?  You're *cute* when you're insecure.  I like it a lot :)  It makes me want to take care of you :)  >**And you ARE HOT NOW! GET USED TO IT!   I'll try.  I explained my body image waaaaay back in the beginning-ish part of this whole series of emails.  It comes and goes - some days women feel HOT.  Some days we feel like shit.  ALL of us.  But I know my flaws, I know my good parts.  I just don't feel inadequate anymore :)  >**:-) I'm glad that we're seeing eye to eye here. This paragraph makes a lot of the things I replied to at the top of this email pretty redundant!   Hehe, yeah, I can almost look you in the eye now...  :)  >**Yes, when the time is right, slow will not be a word I use! And I think you are MUCH hotter than Kim Basinger...;-) She's too tall and lanky. She just doesn't "do it" for me. You GOTTA keep that couch!   Really?  She's actually very attractive!  She's got a neat face, not "classic" beauty.  Big sultry lips and *laser beam* eyes.  http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Agency/3160/basinger12.jpg  I think she'd qualify as "hot."  >**Yes, that is the exact thing I wanted you to see. Besides, we CAN'T really be together right now. You've got a LOT of work to do that I will distract you from. You've got a lot of issues to deal with, that I may distract you from. If you need to slack off on the emails and calls a bit, that's fine. It will be very hard to spend this kind of time talking with each other while you are getting a house ready to sell, moving in with your parents, doing your homework on your divorce, etc. You know I'm going to hang onto you!!! And I will always be honest with you, even if I know it will hurt you. I owe you that, just as you owe that to me.  Ok, well, so far my work hasn't stopped me from getting in touch with you somehow or another.  And I AM working - a lot!  I won't let another man hold me back from living MY life - been there, done that.  I won't let you distract me from "fixing" myself - getting back on more stable ground.  I need you to help me - I don't want to become dependant on you, but I really need someone to talk to.  And you UNDERSTAND me!!!   >**Think of it this way: The pain and conflict that he has felt for so long is finally coming to a head and he will finally be free. It hurts to lance the boil, but it feels so much better after it has drained. And you will never hurt him again after this. Take comfort in this.   Ew - did you have to be so *graphic* ???  I know.  I HATE hurting people!  I know we're 50/50 with the pain and hurt, but I'm always trying to take it away from those I love.  That's probably why I'm so screwed up :-D  >**I'm grinning like a domokun!   LOL - I can see you doing it too :)  Yeppers, you've got a nickname...  >**No, don't do that! Anything but SEXUAL ENERGY!!!  Ok, ok, I'll put it into my CLEANING urge instead, ok?  Happy now?  >**You didn't react to that in the way I thought you would.  What were you expecting?  I'm curious?  You shouldn't try to read my mind - you'll psyche yourself out...  ;)  >**Thank you. Thank you so much for appreciating my weaknesses along with my strengths. I want to be with you so much right now. This is what love is about. It's about loving all of someone, even the bad parts, the weak parts, the parts that are hardest to love. Loving those parts is true love.  You're welcome...  I expect nothing but the same from you, as I know I'm very weak and cranky and wishy-washy right now, and probably will be for a while to come.  >**As I typed that above, I actually was a bit teary eyed. It hurts so bad sometimes to think about how long I've been without someone to call my own. Without someone to love. There were nights that I layed in bed and cried for someone to hold, to have, to be mine. I have wanted someone to share my life with for so long, but I've never found anyone that I felt like I could actually be with..... not even Karla..... but now I've met you.  Dennis, I have done the same thing.  But you really were just alone, I was *married* - thinking these things as I lay awake in my marriage bed, completely unsatisfied.  Feeling a sense of duty and obligation to stay.  Unable to make a play for my own happiness.  Doomed, trapped, stuck, treading water.  "It's selfish and wrong to leave my son, to break these vows.  This is my retribution, this is what I deserve.  I can't afford to get out, I can't expect someone else to take care of me.  This is what I get for all of the hurt I caused Paul in the beginning of our relationship.  Maybe this is God's way of getting me back?"  >**It hurts to type some of this. And thinking about being with you, and having you in my life right now is bringing tears of joy to my eyes. Tears of pleasure. I love you. I truly do. I can't imagine ever being with someone besides you. I've given as much of myself to you right now as I can spare. You love in the same way I do. And that means a lot to me. :''') :-)   :-D  I just want to hug you :-D  And I will be, in about 5 hours!  Horray!!!!!!!  >**I can't wait to see you on Saturday. I am going to hug you like you've never been hugged before. I may not turn loose of you until it's time for you to go home! We're sure going to look funny walking into the theater sideways! ;-) I hope we get one of the theaters that has the fold up armrests! Ronnies has a few theaters with that feature, and they ROCK! Seem like they'd be GREAT for cuddling! But there's no way to know if you'll end up in a theater that has that feature or not, it's just luck of the draw.   Oh well, we can improvise.  LOL - walking sideways. Yeaaaaah....  *rolls eyes*  I'll get you to let go of me ;-)  I have my ways...  Besides, if this isn't a *date* we're going to have to put at least one seat between us anyway - duh!  >**I know, I realize that. What I meant by my freedom is that I've never had someone like you that I want to spend SO MUCH time with. I'd rather be with you than do a lot of the stuff I used to do. I'm sure that after a while we'll get "satisfied" with each other enough that we'll go back to doing our old stuff. Enjoying old hobbies. But right now, I am completely and totally in to you!   Yeah, that *infatuation* phase will fade out a little bit.  I've never tried it for the long haul - I don't know what it feels like if it lasts longer than a few months, to be honest.  But I see little old couples holding hands at the zoo and whatnot, so I don't see how it ever really goes away...  Dunno - this is a question I can't answer!  >**I know. I can handle the girly side, but she was a little different than what I had been dealing with up until now. It's ok. I LIKE the girly side! TRUST ME! And yes, you have a 50% say in the path we take. You always will. We're both stubborn, but we're both smart too. We'll do ok! :-D :-) :-D   Yeah, I think we will :-D  >**YES!!! I'm glad that you finally realize how much I really do want to be here, how much I really am not going anywhere, and how much I REALLY DO LOVE YOU! Be calm! I'm glad I can give you that!   I like it!  I love it!  It's great - it's new and exciting and good!  I feel like you're sooooo good for me - I always kinda dug on the bad boys - women have a tendency to do that, ya know?  Cause I was a bad girl.  I can't date goodie-two-shoes, now can I?  ;)  LOL  >**Thank you. But understand that I'm NOT outside. I'm as inside as any of us. I am very intelligent. I am very level headed. But I also am biased like a MFer! I can and will talk to Paul, but remember that if any issue comes up, I'm taking YOUR SIDE. That will not be the best scenario... I'm glad that I can help so far tho. I'm glad that Paul has Cindy to confide in. I can't and won't be his counselor. I can only do that for you.  I know.  But I mean as far as the advice you do give about Paul...  I'm IN HERE - you're not.  You can think about things without getting sooooo angry (unlike me!)  You help calm me down - that's why I called you the other night when I was about to *kill* Paul - I knew I was off the handle a little bit, but you had a clear headed answer for me.  That's what I mean :)  >**I got my own issues right now with Karla. She's really trying to make me think. And I'm really trying to help her deal with this.  She thinks I'm her soul mate, and has said so plainly. She's worried that if I'm her soul mate, what does that leave her in the significant other category? I'm trying to help her, but I'm beginning think I'm only making her pain worse by seeing her and talking to her :-/   Well, she needs time.  You've basically got it nailed, as far as I can see...  Maybe extracting yourself would be the best thing you could do for her, but I don't know her well enough to say if she's *stable* enough for that or not.  I think a slow process would probably be better.  But you know, if she pushes too hard, you'll have to bail.  As bad as that sucks, you know it will only do her good in the long run.  Have you mentioned to her that letting go of you is probably going to make things better for her romantically?  I think she's got a part of you stuck in her heart - some silly false hopes, old dreams, the whole lot.  And she can't let anybody else in - at least not anybody GOOD for her - until she moves you out of that spot and puts you somewhere else...  (???)  I'd offer my services - maybe she'll see that she's going to GAIN a friend instead of lose you?  I don't know - maybe she'd do good from seeing you *happy* with me?  I know she's scared for you too - which is a part of the equation that you didn't mention - she's terrified that I'm going to hurt you - so maybe it's also a "salvation" mechanism in her?  "If I can take Dennis back, Shannon can't hurt him!"  If she wants to talk, give her my email, phone #, IM, whatever - I'll do what I can...  I like her, I feel for her, I really want to give her a big hug...  I don't know - would it help for her to see that I am a good and generous person with nothing but the best intentions?  I don't know - let me know if I can help...  >**(grace)Thank you! I'll do my best. I don't know how I learned it. I'm just me. Damn you've given me a lot of compliments! More than anyone else ever. You must like me or something ;-)   Nope, I don't like you at all :)  Pffft - yeah right!  Well, it's NOON - I'm counting the hours and minutes and seconds till I get my hugs and kisses!  It is a nearly perfect day!  Just BEAUTIFUL!  I like weather like this :-D   TTYS,   Shannon

      From:   "Shannon Yevcak"   To:   spoolboy@autospeed.com Subject:   Your number! Date:   Sun 07/14/02 01:53 PM     First off, I have to tell you **again** that I had a TON of fun with you yesterday!  I love spending time with you - it's even better than getting an email from ya, if that's possible!  LOL, and I was bored at work, so I read horoscopes online - LOL - just to test the theory that you see whatever you project on to them...  I think that's true!  Um, except for the part that said, "July 10th will see a New Moon in Cancer signaling a time for new beginnings -- or, in your case, a higher level of emotional commitment to romance and love."  Whoa!  Yeah, I'm projecting, but uh, I worked midnights on the 10th :-D   *hmmmmm!*  And I was bored again, so I called you and left a message on your machine :-D  Why is your number so easy?  LOL - I *treid* not to memorize it!  Cause I knew I'd call all the time if I did...  But it's toooooo easy!  You need more numbers - too many 5's or something...  Hahaha, and if I could think of *any* reason whatsoever, I'd call you again RIGHT NOW.  The only thing I can think of is that I just want to hear your voice - meh, but I'll hear your machine's voice...  :-D  Hehe!  Ooooh great!  Blaise got a digicam!  Thank GAWD he's leaving tomorrow!!!  (That's so mean!  Bad me!)  Oooooh, found one!  "You and your Pisces are a pair who could outlast all others. You've finally found the perfect sympathetic ear to share all your tales of trouble and woe. Or maybe you could opt for a slow dance around the room with your Pisces companion instead. It all depends on what you're in the mood for. Nevertheless, you've finally found the right person to share all of your emotional experiences with.  Try not to overdo it with the emotional ups and downs. There is only so much even a caring Pisces partner can take. Once you get the ball rolling in the love department, you and your Pisces lover should be on the fast track to a very caring, highly romantic and certainly long-lasting affair."  :-) PROJECT!     I'm stuck in *happy*  - uh, shift me or something?  LOL - don't worry, the drive home will be enough to shift me all by itself :(  I'll be ok though :)  TTFN  ***pinch***  Shannon

      From:&nbsp;&nbsp; dennis   To:&nbsp;&nbsp; marfells@hotmail.com  Subject:&nbsp;&nbsp; No subject? wtf?  Date:&nbsp;&nbsp; Tue 07/16/02 05:14 PM   I'm feeling quite a bit like I'm trying to stand on a razor blade. I've  lost 5 pounds (not such a bad thing) in the past week (bad thing!)  since I've told Paul it's over. My tight pants are a little loose! I  don't want to buy new small clothes. The bummer is that I never seem to  loose any weight below the waist :x It all comes off up top :x Hehe,  do they make negative bra sizes? This is really hard. The good of that  is that I'm going through it!   **I know you are going through a lot. Don't be afraid to lean on me when  things get beyond your limit. I'm here for you and ALWAYS will be.   **Don't loose TOO MUCH weight! I like you just like you are! :-D Trust  me, although your appearance is a VERY NICE BONUS, I would love you just  the same if you weren't as attractive. I think you have a long way to  go before you need a negative cup size, lol. And have you heard me  complain about *anything*????!!!! NO!!! Did I mention that I thought you  had a nice ass? :-D :-)  kissing you> :-D   I have had strange dreams for the past few days. Yesterday on the couch  and twice last night. The one yesterday was some kind of sadistic  lesbian freaky weird thing. Disturbing because I don't swing that way  at all! I'm thinking it's a reflection of implied or inferred misogyny  in my life with Paul... Then the first bad one last night (which I  remembered clearly when I woke up, but is fading now) involved very  graphic pictures of dead bodies. I awoke in a cold sweat from this one,  and grasped out for Paul. But the bed was empty. So I curled up,  wrapped myself in my blanket, and prayed for the pictures (which were  really really gross!) to leave. Did some breathing and got calm enough  to go back to sleep. The third one escapes me - I don't remember the  content much, except it was sexual again, and disturbing enough to wake  me up about 8 minutes before the alarm went off. I hate that shit! :x   **I'm so sorry that you are having bad dreams. I wish I was there to  hold and comfort you. Snuggling is one of my specialties :-)   There - done bitching about my sucky life. Don't worry that I'm not "going  through" this - I am! I'm lucky enough to have a problem that has put  me on the couch more than a few times, and I've got a ton of coping  skills at my disposal. I used to play with my shrink - Sherrie. She  was neat, but I was able to outsmart her most of the time. She never  really got to the meat of any of my issues - but I felt better after I  talked to her anyway.   **Yeah. If you ever need to talk to me about anything, I'm here for you.  I'm not a shrink, but I listen pretty well :-) And if you thought you  needed to see a counselor, I'd go with you if you wanted me to. Whatever  you need, I'm here for you. :-)   I think most of this email needs no reply - it's just mushy gushy stuff  - we agree on it all, we're disgusting - LOL - I *hate* lovey stuff :-D   **Um..yeah. I hate mushy stuff too! YUCK! POOEY!    **Now fuckin kiss me! ;-)   So, what are you saying? You won't dance with me??? :(   **I really DON'T dance, but I'd dance with you :-) Just like you're  going to get me to ride roller coasters with you :-)   >**:-D There you go apologizing again! Remember that feather??? You're  gonna get it!   PLEEEEEEASE!?!?!?!?!????? Stop teasing me!   **Did I tickle you enough to somewhat satisfy you yet? ;-) If I had been  thinking, I'd have brought a feather! Maybe my tongue will get it done?   **I just had a funny thought about last night. I could have stopped at  some point and grabbed my flashlight ;-) So I could see you better! :-D   >I wonder if the people listening to your radios will know you're in  love?   Probably - if they're perceptive. LOL - now I see some little old  Granny calling to get the forecast and getting a knowing smile from  hearing me... Hehe! *cute!!!*   **:-D :-)   You're MOM thinks you're in love :p   **Yeah, but she's even more of a hopeless romantic than I am! It's a  good thing that my Dad is too ;-)   Yep, I'm in - you've got me, I've always trusted YOU - now I trust US.   **:-) Me too. :-)   >**(sorry)Yes, it is a handy word, but don't feel like you ever have to  apologize to me for loving me or wanting to reach out to me. That's what  I'm here for. I'm going to get you to kick your self esteem up a few  notches yet....:-)   You really think I've got a self-esteem problem? I don't - I've got  massive quantities of it. I'm in an unsusal situation, under a lot of  stress, making decisions that are **critical** to the rest of my life,  and more importantly to the rest of my son's life. You expect me to do  that without a whiff of self-doubt? That would be wrong, selfish and  cruel. Plus I'm dealing with the constant put-downs I've been  submitting to for a few years - they never really affected ME - they  made ME go into hiding. Give me some time to adjust, would ya? :p   **I don't think you have a self-esteem prob, I was just teasing. I know  how strong you are. I can feel it when I'm around you. I know you're  going through a lot of shit. I understand your self-doubt and have a  fair amount of it myself at times. The point of all of this was for you  to understand that you don't have to say you're sorry when you're not  doing anything wrong :-)   We did ok - we're doing ok, I don't doubt that we'll continue to do OK.  The only thing I've ever tried to do is "the best I can." Sometimes  it works, sometimes it doesn't, but it sure does reduce regrets.   **Yes. I still have NO regrets. And at this point, I would have a hard  time ever regretting doing anything with you.   >**I'll show you where the beef is ;-) It's in your coffee and you can  trade it for a throttle body! LOL! :-D   Yeah, BEEF is going to be a theme for us, isn't it? Grrrrrrreat!   **Hehe... "BEEF! It's what's for dinner!"   >**You're such a tease! ;-) You're going to get tickled really bad if  you keep asking for it!   What do I have to do to get you to make good on this promise?   **Just keep asking for it ;-) The anticipation is often the best part,  hehe!   >**I'm glad that you can feel comfortable like that with me. It will be  tough for me to be naked in front of you at first. I'm very self  conscious about my body. BUT, I will feel more comfortable in front of  you than anyone else. And it won't take long for me to get to 100% in  that comfortable department   Meh, I'll close my eyes, ok? You're *cute* when you're insecure. I  like it a lot :) It makes me want to take care of you :)   **I felt TOTALLY comfortable last night with you. I was just at times  not sure exactly how far I wanted to go. And you know my default  settings are very conservative. Just think about what I was considering....;-)   >**And you ARE HOT NOW! GET USED TO IT!   I'll try. I explained my body image waaaaay back in the beginning-ish  part of this whole series of emails. It comes and goes - some days  women feel HOT. Some days we feel like shit. ALL of us. But I know my  flaws, I know my good parts. I just don't feel inadequate anymore :)   **I'm very glad that you don't feel inadequate! You are AWESOME! :-D   >**I think you are MUCH hotter than Kim Basinger...;-) She's too tall  and lanky. She just doesn't "do it" for me.   Really? She's actually very attractive! She's got a neat face, not "classic"  beauty. Big sultry lips and *laser beam* eyes.   urlLink http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Agency/3160/basinger12.jpg    I think she'd qualify as "hot."   **She's not bad, but I like you better! She's built funny IMHO, just not  my type as far as that goes.   Ok, well, so far my work hasn't stopped me from getting in touch with  you somehow or another. And I AM working - a lot! I won't let another  man hold me back from living MY life - been there, done that. I won't  let you distract me from "fixing" myself - getting back on more stable  ground. I need you to help me - I don't want to become dependant on you,  but I really need someone to talk to. And you UNDERSTAND me!!!   **I'm not saying that you can't talk to me! FAR FROM IT! I'm just saying  that if you DO slack off, I understand. Don't feel pressured to spend  time with me, you have a life too ;-) I'm so glad that I can help you!  :-)   >**No, don't do that! Anything but SEXUAL ENERGY!!!   Ok, ok, I'll put it into my CLEANING urge instead, ok? Happy now?   **Sure! You can come over and help me clean my room!!!   >**You didn't react to that in the way I thought you would.   What were you expecting? I'm curious? You shouldn't try to read my  mind - you'll psyche yourself out... ;)   **I was a little scared that you might be frightened/worried/etc about  my lack of experiences when I put it in such a bright light.   >**Thank you. Thank you so much for appreciating my weaknesses along  with my strengths. I want to be with you so much right now. This is what  love is about. It's about loving all of someone, even the bad parts,  the weak parts, the parts that are hardest to love. Loving those parts  is true love.   You're welcome... I expect nothing but the same from you, as I know I'm  very weak and cranky and wishy-washy right now, and probably will be  for a while to come.   **Even at the worst I've seen you, it still makes me happier to be  around you than anyone else!   >**As I typed that above, I actually was a bit teary eyed. It hurts so  bad sometimes to think about how long I've been without someone to call  my own. Without someone to love. There were nights that I layed in bed  and cried for someone to hold, to have, to be mine. I have wanted  someone to share my life with for so long, but I've never found anyone  that I felt like I could actually be with..... not even Karla..... but  now I've met you.   Dennis, I have done the same thing. But you really were just alone, I  was *married* - thinking these things as I lay awake in my marriage bed,  completely unsatisfied.

This is  what I get for all of the hurt I caused Paul in the beginning of our  relationship. Maybe this is God's way of getting me back?"   **Thank you for sharing that with me. You should never have to feel like  that. You are worth a lot! You deserve to be happy! You are a human too.  You punished yourself, and that punishment seems very harsh for the "crime".   Oh well, we can improvise. LOL - walking sideways. Yeaaaaah.... *rolls  eyes* I'll get you to let go of me ;-) I have my ways... Besides, if  this isn't a *date* we're going to have to put at least one seat  between us anyway - duh!   **What would you have done if I hadn't let go???? And was that a date???  We definitely DID NOT have a spacer seat :-) It was VERY NICE to be  with you and we were very lucky to get a theater with the fold up  armrests. Those rock don't they?   >**I know, I realize that. What I meant by my freedom is that I've never  had someone like you that I want to spend SO MUCH time with. I'd rather  be with you than do a lot of the stuff I used to do.

I do not see either of those  things fading. BUT I do see us getting more comfortable with this  situation, trusting it more, and maybe being together enough that we are  "satisfied" at times and able to get back to our "regularly scheduled"  lives, albeit much HAPPIER lives! I'm telling you this, right now you  are pretty much all I can think about. You DO distract me. BUT it's not  your fault. You don't MAKE me think about you. You don't MAKE me love  you;-) I just do!   I like it! I love it! It's great - it's new and exciting and good! I  feel like you're sooooo good for me - I always kinda dug on the bad boys  - women have a tendency to do that, ya know? Cause I was a bad girl.  I can't date goodie-two-shoes, now can I? ;) LOL   **I'm not perfect myself.... I'm not a "bad guy", but I do have a bit of  a "bad side" :-) I wonder how well you'd enjoy me if you had not had  your previous experiences with bad boys? Would you appreciate me as much?  I don't know. Just interesting things to think about. Our histories  have made us into the people we are, and the people we are are perfect  for one another. The bad we've experienced made us appreciate this good  SO MUCH!!!!   >**I'm as inside as any of us. But I also am biased like a MFer!

I can only wait and see if it's  temporary or not. I hope this is a good thing for her. I do beleive that  you are right and now that I'm "out of the way" or "out of the game"  she can focus on making herself happy and fill the space that I  overlapped now, because it is empty.   Well, it's NOON - I'm counting the hours and minutes and seconds till I  get my hugs and kisses!   **Silly girls... just counting the seconds.... :-) Us guys count the  nanoseconds!   **So did you get enough hugs, kisses, and whatnot for the time expended?  ;-) I'm guessing not since we had to see each other last night again,  lol!   It is a nearly perfect day! Just BEAUTIFUL! I like weather like this  :-D   **YEP! ME TOO!! I have my very own personal Weather Goddess! ;-)   **And after seeing you last night, goddess is very right.   Dennis

Date:&nbsp;&nbsp; Tue 07/16/02 04:19 PM    First off, I have to tell you **again** that I had a TON of fun with you  yesterday! I love spending time with you - it's even better than  getting an email from ya, if that's possible!   **ME TOO! I'm getting spoiled tho. The more I see you, the less I can  just settle for sitting here and typing you an email.... the less fun  these are to type :-/   LOL, and I was bored at work, so I read horoscopes online - LOL - just  to test the theory that you see whatever you project on to them... I  think that's true! Um, except for the part that said, "July 10th will  see a New Moon in Cancer signaling a time for new beginnings -- or, in  your case, a higher level of emotional commitment to romance and love."  Whoa! Yeah, I'm projecting, but uh, I worked midnights on the 10th :-D    *hmmmmm!*   **I tell you, the more I think about this whole situation, the more I  wonder how much you and I really had to do with anything, lol! I feel  like I've been scooped up by a big hand and thrown into the mix with you.  And that's a GOOD feeling!   And I was bored again, so I called you and left a message on your  machine :-D Why is your number so easy? LOL - I *treid* not to  memorize it! Cause I knew I'd call all the time if I did... But it's  toooooo easy! You need more numbers - too many 5's or something...   **Yeah, and your frickin number is the same as a light bulb! 1056! Why  is that so easy to remember? 618-258-1056 I had it memorized the first  time I ever called you. Call all you want, as long as you can afford the  long distance! If I'm busy, just leave me a message :-)   Hahaha, and if I could think of *any* reason whatsoever, I'd call you  again RIGHT NOW. The only thing I can think of is that I just want to  hear your voice - meh, but I'll hear your machine's voice... :-D Hehe!   **I was thinking about recording my voice on there "Hello, this is  Dennis, leave a message, blah blah blah" but then you'd be calling even  more ;-)   Oooooh, found one!   "You and your Pisces are a pair who could outlast all others. You've  finally found the perfect sympathetic ear to share all your tales of  trouble and woe. Or maybe you could opt for a slow dance around the room  with your Pisces companion instead. It all depends on what you're in  the mood for. Nevertheless, you've finally found the right person to  share all of your emotional experiences with.   Try not to overdo it with the emotional ups and downs. There is only so  much even a caring Pisces partner can take. Once you get the ball  rolling in the love department, you and your Pisces lover should be on  the fast track to a very caring, highly romantic and certainly long-lasting  affair."   **That sounds so right on when I think about how all this feels that it  almost makes me wonder if I'm crazy! And in case you can't tell, I'm  VERY tollerant, but I'll let you know right away if things are getting  out of hand. :-D   :-) PROJECT!    **Ahh... you just want to BE balled! lol ;-)   I'm stuck in *happy* - uh, shift me or something?   **Show me where your shift knob is.... and I'll show you mine!   ***pinch***   **ouch!   **KISS**   Dennis

      From:&nbsp;&nbsp; dennis   To:&nbsp;&nbsp; marfells@hotmail.com  Subject:&nbsp;&nbsp; Twofor?? Threesome!!!:-D  Date:&nbsp;&nbsp; Wed 07/17/02 05:22 PM    I know! What am I going to do at work without Dennis emails? Ohhhh,  yeah, I guess I'll just daydream about Dennis :-D That'll work!   **Well, I don't think you'll have to do "without", maybe just ween back  a bit is all :-D And daydream all you want... I do! I haven't driven to  work without getting an erection in 2 weeks now....   >**I tell you, the more I think about this whole situation, the more I  wonder how much you and I really had to do with anything, lol! I feel  like I've been scooped up by a big hand and thrown into the mix with you.  And that's a GOOD feeling!   Well, we sure did a lot of fucking work for "nothing" Shoot, if I knew  I could have gotten here without all of that stress, I would have done  it happily. Hehe, and we'd have hooked up by now too! Shit!   **Well, you know how we are.... we HAD to stress;-) And we probably  really DO and DID have a lot to do with where we are, I was just "wondering  out loud" and thinking about how unlikely all of this has been! How far  we've come DESPITE "knowing better", lol :-) And just how lucky I have  been for this to have worked out this way :-)   **Speaking of hooking up..... one of the reasons I stopped and "restrained"  myself the other night was because I wanted to give myself a couple of  days to reflect and see if my concience would trigger regret or guilt.  ALL CLEAR! Only thing that's getting triggered is the hand to the  forehead mechanism.   >**I was thinking about recording my voice on there "Hello, this is  Dennis, leave a message, blah blah blah" but then you'd be calling even  more ;-)   Ok, so when are you changing your message ;) LOL - naw, it's ok.   **;-) Call me and find out! ;-)   I LOVE talking with you. You make everything better.   **:-D Thank you! I do my best! I'm glad that I can help! You do the same  for me!   Hrm, I never even thought about my phone number before.... You know  something funny? My # at my parent's house was the last four digits of  Jim's mom's license plate (3872). He'd sometimes have to sit out by the  car to call me - when I was getting the drunk dial. LOL - weird stuff,  you make me remember some weird stuff.   **WEIRDO! ;-)   >**(be the ball)Ahh... you just want to BE balled! lol ;-)   God yes I do! Hurry up and fuck me already! Heh. :-D Or don't - take  your time - either way - I'm good :) Just being around you is good  enough - I mean it's GREAT! But then again... there is that bad part  of me that wants you RIGHT NOW...   **Beleive me, your encouragement is not going unnoticed ;-)  to see bulge in shorts>   >**KISS**  Haven't you got enough of those yet? Damn! :-D   *kiss* *kiss* *kiss* *kiss* *KISS* *nose print*   ***KISS* *kiss* *kiss* *kiss* *kiss* *kiss* *kiss* *lick* *NIBBLE* *kiss*  *rub* *SUCK* *kiss* *squeeze* *bite* *KISS*..... to be continued!   Thanks! Keep reminding me - I've got an independent streak too... So  sometimes if I'm pissy, maybe grabbing me and giving me a nice hug will  help me out :)   **I tend to be independant at times too. I will "take care" of you ;-)   Pffft. I know. You're all vain and shit and can't date no oogly chicks.   **Thats right! How could I show off an oogly girl? Good thing I snagged  a hottie like you!!!!! :-D   >**I'm so sorry that you are having bad dreams. I wish I was there to  hold and comfort you. Snuggling is one of my specialties :-)   Gawd I wish you were there too! You can't know how much I wish for it  :) I haven't had any more bad dreams - vivid dreams, but not bad ones.  All day today I just dreamed about you... *sigh* Damn I had fun with  you last night!   **You know... once you start staying the night at my apt... well, you  might as well move in! lol   **I had LOTSSSSS!!!!! of fun with you! I forsee LOTSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!! of  fun in our future!!!!!!!!   >**Did I tickle you enough to somewhat satisfy you yet? ;-) If I had  been thinking, I'd have brought a feather! Maybe my tongue will get it  done?   *falls off chair*   I'm not going to be able to process this too much right now. Hehe, at  the moment, I'm stuck in a "was that real?" mode. And I know it was!  :-D That has to have been one of the best nights of my life. Seriously!  Just everything - you make me so happy - I wouldn't have changed a  thing, not rewritten a single note of that song. *sigh* I love you.   **That *could* possibly be THE best time I've ever had.... I love you  :-) I would not have changed a thing either!   God, is it possible? Can this really be?   **I hear you! I feel a little like that every time I think about you....  You are so wonderful! Wonder if we can outdo ourselves next time? ;-)   >**I just had a funny thought about last night. I could have stopped at  some point and grabbed my flashlight ;-) So I could see you better! :-D   You could see just fine. I liked it that way - just enough light, but  not too much - not enough to make me uncomfortable. I don't have a "spotlight  on Shannon" kind of body. I'm just me, and I'm damn glad you like me  so much!   **You are GORGEOUS! I was only teasing about the flashlight, but the  thought did pop into my head in a humorous manner right before I typed  that ;-) You know us guys are VISUAL! ESPECIALLY me!   Ok, here's the deal. "Sorry" is a thing that I say. Get over it. It's  called "being polite." If there is any way I can get out of a sticky /  uncomfortable / annoying / confusing situation by taking my share of  the blame (saying sorry) I'll do it. I say it automatically. I don't  mean "OH GOD I'M SOOOOOO SORRY" So you're going to have to get used to  hearing it, OK?   :x   ^^^attempt at bitchiness^^^   **Failed attempt ;-) And don't be sorry that you failed :-P :-D   >**Yes. I still have NO regrets. And at this point, I would have a hard  time ever regretting doing anything with you.   Mmm, so, Dennis, what are you going to do to me??? ;)   **You'll see soon enough! :-)   >**Just keep asking for it ;-) The anticipation is often the best part,  hehe!   Anticipation is good, but I wouldn't say it's the BEST part- ya know?   **Yeah, you're right, especially under these circumstances...;-)   >**I felt TOTALLY comfortable last night with you. I was just at times  not sure exactly how far I wanted to go. And you know my default  settings are very conservative. Just think about what I was considering....;-)    Hey, you know, I'm HAPPY! I had a ton of fun,   **MEE TOOOO!!!!   and honestly, if you would have wanted me, you could have had me. A few  times :-D I told you a while back, I'm yours like that - you just need  to ask.   **You know, when you say that it makes me want to ask ;-) And I think I'll  ask non-verbally.... :-D   Or just tease me until I attack you... I was close a few times last  night - but I didn't.   **It makes me laugh every time you say "attack"! I'm sure you will show  me "attack mode Shannon" soon enough ;-) Cause I am gonna tease you :-D   I'm getting really good at being satisfied with what I get. It's new  too, not *expecting* anything - new for me. It's really kind of nice -  to know that if I don't want to, I don't have to - no pressure.   **Yes. No pressure is good :-)   But of course I'm willing to give what I get, which means, I guess, that  it's your turn next time :p   **OH really?!?! :-D Red Roof here we come!!!!!!!   Good. Yeah, for a few minutes I was digging on you kneeling down like  you were. But that was new too - cause I trust you so much.   **Yes, I don't mind kneeling down for you at all because I know you'll  return the favor. ;-) I do "worship" you in a way :-) Your power trip  was somewhat justified, because I would do ANYTHING for you. I know you  would do the same for me.   I was trying to make it pleasant for you, let's put it that way.   **Hmmm? What does that mean exactly??? :-)   I've never felt pressured to spend time with you. At least not by YOU.  My own little need to be around you constantly takes care of that! I  LOVE you - love being with you, talking to you, cuddling with you,  getting all naked on your hood - I like it all :) And there's more  where that came from - how fucking exciting is that???   **VERY EXCITING! I feel the same way!  to you? lol!   I'm trying to stop it. It's hard - Paul and I had a big fight tonight.  I just can't stand it - the person I am around him - the way he draws  out every bad thing in me all at once. The way I try like hell to be "adult"  and he kicks me down to the mentality of a 12 year old. Everytime it  gets emotional, I have to fight back EVERY emotion that was put in to  the last seven years. I can't do that - not with him acting as childish  as he does around me. I can't wait to be away - at least I'll have  time to hide my emotional side and calm myself down / steel my resolve  before I have to deal with him.   **Thank you for sharing that with me. I really beleive that you will be  free of this in a timely manner.   Which is totally opposite of you. Somehow you draw out all of the best  in me. I want so badly to be a better person for you - I know I'm ok  when you're around, but I still have so much *icky stuff* that has  become such a habit - well, I think it's worth working on...   **Thank you for being honest. I will help you to work on any *icky stuff*  that you have to deal with. I'm very glad that I can bring that out in  you :-DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD   Yeah, but we would have coped with the arm rest too. YES, dammit, it  WAS a date. I'm sure of it. It felt like a date - I even dressed up!  I wore HEELS for you ;) That means it was totally a date.   **Wow! I went on my first real date with a hot chick!!! :-D  idiotic grin> I love you!   Trusting it more? I can't trust any more! 100% is all I've got in me,  is that enough? Every day I get a little bit more secure - knowing that  I don't have to have you - I really want to have you. It's better to  want and be wanted than it is to feel so fucking needy.   **Yes, that's what I mean. Needy is being replaced in both of us with  trust and true love. I was needy too... I wanted someone to be with SO  badly.... I was as guilty as anyone.   Needy is bad, mostly. I had a little needy phase with you - a clingy  icky couple of days. But now I'm really getting more comfortable -  everytime I think about you (hehe, like constantly!) I feel more  confident. You distract me too, and yeah, I do kinda need distractions  right now.   **I'm glad that I can help. It's so nice to be wanted :-)   But you feel like a healthy distraction - a lot better choice than  heroin or something.   **Yeah, a better choice than heroin, just like methamphetamines! :-P   Fuck - you're the one who has the limited history - so you tell me how  it is - do you appreciate me?   **YES!!!! I appreciate you!!! I'm sure you can tell!!!! :-D   You're what I always wanted. Plain and simple. Exactly what I was  dreaming about - and here you are in the flesh, wanting me back just as  much as I want you! *exciting* I would have been able to deal with not  knowing what else is out there - cause you're, like IT, as far as I'm  concerned. I still don't know what else is out there.   **That's exactly how I feel. You are IT for me too!!!   The last time I was on the scene, everybody was under 18... So maybe *every*  adult relationship is like ours? Highly doubt it. Don't care to find  out. I'm satisfied! :-D   **Yeah, sure, EVERY adult relationship is like ours......NOT!!!! I don't  care to find out either!!! Happy here! Satisfied!   Yeah, I talked to her a little bit this evening. She seems to be ok -  at least taking a good view of things now. I never doubted that she  would, if she let herself, you know? Sometimes you kinda get stuck on  something - a feeling, whatever, and don't get yourself out of it for a  good long while - way past when you should have dealt with it, you're  still hanging on for some unknown reason. Then one day you wake up,  like, DUH - and you move on. She seems like she's thinking it through,  says she has to adjust. Yeah, she'll make it. And I think I do really  like her :) She's a cool one!   **Cool. It was very nice of you to talk with her. I bet that if the  jealousy can be put aside, you two will become friends :-)   >**And after seeing you last night, goddess is very right.   I'm glad you're pleased! Very glad! Thank you so much for liking me -  all of me. Uh, thanks for licking me? Hehe! I'm silly :) You know,  it feels really good to have someone to think things like that about me.    **The pleasure is all mine :-) Liking and licking ;-) It does feel very  good not only to have someone who thinks nice things about me, but to  have someone to think nice things about :-)   Maybe you really will get me believing it afterall... We'll see, that's  a tall order.   **I'll do my best!!! :-D   I love you I love you I love you!   *stands on desk, raises arms, and shouts "I LOVE YOU, DENNIS"*   *gets down, tries to act like nothing happened*   **If you keep that up, you're going to make it rain again....Weather  Goddess! ;-)   **Yeah, people acted pretty strange at Jetcorp too when I did that last  week....;-) I guess maybe I shouldn't have climbed on top of the hangar?   **I LOVE YOU!   Shoot, there you are IMing me finally!!! Time to finish this email!   **Hey, when you stand on the desk and call out for me like Superman, how  can I not appear? :-D   *kiss*   **KISS* *kiss* *kiss* *kiss* *kiss*!!!!!   Hurry up and see me, ok? Maybe I'll, uh, get naked or something!   **With a possibility like that, how can I stand to wait??!!??!! And I  think it's spelled "nekid" :-P Yes, I'm sticking my tongue out, whatchu  gonna do bout it?   **I AM hurrying to see you!!!!! :-D CAN'T WAIT!!!!! :-)   Ok, it's 4:15 in the morning.   You're asleep, I'm working with a bunch of **boring** ass people!   **So what's new??? lol!   I'm browsing OT, and dammit if this isn't the funniest fucking thing I've  ever seen!!!    urlLink http://forums.off-topic.net/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=348055&amp;perpage=25&amp;pagenumber=1    Of course it probably won't be so funny tomorrow, but right now I'm  ROTFLMMFAO - I'm like crying and shit.   **Yep, pretty funny thread! So, did you dress up like a ninja yet??? I  can't wait to see myself in the mirror! :-D   Dennis

Yeah, but we would have coped with the arm rest too.&nbsp; YES, dammit, it WAS a date.&nbsp; I'm sure of it.&nbsp; It felt like a date - I even dressed up!&nbsp; I wore HEELS for you ;)&nbsp; That means it was totally a date.&nbsp; And if you wouldn't have let go, I would have been ok.&nbsp; That's not something you're likely to get an honest complaint about.&nbsp; I'm totally with you - it was very nice to be with you.   >**I like you a WHOLE LOT! I LOVE YOU! I do not see either of those things fading. BUT I do see us getting more comfortable with this situation, trusting it more, and maybe being together enough that we are "satisfied" at times and able to get back to our "regularly scheduled" lives, albeit much HAPPIER lives! I'm telling you this, right now you are pretty much all I can think about. You DO distract me. BUT it's not your fault. You don't MAKE me think about you. You don't MAKE me love you;-) I just do!   Trusting it more?&nbsp; I can't trust any more!&nbsp; 100% is all I've got in me, is that enough?&nbsp; Every day I get a little bit more secure - knowing that I don't have to have you - I really want to have you.&nbsp; It's better to want and be wanted than it is to feel so fucking needy.&nbsp; Needy is bad, mostly.&nbsp; I had a little needy phase with you - a clingy icky couple of days.&nbsp; But now I'm really getting more comfortable - everytime I think about you (hehe, like constantly!) I feel more confident.&nbsp; You distract me too, and yeah, I do kinda need distractions right now.&nbsp; But you feel like a healthy distraction - a lot better choice than heroin or something.   >**I'm not perfect myself.... I'm not a "bad guy", but I do have a bit of a "bad side" :-) I wonder how well you'd enjoy me if you had not had your previous experiences with bad boys? Would you appreciate me as much? I don't know. Just interesting things to think about. Our histories have made us into the people we are, and the people we are are perfect for one another. The bad we've experienced made us appreciate this good SO MUCH!!!!   Fuck - you're the one who has the&nbsp;limited history - so you tell me how it is - do you appreciate me?&nbsp; You're what I always wanted.&nbsp; Plain and simple.&nbsp; Exactly what I was dreaming about - and here you are in the flesh, wanting me back just as much as I want you!&nbsp; *exciting*&nbsp; I would have been able to deal with not knowing what else is out there - cause you're, like IT, as far as I'm concerned.&nbsp; I still don't know what else is out there.&nbsp; The last time I was on the scene, everybody was under 18...&nbsp; So maybe *every* adult relationship is like ours?&nbsp; Highly doubt it.&nbsp; Don't care to find out.&nbsp; I'm satisfied!&nbsp; :-D   >**(Karla)I think this issue has started resolving itself. She seems much more well adjusted right now. I can only wait and see if it's temporary or not. I hope this is a good thing for her. I do beleive that you are right and now that I'm "out of the way" or "out of the game" she can focus on making herself happy and fill the space that I overlapped now, because it is empty.   Yeah, I talked to her a little bit this evening.&nbsp; She seems to be ok - at least taking a good view of things now.&nbsp; I never doubted that she would, if she let herself, you know?&nbsp; Sometimes you kinda get stuck on something - a feeling, whatever, and don't get yourself out of it for a good long while - way past when you should have dealt with it, you're still hanging on for some unknown reason.&nbsp; Then one day you wake up, like, DUH - and you move on.&nbsp; She seems like she's thinking it through, says she has to adjust.&nbsp; Yeah, she'll make it.&nbsp; And I think I do really like her :)&nbsp; She's a cool one!   >**So did you get enough hugs, kisses, and whatnot for the time expended? ;-) I'm guessing not since we had to see each other last night again, lol!   Well, I'll make do...&nbsp; I guess...   >**And after seeing you last night, goddess is very right.   I'm glad you're pleased!&nbsp; Very glad!&nbsp; Thank you so much for liking me - all of me.&nbsp; Uh, thanks for licking me?&nbsp; Hehe!&nbsp; I'm silly :)&nbsp; You know, it feels really good to have someone to think things like that about me.&nbsp; Maybe you really will get me believing it afterall...&nbsp; We'll see, that's a tall order.   I love you I love you I love you!  *stands on desk, raises arms, and shouts "I LOVE YOU, DENNIS"*  *gets down, tries to act like nothing happened*  Shoot, there you are IMing me finally!!!&nbsp; Time to finish this email!  *kiss*  Hurry up and see me, ok?&nbsp; Maybe I'll, uh, get naked or something!

I do! I haven't driven to work without  getting an erection in 2 weeks now....   Me too! Uh, er, uh, that's not right!   That's so cute :) So do you ever manage to think about me without  getting one? Or are you *really* all about the sex? ;)   **I LIKE SEX! I'm a horny guy. Bet you didn't know that ;-) You are SO  much more than just someone to have sex with! And you are very special  in that you are the only woman I have ever met that could acheive an  erection! ;-):-P If I had an erection every time I thought about you I  would have an erection 95% of my day, because that's how much I think  about you. I somehow manage to restrain myself and only have an erection  about 25%-45% of the day :-)   >**ALL CLEAR! Only thing that's getting triggered is the hand to the  forehead mechanism.   Doh!   **YEP! "DOH! I coulda got laid!"   Don't worry about it, it was *perfect* just the way it was. :-D I'm  totally satisfied with what I got - I'm getting really good at this! I'm  not feeling guilty either. Not a bit! Like I said, totally satisfied  :-D   **COOL! I'm ecstatic that you feel that way!!!!   >***KISS* *kiss* *kiss* *kiss* *kiss* *kiss* *kiss* *lick* *NIBBLE* *kiss*  *rub* *SUCK* *kiss* *squeeze* *bite* *KISS*   *moan* *whimper* *wiggle*   >*..... to be continued!   *groan* *cry* *grin*   TEASE!   **Yes, tease for sure ;-)   **.....*grasp* *tweak* *suck* *KISS* *squeeze* *rub* *KISS* *twiddle* *tickle*  *pinch* *KISS* *kneed* *teeth gently dragging* *tongue sliding* *pubic  hair against cheeks and nose* *tastebuds on flesh*........   >**(possible?)I hear you! I feel a little like that every time I think  about you.... You are so wonderful! Wonder if we can outdo ourselves  next time? ;-)  I'm sure we *could* - but we don't have to either. Whatever. I'm easy  (as you can see!)   **Yes, your low pressure attitude is very awesome! It makes me feel very  comfortable with you.   >**(bitchiness) Failed attempt ;-) And don't be sorry that you failed  :-P :-D   AW, FUCK! I'm SORRY! I tried! Dammit!   **Wonder where I'm going to get a nice clean feather? :-P   >Mmm, so, Dennis, what are you going to do to me??? ;) >**You'll see  soon enough! :-)   No, no, I think it's my turn, isn't it?   **If you give to me very much, I'll *have* to give back :-) Wonder how  many times it will take before we stop giving to each other in return  the first go around? Cause giving makes me very excited, which means I'll  be ready to get again as soon as you get off. :-) Of course, we're  probably going to get and give at the same time!!!   >**You know, when you say that it makes me want to ask ;-) And I think I'll  ask non-verbally.... :-D   Pussy!   **Challenging moi? I thought that asking non-verbally would be better....  not afraid to ask verbally if that's required! :-)   I had to look you in the eye and say, "I want you to touch me." Fair is  fair, tit for tat...   **Yes, and you made my very excited by saying that! OK! Not a problem! I'll  ask!!!! I really thought that asking non verbally would be more sexy,  but if it's not, I'll come right out and ask!   I'm not going to let you get away with *all* nonverbals! I've done that  shit for too long.   **I know. I will do whatever you want me to :-)   And you'd better fucking verbalize at least some pleasure too - it is no  fucking fun to get NO response... :x   **Trust me, you'll know EXACTLY how much fun I'm having ;-) Unless we  HAVE to be quiet! My body language will tell a whole lot about how I'm  feeling either way! :-)   You've been partially attacked a few times. I'm not really *ready* to  attack you - you know, that whole "new sex" thing --- go read an old  email of mine, you'll see it.   **Yes, I have enjoyed my partial attacks ;-) I do know what you're  talking about with the "new sex" thing. We'll take care of that!   >**Yes, I don't mind kneeling down for you at all because I know you'll  return the favor. ;-) I do "worship" you in a way :-) Your power trip  was somewhat justified, because I would do ANYTHING for you. I know you  would do the same for me.   Yep, that's about it, I *would* - and I will :)   **We are so fucking good together!!! I know that may sound ghey, but we  ARE! We have a healthy relationship where we communicate very well and  care about each other to no end. WE ARE COOL! Go us! This is what I've  always wanted! YOU are what I've always wanted!   >I was trying to make it pleasant for you, let's put it that way. >**Hmmm?  What does that mean exactly??? :-)   I was doing my best to *look* sexy, duh... Giving you a little show.  Hope you didn't mind it :) Trying to project how I was feeling....   **No! I enjoyed it much! I do that too! I move a little more and make a  little more noise than I need to to be sure that I'm communicating how  GOOD things feel!   >**Yes, that's what I mean. Needy is being replaced in both of us with  trust and true love. I was needy too... I wanted someone to be with SO  badly.... I was as guilty as anyone.   Really? I didn't know you were feeling like that - when was this?   **It wasn't a *big* needy feeling, but it was there in the beginning  somewhat. Remember when I said that I had spent a lot of time wishing I  had someone? Well, then you appear into my life, and you are everything  I wanted! This was and is better than I ever imagined!   **Maybe my wish was a little prayer in disguise?   >**Hey, when you stand on the desk and call out for me like Superman,  how can I not appear? :-D   COOL!!!! Did I do that???   **Well, standing on your desk professing your love at the top of your  lungs is close enough for this comic book character ;-)   Teehee! I found a button! Now I'm going to have to get naked to get  you to do *anything* right? Great... :)   **Uhm....nnn..YES! I won't do ANYTHING unless you get nekid! "Do the  dishes." "Ok, get nekid!" "Take the trash out." "Ok, soon as you get  nekid!" "Vacuum the floor." "Sure, but you gotta get them panties off  first!"   >**:-P Yes, I'm sticking my tongue out, whatchu gonna do bout it?   *bite*   What did you expect? You *knew* what I was going to do...   **:-D You're a biter;-) Not a bad biter, a NICE biter!   >**Yep, pretty funny thread! So, did you dress up like a ninja yet??? I  can't wait to see myself in the mirror! :-D   No, I haven't done it. I probably won't, but I do sometimes get into  ninja moods... So someday I might just go ahead and make the mask, now  that I know how to do it!   **I still haven't ninjafied myself, but I'm sure it's coming....:-D   >Dennis   You ARE NOT!!! At least I don't think so. Cause you're like me in a  lot of ways, and I don't think I'm a nerd.... I think I'm a dork :) Ya  know?   **I think you're a nerd more than a dork, but it's just semantics;-) I  think of nerds as cool people..... go figure!   Well, I'm going to let you go - I know how you're starting to hate  emailing me...   **Yes, it just kills me.... I can't stand to type to you AT ALL anymore!!!  YOU SUCK! :-D   **I LOVE YOU :-D :-)   I get to see you in about 38 hours!!!! Yea!!!!! (see, dorky!)   **38 hours? 38 hours from this morning @ 4am would put us at....hmmm...   ..... about 6pm on Friday? You got some  plans for abducting me that I don't know about? I hope?!?! ;-)   **I am really looking forward to seeing you again :-) I miss the feeling  of your body against mine. I miss the feeling of you lips on mine. I  miss your company :-)   Dennis

Saw her interaction w/co workers,  not friendly.   >**PLEASE do not tell him about this! Do not "confirm" that she saw *ME*,  it could have been the *other* Dennis that works here at Jetcorp  ;-)......   Paul just said, "If Dennis is going there Tuesday, maybe I'll see him  there." :x Fucker!   **Tell him I'll be there Tuesday if he wants to see me ;-)   I'm coming to see you on your lunch break tonight ;) Suck that, dear!   **Call me and we'll set it up! :-D   Well, I already done told Paul *last night* that you said you were at  McDonald's - and if Lauren provided a somewhat accurate description of  you, he already knows she spotted you without me telling him...   **Just don't remove all doubt for him, that's all I ask. If you have, or  have to, no biggie. I don't own you obviously.   What? You were acting like a GUY?!?!?!? OMG!!! Not that!!! I don't  fucking care if you're an asshole to Lauren - she's a homewrecker ;)   **Yeah, we were definitely acting like "guys". Kevin is a lot like Koby  in that he finds humor in other peoples misery....   >**And the circa 70's music enters the background "Bauw chinca bauau..."  as he removes his belt....   **heard this music in my head at Subway!!!**   **:-D Maybe you'll hear it again soon...hehe!   >Dennis  name tag ;-)   And just *how* do you plan to do this??? ;)   **Not sure yet, but you know I'm pretty slick ;-)   Here's anudder email!

She was wearing a black turtleneck sweatery thingy. Kevin(who I go to lunch with regularly) has noticed her at lunch before and mentions her when he sees her because "She wears enough makeup to make a prostitute blush." and "She looks desperate to find a man" and he always gets a good laugh out of her! DOH! This may or may not have been Lauren, but if it was....!!!!!!!!! One night when I went to that mcd's/amaco to get gas after work this same woman was out back of the place drunk and acting stupid...lol.  Sounds promising... is she about 5' 5" or so (slightly shorter than me, I believe) with (newly) blonde hair to the bottom of her jaw, very skinny, and GOD YES she wears too fucking much makeup!!! She's got a kinda weird face - not exactly ugly, but sorta, uh, maybe flatish? I don't know - it's been a year and a half since I've seen her... Drunk and stupid - that sounds promising too...   >**PLEASE do not tell him about this! Do not "confirm" that she saw *ME*, it could have been the *other* Dennis that works here at Jetcorp ;-)...... BUT I can maybe tell you why he won't tell you. Kevin and I were being absolutely obnoxious (as men sometimes tend to do). She may or may not have heard us cracking about her makeup and being assholes in general. Kevin is the guy I bragged to about you. The subject of your husband came up.... "So what does her husband look like?" he asks. My answer, since we were already in full obnoxious force was "He's pretty scrawny." And of course Kevin, never being the kind of guy to miss a beat has to fill in not at all quietly with "Well that's why she's not satisfied with him, he's a scrawny little bitch! " "Chicks HATE that..." "That's probably why she's crazy about you, she's got a REAL man finally!" And we went on to discuss the finer points of life in similar fashion.... Don't know what she may have heard of our conversation besides that, but we were being pretty obnoxious in general. They had fucked up both of our orders... which is pretty common for THAT McDonalds/Amoco....   Paul just said, "If Dennis is going there Tuesday, maybe I'll see him there." :x Fucker!

Bet you didn't know that ;-) You are SO much more than just someone to have sex with! And you are very special in that you are the only woman I have ever met that could acheive an erection! ;-):-P If I had an erection every time I thought about you I would have an erection 95% of my day, because that's how much I think about you. I somehow manage to restrain myself and only have an erection about 25%-45% of the day :-)  And yet, amazingly, somehow I understood that!  I know, I mean I'm so not offended that you get a little stiff thinking about me.&nbsp; This is a bad thing how???&nbsp; :)&nbsp; It'll wear off after a while...&nbsp; I think?   >**YEP! "DOH!

Cause giving makes me very excited, which means I'll be ready to get again as soon as you get off. :-) Of course, we're probably going to get and give at the same time!!!  Same time is good.&nbsp; TTTT, same time is kinda hard for me to avoid a lot of the time...&nbsp; I can't help it :)&nbsp; That's just how much I enjoy giving.&nbsp; I mean, when I get off, it's all good, don't get me wrong!&nbsp; But doing it for somebody else is sooooo much better!&nbsp; And, hey, if it happens at the same time, well, who loses?  I did good and stood there as best I could and let you do whatever...&nbsp; So there!&nbsp; :p    >**Challenging moi?

My body language will tell a whole lot about how I'm feeling either way! :-)  LOL - um, well you can be "quiet" and still *sigh* or something...&nbsp; Watch me, I'll show ya!     >**We are so fucking good together!!! I know that may sound ghey, but we ARE! We have a healthy relationship where we communicate very well and care about each other to no end. WE ARE COOL! Go us! This is what I've always wanted! YOU are what I've always wanted!  You're soooooo gay!&nbsp; :)  Yeah, I'm digging the way we get along too - mostly on my end it's cause I never got caught in the "impress Dennis" trap - since I was all married and shit...&nbsp; AND I trust you a whole bunch, so I'll tell you just about anything - talk about anything that is bothering / interesting you, cause I'm pretty confident you're not going to turn on me :)&nbsp; Oh, and I can't lie to you if I try - I'm transparent!    >**No! I enjoyed it much! I do that too! I move a little more and make a little more noise than I need to to be sure that I'm communicating how GOOD things feel!  I can, um, get myself all excited by making noise, even if I'm not so excited to begin with...&nbsp; That's why I'm not a good faker ;)&nbsp;&nbsp;    >**Maybe my wish was a little prayer in disguise?  Hmmmm?&nbsp; Dunno...&nbsp; Grandma got me thinking this morning about stuff too - it's weird...&nbsp;    >**Well, standing on your desk professing your love at the top of your lungs is close enough for this comic book character ;-)  *hug*&nbsp; Awww, you're so sweet!&nbsp; If you were here, I'd, like,&nbsp;kiss you and stuff!  You made me smile like a dork in the library, gee thanks!!!&nbsp;    >**Uhm....nnn..YES! I won't do ANYTHING unless you get nekid! "Do the dishes." "Ok, get nekid!" "Take the trash out." "Ok, soon as you get nekid!" "Vacuum the floor." "Sure, but you gotta get them panties off first!"  Ok, but realize that you'll be doing the dishes, taking the trash out, and vacuuming naked a LOT - ya know?&nbsp;    >**:-D You're a biter;-) Not a bad biter, a NICE biter!  I used to be a not so nice biter.&nbsp; Uh, and sometimes in the heat of the moment, I bite hard - mostly to hang on, I think, but I don't realize I'm doing it then...&nbsp; And later I'm like DAAAAAMN, did I do that?&nbsp; I try not to do that so much.&nbsp; It's kinda not so nice.&nbsp; It hurts!    >**I think you're a nerd more than a dork, but it's just semantics;-) I think of nerds as cool people..... go figure!  See, I'm the opposite, Nerds are - nerdy!&nbsp; But dorks are cool!&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Semantics is right.&nbsp; But it's funny that we think the exact opposite on this subject, a couple of dorky nerds like us...&nbsp; Go figure!   >**Yes, it just kills me.... I can't stand to type to you AT ALL anymore!!! YOU SUCK! :-D    I know I do...  >**I LOVE YOU :-D :-)  I love you too :)    >**38 hours? 38 hours from this morning @ 4am would put us at....hmmm... ..... about 6pm on Friday? You got some plans for abducting me that I don't know about? I hope?!?! ;-)  No, no I don't.&nbsp; But I didn't actually DO the math...&nbsp; I just picked a number - I guess it should have been 60 hours???&nbsp; I don't care - it's way less than that now, like (counting) 27 hours or so?&nbsp; 28 hours???&nbsp; Something like that...&nbsp;  BUT I am going to be over at work later on this afternoon...&nbsp; *cough*&nbsp; Maybe we could go visit Lauren at McDonald's...&nbsp; If I could figure out a way to get Paul to bring Chris home...&nbsp;  !!!&nbsp; :-D   >**I am really looking forward to seeing you again :-) I miss the feeling of your body against mine. I miss the feeling of you lips on mine. I miss your company :-)   &nbsp;  :-D&nbsp; Thanks, and I can't wait to see you either!&nbsp; My stupid couch fooled me and woke me up at 4:30 this morning, so it's pretty obvious that I wish you were around too :)&nbsp; A little bit...  &nbsp;  I don't miss the feeling of your lips on mine, I've got it memorized...&nbsp;and on my arms, my stomach, my thighs, my breasts... &nbsp;Yeah, that's pretty stuck in my head...&nbsp; *sigh!!!*  &nbsp;  I REALLY LIKE YOU!  &nbsp;  I LOVE YOU!!!!  &nbsp;  TTFN, gotta go to the bank and other less exciting stuff - it still hasn't rained, so I reckon I'll be changing my oil today afterall....&nbsp; Blah!  &nbsp;  Hey, BTW, I just read that last little thing (and on my arms, my stomach, my thighs, my breasts...)&nbsp; DUDE!&nbsp; I am on the menu at KFC!!!&nbsp;   &nbsp;  *kiss*  &nbsp;  Shannon

That is what I need and want most. For that I can never repay you.  schpoolboy2: :-)  schpoolboy2: You are the someone that I've always wanted.  akatornado6: Meh, I've been kicked around a lot for a while now.  akatornado6: I've kicked myself down as much as anybody else has...  schpoolboy2: Don't do that, don't let others do that.  akatornado6: So I feel *unworthy* sometimes... you're soooooooo good!  akatornado6: Well, I did.  schpoolboy2: You are worthy.  akatornado6: Sorry.  akatornado6: I'm just worried .  akatornado6: I guess.  akatornado6: and tired.  akatornado6: And lonely  akatornado6: :-)  akatornado6: And I smell like you - silly shirt!  akatornado6: So it's been a rough day.  akatornado6: GAH!  akatornado6: Maybe after I'm done w/ Paul, I'll feel better.  schpoolboy2: I look at how good you are around me and it amazes me too.

You are letting me in and letting me help. If you don't let me in, I can't help, and then things go bad in a hurry. We have to share our lives for this to work.  schpoolboy2: Yes, I know.  akatornado6: And I'm so comfortable with you...  schpoolboy2: Paul is acting pretty childish......  akatornado6: It's like standing on a razor blade.  schpoolboy2: You are helping me so much.  schpoolboy2: You are giving me a part of my life that has been missing for so long.  akatornado6: You make my brain work right.  akatornado6: :-)  akatornado6: So you're kinda helpful too.  schpoolboy2: :-D  schpoolboy2: thank you  schpoolboy2: That's cause I'm a professional brain mechanic!  akatornado6: :-)  akatornado6: I *know* what I want.  schpoolboy2: :-)  akatornado6: Don't think I'm second guessing that, ok?  schpoolboy2: Ok  schpoolboy2: I understand.  akatornado6: I never have, not since I told you that I was in...  schpoolboy2:  akatornado6: I'm just trying to figure out what the hell is going on.  schpoolboy2: I know.  schpoolboy2: I like working on cars because I like to fix and improve things.

      From:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Shannon Yevcak"   To:&nbsp;&nbsp; spoolboy@autospeed.com>  Subject:&nbsp;&nbsp; WOW!  Date:&nbsp;&nbsp; Sun 07/21/02 10:53 AM    I feel pretty high today.&nbsp; I'm not the least but sleepy.&nbsp; Just stupid happy!&nbsp; Thank you a million times over, Dennis!&nbsp; Thank you for being you, for being there for me, for being there with me.&nbsp; I wouldn't trade you - no, not even for a billion dollars.&nbsp; You really are the most amazing person I've ever known.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; I just keep saying "WOW" in my head - over and over...&nbsp;   WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW!   And smiling like a freaking idiot...   You make me feel so incredible!&nbsp; I love this so much - this mutual giving and trust and respect and love - damn, this is what it is supposed to be like.&nbsp; I am so lucky!&nbsp; I'm sure glad you wanted to know about my license plate...&nbsp; Heh...&nbsp; Look what you caused!&nbsp; Thank you!!!!   Hmmm, I didn't know you could compress two "best days ever" in to one week!&nbsp; I'm sorry, but last night, without question, bumps Tuesday night off of the top of the list.&nbsp; THAT was the best BEST night of my life.   I'm still not fully able to process that this is all real.&nbsp; Every time I'm exposed to you, I learn something new.&nbsp; When I can reach out and touch you, I know that you are real.&nbsp; But then you blow my mind all over again!&nbsp; WOW WOW WOW!!!   Mmm, and thank you for lending me your shirt.&nbsp; I like it a lot, cause it smells like you :)&nbsp; I'm enjoying this very much...&nbsp; *sniff*&nbsp; Yep, I haven't worn the Dennis off of it yet.&nbsp; Mmm, I think, since you smell like laundry, that I'm going to have to start hanging out by the dryer!&nbsp; Hehe!&nbsp; I think I'm going to cuddle the hell out of this shirt until I can see you again - or until I do manage to wear all of the Dennis off of it!&nbsp; Oooooh!&nbsp; I know I know!!!&nbsp; I'll combine your shirt with Phil - now that is a damn good idea!!!   BTW, as soon as I am sleeping next to you on a regular basis, Phil is getting chucked.&nbsp; You are MUCH better.&nbsp; Much much much better :-D   *sigh*&nbsp; It is so very nice to just lay in bed with you snuggling.&nbsp; I'm so happy to just BE with you.&nbsp; I'd been wanting to do that for a long time.&nbsp; Thanks!&nbsp; Just exactly like I'd dreamed.&nbsp; Even before I met you... God, can this be?&nbsp; You are exactly, perfectly, totally everything I've ever wanted.&nbsp; And I finally found you - and you found me - and we work together...&nbsp; Pinch me, I must be dreaming!   Oh what I wouldn't give for another hug.   I know I'll get it!   I love you.  You are incredible!   ***HUG***   YOUR Shannon

Dennis   From: spoolboy  To: SYR/T  Posted: Mon Jun 17, 2002 5:53 am  Subject: Drag Racin  Good morning!   I got bored. It's like 5AM and I went to bed too early(9:30!), so now I'm  up! I'll go back to bed soon, but can't sleep right now.   Just thought I would drop you a PM so you'd have something in your inbox.    Maybe I can coax a smile out of you this morning?   So anyway, here's your drag racing how-to:   First, go here and download and play this drag racing game:  http://www.staginglight.com/guide/practice.html look at the link bar on  the right side of that page and click on "netHoleShot! game" to download.  You may have to disable some of the security features on your PC to get  it to go, maybe not, who knows? I had to. There's a help page that will  walk you thru anything you need to do. Set it for the "Sportsman" tree  in options and also select "gas pedal activated on mouse up". This will  help because your leg has to lift up off of the clutch pedal to launch  and your brain thinks "lift up" more consistently if you RELEASE the  mouse button to launch instead of pressing it down.   If you want to play around, try the PRO tree. I'm much better at the pro  than the sportsman tree. Go figure....   Anyway, that will get you familiar with the lights.   Ok, we'll start from the beginning....   You're in the pits waiting to be called to the staging lanes. Try to  keep the car COOL. Don't leave it idle. Leave the hood up so the heat  can radiate away from the engine. If you have a bag of ice or something  else cold, put it on the intake manifold near the coolant temp sensor  and map/iat sensor. The colder the readings are for these sensors, the  more aggressive the PCM will be with timing and fuel maps. This was  worth .3/2mph on my Dak and worth .2/2mph on a friend's Neon. Chrysler  is notorious for programming really aggressively when the vehicles are  cold.....   Ok, they call you to the staging lanes. Try to drive quickly(but not TOO  quickly) to the lanes to keep the car from getting hot. Shut it off  ASAP and let it coast into the line of cars. Put the hood up. You will  probably have to wait a long time from the staging lanes to when you  actually run. You can accelerate the cool down time of your engine by  starting it for a second, revving to about 2500rpm until you see the  coolant temp drop, and then shutting it off. This circulates the cooled  coolant from the radiator into the engine. If you can manually run your  rad fans, do it. Maybe just turn the key to ON and flip the A/C on MAX?  It works on some cars...   Anyway, don't leave the fan on TOO long, or you'll run your battery down  and the alt will drag you down as you make your pass. Or if you leave  it run TOOOOO long, you won't be able to start the car! Don't ask how I  know this....   Anyway, if you are really concerned about keeping the car cool in the  staging lanes, as you move forward, simply push the car rather than  driving it. Most staging lanes are perfectly flat and Neons are easy to  push.   Ok, you've made it all the way through the staging lanes, and you are  getting ready to enter the track. Start the car and go ahead and let it  idle. Drive it from here on up. This will make sure the oil is the  proper temp for best power and circulated enough so that you don't hurt  something. At Gateway, you would be just about to go under the towers. I  usually get a good adrenaline rush right about now and/or get nervous.  Don't look at the idiots in the stands.   Ok, you're next into the burnout box. Since you are running street tires  and don't seem to want to waste them, simply drive around the water and  back up. If you want to do a LITTLE burnout, go ahead. Set the e-brake,  put it in 1st and dump the clutch @ about 4500rpm. Let the clutch SNAP  out so that it shocks the tires and breaks them loose quickly. Take your  hand off of the shifter and place it on the e-brake handle. As soon as  the tires have made a little smoke, let the e-brake off and let the car  move forward as the tires catch up. There really is no need to do a  burnout on street tires, but some people swear that it improves your ET.  I don't know, I've never been able to prove either way. I don't do  burnouts on street tires, I just "scrub" the tires to knock the dirt off,  ie one revolution or 2, no smoke.   Ok, make sure the car is still straight. Look all the way down the track  at the end and make sure that that is where the car is going to go  without having to turn the steering wheel ANY. The shortest distance  between 2 points is a straight line, and the PS pump only sucks power  when you are turning.   Slowly pull forward until you light the first yellow light at the top of  the tree. Now rev your engine to whatever rpm you want to launch at. It's  better to bog than burn. I'd suggest 2500rpm with your tires!   While revved to 2500rpm, let the clutch out quickly a couple of times to  bump the car forward into the next set of beams to light the 2nd yellow  light. Make sure you stop and don't roll forward once the 2nd light is  lit. You shouldn't have to move very far forward to get there. Try to  hold your rpms @ 2500 as you do this, so that you're already at the  proper rpm now. After you and the guy in the other lane are both staged  with both lights lit, the tree will start coming down. You'll get 3  yellow lights then a green one. Leave as the last yellow light goes out,  but before the green light comes on.   To launch, let the clutch out quickly but don't dump it or slip it. You  know what I mean. Don't mash the gas immediately. The car will lurch  forward and then bog as the engine gets bogged down. You want to hit the  gas just as the car tries to bog down. You'll feel it try to do it, you  probably already know your car well enough to know WHEN to hit the gas.  If the car boggs too bad, try a higher rpm level next time or a quicker  gas pedal mash. You are probably better off with more rpm at first than  hitting the gas sooner. If you have to change your launch rpm, go in  500rpm incriments unless the car COMPLETELY doesn't do what you want it  to, then go in 1000rpm incriments.   Drive it down the track shifting as fast as you can without grinding  gears or breaking something.   Stay on the gas until after where you think the timing beams are. Most  people will lift too soon and coast thru the traps. This is free ET you  are losing if you do this. Once you get thru the traps and are SURE of  it, let off and let the car slow down. Most tracks have plenty of shut  down area, so there's no need to beat on your brakes. I don't know what  the exit of the track looks like at GLD. It always makes me feel better  and more confident to look at where the hell I'm going to have to go to  get back to the pits before I make a pass.   Get your time slip and analyze what happened. Don't be surprised if you  get a 2.4 or slower 60ft time(Dave ran a 2.6 today! doh!). If you can  get a 2.2-2.3 60ft time on street tires, you are doing OK. If you can  pull a 2.0-2.1, you are REALLY good. Better than that usually requires  dedicated slicks and serious practice.   I'll probably be around to help you analyze your slip, so I won't waste  more space writing it out.   I think you'll run a best of 15.1@91mph. Wanna bet me a Mtn Dew?

But I'm thinking, has  Dennis done this too? Is this a chick thing? Would it freak him out if  he knew I was doing it?   **Not freaked out. Just a little flattered and surprised. Especially  since we've both said how far off that would be But it doesn't bother  me. Like I said, I can see us together from here on out, so..... it is  not all that surprising and it does not freak me out at all. But I do  think we should take things slowly. You know, like date for a while n  stuff Live together for a while first and see if we can tollerate each  other and keep up with reality when we're in each other's company a lot  Cause it's so easy to duck out of life when you're in my arms   I miss you - you're too good to me. I've been thinking about you all day  - and how much good we give each other - and trying to believe that I've  been giving as much as I'm getting. You give so much - I love it.   **Nah, not too good. Nothing is too good for the woman I love that loves  me back! And I know you feel the same way! I give what I've got to  give, and so do you.   I love you. *HUG* Ah, what I wouldn't do for a real one   **HUG** I love you too    Did you get to talk to your parents yet???   **Nope. Not yet. Mom had a docs apt today and they weren't there when I  got home. And last night I only stopped in long enough to gather some  overnight supplies... I did tell them that we got a motel room because  you were fighting w/Paul and you needed somewhere to stay. That was the  end of the conversation.   I finally mentioned your name to my Mom - well, I have before, but I  told her I fell asleep at your house Saturday...   **What is she saying about me? About this? So when do I meet YOUR folks?    **And more importantly, when and how am I going to be introduced to  Chris? I'm open ended on this subject, I'm waiting for you to tell me  what you think.

Don't  know why, but I was looking at them and thinking about you, and  wondering what kind of curtains you like... And cracking up cause I  imagine you could give a shit about curtains   **I DO NOT give a shit about curtains   And thinking about buying new stuff, shopping for your own place is fun.  And wondering if it will be a *nice* place that will make your friends  go, "Thank God he's finally got a woman to take care of him!" or a "make  do" place. I'm fine with making do, I like nice stuff in my house, but  it's not like nice = expensive. My couch was $650. Sounds like a lot,  but I've been on much crappier couches that cost three times that much...  I'm a bargin shopper And then I thought, "Hmmm, what color towels.....  OH SHIT look at me, sitting here planning! Wonder what Dennis will say  when I tell him about this!!! "   **It's ok. I WAS thinking about how I wanted to decorate "my" apartment  Thinking how cool it would be to have a car hood hanging on one wall  in the living room/area instead of pictures like most people have But  it would have to be a NON BENT hood that was all waxed and purdy! I  have a fucked up sense of style You have been warned! Hmm... maybe we  could use a hood with hinges and a prop rod instead of curtains????!!!!  I think red/green tried this and it worked!!!     (slow pace)Well, I think someone else is taking care of that for us. We're  going the only pace we can. We're not waiting around for no reason, but  we're not rushing ourselves either. I'm comfortable - when it feels  right, it happens - which is very stress free. We've got time to think  things over, but then again it's fast enough that I don't feel bored,  and I don't have quite enough time to talk myself out of it!   **Yes, we are doing just fine, just wanted to say those things that I've  already said and you already knew.... doh!   And how could we not keep up with reality? You made it to work today,  didn't you? If I would have really asked you to, would you have stayed  with me? I think you would have - but I was OK with letting you go -  there are still things to be done.   **Well.... it hasn't become a problem really... but I just want to avoid  it by mentioning to watch out for it..... I've been meaning to go look  at apartments....but haven't made it yet.   Reality is not a problem for me - as long as you're in it. And you are  becoming reality - more every time I see you!   ** I'm so glad!   Ah, I wish I had more to give somehow. But I'm starting to believe you  when you tell me that my love is enough. You've got all of me, Dennis,  ALL. Just tell me which part you need when you need it, and it's yours.  (Um, I see a dirty joke in there somewhere, but meh, effort!)   **It's ok. You do give a lot! Right now you are giving me the things I  need. When I need more, you will have the opportunity to give more. But  right now, all I need is your love, and you are doing just fine by  giving it to me!   **And I'll tell you exactly which parts I need I have so far, haven't I?    >**Nope. Not yet.

Cool - let me know what they say, I mean if you want to - I'm interested  in what they want to know about Saturday night *prepares lengthy  apology speech to Dennis's parents...*   **Apology??? I don't think that will even be required... so no need to  start practicing yet. We'll see what they want to know soon enough I  think they just want to know basic stuff, just talke to me in general,  not anything about what we did or didn't do, etc. I will definitely have  to talk to mom tonight after work...she'll interrogate me one way or  another..lol.   Well, I'm just starting to drop little hints here and there, I haven't  told the full story yet. Testing the waters, I guess. I don't want her  to think I'm leaving Paul for you... I'm not. So I want to make sure she's  comfortable with the divorce first, because I can't handle any guilt  trips about you right now - and Mom would go there if I didn't handle  the telling just right. She doesn't do it on purpose - it's just the way  she is - the way she finds out if you're sure or full of shit, ya know?    **I understand. Just keep me abreast of the situation   I guess you can meet them ASAP if you want to meet them as "supportive  freind Dennis." I'm not ready - uh, I'm ready! But they're not ready for  that just yet, I don't think... It probably won't be long, it's really  hard to keep you a secret... You did the same thing, slowly worked your  way through it with your folks... Right?   **Yes, slowly work them into knowing "of" me as they are ready for it. I'll  meet them when you and they are ready. I'm in no hurry.... but I'd like  to meet them in a low pressure scenario, kinda like how you met my  parents. I am scared to death to sit down and have dinner with them!  Just bring me "around" a bit so I can get to know them I BET that your  Dad and I will get along   **And more importantly, when and how am I going to be introduced to  Chris? I'm open ended on this subject, I'm waiting for you to tell me  what you think. I know Paul has already started "introducing" me...:-/   Well, any time, I guess.   **I want to start meeting him soon! But at the same time, I am worried  what Paul will think. I'm SERIOUSLY concerned that he will think I'm  trying to "steal" his son "too" and start planting things in Chris's  head to "prevent" it.... But at the same time, the sooner Chris meets me,  the sooner he will actually see me and who I am, compared to what he's  heard of me....   It won't be much of a problem - other than he probably shouldn't see us  kissing until the paperwork is finished... Ya know?   **Yes, those are the kind of things I want to discuss with you.... in  addition to to "who" I am to him when I introduce myself. Am I your  boyfriend? Friend? Just a guy you know? etc. I am a bit of a worry wart  about this... I want to be a positive to him and not a negative....   But it's ok to be affectionate - I don't want him to get the idea in his  head that you are replacing him... Or replacing Paul.   **That's fine. I'll follow your lead. Show me what is appropriate. Slap  me hard if I cuss in front of him! This is a problem I have! Mouth runs  without brain attached quite often   I don't know how to play second fiddle, which is what you'll be to him  in a way - "step" something or other - sometimes it is a huge fight,  sometimes kids love their "step" whatevers... You do have a say in it -  you'll have to deal with him on some level... Let me know what you think  about it, how you feel, what you are comfortable with.   **Ok. I will communicate with you on this subject just as I have before.  This is all VERY new to me, so I don't even know what I'll have to deal  with yet.... we'll see as we go. I am determined and confident about  being a positive part of his life. I DO NOT want to seem like I'm a "replacement".   I'll follow your lead, so show me how to do this. This will be part of  what I'll need from you. He is YOUR son, so I want to interact with him  in ways that you think is appropriate.   WOW - you're so amazing! I don't know HOW you can do this... I just don't  know - I can't believe I'm worth all of this! I like it, don't get me  wrong, it's just blowing my mind again! Amazing!   **You ARE worth everything!!!!! It blows my mind sometimes too when I  stop to think about it. It's ok   *kiss*   I LOVE YOU!!!!!   **kiss*   **I LOVE YOU!!!!!!   **Talk to you more after I get back from Lunch!

Uh-huh, I think I should like to spend a  little bit more time alone with you   **Well, I'm just sharing what I'm tasting! I'm glad that what I share  is what you like to hear! I really am going to have to get you to turn  the lights on for me tho... at least for a while until my tongue and my  fingers are trained a little better. It's been a long time, I'm not the  most experienced in the world, and every vagina is different! I want to  KNOW what I'm doing, instead of just *thinking* I'm hitting what I'm  trying to hit... I feel I've been doing better at reaching my objectives  manually than orally. Yep, I need more practice! I'd love to watch you  sometime, so I know how YOU do it I won't copy you tho, but I will pick  up "key" things I don't want to be "just like your hand", cause what  fun is that?   **I'm going to send this now because I want to know if you're on line or  not. I tried to call, but got a busy signal...doh! I got busy for a  while with unloading things with the forklift too. Fun.   **Hit me back with a short pm if you're out there.

I'm ok, I'm starting to believe you... I'm not perfect - I don't  have a "perfect" body. I just have my own body, and one of these days  you're going to have me believing you when you tell me stuff like that.  I feel perfect when I'm around you - you give strong vibes. Or at least  horny enough to not fucking care   **Strong vibes? Hmm...there's a joke there!   **YES! You are perfect! You are everything I WANT in a woman!!! You may  not be EVERY man's perfect woman (because each man has his own idea of "perfect")  but you are PERFECT to me!!!   (cookin)Yeah, you did fetch me a sandwich and coffee! That's good enough  for me! I am a good cook - sometimes lazy. It's not hard. Microwaves  are our friends! Does anybody actually *cook* every night anymore? I  make dinner every night, but I'd say I probably work at it once a week  or less. I usually have the shit on the table in 20 minutes or less.   **Like Eminem says "There's no such thing, like a woman with good looks  who cooks and cleans." If I'm not real, you aren't either!   And grinned like an idiot right there at the dining room table with my  Mom.   **   **It's ok. I WAS thinking about how I wanted to decorate "my" apartment    Oh, yeah. I keep forgetting! Don't let me get away with that - there I  go again moving myself right on it with you. I shouldn't have been  daydreaming about curtains - not yet. Not unless you've changed the  rules about who lives where when? We talked about this last night, and I  didn't get a good resolution because you started kissing me mid-sentence  and I forgot what I was saying.   **I know. I guess we need to really discuss that well. What it comes  down to for me is what your income will be. I simply cannot afford a  place big enough for 3 people to stay comfortably... all I can  realistically spare is about $400ish/month for rent (utilities etc are  above that). If you aren't going to be able to help, we can't get a  place that costs more than that. I have no problem with getting a place  for ME and letting you stay with me during the week. Of course I'd  expect you to help out with stuff as much as you can, but I understand  your situation and your previous economic responsibilities, ie Chris. So  it looks like to me that unless you are going to make "decent" money  soon, we have to default to a smallish apt for me that you can stay in w/me.  Tell me how you feel about this. This would not be "forever", just  until the situation and money is ready for it. 6 months is not a very  long time..... and like you said, leases CAN be broken if it's needed. I  like this idea also for the Chris/me aspect. He could come over and  visit plenty still, but he wouldn't be expected to STAY with me/us yet  on the weekend. You could have your weekends in Litchfield or ? and just  be with me during the week. I would be free to go with you while you  had custody, or to not go if things were awkward or weird sometimes.   (pacing)Dont' doh! I like to hear it - that you still feel that way, you're  still thinking and planning and working with your BRAIN... We're both  pretty good at feeling when the time is right, I think, and life is  sorta throwing stuff at us sometimes - but we haven't run away from it,  we've always just said, "Ok, it's here, let's deal with it now." I like  that. You and I work together very well. It's cool! You're a keeper   **You're a keeper too!!!!!!!! We DO work well together!   >**And I'll tell you exactly which parts I need I have so far, haven't  I?   Yes, yes you have. I love that about you... You make everything into an  experience! I mean everything! And you talk to me! Hmmm, are you *sure*  I didn't dream you up? Fig Newton?   **I just try to be how I think you'd want me to be Whether you dreamed  me up or not, I'm here and I'm real, so who cares where I came from?   **Maybe I am sexier because you simply THINK I'm sexier. I think that's  why people are sexy. Simply because they are perceived that way. Sex IS  all in the mind. No doubts.   Ok. I know, but parents scare the crap out of me. I know your parents  are good, I'm just shy / careful like that.   **Don't be skeered! Just be you and you'll do fine!   **...abreast of the situation   I will... and in the meantime, why settle for just a breast? The other  one will get mighty jealous!   **It's ok, I'll swap from breast to breast. Or maybe I'll just stick to  one to make the other really jealous, that way when I do give it some  attention, it will have been aching to be touched?   Ok, that's a good chunk, I'm sending. Will reply with more as I get time!    Dennis   From: spoolboy  To: SYR/T  Posted: Mon Jul 22, 2002 9:54 pm  Subject: Re: Dial up sucks ass!  Ack, my parents aren't like that - go out to dinner crap. I mean they'll  take you out to dinner, no doubt! But it isn't like "Meet the Parents"  stuff - just come over and hang out with me. I don't have my own room  here, so I can't, like take you away and lock the door It's best to  drop by on our way to somewhere else, since I don't have "territory"  here. And yeah, I think you'll like my Dad. You'll see where I get it -  oh, you'll like my folks! They're good people! Hehe, my Dad has too damn  much crap! I'm sitting in his study right now looking around... you  think you have too many books!   **Cool! Sounds like a plan to me! I doubt I'll get to stay the night the  first time I meet your parents tho   **I want to start meeting him soon! But at the same time, I am worried  what Paul will think. I'm SERIOUSLY concerned that he will think I'm  trying to "steal" his son "too" and start planting things in Chris's  head to "prevent" it.... But at the same time, the sooner Chris meets me,  the sooner he will actually see me and who I am, compared to what he's  heard of me....   Good point... I haven't said a whole lot about you - just mentioning  your name, and telling him that I like you.   **Cool. We'll see what happens on Wednesday... no promises yet, just  tennative like you said...   >**Yes, those are the kind of things I want to discuss with you.... in  addition to to "who" I am to him when I introduce myself. Am I your  boyfriend? Friend? Just a guy you know? etc. I am a bit of a worry wart  about this... I want to be a positive to him and not a negative....   I know, I want to do it right too. I think you'll like him, he's a funny  kid. He's smart and talkative. He can be a real hell-raiser too, if he  feels like it... I don't know how he'll react, I have never done this. I  can only say that it will all work out. It has to - whatever it is  supposed to be... Like you always tell me!   **Well, as long as you are trying to help me, I'll be ok. I WILL need  you for that. You know your son. You've raised him for 6 years. I've  barely watched him play @ Mopark! It will take a long time to figure him  out. Kids are much harder to figure for me than adults.... because of  my lack of experience.   Uh, Dennis? Hello? It's me, Queen of the Curse Words you're talking to  here... I will NOT slap you hard! Not ever. What's the big fucking deal  about cussing anyway? Did you learn those words from your parents? I did!    **Just be sure to stop me if I do something that you don't want him to  see. I've lived in an adult world almost all of my life. I've never  really even THOUGHT about being around a child for a good portion of  time before. Yes, my parents taught me to cuss I just do not want to be  a bad influence, or subject Chris to things that you don't want him to  see.   Well, you are a good person. Kids need exposure to lots of different  things. You'll do fine on your own, but I'll keep an eye on you. I'm not  going to rush him or you through this. But I trust you - just being  Dennis will be good for him. Trust me.   **Thank you. That really makes me feel good. Makes me feel much better!    I guess you can just come over to the house some time - we can just hang.  You can play Jak and Daxter with him, just be there... Let him see you  - he'll show off at first, but he'll settle down. It doesn't have to be  a big production, you know? Most of life is hanging out, doing everyday  stuff. Down time between "something to do." So why start out in some  fake, high pressure thing? That's just silly, right?   **That sounds perfect to me. I was a hyper little kid myself, so if he's  a little wild, I'll probably get along with him pretty well   Let me know when you are ready - and I'll figure out what you are (your  "title") right before - cause it changes all the time You're everything  - just not all at once!   **Ok. Thank you I am ready to meet him.   >**PS, thanks for getting me in trouble on .org!   You're not in trouble. Talk to Robert and Mookie - both fucking post  whores themselves. They'll get over it Besides, they're giving ME shit,  not you - I think the cat is at least partially out of the bag   ** I was just teasing anyway...   **Yep, I think the cat at least has a paw or 2 out...   Now it's 8:00 - it's storming! w00t!   **Yes, it stormed here too. That's why I had to drive around like mad on  the forklift.

Now how am I going to hide this erection at work? This  isn't just a little semi, this is a full swing boner...thanks I think?   You're welcome! Any time!

I'm going to need an erection  emoticon!   >**The more I think, the more I can feel your hand on me again. The more  I can feel your lips on me. Your tongue against my skin. Your hot and  slippery saliva coating me. Yep, full swing!   COOL!!! I can feel you too, believe me. You rawk!   **Thank you for the compliment! Much fun on the horizon for sure!   >**You "tasted" it?   Um, well, not a good taste as far as actually tasting goes... *lick*   **So my question is... did you lick your hand before/after you wiped it  on my face? I thought I saw you do it, but I wasn't sure.... This  intruiges me!   **I definitely tasted YOU!... and I don't know if you caught me or not,  but I did smell my hand after last tuesday night and on Saturday I didn't  need to smell my hand last night I just smelled YOU. I can still smell  you when I taste you....   But I can tell you that getting you off will get me off, ok? I promise!  As I've mentioned, the writhing you witnessed was 100% honest.   ** You make me smile, in addition to giving me an erection! Maybe this  could be a good erection emoticon? X- lol!   (about last night)I know I get you at least a little excited.   **A little? Hello? You drive me CRAZY! I want to fuck you like I've  never wanted to fuck any woman before! Maybe that means more to you now?  The more I think about things, the more I realize it was the situation....  the extraneous circumstances that were all adding up to kill the mood  for me... I started off good, but somewhere in the middle of things my  mind when way off topic. Like it was overloaded, needed a break....   We've got the "chemistry" to work together. I know that's not the issue,  so I'm not even going to waste brain power stressing over it. And I'm  not letting go of the "meant to be" aspect of our relationship - when  the time is right, it will all fall into place. And what we managed to  get last night (um, everything I've ever wanted, what's the problem here???)  was exactly what we needed. Ya know?   **Yes. I know. Just let me be a guy and talk about this, ok? We talk  about everything else just fine, and way overanalyze it, so why should  this be any different?   (cumming)This is an issue that is different for men and women. I  honestly don't care if I get off every single time or not - but I  believe that men are built a little bit differently in that respect.  Giving really is enough for me most of the time. And you will make me  cum. Pleanty of times. I need to adjust to you. I am finally able to  cuddle with you, I'm finally able to really look into your eyes without  looking away, I'm finally starting to relax and I'm experiencing real  trust for the first time. So if I can do all of that, I'm pretty sure I  can get off for you Eh, what I think I mean is that maybe you are  better equipped to cum first and think later (when the blood flow makes  it to your brain) and I'm the opposite - I want to think first and cum  later. Different for me, I used to work it like a guy - he's getting off,  why shouldn't I? You're so new. All new and good and different and  wonderful.   **Thank you for sharing that. I can't beleive that I have such a big  effect on your life! It makes me happy and amazes me at the same time...  I'll make a girl out of you yet!   AND you give me more pleasure than you know just by holding me and  touching me and kissing me. That has never been enough before! I feel so  satisfied with what I've gotten so far, I can't even imagine what  having an orgasm with you is going to do to me.   ** I'm hoping your orgasm is at least 1/2 of what mine was! I came so  hard.... You could probably feel how hard! You DRAINED me in one orgasm!    **Dumb question.... what does my penis do when I have an orgasm? Does it  throb, expand a wee bit, get harder, anything? I've tried and tried to  feel this, but everytime I set out to feel what happens... I get side  tracked!!! Loose concentration! DOH! If I need to cum for you again so  you can pay more atttention......   **Well, I'm just sharing what I'm tasting! I'm glad that what I share  is what you like to hear! I feel I've been doing better at reaching my  objectives manually than orally. Yep, I need more practice! I'd love to  watch you sometime, so I know how YOU do it   YOU DID FINE!!!!!!!!! Both ways. Any way. All the ways. Did I look  unhappy? Did I complain? And I liked the oral better That was the  closest you've had me. Did I stop you? I don't remember.   **No, I actually stopped. My mind kept being stupid.... taking me out of  the situation....   **And I couldn't tell how close I had you.... I knew you were enjoying  things, but I didn't know HOW MUCH because you were "evenly" excited for  such a long time... I couldn't tell if things were getting "better" or  just staying the same.... and like I said, my mind was being stupid, so  I decided to just stop... sorry if I had you very close and then let you  down!   Haha, DOH! I coulda gotten off! (hehe, you felt like that after Tuesday  night, didn't you!!!)   **Now you get it, right?   No problem with the lights on issue - except this isn't the ideal week  for that - trust me, when I'm feeling ready for you to see, you'll see.  Up close and all Maybe even in natural light   You are very good - I liked it a LOOOOT... Yeah! I did, I did!   And you'll get your chance to watch me too - don't worry about that one    **Cool. I figured that light wouldn't be a problem once you got used to  me. I'm feeling much more comfortable naked with you now too. Thank you  for the compliment!!! And if you let me watch, I'll have to give you a  bit of a performance too   **Ok, I'll cut it off here for now and make a NEW PM with the rest...  there's only so much I can type!!!!   **KISS** **HUG**!!!!   **I love you!

This  intruiges me!   After. Wiping on your face was just a silly impulsive thing, and I kinda  wanted to see what you'd do. I had considered taking a big old obvious  lick right in front of you, but for some reason decided not to -  probably because I was kissing you right after wiping your face   **I wasn't really asking before/after, as I was trying to let you know  the timeline of when I thought I saw you do it... (doh! like you'd need  help remembering when!) I don't mind if you taste And as long as you  don't spit a bunch in my mouth, don't worry about what you do before you  kiss me If you have a little on your lips/tongue it's ok.   >**A little? Hello? You drive me CRAZY! I want to fuck you like I've  never wanted to fuck any woman before! Maybe that means more to you now?    "I want to fuck you like I've never wanted to fuck any woman before!"  Keep saying that - it's fucking cool! Gah! I can hardly stand to read it  right now... I think I'm back in working order for sure   **Yes. I realize now that most of what went down in the motel was Dennis  having a little bit of "performance anxiety". It was the FIRST time in  a long time, the FIRST time with you, and I wanted to impress!... plus  my extensive LACK of experience....   **I just need to practice a lot Bear with me while I learn this new  skill, ok?   You and I together are having this effect on my life. Everything I  tought I knew is suddenly up in the air. Or at least open to being  looked over. Sometimes I get "I thought it would / should be like this!"  Sometimes it's "Heeey, I remember this, yeah!" And sometimes you just  blow my little stupid theories right out of the water. WRONG! Try again  I'm not used to being wrong, but I think I like it.   You sure are making me into a woman!   ** Nothing left to do but smile!!!!   (orgasm)Yes, my hip told me I knew it was pretty good, but you should  have said something at the time - hehe, good things may have happened  And I think mine will be pretty good too, cause just thinking about you  makes things pretty darn intense - takes me a while to get there, then I  worry about falling off the couch!   **I'll be sure to tell you when I get ready to go next time Next time  you "get busy" just think about looking down at me and seeing me looking  up at you from between your legs. Looking you right in the eyes as my  tongue glides across your skin. As my lips land on you and suck.....   Yes, you'll need to repeat for me - I didn't pay attention either. Um,  you noticed that I somewhat stopped doing anything for a second there -  just like *zap* Couldn't help it, I was really happy - started to zone  out a little bit.   **It's ok. NP. I will do many repeat performances for you!   Staying the same. The same being, "OMFG!!! Dennis went down on me. OMG  and it feels good! Oooh do that again! Mmmm!!!" Yeah, I liked it Evenly  all the way excited. You had me very close once or twice, but I didn't  want to say anything because everything has been weird in that  department for a while now - so I didn't feel confident enough to let  you know. I'm not let down in the least - I love you!   **I love you too I know what you're saying by not exactly knowing when  things would "go off". That's how I was for you. I knew I was close......but  it was hard to tell "how close". And then "POW"! It felt like my penis  was a roman candle   **I think this "new sex" that you're talking about DOES make everything  just a wee bit weird.... plus the intensity of everything.... I feel  like my mind goes into overload at times!   I guess we can talk about stuff in real life soon - there are some  things I want to discuss (not bad things.) Oh, that and I just want to  see you...  Sneaky!   I LOVE YOU!   **I want to see you too! I guess unless you have other plans..or unless  things change.... I'll see you and Chris around 10ish tomorrow? Yes,  there are lots of things to talk about... we'll never run out of things  to talk about!!!!   **I love you!!!!   I had fun on my drive last night - it was beautiful outside. It was  weird. I was very happy and free and somehow reliving so many nights  from my past all at once. I was also very sad and lonely at the same  time. I can't even begin to count the number of miles I've logged on  those same dark country roads by myself, crying, thinking, feeling sad.  I don't know if what I felt last night was real and current, or if it  was just ghosts of old memories coming back to me. I guess I have to go  for a drive tonight too - er, actually, I need to go when it's light - I've  forgotten so many of the details! It's amazing what you remember and  what you forget - I still rememeber the curves and corners of the roads!!!  I wished for you out loud more than once last night, but I think I  need to do this alone.   I love you!   **I love you. What you wrote above is very beautiful, like you, like  your mind.   **I slept pretty good last night BION. But when I was trying to fall  asleep, I kept reaching out for "someone" I slept straight thru the  night from about 1:30 to 9:30am without ever stirring. I was TIRED! lol  I don't remember my dreams, but the pleasant mood I was in when I got up  is a pleasant I only feel when I'm thinking of you   **One of these days I will take the Litchfield tour with you I wonder  if the reason that you are drawn there, to driving around there, is  because the last time you went through anything like this, that is where  you dealt with it?

Heh.   **Call if you want, it will be a long time before I send the next PM  because of lunch, etc. I'll probably take a "longish" lunch and not be  back until 7:45ish.....   *KISS*  *KISS*  *KISS*  *kiss*  *HUG*   **HUG* *KISS* *KISS* *kiss* *KISSSS* *tongue* *KIS* *KISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS*  *LICK* **HUG**   Dennis

      From:   "Shannon Yevcak"   To:   spoolboy@autospeed.com Subject:   Ketchup! Date:   Tue 07/23/02 03:00 PM        The Tomato family was running a bit late on their way to Church one fine Sunday morning.  The littlest tomato, Timmy, kept lagging behind.  Mother Tomato, sister Tomato, and even the little tomato dog tried to get him to pay attention to the walk instead of playing with the picket fences.  Finally, Father Tomato went back to have a talk with his son.  He stomped on Timmy and yelled, "Ketchup!"   >**If you can, lets take these to email!  My inbox is about full on .org and I WANT to keep these!!! I've been doing so well at keeping everything   I will stop keeping these eventually, but I'm not ready to quit yet. When we're like 80 sitting in rocking chairs on our porch, I want to be able to say "Hey, remember when we first met?" And be able to pull up these old emails and PM's and stuff, so we can read them. Then, if we are still both up to it, go fuck like crazy!   Ok, here I am.  This PC and Hotmail don't always get along, Hotmail seems to perform Illegal Operations constantly...  Free = suck, have I mentioned that?  You're so sweet!  When we're 80 sitting in rocking chairs, huh?  *cute*  Yeah, well, at the rate we're going, maybe we'll *finally* be fucking by then...  Convert the PMs into one big huge email and send it to yourself - the July 22 PM email...  >**YES! You are perfect! You are everything I WANT in a woman!!! You may not be EVERY man's perfect woman (because each man has his own idea of "perfect") but you are PERFECT to me!!!   I believe you today.  Huh, yet another first for Dennis!  You are incredible.......   >**(apartment)I know. I guess we need to really discuss that well.  Ok, this subject kicked my ass last night big time.  I feel better today.  It is weird for me to think about not having a steady "home."  I got scared.  But the more I think about it, the better it sounds to challenge myself with that much freedom!  I guess I'll stay in the house until it sells - then I'm gonna try drifting.  I've never drifted before.  I want to!  Another option, I suppose, is that you could stay at your parents' a little while longer, that is much cheaper for you, and I will have a better idea of things - my finances, what is going on specifically with Chris, my school schedule, etc - things that would have a major impact on us if we were to go in to an apartment together...  But your plan sounds good too - I'm going to be easy - I didn't feel easy last night - I was wanting solid answers, and you can't give me solid answers because so much of the future depends on things going on with me that you don't control.  I had to force myself to be easy here - make myself calm down and get to the point where I could shrug my shoulders and say, "It will work out."  I had to remind myself that what is meant to be will be.  And it will!  So I am not going to pressure myself (or you) on this subject anymore.  What is is.  What will be will be.  That's all there is to it.  >**It's ok, I'll swap from breast to breast. Or maybe I'll just stick to one to make the other really jealous, that way when I do give it some attention, it will have been aching to be touched?    As if I'm not aching for your touch enough as it is...   >**(licking hands)I wasn't really asking before/after, as I was trying to let you know the timeline of when I thought I saw you do it... (doh! like you'd need help remembering when!) I don't mind if you taste  And as long as you don't spit a bunch in my mouth, don't worry about what you do before you kiss me  If you have a little on your lips/tongue it's ok.    I wouldn't snowball you, but yeah, I know what you mean.  I honestly don't remember at what exact point the lick took place.  I do know that I didn't wash my hands right away, and we went outside to smoke...  ;)  I tasted myself on you when you kissed me Sunday night, and I don't mind that either.  You can stick your finger in my mouth too - I think I (usually) taste pretty good ;)  (Hmmm, and yet I've never wanted to taste any other chicks.  I'm weird like that - I think I must be the only girl alive who doesn't have a lesbian fantasy.)  >**Yes. I realize now that most of what went down in the motel was Dennis having a little bit of "performance anxiety". It was the FIRST time in a long time, the FIRST time with you, and I wanted to impress!... plus my extensive LACK of experience....   Well, please, please, please don't worry about any of that!  I swear to you, you are just fine.  Just wonderful!  Impress is not what I'm after - like I've said a million times, Dennis, what is between us is not about sex.  And I still believe that when everything is right, *everything* will be right.  You know what else?  I got you inside me.  That was more than impressive - more than enough, more than I could have dreamed for!  I love you!  You won't mess up.  I've had worse, trust me, much worse.  Don't start apologizing for sexual things, please, that's soooo what I've had to deal with for the past few years...  And it is very unattractive.  But I had performance anxiety Saturday night.  It wasn't you - it was just "whoa!"  So I understand what you are saying.  **I just need to practice a lot  Bear with me while I learn this new skill, ok?   Practice away!  Please?  Lots!  >**I'll be sure to tell you when I get ready to go next time  Next time you "get busy" just think about looking down at me and seeing me looking up at you from between your legs. Looking you right in the eyes as my tongue glides across your skin. As my lips land on you and suck.....   You didn't have to tell me you were going to cum, I felt that.  You could have (um, if you could have!) told me how GOOD it was right then and there.  But you know, I mean, it's sometimes kinda not so easy to verbalize when you feel that good, I totally understand.  Unless you're cumming in my mouth - then please tell me, tap me on the shoulder or something, you know - velocity and viscosity ;)  *gag reflex*  :)  OMG I have so gotten off just picturing / remembering you licking my stomach and breasts.  I guess I have to think about more, now that you've planted the seed in my head....  Um, but I'm going to do it on the floor so that I'm sure I won't hurt myself falling off the bed :)  You are sexy.  Sexy sexy sexy!  I like you a lot!  >**I love you too  I know what you're saying by not exactly knowing when things would "go off". That's how I was for you. I knew I was close......but it was hard to tell "how close". And then "POW"! It felt like my penis was a roman candle    Yeah, exactly.  I would have cum already with anyone else, or by myself.  But sometimes there is an extra level or two - and you were working your way up to God knows what level - maybe I haven't even been there before?  I know I passed at least two good "get off" points - and one of them was the second your mouth hit my skin.  That was the closest I came, honestly, and I didn't because I wanted a little bit more than just that ;)  >**I think this "new sex" that you're talking about DOES make everything just a wee bit weird.... plus the intensity of everything.... I feel like my mind goes into overload at times!   Yeah, it's like those two things are combining forces...  The "new sex" can be dealt with simply by getting used to each other - that's at least part of the reason why most people make out and what not before they actually fuck.  Also an important factor in a one night stand - the newness never wears off, so it's like an extra kick in the ass.  The intensity may never leave us, Dennis.  I'm sure there will be times when we don't both feel it as strongly as we have been.  But it will probably be something we can always call on when we want to.  Sometimes it will probably have it's way with us.  I like the intensity - I don't care to do things half way.  I like to live full-tilt as much as I can - I force myself to feel as much as I can take, sometimes more.  You just never know when the ride could be over, I guess.  I don't do everything, everyday like that - but when I have something important to do, I like to do it right, feel it.  You know?  >**(my drive last night)I love you. What you wrote above is very beautiful, like you, like your mind.   Thanks.  I feel so much better after spending quality time with my car.  What is it about driving that is so cathartic anyway?  I don't think I even broke 60.  I mostly tooled around in the rain with the radio off, listening to the wipers slap and the rain hit the car and the tires run through puddles.  Watched a million frogs jump across the road, saw things that made me laugh out loud - signs I'd written on, important spots from the past.  It was foggy, the pavement was steaming.  It was like a dream.  A lot to think about.  I *need* my little Neon.  She's my best friend!  >**One of these days I will take the Litchfield tour with you  I wonder if the reason that you are drawn there, to driving around there, is because the last time you went through anything like this, that is where you dealt with it? Well, for whatever reason, it feels like you are healing your wounds by going there and it feels good to know you're healing. If you want to call and talk, or if you need some space, or whatever you need, just let me know.   Hell yes you're going to get to go on the tour!  A three hour tour, a three hour tour...  :)  I'm not drawn here, I'm here because I don't have anywhere else to go.  I hate this little town - hate the little people who live here.  I have a lot of bad memories in this place, and I'm vunerable right now.  I guess I'm going to work on them, I can't run away from them.  I did find out that I did NOT remember the way to Jim's old house - Mt. Olive is only 2100 people, but I still missed a turn!  That blew me away!  I see that nobody I care about is still here.  Bo's house, Kit's house, everybody has moved on.  I can drive by, but they won't come out and talk to me.  It's weird - a very lonely feeling.  But I know the memories are everywhere.  I have a lot of exploring left to do.  I'm going to find me.  I don't need anything more from you than for you to just keep being you.  That's all I can ask.  Just hang on and let me go through this...  >**I LOVE YOU!!!!!  I love you too!  I LOVE YOU!!!!!

      From: dennis   To: marfells@hotmail.com  Subject: ply mouth?  Date: Wed 07/24/02 10:36 PM    I'm running a bit late at work, bastards are making me place a stupid  order @ 11:35! Oh well... anyway I'll see you on AIM ASAP! :-D **HUG** *kiss*   If you get this message 1 or more times via PM, just ignore it. I was  having a hard time getting it to "send". It was hanging up or something.  Oh well, here it is again either way:    (apts)Yeah, I know - shit takes time. I've got time... And I need time  too - so this is going to be fine. I don't mind talking about it -  checking in every once in a while to see how we're both feeling is fine.  But I got wonkey last night - just got my brain to shut off from  thinking too much. All better   **Cool. Glad that your brain is working again   >**(tasting me)I was wondering about that.... which is why I Listerined  myself while I was washing up.... I wasn't sure.....   LOL, well, you didn't do it soon enough, you kissed me! I don't care - I'm  not like, ooooh let me taste - it's more for effect. I know guys like  stuff like that, and I like showing off and being all sexy and shit Just  like licking my own nipples - it doesn't do so much for me, but it  seems so damn cool to other people that I keep doing it   **You are definitely a pleaser! It really does *not* do much for me for  you to get a little taste of yourself. But it seems pretty inconvenient  to stop and wash up before kissing, etc It kinda does do a little for  you to tast me! Not sure why, but it IS a bit of a turn on   **I'm sure I'll give you a taste of yourself from time to time via some  part of me   Heh. I can't think of anything...   ** me neither! 0   >**Thank you. The way I deal with things that bother me is to talk about  them. I'm a talker. The more I talk about something, the less it  bothers me. The more comfortable I feel about it.   I know. Like I haven't bounced a few crazy ideas off of you? Riiiight.   **Cool. I'm glad you understand what I'm doing. By talking, I feel much  better! You could probably tell how comfortable and "fixed" I was today   >**I know it connects you directly to your previous experiences if I say  "sorry" or act like I'm sorry.... which is why I'm worried about it!  Just like when you said the other day "just lay there and can't cum girl"....    Yeah, I know. You don't need to be sorry for it, I understand that shit  happens. You took a few minutes to settle down, but once you did, you  were ok too. I felt bad until I figured out what the hell happened to me  - and now that I understand and you understand, I don't feel bad at all.  It just happened that way. It's all good   **Cool. I'm glad we can work out stuff like this together! Just let me  talk, and talk back a bit, and we can fix just about anything!!!! We  work well together!!!   >**I won't say I'm sorry, if you don't, ok?   Sheesh! I can't help but say I'm sorry - but I'll always think about  what went wrong - what I could have done differently, how to fix it so  it won't be like that again. You're not going to get me to stop saying  sorry, but you get an A for effort   **Ok, but you get my point....   >**That's the idea!!! I definitely WANT *you!* It's NOT *you!* I was not  lying when I said that I wanted to be inside you!!! I still do!!! There  were just too many external variables that were fucking with my brain...    You're still welcome any time... Just ask I can't resist the way you ask...  I like it...   **We'll do something like that again very soon.   >**You'll know. I'll be sure to let you know! God that sounds so sexy....    Yeah, I always find the *gag reflex* really hot too...   **It's not the choking/viscosity part(DUH! lol!), it was where you said  "cumming in my mouth"! That phrase is pretty fucking hot! If you ever  ASK me to do that, it will drive me wild! OMG! It just flips some switch  in my head. Why does that turn us guys on? I mean really? If you ever  want me to cum *anywhere*, just ask....   >**I got off this morning by thinking about being inside you again. YOU  are sexy!!! YOU are the most sensual person I have ever met. You drive  me crazy! Do not for 1 second doubt that you are the woman I want to  fuck more than any other.   I don't doubt it. Not in the least. We'll get there, cause I feel the  same way about you. Not only do I want to have you for my own selfish  reasons, I also really want to give myself to you - and I want to show  off a little bit... (hehe, I'm laughing out loud for real... )   **Yes, feel free to "show off"   Uh-huh! Delicious? That made me smile big time - I'm very happy to have  been doing delicious things to you.   **Yes, the things you were doing were VERY delicious! Your touch is very  sexy! You are very sexy! You make me feel very manly and make me want  to cum for you.   I do the plateau thing a lot by myself - you know, getting there can be  about as much fun as the main event. I had this conversation with you. I  remember! I was laying on my bed wearing not a lot of clothing... Yep.  Good memory!   **Yes, by myself, getting there just isn't that fun.... but with you, or  with your help(cyber, or just thinking of you) it IS fun getting there!    >**I also could have cum at least 2x on Sunday night, but I didn't want  to make a mess on your sleeping shorts....lol.   Do I look worried? I wasn't worried about your sheets, was I? Shit  washes... Or you could just spread it all around with a Kleenex for me...     **Ok, I will hold no orgasms for you, at least not because of that!   **Oh, and next time, I'm going to just rub it in and have you lick  whatever's left on my hands and penis off!   >**Next time, I'm fucking you full throttle for the orgasm. Which, when  I say it, makes me feel selfish at first.... and the last thing I want  to do is be selfish to you in that respect.... but then I realize "If I  cum, it's good for her too!"   Not selfish. Remember - it all evens out in the long run. Cause dammit,  I can fuck you till I cum and roll over and go to sleep too! I haven't  forgotten how to do that:!: And yes, getting you off is very good for me    **Yep, we have to work on this stuff! I think that both of us are having  a few *little* issues in our minds about this stuff. It surprised me  that you were worried about not being able to get off! I DO NOT think  that will be a problem! Just take the first exit a couple of times first  to get comfortable the experience. That's what I'm talking about above  by "going for the orgasm".   >**....but I want to cum....but.... ". Fuck that. I'm fixing this!!! And  the way I have to do it is to have sex with you and cum inside you! A  lot! Such terrible therapy   Yeah, that is going to suck. Hurry up and fix this problem so that we  won't have to have sex anymore, would you? Geez!   **Um.... I don't think that we'll stop fucking at all once this is "fixed"  lol! I think we will have a hard time NOT fucking! Look at the way we  are together!   Selfish is not all bad. I swear it. Why pressure yourself into thinking  that everybody has to get off every time? Sometimes it's going to be  about me. I'm not going to give that up. Sometimes I'll be perfectly  happy to take care of you quickly and I'll wait my turn. It's not a big  deal. It isn't realistic to expect fireworks for everybody - sometimes  there just aren't any fireworks. That doesn't make it a bad deal, I  promise! It's just life.   Do what you gotta do, if you want to cum, well then do it. I'm not going  to stop you! Cause I promise someday the shoe will be on the other foot.    **Thank you for saying that stuff. It makes me feel better. I'm sure it  WILL all even out   You're welcome. I am starting not to cringe when I send you those  thoughts. I'm starting to believe that you enjoy reading them. I am  starting to know that I can't scare you away with them. If you are going  to have me, you are going to have all of me. I can't be fake and only  give you the good. You get it all. Lucky you   **I AM lucky! Who else has gotten ALL of you? The more you share, the  more of you that's available for me to love! I love everything you've  given me of yourself, totally and completely. There is nothing that you  could say (besides the OBVIOUS THINGS, like "I DON'T love you anymore")  that would have a negative effect on me. So don't be afraid. The  communication is what makes us work! And yes, most of your silly little  things are COOL to me!   It's 9:00 - I'm going to log off and put Chris to bed. Then I'm heading  out to buy cigarettes and drive around. I'm heading out east of town  tonight, I think. I went north and south last night, not too far either  way, and not way out in the boonies because of the weather. It is  gorgeous out tonight, clear and cooler. I'm going to sit by the lake for  a while and watch the stars come out. Then I'll head east from there,  don't know how far I'll make it, but the "drag racing" road is out that  way!!! I can't be out too late, I've got to get my ass out of here early  tomorrow morning.   **I'm glad that you had a good time And again, I'm glad that you share  these beautiful images with me. You make me smile   I love you, and I don't care if you've heard it before. I NEED to tell  you!   **I love you, and love saying it! I was just being silly, silly!   **KISS**   Dennis

      From: dennis   To: marfells@hotmail.com  Subject: Good read!  Date: Thu 07/25/02 10:35 PM    http://www.rehermorrison.com/techTalk/08.htm   Thought you might like that.... was searching for some stuff and  stumbled onto it!   Here's the whole index to the articles:  http://www.rehermorrison.com/techTalk/indexStart.htm   That should keep you busy for a while if you get bored ;-)   Talk to you soon!   *kiss*   Dennis   PS-For Larry...   This is a copy/paste of a post I made on a list tonight about why big  cams don't work and how to use them right in turbo 2.2/2.5's....   "If you are reading this and have never sat down and tried to figure out   your compression ratio mathematically, you will be confused about what  I'm saying below. This is pretty advanced stuff. Read a book that tells  you how to figure your compression ratio if you are interested in  learning this.   If you have microsoft Excel, you can download a bunch of formulas  including a compression ratio calc I wrote into a spreadsheet by simply  clicking this link: http://www.fwdmopar.com/sites/dennis/math.xls   The first reason that most large camshafts do not work in our cars is  because the static compression ratio is too low, which kills the dynamic   compression ratio when the intake valve closes later.   Almost everyone is afraid to raise the static compression ratio for fear   of breaking something.   Lets say a stock 2.5T1 has 145psi cranking compression... now stick a  S60 in and the cranking compression drops to about 120psi.   Imagine if you raised the static compression ratio enough so that the  cranking compression w/the S60 cam was 145psi again...   This is what you'd need to do to make the big cams work, among other  things.   There is a formula for calculating how much to raise the compression  ratio in order to account for a longer duration camshaft. This formula  is complex, but what it basically does is use the *trapped volume* of  intake charge as your *volume at BDC* figure instead of BDC. Trapped  volume is basically anything that happens after the intake closes while  the piston is on the compression stroke. When it closes, call that point   BDC and use the volume in the cylinder at that moment as your figure  when figuring *dynamic* compression ratio.   So, in effect, we could figure the dynamic CR of a stock 7.8:1 2.5T1  w/an 89TBI roller (intake closes @56deg ABDC). Then figure out how much  to raise the compression ratio in order to use a longer duration  camshaft.   Ok, let the math begin! I have another REALLY HUGE Excel spreadsheet I'm   working on to answer this, but it might be easier and more accurate to  simply mock the engine up and measure the remainder of the stroke left  when the intakve valve rests on the seat.   Variables like rod ratio, piston pin offset, and actual valvetrain  geometry could throw this formula off quite a bit I think.   Oh, and another thing to think about before you get too excited....  bigger cams move the powerband higher.... not usually the best thing to  do if your cylinder head looks like it was designed by Briggs and  Stratton!"

Just let me  talk, and talk back a bit, and we can fix just about anything!!!! We  work well together!!!   Yes, we do.  And I'm sure there is more weirdness to come.  I'm just too  weird all on my own - so I know there will be more :)  **Yeah, you're so fucking weird! Sheesh.... it's a good thing I am too!  :-D We can fix ANYTHING if we set our minds to it and agree to fix it.  We are AWESOME together!  Oh, like the fact that Matt just sent me a big wordy letter to Chanda.   He's not sending it to her, but he wanted me to read it.  Sometimes I  don't want to help people.  They get all retarded and shit, and it's not  like I don't have my own issues at the moment...  :x  But I help  despite myself.  He's listened to God knows how much of my bitching.   Scratch my back and I'll scratch yours...  Matt is not a good writer.  He's not good at expressing himself - gets  all chopped up and focuses on the wrong things in his writing.  But I  know what he's saying.  It's almost like he's talking to a child - the  way he writes to Chanda.  It hurts me to see people hurting.  it *really*  bothers me that Chanda has hurt two of my good friends like she has -  and she doesn't seem to have a fucking clue.  That is very, very  irritating!  **I can only imagine! Holy Cow! Good luck with helping and listening...sometimes  when you're not involved it gets pretty annoying...lol. I hope Chanda  sees a counselor, or at least finds a guy that she can be fucked up with  in a good way ;-)  (cumming on command)You must really want me to say it, considering how *challenging*  you make it sound there...  Which, I must admit, stopped me from saying  it Thursday.  I though seriously about it, but decided to hold that  card for a later date.  (That would be the BJ card ;)  )  **Yeah, what we're doing now IS PLENTY INTENSE! There's no need to flip  all the cards over in the first round of the game... ;-) No need to tip  your hand just yet :-) You said to tell you what I liked....  I wanted to ask you to cum a few times...  but I never did...  I had to  bite my lip to stop myself from saying it at least once!  I still haven't  asked you at all, other than the way you say my hand "begs" you ;)  I  think that's part of holding back.  **I think it's FINE to hold THAT back. To save a little for "next time"  or "later". But then again, you only live once! And it's not like I'll  get "bored" with these kind of "tricks" too easily ;-) So do what you  want to do. There are a lot of new things to try yet! I bet there's some  stuff we don't even know about! And I could NEVER GET BORED WITH YOU!  WE ARE A NEVER ENDING STORY!   I've been pondering that today...  Why am I holding back at all?  Part  of it is surely the "new sex" factor - which is fading to some extent...   But I've *had* to for the past seven years - Paul wound up catching  someone he didn't know what to do with once he had her.  It's been a  long time since I've been with someone who could handle me.  Haha, and I  feel rusty ;)    **It's ok. We'll work our way into this groove together :-) There is NO  pressure from me. Yeah, when I'm horny I may ask or even "beg" for you  to do something....lol.... but please realize that it DOES NOT mean that  you HAVE to do it! It just means I'm terribly horny and I'm getting  desperate for an orgasm.... I'll calm down and act civilized again as  soon as my erection is gone! And if you say NO and mean it, I'm done  asking...  And for some reason I'm scared that if I *fuck* you, I'll somehow wind  up taking us down the *all sex all the time, but nothing more* path.    Why am I worried about that?  It's silly.  I know we are so much more  than that.  I know we're like an iceberg, we're only seeing 10% of the  whole right now.  I think silly things.  Get silly thoughts stuck in my  head...  **Yep, you said what I was going to type! Heck, we JUST started having a  sexual relationship! You are SO MUCH MORE to me than just a sex partner!  You are AWESOME! Yeah, I get the feeling I'm trying to make up for lost  time..lol! Like when you're really hungry, you'll eat more than usual  for a while ;-) When you meet someone that you're REALLY attracted to  and feel VERY comfortable sexually with... guess what you're going to do  a lot of? ;-) If we have *too much* sex by your standards, I CAN back  off... Just let me know. Tell me how you feel. I've been taking care of  things by myself forever... so it won't bother me to *handle* things  myself sometimes ;-) You can even watch... if you want! ;-)  Good things don't happen to me!  When things seem to be good, I tend to  run away.  I love you so much, I can't run.  This is new and scary and  fun and good and everything all at once.  It's a LOT.  Plus I have a few  other things going on in my life that are not easy either.  In some  respects, I couldn't do this without you.  But then again, it sure would  make things easier between us if I wasn't doing this right now...  **I know.... Don't worry that any of these issues will make me leave. I  am here! I am yours! You are mine! I will help you and you will help me.  That's the way this works, the way I work, the way WE work :-) I'm  committed to YOU. Good things have never happened to me before.... at  least not on this scale! I guess it's our turn huh? :-D :-D :-D We've  sure-the-fuck waited long enough for something good like this! So lets  enjoy it!!! I'm gonna!!! *KISS*!!!!  >**Yes, the things you were doing were VERY delicious! Your touch is  very sexy! You are very sexy! You make me feel very manly and make me  want to cum for you.  Uh-huh...  *eyes roll*  *shiver*  GOD you are so good at pressing my  buttons!  **I wasn't even trying to push a button! I was just saying what I felt...  I guess that's why I'm so good at it? Because most of the time I'm not  trying? lol   >**Oh, and next time, I'm going to just rub it in and have you lick  whatever's left on my hands and penis off!   You were *almost* right...  So will you settle for just playing with it  till it gets sticky??? ;)  **Whatever :-) I would have cleaned you up with a kleenex, but I was  almost out and you didn't seem too happy about it the last time! lol  Gotta do SOMETHING with it! ;-) I'm easy. I was just teasing and seeing  if I could find another button...hehe! There's only one way to find the  buttons... As you may or may not be able to see, I keep playing with the  equalizer and seeing if you're diggin the music or not. So far, my  favorite settings are DAMN CLOSE to yours!   >**I AM lucky! Who else has gotten ALL of you? The more you share, the  more of you that's available for me to love! I love everything you've  given me of yourself, totally and completely.   God, I'm still stuck trying to let it sink in that you understand my  license plate.  You keep blowing my mind.  Do you know how long ago I  chose that path for myself?  I got my license plate in 1995.  But I had  the nickname a long time before then.  I can't believe you love me like  you do!  I just cannot fucking believe it!  I am still struggling to  believe that you are *real* - even though I know you are, it's just so  easy to forget - you're so perfect by my standards - I still imagine  that I must have willed you into being somehow.  **All I can do is smile :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)  :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)And  assure you that I *AM* real :-) And that I feel the same way about you!  But my license plate doesn't mean anything ;-)  Thank you for loving me.  **You're welcome, and thank you for loving me back!   ** *KISS* **HUG** I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Dennis

I don't know - there are some things that you just can't TELL people...  No matter how many times you try, they never listen.  *sigh*  I don't even care - not about her.  It's just that Matt is my buddy, and I can't stand it when people feel that badly about themselves.  I fucking *hate* that she's done this to him...  Then again, he's not guilt-free - he's smarter than that...  DUH!!!!!  Fucking DUH, Matt, what the hell did you expect?  I'm not being nice to him - I'm giving him the straight shit.  I'm tired of beating around the bush with him - I have a very strong urge to just drive up to Ames and shake the fuck out of a few people!  Heh...  What I said to Mookie finally sunk in.  Didn't matter how many times I *told* him - he needed this to happen to see it clearly.  But he's telling me I was right all along.  I called a spade a spade - and he tried like hell to defend Chanda.  Duh...  I swear, if people would just fucking *listen* to me, all would be right with the world ;)  (Hehe!)  >**Yeah, what we're doing now IS PLENTY INTENSE!

And I'm determined to get these little issues worked out, and honestly some of them can't be *talked* out - some of them just require practice ;)  We don't have to wind up naked everytime we see each other, either, but I've never faught either way.  I haven't pushed for it, I haven't tried to stop it either.  When we're together, if we're just together, that's fine.  If we're naked, that's fine too.  I'm taking it as it comes (which makes me sing a fucking awesome Doors song, I love the Doors!!!  Now I'm stuck on it, so I must sing aloud... *time to live, time to die, time to laugh, time to cry, take it easy baby, take it as it comes, don't move too fast,  if you want your love to last, you've been movin' much too fast...  time to walk, time to run, time to aim your arrows at the sun....*  Oh gosh, I *need* to buy that album (The Doors, their first one) if I don't have a few key songs on my box set... yep, I've got The Doors box set!  I love Jim Morrison...  Wow, I'm like way off track here....  Anyway, Jim Morrison is a fucking poet.  I love his words.  He was crazy too.  Shame he drank himself to death!  Uh-huh - so, Dennis, if you don't already rock the Doors, I'm going to share that with you - ok?  Cause they've been a constant presence in my life, and you know how I am about music...  You know, I've been paying attention to the music in my head a lot more since I met you - I used to do this all the time.  I believe that when a song pops into my head, there is a reason for it - I kinda think my subconscious talks to me in chords sometimes...  I try to listen, get the message.  Let the music be your master - huh - Led Zeppelin.  :-D  See?  >**I know.... Don't worry that any of these issues will make me leave. I am here! I am yours! You are mine!

You know how I was telling you that I don't like to do things half-assed - I try to *experience* things.  I'm experiencing you, I reckon.  And I love the fact that you share yourself with me - the good, the bad, the ordinary and mundane, your intelligence, your fears, your stupid jokes - you haven't shown me anything that makes me love you less.  Speaking of which, please don't worry about me running off with someone else.  The only way I can think of that I'd ever do that would be if I just gave up and got totally scared of you - of US, I mean, and I was looking for a skeezy way out...  And I've held on this long, so I don't think that's likely.  I LOVE you.  I know that we're supposed to be together.  I *KNOW* it.  You are IT - I'm serious, I'd be a fucking fool to even think about finding someone who could hold a candle to you in just about every respect.

      From:   Paul Yevcak   To:   spoolboy@autospeed.com Subject:   Need some answers Date:   Fri 08/02/02 11:13 AM       Hey,  I had really hoped that you would e-mail me, and explain this whole  thing; without my having to e-mail you first and ask questions. Those few times that you and I e-mailed each other, you told me quite a  few things.  You told me that you were opening up your armor, for one thing. I can't quote directly because I no longer have any record of those e-mails, be it digital or a print-out.  You told me, time and again, awhile back, that you would NEVER do  anything with another man's wife that you shouldn't be doing.  You told me that  you respected Shannon enough not to do that until we're officially through.  You told me that you respected ME enough to not doing things such as you have been doing.  You told me that you knew it was in no one's best interest  to be intimate with Shannon until this was all through.  You AND Shannon  told me that if need be, you guys would just cool everything until this is  all over.  It took me over ONE FULL WEEK of CONSTANT dwelling on that fact, Dennis; but goddamnit, I honestly did end up believing that you were telling me the truth.  And now, especially given what you guys have done so far, I can't pull the huge knife out of my back.  Especially coming from you...I  BELIEVED YOU.  I liked hanging out with you, I thought you were a pretty damn  cool guy.  And now this.  For what??  Because it took me so long to actually believe what you were telling me, the "betrayal" I feel is absolutely ENORMOUS.  What changed Dennis??  What happened that made you decide to go against  what you (successfully) drilled into my head?   Do you even care about what's going on??  I know Shannon doesn't.  She has no plans on stopping what  is currently going on.    I honestly don't even want to begin thinking about the things you guys  have done, and are doing.  It literally turns my stomach.  True, I don't love Shannon any more, I'm not attracted to her anymore; and to be honest, I never really was 100% attracted to her.  That's not what upsets me.  It's the fact, again, that both of you spent days upon days telling me that nothing would happen.  You guys both told me that none of this would happen until this is all through; because it was the RIGHT thing to do.  Shannon said you're  worth waiting for; you've said that Shannon is worth waiting for.  So what changed??  I want to hear your side of this.  I've heard all I  care to hear from Shannon; now it's your turn.  Please don't just put this e-mail in your recycle bin.  I want to hear  your side of this.   If nothing else, I feel that I AM owed an explanation at least. And also, please don't be brief with me.  If I ever hope to get any sort of  closure here, I NEED to hear what you have to say.  It sucks, too, because I honestly did want to make it through this as  your friend; but never once did I think you guys would ever end up doing what you've been doing.  All I can guarantee now is that I'll be civil towards you.  A "hi" and a "bye" is probably all that I'll be able to manage.   And that really sucks, Dennis.  I wanted to continue being your friend, and  I DID look forward to many car discussions, and picking your brain about automotive things.  But honestly, right now I don't think that's ever  going to happen. I feel hatred right now, I feel like I've been slapped in the face by both of you, and I feel hurt right now.  To put it bluntly, and you probably already know this, most of that anger is directed towards you.  Most of  the hurt was caused by you.  I truly believed every word you told me when  you and I exchanged those few e-mails awhile back.  I never fully believed  that Shannon was ever telling me the truth when she said that nothing would happen between you guys.  That's why I brought it up so many frickin'  times with her.  But you, on the other hand, I finally found it inside to  believe what you were telling me.  I knew that Shannon would make suggestive comments, and probably "hit" on you; but I got consolation believing  that you would not return the same actions.  One more thing...I know that you'll show this e-mail to Shannon...but  can you at least reply to it before you do that??  I don't want her reading this, and tainting your response(s).  Shit, that's all I can manage to type right now.  I need to get my mind  on other things.....  Later

      From:   "Shannon Yevcak"   To:   spoolboy@autospeed.com Subject:   Closing time... Date:   Mon 08/05/02 02:43 PM        I'm singing.  Listening to the music in my head.  "Every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end..."  I have no idea who sings that song - some one hit wonder, maybe?  I don't know!  I don't care in the least, I like that line - I'm feeling it today...   Huh.   We've only got so long before we don't need to email each other anymore!  That's almost sad.  Even though this was *fast* - it seems so long ago when you sent me that PM and I shot back my terse reply...  I feel as if I've known you forever.  Somehow.  But there is still so much I don't know.  I'm not worried that I'll ever find something I don't like, or can't learn to deal with - something that WE can't deal with together...  I can't wait!  I'm so excited about really getting to know you - in real life, in bed, in all of the weird situations I'm sure we'll find ourselves in the middle of... (You know how I am, I can never leave well enough alone!  What happened to the curious kitty again???)  You're fun, and I know that somehow no matter how much life throws at me from this point on, you'll still find a way to make me smile.  Probably just by existing.  Thanks for existing, Dennis!   I still have volumes of text in me.  Bits and bytes and gigs and all of that.  But I'm not going to be recording it for posterity anymore.  DAMN!  I'll be talking to you in person, in OUR apartment!  I guess we'll have those first few layers of our onion forever, won't we?  That's cool.  GO YOU for saving our emails - you're smart!  How'd you know?  Yep, the more I think about it, the more I think you **did** have a plan from the get-go.  Heeeeeh.  *sigh*  I am feeling (cause I know you'd ask me if you were with me!!!) comfortable and still a little twinge of sad.   Paul is getting much better as the day wears on.  He is buying Rob's motorcycle (CBR954RR, w/ some monor tweaks on it) later this week, or over the weekend.  He IMd me and asked, "Can I ask you one last thing before we go our separate ways forever?"  He wants to take me for a spin on the bike after he gets it.  Motorcycles scare me.  In a not nice, non-rollercoaster kind of way.  I don't like them so much.  I like going fast!  I like acceleration!  But I like having at least *some* metal surrounding my body - even if it isn't so much worse to be out in the open like that - it just scares me.  Dunno.  Anyway - that's a big thing for him to ask me.  We had a nice IM session - we both wound up crying.  He cried harder, I have trouble emoting in public ;)  He's got a cube, I'm, like, OUT here in the middle of the room, kinda.  Then I went to smoke and gave him a big hug.  I think he might just make it out of this...  That makes me so happy!  I do love him, I honestly do - he's my baby daddy, you know?  I just can't live with him.  I *thought* he had it in him to do this with me.  But for a while he really scared me!  I started to doubt him big time, thought about making a bid for Chris because I wasn't even sure if Paul was capable of taking care of him.  He'll make it!  I'm really happy about that - he *is* a good person, I swear he is.  Even though he's gone out of his way to show you otherwise...  Hopefully you two will come to be sociable with each other, even if you never quite make it to being "friends."   Haha, thank god for you, Dennis.  I don't know if I'm going to make it all of the time.  I could not do this without you.  You caught me at the last possible moment.  How on earth did this happen?  How did you know?  Who sent you?  I LOVE YOU!   Keep being easy.  Be gentle with me.  I've got a lot of things - old things, newer things, shit - there are issues that haven't even occured to me just yet - to deal with.  I want to deal with them.  I bet most of them have been held in for so long that they'll  be pretty quick and painless - like the deal with High School that I finally resolved by driving around Litchfield two nights in a row.  It was a lot easier to get through than I thought it would be.  I suprised myself - that was the night I remember just how strong I am.  Paul seemed to make it impossible for me to spend energy on myself.  I was so busy giving - to Chris and Paul and the relationship - and not getting a whole lot back.  I think I had almost exhausted myself.  That's why I was about to quit feeling.  I was running on fumes.  I think I must have given extra hard to Paul - trying to make him love me...  I never did it on purpose, but I think I must have been doing it all along.  He told me today that, "even though I knew it was doomed from the beginning, I still wound up falling in love with you."  I think he's confusing love and in love.  I don't think we were every totally 110% IN love with each other.  I'll readily accept the fact that he loves me.  That's quite ok...  It's better that way - we'll be good parents after we get it figured out!  I've loved lots of people without being in love with them.   Maybe, now that I've met you, I should think - reconsider - have I ever been in love before?  I wonder.  I'm too tired to give it the proper treatment right now, but remind me to think about it someday, will ya?   I *AM* in love with you, Dennis, 100%, no doubts, no worries, no catches, no hangups, no strings - I love you.   *whew*  Today feels like a big day somehow.  A day to rest and get myself psyched up for something BIG.  Like eating spaghetti before a marathon ;)  It feels somewhat like suspended animation too - Paul has let me go (or is letting me go finally) and you don't quite have me all the way just yet.  I don't feel bad - just I guess tired enough and clear-headed enough to take a second to reflect.  I don't want to forget this day - I feel like I need this deliniation.  It's MY day.   Well, I have work to finish...   And I'm calling you when I get home anyway...   *yawn*   Shannon
