      Wouldn't it be sad if from the time we were born we knew exactly where we would end up in life? I personally don't believe in fate, but it might just be because I don't want to think that I don't have control in the outcome and direction of my own personal life. I enjoy being able to think that if I wanted to, I could completely change everything, and nothing would be predetermined.  But at the same time I can't help but wonder if my life will end up the same way no matter what.

      Wow that is quite an idea to ponder.  It gave my liver a huge ego boost but then was immeadiatly shut down by my heart reminding it of the beating it will take during college.

      I mean, I *heart* marching band!  That reminds me of the cadaver book I read and it posed the thought of what if humanity still thought the spiritual center of the body was the liver.  It would be like "I *liver sign* marching band!".

      School starts in two days.  I just can't believe that.  It's like I've not even had a summer.  I'm excited because (1) I'm a junior and (2) I *liver sign* learning!  And Mrs. Bovender is simply awesome.  And as excited as I am I'm also not really looking forward to working myself to death.  But it's encouraging to think by the end of this year I'll know Calculus, and high-level chemistry, and be fluent in Latin, and know more about the history of the United States than I ever wanted to know, and be able to write an incredible essay in a short period of time....not to mention play a piano concerto. :)   Gah the PSAT is soon too.  I had this grand idea of me making like 2000 flashcards and learning all the words but I'm so tired right now.  I have to read my other book this weekend as well...which I haven't even started on.  Life is just too complicated sometimes...having to juggle schoolwork and music and social things.

      So the dreaded day has finally arrived... it's the last day of summer vacation (for me...) I can't believe school is starting- it seems like exams just finished! Hopefully this year won't be as bad as I think it will be- I'm trying to be optimistic. There will be good things, I'm sure, minus the stress/ homework/ exhaustion. Yay for learning! hahahaha

      so i'm finally posting in here. i'll try to come in here when i have some spare time. but today is the first weekend after school started. my week has been vigorous, filled with running all the way across campus to get to economics. and i get to see chloe every morning because she's in the portable next to my class (i think she's in government, but that's just a guess).  has anyone heard about that crazy get-together somewhere near franklin? i'm thinking that no one's going to go, plus i have a gig that day. ah. the smell of money.  -Terra-

      I got my license this morning... woohoo! The DMV is a pit of evil, but whatever. At least I spent just a little over 2 hours there... not bad at all! So yeah, now I can go anywhere I want and explore the world! Right. Well anyway, at least I'll be able to escape eventually. In the mean time, life will go on.  School starts in a week and yearbook starts tomorrow ~ grrrrr. I guess lots of people are already back... sorry if it's you. Have fun.... hehe!

      Five minutes ago I took some pictures of the chickens and now I can show them to you all.  I mean, that's just amazing.  urlLink http://worldzone.net/travel/rollercoast//annekatie.jpg  There's Anne(left) and Katie(right)   urlLink http://worldzone.net/travel/rollercoast//rachel.jpg   And there she is, Rachel. :) *Edit*I guess they were too big...oh well...just click on the link instead.   I've been so busy you guys.  School starts in two days and I still have to read another book for English.  I'm not really worried about any of my classes except English.  I just don't know how well this will all work out this fall.  But I signed myself up for it, and several of my friends have the same classes I do, so if they survive, I can too.  I should probably quit whining now and go start reading.  Let's see....450 pages should take about 9 hours....ideally....gahhh!  Well I'm glad you all liked the DVD.  It was really fun to put together.  And no, that's not me playing the nocturne..haha.  But I'm flattered that you ever considered the possibility.  Band camp finally ended.  My feet are killing me.  Something of note: You have "set" position, where you stand still before you start moving and you stand when you halt inbetween songs or during songs, and so while you're practicing you end up standing like that a lot.  In previous years at set our feets have been together like skis, but this year they changed it to 3rd position (I think that's right), with your feet at 90Â° angles.  And I'm just not used to standing like that for so long.  It's really wierd.  But anyway, I love band! Haha....

      PONYYYYYYYY!!!!! Wow, that DVD  was so fabulous. I definitely cried myself to sleep last night after watching it, but you know what? It actually made me so happy remembering all the little nuances of life at GSFTA that only photographs can truly capture.... and I forgot the way your second toes do that funky curve thing... hehe! Oh the memories... (sniffle, sob, sniffle) But yes, I do love the chickens. I'm still curious to see what my chicken looks like though and if it has any resemblance to me.... anyhoo, thanks a bunch and you're the bestest!!!! (I just love violating grammar rules!!)

      Hey everyone, sorry I've been lazy and busy.  Things have been crazy with my mom's business.  That's why I've been going to bed so late.  I don't mind helping her, I get paid a bit, but I'll be glad when she hands all of the financial stuff back over to her business partner.  I'm just tiiiiired and bored even though I have so much to do.  Piano? Wow, yeah, I won't go into that.  I did get to use my keyboard to play with a band (Rachel, it's Holly and her cousin and a couple of other guys), so that was fun.  I jammed! As a non- classical musician! hehe Why I have no motivation today I don't know why.  Well Rachel, you aren't the only one with depressing thoughts like that.  Time... it blows my mind.  Time having significance and well yeah, it's crazy thinking.  Being tired makes these thoughts even odder.  And other stuff, yeah.  I won't dwell though, I'm in a good mood.  I drove with the windows down and music playing today.  It made me happy. Well I guess I'll go practice piano, perhaps rehookup my keyboard.  Or maybe go to Starbucks and make myself sit down and read? I hope things are going well with you friends. Oh, by the way, TYLER: AWESOME dvd! I loved it! I would have cried if I were watching it alone (my mom chose to view it with me) hehe. I miss gov school.  But yes, I loved the way you put the clips of the performances and the pictures and the music all together! Someone to waaaaaatch over meeee

      So hmmmm.... is there any point to life? Cause I definitely can't decide. Sometimes I  think there must be because otherwise, how could time have any significance? The stars are indifferent to time; maybe life is necessary. That made no sense. Time would go on regardless. Who knows? Some days I just think that life was a happy accident~ random and pointless but still awesome. And then I guess there are the days when "screw life" seems to sum it all up~ I'd be better off as a rock. Ooooh that's depressing. I hate those days... I'm generally, or at least I used to be, a fairly happy, cheerful, optimistic person. I just don't know what happened; most people manage to make their lives what they want them to be but that talent seems to have escaped me. I seem to take an almost sick pride in working so insanely compulsively at school~ I have no idea why because I end up hating every second of it. It makes me hate my life and question why I continue going on. It should be so easy to just be happy, but it's not. I have nothing to complain about at all, no major problems in my life or difficulties to overcome. I'm such a whiny brat to be unable to deal with myself as I am when the rest of the world has such immense obstacles in the path to happiness. Then I just laugh at my insignificance and wonder why I even exist. I soooo need to shut up now. Ok, on a lighter note.... you people rock my world!!! I can't believe how lucky I am to have such fabulous friends... we really need to stay in touch next year because otherwise I really will go crazy. I'm sorry about that last paragraph of pointless ranting.... I have no idea what prompted that bit of depressing nonsense. Please disregard it. Je vous aime!!! And don't forget to squeak!!!!!!!

      Squeeky Mouse, you are officially dubbed AWESOME by Jorge.  This is such a good idea.  Well I just got back from band all day in the 90 degree heat, and I'm exhausted.  I got a CD in the mail!  It's Brendel playing some Beethoven sonatas.  So I'm going to be a nerd and listen to it while I follow along in the score...haha.
