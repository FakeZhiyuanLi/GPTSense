      I've been selling books online since April, and am painfully aware of the vast ocean of book-knowledge that I haven't yet begun to cross. But even before I set out on that voyage, there's a smaller body of retailing commonsense I ought to master. Alas for me.  Who'd have guessed that there's a person out there who uses  orange highlighter  in an otherwise lovely  urlLink Heritage Press  edition of Christopher Marlowe? What'd they think it was, a textbook? Lesson #1: Don't wait until you're ready to sell the merchandise to give it a careful inspection, even if it looks great on the outside.

      Welcome to the blog of  urlLink ungeheuer books . I'm launching this blog as a way to track my learning curve in the bookselling business; I hope it will be fun, useful, and above all, honest--I plan to record my failures and stupidities as well as my successes and insights. We'll be right back after this word from our sponsor.

      ...before the anti-free-market nincompoops started  urlLink whining about Google . Choice quote:  Behind Google's complex ranking system is a simple idea: each link to a page should be considered a vote, and the pages with the most votes should be ranked first. This elegant approach uses the distributed intelligence of Web users to determine which content is most relevant.  But what is good for Google is not necessarily good for the rest of the Web.  Yeah, God forbid that the distributed intelligence of web users should influence web site popularity. I demand more votes for the little web site! Popular web sites should be made to hand over some of their readers--they've got enough for all of us!  Ooooh, and you know what? (Cue foreboding Fahrenheit 9/11 music) I did a Google search on "Dick Cheney" and got over   one million hits  !!! I smell a cover-up.

       So I wasted a whole Saturday futzing around on the computer; what's your point? Anyway, I just bought an entry-level digital camera to take pictures of sets of books (too hard to get a dozen of them to sit still on the scanner). Thought I'd try it out on Daisy, our five-year-old housemate:        The cats have taught her to affect an air of indifference, but I can tell she's secretly impressed.

      Taking a page from  urlLink Keith Burgess-Jackson , I'm going to post quotes from academic journal articles and books that strike me as absurd, outrageous, reality-challenged, or some tasty combination thereof. As I lack his philosophical charity, however, I won't be able to refrain from appending snarky comments to them. Here's the inaugural Quackademism:  The already ambiguous conflation of nation-state (Soviet) and ideology (communist) in the portrayal of enemies abstracted and covered over a many-layered set of repressions that not only silenced women, but also others colonized by national projects, whose objections or affiliations might bring them fatally back into view. The subject of the Cold War was military, although the war enlisted all of everyday life. This had the effect of making all other discourses seem not only internal, but also more subjective, more unreal as more distant from the military project. Even the struggle between science and the national interest was not won by science, and those scientists who insisted on sharing atomic secrets could be put to death as spies. Maximum objectivity and realism was not attributed to the scientists who advocated open international inquiry, but rather to the bureaucracy that took away their passports. [Snip of some previews of chapter 4] Surely the Rosenberg executions enforced not just power but belief in the possibility of subversion through sharing of scientific knowledge, now conflated with the development of weaponry. The stakes were the highest: the arms race cost more than both world wars combined. "Verifiability" became a standard of proof and mark of suspicion shared by nuclear weapons negotiations and the philosophy of science (9).  --Clark, Suzanne.  Cold Warriors: Manliness on Trial in the Rhetoric of the West . Carbondale: Southern Illinois UP, 2000.  I grieve-- grieve --over the cruel fate suffered by those starry-eyed scientists whose passports were revoked by a hypermasculine, tobacco-chewing, John-Wayne idolizing, war-mongering "United" "States" "culture." The world would have been much better off had their attempts to sustain "open inquiry" succeeded. And the brave Rosenbergs were just making a desperate bid for peace, or at least fiscal prudence (seeing as how the arms race was so much more expensive than both world wars combined). How I wish we'd listened to the unilateral-disarmamorons; had the Soviets prevailed, the national project colonizing us would have been complete and total, and therefore much more egalitarian than the selective colonization of the tragically unhip Cold War era.

      The Winter 2003-2004 issue of  Academic Questions , the journal of the  urlLink National Association of Scholars --check them out if you don't know who they are--arrived in my mailbox yesterday (so it's a little late). In it,  urlLink Mark Bauerlein  writes a tough review of Gerald Graff's book,   urlLink Clueless in Academe: How Schooling Obscures the Life of the Mind  . Graff is probably best known for his book   urlLink Teaching the Conflicts  , which argues that poststructuralist "disciplinary" hypertrophy doesn't have to leave students behind. As an earnest graduate student looking for guidance in teaching, I found Graff's approach lucid but strangely tepid and unsatisfying, although I didn't really analyze why.  Bauerlein, on the other hand, sticks his scalpel right into the bad spots. I wish I could link to an online version of the review, or scan it in for you, but that would be wrong, so I'll just quote some choice bits:   [Graff's] name echoes of past controversies and his book sports an intiriguing title, but whether a noted professor in his twilight can muster the courage and clear-sightedness to carry out a thorough professional soul-searching is doubtful. Graff answers the question in his very first sentence:  This book is an attempt by an academic to look at academia from the perspective of those who don't get it.  It sounds good until you reach the last three words. To see academe from outside the campus walls and faculty cliques is a sanative aim. If humanities professors made the least effort to understand why Eugene Goodheart, Frederick Crews, and others criticize the field, instead of dismissing them as reactionaries and dumbbells, they might strengthen their own positions or even find points of agreement. But the "don't get it" phrase shortchanges the outsiders. Even though it suggests some sympathy for them, they are still the benighted, the confused, people who feel "shame and resentment" when facing the "impenetrability of the academic world" (91).  [. . .]  But look closely at at Graff's diagnosis of the problems and you find an evasion and a rationalization wholly consistent with the dithering appraisals of his generation. The runaround is simple: Graff attributes the breakdown of humanities education solely to a rhetorical failure. Scholars and teachers think sharply and reason skillfully, he insists, but they don't express their ideas in limpid speech. Advances in curriculum proceed, breakthroughs of theory have transpired, but the academic idiom hasn't articulated them well. Students shy away only because they don't speak the professors' language. In class, "Once students have to translate their personal interests and experience into the formalized conventions of written Arguespeak, their interests and experience no longer seem their own." Nothing in the values, principles, and knowledge of the professors is askew. It is, rather, only the communication that needs fixing. The humanities are dying, but Graff goes no further than urging, "We have to improve our message" (93).  [. . .]  To consider an infacility with Arguespeak the prime shortcoming of students is to overlook other, gaping deficiencies of skill and knowledge. Graff appears unconcerned with the fact that high school graduates can't write a periodic sentence, barely understand a passage of prose, disregard the classics, and can't pinpoint the half-century in which the Civil War took place. Feeble historical learning, declining reading scores, pitiful writing skills--all give place to a particular forensic, Arguespeak. Humanities education is training in academic discourse, not the study of history and literature. Rather than forming students into learned, eloquent minds, Graff's pedagogy shapes them into canny rhetors, that is, into junior imitations of their professors (94).  As if this weren't enough, Bauerlein's introductory paragraphs render a devastating picture of the rise of poststructuralist scholars:   [Humanities scholars in the 60s and 70s] like to remember those years as an uphill struggle against old-fashioned formalists, biographers, bibliographers, and arts appreciation-types, but I have yet to hear of a hotshot iconoclast skilled in structuralism who suffered for his beliefs. The fact is, campus conditions favored them. As administrators caved in to various protesters, they found a rationalization in the theory/politics tailwind and jumped to invest in the bold new critical world. [. . .] Life was good, and one can hardly blame the beneficiaries if they attributed the largesse to their own abilities instead of to post-War demographics and social movements. Why should a cutting-edge specialist in French thought ask about the social value of literary theory when so many were demanding his attention? A Marxist professor invited to lecture from Sydney to Zurich wouldn't think that his anti-capitalist rant in class might rile a local editor or state legislator or tuition-paying parent. No matter how radical or avant-garde or grave they pretended to be, in truth they were a pampered labor group. When conservatives did strike back and the press played along, the humanities professors entered the public debate with all the callow surety of people who've never faced a real political challenge in their lives. The joys were many, but saved from the ordinary struggles of adulthood and lacking respected antagonists--we shall not consider the contest of literary theories a serious challenge--they never learned the value of self-scrutiny and the pain of giving up a cherished notion. They were anxious, yes, but for their repute, not their ideas. In the intellectual realm, their self-certitude ballooned, and their imaginations withered (90).  Pow. Wish you could read the whole thing.

      The last time I blogged on poststructuralist quackademics--at the now-defunct  Naive Humanist --some readers rightly told me that if I'm going to grouse about what I think are futile directions in literary studies, I should say what I think are better directions.  As the subtitle of this blog indicates, I like cognitive science, and I especially like its potential for illuminating human responses to art. It's always seemed to me that the secret furnace powering arts scholarship is the question, "What about work  X  makes it great?" Put another way, the study of the arts is the study of aesthetics: Why do human beings like--often  love --certain human-made things more than others?  Of course, any mention of aesthetics in a graduate seminar now is likely to earn you a incredulous recital of the poststructuralist rosary:  There is no aesthetics; there is only power and that which serves power . But there are plenty of scientists who are unmoved by this dogma (and a growing number of literary scholars who either explicitly reject or quietly ignore it), and their work is beginning to yield some tantalizing insights--we're just at the beginning of our  urlLink journey to the center of the mind .  Here's a preliminary list of scientists and scholars whose work seems especially promising to me, in no special order:    Miall & Kuiken's  urlLink Empirical Research on Literary Reading     urlLink Mark Turner , especially his work on cognitive "blending"   urlLink Leda Cosmides and John Tooby , who bridge cognitive science and evolutionary psychology   urlLink Robert Storey  (granted, his work is more evolutionary than neuroscientific, but it's bracing and convincing)  Robert Zatorre's  urlLink studies of neural responses to music   Ellen Dissanayake's  urlLink investigations  of the purposes of art   I'll add to this list over time, and also devote an in-depth post or two to individual scholars.

      Joshua Holland has an  urlLink alarmist article  up on  urlLink AlterNet  on “Why Conservatives Are Winning the Campus Wars” that contains this interesting statistic:  While progressive student groups are mostly self-funded, by the mid-1990s roughly $20 million dollars were being pumped into the campus Right annually, according to People for the American Way.   What does "self-funding" mean? No PIRG funds? No grants? No school funds? Just tin-cup panhandling among the destitute proletariat? And how does $20M get "pumped" into the campus Right? That's not "self-funding"? They're being funded against their will? (Does a wealthy conservative go on campus and inveigle defenseless, naive students into starting conservative groups by promising them money?)   Then he trots out this shopworn little trope:   That money and expertise are directed at [among other things] demonstrating the liberal academic "bias" that justifies many conservatives' reflexive anti-intellectualism.  So if you just define your political vision as the "intellectual" approach, your adversaries become, ipso facto, troglodytes. This must have seemed a clever trick thirty years ago, but hasn't it frayed to transparency by now?  Via  urlLink Political Theory Daily Review .

      In chapter 12 of what Terry Eagleton calls a "devastating" and "brilliant" book, David Harvey invokes science to support his theory of postmodern culture (Harvey,  The Condition of Postmodernity . Blackwell, 1989). In my first--but, sadly, not last--university class directly concerned with literary theory, we were assigned chapters of Harvey's book for reading and discussion. The first few chapters hadn't impressed me, since Harvey was prone to making authoritative-sounding but awfully tendentious statements regarding, for instance, the "instability of capitalism":    [A specific kind of language] focuses our attention upon the complex interrelations, habits, political practices, and cultural forms that allow a highly dynamic, and consequently unstable, capitalist system to acquire sufficient semblance of order to function coherently at least for a certain period of time. (122)  Even Harvey's most factually bland, dutifully-qualified statements are colored by a doomy paranoia; the kind of rhetoric that implies (like Michael Moore's "documentaries") that in just a minute here these vague and disparate hints will snap together, like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, and show us a clear picture of our collective pooches getting screwed.  But Harvey's ruminations weren't as rubbishy as some of the other material we read, so I was inclined to give him a fairly long leash; that is, I honestly tried to follow his proposed sketch of the twentieth century (from Fordism to "the regime of flexible accumulation," for instance). I wouldn't have gotten mad if he hadn't tried to drag science into it.  He introduces his section on science with a nod to Frederic Jameson's attributing of "the postmodern shift" to a "crisis in our experience of space and time," and advises us that he means to challenge the notion that there actually exists some ultimate, objective arrow of time against which individual experience is mere perception. Graciously, he allows that    We recognize, of course, that our mental processes and perceptions can play tricks,  make seconds feel like light years , or pleasurable hours pass by so fast we hardly notice (202) [emphasis mine].  Not an auspicious start for a man who hopes to convince us that he's mastered the latest scientific insights. I grant him a pass, figuring his failure to notice that "light year = distance" might not be relevant to his argument. (It's an easy enough mistake to make, although any ten-year-old sf fan could have set him straight--and by the way, who edits these things?--and hey, doesn't he teach at a university with an astronomy department?)   I shall insist . . . that we recognize the multiplicity of the objective qualities which space and time can express, and the role of human practices in their construction. (203)  So, I wondered, does he mean that humans create the objective qualities--not subjective, mind you, but objective qualities--of space and time? If so, what created humans, who then "create" space-time? Can we step out of space-time? He can't mean that. Reading on:   Neither time nor space, the physicists now broadly propose, had existence (let alone meaning) before matter; the objective qualities of physical time-space cannot be understood, therefore, independently of the qualities of material processes. (203)  This earns a bemused "duh," and doesn't seem to advance Harvey's proposed challenge much. But then he says:   It is however, by no means necessary to subordinate all objective conceptions of time and space to this particular physical conception, since it, also, is a construct that rests upon a particular version of the constitution of matter and the origin of the universe. The history of the concepts of time, space, and time-space in physics has, in fact, been marked by strong epistemological breaks and reconstructions. (204)  At first Harvey seems to be saying simply that the final word on the objective nature of space-time has yet to be uttered. But then he makes this amazing non sequitur:   The Plains Indians or the African Nuer objectify qualities of time and space that are as separate from each other as they are distant from those ingrained within a capitalist mode of production. The objectivity of time and space is given in each case by the material practices of social reproduction, and to the degree that these latter vary geographically and historically, so we find that social time and social space are differentially constructed. Each distinctive mode of production or social formation will, in short, embody a distinctive bundle of time and space practices and concepts. (204)  Without quoting even lengthier passages from Harvey, I want to make clear what he's saying here: A society's perception (or construction, to use that annoying bit of jargon) of what constitutes the "objective" qualities of space-time is what determines the society's members' experiences of space-time. So when Einstein's general and special theories of relativity hit print, everyone (in Switzerland? in the US? in Los Alamos? on the planet?) began to experience space-time differently. And, despite Einstein, apparently, Indians and Africans and American capitalists experience space-time differently.  I sit here re-reading Harvey's chapter now with the Olympics blaring in the background, shaking my head at the slippery, obfuscatory foolishness he's promulgating. It is, with apologies to George Orwell, the kind of thing that's so ridiculous it could only be believed by an intellectual. Jim Thorpe, Mary Onyali-Omagbemi, and Billy Mills shared a pretty similar understanding of space-time: they knew what it meant to run across a distance quickly.  After these first four pages, the rest of the chapter trickles downhill. Thankfully, Harvey doesn't revisit anything like real "science" after his silly bumbling of it in the opening, but instead ponders Heidegger, Sartre, Foucault--and tries, like so many others before him, to clean up Heidegger's infatuation with Nazism. Oh, and he gins up a scientistic chart and a spiffy diagram purporting to illustrate a metaphysical view of "daily time-space paths according to Haegerstrand." (212)  I visited the professor's office after the rather confused class discussion to talk about the text, to ask if I had misunderstood it, and to find out what his own take on Harvey was. Soon he was explaining to me that indeed, children in different cultures learn different geometries of space, and that "psychological experiments" have proved it; that anthropologists have "demonstrated" that for some people, when an object moves behind a tree, the portion no longer visible is actually gone; and that when I object to Harvey's misunderstanding of what a light year is, I am in fact merely objecting to his rhetorical style. With that I was dismissed.

      I’m a forty-year-old dilettante, most recently pursuing and then abandoning an advanced degree in English literature. My scattershot resume—and, no doubt, my lack of interviewing skill—has made finding employment a little rough sometimes, except through temp agencies, which is how I’ve supported myself most of my adult years. For the last few months I’ve been working as an obscure type of bookkeeper at an obscure type of insurance agency in Springfield, Oregon, and, to my surprise, I’m happy there.  To keep my fingers in the literary pie, and not incidentally to make some money, I sell books online. You can find my store under "Book Links" in the sidebar (I'm "ungeheuer books"). I started selling books haphazardly, in a hobbyish, even uncredentialed sort of way, but I've grown passionate about it, to the point of dropping more than a thousand dollars in the last few months on reference works and seminars. This isn't my first adventure in running a business: For four years I owned a marginally profitable retail store catering to the neopagan community in the San Francisco Bay Area, and I've been a freelance writer now and again.  In fact, I used to justify my meandering lifestyle by calling myself a writer, sometimes an artist; and until recently, I’ve thought of myself as an uncredentialed member of that self-regarding, always-in-decline group, the intellectuals. After my recent tour of duty in academe I still don’t have any credentials, but now I’m pissed off at “intellectuals,” with an especially concentrated venom reserved for academics in the humanities. These are the people I used to admire as guardians of western civilization, even when they were being rightly critical of its excesses and failures. Instead, it turns out they’re civilization’s looters and smashers. It’s been four months since I left graduate school—I walked out after two terms—and my shock at the intellectual bankruptcy of modern humanities scholarship has not faded. I don’t know exactly where this blog is going, but my anger is where it begins.
