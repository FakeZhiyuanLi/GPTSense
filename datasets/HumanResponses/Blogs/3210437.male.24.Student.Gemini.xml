      For the last few months I have spent every morning with “Frank,” an Alzheimer’s patient.  Frank is 80 years old and was never married.  He loves God, golf, and women…but probably not in that order!  Every day, I go to his assisted living facility, pick him up, and take him to the golf course.  Before I met Frank, I had never even been to a golf course, much less ever played.  However, thanks to Frank I am now a not-too-horrible novice who is too cheap to ever make this a habit!  Frank is an item for discussion because of what he is teaching me about being a living, breathing, remembering, human being.  Since this website is dedicated to exploring theological thought, I decided it would be good for my first real entry to pause and be thankful for the mind each of us have.  I didn’t know Frank’s medical diagnosis when I first started working with him.  However, I began very quickly to suspect Alzheimer’s.  The true defining moment in my work with him came when I took him to see his specialist.  (Since Frank was never married, his only surviving family is his sister who lives three hours away…therefore, I took care of taking him to doctors, and I would then report to his sister about what the doctors said.)  As we were sitting with the doctor, I hoped that the doctor understood how much memory problems Frank had been having.  I worried because Frank was saying things like, “Everybody forgets things now and then.  Its just part of being old.”  I was worried the doctor didn’t even know that Frank had a problem.  But, I was wrong.  The doctor, whose professionalism I can’t even begin to recreate here, proceeded to remind Frank what he actually already knew…that he had Early-Middle Stage Alzheimer’s.  The doctor then proceeded to explain the treatment options available.  After he finished, Frank said, “Well it doesn’t really matter because I’m not going to be around much longer anyway…I’m pretty old.”  The doctor then said that we all need to make the best of whatever time we have left, and then he asked, “Frank, you said you’re old…how old are you?”  Frank stumbled for several seconds and then said, “You know I have a hard time remembering…let’s see I was born in 1923…”  “That’s right,” the doctor said encouragingly, “so how old does that make you?”  There was a long pause, and the doctor finally broke in and said, “What year is it, Frank?”  Frank responded, “You know, I have a hard time remembering that.  I’m just not quite sure how old I am.”  “Well,” said the doctor, “how old do you think you are?  Just guess.”  “Umm, I think I’m about 67,” Frank said incorrectly.  At that point, sitting across the room from Frank, I fought back tears.  Frank’s loss of memory was robbing him of self-identity.  I realized afresh the fragility of this life, and even more, the fragility of the mind.  I am a bit of an intellectual.  I enjoy thinking, rationalizing, problem solving, and learning.  This is a gift.  Often, we let our ability to think be an instrument of division.  We theorize reasons why this person or that person is not correct like we think we are.  Or, we drum up a platform that is superior to others’ ideas about what is best for our church, country, or whatever.  What’s even worse, I do this as badly as the next gal.  :)  I grew up being taught how to do this by my church, my school, my society, my political party, by everyone.  Frank taught me something that day.  He taught me to cherish every moment and every thought and every memory.  Our ability to think should not primarily be used as a weapon, but rather it should be used as a way to bless the lives of others.  There are no guarantees in this life (except death and taxes, I know), and we must remember to savor our days, our friends, even our enemies, and know that each thought is a gift.  Hopefully, my theological meandering on this site will never lose sight of this lesson.

      Just a short post to kick this thing off...keep watching for amusing and occasionally profound (??) thoughts on gay marriage, abortion, sex, Jesus, and anything else that tickles my fancy.  Oooohh...take your hand off me...that is not my fancy!  :)

      That's right.  I heard from Vanderbilt today.  Though they made a very generous offer, Jason and I have decided that Brite Divinity is going to be the best place for me to finish my Masters in Theology.  So, I called today and accepted their full tuition scholarship award!  I am overwhelmingly happy to know where I will be finishing this degree.  With this new future, I can completely put the ACU issues behind me and move on!  Thank you all again for all your prayers about this.  ...And since Brite is a Disciples of Christ school...go DISCIPLES!  :)

      I feel that the best place to begin our journey in understanding my theology of sexuality is the very beginning.  We must know where we began in order to understand where we have come.  So, in my beginning...   THE FAMILY   I was blessed by God even in my very first moments because I was born into one of the most wonderful families.  My father and mother were very loving and excited about me, their first and only son.  Though I have always been, and continue to be, closer to my mother, I do not fit the stereotype of having a distant father.  In fact, if anything, my father and I were too similar.  We were so much alike that it caused frustration.  Regardless, I cannot think of a single basketball practice, much less a basketball game, that my father didn't come and watch.  He was always there and always loving.  In my opinion the most damaging thing the stereotype of "homosexuality being the father's fault" has been the destruction it has caused in my father.  Despite my continued reassurance of his innocence, he continues to blame himself.  It is one of the two nearly insurmountable problems my father has with coming to terms with my sexuality.  As I already said, my mother and I have always been close.  I don't find a problem here.  My sister and my father are closer than my mother and my sister.  I think it is primarily a personality issue.  My mother and I have more in common; we view the world in a more similar way.  Even as a child I can remember talking with my parents about school or church and finding myself thinking more in line with my mother than my father.  So, for better or worse, I feel a strong connection to both parents, but a stronger connection to my mother.  Jennifer, my seven year elder sister, was very excited about the new baby when she learned I was to be born.  She didn't see me as competition; instead, she saw me as a toy.  She loved to take me off to her room and set me up in a high chair and pretend she was my mother.  And, as I got older, she began to take me to her room and "play school" with me...her as the teacher and I as her student.  We never fought too much, and I attribute it to the fact that we were so far apart in age that there was very little ground upon which we could argue.  I looked up to her.  She was my big sister, and despite challenges, we still love one another deeply.   THE STAGE   I grew up in Clinton, Tennessee, a small town outside of Knoxville, and my family faithfully attended one of the local Churches of Christ in neighboring town Oak Ridge.  This small town and my very conservative upbringing made many of the challenges I would face in my life more difficult.  Being gay in Clinton wasn't a popular thing (and still isn't).  Of course, I wasn't the only gay person in town, but no one really knew we existed.  Years later my mother would compare the situation to the albino African Americans years ago who used to live as African Americans in one town but then leave and go to work as white men in another town.  These men could work as white men in these distant towns where their families were not known.  We, like the men working as Caucasians, are a silent minority.  There is no visible outward sign (unless a person is a "flamer"...who makes their sexuality apparent).    If you passed me on the street, most of you would not have any idea that I am a gay man.  And I know that is true because it happens every day.  How many gay people did you pass today?  One?  Two?  Ten?  Who knows?  I don't even know.  I can't know how many people I pass that are gay because the homophobia that runs so rampant in our society causes self disclosure to be a rare thing (and gay-dar can only do so much!).  What I do know...I live in Abilene, TX...there are three conservative Christian Universities in this town.  There are more Baptist churches and Churches of Christ than I can count.  There are LOTS of old people...this is a retirement town.  This is a conservative Mecca.  AND, in the midst of all of this, there is Exodus MCC.  This little church that is open to gays and lesbians has reached 125 members on a good Sunday morning.  More than that, there are hundreds of other gays and lesbians at the one gay bar in town.  We are everywhere.  You may not know us...or more likely you may not know you know us.  But, you do.  We are your friends, your family, and your co-workers.  The most important thing I am trying to say: we are just like you.  What I wanted to show in my "beginnings" was how "normal" I am.  My family is not so different from yours.  In fact, I was luckier than many of my childhood friend to grow up in a family free of divorce.  I hope that you will continue on this journey in time with me.  Now we know the beginning...next will be the dreaded...ADOLESCENCE!!  :)

      Though I have little time today, I did not want to let such a historic day as this go without a word on my blog.  I am happy to say that on this day, gay marriages became legal in our country (if only in Massachusetts) for the first time.  I wish to share a portion of an article from the New York Times (Thanks to my man Jason who sent it to me!).  Andrew Sullivan wrote:   WASHINGTON - Today is the day that gay citizens in this country cross a milestone of equality. Gay couples will be married in Massachusetts - their love and commitment and responsibility fully cherished for the first time by the society they belong to. It is also, amazingly enough, the day of the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court ruling that ended racial segregation in schools across America. We should be wary of facile comparisons. The long march of African-Americans to civil equality was and is deeply different from the experience and legacy of gay Americans. But in one respect, the date is fitting, for both Brown and this new day revolve around a single, simple and yet deeply elusive idea: integration.    It is, first, a human integration. Marriage, after all, is perhaps the chief mechanism for integrating new families into old ones. The ceremony is a unifying ritual, one in which peers and grandparents meet, best friends and distant relatives chatter. It's hard for heterosexuals to imagine being denied this moment. It is, after all, regarded in our civil religion as the "happiest day of your life." And that is why the denial of such a moment to gay family members is so jarring and cruel. It rends people from their own families; it builds an invisible but unscalable wall between them and the people they love and need. (For the full article,  urlLink click here )   I find that this day is the most appropriate day one could have ever envisioned for such a monumental breakthrough as this is.  I am deeply touched personally, as this marks one more step in the advancement of rights for Jason and I.  Also, if you are interested in why marriage is so important to gays and lesbians, visit the Human Rights Campaign's  urlLink Marriage website .  They have some helpful information.  I have also written about this topic on  urlLink 2nd-Storey Window's  marriage discussion under the title "The Ousted One."    The Human Rights Campaign, a non-profit group supporting the rights of gays and lesbians, has a petition seeking a  urlLink "Million for Marriage."   If you have not signed that petition and support the rights of gay and lesbian people like myself and my partner, please click the link and sign that now!  THANKS!  Finally, on a personal note...I received an acceptance letter to Vanderbilt Divinity School today, and I will find out about a scholarship award from them in the next few days.  Keep praying!  I'll report more when I find out!  Lastly, I am almost ready to begin writing my life story, tracing the significant events that have led me to my current theological conclusions concerning sexuality.  Sorry for the delay...working 40 hours a week sucks!  Get me back in school!! :)

      Just pointing out the new links I have added.  First, I added the main denomination's website for the  urlLink Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches .  This church was started by Troy Perry in 1960.  Since that time, it has been one of the fastest growing denominations.  It is a predominately GLBT (gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgendered) church, though we are open and accepting of anyone.  It is my dream that we will one day lose the "gay church" label and simply become the church that will love anybody.  That is the way I personally view our churches (though of course each individual congregation has its problems).    I also added my home church's website--the  urlLink Exodus MCC , here in Abilene, TX.  Though it probably goes without saying, we are not associated with Exodus International in any way.  In fact, Exodus MCC predates Exodus International.  Our church has been growing at an amazing rate over the last 12 months or so...our membership has doubled during that time.  Further, because of all this growth, we are about to complete a building addition that will almost double the room in our sanctuary!  This is a very exciting time at Exodus!  If you are ever close by, join us...our services are at 11:00am and 7:00pm on Sundays and 7:30pm on Wednesdays.  ALL are welcome!  Finally, I have added another blogger with whom I have several things in common.   urlLink Heretic's Corner  is a blog run by a lesbian seminarian.  Her thoughts are very insightful, and she is an accomplished writer.  (Note: I only hope you don't find her so interesting that you stop reading me!  Remember we should all read our gay seminarian's site, too!)  If you have never visited her site, go give it a read...you won't be disappointed.  Coming soon on this site...I have decided that I think it would be good to trace briefly my journey from small-town conservative Church of Christ good boy to the gay evangelical good boy who wants to live in a big town!  I know that many of you who read this site are pondering gay/Christian questions.  I hope by telling the significant points in my journey, you can come to draw your own conclusions about faith and sexuality.  I have obviously drawn my conclusions already.  (For those who don't know I had a ceremony of Holy Union to my partner, Jason, on January 3rd this year.)  Well, that's it for now...till next time...good day and good theology!

      Just a note on the breaking news in my life.  This week I received a letter from Brite Divinity School in Fort Worth.  In the letter was notice of my acceptance and my scholarship award.  I was given a FULL TUITION award!  I wept when I opened the letter because I never expected such a large award.  I am currently waiting on my letter from Vanderbilt University in Nashville.  After getting their offer, Jason and I will make our decision about where we will be living and going to school.  Keep watch for more news!  Also, Jason received a promotion at his job that will hopefully go through in the next week or so.  Though we don't know how much more money this will be, it is a very good move for him in the company.  God has certainly rained down his blesssings on us this week!  I want to say thank you to each one of you who have prayed about these things for us.  After I was asked to withdraw from Abilene Christian University because I was gay, we were worried about what our future would hold.  However, with these wonderful blessings, I will be able to attend school for less money than I paid to attend at ACU, and Jason and I will be financially secure!  Thank you again for your prayers!

      As some of you may know, I am currently teaching a Survey of the Bible at Exodus Metropolitan Community Church here in Abilene, TX.  This class has been challenging and beneficial both to the church and to me as I have put the lessons together.  This week we continued our look at the gospels by looking at Mark's Gospel.    This gospel has long held a special place in my heart.  I love Mark's presentation of the life of Jesus.  I chose to focus our discussion last night on the Mystery in Mark.  Who is this man Jesus?  Do YOU believe He is the Messiah?  Will YOU follow Him?  This is what I love about Mark.  His gospel is SO evangelistic...he pointedly writes, asking, "Will you believe?"  And the best part of Mark...no one in the entire gospel gets who Jesus is until the end of the gospel.  Mark's gospel is the only gospel that shows everyone, including the disciples, to be completely oblivious to who Jesus truly is.  The only person to confess Jesus as the Son of God is the Roman Centurion standing at the foot of the cross in chapter 15!  Of course, this does make sense when we remember that Mark is writing to a Roman Gentile audience.  By having the centurion be the only one to confess Jesus, Mark is making a strong connection to his audience.  It is as if he is saying...see, this guy gets it, do you?  I think the reason I love this gospel so much is because it puts the modern Chrisitan in the right place.  It helps us remember that the ones who "get it" in our time may not be the leaders in our local Baptist, Methodist, or Church of Christ churches.  The ones who "get it" may be the local prostitutes (who may know, very personally, more leaders than we will ever know); or, maybe it is the men down at the local gay bar; or, maybe it is the homeless person standing on the corner selling today's paper.  I hope that we can all read Mark's gospel and allow ourselves to forget the ending.  Read it without thinking...I know who this Jesus is.  Instead, read it like Mark writes it...full of questions.  If we read Mark this way, the final chapters are blow-you-away powerful, and I believe they will cause us all to question if we truly believe in this man, Jesus.  God bless.

      To the few but faithful who continue to check this site when I have not updated in like a month...thank you.  Jason and I have been EXTREMELY busy lately.  We are currently trying to buy a home, and we have had two houses sold out from under us.  We have a bid in on a third house now and hope to hear back about it sometime tomorrow.  Pray that this one works out!  On top of the house buying, I have also been working overtime at work and teaching and preaching at church.  With all of this put together, I have had NO time, and I am not even going to mention how dirty our home is since we haven't had time to clean, mow, etc!!  Anyway, I'm going to try to get back to writing regularly as things hopefully slow up a bit.  I am also adding a link today that I was referred to by Dave Cargal, a guy from my church and work.  It is a pretty cool site, I have spent a bit of time reading on it today myself.  I hope you find it enjoyable.  It is an online journal called  urlLink Whosoever .  Well, gotta get back to the grind. *Final subliminal message* GO SEE FAHRENHEIT 9/11

      This is the second installment in the series I am writing about my own personal journey.  The first was titled "In My Beginning" and can be read on this site.  ADOLESCENCE!!!!!!!!!!  Now that you know a little about my family and the town I grew up in, we turn to my development.  I was something of a quiet kid.  I was never terribly popular in Middle School or High School, but Middle School was my real low point.  I simply didn't understand myself.  It was during my seventh and eighth grade years that I began realizing that my fantasies were about other boys, not girls.  It is odd, as I reflect on those times.  I was so confused.  I didn't know why I liked to fantasize about boys, I just did.  And, I was filled with guilt over it.  I suppose the one word that described me during that time was shame.  Though I very rarely acted out in any way during that time in my life, I was filled with shame.  Middle School was my low point because it was my most confused time and because it was my most sad time.  I cried a lot back then because I didn't understand me.  (Little did I know that some of that was simply the normal process of adolescence.)  Oddly enough, I can remember the exact moment I first realized I was gay.  It was the summer between seventh and eighth grade.  I had gone to spend the night at one of my friend's houses.  That night we joked around and flirted before going to bed.  Once we were in bed my friend made a pass at me and touched me sexually.  I was scared.  Nothing more happened, but I was furious about it the next morning.  I was furious and full of shame.  BUT, later that afternoon, I started flirting with my friend and realized that I wanted him to touch me again.  That was the moment I knew something was different about me.  It was at this point that my closeted life began.  I began trying to repress my attractions as best I could.  It wasn't that I simply didn't want to be gay.  It was that I knew I would go to hell for it.  That is what I had been taught.  So, I lived in fear of hell and full of shame.  ...I was a delightful Christian though.  I was funny and I laughed a lot...  But all of that was a cover.  It was what I did to hide my true identity from those around me.  "Luckily," my friend moved to a new school for eighth grade, so my secret was safe for now.  I told no one.  It was a battle I fought alone in the darkness.  I was dreadfully alone.  It seemed as if no one else in the world had the same problem.  Oddly enough, of the four guys that made up my closest friends during that time...all of them are gay today...but none of us ever spoke of it back then.  Where were blind to the fact that we were all walking the same hard road, never realizing we could have helped one another along.  This is why we the silence must end.  There must be discussion.  So that others don't have to walk alone.  Next time I will pick up with HIGH SCHOOL.

      The news is in!  Our recent offer on a home was accepted yesterday!  We hope to be in the home by August 1.  It is a beautiful 1930's home with 10 foot ceilings throughout.  It is full of charm and PERFECT for two gay guys to decorate!!  I'll keep you up to date on the progress with closing.  (Also, the reason for the title of this blog is the house being in the 100 year flood plane.  In Abilene, about half the town is marked as flood zone because of the possibility of the 100 year flood.  This is a massive flood that has never, to my knowledge, actually occurred but supposedly could occur.  Therefore, we get to pay extra money to the insurance just in case it ever does!)  Anyway...I'll try to get to posting another installment in my life journey series soon.  Finally for fun...I have come upon an eternal question:  You are in a public restroom... You are male... You are at the urinal... There is a penny in the bottom of the water... The penny is heads up... It is a lucky penny... To see it and walk away would be bad luck for years... You have already used the restroom... Is the penny still lucky?... Can you safely walk away... Lets just say that I personally hope so.  :)
