       If you're just now joining us, I'm going under the knife tomorrow.  It's actually nowhere near as major as I'm making it out to be - I'm having my four impacted wisdom teeth extracted.  My nerves were calmed about it when I had my consultation and learned about all the measures they take to make patients feel comfortable: Valium the day before and morning of the procedure, a cold spray before the IV, 'Twilight' sedation, local anesthesia, and of course, a lot of great drugs once I'm done.  My co-workers have encouraged me to post on the blog tomorrow when I'm at the height of drugginess.  We'll see.  My Oma (grandma to non-Germans) is taking me to the appointment, and Wayne has kindly volunteered to be my nurse while I recover.    I know that I'm trying to diet, but I won't be able to eat solid foods for a while.  Therefore, this afternoon's dinner (before class, so it was early) I had the super-carb feast from La Madeline.  I helped myself to creme brulee and a french dip, and didn't feel the least bit guilty.      I even got a phone call from the receptionist at the oral surgeon's office this morning to confirm, and I found out that I only owe $387, when I had expected to pay $1600.  They're trying to push it through dental insurance instead of the high-deductible medical that I have.    Overall, I feel comfortable going into tomorrow's surgery.  One of my colleagues today made sure to remind me of the dangers I could face, including a blood clot reaching my brain and the possibility of chipping my palate bone.  Just what I need.   Keep me in your thoughts and prayers.  I hope to be back here to post.

       As a blogger on  urlLink Blogger , I was offered the chance to participate in Google's test of their new free mail service,  urlLink Gmail .  I have to say, it's really cool.  The pages come up almost instantly, the interface is a whole lot friendlier than Yahoo, and it has up to 1,000 MB of storage.  That's right, 1,000!  I believe that Yahoo and MSN currently offer about 4.    I'll start using this more often so that I can do my job as a beta tester and test it out.  Feel free to  urlLink send me Gmail .

       Since there were only two responses to the last poll, I'm not guessing they're very popular.  Polls are gone for a while.  I have replaced them with a much cooler freebie tool called GuestMap.  Click on the "Place your pin" icon on the right and mark off the map with where you're reading from.  I had a visitor from Iceland today.  Wahoo!

       The guy who became famous for having a horrific American Idol performance now has his own record deals, fan clubs, and of course,  urlLink web site .  Overnight, he went from being a Civil Engineering student at Berkeley to a millionaire and trivia question.  Whether he finishes his degree is irrelevant.  Why couldn't I just once be rewarded this richly for failure?   Not to get deep, but perhaps the lesson is not that he failed, but that he stepped out of his comfort zone and tried something that he really wanted to do.  He may have entirely expected people to recognize his unique "talent."  Or, perhaps, our society loves to get a laugh at someone else's expense.

       I have posted before on the importance of handwashing and cleanliness upon leaving the restroom.  Today I think I witnessed an even worse combination of sanitation sins.  As I walked in today, another lady emerged from the stall in the middle of a phone conversation.  She then hung out by the sink for a minute or two and talked, then exited without even a courtesy hand-wrinse.    Do I need to enumerate what's all wrong with this?   1.  Always wash your hands! 2.  Why linger by the sink if you're not going to use it?   3.  If anyone ever calls me from the restroom, it had better be an emergency.

       On the way in to school today, I was approached by a guy who asked me to sign a petition to get an independent candidate on the 2004 ballot.  The candidate?  Ralph Nader.    I almost said "Nader?  Are you kidding?"  But a thought hit me - the more Democrats who vote for Nader, the less who vote for Kerry.  Even though it doesn't make a difference in our state (it will go to Bush no matter what), I signed up as fast as he would let me.

       I'm on a diet - again.  Not an extremely strict one, but my goal has been to lose twenty pounds from the time I started a week ago.  Hopefully, ten of them will be before my anniversary trip with Wayne to the San Francisco bay area.    In order to keep me on track, I am using the  urlLink Slim-Fast  program as a guide, though I typically eat one of their convenience meals and two other healthful meals during the day.  I like it because it's convenient and easy, but I have recieved criticism.  Yes, I'm also exercising, and yes, I know that just cutting calories isn't the answer.  Trying to eat balanced meals and exercise more is my goal, and I lost about 13 pounds before using this same method.  I can't go without a little bread and pasta, so the low-carb thing is out of the question.       One week in, I'm down 3 pounds.

       As described  urlLink below , I was challenged to see either  urlLink Pulp Fiction  or  urlLink The Breakfast Club  this weekend.  I did both, and my notes are here.    Pulp Fiction (1994)  I was not initially excited about seeing this, expecting blood and guts.  It turned out to be my favorite of the two.  There are a lot of very strange things that I didn't expect to laugh at, like when they accidentally shot the kid in the car.  My colleagues were right about it being a comedy with dramatic elements.  I realized that since I've never been shot, stabbed with a sword, overdosed on - or even taken - drugs, or been held up in a restaurant, I don't really have problems.  It wasn't incredible, but not a total waste of time either.     The Breakfast Club (1985)   I would have been entertained by this movie once upon a time, perhaps when I (like the characters) was in high school.  It's about five whiny kids who are all from different cliques but find something in common in each other all through the course of one day in detention.  The absolute worst plot twist was when all but one of them paired off in the most unlikely of couples.  An hour before, they had hated each other!  Give me a break.  I liked it better when the snobby one said that they'd never talk again after that day.  I'd like my two hours back, please.

       If you also read  urlLink Kelly's blog , he beat me to the punch on this story.  I will, however, recount it anyway.   An email was distributed this week from the Public Affairs officer at our workplace.  The subject line was "Free Ice Cream" and it called for all employees and contractors to come to a certain conference room and recieve free ice cream in exchange for a phone call or letter to their Congressional representative about an issue they are trying to push into legislation.  I can think of several things that are wrong with this.    First, I feel patronized with the ice cream offer.  Do they really think they have to bribe people in that way, or that it will work on anyone?  Second, the workplace is not the right environment for politics.  If they regularly read my blog they'd know this.       When it comes from an official company representative, it's coercion.  If someone at our office were so inclined and sufficiently offended, a decent lawsuit could be made of this.  I'm not going to bother.  Third, I understand exactly why this proposed legislation is in the company's best interest, but it's entirely possible that it's not in every contractor and employee's best interest.  There are people who work for the company who make a great deal more than I can imagine to live and work in Washington and lobby Congress all day long.  I'm not one of them.  This whole thing was in bad taste.      I was entertained that they didn't seem to get the response they had hoped for.  After the "campaign" was over, the PA lady came around with a cooler giving out free ice cream.  I declined, saying that I was on a diet, but twenty minutes later a fudge bar landed on my desk anyway.  I forgot about the diet and grudgingly ate their fudge bar.  It was good.

       Well, a friend of mine (you know who you are) has outdone herself.  In order to celebrate a friend's graduation from Mortuary school, she is throwing a "combination Mortuary School Graduation and [Adult] Toy Party."  I just got the  urlLink Evite  for it earlier today.    There are several things that amuse me about this.  First of all, it's open to everyone, so there are actually a lot of guys going.  One response, by a guy who I won't name, says asks if he can bring his other two guy friends.  Hmmm...   Another is the response by the graduate's mom.  She will unfortunately not be able to make it into town for the party.  I can safely say that if a party of this type were ever thrown in my honor and my mom *was* able to attend, I would be the first mortuary customer.    Unfortunately, I probably can't attend.  In addition to my surgery about 48 hours before the event, I am also invited to a longtime friend's birthday party and a going-away party for another.  Kelly, I'm counting on you to exercise that famous picture-documentation ability as much as they will allow you.

       I did a Google search on "Fun Lunch Bunch" remembering how my friend used to tease that I was a part of one at work.   urlLink This page  was one of the first searches returned.  The caption says that their Sunday Afternoon Lunch Bunch met at Pizza Hut and was given slabs of paper and four Crayons.  The parachuting cows and ketchup explosions are the results of what they came up with, and they're now published on the internet.   Wayne and I can personally relate to this one.  We often dine at the Macaroni Grill near his house, where the server writes his/her name in Crayon on butcher paper on the table and leaves the rest for us to play with.  We have drawn pictures of ourselves on our bikes, trees, clouds, the usual.  Once we drew an amusing picture of the guys at the table next to us.  I guess that seeing these published on the net is proof that we're not the only ones who haven't grown up yet.

       The guys I went to lunch with yesterday were astounded to learn that I had never seen Breakfast Club.  This is in addition to our discussion the previous week about not having seen Pulp Fiction.  Apparently, I will be a step behind everyone else by not having seen them, as I will miss every joke reference made to these movies.  What a terrible fate.    Rob gave me a homework assignment to see one or both of these movies over the weekend and to report back to the lunch group.  I may actually do it.

       This is relevant to the dinner party, but worthy of its own post.  The hosts of the dinner party had gone through many different kinds of pets.  One in particular was the Slow Loris.  They are small, slow-moving primates, and very cute.  One of the party guests later sent out a  urlLink fact sheet  she had found on the internet about the animals.  Wayne forwarded it to me.  I promised to stop asking for a puppy if he would get me one, paying no regard to the poisonous spit or the toxins in their forearms.    I have had interest in various other exotic pets before.  For a while I wanted a  urlLink Sugar Glider , but I was easily talked out of it when I read about how high-maintenance they are.   urlLink Fennec Foxes  also seemed cute, and many people keep them just like they would a small dog, but when I found that some of them do not house train very well, I gave up on that one, too.    I think what it really comes down to is not that I want to own any of these animals; I just want to play with them for a while and give them back to their owners, sort of like kids.  Maybe what I really need is just a trip to the Houston Zoo.

       On Thursday (this is the reason I didn't post) we went to a dinner party at the home of one of Wayne's co-workers.  He and his wife are empty-nesters with thousands of interesting stories to tell and a ton of unusual things to show in their house.  They had a beautifully renovated kitchen and a metal shop outside.  I took particular interest in a harpsichord that he had made by hand and on which his wife had done the detail painting.  I tried to sightread some music that they had, going back to my long-ago days of playing oboe and percussion in high school.  Not pretty.    After dinner, those who were left migrated to the den for parlor tricks designed to show us all how stupid we were.  They set nine magazines on a table, in a 3x3 arrangement.  One would go into the wetbar area (yet another home we've seen that has a wetbar) and close the door, while we all selected one magazine at random.  When we were finished, she came back in and tried to guess which magazine had been chosen.  Her husband would point a long stick at several magazines in no apparent order and ask "Is it this one?  How about this one?"  She got it right every time.  There were about a dozen times I thought I had it, but I was looking for the wrong pattern.  Instead of paying attention to which magazines were selected before the key one was picked, I should have been looking at where on their covers they were tapped.  It was funny to see a bunch of engineers and programmers getting whooped in this game.  We all were convinced that we "almost had the secret" when in reality we weren't even close.  No one wanted to believe that we couldn't solve the puzzle.  The one other person who did pick up on the secret admitted that he had played the game before.  Lesson learned.    This makes me more excited about hosting a wine tasting in a month or two.  I may put up a poll on this blog about that.

       Last night I laid down for a nap as soon as I got home, about 5:30.  I didn't wake up until almost 9:00 this morning.  That's about 15 hours.  I wonder if I should get an award for that.  There will be plenty more of it next week when I have my wisdom tooth surgery.  I had been pretty tired all day, but I thought my little nap wouldn't last but a few hours.   If you've ever seen Seabiscuit, Wayne says I'm like that horse.  There's a scene where they first show him, sleeping in a pasture.  The trainer talks about how all he does is sleep and eat, but he ends up being really fast out on the track.  I think Wayne's just being nice about the last part though; he's a much faster cyclist than me.

       Mother of two and pediatrician Claudia Jensen of California [the surprises keep coming] wants to prescribe marijuana to children with Attention deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder.  She  urlLink claims  that it's a lot better than going out and actually buying the expensive drugs when one can just go in the backyard and pick off a leaf to calm the nerves.  In addition to prescribing marijuana for her own patients, she is actually a first year professor to medical students at the University of Southern California.  I bet they're proud of the message the med students are getting.    This could he all for naught, though.  Dr. Jensen would probably be relieved to realize that a lot of the work has been done for her.  Teenagers with ADHD have been self-prescribing pot for years.

        Office Politics   In the last couple of months, my office has gotten increasingly political.  Maybe the truth is actually that it's always been this way and I'm just now starting to notice and be affected.  It's the quintessential  urlLink Dilbert  scenario.  We have the Wallys who show up at 10, leave at 3, and avoid work like the plague.  There are plenty of pointy haired bosses.  I had seven bosses (some pointy haired, some not) at last count.  There are Elbonians, but their homeland is somewhere in Alabama.  One of the Elbonians now works for us.  There is definitely a Carol the Secretary, though my old department was even more chock full of them.  My favorite Carol strip was the one in which the PHB was asked to cover her job for a while, so he offered to call her kids and yell at them for her.  There are a few Dilberts and a few generic characters as well.  If anyone can tell me that their office isn't run the same way, I'd be impressed and skeptical at the same time.    I guess I'm a little like Alice, but I am much nicer than she is in front of people.  I used to think I was more like the naive Asok the Intern, then I wisened up to the fact that we're not immune to office politics.    Politics at the Office  I have gotten some email messages from one co-worker who is keeping up heavily with the labor issue that President Bush is working on.  He has forwarded the emails to a bunch of people at work demanding activism, and every time they're from AFL-CIO left wing nutjobs who spin things so far to their side that they're misleading if not inaccurate.  The former-Elbonian and I discussed today how unfortunate it is that we can't find any news that isn't slanted.    People deal with this different ways.  I tend to balance out my mainstream leftie editori-news with  urlLink Fox  and some occasional discussions by Savage and Hannity on the radio.  On the reverse side, I still listen to NPR.  When I tried to get the Fox take on the labor issue, they had just copied the incredibly biased AP version.  I won't include a link here, because it's not relevant and because I can't find a side of it that reports fact instead of opinion.  I do realize that the conservatives I read are also biased, but I like to believe they're more right [er, correct] than their counterparts.

       I feel like talking about goofy stuff today, so bear with me.  I told a co-worker today that a nice place to live would be Australia.  I wonder if I should change my mind, seeing these two stories.  This  urlLink one  talks about woman who had colon surgery in Sydney and they left the scissors in!  It almost reads like an urban legend or a hoax, but at least they went through the trouble of doctoring up x-ray photos if that's the case.  Things like this are the reason I'm nervous about my wisdom tooth extraction next week.  Four teeth, all impacted = lots of room for error.    Australian leaders could also be in trouble, according to this Reuters  urlLink story .  It appears that the Prime Minister has a kangaroo bone pointed at him by an Aboriginal woman, a curse that could be as severe as death.  Imagine having to give a serious answer to the press about that one.  "Well, yes, I am very concerned about this bone pointing matter and will be sure to negotiate with these folks right away.  Just kidding - had you fooled!"  The user  urlLink comments  on the Yahoo site about pointing the bone are more hilarious than the story itself.

       I am entertained by how many things are constantly exposed to be bad for our health.  In recent times, popcorn butter fumes and french fries have taken the heat as carcinogens.  This new  urlLink article  from WebMD Health asserts that there are toxins in our cars that may cause adverse cardiovascular "events," presumably heart attacks.    The narrowly based study was performed on nine (why not ninety?) healthy state troopers who worked in their cars.  The funny part comes in when they described how officers may spend up to 35% of a shift away from their cars, among other activities, eating dinner.  Is no one examining the chicken fried steak and cigarettes they had when they stopped for grub?  I wonder if my boss will let me work from home because of these astounding new findings.  I'm betting not.

       Obviously, I couldn't spend all this time talking about the  urlLink MS 150  and then not give out the scoop on how it went.  This post could get long.  I would have written this earlier, but I had a busy day of sleeping in and doing absolutely nothing.    First of all, the ride was excellent.  It was the absolute best cycling experience that Wayne and I have had, which was most notably due to the great organization, gorgeous scenery, and the fun time that everyone had in LaGrange and Austin.  There were reported to be 12,800 riders there, and probably at least 3,000 volunteers.  They had thought of everything - plenty of porta cans (I can't stress how big a deal this is), oranges, bananas, and even brownies at one rest stop.  People came from out of everywhere in the small towns, too.  There was one truck that set up along the route both days with concert-quality broadcast speakers blasting rock music and a guy in his seventies dancing along.  In both LaGrange, Austin, and a lot of small towns along the way, people would line the streets to cheer for us.  It was very encouraging.    When we arrived, we saw that what everyone told us had been true.  The fairgrounds and the entire experience was gigantic, but it was still very well organized.  We expected to wait in line for things like showers and food, but it wasn't really too bad.  We got a chance to walk around and talk with people we knew, mostly co-workers who also had done the ride.  We found that our  urlLink sponsor  was a lot more generous than most others with beer and food, and it made us a popular team.  Team Saint Arnold, like most others, had masseurs waiting in the tents on both days, and we were happy to see them.    The riding itself was also nice.  There were enough hills to make it a challenge, but not enough that it was demoralizing.  We took our time on Saturday and ended up at LaGrange around 3:00; not a bad time, especially for a first year.  We felt great too, other than a little bit of dehydration that I experienced about three miles from the finish in LaGrange.  Some others filtered into the tent until 5 or 6ish, but a lot of factors could have contributed to someone's delay.  Sunday we did very well, arriving in Austin by 12:45.    We saw all kinds of people along the way.  One guy, sponsored by Al's Formal Wear, did the entire ride in a full tux, including matching black cycling shoes and a top hat over his helmet.  Several others had rubber ducks glued to the tops of their helmets, but I'm not sure of the significance.  There were some real "winners" on safety, like the guy who drafted two feet behind a huge dump truck to catch his wind resistance, but most people were pretty conscious.    Here's the disclaimer: of the different  urlLink route  variations, we took what some would consider to be the newbie route on both days.  The first day, we started from Rhodes Stadium in Katy, and on Sunday we skipped the traditional park route.  The park route goes through Bastrop State Park and consists of a ton of very steep hills and we felt fully validated in skipping it our first year.  It's a good thing, too, because it was a flat tire marathon going through there.  Some idiot had sprinkled tacks throughout the park sometime before the ride and it caused most people to have at least one flat.  One of our teammates had three.  It was obviously a deliberate act, and I can't figure out why someone would be so evil.  People could have gotten seriously hurt, and I wouldn't be surprised if somebody did.  That was the only blemish on an otherwise perfect weekend.          Another thing that was pretty inspiring is the number of people who have MS that volunteered for the ride.  One lady, who filled out my certificate of completion, was very nice.  Compared to the two days that we endure on the ride, living with MS is a constant struggle.  Although I didn't sign up to be a  urlLink Pedal Partner , I received a bandana with the email address of an MS survivor.  I will write to her soon and send some pictures of my ride.  Next year, my goal will be to do a lot more for the Society and try to be one of the top 300 fundraisers.  My only attempt at FAQs would be those I got from my parents:    Were we tired?   Heck yes, but we had a lot of energy built around being there and all of the festivities.  Almost as soon as we got on the bus back to Houston, we were out cold.    Does my butt hurt?   Absolutely.  Not as much as yesterday, though.   Will I do it again?   I sure do hope so.  Believe it or not, that's the condensed highlight version.  I may post more as I think of other things that happened.  If you also did the ride, I'd love to see comments about how it went for you.  (Jason, we couldn't find you in Austin at the SA tent!)

       As you can see on the right, I have also added a poll.  I had a guest book in here for all of about ten minutes, but it was too "busy."  If I ever post anything that flashes or dances around on this site, I encourage you to send me all kinds of hate mail reminding me what a terrible thing I have done.    The poll came from  urlLink Bravenet , which seems to be a good service offering lots of free web services.  Of course, they have to feed their families and pets so there are ads, but I don't mind them too much.

       It's the Germans, too - at least their cats.  CNN has a  urlLink story  about a cat who was brought to an animal shelter weighing in at about 41 lbs.  He was reportedly fed 4 lbs of food every day by his elderly human.  Most people probably don't eat that much!  The pleasantly plump kitty is now on a diet and living with one of the shelter employees.    I thought my cat was getting chunky, but this one takes the cake... and the pie, and the pork chops, and anything else it can get its paws on.  Sorry, I couldn't resist.

       Several people have talked about the necessity of posting comments back to the author on this blog - me.

        urlLink Kill Bill Volume 2  comes out this weekend, but I recommend that you don't waste your time or money seeing it.  Blood, guts, bad story line, and lack of plot made Volume 1 into two hours of my life I can never have back.    It goes something like this:  I wake up from a coma.  Here's a list of people I want to kill.  I go around looking for them and kill each one in a blood-spurting disgusting scene with less plot than a kung fu video game and terrible special effects.  They play an annoying jingle of some guy whistling in the background throughout the entire movie.  Tune in next time, when I go for the second half of the list.  The end.    No thanks!

       [Start soapbox]  I listened to the  urlLink President's speech  tonight on the radio.  The only part I got to hear was the last 30 minutes, but I was disappointed that every single reporter's question I heard had something to do with asking Bush if he had made mistakes, what they were, and whether he had anything to apologize for.  Hello?  Is that important enough to dominate a news conference?  Several alluded to the election that's still half a year away.  It's hard to believe that the media can be so blatantly political.  We take that freedom of political speech for granted so much; my Palestinian co-worker was telling me about how that wouldn't have happened in her country.  I wish it didn't happen in ours, though I agree wholeheartedly with maintaining the right to do so.   [End soapbox]

       Today is National Blame Someone Else Day.  In my  urlLink Toastmasters  group, this was the theme of the meeting, and the word of the day was Blamestorming - one of my sniglets from a few days ago.    In observance of National Blame Someone Else Day, I am pointedly blaming everyone in my household for moving my USB keychain drive from the computer.  Actually, I am determined that I didn't move it myself, so I believe the distribution of blame to be appropriate.  Looks like no one can ever say I don't observe holidays.   This reminds me - it's a big transition here, but follow me - of my boyfriend, Wayne, having his birthday fall on Martin Luther King day this year.  As a part of his employee development plan, he had committed to being more active about diversity.  He kept talking about taking his birthday off and taking it as a diversity day to get paid for it.  I told him that bad karma would come back to get him for something like that, but I had to admit it was pretty funny.

       Hopefully this will be the last post about Satchmo.  He would probably really embarrassed about all the attention.  That is, if he could read and wasn't a fish.   When I came home from work today, he was doing markedly better.  Last night, I found (quite easily, by the way) some message boards for Betta owners that is regularly moderated and has some fish experts.  No one has seemed to be able to diagnose what had been wrong with him yet, but I read several people talking about keeping their fish warm and keeping water movement to a minimum.  These are two things I had been doing wrong, so I turned off his filter and turned on the light to warm him up a little.  I actually got to sleep in my own bed tonight!    I know, this seems like a lot of trouble for a fish, right?  Well, it is - but if I'm actually able to kill a Betta, which are supposed to be resilient fish, then I'll never forgive myself.

       Satchmo is still swimming around in his tank, so he won't get flushed today.  I was happy to see that.  He looks a little better, with the emphasis on little.    We'll see how this turns out.  I have to find another place for him or I'll be sleeping on the couch again tonight, all on account of a fish.

       Last night I came home to find my two-year-old Betta fish, Satchmo, swimming (more like laying) on his sides in the tank.  Fearing that he was near death, I did everything I could to get him some more oxygen.  I 'fished' him out, cleaned the tank and filter thoroughly, and returned him to it leaving the filter on.  I hadn't had this running in quite some time and I remembered why - it's loud.  Every time I turned the filter off so that I could sleep, he would again start gasping for air on his sides.  I finally solved the problem by sleeping in another room on the couch where I couldn't hear the filter but was uncomfortable all night.  Something tells me he's going to make it.  He's gotten through all kinds of less than ideal conditions before with me as a fish-mom.  I really don't want to give him the flush, but something has got to happen with that filter.  I'll look for another spot in the house tonight - if he's still alive then.

       Some error in IE is causing it to crash unnecessarily several times per session and it's driving me nuts.  Clearly there is some kind of corruption in the file.  I know how much of a pain it is to find that stuff when you have the source code; it's got to be impossible when you don't.  I made the switch to the  urlLink Netscape  browser, and at the risk of sounding like one of those anti-Microsoft super geeks, I like it a lot better.   I still don't run Linux on my home machine, so that is my exemption card.

       On Friday, Wayne and I took advantage of our Good Friday off and drove along the  urlLink MS 150 route  to Austin.  It took us about three hours, as expected, with a lot of little stops in between.  There are definitely hills, but nothing like the ride we did in Bastrop that went so badly for me.  It was nice to get to see what we would be up against.  My biggest thought is that the route is absolutely gorgeous.  There are several sections with fields of bluebonnets and other wildflowers.  The cows and horses really come out to support the riders, even if it does just mean walking closer to the fence to see what's going on.  I am really looking forward to doing the ride.              We also go through several little small towns.  Just for good measure, we stopped and evaluated the restroom situation at many of them (drinking continuous Diet Cokes helped with ensure that we would do this).  Everyone was so friendly!  When we got to Austin, we saw the Capitol building where the ride finishes, and went on to a restaurant on Sixth Street called  the Iron Cactus.  Except for the chips, people in Austin seem to eat healthier than us fatties in Houston.  The meals were mostly offered with grilled veggies as sides, not beans and rice.     On the way home, I drove.  I missed the exit by about half an hour and wasted a huge chunk of time.  After I got us turned around, Wayne wanted to drive again by the time we got back to Bastrop.  I griped a little bit about it, but was happy to settle into my passenger role and listen to our  urlLink audio book .  By the time we got home, it was dark.    Overall, not a bad way to spend a day off, and we're going to do it again on bikes next weekend.  It's a good thing he and I like each other so well; I can think of a lot of people I'd want to strangle by the end of a trip like that.

       There is no doubt that by now, most people have seen the new  urlLink Quiznos  commercials featuring mysterious rodent-like creatures playing guitar and singing about the tastiness of the Quiznos sandwiches.  I don't know about everyone else, but I am hardly appetized.  I am, however, talking about it - and that's exactly the  urlLink brand recognition  they were going for.      In the ads, the animals sing about the tastiness, crunchiness, and warmth of the subs as pictures of sandwiches on a grill roll by.  Near the end they tell viewers about added features that set Quiznos apart from competitors, one of them being that "they got a pepper bar."  When I first saw the commercial, I was sickened by these nasty, ugly, repulsive creatures.  It's hard to tell what they are; some mix of rat, hamster, and bad human teeth, bug eyes, and hats.  The voices are equally horrific, but Wayne does a hilarious impression of them.          The creatures are called Spongmonkeys, and they were created in Britain by a  urlLink journalist  who originally created them to sing about the  urlLink moon , marmots, and cheese, among others.  I have to say, despite originally being turned off, the others on his web site are very amusing.  There are several more animations, like the one with kittens singing about a gay bar that is particularly funny.  This officially replaces  urlLink Badger Badger Badger  as the meme of the month.

       In an effort to gain more exposure, the liberals are now going after talk radio.  This is because they claim that the conservatives have captured the media.  ... except, or course, for CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, Hollywood, New York Times, AP...   Now, I would think that if you're going to try to compete with the likes of Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, and Sean Hannity, you'd send out your best and brightest stars, right?  Not exactly  urlLink the plan  for  urlLink Air America  radio.  Al Franken and Jeanine Garofolo are headlining this show.  Their web site touts that "The Right has had its say for the last three years."  It makes me want to cry for them; such a sad story.

       There is some restauranteur in New York who is trying to import the practice of cutting a live lobster down the middle and eating him as he dies, a process that takes about twenty minutes.  How sick is this?  I can't even stand to eat something that I knew was alive a few hours before (see Crawfish Boil post).    I like the  urlLink New York Press   urlLink idea  the best: take off the rubber bands and make it a fair fight.  If the man gets the claws off without losing one of his own, the lobster loses.  If the lobster gets in any shots, then he gets to die the humane way in a boiling pot of water.  This kind of stuff would make me want to be a vegetarian... if I didn't like meat so much.

       There is a person in my wing of the office building (not in our department, sorry CAE folks) who, in the dozens of times I have seen her in the ladies' room over the past two years, has never been caught in the act of washing her hands.  She hurriedly rushes in, does her thing, and then rushes out, not giving the sinks a second glance.    To put this in perspective, we work at a place that is so safety conscious that there are signs in every stall saying "Employees must wash hands before returing to work."  No, we're not at a restaurant, but someone recognized that this is important for all types of work, and put up the signs.  I may be extreme with restroom sanitation; I don't touch faucets or door handles without a paper towel in hand, etc.  I still don't think it's too much to ask for someone to wash up.   One of my co-workers tells a funny story about this same situation at his previous job.  He actually followed the guy out of the restroom and caught up with him around the corner.  "Can I ask you for a favor?," he asks.  "Sure," replies the guy, putting his filthy arm around my colleague.  "Would you mind washing your hands next time?"  The guy apparently seemed caught off guard and agreed to do so, but then turned around about ten steps later and said "No!  No I won't!"  What's the harm?  If anyone has any arguments against hand washing, I'd like to hear them, so email me and I'll post them here.         So, consider this post a public service announcement.  The Health Department should pay me for this.

       sniglet (sng'lt)  1. (n.) Any word that doesn't appear in the dictionary, but should.   For those who are just now tuning in, I'm a programmer, so here are some of my favorite sniglets from  urlLink WhatIs .  I won't list them all here because there are too many.    urlLink alpha geek  - the most knowledgeable, technically proficient person in an office or work group.    urlLink assmosis  - the process by which some people seem to absorb success and advancement by kissing up to the boss rather than working hard.     urlLink blamestorming  - sitting around in a group, discussing why a deadline was missed or a project failed, and who was responsible.    urlLink cube farm  - an office filled with cubicles.   urlLink oxoxomoron  - a person who includes symbolic "hugs and kisses" at the end of their e-mail.    urlLink stress puppy  - a co-worker who seems to thrive on being stressed out and whiney.

       We had an  urlLink MS 150 team  meeting at the  urlLink brewery  today.  Most of the time, this just includes drinking beer.  While there was some of that, it was really pretty motivating.  We talked with several folks [including Jason, Luann, Kevin, and Richard] who have done the ride before and have really great testimonials about it.  I'm genuinely psyched about the whole thing.  Apparently, there is actually a Saint Arnold person at the finish line in La Grange (the overnight stop) to direct Saint Arnold-ers to the team tent and they even give us a beer for the last half-mile of our journey to said tent.  Now THAT is why I joined a brewery team!       Once we do this, I am definitely going to have more posts here about it.  One of the things that I wish I'd had access to when first starting was some real advice for "Freddies," or Beginners.  Hopefully if this helps anyone, it is to give some real feedback to new riders about what to do and not do.   So, after rounding out our training this next two weeks and getting everything ready, we've got it all taken care of.  Of course, I still need to raise some money.

       This one is for Kelly, who also went to a crawfish boil on Saturday night.  He commented on feeling left out due to being the only one without a significant other and using his camera as a distraction.   Wayne and I were invited to a friend's crawfish boil, which always get a little wild and at which we have historically had a really good time.  We were, however, a little out of place this time, being the only non-Vietnamese people there (other than the hostess) out of about fifty people strewn all over the house and backyard.  We ended up sitting and watching Finding Nemo with the kids in the living room and realized how anti-social we were being.  The fun part was when we decided to mingle and the guys talked Wayne into taking several shots of Cognac with them.  Needless to say, I drove home.         I don't even like crawfish.  Some combination of the spices being too hot and seeing the little critters crawl around in a tub about an hour before they're on the table is un-appetizing to me.  Thank God they had great barbecue.

       It surprises me just how much of cycling is about mental endurance rather than anything else.  Wayne and I rode  urlLink 76.03 miles  yesterday.  To put things in perspective, that's pretty much from Katy to almost Hempstead and back.  It's a long way.  We noticed that at about the halfway point, we were physically fine (with the exception of my outdoor allergies) and our legs were strong.  It was just really easy to get bored on the last stretches.  We commented that keeping ourselves entertained and upbeat is probably a million times easier because we're training as a couple.    I know they say not to judge ourselves by anyone else's progress, and that as long as we gave our best we're doing fine, but I'm going to set aside that utopian idea that they tell the losers.  We got a huge second wind at the end that was fueled even further by leaving some folks standing still (who, if they weren't cycling veterans, had plenty of expensive gear to look the part).  It was a good feeling.  I would venture to say that the way I feel mentally in the last ten miles of almost any ride will play a huge part in how I feel after we stop and the next day.    Wayne's heart rate monitor said we burned about 2700 calories.  I'm sure we made up for that and more with our victory dinner at Macaroni Grill, complete with bread, an appetizer, meals, and dessert.  We were in bed by 8:00.             The ride was a charity event for the Mayde Creek High School " urlLink Ram Band ," and was one of the best supported rides that we've done.  If I had to give them two constructive points of criticism, I would vote for more porta-cans (four porta-cans divided by a couple thousand riders equals a 30-minute long line at each rest stop), and less of the roughly paved roads on the long route.  I do give them credit for finding as many smooth roads as they did out in the boonies, but as long as we're being picky...  But that's it - the band kids and parents were very helpful, plenty of SAG wagons, and the rest stops were well supported - not like I'm surprised, as I was also a band nerd at LCHS in my high school years.  We will do this ride again next year.

       Fox News  urlLink reported  yesterday about a Walt Disney World employee who molested a 13 year-old girl and her mother while dressed in a Tigger costume.  They were reportedly posing for a picture with the big animal when he felt up the girl with one hand and the mom with another.    "Tigger" faced charges and was booked on $2,500 bond at the Orange County Jail, but interestingly enough, did not lose his job!  I guess that would have been politically incorrect.  A company spokesperson for Disney did report that he is on suspension without pay.    How bizarre.

       I know, this tiny little blog is pretty plain.  In some ways, it always will be, but sooner or later I will spruce it up a little bit.  For now, I have just grabbed one of the Blogger templates and I'm satisfied with it.    Part of the minor changes I have made to the code is adding a contact link.  I have already taken heat over the grilled cheese comment (Anna, I did not mean to offend the grilled cheese enthusiasts), so the email address should provide people with some recourse to air their grievances or make suggestions.    I'm happy to report that a link to my blog has been added to my friend  urlLink Kelly 's links section on his.  Kelly has readers he's never met who tune in often enough to find out what he's thinking.  Go read it - his stuff if more interesting than mine - but don't forget to come back.

       I'm currently reading  urlLink Sean Hannity 's first book, "Let Freedom Ring."  Just finished with chapter one, and it's a good book so far.  Hannity doesn't waste any time before pulling some serious punches at the liberals.  Of course, if I had expected him to I probably wouldn't have bought the book.    Maybe I'll donate it to the  urlLink UHD library  when I'm done.  The closest thing they have, using a 'Hannity' keyword search, is an Al Franken book.  Most people there have no idea who either of these people are.  It'll probably never get read, but I can say I tried.

       My wonderful boyfriend (Wayne) and I are training for the  urlLink MS 150  this year.  This is a very worthwhile fundraising bike ride (Houston to Austin, ~180 miles), and the money we raise goes to end the devastating effects of MS.    Just about every Saturday or Sunday morning, instead of sleeping in, we are headed out to the nearest semi-suburban area to ride 50-60 miles and pay thirty bucks for what essentially amounts to SAG support and a t-shirt.  I won't lie and say I don't miss sleeping in, but we have so much fun out there.  You wouldn't believe how romantic it is to play "Guess That Roadkill."    Wayne's mom has agreed to send us $25 each.  That brings my grand fundraising total to... $25.  Here comes my shameless plug.  If you're a kindhearted enough soul to want to join me on this ride through your sponsorship, please check out my  urlLink donor page .  It could be the best money you spend all year.    Also, here's a link to the  urlLink web page  I made for the team I'm riding with, the Saint Arnold Brewery.

       I've been looking through the news online today and discovered that I'm in a mood where very little interests me.  The news from Iraq has started to blend together and gets depressing, so I don't read it.  I'm usually a bit entertained by the CNN section on  urlLink Offbeat News .   urlLink This story  talks about a unique twist on the Catholic confessionals that I haven't heard of before: an Apology Hotline.  It was started by a 20-year-old college sophomore who thought it could give people an outlet for their guilt.  People who call in to the hotline are directed to an answering machine where they can leave messages about things they're sorry for.    There is some disagreement over whether it's a healthy thing for people to express these sentiments anonymously to a hotline rather than addressing the person they should be apologizing to.  Some experts say that it may deter people who actually need to seek help somewhere else from doing so.  Others believe that it's a beneficial way for people to address their guilt and possibly feel more comfortable calling in to other centers, like suicide hotlines.    My best way of avoiding that is to live life in a way that I do little that I'd have to apologize for.  How well I succeed is up for debate.

       I typically don't take quizzes because I don't have any faith in a few canned questions to be able to read into my personality.  This one was no exception.  I took a  urlLink CNN quiz  to see "which vacation best suits [my] personality for 'finding hidden treasures'."  It ended up telling me that my ideal vacation is the Gilroy Garlic Festival.  Nice try, but nowhere close.   That said, I'm really looking forward to my vacation to Chicago this coming weekend.  I'll be there in 5 days and counting!

       It's very easy for me to say that the only notable health problem or injury I've ever experienced is just having teeth.  This year, they've been through a lot.  First, I got a root canal around December on a front tooth that had been broken in the fifth grade and needed a crown.  Then, of course, I started having unbearable pain that was traced back to my wisdom teeth trying to move in.  Sixteen hundred dollars later, I'm starting to wonder whether the wisdom teeth were ever a problem at all.    The pain is back, and it got so extreme on Tuesday that I had to leave work.  I literally got teary-eyed while telling my boss why I had to leave - it hurt that bad.  The tooth farthest to the back on the top left side has had a cavity since the last time I went in for a cleaning.  It's hard to reach and apparently, I don't really have much room for it.  The cavity and the tooth are now infected, despite my efforts to keep my teeth clean, and the dentist recommends its  urlLink removal .  He cites the massive cost of a root canal and crown which only  may  save the tooth, versus having it extracted to make more room in my mouth and be rid of the problem.  Since I found this out, I have been brushing after every meal (5-6 times a day) in addition to the requisite morning and evening, plus flossing at work.  I don't know if teeth could be any cleaner.  I've been told that weak teeth run in my family - great.   I have feelings of fear and relief about getting this tooth removed.  Fear, because I understand that an infected tooth cannot be deadened and it's incredibly painful to have it removed.  The procedure is done only under local anesthesia, so I'll be fully aware of any pain I'm feeling.  I am on antibiotics to cure the infection, but I wonder if it could come back before June 16th.  If not, there should be no problem.  Relief, because it's supposed to be a hundred times simpler than my wisdom tooth surgery and I'll finally be rid of the pain that's bugged me for nearly six months.    There will no doubt be more updates on this.

       I have now inspired two people to create a blog.  In addition to John and his  urlLink travel blog , my friend Angie has decided to create  urlLink a blog  for the Thirtysomething dating crowd.  Her plan is that people can share dating stories, the good, bad, and the ugly, on the site.  One person actually already posted something that seems to be exactly what she's looking for - a warning about a personals service.    I've been asked to do some of the webmaster duties on the blog, since I have this one and seem to have done an okay job with making at least a part of it my own creation.  Last night, I added some Links to the sidebar and an Upcoming Events calendar.  I was going to post on my own blog for my loyal readers (well, there's at least one of you), but the medicine I got from the dentist made me drowsy.

       Since I had coffee late tonight, I can't sleep very well.  I went through about half a dozen iterations of clicking "some random blog" on my nav bar when I realized that although there are hundreds of thousands of blogs on the 'net, most of them (a) don't have nearly as much attention paid to detail or (b) are just not meant for my type of audience.   For example, this is the last one I read.  It was disheartening enough to make me give up for the night.  I do believe that it's based loosely on English, but that's about all I can tell.  Are these my blogging peers?       in sch now... in a happy mood. hahah yesterday played bball at bukit merah. quite fun sia... hahah played rat and horse... hahaha .... sch sucks manz.,... nothing to do now hahahahhah well nothing to blog now ... ciaoz

       Kelly should like this one. I came across  urlLink a site  that showcases one guy's interests in digital photography. All of the pictures are neat. My favorites are Smoke (shown below) and  urlLink Waterbirds .  The site also has a photoblog, which is just maintained to show off his current projects and supplement them with commentary. If I ever got into digital photography, I'd want to be that good.  urlLink     urlLink

       Using my Site Meter, I can check where people are reading my blog from and the pages that referred them (don't worry, it shows ISPs, not individual IP addresses).  I have shown up and been visited by the following searches lately:       "weight watchers"+"ice cream cake"+"points"+"baskin robbins"      public restroom signs templates      www.hello.com      brazilian contractors members guestbook 2004      dangers of popcorn butter fumes   Most of the time the words almost all come from different posts, but the search returns my URL because they all appear at least once.   urlLink Kelly 's theory is that he doesn't want a site meter because if he actually knew how few people were reading he would lose interest.  To the contrary, I guess that knowing I'm being visited at all and that I actually have one or two regulars is what keeps me interested in writing.

       Wayne and I went to see  urlLink Troy  last night at the  urlLink Alamo Draft House .  First of all, this is the best possible place to see a movie.  It's basically a restaurant/bar in a movie theater.  They purchased an old mall-based movie theater, took out every other row of seats and replaced them with bar tables.  They have a full menu (mostly bar food like sandwiches and appetizers, but to their credit, a huge selection of pizzas) and a wide selection from the bar.  Where else in Houston can you drink beer and watch a movie on a full screen?  If you know of a place, comment here.    One of the best/most inconvenient things about the Draft House is that they don't allow in anyone under 18 without a parent.  That's for any movie, including Shrek 2.  The problem is that no matter how old you look, you get carded to get in.  I went earlier in the day yesterday to buy the tickets, figuring that we'd save ourselves from standing in the long line.  They would sell them to me, but I couldn't take Wayne's ticket because I didn't have his ID.  We just left them there and picked up later.  The good thing about this system, though, is the lack of unsupervised teenagers running around the place acting unruly and being noisy.    So how was the movie, you ask?  Well, I was told that movie was supposed to contain a lot of naked men.  While this didn't turn out to be the case as much as I thought, I wouldn't take children to see it just because of the suggestive content.  It was actually pretty good.  The historical element was nice, because if you've read The Iliad, you can tell where they're going with the storyline.  I like Orlando Bloom, but they make him look like such a little brat in this movie.  My criticism there is that the directors didn't spend adequate time building up the love story between Paris and Helen, then we're left wondering why it was worth it for the two nations to go to war.  There were other love stores which I believe were better told in the movie - Hector and his wife, Achilles and Briseus.    Overall, it was worth the $7 to see the movie.

       Last night, Wayne and I went on a pub crawl with Saint Arnold's Brewery.  If you haven't been on one before, the basic concept behind a pub crawl is to meet in one place (a bar or pub, most likely) and then rotate to the next designated place after an hour or so.  The Saint Arnold pub crawls are always announced with email messages that won't tell you the name of the pub, but give you descriptive enough information to get you where you need to go.    Last night's crawl went to: McElroy's Irish Pub McGonigel's Mucky Duck LZ Pub and Stag's Head  At the Mucky Duck, I played Wayne at Cricket (darts) and actually won!  It got down to each of us having to make one more, and I happened to hit mine first.  This is significant because I suck at darts.  Normally a game with my could last hours and most wouldn't even hit the board, but I was on last night.    We ended up going to 59 diner to sober up and to eat.  I somehow got into a conversation with the manager about their bread pudding and a to-go box of it ended up at our table.  I also remember trying to talk seriously about my new invention of the Beer Charm and how to patent this particular design, and we agreed to go in with a large beer company (like Miller, for example) and have little advertising charms on them.  We had the business plan all figured out.  I mumbled something about how our brains put together would make a great business.  I don't remember much else, though.  Wayne and I had the same number of drinks, but they hit me harder than they do him.  Some people get silly or excited when they're drunk.  I get serious.    This morning, I looked on the US Patent and Trademark Office  urlLink web site  and noticed that beverage charms are patented, but only for the kind that attach to something with a closed handle or a stem.  Mine are not of that type.  I have visions of this being like  urlLink that movie  where the guy invents a dog-poo disappearing spray and becomes filthy rich.  It got terrible reviews.

        urlLink    Wayne and I didn't take as many pictures as we had expected to at the MS 150.  This is probably my favorite.  We had stopped at a break point (which occur every 10-15 miles) to get water and food.  There was a group of kids there selling homemade pastries for their local 4H club.  I purchased two baggies of brownies - one to eat then, and another to eat after the finish line.  Just after we took this photo, everyone started herding toward the other side of the building and all we could hear people saying was "Bees!"  A huge swarm of bees gathered around the handlebars of one girl's bike, so thick that you could no longer tell that the handles were curved.  She had apparently eaten something sweet that had gotten onto her bike.  Thank God they didn't like brownies.  &nbsp; urlLink

       The situation in the Middle East isn't getting any better.  Since  urlLink my friend  is over there, I've been paying close attention to anything I see that happens in Turkey.  Thursday evening, a  urlLink car bomb  went off in a McDonald's parking lot in Istanbul, the very city where he's staying.  If I hadn't seen a recent blog entry from him, I'd be worried.    My Palestinian colleague (located here) was talking to me about this.  She said that a bomb had gone off  recently at some other place in Turkey, but she insists that it's safe.  What a difference in perspective.  We agreed that over here in the States, that kind of statement wouldn't be followed up with "but everything's fine."  If bombs were going off here, all hell would break loose.  The media would go nuts and show bomb footage and computerized reenactments and interviews with Bubbas on the street for weeks on end.  It wouldn't be good.   The interesting thing about the McDonald's boming is that no one was injured, probably because the bombers called the restaurant and gave them 15 minutes to evacuate everyone.  Not what I'd expect.  Of course, it is quite possible that they just didn't like the new adult Happy Meals.

       As far as I know, I'm not allergic to a lot of things.  Some kind of outdoor allergies may cause me to sneeze or my eyes to itch, but that's about it.  This evening I noticed some kind of bizarre red rash that looks and feels like a sunburn, except only in one oval on my shoulder.  It's about 4 inches by 2 inches.  I had elaborate plans to use the gym membership my loving boyfriend got me and work out tonight, but the rash is irritated by the clothes that I would have to wear exercising.  There's no way I'm going to put myself in that much discomfort.  I don't even know what to put on this thing to make it better.    My friend John crossed a Turkish bridge from Europe to Asia yesterday and  urlLink is writing  about touring ancient ruins and artifacts.  I'm talking about a rash.  Hardly compares.

       Unfortunately, some of the things they do in the present aren't very well thought out.    Most kids can probably understand that for every action, notwithstanding whether it's a dare, there are consequences.  One high school Junior from my own state of Texas drank chemicals from his school's chemistry lab when his buddies dared him to.  Was there a thought process here?  How do you get to this kind of decision point and say "Yeah, I think that I should drink that unidentified chemical?"   urlLink The story  reports that he was found in the hallway, bleeding from the nose and mouth.  The kid is in stable condition now and will probably recover.  He can even talk again.  I wonder if it at least scored him the points with his friends that he was going for.   I don't know if I ever did anything in school to make my parents all that proud.  I do know that I never did anything like this.

       Some people have the type of neat, organized desk that looks like no one works there.  Not me.  You can tell that things are getting done and plans are being made.  My desk at work only sometimes reflects my mood.  I have attracted all kinds of office toys and whimsical gadgets to my "work area."  The short list includes a Muppets Magic 8 Ball, a set of  urlLink Magz , several squishy soccer and golf stress balls provided by some insurance company, three daily calendars (Get Fuzzy comic, Fold-a-Day Origami, and George W. Bushisms), and my favorite, two plush bendable flowers - one is pictured below.  I actually hardly play with these things anymore, but they and the fascinating mini-blinds cord keep people's hands occupied when they come to visit me.  Besides, I'm on the Ergonomics team at work, and I suppose that this is setting a good example in relaxation.  &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      urlLink Kelly  is our resident photographer, and he took this picture as well.  I had recruited him on his way out this afternoon to photograph my RollerMouse for the Ergonomics team.  While he was there, he snapped a good one of the flower.

       Thank you,  urlLink Jean-Philippe , for posting the comment that you may have found the camera.  I do believe that the  urlLink one he found  is, indeed, the camera I fell in love with on the commercial.  The discouraging news is that this camera costs about $500, not the affordable range as I had figured.  I'm certainly not in $500 worth of love, so chances are I won't be buying this thing.  For that kind of money, I want to see Steven Tyler just like the ladies in the commercial did.  I don't know why I had estimated it so cheaply; after all, why would Sony spend all that money to promote their low-end camera?  The good news is that Wayne said today that I can use his sometimes.  Since "sometimes" is all I really need to spend with a camera in tow, this plan works out for me.       Result: I'm giving up on wanting a camera for now.  I've gone through this with laptops, too, and still don't have one.  Maybe next I'll focus my futile attentions on  urlLink XM Radio .

       My friend John left yesterday on a trip that will take him to Istanbul, Turkey and Demascus, Syria.  When he first told me he was going, given the current geopolitical climate, I was horrified.  John is a classic American white boy and he'd stick out like a sore thumb in any place where Americans are less than welcome.  He does insist that he has contacted the embassies and other people over there to ensure that it's safe.  I must admit that my fears are based on pure assumptions and I really know nothing about what it's really like over there right now.  Once he gets to Demascus, he'll be joined by our friend Omar, who no doubt knows the lay of the land.   When getting back in touch with my email this evening, I found an email that said "Per Cynthia's suggestion, I am creating web log for my trip so that people can stay connected without getting a bunch of unwanted emails.  I'll update as I have opportunity."  It's nice to know that I've inspired someone to do something.  I've posted a permanent link to his blog on the right, but you can also  urlLink click here  to see it.  I don't have any posts that begin "Made it to Istanbul" - I wonder if he'll sell me some stories that I can tell when he gets back.

       I don't have a digital camera.  I know, I need to step into the 90's and get one, but I haven't really felt a need before.  Wayne has a digital camera that I figured we'd take to major events; problem is, I don't really get to play with it.  Lately, he doesn't either.    I'm soliciting all of your help.  There was a commercial yesterday that I saw on TV - must have been ABC during The Bachelor.  There were several women "doing lunch" at a fashionable little cafe, when they all go nuts and knock tables over because Steven Tyler of Aerosmith walks by.  One woman keeps her composure long enough to snap a photo of him with her very sleek, thin (size of a thin pack of cigarettes, maybe) digital camera.  She then proceeded to shows the picture to all of her girlfriends with the extra large view screen.  I can't remember the name of this camera, but it looked nice, and I somehow got the impression that it would be affordable.  If you see the commercial, please write down what kind of camera that was and let me know.   Wayne tells me that my purchasing style goes something like this:  "I don't know what it is or what it does, but it's pretty and shiny and I must buy it."  He's right.  I know it was pretty and shiny and that I want it.  Next, I need to find out what it was.  What it does (as in specs and features) will come later.

       My office's "backyard" is home to the largest  urlLink Urban Wildscape  in Texas.  My cube window looks out onto it, and the cafeteria is across the pond and over the wooden bridge.  It's nice to have something so serene so close to the office.  The best part is that it's full of animals.  There are enormous catfish filling the pond, which are routinely fed every day at lunch by people who just want to see them get riled up.  One lonely duck and a couple of turtles occasionally compete with them for "people food."    Recently, we got some new residents to the Wildscape.  I was on my daily morning coffee walk to the cafe for a grande Macadamia Nut blend, and a lady was leaning over the railing of the walkway offering bread to a cute little raccoon.  I hadn't ever seen one in person that wasn't roadkill, so I stopped and watched.  She (the raccoon) was definitely a nursing mother by the looks of her.  She was very gentle and sweet with her human waitress.  I was told that she had four or five babies typically in tow.  By lunchtime that day, Building Services had posted signs  everywhere  instructing people not to feed the raccoons.  Apparently they can become rabid and bite people, but I don't see it.             This morning a strange thing happened.  I was walking to get a Diet Dr. Pepper and I saw a big huge bird sitting outside the window.  When I got closer, I could see that he was a peacock.  A peacock!  How do these animals just show up in the middle of a city?  I notice that there aren't any signs saying "Don't Feed the Peacock."  If I can get him close enough, I'm going to do it.  I have plenty of  urlLink Zone Perfect bars  left over in my desk drawer.  I wonder if the peacock likes Fudge Graham.

       Tomorrow I'm going to be leaving work and heading to  urlLink South Shore Harbour  for a  urlLink Toastmasters  district conference.  It's supposed to be a fun, casual atmosphere and the official dress code is Hawaiian shirts.  Still, I feel a bit uncomfortable with that at a networking-type event, so I'm packing half of the clothes I own in the hopes that I can fit in somehow.  I'll be dressing up the tropical getup with a cute khaki skirt that Ann Taylor was happy to sell me today.    Two of the people who are in town for the event are seriously important people to Toastmasters - the current International Director and past International President of the worldwide organization.  I and my corporate TM club (of which, I've already told you, I'm the President) are hosting them for lunch at La Madeliene on Friday.  I stand to learn a lot from these people, and although they're not celebrities, I can imagine I'll become quite the blubbering idiot in front of people who are so accomplished at public speaking.  Also invited were a dozen managers from my company, in hopes that we could network a bit and show off the benefits of Toastmasters.  It has been declined by almost every manager who was invited.  The other two are Tentative, which means "I'm not coming, but I want to be polite."  I'll probably end up personally paying for the Toastmasters folks' lunches, but it all evens out in the end.  Doesn't it?  I wish I was taking the day off tomorrow and just had to worry about these two events.  Don't rub it in if you are.  I couldn't have imagined when I first got the wheels turning in starting a TM club at my office how much time it would consume.  I don't think any of the other officers did, either, and it didn't help that the estimate I gave them was ignorantly low.  It's getting better now that we're off the ground, it's still consuming.  I stayed up past 1:00 a.m. on Monday night creating name tents.  Don't get me wrong, I love doing this stuff, but I see now why we rotate officers every six months in one word: burnout.         ---------------------------------------------------  If you're wondering what I mean by Toastmasters, check out their  urlLink web site .

       I purchased the Special Edition  urlLink Season Finale  DVD yesterday - $7.95 at Wal-Mart.  I won't spoil it for those of you who want to watch it, but I'm satisfied with the way it ended.  That could be a spoiler in itself.   There were one or two seasons when I watched the show every single week, and I liked it.  I know that I could have downloaded this episode for free, but I wanted to have the official one because I have given serious thought to collecting them all, starting with season one.  Over the next year or two, I could watch every episode.  Does that make me strange?  Maybe I should just invest in the "Best Of" DVDs.  It would be easier and cheaper to do this with Will and Grace, which has a lot less seasons to keep up with.    Some people I know say they don't watch TV, and I can understand not being around enough to catch any shows.  Having the DVD is so much better than watching the show, though.  It's commercial-free, pausable/rewindable comedy with a thirty minute resolution to every problem.  Easily watchable entertainment.    Speaking of my one show that I do watch, there are two hours on tonight of  urlLink The Bachelor .  The regular hour is The Women Tell All and the second is a regular episode.  Judging from the spoiler last week they're going to bring back one of the chicks who was kicked off and let her stalk the bachelor.  This disappoints me, because I was so happy with my illusion before that I don't know for sure that the show is staged.  If it goes the way I expect, I'll know it is.

       The afternoons at my job are always boring.  Sure, I have work to do, but in the morning people are bustling around, getting things set for the rest of the day.  The afternoons are long and quiet.   I had the following conversation through email with  urlLink Kelly  yesterday.  It broke up my day enough to entertain me.  This is my typical day.   Cynthia:   Blah.   Kelly:     Yup.    Cynthia:   Create database.           Database don't work.           Delete database.            Rinse.           Repeat as necessary.           All day long.   Kelly:     Package software.           Package don't work.           Ask for help.           No help available.           Use brain to come up with completely new way of doing things.           Finally works.            I'm not paid enough.   Cynthia:   I'm not paid at all.  They reward me at the end of the week in coupons.   Kelly:     You get coupons!!!! Lucky. I get to search the cushions in the lobby.   Cynthia:   I bargained up to coupons, and had to threaten to quit in order to get them.  I used to have to break open the sanitary dispenser in the ladies' room for change.  Don't complain; the lobby is where visitors with real jobs sit and drop their money.  I bet you make a killing there.   Kelly:     You would think so.

       I went back to the doctor yesterday for my ten-day checkup, starting things off immediately on the wrong foot by misunderstanding my appointment time by a half hour.  When I get in to see the doctor, she asks if I can come back in three weeks once the swelling has gone completely down.  I tried to explain to her that I may be smaller now than I was before the surgery, but she wasn't buying the chubby cheeks excuse.  Sigh.    She also gave me something that everyone had been telling me about from their own surgery experience: a curved-end syringe with which to rinse out the tooth holes in the back of my mouth after eating.  Talk about disgusting.  I'm so far not having a good time with this.  After the first rinsing session, I learned that very cold water is not a good idea in there.  I'm grossed out very easily, and I just dread every time I have to rinse with this contraption and wait to see what comes out.  The good news is that I shouldn't have holes for long.  The doctor says that since I didn't have room for wisdom teeth in the first place, I won't have room for holes either.   My pain is mostly gone in the back of my mouth.  It's funny, but all of the residual pain I'm feeling is from the rest of the teeth still pushing forward as if there's still pressure from the wisdom teeth trying to get in.  Some people have to wear braces for years, which I figure to be an illustration of how long it could take for my teeth to realize that they can loosen up.  This is nothing compared with the pain I felt before the surgery, though.  I'm glad it's behind me.

       The reason that I can have this blog hosted by  urlLink Blogger  for free is that Google (who owns them, by the way) places targeted ads at the top of every free blog based on the content of the blog.  I've never really noticed this before or really looked at the ads.  My post from last night was about my blog template and my blog.  The corresponding ads are for web hosting and some dual platform thing.  Makes sense.   When I was creating the post below about the bunny, I went to the blog I referred you to in order to get the link.  I happened to glance at his ads - noting that the Easter Bunny post has been up for a full 24 hours and is probably being returned in search requests - and saw that they are for Easter Bunny baskets and painting eggs.  It's just a matter of time before mine are for the same thing.    If I'm always griping about Windows, for example, and talking about the wonders of Macs, and there is an assumption that the people who read my blog have similar interest, it makes sense that they would target ads for Macs to people who visit my blog.  Overall, I think the ads are pretty smart, even if they're a little off-target once in a while.

       This story is just bizarre.  A church in Pennsylvania celebrated Easter by conducting a service (with kids present) where the Easter Bunny was beaten and had eggs thrown at him in an illustration of what Jesus Christ went through.  What were they thinking?  If the liberals get a hold of this, someone will have to get fired.  To be fair, I found/stole this story from another blogger, and I'll refer you to  urlLink his site  for the full details and link.  Don't adjust your monitor - we're using the same Blogger skin.

       On Sunday,  urlLink Blogger  shut down for two hours so that they could launch the new and improved Blogger.  I like the changes.  For one thing, they have enabled commenting, and I have consequently switched to using theirs.  Also, for less observant readers, they have offered several new templates and I have decided to change the look of my blog to use one of them.  I like this one better - comment and let me know what you think.  It's funny that nearly every blog I have visited lately from the 'recently published blogs' section has updated its look.    I liked this one when I first saw it yesterday, but knew that it would be a headache to implement.  I had been one of those people who isn't satisfied with the plain offering and have gone in and updated my blog by rearranging the code and adding features like my beloved GuestMap (which, by the way, now includes pins in Australia and China).  It did take me some time today to get things arranged the way I want them, but I'm finally satisfied.  If all else fails, I had saved the old template and can return to it at any time.  Another update is to the links section.  I have added the code to redirect to the Next Blog, so every time you click  urlLink Some Random Blog  it should show you a different one.  Pretty neat.  Beware that they're not all even in English.    Along this theme, the Spring 2004 semester is officially over.  I turned in my final take-home essay exam today.  As previously mentioned, I don't intend to return to UHD in the fall.  I'm sure that  urlLink UH Central  is quietly preparing for my arrival as we speak.  There will probably be summer school in some various elective subject or another, but I don't see any problems with being admitted, given my perfect GPA and significant work experience.  I won't miss UHD, but I will miss this semester's class.

       I'm down three more pounds this week for a total of nine since I started.  This week it's actually significant because I was able to eat real food for a good part of the week.  Still, the lack of chewing power meant that even if my diet wasn't restricted to soft foods, I had to practice automatic portion control because it takes me so long to eat.  Even though it's had results for me, I wouldn't recommend the Wisdom Tooth Diet to anyone.  It's very expensive.   This week, I'm actually going to start light exercise again (walking, Yoga, elliptical) and deliberately watch what I eat.  It would be nice to keep up the results.  The funny thing about the nine pounds is that I don't notice it very much.  That's strange, because I'm petite to begin with and nine pounds is a notable portion of my body weight.  That worries me that it's going to bounce back, so I'll have to try extra hard to keep going in the right direction.  The  urlLink Slim-Fast  shakes have helped while I was out from surgery, because of their convenience.  Thankfully, I'm starting to like them.

       Wayne and I went to the  urlLink Art Car Parade  on Saturday, as previously mentioned.  This was our first year to go, and we had a fun time.  Of course, we had to park a couple of miles away in someone's front yard (you think this is an exaggeration, unless you live in Houston or you've ever been to this thing).  While we were looking for a place to park, Wayne spotted a huge turtle sitting on top of a car, with people taking pictures of it.  Something you don't see every day.  Once we had parked and were walking toward the parade, we saw a sign posted on a light post that read "Lost: Large 30 pound Tortoise."  Even stranger.  We had seen the turtle, but now it was gone.  Who has pets like that?   There was a little bit of everything and everyone at the parade.  My favorite car was  urlLink this one , solely because they had a live duck in the front water pond who was eating and enjoying the parade.  I also voted for it because the creators are a bunch of high school students, and winning a $1500 prize would mean something to them.  Several were political entries, most of which were either anti-Bush or anti-American.  Some were of local issues, like the  urlLink Bayport expansion .       My favorites were typcially the animal entries.  The one of the  urlLink rescued German Shepherd  was also cute and almost got my vote.  Unfortunately, we didn't bring a camera to take pictures, our M.O. since most of the training rides for the MS 150.  It was a typical outdoor festival scene.  People were selling worthless stuff and food was bought out of taco trailers.  There was one of those guys who does paintings of the stars and moon entirely with spray paint and a few tools like coffee cans and razor blades.  It's interesting to watch, but I can't see putting up one of the pictures in my home.    To see all of the pictures, go  urlLink here .

       Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld  urlLink met yesterday  with the Senate, as we all heard in our newspapers, TV, and radio.  That is, if you read/watch them.  There were protesters in there calling for him to resign.  What for?  I thought he did a perfect job of defending himself and taking responsibility for something that there's no way he could have ever been truly responsible for.  Some of his opponents pointedly asked if he thought that it would show that the U.S. is serious about the scandal and making sure it stopped.  He admitted that it may, but I disagree.      On the NPR version, you could hear some students in the background chanting something about Rumsfeld resigning.  Where do they find these students?  The ones I know either can't be bothered by politics or they have enough sense not to do something stupid like that.  What about American contractors getting burned alive and hung from bridges?  What about Halliburton employees and soldiers being held hostage on the other side of the world?  I'm hardly incensed by some pictures of naked Iraqis.  These are people who are in the prisons for doing something against our country.  They tried (or succeeded) to kill Americans.  They're people who know what real torture is, and this is not it.

       This thing isn't really working like I had expected.  All but one of my pins are in Texas or the Caribbean, from people I know, and that Canadian one is an automatic post from the system admin.  Of course, I'm grateful for all of the local people who read my blog.  My hope was that the people showing up to my blog from places like Saudi Arabia and Iceland would also post and that I could really see who's checking it out.  If this is your first and only time reading, please feel free to place your pin on the Guest Map.  If you're here all the time, thanks for coming back.

       Some people had actual Friends parties last night, where they invited friends over to watch the last episode of FRIENDS.  The people I know who did actually has the last name of Friend, so it makes it even more interesting.  I used to watch this show religiously, and have fallen out in the last few years.  I can't remember the last time I saw an episode the actual first time it aired.  That said, I really want to see the final show.  If you taped it (hint, Trip) please let me know.    The reason I fell out of the whole FRIENDS routine is that it's too long of a commitment to keep up with a show for ten years.  An entire season of a regular show is tough.  I've turned to  urlLink The Bachelor  to solve my TV dilemma.  With only six or seven episodes per season, it's perfect for someone like me with a short attention span.  I am absolutely addicted to this show.  I either watch an entire season or none at all.  Wayne is a sweetheart and actually tapes my show for me while I'm in class, then I watch it when I get to his place afterward.  This Wednesday there was a tradeoff and I had to watch Star Trek Enterprise to get him to watch it with me, but it was worth it.    This show, the Bachelor kicked off the witch that everyone has hated from the first episode, and the one that is probably thrilling the producers and bringing them ratings.  She is a complete nightmare.  At the end of the episode, she promises that "This isn't over" and they show clips from the next episode her stalking him on his dates with the other girls.  I don't get the compulsion to embarrass oneself in front of the whole viewing audience like that.  Reality TV, in that way, is made up of a bunch of wackos.  Still, I won't pretend I'm not entertained.

       Yesterday, my project manager decided to buy tickets to the Astros game for the project team - well, part of the project team.  It started with a very small subteam, who then invited a slightly larger subteam, and then in order to be fair, the Project Engineer invited a significantly larger subteam and the PM decided to pay for it.  It works for me, because I got to go and still got paid for the day.  I did hear that there was a little bit of chatter of people feeling left out, and I can understand why the if you invite everyone but four people (in a department of about 40) that could happen.  It was strange, actually, that we got to do this at all.  A throwback to the days almost three years ago when I first joined the company and times were good.  Money was everywhere, and projects were struggling to spend it.  One project that I was on had regular monthly paid happy hours at the Fox & Hound, and all had the "unofficial" after-party.  This wasn't quite so frivolous, as we still paid for our own food and drinks, but it was a nice day for baseball and we won the game.     urlLink Kelly , the resident photographer, left to go take a bunch of pictures around the stadium.  He came back and reported that there were two guys smoking pot up in the belltower.  I'm surprised they could get away with that when I had my purse searched and was almost padded down, but that's the way things go.   The most interesting part didn't happen during the game.  At least, not for me.  Several (about 4-5) of our co-workers, the Boys' Club I sometimes go to lunch with, had purchased seats at a higher location.  When they came down to meet everyone else, there had been hours of beer pouring in, so they were a lot of fun.  We resolved to meet at the Flying Saucer after the game, and the after-party began.  I learned that drunkenness is more fun when you're sober, or at least closer to it than everyone else.  When Kelly gets the pictures posted, I'll link to them here.   The  urlLink Saucer  is a great place for a happy hour or to bring a group.  They have a tap selection that spans a very long wall, offering 85 different beers.  There are hundreds more on tap.  Two in our party were U.F.O. club members and printed out how many they had left to drink of the 200 unique beers required to get one's name on a 'saucer' on the ceiling.  One guy sitting on the bar had done so at least a dozen times and had plates bearing his name all over the wall.  It would take me 10 years to do it once.  We played darts, at which I'm terrible, for hours until my boyfriend showed up.  Then, I actually started hitting the board a couple of times.  It was sad that people who'd consumed gallons of beer and the one who's legally blind completely kicked my sober butt at darts.  Wayne won one of the money rounds, which basically made up for the expensive parking downtown.    Our next stop was Bossa, where we drank some kind of Brazilian drink that comes with a sugar cane and was reported to be so strong we couldn't drink two.  I never did feel it.  We kept trying to get the waitress to tell our friend she loved his Seersucker shirt, but she wouldn't do it.  I honestly don't think she knew what that was.  Wayne and I soon departed the group and finished with a nice sidewalk dinner at an Italian restaurant we have been to and loved.  Eating at this point is STILL tricky (it's been 8 days since the surgery!) so I had to cut my linguine and shrimp into teeny tiny pieces in order to eat them and manage only to chew with my front chompers.  It took me forever to eat a tiny portion, and I think I forgot and left the doggie bag on the table.  On the way back to the car, we were approached by a bum.  I guess that with as many as there are downtown, we're lucky it's just one.    All in all, a fun night.  Tonight is not so fun.  I'm supposed to be working on a part of my final paper for class (yay!) and then get some rest hopefully early.  In case you start to think I have no life, Wayne and I are going to the  urlLink Art Car Parade  tomorrow.  Now aren't we exciting?

       Thanks to everyone who reads this blog for bearing with me while I was out for surgery and recovery.  It's been noticed that I haven't blogged in a while and my readership was down to 2 today.  That included me.    Although I had expected to return to work yesterday, I didn't.  I couldn't talk much and be comfortable.  I still wasn't feeling well either and my face was just slightly less rotund than the day before.  Saturday was the worst day for the swelling.  I walked (stumbled?) into where Wayne was sitting at his computer and asked "Do I look a little swolen?"  By the look on his face, I knew it was bad.  By looking at my face, you'd have thought I weighed 400 lbs.  Just for those who haven't met me, I'm nowhere close.  He had a good idea - said I should have put on some baggy clothes and taken a Slim-Fast "before" picture.  Then when I lose my twenty, take an "after" pic and overestimate the weight loss for their little award program.  That's cheating, but it made me laugh.    Last night, I had to re-enter the civilized world and attend class.  I felt bad about it, but even though I'd been laying at home all day I still arrived late.  I had intended to keep a low profile and sit at the back of the class, not saying anything so I wouldn't draw attention to my face, but it was hard.  This is the one class where the professor really engages the students by encouraging dialougue instead of a plain old lecture, and I'm one of the four-or-so "big talkers."  When I got in a discussion with some students after class, I had to let them know that I'd had my wisdom teeth pulled because they were all looking at me like something was wrong but they weren't sure whether to ask.  One person responded, "Okay, because it looks like you've been taking steroids."  Thanks.  One more day of class (turning in the final paper next Monday) and I will never set foot at  urlLink UHD  again.  I do hope that in the future, I'll have more classes like this one.    I was getting the sympathy card (figuratively) at work all day, which started to annoy me because it meant I had to give the progress report 100 times.  After a while, though, I just rode that train straight through the rest of the day.  I felt like just as much of a wreck as my face looked, so why not?  Our company's  urlLink Toastmasters  club, of which I am the President, meets every Tuesday at lunch.  As the presiding officer, I open and close every meeting, but today, the VP of Education kindly took that role for me so that I could sit back and preserve my jaws.  It helped a lot that I didn't have to speak at all - for the first time since the club was founded.  It also happened to be one of our best meetings ever.  Go figure.    As for my current report, I'm still swolen, but less every day than the one before.  My voice sounds like I'm trying on braces for the first time and still getting used to my mouth.  In a way, it's like that.  I'm not sure if my tongue is swolen or if it's just resting between my teeth for no reason.  Closing the jaws all the way is still a chore, so I'm not pushing it right now.  I wonder why this is so hard on me when so many others have had such an easy time with it, and my best theory is the complexity of the surgery.  My two top wisdom teeth were actually coming in facing the back of the mouth on the top part of the jaw, where they didn't have room to come in straight.  This meant that they would rub against the mandible joint every time that it moved.  Now I have holes there.  In addition, I had one 'double' tooth, which looked like it was almost two teeth fused together.  All four were impacted, and thus required cutting and sawing to remove.  It makes me feel better to act like this was a major deal, but I'm aware that it's not heart surgery.    My diet is completely soft, except for the rice I have eaten the last two days.  Today I hardly ate much at work and, in an attempt to get some calories into my system, picked up a Baskin Robbins Cappucino Blast on the way home.  I'm not on Weight Watchers or anything, but on the little conversion chart hanging in the store, my selection had the most "points" of anything on the menu, unless I ate a whole ice cream cake.  I tried to savor the moment, but the smoothie wasn't as satisfying as it would normally be.  I want to eat meat!  You know, real food.    I've been told through a chain of three people that I have a reader in Fargo.  Thanks for the well-wishes!  I wonder if I'll find a Fargo pin on the GuestMap... we'll wait and see.

       It is now three days since my surgery, and I'm feeling just slightly better.  The first day was miserable; I could hardly keep down any food at all.  Yesterday, the swelling hit.  My face is now about the size of a basketball and I can't move it enough to talk in a normal voice.  Something tells me this will not all be gone by tomorrow, which is when I said I would be going back to work.  I won't be returning before I'm well enough, but I hate to call in just because I underestimated my recovery time.  I'm also anxious to be able to do things like talk, eat, work, and be normal.  It's one of those damned if you do (or don't) situations: either I'm drugged and feeling good, or I'm in pain but coherent.     Wayne has been a total sweetheart through all of this.  He's run around to get me smoothies, ice cream, movies, soup, and anything else he thought I would need.  Even the moral support is extremely valuable.  I don't know what I would have done without his help.    I don't really have anything else to post on, since I've done close to nothing for several days.  Saw the "Beverly Hillbillies" today, and "Matchstick Men" yesterday.  "Something's Gotta Give" was the day before that.  Maybe I should have been more productive with this time and become some kind of movie buff, but that takes energy.   I'll write more when I'm up and running again.

       The "new"  urlLink Toastmasters  club isn't really new anymore, and it's been very fun to see this progress go on.  Don't get me wrong, it's a ton of work.  Although I love what I'm doing this, I'm sure that in six months I'll be ready to leave the role in favor of "Immediate Past President," which I understand is all the fun with almost none of the work.    I have gotten the chance to visit a couple of other clubs lately, which has been neat.  Last Tuesday, I visited one called  urlLink Creek Speakers .  They're definitely a new and growing group with lots of room for speaking opportunities.  Since they only meet twice a month, I decided to join that one on the next meeting in a couple of weeks.  I'll also be giving my next speech.    Last night I went with one of the other club officers to the charter presentation for another Dow club,  urlLink Diamond Toastmasters  in Freeport.  They started up just shortly before we did, and were neat to talk to because they have a very similar culture to ours.  The cake they kept feeding us didn't hurt either.   Something pretty cool happened today.  Right before we started our meeting, which is held in a conference room adjacent to the company cafeteria, a guy who saw a few people he knew stuck in his head and asked what we were doing.  Before he could protest, members had found him a seat and an agenda and he stayed for the whole meeting.  He was even called on during the Table Topics session, an unusual thing to do for a visitor, and he did such a great job that he got our Best Table Topics award for the meeting.  At the end, he came to me and asked, "How do I join?"  Now  that  was a great meeting.   When I first started doing this, another club president told me that Toastmasters had changed his life, and he knew it would for me, too.  At the time I thought it was a strong statement, but I can't say I haven't learned a great deal from this whole experience so far.  It's interesting that I'm the youngest person in the group, and for most people, by at least 10 to 15 years.  To be "leading" people in something who have that level of experience over me is a challenge that I try my best to meet.  The best complement that I have gotten was from someone who said that they could tell why I do everything I do for the club - because I feel a sense of ownership of making sure things go well.  I hope to live up to that.

       I've had a while to write about this, but I haven't yet because I've been getting negligent in my blog writing.  My intentions are to pick that up again soon.   On June 14th (a week ago yesterday), Wayne and I celebrated our two year dating anniversary.  A lot of people tell me that they didn't do this, but I think it's important.  Whether you're married or not, it's always good to show in a relationship that you're happy to still be there.  That's definitely the case for me; it's been a great two years.   We marked the occasion by dining at the place where we met, La Vista on Fountainview.  It's hard to explain the appeal of a place where people will bring their own wine and drink it while waiting in the parking lot for a table, but this little sidewalk cafe has its own unique personality.  We did bring the "good wine," for what it's worth.  Later we watched a rented movie and fell asleep on the couch.    In the Wayne-and-Cynthia gift giving tradition, we made up wish lists for the other person to pick from for gifts.  I had quite a time picking out Wayne's barbecue grill, going to several different stores before finally selecting one that wasn't even on his list, the  urlLink Aussie Bushman Elite .  We've cooked on it several times, and I must say, it's pretty nice.  I haven't quite mastered making the food come out perfectly, but we're getting there.   What he got me was also cool.  I had put three MP3 players on my list, and the one he found -  urlLink Samsung 'yepp  - was cute and tiny.  I was happy that he picked it instead of the jewelry I had asked for that wouldn't really be very nice in our price range.  (Wayne, if you're reading this, it's not an endorsement for electronics over jewelry every time.  I just want to make that clear.)   urlLink     urlLink     On Sunday night, I got a bit agitated with the player because I couldn't get files onto it.  The error message just read "g".  What am I supposed to tell from that?  The next dialog box would reboot my machine if I hit yes, which I accidentally did several times.  It was frustrating.  It didn't dawn on me until tonight that I was writing to the wrong drive entirely.  To my credit, it doesn't show up in Windows Explorer unless I just try the F:\ drive.  Now that I can get music onto it, I like the device even better.    It's funny; I write code at work for plant equipment symbols with complex mathematical logic and scripts that can move directory trees, but something like this can still have me stumped for two days.

       It looks like there's  urlLink one more Bachelor  whose relationship didn't last.  Of the five men who have starred in ABC's  The Bachelor , none have been able to keep their relationships going.  The two women who have been Bachelorettes, Trista Rehn and Meredith Philips, are either married or engaged to the men they met on the show.  Even though I know it's a bit fake, I have for some reason stuck with this show through most of its seasons.  This season was the only one where the guy actually picked the girl I thought he should have; it unfortunately didn't work out because "individually, [their] next steps take [them] in different directions."  Was this something that they didn't discover before he picked her?   One reality show that probably won't disappoint me is the parody show,  urlLink Joe Schmo 2 .  This is the one where everyone except two people are actors, and the other two people think it's actually a reality show and they're all there for the same reasons.  I've only seen the first episode, but it's already funny.  The best part is how cheesy it is.  They parody  everything  about other reality shows, including the bad plot twists and goofy host.  Before every commercial they promise to show "the most shocking elimination ceremony ever!"  All of the actors play off some stereotypical character: the drunk, the player, the rich guy, the ditz, the gotta-be-gay guy.  Check out this show if you can.

       I thought it would be an interesting experement to click through to the next five "random blogs" and see I turn up with.     The  urlLink Princess  - Too ... many... ellipses.  It's excessive.  The  urlLink Stinch of Life  - I'm not kidding, that's her title!  Some teeny bopper song played when I hit the page and made me feel old as dirt, even though I'm not.    The  urlLink Bush Hater  - I strongly disagree with his politics, but this guy can write in complete sentences and I'm impressed.   The  urlLink Foreign Blog  - Is that Portuguese?  The  urlLink Grammar Nightmare  - wHAt iS it ABouT pEOplE WhO wRiTE lIKe thIs?  I blame it on bad schools in Singapore.    I seem to get discouraged every time I see who my blogging peers are.   urlLink The   urlLink people   urlLink I   urlLink know   urlLink who   urlLink have   urlLink blogs  don't write poorly at all.  Perhaps it's because when we were growing up (seriously) the main form of communication wasn't the dumbed-down cyberEnglish chatter that we see from these kids today.  It must be such a challenge to be a teacher having to explain why LOL is not a word they should use in a term paper.  I shudder to think of how business communication will look in ten years.

       Wayne (my boyfriend, if you haven't caught on yet) is currently going through a 10 week training program for a Triathlon.  It's the sports kind, where there is a 5K run, a 1500 meter swim, and a moderate length bike ride.  He works out six days a week, two on each sport.  Last night we went running together at Memorial Park, and as I had suspected, I couldn't keep his pace.  He says he's doing this in order to keep active after our MS 150 ride, and it makes good sense to me to do that.   Even though I know he'll never read this, I just wanted to share that I'm very proud of him - even if he comes in last, which he won't.  He was always the one pulling me through on the MS 150 training, encouraging me along the way.  Wayne is the kind of person that is very capable of accomplishing things when he sets out to do them, and he doesn't settle for less than his best effort.  I'm looking forward to cheering him across the finish line in his first Tri.    He has also inspired me to do something in the off season to challenge myself athletically.  This may be interesting with all of the teeth problems I've had lately and how little I've been working out.  The first weekend in July I'll be joining Houston Fit for their Half-Marathon training program.  I trained for the full marathon three years ago and because of a poor shoe fit ended up having problems with my right knee.  I got up to the point where we ran 13 miles on one long training run and then I couldn't run any longer.  This time I'm being smarter about it, starting with getting the right shoes, and setting a more attainable goal in the half marathon.  Maybe next year I'll go for the full 26.2 miles.    Wayne is supportive as always, right behind me in anything I decide to do.  This is one of my favorite things about our relationship.   Tomorrow (actually, today) we will celebrate the two year anniversary of our first date.  Don't expect any blog posts on Monday night, as I will have much better things to do.

       I attended a new church today, while Wayne went off to the cycling practice part of his Triathlon training class (more on that later).  Note that we don't live together, I'm just there most of the time.   Anyway, about the church.  About a year ago, I started to notice new construction going up on a beautiful gothic-style church on the campus of  urlLink St. Martin's Episcopal  at the corner of Woodway & Sage.  Keep in mind that this is one of the most affluent areas of Houston, and the parishoners certainly look the part.  It's no surprise that they came up with the money for this big gorgeous building.  Since it opened on Easter this year, I have been wanting to go in there.    urlLink     urlLink    Not knowing what time it started and having already slept in until almost 9:00, I missed the early service.  I could also not attend the late service, because Wayne would be coming back and we didn't have time.  Instead, I attended an interesting adult lecture class on Islam - but clearly from the Christian perspective.  It's been a while since I've been to church, and even longer since I've been to one that I liked.   This church was nice, and the people seemed friendly.  On the way out, even though I knew I could not stay, I walked through the main worhip hall of the new church and grabbed a program.  It was absolutely beautiful.  I saw and heard the organ that they had talked about on the web site; it consumed the entire front wall.  There were stained glass windows everywhere.  I made it a point to come back next week and bring Wayne as soon as he was done with training.   One reason I haven't found a church yet is because I have a serious bias about church singing.  I know that some singing is inevitable, and that it's intended to praise God; I understand all of that.  I just don't like to sing.  I especially don't like the Christian-rock style singing that they have in some contemporary services.  Not my style.  The church I went to growing up, when we went, was Catholic.  Given that the Episcopals are supposed to be Catholic-Lite, I think I will be able to identify with their worship service.   After Church I went back to Wayne's, where I waited 15 minutes outside the gate without a remote and not knowing the new code.  Since I had asked Wayne a week ago to find out the new code or get me a clicker, I greeted him in a bad mood when he came home just after me.  Even though I felt I had a right to be annoyed, I immediately regretted being grumpy with him.  I'm still learning when to pick and choose my battles.

       Wow, it's been almost a week since I last posted.  Of course, a lot has changed - like that I'm back from Chicago.  I spent nearly an hour and a half last night blogging about the trip, and that was supposed to be the highlights.  When trying to check my links I lost everything and was too disenchanted to start over.  So, here is the super-condensed version.    Friday   Arrive in Chicago Lunch at O'Neil's Pub  urlLink MetroDucks  Tour Nap  Dinner at  urlLink Pizzeria Due    Saturday   Shopping on the Magnificent Mile (hey, it was cold there!)  Chicago Cubs Baseball Game   urlLink Bar Louie  by Wrigley Field Nap Evening and dinner at  urlLink Navy Pier   urlLink Hancock Observatory , just in time for fireworks show   Sunday    urlLink Field Museum   urlLink Shedd Aquarium   urlLink Adler Planetarium  Visited and promptly left  urlLink Kitty O'Shea's  Nap Bike Riding along Lake Michigan Dinner at  urlLink Trattoria Roma    Monday     urlLink Chicago Mercantile Exchange   urlLink Art Institute   We ended up doing everything that Ferris Beuller did on his day off except for be in a parade, but that had no influence on where we went or what we did.  I absolutely love this city and hated to come back.  I do have somehow make a living, so I returned to the 9-5 (actually 6-6) world today.   We did take pictures and I have lots of observations.  I will write about them all later.

       This article from  urlLink NBC4.com  is short, so I'll paste the whole thing.  Something tells me that people who eat insects need to be checked for more than just allergies.    Cicada Snack Sickens Man   POSTED: 9:15 a.m. EDT May 18, 2004 UPDATED: 9:20 a.m. EDT May 18, 2004  BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -- An Indiana man is learning the hard way that eating bugs can be dangerous.   Dr. Al Ripani said the man showed up at his Bloomington clinic after eating nearly 30 cicadas. The man, who wasn't named, suffered a strong allergic reaction to the sauteed insects.   Individuals with allergies to shellfish are especially at risk.    He had read a newspaper article about cooking the bugs and tried them with butter, crushed garlic and basil. But the article didn't warn that people with food allergies can also be allergic to cooked insects.   The cicadas are causing quite a stir across much of the eastern United States, where they emerge once every 17 years.

       Today I did one responsible thing and realized the effects of a different  ir responsible thing.    First, a responsible thing:  I purchased a copy of " urlLink The Complete Idiot's Guide to Personal Finance in Your 20s and 30s ."  If anyone needs this book, it's me, but I needed it about five years ago even more.  They should issue one copy of this book with Baby's First Mastercard that we all start getting applications for when we're about twelve.  I remember myself at 18.  "What's this?  A thousand dollars in free plastic money?!  And I can pay it back whenever I feel like it?!  Let's go to bartending school!"  Just like that, $700 gone.  As you can see, I've long been a subscriber to the  It's Shiny and I Want It  buying philosophy.  To my benefit, I'm getting better, though not as quickly as I would wish.  Now, the irresponsible thing:  I noticed that my debit card was gone.  Not in my wallet.  Vanished.  I tried to mentally retrace my steps, particularly when using the card.  I could clearly remember going to the ATM on Sunday.  I took my money.  I took my reciept.  I don't remember taking the debit card.   I figure they cancel each other out, so I'm about even.  In an effort to do something effective, I have spent the past two hours organizing my bedroom.  Still don't feel any better about losing the card.  Tomorrow when I go to the credit union and ask for a new one, I'll see if they can give me two backups, just in case.

       I was curious, so I looked again when I got home.  Since the post I made previously about William Hung, I have had four new visitors looking for similar searches.  Now that I made the previous post, I show up anywhere from third to first in the search results.  The searches are now more focused on finding the audio of the game.  If I can find it, I might as well post it here.   10:44 Update - If the audio file can't be found on the Peer to Peer networks, it doesn't exist.  Therefore, it doesn't exist.  Not that I  actually use  P2P software.  Someone told me.

       I try not to become a slave to my site meter, and have made a commitment to myself that I won't (a) check it every day, nor (b) ever change my content based on the results I see there.  This is what those in hip-hop (this may be the only reference you ever see to that type of music on my blog) would call "keeping it real."     urlLink     urlLink     One thing that I couldn't help but notice is that I had  11  visits yesterday from different variations of the search " urlLink William Hung " and "Take me out to the ball game."  Upon further research, every last one of them was from a different ISP.  There were actually eleven people who wanted to hear about William Hung and singing at the ballgame!   urlLink Yahoo Search  seemed to turn up my blog the most often, about which I can't complain.  Curious, I followed  urlLink one of the links  to find that he was scheduled to sing America's second National Anthem at a Toronto Bluejays vs. Texas Rangers game on Sunday.  This is what people care about.  To the Americans' credit, several of the ISPs listed were Canadian.  When will this fad end?

       Let me open this one up to the readers. As a part of my new get-organized kick, I have come across two gifts that I have gotten for Christmases past which I never used, and never intended to use. The person who gave them had good intentions, I just don't have much room or need for decoration items, since I'm not home very much.     Is it okay to re-gift these things, if done in a secretive kind of way? I'm open to suggestions, since I got so many great comments about the muffins (you half-muffin-eating wierdo's!).

        It's Sunday evening, and finally some time to sit and update the blog, as several of my inquiring readers have requested. At least it's good to know that somebody's reading. I may as well give them [you] reason to continue doing so.           Friday was... interesting. Anna had a slumber party at her house, "The kind we used to have in the 3rd grade," according to the Evite. Expecting that it would be all girls, I was surprised to see a guy there,   wearing one of Anna's outfits,   and serving tamales, hostess cakes, and anything else we asked for. One of the best things about Anna's place is the view - her huge patio looks out over the Houston Medical Center and Downtown. We sat outside for part of the evening. When it was time to go home, Wayne picked me up. He knew that we'd have been drinking and wanted me to enjoy myself without having to drive. Isn't he sweet?           My disclaimer here is that Anna's party is not my normal type of weekend. Saturday and Sunday are a lot more in-character for me. Read: boring.           Saturday morning I overslept and completely missed both my running group with HoustonFit and the Toastmasters seminar for contest competitors. Note to self: remember to set the alarm when I have to get up early. That evening Wayne and I took advantage of the gift certificate I had won in last week's Christmas in July raffle: $50 at Rio Ranch Steakhouse. It was more food than two people, or even four, could reasonably be expected to eat. We still had creme brulee for dessert, though. Who could expect us to pass that up?           This morning started with an 'elegant' IHOP brunch. Though it normally wouldn't be noteworthy to have done this, we made an observation. The small restaurant was packed out the door, which would be enough for most people to leave and go some place else. After all, this is IHOP food we're talking about, not something that's actually worth waiting for. When we approached the counter, however, we were ushered immediately to a table for two. The way that this place works is that most of the tables are small, made for two to four people - tops. Perhaps they have one six-person table there, but not more than that. In addition, these tables cannot be moved. Most are booths, but the tables are also not movable, as they are attached to the walls. We also noticed that we fit just about right in the small two-person booth; if we had been any larger than our very average-to-small sizes, we may have been less than comfortable.           It stands to reason, knowing these things, that large groups nor overly large people would frequent this restaurant. However, that's at last 80% of what we saw. As we left the restaurant, there was a family waiting outside with at least 17-18 people. About half were kids. All were more than overweight. We made the observation that after waiting outside for 30 minutes, they would probably have to sit at no less than four separate tables and be uncomfortable. It was doubtful that they'd leave a tip after that. It must be days like today that makes the servers want to work at House of Pies.           Back to how my day went. This afternoon was full of errand-running and being productive. I got my car cleaned out, which is a Herculean feat in itself. My desk and paperwork desperately needed organization. And I went through my clothes and shoes for a second round of charity sweep and got rid of a laundry basket each of clothes and shoes.           I even had dinner with my mom tonight. Since she and my dad have been going through a divorce, she talks to me much more openly now. I have to say, it's strange. My parents, as it turns out, are real people with feelings. Who'd have known?     Join me for more exciting updates this week, as I finish more on my to-do list, including: buy a hamper, send thank-you notes, get a watch battery, and donate my old books.  I may have to put an "explicit" warning on this blog!  Let me add 'take the dog to the groomer,' because she's here under my chair and smells rained-on.  Yuck.

       While at the local grocery store this weekend, I purchased some banana nut muffins, mostly becacuse they were being given as samples and they were fresh.  When I later offered one to Wayne, he declined because he's "not really into muffins very much."  But he offered to eat the top.    This launched an entire debate about whether muffin tops were better than the rest of the muffin (his position) or if it's just as good all the way through (mine).  His argument, which is only mildly valid, is that the tops are where all the good stuff is, like the toppings or fruity chunks.  The muffins I had in hand had only a few more nuts on top, but were nutty all the way to the bottom, and softer at that part, too.  While I thought that this was absurd, he insisted that he's been to several meetings where the tops were eaten from the muffins and the stumps were left for trash.    One of us finally remarked that we were having a Seinfeldian pointless conversation, and it turns out that  urlLink Google  tells me we were.  There was a  urlLink Seinfeld episode  where Elaine and Mr. Lippman open a muffin shop that sells only tops.  When they give the leftover stumps to the local soup kitchen, they get nothing but complaints.  It appears that the homeless don't like the stumps either.    My solution is to get better muffins.  If any part of it isn't good, then it's not worth eating.    This whole debate worked out for the best, though.  Wayne and I concluded that if we ever have a muffin together, we can both eat our respective parts.  That's good enough for me.

       What are the requirements for becoming an Olympic sport?  I'm sure that camel racing is well on its way.   This weekend, Australia hosted the premier camel race, the  urlLink Camel Cup Carnival .  The Afghan ambassador to Australia even flew in for the event.    The last camel I saw was spitting all over the enclosure he was in.  He hardly seemed like a majestic animal to me.  I guess this is proof that if you can imagine it, then somebody is doing it.

       I went to a Toastmasters training today for the officers of various clubs.  Events like this are always neat because we get to network and meet other people.  I came out with an invitation to give guest speeches at  urlLink another club  that has about five members out in Tomball and is in a rebuilding stage.  The other person there from my club may join this as a second club, which would work out well because he and I both have a lot of speeches to give before June if we're going to help the club with reaching its goals.  I would have, but I've already got a second club and haven't got time for a third.   I got an email from  urlLink Nora  asking about Toastmasters.  It's interesting to hear that I've been able to share something that at least sparks someone else's curiosity.  If anyone wants to know more about it, there's some great information  urlLink here .  That doesn't mean that I don't like getting questions about it, because I really do.

       I found out yesterday that  urlLink I'm listed  on  urlLink BlogShares .  By the description on their web site, BlogShares is "a simulated, fantasy stock market for weblogs where players invest fictional money to buy stocks and bonds in an artificial economy where attention is the commodity and weblogs are the companies."  My trading price as of this writing is $47.80.  The way that it seems to work is just like the stock market, except that it's fake.  I currently only own about 10 shares of my own blog, because that's all I could afford with the requisite $500 of fake money they gave me.  If nothing else, BlogShares could be a good lesson in trading on the stock market.    This reminds me of the movie that Wayne had me watch this weekend called  urlLink Trading Places  (1983) with Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd.  It was about what happens when two brokerage firm owners make a bet that they can take their best trader and make him "trade places" with a bum off the street just by changing the environment they're given.  Despite all of the bad eighties clothes and pop culture references, it wasn't a bad movie.  There is a part where they are on the trading floor, and it reminded me of when Wayne and I went to Chicago last month and visited the  urlLink Chicago Mercantile Exchange .  There were all sorts of people running around in different colored jackets, waving hand signals at each other and frantically filling out order slips.  Those bunch of goofy looking people were probably littered with millionaires, though.  It was organized chaos.

       Apparently, there is an ongoing count somewhere of how many days it's been since I updated my blog.  The current count is 13.  I apologize to all two of you who read regularly; here is my attempt to update again.   To my credit, there are several external factors upon which I can blame my blogging negligence:  - Kelly having given me the audiobook version (unabridged!) of the  urlLink DaVinci Code .  - Several things going on at once, including starting a running program, more Toastmasters stuff, more work to do at the office (which hints to job security, so I'm happy), and school.   - Working on getting everything in to UH by the right deadlines for admission into the Electrical Engineering degree program, and subsequent activities after being accepted to said program.  - Editing  urlLink Kelly 's updated resume.   But of course, in the long run, I can only blame it on one lasting factor:  - Laziness.

       Being sick, that's what.  More specifically, being just sick enough on Friday that I can still go to work but be miserable the whole time, have a fever of 102.5 by Saturday morning, and have to lay in bed all weekend and eat ice cream.  Okay, so the latter two things weren't bad, but getting dizzy every time I stood up too fast left something to be desired.  I still don't know what was wrong with me (or my health), but the number one suspect right now is a sinus infection.  Ugh.  The weekend would have been extremely boring and miserable if I didn't have my Nurse Wayne there to take care of me.  Have I told you guys I'm lucky?  Just checking.  I'm feeling much better now.  Just in time to not miss any work.  How fortunate.

      Although the relationship was short lived, I had a great date at La Vista.  We went to pick up some wine before and sat in the parking lot drinking while we waited. Although that doesn't sound all that romantic, its a cute tradition at La Vista. Friends of mine met there two years and I haven't been able to pry them apart since then.  The mood is very festive and the food is wonderful. If you need a good first date place La Vista is a great suggestion.

      Anonymous said...      Wow, this is great. I have something I have wanted to share with all the single men and women out there about my worst dating experience, but have never had a place to begin my tale.      When I turned 37, I was pretty determined to find the man for me and get married. One day out of nowhere, I recieved a call from a dating service telling me they wanted to survey my experience. I had previously responded to a personal ad I found in a publication I picked up at Cafe Artiste and thought they were referring to that. So I agreed to go in and talk to them.      It was actually Together Dating Service. I was put into a room and given a hard sale by one of their reps. I decided that since it was a goal of mine to be married, it might be worth the incredible sum of money to join.      The gist of their program is that you fill out a thing about yourself and what you are looking for in a mate so they can find you the perfect match. Sounded good to me. How substantial can a relationship be if it is founded only on physical attraction? Doesn't this process help you get to the chase?      Well first of all, I quickly discovered that there were no qualifications for the people making matches. As a matter of fact, I don't even think they read my profile. It said, clear as day that I'm an atheist. They set me up with several born again Christian men. I had also indicated that I didn't want to date anyone outside the beltway and that I preferred meeting people close to where I lived or out towards the galleria. I guess they thought Conroe, Katy and Pasadena fit in that area.      All told, I went out with 23 men. By about number 19, I was screening them myself over the phone before even agreeing to meet them in person. They were sending me 2 and 3 intros a week. I was discovering that very few women were in this organization. While I was getting 2 - 3 intros a week, these guys are getting 1 - 2 intros a month. There was a lot of pressure on them to make something click since the opportunities were so few and far between.      Bottom line is I was absolutely miserable. I am so angry by the lack of care and respect they held for their patrons. It is a money scam from day one.      If anyone wants to join a dating service such as Together, DO NOT FOCUS ON THE NUMBER OF MEMBERS in their membership. That is what they want you to see. YOU GET THEM TO SHOW YOU IN WRITING WHAT THEIR SUCCESS RATE IS IN CREATING SUCCESSFUL MATCHES. Because I promise you, you mix enough men and women together, you're going to get some matches. But they gave me the impression that they did more than just throw people together.      It isn't worth the investment.

      Hello,  This blog is for singles in the thirty plus age group.  My friend Cynthia has a blog and it's kinda fun to see what's going on in her life.  I thought that this would be a good forum to tell the good and the bad of dating.    The following questions are examples of what I feel might be helpful to other daters.  Where's a good place for a first date?  What are your dating nightmare stories?  Do you have good ideas for meeting new and fun people?  Do you use an online service?  What are the best ones?  Do you have any tips as to the best way to fill out the online profiles?  How do you transition from the cyberworld, to the real world?  There are probably others I haven't thought of.  I'd like to add links, but I am waiting to get feedback from others before adding them.  Thanks for taking the time to read my blog, I look forward to hearing your thoughts!  Angie

      In a comment to my last post somebody asked why would I want to get dates from the internet instead of traditional ways of meeting people.  He wasn't asking in a judgy kind of way, he's done it too, but it really is a good question.  The first reason that I use the internet is that I am busy.  I am a struggling realtor just trying to get as much business as possible.  Sometimes I am not home until late and don't want to go out.  With a traditional job you can go to happy hour, but that is not often in the cards for me.    The next reason is something that may be difficult to understand.  I am an extremely social person.  I have friends all over this town and am invited to really cool events.  You're probably thinking well what's the problem?  I think that the problem with that is I am so unapproachable when I'm out and about because I'm always engaged in conversation with some friend I haven't seen in a while.   Finally, I just can't get into that meat market groove.  When I see somebody that I'd like to meet, I am too shy to approach.  When somebody starts talking to me, I am often clueless to the fact that they would like to get to know me.    I am a very nice person, but sometimes appear to be aloof to new people.  I think that an internet date gets alot of that out of the way.  It's like I'd like to meet somebody, you'd like to meet somebody, so we are here to see if we click.    What do you think?

      I don't know if anyone reads this, but I just thought I'd share.  I am going out for dinner and drinks with another fine gentleman I've met on the internet.  I think he's a nice guy, but I'm not sure we click.  I'm going out with him anyway because my friends tell me I don't give people enough of a chance.  So, I'm not too sure about this guy.  I guess if the date turns out well, I can never show him my blog.  hee! hee!  I have had some very sweet comments on my last dating disaster.  I know nice guys are out there!  I even think that the guy I'm going out with tonight is nice.  We'll see what happens.

      I just read Monica's response to Bill Clinton's new book "My Life".  She is upset about the way that Clinton described their affair.  She then told the British Press that "Clinton's book made her feel "like an insignificant piece of dirt." Well when you are having an affair with a married man, you often feel like a piece of dirt.    Maybe the new publicity will give her a forum, but a forum for what, whining?  Read for yourself and see what you think.  http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5295636/?GT1=3584  I try not to be judgmental.  I know that people make mistakes, and that although an affair is a bad thing to do, it does not make you a horrible person.  Bill Clinton did not "ruin" Monica's life.  Monica was not forced into the affair.  Any account of this affair will not show Ms. Lewinsky's good qualities.  In her defense, an affair with a man that powerful might be difficult to resist.    I hope that this ugly wrinkle in our history one day goes away, but in the meantime, take responsibility.  Say I did a bad thing and then "Suck it up"  Oh, I guess she already did!!!

      This past weekend, I just didn't have the energy to go through another internet match up.  I had discussed meeting one gentleman, I just had to put it off.  Too many bad dates in a row.  I just needed a break.  No pushy guys, no whiny guys.  I just needed to hang out with my friends!  I am not saying that I'm discouraged, or don't want to do this anymore, but just needed to back away.  This internet thing can be fun, but I think I might need to take a step back.  My friend told me that I should do one of the more involved sites like E-Harmony.  I am considering that too!  I'm also trying to get out more and meet people the old fashioned way,in person.  Let's see how that works.

      I started chatting with a guy from one of the personals sites and we decided to meet.  We went to a bar, and hung out for a bit.  As time went by the hints that the night should end shall we say at breakfast increased.  Not that this is not flattering, but I got the impression that if he were with any female, she would be getting the same "offer."    This guy told me how if he didn't like the profiles that he read, he would sent them rude messages.  The reason he didn't like the profiles was that he felt that the women put in too many expectations.  I guess he couldn't measure up.  The rude messages would be like hey, you wanna get laid and stuff like that.  I knew at that time, his match made in heaven wasn't me.  I told him that I realized that he was a "sure thing" but that I'd have to pass.  Made up some stuff about hope to see you again, and bolted.     I don't know that there is a moral to this story, just that there are people out there that don't have them.  It's not that this guy made clear what he wanted, just that I didn't expect such a bottom feeder.    I am looking forward to a new and better experience.

      I found  urlLink this article  on CNN that gives some incite on how to watch out for bad online dating experiences. Something I learned while reading this article is, men lie about being in a relationship, and women mostly lie about their looks. Some online dating sites want to offer a certified, dated photo on your profile.

      Good date We were heading from West Houston to a friend's house in Galveston. Julie needed to pick up a computer from her friend. We seemed to spend time in the truck quite a bit. We liked the time spent traveling together. We would talk while she drove. I cannot drive, so it is a good thing she enjoyed being the one behind the wheel. it was a beautiful day. The drive was nice. When we got to the friend's house we decided to go for a day at the Aquarium Restaurant. We made it down to the front and waited inside the lobby for a while. We were sitting down on a couch. Julie laid her head on my shoulder and fell asleep. We got that "cute couple" look from just about every one who walked by. When we were seated, we got a table right by the window overlooking the sea. It was a breezy day with a bright sun shining high. I don't remember what we had, but it was good. I remember looking at the stingray (I think it was a stingray) swimming up the glass. I remember looking at Julie and wanting so much to love her. When we left the restaurant, we went to a couple of shops then we went to some one's house and hung out for a while. Julie and I broke up a couple of years ago. When I think of Julie, I remember her smile that day.

      Slug boy got kicked to the curb again last night.&nbsp;  I had a semi-bad day and was going to skip swimming (maybe).&nbsp; Charles came over like 10 minutes after I got home without calling, empty handed except for the Sonic cup he was drinking (where the hell is mine).&nbsp; Aside from a hug and kiss when he came in (initiated by me of course), no other affection was shown and I really didn't know what the hell he was doing there.&nbsp;  He asked what I was doing and I said I had just got home and was watching&nbsp;Green Acres.&nbsp;&nbsp;Duh, I'm&nbsp;still in a suit and the TV is on.&nbsp; He didn't say anything else so I went back to the couch and he followed, sitting a few feet away.  No hand holding, no kissing, nada.&nbsp; He would just ask every few minutes what I was doing.&nbsp; (Duh!!)  I finally asked why he was there and he said I had a bad day so he came over.&nbsp; (And????&nbsp; Did he offer a massage, going out to dinner, anything????).  I was bored.&nbsp; I definitely wasn't going to entertain him.&nbsp; Apparetnly that's what's expected.  He fell asleep.&nbsp; I got up and did laundry and the dishes. him snoring the whole time.&nbsp;  I finally went over, kicked him awake and told him he needed to go.   Haven't heard anything.&nbsp; definitely not calling him.&nbsp; Will he contact me?&nbsp; Do I care?  Let the wagering begin!

      Throughout the past couple of weeks, I've been pondering the question of what exactly is love -- does anyone know?   (I'm just talking about romantic love, not family or platonic love.)   Of course, the question arose because I'm dating someone new, but also things have been happening to people I know that contrast each other and have weird timings.   Two weeks ago, one friend that is in a rather idyllic relationship for the past two years (July 2002) with a real sweetheart mentioned not&nbsp;having a shiny bobble on her left hand.&nbsp; (Note: she wasn't complaining, just mentioning as part of another conversation.)&nbsp; These two really do seem "perfect" for each other.&nbsp; In the past two years, both have really grown as individuals and at the same time grown as a couple.&nbsp; Pretty awesome.&nbsp; Yet still a naked third finger.   The next day I went to lunch with a&nbsp;friend that has barely known&nbsp;her husband for two years.&nbsp; They met in February/March 2002, dated 6 months (he's a pilot, so has a weird travel schedule), he got sent to Kuwait for 6 months with the Army Reserves but 1/2 way through came back and they got married (October 2002).&nbsp; So in Feb/Mar 2003, about a year after they first met, her husband returned.   What a contrast.&nbsp; Not that one relationship is better or stronger than the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's just odd how two different relationships move at such drastically different paces.&nbsp; I hadn't thought about it before, but the timing of the two conversations made the timing differences stand out.   I would definitely say the love is there between&nbsp;both couples.&nbsp; But that takes me back to the question of what is love......   Background info on my neighbors -- they've been living together for a year.&nbsp; The guy in the relationship has been more the guiding force in the relationship.&nbsp; He was the one that wanted them to move in, he's been the one talking marriage and&nbsp;asking about different ring styles, etc.&nbsp; She defiantly reciprocates the emotion.&nbsp;&nbsp;They had know each other for years before the relationship developed and it seemed very strong.&nbsp;  Last week, she came by to tell me they were moving.&nbsp; The prior Sunday he confessed that he had been seeing someone else since February.&nbsp; She said he came home from work (a paramedic/fireman) kissed her and said he loved her and took a nap and when he got up told her it was over.&nbsp; He said he wanted it to work and that's why he wanted them to get a dog together (so they would be a family), but decided he would rather be on his own.  Damn.   When I went back to work I was e-mailing with a former co-worker who has been married for TWELVE years and has for kids (but seems like it's nothing to have that many kids, she seems like a kid herself), who said she's leaving her husband.&nbsp; He knows and they are still living together while she saves money to get her own place.&nbsp; Once she does, they'll each take two kids and keep trading off (she laughed too).&nbsp; The kids are like 10, 8, 5 and 2 (the 2 y.o. was after a tubal ligation).&nbsp; She said it had been coming on for 8 years.&nbsp; She loves him, but not in that way.&nbsp; That seemed like a tight relationship.&nbsp; I remember one time he came to pick her up at work and we were talking about him running off with someone famous (can't remember who) and he said he's rather keep his wife and wouldn't want to trade her for anyone else.&nbsp; He didn't say it in a sappy way, but a content, happy way.&nbsp; Every now and then they would do super sweet things for each other -- little gifts, flowers, etc. That made it seem like a really awesome relationship.&nbsp; And now it's ending.....   I guess there is no guarantees in the world.&nbsp; And feelings/emotions change.&nbsp; So what's the point?    In Steel Magnolias, when Shelby was talking about her illness she said "I'd&nbsp;rather have 15 minutes of wonderful than a whole lifetime of nothing special."&nbsp;  She's got a point there....   A former co-worker that was in her late 30s and not married had the attitude of "I'd rather never be married than be divorced."  She's got a point there.....

Oh I don't know    what can I do    what else can I say    it's up to you    I know we're one    just me and you    I can't go on&nbsp;     &nbsp;   (chorus x2)&nbsp;     &nbsp;   uoh oh..What is love    What is love    What is love    Baby don't hurt me    Don't hurt me    no more     &nbsp;   Don't hurt me    Don't hurt me&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I want no other    No other love    This is your life    our time    When we are together    I need you forever     &nbsp;   Is it love&nbsp;     &nbsp;   (chorus x2)&nbsp;     &nbsp;   uoh oh..&nbsp;     &nbsp;   (chorus x2)&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Baby don't hurt me    Don't hurt me    no more     &nbsp;   Baby don't hurt me    Don't hurt me    no more     &nbsp;   Baby don't hurt me    Don't hurt me    no more     &nbsp;   Baby don't hurt me    Don't hurt me    no more     &nbsp;    what is love?!...  &nbsp;

      Howdy happy and adoring fans~  &nbsp;  I recently wrote a series of e-mails updating friends on my adventures going out with someone I met through 8 minute dating.&nbsp; The updates were quite long and one was rather risque. I would be more than happy to e-mail the entire text at your request, but in the interest of saving time, space and some electrons I'll just post the brief synopsis included at the beginning of each update:  &nbsp;  #1  "Anna Finally Goes on a Date"  The short version: Yea!  It was a good date. Not quite sure when it's going, but definitely worth pursuing. In fact, pursuit continued at lunch and will tonight also.....  &nbsp;  #2  "Anna Finally Goes on a Date AND is Actually Still Seeing Him a Week Later"&nbsp;  The short version:  I almost ditched him earlier in the week, but I didn't and am now starting to look forward to spending time with him.  &nbsp;  #3  "Anna Finally Goes on a Date and Yeah, He's Still Around Here Somewhere"  The short version:  I guess now he should be classified as a boyfriend. Whatever.  &nbsp;  I never got around to writing a #4, but in summary I'm kinda sick of the&nbsp;lazy-ass slug boy, but regular sex is nice so I may continue to keep him around.  &nbsp;  My future bitching on this site will probably revolve around this relationship, so please make yourself familiar with the situation....  &nbsp;  Wahoo!  Anna

      Ouch!&nbsp;&nbsp; My arm has finally been twisted enough to break into the world of bloggers.&nbsp; I don't see myself posting enough to maintain a fan base of happy, adoring fans but Angie has been kind enough to grant me priviledges here.  &nbsp;  Most of my posts will probably center around the trials and tribulations of dating someone new.&nbsp; I've been seeing him an entire month and in Annaville, that's about 3 weeks too long.&nbsp; But to make an attempt at keeping&nbsp;happy, adoring fans I'll keep him around a while longer to entertain y'all.  &nbsp;  Be prepared for the first three posts that will be made shortly.&nbsp; It's a cut and paste from some e-mails that went out regarding the first month with the aforementioned dude-de-jour.&nbsp;&nbsp; I blew a couple of people away with my candor in post #2, so I'll try to keep comments more PG in future posts.&nbsp; Must keep the fans happy and adoring......  &nbsp;  Wahoo!

      I was with a group of people last night debating whether or not the United States actually went to the moon.&nbsp; To be honest I never really thought about it.&nbsp; When asked if I thought we had ever gone to the moon, I, without hesitation replied that I believe we went to the moon.&nbsp; I am not naive, I know that many events in our history did not occur exactly the way that our history books said they did.&nbsp; I know that it really wasn't the tooth fairy that left money under my pillow.&nbsp; I don't think that our government, even if they wanted to, faked us out and staged the moon landing.  &nbsp;  This is a link to the article that refutes the hoax claims on the NASA website: urlLink http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/News/2001/News-MoonLanding.asp &nbsp;  I am only looking at one side of this issue today.&nbsp; Please let me know what you think!

Michael Barrett "Bachelors and Bachelorettes" - dating  and sex&nbsp;   If you'll be meeting us at St. Cyrils (10501 Westheimer Rd @ beltway  8),  I'm looking for someone willing to take 2-3 passengers back to the carpool  site at St. B's after the event.

      This question is just as annoying as "Why are you still single?" - if not more so.   Translation:  You've been dating your boyfriend for a while.  You talk about him a lot.  Shut up and make it official.   The big problem with this is that people ask the woman in the relationship.  If she doesn't have a ring on her finger, chances are that she doesn't know either!  I have been asked this question three times today.  Is it because I talked about my boyfriend or brought it up in any way?  No.  All three came from people I haven't talked to in a long time who wanted to make conversation.  I graciously referred all three of them to my boyfriend if they really want to know.  I should be used to it, after getting the question all the time, but I'm not.  At first, I thought it was a sign that someone cared and was interested in how I was doing.  Now, I feel a bit insulted when people ask.  I don't know why.  It must be my own fault; I have pictures of us together on my desk, many times I answer the "What did you do this weekend?" question with talk about what we did together.  Perhaps people think that having a boyfriend is all I have going on in my life.  On the other hand, between school, Toastmasters, and work, I know I don't give off that impression, either.    I wonder if he gets the question as often as I do.  Chances are, no.  Why do people ask this, when they clearly know the answer?  Any thoughts?  Thanks for letting me rant.

      I was watching  Live With Regis and Kelly  this morning and saw the new 1 million dollar winner.  What a great thing, but this define who he is?  No, but a statement he made on the show did.  He told Regis and Kelly that he has received many letters of encouragement during this process, and told about one in particular.  A girl wrote him and said that she was considering dropping out of high school, but something about his success on the show made her change her mind.  There is nothing sensational about this guy.  No headlines about him saving a baby from a burning building or other acts that are generally considered heroic, but something about him helped somebody choose the right path.  I don't think that this girl thinks that graduating from high school will ensure her fifteen minutes of fame like Jennings, but who he is, made her want the best for herself.    I know this isn't with the my normal blog theme, but I was inspired by this story and wanted to share.    Remember to be the good person you are, and good things can come from that.  I think that Jennings place on Jeopardy is not to win a million, that's just a bonus.  He is there to provide a good example, maybe just for that one person.

      I am currently in a training program for the Houston Marathon.  Yes, I am gearing up for the big event in January.  I wont be training alone.  I'm working with Houston Fit you can find them  urlLink here.    This seems to be a positive way to meet people.  I signed up this past weekend and they are taking registrations through next Saturday.   If nothing else, what a confidence builder.  At the end of this program I will be able to say that I can complete a marathon.  Cool!

      I just read the following and would like to know your take on this.   Dear Rachel, I am so tired of being asked why I’m still single! I am 42 years old, and would love to meet someone special. It’s hard enough for me not to get discouraged about dating without everyone asking me about it, as if there is some deep, dark secret to my plight. From my parents, to my co-workers, to my hairstylist, to my dentist, I am constantly asked this question. How can I answer without sounding annoyed, defensive, or depressed? (All of which I am actually feeling, by the way!)  — Bridget in New Hampshire  Dear Bridget, Ah, the eternally annoying question! It should be illegal in 50 states to ask that question, don’t you think? It ranks up there with asking a woman “When is the baby due?” when she’s not actually pregnant.   First of all, don’t assume that someone is asking “Why are you single?” because he or she is looking for your faults, but rather always tell yourself that the question is really meant to imply, “You’re so fantastic! I can’t believe a great guy hasn’t snapped you up yet!” Edit your perception of the question first.   Then you need to answer the question directly with this single sentence: “I just haven’t met the right person yet.” This is a complete sentence. There is no “because…” that trails off the end here. This is not the time to divulge all your issues, quirks, and broken romances.   No matter who asks you, and how annoyed you really are inside, remember to always make lemonade out of lemons. Instead of acting irritated, use this opportunity to probe whether the questioner has someone wonderful to introduce to you. You are speaking to someone who is likely to have a single brother, cousin, neighbor, college roommate, or co-worker, so you need to convey an upbeat, lovely impression of yourself. Who knows what may ensue during the course of a conversation about you being single?    This is my take on the whole thing.  I think you shouldn't "make lemonade out of lemons".  I think you should be real.  People who have no business asking that question ask it.  I've been asked at family gatherings in front of several people.  I agree you shouldn't have a fit because people ask you this, but it is a good idea to let them know that the questioning makes you feel bad.  Be nice, but be real.    What's your take?

       6 billion people are on Earth at the moment.  At least, thats what I heard, somewhere.   3 billion of them are women , roughly.   1 billion are about the right age.  18 to say 45 or so. It's funny that the 18 will never go up. I'm not so sure about the 45.   500 million are healthy.  Drug attics, starving, disease, ... I wonder if this number should be much, much smaller. With the international AIDS epidemic, I bet the number is smaller.   250 million are of the right level of looks . Lets face it, I'm week I cannot fool myself into thinking that I&nbsp; will find just any one attractive. Also, a very pretty woman is out of my league. She would just leave me. =[   20 million are not involved at the moment.  These are good catches so far. Healthy, cute, of proper age, that's a formula for success.   40 thousand are in the U. S.  The U. S. has about 2% of the world's population. Yet, we use 40% of the worlds energy. I bet that is an old number. I've heard China is about to take over as the fastest growing energy consumer.   2 thousand are in the great state of Texas.  I'm guessing 5% of the U. S. population live in Texas. I don't care if that pretty far off. It gets the point across.   1 thousand will eventually be in the same city as I.  I don't travel much. Hopefully these women do. Optimistically, about half of the women and I will be in the same city at the same time I suppose.   50 of these near perfect matches I will meet.  I don't get out much. I suppose I will only actually run into a precious few of the women who have met the above criteria. I define running into as "hi." ... "hi."   10 women will notice me, and I will notice them.  Ah, this is the one that almost counts. This is where our eyes meet. Our breath grows short. The world stops just for us. That is not love. There is more to it.   1 woman and I will fall in love.

      I thought that this article (see link below) made a lot of sense.  You can use this etiquette advice with you potential dates, or your regular IAM friends.  The key to etiquette is being sensitive and putting yourself in the shoes of others.  So many times I'll tell somebody that I'm busy, or have somebody at my desk.  They keep sending me messages.    Do you have any other IAM advice?  http://msn.match.com/msn/article.aspx?articleid=2389&TrackingID=516164&BannerID=541888

      I've heard stories about parents at little league games, but this one was so dissappointing!  I think that Clemens could have definately provided a better example for parents.  Clemens asked to leave after arguing call Story  --> Houston  Astros  pitcher  Roger Clemens  was asked to leave a youth baseball game over the weekend for arguing a close call that went against his son's team. Photo gallery urlLink Week in baseball   urlLink   Clemens was at the game Saturday watching his son, Kacy, compete in a 10-and-under game organized by Triple Crown Sports when Clemens contested a call at second base that went against the Katy Cowboys. He spit sunflower seeds at an umpire's leg and was asked to leave, said Jim Carpenter, a field supervisor with Triple Crown. "I supported the umpire's decision and he (Clemens) respectfully left," Carpenter told the Craig Daily Press. Katy lost the game to the Bakersfield Curve, 11-5. Triple Crown Sports features a franchise system aimed at pitting top teams from across the country against each other. Clemens' agent, Randall Hendricks, did not immediately return a call Monday. Clemens has racked up 322 wins and 4,240 strikeouts in his 21-year major league career.

      Slug boy slithered back in.  He called Friday asking me to dinner.  I had already planned to meet Wyatt at Brian O’Neill’s.  Slug boy came along.  Whatever. On Saturday after scuba, I was ravenous.  Slug came over to go with me to Tacqueria la Tapetia (which is not as good now that they’re in the fancy new digs).  Then he was stuck running errands with me all day – back over to my place to take my car in to get inspected and the oil changed then back over to the scuba store to get the tanks refilled and for me to get a skin suit, then back over to pick up my car, then back over to Academy and the dollar store, the back to pick up a prescription.  We didn’t plan well, so ½ the stuff was by me and the other ½ was in the Westheimer/Shephard area.  Anyway – the point of all this is that running errands is more bearable when someone else is along.   Especially when it’s a slug boy that knows he’s about to have a ton of salt poured on top of him.   I don’t usually do relationships.  So I figure slug boy is a good practice relationship until the real guy comes along.
