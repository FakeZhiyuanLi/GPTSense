      Que difícil se me hace  mantenerme en este viaje  sin saber a donde voy  en realidad.  Si es de ida o de vuelta,  si el furgón es la primera,  si volver es una forma  de llegar...   How difficult it is to advance not really knowing where I'm going. if I'm going or returning, if I'm on first class or last class, if returning is a way to arrive.  Que difícil se me hace  cargar todo este equipaje,  se hace dura la subida  al caminar.  Esta realidad tirana  que se ríe a carcajadas  porque espera que me canse  de buscar...  How difficult it is to me to keep on draggin all this bagagge, up the hill. This tyrant reality that laughing at me, wanting me to  stop looking...  Cada nota, cada idea,  cada paso en mi carrera  y la estrofa de mi ultima cancion.  Cada fecha postergada  la salida y la llegada  y el oxigeno de mi respiracion.  Y todo a pulmon,  todo a pulmon.   Each note, each idea, each step in my carreer and the lyrics of my last song. Each posponed date Leaving or arriving and the oxygen in my breath. With all my breath. All my breath.  Que difícil se me hace  mantenerme con coraje  lejos de la tranza y la prostitucion.  Defender mi ideología  buena o mala pero mía,  tan humana como la contradicción.   How difficult it is to have courage away from selling out and  prostitution. To defend my ideology good or bad but mine, so human like contradiction.  Que difícil se me hace  seguir pagando el peaje  de esta ruta de locura y ambición.  Un amigo en la carrera  una luz, una escalera  y la fuerza de hacer todo a pulmón.  Cada nota, cada idea...   How difficult it is to keep on paying tolls in this road of crazines and ambition. A friend in the race a light, a ladder and the strength to do everything with all my breath.

      Over the past few weeks, ever since we came back from our honeymoon, "how is married life so far?" seems to be the question I get asked the most.  "So far so good." comes naturally as my standard answer. Yet a bit of reflection makes me understand that this is not just a simple cliché comical commentary on the current situation of marriages in the country. This answer has slowly been brewed over years by watching other couples get together, split or sometimes live happily together. The cruel reality of our time.  Yet the cold uncertainty suggested by such an answer is a constant reminder that, in the words of uncle Cesar, relationships work only as good as the work we put on them. Our marriage is “so far so good” not because an inevitable malady has not yet arrived but because we have worked hard, so far, to make it be “good”.  As we move into our second month of marriage all I can hope is that the word ”we”, will keep on creeping into my writing so that the "so far so good" answer keep on comming, naturally, making people smile as the years go by.

      Isn't it funny? Just when you have figured out how to be a toddler you become a kid, when you know how to be a kid you become a teen and when you have the teen-thing perfected you become a young adult. Of course once you have managed to learn how to be single you marry. But the most disturbing thing is that just when you have managed to love your job you find out you need to move on.
