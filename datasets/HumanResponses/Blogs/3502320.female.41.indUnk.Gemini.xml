      This blogging is a new thing for me, although writing is not.  I am blogging out of a need to expel my creativity from myself and share it with others, and my horoscope told me to "Take a chance at creating something in an old or new medium," so here I am, creating something in a new medium.  I like to be able to say what I want to, about things that I don't like, things that I like, and to be able to share thoughts, ideas,my life and opinions with others, and these days blogging seems to be the way to do that.    So, here I am, trying my hand at sharing everything I can think of with everyone that is interested, read on and enjoy, or not! I really just want to write, write, write, and hope to do at least some every day.   Catcha later! Critter Keeper

      Have you ever noticed how many people use terms of endearment, just out of habit?  Personally, I don't use any terms of endearment, even with my own family.  I don't call my husband "dear" or "honey", and I don't call my children "sweetheart" or "sugar" or anything else that comes to mind.    I work at a long term care facility, and everyone I work with has their own special names that they call the folks they work with, residents and staff alike.  I have found during my long stay at the facility where I work that the residents don't always like to be called "hon" or "sweetie" or even "dear". But, people continue to call them just that. There are a lot of pet names out there, and frankly I think that it really makes people uncomfortable when others don't call them what they like to be called.  And it makes people uncomfortable when others assume that they should accept it when they use terms of endearment.   I do know that it makes me uncomfortable when I go to Church and instead of addressing me as my own real name, people call me "honey" and "dear" and "sugar" and "sweetheart", when I feel that these people don't know me well enough to assume that those names are what I want to be called.    So then, the big question would be, why does it make me uncomfortable? and maybe I should be asking why don't I use terms of endearment myself??  The answer to that would be: I really don't know. I just know that I don't assign names to anyone, and it makes me uncomfortable when people assign names other than my own to me. Perhaps someone out there might know what could be the reasons.

      So here I am, listening to my neighbor's son's band, jamming in their garage, and watching Monsters,Inc., and blogging right along.  And the question of this day is....... Catnip? Is it the drug of choice for your cats, or do you, like a few others think that we shouldn't be drugging our kitties??  I give my cat(the monster Worf) catnip so he will stay quiet and not bother my other cat (Abby), and so that the house can rest from his antics. Abby on the other hand does not get catnip because she goes in heat which really bothers the little man cat Worf.  He then chases noisy Abby around and makes a lot of noise himself.  They both like to roll in it when I rub it on toys and on the carpet.  And Worf tends to slobber a lot when he eats the fresh catnip. I consider it a drug, and it is an herb, like marijuana, but I don't think the local law enforcement would approve of me growing the latter herb in my yard.( I will admit that I like the smell of marijuana, and it would make a wonderful incense.)But alas, it is still an illegal herb, and I really don't need the trouble that would go along with growing it, and using it.  Meanwhile, and back to the catnip, I can grow that legally, even though it is a drug for my cats, and I myself have been known to eat a leaf to relieve the occasional stomach ache (and it does the trick for me) with the added side effect of causing me a bit of drowsiness, so if I really needed it I suppose I could use it to help me to sleep at night, which is an ongoing problem (not sleeping). I think this year, besides drying it for the kitties, I will be drying some for tea, to relieve my stomach when it is being unruly.  And another question...Since marijuana is a drug, is catnip a drug too??

      some things that people do that really peeve me:  Tell me something that they think I should know, but I don't, and act like I am the idiot because I didn't know it Tell me something that I do know that doesn't bear repeating Tell me something that I don't know, but don't want to know Tell me something that they know that is none of my business Think that they are God's Gift to Mankind Act like they think they are GGtoM Think that I give a rat's patootie about their financial problems, when I have more than my share of my own Tell people that they shouldn't be telling personal problems that 1st person couldn't do a thing about Subject me or others to their own preferences, without maybe taking a moment to consult for an opinion 35-40 year old women who sit at work and act like 13 year old boys, making obsene noises and laughing about it (immature to the max) People that don't do their work, slough it off on others then can't understand why people don't like them, and can't understand why they never accomplish anything worth while People that dress inappropriately for their work, or for the places they go Inappropriate displays of affection in public (remember there are children out there and we wouldn't want our own children seeing other people doing those things) People that don't teach their children values, hobbies and how to respect other people and their property People that think it is cute to teach their children to cuss (we're really teaching them to use their english properly) Asking the elderly for financial help, when most of the elderly have enough of their own financial problems Mistreating other people, and animals People that live where it is cold, by choice and constantly whine and complain about the cold People that jump to conclusions People that interrupt conversations just to hear themselves People that think they have to compete with everyone for the most friends, you know, he who has the most friends wins People that think the whole day at work is just a competition People that think they have to control all situations People that can't work together as a team, by puttins aside problems People that bring home to work, and the attitudes they get from things that happen at home People with a bad attitude People that never smile and finally People that whine about anything and everything  Well, I gotta go!  Well then, that was a list worth writing, at least to me!

      so,what do I think about...... about food, and why I eat or don't eat what   I can eat pork liver, but not beef liver because it smells pissy to my. I realize that liver can't be the best anyhow because it is the body's filter, and organ meat isn't good for your heart.  I don't like the smell of eggs and ketchup together. My husband likes to eat scrambled eggs with ketchup on them, yucky!  I can eat ketchup, but it is not my favorite thing.  Peanut butter and bologna sandwiches just don't taste right, and peanut butter and dill pickles aren't too great either.  I love to eat bread with peanut butter along with a bowl of chili, and I do know some other people who like the same.  Things with a lot of vinegar give me heartburn  Miracle whip is not mayonnaise.  Really rich and sweet stuff turns my stomach, I think it is in fact the richness of it and not the sweetness.  I know someone that won't eat anything that doesn't "look good", I eat most things, looking good or not, and I never refuse free food.  I also know someone that won't eat mushrooms because they grow in manure, if she only knew how many things are grown in manure, she would probably starve to death. I believe she drinks, and most things with alcohol are the result of yeast eating the sugars, the alcohol is like the yeast's excrement, a by product of the yeast (little living creatures) after it has digested the sugars, it's waste, so to speak.  Personally I am game to try anything, once. If I don't like it, then I may not eat it again.  I did try head cheese, and didn't like it, something about the texture, I gave it to my cat and he didn't like it either. Later in life I worked in a deli, and used to slice head cheese, did you know that because of the rubbery texture it actually squeals on the slicer. And it smells bad.  I had a customer how she wanted the head cheese sliced, once upon a time, she said about an inch thick, so I had to ask her how she could eat it, she said she liked it with lots of salt.    And I don't eat salt on much of anything, because I feel that you can't taste what you are eating if you use salt.    Eggs are great with a soft yolk, a little bit of "snot", (unofficially still clear albumen), along side toast (almost burnt) with butter and a lot of crispy bacon.  I do think that anything, if prepared right is good, and I will eat anything that is tasty. I really prefer things that aren't sweet, I like meats, vegetables, breads, cereals, anything to drink, chocolate, and fruits.  so what do you like??? input would be appreciated.............
