      Thanks to everyone who joined us for our red hot and pink party and helped make it so much fun. Special thanks to Katja for helping in the kitchen, and Dani and Fred too. Also to all the early birds who mucked in at the start of the party helping me with the last minute details: Di and Greg, Daniel and Katherine, Mike, Brian, Clowdy and Tommy. Thanks also to our doorman Peter.  Thanks to everyone who gave me gifts. Thierry and Tonia for the Zubrowka, Annick for the Veuve, Olivier and Natasha for the Perrier Jouet, Hans for the fancy dessert wine, Katja for the cyclamen, pot and Palomino voucher, Di for the stunning earrings and pink t-shirt, Penny for the Tales of the City and Olive Oil Sprayer, Sylvain and Delphine for the really neat Alessi memory container, Dani for the scrummy books, MaryBeth and Dave for the gorgeous pink beaded glass necklace, Michael and Tony for the perfectest fluffy pink cushion, I am not sure who exactly but somewhere between Greg, Kim, Ian, Dave and Ali I received the cutest little cool japanese-style pink teddy bear and  a gingerbread man bath salt thingy, Amaury for the Tagadas, my mum for the glamorous red and pink dress and last but not least, Fred for the Mini iPod, car tuner and trip to Chez Papa for dinner. I hope I didn't miss anyone out.  Thanks to Jodie and Hang for gathering everyone together at midnight to sing Happy Birthday to me. I don't think I have ever had so many people sing for me at one time  before. I was overwhelmed.  But most of all thanks to  all of you  who came and bought us lots of booze, and made it such a great night. See you at the next one!    urlLink  Click here to see the Red Hot Pink Menu from Saturday Night   Pictures follow...

       urlLink    For our last photography assignment Allison asked us to photograph light as the subject. Basically, "painting with light". I did some experimenting and settled on the above image as my favourite. Below are two other interesting images that resulted from my playing with light-centric ideas.

      For Lesson 4: We had to shoot a whole reel of film using only one inanimate object as our subject. We had to try and transofrm our subject so that we were looking at in a way that was different to how we'd normally see it. The photographs were required to be taken outside, in one session and in black and white. I chose to photograph the antenna on the roof. These pictures were taken at around midday.

       urlLink    Lesson 3: I was required to show maximum depth of field (where everything is in focus). To achieve this, a small aperture and longer exposure were needed.Because the shutter was open for longer, moving objects in the scene (the balloons) ended up blurred, resulting in 'show motion' at the same time.

      The company I work for have been kind enough to organise 6-week photography courses for staff. The course was very popular and I had to go on a waiting list. I eventually made it to the front of the queue and am now over half way through the course which is taught by  urlLink Allison Petit . I did learn photgraphy at college nearly 20 years ago but since the advent of digital I have spent more time taking snaps than photographs, so the opportunity to go back to basics was much appreciated. For the course I borrowed an SLR (Nikon) and had to relearn about light meatering, exposure, aperture, depth of field and a whole list of other technical information, all over again.

       Sunday May 30th 2004   Yesterday we celebrated the birthday of our good friend Vinny who decided he wanted to mark the special occasion with a trip to bet on the horsies. This led to us driving about 30 minutes South on the 101 in the direction of race track  urlLink  Bay Meadows.    This is a great day out! It only costs $3 to get in (plus $4 per car for parking). Betting starts with bets as low as just $2. In the few hours we were there we went from being completely lost with absolutely no idea what to do, to avidly reading the betting papers, dashing down to view the horses and putting increasingly exotic bets on our favourites. By the time it came to the last race (and with no lucky winners under my belt) I was finally confident that horses 5 and 1 were going to come in the top two places so I boxed an 'Exacta' bet on the pair of them for $4. Sure enough my chosen two did not let me down and I won $10.20. Since then I have been kicking myself that I didn't invest more on that last race.   urlLink See what Vinny baked us for dinner here

       Saturday May 29th 2004     urlLink check out the party pictures here   Last Saturday night we set out to celebrate the 40th Birthday of my second favourite Frenchman, Sylvain Doreau. We started out at Cafe Bastille on Belden Lane where we had a long outside table with about 20 people sitting down for dinner, including Sylvain's parents, visiting from France. As the sun slowly set we enjoyed good food, lively conversation and excellent wine. The meal was wonderful and we were well looked after by the restaurant's generous patron, Olivier, and Julie the patient and efficient waitress. Sylvain kindly suprised us by declaring l'addition had been taken care of. I was speechless:Merci  beaucoup  Sylvain!  The  urlLink Alessi  Decanter and glasses Fred and I bought Sylvain for his birthday present:     By 10pm our trolley bus was waiting for us at the end of the alley to take us on a 'club-crawl' of san francisco. The bus was equipped with a large bucket of ice, perfect for housing the many bottles of champagne we had bought with us for the journey. We boarded the bus and started pouring the bubbly. Everyone was in an excitable mood as we set off in the direction of China Basin. Passing SBC Park, the baseball park perced on the edge of the Bay, a huge firework display started over the water. It was apt timing... beautiful, sparkling explosions in honour of our Birthday Boy.  First stop was Sno Drift where we danced and drank a while and picked up some more passengers for the next stage of our bus ride. We jiggled through the streets of San Francisco, toasting, and screaming at anyone we saw on the street. Whilst some people, their expressions aghast, didn't quite know what to make of us, others responded with whistles, waves and cheers. After stopping at the Monkey Club, somewhere in the Mission and adding even more strangers to our entourage, we finally took the last part of our journey to Belden Alley for a night cap at Voda. Merci, encore, Sylvain pour la bonne fete! Joyeaux Anniversaire.

      Today we met up with the Bay Area S2k user group and went for a drive. We met in the Presidio, SF. There were about 25 S2ks. We drove to Tiburon and then along Paradise Drive where there was a nutter on the sidewalk bashing us with a stick and telling us to slow down even though we were only doing the speed limit. About 5 minutes later there was a crazy guy in an orange suit standing in the middle of the road telling us to slow down. We were only doing the speed limit so I dont know what he was talking about. I guess 25 cars of the same type with lots of revving going on upset him or something. We all met at Denny's for lunch. See my becksposhnosh blog for further details about the food at Dennys. After Dennys we deove up Mount Tam and down to Bolinas then along to Stinson and then back to SF. I was with 4 cars. 1 red (Tony), 1 white ('shift9k') and a black one which was a party. They were smoking cigars and they had a huge subwoofer in the trunk and a tv in the mirror. Yes! a TV in the mirror. I left them behind when we got back on the 101.

       Saturday May 15th 2004   F and I borrowed S's SUV to drive to San Jose which is 50 miles south of San Francisco. The reason for our journey down this grey, ugly stretch of the 101 that passes through Silicon Valley with its huge HiTech builings interspersed with strip malls lining each side of the road, was so that could pick up his 40th Birthday present to himself, a pair of JBL 4343 speakers circa 1976. They are so big they make our normally huge wide screen HDTV look small. F has been telling me how much he wanted a pair of speakers like this since I first met him 359 days ago. These speakers sell for thousands of dollars on Ebay and then you would usually have to add shipping charges on top of that. Considering that they weigh 175lbs each, you could end up spending a small fortune. He was lucky to find a pair, with all of the original components, in driving distance, and at a reasonable price. He told me, many times, that the sound that comes out of these speakers is incomparible with anything you would normally hear. I didnt really believe him until he plugged them in at home. The sound is so incredible it gives you goosebumps and your eyes well up with tears. F has wanted these speakers since he first heard them in France when he was 12 years old. Needless to say, after his almost 28 years of waiting, he is currently the happiest I have ever seen him. (Apart from when he met me, of course...)      The speakers  look totally cool in our loft!

A small tent was put up in the courtyard where pre-movie drinks and nibbles were served. A giant ice sculpture of the Statue of Liberty made an apt centrepiece for the spread which included tomato and basil bruschetta with fontina cheese, smoked salmon mousse profiteroles and meatballs in a delicious creamy mushroom sauce.        urlLink Visit The Day After Tomorrow

      Monday May 24th 2004, 8.30pm  Girls night out with D and P.  urlLink The Slow Club  is just about equidistant between our 3 homes in SoMa, Bernal Heights and China Basin. This Industrial-styled  bar/eaterie (which has nothing to do with 'clubbing' in case you were wondering) doesn't accept reservations so Monday is a convenient time to visit and acquire a table immediately.     The first couple of times the waitress visited our table we were so lost in the depths of catching up on news and gossip that we hadn't even glanced at a menu let alone chosen a drink. She declared she would start us off with water and shamed us into looking at the cocktail menu to make our beverage choices before she returned with the bottle of San Pelligrino.  Over the course of the evening we got into a little bit of confusion about the glasses of wine by the glass we were trying. The long of short of it was: Myself and D both like the Bordeaux, P and myself both liked the Pinot Noir. None of us liked the Shiraz and D didn't care much for the taster of Italian she tried. I can't remember it's name.  For an appetizer, we shared a flat bread. This turned out to be a crispy cheesey pizza-like concoction as large as a dinner plate. It was wickedly delicious and I was glad that we hadn't ordered more. We needed to reserve room for our entrees.  P and I both chose the pork chop. This huge chunk of pig leg was deliciously tender and moist served with steamed spinach, cherries and their reduction. On the side were two corn fritters which didn't live up to the rest of the dish. They were a little greasy and would have been improved by a little more corn and a lot less batter. Nevertheless, acting like the animal we were consuming, we both finished everything on our plates, not leaving a scrap. D took the healthier option of fish with white beans and beets. I think the fish was halibut, and it was certainly clean-tasting and tasty too - we know because D kindly let us both try it.   Flat bread $10 Entrees $15 -$18ish Wines $6-$8.50 Total $40 each plus tip.  How I updated the report of my visit to Zagat:  It'a great to have a quality, cool place in the 'hood where you know you can just drop in for absolutely delicious, well prepared and cooked food without having to make a reservation. Nothing about this place has ever disappointed me. Brunch and dinner are both equally desirable.

       Sunday May 23rd 2004   P, the manager of Cafe Bastille on Belden Lane, by chance of fate is also our neighbour. This makes us conveniently close enough for impromptu dinner party invitations. He and his roomate, A, the sophistically suave young real estate agent, called us up on Sunday and asked us over for dinner. Other guests included R (who appears to be 'dating' A) and S, a manager of two hotels in downtown, who was appointed chef for the evening. S is a Tunisian raised in Paris who decided to revisit his roots when making Sunday's meal. A large bowl of steaming couscous was served with a huge potful of some kind of tender chicken stew with vegetables and chickpeas in a thin spicy gravy. The meal was fulfilling and comforting with just the perfect balance of spices. My first taste of Tunisian food hopefully won't be my last.

D had been up until 4.30 am in the morning creating the most delicious and impressive assortment of exquisite canapes and petits fours. Little home-baked cheese biscuits and toasts topped with marinated salmon, some white bean puree (I think?), delicious scallops, or tiny tomatoes with feta and herbs. Huge plates of succulent spicy marinated chicken were also on offer. A dessert plate covered in a mix of sweet treats, coconut and raspberry jam cookies plus biscotti and brownies, all homemade, was just as tempting.  As the kids splashed in the pool and the adults quaffed french red wines, KO signed copies of her beautifully illustrated new book.     urlLink Buy One Here Now .

On our arrival, after being seated, we were pleasantly suprised when the waitress presented us with a glass each of complimentary champagne in celebration of the fact. It was a really thoughtful gesture - thank you Foreign Cinema.

      About 10 years ago I won a case of wine in a competition back in England. They have been sitting in my parents wine cellar ever since. Back then I was more interested in cheap wine than  good wine, but in the decade since then  my tastes have naturally matured to the point where I can envisage myself sharing a case of outstanding Margaux with my serious wine-loving friends. (that sure would be a lot of brownie points!). Unfortunately it is not possible to ship wines from the UK to the US without a licence which I don't have. Additionally I owe my mother a lot of money and selling the case would help me to pay off  the debt. Consequently, my father has been talking to one of his wine friends to see how interesting this case of wine is and how much we could realistically expect for it.     There are 12 wines dated 1978, 80, 81, 82, 83 84, 85, 86 87, 88, 89, and 90. They are all  urlLink Chateau Palmer Margaux  and each bottle is personally signed by  urlLink Peter Sichel  who I learnt, sadly, died a few years ago.      Here is the reply from my father's wine friend:    > >A fascinating case of wine and most certainly worth its £500 - probably >net of auctioneers charges! >The signature appears to be that of Peter N Sichel who was one of the >very first people in the wine trade that I met back in the late fifties >and who sadly died about 4-5 years ago. Curiously I was at the London >Wine Fair yesterday and spent ten minutes talking to Charles, one of his >four sons, who continue to run a successful Bordeaux wine merchants >called Sichel & Co. >The family have for over fifty years held a substantial share in Chateau >Palmer which is very much one of the leading chateaux in the region, >possibly second only to Chateau Margaux itself. >I am very much interested in this case of wine as I belong to a"wine >club" who may well be interested in purchasing it in order to hold a >vertical tasting of the twelve vintages.     He sounds very interested in my case of wine. Eager to snap it up, I'd say. I am worried that we might have valued it too low. I have found a website that shows  urlLink the starting prices of these wines  at auction. We have to bear in mind that mine is a complete set and each bottle is signed too, which makes it unique. I am going to go through these prices for each year and make sure we are not about to be ripped off. What do you think...?

      In April I read an  urlLink article  on SF Gate about some schoolkids who had started a cheese club. I thought it was a great idea so I wrote to the newspaper to see if I could help the kids out by making a donation. SF Gate put me in touch with Nathan Hillier who wrote this to me today to thank me for my contribution...   Dear Sam, Thank you very much for your donation to our club. It went towards some Boursin, Raclette, and Petit Basque for our presentation on French cheeses two weeks ago. In case you are interested,  we will be appearing on "Evening Magazine" on CBS (Channel 5 - KPIX in the Bay Area) on the 26th of May, and will also be featured on Unwrapped on the Food Network at a later date. We can only attribute our success to the strong support we have received from people like you and we are therefore endlessly grateful. Yours in Cheese, Nathan Hillier

       CPK loses favour      After the battering I have had from my office mates for dining at   California Pizza Kitchen   from time to time, F and I decided to try Pizza at another locale,  urlLink Amicis  in San Rafael. The pizza's at Amicis have a nice thin crust, good choice of toppings and, best of all, come in a mini 7" size which is a better choice for your wallet, your waistline and the environment.

       Thursday May 20th, with my girl friend MBH      MBH and I decided to visit  urlLink Vino E Cucina   mainly due to its close proximity (we both live within a few blocks from each other in SoMa). MB had already visited and declared it to be adequate food at decent prices. Pigishly, we couldn't resist an appetizer and opted to share a helping of Arancini which I hadn't seen on a menu since my London days. The little fried balls of risotto rice with mozarella were disappointing. The aborio were so sweet they tasted like rice pudding and the cheese didn't have enough pungency to beef up the blandness. Next!  I'd read about VeC's lasagne and as it contained some of my favourite ingredients (italian ham, gruyere and spinach), I chose it for my main course whilst MB requested the pizza special of the day, Cappriciosa, with a topping of artichokes. The lasagne was non-standard assembly, presented as 3 little pockets filled with the aforementioned ingredients. As such, the size of the dish was less daunting than I had anticipated. However, the deliciously wicked creamy cheese sauce on which the pasta was floating, soon threatened to close down my arteries. Ummmmm! Death by comfort food!  MB seemed to be enjoying her pizza, especially the crusts (a girl after my own heart). We'd shared half a bottle  of Bordeaux at MB's prior to dinner and after sharing a further bottle of Barbera during our meal, we were internally satisfied enough to wend our separate ways home for the night. As we left we looked up and saw a giant tomato impaled on the restaurant frontage but I am sure we hadn't had  that  much to drink...

       Pronto Pasta San Rafael   I often go to Pronto Pasta, close to my work, for lunch. The Italian chef owner is friendly and sometimes gives us free appetizers of cheese or ham. The food is generally very good but it can be hit or miss. Today was a  miss  day. I ordered a special: Homemade nettle fettucine with duck, goat cheese and mushrooms. The grass-green fettucine was perfectly cooked, al dente, without the nettles overpowering the flavour as I wondered if they might. The duck was so tender that it had the texture of jello rather than meat which caused me to be wary of it. There was no visual evidence of the goats cheese but I assume it was an ingredient of the watery sauce that was so overpowered by the inclusion of chillis that the flavour of the tomatoes, shitakes and the mushy duck was completely lost. A garnish of 'too salty' olives did nothing to improve or save the dish from miserable failure.

       Campaign for Eggs   I wrote to the journalist who wrote the Ferry Building article I linked to in my previous post to let her know that none of the stores there sell eggs. I was suggesting we start a campaign for the sale of eggs there. She agreed. It's no good trying to do your weekly shop at the Ferry Building  if you have to go all the way to Wholefoods afterwards just to buy half a dozen eggs.     here is the email Karola Crabb, the journalist wrote me:   You are right - I don't recall seeing eggs, except outside on Saturday. Can't remember the name, but in back - on the pier - there was a stand that sells eggs. I'll forward your message to the people who do publicity for the market and who work closely with CUESA. - k

       One of my weekday breakfast ingredients      There are some schools of thought which say eating 3 portions of dairy a day can  urlLink  aid weight loss  . Whether you believe this or not, it's not a bad idea to make sure you get enough of the calcium that is provided by dairy products into your daily diet. With this in mind, I try to eat a yoghurt every day. I generally dislike all yoghurt except for Greek Yoghurt. Luckily this is now available in the US (it wasn't when I arrived 3.5 years ago). My fridge is full of  urlLink  Total 0% Greek Yoghurt  which I buy from  urlLink Wholefoods.  I buy it in in bulk (12 or so pots at a time) because they often run out in the store. This is ok because the use by dates are normally about a month away. I think it is only about 80 calories for the pot.  Greek yoghurt is also perfect for use in cooking. Why? Because unlike other yoghurts,  it doesn't curdle and it's thick and creamy and delicious without that sour yoghurt taste.  A savoury idea for greek yoghurt is to mix it, cold, with some chopped green chilli, grated lemon zest and some deskinned cucumber slices (that have been covered in salt and left to drain first to get rid of the excess water - pat off the salt before use). This makes a great topping for hot pan-fried chicken. [thanks to Nigella Lawson  and  urlLink  How to Eat   for that idea which  is just from memory and may not be exact as I left that book in my mum's attic in England]

       Tuesday May 18th 2004   In English English: Egg Sandwich or Egg mayonnaise In American English: Egg salad sandwich.  Hard boil 3 x organic brown eggs. Drain the hot water from the pan and plunge the just-cooked eggs under plenty of cold running water until they cool down. This will make them easier to peel,  stop them from cooking further and stop the yellows from going black around the edges. Peel off the shells (Do this underwater - it makes them more slippery and helps the shells ease off). Pat the shellless eggs dry with some kitchen roll, then place in a bowl with a big dollop of mayonnaise. Season liberally with  urlLink New Maldon Sea Salt  and plenty of freshly ground black pepper and mash until the desired consistency. F suggested I add some praprika, which I did on this occasion. It gave them a pretty orange colour and a little added flavour too. We ate it for lunch, on Pain au Levain bread.  I like to serve them with plain, salted crisps (potato chips)  In England we would skip the paprika and garnish the sandwich with 'mustard and cress' which is impossible to buy in America. I miss it - i wish I could get it here. It looks like the green stuff in  urlLink  this picture    Here is a classic english recipe for  urlLink  mustard and cress sandwiches       urlLink Schoolchildren in Britain learn about life by growing mustard and cress from an early age.

       Monday May 17th 2004    urlLink Wholefoods  is the most expensive food shop in the area (apart, maybe from Andronicas). People round here refer to it jokingly as "WholePayCheck". I went there last night to buy practically nothing and left the store $87 lighter. Wholefoods has a section where you can buy ready-cooked foods to eat in the cafe or take home. Because of the hoards of customers buzzing around them, it is always difficult to get to the coveted vegetable samosas. These warm, crisp, spicy, curried parcels of delight are the most popular item in the store. I took a boxful home for F, who is particularly fond of them. I served them with the antithesis in salad. Insalata Tricolore, in the colours of the Italian flag: fresh organic tomatoes (which are beginning to taste alright, at last, now summer is arriving), fresh mozzarella cheese and avocado dressed with fresh basil. olive oil, sherry vinegar and seasoning. Very fresh, healthy and delicious served with a little Levain bread.

The food certainly made up for what was lacking at Denny's. Oh yes.

       Sunday May 16th 2004   I told F I have some bad news: "The meeting place for lunch (on our S2K drive) has changed, it's going to be Denny's in Corte Madera". He didnt mind, though cos he'd never been to Denny's before. We sat at the Denny's bar (where NO alcohol is served) next to Charlie from our S2K run who had earlier been really nice and given us all (40+ people) a really cool key chain. Each. Charlie fell asleep at the formica table. I nervously anticipated the food. I don't know how F was feeling. He ordered a burger, figuring that no one can mess up a burger. Oh, he'd never been to Denny's before! I dont know what I ordered. Some chicken fajitas thing. It was repulsive. You can taste the BAD oil they use on every morsel of food. I dont like green peppers. Ususally I dont eat them if they are in a dish I order. Get this: at Denny's I was pcking out the green peppers fom my dish and eating them because they were the only part of the dish that was edible. I checked out  urlLink  Denny's web page   and realised, later, that I'd been robbed. They were meant to serve my skillet with salsa. I am sure it would've tasted much much better if drowned in a fresh, grease-cutting spicy sauce.     urlLink Make Denny's Chicken Fajita Breakfast Skillet in the comfort of your own home

      Last weekend, when F was stocking up on his obligatory 4 bottles of Perrier at a local corner shop, I spotted a bottle of Hildon mineral water that remined me of fancy restaurants back home. As F was paying, I snuck a bottle into his basket (I don't think he realised it was about twice the price of the bulles Francais). I kept the bottle hidden in the fridge for a whole week waiting for the moment when i could enjoy it at my leisure.  I like the bottle. It is simple and clean and the label reminds me of  a private hospital in the 20's or 30s - you know the kind of place that was in a huge country estate where all the nurses wore long crisp starched dresses, cloaks and those large pointy, floppy hankerchief caps. You know, they look like  urlLink  this . Oops I mean  urlLink  this!  I don't believe water can have an 'exceptional' taste, but this version is good. The slight carbonation results in lots of very tiny bubbles which don't battle with your mouth like Perrier does. Hildon allows you to enjoy the mild fizzy sensation whilst swallowing the water with ease.    urlLink  Find out more about Hildon here

       Friday May 14th 2004, with F, and later H and K.   It was already 9pm when we decided to go to our regular Friday night haunt, Belden Alley in San Francisco. Belden is a little slice of Europe in America. Cafe tables from the collection of French, Italian and Spanish restaurants spill out onto the paved street attracting a lively bunch of customers hooked on eating outside even on chillier nights. (Hier soir sa caillait). Wall heaters and awnings always warm things up quand il fait froid, whilst strings of lights hanging across from the buildings on each side  breathe magic into the atmosphere as the night draws darker.  As always, we started at Bastille for our aperitifs. A Kir Royal for moi and a regular Kir for the F homme. Half way through the glass I had one of those low blood sugar moments and I felt shaky and needed something a manger tout de suite. Luckily O, the owner of several restaurants in the street, appeared at that very moment with a complimentary plate of grilled toast with serrano ham and tomato for myself and F that he'd had delivered for us from B44 further up the street. I dived into the plateful as if I hadnt eaten for a week and soon felt well enough to finish the remaining half glass of my champagne avec cassis.   But tonight's mission was Plouf. Plouf is the French word for 'plop', when a pebble hits the water, makes a 'plouf' and causes a little ripple of rings. That same ripple is the restaurant's logo, in neon bleu and the restaurant specializes in seafood, especially les moules - for which it is famous. We arrived, kissed all the waiters as is de riguer with friends (bisous, bisous, bisous), and settled at the bar which tonight seemed a little livelier than outside. B the bartender started us off with a drink. F had another Kir whilst I settled for a glass of Bordeaux, St Emilion. Since discovering the delicousness of clams a couple of weeks ago, I just cant get enough of them, so ordered a bowlful flavoured with coconut and lemongrass avec une salad de polenta on the side. F ne mange pas seafood or fish so he settled for lamb chops instead from the limited carnivorous section of their menu.  When the food arrived, instead of clams, I was presented with a huge steaming bowl of mussels. "I didn't order those, I ordered clams". To which the waiter replied they had run out of clams. "Oi, B" (the bartenter who had taken our order), "You didn't tell me there were no clams". "Its ok, he said "the mussels are on me". He winked and refilled my glass without asking. The mussels were delicious, soaking in the same spicy thai-inspired coconut creamy sauce that the clams would also have drowned in. The polenta salad is one of my regular orders at plouf. I dont even care for polenta much but the Plouf version is something else. The creamiest hot centre, the perfect texture, not to sloppy, not too mealy, not too hard, brickette-shaped and surrounded by a perfectly crisp crust. The mixed green leaf salad accompanying is dressed with a smokey tomato sauce that tastes slightly unusual, but anything the polenta does more than makes up for anything the salad dressing doesnt.  H and K called, they were at an Orphanage wrap party for Day after Tomorrow and World of Tomorrow. They decided to whizz over to Belden and meet us as they hadnt had a proper meal. Joining us on the tall wobbly stools at the bar they quickly put in the orders before the kitchen closed for the night. H, the big guy, needed the full lamb entree but I recommended to K, who only wanted an appetizer, to try the tuna tartare which is excellent here. She ordered that and enjoyed the small cubes of tuna marinated in a dressing with sesame with a soupcon of citrus. H and K were served bad wine, the St Emilion was corked, so their glasses were swapped and a fresh bottle opened. Later B came to top up our glasses as way of an aplogy for the earlier corked one, but this bottle was corked too. He then opened a brand new bottle, four clean glasses and poured us the whole thing. This was our lucky night as far as complimentarys being served. So far a plate of jambon toast, a couple of glasses of wine and bowl of mussels.  But there was still more to come. We moved on to finish the evening with a night cap at  urlLink Voda , Belden's hip Vodka Bar run by T and D, ex waiters of Bastille. The other three had a shot each of  urlLink  Zubrowka , the Polish bison Grass vodka which is very difficult to buy in the States, while I had a shot of the  urlLink Dutch Effen Cherry vodka  which is strong, smooth and not too sweet. H and K left as F and I finished up the last drops  of our spirits ready to go home and dodo (short for dormir, to sleep). But before we could get away from the bar, D had already poured us each another glass of the bison grass liquor which he knows we both particularly enjoy. It would have been rude not to accept his kind gift so stay we did, a while longer...

       5.30 on Friday May 14th 2004, at work   the show i am working on is very short, hence our production team's eagerness to get in as many parties as possible before the whole thing is over. This one was livened up by the appearance of MDC's band playing a little set on the outside terrace of Trailer Nine. The setting sun hotted up for their performance as the pancake guys hotted up their skillets to make crepes. I declined, having already eaten a biscotti not much earlier. Actually, the truth be known, last time the pancake guys came to work I tried one of their savoury cheese and guacamole crepes which was one of the single most repulsive things I have ever put into my mouth. I had to spit it out and dump the whole thing in a trash can far away from my desk so I wouldn't have to suffer the scent of it fuming from its rejection as I worked. If you are going to splurge on a fattening crepe, then visit 'Ti Couz' (on Valencia at 16th in the Mission in SF). Their savoury crepes, especially the mushroom, cheese and almond, or the complete (french jambon, gruyere and fried egg) are the inspiration of dreams. Nothing like those nightmare crepes at work.     urlLink  Visit Ti Couz

       May 14 2004, Afternoon T   K just bought everyone in our office a homemade biscotti. Apparently they were hand baked by JS's wife. What a treat. Biscotti aren't too bad for you as they have little fat. Also, these ones aren't very sweet which makes them even more diet friendly. Additionally they contain nuts and dried apricots which makes them poisitively HEALTHY! Lets eat more in future.     urlLink  Look here for an Apricot Almond Biscotti Recipe

       Foodles Cafe and Restaurant, Kerner Blvd, San Rafael, CA 94901, May 14th 2004 with F   When I first came to work in San Rafael nearly 3 and a half years ago it quickly became apparent that Foodles was  a popular and convenient place to eat lunch. However, being a bit of a food snob and after taking offence at the ugly plastic orange Foodles sign adorning the dreary pebbledashed concrete frontage, I determined it would be a locale I would purposely never visit. My resolve faltered a few months into my employment when my friend J from the old country persuaded me to try it out. He spoke with such fondness of the tuna melt, that despite my disdain for tinned tuna, I felt compelled to try one. Ugh, it was disgusting, I never went back again. That was until recently, when F and I, trying to conserve a few pennies, decided we would have to make Foodles more of a regular stop on our lunchtime forage for food.  The first thing to hit you when you enter Foodles, are lots of little grease particles suspended in a smokey film that can hardly be described as air. Make sure you are not wearing your best Dry Clean Only outfit because after less than 5 minutes  any delicate perfumes you applied a few hours earlier in your boudoir will quickly be reduced to a stench of grease and fat.  I always make a beeline straight for the salad bar where I kid myself I am going to eat the most healthy meal imaginable. As it is serve yourself, you can indeed make all the right choices. However, as happened today, there are several less holy temptations on offer with which to dress up your pile of spinach leaves and grated carrots. Irresistible pasta salad with ham drowning in a heavy mayonnaise sauce, little deep fried chicken nuggets, boiled eggs halved to flaunt their solid golden yolks and glassy noodles in a sweet and seductive sesame dressing. A little of each cant hurt  that much  I thought to myself as I crowned my pile of edibles with a large flat square of tofu topped with a tart chilli sauce.  F usually goes for a salad too (a startlingly different selection from mine, always) but today he had an egg salad sandwich, a bag of crisps and a box of marlboro reds. The girl behind the cash register is always pleased to see F because she likes to practice her French on him. Her 'Bonjour, comment ca va?' is almost perfect now. We dive out of the cafe as quickly as possible and eat on one of the little tables outside in order to catch the breeze and hopefully blow away some of Foodle's unique scent from the rest of our day.

       May 12th 2004 wiv me old china's E and P.   P and I arrived just before the regular, E, and ordered a couple of sakitinis. They were huge and we couldnt drink them fast enough as E let us into her little secret: there's a waiter here who fills up her sake bottle for free, over and over and over again. A bottomless flask of hot sake. oh yes. This was going to be a good night. E is also on first name terms with one of the sexy sushi chef's too, so after munching on a bowlful of plump edamames she paid him a visit to find out what was good from today's catch. He sent us a plateful of the freshest sashimi and four perfectly arranged New Zealand Green Lipped Mussel appetizers.  Each mussel was adorned with something crunchy, piquant and delicious whilst sharing its carefully balanced shell with the yolk of a little quail's egg. P doesn't do mussels so E and I landed two each. Those mussels delivered some punch. P doesn't know what she missed. A bowl of seaweed salad later, we ordered more sushi. My california roll was overly stodgy and lacking delicacy. I ended up picking out the crab avocado centres and rejecting the chewy rice. P's kamikaze roll was better, but E really scored with the wild salmon nigiri. It had the most amazing smoky taste, almost as if the fish really had gone wild and spent his last night downing Laphroaig followed by a last wish cup of Lapsong Souchon the next morning to settle his hangover before his execution. So instead of dessert we ordered a final plate of that wild, wild salmon, sashimi style and none of us missed the mochi we could otherwise have chosen. By the time we left we were a happy trio - the waiter who had been refilling that sake flask and sharing 'cheers' with us in a different language everytime he stopped by told us we were all beautiful. From the number of languages we'd used through put the night, sante, prosit, salud, skol, Kam Pai and Gom Bay as well as cheers, I can't ignore the fact that, gorgeous as we all are, he was probably viewing us, and the world, through his Sake Goggles as we disappeared into the SoMa night...    urlLink  Sushi Groove South Details Here

       Thursday June 24th 2004   When I found out our restauranteur friend (part owner of Bastille, Plouf, etc), was bringing his charming Dutch wife  and their  3  daughters  around for dinner I felt a slight panic. I had never really cooked for children before so this was a new challenge. What's more they were coming pretty early, so i would have little time after work to prepare anything exotic. Just as well, because kids don't like exotic! In the end I decide to make flakey pastry tarts using ready-made pastry. My brainwave was to have the girls "build their own" tarts. When they arrived everything was ready for them to assemble. Little bowls of different cheeses, French ham and tomato paste and fresh tomatoes. I think they had fun, especially when they topped the tart each with their own initial for easier identification after baking.  I also won them over by putting food colouring in their 7Up. Kids, it seems, are easily impressed when their soda turns blue or pink! There were two adult versions of the tarts for the grown ups, one with mustard, French ham, gruyere and emmental, the other with sundried tomato paste, olives, roasted peppers and tomatoes, goat cheese, mozarella and basil. The meal was served with a couple of salads. No left overs!   Our guests brought us dessert from another of the restaurants, they have an interest in,  urlLink Chou Chou , Patisserie Artisanal & French Bistro on Twin Peaks. A huge pear and chocolate tart which we helped down with some freshly whipped cream. I meant to bring the rest to work today to share with my colleagues but I am not going to be popular with them because I completely forgot it...

       Saturday June 19th 2004    I had heard good reports of  urlLink Suppenkuche   so many times that when I received  an invite to a party just a couple of blocks away from it, I decided we should begin our Saturday night with food at this popular German kitchen. Joining myself and F on this occasion were a couple of our French friends. F, who has German ancestry,  had high hopes that the food would be reminiscent of the delicious meals his grandmother made him when he was a child. He had perused the menu online earlier and already decided exactly what he wanted to try.  Our company for the evening  arrived a little earlier than us and had secured us a table in the back room. We were sharing the space with a large birthday party and the level of noise caused by echoing of the jovialities from the wooden, refectory-style benches was almost unbearable. The waitress recommended a swift German draught beer would help quickly acclimatize us to the decible-deafening atmosphere. I settled for a Heffewiessen whilst the others tried  more adventurous German Ales replacing the Leffe they wanted, but the restaurant had run out of.   For appetizers, F's mind was already set on the potato pancakes with apple whilst the rest of us shared a plate of german meats and cheeses. Both dishes were huge and we were relieved we hadn't ordered an appetizer per person. The cold plate was beautifully presented on a bed of green leaves, with little pots of mustard and mayo, hard boiled eggs and tomato. The selection tasted fresh and uniquely German. F  faired less well with the potato pancakes. Again, the portion was huge with several large, floppy pancakes and an accompanying bowl of apple puree. The seasoning was bland and the pancakes weren't crispy enough to make this starter even close to exciting. F sadly declared that the Suppenkuche version bore absolutely no relation to anything his grandmother had ever made him.  When our entrees arrived, our eyes expanded to the size of the huge plates the meals were presented on. None of us had seen such huge portions in our life, even though we've all been living in the US quite a while. It makes you feel a little bit weak and just a little depressed to be faced with a mound of food so big you know you won't even be able to make a sizeable dent in it. Immediately your brain starts to talk through all of the excuses you are going to have make later to the waitress when she returns for the (still nearly-full) plates.  We were all unecessarily overwhelmed by the volume and underwhelmed by the execution. I had chosen "Jägerschnitzel in Champignonsoße mit Spätzle", a sauteed porkloin with mushroom sauce and german noodles. The spatzle were disappointedly bland. Even the addition of salt helped them little. The pork was tender but the mushroom sauce very ordinary. F's Bratwurst with sauerkraut made even less of impression on him whilst the other two, who had each chosen the same stewed-pork and dumpling dish could easily have shared one between them and still had some to spare.  I am certain that Suppenkuche rarely sell dessert. The birthday table next to us ordered just one candle-decorated slice of Black Forest gateau to share amongst everyone, it seemed.  The evening's saving grace (aside from the good beer), was that we had spent some quality time with good friends, and that we had a party to dash to as an excuse not to linger in this pleasant, but noisy and lacking, homage to German cuisine.  How I reported my visit to Zagat:  Overwhelmed by the portion sizes and underwhelmed by the quality of the cuisine while you fight to hold a conversation with your friends in this decible-blasting refectory-style eaterie, you'll find there is only one thing for it: drown your sorrows in a decent beer, or two...

       Saturday June 12 2004   On our way to a party in the neighbourhood we stopped at  urlLink Hayes Street Grill,  established as a stalwart pre-theatre dining establishment in Hayes Valley. The clinical unwelcoming decor, bright lighting, old-fashioned mirrors  hanging on the wall and unfascinating, sparse, clientelle did nothing to warm us to the place when we first entered. We hadn't really eaten all day so I decided we should share an appetiser. The menu is fish-centric and as F doesn't eat seafood, I chose the Grilled Hoffman Quail Salad with Cherries  for $12.50. The waiter kindly served the dish on two plates, with half of the juicy little quail on each. Accompanying frisee salad was well dressed with cherries packing a little extra sweet sharp punch.    For main course, I ordered  the Niman Flatiron Steak with Mustard Butter, Balsamic Onions, French Fries ($19.75) whilst F chose House-Made Boudin Blanc Sausages, Arugula and Frisee, French Fries ($16.50). I know there is something drastically amiss with the food when F finds the salad leaves to be the most exciting thing on his plate. He declared that the Boudin Blanc from Safeway was better than the mushy mess of sausage he'd been presented with. My flatiron steak was so tough I couldn't cut it, even with the special sharp knife they had provided me with. The fries, served separately in a cone, were so hard and crunchy that even after being left to soak up sauce for 15 minutes they hadn't softened, not even slightly. As I tried to stab them with my fork, their crispy surfaces would reject my efforts and they would fly off of my plate at all sorts of angles like bullets, leaving me and the surrounds covered in splatters of sauce. My waiter was ignoring me so I explained to the busboy who took away my plates that my meal was unacceptable as I literally was physically unable to eat it. I asked him if he could he pass on the message. This didn't happen and so when we were presented with the bill I really felt I had to say something. I have never done this before in my life: actually refuse to pay for a dish. He took my meal off of the check but I would at least have expected him to be more interested in the problem or send out the chef to see me and apologize. I can't believe this place has such a good zagat rating. Maybe all the pre-theatre diners are in such a hurry to get to their performances, they eat so fast that they actually forget to stop and actually wonder how the food tastes.  My summary for Zagat:  Waiting staff have been wheeled out of retirement to preside over this ugly clinical eating space where the steak was  tougher than the flatiron it was named after, the fries  so hard that even after a 15 minute bathe in the sauce, they still  flew across the room when  you  tried to put your fork in them. The boudin blanc from Safeway tastes better than what you find here.

       ...or sushi to kill you? Wednesday June 9th 2004   I met my friend P at Blowfish Sushi last night so we could catch up on news and gossip after her recent trip to London.  At the bar we supped on suprisingly good mojitos whilst they kept us waiting about 40 minutes, for a table we had reserved for 8pm. On being seated we ordered hot sake and edamame to nibble on as we perused the menu. First dish out from the kitchen was a seaweed salad beautifully presented inside a cylindrical basket of root vegetable I guess was jicama. The seaweed itself was balanced on top of a bed of regular salad leaves giving the impression the salad was much larger than it really was. It tasted ok. This was follwed by the 'Tofu Napoleon', a layered concoction of crispy tofa and yuba with plum and orange-ginger sauce. The tofu tasted, well, just like tofu but the yuba reminded us of soggy paper and the sauce bizarrely reminded me of pineapple and coca-cola cubes, a British candy we ate when we were kids.   Next the sashimi arrived, exotically balanced on a gourd shell packed with ice and frou-froufery twigs adorning as decoration. The result of the ice was that the fish was too cold. Maybe they were trying to chill out the flavour as the selction of sake, katsuo, maguro, sabe, ama-ebi and hamachi disappointedly tasted far less than fresh. Our final plate was amusingly named "Quack Circus". Surely enough, the 'ring' of fried potato that contained the star performer of duck arranged on a bed of oyster mushrooms and pistachios was entertaining but whilst the miniscule tender pieces of duck were delicious, the mushroom melange was ruined by the nuts which were soggy instead of crispy and therefore tasted stale.     The Summary I reported to Zagat:  Dear  urlLink Blowfish Sushi : Stop worrying about what your food looks like and pay more attention to the taste! Stunning, exotic, precariously balanced presentations are impressive only until the moment the food passes your lips. Less than fresh fish, stale accompanying ingredients like soft pistachios and old-tasting beets reduced all the other creative efforts to pointless.

      Sunday June 6th, 2004  As it was my birthday, F took me to one of my favourite SF eating spots,  urlLink  Chez Papa   for dinner. We started with Kirs and sat outside to enjoy the last moments of the sun setting across Protrero Hill where the restaurant is  nestled on the summit of the busiest section of 18th Street. We hadn't eaten all day and decided, therefore, we  weren't  going to skip appetizers as usual. They were out of the tuna tartare I would have ordered, and have stopped serving the foie gras I love so much so I settled instead for melted cambozola with roasted garlic and toast points whilst F opted for artichokes and cheese wrapped in prosciutto and then cooked. Cambozola is one of my favourite cheeses so the dish didn't have to fight too hard for my affection. The accompanying garlic was roasted to a soft, squidgy, delicate, perfection and I thanked my lucky stars that my boyfriend is French and would enjoy kissing me just as much once my breath had been perfumed by the scent of a stinking rose.  We both chose Fillet mignon on a potato and parsnip gratin with foie gras sauce as our main dish. It was one of the most delicious, heavenly steaks I have ever tasted in my entire life. The meat itself was perfect already, but the addition of the tasty rich sauce and the creamy potatoes elevated the eating experience to one at a level I rarely encounter. I found myself starting to eat slower and slower in the hope of prolonging the wonderful experience. I think my brain had decided if I kept dividing the remaining food on my plate in half, it would never run out. By this stage we had really eaten more than enough, but as it was my birthday we couldnt resist a little dessert for a change. We shared a tarte tatin between us. Chez Papa's  is a particularly memorable version of this classic sticky French apple tart. Somehow the waiting staff had got wind of the fact it was my birthday and the tarte was served with a candle adorning in it's middle.  I've always seen that happen to other people, not to me, so secretly I was happy. Another of my lifelong ambitions can be crossed off of the list...     Merci beaucoup, F, pour le diner!

       urlLink  Crepsucule's Website Here    Last night it was late when I got home from wine tasting in Napa and found F hadn't eaten all day. I am trying to be good with my money and eat out less, but F offered to treat me and asked me to try and think of somewhere we could go. I had just read about Crepuscule on  urlLink Chowhound , so I thought it would be a good place to try especially as it was in walking distance and didn't seem to be too expensive.  Crepuscule is a small place tucked away next to Tunnel Top on Bush. The decor is dark, reds and woods warmed by flickering candle lights (It's only a matter of time before something sets alight, however, the waiter had a narrow miss only when a customer on a neighbouring table noticed that back of his shirt was dangerously close to a flame as he took an order). The tables are charming, constructed from old French wine racks. We were seated upstairs, next to the window. The setting is overall quaint, even romantic.   As every French person in this town seems to know every other French person, it didn't surprise me when F greeted the Patron like on old friend. Yes, they knew each other slightly. The exceptional friendliness he showed us may well have been because of the connection, but the waiting staff did seem to be super friendly and helpful with everyone else too. He let us try all of the three red wines on their short menu, before we settled on a very reasonably priced bottle French merlot. He explained that a new more exhaustive wine list would be rolled out soon.  We had a discussion about sourcing real French ingredients like saussicons and hams before settling on our choice of crepe. F, who is a cheese crepe fanatic ordered an emmental with the addition of Merguez, a spicy Algerian sausage much loved by the French who have many connections with that particular North African country. I asked what kind of ham was in "La Chambord" - egg, Emmental cheese, mushrooms, ham & bechamel sauce and was told it was the white Parisienne ham so took that as my choice. When it arrived, beautifully presented in minimalist rectangular style with the beautiful  sunny-side-up egg perched on the top and a vibrant green, shining pile of lettuce leaves to the side, I could hardly wait to dig into it. The crepe was a small parcel with intense flavours, the strongest of which were the emmental and the bacon. Bacon? Yes - the "ham" in fact turned out to be bacon, but I wasn't disappointed, I can try the ham one next time. The crepes certainly aren't large, it's a case of quality over quantity. The spectacular-looking green leaves were disappointing. They were dressed with some overtly sweet vinaigrette (I suspect raspberry) that jarred with the savouriness of the crepes. I would much prefer a typical French hot spicy mustard vinaigrette to accompany my savoury crepe. F was less impressed with his, he said he couldn't taste the cheese. I suggested that maybe the spiciness of the Merguez may be overpowering it, because the emmental certainly gave my own crepe it's nutty distinct flavour.    F, is always want to have two crepes, and today was no different: He ordered another savoury emmental, this time without the addition of sausage. He wanted to compare it to the Ti Couz version which he is pretty crazy about. I don't often order desserts but decided to try a sweet crepe on this occasion - also for the purpose of comparing Ti Couz, whose savoury crepes I love, but whose sweet crepes I find to be soggy, rubbery and inexplicably served with a dollop of cream or butter on top (even if you ask them to leave it off). I ordered a simple crepe with lemon juice and sugar (my favourite due to the British custom of Shrove Tuesday or Pancake Day as it is also known where every mother in the country is badgered into making dozens of pancakes, to order, for supper, all of which are served with just fresh lemon juice and white sugar. The purpose of this day? Fattening up for the more frugal period of Lent to come).  Crepuscule's sweet crepe was sublime. Just the right amount of crispiness on the outside and softness inside, contrasting with the sharpness of the lemon and sweetness of the sugar. This crepe far surpassed the sweet crepes I tried at Ti Couz.  Fred wasn't quite as enamoured with his plain emmental crepe. He thought it was pretty good, but not a strong enough contender to knock Ti Couz, who use his preferred gruyere cheese in theirs, off the top of his list of favourite crepes. Crepuscule is a much more intimate space than Ti Couz, the staff are far more friendly and I certainly prefer it, even though F didn't like his dinner quite as much. We finished our meal with a complimentary dessert wine and an  espresso. We had been treated superbly by the staff and we shall certainly be returning. The fact that it is open late (til 1am) is a definite bonus and with just about every plate well under ten bucks, I am sure that Crepuscule will soon have a faithful following.

       6770 Washington St, Yountville, Napa, 944-8246   I recently discovered  urlLink Chowhound.  It's perfect for me. It host's the newsgroup I have always wanted but didnt know existed, until now. I went there to ask advice about the best place for a quick but good brunch in Yountville. Some people recommended fancy restauraunts, but we didn't have time for that.  Another suggested takeout, but we wanted to stop for at least a short break. The Chowhound who suggested Gordon's, hit the nail right on the head. There is easy parking, a quick turnaround so seats become available regularly, ordering is done from a counter so no need to wait for serving staff. Healthful sounding choices are written on large blackboards. We had missed breakfast, but lunch choices included a variety of salads, sandwiches, soup and a tart. Everything seemed to be home cooked and portions were generous. My spinach, bacon and egg salad was delicious with just enough dressing to make it glisten without drowning it. We were in and out within about 30 minutes, satisfied and our stomachs lined ready for the afternoon of wine tasting ahead...

      Nearly every review I have ever read of Fly Trap included the words  classic, old-fashioned, celery victoire, businessmen or traditional.  Hardly the types of words to attract me. However, seeing as Flytrap  is the closest restaurant to my home (aside from the Indian next door to it), it so happens that from time to time, when it is late, we are feeling lazy and the fridge shows no sign of inspiring us to cook, we amble over there for a snack. The decor is indeed classic but refreshing too. Pale yellows warm and brighten the place, as do the long mirrors behind the banquet seating separating the bar slightly from the main eating area. Crisp white table cloths, and candles, their flames dancing inside little crackled glass bowls keep the atmosphere fresh. The dozens of framed illustrations covering the walls may well be described as old fashioned, but it's certainly not a staid has-been space. I like the FlyTrap menu, which, I think, is reprinted every day because they always have a set of a least half a dozen specials available. Many of their dishes appear to be large or rich so I usually just stick to the appetizers. This keeps the cost down too, as many of their main courses are well over the $20 mark. The busboy brought water and very good warm bread to the table (a mix of white and walnut). Our wait for service on this occasion was a little longer than is acceptable. I think this was because several tables had arrived within a few minutes and the waiter was overstretched. Eventually we got the attention of someone so we could order drinks. As usual, F and I both decided on a glass of Bordeaux. When the wine arrived it tasted strange. I am not a wine connoisseur, but from instinct I could tell that although it wasn't corked, this wine was either not a Bordeaux, or it had been open to long and had oxidized, or something. Nervously I called over the waiter and explained that the wine didn't taste right to me. He kindly went off and opened a new bottle of the Bordeaux for us to try. I was relieved to find it tasted worlds apart from the first glass and so my confidence as a wine taster had not been dented. He replaced our glasses and we happily ordered our dinner. F and I decided we needed some vegetables, so we opted to share the special heirloom tomato salad as a starter. This was presented as a large mound of frissee surrounded by slices of the different coloured and varieties of heirlooms, drizzled with oil and balsalmic. Although the red tomatoes were good, the green and yellow ones weren't ripe enough. Some were so bitter and hard that they were inedible. It was disappointing to spend $12.50 on a salad and the chef wasn't even able to select ripe tomatoes. It's not as if they are hard to come by at this time of year. I followed up with a steaming mound of mussels and clams which were presented in a cast iron skillet, swimming in the garliciest of  broths with a few slices of garlic toast. I like this dish, but I am not sure it's a good idea to choose it if you are on a date and hoping for a kiss later. F, a creature of habit, ordered the cheese tortelloni which he raves about. On every visit to Flytrap, he has never tried anything else. I tried a forkful once and it was good, but truly wicked and cheesy and creamy and rich as any dish could be. I am sure if I had his kind of metabolism I would be able to enjoy such a calorific dinner, but as I don't I am happy to stick to smaller, safer, appetizers instead.

       Sat July 3rd 2004      After arriving at London Heathrow at around 1pm, my parents kindly picked us up and drove us West to Bristol where my mother pandered to my whims by preparing a light lunch of mozarella, tomato and basil salad. We didn't want to spoil our appetites for the gastronomic evening ahead.    Arriving by taxi at  urlLink Thornbury Castle  a few minutes early, we took advantage of the spare minutes, the beautiful blue sky and the warm evening by wandering arounds the castle's grounds. Apart from a vineyard (yes, the castle makes its own wine), the grounds include the oldest Tudor garden in the entire country. It's difficult to explain, after living in America for so long, exactly what it feels like to be inside a building steeped in so much history, especially one that dates back to 1510. Even if money were no object, there is no way you could ever spend an evening in such a place in the US - you actually have to leave the country for this kind of experience.        We were shown to the lounge - or maybe it's the drawing room? Wooden panels, leaded windows, tapestried sofas, a huge fireplace and ancient portraits including one of King Henry VIII who stayed here with Anne Boleyn adorning the the soaring loft-height walls. This was the grand setting for us to choose apperitifs (3 Kir Royals and 1 Scotch in the case of our party), peruse the menu and nibble on the complimentary canapes: a bowl of salty olives, miniature cottage-pie tartlets, petit quiche lorraine, little goat cheese biscuits.     Dinner is a set menu of three courses only, with no ' a la Carte '. After making our difficult choices and finishing our apperitifs, we were guided to the grand circular dining room with cross-shaped windows (originally designed for shooting arrows at enemies). Each table setting had a silver plate at its centre . Very grand. Our chosen red wine (Gigondas) was decanted infront of us before being poured into our glasses. My mother, who prefers white, had taken a glass of the Thornbury Castle-made wine instead, which she declared to be very reasonable.    Once we had our drinks in hand, the waiters arrived with an  amuse gueule  (amusement for the mouth) - a little espresso cup, each filled with a sweet  roasted orange pepper soup topped with a bitter green pepper oil. It was absolutely delicious but difficult to get ahold of fast enough with the tiniest of teaspoons that was provided.     A basket of warm bread rolls (served with silver tongs) were presented to us next. My mother and F couldn't get enough of the cheese variety whilst I preferred a plain white crowned with poppy seeds.     My mother and I had both decided upon the  'trio of ham hock'   for our entrees. Beautifully presented on a silver tray was a consomme (thin soup) which tasted fine but was not very inspiring, a ham rillette with puy lentils which may have been better tasting without the excess salt, and some kind of crispy mustard-batter coated succulent ham basking on a bed of sweet pea puree. This was the highlight of the dish and could have made it on its own, as a star performer, without any need for inferior sidekicks. Dad had a cod and tomato salad which looked healthy (not a bad move considering his next course), while F had a foie gras terrine with duck, a red onion confit and some kind of jelly (the latter which he ignored). F said his pate was good but that it didn't have enough salt (he should have taken some from my rillettes).    For my main course I had chosen a Guinea Fowl with duxelle of mushrooms and parsnips. The breast meat was extremely tender with an almost too overpowering flavour of truffles. The accompanying confit-style crispy morsels of the bird served over spinach were by far the most exciting part of this dish. Everyone else had eagerly chosen the steak. They certainly didn't look disappointed as they all lapped up every last little scrap of food on their plates, including a cabbage and bacon potato cake.    The next interval between courses presented us with another complimentary taster from the kitchen, a mini yoghurt, fruit and crisp dessert which, whilst not unpleasant, would have been more at home on a breakfast menu.     We pushed the half eaten remains aside and waited for our real desserts, the ones we had chosen ourselves. I had chosen an ' assiette de vanille ', a selection plate of vanilla based desserts including an extremely moreish frothy vanilla milkshake, a chewy undercooked vanilla risotto, a fairly ordinary vanilla panna cotta and a delicious vanilla ice cream in a brandy-snap basket. For someone who can take or leave icecream, read that as praise indeed.    Mum and F both chose the Chocolate fondant, a gooey chocolate cake concoction which F declared to be good despite claiming to not like sweet things at all whilst Dad, a diabetic, had no other choice than to make a selection from the extremely interesting looking British Cheese Board. As he offered none of us a nibble of any of his cheeses before 'licking his platter clean', I can only surmise that he found the selection to his satisfaction.    We retired to the drawing room once again for coffees and after-dinner drinks before heading back to my parents for a well earned jet-lag-recovery night's sleep.

      I visit Plouf every couple of weeks. It's one of my favourite restaurants, partly for the food but mainly for the atmosphere. I have been there so many times that I have got to know the staff and that always ensures I have a good time. Because I go there so often, I get to know the menu pretty well so I was excited to find they had changed their menu on my last visit.  First the bad news: The Polenta salad they had had, with a smokey tomato sauce and the softest, creamiest pillow of polenta served with a bed of shiny dressed green leaves was not longer an option. This saddened me: the salad was an addiction of mine, and I knew I would miss it.  I loved their old tuna tartare as well, but was excited to try the new version which was served on a bed of seaweed salad with pickled lemons. It was beautifully presented with the freshest looking tuna sliced in several glistening slices, resting on the japanese greens, swirled with an orange oil that I soon discovered was chilli. This dish disappointed me. In the first mouthful it was bland and I had to add salt to draw out the flavours. Then the mix of three strong tastes - the chilli oil, the bitter chunks of lemon rind and the crunchy seaweed salad all completely overpowered the delicate tuna which should have been center stage. Instead the three stronger elements fought it out for main attention, none of them exactly winning the battle, but all of them damaging the impact of the other in some way.  F's goat cheese and heirloom salad was far more satisfying with a good tasty cheese, well selected ripened tomatoes and well dressed green leaves with a banyuls vinaigrette. For our main courses F took the new york steak which was served with a potato gratin and rich dark sauce. The steak was absolute perfection, well cooked to the medium rare requested, hot and a very tasty piece of meat. It paired well with the sauce which contrasted perfectly with the white creamy potato gratin which wasn't the best of potato gratins, but was quite adequate and provided some comforting carbs to the meal too.  I tried another new addition to the meat menu - a duo of lamb dish. I ordered the lamb rare. It came with two rolled pieces of leg of lamb that were disappointingly stone cold, and two lamb meatballs that were a little warmer but not exactly hot. These were served on a bed of fresh chick peas and cucumber and yohurt. The whole dish was drizzled in mint pesto. Being English, I am more than familiar with the concept of lamb and mint, I grew up with it and I generally love it. This dish, however was totally overpowered by the mint. Everything tasted of it: the lamb, the chickpeas, the cucumber, everything. There was no contrast to that mint taste so the dish quickly became boring and I only finished half of it. The lamb meatballs had a little more flavour and managed to venture out slightly from under the mint ummbrella, but as they were cooling down, and not as hot as they maybe should have been, the taste of the fat in them became a little bit more dominant than I would have liked. I passed my comments on to the manager, so hopefully he'll act upon my suggestions and improve the two dishes we didn't like so much. Otherwise, if you pay a visit soon, I would recommend the steak over the lamb, or stick to the delicious steaming bowls of mussels and clams which are always excellent whenever I have them.
