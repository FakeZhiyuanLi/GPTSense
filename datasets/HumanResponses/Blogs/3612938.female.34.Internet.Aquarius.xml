        My gosh, and I thought I had finally got everyone to master the Email.. I have decided I am gonna put an application to God, he has to preconfiugre all the babies with the basic knowledge of computers, internet, emails and the likes.. I mean at least the next gen of administrators will be saved for this insanity....   Here i come on a nice saturday morning.. get my first cup of coffee and everything is quite, the managers are all busy wid their respective stuff, still sleepy, i was gonna settle down to a nice day of peaceful existance..But alas it was but a trance.. a mirage..   By 9 30, i start getting SOS 911 calls from every imaginable user, that the EMAIL is not working.. my god.. the world has come to a stop, for heavens sake its saturday.. no ones even awake in the world.. but well, i set about trying to find out why in the gods good world the EMAIL stopped working,   I check the exchange, the mdaemon and every possible solution, Finally figure out that TWO particular mailboxes are over quota and they are in fact the culprits.. So i decide to do a check.. By this time it was already lunchtime.. and i was like bugged by the calls.. and my stomach was kinda already on the road.. neways, heres what i find the the respective mailboxes..   User one : Executive Secretary to the MD, ( both equally exceutable, if u ask me) neways.. the lady actually had a folder called "ERROR" under her inbox and guess what i find in that? are you ready?? almost 432 MB of error messages over the years.. !! OK OK.. administrators, relax, take a deep breath, Theres more.. Not only this, she also has a folder named POST and guess whats in that? U got it.. all the Postmaster deliver notifications.. add another 284 MB of space.. my god,   Second User : Sales Manager - Perfumes.. = He is a babe in the woods, total white collar affair.. He has been sending ppl brouchres, that he had downloaded from the local intranet, pictures of new launches of perfumes, POS material and stuff, (this is meant only for internal refernce) Now this SM takes it upon himself to send all his customers this brouchures, inclusive of the whole folder... heres the catch.. the size???? 52.3 MB , imagine, all emails going&nbsp; out, bouncing back and He is resending them again.... and again.. and agian.. till he jams up the whole server.. !!!!Alternative to this was, he could have sent all of them the weblink of the same stuff..   Now.. i am seriously at a loss of words, which is quite something.. coz i havent shut my trap since i was born he he.. well i am trying&nbsp; my best to keep my good humor up...... its getting difficult,   but this users will pay.. and god will they pay.. i am gonna make them pay for causing me all this heartburn.. and most important conducting a virtual rape on my servers.... i wish there were laws.. whereas i could digitally murder them and get away wid it.. ..  there... i got it off my chest.. now relax... take a deep breath.... and get back to what u do best.. blogging.. he he.. hey world.. mes back....and am here to stay....

          If you have one watch, you will always know what time it is. If you have two watches ... you're never quite sure.    So, too, with opinions. If you have one opinion (your own), you know what to do. But when you have several opinions, it can get quite confusing.     Of course, there are times when the opinions of others are very important. Doctors know more about your internal plumbing than you do. And your plumber is better placed to diagnose a leaky basement pipe.   But when it comes to making life choices, you have to choose between following your heart and listening to all those other voices that think they know best. I just reviewed an excellent book on this for Library Journal. When the book becomes available to the public, I will share that review with you. The premise of the book, in case you hadn't guessed, is that you really must follow your heart.     If too many watches are messing up your life's schedule, put the others away and keep that one watch that will always tell you what time it is.

        Heres Weekend.. and i spend it studying, reading, emailing, chatting and occasionally adding a word to scrabbles..(its getting difficult to beat myself.. am getting damn good at 3 letter words..) neways.. today its different, something feels different..   Thinking about how a sunday morning would be at home.. hmm it would be like..   7:30 am : Mom... walking into the room..opening curtains letting the sun in...with the background sound of her muttering... humare jamane mein to him subah subah uthkar paath puja karke taiyar ho jate the.. aur aajkal ke bache.. pata nahi kya karte rahte hai raat bhat, chalo bhagwan ka sukhr hai, kam se kam gudiya raat bhar bahar to nahi jati, pata nahi computer par kya karti rahti..hai, chalo thik hai, disco visco ka chakkar to nahi hai.."&nbsp;   now if u dont wake up to that.. then theres the getting ready for laundry thing, which shall surely wake u up..  7:35 am :&nbsp;Mom... fiddling around in the closet, do u want this to be washed, dint u wear this trouser about a million times..&nbsp; my god, look at this jeans.., its so dirty&nbsp;u cant see its&nbsp;color...&nbsp;THERE THE MAGIC WORDS.... NOOOOO Mom, leave my jeans alone, I am UP, see.. me awake,.. eyes wide open.. i mean who wants a jeans that smells of Tide and Comfort...  umm.. so while u are up u decide to freshen up and ask.. whats for breakfast.. now this is surely a luxury.. normal working days in the life of a single women.. breakfast consists of a glass of milk.. no make that a drink of milk straight from the bottle while trying ot put on her shoes and gathering her books ...looking for keys.. and cursing herself for not getting up earlier..well, neways, breakfast at home is milk, the likes of upmas, toasts, and anything but cereals.. :) wow.. ma ke haath ka khana.. nothing beats that,  After breakfast its like watch the tv for a while, talk to friends on phone, wake them up.. i mean why should i be the only early bird ya?? then its the regular.. reading, talking gossiping, emailing, chatting.. and stuff, till one of the pals call back wid some super duper scheme of chilling out at a cool happening place...&nbsp;( i really dont understand the expression, how can a person chill out when all the cool happening places are like hot hot hot and.. too far from where u stay.. dont they ever think about making those cool places say on the block u stay?? ) neways, thats another thought..   Though my favorite hangout is home.. my corner, wid my pc, books or just nothing.. i love my home.. :) i like being with myself,   so .. thats the end of a weekend at home..only to start exactly the same way next day.. surprised.. dont be, coz, home, mom and chilling out at happening places happens&nbsp;only when i am on vacation.. which is alike too far and between work than i would like.   Weekend, its just another day in life, the concept being keeping u for urself in this busy schedule. thats the reason why i go inot my cocoon as tahir calls it on this day.. I like being left alone.   I prefer to call it my bubble, coz its prone to breaking as well.. when i sometimes take&nbsp; a break from myself and want to go out, hang out, for a juice and watch the ppl go by.. life go by.. time fly by.. have u ever felt time go by?? One of my aunts, shes felt it, she described it once, and when i heard her say it, i felt time too.. awesome, but hey..nows the time to take a break, and get back to the chores as well. thats another word for a weekend in a working gals life.. CLIC .. cleaning, laundering, ironing and cooking.. :) .. so will see ya laterzzzzzzzzzzz

        Funny thing happened today afternoon, Me and my friend Varsha, we were going to lunch today, We were like waiting at the signal, and there was this car next to us, a nice green camry.. and a guy, who was looking very harried, had the windows open, maybe his ac wasnt working, else who would think anyone in a sane mind would be driving around dubai, with windows down at noon?? no.. neways, he was like sulking or something, and there was this nice music playing on my radio.. i was singing away to glory.. and i suddenly flashed a huge sweet inocent smile a tthe guy.. My friend was like shocked, and adding to her fury was, when the signal was green, the car followed us.. all the way to Little Hut, (a small joint we like to visit)&nbsp; and the conversation that followed .. was totally one way.. aka varsha yelling my head off,   Neways, i dint think i did anything wrong, and we found parking went into the restaurant and had a loud angry lunch, he he.. i was reduced to a yes no, ok never again.. in between stuffing myself, neways, the surprise came when we asked for the bil.. the waiter(rafi, he knows us at his loudest customers he he.. but well he treats us real well, inspite of the mearge amounts we leave behind that substitute for tips ) neways, he brought us this plate wid the bill.. and instead of the bill, guess what i found in there?&nbsp; a load of money and a&nbsp; small note.. which went" Thank you, angel, your smile helped, Please accept this small gift as a gesture of faith in strangers "  And the guy had left enuff for 3 lavish dinners.. isnt that great?? i mean yah i admit that u shouldnt talk to strangers, but sometimes, when u see someone u just feel like sharing a smile, after all we are sharing the sky the earth and the air arent we?? I wish he had left his number as well, so that i can call and return his money, just the thnx would have been enuf, but this incident got me thinking how much we really affect others lives in so many small manners..   Have been thinking since.. and i realise that the laundry man, the grocery man, the pizza delivery guy, the boatman, the taxi ppl, even the ppl we commute wid daily.. gosh there are so many contacts we have during the day to day lives..and how many times do we stop to think what our actions will be affecting them?? not many.. in fact, when someone scowls at us, or is abrupt wid us, we immediately go" subah chai nahi pi hogi, biwi ne pita hoga, miya se zagda hua hoga etc etc" at the same time, i guess smiling and being nice to ppl would have good impression on them ya?? well i am never rude.. well almost never.. maybe thats why smiling comes easily to me..   Well, lately i have been a different perosn , a bit abrupt and short with eveyrhting, including myself, so i have made a new resolution today, in honor of the free lunch.. nah.. seriously, in honor of touching another life, i am going to try and be more tolerant of things i am not so happy wid.. so heres to my new resolution and of course prayers for the stranger.. who was so upset that just a smile helped him.. i do wish he finds his peace.. whereever, whatever.. manner.. todays for him..   So a lesson learnt.. albeit Varsha isnt all that happy, but hey, who can deny a free lunch, esp when u dont know its free.. in the meantime i have decided to add the lunch money to the leftover money.. and thinking about what to do with it,&nbsp;whatever.. u just cant accept lunches from ppl u dont even know exist ya?? so i guess to charity it shall go..   and maybe the blessings will fall on the stranger.. right? am i oding the right thing, if not, god forgive me..   neways, am getting back to work.. its like thrusday.. and hectic.. and am in a hurry to get home as well.. if possible on time.. so heres to laters.. and a great weekend...

        The train of thought begins with an sms received, it went something like " Khuda se thoda rehem khareed lete... aapke zakhmon ka marham khareed lete.. agar kahin bikti khushiyan meri.. to saari bechkar appka har gam khareed lete.."&nbsp; I start wondering.. if a person really meant that? i mean do u really mean what u send across.. esp this forwards.. emails or sms or mms?? yeah admitted that sending sms costs u, and it also means that u are thought about and blah blah.. and that while those figners are going too fast on the phonebook list ur name flashes for a split second decision. on whether to be clicked or not .. ye.. this does mean that u are remembered.. somewhere, by someone.. while u were sleeping like a baby.. unaware, blissful..   Most times i am happy to receive these messages, esp when i know that they have been sent by ppl i know genuinely care, just sometimes i start to wonder if they really knew what they were sending. usually i am a very bad forwarder.. unless of course something really humourous comes along and i want to share wid my friends and family, but most times i use sms on phones or emails just to communicate, even if its just a hi.. hows u, or just checking on u ... i think that makes more sense .. dosent it? what wid all this technology coming up, with say it better wid a picture stuff.. techie as i am, i dont relate well to those.. my pretty simple mobile has yet many features that i still have to discover..   Just a few days back.. i discovered that my mobile can actually compose tunes.. now why would one want to do that is somthing uncomprehendable for my little brain, but well it does.. so now i go like all excited and happy and show it to one of my better knowledgable colleague.. hey... my mobile can make music, and in return get stared and checked out if i have grown a tail .. not as in the devil .. but as in the our ancestors.. yeah well so rah rah for the dumb me!!! Somehow reminds me of a sentence in my favorite essay.. "Those were the day when the hurries and worries of this materialistic world were foreign to me" .... I would like to rephrase that to " These are the days when the technology and paraphernalia are foreign to me "&nbsp; But i aint ashamed of my shortcomings. And why should i worry about gadgets anyways..&nbsp; I have this cute sweet friend of mine.. swaps.. as i call him, now hes what one would term as "THE technology guy" anything there is to about gadgets, hes gotta know about it, so i get all my gadget advices from, and most times i just blindly follow his advices... hes one bright gadget himself :) smart as ever .. but if i start rambling about that.. i will probably end up writing a book, which i shall be in any event.. so heres an abrupt end to this post while i switch&nbsp; my attention to finding out how to get some sleep with getting noticed he he..

        Started off as a simple resolution to get somethings done today.. well it turned into an ongoing battle against the principles.. well my principles.. never work on weekdays  &nbsp;Well, i am just about done wid it, I guess i put in so much today i dont have to work for another week of weekdays.. so i can relax.. and go back to pretending to be working hard. That bring back to me a thought, Everyone I know is always pretending to be working, so how come any work ever gets done, And if none is getting done, and yet the world is working.. what is that the W word is all about?? I mean why pretend to be working, why dont they just invent some sort of a system and send the salaries home?? at least we can blog in peace, do something creative, like laze around on the bed watching Friends.. its most on my mind, as this tahir guy has lended a few dvds.. which i am trying to fit in my busy schedule of pretending to be working... Hoping to finsih that soon. Fortunately i havent had any trouble from users today.. i think thats a downer.. ye i definately think so, the fun goes out of life if you dont get a coupla incidents like dem. Other than the ms h female and her high heel shoes incident :):) sounds like a fetish ye?? definately tahir would thnk so.. neways, about that later sometime... right now, am just too poofed, actaully havent slept a lot today. So am sleepy tired and hungry all at the same time, but all in all a good day, yeah.. not too happy coz a certain loml dint pop online to say hi, but well, i guess he got busy ya? just so that u would know that u were missed.. righto.. its like bye for now..

       i mean if u really concentrate, u can get involved in a job that earlier u used to think as sukujobs..and dint want to spend even a milisec of ur time on it.. well same wid this zippo thingie. i mean i was bored outta my mind just thnking about it, and here a few hours of really working, i am near about done. thats a human mind for u, and more funnier is.. i havent got up from my desk since a long long time, meaning no troubleshooting no smoking breaks.. only one coffee break.. i am sure everyones wondering whats up wid me.. the office is really really quiet :) aww. i do take a bit of pride of being the life of the office :) which i am.. rest others are zombies.. over worked and stressed, ready to tear their own and others hair at the first sign of a pin dropping.. well i guess thats how normally co-workers are .. i think.. neways, theres this lady called sanam hemani (from hereon refered to as ms.h )in our office.. shes was the receptionist and now has been promoted or demoted cant figure out what.. i think she still does the same job... which i slike to irritate the hell outta everyone.. neways, so she got promoted and now occupies the desk next to me.. now, if u think i talk a lot, u got to have ur head checked.. or have to have a session with ms. h, shes got the most irritaing sound.. like whining all the time, shes a real Stress Puppy ( a term applied to a person who thrives on being stressed out and whines continously)   So Now she comes to the seat next to me, puts on her best whiny voice on and start.. "neha, my faxes are not working, neither is my email.. pls pls pls pls pls help me.. " oh well i say, and start the normal diag series, after about 15 tryouts and a coupla thousand cal spent on thinking about why.. i figure out the problem, she has long high heeled shoes on the end of her long long really long and fat legs, and she rests them on the cpu that is under her desk, now as she dangles her legs.. they pull the wires on theback and lo and behold the network cable has been pulled off..!!! problem solved, solution : leave your highheeled shoes and long legs at home.. DO NOT EVER bring them to work..!! now lets see my managers eyes pop out at that description.. i ahve really filled it out.. :):) lucky me to have such fun at work .. wouldnt any one i mean isnt there anyone who woul dlike to switch places?? pls pls..  taking care of the lions would be certainly a better job.. at least they dont wear high heeled shoes ya??   Okies, its noon and about an hour to go.. got to meet this guy from london today during work, and a lot of my plans are on him. i mean nothing like plan plan.. but well plans.. he he.. figure it out urself.. i am too dumb to even start ...   so  c ya later during the day, while i keep being the good gal.. and work...

       hmm. as expected, coffee works wonders on ones brains.. all the sleepiness gone, have decided to end the zippo thingie today itslef, has been on my in tray for a long time to start rotting and creating a stink.. tho i aint sure if the brand manager isnt stinking as much.. .. also i want to get back to reading the Cluetrain Manifesto....its a book i have started reading.. its totally my kinda book, wid my kinda language.. easy simple and in aphostrphes.:) and since its written by the techie worlds whos who.. i am sure it holds a lot of truth, In fact it started off pretty early as early as the 1999... :0 kinda prehistoric in todays world, but the views expressed about the markets in the manifesto are really really realistic.. as is the manner in which the corporates are exposed, for being the snobs that they really are... in fact i am going to use some of the wisdom it shares.. on a corporate called JUMBO here in dubai, they swiddled me well not me, the firm outta 440 Dhs, not a big amount, but its a matter of honor now.. may swords be drawn to save the honor.. he he.. neways, about that sometime later... till then chill..

       Yet another day.. maybe its gonna turn out the same as yesterday.. i read a message today, where someone is worried about blogging from work, and if the administrator will stop it, Now being an adminsitrator i wonder why anyone would do so, unless of course, they are leaking company info, Yeah.. there are a few companies which are stingy wid their customers, but not actually all of them belong to the same category.. major corporations have a pretty lenient policies, I sure dont deny accesses to a lot of things, of course being in the UAE, the etisalat does that for u :) but if ppl are happy by spending a few moments every hour blogging or emailing .. who am i to stop dem, i guess we spend more time taking coffee breaks as well dont we? neways.. thats a deal the administrator has to deal wid, but ppl should know that the IT dept dosent make the polices, the policies are decided upon by the management... and dont let me start on management.. i guess Scott Adams has said it all.. now. . time for me to get back to work.. so...

       Here goes.. the first user.. Just got a call, " hey see listen, (i seriously wonder for a moment if  i can do both.. i mean see and listen on the phone.. unless of course my company goes for the video phone, but that is another tangent altogether) my outlook is giving me a dambrooo... !!"  Now in case you are wondering what a damroo is.. its a musical instrument, a small drum.. the on see with Lord Shiva, or with Monkey Trainer (Madari - as known in Hindi).   Now for a second i wondered, what is he high on?? then i realise what he is talking about - t the mouse pointer, which normally is an arrow and shows the drum like symbol when is busy.. that was the mystry dambroo.. and here i was, thinking somehow microsoft is trying to rope in more users and loyalty by adding religion to the outlook he he.. nice idea tho what say u???  well in case u are wondering what my reply was "the master adminsitrator reply " restart your system " he he.. gets them everytime...

         In a literal sense it means one who possesses a lot of calves, In relation to Vishnu - one who possesses lots of children, whom He protects like a cow protects its calves. Initial references of these interpretations are connected to the   Krishna  incarnation, where he protected cows and their calves during his childhood.   The second interpretation refers to the innumerable hosts of souls who are to be always tended by Him, like a cow tends to its calves with affection. It is observed by commenter on the Vishnu Shahstranama, that "Bhagvana's guna of being the Protector exhibits itself throughout life. Even before the child is born to a mother, He makes sure that the mother has the milk to feed to the child as soon as it is born, the mother bird and the child bird know how to transfer food through their beak etc."   VS construes that His  Vatsalta (Divine Love)  is not limited to the name. He says that He shall roam behind his devotees, take care of them, feed them and protect them from all sins.   A scene plays in the mind, where during His Krishnaavatar, Lord Krishna saves his devotees (in the form of cows and calves) from Aghasur and takes them to the banks of Yamunaji. Leaving them to graze the green grass on the banks, Lord Krishna settles down with his other shepherd friends to eat lunch. He is putting a morsel of food in his mouth and suddenly hears the sound of a cow mooing loudly, for her calf is nowhere to be seen. Lord  Krishna  puts the food down and rushes to search for the calf, even though his friends insist that he eat and then all shall look for the calf. He assures his friends, Please eat and do not worry, I will go look for the calf and be back. He then proceeds to the mountains and caves to look for the calf. Such is His love for his devotees, for each being that is existing.  The name Vatsi, shows the characteristic of being able to love as well as being loved. At each step of our lives we are face to face with various temptations which lure us away from our Lord. Just like the shepherd runs here and there, in the fields, mountains and caves to look for his cows and calves, who have been enticed by the green grass and water, In the same manner, when we sprint towards materialistic matters and neglect Him for a matter of time, He comes in our wake to find us, to care for us and to protect us. Lord always saves and protects his devotees from the various traps and baits that cross our paths every second.   Another meaning depicted for Vatsi is  "the one who bears the symbol of a devotee".  It is said that Brhighu Rishi had kicked Lord Vishnu in his chest. Lord Vishnu not only forgave him for his peccadillo but also bore his mark on his chest. He demonstrates his love for his devotees by accepting their abuse and forgiving them for their worst sins.  My heart that beats for Vishnu, seeks his forgiveness for following and indulging in various activities that stop me from being with him, chanting his name for every second. I cannot say that I forget him ever, He is always there with me, to the extent of being along with me when I go to work, while I am going for demonstrations, while being stuck in some coding or otherwise. I understand here that He does not want me to leave living, He just wants me to live with quality, and under the guidance of His Divine Love. Wherever it shall lead me, it shall lead only to a peace that I have never known before, an ocean of milkâ¦ where there is knowledge and light and most importantly oneness with my maker, my Vishnu, my soulâ¦ I do not question His presence, I know He is there, and even if I do somehow overlook Him, I am sure He will find a way back into my heart, my life and my soulâ¦ coz they are nor mineâ¦, the life, heart and soul all belongs to Him.     I may think that I am a mere devotee, who is trying to search her soul for some tranquility, but I know, with His love for me is specail, and that makes me special.. I am special, someone specialâ¦

         I seek help, from my father, from my mother, from my teacher, from my family, from my friends, from all those whom I come in contact with, from people I know and don’t know, from the earth, water, fire, sun and moon, from the books that I read, and those that I await, I seek help to know my soul, to be one … to be known…  I found help, from people I knew and don’t, from my father and mother, from my family and friends, and help came forth from the five elements, help flowed from the voice within, and help came cascading out of the book of knowledge, comfort came from within… inside me, where the light has always been, I just needed to look.   I found tranquility, I found liberty from my restricted thinking, I found inspiration to live, to understand, to believe; I found myself strangely curious for more, and more, I found myself on a journey towards my own self, I found myself asking questions and I found myself answering them, I found reason, I found reflection of my self. I found myself open, inspired to probe, dig and rake myself, to discover the truths contained inside me, to realize my existence.  I found a new energy, an original character, a fresh essence. A spirit, which wanted to rise above the beliefs that were handed over to me by my parents and generations, and make way for ones that I discovered, ones that rise from deep within oneself. I feel myself wanting to water the seeds that were planted inside me, even before I was born, I aspired to seek more, to learn more, to see the seeds grow from, to remove the weeds and realize the fruits.  Amidst all the confusion, I again heard the small voice, quite clearly, very near, and amazingly, it sounded so very like my own. It spoke in clear tones, and when I listened, with my heart bent on it, first I found some mystifying vibes, which became apparent as soon as I opened my heart to it. I felt transfixed by the knowledge inside, and eager to gather it all up, and feel the light around me, in person, within.    The knowledge…the wisdom…the Truth.    Strange, how we hide the treasures inside ourselves, and seek for them in the outside. We make tangential issues important and spend precious time wasted on pondering over them, while the truth is enclosed in us, deep yet so shallow that one can peer in, so intense yet so meek, exceptional yet so plain.  I find myself humbled before it, and as I recognize it in its materialistic form, it takes shape of a  red covered book , which contains nothing but the truth, the reality, the certainty of life, form and soul. It binds within its pages the core of the spirit, the union of one soul with the Divine.  Bound within is the love of the Divine for every particle in the universe, the love of a father towards his children. Each time you turn the pages, you find something new, each word meaning something different, each sentence giving out a fresh idea, a simpler meaning.   It's called ''Vishnu Shahastranaama – Ek Antarpravesh".    The prose is in Gujarati, but the language is of truth, the verses are in Sanskrit, but the meaning is simple. Surrender to the divine is complete with each word, with each sentence, page… by the time I reach the end, a new beginning starts, and I embark on a journey that’s never-ending. The experience is illuminating, the ideas inexhaustible. I feel the change, I sense the need to adapt, and I feel the difference as I give way to divine to empower me with the love and security that only a womb can offer.   I feel as if I have 1000 different fathers, to protect, guide and lead me to through my life. The process of knowing each of them is a divine experience in itself. There are a lot of prose, notifications and verses that I cannot comprehend, but I identify with the simplicity of the text and chose to feel beyond the words, hoping to touch the truth somewhere, someplace.   Described in the book are the 1000 names of Lord Vishnu, each with its own significance, each powerful and each as demonstrative in various traits of every being. Some of the names are born out of courage, some out of love, some out of pain and some out of divine being. A shiver runs down the spine as I realize that each of this name, represents me in some or other way, Each has been implanted in me even before I was existing, and will remain so, even after my existence, which will be forever, in one form or other.   My mind takes over for a while and I engage in a an internal argument on the subject of me being an immortal, Me and my soul, two different beings, staying in one body. My soul tells me it will move on, everything tells me it will move on, my body and mind resist, I feel I should have it forever, But not so, to what purpose?? What is ones goal in life? What will the body do, when it's so old, I will not be able to eat on my own, do things on my own, will be dependable on someone?? Then why not make the body so powerful that it will not rot with old age?? No answers there? At least not now, except that there is some truth in the verse in  Bhagvad Gita, "Whoever is born shall have to die'' . At some point, I feel as if blind faith takes over, but its ok for the time being.   At present I am not too interested in immortality. I don’t know what I will do if I get to live forever, yeah, maybe find my way to truth, which is again brining me back to square one. So, choosing to ignore the mind, till I can train it to think the way its supposed to, to let go of the arguments and reasons, all I am going to do is, concentrate on finding the 1000 characteristics that my maker has embedded in me, and hopefully find them all in this one lifetime, most of which I have wasted behind worldly pleasures.   As I travel through myself each day, I know myself better; feel myself better, in some ways change. Sometimes I feel closer to myself, some days distant. Sometimes I understand what I am feeling many days I just spend in a state of confusion, ending up being nasty and rude on the outside, ranting and raving about the injustices handed out to me in life, at work, at home... and so on…   Somedays, I am calm and look upon others as teachers, trying to understand why anything they say, think or do should affect me in the manner it does? And coming to the main question – are they important to me? More than my soul? The answer always is no, nothing is as valuable as I am to myself. So then comes the next question, why waste so much precious time, which u have a very little of to start with, in matters that are so trivial??   I pray for strength to isolate myself and try to utilize all my time getting to know myself and find what I am here for. God says he sent me here for a purpose, I am not out to look for the purpose, I breathe and surrender to his representative, the soul in me, and I think I have served the purpose of being a breathing human being. Rest all is mortal achievements, which will always follow truth. So here I am trying hard to concentrate on what's inside me. And the rest I leave on Vishnu, to guide me to the right path and take care of my worldly health, wealth and daily bread.

         Sometimes I feel alienated from the world, sometimes I just relate to everything in it. Crossing the creek by the small boat, the sun shines too brightly at 7 in the morning, I squint my eyes and concentrate hard on the hanuman chalisha that I am reciting, and suddenly a cloud comes out, I forget the sun, and am able to concentrate better. A chance cloud, nothing to do with me, But I feel as if there is a miracle and that the cloud was around just for me, was it? Who knows, I am not questioning it, it happened, and is happening. Everyday, every momentâ¦ I study, I work hard, I appear for exams and impose a week of mental torture on myself for the results. I pray for good scores, I ask rather demand something materialistic, as silly as good scores. I forget the hard work I have put in the studies, the sacrifices and adjustments that I have gone through to study, and for a while I get distracted from the faith I hold, within myself. The grades are a week late, and during that time I realized that I was barking the wrong tree. Of course I shall score as much as I have worked, yet I worried so much? Yeh.. the scores were declared, I stood 2nd, good work!!! Lesson learned â Never lose faith in yourself, even if you are scared of failing, maybe it was meant so that you appreciate the distinction next time. Not just wise words, they work if you believe in them. Yeah it takes a lot of guts to admit that to myself, and it's ever so easy to wallow in self pity. But is that what I want for me? No, I know not.   There is so much energy within me and sometimes I am unable to tap all of that, busy with logical languages and codes that can make a fire out of black and yellow color. I spent 12 hours on a particular code, but I shy out of spending 12 minutes to listen to myself. Sometimes when I am talking to someone, acting all high and mighty, citing opinions on something or someone, I hear my voice telling me Bah!! Look at you!! A lot you know about the subject/person you are giving opinion on!! I stop talking abruptly, and get some quizzical glances, but I stop. I feel I have not right to give my views on someone/something that I donât know about. What right do I have to act all high and mighty?? Whatever I know, even if it is the truth, what gives me the right to act superior to others? Whereas they might be able to teach me a thing or two? Lesson â look for a lesson in everything, everybody, and everywhere.  Thatâs the truth that everything and everybody is here for just one reason to teach me something. Pain and joy, peace and turbulence, love and hate, passion and apathy, each emotion, represents the person in me, the soul in me, and it is put there, enhanced by the surroundings, may it be people, places or just things. Why else would I relate to the place I stay in as home? Why else would I be so possessive about my computer, my mobile my desk, my clothes and most of all my pencil??   Is possessiveness of materialistic things in any way harmful to me, I guess it is. They preach me about sacrifice, about surrender of your wishes to the Divine. If divine is inside me, Am I not surrendering to myself. Am I not making the sacrifices for myself?? If thatâs true, why should I make them, since it is me who is benefiting from the materialistic pleasures?? Often this question arises in my mind.   I remember one late night of reading the  Ramayana  with my mother, it was a quiet night during the Navratris, and I was reading to her, in spite of having an invitation to party the night out with friends. My mother always wants me to have a good time, so she asked me what kept me in the house, with a book that most of my generation think of as a myth, while I could go out and mix with people my age. I think about it for a while, the thought had never crossed my mind. I mean I have and still do, deny invitations like that, for parties, or rides or just hanging out as they call it, to staying in with a book, or discarding discos to the Ramdhuns, or some or the other path recitals, especially if they are  Sundekanda,  or the  Vishnushahstranama . I dint have a reply to my mom except that I donât know. I just feel comfortable with the spiritual (often closer to religious) world that is inside me and the other world that is outside and around me.   It is not as if I am a forceful temple goer, or idol worshipper. That I am certainly not. I feel as comfortable with being in the temple as to being at home and just chanting Shri Ram Jai Ram Jai Jai Ram while doing laundry or cleaning or studying. I am also contented if I just have a normal conversation, like step into the house and ask noone in general, and to the images of Vishnu that I have in my heart, "So how was your day?? Miss me a bit? Coz I sure did,,,"I havenât set any sort of requirement that I will do so and so path or this and that during the day or night. Except for the habit I have formed of reading at least a paragraph of my favorite book, but that again is at random a name of Vishnu, someone I would like to think about last before my mind surrenders itself to the subconscious. I wonder if this is insanity sometimes, but figure that it cannot, as I have yet to see a negative consequence of my behavior.   I have told by my friends that I should become a ''Sadhvi or a Sanyasi". But well I donât think I need to become one. I am not seeking for any sort of fulfillment except for the sense of peace that prevails within me. I am perfectly at peace with my career, with my life in the present state. I know there are a lot of imperfections that make me what I am right now, But at the same time, I am trying to find a balance between those limitations and the limitless energy that is within me, using it to guide me to someplace, somewhereâ¦ I donât know where, but trust it to take me to my destination.        Asato ma Sadgamaya, Tamso Ma Joytirgamaya, Mrytyor Ma Amrutam Gamaya !!

          Belief:  Acceptance by the mind that something is true or real, often underpinned by an emotional or spiritual sense of certainty.   Each one of us had been brought up with certain beliefs integrated into our timid brains, by our parents, religions, family and so on. Those are their opinions on issues about religion, life and whatâs right or wrong in general. Beliefs are handed to you, some received with doubts some accepted as truth. As we mature, some of us chose to yet follow the beliefs, some chose to ignore them and start afresh, and some like me, try to figure them out, deviate from some and bond with others, and create a want for knowing, coz knowing comes from within, it cannot be second hand.   Speaking of me, I have been brought up by my father, a wonderful teacher, who taught me to first be a nice human being inside, right from my early childhood, I was taught to listen to the small voice inside, and follow it = If you can sleep peacefully after a day of interaction, without having to tuck back a thought, that consider that day well spent!!   I remember a small book given to me, which contained the Hanuman Chalisa and parts of Bhagvad Gita with prose. At the time, it was only blind following of what I was being taught, and probably a thought of it as a hype, but the real world put me straight as soon as I reached my teens.   Tough times have come and gone, and I have made wrong decisions, but never has my faith in my voice gone a decimal lowerâ¦ in fact, with each wrong decision, my acceptance level went a notch up Dark times were around, when I had thrown caution to the wind and went along with the self destructing flow of life, but was rescued halfway, by the beliefs that had set deep inside me. Soul!! Thatâs what they call our inner self, Soul â the little bit of part of our Maker inside us, the most important part of us. As I grown, in spirit, the small voice becomes a bit louder and louder, till itâs the only voice that I ever hear. It is my voice, my soul talking to me, and I chose to listen to its whispers, over the din created by the world around me.  All during my existence, I have wondered who I am, what I am, not in the spiritual manner, but in materialistic world, figuring out where I am supposed to be, and when shall I reach my goal. While growing up, I used to look at my uncles and brothers and see them going to work, struggle with decisions, life in general, I used to wonder it that is what will happen to me. Looking at my aunts, bhabhis and Mom, following their life - Studying and then putting all the knowledge you gained on a shelf, to chose the life of a housewife, stay in shadows to see your family grow, and one fine day, while u are looking at the mirror, at the whites and grays in your hair, wondering where did all the time go?? What did you do? I still wonder if they are happy, a relative term, that differs from person to person. As a person, my definition of happiness is a bit of tears, some smiles, hunger for knowledge, recognizing mistakes, faults and admitting, maybe try to overcome them, and of course a peaceful night of sleep, where u donât have to tuck any thought away!!   A popular statement is, ''If only '', which is heard all throughout our lives. I use it often as well; the most recent being If only I scored high, my life would be complete. Is it?? I scored, is my life any different, I donât think so, in fact I think I will end up working harder than ever, to keep the good scores up, maybe missing out on something while I am out to get something. If only, I would be satisfied with whatever I get. Wise Dr. Dyer writes in his collection: '' you will get what you deserve, no matter what!!" It's preached in almost all the religions. So, work hard or less, you will only get what u deserve, the question here is not Do I deserve? But rather who decides whether I do?   Who does the evaluation for me? Ok, for all the exams that I give, there is a professor who does the assessment for my scores, for all the dresses I buy and wear, I have friends, family and colleagues to judge my appearance I have a manager to appraise all my assignments at work, but who is the judge of my soul, Of my behavior, of my attitude towards life? I am being given several opinions on how best to live my life, what career to take, what dress to wear, what friends to have, what books to read. In the end, they are others opinions, my own?? If I use my right of having my own standpoint towards life's smallest decision â to stay in or go out with friends â If I chose to stay in, I am called a spoil sport and selfish. I am labeled as having attitude problem. Do I really have that attitude problem??   I donât happen to think so, I think I am permitted to have my own approach towards everything, and most importantly, abide by if I chose to, else I wouldnât have been given the means of doing so. I would rather have been born as a vegetable, or as a tree, though on a tangent, they too have their own freedom to express themselves, in whatever way they can.   At times when I start thinking on these lines, I wonder who I should listen to, the voice inside me, or the clatter around me on the outside. They are my well-wishers, they are what I call my family, who stand by me in my sickness and health, in my bad times and good, in sunshine and rain, Is it right for me to ignore them time and again and go on the path that I chose?? Even when experience has taught me that sometimes, Nah. . .many times, I have been wrong?? That it would have gone smoother if only I had chosen to listen to the advice of someone other than me?? Yeah, it would have, and I admit that, so next time I will weigh my pros and my cons a bit more carefully. I turn to the voice within and ask: ''Why did you let me go through all this when it could have been so much easier if only I hadnât listened to you?'' There is silence for a while, and a thought props up, isnât this how it is supposed to be? Dint what happen, happen only because it was supposed to happen? A few tears and bit of pain, are they worth more than the peace you have within? Had you listened to someone, had the results been a shade negative, all I would have done is put the blame on someone else, and would think I am scot-free. Would that make me happier? Would that take the pain and tears away, I guess not.   Bottom line, listen to opinions, share the experiences, but involve your voice, your soul in whatever you do, and follow it, It cannot go wrong, even if at times you feel that it has, it can never, because itâs the voice of your maker inside you, the little part that stays in the background, the unseen director of your life, if only the actor in you would recognize it, learn to follow its leadâ¦ the soul.. my soul and me.. cant say I know it as well, coz I donât even know myself.. but I have pledged myself to it, and look up to it for guidance and light in this passage called life.. !!

          Jale Vishnu, Sthale Vishnu, Vishnu Parvatmastake  Jwalmalakule Vishnu, Sarv Vishnumayam Jagat!!      meaning : Vishnu is in water, in earth, Vishnu is on the mountain top as well.  Vishnu is present in places that are full of lava and flames of hottest fire, The same way, He is present in the whole Universe, Everything belongs to Vishnu.   Though the name Vishnu is commonly taken to denote the second God of the Trinity, responsible for the function of protecting and sustaining the Universe and its beings, it has a more profound meaning which transcends the legends associated with it in mythology.  The word comes from the root verb vyApnoti - meaning, pervades. He pervades the fibre of every being. He pervades everything that you know of or can think of. Not only He pervades everything but He transcends them. The purusha sUkta of the vedas says:  "Sa Bhumin visvata vratva; atyatish tat das angulam"    meaning: He pervaded all the Earth and the Universe and then exceeded it by ten inches. Symbolically it means that He transcends everything. Thus the first two names viSvam and vishNuh of the vishNu-sahsranaMa take care of the 'I" and 'T' (that is, immanence and transcendence) of the TIP of the Iceberg, that is God.   Vishnu is the second of the Hindu Trimurthys (the others being Brahma and Shiva) who presides over the preservation of the righteous and the innocent. Four arms, the left ones holding a Conch Shell and a Golden Mace and the right ones holding a lotus and the fiery Sudarshana-Chakra are characteristic of Vishnu. He is exceedingly handsome, clad in yellow silk, wears a golden crown and sports an enchanting smile. He rides on the robust back of Garuda, half-man-half-eagle and the lord of all eagles. Garuda is also considered the symbol of power in    India  . Vishnu is as loved as Shiva and He is never known to forsake those who love Him.   Vishnu, when resting, reclines on the giant serpent-Adisesha, in the ocean of milk, his abode. Time and again, He has taken âavatarsâ (incarnations) in the world of men to vanquish evil and re-establish Dharma, the Laws of Righteous Conduct. Vishnu, as  Krishna , while explaining to Arjuna the essence of the Bhagwad Gita famously said:   âWhen Righteousness fails and Unrighteousness prevails, I manifest Myself!â     Vishnu, is known by many names. In the Bhagawat-Purana, he claims that   "It may be possible to count the grains of sand present on earth, but it is impossible tocount my names."   Some of his popular names are:   Keshava, Narayana, Madhava, Govinda, Madhussoodhana, Trivikrama, Vamana, Shridhara, Hrishikesha, Padmanabha and Damodhara  .   Vishnu Shahsranama,  a long Vedic prayer literally means "The thousand names of Vishnu". The lord is extolled in its hymns and it is said to have miraculous healing properties when it is chanted with faith.

        Hmm. .mes back.. from a dubai darshan trip, though i lost more water, it was fun meeting kushalbhai, it was like meeting him after about 4 years, a lot has changed, including me and him.. (did i say me?? yeah mes changed a bit, the length of my hair and the size of my waist he he)   but before i go into anything i want to yell out a news... I GOT AN ORANGE LAPTOP BAG .... YIPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!! Rinks are u listening??? Rinks, swaps, raj .. all of u and hey shah, mehta and gundecha family... hear ye hear all... i got an ORANGE LAPTOP BAG.. and its chic.. and its beautiful and i am in love wid it... already.......  For those, who joined in late,&nbsp; I have had this fetish for an orange laptop bag since and long time and i have been like searching it all over, and dint order it from the net only coz the one i liked was horribly expensive.. I have scored all the malls in dubai but never found one i liked, And today i have the cutest orange laptop bag.. thanks to kushalbhai :) i just love him so.. and just for that reason i behaved extremely well and I am sure everyone will be beri proud of me, I dint clown around, i answered all questions truthfully and even agreed to think about moving back to the family.. (psssttt its just agreeing to think about okies, so family dohlings.. dont go gibing high fives just yet .... )   Hmm.. all in all its turning out to be a&nbsp; nice day.. work is ok, hectic as usual, but well thats work.. Okies so now about weekend.. Well i went out on an unexpected long drive with tahir and mr t on thrusday night which was really really nice and entertaining and as usual full of fun.. just the three of us, missed rinks, we four made quite a pair.. dint play antakshari but sang to the songs played on radio and bryan adams.. and some deep meaning music that of course went all over my head :):) all in all a very nice thrusday evening. Friday of course i bunked my classes, and then woke up in the afternoon to settle down for studies, which i did, for a full 10 minutes, before i got involved in this very very interesting conversation with a fellow blogger from dubai, aka Amms, so much so that i quite lost interest in the study and postings and all that, and apart from a few code passings, i just dedicated my time to the dubai blogger. Though I was the one who dominated the conversation, but he was ever so patient and listened to all my siderailings and blabberings and i hereby award him the best listener or reader on the YM.. he even managed to show me a few tricks on the Messenger, like initiate a conference and stuff like dat .. he he.. and he has promised to introduce me to other dubai bloggers and well i can actually attend a dubai bloggers meet as well.. Hmm thats should be fun. :)&nbsp;   And now theres one more person in my world who knows about me, my life and all that is there to know about me :) which aint much if it can fit into about 3 hours of talk ya?? but believe me i ditn leave anything out.. now did i?? hmm i guess i missed the part of moonlighting as a witch sometimes and casting spells.. but i did tell him i was going to be an atma and haunt anyone and everyone .. :) okies, that little detail will be updated to him sooner. And then I met another blogger from sharjah who had to zooommm off for shoppinggg.. hmm am really looking forward to talking realtime wid people whose thoughts and life i have been following for some time..   Strange are the rules of life, you meet so many people, so many new views so much to think about. When i go around the blogworld, i feel lost sometimes and happy most times, lost in the thought about others thinking so much ( he he there goes my thot process.. .. ) but on a serious note, There is so much thoguhts around us, the world is a huge thought factory ya?? imagine if all of us just thought about fun and laughs and letting go and making others lives easier, by keeping ours simpler.. wouldnt we able to throw the negativity out there somewhere maybe to jupiter or saturn.. where they really need something like that?? Hmm now thats quite a long thought for someone like me, so am stopping right HERE!! ..   Neways, now i have to get back to finishing the work that i am being paid for, so will be seeing you guys laterss... actually i feel a bit left out... hmm.. blogging can be addictive he he.. look whos talking   Just a parting note to rinks, i miss ya and will drop in your mailbox sooner.. and hey.. will post a pic of my new ORANGE LAPTOP BAG.. soon :) hey.. also thank your friend at work who was gonna get me one.. huggies and kissies.. :) bye..

        Okies, fellas, you must have been wondering what i have been upto, Ahh well, a crapload of work is keeping me kinda busy, also well, am keeping a low profile at work, which sadly includes no blogging from work as well, coz of the undercurrents that have been going on between two departments. Not that I am directly affected, but its like when i am a bit bugged or sad, it shows and then the family and extended family get worried, and then starts pouring the so called solutions of my so called troubles.. if only.. they werent so helpful, but they are and thanks to them i get tonns of laughter back in my life.. so now.. the way things stand, my nephew Shail and his pals have taken it upon themselves to help me get revenage :) Mind u, Shail goes after his aunt..aka me..&nbsp; hes the no nonsense, you mess wid me i mess wid u more person.. :)&nbsp; But some of the ideas they have been sending&nbsp; me.. ahh god they make me look like an angel with no wings.. oye.. which i am.   So heres the bunch of ideas, cutted and pasted for you.. mind u they all come wid a disclaimer.. I do not take blame for where, why they are or wouold be used, or from where they are inspired.. in short.. dont u sue me for anything.. else i let all of these ppl know your addresses.. !!!   Threaten him with a stick of dynamite. Light a stick of dynamite, then u call the manager and hold the burning fuse up to the phone. Hear that?" you say. "That's dynamite, baby."   &nbsp;- I am not sure this fella is helping me or the manager???? any guesses?? Deepa what are u trying to do kill me??    Write the fellas phone numbers with a I am tracking this note, please call me back !!on every single paper money u spend for a week, leave instruction to whoever u give the number that the 1000 person will get a huge prize and u are 998 :):) in fact write them on ur friends money as well.. he will go crazy when most of the people will call.   - Lucky.. man u are&nbsp; a genius.., though&nbsp; i would have prefered to write number and a single line "I am hot and I am available.. "    Use your graphical skills and make out a letter supposedly from a real doctor at your clinic. It should be about a patient who has contracted aids virus and had named him as a past sexual partner and that he should contact the doctor at the clinic in two days so that arrangements can be made for a blood test.  -  hmm nice one, but cant, its an islamic country.. tho i aint so very sure about the morals ..    One of mine - i would send out a mass email from a fake email address, informing them about a big party at his home with free food and drinks, and to invite as many as friends as they would want. And the D Day, i would be there lurking with my camera to get his expression as hoards of people who would be coming for free food and drinks. I have tried this earlier, back home, on someone from older office, got almost as many as 200 assertive replies.. and man did we have fun.. but the guy isnt speaking to me till date.. sorry pal.. u deesrved it..    Accidently circulate a note in the office mail, a supposedly love letter, propseing undying love and graphical descriptions to the detail of a wild night/weekend spent together, using choices of positions and tricks right out of kamasutra, EXCEPT address it to the person of same sex.. :) making out the person either to be a gay or a lesb.&nbsp;   - he he.. now thats a thought, may use it but not this time..     Go get some shaving cream bottles and leave them in the freezer overnight, in the morning they should have broken open and the foam all freezed out, put hsi on his/her desk and by the time they come it should start melting :) &nbsp; -  cool one, but not useful for me, stored for future use ..     Place an ad in many locations online, or posters or whereever : Lost CAT AED 200 REWARD Put his address and telephone number at the end. It should be as indistinct as possible to ensure a large number of people appearing at the door saying,"I found yor cat. Give me the money." &nbsp; -  this is good, can do many things, like renting out a room :) selling furniture.. heyyyyy this is nice, i may end up using this sometime soonerrrrrrr he he..    Okies, so this has been it, there are a few more ugly ones.. and not fit to be pasted on my clean clean blog :):) ok ok .. euff of the smirks already.. but hey..  this sure puts me in a bery bery good mood.. !!

And then came along the comment from dear  urlLink ZZ &nbsp;  "aaj ka kaam kal karo, kal ka parsun...itni bhi jaldi kya hai yaaron, jab jeena hai barson!"  Now I havent been as impressed with a quote as this one.. so i promptly printed it in color, in both english and hindi, translated it roughly and Posted it on my monitor.. and now i am like the center of attention, the PM asking me to take the rest of the day off, I mean this is heights, so my heartfelt thanks to ZZ for rescuing from being disowned, deserted and hateful..... I just cant thank him enuff..   And then comes this email, with an blinking link and a question "So you born in November and that makes you a ..... ?? And like the curious vella cat that i have been lately, I click and get the above mentioned answers.. so now i am all of that and more.. hmm.. i never knew i could find so much about myself just surfing the internet.. tch tch.. meri sari online zindagi pani mein gayi hai.. and here i was thinking being online is like work work and more work :) well as they say in hindi.. der aaye dursaat aye.. aaye to sahi.. so heres to more funstuffing and quizzing .. and getting to know myself bettering...

                  &nbsp;A parting post.. do I have time for it, ahh well, what the heck, thereâs always time for myself isnât there??         This is what my last thoughts were yesterday before leaving work, sadly, couldnât post, just had enuff of the computer and the idea of beating the rush hour traffic and getting home was too lucrative. PD is back and that ends my bus stint, which was horrible, ahh the small luxuries that u get used to, ok ok so noone said I am perfect, I do like being driven to and froâ¦          &nbsp;     Yeah.. also wanted to say hi to everyone.. havenât had much time to talk to anyone, since yesterday, more or less have been the hard working neha.. feel bad for the family as well, for all the time I stay online, I hardly spend any time with any of them, except when its like for a quick hi and bye.. so hey , all of u it was nice to have the gang around yesterday morning, and wish I could have participated in the chats. But I am there spiritually and virtually.. he he..          &nbsp;     Hmm on a siderail (ye.. again by now u can rename me the Neha Siderail Express.. he he) Yesterday afternoon I had gone to the cafeteria with tahir and mr t. Its different here in Dubai, esp with this malbari cafeteria, which is just that, a place where u get tea coffee, ayapuum.. or whatever. Yeah there are still a lot of people who use it as a meeting place. but not quite like it used to be in the indian road side kittlies and dhaba..          &nbsp;     Thinking back on my struggling days as a creative person, me and my teams definition of a cafeteria went as a traditional meeting place for most of the grapevine, its stems and branches extending tenuously to every section and department, every office in every building in the vicinity. Few events that occured in all of these small and big offices, shops and clinics, like promotions, scandals, firings and hiring, are not known and discussed in the&nbsp; cafeteria long before official word is ever published or made public.         Many of us used the cafeteria for what is termed as CC â Curbstone Consultations, not only with colleagues from our own meatspace, whom otherwise we would&nbsp; seldom see except at a tea or coffee break, but also with people from other offices, esp the IT department and a good deal of serious business would be transacted over a few tables and sips of coffes, which officially would have been followed by a substantial bill.          &nbsp;     Mostly a visit to the cafeteria has as much to gain as to lose and a good many of us around here used this mildewed quip on leaving their contact point âif you want me, Iâll b in my second officeâ Normally no further explanation is required or given. It was also one of the democratic areas, where ranks and positions if not forgotten, were at least temporarily ignored and all and sundry would get down to being a basic human being. Personal lives would be discussed, preferences made public, choices and plans made for the various activities outside work, in short it was one big happy place to be.          &nbsp;     Its different here in dubai, firstly a gal going out with guys at work to a malbari cafeteria is kinda looked upon, secondly its no fun sitting on the tables alone as well. I mean there are so many people and we always manage to find some fun in them, and though most of us are hindi bhashi, Indian and at max pakis, it just isnât the same as in like the Indian chai ki kittliâ¦.. thereâs gossip and thereâs meeting the people from oder offices as well, but thereâs like no rappo like we have back home. Its all very controlled. Oh yeah, there would be some with the guys only team, but sadly I donât find that exciting, the double standards. Ahh,, well once my personnel manager caught me sitting at the cafeteria with a few coll and he goes like tch tch.. not good for u, go to office and order from there. Ahh well, as if I was just dying for the rainbow milked coffeeâ¦. I go out just to refresh my mind, to look at people, but since then I have taken to go and talk to the fishes in the fish tank downstairs when I want some reliet from the sometimes ahem!!! Most times monotonous work that I keep doingâ¦ and ye.. like tahir says, me fishes.. they went to convent schools and they DO understand every single word I say and that too in English or hinglish..         (an inward thought -&nbsp; I think betsy.. she understands French as well )          &nbsp;     Ye. I have named them all, theres rocket, betsy, flora, goldie, lazybum, and so on.. got 14 of dem.. they are kinda cute, and to think I never liked fish.. till I got here, ahh changes and the way u adapt to dem.        Hmm so inst this like starting to go to Delhi and ending up in Kanyakumari???&nbsp; From family to cafeteria to fishes.. oh well shows how much I need my coffee.. so am taking a bit of pity on you guys.. I mean I just have to write this YOU are ones who have to read it, ok ok so thatâs also a choice.. neways, me going off for a long coffee break and will c ya in the evening..          &nbsp;     BTW, works a lot hectic than I would have liked it to, so much so, I aint getting time to talk on the intranet as well.. ahh.. well the sooner I finis it the sooner I will be free for some more.. eh.. what did I just say.. make that a visit to the looney hospital, mes gonna get myself committed before I do more damage to myself.. he he.. ok ok me going byeeeeeeeeee

         Okies for the rest of my world its funday.. so they are having fun, I got a close circle of family and family friends on my yahoo msgnr. With family friends I mean people like Vish ÃÆÃÂ¢ÃâÃâ¬ÃâÃâ who is my cozÃÆÃÂ¢ÃâÃâ¬ÃâÃâ¢s bossom buddy but cares more for me than my coz, and then there is Kritikabhabs, who is the wife of the friend of my family doctors daughter, and theres kushal who is my brothers friends younger brother.. I guess u get the drift ya????        &nbsp;     Now a great bunch of dem are bored and since we have exhausted the topics of whos going out with whom, who is having a career change, whose babies are walking crawling learning to say DA DA!! Which kids are going from just adorable &nbsp;  kids to impossible teenagers, which bhabhi is sporting which haircut and how ugly she looks, and also discussed the various economies of the world and the weather in terms of being able to go shopping in various towns of the world     &nbsp;     Now they have indulged in something as silly as messing around with the Yahoo Messenger. Now for all the internetting that I do, I have yet to master the messengers. I use them for just that, Messaging, All the rest of the features like the IMviornment and other stuff is still in the greek and latin category and I would definitely like to keep it that way. The lesser I know, the better off world is. Neways, so here they are a group of people, all ages, sexes and types.. ye including some pets (who I think are wiser than the owners, but&nbsp;that's &nbsp;entirely my thought process which is like about a million steps behind to others of the human kind.. again a side rail, I keep doing this dont i??) &nbsp;  Ahh well, so now they as in my F &amp; F F are playing the game called Coming up with silly status messages, and mind you, I wouldn't have made a post outta this if it hadn't had me wanting to laugh out loud.. only.. the managers back.. so can't     &nbsp;     Neways, some of them are total pakau.. so me thinks.. why me alone?? Lets all get pakaofied together.. after all we are .. one for all, all for one ya??      Here goes,        &nbsp;     Btw, I am a spectator with just one message..  I have gone to Save the planet; after all it's the only one with internet!!      &nbsp;     The rest have all gone berserk..        &nbsp;      I'm lost. I've gone to look for myself, so if I get back before I return, please ask me to wait.  &nbsp;&nbsp;-  Kritika bhabhs     &nbsp;      Sorry, I died a week ago... &nbsp; - wouldnt he wish.. his sons going to colleage next week      &nbsp;      I'm lost.

I mean, it's like, who wants to sit there and read this entire thing where, if written down on paper, would take up a tree's worth of paper? I know I don't! Long away messages are tedious, unfunny, and stupid, and you wonder what on earth is wrong with the person writing it. I mean, it's like, must there be this long of a message to get the stupid point across? How hard can it be to say, I'm away? Honestly... &nbsp;   &nbsp;- ha ha.. this takes the cake from our ever so very serious Gagganbhaiya.. wonder if his working for Microsoft has anything to do with this sadist message.. !!!      &nbsp;     Ok fellas..

       NowÂ¡Â¦s the chance for all those who envied me lounging in my PJÂ¡Â¦s over books and great music and i am sure no one envied me my date with the cleaning equipment he he.. , to get back at me, while they enjoy two days of fun and rest, while I pittar patter at my workstation.    As usual thereÂ¡Â¦s a lotta gir gir.. and add the renovation noises from next door, its like working in the middle of a war zone, except I am the most peace loving person ÆÂº all for world peace and everything.   It was the Accession day yesterday and since it fell on a Friday, the holiday is carried forward today, resulting in most of the offices in Dubai being closed for the day.. meaning a long extended weekend for them, not ours though, we are not part of the UAE ÆÂºÆÂº just kidding, wouldnÂ¡Â¦t know what to do at home neways.   But I sure am glad and thankful to His Highness Shaikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, for his vision and leadership, else I wouldnÂ¡Â¦t be instilled in this office, in my quaint little corner, in front of my pc and blogging away to glory.. ahh well, if I hadnÂ¡Â¦t been here in this corner, I would have been somewhere else.. but blogging away to glory is a certainity. ÆÂº  Okies, so now its time to plug in the extension again and get ready for a steady stream of troubleshooting calls.. Which are sure to start, coz I am unable to log in to my citrix servers.. ahh.. well the start of a great week with a greater trouble.. so heres to seeing you later..

Mind you getting a driving license in    dubai   is like worse than trying to get into bed with tom cruise hmm I wonder how that came up.. neways, so he goes like why donât you drive as well?? Now that brings me to a thought, I mean I do drive and I am a very safe driver.. oiii I am..         &nbsp;     But given the fact that me sitting on the driverâs seat immediately invalidates my insurance, (a zen branch of related algebra asserts Neha + steering wheel + accelator = kid + hammer + landmine, by the way, this algebra was inspired, not original ) neways, so I think about the pros and cons of me getting a driving license that will unleash me on the roads of dubaiâ¦. I guess. The traffic department has enough to worry about.. hasnât it?? I am sure they have.        &nbsp;     They can do without me driving slower than a snails pace when minimum limit is 80, when I donât cut anyone off, but maintain my lane.. even though itâs the fast one.., When I donât cut an green signal .. let alone a red one, and they can do without me following every rule in the rulebook published not only in   dubai  , but globally.. even to the instruction manual that accompanied my washing machine.      &nbsp;     And coming to think of it, I hate parking, and I hate to wait for parking, so that kinda makes the decision for me. And when I have so many people who can take me wherever I want to go, which is nowhere most of the time, why the heck do I need to spoil my sleep over a VALID UAE DRIVING License? Hmm.. khurram says it looks good on the resumeâ¦. Hmm.. logic?? No way..      &nbsp;      Neways on this weird thought.. me is off for the day.. and will be seeing you from home.. au revoir!

          Morningsssssss.... God I am in high spirits today.. :) and dont go on asking why..          &nbsp;      Today at least i know if i give my resignation i can always go into the towing business.. :) but hey rinks, for a moment there i was scared, so next time make sure the cars in pick condition ya?? like there are things called service stations which do JUST that.. SERVICE.. u kapish??         &nbsp;      Yesterday had a visit from hi and tapu after a long time, (hi is a cousin who works here in    dubai   and tapu is his colleague, and I being hi's sister... i am the universal global sister.. Ahh.. talk about being sister material.. Me fits the description to the boot.. ) neways.. since they were visiting, and  &nbsp; they brought their own dinner, I settled down for a comfortable chat and to enjoy their then things got a bit funnier... ah well.. at least i thought so.         &nbsp;      Tapu bought a mobile phone the other day. Yes, I'm aware that this revokes his human rights and I won't disgust you further by attempting any kind of persuasive explanations. We all grow to be what we hate (which gives rise to the very disturbing possibility that one morning I'll wake up to discover I'm Cleopatra and already dead... &nbsp;  but let's avoiding looking there mind you i donât hate Cleo... its the dead bit that i am concerned.. )         &nbsp;      Neways, it seemed that Tapu had spent the best part of an afternoon entering the names and numbers of people he know into the internal address book via the phone's keypad - an activity that's roughly as much fun as performing emergency dental surgery on yourself and much much more painfulâ¦         &nbsp;      Now he has this notion, let me add suicidal notion, to show me the new phone, So i go 'Okies, Let's have a look at your phone.' 'Don't touch anything,' he warns with somber severity. About two minutes later when he returned from the kitchen with a coke, I glanced up at him and ask chattily 'Can you get back things that you've deleted?'         &nbsp;     That comment  &nbsp; turns his lips into the thinnest of the lines., Since I donât not know what I have deleted, how i have deleted, even without the slightest  &nbsp; intention of deleting anything, I offer a solution, 'Tch, you'll find our eventually if its that important.'      &nbsp;      He looked at me speechless, obviouslyâ¦ thinking that this phrase would be good to recite as a chant in a singsong fashion, as he danced around a lighted bonfire, with me in the center......burning burning.. burning.. ok ok.. so that were his sentiments i think..         &nbsp;     Of course me being the cute sisterly thingie that cooks dinner for them and makes hot hot roties and bhindi ki sabji at all times of the day and night... He cannot put his fantasies to work :):) though he did argue to the fact that I had deleted something, maybe an important number, without even knowing what it was...     &nbsp;      Now if i knew it would be deleted.. would i do something like that?? would &nbsp;  i ?? nah.. never.. he he.. yeah.. i mean it i would never do anything like that, esp after tapu having spent hours on feeding the information and specifically instructing me not to touch anything.. Ahh well.. he shouldnât have given the phone to me in the first place..         &nbsp;      But then i sum all his anger, frustration and exasperations up with a 'You know what the trouble is? You're a gadget freak.'        &nbsp;     Now that was testing the limit of tolerance for a man if that was what it was !! So sue me, I was born with a peanut for a brain. But coz of my gallant craving to further the vocabulary of medical science, it would delight me to the tip of my hair if everyone could adopt the use of the phrase âNeha's Syndrome'. This can be used to indicate a condition characterised by a profound and chronic 'point blindness', of which the fellow earthlings around me happen to think I serve a perfect example.. ( I think I am justified.. oh well.. !! whatever !!)      &nbsp;       The above incident was a case study to help the research..           &nbsp;        Ahh.. the injustice..

        Anxiety in my mind causes tension in the body; I become petrified and begin to groan. Anger at something turns my eyes red, temptation of food causes mouth to water. Obviously mental tensions affect the body. Someone told me one can go to any extent in love and war i.e. in the mental states of attachment and malevolence. Does this mean that devotion and faith also affect the body?? The Human Body?? Can they be dismissed as incapable of helping my morale??  I read somewhere: Devotion and faith can calm down your body, impart clarity of vision to your mind, enhance you intellectual power say by 200 or even 300 percent; turn your ego inert and remove ignorance layer by layer.    Devotion&nbsp;  It helps me overcome my feelings of helplessness and dependence on others, it helps me destroy the impurities in my mind. It brings about chemical transformation in the physical body as well, which helps in turn to cleanse the squalor that I keep collecting. Devotion removes all hindrances and destroys disease and agony.    Faith  in Vishnu, my soul, my God, helps me cleanse my heart. Lust is replaced by equanimity, anger by indifference, illusion by clarity of vision and greed by contentment. It is impossible to live in absence of faith even for a moment.   Devotion and faith are two basic elements of life. We are led to believe that our mother is really our mother and the man introduced to us by our mother as our father is our father. We have to keep faith in the barber, the cook, the caretaker and the doctor and so on. They are two mental phenomena which find succor in God, yet develop into very powerful forces in themselves. They become instrumental in releasing me from fear, ignorance and duality of perception.   I keep absolute faith in Vishnu, my soul. He showers his celestial love upon me, dancing around me and reassuring me of his presence every single moment. I seek his assistance in liberating myself from the clutches of worldly concerns and visualize in the depths of my consciousness the supremely aesthetic play of Vishnu. I seek to redeem my prejudices and barbarism caused by illusion for the faith and love of Vishnu.   I fight to rid myself of the tragedy that has been, that my vision has been limited and captive of the narrow world I have created for myself and to which alone it remains tied. I want to rise above the talking about someone I knows children, of my brothers and nephews, and of the rich persons who live in my neighborhood, and of the handsome young men. My thinking has become too narrow and I want to liberalise it, and I look to devotion and faith in my lord to help me do so. My belief in God.. I look upon to take me closer to Him, as he is the only one who is so very near, that he dwells in my soul. He is there from where my speech emerges. He is there from where all my thoughts arise. He is there from where I peep outwards through my eyes, I believe in the existence of Vishnu with a heart full of his devotion and faith in Him.   I argue, and then there are counter arguments, guesses, reliance on skillfulness and patronage of the worldly great, all of which can never bestow peace on me. Apprehension and fears keep lurking in the mind and haunt it. Anxieties may keep the heart burning like a funeral pyre. Memories of the past shall over cloud the mind and leave behind a painful and pensive imprint upon it. I know that anxiety about future shall torture the mind and frighten it.   Amongst all this my Faith in Vishnu aids me in moments of unbearable pain and agony. Faith in Him remains with me as the greatest support everywhere ÃÆÃÂ¢ÃâÃâ¬ÃâÃâ in life, at work, at home, in loneliness and in the midst of my foes and friends. Faith and Devotion, it's not something they can teach us, its not something to be learnt. It's already learnt, I love god as I love myself. I feel this intense urge to unite, and a constantly growing sense of fulfillment.   I  pledge myself to... Vishnu, my soul, and my devotion and faith in him to lead me to Him.

        Ever wondered about the how most of the UAE expats get breakfast at work ???  Went out to have tea with tahir and mr t, felt good to see the sky at this time of the day, though its awfully hot out there. These are wonderful places these cafeterias in dubai. Every nook has a couple of them. Mostly Mulbary cafes, no offence meant, but thats what they are called... they say if they decided to throw the mulbaris out of UAE, the whole of the country would be empty save a few thousand ppl. They top the population stats here.  Most of the cafes will have a coupla mulbari guys working around the clock, making tea, coffee, burgers, pakodas and puris and stuff. Our cafeteria also has an all mallu staff. The best part is, these people teach you management and forecasting. I mean if you want a muska bun and coffee for breakfast tomorw.. (eesh.. the adhik month has started and mes fasting..boo hoo.. so hungry i am.. hmm the first few days are always troublesome, will settle down later.. oh, this was a long siderail.. okies back to the mallu train) So like i was saying, if you want breakfast tomorrow, you have to order it today, well in advance, else you may end up living on love and fresh air.. We have our own set of woes.... But since i am being paid exclusively to order breakfast here, its part of my job.......which i do very religiously every morning..   I pick up and dail 2211599 , ( I have to confess to this, i cannot remember numbers for the life of me, not even my own, but this number is like.. even if u wake me up in the middle of the night with a hose , pouring water over me, i would go.. 2211599 )   Me: Hello Cafe Man (CM) : Hello, ah.. endevisheshan.. euro mein? kya chaiye? Me: Sukham , or Dukham... i want coffee, shakkar jyada and a muska bun,  CM: Shakkar jyada nahi na khane ka.. (god i am drinking the sugar not eating it re) bimar ho jyayega Me: Ha no problem, at least chutti to milegi CM: thumhare office mein chutti nahi deta, humko bhi chutti nahi hai ( as if all i ever wished for was a date with a mallu cafeteria guy..) Kya kerega thumko chutti lekar? Me: send me my breakfast like now CM: woh to jaldi ayega ( huh??)  Me: Clean the toaster before putting my bread in CM: (Indignantly, acting offended) maaadam, humhare toaster roz clean hota hai.  Me: Ye ye.. i know thats the reason i had an egg shell with my muska bum yesterday.. CM: he he he.. woh kabhi kabhi aisa ho jata hai da, (they end every sentence with DA, kaha hai da, kya kar raha hai da, marta kyo nahi da, and so on....) Me: thik hai thik hai, sendofy SLAM!! i put the phone down..  And then begins the tasks at hand... call up every 10 minutes to find out if the breakfast is ready and when it shall be delivered. Oopss.. i forgot to take the tracking number... And well if i am successful and the stars are good and in a mood to shine on me .. i shall get the breakfast by about 4 pm.. else, maybe next morning. .... No re.. i am not kidding, this is what happens here, almost in all mulbari cafeterias..   I used to wonder how he knows i am calling from euro, but then figured out, if you hear a persons voice almost like every 10 minutes for the rest of life... you ought to know who it is ye?? Sometimes i think he (btw his name is Ismail) answers every call at 10 minutes interval with " baas bhejtha hai euro baas bhejtha hai"  They also have this habit of adding TH to everything. Like Tumhe in hindi .. becomes THUJHE, not that their english is good as well, Most of the people in my office, they can give any grammar school a run for their prepositions, tenses and well almost everything.. Me i aint worried a bit about it, my school warranty ran out the moment i stepped outta school.   Neways, some days we are lucky and get breakfast on time, which is the time i wonder whether this is todays order or day befores.. and sometimes it even tastes like day befores..... so much for breakfast being the essence of a day..   :) But i must admit, if you are ever bored, or feel lonely, just go to a cafeteria, get a cup of coffee skhaar jyada, (ah well, i may as well, as i am bound to have diabetes anyways) and observe the happenings at the cafe.   Some Irani guy would walk up and say, tumne humara behan ko pilya hume bhi pilao.. whatever that means. Our cafeteria has a lot of people sitting there all the time, but it makes real good business. And well, for us, its a few minutes of peace from the official work :):) ye.. ye... ordering and following up on breakfast..   But like i mentioned earlier, am gonna be fasting for a while, so its one less duty :) but i would really like to open one of this small quaint thingies.. and sit and watch while all the mallus are runnign around .. doing all the work.. he he.. and i will go on the phone.. ye ye.. hsbc wait abhi bhejtha hai...

        Monday, July 19, 2004      Something out of my mailbox.....   When Indians speak English, it isn't usually the way the Americans do! So we all know about the Malayali who `zimbly' crossed the road and went to `my koledj on San Pedro." And the Gujarati who ordered a `plat of snakes' at a Mexican restaurant. And the Sardarji who said he used to drive a `Mrruti 800' in India. And, of course, the Punjabi guy who wanted his passport 'wallidated' and wanted to get 'waccination for malaria' because he was ready to go on ' wacation owerseas.' And, yes, the Bengali who lost all data on his computer because he didn't `shave' them...   English, is a funny language. We can all "talk English, walk English, laugh English," as Big B (Amitabh Bhachan) said in some movie, but, let's face it, the English we speak is not always King's (or Queen's) English. English language, along with Hindi, is probably what bridges several diverse Indian communities as the most convenient means of communication among us. But English attains a comical effect when used by most of us (including Chandu) who belong to different "regional ethnic" groups within the Indian community. Hampered by strong mother-tongue "interference," we struggle with alphabets that either twist our tongue or slip across it, thus screwing up the pronunciations some times.   We all know that certain communities are not quite comfortable with certain alphabets. Maharashtrians seem to have a problem with the alphabet F, while they also share an almost equal aversion to anything sounding `sh' with the Gujaratis ("the robber 'sot' him in the head). So there's this Mahrashtrian, Mr Patkar (or whatever other 'kar) who is totally `conphujed' while philling out his club membership `pharm,' while Mr Patel is unhappy when the waiter at the Mexican restaurant told him that they do not serve "snakes."  Some have a fixation with a particular alphabet. Like the Malayali who likes to emphasize the `r' and complains about the poor `waterr' supply in his aparrtment building. Poor guy, he doesn't get enough to bathe with his phavorite `Lex' soap. And, mind you, he is highly qualified, otherwise - has an 'Yum A' (MA) in literature! By the way, Y is a favorite alphabet, whose popularity cuts across all South Indian communities, especially since they aren't very fond of alphabets M and E. So don't be surprised if you encountered anybody from South India who's seen a strange movie called Yenter The Dragon.   But when it comes to who's the boss, the Tamilian swears by his `bass,' while the Malayali sticks to his `bose.' The Tamilian, you see, loves the sound of a `ya' or `aa' at the end  of a sentence. "Ready-aa?" he asks (he really is not trying to say Radia, believe me!). All he is asking is "Are you ready?" On the other hand, the Malayali may prefer to ask things  in a negative tone - "It's very hot, no?" But the Gujarati from Ahmedabad loves to put an 'e' at the end of words, especially if there is an 'A' somewhere in the middle of that word. So he may shock you some times when you call him around Christmas time and ask him what he is upto and he says, "I am raping the gifts." And then at home in India, this Gujarati woman is telling their neighbor, "Maro dikro states ma udi gayo." It takes the neighbor a while to realise that her son has not flown to the US, but has simply failed his stats (or statistics) test at school...   And, please, don't get mad at me. My objective of "littering" around so many examples about the usage of English by different Indian regional ethnic groups is not to make fun of them. It is just to show how Inglis, while an integral part of our daily life in America, has been moulded ('mauled' might be more appropriate) to suit cultural convenience and basic communication requirements of our diverse population. How we all - whether Sindhis, Biharis, Kanadas or Goans or whatever - talk in the Queen's language is often a source of entertainment.   Indian Inglis is here to stay as long as "new" Indians keep coming to this country. I have not lived in India at all (have been there only three times in my life time so far) but even in Africa it was the same situation with us Indians. A number of Indians I have met tell me that they were educated at 'convent' schools in India - whatever that means - and that they speak better Ingils than other Indians who did not go to 'convent' schools. But when I ask them how their parents are doing or something like that, they always seem to say, "pulling on well." Surely, our parents are not a pair of bullocks? And then they ask you whether we are keeping good health. We don't keep good health, we enjoy it.   Well, hope you are not mad at me. Now, go on, Gujarati guy order a 'pijja' from Pijja Hutt and take a bite of your 'pijja' while telling your son not to listen to the `pope' music at all times.  `Wokay?'

        Mornings...    After 2 weeks my life is back to ???? well maybe normal..... or is it ?? Nah..it isnt, much more emptier, But its time i applied the part and package of life wisdom to myself. So well, the family left in the wee hours of friday morning... when i stood and watched my life walk away from me, waving one step at a time, tears flowing and a pain in the heart and trying to act mature and adult. All i wanted to do was to say khali vali to the job and everything else in thego along with them... Then the guys dropped me home, and it wasnt home.. it was so empty, that for the first time in my life i dint feel it was my favorite place in the world.  A person makes so much of difference in your life. From being the contended and happy creature of existance, Just a few days with rinks has turned me into a demanding more outta life person. Not in any other matter, just in terms of spending more time like eternity with rinks. All i have done since yesterday is keep saying rinks i miss you and listneing to our fav numbers of westlife.. and then again in the evening it was back to the stupid computers... me on one and she on other.. two ends of the world.   Fortunate to have met for a few days, and spent time together and man what a time.. It was fun in india last time, but it was better here, And it was family fun as well. Partying, shopping, and in general having fun. The last time i had been to a disc was like when i first came here and they took me partying. Not that I dont like it, But it just aint my scene. I was happy listening and dacning to the same songs at home :) i guess the lights and jazz put me off.   Ahh.. well, meatspace sounds horrible right now, too much gir gir and too many people and none of my favorite.. ughhhh.. neha.. get out of the gloom.. lifes not at an end, thers tomorrow.. ye.. theres tomorrow.. and am gonna spend a great today so i can look back and say.. ahh.. what a great day i had !! Ok.. enuff of the missing and sadness.  One two three four five six... am counting my blessings, which are endless ... and picking up where i left my life 2 weeks ago, And putting a counter on again.. for the nex time i can get together with rinks. Should be soon, like in a coupla years. Oh well i knwo i just promised not to go into this routine.. but hey me is only human... !! aint I?? ok so will try harder.... and thats a promise. Right?? happy??   *trin trin *Saved by the phone..... an urgent WH call.. (waster hour/s - meeting/s) :) so gotta rush.. and hey.. love you all.. leaving you with the hummmss of westlife.. which is gonna be the theme and only song for the next few days .. unless of course anyone would be interested in "lets talk about sex baby!!" he he.. .. kidding re kidding...    Some find it sharing every morning Some in their solitary lives You'll find it in the words of others A simple line can make you laugh or cry  You find it in the deepest friendship The kind you cherish all your life And when you know how much that means You've found that special thing You're flying without wings....... I am flying without wings.

        Wednesday, July 21, 2004      Good morning, good morning, its a great day today .   I'm ready for work are you ready for play? Are you ready to play? The duck goes quack quack, and the cow goes moo, and old Mr rooster says cock a doodle doo, and the sheep says baa, and the cat says meow, and I say good morning when I see you!! Good morning friends!  Happy attitude?? yeah.. sort of. Not that anything has changed in my world, except have decided to sniff sulk and cry after rinks leaves and not before that .. Till than its totally fun time. Got my leave sanctioned for a WHOLE DAY for tomorrow.   Nothing much happening, cool evening yesterday at home. Mr. T had taken the kids to Wild Wadi, a water entertianment park, really fabulous if u happen to like water, They were in thre for about 9 striaght hours.. gosh.. thats saying something.. Neways, they came back all zapped out, so just caught up with dinner and then home.Spent the rest of the evening talking and ended up falling asleep while others talked into the night. Woke up to find that the guys had decided to shack up as well, so it was like a task getting all of them to get up and get ready to come to work, barely made it within the grace period though.   Neways, work has been hectic but smooth. Nothing much happening. Some hue cry over emails, remembered has disconnected the exchange server, so connected it again... no reaction on the I M WATCHING message on the intranet.. guess noones just bothered. Hmm.. okies, lets see, am gonna leave dem goonks alone for a while, at least till saturday.. then i shall kick up some sand... afterall my meatspace can never be so dull now can it??   hmmm. so its like getting back to the tasks on hand for me.. and well c ya when i c ya.... had some arabic kawa ...yucksss. it tastes so bitter, shucks.. if only i hadnt been fasting, i couldhave gone down for a pastry.. will have make do with plain sugar for now..

        Tuesday, July 20, 2004     Mornings..   Lost In Love (Russell - Air Supply)  I realize the best part of love is the thinnest slice And it don't count for much but I'm not letting go I believe there's still much to believe in  So lift your eyes if you feel you can Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan I figured it out What I needed was someone to show me  You know you can't fool me I've been loving you too long It started so easy You want to carry on  Lost In Love and I don't know much Was I thinking aloud Fell out of touch But I'm back on my feet Eager to be what you wanted  So lift your eyes if you feel you can Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan I figured it out What I needed was someone to show me  You know you can't fool me I've been loving you too long It started so easy You want to carry on  You know you can't fool me I've been loving you too long It started so easy You want to carry on  Now I'm lost, lost in love, lost in love, lost in love Now I'm lost, lost in love, lost in love, lost in love  Lost in love, lost in love, lost in love Lost in love, lost in love, lost in love  Dunno why, but this song was playing and i wrote it all down, nah.. no copy paste from a lyric site, but typed it all out, maybe coz i needed something to do. Just feeling a bit down under today.. not that it has anything to do with anything, Just one of those days, when u suddenly start missing people, places, things... when suddenly all you want to do is get on the top of the highest mountain and cry out loud. Ok well, lets make it the longest desert, but then again i would get lost.. and then the lost in love would be replaced by really lost in desert.. A faint attempt at humour, sick joke, shows how sad i am.. Or am I?? yeah, i am... so help me my soul, to rise above and accept what fate is handing me out...  People come and people go out of our lives, that is what i have been told. That is what i have read, and to a certain extent have come to believe that. But just sometimes the knowledge takes the back seat and allows the heart to pain and tears to fall, for that someone special who is so very dear to you.  I am fortunate that i have someone to dot and love in rinks, who has nothing to give me and in turn i have nothing to give her, in all materialistic ways, but yet, we are so very much bonded, that it takes a piece of my heart out when the days of her returning back to her life are nearing. Two weeks.. they shall be over in 2 days, and then again God Only Knows how many more days weeks, months and years will go by before we shall meet if at all. Not that we cannot, but our schedules and lives make it tougher...   We have had so much fun in the past few days, I am seriously wondering how i lived my life when she was not around. We are up almost till the time comes to leave for work, and then again spend every possible moment on the phone. Now its just two days, that i will be able to see her, feel her and talk to her. So many joys have been shared,so many pains have been talked about, and most of all, so much love has been given and taken, that i feel just outta world right now.   God puts you in so many phases of life and emotions, sometimes its a roller coaster ride and sometimes, just a plain simple ride through the country, soft and easy... and the balance between all this is what your inner peace depends on. I wish i was a bit more adaptive to the changes in my life, and learn to acknowledge them as and how they happen...   hmmm.. okies. enuff of soul searching for a while, and getting back to work thingie.. Oh dear!! am so very hungry i could eat the universe, but then ..... what would i do without one?? ok idea cancel.. me ordering some juice .. so c ya laterzz.. in a happy mood..

       Days come by and they go, When will the pain stop? I never will know. If only you knew how i feel The love i have for you is real. The hurt and pain in the nights i cried, Only you can make it right. Even though we're far apart, You're still here, Lingering in my heart. Too many things remind me of you, I wonder if this happens to you too. I've tried very hard to let you go, But i found my heart won't let me so. Memories are all that i have now, Of the days that we once shared. Every night i quietly pray,   That one day we'll be together again.   Its a promise.. ...

        Sunday, July 25, 2004        HAPPY BIRTHDAY RINKS..        Have you ever felt like you knew someone a long, long time ago? Another place, another time, a union of the souls? Two people who share a bond for reasons neither know, A feeling that they were kindred, a long, long time ago?  Did they stumble onto each other by pure circumstance, Or was it fate and destiny that played a certain hand? Two souls intertwined, they are worlds apart, But the soul, it knows no difference, in matters of the heart.  Somehow they are drawn together, fate has brought them back, Each living worlds apart, they journey separate paths. When this life is over, and a new life begins, Their souls will find each other, two souls that we call friends.     Special day today.. its rinks birthday.. So heres wishing you a very very happy birthday. Prayed today for you to have the light lead your path through the tunnel of life, and that love and support of family friends and the divine pair of vishnu and ma look over you every moment of your being.    I dont know what it is that keeps me awake at night... I dont know what it is that hurts so much in my heart..  I dont know what it is that keeps the tears flowing.. I dont know what it is that makes me want to forget the world and sulk  But    I do know who I dream of through my wakefullness,  I do know who rules my heart..  I do know whose thoughts make my eyes water I do know who I want to remember..  I do know who i want to love and miss every second..  I do know in whose heart i want to live forever..  I do know whos happiness and success I wish for I do know whose tears i wish to cry I do know whom to call in the middle of the night when i am lonely I do know whom to think about when i am praying I do know who to look up to for strength I do know whom to love with all my faith I do know whom to believe in..     A blessing in disguise, my angel so wise..  And could I have one wish this year and ever... , This only would it be:I'd like to be the sort of angel That you have been to me.    Silly as it may sound, for one person to love one so.. my sister, my mother, my friend and my soul.. but all i wish to do right now is thank my maker for allowing me this one pleasure in life, this treasure that he has given me .. All i ask in return is for her safety, for her success and for her peace...     Happy Birthday Rinks.. !!     A special message from tahir and mr t as well, who have been really wondeful, and a big support to me.. :) love ya. malbari..  Happy Birthday..!!

        Sunday, August 01, 2004     A friend called, she said she had a nightmare, She thought that lipsticks are banned forever from the earth. Uff.. I have a nightmare too, Her name is Anna, and shes my aunt.   Calls at ungawdly hours of the night to find out if i was sleeping peacefully, (on a tangent, Mr.T also has the same habit, wonder if they have any long lost relations.. like kumbh ke mele mein.. nah. . annaaunty is too old for that neways.. )   Coming back to her, she called yesterday night, my only night of unbroken sleep, saturday being no online classes and I get to sleep till dawn.. but well, its almost two in the night and the phone rings, I got this feeling it has to be annamausi.. he he.. i always wanted to call her that in our very own dharampaji eshtyle, neways, i get up with a groan and pick up the phone. Sure as ever it is Annamausi, i would strangle her any time any day..but for this phobia i have about jails and closed places... The 4 minutes 40 seconds of conversation that followed leaves me sleepless and in a wake. Unfortunately I cannot even take some coffee, as i am fasting.. so i resort to standing at my window, with a stuffed nonie, (shes me stuffed dog, since i cant have real ones here) and staring into the night for a long time.   I am thinking over the converstaion in my mind and wondering what we actaully talked about. It started off with   AM : Jai Shri Krishna Beta, Me : JSK ( she hates it when i go JSK, but well, thats me.. i am neha, i am different) mausiji pranam AM : Did I wake you up? Me : No Mausiji, i am usually awake at 2 in the nite waitign for you to call AM : Now this is not the time to be moody, I called to tell you that you are supposed to be fasting so read good religious books.  Me: yeah.. tell me about fasting.. tell me about good books.. If i get a bit free from looking after the neighbours cat and oogling at him.. then i shall read some good books.. of course i dint say all this toher.. I go nice and ever so meek, Jee mausiji, am reading my vishnushahstranaam.  and that kinda satisfies her and she says chlao have sui jao ( now go to sleep) and puts the phone down. End of the conversation... so much for the midnight call, I bet in normal households when the phone rings in the middle of the night, there is panic and chaos all around.. not my place, My place the phone rings to find out if i am sleeping peacefully....   Now can you really make any sense out of this?? Ringing in the middle of the night, oh yeah so you are in singapore, but time difference makes it like dawn there .. what are you doing thinking about your niece, working niece at that, who is definately supposed to be sleeping and get up early in the morning and get to work and serve a 100 odd users?????   Ahh.. but i guess its what they call love. She tells me I am always on her mind, and for all the right reasons. Must admit that is kinda cool.. i mean how many people can i say are on my mind all the time?? Can you?? especially aunts and nieces and nephews??   I must admit my family leaves me pretty much to myself, living the life that I want, so heres a thank you to all of them. Thinking back about my life.. ahh well its a well lived one, and though theres not much acheivements in there, its a well adorned one, with love and calm. I wonder whether I have fulfilled what i was sent on earth for ?? ahh.. well i take great pains to take care of the neighbours cat.. ye ye.. i know.. and i take greater pains to let the hunk of a neighbour know that hes a barbarian... but well, other than that?? I guess i would have.. or would do that, in due course when the time is right ya??   Ahh, this comment has been born out of a blog i visited today, but comign to think of it, living a plain life, trying not to meddle with other people and beleiving in myself.. yeah.. i guess i have accomplished a lot more than i would have ever thought possible... the result being I am happy within myself, with all my joys and pains, and all my faith in myself ?? ye.. i am happy.. and thats how I am going to stay.. happy happy happy neha.. !!    SO HEY WORLD..!! CARRY ON.. AT UR OWN PACE.. !! I AM HERE TO STAY..!!!

If I could, I'd comb the sky and collect the stars,  Quickly pile them into a basket until it overflowed with silvery light.  And then I'd give the basket to you, because all things precious and beautiful should belong to you.     It the Friendship day... A year passed by and when i see look back, i see new faces around, Fortunately by the blessings of Almighty, I still see the old faces around, Faithful and strong, Making me wealthier than Kuber, the lord of riches... and prouder than Abraham. I could write and write about what I am feeling, and I could make poems on these precious souls that surround me,  I could thank them for the support and help they have given when I needed them the most,  I could thank them for accepting me the way I am, with all my imperfections,  I could thank them for beleiving in me, even when in their hearts they knew i was wrong, I could thank them for smiles they filled in my life, I could thank them for all the tears they brushed off But how could i ever thank them for Making my world so special, so wanted and so precious??? I could'nt possibly find the words... And so, Here is a small prayer for all the angels without wings,    Help me, O God, to be a good and a true friend;  To be loyal and never to let my friends down: Never to talk about them behind their backs in a way that I would not do before their faces;  Never to betray a confidence or talk about the things I should be silent about;  Always to be ready to share everything I have;  To be as true to my friends as I would wish them to be to me.     HAPPY FRIENDSHIP DAY.. TO THOSE WHO MAKE MY WORLD SPECIAL JUST BY BEING IN IT.

        Saturday, July 31, 2004     Today.. early morning.. I met a stranger..   Time is like around 6 45..in the morning, Me not at my social best, just finished my Gawd at such an awful time online classes, been to the temple to go say good morning to the Big B,and was on my way back.. and kinda tired, so sat down on the steps of the building to catch my breath. I hear a noise and turn around, and find two cats just about getting into a nasty catfight. Now i am all for cat fights, i love them.. the cats i mean, not fights. Neways, one of them looked familier, so i take it upon my good self to intervene, the way i figure it, its my good deed of the day.   Ah well, the cats dint think so, and i end up sitting on the sidewalk, just besides the garbage dump can.. with my feet in the air and me poor little bums, sorry they ever came out of the bed, sore with  their rough contact with the sidewalk, and my ego.. several inches shrinked.. and i happen to have a huge ego.. almost 54 inches at waist.. :):) Neways, it was a good thing that the garbage collector dosent arrive till 7 on fridays, else i would have seen myself being rudely picked up.. yuck.. ok.. so i pick myself up, all gray trousers and the new look sports tshirt, outta the sidewalk and giving the cats a scorned look, return to sit on the steps. And there i see the stranger, hes smiling .. no make that smirking.. just short of laughing out load..   Hes dressed in a jogging suit, black and blue with white lining, addidas one, cool sport shoes and has a small sling with a water bottle and a mobile hanging on his waist band. He has earphones around his neck, and his humming something as well. Quite a sight he was..A copy of gulfnews in one hand, and the other hand was carressing his long brown hair, thick mane actually, one thats diffcult to see in this country, where i beleive the water is totaly anti hairgrowth. Nice height almost 6, good built strong broad shoulders, Legs that dint seem to end.. and a smile that could give phillips bulbs a runfor their lights any day... Oye.. stop it.. hes not a participant of the raymonds Mr. India Contest and neither are you a judge...   Hmm.. i say, so hes nicely laughing at my discomfort and so rude.. !!! cant even come to help me get up.... Indian he seems,not the south indian, mumbiya smile, u can make those out a mile away. I wait for him to make a move and get going, I couldnt place him, never had seen him around, and i am pretty early riser.. I kinda know all the schedules of joggers in my area.. Not that I jog, but i like to walk in the early morning when i do my round of going and waking up the Big B, every day.. except.. ah well... neways..   So coming back to the stranger, he just stands there and keeps smiling and irritated a bit, i go murmring "What the heck does he find so funny ??" Little did i realise that i had said those words a bit  too loudly.. (thats coz i am deaf in my left ear and when i murmur i gotta be real loud ) The guy stops smiling and comes up to me "Hey I am sorry, but i was trying to figure out which cat was fighting which, when u landed on your .. emmm"  So this starts off a conversation... as follow  Me: "On my bums?? how rude!!" He: Sorry.. dint mean to,  Me: You could have landed a hand He: You were making a good job of it urself, i dint want to disturb the cats...  Me:  (by now a smile coming to my face)  oh yeah.. the cats.. they are always fighting He: I know, but why did u bother? Me: See that brown cat?? i know him, hes name is cecil, i was jsut protecting him He: Hmmm.. so u like cats?? is that your cat??? Me: No ways.. hes my neighbours cat, I just feed him, take him for a walk, sometimes give him a brush, a bath, and yeh.. go and buy speciall tuna for him...  He: You must love your neighbours so very much to take care of their cat for them Me: Nah.. i dont, i just know the cat.. hes enuff to know, i bet his owners strave him for food and love for him to follow me aorund like a puppy..  (puppy..?? hes a cat for heavens sake, i go, great going neha.. what a conversation to start with at 7 in the morning with a good hunk of a man.. in sports attire, you may as well have choked on ur words)  He: Yeah.. some people they keep pets and then forget all about it Me: yeah, i agree, those people should be rounded up and lashed till they rename themselves to REPENT..  (keep it up neha.. u going good, u may as well as tell him about your secret fetishes.. and fantasies.. and hope that he manages to stay awake )  He: ha ha.. You sure have some strong views about pets and owners, What do you do btw? Me: Me.. i do nothing, just nothing  He: Where are you from? Me: India, Gujarat... am a gujju.. you know.. from ahmedabad.. emm i have been here for 4 years now.. and am  ( ye ye.. tell him all the pertinent details.. about the house in the city and the big sofa chairs with faded upholestry,the grandfather clock that hangs in the hall that dosent work, the fear of water, fatal weakness for choclates, a little arabic, dont jog anymore coz cant be bothered to, no hand gliding, only books and computers, no serious relationships, and not seeking.. not seeking what.. oh god.. what am i ?? a clout??? )  He: I c, and you love cats Me: Oh.. yeah.. i love animals in general  ( tell him about the zoo u have back home go on go on.. awwww. dont be shy.. silly goonk)  He: This Cecil, as u call him, how old is he Me: i dont knwo.. i have known him for about 4 months on and off now.. he comes aroudn the house  when my doors open and makes himself at home. Once he stayed the night  ( great.. now he knows u spend nights with cats.. how gross!!) He: Hmm your husband dosent mind?? Me: No he dosent, hes not around to mind.. He: Hmm so u stay alone Me: yeah.. kinda..  He: Kinda.. ? Me: yeah.. unless if you can account my 5 other personalities as companions, Ye.. i am alone He:  (with a crooked smile )  you are weird  Me:  (slowly getting over the shock)  Hey.. how can u call a lady weird.. that too first thing in the morning.. ??  He: Oops sorry dint mean to offend you, but can call you in the afternoon and call you weird, if you like  (hmm is that a pass?? take the opportunity dumbo, give him ur phone number, it cant hurt u to have a nice man talk to you once in a while, maybe he will take u out for cofeee, and dinner and ride.. and then maybe next week... uff....neha.. u really are the most stupidest woman on earth.. make that universe.... )  Me: Hmm okeis, none taken He: Are you ok? are you hurt, you want me to take you to a doctor or somethign.. Me: (or something.. like ur home?? ) La, me fine,   By this time Cecil has taken to purring and rubbing himself at my feet loudly.. maybe the sign to get up and get going.. and feed him some milk.. Oh how i hated that cat... wont it allow me my one interaction with the opposite sex, one that looks like a greek god.. ?? oh well okies, not quite.. but he is like well dressed, smart, intelligent, funny... and obviously has a lotta time on hand.. to speak to me , Obviously a sicko.. !!   Neways, i make to get up and he lands a hand, oh .. my knees go like rubber, ok ok.. dont make a fool of yourself neha.. i tell myself and get up, and start to go into the elevator, and he follows, with Cecil in tow. I look at him strangely and he goes.. I stay here too, moved about 6 months back, 3rd floor, I was shocked, I live on the third floor, and though i dont go knocking all doors, i should know who stays there yea?? Neways, we three get off the elevator, there was a certain silence with the exception of Cecil who was trying to get to the guy's water bottle.. And i am like tryign to get him off, like a mother daatofying a naughty kid to stay off strangers.. oh man!! what a stranger...   Third Floor, he walks right next to my apartment, and then comes the biggest surprise, Cecil instead of following me, walks with him, back arched high and purring away to content.... and this stranger.. he looks at me and says" His name is King, and hes 2 years old and hes my cat"  God... How i wish the earth moved and i would be eaten away, How i wished there was a hurricane that swept me awway.. how i wish i was invisible... how i iwsh i was a fly and could just .. well fly away......   The stranger smiles.. and turns into a neighbour.. parting shot.. thanks miss for taking care of my cat.....Oh, btw I am Vivek...   Hey.. Vivek nice to have run into you, and hey.. Cecil.. errrr King is no problem, anytime..   And i fumble with my door and slink in.. and well.. thats it.. the mystery of Cecil the Cat and his Owner solved.. ..   Today... Early Morning... I met a stranger...

        Thursday, July 29, 2004       If I stoop Into a dark tremendous sea of cloud, It is but for a time; I press God's lamp Close to my breast; its splendor soon or late Will pierce the gloom; I shall emerge one day. But how carve way i' the life that lies before, If bent on groaning ever for the past?    Laura asked me how did i change from glommy neha to happy one.. Well it was a half truth.. I aint so happy, but well, I just had to look at life the other way.. like how i can be so sad about what i am losing, and that how can i be blind to the happiness i had for a few moments..   Well that changed me into a happy happy neha.. not too very happy.. but getting there, slowly. Friends.... like the lamp of God, help u overcome your shortcomings.. Family, they guide you through ur darkest roads, and God, takes the pilot seat.. Thats my belief and true to that belief i shall be.   Its difficult for me to admit that I am hurt and sad, and that i do care for somone more than myself and that my happiness.. as little as it may.. depends on someone's physical presence in my life. It makes me realise how much i really know myself, or is it dont know? Maybe.. whatever the reason, I get hurt knowingly and then i have only myself to blame. But yet, I go ahead, coz along with this hurt comes an understanding, a presence in my life that belongs.. really belongs, and feels at home. Along with this pain comes a knowledge and the truth, that God really really lives in everyone.. That all souls are one, The understanding that You are not alone in this world, yet you are alone.. and most importantly.. He never ever for a second leaves you unattended. That feeling gives me the strength and the love thats needed... thats all that counts. My Vatsi.. I just plain simple love him.. with all my heart.. :):)   Scribbled by  urlLink Dreams   on  urlLink 07:06 PM    LinktoComments('1091113521')  8 Comments    urlLink Talk 2 Me!!      Hmm.. no thoughts... can a mind be thoughtless ever?? Nah.. its forever ticking..tocking. tick tock tick tock.. hmm sos mine,but i cant figure out what they are.. whats running through my mind, All a blur.. a fog.. someppl keep coming and going.. friends, family.... work.. hmm.. a lot happening.   Have been busy with work past days.. ye ye.. i know, but one cant always pretend to be working ya?? Manager has decided to take 21 more days off .. and that lands me a big hot alphabet soup, why alphabet soup?? i dont knw, maybe coz i am a veggie.. and i aint in mood of corn or vegge soup?? whatever.. i am constantly thinking about food these days.. must be the fasting.. *note to myself - stop thinkign about food, and start thinking about cats *   Okies, back to the train of thought, which was like stuck on rinks past few weeks has been turning loose and going all haywire. Not that rinks is not on my mind, she is, in fact, today i feel jaise kuch jyada hi pyar aa raha hai.. so heres a muuuaahh.. rinks.. but anyways,  though i am able to concnerate fully on work, no mistakes there, but still my mind is running at the speed of light. Its tiring me out.. oh well.. let it run.. its got a mind of its own.. eh.. whats that?? la la .. too deep for me to figure that out he he!!!  Mere rang mein rangne wali..  Pari ho ya ho pariyo ki rani, ya ho koi prem kahani, mere sawalo ka jawab do.. dooo na.. !!  I like when they play oldies, takes me back to my childhood and the days i enjoyed. Does this mean that i dont enjoy these days.. to tell u the truth.. i dont.. theres suddenly no laughs in my life.  Miss those days when we used to have fun, laugh and kid around.... OK OK&gt;. so i know life is not all about jokes and pranks.. but then its not about pain and hurt as well is it??? One has to get up and get going and get on with life, whatever that is..   Hmm.. blabbering blabberings.. a lot of them, underneath lies a bit of pain.. some of it, wish there were some sorta washing powder for it.. dab dab dab.. ur soul and out it comes sparkling clean.. devoid of the stains of pains.. (that makes a nice tittle.. )   Neways, getting back to work now.. and updating laterzz...

        Tuesday, July 27, 2004       It's time to rise, Stand up and wipe your sleepy eyes. Reach and stretch for the sky, Hold your hands way up high.  Bend your body and touch the ground, Stand up straight, now turn around. Point to your eyes, point to your nose, Jump up and down and touch your toes. Let's start the day, with a happy good morning...and a happy day...    So morning world.. how are you, I have been up since ages, attended classes and then dozed a bit more and now am at work. Theres like much gir gir as usual and Wel its my day to hold the court today... as its the salary processing day.. Me is the Queen he he.. :) but well thats just for the day.. So it seems the next two days will be extra busy, and i shal lnot be able to , of course i will blog .. how can u ever think that, :):) what i meant was it wont be able to get to do anything other than the reporting stuff, so the next days after the next two days.. eh.. thats confusing, neways if u guys are reading this, u got enuff time, figure it out ( but please lemme know after u do ) ye.. so will not be ye ye am getting there re.. Uff Aajkal ke bacche.. jara bhi patience nahi hai.. Humare jamane mein aisa nahi hota tha.. he he ok ok..   Neways, what i was just trying to say is that i wont have time for thinking up any masti stuff at work. But in any case i am bit upset coz mr t is upset with me.. or so it seems, I hate it when i hurt people, for my selfish reasons, which i think i may have to mr t.   But for my justification it is the fact that, he tried to hurt the only feeling i really cherish in my whole existance. And if i cannot get selfish to protect myself at that point, who else will?? Does that make sense?? To me, it does, but at the same time in some twisted sense, its like killing me to know that i have been the cause of hurt for mr t. I just hope that we are able to deal with this as adults that we are.. (ok ok, so i am a nanima and hes a bacha... :) but thats between u and me... ) neways, knowing me..i will talk to him, but knowing him.. well it may take him some time if at all ... So fingers crossed.   Its been a long time since i felt this way. Suddenly my simple life has taken a massive U turn and become so very complicated. Wonder why, but more than that, it hurts me to see a friend go.. well not go, but its been a long time since i ever felt hurt by anyone walking outta my life.  And the sinking feeling is like I really have hurt someone. Its so very difficult to agree to that, especailly since I know its true. At the same time i am angry at myself at allowing people to see my weakness, may it be someone i considered a friend, may it be a stranger.. Angry at myself at not forseeing this situation, and angry at myself for feeling guilty for hurting somone. I shouldnt, but i am, I shouldnt be feeling sorry for myself or anyone else and I shouldnt have had to say sorry to anyone...  But i sitll will, coz proud and content as i may be, i really care for this triangular friendship of ours, me tahir and mr t. And i dont want me to be the one to cause any trouble, or be one of the statistic that proves that guys and gals cannot have platonic friendship.. they can, havent u seen will and grace?? or two guys and a gal?? he he..   Neways, will update that later.. right now its like back to work.. and will c ya laterzz.......

        Monday, July 26, 2004      Mornings world..    Tahir asked me today.. how long are you gonna be the sad neha, dont like it.. at first i was stung a little, I mean does a person have to put a check on his her emotions just coz of someone, But then i realised that it was true. I would rahter be happy neha and love rahter than be a sad gloomy neha and cry about something that i cannot control and in turn waste precious moments which i could put to better use like for smiling for the moments i have had the opportunity to share with someone so close to me.. So here goes..   I am officially commiting the past two weeks to memory... happy memory.. happy happy memory.. So heres to stopping the cribbing and stuff and growing up.. Ye .. i finally managed to give myself the Part and Package of Life lecture.. and got it to sink in with a few pills and lo.. i am the happy neha again..  Today i am happy again in the virtual space, as my heart is online again :) ok ok.. no mysteries.. But i seriously have to get cracking at work and studies, and well like they say, get on with the show of life. Looking forward to waking up at 3 for classes and juggling schedules and troubleshooting for a few minutes of blogging or a unsticking a stuck for life code he he..  But first things first.. I have to do something for laughs.. its been like dead in the office, everyone is gloomy, the sales staff are looking harried, it being the last week of the month.. and well i got only today, coz tomorww will be the busy day.. coz of the timeattendance stuff..   ahha.. what a song..  " dil tadap tadap ke kah raha hai aa bhi ja, tu humse aankh na chura "  i love oldies..  tu nahi to ye bahar kya bahar hai, gul nahi khile ke tera intezar hai.. dil tadap tadap ke kah raha hai aa bhi ja.. "   hmm i am all set.. so what to do for fun?? tahir aint baiting either, says wait till thrusday, god its only monday, okies, first things first, have changed the extension of the PM's office to be forwarded to the malbari sales manager, who dosent speak a bit of arabic.not even aiwa... :):)  that should be some fun.. ahhh hes shouting already ha ha ha......... this is music to my ears,  so till i think up a really really super idea to announce the return of the prank queen.. adios my dear bloggie.. stay safe my virtual world and hey.. a special hi to AP, Paddy, Vims, and the Yet Mortal.. btw, anytime you want to change the tittle, lemme know, i got a person here whos ready to kill me.. and well he says he wil accept replacements .. so hey.. kindly obilige ya???   Okies.. till i c ya laterzzzzzzzz.. work hard fellas..
