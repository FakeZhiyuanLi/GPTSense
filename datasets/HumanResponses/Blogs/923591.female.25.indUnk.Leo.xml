      I'm just getting in from a most enjoyable first day.&nbsp; My eyes can barely stay open so I will blog the details later.  (post 1:20am)    &nbsp;     Later...      (approximately 9 1/2 hours later)        &nbsp;  Okay, here I am back to tell you about my date.&nbsp; Well, it was a "first meeting" date, sort of a blind date.&nbsp; I met Jonathan off of blackplanet.&nbsp; We've been conversing back and forth for almost two months, if not more, and we finally decided to meet each other.&nbsp; Although he sent me pictures I really couldn't see them all that&nbsp;well and didn't know what to expect but I always put the worst in my head so I'm not disappointed.&nbsp; We decided on doing the movie thing so we met up at the theatre.&nbsp; I had him stand near the front entrance of the theatre as I watched from my car.&nbsp; I really couldn't tell much from a distance except he was lighter then I thought, wore glasses, slim, and tall.&nbsp; I joked with him for a minute over the cell phone and then I finally stepped out of my vehicle and snuck up from behind, however he turned around as I got closer.&nbsp; It was a pleasing first sight for me.&nbsp; He was quite handsome, much better then I expected.&nbsp; We had decided prior to see I, Robots.&nbsp; He was running late but we just missed only about the first five minutes (thank goodness for previews).&nbsp; The movie was okay; personally I thought there would be a lot more action but all an all it was alright.&nbsp; When we sat down, Jonathan immediately placed his arms around my shoulder.&nbsp; At first it was weird for me because it's been so long since I've been in that position, however I grew accustomed.&nbsp; After a while we switched to holding hands and I placed my head on his shoulder.&nbsp; After the movie, he wanted to hang out some more so we ended up at Waffle House.&nbsp; We had a late night meal and then stood in the parking lot for a minute while he tried to convince me to follow him home or let him come over to my place, he didn't want to end the night.&nbsp; After a good five minutes of back and forth, we had a very nice goodnight kiss and got into our cars and went our separate ways.&nbsp; It was a very nice date.&nbsp; I didn't realize how long it's been since I had one of those.&nbsp; I'm looking forward to the sequel.  (post 10:57am)     &nbsp;

      I've been feeling a little under the weather these past few days so I don't have much on my mind.&nbsp; I ended up calling in sick yesterday and skipping my spanish class.&nbsp; I just laid around watching television and sleeping.&nbsp; I dragged myself to work and class today.&nbsp; On the way back home I almost got into a really bad car accident.&nbsp; This jerk didn't bother to look before he changed lanes and almost came crashing nto my car.&nbsp; I automatically swirved out the way not knowing if there was a car next to me or not.&nbsp; Thank goodness there was no other car to my right howevever I almost lost control of the car.&nbsp; Thank the Lord I regained control.&nbsp; This ass then tried to switch into the next lane that I swirved into almost hitting me again.&nbsp; I started blaring my horn.   Well the was pretty much the most exciting part of my day.

      Well, I have just spent another Saturday doing nothing but rotting in front of the TV set.&nbsp; I tried to finish braiding my hair but I still have a little bit to do but other then that I just sat here.&nbsp; I had like three guys saying how they wanted to hang with me for the weekend.&nbsp; One wanted to take me to dinner and a horse carriage ride, the other wanted to come over and watch movies, and wanted to also do the date thing.&nbsp; I heard from all three of them all week but the minute Saturday comes around everyone is M.I.A.&nbsp; It's cool though cause I already expected that.&nbsp; I have no trust in anything that comes out of a dudes mouth.&nbsp; To me, it's all B.S.&nbsp; The only now is I'm waiting to hear what their excuses are going to be for not calling, that's always the good part.&nbsp; Let's see some of the excuses I've heard in my lifetime so far...   1) I'm not a phone person.  2) I was out and my cell battery died out.  3)&nbsp;My cousin/sister needed my help and I couldn't get to a phone.  4) I was in a really bad car accident and was in a comma for a month and half (that one was original)  5) I misplaced your number  6) I thought it too late to call  Most guys don't give an excuse they just act like they never said they would call....lol   I guess it's a guy thing.&nbsp; That's why I don't take any of them seriously.&nbsp; They put up this big front just to try to get in your pants.&nbsp; Hmmm....maybe I should turn the tables and start using them for what I want.   Anyway....my old friend signed on today.&nbsp; Him and I can't speak as much as we want to because his girlfriend is crazy and jealous.&nbsp; I feel for him because I know how it to hate being alone so much that you'll deal with a crazy/jealous person.&nbsp; We spoke earlier this afternoon and he was suppose to try and get away from her to come visit me.&nbsp; I finally got a call from him around9:45pm.&nbsp; He wasn't able to get away like he planned.&nbsp; I feel so bad for him but I can't really say much cause my ex-fiance made a big scene about this friend back in the day.&nbsp; He even got my parents involved.&nbsp;&nbsp; My dad forbid me to speak to my friend anymore but as you can see that didn't happen.&nbsp; I'm telling you, jealousy is a crazy thing.&nbsp; I can't waste my energy with being jealous.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I'm gonna go and finish braiding my hair so I can start wearing it out.

      Today is a day that I wish I would have skipped class.&nbsp; There is this one guy in my world literature class that tries entirely too hard to be funny.&nbsp; I can't stand hearing his voice.&nbsp; I don't know if it's because he talks toooooo much or if it's just the sound of his voice but every time he gets to talking, I get a headache.&nbsp; Well today the teacher had us do this group assignment and then one person out of the group had to get in front of the class and read what they came up with.&nbsp; Of course, he read for his group *rolling my eyes*.&nbsp; He was being so dramatic and cracking all these jokes and just being goofy as hell.&nbsp; Everyone was dying with laughter but I just sat there not even looking in his direction.&nbsp; I was so annoyed by him.&nbsp; It was a simple assignment but he had to come with sound affects, rhymes, and ridiculous jokes.&nbsp; I couldn't wait to leave out the class.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm so happy that class is over in just two weeks.&nbsp; Damn, just thinking about him showing out gives me a headache...lol.&nbsp; People don't realize the more they laugh at him the more of a clown he tries to be.&nbsp; I just gotta keep telling myself, it's almost over.&nbsp;   The other thing that happened in class was I had a totally different perception of this short story we had to read, Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka.&nbsp; My teacher and class saw Grego's family as being leeches and not loving but I didn't get that at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of my classmates got all worked up when I shared my opinion and was trying to get me to change my views.&nbsp; Even my teacher was trying to make it seem like my perception was wrong but can someone say what you perceive is wrong.&nbsp; It's all a matter of opinion.&nbsp; Anyway, we have to write a reading response on the story and I will be sure to get my point across in my paper.&nbsp; Guess my weekend will be in front of the laptop....lol.   All in all, it was a long day.

      Well, tonight I met one of my online buddies.&nbsp; Mmmmm.....he was a hottie.&nbsp; His picture did not do him justice.&nbsp; I doubt it will go anywhere though or last very long.&nbsp; Don't mean to sound pessimistic but that is how most of my friendships seem to go these days.&nbsp; anyway let's see, Richard is about 5'10", caramel tone, nice juicy lips, Jamaican    I had to stop for a minute because R. Kelly's song, "You Saved Me" is on.&nbsp; I honestly think that is one of the best songs he has written so far.&nbsp; That song actually made me cry the first time I heard it.&nbsp; Man, this is deep.... I accepted Christ that day and now I'm free.&nbsp; You saved me.&nbsp; Gave me a second chance.&nbsp; You saved me. You saved me.&nbsp;  I can definitely relate to that.&nbsp; So many times I've stopped and thought of how GOD had grace on me with stupid things that I've done.&nbsp; Mmmmm.....   Ok, I'm back.&nbsp; Where was I...Oh yeah....Richard...he is from NY so he has that strong NY accent (eventhough he has been here almost as long as I have),he has a two year old son, &nbsp;he's an appraiser (so I'm trying to hook him up with my job to get him more clientele), and did I mention he is a hot hottie....lol.&nbsp; Oh and he briefly mentioned that he is a retired stripper....hmmmm.&nbsp; Well, that was the good and now the bad is he is 23.&nbsp; That's&nbsp; all I see so far.&nbsp;&nbsp;For a friend that really isn't an issue however if there might possibly be anything more intimate, there might be a problem here for me.&nbsp; I told myself no more younger guys.&nbsp;   I'm getting sleepy....I just wanted to share....I'll elaborate tomorrow....night, I mean morning.

      This morning around 6am my phones rings.&nbsp; Half conscious I picked up the phone and the conversation went like this:  &nbsp;  (Blue= me&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Black= my "friend")  &nbsp;    -Hello     -Hey!&nbsp; What time do you have to be at work?     -8am     -Oh, thought I could come and break you off some before work.    - Huh?  (That woke me up)    -I thought I could break you off before work but there's not enough time.    - What time is it?     -Around 6    - Oh yeah, not enough time.     -Hit me up later.    - Ok, bye.    &nbsp;  After I hung up the phone, I just laid there till about 6:45am.&nbsp; Now that I think of it I should have let him come over, that would have a been a very nice way to start the day.&nbsp; Nothing would probably bother me for the whole day...LOL.&nbsp;&nbsp;*smile*&nbsp;

      I had a very nice weekend.&nbsp; I went to New York for my friends wedding.&nbsp; Although I missed the wedding ceremony, because of my cousin, I did get to the reception and had a wonderful time.&nbsp; I got to see Cacia, the bride,&nbsp;which I haven't seen since '93.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was the only one from my freshman year that stayed in contact with me&nbsp;after I moved down to GA.&nbsp; I probably know secrets no one else&nbsp;knows about her.&nbsp; She use to write me and tell me about all that was going on with her and people in school.&nbsp; When I was suppose to get&nbsp;married she was going to come to my wedding so I thought it only&nbsp;right for me to make it to hers.&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked so beautiful.&nbsp; I was so happy to see her and she was happy to see me in return.&nbsp; We really didn't talk much because it was her "special day" and she was having soo much fun.&nbsp; I did miss her husband and their daughter.&nbsp; I was really glad to see them finally tie the knot, because they came a very long way and overcame many of trials and tribulations.&nbsp; It was a gorgeous reception and I had a wonderful time.  &nbsp;  The rest of the weekend was spent chilling out with my aunt an cousin.&nbsp; I forgot how funny those two are when they are together.&nbsp; They had me cracking up all day.&nbsp;&nbsp; One funny thing my cousin did was when we went down the street to get a pizza pie.&nbsp; As we walked in the door he whispers, "Watch how slick I am."&nbsp; He walked up to the counter and said, "I called in an order for a large pie!"&nbsp; I stood there trying not to laugh because I knew he hadn't called in.&nbsp; Within seconds, they handed him a large pie and we were on our way, leaving everyone standing in the line behind us.&nbsp; The minute we got out the door I busted out laughing.&nbsp; He says they never stop making pizza so by the time the other person come to get their pie, it will be ready and they will never be the wiser.&nbsp; I had me two big ole New York slices.  &nbsp;  I also got to see my cousins baby girl, Destiny.&nbsp; She is five months now and this was my first time seeing her.&nbsp; She was a cutie pie with your no teeth having smile.&nbsp; I must honestly say that she looks nothing like my cousin.&nbsp; I hope this truly is his child cause I would hate to have to go to NY and beat some chicas ass.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Anyway, that&nbsp;was my second trip to NY in a month.&nbsp; That got me back in the mood to travel.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had been&nbsp;thinking of going to Ft. Lauderdale for my birthday in Aug.&nbsp; I even&nbsp;started&nbsp;looking up&nbsp;flight and hotel packages, but I had to sit back and think if it would be worth paying almost $400.&nbsp; My initial plan was to go down there and finally meet one of my online friends that I've been chatting with since like '96.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I told my friend this, he sounded genuinely happy but I just don't know.&nbsp; Personally the more I think about it, I don't feel we have the type of friendship worth&nbsp;making that kind of trip for.&nbsp; I know that sounds cruel but that's how I feel.&nbsp; In all the years I've known him he's never picked up the phone to call me, and he blames it on him just not being good at keeping contact with friends but I can't help but notice, in his blogs, how often him and my ex-friend speaks.&nbsp; He seems to be a lot closer to my ex friend then me.&nbsp; Yeah, you might look at it as being jealous and maybe it is but&nbsp;it just hurts to think I've known him since '96 and&nbsp;we are just online&nbsp;buddies&nbsp;however he meets my friend&nbsp;maybe two years ago, through me no less, and they talk all the time. Hmmm....I guess they just get along&nbsp;better.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems like all those years and I still don't know anything about him most of the information I learned about him came through my ex friend.&nbsp; Come to think of it, most of our conversations have been one sided or stayed on the surface.&nbsp; I guess it's been stupid on my part to try to keep a friendship between us that just isn't strong.&nbsp; Maybe I should just get the hint and realize that we don't have enough in common to develop a deeper friendship.&nbsp; I think&nbsp;if anyone should make that trip to visit it should be my ex-friend; he would probably enjoy the time spent with her a lot more being that they seem to have a lot more to talk about.&nbsp; After thinking about this half the day I've decided that I am going to probably take a drive down to St. Simon Islands or Savannah and spend the weekend alone or maybe I can convince one my guy "associates" to go with.&nbsp; Anyway, all I know is that I'm going to have a good time for my birthday weekend.  &nbsp;   Qutie , don't take what I wrote too hard just thought you should know so you wouldn't wonder why I stop calling or didn't come to visit, not that I really think you would notice.&nbsp; Take it as you may, call it jealousy or whatever...I don't know.&nbsp; It would be different if I knew that you had that wall up with everyone but since I know different, it hurts more.&nbsp; Sorry if this seemed all of&nbsp;a sudden but it really isn't, it's something I think about often whenever I see you blog a conversation you had with Peachie.&nbsp; Anyway, I had called you the other day because I was concerned about how you were coping from reading one of your recent blogs.&nbsp; I thought everything was pretty clear with your decision to go back with your girlfriend.&nbsp; I really have a feeling you care for her and you are trying to mess it up by causing your own confusion but hey what do I know.&nbsp; Well....(nothing left to say)....Bye.

      **Let me warn you, this is going to be a short one.  After sleeping on the situation at hand, I've decided that there is no need in being nice and allow my ex to have a last chance. I remembered how he lied about receiving the refund check from the Chaircover people and how he wouldn't return the money I had in his account to pay other wedding items. His exact statement was, "...take it as a loss."  I am going straight and file a small claims case.  Told you it would be short. *wink*

      Every time I decided to possibly attempt to consider talking to a guy something happens that reminds me that I should stay by myself.  I'm trying to give this guy Rod some kind of chance but he is really starting to work my nerves.  I have no patience to deal with him.  I think our conversing has to end.  And then this other gentleman I had met about two months ago decides to email me out the blue.  I fell for him the moment I saw him.  I thought he was so cute and creative.  I was actually willing to date him but it seems like his schedule is a little to busy to include me.  He sent me a crush note today but I'm not even moved by it anymore.  Oh well!  Oh, I finally got in contact with this law office that called for me and it was just as I thought.  My stupid ass ex didn't pay a bullshit bill in the amount of $112. I'm not paying this bill.  I have lost entirely too much money for this man.  I'm still trying to sell my wedding dress.  I still have the bridesmaid dress and maid of honor dress....man the list goes on.  I debating how to handle this situation.  I don't want to speak to him but I might have too.  I was thinking I might call him and give him an opportunity to volunteer to pay this bill, a last chance.  If he refuses then I will file a small claims case.  Or I might request this through a letter but then I thought how would I know if he pays it or not, cause lord knows I don't trust him.  AAAAAHHHHHH....A WATERBUG!!  Damn....the one time I wish there was a man in the house. I don't like trying to kill those things they are tooo damn big.  Gotta go!

      Well, I've recently met this gentleman name Rod.  We've been chatting a little over two weeks now.  Rod is a 30 year old professional with one daughter.  He is divorced and currently pursuing his masters in ummmm....I can't remember what he said.  I'm still on the fence about him because he is way different from the guys I've run into.    Here is a little about him...  ~ He is very direct ~ He doesn't like to joke around ~ Very serious minded ~ Doesn't watch TV except for educational programs or news ~ He is extremely patriotic (he use to be in the service) ~ Old fashion ~ He can be intimidating at times but I guess it's because he's so direct ~ He is extremely disciplined ~ Raised by both parents ~ quirky ~ Extremely educated ~ Owns his own place ~ Actually has his own car...a really nice truck at that  He keeps saying that he is the type of person that you either like or don't but at this point I don't know if I like him or don't.  I think I shocked him when I said that because he is use to people automatically forming an opinion immediately.  I can tell that he is really attracted to me but I'm not sure if I'm attracted to him.  There is no immediate attraction to him.  He's not fine but he's not ugly.  With his glasses on, he looks really nerdy.  I don't know I just have mixed feelings.  I mostly think it's because I'm not really emotionally open to a relationship and it seems like he is looking to get into one.  That kind of draws me back. Right now I'm content with just being associates but he made a mention that we need to go on a date soon.  Hmmmm...I just don't know!

      Here I sit at work 9:54am and I realize how much I hate my job.  And I'm really starting to dislike my boss.  I think it's time to find a new job!  I mean there is no motivation to get up in the mornings and come into this place.      Right now, I feel I get paid just enough to be a receptionist nothing more...answer phones, greet clients, order office supplies, set up conference room for weekly meeting and make coffee.  No fixing peoples computer problems, no migrating information from one laptop to another, no setting up people on DSL or network printers, no fixing office machines, no training people on how to use software, no sitting here mailing 495 letters to your clients, no creating marketing flyers, no doing new hire orientations, no helping with powerpoint presentations, no taking care of people's freakin plants, no creating volume reports...I'm like, if you want me to be your onsite help desk personnel or technician, promote me and give me that kind of pay.  Anyway, I just need a new job.   CREATIVE CORNER...  (Another peek at my creative side)    Let your desire spray me in a firestorm Bathe me in your tantalizing mental power Set my soul ablaze with your sheer expressions Your poetic words stroke me in places unheard of Explore my inner essence with your wisdom Whisper your wishes and requests into my mind and spirit Let me be your vessel of self-assurance Place your passion within me    ~written by yours truly

      Today was nothing spectacular.  I dragged myself into work, hoping I could get a chance to study for my Spanish test (Why I didn't study this weekend is beyond me.)  Anyway, luck would have it, I had a pile of work to do and didn't get a chance to study at all.  Normally I would stress but today I really didn't care about much.  I just dragged out through the day.  Half way through the day my mother made her routine call to my office.  Today, she had one of her "I'm going to pray for you to get a man spell."  I wasn't trying to hear it today like I wasn't trying to hear it any other time she said it...LOL.  I'm really not interested in finding a man.  I asked her to tell me one good reason why I need a man and she replied, "It is God's will. It's a completion...Having a husband completes you."  In my book, that wasn't a good reason.  I need better then that. Anyone else got a better reason?  I called that law office that has been looking for me however the lady wasn't there.  But from what I can gather it's about a bullshit bill.  Obviously make jackass of an ex didn't pay the bill and now they are coming after me.  That's what I get for trust someone and letting them use my name.  I don't even know how much this damn bill is.  I cut the phone off the day I got my stuff out of his apartment.  Now I'm stuck paying on something that I never used.  It's all a lesson learnt though.  I'm sorry fellahs but it's trifflin men like my ex that make it so hard for you good ones out there.  My dad says he absolutely refuses for me to pay that bill.  I don't need to pay anything for that man anymore.  I say it's messig up my credit and he is not going to pay it.  I don't want to call him on it cause quite frankly I'm done dealing with him.  I'll see what the law office says when I speak to them.  Most likely, I'll have to just pay the damn bill and move on.  The one good thing about all this is I know that in the end everyone gets their just desserts.  Maliko sorry you didn't get a chance to be in this blog.  Maybe the next one. *wink*  I hope you enjoy the story I sent you.  That's just between me and you ok.

      Well today was a family day.  I went over to my mother's and father's house around 5:30pm.  My cousin was over there with her new boyfriend (I wonder how long that will last).  My uncle was down from New York and my other cousin and his daughter came over.  It was like Thanksgiving all over again.  We sat down in the formal dining room telling jokes and then watched a home video and beginning of Medea's Family's Reunion.    Some other thing happen today that I rather not share. *wink*  All in all, today was a really good day.   THOUGHT OF THE DAY...   You know...for some reason these past few days I've been thinking about the people that I've ran across in my lifetime and how I truly wasted my time knowing some of them or dealing with them.  The two biggest mistakes I can think of is my ex-bestfriend Cshiana and my ex-fiance Chadrick.  Cshiana was a friend that I met in high school back in 93 and we stopped being friends last year after she had a phone conversation with my ex-fiance and didn't want to inform me of what they spoke about.  It wasn't so much the fact that she spoke to him but it was more of her attitude with the whole situation.  I was upset that she told him my personal business knowing this is my ex and she is suppose to be MY best friend.  When I tried to go to her on the situation to resolve it her reply to me was and I quote, "You'll get over it."  That was the straw that broke the camels back for me. I have had to deal with her bitterness for too many years and finally she wore out my patience.  Now that I look back, I don't know how I stayed friends with her all these years.  She was never a good friend to me. One example of what kind of friend she was is...one day I was having a birthday party and she came and spent the night.  The next day I woke up and started cleaning and preparing for the party and she didn't offer to help not once.  She just sat in front of the television without a care in the world.  My mother even asked me what kind of friend was that not to even ask if we needed any help but she sure did help herself to the food and fun.  I remember another time, I introduced her to a friend of mine and she became interested in him and asked me if I liked him.  I assured her that there were no feelings there between us but yet she still went behind my back hiding and sneaking with him.  I called him one day and she was on the other line with him, she got him to lie to me about him being tired and wanting to go to sleep rather then just tell me that they were on the phone talking.  How can someone who calls themself your bestfriend lie to you and get other people to lie to you.  She should have been a woman and just tell me she was into my friend. I already told her I wasn't interested him and really didn't care if she dated him.  Obviously she wasn't believing me and if she didn't believe me and thought I liked the guy why would you sneak behind my back and talk to him anyway.  What kind of shit is that for someone who is suppose to be a best friend.  When I was planning my wedding she had the worst attitude. She would say just tell me where to be.  She was suppose to be my Maid of Honor and she didn't offer to help me with a damn thing. Another situation was with this blog stuff.  Another friend of mine that I introduced her to( Should have learned my lesson from the first friend)got us to start blogging.  I gave him the address to my blog and he gave me his and I also gave mine to her.  Well for some reason, I couldn't get the address to her blog only he could have it.  What kind of BS is that.  Here you are willing to share your thoughts with someone who you just met, through me no less, but I am not privledged enough to read your blog.  I figure she must be writing stuff about me or something for her not to want me to read it.  Whatever the case may be I just thought that was crazy.  No telling what she might be telling this friend.  I just hope that he can just see through her BS and see the real truth about situations. I can sit here and write a book about things that she use to do that tried my patience with her.  However her taking that "I don't care that I hurt your feelings attitude" broke my patience. How can someone who suppose to be your bestfriend not care that she hurt you and tell you, "you'll get over it."?  The thing that always bothered me is how her and my ex always talked on the phone when I wasn't around.  I found that to be really unappropriate.  I'm sure anyone else would have a problem with that, especially with the incident with her and the friend of mine.  I had to finally ask my ex not to call her when I'm not around.  I mean I didn't sit there calling his bestfriend.  I don't see it as being insecure I just don't think it is a proper thing to do.  Someone correct me if I'm wrong.  How would you feel if your supposed fiance is running to your bestfriend about his family problems or problems between you and him/her?  And then your supposed best friend doesn't even come to you and tell you about it.  You just find out through slips in conversation or after the fact.  The other big waste of my life is my ex Chadrick.  I wish I never ever ever met him.  I'm still dealing with crap that he left with me.  He still owes me $1600 in money that I loaned him and shit that I paid for him.  When I addressed him on that, he told me I should just take it as a lose.  Sometimes I wish I could just kick my own ass for ever loving him.  At this point now, I truly hate that man and wouldn't piss on him if he was on fire.  Now that I look back I realize that I was nothing but a rebound for him.  Now I see why is ex wife tried to kill and poision his ass.  Too bad she didn't succeed that would have saved me from meeting him and wasting my time.  That's another long book there.  After these two people I honestly have closed my heart to caring for or giving my feelings to any other person.  I don't trust ANYONE anymore and i'm just looking for when the next person is going to fuck up.  In the past year I've ran across people that did nothing but screw me.  One guy stole my computer and another person stole my engagement ring.  The ones that haven't taken something from me don't really make an effort to be a "friend."  Most of them leave me on the back burner and call me once in a blue moon if at all.  Most the time I have to call them, that is about to stop.  People are so fake it's unbelievable. I'm so tired of dealing with fakes.  There are times when I wish I could just leave this world because there is honestly nothing here for me. I have happy moments like today but they never last.  Most the time, I don't even smile anymore.  My parents called me Friday about some law offices looking for me.  I heard the message and it says that some aquaintance of mine gave them my number to reach me.  I have a very funny feeling this has something to do with my ex.  A year and a half and it seems like his punk ass is still haunting me.  I'd do anything just to erase him out of my memories and life. Lord, I don't ever want to fall in love again especially to a punk ass man.  I really don't believe in that mess anymore. Loves is nothing but a bunch of BS.  I don't want to turn bitter like my ex-friend but I sure am not going to let people waste my time anymore.  I can't stand to get close to anyone else.  The idea alone makes me sick.  On a brighter side the one person that so far I am glad to have met and don't feel like i'm wasting my time is my bestfriend David.  I pray that we stay good friends till we die.  Now he is a person that actually cares and acts like he has a heart.  He would give me the shirt off his back if I needed it and I would definitely do the same. We've never had a falling out.  Whenever I've had get togethers at my home he was always willing to bring something or come early and help out. He was never bitter no matter how much he's gone through.  Doesn't carry a chip on his shoulder or anything like that.  I had a conversation with a friend of mine about him and why I wouldn't ever consider dating him.  I love my best friend but we've been friends for so long and we've become so close that I feel he is more of a brother to me now.  And I can't stand his nose...lol.  Other then that, my best is the only other person other then my own parents that I trust.  And sometimes even with them I look for them to screwup because they are only human.  I'm just tired of being kind hearted to everyone but still get fucked over in the end.  My dad says, "Welcome to the real world."  I'm just glad I didn't marry that son of a B....  And I'm also glad that I'm free from dealing with people's bitterness.  Wow...that has been bottled up inside of me for a year now.  It feels good to let that out.

      Well since I haven't posted in centuries, I thought I would start over and have a new beginning.  For my first new post I would like to share a short story that I've written.  I hope you enjoy.   Qutie  you can still post it on your page if you like.   Fatal Surprise     PART I    *SLAP*  Deon's cheek hadn't even stopped stinging from the first slap before Chantal laid another one on him.  The pain shot through his body like a bolt of lightning and caused a single tear to drop from his eye, but he knew he deserved it.    "You lying bastard!!  How could you fuck that bitch?"  Chantal paced back and forth furiously.  "I hate you Deon Christopher Waller and I never want to see you again!  Get out!!"  Chantal's usage of his full name and the cold dagger tone of her voice sent a chill straight up his spin.  Deon turned to talk away but his brain yelled to him,  Fool you can't give up that easily!  You love this woman.   He spun around in pure determination. Ready for a fight, he stared into Chantal's beautiful light gray eyes and suddenly he found himself melted onto his knees.  He wrapped his arms around her petite waist and began to beg for her forgiveness.  As the tears fell down his cheeks, he poured his heart out to her.  "Chantal...baby...I love you and I...I... can't live without you.  It was a mistake!  I promise you!  I didn't realize what was going on till it was too late.  The boyz took me out drinking after work and...umm...I guess I had a little too much.  All I remember is this lady coming up to me and whispering something into my ear.  Next thing I know, I wake up in a strange bed...a strange room...a strange house!  Baby, believe me, I'm sorry...I'm truly sorry!  I let the alcohol and the dog take over my common senses.  You know I have never ever given you a reason to doubt me.  You know I love you with all my heart!  You're...you're...you're my soul mate, my one true love, and I can't live without you!"  The emotions took over him and he began to weep like a little child who just fell of their bike for the first time.  He was just as hurt and bruised but his bruise was in his heart.  He thought to himself,  how could I be such an ass? How did I end up here?  Maybe I shouldn't have told her.  This whole confession shit Usher started really is overrated!!   He then realized that Chantal hadn't flattened him onto his ass and he slowly lifted his eyes to see what her facial expression was saying.  When his eyes finally reached Chantal's face he noticed her eyes were shut like she was trying to fight back the tears but they found routes to escape and were running down her glorious honey brown skin.  The sight of her crying broke his heart.  He never liked to see her cry and vowed he wouldn't be the one to cause her to cry.  He wanted to be the shoulder she cried on.  He really fucked up.  After what seemed like an eternity of silence, Chantal in an almost mute tone stated, "I failed you didn't I?  I caused you to sleep with that woman!  If I would have given you more sex or been around more you wouldn't have done this...it's my fault isn't it."  Hearing that made, Deon jump to his feet,   "Hell nah, baby...it's my fault!  I shouldn't have drunk so much.  I should have had enough sense about me to just bring my black ass home!  Please don't blame yourself...please...don't!" Chantal stared him in his blood shot eyes and softly said, "I need you to leave me alone right now!  I need time to think!"    PART II    "Better yet...I'll leave."  Chantal grabbed her purse and headed for the door.  She needed time; better yet she needed a drink.  "Baby...wait...don't leave like this!  Let's talk.  I'm..."  Deon was cut off by the slamming of the front door.  The next thing he heard was the sound of Chantal's Mercedes Benz flying out of the driveway, he just fell back into the coach and wished he could go back to last week.  Chantal reached Backstreet Bar & Grill, a quaint little bar located on the backstreets of downtown Atlanta.  She headed straight to the bar and ordered a Purple Passion.  Before the bartender could hand it to her; Chantal gulped it down and ordered another.  "Whoa...baby...you should slow down there.  I would hate to have to take your keys away." The bartender threw her a smile and she notices how much he resembled Morris Chestnut.  As she sat there drowning her pain and sorrows, she sat there wondering what her next move should be.  Deon was her husband and she never suspected him of cheating on her before in all seven years they were together.  There three year wedding anniversary was in two days.  What a present, she thought to herself.  In the background, she could here Eamon's song, Fuck It and began to sing along...   See I don't, know why, I liked you so much I gave you all, of my trust I told you, I loved you, now that's all down the drain Ya put me through pain, I wanna let u know that I feel  Fuck what I said it don't mean shit now Fuck the presents might as well throw em out Fuck all those kisses, it didn't mean jack Fuck you, you ho, I dont want you...   Chantal broke down and started to cry.  Suddenly she felt a hand rub her back and heard a voice ask, "Are you okay?"  When she looked up she was greeted by a beautiful mocha colored sistah with Asian features.  Even with her tear distorted vision, the woman standing before her was absolutely gorgeous.  She was smiling the brightest and most inviting smile.  Her lustrous jet black hair flowed down her back while a few strands escaped and rested along side her full-figured breast. Her legs seemed never ending only accentuated by the red silk mini dress and the matching red pumps.  She looked like she just stepped off the cover of either Essence or Jet magazine.  Any other time Chantal would have tried to find something wrong with such a woman, to make herself feel better, but tonight she was fighting other insecurities.  Again the lady repeated, "Are you okay?"   "Oh...umm...I'm fine." Chantal wiped her eyes and blew her nose.  "You don't look fine.  How about I buy you a drink and you tell me all about it.  I'm a great listener."  "No, really I'm...I'm...fine."  Chantal couldn't keep up the façade and broke out in tears again.  "Hey Roland, can you get us each an Orgasm, please.  This lady here looks like she needs a good one."  The bartender winked and said, "Always eager to please!"  Chantal was shocked by the lady's statement and fell out laughing.  "Ha...I knew that would help.  Hi...my name is Kyla...looks like you need a friend."  Kyla sat down and within minutes the bartender came back with their drinks.  "Now tell me what the dog did!"  "Huh?"  "Girl, I know how it is.  You are sitting here in a bar all by yourself, drinking, and crying...has to be a man.  And any man that would make a woman cry...has to be a dog."  Chantal just smiled and took a sip of her Orgasm.  Finally she replied, "The dog is my husband."  "Hmmm...let me guess.  You found out he's been cheating on you."  "Something like that, he confessed to me today that he had a one night stand with some woman he met.  He said it happened this past weekend.  I thought he was out with his boyz."  "What?  Oh man, that's crazy.  I'm sorry girl."  "You're not sorry...my husband is!"  "So what are you going to do?"  "I don't know he seemed genuinely sorry and he's never given me a reason not to trust him before.  But how could I trust that this won't happen again.  I've never had a feeling he was cheating on me before.  He said he was drunk and lost his senses."  "That's no excuse.  I believe the things you do when you drink are the same things you would do if you were sober...the liquor just takes away the fear of acting it out."  "Damn...our anniversary is in two days and I had a big surprise for him but I guess he surprised me first."  Chantal and Kyla continued talking till closing time.    PART III    Like a sensual fragrance, the voice of Lenny Williams streamed all through the split level house.   ...I, I love you, baby With all my heart and soul Oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  Love you I need you I want you I need you  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...   The stereo had been playing the same cry for hours.  Deon refused to let any other song occupy his thoughts.  The flames in the fireplace were no longer aflame; just an occasional crackle and simmering hum permeated the room.  He closed his eyes and reflected on one particular line in the song:  Some men need lots of women for their passions to feel but I want only you, girl.   Would Chantal ever believe that about him again?  A quick flash of light interrupted his darkness.  He glanced down at his wrist...no watch... hmmm .  He took a quick look over at the grandfather clock... 4:17a.m.    Finally Chantal was home and he could execute the request for forgiveness he had practiced over and over in his mind.  Chantal stared at the clock on the wood grain dashboard,  4:26a.m.   She had been sitting in the driveway for nearly ten minutes just gazing at the house.  For the first time she didn't want to go home.  She still wasn't prepared to confront Deon, her heart still wounded.  She closed her eyes to hold back the tears, only to be assaulted by images of Deon fucking another woman, his tongue exploring another pair of nipples, and his fingers satisfying another woman's cavity.  An icy chill ran up Chantal's spine.  She shook off those ghastly images and reached down for her cell phone.  *********************  Deon stood peeking out the living room bay window wondering why Chantal hadn't gotten out of the car yet.  Suddenly her headlights came back on and Deon jumped out of the way so she wouldn't see he was watching.  In a blink of an eye Chantal was gone.  What was going on?  He didn't understand.   Where could she possibly be going at 4:30 in the morning?   He dashed to the house phone and frantically dialed her number.   Damn...voicemail!     PART IV    As Chantal inverted through the five phases of sleep, she found herself stuck in stage one.  She was trapped in transition amid slumber and wakefulness.  A stimulating sensation coursed through her body causing an orgasmic sigh to leave her parceled lips.  The muscles of her thighs began to go into a highly enchanting spasm and her gem grew moist with each supple kiss.  On impulse, she stroked her already firm nipples.  Oh, how she adored the way Deon caressed her body.  Suddenly, a wet exotic entity invaded her, by now, throbbing womanly cavity.  She arched her back to allow deeper entry of this pleasing invasion.  Swiveling her hips, she thought how Deon's tongue could always speak to her lips in a dialect her body surely appreciated.  "Mmmm" she thought... Why did I come back?  I should have... Wait!   She jolted out of her semi conscious state.   Where the hell..Who?   "Oh shit!!  What..."  Chantal scrambled across the bed; her eyes rapidly scanning over the unfamiliar room in search for the closest exit route.   Think...think...how did you end up here.   She frantically gathered up the sheet to cover her bareness.  She searched for the voice that normally belonged to her but nothing was escaping her lips.  Instead she heard Deon's voice saying, "...Next thing I know, I wake up in a strange bed...a strange room...a strange house!"  Could this really be happening?   Was this how he felt all but two days ago?   She grabbed at her chest; gasping for air...she couldn't breathe. "Chantal...baby...Are you okay?"   She searched her mind for this person's name.  She knew this person but how?  Where?   I know the name...It's...It's...It's ..."Kyla!"  "Yes...Tell me what you need.  Do you want me to bring you some water?"  Chantal shook her head, no.  "Kyla, what the hell is going on?" The edge of Kyla's lips curved up and a seductive glaze took over her eyes.  "I just thought I would start up part two."  "Part two?"  Chantal was puzzled.  "Wait...let me think!"  As she concentrated on remembering, flashes of the yesterdays escapade came rushing through her mind.  She recalled meeting Kyla at Backstreet Bar & Grill and them exchanging numbers in the parking lot.  She flashbacked to sitting in her driveway watching Deon peer out the window...  Chantal, not knowing who she could call at 4:30 in the morning spotted Kyla's number lying on the passenger seat.  She hesitated at first but recalled that Kyla had offered her the guestroom if she needed it.  She took one last look at the living room window and dialed her cell.  Kyla was still awake; she was having trouble sleeping and didn't mind the company.  Chantal rolled up in front of her Buckhead Townhouse around five in the morning.  They sat in front of the marble fireplace sipping on Alize and comparing male drama stories.  The glow from the fireplace reflected off of Kyla's face setting off her eye-catching skin tone.  With her hair put up in a ponytail, Chantal noticed how slim and tantalizing her neckline appeared.  Chantal became the moth to Kyla's fire. Chantal couldn't help but notice the sensual way her full glossed lips formed each word.  She couldn't understand where this sensation was coming from but she craved this stunning spirit sitting across from her.  With impaired judgment, Chantal delicately outlined Kyla's lips with her index finger bringing her to a halt in mid sentence.  Touching her lips wasn't enough though, she wanted to experience them and that she did.  Placing her moistened lips where her finger once explored, she began to kiss Kyla with a desire she never felt before. Not even with Deon.  What really surprised her was that Kyla was matching the passion.  Her hands ran over Chantal's body like newly pressed silk, stopping to fondle regions most men overlook.  She knew all the tantalizing spots to stroke because she knew her own body.  Her tongue then imitated her hands and caressed Chantal's body.  She began taking the southern route, moving slowly down from neck to breast to the navel to the inner thighs...  Imagining the peak Kyla had brought her body to earlier made Chantal's coochie pulsate and her breathing escalate.  Chantal released her grip on the sheet, revealing her aroused nipples. With a devilish smile she said, "Part two."    PART V    It was now Sunday evening and Deon still hadn't heard from his wife.  His eyes were blood-shot and the veins were popping up in his forehead.   He hadn't gotten any sleep in over twenty four hours and it was draining him.  He was no longer the baby face twenty-nine year old.  He had aged ten years in less then a day.  As he continued to pace within the foyer, he clutched the cordless phone waiting for it to ring.  The few times the phone rang;  one call was from his law office and he sent it straight to voicemail , second call was from his boy...voicemail, the last call came up unknown so he quickly answered it...  "Hello?!"  "Hey dawg, I've been trying to reach you all day.  What happened to you the other night?  Last I saw you; you were out on the dance floor with that fly honey."  Shit, it was his boy Easton.  Music was just blaring in the background.  "What the fuck you want man?"  "Damn...it's like that?  What the hell is wrong with you?"  "I'm just going through some shit right now...I have to call you back."  Before his boy could protest, Deon hung up the phone.  He didn't mean to respond to his friend in such an unkind manner but he felt as though Easton was part of the reason why he was in this mess and just wasn't ready to deal with him right now.  Easton was the one that insisted they all go drinking to celebrate the victory of their most high profile case.  I should've just gone home like I planned.  Deon's idea of celebrating was going home and sexing his wife for countless of hours in every position his mind and body would allow him.  However, Mr. Just voted one of Atlanta's most eligible bachelors wanted to go to The Velvet Room and have his ego stroked by a bunch of money hungry club hoes.    If I wouldn't have gone to that club... damn Easton kept buying all those damn drinks for the group...shit!  Deon's fist went crashing straight into the wall. "Aaarrggghhhh...damn!"  He stared at his white dusty hand which was beginning to bleed at the knuckles.  He became dizzy and made his way over to the living room sofa and before his head could hit the cushion, he was comatose.  **************  Chantal eyes gradually opened and were greeted by the moon light streaming through the bedroom window.   What time is it?  Her eyes scanned the room looking for a clock.  She caught sight of an alarm clock on the dresser across the room.  8:52pm...damn...I have to get out of here.  Chantal looked over at Kyla who was sound asleep and quietly slide out of the bed.  As she reached down to grab her belongings, Kyla stirred and Chantal halted.  Once Kyla was back at rest, she exhaled, successfully collected her belongings, and crept out the room.  Before exiting the room, she took one last look back.  What they shared was pleasurable and fulfilled her longtime hidden fantasy but she loved her husband and wanted to get back to him.  There was a lot that they needed to talk about. This was definitely a door she was going to have to close eternally.   Once I walk out this house there is no looking back.   She slowly closed the door to the bedroom and made her way downstairs into the living room to gather the rest of her possessions.   Damn...where is my other shoe?   She began searching around the living room but couldn't spot it anywhere.  She tried to retrace her steps but her memory was completely fogged.   Hmmm...maybe it got pushed under the sofa.  She reached her hand under the sofa, blindly searching for her other shoe.  Her hand landed on a mysterious item.  She pulled it out from under the sofa and her heart nearly leaped out her chest.  She fell back onto her heels and just held the object in her hand.   Oh my God!     PART VI     "No, this can't be!"  Tears began falling from Chantal's eyes onto the item in her hand.  She turned it over and read the expected engraving... I'll forever love you, Chanti .  She was staring down on the 14k gold wrist watch she purchased Deon for their first wedding anniversary.    "Chantal, are you leaving?"  Kyla's drowsy voice startled Chantal out of her devastation.  "It was you!"  "What?"  Kyla gazed, baffled by her statement.  "You slept with my husband!"  "I...what?"  Kyla was fully alert now.  She wasn't sure she heard that statement clearly.  Before she could pose the question again, Chantal rushed her and seized her by her hair.  Digging her nails into Kyla's scalp she shoved the watch into Kyla's face with the other hand.  "Bitch!  I gave this to him on our anniversary. You fucked my husband."    "Ooouucchhh...Chantal, I'm sorry!  I didn't know..." Kyla's screeched out.  "You didn't know...what the fuck do you mean you didn't know!  That $3000 band on his hand should have told you he was a married man."  "I didn't...I...I..."  "I...I...I...didn't what bitch.  You didn't care?!  It's obvious you didn't care!  Then you took advantage of my ass."  "What?!  You came onto me..."  "The hell I did!  You knew what I was going through.  Getting me drunk and shit!  You're nothing but a triflin ass hoe.  How many other marriages have you ruined?"  Chantal was enraged.  Her face felt like it was on fire.  This was the woman that seduced her husband.  Chantal yanked Kyla up by her hair and hurled her up against the wall.  She wrapped her hands around Kyla's neck and began choking her.  Kyla pounded on her arms trying to free herself from Chantal's grip.  But the harder she struggled the stronger Chantal's grip became.  Chantal's gray eyes were now blackened and her stare was of death.  Images of Deon kissing and fondling Kyla raced through Chantal's mind.   ...All I remember is this lady coming up to me and whispering something into my ear.  Next thing I know, I wake up in a strange bed...a strange room...a strange house!  Baby, believe me, I'm sorry...I'm truly sorry!...   Deon's voice hummed through her head.  Suddenly Chantal froze and her hold loosened around Kyla's neck.  "What am I doing?"  She promptly let go and Kyla slide down the wall sobbing.    "I'm sorry Chantal...I'm sooo sorry.  It was a simple mistake...we were drunk and dancing...then one thing led to another....I'm so so sorry!" Kyla cried out.  Chantal just glared down at Kyla, who was now lying on the ground in a fetal position rocking back and forth.   How did I end up here?  God I need to get out of here.   Chantal grabbed her things and ran out the door not caring that she was still missing her shoe.  She jumped in her car, rested her head against the steering wheel and began to wail.  She cried for what seemed an hour.   Maybe this is all just a bad dream.  Any minute now I'm going to wake up wrapped in my husband's arms on a beautiful warm sunny Saturday morning.   Chantal squeezed her eyes tightly shut just waiting to wake up but to no avail she was still drowning in her misery.  With tears overflowing her eyelids she started up the car and headed towards I-85, full speed.  She wasn't sure what she was going to say or if they would be able to fix this critical mistake but she had to get home.  *********************** 	 Deon was awoken by the telephone ringing.  He jumped up and fumbled to punch the talk button on the cordless.  "Hello...Hello?"  "Hello, Mr. Waller?" An unfamiliar voice rang back through the receiver.  "Yes, this is he."  He answered with the sound of disappointment in his tone.  "I'm calling from Northside Hospital.  I'm sorry to inform you but your wife was involved in a major automobile accident and..." before the nurse could complete her statement Deon had keys in hand and sprinted towards the front door.  He jumped in his Navigator, charged out of the driveway, and raced towards the hospital like Mario Andretti.  Weaving in and out of traffic at 95mph, Deon couldn't help but think the worse.  He clutched the steering wheel and began to pray.   Lord, please don't take my beautiful wife away from me.  I need her in my life.  I'm nothing without her.  She doesn't deserve this, Lord.  Please, we always kept you first in our marriage.  I'm coming to you with head bowed Lord and asking you to please spare my love.  I need her!  Please let her be okay. Please.  Please. Please...  Deon wiped away his tears.  He arrived in front of the hospital in record time: quickly located the parking lot, parked, and raced to the emergency room.  He reached the front desk gasping for air.  He frantically asked the petite Asian nurse located at the front desk, which room his wife was in.  "I'm sorry sir but..." Deon felt his heart plummeting. "...they still have her in the operating room."  "Operating room...Is she all right?"  "Right now sir, I don't have all the details but if you would just take a seat in the waiting room; the doctor will update you as soon as he can.  Oh and sir, can you please complete this insurance information."  The nurse handed Deon a clipboard and directed him to the waiting room.  As he sat there staring at the forms, the letters seemed to reposition on the page.  Suddenly, he was dyslexic; all the words seemed upside down and backwards.   When he was finally able to read the words and tried to fill out the forms his hands were shaking.  Finally, he gave up and laid the clipboard aside.   Damn...tell me this is all a bad dream.      PART VII     Deon sat in the waiting room with his head propped up against the wall and his eyes tightly closed.  He was battling an overwhelming sense of guilt.  He thought,  If only I could turn back the hands of time.   However, he knew that wasn't possible and he was going to have to deal with the here and now of the situation.    "Mr. Waller?"   Deon's eyes flashed open and met with the weary gaze of a middle aged Caucasian man.  His salt and pepper hair gave him a distinguished look.  But his eyes were what made Deon's heart race; they disclosed mourning.  "Mr. Waller, my name is Dr. Schaffer..."  "Dr. How is my wife?"  "Your wife was brought in with massive trauma to the head and a shattered rib.  We've managed to control the internal bleeding and have her stabilized for now however she is in a comma.  There is no telling how long she will be in an unconscious state or exactly the extent of her injuries at this present time.  We are currently waiting on the results from her cat scan..."  As Deon stood there the room went from an orchestra of clamor to a place of a chilling silence.  The doctor's lips were moving but he didn't hear the any words emerging.   No more did he hear the pregnant woman across the way doing her breathing exercises or the squeaking of the nurse's hospital shoes as they walked by.   The doctor placed a hand on his shoulder and guided him back down to his seat.  Deon positioned his face into his hands and tried to shake off the sudden deafness.        "...Waller?  Mr. Waller.  Mr. Waller!"   Deon's hearing came back full force.  "Mr. Waller!"  "Huh?  I mean yes."  "Do you think you are strong enough to visit with your wife?  I want you to talk to her, give her the drive she needs to live."  "But doc will she be able to hear me?"  "Observations have shown that even in a state of a comma, some individuals still respond to outside stimulus such as the sound of a love ones voice.  At this point son, it doesn't hurt to try." 	 Deon followed the doctor through the double doors and down a lengthy colorless corridor.  When they arrived in front of the Intensive Care Unit, Deon paused and said a quick prayer to give him courage for what he was about to see.  As he stepped into the room, his world came crashing in...    Part VIIIFinal Chapter    Deon stood there in utter disbelief.  The color drained from his face.    "This is not my wife."  "Pardon me?" 	 "Doctor, this is not my wife!"  The doctor walked over to the medical chart placed at the foot of the bed and read off the name, "Chantal D. Waller?"  "That's my wife's name but this is not her." 	 "Are you sure?"  "Doctor, I think I would know my wife if I saw here!"  "I don't understand!  That is the name we were provided when she was brought in."   Deon was totally confused, lying before him was the cause of his recent disorder...Kyla.  I  don't understand!  This doesn't make any sense!   He couldn't remember her name but he remembered her face.    "Mr. Waller, we have some of her possessions here and there is a wallet full of credit cards and bank cards with the name Chantal D. Wallace.  There was no other identification found on her.  Do you know her at all?"  "No...yes...I mean I've met her but I don't know her."   "What is her correct name?"  "I don't know.  I mean I don't remember.  Look Doctor, I have to go and find my wife.  I have to find out what the hell is going on."Just as Deon turned to leave his cell phone rang. 	 "Hello?"  "Deon..."  Chantal faint voice sounded into the phone. 	 "Chantal!  Chantal where the hell are you?  What's going on?"  "I...ummm...I'm home.  Where are you?"  Her voice could barely be heard.  She sounded worn and exhausted."  "Home?  When did you get home?"  "I don't know Deon.  Where are you?  I need you to come home.  We need to talk."  "Yes we do.  I'm at the hospital."  "What!?  Are you okay?"  "Yes, I'm fine.  I got a call saying that you were here."  "What!?  Me?"  "Yes Chantal.  I don't know what the hell is going on?"  "I don't know either." 	 "I'm on my way!  Stay there!"  Deon flew out of the hospital and charged home.  As he pulled into the driveway of his house he was overwhelmed by a sense of panic.  Something was telling him that he was in for a surprise.  He gathered up his courage and stepped out the SUV.  He walked through the front door and found Chantal sitting in the living room holding the phone with a look of confusion on her face.  She handed him the phone without a word.  "Hello?"  "Mr. Waller, this is Dr. Schaffer..."  "Yes?"  "Back in the hospital you stated you knew the young lady that is in our care but couldn't remember her name.  Do you know where she might possibly live or if she has any family/friends in the area?"  "I'm sorry but I really can't remember much about her.  All I remember is her face.  I just met her one night at a bar." Chantal's eyes grew wide.   "Well if you remember her name please give me a call back at the hospital.  It is very important we reach someone, it doesn't appear as though she will make it through the night."  "Wow, okay.  I'll be sure to call you if I remember anything."  Deon hung up the phone and Chantal ran into his arms, weeping.  There they stood for what seemed like an eternity just holding each other and sharing each others heartache and pain.  Chantal looked up at Deon with tears flowing down her cheeks and said, "Baby, I'm sorry!"  "No Chantal, I'm sorry.  I never meant to hurt you, I was just..."  Chantal placed a finger on Deon's lips. "I have something to tell you and I think you should sit down.  I met the woman you slept with!"  Deon felt his heart drop into his stomach.    "What? How?"  "Well, after I left here the other night I went to this bar...I was crying and she came over and started talking to me.  I stayed the weekend at her house and that's where I found this..."  She held up his watch.  Deon felt faint.  He could here his name being called but it seemed so distant.   Mr. Waller...Mr. Waller ..."Mr. Waller!"  Deon jumped up out of his sleep disoriented.  When he became alert, he realized he was still sitting in the waiting room of the hospital.  He had fallen asleep.   Oh thank God, it was just a dream...a crazy dream.   He rose up to meet the doctor.  "Mr. Waller, I'm Doctor Rossiter..."  "Doc, how is my wife?"  "Your wife is doing fine however we were unable to save the baby."  "Baby?"  "Yes, she was three months pregnant."  Deon slumped down in the chair.  "We had been trying for a year now to get pregnant.  We didn't think she would be able to get pregnant.  She..."  Deon chocked on his words.  "Mr. Waller, I'm sorry.  We tried everything we could but we failed."  "No, I failed!  Doc, can I see my wife now?"  "Sure.  Let me show you the way."  Deon followed the doctor through the double doors and down a lengthy colorless corridor.   When they arrived in front of the Intensive Care Unit, Deon paused and said a quick prayer for strength and walked in to the room.  There laid his picturesque wife.  Even with, her hair disheveled, lips chapped, and plugged up to all kinds of machines she still looked like an angel but she also had a look of grief.  "I'll leave you two alone."  The doctor turned and left the room.    Deon walked over to Chantal's bedside where she laid sleeping.  He delicately brushed the hair away from her face then bent down and kissed her gently on the lips.  "Chantal, what have I done to you?  I never meant for things to turn out this way.  It was all just a stupid mistake.  I'm soooo sorry."  Deon began weeping but he was interrupted by a phone ringing.  He checked his cell phone but it wasn't his he looked around the room and spotted Chantal's belongings.  He went over and found her cell phone.  "Chantal, please don't hang up and don't say anything just listen please.  I didn't know he was your husband and I'm really sorry but I'm not sorry about what we shared.  These pass two days have been magic for me and I never felt like this about anyone.  I know you're probably upset and confused right now but..."  The phone came crashing down to the ground and Deon just looked at his wife still laying there in her slumber.   The Endmaybe

      Yesterday around 9:30pm my friend Richard(my "card game" friend) calls me and asks if he and a friend, who's visiting from Conneticut, could come by(hmmm...he is introducing me to alot of his boys and family). I agreed and they arrived at my house around 10:15pm. We all sat around listening to music and watching television. Richard's friend James was really nice and all of us had a really great conversation going. We got into the male vs woman type conversation. Both gentleman came with their own alcoholic beverages and when Richard ran dry on his he decided to run up to the gas station to purchase another bottle, leaving me alone with his friend. We made small chat and he made a comment about me looking really nice and how Richard must tell me that all the time. I laughed and informed him that wasn't the case. He then informed me that he would tell me all the time (another line I've heard before). I got the sense that he was trying to figure out the terms of Richard and my friendship. As the night turned into early morning we all talked more, told stories, and debated on issues. Now that I think of it, that is the most I've spoke to Richard in one sit down and he really is a good conversationalist. I was enjoying myself so much, I failed to notice that it was 2am and I have to be up at 6:30. When Richard stepped outside to smoke a cigarette, James expressed his concern about it being so late and me having to go to work soon so he told Richard they had to go. I didn't mind being up so late cause I was having such a good time that I wasn't even tired. I went to shake James hand to say goodbye and he grabs me up off my chair for a hug and I could see that Richard wasn't liking that very much but then I went to Richard and hugged him as well. As I was hugging Richard, his hands started to slide down my backside and I made a comment about him watching his hands, all in good fun, and that seemed to set something off in his head. He asked James to go sit in the car cause he wanted to talk to me in private. At first I sensed a little hesitation with James but he went down to the car and Richard came back inside. He looks at me and asks, "I can't touch you now?" I informed him that I was a little hurt by him lying about his girl in Jamaica; I thought we were cool and he should have been honest. He admits that he was wrong for lying and apologized then again asks me, "So I can't touch you no more?" I hugged him and told him not until he can honestly say him and his girl are not together anymore. Instead of releasing me from the hug, his hands start to travel, he kisses me softly on the neck (hot spot) and tries to kiss me. I gave him a short peck on the lips and said goodbye. I headed to bed. Just as I get into a comfortable position, my phone rings and I know who it is but I didn't expect to hear what I heard...  I pick up the phone and of course it's Richard on the other end. First, he comments on how I looked really nice and sexy. Then he apologizes again for not being honest with me and asks if he could come over alone tomorrow night. I told him I would sleep on it and call him. Then he proceeds to tell me that his friend James told him, once they got in the car, that he likes me too and wants to get with me. So here they both are wanting the same girl and they come up with the idea of a threesome. I was shocked. I mean who doesn't have that fantasy but this is the first time, I was given the proposition. They tell me to sleep on it and let them know. James is going to be here till Sunday/Monday. I keep running the proposition in my head and I just don't now if I could actually get down like that. I really really am attracted to Richard and would love to date him but then there is the girl in Jamaica and the wondering would he be faithful. I keep thinking if I do this how would Richard view me after? The thought of a threesome is so very tempting though. I have a hard decision to make, and I have to make it by Friday or Saturday night.  Stay tuned...

      Wow, I don't know where to begin. So many things to talk about and so little time/space. First I was so excited on Friday cause I had my last final for the summer semester. I was just so happy to get through the semester I didn't even care how I did on the final cause I knew I would be passing the class no matter what. Right before I left work for class that Friday, I hear on the radio that Rick James was found dead in his apartment, died in his sleep and "Mr Big" had a stroke. Two very sad pieces of news. It shocked me even more because just the other day I saw both of these gentlemen singing on the BET awards. Rick James was only 56 years old; another reminder that tomorrow is not promised. Well, after my final I had an rendezvous to meet up with  Sammy,  a guy I originally met on Blackplanet and have been chatting with four a couple of weeks. He was scheduled to be at that library down the street from my school around the time I would be getting out of class so we decided to finally meet up face to face. We met up around 6:45pm and decided to go to a movie. We ended up seeing  The Bourne Supremacy.  I liked  Identity  better, this second part didn't have as much action and suspense as the first part. Sammy commented how the cinematic was definitely lacking. The camera positioning were poor compared to the first one but he thought it was still a good movie. I say it was just okay. Saturday, was a pretty relaxing day. My friend Richard came over with his cousin Andre around 10am and we chilled out watching a couple of movies and ordered some Chinese food. After they left, I took a little nap and re-did some of my braids. Around 8:45pm, Sammy called me to see if he could still come over to study and get some dinner, I agreed and he showed up at my house around 9:30pm. He is currently taking an intense, three week, real estate class so when he came over we sat down and had dinner, curry chicken and rice, then we did the Q&amp;A thing. He did pretty well. He is very very smart so I have no doubt that he will pass his real estate exam and do very well in the real estate field. I find myself fascinated by his intellect and ambitious attitude however at this point in time, I don't see anything romantic between us. Sunday was family day. I went over to my parents house and we took my dad to brunch for his birthday. We went to this restaurant called,   C'est Bon  . It was a Cajun buffet style brunch, pretty good. I did have a slight allergic reaction to a etouffe they had which contained crawfish, shrimp, and something else covered with a creamy sauce. It was delicious but my throat wasn't feeling it. I started to feel like my throat was shutting close which was so crazy because I've all while I was growing up, I was never allergic to anything now as I get up in age it seems like I'm becoming allergic to everything. I went to get my eyebrows arched and got an allergic reaction to the wax. Now my eyelids are puffy, only slightly cause I've been putting ice on it. Anyway, Sunday night I had a couple of visitors but the one that really stands out is Richard. I really really am attracted to Richard however I don't think I could date him though. He seems to fib a lot. He claims it's not that he lies he just jokes around a lot but I never know when he's telling the truth or joking. I wouldn't be able to trust him if we dated each other but man is he fine. I might have to just make him a "cutt buddy." Well, all in all, I had a pretty nice weekend. Right before I went to sleep something that Sammy had said popped in my head and I realized he was right....I do have a fan club (not to sound conceited). However Sammy also made a good point, he said, "Let the best behave man win." Right now, I'm just enjoying the frienships and dates that I have.  OHHHHHH....the best news I got all week (I know I'm about to sound really mean or vicious but I'm really not) was from my mother. She informed me that she saw my ex not too long ago. She said, "He got fat." I laughed and said he must be enjoying those pies at the bakery he works at, either that or he has a girlfriend that is fattening him up. After that comment, I realized that it didn't even bother me to think he might have girlfriend. Not even a couple of months ago, I would have almost cried at the thought of him being in another relationship but I actually and honestly don't car anymore. It made me laugh when my mom said that he was still walking and staying in the same old apartments. I remembered countless of arguments we had about him always being content with situation and never striving to upgrade in life. Oh well, I'm upgrading in my life and that is all that counts to me. I think if we would have gotten married, I would have ended up stuck and not be where I am today even if it's not much.   That was my weekend!

      You know, it's weekends like this past weekend that make me think...I'm so glad I didn't get married....LOL. Saturday, I spent the day hanging up clothes that were way overdue to be put away. Then my parents came by for a few hours and we chilled out watching movies. After they left I just enjoyed a nice quiet evening at home. Sunday, I woke up late so I ended up late for church but I still went. After church, I stopped my my parents house to tell my dad a happy early birthday being that I wouldn't have the opportunity to see him on Monday. My mother and I did a small grocery shopping at 285 Farmer's Market and I went home and made a wonderful meal that consisted of white rice, turkey, and eggplant w/ cashew nut. I decided to invite a friend of mine over since he is always asking me what I'm cooking and I rarely do cook. He finally managed to make it to my house around 10pm. He came up with a card game of Strip or Dare. The object of the game was both people pick a card and the person with the highest number loses. The winner then gets to give the loser a dare or the loser can opt out and remove and article of clothing or accessory. I saw I was at a disadvantage from the get go because he was wearing a hat, two shirts, pants, boxers, socks, and shoes. I on the other hand was wearing a bra, tank top, skirt, and undies. So you can already tell how this game was heading....LOL. Anyway, for some reason I kept getting the higher card, losing almost every time even when I dealt. I don't even have to tell you what some of his dares were cause him thinking up that game let's you know where he was heading. I opted out a lot of the times and took off a ring and bra but I maintained most of my covering. He ended up with his shirt off and I couldn't help but admire his chest. The last dare of the game led us straight into the bedroom where it got pretty hot and heavy. We said our good-byes somewhere around three a.m. and now I'm making it on ghetto coffee but he did promise to be back Tuesday. At least he is giving me a day to recover from this morning. Like I said, I'm loving the single life.
