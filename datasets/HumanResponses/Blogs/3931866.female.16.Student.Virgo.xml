      so this is kind of fun...a little addicting.  so how is everyone's summer's going?  mine has been very busy, i feel like i work all the time, but have no money to show for it.  i'm looking forward to High School Bible Memory camp, for which alecia and i are going early and staying with a dear friend, Holly, for the weekend before.  i'm working on a trumpet solo, well, kind of, more like a trio, but still like a solo, for jazz band.  ross is very kind for giving it to me.  anyone who would like to hear it should come to the school next tuesday at 9:30 am.  and i'm going to bed because i want to get up and tan tomorrow before work.  so goodbye

      so...liam and julie left.  i was kind of sad.  but i'm used to them not being here.  we haven't got pictures back yet.  mom was trying to use up the rest of the roll of film by taking totally retarded pictures...like me holding alecia's cat....wow, so exciting.   speaking of alecia's cat, she got it at the relief sale.  it's really cute!  i kind of wanted one, but i knew that mom and dad wouldn't go for it, and also cria and riel would probabaly eat it or something.  and i'd have to pay for it to get fixed and everything...just not worth it.   the relief sale was fun...but then i got really bored and almost like...homesick. which is really weird, cause i never get homesick, but all i could think about was going home, and i was kind of sick to my stomach, and i didn't want to eat anything, and when i didn't want to eat anything, i knew something was up, cause i always pig out at the relief sale because the food is so good.  so i left with barb, and got home, and slept for like...3 1/2 hours.  that was really nice...and then monica woke me up.  and we talked over pizza.  but i'm home now, and i'm still not really hungry.  and i'm still feeling kind of sick.  and i'm still crabby.  uungh.  this stinks.   monica was talking, adn she told me that micah had talked to her, and the rest is on the forum....it's good, go look.   peace out.  bethanne

      wow.  camp.  wow.  it was so awesome.  being around people who are on fire for God, who want you to grow closer to Him, and are praying for you is just an awesome experience.  the worship was amazing.  i just felt so close to God.  and what micah and joe said was exactly what i needed to hear.  and the other campers...it was so AWESOME to be around people my own age who were more focused on God than guys, (or girls).  it was just so (at the risk of sounding mushy) touching.  and also SOCCER B RULES!!!!!  we so need to play that at school!  for those of you who don't know what soccer b is, it is soccer/rugby in which girls can tackle girls, guys can tackle guys, and girls can tackle guys, but guys cannot tackle girls.  it is the best game ever!  you get out a lot of aggression.  i think i missed my calling...i should be playing football.  i was sick, and still taking girls out!  i wish i could do that in basketball.   oh, wait! i already do!  hehe, i made a funny.  wow.  ok.  well, i came home to a house full of people.  my grandma allen was here, and so was my real dad's youngest brother, his wife, and their two kids, along my cousin ariel, from florida.  that was friday, after i was totally exausted from driving home.  saturday grandma and grandpa swartz came over, and so did dean and elisa, with brittany, who terrorized poor riel until he ran far enough away i had to call for a while for him to come.  (most of the time, he is right there) sunday i got out of going to meeting by everyone taking a trip over to my mom's parents house....wow.  that was interesting.  my aunts and uncles are more than a little rough aroung the edges.  there were 4 babies there...and liam was the only one born in wedlock.  oh, there was one Born in wedlock, just not concieved.  does that count?  i don't think so. anyways, then i fell asleep adn had a nice nap, then got up and left.   i had to work today...that was not fun.  it was slow, and they had too many waitresses on, and so i only got a little bit in tips, which stems from going for about 3 hours of not having any tables.  kind of disappointing, but i got tomorrow off, i get to work wednesday late enough i don't have to go to bible study,  adn i have thursday and friday and saturday off for the jazz band concert and then the relief sale.   THE RELIEF SALE!!!!! i almost forgot about it!!!  wow.  it's, like, this weekend.  sweet.  crap...i have no money.  oh, well, God will provide.  (for my trip to cedar point, yea right. i better git working)  and to work, i need to sleep, so i'm going to bed...it's after 11.   it's not the end  it's still not the end  it's almost the end  it's not yet the end  it's the end  bye  BethAnne
