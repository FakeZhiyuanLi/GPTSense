      I will not hide behind your filter. I will not live inside your box, made thick with compassion/oppression and religious absolution/absoluteness. I will speak on truths that do not flow as psalms and hymns; not praising or comforting but truths, nonetheless.  Truths like brothers that kill brothers and whores that can love. I will speak on anger, distrust and uncertainty with God - yes, The Creator - because it happens, it's true. I will question the decisions of powerful men and misled sheep, lost, and waiting for the true Shepherd to return. I will speak on all this if I feel the need, while you sit quietly and carefully craft your scriptural response; So as not to offend (heaven's no) but to straighten me out as I must be astray.  I will speak of these truths as you shift in your seat, longing to be back in the pew where hymns and homilies are lilting and loving; Where ritual is certain and change is unwelcome; Where words chanted in unison bind us in word and belief. Chanting that is without dissent - the same words - the same convictions - the SAME faith, for an hour at least.  I will speak the cold, dark and sometimes angry truths. I will bring them out of the darkness and silence that gives them shelter and strength. I will shine the light of knowledge on them for an hour at least.

       Today I am thankful for:    Russell Simmons presents Def Poetry Jam on HBO   Having health insurance   Reduced Fat Wheat Thins   My Godson, and nephew, Dylan who turns 1 year old today   Sunshine   For having the opportunity to have known and been taught so much by my Dad, Bill.   Music that speaks all kinds of truth   The strength and hope that God places in my heart - it lifts me up on days that I struggle to stand on my own and He wraps his love around me so that I am free to share my love without rationing.     what are you thankful for today?
