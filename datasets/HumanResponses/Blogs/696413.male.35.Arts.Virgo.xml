      In the spirit of sharing, since this seems to be the place to do that, it occurred to me that one of the things that I wanted to do when this page was made was to write something that would be so inflammatory people would have to sit up and take notice. Then I backed away … but why? As the saying goes, no guts, no glory.   Simple Solutions to Complex Problems:    Pedophilia:   All this talk about priests and whatnot … well, I have the most elegant solution: castration and a tattoo. Cut them off and tattoo “Pedophile” on the forehead of the offenders … I guarantee that there will not be any repeat offenders. If anyone is creative enough to actually repeat after that, reopen the Roman Coliseum and let the lions have some fresh meat.             §§§§§§§    Drunk Driving:   Why do we talk about multiple offenses? That is obscene. First offense: the car is confiscated and sold, with all proceeds going into a fund for victims of the crimes. Licenses are suspended for life. If somebody whines about their “rights” being infringed upon, tough!   We had a diplomat from Russia in this city run over someone and get away with it because of “diplomatic immunity” – they weren’t immune enough to get drunk, but they are immune when it comes to infringing on the rights of others, the innocent victims of their crimes. It has to stop. I am not against drinking, by the way – not at all. Just the fools who decide to turn their cars into lethal weapons.             §§§§§§§   Since the issue of “diplomacy” has been broached, what is it with politics, anyway? Is this the field that people chose to go into when they have a pathological need to disseminate false information to the largest group of people over an extended period of time? In other words, the truth stops here.   Is there a written rule out there dictating that these esteemed individuals who are dedicating themselves to “public service” are also incapable of looking the electorate in the eye after they take office and telling the truth about anything?             §§§§§§§   Well … that’s enough rambling for now – time to go work on my string quartet.

      Welcome to my very first “Blog” entry … this is going to be a semi-journal-like “thingy” that is connected to my CrazyComposer site, which you can find  urlLink here . I hope you find these writings to be both interesting and perhaps even enlightening … maybe even enraging at times. I will promise one thing: you will not find the “same old thing” when you read what I write.    Is there an innate need for people to create things? Obviously, I cannot answer that for anyone else, but at the same time I cannot imagine what life would be like if I did not have the desire to create. To compose is to open up a world that did not previously exist – to fill it with anything that I desire, and give it life.     The quest for being truly expressive cannot end with the selection of a note or a melodic motif. The whole of the composition embodies the essence of the composer and through their creativity they are revealed. It is through the musical works that you will discover the deepest emotional secrets of a composer as nothing can be hidden in the quest for true creativity and expressiveness.    Enjoy your read!  Peter ... aka  CrazyComposer

      Is there something wrong with people being good to other people? Oh, I know, that sounds far too much like Oprah and the “random act of kindness”, but really, all I want to know is if there is some genetic predisposition within us that enables us to betray each other with ease … as if it is the easiest thing in the world to do.    As we are bombarded with news reports I seem to see a pattern emerge, and it all seems to be a variation on a simple theme: people all over the world taking every chance they can to hurt their neighbours. It seems to have become the modern “blood sport” to see just how much you can get away with before the law catches up with you … and if you are caught the game then becomes to find the best defense that deflects all responsibility away from the person who committed the violent act so that nobody every has to be personally accountable for anything.    It is so terribly sad.   §§§§§§§   Chaos …    There is something attractive to me about the idea of total randomness – of something moving along on its own without being constrained by a pre-ordained set of rules or a specific criteria established to control its eventual outcome.   For some people this is, perhaps, a frightening concept: the abandoning of control. Or it could, if taken to the extremes, represent a total disintegration of all law as we know it and, in turn, allow for the beginnings of a totally chaotic, or even anarchistic type of government. But I am really just talking about a method of composition: not some great metaphysical dilemma encompassing every aspect of the social order.    My idea of randomness, or perhaps chaos, relates to the way it has influenced composers dating as far back as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart who rolled a set of dice in order to generate melodic material for his music. We wouldn’t think of Mozart as a composer of aleatoric music in the same sense way as John Cage or other composers of the twentieth century, but the tradition and technique extends back for centuries.   A composer who wants to experiment with random elements in their music has countless tools available to them, from computer programs which will, literally, compose music given a set of specific parameters, through to the use of fractal algorithms, to more “traditional” means, such as using sets of dice to determine the pitch of the notes and even the rhythms in the music. The level that a composition can be given over to the chaos is really only limited to the particular abilities of the composer, or the limitations of their imagination.   Whatever method a composer decides to use, the quest for an “aleatoric style” leaves a composer with a daunting challenge: do they face the paragon of musical chaos, John Cage, or do they seek to find their own voice amongst the erratic happenings, and in so doing hope to create a piece that has some enduring value – something worthy of being revisited time and time again.   §§§§§§§   Supporting the Modern Composer:   There is a certain desperation amongst modern composers, I believe, in that the audiences to whom new music is being directed have become jaded by the availability of acoustic perfection as found through studio recordings. Everyone has access to their favourite music – so there is no longer an urgency for people to go to concerts: music will still be there tomorrow. At one point the concert hall was practically the only place where a person could go to hear a performance of large-scale works, but now the sound of the symphony can be heard coming from any personal stereo – and new music gets relegated to obscurity.    A person going to a concert faced with a programme of unfamiliar music must ask themselves “why should I subject myself to this  new  music?” Why indeed … the reason is simple: Because it is alive. We easily forget that Mozart and Beethoven were modern in their day, not all of the music that is embraced today came into the world so peacefully. Some of the most loved works of Tchaikovsky were condemned by the critics: but the performers persisted and the audiences learned that there was something in the music worth hearing.   We cannot allow “new music” to be so easily condemned: the only way that we will see the continuation of the art is to understand that artistic progress comes through continued experimentation, and artistic growth comes through allowing artists to develop their abilities in a supportive atmosphere. Creative work cannot be done in a vacuum, and no matter how many people hear the performance of a new composition it is vitally important to support the production of new music concerts, giving composers venues for their ideas and allowing audiences to hear what the future is producing.

       On Remembrance Day and World Peace    Today is Remembrance Day, the day we solemnly reflect upon the sacrifices made by those brave young men and women who offered their lives to preserve and protect our way of life. But it is so much more than that.    When I think of the horrendous acts that took place in the darkest days of the Second World War it is beyond my ability to believe that the world was able to withstand the convulsions of the plague set upon it. The "Thousand Year Reign" of the Nazis didn't even last a decade, but in their own warped way they helped shaped the course that our society would take by galvanizing the moral fiber of enough people - outraging them enough - to work to prevent the possibility of a reoccurrence of this global catastrophe.    The idea of the Peace Movement was not new to the world after WWII, but it certainly had more momentum, and more relevance as people began to realize that we simply could not afford to dedicate the economies of the world towards killing each other - which is why we had the Cold War, and the United States and the Soviet Union dedicated huge portions of their GNP towards the production of weapons and the maintenance of their military readiness (just in case the Soviet Union decided to attack the United States, each would be able to effectively destroy the world twenty times over)?.   Thus the world was introduced to the concept of MAD: Mutually Assured Destruction (or  "how effectively can we wipe ourselves off the face of the earth without leaving any trace that we ever existed?" ).   I would offer that Remembrance Day should be changed. Instead of a less of a solemn reflection on the past sacrifices, which should never be forgotten, we should have a call for international peace. Canada has been a powerful part of the international peace movement since the establishment of the United Nations Peace Keeping Forces, but that is no longer enough. We are living in a time where the risk of a terrorist attack with a device of mass destruction has left the realm of science fiction: can we still risk the threat of war between nations when we should be focusing on the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction, especially those which are particularly vulnerable to falling into the hands of people who would consider using them for political reasons - to instill terror into the hearts of innocent people.   Imagine what might happen if the resources used for the military in the world could be turned towards humanitarian efforts? How many schools could be built with what it costs to build and maintain an aircraft carrier - Or a hospital - housing for the poor - food for the hungry. The list is, sadly, endless. I don't know if we could end the problems of the world this way, but it seems to me that when you build weapons, in the end, somebody is going to want to use them - and that usually means they will try to find a way to do so - even if it is through political means. War is not something that we should be looking at in this time as a potential solution to problems. It is a barbaric response that we should be able to put behind us as we move further into this new millennium.   On this Remembrance Day, my thoughts will go out to those who died to help preserve the freedom we enjoy, but I will also be thinking?perhaps you can call it praying - about what this world may be like when we finally put an end to war. That will truly be a day to remember - a day for the world to rejoice, and for all of us to celebrate our freedom.

      Mental Health in Peril: Saving the Royal Ottawa  by Peter Amsel (aka  the CrazyComposer )   When I am introduced to someone it is usually as a composer, a writer, and a poet. Presently I am also on the board of directors of a new music society that presents concerts of contemporary classical music, and am the new Music Director of that organization. What usually doesn't come up in a conversation is that I also have an illness that I have been living with for about 19 years, and which has profoundly affected my daily living, and my ability to effectively interact with people, sometimes forcing me into a self-imposed exile to prevent the symptoms from overtaking me completely. I am speaking of bipolar affective disorder, otherwise known as manic depression. In essence, I am a crazy composer. Historically speaking, many far greater creative minds than mine have also been afflicted with this illness, including the likes of Robert Schumann, and Hector Berlioz, not to mention writers like Lord Byron and Sylvia Plath.  You may think it odd that someone would willingly admit that they have a mental illness, and in a sense, you would be correct: "normal" people don't want to talk about these things, and that is a serious problem. Mental illness, and consequently mental health has remained a marginalized: it is a ghettoized health concern and when it rears its ugly head it is turned into the "dirty little secret" that nobody wants to face. Unfortunately the world in which we live is making that attitude more difficult to maintain: while many are trying to cope with these illnesses and remain working, more people are ending up on medical leave for extended periods of time as they succumb to depression, manic depression, or one of the other illnesses that can become so overwhelming it becomes impossible to work. Mental illness has been described as the fastest growing cause of disability in the world by the World Health Organization, which reported in 2001 that of the people aged 15-44 who were classified as living a "disability-adjusted life" 20.6% had a form of mental illness. This compared to 13% who were living with HIV/AIDS.  Manic depression is a disease that can steal your life. I have found it exceedingly difficult to interact with other people, virtually impossible to work in the "real world", and it has placed tremendous strains on interpersonal relationships. While it is possible for me, as someone living with this illness, to understand how it affects my life, it doesn?t change the fact that I don't always have the control over my emotions that I would like. Fortunately for me I do not experience full-blown mania, but I do cycle very rapidly which can be very difficult to cope with: from one moment to the next my mood can go from feeling quite elated, almost euphoric, to a melancholic depression that leaves me feeling like I want to die. If a disease is to be classified as serious because of the potentiality of death, then you should know this one thing about manic depression: this is a potentially fatal illness that will get worse if left untreated. Twenty-Five percent of those afflicted with this disease will die by their own hand over the course of the illness. Suicides will often take place as a period of depression is ending, when things are looking less hopeless and there seems to be less cause for concern. This is where mental health workers come in, because we simply cannot make it on our own.  There are many hospitals that will treat you well if you become ill in Ottawa: the Heart Institute is renowned for its quality of care, and CHEO is similarly celebrated for its caring staff and dedication to their young patients. But there is only one hospital that is singularly dedicated to the treatment of mental illness: the Royal Ottawa Hospital. The Royal Ottawa Hospital is where you want to go if you need help with a mental illness. The ROH cannot be replaced by any of the other hospitals in the area as it is staffed by professionals who only deal with patients with mental illnesses, and the people who are a part of their lives. The ROH is also involved in undertaking cutting edge research into the causes of mental illness, and it was a doctor at the hospital who was a part of the team that discovered the so-called "suicide gene" which was widely reported and will hopefully lead to new, more effective treatments of depression. But more important than any of that, the staff at the Royal Ottawa are in the business of helping people put broken lives back together, healing wounds that cannot easily be seen on the outside and preventing new wounds from being opened. In a very real way, these people save lives, just as much as a heart surgeon who performs a life-saving procedure: I have no doubt that without the caring, decent people, with whom my care has been entrusted to at this irreplaceable institution, I would not be in a position to write this?or anything else for that matter.    But that is not the whole story.   Several weeks ago it was announced that it might be necessary to lay-off up to seventy members of the Royal Ottawa staff and cut some of the services provided. This was in response to an operational deficit faced by the hospital and the new law by the government of Ontario making it illegal for hospitals to operate in such a position. The truth behind the shortfall, however, has much more to do with government badgering than fiscal irresponsibility. The government of Ontario ordered the ROH to restructure: the absorption of the Brockville Psychiatric Unit and the transference of the emergency services unit from the ROH to the Ottawa Hospital are just part of that restructuring. With the restructuring came a commitment from the Ministry of Health to cover the costs of the process, otherwise the ROH would not have chosen to undertake the horrendous expenses on their own, and why should they?  When faced with a similar scenario the Board of Directors of the Ottawa Hospital refused to cut any of their staff. Many positions were eliminated with attrition, but services were preserved. However, the Board of the Royal Ottawa seems incapable of guiding the hospital through this troubled time: instead of lay-offs the hospital would be better suited by their removal and the installation of a new board that is willing to fight for the quality of care that was provided in the past and improving upon it, not letting it degrade with unnecessary cuts. The one thing that politicians and administrators fail to understand when it comes to the provision of health care is that publicly funded care is not, nor should it be considered, a for-profit industry. The "health industry" is one which we must invest money into rather than cutting funds from if there is to be any hope of preserving the quality of care that we have today without risking severe degradations of service.   There seems to be a distorted sense of value when it comes to the treatment of mental illness. If this reduction of services is allowed to take place, for example, there is a very real possibility that some of the people needing the expertise offered by the staff of the ROH will not be able to receive that care. In the long run, this can result in more expense to the health system as some conditions becoming more serious to the point that more expensive, in-patient hospital stays will be required. The worse-case scenario, of course, is much worse: a person who is unable to receive the help they need may make a decision out of desperation, choosing to end their life, thus becoming another statistic. This is the real human tragedy that the provincial government is contributing to in their failure to provide the necessary funds in order to prevent the cuts in services.  It has been asserted by the administration of the Royal Ottawa that the cutting of seventy staff members will not have a negative affect on the services provided. This is ludicrous: the people who have been targeted for these cuts are already carrying inordinately heavy work loads. Nurses, occupational therapists, psychologists and social workers are carrying combined caseloads of both inpatients and outpatients that could often be covered by two full-time positions, but instead, one person bears all of the responsibilities, as well as running whatever groups they may be committed to. Even if one position is eliminated it will mean that a heavier workload will result for the remaining members of that particular health-care team, putting the health and life of patients at risk.  It is time for us to put our priorities in order, understanding that mental health care and the treatment of mental illness is an investment in people worth far more than any amount that is put into it. If we allow the government to force our hospitals to select a course contrary to that which they would have taken and then force them to pay for the misguided restructuring with the people who are there to provide care for the ill, then we are doomed to see our health care system collapse under the incompetence of the administrators currently running the province. The people who work at the Royal Ottawa Hospital need to be saved from this "hacking and slashing" mentality of fiscal responsibility. We need this hospital, with all of its staff, not some "Royal Ottawa Lite" that takes a step backwards in mental health care. That is a price none of us can afford to pay.

       An Essay on Ignorance   So many people wonder about the question of peace: can we have peace, or are we doomed to another, more destructive war than ever before?  I believe that there is a possibility for peace, but only if we are able to defeat a terribly insidious enemy: one that feeds upon our fears and seeks to drive opposing forces into a battle which will produce no real winner. That enemy is no person that can be named, it is not a political ideology, nor is it a religious system ? even one that that may produce fanatic adherents. This enemy appears in many guises, but ultimately it comes down to one basic principal: ignorance.  Ignorance is our enemy: it allows us to live our lives without knowing the history that brought us to this place in time. Ignorance allows us to live lives of isolation, where we do not know our neighbours because they may not be same as we are.  Ignorance allows us to watch injustice, in all its forms, and remain silent. How then, can we be even remotely surprised when people who have been marginalized and systematically oppressed by society all their lives, rise up against the hand of their oppressor? It happens as "race riots" in the United States, and we, as Canadians, look on in wonder, confused by the whole situation. But the root of the issue is ignorance. Failing to know the needs of your own citizens can only lead to conflict.   If we are truly honest with ourselves and ask what is the source of conflict facing the world today, we will see that it is not a "Jihad" ? a "Holy War" of Islam. True Islam, if you know, is like true Christianity: it is about peace. Unfortunately, ignorance has caused a bastardization of both belief systems. Ask yourself this question: do you really believe God (or Allah) wants people to be killed in His name?  Of course not. But we cannot be as hateful towards our perceived enemy if we realize that all they want is what any of us want: to have a home to go to, a bed to sleep in, someone to love them and a safe place to raise our families.  In the pursuit of "justice" for the victims of the September 11 bombings the President of the United States, George W. Bush, has authorized the bombing of targets in Afghanistan in the hopes that Osama bin Laden would be killed, or brought to justice. The Taliban may have been ousted, but at what cost to the people of this country, who now have landmines, unexploded bombs and other hazards to cope with ? all because the President deigned an entire country fair game for revenge.  The ignorance displayed by the United States is, without a doubt, the most dangerous and threatening to the preservation of humanity. When a single country becomes enabled to turn their foreign policy into the policy of the United Nations, it is truly time to be afraid for the future of our species.  We can have peace ? but not the American way. Their way is too costly, and an enforced peace can never be lasting. Only through compassion and understanding will we be able to overcome the differences that separate us, and find the common ground that brings us together.

       Happy CANADA Day **137 Years Old ... and still beautiful!***   For the past few days I have seriously been considering the flaws in our electoral system. I love Canada, truly - I am passionate about this country - the one time I went to Europe, to visit Austria while in university, I was very (very) happy to return home, if only to be in a country where you didn't run across armed soldiers patrolling events where politicians were attending (not armed with pistols, but armed with H&K MP5's - a gun that will make you wet you pants when you see it in the hands of a nineteen-year-old soldier).   Canada represents so many of the things that I believe in, yet has so much promise for more - there is that idea that we, in the great country, are far more than the substance of what we are made of - and that we deserve far more than we get whenever we go to the polls on election day.  The biggest problem with our electoral system is that it does not properly reflect the results of the votes as they are cast. The only proper way to do this is through proportional representation, where every vote cast in an election would count towards the final tally. Ironically, a fine example (though, perhaps not a great example of its execution) of proportional representation in action is found in the way members are voted into the Knesset in Israel.   Instead of having 120 ridings for the 120 members, the country is not divided - every party involved in the election presents their candidates as a list, with the most important at the top (such as the leader, and etc.) descending through to the bottom. In order to elect ONE member, the party must receive 1.5% of the popular vote - and that is ALL (there had been, for a time, a separate vote for the Prime Minister, but they have returned to the One Vote system).  Consider this: on June 28, the Liberal Party received 36.7% of the popular vote - and elected 135 seats. The Conservatives received 29.6%, and 99 seats; the Bloc received 12.4%, and 54 seats; the NDP received 15.7%, and 19 seats, and "Other" received 5.6%, and only 1 seat.   Our Parliament currently has 308 seats, which makes things difficult to calculate from scratch, but based on the population of the country, and the size of the governing body, it would seem reasonable that the minimum vote needed to elect one sitting member should be 0.3% of the popular vote. With that number in mind, the present parliament would change as follows (it would be based on 333 seats): > The Liberals would receive 122 seats (real: 135) > The Conservatives would receive 99 seats (real: 99 - amazing) > The New Democratic Party would receive 52 seats (real: 19) > The Bloc Quebecois would receive 41 seats (real: 54) > ... and "other"? there would be 19 "other" seats (real: ... 1)  So, where is the democracy? Does my vote count, when I go into the polling station and have to say to myself, "I want to vote for the NDP, but I can't because I'm afraid if I do, the Conservative might win - so I vote for the Liberal ..." - but, with proportional representation, if I voted for the NDP (or whomever), EVERY single vote would be counted towards the FINAL NUMBER of seats that are sent to the Parliament - THAT is democracy IN action, rather than democracy inaction.  We have taken our system and allowed it to wallow in the bureaucracies that make it so sluggish it can hardly move to save its life - and yet, things seem to happen - when enough people raise their voices at the right time. Perhaps if we start now, by the time there is another general election we will be able to see what would really happen if every vote was counted for its full weight.   Until then, Canada will remain a great country, with an imperfect democracy. But, as it is Canada Day, and the country is only 137 years old - that is hardly ancient, like some of the European nations, but - we're still learning.

        On the Philosophy of Music:     Searching for Meaning in Music   Music is empowered to express the ineffable, that which the composer could not simply write as a poem or otherwise say in a few short words, should they so desire. If we allow ourselves to examine a musical composition with the same sense of weight that we scrutinize other forms of art it is possible to see the substance behind the “notes on a page” which are given a life of their own when entrusted to the hands of interpreters: performers who desire to seek out the true intentions of the composer and attempt to represent those intentions through their performances.   As a composer of contemporary classical music, one way that I conceptualize a composition is as a sculpture of sound. As music is performed the sound takes up a physical space: it is real, tangible, and has a substance for the duration of the performance. It could be argued that as the sound waves travel through space the “sound sculpture” exists in a real sense until the ultimate dissipation of the harmonic vibrations which can take eons (if extended to the extreme). Taking the extra step and imagining that the music actually is a representation of a physical presence brings the listener closer to the reality of the process behind the creation of music.  When a composer faces a blank page with only the feeling that they need to compose, and perhaps the vaguest idea of what instruments they want to write for, they look into their heart to find something that needs to be expressed. The conglomeration of notes upon which a composition is made may well be a representation of the deepest aspect of the composer’s psyche—or it may be something far less serious: a lighthearted work, conceived for the pure joy of expression. Whatever the case, the music and its creator are inexorably connected. It is also something that can elicit pain at the thought of sharing out of the trepidation and anxiety that it causes—yet through that sharing the composer is uniquely positioned to give, both to the performers and to the audience, with the hope that each would be enriched through the experience.   The power of music is further extended through its eternal capacity to transcend every aspect of the human condition, rising above the mundane, enabling us to see light in the darkest of times. On the surface it is relatively easy to seek some enjoyment from the performance of a piece of music, finding whatever treasures there are at any given time in the composition. There is often, however, so much more behind the music than the obvious: something that the composer may have given a significant amount of thought to represent within the framework of the composition. Contemporary classical music is often much more than the clever arrangement of tones and rhythmic motifs: it is possible through this medium to have works imbued with a philosophy or an ideology. This is not to imply that all music must express a specific idea, but the idea that music is capable as a vehicle for the expression of a particular idea or ideal is certainly nothing new.   Throughout history there are examples of composers using their music to make comments, both overt and hidden. Programme music, being the most obvious example, allows the composer to attach a specific message or story to their composition — either coming before, as an aid to the composer in the conception of the piece or added after the work is complete, as something that was made to fit the finished composition. Anytime a composer attaches a title to a work that departs from “Sonata”, “Symphony” or some other non-traditional “classical” appellation and decides to use a descriptive term a door is opened to outside interpretation as to their intentions. We have a natural desire to want to know what something means: it offends our sense of propriety to think that a title has no significance, or if it does, that it’s meaning is hidden from us.   As we search for meaning in contemporary classical music we can be aided by one general premise: composers have an unequivocal need to be understood. Obviously there are some composers for which the concept of understanding is not important, but the composers using music as a means of emotional expression or as an attempt at the communication of a particular idea or ideal are, by reason of what they are trying to do, seeking understanding from listeners. We must do more than just listen to the music to fully appreciate what is expressed in the art: today many of the composers are available as living guides to their art, and they are a resource available to any who are willing to take that extra step.    On a Jewish voice in contemporary music:    I have been asked many times about the connection between what I compose and the fact that my ancestors are Jewish. Is there a connection? Am I a Jewish composer, or am I a composer who happens to be Jewish? While it would be easiest to dismiss the question by pointing those interested to certain works of mine which are, certainly, imbued with an overt “Jewishness”, whether it be on a musical level or merely at the level of an “intellectual nod” towards the culture, it is not a question that can be easily answered either way. But even then, after looking at the music, there are some things that may not be satisfactorily answered.   The works that I have written, and am writing, which fall into a category that I call memorial pieces represent my effort to keep the memory of those who perished in the Holocaust alive through music. I can say that there isn’t any one particular compositional technique, or musical element represented, to symbolize what transpired during that horrendous time in history that saw so much suffering, but it is my enduring hope that the compositions have something that is able to communicate what I felt while composing them.   Each of the memorial pieces was inspired by a very specific event or thing that came across my path (or the other way around, depending on the circumstances): It isn’t every day that something can move you enough to feel compelled to compose a new work as a result of it. Thus, when I was so impressed by the various things that led to these memorial pieces, the inspiration stayed with me throughout the creative process, confirming, in my mind, that this was what I needed to be doing at that time.  Perhaps, once we look at the variety of people who are creating music in this day and age, we will recognize that it is impossible to say that in this new millennium there is a single distinctive Jewish voice represented in contemporary music. At the same time, however, it is similarly impossible to dismiss or forget our past: Nor should we. The history of the world is replete with the tragedies caused by those who had forgotten, or ignored, the lessons of the past. It isn’t my role as a composer to preach lessons of history, but at the same time, I feel a responsibility to not allow the past to be forgotten.  This is part of being a member of the human race: being connected to people around the world and the cultures that influence the world. As far as “being Jewish”, and being a composer, this also means that there are times when my music does have something to do with my cultural background as well as with the history of the people. However, there are more times when the music is just that: Music. The essence of being becomes a part of the message.   For as long as the music is performed, the composer lives.

      Well, after such a long silence one would think that I'd completely forgotten about the fact that I even  had  a blog, let alone had any intention of contributing to it again. The truth of the matter is that I hadn't forgotten, but things sort of ran away on me, and every day that I thought "today I will write a blog", something else would happen, and the next thing I knew another day - then week - then month would go by ... until it got to the point where I had all but let it fall by the wayside.  There is something about this forum that really appeals to me, however, and I really don't want to lose the opportunity to access the potential readers here who may, or may not, agree with my point of view on various points of discussion. Thus, I am going to try to make a concerted effort to contribute on a regular basis to this "column", in the hopes that people will find a reason to check back with some regularity - seeking what has been posted.  Tonight - or, should I say, this morning, the thing that I am most concerned with is the federal election that just occurred, here in Canada. The people of this country have seen fit to give the Liberal Party of Canada a minority mandate with which to form a government. For several reasons, this is something that both grieves me, but also comforts me - to the point that I cannot decide whether I should be celebrating or drinking myself into a stupor.  A reason to celebrate (and, for that matter, drink myself into a stupor), is that the "new" Conservative Party, under the "leadership" of Steven Harper, has been denied a mandate. I have been in several discussions regarding this "new" party, and I always say that I wouldn't be so worried about them if they were really "conservatives", but the party is the amalgamation of the Alliance Party and the Reform Party - which is full of xenophobic racists who oppose the Canadian Human Rights Act - and would have had Canada send troops to the Persian Gulf in support of a war against Iraq's people, in search of Weapons of Mass Destruction that the Bush administration stated, in 2001 (at the time of the inauguration) that "they did not have". The "new" conservative party represents the worst of the three organizations that came together, with candidates that needed to be muzzled during the election, for fear that they might say something controversial (which happened enough to reveal their true colours to those who paid attention).  The fact that a minority government was elected gives me pause for the reason that, on the surface, there doesn't seem to be a reasonable combination of support for the Liberals to work with, given the distribution of representation. Minority governments can either be very effective, providing excellent representation for their constituents, or they can be "lame duck" governments, floundering around until the inevitable non-confidence vote which results in another general election - and another major bill for the Canadian taxpayer.  Should the NDP and the Bloc decide that it is in their best interest to work with the government, they will be able to promote some of their pet projects, including health care and the environment (NDP), transfer payments and education (NDP & Bloc) - but - will they see this as an opportunity for that sort of advancement, or will they choose instead to "play politics" and grandstand, taking every opportunity to "look good on camera" during question period. Should this be the route they take, I fear that the government will find itself shackled - totally impotent and unable to move on any legislative materials - even those acts that the NDP would have wanted to enact on their own.  Minority governments are only able to work when those involved are willing to set aside their egos, and act in the best interests of the people who elected them.
