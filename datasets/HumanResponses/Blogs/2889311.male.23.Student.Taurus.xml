       Yesterday, I bid goodbye to apt#6 in Laurengayle Villa and moved to apt#17, the place where I lived during the first year of my graduate studies.  I moved out from my earlier dwelling to live with Dilip when he came to UAB last fall. A year ago, I decided after a lot of deliberation that I should move in with Dilip. I was not too eager to move out for we 4 (prem, rajesh, rc and me) gelled pretty well. It was an eventful one years' stay in apt#6, it was eventful because I had done well in acads, I choose graphics as my field of interest, I learnt a lot from the gut-wrenching experiences I had during this tormenting period of graduate studies. I can confidently claim that I have become a better person in the churn of the last years' events.  Rajesh is moving to Virgina Tech for his phd and this coincided with my lease expiry in apt#6 and also two people sharing an apartment din't do any good to my wallet. So me and dilip decided to move back to my original place.  Yesterday, I spent the whole evening moving stuff and when I was shoveling stuff, I unearthed a lot of books, which I had collected during my college days and my early UAB days and also I came across a few of my reflections, which gave me a lot to ponder about. I got a feeling that I'am still lagging back now in terms of where I expected myself to be by then. I realised that I have broken a lot of promises that I swore that I will hold fast to by then. I came across exam answer books which reminded some pleasant and not so pleasant moments. I ran my eyes across few pages of my undergrad slam book, a few jottings were off base and they just hung there coz it was a slam book, while some others had given a lowdown on my undergrad life. I also gleaned a few articles that I had printed off from the web to read in the next few days.  Meanwhile a lot has changed in apt#17, the crowd that used to hang out there has slowly dispersed, bob moved out of Laurengayle, so did ratna. Prem had two new roommies in this period, After the influx of new faces last fall, the outlook of apt#17 changed from being dour to being bubbly and it invited some people's irate (got to do with the petty nature of the crowd I guess, but I got a more convincing rationale, which is reserved for some other post ). I had kept myself out of this all last year only to marginally brush with the inevitable sometime during the last fortnight. In retrospect of what happened I feel good that nothing took off. Coming back to the main point and to summarize, this place and the people have changed quite a bit.  I felt strange yesterday and today morning, while the place was so familiar I felt strangely disconnected. I'am sure dust will settle on these unsettling thoughts and I will back into my own soon. One thing I don't want to do is get back into the loop that I was in when I was here last year. Accounts of those morbid and unsettling days will be detailed in another post.  I will post the links for some of the pics that I took while we were moving sometime t'row.  Murali.

       One of my frnz called me and said he got a bday remainder mail saying that 26th was Dilip's bday (BTW Dilip is my rommie and he was my frnd in undergrad too). Dilip had told us that his bday was on aug 2nd. I put my detective cap on and casually asked him whether I can see his drivers license and unsuspecting he flipped his wallet and showed me his license and it said his DOB was 7-26-81. The smart actor I'am, I din't show any reaction and said I was just wondering if there was a difference in the manner in which my license and his was laid out. Then I rushed to Prem's home (one of my earlier roomies) to let him know that we ought to do something about this. Then Prem in his usual style got things quickly done and everything was in place, the cakes were ready, the candles were glowing and folks had gathered to wish him.    Everything was kept as a suspense to Dilip. To culminate all the suspense Prem played a neat little trick, he ran down and informed me and thick babu (one of my frnz who returned from India after a vaction jus today) that everything was ready and he knocked the restroom's door and told Dilip that Rajesh (prem's roomie) had broken his leg and we need to rush him to a hospital. Me and thick scampered to Prem's home. Dilip followed us quickly and when he opened the door, the lights were turned on and his petrified face was greeted with loud cries of "happy bday to you".    After the usual ceremony of blowing the candles, singing the bday song, and distributing the goodies, the action started and people enthusiastically grabbed dilip and flung him in air thrice. Somebody was intent on birthday bums but I put my foot down and said no, I hate that painful ordeal. The champagne was uncorked and hell broke out. Everybody in the vicinity was dragged and pushed into the swimming pool, I made a rather graceful dive (did I say I plunged into 4 feet he he!!) and stayed in the water watching the fun as other people got their deal. Thick sounding rather stupid asked one guy be thrown into 6 1/2 feet deep water and the poor guy din't know how to swim and after a few anxious moments he was dragged to safety.    Then we all got down to beer and movie. We were watching Panchatantiram, a Kamal starrer and a stand out comedy. After a few gulps and bursting laughter people faded away and I don't know when I went unconcious and I woke up in the midst of emptied beer bottles and left over snacks, a yucky feeling but the good time we had yesterday made me get over it as I cleared up the mess and got back to business.

       When I woke up, the first thing on my mind was to rush up to winamp internet tv to get hooked to the India Pakistan ODI,. To my disapointment the server was busy and I had to run to one of my frnz place to see the webcast. I just took a peek at the scorecard to see the status of the match on my way to my frnz place.    Pakistan, earlier in the afternoon mauled the Indian attack especially they were severe on beleaguered Balaji, who was woefully out of form in the earlier matches, Nehra too came in for some punishment. It was heartening to see Irfan continue the rich vein of form he showed in the earlier series. Considering the fact that he is till 19 his rapid raise to claim the position of the strike bowler of the team is astonishing. He had taken 3 wickets despite giving 50 odd runs. Sachin, the master bamboozled some stupid ass Pakistan batsman with his leg spinners to claim 3 wickets. But the score line made a sore reading for Indian fans (300-9 in 50 overs).     Chasing 301 against a lightning quick Pakistan pace attack was never going to be easy and very few teams have done that in the past. So the task was ominous and it needed some imagination from the batters to weather the initial storm when Akthar and Sami would be fuming. Shewag is one person who has defied every piece of cricketing logic and today was no different as he threw his wicket away in the same reckless fashion he flungs his bat. Someday he got to realize that he needs to mix caution with agression so that he can justify the loads of talent he got.      Sachin was going steady and Ganguly as usual was looking clumsy against sheer pace. In his usual inimical stance of getting his front foot stuck in the front of the wicket and his back foot straying across the stumps he survived few close LBW shouts but inbetween these inept moments he glaced few gorgeous strokes. Sachin was not in any murderous mood today but played the freaking fast deliveries with certain assurance.    There must have been gazillion instances in the past when Ganguly walked across his stumps and missed the line of the ball and got his bails dislodged and every time that happened millions of us have wished that the Captain learns not to make that stupid mistake again. But today was just another instance showing that Ganguly is indifferent to learning from past mistakes, he let a straight n quick delivery from Sami to crash into his middle after the ball brushed the pads on its way. I heaved a sigh thinking about how many times this has happened in the past. Before I could pull myself out of this disappointment Dravid came in and went out . Yuvraj flattered to deceive and Kaif ran himself out. Pathan showed why he is such a promising prospect for India, he followed Tendulkar's words religiously but then came the heart break. Tendulkar who was grafting till then decided to break the shackles only to slice the ball to the fielder inside the 15 yard circle. It was a sore moment and I just cannot take that Shoib Malik was being so lucky, he rode his luck to a scratchy 143 and then he bowled ok, but the writing was on the wall that today was his day and not even the genius of Tendulkar could spoil his party.    Tailenders embarrassed as usual in their attempt to deny Pakistan the bonus point. In the end, to much of the dressing room's relief they scampared to 241 but in the end it was Pakistan's pace that put paid to India's hopes of winning this match and extending the mental stronghold they have been holding over the past few months. So with this result its a do-or-die situation for India in the next match against Sri Lanka.    All in all this was yet another cricket match whose result again gave the much familiar gloom on a sombre sunday. Need to shake the rust off and get on with my thesis work in the forthcoming days.    Nothing more to add now,  Signing off,  Murali.

       Last night, me and some of my frnz were discussing about job search and related fundas. I find myself in a dicey situation in the current scenario. Currently the job market seems to be doing good and most of my frnz who have gotten jobs in the past few months have done so in application development. I'am into graphics and modeling and since I haven't started my job search business seriously this kinda discussion petrifies me, it makes me think about the uncertain days ahead, the skills that I need to pick up to reinforce my repertoire, and how to squeeze time to learn new stuff when I will be busy with my thesis in the coming days.    Next few months could turn about to be the most signifcant time, it appears that the going will be tough but who will not want to go thru the grind if at the end of it u can end up with a job which u desire. I'am keeping my fingers crossed and hoping for the best lets c how it turns out.    Murali.

       Ok, now on to the dream interpretation    refer to the earlier post to make sense of this one.    Why did my advisor appear in the dream ?    Coz 30 mins before I crashed into the pillow I was thinking that it has been a while since I met my advisor, a trepid thought creeped in and said if I don't stay in touch often enough with him that might significantly affect his reco letter. Its this guilt feeling that manifested in the form of a streak of light underneath his closed door.      Who were the people who scared me in the lab ?    The guy who offered me a ride who appeared familiar to me was one of my frnz, a couple of days ago aided by a bit (??) of intoxication we were talking like crazy and both of us were sharing a joke with an african american lady. At that time I was thinking that I shouldn't be doing this and probably I had carried on this feeling for a couple of days.      Who and why were the guys skating in the hallway ?    Whenever I go to the CS dept labs I find a group of people haranguing when instead they should be busy with their assignments and stuff like that. At their sight I always felt that they were having a smooth time in the grad school while I was slogging (self-pity maybe!).      Why that fast food joint in the hallway ?    The sight of the fast food joint seemed so similar to the one me and my frnz used to hang out oftentimes in my undergrad days. since I hit the bed hungry, the place where I used to devour delicious food made an appearance in the dream.      Why PR and that gorgeous woman ?    My frnd PR had called me and I did not return the call yet. But why that girl and why him fliriting I don't know. She was Konkani, but why Konkani ? I guess that evening I was reading a debate about influences of Sanskrit on Dravidan languages but I remember the article was talking about Kanada, Tamil and Telugu not about Konkani.      Why am I making a furor over a mere dream ?    Coz this is one of the dreams for which I can concretely attribute events that occured in the past few days and its really surprising that many a days when I have tried to make sense of a dream I was almost always unable to explain certain mental images.

       Ok, Just today, afer reading a few impressive blogs I decided that I would use my blogs as a perfect haven to express myself unpretentiously and I could not have had any better start. Here is an account of one the dreams I had tonight and an analysis of this dream concurs so well with my notions about dream interpretation.    First lemme narrate the dream and then detail its interpretation    Tonite at about 2:30 I was working on my thesis code and I was very hungry. In two days I had eaten nothing substantial. I don't know why, but just din't feel like eating. I was waiting on my monstrous lung model to render. I thought it might take 15 mins before I see anything at all on the screen so set my alarm to cry in another half-an-hour    ............................  ...........................    I find myself in the Computer Science dept walking to the grad lab, when I was about to enter the lab, I look over my shoulder and see a streak of light on the floor in front of my advisor's closed room. Its late in the night and he is still working hmm!! thats strange I say to myself. I find three other people in the lab, the guy next to me sounds familiar and next to him a fat lady is working on the computer. The guy next to me fixes to leave and I look at him and to my horror his lips are dark and appear burnt. To add to my shock he tells me he will give me a ride back home. I try to reach for my shoes under the table (no idea why I removed them) I find a totally misfit footwear of mine underneath the table then I turn back and I see that the fat lady in the room has a scarred face (part of forehead, eyes, nose and lips appear burnt). I frantically slide my feet inside those awkward shoes and then I' am on the run I seem to have a pillow and a sleeping bag in my hands.     I run frantically in the hallway of the CIS dept and when I reach the end of the hallway and take a turn I find a few CIS students (one particular gang I usually find in the dept labs) skating on the shining floor (all the lights are glowing in this side of the hallway) and at the far end of the hallway I see people sitting and eating it looks like a chat joint (I see some coke crates, plates in different color and a colorful water pot) and my fear recedes on that sight and then to one guy who is standing around I ask the whereabouts of my frnd PR. He tells me that PR is trying to flirt with a konkani girl (Goa's language is konkani) in the stall. I see in the direction in which that guy points and see a good looking Indian female clad in red sari, shes tall, shes got a lean and tall bindi that stands out. She looks like shes very tired and I search for PR he is not to be seen around........    ......................  ......................    I suddenly realize that this is a dream and I'am feeling really hungry so I fix something to eat. While munching I retrospect the dream I had and I head towards my computer to blurt out my first post in rave and thus this blog was christened RAVE. I will follow up this post with my interpretations of this strange dream.    Murali.

       The air was fresh and golden streaks of sun started to light up the dawn sky. He was up early as usual and briskly started the proceedings for the day. When the clock struck 7:00 he was in his car waving good bye to his beloved and thinking about the tasks on hand for the day. His mind was racing from one thought to another thinking about the appointments for the day, the negotiations which beckoned him, the proposals nearing completion, the backlogs, the blockheads in the topnotch who grappled to comprehend his brilliant ideas, the bills to be paid, ......  This was his usual train of thoughts every morning when heading to his office, Sometimes he was intimidated by the daunting tasks that lay ahead of him, he knew his success heavily rested on the topnotch who had the final say in putting into action his splendid ideas and this made him feel highly insecure, because he knew that most of his superiors despised him, they were taken aback by his feverish pace and his fervor towards his work. In the past they had snubbed his exciting ideas as dubious because they felt his success would wreck their stakes. He had always regarded his work place as a shrine and his work as bliss through which he escaped the ills of the world around him.  A magnificent carving stood overlooking the entrance of his office building, it was a sculpture of the city builder. He had read about him and he admired his spirit for he had always loved the way in which the sprawling city was laid out. The streaks of sunlight behind the head of the statue was a marvelous sight and it always brought tranquility to him, that sight will cast aside all his jitters and will set his mind in tone to face the gruelling day. That statue was his symbol of worship. When he turned to catch a glimpse of that captivating structure today, a thunderbolt struck him, for he stared directly at the sun, he felt a sudden panic running through his body and he immediately recollected that he read in last week's newspaper that the statue was about to be removed to overhaul its rusty podium. He felt awkward and a light dizziness set in, circumspect about what the day holds in store for him, he escalated in the elevator and proceeded to enter his office.  The day, which began with a jolt started to slide from bad to worse. By afternoon it was pretty obvious to him that his future looked bleak in a place where he had worked his heart out enduring every moment's pain with a hope of devouring a sweet success, which he thought nobody could deny him. He had underestimated the influence of the lobby, which was constantly increasing in number as more and more people felt threatened by his aura. Some of his friends had warned him about this, but he had brushed aside their fears and told them that nothing terrible can happen as an offshoot of his industrious attitude. But today he was shattered by the horrible turn of things, his sympathizers spoke with their eyes and seemed to convey that they were concerned at his plight. The visage of his detractors were mocking and they had eagerly awaited this day for a long time now. He could not take the disgrace dished at him as a reward for his monumental efforts and after a few minutes of thought by the day fall he decided that this place does not deserve his caliber. He met the concerned people and completed the formalities and he was ready to go once and for all.  On his way back home, he was caught in rush hour traffic. He tried not to think of what happened during the day, but he was unable to control his thoughts. His mind kept racing back to the missing statue and how it served as an omen for the beleaguered day.  He felt that there was no justice in this world, for all that he had done was pulverized by some incompetent people who were scared to face the world face up. He rued the fact that all his excruciating endeavors bore no fruit and the future looked bleak. He did not know what to do to redeem himself for the mistake which was not his. He was fighting tears, the traffic and the endless wait made him even more miserable. He did not know how to present what had happened today to his beloved. He was distraught with grief when he thought about how she might react to the situation.   He reached home and was determined not to reveal that he was shattered. She had returned tired from the day's work, after fixing dinner she was eagerly awaiting him. He entered his dwelling and tried to look at ease. She saw his grim face and immediately realized that something terrible has happened. He tried not to look into her eyes but her presence was pervasive and he couldn't escape the concern on her face. She walked up to him and hugged him, she felt cushy in her night robe and a sudden stab of emotion hit him on hugging her and he moved back and rushed into his room. He sat on the bed with his face turned away from the door, trying not to reveal his tears to her. She followed him into the room, with her heart beating fast, she turned his face towards her and to her shock, she saw tears rolling across his face. She softly ran her fingers across his hair and urged him to speak out. He buried his face into her chest and started to sob inconsolably. She held him tight and tears started to roll down her face, she dint know why he was thrown in harm's way, but she just couldn't stand him breaking down and sobbing like a child. Taking refuge in the warmth of her breasts and inhaling her sweet fragrance, he wailfully recounted how everything he stood for was demolished on this fateful day. She dint speak, she let him pour out all that has been bothering him.  After he spoke his heart out, she gently kissed on his forehead. He felt tranquilized, revitalized, and recharged. He gathered himself up, kissed her as a token of appreciation and felt he was ready to face anything that this cruel world can hurl at him, for he knew that he could always fall back on her.
