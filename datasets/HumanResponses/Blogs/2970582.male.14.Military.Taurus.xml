       As many of you may know, today is March 25, 2004. But wut duz that rilly mean? Well, in Spanish, it means "el vienticinco de marzo". So, there you have it: the meaning of March!  (now i know y'all are thinking "man, i have GOT to buy this guy's book. I mean, he seems to really know what he is talkin' about! In terms of his area of expertise (thinking and elaborating on the pointlessest topics known to modern man) he's the master!)

       So photography! I know both my readers will be upset that i kept them waiting so long... So here it is:  The way i see it - and i apologize to all u aspiring photographers out there - all u have to do is press a button, and the picture is taken. Duzn't seem to hard. Now i know that there r many things to do and know for a great picture, and i have to admit, that of course the camera is a very amazing and complicated invention. But all things considered, the results aren't much better than a random old disposable camera. Those were my two cents.                                                   P.S. For more pointless dribble, see my book: Exploring the Faults of Everything

       Ha ha ha! Ho ho ho!  And a couple of La de das! That's how we laugh the day away, In the merry old land of Oz!  We get up at noon and start our work at one With an hour of work and then our day is done, Jolly good fun!!!  Ha ha ha. Yeah rite. More like: I got up at 6:23 and started my work at 7:55, with 8 hours of work and then my work at school is done... Not to mention Homework!!!   Well, i got a free half hour, yay!!! Gosh, m i and idiot. Sumtimes. it's like i mumble stuff as if half compensating for saying it. but there's no point ! ok, i can tell, nobody understands wut i'm talking about so i'll stop. I'll end by saying, that missed oppurtunities must be dealt with in a timely manner. Acknowledging them is the first step, but doing the rite thing to make up for them is the key follow-up. If only i could follow that...

       YES! Finally online again! Stupid electrician: "OOOooohhh! I wunder wut wood happen if i cut this wire? Woops! There goes the phone line! Aaannddd as an added bonus, there goes the internet! Man, i'm earning my money today!!!" I'm serious tho, i recorded him saying that. Annnyywwaayy, I woke up Tuesday (that long ago?) and i'm like "Wow. It's @$%*$in' freezing in here! That's cuz the furnace is broken. Go figure. You ever notice how the furnace always breaks in the winter when it's cold, and the air conditioner always breaks in the summer when it's warm. Is this sum kind of cruel joke? I am cold with the furnace  ON. with it off, i'm like a reptile. In math, i missed the sight of the month. Why o why did i have to tie my shoes then! Why!?! sumone, i won't say who, was leaning on their chair, when the bar (i am not making this up) colapsed! Needless to say, he/she stumbled sideways. Then, while picking the bar up, he/she picked the bar and hit his head on the chalkboard thing. Hilarious! At least that's wut i hear. After, i sed "Man, Nathan, that wuz funny!" oops well, that's my bit for today. At the moment i'm not terribly confused , but i wuz earlier, but i'm not now. Woohoo

       Man. I'm confused. Many things really, but then again, they all trickle down to one thing. *pause* Great. I'm already confusing myself. I don't understand how i can feel so ambitious at one moment, and then feel, like, wut wuz i thinking later, namely, when it really counts or when i have the chance to carry it out. I hated 1984, but there was one good pasage in it. It was sumthing like feelings are useless, because when it really comes down to it, they just distract you from doing what you need to do. Good feelings you need obviously, but the negative ones like fear, cowardice, nervousness, tension, all they do is distract. Well, that's my little thought of the day.

       wow, playing soccer in 40 degree rain and the mud with a t-shirt and shorts in fun! At least it wasn't snowing... Today's original THOUGHT TO PONDER for the day which did i mention is ORIGINAL, is this: how come you are most comfortable the moment you realize you have to move/get up? [now's the part where you nod your head and murmur to your neighbors, "yah, why is that?"] cuz its true! Well, i'll leave u to ponder that for a few days... ta!  P.S. that was an ORIGINAL thought! so u know...

Do u feel yur life has meaning or purpose? Cuz that's very intersting to me (i saw antz). Well, that's my QUESTION TO PONDER for today. for more QUESTONS TO PONDER, visit the site listed below:

       dyu ever notice the weird stuff ppl put in blogs? sumtimes its just commentary, sumtimes its odd thoughts, and sumtimes its garbage like this, but all diss themselves in sum way like i just did, so they don't seem like everyone who has access to the world wide web (the world) is just dying to read sum kids thoughts.   if u didn't understand what i just said, then yur an idiot (i'm not saying yur stupid, but...  that's exactly what i'm saying) ESPECIALLY if u have a blog of yur own, becuz u know its true I"m not saying its bad - after all i just did it didn't i? - but it is interesting. just a polite social gesture.   Man do i want to be a soci/psych ologist when i grow up! I cant wait to tell ppl whats wrong with them and get paid for it! Its so easy (or so is my naive assumpsion (see there i did it again!))  Patient: Well doc, I -  Me: You're too fat, you're very obnoxious, you've obviously insecure, and please, put some deodorant on. Shall i go on?  Patient (sobbing): Wah! *sob* Here's yur money *sob sob sob* thank u *sobbbbb*

       wow, camping wasn't half bad! it wuz fully bad. I kid. But seriously, busch gardens is kul! The Big Bad Wolf, may be big and bad, but it is most definitely NOT a wolf. You were right, Tom, i'll give you yur five bucks. Also, it was not scary, atho i was scared stiff b4hand. I guess all my awesome Florida experinces at Rockin' Roller Coaster did nothing for me here but get me on the coaster.  Escape From Pompei? Piece of cake. In fact, there was a little car thing that went right through Pompei and out. Talk about convenient! Of course there was a slight wet drop at the end... And avoiding its splash while other ppl were on it was fun. Now it's off to comp sci hw. Dont' go, spring break

       P.S. I do not rock becuz i did not find the aficomen. The streak lives on!   I did, however, find it, after a hint from sumone else "it's in sumthing pink" (there was a pink couch in the room), but i covered it back up after realizing it was rigged so my 6-year-old sister could win. Then she won $11 and we all got jealous...

       :-( Oklahoma St. lost...   Wow, it's Passover time! Go low-carb diet ppl! (i hear they have low-carb life insurance now, but read Dave Barry in Sunday's (yesterday) Wash. Post. Mag for more on that); i know yur all happy! Ok, i know many of you have no idea wut i'm talking about.  Wow, wut a seder. Have you ever had those experiences where you just can't stop laughing, except it's at a place or time where you really shouldn't be laughing? Omg, that's exactly wut happened with me. Me and like 5 other kids in our havarah, (a group of Jewish families who celebrate together, kinda) just couldn't stop laughing during the seder! It was at the stupidest things. We just looked at each other and, BAM; it was uncontrolable but soooo funny!  Then the word "food" in our prayer book was spelled "tood". WoW. There were literally tears in my eyes. Then (actually before), while trying to steal my sisters glass because i ddin't have one, i realized the hard way that there was actually water in the glass. I spent the whole night trying to convince ppl that i did NOT wet myself.   Confidential to Bob: You go girl!

       Spring Break!!! Ahhhhh. I would be ecstacic/euphoric but i have homework. Because you see:                                               Zack + Spring Break - homework= :-):-):-)                                              Zack + Spring Break + homework=:-|                                              Zack + cake - oranges + football + Home Depot - the letter o = 3  Ok, that last one didn't make any sense, but you get the picture. Goooooo bus rides!!! We were so hyper on the bus! On Thu. we sung Yellow Submarine with my occasional shouts of "Boy howdy!" and "Yaaayyyaaahhh!" and "Darn tootin'" and we had the whole back bus do it! On Fri. we did various songs, from Yellow Submarine, to Row Row Row your Boat, to the Arthur song. Then, of course there was the  extremely original chant of:                                Spring Break!                               Spring Break!                               Spring Break!!! (repeat indefinitely)  We rocked!!! Special kudos to Alan, Adam, Sarah O. Seth, Dawn, Annie, and other ppl who were with us. Man we rocked.   P.S. I'm very sorry about the migraine that we surely caused the busdriver and possibly some uninformed 6th graders who might have wondered onto the wrong bus (ours).

Seriously ppl, the comments are there for commenting. I won't think u r an idiot for an idiotic comment. Or rather, i wont let u know that i think yur an idiot. And feel free to comment on my amazing posting skills (which by the way are amazing)  Overall, i m content, as most ppl should be. sure, not everything has worked out as planned, but not many problems are so urgent they cant be fixed at this point.

Meanwhile, i was like "lights oooooooonnnn now!" and sure enough the lights would go on every time. well, no.but it was still a fun b-day because not many ppl knew about it!

And, this seems to happen most around people you are pressured to talk to. Isn't the world interesting!??!  So wuzzup? uh-huh. uh huh. Interesting! That many? I never knew he loved acorns that much.

       i think the reason many ppl want a boy/girlfriend is that they want to feel validated, as in just to know that they aren't totally lame or unlikable, and its a psychomological thing too. Its certainly not bad, but its an insecurity that everyone in a way has in the back of their minds.  Who of my homies (ummm g's) did i see at the woodlin spring fair? huh? cum on ppl... i'm disappointed in all of u.  and now i know you've all been waiting for, it's: TODAYS LARFER OF THE DAY *drum roll*  Q: How many presidents who used to be photographers does it take to screw in a lightbulb?

       Wow, i feel like i'm repeating a collective broken record, but... it's (TPMS, duh!) over. And, that's sad. So many ppl that i've grown accustomed to seeing... gone, and that's a proverbial splash of cold water on my face. So, here's to all the gr8 times we all had together at Takoma:  6th grade (gosh, so long ago!)  9/11/01 - wut a great way to start middle school than with a terrorist attack one week into the school year. i remember sitting with all my barnsley homies... All i can say is, we all got thru that together.  Outdoor ed - That was FUN; highlight of year... i... think... hard to remember. but still, i met ppl, and we played predator pray!... i did not survive, sad to say. orienteering was fun also tho.  7th grade - boring year, let's skip... jk  2nd quarter, sniper attacks - for sum reason, i wasn't the least bit scared - until after he was caught that is, at which point i realized wut a terribly traumatic event had just passed... weird... well, wut can i say, ignorance is bliss. The only good part about that was that we skipped floor hockey for sum reason and played indoor soccer.  8th grade (best for last!!!)  Williamsburg - that was fun, altho i forget why... oh yah! the p(c)rank calls! heh heh  me: hi, is Ashley there? them: uuuhh, i think u have the wrong number me: ok, bye *** one hour later*** me: hi, this is Ashley, do i have any messages?  Florida - best week of my life... i think... gosh i'm not sure about anything anymore... but i went on those fast things!!! rollcoasts!!! and lets not forget hours and hours of red hot chili peppers songs blasting into my brain. now every time i hear them...  Cruise - sumwut disappointing cuz the dance floor wouldn't fit the average american, so one couldn't really ask another to dance, but the jump kind of dancing sufficed, i gess.  BBYYYEEE!!! KNOW I'LL C Y'ALL ROUND SUMTIME!!!

       Wow! Just cruise left and, *sniff* end of middle school! wow, i'm gonna miss everyone SOOO much! Unless of course they're going to blair, in which case , u don't get nothin'! jk, yur all kul. Saturday was GR8! First, both baseball games got rained out, leaving me free to play soccer! We lost, and i missed a pk, but that's all rite cuz i drew the foul anyway, and i almost scored other times and our goalie missed a save so we lost by 2 anyway! Then, a pizza party, where i drank so much soda, my bladder actually did, explode. Well, theoretically. Then we went to Nate's with Jake, Alex, and  Jesse, and we dammed up the damn creek. Damn creek we dammed it good! Ha! that was fun, and we got muddy. Then we got Owen, and made for a yard sale (this is the best part). Now for this yard sale, there were signs literally ALL OVER THE NEIGHBORHOOD, like for a mile radius, just arrows. So we started walking, when we come across nate's brother and his girlfriend. He agrees to give us a ride. Keep in mind this is a regular car with room for 3 in the back. There r 6 of us. That was the tightest (literally) car ride i've ever taken! While we were going, we'd knock at the window and wave at passersby, and first they'd wave, and then they'd be like, wow! But the best part was,when we got there, there was all of about one box there, and about one person! We were saying, "Reverse! Reverse!" twas gr8. and twas my day.  P.S. I don't appreciate being dithced!

Memorial day?" and i'm like "nnoooo". cuz monday was the one year aniversary of my bar mitzvah. Scott reminded me, cuz it was his bar mitzvah too! how cool is that, even though he's like 4 months older than me. That day was also fun because we saw mean girls (hilarious!) and played mini golf and  ATE. wow, i ate so much food that i can only eat cuz i'm super small. plus, i ate this even though i saw supersize me (gr8 movie!) on Sat. uuuhhhhhh hi!

       wellity wellity wellity; basketball @ good 'ol tpms is comin to a close tomorrer, and then its FREE WEEK. in FREE WEEK, one basically gets to do whatever one wants, inside the law and the fact that i have little available money and no car, that is. but the fact is, there is SSSOOO much to do with a little creativity. one could:  a) try to set the record for longest maintaining of sanity while never uttering words with "e" in them  b) ditto with every letter but "e"  c) start a yelling contest; bonus points for police/psychiatric involvement  d) go swimming in your local puddle  e) sleep an entire day; then stay awake an entire day; see how disoriented you can become!  f) make a list of activities to do like this one, except write it in your own blood!... or in pen.  the best part about all these activities is that in addition to being able to laugh about it when you'e  older, you won't take a minute of summer for granted; now THAT'S fun.

       ok, question. have you ever had to say goodbye to somebody who you knew you would miss, and probably wouldn't see for a long time, if ever again, and then one day years later you see them unexpectedly all of a sudden? yah, well that happened to me. today. twas one of my barnsley homies who alas, obviously did not go to takoma. it's weird because you remember them as they were years ago, even though u remember yourself as you are now, so it feels like you grew and they didn't kinda. so, when u see them, they're always different in some ways than expected. but, still, it's a totally awesome thing.

Sry, but no prizes until the 1000th visitor. ttyl!

       Ok, i have a pet peeve. Now u know it really bothers me when i say "pet peeve" cuz that is a dumb phrase. Reason? i have no idea it just sounds dumb. But that u know wut is ppl saying how bored they during summer. HONESTLY! if the ony way u can amuse yourself is by going to school, than g-d help u. don't get me wrong, not being able to see your friends for 2 and a half months can be grueling, but a) u can CALL them! wut a crazy idea! b) there are endless possibilites of wut u can do if u don't have any responsibilities c) this is like the only time where u don't have to get a job, support a family, or be swamped with hw. take advantage, ppl!  and now, a final thought. isn't it annoying how the a.c. always breaks during the SUMMER and the  heat always breaks during the WINTER? wouldn't it be nice if it was the other way around? "aw man, the a.c. is broken!" "it's winter" "yay!" [witty farewell
