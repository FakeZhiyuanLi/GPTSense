      Well life started off interesting.  Eddy's forgot to put my cadence cable on.  They can't find it. HMMMMMM.  Had the bright idea to use the railroad access road to get into town.  It seemed like a good idea.  No traffice, level.  Bad Idea, let me repeat Real Bad Idea.  They pave those roads with the rocks that they use in the railbeds, (big).  Whent about two miles before I got to a public road and finished that way.  So I'm back to the jungle.  There just are not any good ways in and out of akron that do not use major roads.  Well I got 5.5 miles down and still had to walk part of the way.  The new seat and tires are working very well.  Considering the folowing changes in a bit, change my fork to a solid fork, I don't MTB, and clips.  I have to add lighting as well  Talk to you later,

      Well thanks to the crew from Eddies Bikes, I had my repairs done in record time.  In addition to the new tires and computer I also splurged on a new bike seat AHHHHHHHHHHH.  I rode it for about a mile before work.  It feels like a new bike now.  I am working the late shift here at good ole GY.  So I am going to ride home about 8 p.m.  I am considering getting a little creative with my route.  The roads around Headquarters are not the safest.  I was looking at some railroad tracks that run around here.  I found them on the map and lo and behold the are going my way.  There is a pretty big access road that runs parallel to the tracks as far as I can see, so I will give it a shot.  If it works out I may be able to get all the way home with out using the public streets.  My diet situation was not nearly as successfull.  Had tuna for breakfast, but got half way through a burger and fries before it dawned on me that this wasn't a good idea.  I left over half so I suppose that is an accomplishment.  Anyone want to sponsor the Body Shot.  Sounds like a great advertising campaign.  This space for rent and all rights reserved folks.

      Well ladies and gentleman it's been a long time, but I have finally decided to get back on the road.  I  was seriously injured in a automobile accident in 1985.  It took me two years to walk.  Thankfully I was in great shape, it literally saved my life.  I started biking in 1992.  It felt like freedom again.  Old song, driver makes right turn in front of me.  She didn't see me even though I was wearing a bright yellow jacket and helmet.  Did I mention she was eating an egg mcmuffin and smoking a cigarrette.          Well here it is 2004, I used to weigh 185 now I weigh 270.  I avoid stairs. Lets just say I am not satisfied with my current condition.  So I am biking again.  Right now my goals are to eat appropriately and commute to work on my bike.  It's about 6 miles each way.  I have a Jamis Eureka Mountain bike I am slowliy transforming into a commuter.  So you are invited along for this trip.    Let me know what you think. Suggestions ect.    Todays vital statistics;:          I weighed 268 lbs this morning.         I made it to work. (That was the good news).  I shredded the sidewall of  my tire when I hit a storm drain.  I had to walk the bike a few times.  It was incredibly difficult to maintain any kind of cadence.  Conveniently, my wife works at the same place.  I had her drive my truck.  I took the bike to the bike shop and had both tires replaced.  I went with some Avocet Carbon II.  I thought I needed a way less aggressive tread pattern.  They are also a bit narrower than stock.  That also meant replacing the tubes as well.  I added splurged on a Specialized Turbo Elite computer.  Hopefully the cadence feature will help me keep the beat.        The ride definetly cut my appetite way down.  I usually had four pop tarts (sic) and 9 cups of coffee.  I had no pop tarts and about 3/4 of a cup of coffee.  I had two cheeseburgers (sans bun) and cesaer salad for lunch. No soda, a lot of water.  So far so good.    Anybody have any suggestions as far as seats go, my ass is killing me?   That's all for now
