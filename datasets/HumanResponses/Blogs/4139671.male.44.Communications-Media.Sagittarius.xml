      It never ceases to amaze me the lengths people will go to blame someone about something. Everyone wants to find someone to blame for 9-11. I for one do not see how that is possible. Can anyone honestly say that they could have believed something like the events of that day would have taken place? An embassy bombing or even an attack on a U.S. Naval vessel is one thing, but a coordinated airline highjacking attack on some of the largest buildings in the world? Come on people, give me a break. I served in the navy as an Intelligence analyst for 7 years and I have seen a lot of information from a lot of sources. I have met and worked with some of the finest analysts that you could imagine; people dedicated to thier cause and work to the point of obsession. I can safely say that in the world of intel analysis it is not always possible to get a complete picture of events that are unfolding. A little info from here a little from there; some false info from over there and so on. Imagine being an analyst and knowing something was going to happen but not being able to put your finger on it. There are indications of something big somewhere but all the info just isnt there. No imagine going to the public with what little information you have and painting a picture to safe and secure America that you think someone is going to highjack at least 4 airliners at the same time and going to fly them into buildings across the country at the same time. Would you honestly believe that. Lets give these intel guys a break. Accept the fact that it happened and there was nothing we could do to prevent it and move in with this anti-terror war.   I heard someone say the other day that all this homeland security stuff was a crock of shit. They went on to say that nothing has happened since Sept 11th and that why should we have these restrictions. Well DUH...dummy.... nothing has happened because people are doing their job. Dont point fingers over this... dont try to find someone to blame...there isnt anyone. Lets spend all this energy in ensuring that those responsible are brought down. Thats the best memorial we could do.  Well enough of my rantings on this issue...........for now at least.

      I will be 45 in a few months.  Have been very lucky in all that I have been able to see and do. More on that later. I have a few things I want to do before I die (hopefully a long time away). Why am I posting this? Just curious if there is anyone else out there that wants to do some of the same things. So, here it goes:  1.) Sail around the world in a sailboat 2.) Drive from Point Barrow Alaska to the tip of Tierra Del Fuego Argentina 3.) Ride the Trans Siberian Railroad 4.) Drive around the perimeter of Australia 5.) Swim in the open ocean with a whale 6.) Have dinner with Madonna (yeah I know, but what can I say) 7.) Move back to London UK (I am trapped in Kentucky)  So, what do you think? I wonder if it is possible. Who knows...maybe.  Anyone else want to do something like this?

      Well this is it. I have finally entered the world of blogging. Once I learn this I am sure I'll have plenty to say about something; just enough knowledge to get in trouble and not enough to get out of it.
