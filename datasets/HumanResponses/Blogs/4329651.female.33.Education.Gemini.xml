      When did Naomi Wolf become some frumpy? Reading the Washington Post article about Jessica Cutler, the Senate worker who got fired for blogging her sexual life with high ranking officials....Naomi bursts out with this:  'Feminist author Naomi Wolf agrees, and says modern sexual conduct offers a window into what's been gained and lost in the nation's values revolution. The sexual revolution, now stripped of much of its feminist political ideology, has left legions of young women free but confused. "I think the tipping point came three or four years ago with the first generation to grow up with the Internet," Wolf says. "They were daughters of feminists. The feminist message of autonomy got filtered through a pornographized culture. The message they heard was just go for it sexually.  "What is gained is they totally reject the double standard and believe they are entitled to sexual exploration and sexual satisfaction," Wolf says. "The downside is we've raised a generation of young women -- and men -- who don't understand sexual ethics like: Don't sleep with a married man; don't sleep with a married woman; don't embarrass people with whom you had a consensual sexual relationship. They don't see sex as sacred or even very important anymore. That's been lost. Sex has been commodified and drained of its deeper meaning." '  I admit, I haven't read Wolf's last few books...but I sort of remember her being a little more ....I dunno....Not Conservative? Is this what having to look at Harold Bloom trying to be sexy causes?  "Sex has been commodified and drained of its deeper meaning"...well, what deeper meaning is that, Naomi? I mean...does it ALWAYS have a deeper meaning. Does it have to? Can't it just sometimes be...like eating a pastrami and rye that's particularly tasty? Must we moralize every roll in the hay?  Agreed, there are power questions/issues/messages in every sexual transaction. Sex, in fact, is a TEXT....a kind of writing of the body....and Jessica Cutler translated that text into a public forum, and for that she was sanctioned (but also rewarded with a book deal). Ahhh...the confusing and fascinating reactions of various factions to any act of female transgression....  But to me its somewhat bizarre that Naomi Wolf, a transgresser in her own way, has suddenly become so judging. I guess she is her own backlash.  Speaking of which, where the heck as Susan Faludi been lately?

      And thusly I enter the bloggerati...well, not really. I have a personal blog at livejournal, but this blog will be dedicated more to my professional musings and life.   Although, frankly, there is little demarcation between "personal" and "professional" in my life...its not quite so actively binary.  I don't think it is with academics or teachers the way it can be with other professions.  It gets into your blood, into the dirt between your toes...it oozes its way into everything.
