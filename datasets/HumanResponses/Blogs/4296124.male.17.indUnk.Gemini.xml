      Yawn... Monday. School was the same old boredom, except I was doing all my homework through out the day due to my sweet laziness. We had marching band today, and I realized I really do not want to be there marching. I'll push through it, even if its the most homosexual show I've ever heard of. Work was rockin. I trained two new employees, both are slow and where on my nerves for a long time. Once done with them I did some cashier work for about an hour and a half, meaning I am now able to work ANYTHING in the store.  Pretty sweet deal. :) I closed out with Jeremy. Store closed at 9:34 and I clocked out at 10:40. How ridiculous is that? I dont like it... except for the $$$ part. Mwahaha. Otherwhise thats it! I'm feeling motivated to start practicing my sax alot more, I'm loving the alto for solos, but I need to catch up on bari now. Time to start moving. Thats all I have, keep it real.

      Well nothing exciting happened today, but whats new with that?... I worked from 4-close to make myself some of that money$$. This weeks work schedule is going to be insane with school but I will push it out. Sun- 4-7:30 Mon- 5-close Wed- 5-close Thurs- 5-close Sat- 4-close  Wish me luck! I spent my night pondering Colleen like always. Recently I've been feeling really lonely, and not as special as I used to. I always feel like I'm not wanted around her even though I understand that she doesnt feel that way at all. I love Colleen for always wanting people around her and always being nice to them, but it's made me wonder... am I just another one of the people she tries to make happy??? I think I mean more to her than that, but probably still not to the same degree that she means to me. Theres been one evening where I saw Colleen flirting with two of my friends, and cuddling with both of them throughout the night. What a new sense of jealousy that was. But I found out she was cuddling with Brandon again on his birthday. I know that he isn't what she is looking for... so why does she do it? Do I mean the same to her that he does? I just feel lost, but again... whats new. Perhaps I insist to care for Colleen, to pedastalize her, and push far too much effort in to her when I doubt she has an equal amount of emotion for me. I think it's time for answers. I need her to translate the mixed signals being sent to me. Am I wasting my time, or is it worth it? Either way I doubt I can stop it, lol. She's too good of a girl for me. :-p I appreciate her being there though, she definantly is my best friend, no matter what happens. I love her for being so good to everyone she comes to meet, and I wish I could imitate that same sense of care for everybody. Thank you Colleen for being so good to me. I promise you can't even understand how great you are. :)  And, I can't leave one other person out that I've know for the same amount of Colleen, since back in 8th grade. Kim! Thank you for being a friend to me, and making me feel better when I start to lose my grip on things. I think we connect on so many levels, and I am glad I have such a good friend around me right now.   Feelin good, Sidney ;)

      So I've finally become bored enough to create my own blog so bored people can read about all the non-interesting things I engage in.Im just going to talk and ramble and post things that don't matter on here. So... school started, LAME. However, it is the final year of educational prison. I spent my night with Kimmy tonight because she rocks. We went and saw "I, Robot" which was excellent. Thank you Kimmy! Tommorow im doing what I always do.... WORK! 4-10 30, so somebody better come visit me. :-p I was hoping to get together with Colleen after work but I forgot that she has a wedding reception to attend. :( Thats ok, I am sure I will catch her sometime when we both aren't busy. Well im out, I might be posting some pics lata.
