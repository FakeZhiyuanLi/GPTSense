      Loks like this thing is really gonna happen!  My last message from Blotsky was last night about 11:45pm.  He said we are on FOR SURE Friday night.  He was still checking on the addition of a Sunday Night show.  With that in mind, I have the following thoughts.  1.)  Bird, let me know if you are bringing your monitors---I won't need the amp, I jsut need the monitors. 2.)  Another thing for Bird.  I think we should go with Barry's kit on Friday, and if we do a Sunday show, we'll need Bird's.  Chalky's stage is oh so small...I know it would be great to have the VDRUMS in on Friday, but we need the space. 3.)  Here's the PA info:     a.) Since most of the stuff is my gear or stuff I am borrowing, I will be running it.    b.) I am very open to suggestions on running the mix, but I just don't want any    complications(fights, pets heads falling off, etc.), so I am "throwing down the ultimatum".    c.) Here's the gear       ---Mackie CFX16 (16 channel) Mixing console with built in EFX       ---The good old Fender Mains       ---Two 1200 watt Mackie Power amps(1 main, 1 monitor)       ---A Peavey Dual 16 band EQ       ---Bird's monitors       ---I am 98% sure I will have 3 mic stands       ---3 SM57's       ---2 SM58's       ---My 55SH Elvis Mic       ---Zipper Mask       ---The Snake    d.) I am planning on being at Chalky's as soon as they open..to get this setup  THOUGHTS???

      I personally am leaning towards Friday for the gig, but it could be possible to do both Friday and Sunday.  I know Barry is only available for Friday.  I guess we need to know if Chalky's would go for Friday and Sunday, or just Friday, or just Sunday.  This is plenty confusing...let's have a goal of knowing the official word by tomorrow (Wednesday).  After all, we are three days away from the gig.   Also, for any of you who want to do something Saturday Night, I am playing in a blues band in Wynot, NE for an outdoor crazy ass party!  Any or all of you would be welcome to sit in as well.  It is really good to be communicating with you folks again!  I miss you all and am looking forward to this reunion...whenever it may be!

      I have been reflecting on the history of Funky Blues Bastards, Groove Juice, and the Latex Deputies.  You know, some really funny shit happened in those years.  Some girl's hair caught on fire at the motel after the POMP ROOM gig. HAHAHAHA!  'member?  2 words...CRAZY HOUSE!  "...you guys sure do use a lot of syncopation!" --random drunk at the Mickey Mouse Operation  NO NOT SMOKING!  Oh, so many memories.  Do you have one?

      I am working the details out on PA gear.  I heard that Bird would be bringing monitors.  If that is so, then I should have evrything else covered.  If folks could bring their own mics and stands(if applicable) that would rock.  Thoughts, anyone?

      Diet Coke is the neatest of all sodas.  Recently this C2 stuff came out.  It is not as neat as Diet Coke.    Low carb Coke?  Come on!  Folks, you have to know what you are getting yourself into when you crack open a can of any soda.  IT IS NOT GOOD FOR YOU!  This is something I have known for years, and I've gotten over it.    So don't kid yourself thinking that Low Carb is the way to go on your favorite refreshment, unless you like the taste of it.  Personally I enjoy the taste of Diet Coke, that is why I drink it.  When Diet Coke first came out, folks got the marketing all wrong.  This product is not intended for you to lose weight.  It is not any better for you than regular Coke.  I personally think the marketing behind Diet Coke simply encourages Coke fans to make a steady diet of Diet Coke.  They figured by putting "diet" in the name would get folks to toss more sodas back.  Their marketing certainly won me over.  I need a Diet Coke.  BYE!

      Recently I attended the Crossroads Guitar Festival in Dallas, TX.  After reading review after review, I gotta say that most guitar aficionados have the wrong idea about John Mayer.  Lots of editors of guitar mags and other critics talked of John Mayer not belonging in the impromptu All-Star Blues Jam, or that he was sheepish, or he was "put in his place".  Did these folks see the same concert that I did?  First of all, John was invited on stage for a reason.  The man can play!  The other fellas (BB King, Buddy Guy, Eric Clapton and Jimmy Vaughan) were playing out of their minds and they still wanted John to join in.  He did just that.  BB King asked him to take a chorus...he did just what was told.  The solo was great...John can play!  He would not have received the invitation if he couldn't play.  It's nice to see someone who the blues gods of today deem worthy of sharing the stage and who is still in his twenties.  Guitar Player Editor In Chief Michael Molenda: “My favorite moment was watching John Mayer do the puppy dog thing to Buddy Guy, just knowing that the blues legend was going to put the kid in his place. Then, at the moment when the cutting contest began, Buddy stood up, looked at John, cut right into him, totally chopped him up into little pieces, and spit him out into the wind! When it was John's turn to play he just put his Stratocaster down on the stage and walked off quietly.”  ....UMMM that is not what happened.  The blues jam went too long, so they just went right in to Buddy Guy's solo set.  It was Buddy Guy with Jimmie Vaughan's band with John Mayer as a special guest.  They kicked off a tune, and Buddy went crazy.  He did some outstanding guitar playing right in front of Mr. Mayer.  When it was Mayer's turn to play, he must have gotten wind from the stage crew that Mr. Guy was over his time limit and they had to get Santana going...so John did the right thing and let Buddy shine in the spotlight.  A spotlight that was cutoff mid-song.  Yeah, the festival folks stopped Buddy Guy mid-song to bring on Santana!    But I guess these folks are right.  John Mayer was put in his place.  On stage with Clapton, Buddy Guy, Jimmie Vaughan, and BB King.  I'd say that's a pretty good place to be.

      Rumors have been floating around our knack of the woods that Groove Juice is gonna reunite for a one-time show at Chalky's in Vermillion, SD.  I am still gathering details, but here's what I think is gonna happen:  Friday July 2nd Chalky's-Vermillion, SD 9:30 to close  WHO IS GONNA BE PLAYING? The lineup is still not official (was it ever?), but here is who I have heard will be bringing the funk: Barry Knudson-Drums Brad "Bird" Menage-Drums Matt Rhodes-Bass Carolyn Koenig-Keys and Vocals Troy Stephens-T-bone and Kung Fu Fighting Gavin Wigg-Trumpet Travis Blotsky-Saxophone Troy Gillespie-Trumpet Yours Truly-Guitar Vocals and Excuses for why I forgot the words to all our songs  I am hoping that folks in the band will start using the blog to communicate before the show.  However, we were never known for communication...just smoking and drinking(which we did very well!).    I am really looking forward to this reunion!  I'll try to keep my pants on and my guitars away from Barry's car.

      For my solo acoustic show this Friday, I am seeking a few more songs.&nbsp; I have a whole night's worth, but I thought it would be cool to have my blog friends suggest some songs I've done in the past, or songs you think would work for me.&nbsp; I realize that most of the posts on this are not going to be very serious reccomendations, but if I get a few that I like, I may use them.&nbsp;   Have fun and let the American People decide my "strateegery" for this upcoming show.&nbsp; I want you to know that I would never "misunderestimate" the input of my friends and colleagues.  Cool beans.&nbsp; BYE.

      Greetings.&nbsp; I've got a strange title for my latest post.&nbsp; I guess you had to be with me...   Friday night was a great time.&nbsp; The Solano Lopez Orquestra made its debut at Westward Ho in Sioux Falls.&nbsp; The guests were treated to free rum at the "rum-tasting table".&nbsp; I wish there was one of those at every gig.&nbsp; Very nice.&nbsp; They were also privy to some smokin' Latin music.&nbsp; The highlight of the night was when Steve(bass), Jeremy(keys), and myself(only one to show up to the gig in shorts) traded "a minor" licks at the end of a song.&nbsp; Jeremy delivered that line&nbsp;we all love to hear, "it's not over until we get some tappin' from Miller!".&nbsp; I proceeded to tap away and Steve joined me.&nbsp; Then any song that I could remember came out.&nbsp; Good times.&nbsp; Some of us also sang the sax part to Yakety Sax to satisfy the token "yakety sax guy"(there's usually one of these dudes at every gig that involves a saxophonist).   We tore down and headed to Touch of Europe to catch the end of John Bertsch's solo sax gig.&nbsp; Very impressive.&nbsp; It was just John and his saxophone.&nbsp; I only heard four songs, but those tunes were cool.&nbsp; It was great to hear JB again.&nbsp; Nice work, JB!   Saturday was lessons again in the morning, followed by a nice "rock show" with Bullhurly at Club 52.&nbsp; It was great to see so many people in Yankton digging live music!&nbsp; I was a little rusty on some of the tunes, but it was great to hear my bass prevail through Club 52's system.&nbsp; We did an acoustic thing at the beginning of the 2nd set.&nbsp; It was righteous!&nbsp; Kicked it off with Every Rose...because   we had to.  &nbsp; A little Bon Jovi, some Hootie,&nbsp; you get the picture.&nbsp; Great idea, Jeremy!&nbsp;   I am still trying to erase a terrible image from my head.&nbsp; There was supposedly a swimsuit contest at this show.&nbsp; No one really knew about it, but they went ahead did it anyway.&nbsp; No participants...oh wait, a fella who looked like he just got off a tour of duty with the Mullet Brigade(cut-off belly shirt, combed hair underneath mesh trucker hat, mustache) decided to take his clothes off.&nbsp; He was wearing some black-sort-of-kind-of-elastic-high cut-elastic-bikini-middle-of-the-road-male person's-undergarment.&nbsp; YUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKK!&nbsp; I think we gave him a prize anyway, but I am not sure....yep, I'm scarred for life.   A big thanks to all of you who read this blog!&nbsp; Leave a comment.&nbsp; I might have a drawing.&nbsp; The grand prize will be a big healthy serving of "anything that had parents".&nbsp; GOODBYE.

      I am a rookie at this blogging thing.&nbsp; My poll kinda sucks, too.&nbsp; If you are doing anything other than the   4 things I listed,   you are probably feeling a little left out.&nbsp; In any case, you are probably doing   something,   and that's great!  Have a good weekend, nonetheless.

      Hey everybody.&nbsp; I must tell you I am getting very fond of my blog.&nbsp; It has been a real treat to mold it into what it is.&nbsp; As a matter of fact I added a poll question in the right sidebar.&nbsp; Make sure to get your answer in before 5:00Pm CST Friday.&nbsp; That way the multitudes who stop by this blog will know what everyone is up to this weekend.

      Yesterday Mindy asked me to feed my daughter some goldfish!&nbsp; No, she's no crazy.&nbsp; You know the snack-crackers?&nbsp; Yeah, they have that cool jingle, "here's our jingle for goldfish.."  &nbsp;  I am constantly amazed at how much she's growing up.&nbsp; However, I looked in our child development stages materials and found nothing indicating "eating goldfish" is milestone in an infant's life.&nbsp; I have decided to make a new set of milestones:  &nbsp;  Miller's Infant Milestones  &nbsp;  Birth to 3 months:&nbsp; Child is supremely successful in attempts to deprive new parents of sleep.&nbsp;  &nbsp; 3 months to 6 months:&nbsp; Child is not as successful in attempts to deprive new parents of sleep, because child is tired from all the eating, burping, farting, filling diapers, crying, etc. &nbsp; 7 months: Child eats goldfish &nbsp; That's as far as I can go for now.&nbsp; We'll keep you posted.

      Had yet another musical-type weekend.&nbsp; I had Friday Night off, even though Trace Mahoney of "GoFigure" called at 7:12PM offering me a gig at the Chateau with him and Shawn Coles.&nbsp; What is up with the Chateau?&nbsp; I guess they decided to not book a band for the weekend, figuring the normal band-folk would want to throw something together last minute...I decided not to return the call.&nbsp; Sorry, fellas.&nbsp; Trace and Shawn are good friends of mine, but I had plans with my daughter that night. &nbsp; Saturday was guitar lessons all morning.&nbsp; Get this...one of my students actually wants to learn how to read music!&nbsp; I am almost considering music-reading a requirement of all my students, but then again I am re-thinking my reasons to be guitar teacher at all.&nbsp; It takes a lot of time, and I feel like I enjoy my French Horn, Trumpet, and Piano students more.&nbsp; Those kids practice, and they fit better with my methods.&nbsp; Anyway, I get frustrated once a year with these same issues and I needed to vent. &nbsp; Saturday night was the Austin Buescher Band @ Leo's&nbsp;in Vermillion.&nbsp; The show went great with special guest Derek Hengeveld on drums.&nbsp; We jammed like&nbsp;crazy and the crowd was into it.&nbsp; One highlight was before the show.&nbsp; An inebriated fella composed a new hit song on the spot called, "Sit Down and Get Naked".&nbsp; It was quite catchy.&nbsp; It went "sit down and get naked, sit down and get naked...".&nbsp; It is an interesting prospect to sit down and get naked.&nbsp; I usually do it the other way, but this new song has me thinking I should change my&nbsp;undressing techniques.&nbsp; Thanks to all who came to the show and we'll see you in August! &nbsp; Sunday was a rehearsal for&nbsp;a new project.&nbsp; All&nbsp;I can tell you is "good times in the summertime!" &nbsp; Peace..I'm outta here!&nbsp;

      I notice things all the time.  Here are some of them:  1.)I drove by RentWay in Yankton and there is a sign indicating RentWay is "FOR RENT".  Hmm...a rent-to-own store for rent?  Don't think about it too long, it would much better for you to eat a Hostess Apple Pie (they are available at any Casey's conveniece store for $.99).  2.)I don't have a dishwasher.    3.)I spilled a huge bottle of Chocolate syrup in my garage.  I thought "Oh, no!  There will be ants everywhere!".  I was wrong.  There aren't any diabetic ants in my neighborhood(the syrup is sugar-free).  Despite being artificially sweetened via the goodness of Splenda, it's really good.  I am to the point where I can't tell the difference, so why would an ant?  I have noticed other things, but I am out of time.  Check you later.

      July has been a busy month!  Here are some events that I am participating in:  Tuesday July 13 Yankton Community Band Concert --I will play either T-bone or Euphonium.  I think this is the last community band concert of the summer, so I should(by the way SHOULD has a silent "L") probably go. Plus, the band will be playing a piece by my pal Jeremy Hegg.    Saturday July 17 The Austin Buescher Band at Leo's-Vermillion, SD. --I play bass in this blues/rock band.  Also, my buddy Derek Hengeveld will be sitting in on drums.  Good times!  Friday July 23 The Solano Lopez Orchestra at Westward Ho-Sioux Falls, SD. --I play guitar in this Latin Jazz group.  5 horns, keys, guitar, bass, drums, and aux. percussion.  A lot of cool Cuban music along with some barn burning Arturo Sandoval stuff!  Saturday July 24  Bullhurly at Club 52-Yankton, SD. --I play bass with this outfit as well.  A pretty good mix of tunes, and always a complete drunkfest!  You need to see this show...you don't see 4 beefcakes on stage rockin' like this everyday!  Friday July 30 Chris Miller at the Waterfront-Yankton, SD. --I am gonna fly solo on this one!  Me and a guitar, that's it.  We'll see!  See ya!  Ain't nothin but a party!

      Another fine weekend at the Chateau for the boys in the Dispensers.  A quick note about the Chateau for folks who have never been there...not only will you still see dudes with mullets rambling about, but some chicks will have them too!  Friggin' weird!  I mentioned all weekend that I was hungry for ribs.  I never got 'em.  Thanks to Dan Anderson (HB Productions) for handling the sonic portion of our gig.  We were dialed up well!  My bar tab was only $26.75 for the whole weekend!  There will be some additions to our setlist.  Here they are (as spelled on a napkin from a random audience member):  Faster Pussycat Stevy Rae Vaougham Leonard Skynerd  Good times!

      Alright everybody, it's just about here.  I am pumped as hell.  Blotsky, I have not been able to get a hold of Troy at Chalky's.  I am planning on bringing the 16-channel board and a spare power amp for monitors.  I will also be bringing 4 mic stands, 2 SM8's, 3 SM57's and a bunch of other mics.  I will also bring cables to support said mics and speaker cables for the monitors.  Oh, and the snake.  I will also bring the funk, y'all!  I think I can get there around 6-ish.  If I can't, I will call someone and give them my ETA.  Looking forward to our return to Chalky's!  It's go time!

      This time of year legions of football fans across the world huddle around their computers and begin assigning rankings to their favorite players in hopes of aquiring them to their fantasy football roster. I am a big fan of fantasy football. I just joined a league today. It makes the football season even better!  Let's start Fantasy Rock Band. Here's how it'll work.  *You have until Sunday August 22 @ 9pm CST to get your band together. *Post your band in the comments section of this blog entry. *Any musician is up for grabs, but they can only be in one band(so check the posts to make sure) *Pick 1 guitar player, 1 bass player, 1 drummer, and one lead vocalist. *In your entry list the musicians and then write a publicity statement. This statement will include the title of your band's  name, "breakout" single and album(be creative), as well as why you, their manager, think they are the best fantasy rock band ever assembled.  I will judge bands based on these 3 categories:  Creativity-50% Humor-25%(I mean c'mon...fantasy rock band?) Overall "rocking" potential-25%(don't pick Fabian or Esteban to be in your band. These band members will need to be proven rockers!)  Winner will be announced on Monday August 23rd on this blog. I will also email the winner. Winner will receive $10 (USD) courtesy of millerzblog.blogspot.com!  Good Luck Everybody and Have Fun!

      Ok.  So the Olympics are in full swing.  I wonder if you are aware of the  "I'll always find something wrong with every athlete's performance"  lady.  She's a commentator that makes it to the games every 4 years.  She annoys you with "...oh, big mistake there", "nope, see the angle was totally off and that's gonna cost them the gold", "see, she should have prepared a little more for that landing",  and "these two have no chance at medalling".  I am paraphrasing this woman, but she annoys the ever-living *&%! out of me.  I forget about her for 4 years and then she comes back...even more disgruntled than before.  Do you know what I mean?  Who is she?  Are there more of her?  Please help me out.  I'd like to send her some warm-fuzzy emails to cheer her up.  Then again, there's always my little machine...

      This week seemed to go by quickly(I am staring to use this phrase instead of "Geesh...this week went by faster than normal!" because it just isn't possible for one week to occur in a lesser amount of time than a previous week).  Here's some of what's going on:   Friday @ approx. 4pm:   My wife returns from a shopping trip in the Twin Cities.  I've had the reigns of the Miller family for only 24 hours, and I am ready to give them back!  Just kidding.  It's really not too bad when she's gone, It's just totally better when she's here!  I hope she had a good time @IKEA.  I have no idea what that place is, but it is the main reason for this trip.  A new IKEA opened up there, so my wife and her friends had to go see it(early reports say they spent over 4 hours there!)  What is this IKEA place?  Does anyone know?   Saturday @9pm:  The Austin Buescher band makes their return to Leo's in Vermillion.  I hope to see some of you there!  I really hope to see Derek there, because he's gonna be the drummer!   Sunday @5pm: The Solano Lopez Orquestra returns to Westward Ho in Sioux Falls.  This party we're playing for may have upwards of 500 people in attendance!  Other stuff is gonna happen too, so I'll include it in the Weekend Rewind!

      I saw Spinal Tap recently(this happens often), and I just can't get over how many good quotes there are from this movie!  What is your favorite?  Here's one:    David St. Hubbins:   Dozens of people spontaneously combust each year. It's just not really widely reported.

      I know...Harry Caray(in an SNL skit played by Will Ferell) said he'd clone   hot dogs.   When you think about it, an endless supply of hot dogs is pretty cool.  I got to thinking about it...what would I clone if I could clone anything?  The answer is   ME, Baby! ME  !  Think of the advantages of having more of  ME  around.   An endless supply of  ME !   Maybe I better not clone  ME .  I can probably think of a better word.  Maybe one that has more letters in it.  What (or who) would you clone?

      Last night on VH1 Classic was a show called Classic/Current. It shows a classic video of a popular artist and follows it up with a current one. That's when I found out David Lee Roth has a   current   song out! Yeah, David Lee Roth. They played "Just a Giggolo" and followed it up with "Sheebop"...I guess it's a current hit song of his.  WOW!   You remember those trolls that kids used to put on top of their pencils?  They had the frizzy hair you could play with, but that was pretty much it.  They covered up the most useful part of your pencil,  the eraser!   Anyway, that's how I look at David Lee Roth today...his frizzy hair is probably fun to play with, too.  That's it though. I bet it really isn't that fun.  It's sad to see Diamond Dave go down like that.  Note to self: I am not that good looking now...I won't be any better when I am 50!  A weird post.  Yep, this is a weird post.  Welcome to the department of redundancy department.

      Hey everybody!  This weekend was a cool one.  It started out Friday with my solo acoustic show @ the Waterfront.  A pretty darn good time.  I started at 7pm and I think I was told I was too loud about 3 times during my first set.  I guess the dinner crowd wasn't into Van Morrison as much as I was.  No big whoop.  I'd like to thank my family (my folks, Mindy's folks, Mindy, and Madison), The Merrigans, TC Steckelberg, Eric Turner, Jake Harens, and Mr. Veltkamp for checking out the show.  The other people who were there are to be thanked as well, I just can't remember the names.  I'd also like to thank Shawn Coles for letting me use his PA.  It is definitely possible for me to do this solo acoustic thing...I'll be gettin' er done again on Saturday August 21(Riverboat Days Saturday) from 9pm-12am.  Saturday all my lessons but one cancelled.  So I went to the State Swimming Tournament to see one of my students compete.  There were tons of people there and it was freekin' hot!  Incidentally the sugar-free lemonade I sipped on to keep cool came in handy.  Thanks Sunrise Coffee(a coffee shop that does lemonade and lots of other cold drinks...check 'em out @21st and Broadway in Yankton or online @ sunrisecoffeeonline.com).  Then my family and I went to Sioux Falls for no other reason than to consume mass quantities of beef care of my parents and the TimberLodge Steakhouse.  I love meat!  They didn't have the ol' 96er on the menu though...  No gig Saturday night.  I did however, take my family on an unexpected storm chasing adventure.  This was crazy!  The storm chased us!  If you heard about a Tornado near Viborg and Centerville...yeah we were headed right for it.  Not a good plan with the family along...I might have chased had I been with my fellow   'nader supporters  !  Get it?  Cuse I'm not sure   I do...        Sunday I sang special music at church.  The music was so special that I actually learned the song Sunday morning!  I am such an idiot sometimes!  I really need to stop putting off things like that.  Sometime I'll get around to giving up procrastinating...  Mowed the lawn Sunday night(thanks to Lester who gave me this fine lawnmower that still cuts grass like a champ!).  Then I put in a new light fixture in my kitchen.  Oh, we also purchased a new door for our front entrance, but I didn't put that in...I'll need some major help with that.  I've bored you long enough with the weekend rewind, thanks for reading. BYE.
