						   Despite its major key tag the  Sonata for Cello & Piano in F major, Op.99  by Johannes Brahms is a late work that is suffused with autumnal grace and melancholy – much like most of his last pieces – reflecting I’m sure the innermost thoughts, expressed musically, of a man who has arrived at the end of his life and can look back upon his deeds and accomplishments with a profound sense of comfort and serenity. Both these sensations are clearly evident in the second mvt,  Adagio affettuoso  where Brahms gives us one of his most deeply personal and serene melodies. And what better instrument to highlight these emotions than the haunting strains of the cello? In describing what Brahms sought to convey musically, a critic wrote: “This first part of the movement is completed by the lovely bit of fluid innocence, as of a candid child…”* There is indeed a distinct sense of the innocence of youth to the short melody that Brahms marked to be played  pp , extremely softly. Heralding its arrival is a short song of such immeasurable longing and melancholy that one might spend a lifetime searching for another as beautiful and sad. It is a testament to the brilliance of Brahms (as if such were needed!) that he chose to combine these two melodies within the fifty-three seconds of time it takes to perform them. Snuggled up next to the wistful melody of bittersweet sadness is that youthfully inspired tune whose descending notes remind one of the faraway echoes of the carefree laughter of children. What kind of intellect could come up with such a radiant idea? From where does such genius originate? It is truly a mystery of the creative soul and Brahms has to be one of its greatest practitioners. --kak * Daniel Mason,  The Chamber Music of Brahms  Edwards Bros., 1933 pg. 164

						   As I exited my front door and turned to walk around the front of the car, I looked down at my feet and there lay a humble leaf. It was quite dead, having assumed the tawny color of autumn and had obviously dis-attached itself from its parent tree. Of itself it was hardly worth mentioning – just another piece of detritus that will soon merge back into the earth and be forgotten almost as soon as one unwittingly tramples over it. No, it was not the dead leaf itself which had arrested my forward motion and caused me to stop and stare. It was what was resting  on  it, sequestered and protected within the curled body of the thing that made me gape. They were three tiny droplets of water. In the mornings now with the weather cooling down, the moisture content of the air is quite high. When the sun begins to lift off the horizon and warm up the atmosphere, condensation forms quickly and layers everything. Such was the genesis, I’m guessing, of this trio of droplets. But whatever the manner of their birth, they were a sight to behold. First off they were tiny. No bigger than brass BBs. But what made them so special were their perfectly spherical shapes and their searing luminosity. Being as tiny as they were, I’m sure their faultless shapes were a result of a combination of surface tension, capillary action (with the surface of the leaf they rested upon) and some covalent (or is that ionic) bonding thrown it. My knowledge of such  recherché  scientific laws is rusty at best, but the result of these laws was pure beauty. So perfect were these tiny balls that they appeared to be possessed of a degree of substantiation like diamonds and one had an overpowering desire to possess them, but I knew that their façade of solidity was just that. Any disturbance would displace the natural order that created such glorious things and they would vanish. I allowed them to rest.   Somehow, resting there half-way hidden on the inside spine of the curled brown leaf, they managed to catch the morning rays of the sun and in doing so, brilliantly magnified its light with blinding intensity. They looked like three tiny stars, so brightly shining with what appeared to be their own manufactured light that the sight of them stopped me in my tracks. I will never be able to describe to you how incredibly breathtaking was their glow. It was unearthly almost, that such minuscule things could be capable of extruding such an intense value of light. It was like staring into a halogen lamp at full register. I wish I knew some term or neologism to describe the concentration if this light to you my friend, but I would fail. Simply, it had to be seen – and thus experienced. I flirted with the trivial thought of rushing back into the house and getting my digital camera to record the event but the thought died, still-born in my head. What cheap contraption of man’s puny devising could ever hope to capture the essence of those three mini-suns? I would snap a picture, view it on my computer screen and inevitably sigh in dismay for not having accurately preserved the magic of the image. No. This was a special gift from the Almighty. To be seen by me only. With the cameras of my own eyes. To be developed in the incorporeal dark room of my own senses. Any descriptions I could hope to convey to you will be measured forever inadequately against the unbelievable spectacle that those three tiny diamonds presented. It is my hope however that you can perhaps imagine what I was privileged to see this morning. It is a sight one can hope to experience maybe once in a lifetime. --kak

						   Having come to Homer’s immortal world masterpiece,  The Iliad  early in my youth, the work was subsequently devoured every summer as the family vacationed across the country. And in the guise of Samuel Butler’s prose translation I learned to appreciate this most seminal of human dramas about love, war, glory and honor. It was thus with a mixed bag of emotions that I entered the theater recently to watch Hollyweird’s latest retelling of this classic story. I emerged, over two hours later, chastened and feeling somewhat cheated by what I just witnessed onscreen. In director Wolfgang Petersen & writer David Benioff’s defense, one can hardly hope to tackle the mammoth scope of a tale like  The Iliad  and encapsulate all the points that give the story its grandeur and pathos. No movie version – no matter how brilliantly conceived – can ever do better than the cinema inside one’s head and so the work should be digested first and foremost through the act of reading. The connection that is established by Homer and his Reader is always the best.   Here, Benioff’s knife cuts too deep. Major,  major  themes and characters are either restructured, or altogether expunged from the story in an all-but-impossible effort to translate the events of literature to screen. The most obvious examples were the compression of ten years of war down to a couple of weeks and the much ballyhooed decision to eliminate the gods in the epic which to me, hurt instead of clarified. I suppose the filmmakers wanted to give the story a more realistic human face, but in doing so lost the shining brilliance of Homer’s original by not allowing the audience to gauge the actions of the mortals against those of the immortals during the course of the tale. It is this running undercurrent that gives so much life to the story and incidentally, ironically immortalizes the actions of men above the gods due to the fact that the gods are deathless and mortality comes so very quickly and easily to men. True, there is a scene in the film between Achilles and Briseis wherein the Greek hero does touch upon this point and I guess we have to be thankful for small favors, but sadly, they were rare in this movie. Another flaw was the complete permutation (and in some cases mutilation) of many major characters together with the inexcusable  faux pas  of having some of them killed off long before and in a manner completely antithetical of how tradition tells us they were. According to the movie version, the later events in  The Odyssey  and the complete  Oresteia  itself could not have taken place! For instance, to whom would Odysseus’s son, Telemachus be visiting in Sparta in Book IV of  The Odyssey ? What need would there have been for Orestes to return from his exile? Granted, these are points that perhaps the average theatergoer would not ordinarily contemplate, but they are enough to send us classicists and the well-read screaming for the exits.   No movie can ever be more than a vision of its creator. In the movie  Troy , there exists the rather incongruous mantel of “northern-European weightiness” that permeates the main characters. This was nowhere more evident than in the look and feel of the sons of Atreus [Agamemnon & Menelaus]. The attributes we’ve traditionally come to expect in Homer’s proto-Greek Achaeans do not appear to abide in these gentlemen. They seemed more fitted for fighting in the Celtic Highlands of Scotland or the Teutonic forests of northern Gaul than under the bright Hellenic skies of the Aegean. In addition to the “heavy look” was the throwaway characterization of Agamemnon, the King of the Greeks. Here, the filmmakers’ heavy handedness was much in evidence as they seemed intent to show him and his brother in the basest light imaginable: as power-hungry warlords – and nothing more. All the subtleties of their natures as so laboriously created and maintained by Homer for twenty-four books of dactylic hexameter are swept aside for the expediency of one-dimensional characterizations whose sole purpose is not to overcomplicate the plot. Sorry, but I’ve come to expect my Homer to have a little more meat on the bone.   In light of the fact that major motion pictures about Homeric epics will always fall far short of the blind poet’s vision, I think it best for those of us who wish to experience the full sense of these classics should continue to reach for the book – not the DVD – on the shelf. --kak

						   Now, on to Ivan. Today’s reports inform us that the Russian Foreign Minister claims the United States (they go out of their way not to mention the word: Coalition) is trying to “completely destroy” Iraq. This too is hardly surprising coming from a nation whose odious secret weapons and technology dealings with the Saddam regime are now coming to light. The nation of Russia is like a petulant child. The Federation is brand new. And like an unruly child, they demand attention and respect, but they lack the maturity to garner either. They have only just shaken off the Soviet shackles that for so long bound and chaffed them. Fourteen years is hardly enough time to cleanse the stink of socialism and all its evils from their minds or indeed their decision-making processes. This sadly, will take generations to accomplish. They are scrambling to learn the niceties of democratic-inspired leadership, but in the meantime, their mafia, black-market and other nefarious organizations have sprung up and taken on a larger role in the country’s daily business. These shadowy and evil organizations have found fertile ground in the wake of the demise of the Soviet State and in truth, have been in many cases created, nurtured and strengthened over the years by the very oppression imposed upon them by that totalitarian gov’t. Surely, it makes sense that dissident & shadowy cabals and networks would flourish under such a tight-fisted rule. With the collapse of Marxist ideals beneath the weight of a steadily strengthening free world, the decaying Soviet Empire was ripe for these types of organizations. It makes sense too that the mind-set of such dealings would filter and bleed into the newly formed government’s way of thinking and doing business with the rest of the world. The Federation is in dire need of money. They have only just become a free nation. You do the math. They are liable to do  any thing that brings that money in. They do not have a history of a free society that they can look back upon to lay down rubrics of correct behavior. They can only look back to see restrictive Stalinist control masquerading as government and to recall all the “shady dealings” they had to conduct if anything was going to get done behind such a “curtain of iron”. These things should always be recalled when one hears such nonsense coming out of the Kremlin or observes their reprehensible dealings with tyrants and terrorists.  --kak

						   As I went out for my walk last evening, I ran into John and we were exchanging pleasantries. The skies overhead were clear and a beautiful, peaceful crescent moon was in evidence. I mentioned it was a crescent  Moslem  moon. John countered with, “Yeah, but there’s no star.” To which I answered: “Oh, they’ll be seeing stars soon enough.” He then sighed and said, “Yes, I know, this war… this war.” And shook his head sadly in that resigned, world-weary way that stupid peaceniks do when they think they are being sage. “War does not solve anything, KAK.” I grit my teeth, but smiled and said plainly: “No John. War solves everything. It solved Hitlerism, it solved the divided nature of this country in the eighteen-sixties, and the threat of waging an ultimately successful one even solved the problem of the soviet threat of world domination.” Stupid, uneducated, liberals… People who are oblivious to the events of history should never make statements like that. They should simply take their woefully uninformed opinions and fly up, up, up to Cloud-cuckoo Land and there titter and twiddle with the rest of the garrulous [and uneducated] songsters of the grove!  --kak

						   …My next topic for discussion is the joys of java. In deference to being an honored guest at your humble abode recently I held my tongue and did not unduly chastise you for keeping in your house (much less preparing and drinking) that odious brew that laughably masquerades under the moniker of coffee. To true java connoisseurs coffee from a can is a no-no. Yes, I know you will argue that it’s just fine for you and you are used to drinking it that way, but my dear friend, I think of your present plight as it pertains to the famous literary allusion of Plato’s Cave and the denizens that dwelt within, conscious only of the shadows flitting by on the wall they stared at, unbeknownst that the shadows are actually pale representations of the true world existing just behind them. Thought of in these terms, it might make more sense to you: drinking coffee is a luxury. We certainly don’t need the daily pleasures we derive from drinking it, and yet it is something we go out of our way to do each morning. Why then, if you’ve made the conscious choice to partake in this luxury, why isn’t the luxury at all luxurious? When you come here, I wish to introduce you to real coffee, prepared from freshly ground beans, kept safe from the debilitating attributes of light and air by being kept in an air-tight porcelain container until the moment of grinding. Only thus can you truly taste the dark roasted bean in all its glory. That pulverized brown chalk that claims to be the same thing is most certainly not. Go ahead… laugh… call me a snooty elitist bastard if you must. But I’m betting you will overwhelmingly enjoy and prefer the taste of my home brew to anything you can create from an aluminum can and that less-than-perfect method of slow drip brewing you adhere to. I’m not going to lie to you. I’m not going to sugar-coat the situation and say that in order to enjoy true coffee; it is an easier thing to accomplish than doing it your way. That is not the case. Mine is more time consuming, more entailed. Yet, what in life that is truly good is not also worth the extra effort?   And while we are on the subject of fine coffee, you might as well kiss that powdered creamer good-bye too. I can turn you on to the beauties of half-n-half which is the only civilized way to temper the more robust flavors inherent in true, freshly-ground coffee. Why go through the trouble of creating a little masterpiece in your cup when you sully it with powdered cream? This is the essence of tragedy. You should start buying your coffee in a sealed foil pouch, whole bean. But already I take this subject to untenable lengths. When you arrive, I will have plenty of opportunity to berate you for your former life styles.  --kak

						   ...And finally, I was watching the news this morning and flipped it during a commercial break to catch a minute or so of some goofy syndicated adventure drama. In the few seconds I was watching it, waiting for the Fox News program to return, I heard one of the characters mutter something about the Grim Reaper with his “over-sized hoe.” Hoe, Richard,  hoe . Who writes this %*^#? The genius of Death as personified in the Grim Reaper always carries a scythe, not a hoe. They are two distinctly different instruments. One is for digging and turning the earth, the other is for shearing wheat [or souls]. How that one got passed the editors I’ll never know. I don’t think Death would be half as scary if it only crept around trying to gather humans by beating them down with a garden hoe. But such is the lamentable state of what passes for entertainment in this country nowadays. --kak

						   …Long gone are the days when the cushions had any sort of reasonable life and suppleness to them. Today they resemble large, square indented brown pancakes that deflate with horrible swiftness at the least bit of pressure applied to them by a pair of descending human buttocks. One does not sit on this couch as much as fall into it. Like the tumbling young maiden in  Alice in Wonderland , you discover that you keep dropping deeper and deeper into the earth and only stop when your butt completely displaces every last ounce of support from the tired old cushions. At this point, you are seated in such an outrageously awkward position the mere sight of you would make a circus contortionist blanch. Suddenly, through the wheezing haze of your tortured breath – straining to bring oxygen down to a pair of crimped and folded lungs – you realize you are staring up at your own kneecaps towering several feet above your head! You feel dizzy and unbalanced for a moment to think that the human body could attain such an impossibly unnatural position. Then somehow, amid all the pain and shock, you must gather the strength to part your legs so as to at least afford yourself a partial view of the television screen across the room.   And these support-less cushions are not the only problem this man-eating piece of ancient furniture presents to the user. The armrests, after eons of wear and tear, have become twin pain-wracked, torture chambers. The faux-leather Naugahyde skin has lost all traces of its original suppleness, and under countless successions of humid summers it has managed to dry up and split; ripping open like a steam-filled foil bag of  Jiffy Pop . The resultant sharp, jagged edges of torn vinyl fabric invariably invite comparison to the sleeping arrangements of an Islamic  fakir  who chooses as his peculiar place of repose a wickedly sharp bed of nails. As soon as you rest a weary forearm across the damaged material, you instantly discover that it is not unlike laying it atop a field of razor-sharp, scoriaceous  aa  lava which carpets the slopes of Mauna Loa. You want to scream out in pain, but of course the unnatural origami-like folding of your diaphragm precludes any chance of gathering enough air in your equally twisted lungs to produce a croak of despair, much less a scream of pain. Such then, are the deplorable conditions of this Marquis de Sade Couch. And I for one shall certainly not shed a solitary tear for the eventual fate of this wicked and inhuman contraption of weakened foam, dried wood and torn vinyl. --kak

						   Dear Nielsen Ratings: I would first like to thank you for allowing me to participate in the rating poll. However after reviewing my diary, you might perhaps have considered another individual to better gauge the “TV watching experience”. My inclination through the years has been to watch less rather than more.   Where does one even  begin  to discuss the attributes of TV on our society? To quote Homer (the Poet, not Simpson) “…had I a thousand tongues and a heart of bronze, I should not do it justice.” Its pervasive influence is felt in countless ways. It is both a boon and a bane and I have (as I suspect many TV viewers do) a love/hate relationship with the infernal machine. As I am a Boomer, TV has always been there and I have watched it from its near-infancy up until the advent of the digital HD surround sound age. Early on, it provided me with the fodder from which I drew my imagination and storytelling skills. I am a writer and would be less than honest if I didn’t credit TV with that early spark. Still, as I aged, I began to prefer my own imagination to that of producers and directors in the media. I have an inordinate love of history books and classical music—I own a library and an audiophile sound system—and those two things fill my hours much more than television. For the most part, I would have to say that TV fills in those few times when I have nothing else that interests me and therefore does not command my allegiance to any one show or time slot.  Still, I would not have you think I view Television as the  bête noire  of our times. I am not insensitive to the fact that it is indeed the window to the world for most of us. But as the prime disseminator of information, I find it at times sadly lacking. With the invention of 24-hr news, the networks now have the onerous task of filling the day’s broadcast schedule with something—anything—that smacks of news coverage and this has precipitated an entire culture of airing events (or giving them unwarranted coverage and importance) that they clearly do not deserve. The O.J. Simpson trial is a prime example of this malady.  The final arbiter of such things is of course, The Viewer. He has the power to switch the set off as often as he pleases. As the Delphic Oracle once admonished: “Nothing to excess”, and it would be wise to recall this when sitting in front of a television for hours on end. Human nature being what it is, I suspect many of us would just as soon sit there, allowing the TV to create our world and be our prime mover in it. Its power is undeniable but the real power lies within us to use it the best way we see fit. Sincerely, 	  --kak

						   I always look forward to the hourly chimes of a clock in the house whose tune is based on the ubiquitous chimes of Westminster, the famous “Cambridge Quarters”. The descending notes strongly bring to mind two instances of music by Johannes Brahms.  The first and most well noted being the lovely “horn call” of his Symphony #1. With only a slight difference in the first measure, the chime-theme of the clock can be transposed into Hans’s lovely horn song that dispels the dark introduction and ushers in the solemn brass chorale in the 4th mvt. In fact, the similarity of the two was so striking; first-time listeners of the symphony in England thought for sure Hans lifted the theme from their chiming clock at the church at Magdalene College in Cambridge University. [It was there that the chime was first introduced, even before it was installed in Big Ben in London]. We have of course, the card from Hans to Clara Schumann of Sept 12, 1868 wherein he quotes the theme with the words: “Thus sounded the Alphorn today … High on the peak, deep in the vale, I greet thee many thousand times!” so we must believe any similarity between the horn theme and the clock chimes is purely coincidental.  The second musical resemblance I have found (and which I have not yet heard anyone comment upon) is even more identical to the chimes of Big Ben. It is that of the wonderful D-flat major theme near the end of the Brahms Piano Sonata #3 Op. 5. The first four notes of this joyous theme match exactly the first four of the clock chimes. This would also appear to explain why I always seemed to begin humming that theme from the sonata each time the hour chimes sounded. Apparently, Pavlov’s salivating dog had nothing on me! --kak

						   The two armies face one another across the narrow pass. The earth is squeezed at this point into several impossibly narrow defiles between land and sea. To the north are the shallow silver-blue waters of the Malian Gulf. To the south is the steep face of Mt.  Kallidromos —an ironic name given its English translation from the Greek: “the good path.” To the mighty invading Persian army, there is nothing good about it. It is an insurmountable barrier that keeps them from attacking the left side of the Greek line. While its slopes are not sheer, they are steep enough to disallow the Persians access to any sort of flanking maneuver. A carpet of dry brushwood cloaks the places on the slopes where the bare rock of the earth itself has failed to poke through. Higher up, above this area of chaparral is an oak forest near the beetled summits. The air is redolent with the scent of the sea, the sage and thyme of the mountainside and occasionally, the distasteful sulfur odor from the natural hot springs close by. The sheer visual effect of that brooding mountain at whose very feet lay the shore of a gently lapping sea is spectacular to the point of incredulity. But more incredible still is the sight of the men who are sent to hold the Pass. Lacedaemonians. Spartans. A distinct breed of warrior whose existence can only have been created in a land of such ruggedness. They are dressed for battle and stand stiffly at attention in perfectly formed phalanxes across a wider part of the pass. In their solidity, they seem almost to be a natural extension of the mountain, an adamantine bulwark of bronze. There is an awful grandeur about them, a disconcerting and terrible sense of single-mindedness in their demeanor. And it is a ruthless devotion to discipline that keeps them standing straight, immobile, unflinching at the sight of the mighty Persian war machine—many times their number. Their expressions are unreadable behind the cheek plates and nose guards of their tight fitting Corinthian helmets, the tops of which carry red- and white-dyed horsehair plumes. It makes them seem more an unwavering line of machines than men. Yet, men they undoubtedly are. Men honed to a paradigm of physical proficiency not seen before by the invading host. The fluttering blood red cloaks of the officers are the only things that bestow any sense of movement upon the scene. More of that terrible bronze is sheathing their chests and covering their sturdy legs. Their arms, meaty and darkened by a life spent exercising in the sun are gripping spears whose bronze tips glint with a palpable and sinister sense of impending peril. And lastly, there are the huge bronze shields. Each of them held rock steady in front of the cuirasses and bearing the great pyramidal “lambda” of the Greek alphabet. It represents Lacedaemon, their home and country and the reason they have arrived and are prepared to defend to a man, the Pass of Thermopylae.

						   As you might know from the commendable act of reading your Thucydides, Arcadia, in its strictest geographical sense is confined to a mountainous inner area of Greece. Its boundaries are roughly in the center of the Peloponnese whose rugged terrain of its interior assured that anyone who came from this area would automatically be one tough old Greek. Concurrently, Hellenes from this part of the nation have a reputation for being real backwoodsmen and country folk, being famous for their inherent toughness even back in antiquity. The mistakenly imagined sylvan fairyland of “Arcady” which has existed in Western consciousness since antiquity and subsequently bolstered by the great landscape painters of the 17th C. can be laid at the feet of three minor idyllic poets of the Hellenistic era. Theocritus, Bion & Moschus. To quote scholar, Peter Green:   Their mythical Arcadia (the real Arcadia was, is remote, backward, mountainous) could only have been invented by nostalgic urban intellectuals who never herded sheep, much less milked cows, in their lives, but were hooked on the seductive dream of a lost rural Golden Age .*  Indeed, the 3rd C. BC poet Theocritus was born on the island of Kos and lived his life in Alexandria, which explains why he wrote so glowingly about a place he had probably never visited. To take the point further, the French painter, Nicolas Poussin, in the 1630s and ’40s whose lavish canvases depicted a bucolic richness and serene sense of ordered landscape further cemented the idea of Arcadia as a place that has a park-like setting where the minor god, Pan pipes on his tuneful syrinx, satyrs romp in unabashed sensual pleasure and bacchanals are a daily ritual. And this concept has not only been confined to paintings. It has emerged in the other Arts and been brought up to date with the ballet of French composer, Leo Delibes,  Sylvia , (1875) and of course, the Disney animated feature,  Fantasia .  I suspect, looking at it from a cockeyed psychological perspective, the images of Arcadia as a happy woodland place where Man need not toil to enjoy the earth’s rich fecundity, where he can lay on just about any patch of ground and be ensconced in soft verdure, where drinking from sparkling cold springs and eating ripe fruits and quaffing sweet wines the life-long day is in fact, a way to make more manageable the actual horrors of the untamed forests and wilderness. In reality, it is a place were creatures ready and willing to eat him lurk, where iron-hard trees must be backbreakingly cleared before the laborious effort of planting and nurturing seeds can provide for his sustenance, and where laying down on the ground can probably earn someone a snake bite on their posterior or a nasty meeting with a patch of fiery poison ivy! Nevertheless, to this day that dreamy state of Arcady fills our imaginations with thoughts of only good things and of the bucolic pleasures to be found there.  --kak * Peter Green,  Classical Bearings  UC Press 1989, pg.148

						     Frankly, an average ten-hour shift guarding nervous critters in an animal theme park was not the most pleasurable way to pass one’s time. Thus, I devised numerous antics to help stave off the continuous onslaughts of boredom. One of the better ones I recall was when I explored the buildings at the rear of The Park and there, discovered several large freezer units. Inside these were kept the various food items for the big cats. Being particularly bored on this particular day, I lifted a cover on one of the freezers and was surprised by what I found there: dozens of horse hooves. Frozen-solid horse hooves. God knows how they were procured, but I knew where they were headed: into the caged compound as snacks for the lions and tigers.  Immediately, my warped mind hit upon another use for these grisly items. And grisly they undoubtedly were. Although frozen through-and-through, with hanging tendrils of sinew and muscle clinging to the bone, they looked suspiciously like the mangled stumps of human limbs. I nearly cried out with joy at the idea which hit me that instant and hurried back to the guard shack to test my new theory on unsuspecting employees who had to pass by me before entering the rear gate of The Park. I had no trouble slipping the frozen hoof into my right jacket sleeve while holding it with my hand that was now completely hidden inside the arm of the coat.  As the employees walked through the gate and waved, I waved back, using my recently acquired “mangled stump of a hand”! The initial shock on their faces was most amusing and well worth the risk I ran of allowing the frozen hoof to partially thaw and ruin the sleeve of my jacket. It was especially fun to watch their reaction when I leaned out of the shack and waved my stump while admonishing them: “Don’t get too close to them tiger cages!” --kak

						   As the great Ionian Greek philosopher of the 6th C. BC, Hercaclitus, so eloquently put it: “nothing endures but change.” During my life I could count on few things as holding steady and being forever rooted to the solid foundation of this earth as I could the old and tired Miami Seaquarium sign that sits at the entrance of Rickenbacker Causeway. The sign itself is a tall, open-sided concrete and metal affair, in the center of which is a rig that was built to suspend a life-size taxidermed reproduction of a tiger shark ( Galeocerdo cuvieri ). The model itself was attached to this rig and by means of a motor hidden in the top of the structure would constantly whirl around and around and around in an endless succession of circles, convincingly mimicking the animal’s inbred and aggressive stalking technique prior to its sudden feeding charge. I might take a moment here to digress from my main point by observing I found this symbol of a shark (an authenticated man-eater no less) to be a pretty odd choice of beast to display at the entrance of one of this city’s most popular beaches. With its huge length, menacing dorsal fin and rows of prominent teeth, one would think this would be the last image anyone would wish to foist on a public about to head to the sea for a day of fun and frolic. Be that as it may, the model was hanging there and twirling for years and years. It is somewhat illustrative of the times it was erected I suppose. Years back sharks were little known beyond their savage image. A promoter could evidently woo more of the paying public into his attraction by offering them a glimpse of the alien and dangerous sea life lurking just off the shoreline than by hawking the ocean’s more peaceful and less menacing inhabitants. But as the Greek above reminds us, change is constant. Nowadays, sharks are seen in a more subdued, less frenzied light. Much more has been learned about their lives and behavior, and as with everything, fear of the unknown is replaced with the courage of knowledge. In our politically correct society we can ill-afford to malign any creature that swims, flies or crawls without first offending some over-zealous animal-lover. Thus, the time has come to take down the ferocious image of the hunter of the sea and in its place, display two playful – but more importantly – innocuous and politically correct bottlenose dolphins. This is what happened recently. As I drove onto the toll road just before the plaza, I could not help to notice a large truck parked at the bottom of the sign. Even as I watched workmen were struggling to attach the two aquatic mammals to the refurbished rig in the newly painted structure. Now sporting bright colors (the ubiquitous aqua-and-orange color scheme of this area) and a new neon-lit plastic sign, the structure has been reborn and beckons tourists with the promise of a fun and entertaining day at the marine park. But I still think I would prefer to look at that old menacing tiger shark. True, its paint job was in dire need of a new coat, the countless hours under the searing Florida sun had shrunk its faded skin until the metal ribs within began to protrude as if the poor thing was  in extremis  from want of prey. The once white threatening teeth were coated with a film of blackened soot belched from the tailpipes of the endless parade of cars passing below, and finally, the motor used to give it life had long since ceased to function or had simply been turned off so that the once animated fish was now frozen in one position. Still in all, I could always count on seeing it there, keeping an unblinking eye out for potential meals in the cull of traffic that funneled down to the several gates of the tollbooth. Aah, changes… they are sometimes hard to endure. --kak

						   Several summers ago I found myself wandering the aisles of the library at the U of M’s Marine & Atmospheric Science School on the Key. It is one of the premiere centers of tropical marine research in the world and so has a first-rate science library as well. Every once and again, I like to wonder in and cruise the bookshelves, nosing into tomes of indecipherable scientific complexity. Sharing as most humans do, a fascination for pelagic creatures that are bold enough to swim right up to you and eat you, I was drawn one day towards the collection of books detailing the life and behavior of sharks. I am happy to report many works on this subject lined the shelves. My perverted attention was lured to the books that featured more illustrative content rather than narrative. I was certainly not disappointed. Ghastly photographic evidence of human trauma after shark encounters was there by the score and I shall refrain from detailing the images of mangled arms, legs, torsos &c. But the one photo which clearly beat them hands down, strangely did not involve a man-eating  carcharodon  at all. No, the photo in question was one of a captured Nile crocodile. It was a magnificent specimen, measuring well over fifteen feet. It had been captured and killed and it rested on its side on the muddy shore bank. Its massive pale underbelly had been neatly slit open from throat-to-anus and the contents of its stomach partially exposed. I had to blink twice and refocus my eyes before I was willing to concede what it was I was gawking at. There, staring back at me from the ruptured and partially-spilled guts of the mighty saurian beast was a human head! Apparently, some poor native had fallen prey to the croc not too long before and paid the ultimate price. Stomach acids had halfway digested the flesh from the skull, but enough remained to give a general impression of the previous owner’s features. The eyes, appearing to be closed, were in fact pulled wide due I suppose to the overall shrinkage of the skin. It gave the face a vague oriental look about it, as if the eyes carried the epicanthic folds of an Asian. The lips likewise were partially drawn back and open, exposing a rictal maw. Somewhere in the depths of that expression, frozen in death, you could vaguely make out its living counterpart. I would hazard to guess that the last expression of the unfortunate victim was somewhat alike with its teeth bared in an expression of pure terror. Now, the head in its present state was just an inanimate object, stripped of any aura of humanity. Who among us can even begin to conjure what nightmarish feelings this poor native was fated to endure as the creature’s vice-like jaws snapped shut around his head? Anyway, the image of that grisly item peering balefully from its frame of glistening viscera more than satisfied whatever latent  Grand Guignol -type of fascination I possess for such things. --kak

						   Suffice to say, I am only now–in my doddering middle age–beginning to appreciate (much less comprehend) the sheer scope and the myriad intricacies of the polyglot communication system we like to call the English Language. I fear my meager mental acumen can never hope to take in the entire exhausting extent and overwhelming range of our mother tongue as illustrated so inclusively by the size and heft of the  Compact Edition Of The Oxford English Dictionary  I proudly own and cherish. Not to leave the Americans out in the cold, I also own the  Merriam-Webster’s Third International Unabridged Dictionary  which looks and weighs as much as a paper elephant. I figure between these two monarchs in the world of the printed English lexicon I would never be at a loss for a ready reference to a particularly sticky morpheme. Alas, such is not the case. I have stumbled across one word which appears nowhere in either mammoth tome cited above. I found it in (of all places) our local rag-sheet:  The Herald . It might further astound you to learn that it was printed in an article about fishing, deep in the Sports Section. The story contained the usual pabulum, of interest only to diehard Florida fishermen. Near the middle of the article was a short narration quoted by a local charter boat captain out of one of the many fine marinas hereabouts who was answering the reporter’s question about where the best place would be to find dolphin. He spoke of watching for “weedlines” on the surface of the sea, as it would be an indication that dolphins were near. Weedlines in this sense means large floating patches of sargassum. Without ever having seen the word before, I knew exactly what the good captain was talking about. One sees these peculiar floating carpets of gulfweed quite frequently in Biscayne Bay. I was intrigued by the word and so scrambled for my collection of dictionaries. First I tried the  Webster’s 10th Colligate , as it is always close at hand and has the added benefit of not weighing as much as a downtown skyscraper. Nothing. Next, I tried the massive Webster’s (a modest 2,662 pages) from which the Colligate stems. Nothing. I then cracked open my two-volume  Shorter Oxford English Dictionary , (a combined and staggering 3,801 pages) but once again was stymied. I finally had to go to The Source and pulled open the huge  Oxford  (a mind-blowing 22 volumes of 16,200 pages microfiched down to 4,116) and got to work with the supplied Bausch & Lomb lens. Would you believe it? After squinting into the reading glass for a few minutes, I came up with zero. The closest thing was the word: weedling, meaning a small weed or a slight person. Maybe I shouldn’t be all that excited and amazed to find a word whose inclusion into their famous book is denied by our stuffy English brethren. After all, language is a constantly changing entity. --kak

						      Oh the shame and humiliation! It happened after I had taken my obligatory rest on the edge of one of the docks at the marina. I walked out to the edge of the piers and sat down to drink my bottled water as I usually do. I finished and prepared myself for the journey back, in doing so I tried (foolishly as it turns out) to carry too many things in one hand. I had the bottled water, my  Sony Walkman  and their set of earphones with its tangled cord all jumbled together in one sweaty palm. But I forgot a very important lesson. I forgot the fact that I am somewhat dysfunctional. I must constantly be monitored so as to not cause harm to myself or those around me. But out on the dock yesterday, I had no one there who could supervise and so I set myself up for trouble. In the midst of trying to gather too many articles in one hand, the inevitable happened: one of the items fell from my grasp. As fate would have it, it was the  Sony . I can remember thinking very clearly in that tenth of a second it took for it to slip from my fingers that I was presently standing in the center of the dock, equidistant from both edges. I said to myself, “Oh, that’s okay, I am safely away from the edge of the dock and the  Walkman  will not fall into the water. It will hit the concrete hard and probably sustain some minor abrasion on its plastic shell, but at least I can pick it up and be on my way”.   Wrong!!   As if daring the elemental laws of physics, the  Walkman  did something completely unexpected. It bounced! It bounced off the concrete deck of the pier like it was made of rubber! The word, “kinesis” is a wholly appropriate one to use in this instance. It means simply the sort of physical movement that lacks any sort of distinct directional orientation and is dependent upon the intensity of the stimulation applied to the object in question in determining its ultimate trajectory. Well, my stupid mishandling of the tape player certainly provided it with all the stimulation it needed and the kinetic energy released from the dropped  Walkman  dictated it should bounce in such a way as to allow it to rise again to the height of about three feet—but most importantly, not to fall back directly to the dock. No, it sailed in a perfectly conceived and executed arc until it easily cleared the edge of the dock and disappeared forever into the jade-green waters of Biscayne Bay!  I couldn’t believe it. It wasn’t supposed to do that. It was suppose to hit the concrete and sit there. Holy crap!! I just lost my  Walkman ! I looked around immediately afterwards to make sure no one had seen my embarrassing faux pas, but I needn’t have bothered. I was alone out there on the piers, accompanied only by my dysfunctionalism. There was that sudden sharp pang of loss, knowing that even if I possessed the courage and/or stupidity to take off my  Nikes  and socks and wade into the water from the boat ramps at the head of the docks, (it being extremely low tide and water depth was barely three feet at that point) it would be a useless act anyway because the salt water would have instantaneously damaged the delicate mechanisms inside the machine. So I just stood there with a now useless set of earphones in my hands and bowed my head at the tragedy of having unintentionally buried my dear friend at sea. And to double the pain and loss and sorrow, I had just committed one of my favorite cassette tapes to the deep along with the unit. My faithful  Walkman  was now a part of the bay – consigned to the watery depths to perhaps become a home for some tiny mullets or crustacæ. May they get as much pleasure from it as I had derived from almost four years of ownership… --kak

						   Unique talents as coaxing insects into a shoebox – once learned and perfected – are never forgotten. This is a good thing for I was standing behind the circ desk at work yesterday minding my own when an urgent cry from my boss forced my attention in her direction. All I caught was her saying something about a woman back in the stacks who needed some help with a snake. I assumed naturally that it was a patron she was summoning me to with a question on a book about snakes. I walked out from behind the desk and went in search of the patron, mentally making note of where I could find the books on reptiles in non-fiction [598]. As I approached the elderly woman I could plainly see she was distressed. Her face was flushed, she had her hand (which was trembling slightly) to her throat, and she had the fear of death in her eyes. Clearly this was not the way most females react towards me when I approach them. It had to be a  real  snake we were talking about here, not a virtual one found on a picture in a book. I was correct. She managed to blurt out that there was a snake lurking on the carpet in front of the Large Print stacks and as she told me she kept turning her head round in that direction as if expecting the monstrous thing to glide around the aisle and attack her. She was so distraught that I had to take hold of both her arms to calm her down. I said I would see what I could do and moved along the stacks until I rounded the corner and saw with my own eyes the hideous thing that had so horrified her. From her attitude, I thought I was going to at the very least confront a thirty-foot Hydra with many hissing heads and I wondered just then if I shouldn’t have first run back to fetch a Heracles-type knobbed club with which to knock some of its many heads senseless. I didn’t even retain a faithful comrade like Iolaus to burn off the mangled stumps once I put the wood to them. But once I saw what confronted me, all thoughts of a fight to the death were put firmly to rest. What so terrified the old lady was indeed a snake, but one reaching no more than three inches in length with the circumstance of a thin knitting needle. Its flared head was about the size of the sulfurous head of a matchstick, but much less dangerous. I’ve encountered earthworms much bigger than this thing. After assessing the “danger” this poor bedeviled creature exhibited, I returned to the patron and told her I would take care of it. I eased her fears by saying she was in no imminent peril as the critter’s tiny mouth could hardly open wide enough to bite any part of her much less swallow her whole. Recalling now my successful dealings with the scorpions in my past, I went in the back room and reappeared with an old coffee cup and a wooden ruler. Returning to the reptile, I managed after a couple of attempts to herd it into the cup with a dexterous use of the ruler to gently help it on its way. I went out the back emergency exit door located nearby and overturned the cup into the grass, returning the dazed creature to its natural habitat. The old lady returned to hers: the mystery aisle. I returned to the circulation desk.  --kak
