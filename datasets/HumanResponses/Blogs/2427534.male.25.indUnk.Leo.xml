      Article 1 of the French Constitution, "French shall be an indivisible, secular, democratic and social Republic. It shall ensure the equality of all citizens before the law, without distinction of origin, race or religion. It shall respect all beliefs. It shall be organised on a decentralised basis."    True, French is a secular state alright--provided that it ensures equality without distinction of religion.  There's a reason religion is mentioned in the same breath as origin and race--because it is recognized to be something inherent from birth.  One does not choose to be Muslim any more than another chooses to be black on Wednesday and from Kurdistan on Saturdays.  This is a direct response to your "if you want to be Muslim, do it in the privacy of your own home" line of argument.  So, I'll be Muslim at home, and not Muslim at schools?  And let's not fool ourselves that the ban affects all religions equally--there's a reason why no Jews or Catholics are protesting on the streets.  Face it, Arab/Muslim/MiddleEast bashing is in, hording WMD is out--and let's not forget that politicians are trend chasers in the worst way.  I'll bet on the side that this is 85% a vote-getting ploy of the wiley Frenchman.  From what I can read, the French Constitution (and the 1789 declaration of the Rights of Man which is quoted in the Preamble) upholds the same principles of equality, freedom, and liberty that U.S. holds so dear and brandishes around the world without impunity.  Since we are all much more familiar with the U.S. constitution, I think it is safe to say that such an egregious transgression in the U.S. constitutional standard shouldn't be able to fly in France either, with or without fois gras.  Another thread of your argument that I picked up goes as follows (my paraphrase), "If you want to enjoy the many benefits afforded by your French citizenship, then act like a good French and assimilate without your head scarf or go do it in your own country."  Needless to say that nothing in the French constitution says anything about protecting the integrity of French culture.  Just because you have escargot does not make it indispensible.  Furthermore, this sort of nationalism, provincialism is nothing more than a thinly disguised racialism.  This sort of thing is precisely why Middle Easterners hate Westerners because Western values driven by Western currencies are polluting their not nearly inadequate Muslim states, and everything that is fucked up in the Middle East can in some way or another be blamed on U.S. and Europe.  Hey, even the Taliban probably wouldn't have flurished without not-so-secret U.S. funding.  Not that it justifies the terrorism, but when you run out of socially acceptable outlets to fight back, naturally you go for his crotch, or bite his ear.    Plus I take personal offense to this "assimilate or go back to your own country" bullshit.

       Taps has been in Europe for too long   I still cannot believe that Jon thinks the French has a right to ban religious headgear in public schools.  Actually, he believes more than just that, that the French are JUSTIFIED to do so.  Jon says, if you live in the country, use its language, and enjoy the economic advantages provided by the country, than you should respect the customs of that country.  Is being French equivalent to being not Muslim?  Here's the first article to the French consitution: "France shall be an indivisible, secular, democratic and social Republic. It shall ensure the equality of all citizens before the law, without distinction of origin, race or religion. It shall respect all beliefs. It shall be organised on a decentralised basis."  There does not seem to be another way of interpreting the above statement so that "secular" is emphasized over "equality without distinction of religion."

      "You have cat eyes." "What do you mean?" "The way you look at me, curious from a distance, sort of reminds me of cats." "Then what are your eyes?" "Lately I think they started to resemble dolphin eyes." "Why, because they're smiley all the time?" "Only half right.  Because they're smiley and accomodating around people, so that they get pats and hugs on their back instead of harpoons.  But around their own kind, underwater, that's when their eyes come to life." "Cats don't swim." "That's too bad, because I've always wanted a cat."

       Just returned home from Blockbuster, returning FFX2   Just as I was about to start chapter 5, I realized that I wasn't about to get the mascot dress spheres.  That really took me out of the game and started thinking about how I was playing it...my heart just wasn't there.  I was doing it all wrong--in more ways than one, since I wasn't about to get the mascot dress spheres, fuck.  The story of FFX2 is, how should I put it, stunk with month old moldy cheese.  I just don't buy the whole Yuna as a Britney rip-off thing.  All the missions in this game just seem pointless to me (ironic, there's a status effect called just that, pointless as it prevents you from earning experience from battles) without all the Final Fantasy trademarked apocalyptic melodrama.  Maybe this has to do with Square becoming Square Enix?  I mean why else would they thwart decade-long tradition of stand-alone FF universes?  All those reviews calling the mood "upbeat" were, in my opinion, sales-friendly euphemisms.  It's upbeat in a too-old for Mickey Mouse club sort of way.  The gameplay though was good.  I like the dress sphere system, it really plays well and is especially appealling to obsessive micro-managers like me.  It's pleasant to fuss about the party line-up, equipment and the dress grid to get the most out of your party in battles.  I am especially proud of the way my party has evolved into the powerful and versatile group that they ended up being at lvl 38 and 58% completion.  I have 2 strong black mages, one white mage, 3 capable fighters and one sonstress that is on the verge of being ridiculously powerful.  Imaging what they can do if given more time and adding the mascot dress sphere?  Imaging having a berserker with counter!?  God did I do the wrong thing by not finishing it, not obsessing about it and returning it?  Which brings me to my next point.  I was so obsessed about it I didn't even realize that this pointless obsession, as fun as it is while it lasted, has to end sometime, and by then you're not going to be any better off (especially not with the way I'm playing it, over-analyzing battle line-ups and constant save and reloads; I'm playing it as a system and not as a game and definitely, through no faults of my own mind you, not as a story).  Upon discovering the fact that mascot DS has eluded me, it dawned on me that this whole FFX2 binge was just that, a binge, a target of obsession so that I have something to look forward to when I wake up.  I don't know which is more pathetic, not having anything to wake up for, or finding something to obsess so that I have something to wake up for.  Although to be fair, something positive did come out of this week-long binge.  A week is really not that bad, it could be worse than the ~50 hours that I have already invested.  And I did eventually stop it on my own will (no need to pat my own back, thank you).  It also served as a nice transition, a weening period from weed, alcohol, masturbation, a good prep period for the meditation retreat to be sure.  And everyone needs a binge period every once in a while.  I think after last time I binged in FFX at Jon's studio, I ended up writing the thesis, so who knows what good might come after this one?

       Gee, my last post was Saturday?   Something happened Saturday/Sunday night (I couldn't remember which was which, which is all the same nowadays) that changed the patteren of my day-to-day activities.  No it's not that.  I rented Final Fantasy X2.  End of story.  You know as well as I do how all that micro-managing customization of black mages and warriors can brighten/dim my otherwise un-noteworthy activities.

       What's your game?   Frankly to call the way I play basketball my "game" is probably stretching it.  The way I ball is just that, no more and no less.  I see myself as a jack-of-all-trades kind of player.  If the team I play on are full of bangers, then I will make myself available for some outside jumpers and make the entry pass; if there are too many wannabe penetrators and jump-shooters (which is most often the case, dubbed the I wanna be like Mike effect), then I'll bang inside, box-out, and set body-slamming screens; if I play with a passer, then I'll move without the ball; if it's a well-balanced/out-of-my-league kind of game, I've got no qualms with being a facillitator, moving the ball around on the perimeter and hunt for my catches.  I can be a shorter, less athletic Elton Brand.  I can also be a Marbury with less handle and speed.  I can be a Stoko with no stroke, a Kobe with half of his first-step.  However, since I'm undeniably 5'8", I will have to become a better perimeter player.  Improve my 3-pt shot from a triple-threat position will definitely help in that respect.  One caught-off-guard dribble and you've got a 15-foot jumper or, if the lane presents itself, a layup.  I will also have to improve my ball-handling, so that I will have the ability to always be in a triple-threat position.  Wouldn't that be nice: regardless of where I am on the court, in which hand I have the ball, I will always have the ability to go left or right, pull-up, one-dribble and pull up, two dribbles and pull up, pass to any spot, or just take it to the house.

      So, today is the day when everything will be depleted.  When all is consumed, all there is left is emptiness.  Indeed, it is precisely emptiness that you seek in life, the proverbial "meaning of life," since to live=to consume.  So why not skip all that, rather than seeking emptiness through consumption and daily toils, find a way to search for it directly, discover a straighter path, or even better, find a path that folds the 3-dimension space itself, and indeed even escape the 3rd, 4th, 5th, .....all together, scrap all that, wipe it out, and find the source of nirvana?  Through meditation? Through stoned meditation? Through Vappasana meditation? Through through the that shaky jiggly piano rythm? through shower in the morning after working out?  through typing with cold fingers as if the fingers are falling off from frostbite? through dead hand?  oh my god my hand is not my own?  it's saying things?  what's it saying?    nothing.  was that a holy moment?  I think I just had a glimpse of god him/her/it/themselves.  I lost the moment just as I got lost admiring the previous sentence.  That was good stuff.  Definitely good stuff.  I'm hesitant to type more, occupying "precious" digital space with my mental masturbation.  But since occasionally it gets better than real ones.  I didn't want this to happen, but it has to sometime.  You can't go back and erase that now, that'll be just another piece of mental makeup you've covered yourself so thick and pasty with.  You keep searching for that next step of dismantling it all and bring it down.  Sort of, in a very real way, the collapse of Berlin wall!?  Just let it out, you've been contracted and withdrawn for too long.  and exhale.  let it all out.   breath, and suck in another 10^12 O2 molecules and make them mine, make them pieces of me, make them pieces of pieces of me, 10^12 pieces to be exact.  hold them in my custody for a while and put them through torture, slap them around a bit so that they bump into each other, into others, into others that don't exactly resembling anything they know.  Imagine the terror!?  Jesus!they'd scream and find themselves attached, like the worse half of the siamese twin, to this hideous, gigantatronicalizationally-challenged monstrocity!  They then go through clocks and wheels with 10^13 spokes, one nanosecand at a time, and when it comes full circle,  And them you make them pieces of shit and flush it down the drain.    Imagine the relief.  That pleasant whoosh, they'd call it.  Some call it nirvana.  ---- damn that was good stuff.  Confidence-building practice session.  This time you go for a reach and you made it look easy.  Make it look good and not even blink an eye before taking your next shot.  Your eyes are enlarging, pupils dialating, sucking in and lining up the next shot.  You know he's watching.  What are you gonna do, miss the next one and let me at the table?  he thinks, or he would think, would have thought, would've had thoughten? that's about right folks, that's about right.    how about a story with a detailed description of each and every single shot?  Maybe, oh, no, this is a better idea.  do it also possibly as a metaphor as losing virginity.  Yes, a hidden, meaningful personal metaphor.  disguised with your favorite game.  2:00pm, Thursday You sit in the couch flipping through channels with hardly a trace of earnesty, and you come across ESPN2, a match for $50,000 between The Magician and Bustamante.  And you get the urge, the almost but not quite under the bridge kind.  You go to Kelly Mcues, and you bring your cue with you. because you saw Bustamante's left hand shot and you go to practice yours. and someone comes along, plays you games and you play along, with your left.  then he brings bets onto the table and you keep using your left.  then he brings the kicker, the big hustlin' number.  little did he know that you're just about to pull the biggest hustle there is, back onto him.  not believable.  no way someone who has a servicable off-hand would be a virgin to big money games.  But try to think of another metaphor though.  Come to think of it, having a lefty shot is a huge weapon playing against another.  It's a challenge not to use the bridge, even if not accepted you can still make it apparent that you'ce gained an edge in the mental match: "Oh, you're gonna use the bridge? (option) I'm gonna use the bridge too then."  But then again, you can't really fake a good lefty in the eyes of even just a halfway average player.   Comes full circle, don't it.  Back to pool, back to yesterday's topic of discussion, musings on pool or something like that.  Your life is like a skipped record, that keeps repeating the same 10 seconds over and over again at 60bpm.  Comes full circle, don't it.

       Musings about pool:   One of the lessons the game of pool taught me is how to become a good fatalist/determinist.  Of course one can get into serious academic debate about that label, but (since I'm not 100% in tune with my Phil 80 teachings) I'm going to use that term simply to describe the attitude on things outside of your personal control, things cannot be changed by will alone, things that are simply matters of fate.  I am not a big subscriber of the American dream, of manifest destiny.  Is the human will an all-powerful force?  Is your lot enitrely the result of your past actions and choices?  Obviously not, at least not on the pool table.  Terms shooters refer to such as rolls, dead rails, fast felt, dirty/chipped balls, tigh pockets, dead stroke, The Pool God all carry an aura of mysticism, of luck and chaos beyond one's control.  I will venture to state that all pool players, more or less, carry an superstitious attitude.  There's a lot of gray area, co-governed by fate and will, between what you want to do on a table and what actually happens.  However, the game of pool is also a craft that can be practiced and perfected (to the best of one's abilities, not literal perfection).  And the direct result of increased proficiency in pool is the decreasing of that very gray area.  A superior pool player naturally has a smaller discrepancy between execution and results than an inferior player.  Better players can account for gray elements other than shotmaking such as speed and english and table lay, and to some extant even to the psychology of their opponents.  As your skill progress, the gray area narrows....but never completely disappears.  And that's why I love the game of pool.  It is an ongoing battle of will and fate, but with a healthy dose of respect for the inevitability of fate.

      Quotes from The Diamond Age:  "Their hard shoes were treacherous on the cobblestones, their chins were in the air so that their high white collars would not saw their heads off.  They had arisen many hours ago in their tiny high-rise warrens, their human coin lockers on the island south of New Chusan, which was Hindustani."  "What are letters?" "Kinda like mediaglyphics except they're all black, and they're tiny, they don't move, they're old and boring and really hard to read.  But you can use 'em to make short words for long words."

      Idea for a story:  A child's psychological self-experiment gone awry: survival of the fittest, but in a human society where the fittest is ill-defined, who then do you compete for suvival?  I know, I'll just compete against myself.  Somehow the kid becomes a psychopath.

      Played 8-ball with Gus (w/ the mustache) today.  I've played one-pocket with him before, seen him kid around 9-ball games, but only today did I realize how good Gus truely is.  His game is solid.  Tight stroke, not spectacular, but he knows exactly what he'll get out of it on every shot, even on those lefty shots.  He had a few jaw-dropping shots (my jaws), but he's not the best shotmaker I've ever seen.  But he plays the table wonderfully and gets perfect speed almost every time.  I tried to keep a tight table with clusters, and I'm sure it's by no accident that he mostly picked the harder group.  Every shot for him serves multiple purposes: potting balls, positioning, cluster-breaking, pocket-blocking.  He let a couple of them slide and took it easy on me, but I'm not sure if he knew that I knew he was tanking it to keep me focused.  One one shot, he played a distance safety when I knew he could have hooked me (it was maybe a 70% makeable shot, I made it without getting shape).  It was truly humbling, a bit frustrating, but I know I took advantage of the few bones he tossed my way and made those runs count.  At least I can say that the couple of games I won were some of the better games I've played.  I must have a chat with him next time about improving my game.

      Mom mentioned in passing today that she's going to book the tickets back to Taiwan for 1/7.    I thought: "Shit, how am I going to get out of this one?"  My initial reaction did not surprise me in the least, considering how conscious I am about myself being a unemployed, live-at-home nobody.  Being an unemployed live-at-home nobody in Taipei and facing inquiries from families and friends about it do not sound like the best ways to spend my Chinese New Year.  The prospect of receiving red envelope money at an age when I ought to give out red envelopes doesn't sound like fun either.  So, I enrolled in 12 units of Saddleback classes, which will give me something to do until I hopefully fly to Japan in June.  Tentative plan for now: Vapassana retreat, Saddleback, meanwhile study for GRE and take it sometime in January.  Get in touch with Agnieszka and Krista (am I still allowed to mention ex-profs by their first names?) and discuss grad school.  Hopefully I will be able to put together an application in time for September.  Hopefully.

      Not blogginng the past couple of days...okay, past triple of days...has made me realize what drew me to blogging in the first place.  To live day-to-day with enough thinking and doing to have something blog-worthy a the end of the day.  Since I didn't do a whole lot (Thur: basketball games at Marks; Fri: played some pool; Sat: Wooden Classic at the pond--where Stanford upsent yet another #1 seed Kansas) in the past triple of days, there weren't a whole lot to blog about obviously.  This needs to change.  Something has to be done, one day at a time.  You know what that is so start doing it today.

      Scripted from NBA Fastbreak:  Tim Legler: (watching tape) During the early stretches in the 4th quarter, Tim Duncan did not get the ball on 3 consecutive possessions and the Spurs failed to capitalize on Shaq being on the bench with 4 fouls and the chance to go up 13 on the Lakers.  Kevin Frasier: (unsure) But Karl Malone has been playing great defense in the previous 2 games.  Greg Anthony: (with straight yet restrained poker face) Yes Karl Malone will always give you 100% on the court.  During that stretch Horace Grant was on the floor who isn't nearly the same defensive presence as Karl.  Kevin Frasier: to add insult to injury, the Spurs...

      Oh yeah.  This is sweet.  Blogging, Lakers/Spurs, stoned, Duke/MichSt.  Yeaaahhhhh. I'm going to take a major copyright risk and test an idea here.  During the beginning of the second half of Dk/MiSt game, the play-by-play commentator made a comment about how michigan state's center ought to play more fluidly, react to the game, and maybe get angry a little bit.  Dick Vitale one-upped him, "You gotta play to your nature, some people are introverted and some people are extroverted and you just have to be yourself and play like yourself."  And I thought, damn, commentators are just like the game of (name your own sport) that they commentate on, battling each other in the off-court contest of wits and tongue.  Aren't they just like  all the MCs  battlin' and droppin'  beats and rhymn's soul and taste em'? On the life stage of the straight chillin' ah shit lost it. in'  So here's an idea for sports entertainment.  How about instead of two white guys talking about 10 black guys, have two black guys, no, two flowing brotha's (or even better, sista's) represent fans on each side, researching all the stats and the stories of the game just like the commentators today, and just freestyle against each other?  You can market this "product" easily.  Say get a copy of old games and just find two rappers who like sports, which I'm sure it's not hard to find given all the retro jerseys I see, and lay down the track and sell'em?  I should get a Creative Common on this one.  -------  4 and a half to go, let's try some literal, typewrittin' game commentary.  How many blocks does Shaq have?  God, it must feel pretty shitty to be Nesterovic right now when your man is just swattin' the shots of just about every single one of your teammates.  ut still La is only up by 81, this is a pretty close game.  Momentum shifts, change that, the momentum is floating about and both teams are tryin' to change that and thake possession of it, rip it down like an out of key rebound.  That's the difference between the NBA game and the college game.  Once a team gets even a double digit lead it is impossible to come back, momentum is strong once you grasp it, you have less pressure to make every single shot...unless you have the Laker/Duke defense.  Duke 59 MSU 36 with 6.5 to go.  God they're good when they can take their time.  Sure Kryswivky (I'm guessing that the Duke coach'll must've had lots of trouble making people remember the spelling of his name)  The Lakers can't score though.  this is a must score situation....but they do know how to get to the freethrow line.  Kobe is learnin' it now from Karl, instead of taking it to the rack.  God I never seen Kobe headfake so much in his vain attempt against Bowen to draw a jump shot foul....Bowen is smart, he fell for that one just 2 possessions ago and he's learnin' fast.  SportsWriters don't give enough credit for the smarts of some of these NBA players.  I've lost steam, even the most stubborn of all run-on sentences has a way of doing that.  Holy shit, Shaq has 9 blocks.  Literally (I had no idea earlier, but he really did, no just seem to, reject every Single Spur...replays of blocks were only shown on the Spur starting lineup).  Lakers up 4, with 13.5 seconds to go, the game is, unlike college basketball, in the fridge and the egg is gettin hard and the jellow is jigglin.  Well, college is got that short 3-point line, speaking of which Charlotte just made a big 3 down 1 against Alabama, on the big play replay.  I love college basketball season.  But even with that college 3-point line MichSt still can't overcome a 22 point lead--that's how good Duke's defense is.  Okay, that's a wrap.  Maybe I should treat this bloggin' a bit less like mental masturbation.  But then again, what isn't when you're stoned?

      Talked on the phone with Mark about my JET app.  I dunno, wasn't very helpful, picked out a few typos and awkward sentences but didn't find the closure I needed.  Fuck.    Pop!  Here's a ingenius idea!  What if I put my app in this blog and and maybe someone will comment on it!?  (putting this idea on screen was probably only 10 seconds off the idea coming into existence in the first place; 10 seconds off real time ought to be an acceptible blog tape delay)  Here's the thing.   urlLink JET  stands for Japan Exchange and Teaching, a program for people to go teach English (or whatever comes out of your mouth most often) in Japan.  ALT stnads for Assistant Language Teacher, the position within JET that I'm applying for.  The application is due 12/5, that's this Friday.  The application itself has to arrive at the Japanese Embassy in DC on Friday so I would have to FedEx it out overnight by tomorrow, ideally.  I need someone other than myself to read it and comment on it.  So here it is, my best imitation of Brian Henderson of 1215 Maple Lane.  Yeah, Wow.  (for future reference: this is a reference of that Budlight commercial; note to self: you watch too much TV)  Here are the directions for the essay: ·	2 pages 2x spaced, type name and page number (1 of 2) on bottom ·	why JET: why Japan, why ALT ·	describe past/present experience, professional skills, relevant interests and personal qualities.  ·	What you hope to gain personally and professionally ·	What effect you hope to have on the international and Japanese community 	 And here's the essay itself to be critiqued, hopefully by you:   I was born in Taiwan and raised in a three-generation nuclear family.  My grandmother lived in post Japan-occupation Taiwan and enforced her anti-Japanese sentiment by forbidding us from eating sushi and refusing to ride in my father’s first Honda.  Perhaps my curiosity towards Japan initially took hold as the forbidden fruit in the eyes of my grandmother’s xenophobia.  Ironically, it may have played a part driving me to become a gaijin in Japan.  I am fascinated by the fact that so little is known about Japan in the West.  The entire world knows about samurai and Hondas, but somehow the Japanese people still remain inscrutable to the eyes of Europeans and Americans.  It is remarkable how much of the old habits of Orientalism are still with us as we think of Japan by how they are different from the West.  I wish to come to Japan not to understand these stereotyped Japanese institutions, but to find and meet and live in the Japan that is populated with ordinary people with ordinary desires.    Drawing from my limited and indirect knowledge of Japanese culture (gleaned from Japanese pop culture and journalists/historians such as Patrick Smith), I understand the Japanese as a culture with polarizing values: institution vs. individual, tradition vs. progress, Oriental vs. the West.  It seems to me that today the Japanese struggles to find ways to assert itself as nihonjin in an increasingly global, liberal, and perhaps Americanized world.  This kind of cultural identity crisis is something with which I identify strongly, having grown up in Taiwan but come of age in America.  I believe that in order to understand and be conscious of my cultural identity (or the lack thereof) and to become a better world citizen, “the Japanese” and I have many things to learn from each other.    Capsule philosophies aside, my background and experiences have prepared me well as a JET ALT.  I have been on both sides of ESL programs: as a student when I first arrived in U.S., and later as a tutor to other similarly situated bilingual students.  I have also designed and taught (as part of a 10-person team) an undergraduate laboratory course in a classroom setting of 10-12 students.  I understand first-hand the challenges of teaching and learning the English language and I am familiar and comfortable with managing the classroom environment—both of which should prove valuable assets for any assistant language teacher.  In addition, having worked as a legal assistant after college, I am confident that the communication skills I have honed from working with attorneys will translate positively to my work assisting Japanese English teachers as an ALT.  The JET experience will also benefit me professionally.  Considering my plan to attend a graduate program in philosophy upon the completion of JET program, my academic career would undoubtedly profit from the teaching and public speaking experiences that the ALT position offers.  Additionally, I hope to use my time in Japan to explore the culture of Zen Buddhism, since (I’ve been told that) philosophy PhD candidates with background in Eastern religion/philosophy are hot commodities in the competitive academic market right now.  Drawing from my background and experiences, I know I could bring a unique blend of skill and perspective to the JET program.  I am excited for the opportunity to discover how I can best apply my background and skills.  I thank you in advance for your time and consideration.  ....... If you've gotten this far, then my prayer has been answered.  Email me (I am not completely proficient with posting email/hyperlinks on my blog yet) at thejeffcho@yahoo.com

      So, this is blogging eh?    Just finishing up the JET application, 2 days before deadline.  I guess this habit of perfectionist/procrastinator will never die in me.  Somehow work never seem to assume its finished form until right up in the ass crack of deadline.  I've forgotten how much fun this is, just me, caffeine, hyper fingers, unfinished run-on sentences and the backspace key.  By the way, shot 10/37 from 3-pt today.  I love the newly discovered Eastwing court.

       Chinese New Year   Dinner at aunt's restaurant China Gourmet.  Same old menu, same old string bean beef, walnut chicken, chow mein with the same overly soysauced taste.  It's a small place, the kitchen plus the dining area probably no more than a couple hundred square feet.  The clamoring woks and spatula and the shouting orders added a hole-in-the-wall feel and actually made the place more Chinese eventhough the items are white Chinese food.  It's the first time I actually observed how uncle run the business, chatting and joking (consisting of mainly generic comments and greetings and hearty but transparently business smiles) with the customers, in my opinion probably trying too hard to add a homely feel to just another Chinese fast food restaurant, but it must've worked over the years.  That's what experience gives you I suppose, restaurant after restaurant after restaurants.

       The conversation   Had a conversation with Ian Hutchison tonight.  After reading Rationing by Mary JapneseLastName Waters, I really got the sense why Mark and I get along so well.  Not because we are intelligent in the same way.  Frankly, judging solely by academic achievement (which is the criteria of intelligence by most people), I believe that I am more intelligent than Mark (not meant to be a knock on him) there's no doubt that I am ahead of him by significant horse lengths.  But we are similiar in how we are not intelligent.  We are similiar because we are not smart in the same way: neither of us are smart enough to ignore our similiar shortcomings and are bounded by these shortcoming by the same way.  Both of us are extremely aware of why we are in a similiar career dilemma together.  I can't even say why at this point, but both of us are after the same lofty goal of happiness without having any clues of how to achieve it, and both of us are doggedly after ways to achieve it in one single shot.  We are not ready to set intermediate goals which MIGHT lead us in the right directoin.  We want to achieve it and take the right step to achieve it righ tNOW.  The conversation with MArk's dad really put things into the right perspective.  I have this strong feeling, more than a strong feeling, that dad would've said the same thing, had we been able to communicate on the same level in the same language.  There's something uncanny about our similarities. abour our family background, about our family relationships, about how these family relationships are carried out.  I am just super glad that, gasp, I migh thave found a front runner for soulmate right here.

       My writing habit   My personal writing habits definitely resemble her process of writing food reviews: xx-ing out sentences, editing and re-editing them until frustration dawns.  The bulk of what I have written in my life thus far have been academic papers, and I have adopted habits that (I believe) best suit this sort of analytical and argumentative essays.  Unlike Anne, I have never written a single draft in my life.  My writing process is probably as smooth as 405 during the evening commuter hours.  I agonize over each and every sentence, adding prepositional phrases one after another into every nook and cranny of the sentence.  It often takes me more than 5 minutes to finish one single sentence, and I usually take breaks after a few have been written in a row, feeling quite satisfied.  Once a sentence is written I seldom go back.  I like to think of my style of writing as an organic/vegetative process, a paper that slowly grows and matures sentence by sentence.  One significant downside: reading it is an organic/vegetative process too.   I also like caffeine binging into the single-digit AM hours.  Not that I feel that my mind is sharper at night, nor is it because caffeine activates my muse, but because I like the sense of martyrdom that you get from working all-nighters and because it is the only thing that can overcome unscrupulous procrastination.  Due to caffeine and laziness, I like taking frequent bathroom breaks while I am writing.  I also enjoy bi-directional pacing—it’s a good contemplative look in the corner of the library.  Keeping an open internet connection while I am writing is also important as it gives me access to dictionaries and thesauruses and ESPN.com as well as other bits of entertainment.  In sum I enjoy putting myself in peril of distractions and procrastinations when I write because despite the quality of my writing, the finished product will always be a triumphant result with that “against-all-odds” feel.

       Back to OC   Back to blogging in the black leather loveseat, in front of tv clicking keys to Sportscenter and college BB highlights.  Didn't get the job, I am somewhat surprised, both at the lack of an offer and how disappointed I was.  Even considering that I probably unconsciously sabotaged the interview (even Kayvon said so), there is no doubt that my qualifications are top-notch.  The only reasons I can think of are 1) they might have hired someone who speaks Spanish or 2) they might have hired someone who is actually enthusiastic for the job.  Oh well, no big deal, back to OC and my Saddleback classes.  Still, the trip to SF is not without success of other kinds.  It was nice re-connecting with those guys, from whom I have definitely intentionally or unintentionally distanced myself away.  Talking to Kayvon, joking around with Ben, cooking and cleaning with Dave, smacking the shit with Evan definitely made the week (unfortunately I missed the chance to hang out with Wyler).  I realized that the reason that I grew distant was most likely because of this little slump that I am in.  But hey, even Buddha said himself that nothign is permanent.  I should make an effort to call those guys more often.  I'll end today's blog with an one-liner I had in the shower: I don't put myself on a pedestal, but I am definitely a stool above everyone else.

       And it continues in SF   Blogging in the brown leather laz-boy in SF sure feels different.  There's always a good excuse for a few days of missed bloggs.  Friday morning I emailed in my resume to Hanson Bridgett for a short-term case-clerk position.  Monday morning I took off from OC, and this morning I had the interview.  There's a distinct possibility that I may be looking at 3-4 months of SF residence starting today.  The interview went well.  Perhaps a little bit too well--there wasn't a thing I would change about the interview and that was probably a sign that I fucked up something major during the interview.  i was interviewed by the paralegal, who I had decent rapport.  The case will be against Flour Daniel which is headquartered in, guess where, Aliso Viejo.  The discovery will be conducted electronically, using, guess what, Summation.  Megan Allyse, the interviewing paralegal, is interested in my philosophy background and who is (I deducted) interested in bioethics herself, and was curious about, guess who, Agnieszka Jaworska.  It seems I had all of the cards...  Which would make it difficult for me to refuse the position if I had gotten accepted.  I'm actually getting used to the idea of chillin' at home and taking Saddleback classes and aborting that to come to SF actually isn't as appealing as it would have been even 3 weeks ago.  What changed?  Meditation?  I doubt it.  Just rolling in karma, rolling along.

       Further Meditation on Vipassana   Even after 10 days of meditating in monk-like seclusion, I still have doubts about Vipassana.  Doubts about its philosophy, its metaphysics, its "secular" theology.  But not doubts about the technique itself and its practical benefits.  Vipassana claims to be a secular meditation technique, but during the 10 days we were bombarded with Buddhist philosophy/metaphysics/theology from all angles.  Everything is Buddha this, dhamma that.  Not that I have a problem with it, out of all the major religions I do find Buddhism to be the least indoctrinating and most user-friendly.  However, at times Goenka's video lectuers do have the feel of a sermon and I am allergic to that kind of religious innuendo.  The basic assumptions that Vipassana makes are rational enough.  The source of all suffering is craving/aversion.  Craving/aversion arises from sunkara (sp?), which I understood as emotional reactions against physical sensations.  As sensation arises, one quite naturally develop a +/- preference for it.  During meditation, as long as you observe your sensations with supreme objectivity and equanimity--i.e. no +/- preference--you will not generate sunkaras and you will there have averted craving/aversion and thus in turn misery.  Since the nature of everything is imperminance, it is only rational to treat everything with objectivity and equanimity without attaching to something so transient and ephemeral.  In this way, I suppose meditation is used as a practical metaphor for life.    What about carving/aversions that have non-physical/symbolic abstractions as their objects?  What if what you crave is merely an idea?  I suppose it is easy to point out that any mental activity has physical/biochemical/neural manifestations, which, in principle can be "felt" and the same technique can aid in the elimination of its corresponding craving/aversions.  There is logical contradiction in this: if as I understood previously, by maintaining that one can separate physical sensation from its mental treatment (separating pain sensation from pain experience), then it is essentially stating that the link of mind and body must be broken in order to transcend misery; yet, to eliminate craving/aversion for mental objects, one must resort to the very link (mental object as physical manifestations) that he tries to break.  This is asking for the impossible, it doesn't make sense to use the same sword to cut itself in half.  Furthermore, even if somehow this logical contradiction can be avoided, the technique can merely eliminate the resonance of craving/aversion (mental object resulting in physical manifestation, which is felt and further crv/avs avoided) but not the source, which is necessarily mental and does not stem from bodily sensations.  Additionally, I don't feel that craving/aversion is necessarily evil.  Sure they cause misery, but they are also fundamental elements that drive evolution and progress.  A lion craves meat (not in the emotional sense, but in a more philosophical sense that since meat will extend its existence and it naturally gravitates toward an "evolutionary" craving).  The nature of life is such that it craves its continuation, life's object of craving is life itself.  But then I suppose this is precisely the battle Buddha is trying to fight.  The law of nature is cyclical suffering and struggle to further itself, and Buddha is trying to break man out of that cycle.  To shatter our craving for our own life?  Regardless, there's no doubt meditation will benefit me in ways other than guiding me on a labyrinthine path to enlightenment.  Studies have shown that it increases mental focus and awareness, reduces stress and lethargy.  I can already feel that I've been having more dreamful sleep, more lucid dreams, and less sleep.  I crave these physical manifestations of my slightly cleansed mind so much that I will continue to meditate and discover about Vipassana and Buddhism.  Until the day I realize that I can break the circle, I will continue to use this craving for meditation and its benefits to fuel my medative elimination of craving.

       Meditation on Vipassana   First blog of the new year, back after 10 days at the Vipassana meditation retreat.  First let's start with the elements.  Can't complain with the amenities and accomodations if they're free.  And in fact, they were quite nice, much nicer than I expected.  Three beds with shower in a heated suite the size of my room ain't bad (especially if you had the un-bunked bed like mine).  Heating was key, as it was quite chilly in Joshua Tree, one often wakes up in the morning discovering new patches of ice on the sandy grounds.  The desert surround was ideal environment for meditation.  I hiked up to the foothills discovering that there was literally nothing around the center at least a mile or two around.  Other than the occasional freeway noises you hear absolutely nothing except for the birds, the wind, and the gongs.  The course was timed nicely progressing through the up phase of the moon, ending on a full moon.  At night the moonlit desert looked like sandy beaches and the Joshua trees looked like malnurished palm trees.  The food, oh the food.  I would say that its pretty good, refraining from using superlatives because my enjoyment of it was perhaps due to augmentation by diminuation, the 1-meal-a-day effect (besides the mostly bland oatmeal breakfast).  Vegatarian with plenty of soy and occasional dairy, I can remember soy steaks, ginger fried rice, potatoe soup, lentil curry, chick pea curry, patthai (hmm), kale with penut sauce, veggie lasagna, bean and rice mexican, some Greek (which I doubt) lump mixed with corn and soy which wasn't half bad.  Other than the flatulence and the twice daily shits, I was always satisfied after lunch and only mildly hungry at night.  Let's save the meditation for tomorrow.  I'm dead tired now.

       A cocky omen   Last night sucked.  In fact, put the whole of yesterday into the sucking category.  Yesterday sucked.  Woke up, jogged 3 miles (big+little Audubon loop), met up with Mark at Costco tire-center to drop of the Tercel, off to Venice beach around 11am.  Walked up and down Venice beach boardwalk, visiting pipe shops.  On one of the first shops we stopped (they had the gas mask bongs) Mark pointed out a longish blue pipe on the shelf.  I took a mental note.  We later returned to the same store.  The clerks, both of them, were extremely patient and helpful with us (which should have immediately rang my alarm), were eager to explain all the intricacies of glass work to us.  I surveyed several pipes, including the one Mark pointed out earlier.  Bluish green, a little on the dirty side, longish with a deep bowl in the shape of a hammer, but with intricate multi-color glass lacing 3 dimensionally.  Nice looking piece.  I decided against it initially, choosing another more traditionally shaped spoon, but reneged at the last second and took the hammer.  The clerk threew in a bag and a couple of glass filters.    Somewhat happy about the purchase, we also bought two cognac sniffers for John's birthday and a bottle of Reformador tequila for myself.  Shit shaved and showered and went to Cirque du Soleil in Orange County Fairgrounds.  73 toll road took us there in under 10 minutes and we had plenty of time to walk (like a mile! in the cold!) across the street for a couple of brown-bagged beer from the Circle K.  Returned and met up with Meg and Asian Jeff.  (Hi Asian Jeff, meet Asian Jeff!  Oh we've met.  Yeah.  Where.  At your birthday party)  Good show, amazing stunts, gorgeous music and costume.  During the intermission I felt like I was a little bit frozen out by Megan.  An effect she has on people around her in her quest to be the center of all attention.  Nevertheless we parted cordially.  Back to my house to christen the pipe.  Ed showed up, and ordered from Dominoes.  I get the typical annoyance I get from Ed, listening (more like evesdropping on his and Mark's conversation when I'm in the same room) to his typically over-the-top stories that sounded like typical Ed lies.  It was around this point when Mark pointed out that my pipe, with it's long nect and deep bowl, looked like a cock.   Unfortunately, it does, with its average ball-sack and anatomically correct bulbous head.  They laughed and named it Dick, I pleaded it down to Richard, then Nixon, but was unable to extend the name association even further from the painful truth.  My pipe is named Nixon and looks like a cock.  I can't exactly take comfort in the fact that hey, at least it's not a crook.  Ed's Dominoe ordering was disastrous.  I was in a foul mood and didn't think twice yelling and pointing out that he's fucking it up.  He didn't appreciate it obviously.  That started a chain of negative vibe that carried well into our 3-handed hold'em game, in which Ed tried to cheat and steal chips multiple times.  Everything ended bitterly at around 2:30am.  I believe in omens.  I believe that my observation and interpretation on omens bring out unconscious decisions that I wish to make.  Yesterday may have been an omen, telling me not to smoke anymore.

      a decorating philosophy: balancing the elements, or in other words: fung shui.  fire: light water: food, kitchen, bathroom and so on.  another story idea: CINDERELLA! that's like a steal of a steal of a steal of a steal.  ME steaing THE STORY OF THAT KID IN BASEBALL cap and no other identifiable information besides that he hangs out with the asian kid who stole THE EXERCISE OF STEVEN ripped out of the TEXT BOOK whose idea was to write on a STOLEN STORY ALA CINDERELLA.  sorry about the caps.  but this cinderella will be a much darkers tale.  Cinderella being the ultimate bitch who clowns and queens her step-mother and sisters because they can only get at her inheritance once she turns 18 par her father's wish, who had a great lawyer.  The prince would be the filthy rich oil shaw who's dying to marry her with prenup.  maybe not handsome but rich.  what would the fairie grandma be?  yes, a fairie grandma who likes a grandaughter. maybe.  she would have to be really really evil and turn the ending upside down and you're gonna have to think of it.  Hence the challege.  The story's title: Cinderella and her lawyer.  another idea: finding a writing buddy.  freewrite buddy.  BLOG BUDDY!

      alright.  an idea: start broadcast your profile, you ready for this? to the entire world.  maybe to those who speak say Japanese.  here's another: start categorizing your thought bubble pop-ups.  ideas for future ideas; self-analysis; further categorizing of ideas, etc.  here's another: get a digital photo when?  probably soon in order to start working on your website, the one that you haven't paid for in order to get started.  another: convert digital photos to easily readable bmps?  for website texture?  maybe?  and yet: write like a rock star.  dishing your decaying mental garbage at the masses.  fucking dump on them.  still: that was some dark shit.  continuing another.  continuing another still.  another of another, another squared, another cubed, another to the infinity of stupid, plus 2, another another in sight.  (perhaps a working metaphor for kids in one-up's man conversation?)  another still, and yet another boom boom boom.  wait, another?: a drill for writing rhythmically.  i guess writing poetically.  or, more straightforward: write some goddamm poetry!  the previous another another one-upmanships can be used as the backbone of a poem.

       a meandering expository  (written from the first person point of view) on WHY FAQ IS A PRETTY FUCKED UP IDEA? (alright, more like the beginning of an interesting topic for a little exercise of argumentative/analytic/research essay, perhaps like multiple-personality disorder)  (or perhaps, an caution:EXTREMELY nerdy intro to that psychology chick in riverside.  I wonder this online dating thing doesn't work?  no one replies back.  there's something i'm doing seriously wrong here.  Well maybe I need to alternate the voice a little bit.  think hard.)  suddenly getting the urge to erase that line.  this is sad jeffff.  it's just a little spark for more crazy ideas.  (here's another crazy idea: a expository/confessional/rap song title: alright, i like to dominate)  takes a pause to evaluate my dancing habit.  Every so often, I would estimate about twice a month, I get the tendancy to break it down and boogie.  Alright, I admit it, some of it, some plus a little more of it, some where some time all added together from beginning till end plus somex3 of it are substance induced.  However, what's more notable though is the will that's behind the act (act of substance+act of boogieing on downtown charlie brown)  That was much more drown out that what was intended.  Okay, getting back onto the topic--my dancing habit.  Here's a FAQ, the best format of expository writing I can think of.  why do you like to dance? it's pretty simple: it's fun.  Word associate dance and what do you come up with quick now set go!  Fun.  That's mine.  okay, what do you get out of dance (aha, got you there)? (this is some pretty fucked up pent up dude! it's like self-psychoanalysis) for one, stretching.  It's like what's it called type of work out.  Using your own strength, lifting the weight of your muscles and body.  Think about it: your body weights a lot just by itself, think of how big a stack of dumbbell is like your weight??)  no that's a awful analogy.  an.  (that was like meta-meta-editor at work).  Lifting the weight of your body plus the weight of the stacks and translate that stacks to another volumne of objects, such as another person.  okay.  I get ouf of dance is just that, it's a workout.  Plus it's a little, probably a little bit more like stretching.  it does a body good that's what i'm saying.  A little bit like the precursor to multiple personality disorder.  DAMN!  Now that I think about it, a FAQ is a pretty fucked up idea.

      is going to talk about the dreams I had last night.  Let's see.  Looking ata web page listing all the 7+ footers from China, ones that have hormone abnormalities highlighted.  There were a 9 footer and even a 10 footer who had a vaguely Mongolian name implying monstrosity (something like icy beast) but both of these were unconfirmed rumors.  There were 3 highlighted names, one of which wa Yao Ming.  Another was a 7-2 who's an academic, images flashed of him sitting behind a desk with two other men interviewing someone ala JET style.  He's the most established of the three.  The other 7-footer was a teen who hasn't mastered the sky-hook.  Stayed in a fancy hotel with one such 7 footer and 2 reporters from America (one of which is attractive).  My room was on the top floor, but the lower floor room is much bigger.  The room itself is an elevator, and while decending I saw the bay and the dock on the other side of the water briefly before the view was blocked by another skyscraper.    Unknown transition, probably woken up by the alarm.    Blamed Jack for uncovering the BBQ during the rain.  Scrubbing a wok that had a white thick greasy film over it, and the reverse side of it is orange-red rusty.  There was a housekeeper in the house who only paid attention to her baby.  The house was the house in Taipei, we're sitting on the rattan couch watching something nondescript on TV.  The refridgerator was to the right hand corner in the corner niche.  There were green-tea and fruity icecream in the freezer, and the freezer door was unattached.  What are you going to make for dinner?  Probably dumplings since you left all the pots unwashed.  But we had dumplings yesterday.

      So, Yesterday (I know, probably should've written this yesterday but such is my writing habit) was the JET interview, in Little Tokyo LA at the JACCCCCCC (can't remember how many C's, Japanese American Culture and Community Center of Commisional and Conventional Crime Critters Cringe over Cracked Crackers on the Crayon Countertop).  It was intimidating intervew style to be sure.  Big open room, at least 20 by 20, 4 people.  You in a chair with minimal back support, in the middle of the room.  3 sitting in front of you behind a line of office tables, hands domed and face hidden behind them.  Overall, I thought I had a good game plan, interesting ideas behind some of my answers, but the execution was piss poor.  I stuttered several times, at a loss for words several times, and just plain sucked.  This is all I'm going to talk about it now because anymore of this I may kill myself over the thought of the same old routine for another year.  Blah!

      starts out today with a realization of a New Yorker cartoon.  It happend just 5 minutes ago in the bathroom eventhough I have seen and not gotten the same comic for days.  A hippo dipping in the waterhole says to another hippo, "I hate her," referring to the giselle drinking from the same hole.  I get it now: a fat chick hating a skinny chick.

      How about this?  Title for your next story: "Derek and Jane get laid" Story told from two diverging perspectives, Derek's and Janes, about two people's pre-date activities and anticipatory thoughts about the sex they're about to have that night.  Ends with the two diverging characters meeting up at prearranged somewhere.  Maybe with a tougue-in-cheek tone, sarcastic yet insightful (of course from make-belief insights) about the modern day mating rituals.  Maybe written in a journal/blog format, with date and time openings for multimple short paragraphs.  Derek not masturbating since their last date.  Jane shaving her legs.  Derek picking out boxer briefs and button flies because his erection against the zipper hurts him.  Leg-man Breast-man Ass-man all like Jane.  Eating grapefruit to make his cum smell better.  Probably some description of their previous date where some make-out session was conducted.  Derek sending Jane flowers on-line with point and click(pressing ctrl-n opening a second window next to espn).  Jane's reactions to the flowers.  Jane picking out a new bracelet.  Imaginations/idealizations of what the date might be.  Heat fel under the table.  Footsie.  Derek thinking that the bracelet looks like a cock-ring.  These and other plot elements.

      can suck it.  Yet another Valentines day had passed.  I intentionally avoided blogging during the day so I can chill the bitterness down a notch.  Looks like it hadn't helped.  I'll be alright.  Was hoping to blog or Word a story during the day today but never got to it.  Made the beef tendon/oxtail broth this afternoon, which I've been intending to do for days.  I'd like to call the broth subtle but really it's just bland.  Got lots of it though, I forsee lots of noodle soups in your future.    Oh yeah, don't let this one slide.  Mark broke chubby last night.  I never really christined that blue glass pipe with a name did I?  I suppose chubbs will do now that it's no more.  Was less upset than I ought to be, considering that I've had the same pipe for 5, almost 6 years.  Was bought the summer of 99 in Long Beach with Santa Cruz Paul from CALPERG.  Like a little kid, 6 years.  Damn.  Now I'm pissed.  Spent a couple of hours working on the match.com profile and sent out a few winks.  Should harvest the results this weekend and send out a few initiative emails.  Will it work?  It better.  What else?  Not much.

      was held hostage tonight at english 104.  presented my story to the class tonight.  feeble feeback at best, everyone was non-involved.  supremely dissappointed.  well, part of it is based on selfish reasoning to be sure, i was dissapointed that no one wanted to give more compliment on all the one-liners that i threw out and sucking me for it, but i guess that's life.    i sure hope for more of a bang, i thought that i would be the star for tonight, but i guess the star turned into a quasar, endlessly remitting radioactive signals that no one picks up other than the lucky dorks at conservatories.  too bad there aren't more lucky dorks around in this lonely world.  what should be my next story?  huh?  what do you think?  the previous iwamoto-san idea seemed promising. time is present for the unvealing of promising leads.  until the wind and dust are no more, and dry sandy tomes obliterated to make way for the concrete jungle.  cliche jungle housing automatic DNA carriers and their timeless biological mission to obliterate all that stands in its way.  avocado: ripe clean green dripping with vegetable fat trendy ladies at the expenses of sweaty mexican fathers and mothers. nectar: mandarin orange nectarine orangatane swinging from twine to twine to the next.  nectar of life is the succulent juiice that feeds us all.  somewhere in there is the source. superman: invincible flying creature.  speed bump obstructing and tall-building obliterating, gas-guzzling superhero of america. USB drive: fast connect pulling ends of strings together on a dime of zeroes and ones.

      takes a back seat when money is concerned.  and where are you going to get that dough?  hustlin' and bustin' on the go, shootin' pool is the way to go.  finished in the money tonight.  in the fourth, got my $7 entrance fee back.  not much i know, but it's the best finish i've ever had on kelly mccue's monday nights.  well, you finished ahead of kirk, that's for sure (footnote: kirk is the plaid shirt donning, short shorts wearin', playin' pool in the morning hustlin' poker at night jack ass that everyone appears to agree)  finished behind vick (the stoic asian middle-ager, likes combo shots, doesn't say much and doesn't play with much flair, but leaves his game on the table, lost 4-1) and richard (the avuncular white middle-ager with a beard, full of annoying after-shot one-liners, will miss shots on purpose to give you some leeway if he sees fit, lost 3-1).  a solid 4th place if i've ever had one considering that vick and dick were fighting for 2nd and 3rd place when i took off.  doug (the coordinator of the tournament, seems to be a nice enough guy, claims to have a son in uc hastings law school, somehow dubious ((prejudicial to the extreme on my part)) considering the omnipresent brown bag at his side) seems to think that i should beat richard handily.  i dunno, richard gives me weight to be sure.  at least doug gave me some easy 'caps on some earlier matches.  biatch, make way for fast cho.

      is not quite there yet.  remind self to think of another title tomorrow in order to stimulate writing, like a mental stimulant.  mental but not psychotic.    idea for a character, a guy who makes combover an art.  that's why it's cool to live in the city, the richness of it.  you'd see a guy who makes combover an art like every other 2.5 hours.  idea for a story, write an episode of cowboy bebop.  the richness of it, coffee beany smell of beatles in the morning.  that was a good one, i think.  you're letting your mental editor affect your writing, wirte with inspiration and grandeur, write with style and flows with instant coffee efficiency.  editor: your piece is good, you have talent, but there's no story?  that sounds nice to me actually.  the book definitely wrote with an intent to inspire potential writers.  1:56 AM.  the drousy smell is intimidating.  it is too daunting a task to partake.  too drowsy and out of control of your mental stream, mental stream that threatens to pick up spead and ocercome this instant mind0fuck attemp to mind fuck.  what a load of shit.  who says habit need be pretty?

He's an artist, the top of his head his canvas, needle thin strands of hair his art.

Mr. Iwamoto is a tireless employee.  Always first in and last to leave.  I know, I've been leaving last for the entire eight months I was here until Iwamoto-sa took the lead in January.

      I give Memories four stars.  However, if I could rate each of the three vignettes separately, I would single out Cannon Fodder with five.  The first short, Magnetic Rose, is a pretty straightforward ghost story in space.  Directed by Koji Morimoto (Animatrix: Beyond), it is perhaps the most feature-film-like of the three.  With all of its visual flair and futuristic melodrama this piece is perhaps the most accessible to Otomo fans from Akira…however, in my opinion the least noteworthy, mainly because it relies too much on the special effects and out-dated CG to carry the story.  Stink Bomb is a slapstick comedy about a man with an accidental gas problem.  Its humor depends not on the typical exaggerated anime humor (think Slayers, urgh) but on the ludicrousness of the situation.  If you are familiar with the political tension between Japan and US you could in fact view this as a political satire: all the fuss and finger-pointing and power-jostling between Japanese and American parties over what else, a cloud of stench.  In terms of graphics, Cannon Fodder is the most stylistic of the three—it looks European rather than anime.  An art -buff friend of mine pointed out that the style of Cannon Fodder is very reminiscent of German Expressionism, as for me the style resembles the children’s book Where The Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak.  All the characters have grotesque features without looking grotesque, which humanizes them and make them look silly and pitiful at the same time.  The premise about a day in the life of a city that’s built around firing immense cannon balls at imaginary enemies has anti-war allegory written all over it.  A great anime short in a collection of top-notch anime shorts.   Yes indeed we are all on the path to sal-VATION!.  Surely this knowledge cannot be denied.  There’s no need to alla-analize.  Oh my god I’m treading on thin ice here—your politically correct brain portion speaking of the mis-spelling.  If, perchance, even so very slightly for a nanosecond of the emotionally content insert here.  What I was saying was this: if you're PC complex also has activated from the first three sentences of this paragraph, then you're missing the point.  The Southern Baptist's way of celebrating their faith is somehow, at some level, sacriligious, the mere mentioning of this very idea mentioned thusly, is in fact sacriligious in itself.  If meanings can be distilled from the symbolic meaning of   Sometimes, if you think about it, the only reason to enter academia, medicine, law, or otherwise equally or surpassingly esteemed professions, is to have colleagues around, collegue as in "I am about to meet my collegue." "That's depressing." "That's why I didn't want to do it." "Oh.  So what are you doing?" "Nothing.   Living in constant fear of the moment when having colleagues might not sound so bad to me."   - tribute to clerks

      Dad and Mom flew in Friday.  My free reign over the house was finally over.  Plan tomorrow?  Wake up before 10am.  Work on Japanese homework, I think.  Go to class, come home, do the writing class reading and then play some pool.  Had a dream last night that I was reading the acceptance letter to JET.  I like that feeling that everything was alright.  Can't really imagine the alternative.

      Popped in Before Sunrise two hours ago.  Just came back home, back from getting a pack of American Spirits after the movie. It reminded me of Heidi, and the way I was a little boy in love.  I had always viewed Heidi as a full grown woman, even when we were both fifteen.  She was that personal angel for me, telling me that everything is going to be alright.  Which was probably the reason why I haven't spoken to her in half a year.  Partly because I did not want to be the one who always calls, partly because I didn't want to share how depressed and sick of being with myself twenty-four hours a day, but really it was because every time we talk, she makes me feel like a little boy.  I don't want to be a twenty-four-years-old little boy.  Mark finally asked Christy from writing class for her number.  Even though he acted like he wasn't sure about the whole thing, deep down both of us knew that this time it'll work out for him.  Didn't want to tell him how alone that makes me feel, as his hetero lifemate, probably the only other functionally virginal twenty-four-years-old in this land.

       This time, it really was quite a few days   Rented ESPN Basketball Friday morning.  I didn't get a good feeling with it the first few times I've played, but now I think it is way superior than the NBA Live series.  The movements of the players feel more real, and the gameplay has the pace of a real NBA game and you have to move the ball and use the players and really play good basketball in a NBA way in order to win.  Got a call from Ed Friday morning for a house poker game in Balboa.  Between the call and the eventual game was more ESPN baksetball.  Drove to Ed's place round 8 and we're off to Balboa.  The conversation in the car felt good.  Let's see.  There was Dan, the sixty-something landlord; Isa, the resident; Ed and I, and that fat Hispanic/Asian dude whose name I can't remember.  I lost $90 in that game.  True, I played badly, $60 out of $90 was mostly money tossed in after bad money when I should've folded.  The $20 buy-in Ed said was (minimum) which I did not know.  The ante (what!? ante in hold'em?  oh but it was dealer's choice) was $1 every hand and the price was probably why I played on tilt, that and the unfamiliar games (like baseball, in which I lost hands with four 8's and another with four queens showing).  It's a lesson then, for future reference.    It was good to hang out with Ed regardless.  I think the easy pleasantry was mutual.  The many cigarettes and beers probably had something to do with it.  And then, of course, came Saturday morning, when Stanford lost to Bama!?  Somehow someway I knew that the Cardinal wouldn't make good on their media-hyped promises.    That, combined with the bad poker beats and the completion of the nug and the Saturday night ESPN basketball all-nighter were definitely an omen for another beginning if I've ever had one.  A bloody Sunday followed by a new Monday.  Also finished American Gods tonight.  Gave ideas for new stories and urge to scrap old ones.  I don't think the Dick/Dawn story was very good.  The characters were too shallow.  Although I did intend them to be shallow gender stereotypes now I think that rather hurts the irony of the point.  I liked the Black Crow girl in American Gods.  Maybe I can use her in the pool story.  gravity can definitely use some idealism.

       March Madness began today   And I was right in front of the TV to witness the tip-off...if I had woken up in time.  Caught the second half of the MD/UTEP game in which MD squeaked by.  Syracuse played well against BYU, which I tought would be a 5/12 upset.  It certainly looked that way in the first half.  BYU was just posting-up and back-dooring and 3-balling Syracuse's 2-3 zone to death.  Speaking of March Madness, I declined to fill out a bracket this year.  Ironically it was a decision made half out of laziness and half out of unwillingness to procrastinate.  I really ought to begin doing something productive.  Like filling out the NOVA application, study for GRE, story writing, meditating, or working on my jump-shot, 2-rail follow, or 12-bar blues.  Funny how the latter 3 activities made it in to  the WORK category!  Man I been slipping.

      Relapse stops today.  That's what I decided.  On selection Sunday.  It seems that I have this tendency to plan my life around parallel events outside.  Yes you can definitely say that.  Guess you oughtta look for omens where you can't find answers.  The muse to the way I dance: Bill Cosby.  The kind of woman that attracts me: the teasy kind.  This is shaping up to a confession.  Two nights ago (I had meant to write this down) I had this dream.  Dreamt that I was climbing a wet gray hill in rain, wearing shiny neon yellow jacket much like the kind traffic cops wear, climbing on my bike.  Not the gasoline kind, the glucose-consuming ATP-making man-powered kind.  Which was the problem, the hill was getting tougher and tougher.  Every little bump on the road felt like gigantic mountains on their own, I was unable to keep my steering straight to get into a rhythm and the top seemed like so far away.  In real life as opposed to in dreams, this sort of feeling of dispair would never grip me the way it is gripping me right now--which tipped me off that this was a dream and, once you realize that you're in a dream without waking up, the state of what, or where, or when you are is what, where, or when we call a Lucent Dream.  I became the all-powerful being of that little realm.  I am physics, I am cause-and-effect, I am the all-sayer of what is to be and what is not.  And in that instant my man-powered bike turned into a Yamaha chopper (even in that realm I'm not the harley kind of guy).  And I chopped my way ahead and above and joined these other harley kind of guys.  One of Whom told me that it's going to be alright, referring to the vertical drop up 1/300th of a second ahead.  A vertical drop that will get you screaming and white-knuckling the safety bars on roller coasters.  I look down and it's the same piece of Yamaha chopper, suddenly seem less potent and safe.  The harley-guy says, it's gonna be alright.  And it was, the most absolutely amazing near-flying experiences I've ever had since that time I floated 3 inches above the geometric ground (until I had the sense to dissolve the ground and thus my one and only full-blown flying dream experience).  Sounds kind of like a dream that is sexually stemmed.  But then again, isn't everything?  I do treat this blog thing a little too indiscretely.  But then again it's the kind of stories I would like to tell someone if they listened anyway, so what's the worry?

       I don't fucking believe it   Second busted tire in what, like 3 weeks?  Last time got my tire fixed I went to, uh, Venice with Mark.  That was, let me check, 2/28.  Yeah, about a week and a half.  I don't fucking believe it.  Mark's grandma died and the funeral is Wednesday and he's gone for 10 days until next (not this coming) sunday.  raishuu no nichiyoobi.    Tonight talked to the ex-goth couple of girls in writing class.  in fact, talked to them INSTEAD of half of the class.  Mark better do something about the cop's daughter before it's too late.  Last night I lost to Annie?  Alice that was her name, the Asian almost-grandma.  Had to give her a game plus call 7, couldn't pull it out in the end.  Smart play though, percisely the kind of smart play Doug gave pointers about before the match.  8 was hanging by the pocket and I had a long kick at the four.  Potted the 8 and conceded the ball in hand, still comboed the 8 in regardless, that ASian garndma did.  I don't fucking believe it.  I don't fucking believe it, that seemed to be the motto of the day.  Show'em my motto!

       Tomorrow's Memory   5.5 in 72.  That's the ratio of the amount of hours slep versus the amount of hours awake for the past three days.  Mark came by Thursday and we played NBA2K3 until 3am.  After which I was unable to get to sleep, and ended up playing the damn game till the next day.  I figured, since my biorhythm is out of wack, it might as well be time to buckle down and set it straight.  Then Friday night Eric and Mark and Ed came over to play 4 handed poker.  It was a good game: $10 entry fee, split $30/$10 between the last two finishers.  Eric went out first on like the 3rd hand, I busted him with an ace high flush against a queen high (ridiculous hand, 3 clubs showing, Eric, Ed, AND myself all had flushes).  Can't remember precisely how Ed went out, I don't think it was me, but I did remember taking a big chunk of it on one of Ed's big bluffs.  I had nothing but the absolutely lowest pair on board which I made on the turn, and Ed betted big, looked me up challengingly but over-sold the bluff with a raised eyebrow.  I caught it and called immediately and it turned out to be right.  I don't think Ed's play had been on tilt since that one.  I had a commanding lead against Mark (come to think of it, maybe I did bust Ed too) but he made it respectable by winning a couple of big hands.  Then he went all in: I had a pair of sixes, the flop came 2 and 3 and king, 6 on the turn, ace on the river.  I had 3 6s and because Mark didn't bet aggressively after the flop (my mistake: I should have considered the straight possibility) I call and lost my 3 6s and all but maybe 20-30 chips to his straight.  Went all in immediately later with a queen 2, mark called with a queen 3 but I caught a 2 on the river.  Won another huge pot by pairing a 4 on the river (bluffed with nothing, betting big every round, Mark played the hand perfectly with a king high).  Last hand: drew king jack suited, raised on the blind and Mark limped in, flop comes some connected suit and a king.  Mark went all in and I called: he had an open ended straight and a two card flush draw.  One flush card came on the turn but the other didn't on the river, neither did the card that made the straight.  Jeff Cho is the winner of $30!  And I went to bed at around 1:30am.  And woke up at 7am the next morning, hearing my phone blowing up downstairs and Shit it must be Eric who's calling me to wake my ass up to go snowboarding.  Up, at his house at 7:40.  Left at 8.  Came back around 7pm.  It was fun, snowboarding was, but I'm too tired and sunburnt and sleepy and because everything right now appears to me like unlived Tomoroow's memory I must go to bed now and sleep forever and ever and snore the roof off.

       Weekend in SF  did not happen until 6pm Saturday night, when I decided to make the 6 hour drive right after the phone call with the mates.  I figured, the idea will seem less impulsive and less stupid the closer I get to SF.  The party rocked.  Evan was right when he said that it seemed like everyone came determined to get wasted.  I showed up and so many people were already so slushed I couldn't really carry on conversation of any sort with anybody...until I caught up.  Talked with Mimi briefly, more on that later when Parth returns my email.  Tried to pass out in Kayvon's room when he stumbled in with that girl whom I met at Bohemia last time in SF.  They probably didn't realize that Ryan and I were there...and I just pounced on top of the sheets with them underneath (as a joke, but in retrospect, probably not so funny).  Can't remember a thing after that.  Remember vaguely of walking down 16th Ave barefooted lamenting (perhaps even tearing) about something or other (probably about not hooking up, as usual).  Apparently I jumped onto the couch with Chris (O'steen's roommate in Austin) and kicked him out of the couch sometime in the AM...  Apparently Jon tucked me in at around 8am.  I blacked out for that long!?  Had a funny feeling that I blacked out solely as a self-defense mechanism, defending myself from unpleasant self-loathing.  I suppose it's better this way?

       Story idea : Stuck down in Century City.  And no one gives a pity.  In the reflected glam of West Hollywood, we glanced up at the half-full moon and wondered how our all-out big-night out had turned out.  Down, in the drank-too-much smoke-too-much clan in Century City.  Many characters can be combined from ridiculous night with Kayvon Parth Ben Dave Karr Jeff Cho and What's his name?  The faux Adrian.  I hope he never gets to read this.  Allen, that's who he was, and probably still is.  Ridiculous night, as Pennawitz so graciously pointed out.  Sometimes I wonder if portions of my personality are built in direct result of "Jeff Cho" being such a caricaturistic arrangement of a caricacture's name?  Occasionaly grammar must be sacrificed in the eye of the Greater Truth (capitalization in place strictly for the enhancement of hoky-poky neo-new-age spiritualism).  I hereby adhere to that rule.  You have to write thinking a few sentenceses ahead, the direct result of such bullshit is not considered good writing.  Of course such relapses have been tolerated up to this point, the indirect result of chemical inbalances in such said person's circulatory system.  The indirect result of withdrawing to a distance from the main skirmish is vagueness.  That is what I seek, vagueness in the shadow of intentions and will.  4 handed poker followed by Happy Hour Thursday at D&B's followed by more 4 than 3 than 2 handed poker which Mark won against Ed.  Eric first out I soon followed.  Damn it.  Me:6Ko Mark:AA Flop 44X(lower than 10)rainbow.  CheckCheck.  Turn:K.  Me 10 Mark Call.  River:6.  Mark: All in I call.  Lost it all.  Mark then annhilated Ed's $2.50 re-buy-in, Ed had one 2x-up against the superior stack but could not survive the second one.  One great win though:  I turned a gut-shot straight and than doubled-up against Ed.

      Is it possible, just possible, that there is an actual, fundamentally-sound-basketball reason behind the linkage of basketball and baggy shorts?  Maybe ballers started wearin' it because baggy shorts disguise the movement of their knees, thereby increasing the unpredictability of their movements?  She captured me, not in the lubby-dubby sense, but in a predatory (sort of) way.  "sort of way" really dampens the conviction and power of the prose, note to self.

       There are 2  types of people in this world.  1, people who talk in order to hear themselves.  2, people who talk in order for other people to hear.  Which one of these are you?  For some reason the idea sounded so much better in my head than on this screen.  Poker tournament (12-13 man I think) at Saddleback Mike's friend's house.  I think his name is Romi, there was also P.O. (I thought and still suspect that people called him peel; Mike commented that P.O. is dumb as bricks, been at Saddleback for 5 years), Devan (that guy who kept getting pocket pairs and played like he's embarassed that he's winning) including Balus' brother Chucky (actually pronounced in a way that's somewhere between Chucky and Checky, the guy with the hair).  It was Mike who bought me out for 2/3 initial position and then immediately lost everything to Ed (rivered trip 2's against poket trip kings on the flop).  Ed did pretty well for himself, all the way to second place.  Class today.  Kept saying the wrong things to Nancy.  Good going.

      Isn't it interesting that an Indian named Wood Burning is so different from a white man named Woody Burns?  Intersting quote from the short story "Some Other Me" by Brian Hodge: "I've said it before, but it bears repeating: It's only in our fears and dreams that anyone truly comes to know the real anyone else.  In that spirit I can say I knew Mr. Cavanaugh better than anyone, but because he feared death.  Often, the things we've been and things we've done leave a burden inside us, and when death becomes as real as an old friend planning a visit, we dream of more days to pay for the past a little at a time instead of all at once." Great method of transition between different sections of a story.

       Yet another  make-up entry.  Another 3 handed game with Ed and Mark.  Same $5 deal.  Ed lost $10 because he had one more buy-in and Mark and I split his share 1:2 according to chip standing.  It was around 4am when we called it quits.  Couldn't sleep afterward.  300 jump-shots and a tepid shower later I fell asleep.  Until 2pm.  Damn.  Surfed webwise, little ceasar for lunch, played NBA baller.  Alright one-one baller-building game.    Watched movies with Mark and Susan.  A shaolin monk documentry and another music/spoken word/images movie.  Forgot the tiltle, must find out because it's a keeper.  Was there sexual tension between me and Mark's cousin or am I imagining things under the w?

       3 handed freak  played 3 handed poker w/ Eric and Ed, same deal, $5 buy-in tournament style, with the marked $5 from Ed (4/15) at stake.  Eric took both of us to school.  Final hand: eric 10/J, me 9/9.  Double raised before the flop, flopped 10/J/J.  All in from me, and Eric could not have called it faster.  Who would've thought he flopped a boat?  Thought I could push him out with an all-in but in retrospect should've thought again.  3 more hands with Ed after Eric took off.  $2 buy-in heads up.  Ed took the first 2, I made the last one double or nothing and won.  Even for the night, except the $5 to Eric.  Gotta get back to normal tomorrow.  Some Japanese and GRE studying.

       Skipped Classes  and went to the Newport film festival instead.  Saw a movie called "Fossil" a semi-mocumentry about an anthropologist disappearing in the Congo while searching for a mythical beast.  Innovative story-telling technique, but pretty boring I must say.  Saw a couple more short films but none of them rose above the cheesiness factor.  Overall a pretty forgettable experience.  Although the brochure promised a handful of intriguing films.  Drank beer and had dinner at Kelly McCues with Mark while watching the 4th quarter of the Spurs/Grizzlies game.  A rout, not much to talk about.   Returned home and drank some more beers with Mark for the Lakers/Rockets game.  Ed showed up at halftime.  More beers and some more non-game-related conversations.  Lakers won but I felt like I wasn't even part of the game due to the Edwardian distractions.  He wanted to play cards.  Nobody else did.  Yo, Kathy Come wrote me back!  Kathy Come came!

       Tournament play  Played in a hold'em tournament in Westwood last night.  Ed knew this kid Balus (sp?) who used to hang out with my cousin Fred.  I don't know how they did it but they managed to find and cram a field of 32 into 2 bedroom apartment.  4 tables, $25 buy-in, 5 boxes of 400 clay chips.  My first poker tournament.  Mostly current or recently graduated college kids.  Quality players, exciting pots, good fun all around.  There's this one pot where I limped in pre-flop with 3/4 suited, and by 4th street I made my belly-buster straight but with 3 low clubs on board.  There was only one other kid in with me, the chip leader at the time, and I made a slightly less than pot-sized bet of 200, hoping just to get called and not lose huge to a flush, he came over the top for another 500.  My instinct told me that if he had a flush draw on the flop he would've raised, which he didn't.  Took me a long time to call it, which I eventually did.  Imagine his disappointment when he flipped over trip 9's against my straight.  That pot put me in the lead for the first table.  Before we left the table I wanted to make a big score, and the same situation arised against Balus' brother Craig.  I bluffed with an open ended straight draw on 4th street, representing a flush with 3 clubs on board.  He took his time, talked and asked me this and asked me this and that, trying to pick up something, which I think should have been illegal.  Well I wasn't sure if he picked up something from my attempted poker face or just felt like gambling, but he went all-in over the top and I folded my straight draw.  He had Q/J suited.  Had to hand it to him.   Well that beat put me in an extremely short stack against an extremely huge one at the next table.  Went all in on several occasions without doubling up, but stole enough blind to keep myself afloat.  The entire night I had to play a lot of small connectors, one of which I went all in on (2/3 suited), had the chip leader folded his A/J suited just before I showed him my bluff.  Nice.  Earned respect all around the table, couple that with a nicely slow-played big slicks, I thought I was starting to pick up some steam.  Then I caught pocket queens.  Raised the big blind, the Asian kid from first table, a sucker whom I have been pushing around all night, just called.  The flop came ace 10 8, no flush possibilites.  I was on the button, and he checked.  At this point I didn't think he had an ace and I feel like leaning on him was the best play (I also needed to double up in the worst way) since I didn't think he had the aces, at most a straight draw.  He called.  OH shit.    Whew, I was right.  He had  a pair of 10's against my queens.  He also had the kings, so he has a 6/45 chance of beating me, pretty good odds for doubling up.  Then of course, he caught the other 10 on 4th street.  Fuck.  10th place out of 32, not bad for a first tournament.  Still, getting outdrawn after playing my hand and reading his hand correctly hurts bad.  Now I know how Phil Helmuth feels after being outdrawn by that Vietnamese guy Toto.

       The two-headed monster  namely, Friday night and it's day-older-cousin Saturday night.  Friday night, drove up to LA for club ridiculous, as pennawitz coined on the celly conversation.  Well, coined does not mean automatic participation.  Pennawitz backed out and so did Mark, so yours truly drove up to LA all by himself.  The hotel Grafton on Sunset, where the SF crew stayed, was ridiculous.  The old Tercel was valetted alongside beamers and merce'des by valets with black bowties and red vests..  Can't exactly shake the feeling that I was stucking out in the glorious West Hollywood like a $200 manicure sore thumb, until I entered the front door and saw o'steen and ballen, checking in.  Later in their room came kayvon and allen (not to be confused with ballen).  After a few rounds of quick showers and shirt ironing and the exchange of load losers and snake charmers, the foursome were off.  Subsequently arrived at the White Lotus, where osteen instantly remarked that he has previously visited the club with a different name, with evan in a prievious summer.  Waited in line and was greeted by a faux-sean connery who promptly ushered us inside the dinner area.  In the entrance I somehow reflexively pulled out my ID to the doorman.  How embarassing.    Bar first, greets all around, karr, parth, ben, allen, osteen, kayvon, and me all got reacquainted.  At the dinner table, where osteen had pork tenderloin and ben had tuna and i had curry noodle and i think allen also had the tuna, no, parth had the tuna and carr had the sushi and kayvon had what did he have?  Anyway, take a breath in between sips of heinekens and tell the waiter, "No, i insist on having what you recommended against," which was the curry noodle.  He recommended the low-mein, pronouncing it not LAO but LOW.  Somehow could not parley that rationale to the rest of the group.  The collective energy dropped.  My bad.  Ballen's virtuoso attempt at energy-raising was drowned by allen's loudness of speech.  Dinner gulfed down and got a few curry drops on my beautiful shirt.   To the VIP room, where liquor flows and rabbits dance to bacchic songs.  A bottle of absolute mixed with orange juice, cranberry juice, and the remains of our sobriety.  Out onto the dancefloor.  Hot.  LA hot.  No other description, no need for elaboration.  Hard pickup, hollywood is hard, or else heidi fliess wouldn't have been an icon.  Therefore, no need to discuss the attempts.  But the effort was there, as a voluntary wingman for left-over girls.  Sometimes, night clubs has that special something to bring the worst out of men, who thinks the best of women, who are worse than worst.  Oh yeah, the stage is for girls only (asked the security guy about it and felt again, embarrassed and outclassed for asking.  I simply ain't a high-roller and enjoys secret pleasure being the complete opposite), this will come into account later.  The drinks ran dry and were unable to enjoy the club further, or otherwise known as being sick of hiding the quiet desperation.  Cigs with osteen, bought beers for kayvon at the bar, under hetero circumstances: the bartender simply wouldn't serve him on account of him "being crazy."  Never found out why exactly.  Dancing dancing dancing smoking pissing eyeing dancing closer and then further away, gamelessly.    Next club was, as osteen puts it bluntly, techno.  Filled with Rave kids on or off.  Would've liked to stay, but group decided otherwise.  Decided on another club (Titled Trance Club in grotesque flourorecent blue) which was the same.  Back to the hotel, some horsing around (excluding parth, who took no part of the horsing, who we lost contact earlier, regained contact at last laying face-down in the aisle) and then took farewell to the crew.  Home and bed by 4.5am.  I think.  Then there's the second head saturday night.  Woke up, slightly hung-over, received cell phone calls from Mark and Pennawitz on the cross road betwen the two heads.  Then eric, wanting to work-out.  dropped the car off at Ayres hotel and shook ben wyler's hand and got back into eric's car who decided that he couldn't get me into 24hr fitness so we ran at Soka instead.  Failed to do the 71 push-up in 2 minutes.  Probably could do the 200 sit-ups in how long?  No poblem doing the 10 minute 1.5 mile.  Ran 4 400s and a two mile.  Also need to work on that.  Came home, watched as nets and pacers and san antonio blowing out, and eric came by, watched poker till mark and ed showed up.  My car wasn't there, got shotgun in the red civic the whole way up.  Nice.  Balus (sp?) lives in west wood.  Real tournament with real clay chips.  Nice.  Drew same table as Ed.  Actually, should recount the poker story later.

       Misadventures  and quite-a-night.   Woke up, blah blah went to Danny K's tournament.  Drew Bruce, this European-looking guy who's an A player.  Again, with my 3A a 9-7 race.  Final score: 6:7.  Had trouble recalling the score somehow.  Was it really 6:7?  I know I had more than 5 (I know I had a red counter) and he had 9 with the 2 spotted.  Right.  Final score 6:7.  Could've played better, but let's be honest: I really wanted/needed to leave.  Played this Asian guy Howard (B) and talked with Kammy (sp?), THE Asian girl of the tournament.  Who's also from Taiwan (until 6yo), lived in Diamond Bar, can speak pretty good Mandarin, has a boyfriend.  Will take into account.  Picked up Jon, met up with Mark and Susan and Ed and went to Soka.  Got high around the dark bend, proceeded to an episode of social awkwardness.  It was a clash of universe: clashes of universe are never good, take George for example.  Ka-Boom.  There's gotta be a clown in every gathering, I suppose since I knew everyone I gotta be the clown tonight.  Came back home, awkward goodbyes and half-hearted farewells, followed by heads-up poker with Ed. (this was round 11.5pm, no, gotta be at least 12.5)  For a couple of hours of entertainment Ed pays me $5.  Not a bad deal.  Actually, it was an especially good deal, the deck was like hot coal, every hand I played I had a hand.  Raped him thoroughlly.  Winning or had him flding virtually every hand (I had lots of small blind blacks from Ed).  Good prep for this Saturday.  The inebriated interaction was good prep for tomorrow.  Good prep overall capped by some sleep which must happen now.

       Dreamt  Worked in a bike shop in the mall, located near the entrance.  Brought my bike in for fixings, put on some unidentified but bulky bike part on the handle bar, then hopped on and rode it down the hall for a test drive.  A bright orange mountain bike with black handlebar much resembling my first Giant circa 5th or 6th grade.  Rode no more than 30 feet before the mall cop stopped me and wanted me to pay a $30 ticket for riding the bike in the mall.  Tried to get out of paying by apologizing, he didn't have pen nor paper and couldn't really write up a ticket, instead he expected me to pay him right then and there--what corruption!  Upon realizing that this is a dream (in between alarm snoozes), I rewinded the dream.  Spat in the mall cop's face, "Make me," and rode back to the shop.

       Another poor showing at KellyMcQue's   Only 6 people showed up so we played round robin, 5 games total against everybody.  Won 3 against Lou, 2 against Vic, 2 against Alice, 2 against Jim, and just one against Brian.  Awful effort.  Was so frustrated by the time I played Brian I literally threw my cue when he made the 9 on the break (felt awful about the poor sportsmanship, but could only amend that by a "nice shot" comment when he comboed the 9 on the next rack).  Could it be the beer?  Or the lack thereof?  Only drank 1 at the beginning of the night.  Sober pool didn't seem to be my game, which is a problem.

       What a pathetic weekend   Let's see.  Friday: nothing.  Watched Bubblegum Crisis 4+5 and that's about it.  Saturday: nothing.  Played ball with a bunch of HUGE highschoolers, dinner at Black Angus with mom, and that's about it.  Sunday: nothing.  Lakers/Kings morning, balled with Fred and his buddies, tried unsuccessfully to get a poker game together but did some Japanese homework instead, and that's about it.  I did learn how to do the 10chip shuffle though!  Productiveness indeed.  (only 6-8 shuffle lefty)

       Precision bombing?   Visited the doctor's office today for the JET physical.  The typical stuff, weight, height, blood pressure, vision, x-ray, and urine sample--WHAT?  I didn't know urine test was on the menu.  That got me worried.  So on my way out, I pulled the doctor aside, "Excuse me, but what do you test the urine sample for?" "Um mostly protein analysis." "Well, I'm asking because, uh, I just came back from Amsterdam 3 weeks ago..." "Oh," pause, "we can't really get any white blood cells out of urine..." Confused.  Wait a minute... "Oh that's not what I meant.  You know marijuana is also legal in Amsterdam..."  So, I have the doctor's assurance now that it's not used for drug testing.  Whew.  He also looked at my x-ray and commented on how big my heart was.  Yup, I literally have big heart.  A big heart that didn't come in play last night at Danny K's.  Played this Asian man in 40's with glasses named Jim.  He was an A player, against my 3A (since I'm new to the tournament: didn't really think I could be triple A) comes out to a 7-9 race.  He missed at least four or five shots on the 9-ball and gave me those games, and it ended up hill-hill when I wasn't even playing at my best.  It was probably due to the fact that 1) the reluctance to stay at triple A and 2) I felt sorry for him for giving me all these games.  The killer instinct just wasn't there, so naturally I lost the hill-hill game.  Afterwards I complained to Wayne that Jim was off-stroke and I shouldn't really stay at 3A, his response "WTF, you never played against him in your life!"  Good point.  Lesson learned: never underestimate your abilities and don't let your pity for your opponent diminish your thirst for their blood.

       Future JETtison   Heard back from JET last night: I'm in.  So the next step would be signing up for GRE and begin grad school considerations, among other things.  Somehow I'm not as excited about it as I thought I would be.  For the past few months I've been living on the empty promise of JET and the possibility of arriving at that cross-road.  Been living on a constant state of hope.  Now that the promise is fulfilled, somehow the feeling of emptiness continues.  Now that I'm at that cross-road, I still feel a little bit lost as to how to take that next step.  I suppose it's better this way.  Because nothing has really changed as to how my life is shaping up...yet.  Skipped Japanese class today and played at Danny K's.  Practiced for about an hour and half, then prompted the old man at the next table (well, okay, old middle-aged man) to play.  His name's Danny, as in Danny K, as in the person who puts the Danny K in Danny K's Billiards.  Awesome shooter, in maybe 6 games broke and ran out 3 times.  Friendly chatter, plus introduction to a few other shooters: Wayne, who runs the tournament, and Tom, some guy with a brown leather double case.  Dropped the line that I might play in the tournament Thursday, think I will.

       A dissapointing NCAA Tournament  ended tonight with Conneticut dominating GTech.  The Yellowjackets had heart, but didn't have enough baskets.  What a jip.  No buzzer beaters or even highlight-worthy upsets in the first two rounds except for Stanford.  Georgia Tech, a 3rd seed, became the cinderella because the media couldn't find a neat storyline over this bore of a March.  Beware, the bore of March.

       Dreamt: Vacuum   Dreamt that I was visiting Pennawitz, and went out jogging with his brother (although in the dream, he doesn't look like either of his brothers in real life, but rather Easter European).  For some reason I had to drag this vacuum machine with me up and down hills on the jog.  Along the way I ran into all these colorfully incoordinated and supposedly hip-dressed teenagers to whom I apologized for getting in their way.  Jon's brother was way ahead of me and by the time I got back he was already in the shower.  Jon's house looked like grandma's in Taipei, and his mom seemed to be rolling dough and making Chinese dumplings.  All these teenagers were in the house too and it was strange to see them back there.  I asked Pennawitz who these kids were, and he said, hush-hushedly, that they were at least ten years older than me and looked like teenagers only because of some hormone defficiency.

Harmless in today's standards.  Dad will be leaving tomorrow.  Had dinner at Wei's tonight.  Szechwan at its best.  Balled at Eastwing in the afternoon after the Lakers' game.  Played well I think, until that last game.  Need to work on ball-handling and shooting off the dribble.

       The waiting game  ceased to be fun about 2 months ago.  Every day I dread the arrival of the JET result.  What if I don't get in?  People ask me.  I don't know.  I tell them.  I just don't know.  I suppose first things first, re-apply to NOVA, sign up (and study rigorously) for GRE.  That's about all I can think of.    Will there be a poker game tonight?  When all else fails, there's nothing like losing your bleeding money if you're lookiing for a pick-you-up.  I've been looking for the pick-you-up in all the wrong places.  Pool, poker, TV, video games, alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, Saddlebac, IVC, an occasional book.  When will the downward spiral stop?

       I was  at the supermarket picking up some beer. And there he was, in the produce section, Jesus.  "So...long time no see." he turned and saw me, then spoke hesitantly and awkwardly fondles the zucchini in his basket with his long, persistant fingers.  "Yeah." I couldn't look him in the eyes. I never could, even during the most divine of all our nights together.  "How are you doing?" Jesus hesitated before speaking to fast.  "Fine, fine. Thanks. You?"  "I'm doing okay." Long pause.  "It's been like, 3 months." he said, with much care.  "Yeah. 3 months already." I replied.  "You still seeing that red-headed boy?"  "No, we broke up a month ago."  Jesus' halo suddenly lit up, bright as a Broadway spotlight.

       Where's my poker?   Just finished reading "Wittgenstein's Poker" by David Edmonds and John Eidinow.  I have to say that, as I expected, the philosophy in this book is rather less than the tip of the iceberg.  Popper's falsification principle and Wittgenstein's philosophy (unfortunately I did not do very well in Phil 60 and was never adequately acquainted with the Luciferian genius of Wittgenstein) were briefed and glanced over.  Although the book sheds interesting light on the petty fights over grand struggles that face philosophers of the time.  Wittgenstein thought philosophy as the task of clarifying linguistic ambiguities and puzzles, while Popper thought that philosophy dealt with real problems with real world ramifications.  It was perhaps a product of their times that they both felt that, to support their respective views, it does not suffice to be merely eloquant, sharp, intelligent, and insightful, but also murderously passionate.  Which makes me wonder: does philosophy arouse this kind of passion within me?  Does it need to in order for me to justify taking the path of an academic philosopher?

       Dead at Party  Account at PartyPoker depleted.  From 64 to zero in God knows how many seconds.  Well, it didn't take long to be on the short-end of two all-in's.  AJo against 55, caught the 3rd 5 on the flop.  AQo against TT, caught a 4 flush on board (the only non-flush card was an ace, strictly poetic/aethestic moral points).  What can I say?  Prior, came home from Mark's birthday party with 3 NBALive victories and a headful of weed at 3am.  Perhaps all of the above depleted my good karma, sobriety and common sense to be gambling at 4am.  Still prior, cell conversation/proposition with Nancy.  Yes, it did sound too much like a proposition now I think of it.  "Hi, how are you doing?" "I was wondering what your plans are next week," "I'd like to take you out sometime," "Take you out, yes, as in interest..." "Oh that's too bad."  There was further valiant but ultimately vain persistence.  For moral points only.    She did ask if I'm still going to her birthday party this weekend though.  Moral points with a slightly larger multiplier in the decimals.  Sigh.

       Sth Worth Writing   Ed just took me in our poker game this week.  Mark is still in, but unless Ed does something dramatically stupid with his huge stack he'll probably win.  He did call some of my shots though.  I give him props, but he's starting to get on my nerves with all the shit talking he's filling up my dining room with.  Til next time, Edward Blues.  The BBQ at Mark's house yesterday was fun, despite being slightly hung over, still drank my way from 2 through 10.  Brian, Brian's boyfriend Will, Kate, Taps, Eric, Eric's friend/ex/girlfriend/just-whats-her-status Phong (sp?), Mark, Ed, Megan, Erica and Ian, Jack and Di, the Latins were all there.  Good lamb, couldn't try the ribs though.  By nightfall I was so tired I watched Adaptation instead of socializing.  The movie, as well as all the couples at the party made me slightly depressed and wanting to call Nancy.  Oh, by the way, started playing $25 no limit at Party.  After much ups and downs arrived at $65.

       Japanese Party   Okay, the party was preceeded by some meaningful work, which makes it even more worthwhile, in a way.  Let's see.  GRE on Thursday.  1450.  800 math, 650 verbal.  High enough score to be sure but still on the lower range of expectation.  However, isn't it funny that 1450 is the exact score of my SAT?  Who says that these standardized tests aren't accurate measurament of your innate ability?  Also received my assignment on JET.  Nakayama, a town of pop. 5096.  I don't really know what to say about this.  More on future entries.  Today, or rather, tonight, attended the Japanese dinner and the belated birthday party at Gabe's house.  Ryoko brought her friend Ryoko and the gender ratio was as Gabe promised.  Although the different groups of people stayed within their different groups, the party was actually a lot of fun.  Much flirting with Gretchin, some more with Joy, which must have inspired some jealousy with Nancy, which in turn must have resulted in some positive points and a further date during her birthday next Friday.  Score!  One more drunken date with Nancy is all I'm asking for at this point.  And this time I have the upper hand.  Sweet.  Sunset room, I think.

       Dreamt: underwater, surrounded by feeding frenzy   Literally millions of hagfish feeding simultaneously on the ocean bottom, their snake-like bodies undulating furiously against whatever it is that they were feeding on, not unlikely ones of their own.  There were also these orange looking worm like critters amongst the opaque hagfish.  For some reason they do not notice that I am among them, but it still scares the shit out of me.  The entire dream was carried out like a slide presentation, with captions.  Very strange presentation format for a dream.    Among the slides there was also this strange object that I called the Oculis in the dream.  It was like a giant open-ended cocoon, a giant, uh, sea sponge.  With spikes, numerous spikes like baby rhino horns covering every inch of its body, inside AND out.  Just as strange as the slide-like dream presentation, I made a mental note to myself that I would look up this Oculis thing on the Internet when I wake up, and I did, during the dream.  I found out that this Oculis thing is not natural at all but man-made, some sort of underwater instrument.  It was either hiding in the claustrophobically horned space inside the Oculis or standing exposed outside among the hungry hungry hagfish.  I chose inside.  Inside the Oculis, every echoe can be heard (an unlikely event underwater I know) and is somehow tuned.  Every spike, when lightly rubbed, made its own tone.  Further slide/internet search showed footage of actual musicians playing inside the oculis on stage.  There was probably a story in there somewhere.  Just prior to the next dream, had a dream that I read this reader's digest article about a husband's reaction to his wife geting some sort of STD.  He couldn't figure out from where she could've gotten it and that really damaged the relationship.  Then he figured it out as she was holding up the baby just before its diaper change.  The baby's dirty diaper, with all its shit and urine, was rubbing against her pussy the whole time.  Ah, mystery of the STD solved.  And then they lived happily every after.  Note: the wife was raven haired and fair skinned and extremely beautiful, kisses very slowly, C-cups that bounce during coital.  There was probably a story in there somewhere too.  Definitely in this one.  The last dream near morning which killed my erection.  At the long sandy beach.  Wyler complained that there weren't any waves.  I looked and could see a swell encroaching in the far horizon, and developed into an enormous 20 foot semi-tsunami.  "That wave could kill us," and it could, the way it broke right above the sadbar.  As the waves crashed, I notice that a sandy protrusion was among the white wash: a beached whale.  It was covered in sand and gasped for air.  We approached cautiously, twice jumping back as it bellowed.  Then it was quiet, real quiet.  I noticed that the tsumani brought a couple of fishing boats stuck in the piles of sand behind the whale.  We got closer.  Zoom, out from above the beached whale came this gleaming white 70's Mercedes, with an unidentified driver.  We got rea close.  Now, for some reason the whale really doesn't look like a whale anymore, but rather like an unopened pupa.  Its mouth started to wiggle in an aorganic manner and we ran back.  The lips of the whale/pupa opened and spit out a giant snake.  The giant snake wriggled on the sand and stood up, taking the form of a velociraptor.  Then the velociraptor extended its wings and jumped up into the air, sand and water and reflected sun trickling down its leathery gray skin.  We ran.  We ran and hid in this beach condo, but the dragon followed right after us.  It kept poking its head here and there and breathing really hard when we looked for ways to escape.  It started talking, sounding like a teenage skateboarder...  Idea for continuation and development of further story: how about that the dragon ages from baby ga ga to old man wisdom and then finally death in less than a hour (progression demonstrated through dialog).

       Dreamt:  played waterpolo in the ocean with beach volleyball players (some appeared to be professional, I could've sworn that Sinjin Smith was in the water), using articles of clothing or beach gear as balls.  For some reason I swam faster than anybody else out there and was a monster in the water through many cherrypicking scores.  It was great.  There was another dream after but was unfortunately forgotten.

       Train of thought #39   Is Kayvon a cynic or an idealist?  #40 Great conversation between Mark and Eric tonight at D&B: do you, as a principle of life, make the best out of your lot or push the boundary of your ability?  Eric is obviously a deciple of the former, but is that the best approach as a life philosophy?  Personally, I'd rather die as a unfulfilled idealist that lives just a tad beyond my comfort zone, knowing that I had dug in and sucked it up and pushed it.  #41 Smoking in front of my house, with every throat clearing, a rabbit (or perhaps a person whom I was unable to see without my glasses) pushed a glass bottle around.  This happened at least 3 times, it's like there's a telekenetic connection between us.  #42 Studied with my Japanese study group.  Went shopping with Mitsuro at Urban Outfitters.  Jarrel brought his hookah and Gabe brought his friend Gretchin to the Japanese restaurant while I watched the last minutes of the Lakers/Spur game.  Somehow I don't think that I have a good shot with Nancy.  But I still have a few more shots left.  #43 Roth IRA is a better option than 401K.  Hands dow.

       New Beginning   Interesting.  Before I began this blog entry, I was going to write about my moment of epiphany, a new beginning.  Funny how it coincided with the revamped blogger site.  Made BBQ dinner as a mother's day gift.  Argument with Mark over the phone about my story.    Followed up by a half-concealed apology phonecall.  Did some GRE work.  Watched Tokyo Godfather.  Smoked my last American Spirit.  Threw away the rest of the pack and the secret toy.  Tomorrow will be another day.  A brand new day with a new perspective.

       Real Money #2  played until 7am last night.  Bankroll now at $112.  Not bad for two night's work.  Speaking of poker, played last night with Ed, Taps, Mark and Eric.  Won again.  I am unstoppable.  Until tonight.  Out in less than 20 minutes against Ed, Mark and Taps.  KJo against QQ.  I raised, Mark re-raised, I re-re-raised before the flop.  Flop came A34 rainbow.  I bet, Mark calls.  Rivered 5, I went all in.  Mark called.  What was he thinking!?  Calling with QQ with an ace on the flop!?  I tried to maintain my poker face after the all in bet, come to think of it, that was probably a dead giveaway that I was bluffing.  Dammit.

       Real Money  played 50/1 tonight.  My first venture into real money.  Doubled up to $50.  Really soft games where people will pay off your nut-flushes with top pairs.  Bankroll now at ~$75.

      Writing class today.  Reviewed 6 stories.  All average and nothing interesting as usual.  The collective depth of the class is severely lacking.  Have a great first line for my story (stolen from Professor Adventure): Due to some quirky glitch in the space-time continuum, I have literally forgotten more than I've ever known.  Nothing else though.  Perhaps the story of a unaware time-traveller and his mis-adventures in an ironic tone.  Perhaps not.  Maybe the story of a faux-clerks video store clerk and his friendhsip with a crazy homeless guy, interspersed with all the idiosyncracies of video store clients.  Throw in the guy who makes combover an artform.

       Ocean's 11  went to the Oceanside casino with Mark last night and played 3 hours of 1/2 hold'em from 9 to 12.  Bought in for 50, rebought 10 and left with $39.50.  Mark was way up, at least doubled-up.  Won 3 hands all night: pocket queens with queen on flop, over KK; pair of jacks on river, 3rd highest pair; and somehow, somehow, a huge pot (30+ dollars) with an ace high.  Don't ask me.  Played basketball Saturday.  Result: 2cm laceration just below and to the left of left eyebrow and 7 jagged stiches.  It's tough to play a game in which your face is on the level with everybody else's elbows.  On the bright side, with the inevitable scar I may have finally found the elusive street cred.  Holla.  Lakers lost to Spurs, without HDTV.  Apparently ABC doesn't broadcast NBA playoffs in HD.  Those bastards.  I can't believe that baseball gets HDed and not NBA playoffs.  I feel like I don't know about this world that I live in anymore.

       Joke  How does Michael Jackson pick his nose?  From a catalog.  Nothing new really.  Wolves and Heat both won.  Lakers/Spurs Sunday noon at Mark's house with his new Hi-Def TV.  Eric's in Vegas, again.  Still without an idea for the story.

      Plus 10 against Mark and Ed tonight.  Played 4 tournaments, won two and lost two.  Can't remember the details, don't really want to.  I gave action with some questionable calls, but got some back in return, that was it.  Ed claimed to have caught one of my tells and he was right, I was doing it: J9o with J top pair on flop and another J on river.  I leaned in as if to bet on flop but checked it instead.  That was an obvious tell for sure, but I also use it as a subtly obvious sucker bluff (which I used to have Mark lay down his pocket queens with a pair of 6's, on AK6 flop).  Either way, must be careful from now on.  I did notice a few things about Ed's play though.  He puts a bigger emphasis on winning pots rather than winning chips.  Overall I think he definitely wins more often than either me or Mark, but the amount of chips he leaks speaks for itself (tonight: Me 2 Mark 2 Ed 0, I think, or no more than 1).  He loves to show his bluffs but hates being bluffed, even when he doesn't have the cards (note to self: definitely show him a bluff next time and see what happens).  Raises preflop do nothing to limit the possible hands that he might have (once called my raise, slightly less than 3x big blind, with Q6o and flopped two pairs).  I would estimate that he bluffs, or make dubious semi-bluffs(like calling it down or even raising with 3rd button) at least 40% of the time.  There's no way to read Ed's hand.  Tonight, once I stopped even trying to guess what he had and just played my hand straight, chips just roll downhill.  Also saw Triplets of Belleville afterwards.  Watched it a little bit stoned, a definite treat.

      Just saw Michael Moore's Farenheit 9/11.  I think the subject of 9/11 and the war in Iraq deserves to be treated with some objectivity.  Michael Moore trivializes the issues through his sensationalism and propaganda.  I think it is unfortunate that, the Michael Moore brand of "documentary" will not convince but rather alienate the unconverted.  It is also unfortunate that from this point on, more serious attempts at making a film on this subject will inevitably be tainted by comparison.  It is ironic that in 911F Michael Moore employs the same spin and buzz tactic used by the very politicians whom he mocks.  He lingers on and emphasizes, over loudspeakers, facts that support his point of view, and stuffs the opposing points and arguments into the locked closet.  Although this kind of fighting poison with poison is a statement in itself, I don't think it is suitable for someone like Moore, who prefers to perch on moral high ground.    Iraq was definitely not a free and innocent nation prior to the invasion.  Though no evidence of WMD was found, evidence for plans of WMD procurement were in abundance.  Whether or not Iraq were a direct threat to America, there was no question Saddam is a war criminal and a mass murderer.  Bush may end up as war cirminal and mass murderer also, but at least he's a maybe, taking out a sure thing.  As for the accusation of brainwashing the country into war, I have no doubt that there is some, probably a lot of, truth in that.  But, anyone who has read the art of war, or anyone who has some semblance of common sense, knows that to wage war successfully you must not have desention among your ranks.  Democracy and full disclosure takes a backseat in war unless you want to risk defeat--which, as bad as war is, is even worse.  It is right to question the motives for starting war and the manipulations that got us there, but attacking the methods and the efforts is nothing but distasteful and disrespectful.  As questionable as this whole war business is, once started I think it demands our unconditional support.  Doing otherwise is just blatant disrepect to the lives of the soldiers in the fields.  Do you want to be the one to tell those risking their lives that they've been fooled?  Just flat out distasteful.  Take two soldiers, one who has seen 911F and another who hasn't, and immediately put them into the battlefield.  Which one do you think is more likely to die?

      Amy Portello: she appeared mostly hesitant when speaking with me, which ironically made me think very highly of her person.  Very delicate Hispanic facial features with a strongly guarded smile.  The denfensive type.  Wore one of those pointy but square-toed heels that appeared to be on the small side, relative to the toes.  Not having romantic/sexual fantasies yet, which is probably good considering our proximity and future involvement.    Brian (sp?): ex-JET from Tottori-shi.  Very informative and enthusiastic about the region.  Strongly self-deprecating behavior, with "chagrin" being the operative word behind every gesture, including the ever-present smile of slight embarassment.  Natural or acquired from his 3 years in Tottori?  Perhaps a little bit of both.  Brandon: Jet from AZ going to the prefecture to the immediate west of Tottori--which according to Brian is extremely close to Yonago.  Studied Japanese in college, been to Japan previously, green eyes, a pretty-boy/geek otaku hybrid.  Good conversationist, was able to respond even when I brought up the subject of Japanese monkeys and Benobos.  Acquired email, valuable future contact due to geographic proximity.  Zeph: either he really knows his philosophy faculty all around the country, or is the epitome of name-droppers.  Made me feel underprepared/underresearched about grad school, which is a great quality in a potential future collegue.  Acquired contact as well, although unnecessarily, purely for gesturing purposes.    Mike: his hair is dyed blue.  Which, along with horibbly disaligned teeth, I failed to notice from our previously D&B engagement.  Taught English at Prague previously, has TOEFSL or something like that, some ESL teaching credential.  A bore mostly during conversation, which is unfortunate because of all the hot girls that he has clung himself to, whom I would like to as well.  Mina: the Nepalian/Japanese girl with nose stud.  Stll very hot.  Major points scored against me for remembering my name and my tax questions during orientation.  Major points given up against her for not remembering her name and the mis-interpreted Lost in Translation comment(she was commenting about the Japanese director scene, I responded thinking that she was referring to the director commentary in DVD).  Changed her clothes while we waited outside of the Civic, giving me goosebumps even in the afternoon LA sun.  Nevertheless I hope future encounters will result in positive pointage.  Nicole: Mina's friend.  Also UCLA grad.  Cute despite too much makeup.  Derives her charm mostly from the valley girl/air head stereotype.  I caught her rolling her eyes when I apologetically asked for her and Mina's name.  Was not at all friendly towards me, which  doesn't deviate from my previous D&B impression.  Angel: would she ever just shut the fuck up?  Guilty of abusing and overusing "y'all."  Stopped being a fresh presence about 5 minutes in.  Girl sitting next to me: I also wish that she would shut the fuck up.  Probably a cute girl of mixed Asian/white ethnicity.  I wouldn't really know because she talked to her neighbor throughout the session and had her back against me almost just as often.  Off the corner of my eye I think I saw her checking if I was checking her out behind her back--which I did not specifically to not give her the satisfaction--what a bitch.  I stereotyped her immediately as the overly appearance conscious type based on her fashionably see-through top and one of those fasionably billowy skirts, which, though looking good, made her ironically unattractive to my eyes.  The stereotype was justified: her first question to the pannel, the first one of the day, was this "So, are there like places to shop in Japan?" (directly quoted without )  What a bitch.  Serra: of Osaka was sitting behind me, though I did not talk to her at all.  She wouldn't stop talking though.  Previously attributed Lucy Liu eyes.  Now add Lucy Liu voice to the list, which unlike the first, is not a complement.  Sophia: a woman ex-JET in 30's.  Was on pannel of living conditions and community involvement.  Sarcastic to the extreme, which is unfitting considering that she is a yoga instructor.  Very touchy-feely, not in a bad way.  Immediately engaged me in a passive-aggressive discussion on the ethics of animal use in medical research, upon finding out that I was a biology major.  Probably one of those new-age activist freaks that I've been trying to disassociate from.  Who else?  Yumi: the tallish Asian girl with spunky shortish hair.  I found her attractive, despite(perhaps because of) her acne scars.  Paid for both of the Kirin pitchers at Little Tokyo, but didn't get a chance to talk to her too much.  If I had to find a reason to go to the Corona Del Mar BBQ tomorrow, she would be it.  Lives in San Pedro.  Michelle: the previously met blond bosomy girl.  Chunky, well-tanned body.  Wide-eyed outgoing.  Unfortunately nothing else registered.  Heidi: returned my call to tell me that she had made plans to hang out with her Dad.  I was not pleased, obviously.  But even more enraging is when I told her that it's okay, because I'm feeling pretty tired anyway, in a half-truth kind of way to give both myself and her an out, she took it and ran with it unapologetically.  It felt like I was the one apologizing for her making other plans, even though I had told her about being in LA a week ago.  Sure, one can make a point of me bringing this onto myself by not contacting her until the orientation is over at 4pm, but still.  Eric: was crusing on a 500 hp car in Westwood when I called.  Dang.  Jen: bespactacled girl with red acne on nose tip, going to that city on the tip of the same penisula of where Yonago is located.  Very friendly, ostentatiously dorky, I like her.  That girl from Hiroshima-shi: pretty ex-JET from Hiroshima-shi.  The car-ride back home: talked to myself on my painfully bloated bladder.  A case for talking to yourself: A)it is good to talk to yourself in order to hear yourself; B)it is extremely rude to talk to others in order just to hear yourself; so C)the only person whom you can talk to yourself in order to hear yourself is yourself (besides extremely understanding friends, which are less readily available).  Matt: the guy whom I directed my car questions towards.  Sort of a Gideon Yago (MTV news correspondent) look-alike.  God I hate these pretty-boy types.  Although you can't beat them, can't exactly join them either.  I can't believe I just said that.  Bento-box: okay food.  I like to think that everyone around me were secretly impressed about how thoroughly and neatly I cleaned up the whole box with my superb chopsticking.  That guy who sat next to Brandon at lunch: a history major from Berkeley.  Also hailing from the dorky/otaku region.  We hit it off immediately with the Berkeley/Stanford thing though neither one of us followed it up with more.      That girl from the mock-classroom panel: the hottest girl I've seen in a long time, despite the semi-buckteeth.  It is possible that she appeared extra engaging precisely because of the bleached semi-buckteeth, which gave the appearance of constant smile.  Though she's obviously aware of her hotness (you can tell these things, by the body language or voice intonation indicative of conscious display/dispense of cuteness, usually a turn-off), it did little to detract from the fact she is hot.  It pleased me to the extreme when the wanna-be hot girl to my left commented on her cuteness.  I detected a trace amount of reluctance in that comment, making it sounding almost like an admissal.  Just couldn't shake that assholy (asshole-ly, not ass-holy)/pissy attitude the whole day, due more to last night's lack of sleep (~3.5 hours after playing spade with dadmomjack) than more permament causes like inherent personality, I swear.

But I will get a chance to meet you >after I arrive right?  Perhaps we can talk about it >more then. > >cho ------  and here's her uncharacteristically quick (within 3 hours) reply:  ------ Hey Jeff,  Honestly...clearly it seems you are not comfortable with buying my car.  Let's just let it go - I'll sell it to some one around here. I don't  know the history of cars around here, the re-sale value ect. I'm not  that concerned with it - I just know that I bought the car for over 2  grand and I'm selling it for 1500 - I'm really sorry if this doesn't  suit you. I was totally willing to take it in payments ect., feel like  I've been pretty cool about it.  But, it would probably be best for you to just get here, look around  and buy that rice rocket that you have always dreamed of - I think it  would make you happier in the end. Just ask Nishiyama-sensei for help,  he'll be great at getting things set up for you.  I won't be here when you arrive, we all have to be out of the  apartments before you get here. But when your year is over, and if you  find yourself back in CA, I would love to meet up.  -Melissa ------  Think she's being a bit blunt, and maybe a bit put off.  Although I could've used more tact, I don't think I'm being unfair by calling her car overpriced.  So she paid 23 man for the car with 2 years of shakken.  A year passed and few more kilometers later, she's selling me the car for 16 man, minus precisely 7 man for a year worth of shakken that she used up.  Does she seriously think that she's doing me a favor by passing the car onto me for 16, costing her nothing more than 7 man for a year's use of the car, and expect me to probably lose more than 10 man when I leave Japan and probably having to junk the car?    In the words of the immortal Rory Breaker: "Just remember: if the milk turns out to be sour, I ain't the kind of pussy to drink it."

      Negative $30 at Eric's friend's poker game.  3 SnG tourneys for $10 each.  Lost all three.  Busted out first one by Issac, him 7's on the turn (caught chasing a nut flush) against my pocket 4's.  Second one A3 suited, at short stack, raised pre-flop, flop missed everthing but nevertheless went all-in against second button, who called.  Third one...can't remember the third one.  It was just as bad I'm sure.  I better start keeping track of non PTY poker expenses as well.  My team against Mark tonight: Camby, KMart, LOdem, Rashard Lewis, DMiles, Ginobili, Rip, MBibby, Bender, Baker.  Could've had Brent Barry instead of Rashard, a better ball-handler,  better defender, just as many icons, but 3 points under.  Even during the game before I said that I've never used Rashard well, and still I made the CPU-initialized trade.  Naturally, the lack of a backup pointguard (which Brent, not Rashard, would be able to fulfill) and no other ball-handler outside of Bibby and Odom led to my downfall.

         Having watched 11 discs of Saiyuki, believe me when I say that you will be properly disappointed after the first 4 or 5, when the series start to autopilot on empty steam and all the initial novelty will have worn out.  In the beginning, I too was intrigued by the Chinese folk lore remake and the many lofty reviews about the interesting characters.  Although all of the characters have generic shounen mannerisms and generic shounen personal baggages that give them generic shounen depth, the dynamics between the characters were nevertheless interesting and fresh in the beginning.  Part of the freshness is due to the decidedly modern characters set in an anachronistic ancient China, part due to the borderline homoerotic take on friendship and comradery, part due to the cheap but clean and refreshing animation style.  The cheapness needs to be emphasized, as one previous review blew the art quality of Saiyuki way out of proportion.  Contrary to what had been said, Saiyuki not only is full of “one-trick pony CG” (ex. all the demons die precisely the same way, identical action sequences) but it also overuses a lot of very cheesy-looking visual effects (frozen and overlaid still-shots of character faces during “deep” dialogs, much like the style of old-school console RPG; cropped screen to give the “dramatic” look of wide screen; jamming several different shots in the same screen to create a comic book effect, etc).  While the cheesiness can be tolerated, or even appreciated as stylish in the beginning, it gets old pretty fast.  Furthermore, the story dwells on a lot of misplaced melodrama that often goes over the viewer’s head.  During many episodes I’ve watched, I got absolutely nothing out of a certain character’s death or another’s loss that was surely intended to be an emotional experience.  Other times the growth of characters are limited to the “I must get stronger so I can defeat so and so” variety.  Two stars.

      Why behead?  Why not dehead, or unhead?  Other words with the prefix be-: bejewel-put the jewel "on"; bespectacle-with the spetacle "on"; befriend-to become friend, put "on" friendliness; beguile-to put "on" guile; befool, belittle, bewitch, bespeak, and so on.  Notice the emphasis of on, against, around, over, to, that the be- prefix adds to the stem word.  None of them uses be- as "off" or "away" or "without."  Perhaps the verb "to behead" was originally applied to the beheader, who is adding another head "onto" his collection.  No?

      Finally, my first winning sessions on PTY since 6/12.  During both sessions, hit-and-run tactics were employed: left immediately after a winning hand.  Better to win small than lose big.  Another reason being that both were pretty lucky hands involving 6's.  The first one I had A8o, flopped 862.  Turned another 6 and was check-raised.  Somehow called my winning two-pair to the end.  The second one I had 76 of clubs in my first hand in, raised ahead of me and for no particular reason decided to call.  Flopped 683, two spades.  Again the bet was raised ahead of me and again somehow decided to call.  Turned the 3rd 6 and luckily no one made the flush on the rivered spade.

         This is the fortune that Dad picked out for me from the Guan Di Temple in Taipei.  The main section, a 4-line poem, means thusly:  Clothing and meal will be readily available, So there's no need to worry and fret, If you should observe your filial piety (xiao), loyalty (jung), and trust (shin), Luck and prosperity will come and woes and tragedy will not encroach.  Sounds good!  Some other details were mentioned:  A fortune of medium luck.  Fame and prosperity will find its time.  Too early for either pregnancy or marriage.  Illness can be cured.  It is better to adhere to regular routines.  No need to worry.  Seek the middle and straightforward way and you will find balance between the two extremes.  By forcing the way accidental trouble will incur.  Follow intuition and common sense and it'll be all good.  One catch: this fortune was obtained in November 2002, in the middle of my first bout of unemployment after college.  Well, I suppose THAT still applies.

      During losing streak (heretofore referred to as L, ~400 hands in 6.5 hours), saw 2% more flop than during winning streak, (hitherto referred to as W, ~1200 hands in 22 hours), and raised 2% less pre-flop.  36% to 34%, 5% to 7%.  Effects of blind defense/steal negligible due to small volume (nevertheless, during W stole 5 times as often).  Although showdown percentage similiar (L 28% W 30%), winning percentage drastically different (L 31% W 56%).  Perhaps due to the high winning percentage W also won more without showdown (W 26% L 18%).  Question: which is atypical, 30% or 50%?  PF aggression factor [(raise%+bet%)/call%, >1.5 aggressive   F aggression factor: W 1.25 L 1.45 (notable: L also folded 5% more often, despite being more aggressive)  T aggression factor: W 2.11 L 1.1.  Question: could this be the deciding factor?  R aggression factor: W 2.32 L .84.    Total aggression factor: W .9 L .63.  After pre-flop raise: W went to showdown and win more often than L after pfr, 51% to 45%, 56% to 45%.  Flop bet won without showdown: W 63% L 35%.  Turn bet won without showdown: W 25% L 33%.  During both flop and turn L also folded more often.  Obviously the winning percentage is higher for W than L, at pf, f, t and r.  Just called pre-flop: biggest difference is, obviously, winning percentage, W 55% L 22%. Not much difference in other stats.  W suprisingly also folded more often to river bet, 58% to 42% (although the folding percentages compared to total river actions are negligible, W 2.9% L 2.6%).  L folded more often on flop, 14% to 10%.  However, L folded less often on turn, 5.6% to 6.8%.  For both W and L, check-raising is virtually non-existent.  Overall, I became more of a calling station during L.  PFR less often, and despite following up PFR with flop aggression, I often discontinue the aggression during turn and river.  Whether or not this is due to differences in card quality is in question.    Additional analysis regarding card quality.  Method: created a hand filter for quality hands: AKo to A9o, AKs down to A2s, KQo to KTo, KQs to K6s, QJ, JT, T9s and 98s, all pocket pairs.  Also created a hand filter for premium hands: AKs to ATo, KQs to KTs, QJs to QJo, JTs, pairs down to 88.  Quality hand result: L 105/496 (21%), W 285/1254 (22%). Premium hand result: L 54/496 (11%), W 173/1254 (14%).    54 L premium hands: 26 pfr(48%), 25 went to showdown(46%), 20 folded(37%), 7 won at showdown(13%).  -.76 big bet per hand (for a net loss of $53.38, although this number is skewed due to the losing 1/2 sessions).  29% winning percentage (53% when bet/raise following pfr).  173 W premium hands: 86 pfr(50%), 71 went to showdown(41%), 75 folded(43%), 40 won at showdown(23%).  +.65 big bet per hand (for a $112.5 net winning).  36% winning percentage (56% when bet/raise following pfr).  105 L quality hands: 28 pfr(27%), 32 went to showdown(30%), 45 folded(43%), 9 won at showdown(9%).  -.63 big bet per hand (-$84.63 overall).  21% winning percentage.  285 W quality hands: 93 pfr(32%), 95 went to showdown(33%), 127 folded(45%), 55 won at showdown(19%).  +.41 big bet per hand (+$115.75 overall, notice that this number is not much different than premium hands, indicative of cutting it even on non-premium hands).  31% winning percentage.  Can't really figure out a way to determine whether or not the big disparity is due to play pattern or just pure dumb luck.  There's a difference in the frequency of premium hands, perhaps the reason why I played the quality hands more often and more passively and played the premium hands more stubbornly during L.  This disparity in premium hands may also be the reason why W raised more often.  Assuming that these premium and quality hands virtually play themselves and that the play pattern are for the most part consistent (which is somewhat corroborated by the numbers), I am tempted to say that it's really just pure dumb luck, at least for these monster starting hands.  Although during the losing sessions I did showdown more often and fold less often with my premiums, I still can't fault myself for paying off the river.

      During the game last night I found Ed to be especially annoying.  The game was at his place, perhaps he felt that having homecourt advantage justified being the bitch that he was.  First was a complaint about being in big blind on the first hand, which I suspected, most likely correctly, that he was simply unhappy with either his cards or his position.  Then he complained about having to play a .05/.1 game.  Then he stalled the game repeatedly because he couldn't remember the chip denomination, then he stalled even more, like a scab-picker fingering an open sore, upon discovering that the stalling really ticked me off.  Then he stalled some more by leaving the table eating the maynaise eggplant (a Hungarian dish made by his mom, which was heavy but actually quite good) and maynaise eggs (another Hungarian dish made by his mom, which was heavy and not quite good, it also gave Ed repelling egg breath), which he could've easily done at the table and keep the pace going.  When I told him, only 1/4 jokingly, to get with it or I'm gonna take his money, he felt justified to accuse me of unprovoked aggression, which naturally really pissed me off.  Ed simply ticks me off, the way he is inconsiderate about other people's patience, the way he treats each social outing as an opportunity for self-glorification, the way he plays the smug disrespectful know-it-all smartass, and the way he expects to get away with all of it, as if it is his natural right.  Ironically, these are probably some of the same reasons why I tick him off too.  The difference between Ed and I, is that I have more qualifications at being the smartass.  Which is why I especially enjoy winning money from Ed.

      The hand that ruined me tonight.  My AQs against Ed's AKs.  As the short stack and after 4 straight all-in's that earned nothing but a few SB+BB's--KK, junk, TT, AA consecutively--I find myself sitting on AQ of hearts.  Flop QXX, no straight, 2 diamonds.  All in called by Ed, with AK of diamonds.  A 7d hit on the river and I was done.  Actually, the hand that led to the short stack kamikaze was against Mark, who flopped a straight, and I thought I had flopped a straight with an inside straight-flush draw.  As it turned out, much to my chagrin, I didn't even have a straight, but somehow backdoored a low 2-pair.  Very stupid indeed, it was pretty embarassing to lose with 7's up when you thought you had 7-J straight all along.  And then, upon returning home, I followed the -$2 night (lost $5 at no-limit, won $3 at the limit game prior) with another -$10 game at PTY.  Damn.  I attempted a PTracker analysis after that, comparing the stats of my winning sessions (6/1-6/11) and my losing sessions (6/12-present).  Although I did appear to play more tentatively and more meekly during my losing sessions (on average much lower aggression factor), most of the statistics are comparable to my winning session stats (mostly within 5%).  Across the board, the statistic that showed the most disparity between sessions are the winning percentages at showdown, around 50 versus mid-20.  Perhaps my current losing streak is just that--catching a prolonged cold deck?  During the losing session, I saw slightly more flops, although I played them less aggressively and folded more often, went to showdown at about the same percentage.  Certainly I shouldn't be blamed for losing more showdowns right?  I should look more into this.

       Full tilt alert.   I must stop myself from playing poker.  Yesterday I lost all of my second $50 deposit, and on the same day put in another $100.  Today, lost another $25, bankroll down to about $78.  I am now down $125 on Party, only $75 of which is indicated by my PokerTracker record of about 1800 hands.  Looking back on PokerTracker, I don't think that I have been playing badly overall.  There were definitely spots of tilt when I made calls or raises out of frustration, but I have always been quick to stop myself and quit the session.  Perhaps the tilt factor have been carrying from session to session?  Considering that I have been up $90 in less than 2 days, perhaps this current downswing is just that, a swing.    On a sidenote, Dad arrived from Taiwan yesterday.

       However,  upon my most recent viewing of the blog, I have decided against having a title and have reverted back to boltyping the first few words.  The reason being that the Blogger template seems to be unable to put just the title in the previous post section, and that I'm just dumb enough not to know how to change this.  It's better this way, believe me.

       That strange dream  happened to me again last night.  The same one during the Monterey camping trip and the Montana road trip, both inside my one-man bivouac.  I've since had it a couple more times.  The one from which I would wake up screaming, fall back asleep, and wake up screaming again.  It happens either right before I fall asleep or just before I wake up.  In fact, it was because of it that I was unable to sleep last night, trapped and immobile between dream and wakefulness.  The moment I close my eyes, the ground beneath me would shiver and writhe, not unlike sleeping on top of one or many burrowing creatures.  Sometimes it feels like a single tunneling mole, sometimes it feels like a swarm of rats chewing through my bed, and sometimes it feels like coils of snakes slithering all around me.  The sensation is always very real in a physical, tactile way, and if I try to ignore it the sensation would invariably intensify and eventually I couldn't help but to scream myself awake, for fear of being violently swallowed up.  I would have to restrain myself from screaming, as I am usually quite conscious of my nightmaring at the time.  In fact these nightmares are quite lucid, which only adds to their terror, since at the time I have little means of escaping them.  I would try to move my body in an attempt to wake up, but due to the pre-REM state of muscular relaxation I always struggle to move even a little bit, and always end up jerking myself violently just before the terror culminates and climaxes.  I would wake up, tell myself that it wasn't real, try to go back to sleep.  Then the motion would start up again, as if the beast(s) beneath me merely paused due to my movement.  This happend at least a dozen times last night, and I yelled (wasn't quite screaming, was aware of Jack still awake and somehow made the attempt to mask the yelling with feigned annoyance, which was REALLY weird: terrified but at the same embarrased, try to hide it but nevertheless couldn't help but remain terrified) at least half dozen times.  I don't think that this had anything to do with the Lakers' defeat, however.

       My prediction.   An email I sent out 2 minutes ago.  I predict that Rick Fox and Bryan Russel will drop a combined 40 on the Pistons tonight, Shaq will make 14 straight free-throws, Payton will lead the team in rebounds, and Kobe will have 4 points, 20 assists, and no turnover.  Karl will lose his knee brace and his right shoe on a lay-up attempt, which will hit Rasheed in the eye and sideline him for the entire game.  Hamilton's mask will fog up and his blurred vision will cause him to run into a pick and breaking his nose in the 3rd quarter.    Kid Rock will spill his beer and Chauncey will trip on it, breaking his tailbone.  Luke Walton will dunk on Ben Wallace, and as a result both Walton senior and Phil Jackson will have to be escorted out by security for excessive celebration and excessive reference to John Wooden, respectively.  And in the end, they will probably still lose to the Pistons.  Which is just as well, I would never share a championship with all these fair weather band wagon fans in LA anyway.  Fuck them.  Tell them that Yankees still have a shot and their hats are on sale.  After watching all the Lakers' pre, regular, and post season games, I knew from the beginning that this was going to be a tough series, despite all these basketball gurus annointing Lakers in 5.  Somehow, recognizing all the flaw in my team makes me feel like the one true Lakers' fan in the world.  cho

       Sitting in front of my computer,  waiting for a phone call from Japan that should come any minute now.  I've hear Melissa's voice, I wonder what Honda-san sounds like.  My computer was acting up the past couple of days.  After I reformatted the hard drive on (Saturday?) and re-installed everything, found out on Monday morning that the C drive had somehow disappeared from the CMOS.  Strange.  Got a few screws from the repair department in BestBuy and screwed the laptop bottom tight and reinstalled XP and her friends.  Now I'm back on track.  I did lose about 100 hands and $25 worth of losing sessions from Party.  Compensated by deleting two winning sessions from earlier last week.  Looking at my malnurished bankroll, decided to give it another workout.  Unfortunately, bankroll lost some more weight.  Dave & Bustered it up Sunday night with JETs from socal.  Really nice folks all around.  There was Serra with Lucy Liu eyes, works at Banana Republic, smokes Parliament and who was very friendly with me (although her voice was kind of annoying); Mike with Shaq jersey and Canon S410, some chick from UCLA whom I wasn't able to strike a good conversation; another chick from UCLA, a Nepalian/Japanese with a silver stud on her left nostril--whose facial structure somehow reminded me of Buddha, but in a much hotter/exotic/sexier way--I think she intentionally ignored my attempts at S-bombing; another blonde from Pepperdine, kind of chunky body but claimed to be a great swimmer; a Hispanic girl and an Asian guy who couldn't stop talking about frats and sorrority (the girl ordered Alien secretion for shots); another Asian girl who was a pretty good pool player (mental note: somehow, in Mike's email to the forum he talked up the girl's game but neglected to acknowledge my pool skill); another girl from Loyola? who was intellectually snobby and completely blew me off.  I haven't had the chance to go out and meet new people in such a long time, my mind was so overloaded with socializing I left my credit card unclosed at the bar, which was not retrieved until this afternoon.  There will probably be another round of SoCal JET get-together.  Lakers facing elimination tonight.  Somehow, having been rooting for the Pistons all series, I feel responsible for their demise.  Not that I want the Lakers to lose, but a combination of various factors make it hard for me to root for them this year.  The passion, loyalty and respect with which Pistons play as a team is a much attractive brand of basketball than the Lakers' Devean and the fab four.  I've always held Larry Brown above and beyond Phil, whose antics are really getting on my nerves.  The manner with which everyone jumped onto the Lakers' band wagon also disgusts me as a Lakers' fan: suddenly everyone is a Lakers' fan and begin to think of themselves as basketball gurus for getting a free ride.  Even Eric proclaimed, at one point, that Lakers will win in 5.  What the fuck does he know about the Lakers?    I just can't root for my team with these jokers as my comrades-in-arms.  Strangely, having watched the Lakers all season long and throughout the playoffs, I feel that my worthiness as a Lakers' fan is validated for recognizing their flaws against the Pistons.  Everyone counted them out, but not me: not because I liked the Pistons, but because I know my Lakers.  I hope they win tonight and bring the game back to LA.  If they win the next two, it would've been history; if they get blown out at Staples Center, I am almost certain that they will be empty seats and perhaps even boos; let the world see the the true face of these wallflower Laker fans.  Fuck them.

       Chalk another one up  to the pantheon of bad beats.  AK of diamonds in 5th position, 4 callers in front.  Raised but somehow got 2 more callers behind.  AKs against 8 players, this had bad news written all over it.  Flop K and J of spades and 10 of clubs.  Bet to me, raise, only 5 callers.  Turned 9 of indiscriminate suit--what does it matter?  Bet, raised from behind, 2 callers in front, what is AKs to do but call? (the pot was over $12, justifying a $1 draw at a queen gut shot)  River 5 of spades.  The raiser bet and one more called, what is AKs to do but call?  Somehow, the preflop raise was unable to drive out Q6o and 36 of spades.  Unbelievable.  The poker hell continues and my bankroll now down to $58, only $8 above the second $50 I put in.  I shall now declare code orange on the tilt scale.

       I had just gone  to poker hell, but I'm not sure if I've made it out yet.    It all began on Friday when I registered Poker Tracker.  Friday afternoon was a great run, double tabled .5/1 all the way up to $140, ~$40 up since Thursday night.  Lost a tournament in 5th place after dinner.  Called Mark about the party at his house without a response, fiddled about, this and that, and then played my first 1/2 session.  Down 7, up 1.5, down 6, then came the big wallop of down 25.  Back to $105 for the day, 3 more dollars for 5+ hours of work.  Reformatted my hard drive Saturday, some .dll decided to stop working even after repeated cajoling and rebooting.  Put everything back together, went to Ocean's 11 with Mark and Ed.  Bought in for $50 at around 8:30, down to $8 before 11.  Bought in for $40 more and ended up at $63, down $27 for the night (I thought I was down more than that at the time but come to think of it, I didn't do that badly--a fleeting moment of breeze in poker hell).  Played a total of no more than 6 hands to the river.  Playing tight naturally is no match for the shotgun method of the players there.  Top pair with top kicker is just no good against gut-shot straights on the river.  Bastards.  The Mexican sitting to my right had no hand, literally.  He made plenty of sets and flushes but had a stub for a left hand.  On the way back we joked about how he would be perfect for a one-breasted woman.  Got back, finished installing newsbin and a couple of other things.  Drank a beer and watched some net porn, somehow the pornography turned me on to some more poker.  Just when you thought you were out, they drag you back in.  Few hours later, this is where I am.  On tilt and down to $79.  I swear, the deck had something against me.  AKs, A2s, A3s flopped 3 cards of some other suit, AKo with A on board betting into a set, QQ flopped AAK, 99 flopped 555 and caught between a raising war (A5 against AA), ace high flush beaten by a straight flush, would someone please pity le fou?  I am still mad as hell. Goddammita;sdfp987324#!25o8!@#$#*O  FUCK!

       Agnieszka  and I talked on the phone yesterday, about mostly graduate school stuff.  Can't say that I gained any additional insight through our conversation but it was beneficial nonetheless--it validated what I've already been thinking about the application process.  We also talked briefly about the De Waal the pop scientist.  Agnieszka mentioned that I had a reluctance to ask for help...which is scary insightful, considering that my parents once said that about me too.  Mark got back yesterday, and I unintentionally encouraged him to check my website and read my blog.  I don't know how I feel about people I know reading it closely.  Strange thing about this blog phenomena: you don't care about complete strangers reading it, but you feel uneasy when it is read by people whom you know and trust.  Regardless, once the site is more populated I will probably give out the address to a few whom I know anyway.  On second thought, maybe I should work on its googlability first.

       Heidi  visited me today.  Much were talked about, some serious, some lighthearted.  Nostalgia, soul-searching, bantering, hysterical tickling and silent embrace all rolled into one.  Somehow she always makes me feel that she has given me more than I have given her back--not guiltily but gratefully, in a I-can't-wipe-my-smile-off-of-my-face-hours-later kind of way.  I hate to give her advice on how to leave Earnest because I really wish she does just that and make me feel like this everyday until God knows when.  I should have told her I love her when we walked to the car.  I was afraid what that would've done so I didn't.

       In honor  of the Piston's win in Game 1, I'll copy and paste what I posted to BigDaikon a few days ago, immediately after the Pistons/Pacers series:  -------------------------------------------- Joined: 25 May 2004 Posts: 8  	 Posted: 2004-06-02 Wed 19:48:43    Post subject: 	 Alright, since I've watched almost every single playoff games so far, I'm qualified to ramble on:  First of all, I hate 90% of Lakers' fans. Especially waggon hoppers with Kobe jersey and Yankee hats. You know who you are.  But they're half of my home teams. Go Clips! We are number 2! The Ethan Hawke to Lakers' Jude Law (in Gattaca)!  The 4 HOF'er myth is complete bullshit. Sure Karl can still drop bows, but I'm gettnig sick of his chair-pulling and that first-down sign. And to be fair, even I can score here and there catching dimes from the Stockman. Since when do you see a HOF afraid to take open 17 footers? Okay, I concede: when KG's coming at ya. The way Karl slap-striped KG throughout the series reminds me of MJ stripping his ass before lauching his jumper over Russel--who's role is now reduced to a cheerleader with no tits on the Lakers' bench.  As for GP, he's more mitten than Glove now. Who's he gonna guard? Rip or Billups? And inexplicably he is still jawing and yapping like he's the shit. Frankly it's sad. Even Wally felt justified shit-talking back to GP's trash in Game 5. If the Wolves had either Cassell or Hudson healthy, this'll be the Lake show's final season.  And Kobe. I can't really talk shit, fearing anal rape. The man is unguardable on and off and in the court. But the whole media spinning the Kobe trip from CO to LA into some sort of Homerian Odyssey is just stupid. How hard can it be to get limoed and charter-jetted around? Sure the trial might be nerve-wrecking...only to your guilt-conscience.  Shaq. I love the man. f*** Kobe. Trade him for T-Mac and you get 2 more rings. Anyone who says Shaq's game is pure muscle and no skill has never touched a basketball in his life. Oliver Miller is 330 plus and I would pay a month's salary to see him jump-stop slam from the free-throw line, let alone spinning-baseline-oops. But the Yao Dynasty is coming, so Shaq better shap up.  When it comes down to it, my favorite Laker is Luke Walton. But his dad sucks.  --------------------------------------------- To add to the points made above, Larry Brown is ten times the coach+player Phil Jackson ever was.  The Pistons had trouble scoring against a team like the Pacers only because it was coached by the former Pistons coach!  Detroit has enough O to score against the Lakers and take 2-3 games from them, especially in the 2-3-2 format.  But at the end of the day, I will continue to cheer for the Pistons until Game 7.

       Politics:  when and how who gets what (according to De Waal, quoting Harrold Laswell).  No wonder it's so freaking boring.  This is just one of my insights/learnings today.  There are more.  Self-esteem in America, as a result of coffee-table self-help books and daytime TV shows, has become a goal in and of itself and increasingly disconnected from actual merit and worth.  Isn't it interesting that Eden can be scrabbled to spell Need?  Apparently aphasia patients have lost the ability to understand language.  However, they are so adept at reading non-verbal clues during communication that they are practically impossible to lie to.  An anecdote by neurologist Oliver Sacks (1985): when the presidential debate was shown at an aphasia ward, the whold room convulsed with hysterical laughter.  A parallel between philosophy and art: they are both useless.

       Interesting  insight from PokerGrub: strippers and nurses are more alike than you think.  Upon reading the previous post, I have come to the conclusion that I must've been stoned.  Laboratory results confirms that this was so.  Played 5+ hours of PartyPoker yesterday.  Ups and downs, from up $29 to the final +$18, arriving (so far close to 9 hours and 533 hands later since the arrival of PokerTracker)at about +$2 per hour.  Once I reach the 1000 hand PokerTracker free trial limit I must consider either purchasing the full software or move up in limit to take full advantage of my 2 big bets/hour stat.  Played until 6 in the morning.  In my short nap until 11am I dreamt that I won the lottery on the closed-circuit TV in a classroom.  I was congratulated and high-fived and chest-bumped by JPenn, whose oddly incongruous presence in a classroom that looked like my Taiwanese elementary school only overshadowed by the awkwardness I felt facing Lin Jung Xiao, a moody playmate in 5-6th grade, someone whom I haven't thought about, and never thought that I would ever thought about, in years.  The appearance of LJX was so jarring it woke me up, missing out on the 3 million jackpot.

       Here's an  idea for a short story.  A Jewish physicist from near future travels back in time to Biblical times.  He sought out Jesus and described the future after his death, all the countless wars and slavery carried out in his name.  Jesus subsequently turned himself in to the Romans in shame.  I think the world will be a better place if Confucius is wiped out from our memory as well.  Sure he's got a few good points, a (dictatorial) society with emphasis on justice and education can't be bad; but a family cannot be based on love and respect and harmony without intimacy.  I charge Confucius with abolishing intimacy from most of the East Asian families.  It could also be said that intimacy just takes on a different strand, a decidedly Occidental strand.  Again, as usual, I have no point.  Just needed to get this shit off my mind so I can drive the insomniac hordes out of my head.

       Visiter Q Review.     If you’re wondering what Visiter Q’s title image represents, it is a naked Japanese woman, wrapped in trash bag, being suckled by her husband, minutes after chopping and sawing the limbs of multiple corpses, whom they murdered as a gleeful family bonding.  I won’t dwell much further on the savage specifics of Visiter Q, as I’m sure all the other reviews have painted a pretty clear picture for you.  But, after watching Q, I can guarantee that, whether you love it or hate it, the emotions you felt will be extreme and the imageries will stay focused in your memory for a long, long time.  Such is Miike’s magic and vision.  Although the uneven pace of the movie felt like a soap opera or a badly cut reality TV program, it keeps the viewer clueless as to where the movie is going.  Through obviously digital lenses and cheap production, Miike (can I call you Takashi?) somehow conjured up one unforgettable cinematic experience.  And he does it again and again and yet again, like a relentless lioness tugging at your mane.  I can still remember when I watched Audition or Ichi the Killer for the first time, all the awe and bewilderment I felt.  In a way, it’s a lot like sex (in the American puritan tradition): ecstasy, shame, love, disgust, connection, insecurity, desire, doubt, longing, embarrassment, etc. all rolled up into a scorching ball of conflicting emotions and desires and stuffed into a ripping, bloated condom and then …(I’m a guy after all) it’s all flaccid and sticky and you throw it away but you don’t forget about it.  Not until the next one.  God I feel like a cigarette.   By the way, an addendum to the poker game at Dominik's.  The had that won it all, I had 3X both red (X

       Alright,  since I've watched almost every single playoff games so far, I'm qualified to ramble on:  First of all, I hate 90% of Lakers' fans. Especially waggon hoppers with Kobe jersey and Yankee hats. You know who you are.  But they're half of my home teams. Go Clips! We are number 2! The Ethan Hawke to Lakers' Jude Law (in Gattaca)!  The 4 HOF'er myth is complete bullshit. Sure Karl can still drop bows, but I'm gettnig sick of his chair-pulling and that first-down sign. And to be fair, even I can score here and there catching dimes from the Stockman. Since when do you see a HOF afraid to take open 17 footers? Okay, I concede: when KG's coming at ya. The way Karl slap-striped KG throughout the series reminds me of MJ stripping his ass before lauching his jumper over Russel--who's role is now reduced to a cheerleader with no tits on the Lakers' bench.  As for GP, he's more mitten than Glove now. Who's he gonna guard? Rip or Billups? And inexplicably he is still jawing and yapping like he's the shit. Frankly it's sad. Even Wally felt justified shit-talking back to GP's trash in Game 5. If the Wolves had either Cassell or Hudson healthy, this'll be the Lake show's final season.  And Kobe. I can't really talk shit, fearing anal rape. The man is unguardable on and off and in the court. But the whole media spinning the Kobe trip from CO to LA into some sort of Homerian Odyssey is just stupid. How hard can it be to get limoed and charter-jetted around? Sure the trial might be nerve-wrecking...only to your guilt-conscience.  Shaq. I love the man. f*** Kobe. Trade him for T-Mac and you get 2 more rings. Anyone who says Shaq's game is pure muscle and no skill has never touched a basketball in his life. Oliver Miller is 330 plus and I would pay a month's salary to see him jump-stop slam from the free-throw line, let alone spinning-baseline-oops. But the Yao Dynasty is coming, so Shaq better shap up.  When it comes down to it, my favorite Laker is Luke Walton. But his dad sucks.

       Textbook example of pot-odds.   9-10 handed hold'em at Dominik's place in Irvine last night.  Was first out in the first game, won the second.  Tallying $53 net winning for the night (lost $10 for the 1st, won $70 for the second, minus the $10 buy-in and the $3 won from the interim side game).  There were 4 hands I remembered clearly.  1 was a mistake of unawareness, 1 somewhat negative luck of the draw, 1 extremely positive luck of the draw, 1 excellent play.  Holding 89 suited.  Flopped 85? rainbow.  I bet, called by the guy with the tilted Dodger's hat.  Turned 9, making me 2-pair, bet big, called.  No flush possibility but completely unaware of the possible straight.  It turned out he made his straight on the turn and was baiting on me.  Bet big on river, double-raised, called, lost.  With the shortest of short stacks and holding A7 suited, only an orbit from the above-mentioned hand.  All-in, called by Roberto with ATo.  10 came on the turn.  First out.  Second game.  Holding KT suited, flopped K.  Bet, called.  Turned 9 of clubs, giving me a flush draw on the river with top pair and mediocre kicker.  Bet, raised all-in by Roberto.  At this point I was the big stack of the table, was winning and bluffing consistently, had the entire table's attention and I called without really even thinking.  He turned over his K9, and I really had no idea that he had two-pairs until I rivered a T, beating his two-pair.  Almost felt like apologizing.  But I didn't.  The turning point of the second game.  I was second in chips behind Dominik, which had slightly more than double my chips.  Darrin the skinny guy and the Dodger hat on my right and left respectively.  Dealt AA in big blind.  Dodger hat folds, Dominik calls, Darrin calls, I raised doubling the blind.  Domink calls, Darrin folds.  Flopped two spades and something else, all below T.  Bet 10 (blind was 3-6 I think), Dominik raised 30.  There were about 80 in the pot, and I had slightly less than double that.  Dominik throughout the night had gotten on many people's nerves by calling all-in's with nothing more than flush and OE straight draws.  They all could've been smart plays depending on the size of the pot and his stack, I don't know.  Can't really put a good read on Dominik's game.  He seemed pretty weak, checking and limping in a lot, but somehow won both of the previous games.  Is he putting a play on me?  I re-raised all in, putting the pot-odds at about 1.5:1 for him to call his flush draw.  Dominik thought about it, and "What the hell," called and lost, making me the chip leader.  Turning point of the night.  Once I've got the chip lead I was able to lean on everybody.  Stealing blinds from all positions, it was beautiful.  Won that game without much effort.

       Agnieszka,   It took me some time to find you.  How's Princeton treating you?  This is Jeff Cho from the class of 2001 (but graduated in winter 02).  It's been two years so I'll refresh your memory.  In the fall and winter of 02, I worked with you at the Humanities Center.  I started out doing research on animal sympathy/empathy and its relationship to ethics, but instead spent the bulk of my efforts developing the topic of my honor's thesis on folk psychology, in which I compared and contrasted simulation theory and theory theory.  I've always felt a little bit guilty about that.  Okay, I'll cut straight to the point: I am considering studying philosophy at the graduate level.  After graduation I asked for your recommendation for law school, and that was the direction that I tentatively picked.  I scored well on the LSAT and workd at a DC law firm as a paralegal; but a year later found that I probably will never be a great attorney, at least not one who's terribly interested at what he's doing.  Meanwhile I've been working part-time and reading through old papers and popular (=not academic) philosophy books and talking with my grad school friends.  So here I am.  I will be teaching English in Japan, for a full year starting this July (as you knew, this was something I had considered after graduation, but chose paralegal instead).  I hope to start a graduate program in September 2005.  Too late?  I have most of the application requirements in place: recommendations from you and Krista Lawlor on file at the CDC, the thesis as my writing sample, 3.41 GPA (phil grades were slightly higher), 1450 GRE (writing unknown).  As to the rest, I was hoping you can clue me in.  Which programs will I qualify for?  How should I choose between them?  Being out of school for two years, I'm not sure if I can choose a possible field or faculty with any degree of confidence.  Would a terminal master's program make more sense?  Are there questions that I haven't thought of?  So far, I've done my research exclusively from philosophicalgourmet.com.  (I've considered the economical aspect of a career in philosophy, and it's a risk I'm willing to take, for now)  Let me know.  Thanks, cho  (a similar, well, nearly identical, email was sent to Krista Lawlor as well)

      Before I left the Jamaican bar on Thursday, I may or may not have uttered the words "I shall return."  But in anycase, that is precisely what I did.  Met up with Corinne, Tyler and Courtney at the Yonago-eki (train station) and bke-caravaned to this pool/comic library/karaoke place.  Played a few games of pool, absolutely dominated everybody there.  Apparently there's not a single serious cue sportsman in the Yonago English-speaking community.  I may have had given the impression that I'm a show-off asshole by playing, and beating Nicole(who claimed to be a 4th year JET) one-handed.  Dave (Korean 3rd year JET with Japanese good enough to have an entourage of cute Japanese girlfriends), Katherine (older British ex-JET, very talkative grey eyes), Pete (typical British soccer hooligan, 4 months in, travel-friend of Kean), and some woman whose name started with D (Deborah?), Ted(American with Japanese wife who's into martial arts) were also there.  Subsequently the gang broke up and Corinne, Tyler, Ted and I made our return to the Jamaican place.  I still can't remember exactly what the place is called or where it is,    but the owner's name is Ishida, who does excellent sleight-of-hand magic;    the sumo-fan's name is Morimasa, drinks straight sho-shiu and was very good with drunken exchange of Jap/Eng gibberish;    and this is Nano, will produce a better picture of this cutie in my next escapade;    and of course, the ever-present Corinne.  (not pictured: Tyler and Scott, drummer from Indiana who may or may not be a dealer)  The bar has no more than 20 seats, but with maybe 7-8 people inside you would have to rub shoulders with everybody else.  Despite the small size, we managed to stay there until 5:30am, when the Thai girls showed up en-masse (we were forewarned by a winking Ishida-san).  Requests/solicitations in the form of "Go home?  Go home?" were easily understood and (gasp!) politely turned down, for now(what was I thinking!?).  Finally stepping out into the daylight was a disturbing and nauseating experiene after the hours spent inside that warm, dark, and strangely comfortable hole.

      Today Nishiyama-sensei brought Amy and I to city hall, where we applied for our gaijin card. The physical card itself will be available for pick-up in two weeks, but for now I have the one piece of paper (which says that I am in the process of getting my gaijin card) that legalizes my residence in Japan, so I can get bank accounts, salary, cell-phone, internet, Subway cards, and junk-mail.  Lunched at an udon place. I’ve never eaten dipped udon (like cold soba noodles) before. I would’ve slurped like a true Jap. if not for the fear of getting soysauce spots on my shirt and tie. We paid for our own lunches. Near the noodle shop at the intersection of route 245/317 was a place called Cue’s that looked like a pool hall, judging by the name and the 8-ball graphic.  Then it was straight to the Nakayama city hall. The mayor wasn’t there so I get to keep the BV cabernet for another day. Met with the head of the board of education and introduced myself to the rest of the staff. Basically it was a lot of hajimemashite, yoroshikuonegaishimas, and bowing. I found that in Japan, when in doubt, bow, apologize, or apply shame to self via other means. It is interesting how such a shame-based culture can co-exist with its history of war and aggression.  We went over the contracts in the BOE conference room. Everyone was impressed with my being born in Taiwan and my ability to speak Mandarin. In fact, so much attention was paid to me that Amy must’ve felt neglected. One interesting observation: during the meeting, I asked Nishiyama-sensei some question regarding the contract, which for some reason caused the principle of my school to nod profusely in approval, which in turn caused the principle of the elementary school to prompt (a more appropriate, and only slightly exaggerated verb describing his action would be order) Amy, his ALT, to ask questions as well. This transaction between the two principles somehow looked well-practiced. I wish I were a better writer to capture these you-had-to-be-there moments.  After that Amy and I parted ways and I went to Nakayama junior high school. I supposed I was there to work, but really I only sat in the back of the air-conditioned staff room and read Daily Yomiuri, the English newspaper (I was able to use the internet but the connection shut off before I can publish this blog entry). 5 students came by, 4 of whom were going to Temecula in 3 days, and not only their English was at a much higher level than I expected from the equivalent of 9th graders, but so was their willingness and excitement to communicate. They got excited when they understands me, and even more so, when I understand them. It was a really, really pleasant experience. One of them even tried to use an if-then conditional sentence (if it rains this weekend, there will still be festival but no fireworks)! Not to sound like a child molester or anything, but one of them looked like the kind of girl I would’ve liked in elementary school. I just realized that, those kids seemed much younger and immature to be 9th graders. Maybe it’s the water.  Nishiyama-sensei had to stay late and work on some CDs to bring to Temecula next week and did not get me home until 6:30. Hopefully it didn’t delay my party plans. Meeting Karyn in 15 for pool, ‘less it constipates and shit doesn’t go down.

      Flew from Tokyo to Yonago day before yesterday morning. Has it only been 2 days?  On the flight, Pam(the British girl who also lives in Yonago around the BOE building, short red hair, the proprieter of missing luggage) and Simona(philosophy major from Iowa, girl with very diaphramic voice) both commented on Cryptonomicon that led to further conversations. Who would’ve thought that reading Neal Stephenson would add increments to my social life as well?  Lunch with Honda-sensei, Tokunaga(sp?)-sensei, Amy, and Tanaka-san at some Italian restaurant. Jen from Seattle was also there at the same restaurant with her group. Decent chatter considering the language barrier.  Moved into Belletopia (pics and dscp to come) the same afternoon. Honda-sensei and Tanaka-san stayed until gas and telephone were activated. Amy and I went on a brief biking excursion/orientation.  The same night, Sarah, a 1-year ex-ALT who lived in the other building came by and invited us to Doma-Doma, a Japanese restaurant in restaurant row with English menus with pictures, apparently the key to Yonago survival. There we met Kean(sp?), an Irish guy starting/working an English conversation class, and Karyn(sp?), a neo-hippy 3rd-year ALT from Northeridge, who was obviously stoned. Wow, did not think dialated pupils come this easily in Japanese countryside. 2 beers later Sarah drove us home.  Yesterday, got oriented at the train station with Honda-sensei and Amy in the morning. It’s going to cost 1.4 mon yen every month (after commuter discount) to ride the train (480 yen each way) to school.  Went to school, met the teachers and some of the students, whose names would take months for me to remember. The school only has ~150 students, but the architecture is marvelous, comparable even to sections of Stanford campus. There will be plenty to write about the school later so I won’t do it now.  Unable to start a bank account without proof of address, Honda-sensei and I went to the sake joint owned by Hata-san, a friendly woman in her 50s. The Hata family grow their own rice (in the rice paddies across the street from the shop) and brew their own sake. The shop is right in front of the Nakayama train station, with a tea house on the second floor, so I’m sure I will be spending a lot of time hanging out there. Got passport photos and shopped at an electronic store (for a next-to-useless TV antenna) and 100yen store afterwards. Honda-sensei treated me to cake and tea before she dropped me off, as a belated birthday present of sorts, at an immaculate dessert shop appropriately called Libido.  Biked along the beach with the other Yonago JETs. Myself, Amy, Pam, Majinder, Tyler, Adam, and Courtney were led by a current JET Suzana. Caught ¼ of a sunset, saw some sea cockroaches and jellies.    View from the beach.    Tyler, Pam, and Majinder.    Possible culprit from my swollen left index (see the next entry on 7/30)  Bought a few cans and hung out at Courtney’s apartment, in the same building as Tyler. A much bigger space than mine. Very animated discussion about Bush and war ensued, which I declined to take part.    Left to right: Courtney, Amy, Corinne, and Tyler. On the floor in Courtney's oversized pad.  Corinne came by later and we all went out to a Jamaican hole-in-the-wall bar for the barternder’s birthday and drank. Scott, a guy from Indiana who’s been here for 12 years were present for the festivities also. I think I had a little bit too much oolong-hai, which is oolong tea and sho-shu (burning-wine in Kanji, which I understand to be sake on steroids, bout 40-50 proof) and tasted just like tea. Drank enough to bring out some of my patented steps.  If not for Amy I would not have made it back home on the bike. Woke up the next morning, naked and hung-over around 8am, with a mysteriously big puddle of water on the kitchen floor, in which my bag was soaked. Very strange indeed.

      Spent a whole day between JET workshops around the hotel.  Informative yes, useful no.  Did not learn anything significant enough for me to at least change or form any ideas about the year to come.    Met the Tottori people this morning but missed the chance to see them completely bombed while getting completely bombed myself tonight.  I fell asleep between the 8pm general reception and the 9pm meeting time and did not wake up until 11pm.  Got no one to blame but myself (although Ranier could've easily tried to wake me up on his way out).  Shit shit shit shit.    It's not the end of the world.  I hope.  I will simply have to make more of an effort to meet the Tottori folks tomorrow...  So far, there's Amy, Joe, Erin, Varsha, and those two not so intelligent guys at the lunch table.  I tell myself that I needed the sleep anyway, and probably wouldn't have been very sociable or interesting even if I had gone out, but these thoughts failed to comfort.  Shit.    Option 1: head upstairs to Mike's room, where there might be an in-room party.  Problem: the whereabouts of his room is unknown to me.  It's in the forties, which narrows down to near 100 possible candidates.    Option 2: head downstairs to AJET secretariat and play PTY.  Problem: it's just simply pathetic.    Option 3: head out and wonder around Shinjuku myself, hopefully starting or joining a group.  Problem: I'm just not awake enough to accomplish this.    Option 4: head up and sulk at the bar on the 45th floor.  Problem: the price of the bar is too high for self-loathing.    Option 5: sleep it off.  I probably needed the sleep anyway.  Problem: see above.    Ran into Carry a couple of times today, with whom I had significant conversations and exchanged knowingly flirtatious moves at the pre-departure orientation in LA.  Although she looks a bit older than me, she's probably my best shot at getting laid in Tokyo.  I'd much rather that this option was available for several other candidates(viz. Jennifer, Mina, Kimi) but with such a short window of time it would be difficult.      I probably wouldn't have been very interesting, or in any shape or form to socialize, plus I saved some money on expensive Tokyo drinks right?  I probably needed the sleep anyway.

          The bandwidth springhead. The hallway outside of the JET computer room has wireless access. Only other internet options: 1) sign up for a 15 minutes slot; 2) compliment dial-up from your room.            My hotel room, shared with Ranier, ex-UCLA music major, pic to come later.           Bus ride from Narita to Shinjuku. The girl in the red sox hat (lefty second row from front) is really cute , but who is obvious way to aware of her own hotness           The streets of Shinjuku.  The native habitat of 500yen ramen and 850yen Guiness.

      Felt super corny about revealing my birthday to those guys at the Irish pub.  It sounded like a desperate cry for attention, but it had to be done.  It was my 25th birthday for God's sake!    Went running this morning, stopped by the toilet in Shinjuku central park to shit, but the sight of the squadder without toilet paper turned me back immediately.    Returned to the hotel, went to the bathroom in the basement restaurant/bar area.  For some reason I simply couldn't get in to any of the stalls.  Either all of the stalls were occupied and locked (in which case it must've been a horrible experience for the person(s) on the other side of the stalls, given my knocking, kicking and prying), or there's some sort of key/lock mechanism that I couldn't figure out.  A kid pissing in the kiddie urinal was looking back at me the whole time, wonder what he was thinking.    The bathroom in the lobby were unlocked, and the stalls were wide open.  I gladly entered and took care of business.  Just as the toilet in my hotel room, these big guys have all sorts of buttons on the side, in an electronic biday/toilet combination.  After the busines was taken care of, I fiddled around for at least 2 minutes to flush the toilet in vain.  Minutes later, I realized that the flush didn't work because the toilet wasn't plugged in.

      Last night, decided to go without my pool cue.  Mom will have to ship it later.    9:30am  Meet at LA airport.  Checked in baggage.  Lots of random small-talks turned into more interesting serendipitous repeat encounters.  Talked to Ranier at the baggage line, who turned out to be my roommate at the Kaio Plaza.  Talked to Jocylyn's dad in line, who's a doctor from Taiwan, whose daughter Jocylyn sat next to me on the flight.  Maybe the small talk with Jennifer will turn out to be something special tomorrow?  She has a way of looking sideways at me that reall tugs at my heartstrings.  When I told her that my town was famous for broccoli, she said, "Do you like broccoli?  I like broccoli."  Damn, I guess it's just not the same transcribed, but the way she said it...    Sat through a boring, uneventful, under-ethnolyzed 12 hour flight, landed in Narita around 4pm local time.  Went through custom and all the subsequent lines without much trouble (custom only cahrged me 400 yen for the 3 additional wine bottles).  Another hour of uneventful bus ride and we're at the hotel.    Checked in, hauled luggage up, met Ranier, showered, walked through Sinjuku for a couple of hours.  Will upload pictures tomorrow.

      3:11.  Three hours into the last day of my American days, thirty hours before the intercontinental take-off.    Let's see what we can accomplish with the last-minute packing.  Consider it my last harrah.    Pack it up and go to sleep.  The wake up for tomorrow's 1pm-8pm pre-departure orientation at LAX Westin.  Time is running out, is you ready?    Another $20 at Stan's house tournament was not a bad going-away present.  Same goes with the Eric's saiyonara at the DB.  It's now or never.    Ikusoo.

      Been reading Cryptonomicon for the past few days, and stumbled upon many insights along the way.    Men who believe that they are accomplishing something impressive by speaking (viz. Brian Frank) speak in a different way from men who believe that speaking is a waste of time once the point has gotten across (viz. Jon Wyler). Obviously, belonging to the first class, despite being more confident and fluent, aren't necessarily more intelligent, or even more educated. This is just another way of saying that there are people who talk for the sake of talking, and there are people who talk for the sake of communicating.   But there's a third, much rarer class. Men of the first category, who typically talk as if they have a bunch of stuff figured out, are often frustrated with speaking to men of the third class, who think in terms of questions rather than answers, who does not speak impressively and are in turn less likely to be impressed by impressive speech. Men of the second category, who speaks with agendas in their heads and mentally checks off boxes as they go, also get nowhere with men of the third class, because conversations with men of the third class don't typically have desginated roadmaps and, as are typically the case, go nowhere.  People of this third class, more often than not talk for no particular reason at all.   Everyone think of themselves as the exception to the rule, I am no exception. Despite that, every once in a while, I find myself truly belonging to this third class. I don't speak in order to be listened to by others (because I don't talk impressively),  or in order to be heard (because ideas that sound interesting to me are better conveyed through writing), or in order to hear myself (I hear myself much better without speaking). I speak as a way of making up a bunch of new shit as I go along, and generally hope that someone'll join in, which no one ever does, at least in any satisfactory manner.    Often, after I've been blabbering for a while, people ask "So what's the point?" Asking this question is an indication of completely missing the point of my blabbering, which by design have no point. However, the pointlessness of my blabbering is precisely the reason why I blabber them--so that the point can be found via a joint effort, which is the point of having a bi-directional conversation in the first place.

      Eric, Jon, and Ed have all needled me about playing higher stakes, telling me that I'm good enough.  I certainly think I'm better than all of them and I do so unabashedly--I have to be better, better be better after investing more than 10x in the amount of time playing, reading, watching and thinking poker.  Just as in everything else, confidence needs to be earned.  But in addition to being a good poker player, you also gotta be a good gambler.  One measure of being a good poker player is the stake that you play for--naturally the higher the stakes the tougher the players you're playing against.  But a good gambler plays at games/tables/stakes in which he can win the most money.  At this stage in my poker career, winning more takes a back seat to losing less.  And sitting down at a 2-3 no limit table, commiting $100 when my bankroll is a mere $150, is not a smart gambling proposition.  I have full confidence that my game is sharp enough for me to sit down and not be a underdog, but I have no confidence in winning THAT ONE particular session, and no stomach to swallow the deficit if I lose.  It's much better to make more/lose less than to buy the skewed notion that you belong as one of the big boys for one night.  Here's an analogy for the above situation.  Say I have $100 in my wallet and $500 in my bank acount, someone makes a proposition to me: "I'll flip this coin: if it lands head, you win $120, if it lands tails, I win $100."  This is obviously a winning proposition for me: I am a 6:5 favorite, winning on average $10 for every $100 invested.  But I just can't take it with only 1 bet in my pocket and 5 more in the bank before I go broke.    If the prop is $1.2 to $1, and he guarantees at least a thousand tosses, then it's a diference story.  That is why I play 50/1 on PTY and 1/2 live.  It simply the smarter gambling move for my budget.    So Ed, if I can budget $500 monthly for poker, then I'll more than happily play no-limit in casinos.  Since I don't have a $50,000 job, $100 buy-in's seems like a long way from now.

      There were some lessons learned last night.  Lamenting about woulda-coulda hands becomes the precursor of tilt for me.  I need to maintain conviction in my hand decisions throughout a folded hand.  Somehow I have this problem only when playing live as it is easier for me to maintain a long-term perspective when playing online (thanks PokerTracker).  Also, I noticed that when dealt a folding hand, I have the tendency to turn the cards horizontally, as opposed to keeping playable hands vertical.  Surely I have a  sleuth of telling postures and habits like this.  Additionally, I think I found a good articulation for my poker philosophy.    People like to think that poker is a skill game.  I don't think poker is a skill game: it is still, very much, and overwhelmingly gambling.  IMO the ratio breaks down to 80% gambling and 20% skill (unirioncally, the same odds of completing a 4 flush with 1 card to come).  But like all forms of gambling, there are good gamblers, there are bad gamblers, and then there is the house, a perpetually winning gambler.  Take blackjack for example: without card-counting, the house has a .5% edge (standard casino rules).  Obviously there are a lot more idiots than perfect players to boost the house edge, but even so the casino earns a minimum of 50 cents on every $100 invested.  It might not sound like alot, but enough to build a city in the middle of the desert.    Notice the two key words mentioned here: edge and investment.  Edge is what a skillful poker gambler needs to stay perpetually profitable.  We're not talking about 2x return profitable here.  From what I can gather, 1 big bet per hour (a big bet being 2x big blind, $1 in 50/1 game) seem to be the concurrent definition of a decent edge.  If you can maintain that edge for 60,000 hands, you'll make (assuming a hand a minute, too fast for live play but about standard for online) $1000 just playing 50/1 in 1000 hours, or 25 40hr, 9-5 weeks.  Again, that might not sound like a lot, but if you're skillful and can maintain that edge as you progress in limit, you can earn a pretty decent hourly rate.  Professional poker players like Daniel Negreanu, who play mostly 200/400 hold'em during his "working hours" on the Las Vegas strip, makes more per hour than most attorneys.    Of course, to be able to play 200/400 like Daniel, you will need 1)a minimum of $10,000, or 25 big bets, just to be able to sit down and handle the table swings; 2)a minimum bankroll of $120,000, just to be able to handle the long-term variations; 3)to be able to stomach possible cold streaks and losing both of the above occasionally.  As for me, like every other poker player, I wouldn't mind being able to make a living out of it, so naturally the big bet/hour is the holy grail I'm aiming for.  Playing 50/1 online, I can handle all three of the above for $25 table stakes and $300 bankroll.  If I can turn my current $150 in PTY into $300, then $600, then $1200, then $1800, then $2400, then $3000, then $6000, I can play 10/20 with regularity and turn poker into a legitimate part-time job.  In the long run, if I can maintain the edge, playing poker then becomes a profitable hobby/investment.  It'll take a few years, tens of thousands of hours and millions of hands to get there.  That's the kind of perspective you need to evaluate the skill in my kind poker player.  Give the same bankroll, table time, and playing conditions to me and Johny Chan in a who-can-win-most/lose-less race, I have confidence that I can keep pace with him--for the first 2 months only.  With this long-term perspective, I can enjoy poker even if I'm not winning, but I need to be sure that I'm always sitting down at a table with protential for profit.  At the poker table, I want to be an investor with an edge.

         Shown: two nights ago, after poker with Ed, Mark and Dominik.  Ed won $10 from Mark.  I won $5 from him.  Although just one win out of 3, it was a great win for me.   With a K high flush on the turn, bet about 2x pot.  Ed sheepishly asked if I would show him the cards if he folded, I responded with a resolute no.  Ed though about it, went all-in with ace high, which I too quickly called.  Ed wasn't too upset about it, not as upset as Mark, who cried at Ed for giving me the huge chip lead.  If you cry like a loser, I'll bet on you to become one.  Poker last night at the Hawaian Garden, about 5-6 hours of 1-2 hold'em with Mark.  Ed and Dominik played blackjack, paigow, and $100 buy-in no limit.  From the last few orbits that I saw, Ed's play was surprisingly good with several very tricky gear shifts.  He played tight in the beginning (from when I started to watch), folding A6o to small 2x blind raise, folding QTo to no raise--hands that he would've gone all in at our home games.  Then he started to catch some cards--and I mean catching hole cards AND friendly flops--44 with 4 on the flop, JJ with no overcard, QQ with J high flop, A3o with A high (against an unraised big blind).  Then all hell broke loose.  People were afraid to bet into him, and he bluffed a couple of hands with next to nothing, and checked more than his share of maginal hands to the river (55 wins a small pot against 3 overcards).  Even pulled off and showed a semi-bluff to the table: the board showed both flush and straight possibility, it was obvious that both Ed and the Angel hat unabomber were drawing at something with their 4 to 1 pot-size bets and timid calls; river was a J that would've completed both a flush and a straight; unabomber checks, Ed overbets $80 into a $30-$40 pot.  Unabomber folds and turns over his Q high straight, Ed slaps down his Q high straight along with some commentary (it would've been a very, very impressive play, putting maximum pressure on straight, ignorant straight, and even low flushes--if he had known that he didn't have the best hand, which he later admitted that he didn't; so in the end it was a very, very dumb play).  Ed ened up with, counting his paigow and blackjack losses, plus 91.  Dominik didn't do so well.  I only saw him win one small hand with a set, and several limp-in attempts held up.  Which is to be expected I guess: you can't really sit down at a $100 buy-in no limit game with just $100 as the 2-1 short stack against half of the table.  He said he was down about 2 bills.  Despite all that Dominik seemed to play with more composure (or maybe it was just misread resignation) than fidgety Ed.  Mark did exceptionally well with plus 70 or 80.  I have no idea how the hell he does so well at 1-2.  He claimed that he bluffed his share, which I saw no evidence of.  Even if he did, I only remember the tabled folded to him once, maybe twice.  He showed down at least 15 hands to every supposedly successful bluff (which, I guess, is a good bluff ratio for the table). Well, I suppose there were some shown down hands that would've been bluffs if not for the friendly turn or river or both.  There were some unfriendly ones, but they resulted in chops--which Mark got visibly upset about, and I mean slap-the-table upset--that's the kind of night he was having.  The one play that was particularly memorable was a shown down K high complete bluff(KJo or KQo)--but you still need to catch cards for these posturing/advertising maneuvers to gain action later.  I won exactly 10 dollars.  My biggest pot was an A high flush that I chased all the way to the river against a Q high flush made on the flop, with at least $30 and a very displeased Asian lady in that pot (she can be upset all she wants, my flush chase was a by the book no brainer; with 4 players in a raised pot and 3 remaining on turn, I had more than enough pot odds to bet and call a 2-1 draw on the flop and 4-1 draw on the turn; it would've been stupid not to draw at the nut flush).  The Asian lady was solid and tricky: checked her top-pair until the river to hustle a big bet out of my Ace high, and yet showed down the bottom pair against the loosy-goosy Armenian.  I caught her watching me through her orange-tinted glasses many times after I looked up from my hole cards.  Subsequently I gave her a good share of my own stare down as well.  Besides her, the rest of the table were filled with obvious fish.  $10 for 5-6 hours of 1-2 worked out to be exactly 1 big bet per hour, which isn't bad for a now professed grinder like me, but I would still rather catch a hot deck and double up like Mark did.  I still don't understand how he pulls off huge wins like this, 3 out of 4 times now.  I guess it can't be all luck, but I just didn't see the skill in filling up full houses.

      So, Kobe remains a Laker.  Damn you Kobe, for getting my hopes up for something we both knew that was never going to happen.  Good luck with next year, if you don't end up taking it in the Colorado penal system.  Although Kobe could be a slightly more likable player with Phil and Shaq gone.  Maybe then all of his me-first, out-of-flow jumpers will stop making me cringe, because they may be actually warranted.  A Kobe 3 with 15 seconds to go on the shot clock is worth more than feeding Brian Grant in the post.  He just might have to take those if he wants to stay in the playoffs.  With improved SA, Utah, Houston, and Denver, plus the already good Dallas, Sac, and Memphis who haven't improved YET, throw in New Orleans, Lakers should focus on making, and forget about winning the playoffs.  At least it would make the LA/LA matchup that much more exciting.  One more thing, about the Eli and House trade.  True, they did trade them for nothing, both of whom they could've gotten more value than 2nd round picks from Charlotte.  They cleared up what, 2.5 mil?  That makes their cap at 14.5 million for next season (which was what they were going to offer Kobe).  Considering that Q just got a 45 mil, 6 year offer from the Suns, that makes his annual salary at 7.5 mil.  IF the Clippers match it, which I think they should, they still have another 7 million to sign...Darius Miles!?  This has to happen.  Elgin Baylor will be a fool not to.  Imagine always having at least 2 of either Maggette, Q, and Miles on your wings for the entire game!  Miles could even play some point, as Portland did try to use him as a point forward in short stretches last season.  This has to happen.

      Yesterday I got this idea that my stomach cramps and migranes were probably caused by dehydration so I drank plenty of water today.  Yesterday I also got my international driver's permit from AAA.  It took a few hours through too many detours, for a simple process that should've taken 15 minutes.  A lady in a blue blouse, one of those kinds with a folded collar, was talking and listening intently to the first guy in line when I walked in--a little TOO intently.  The guy blabbered on about golfing in Mexico, and she was listening like it was the bishop's gospel.  Definitely one of those lonely housewife/PTA busybody types that Orange County is so plentiful of.  She readily admitted that it was her first day here, and when I made the request for the international driver's license, she replied that AAA doesn't do it, but they have the forms and a list of addresses where I can get it done.  She even asked another coworker if she had the right form.  I had reason's to doubt this person's competence since 1) all info that I received point me to AAA for the driving permit and 2)she asked me if it's a new application or renewal and 3)the title of the form is passport application/renewal.  Despite my suspicions, I still took the form, tried to fill it out right there, and took it home because I didn't have my passport info.  All the way back I was troubled about the application that asked for passport info, as my passport is in the hands of the Japanese Embassy.  Got home, called one of the numbers, turned out to be a post office--the usual place to get PASSPORTS.  They obviously did not process driving permits, and directed me to the DMV, which I later found out wasn't open on Mondays.  Came back home, checked the internet to make sure that the lady was talking out of her stupid middle-aged ass about the AAA not processing international driving permits, and left home for the 3rd time, back to AAA for the second time.  This time I actually had someone competent enough to do the simple paperwork, which involved stapling my picture to a form that asked for my CA driver's license info and checking my AAA card.    I was done in less than 20 minutes.  Before I left, I saw the lady with the blue blouse looking over someone's shoulder in the back cubicle, but decided not to ruin her first day on the job which I by all means should've done.  Yesterday I also lost $15 to Mark, who won all three games we played and made out plus $35.

      Front Mission 4: accomplished.  Block Buster late fees: $12.90 (including Winning11).  Time spent:  53 hours and 14 minutes (during 9-day span).  Time wasted: 53 hours and 14 minutes.    Entertainment lost: much (poker winnings, Catalina trip, golf day).    Side-quests accomplished: The adventures of Drizzt Do'Urden, secondboy of Daermon N'a'shezbaernon, Eighth House of Menzoberranzan.  Ire caused: that of Mark, probably Eric's, most definitely Mom's.  Health costs: much.  Include but not limited to sleep loss, appetite loss, chronic stomach pains, migranes, dehydration, two sore thumbs, stiff neck, etc.  In exchange for: petty pride in my two-pronged melee tactics, backed up by and linked to a squad of long range shooters, causing 1500+ points of damage every round to enemy wanzers, and yet having enough flexibility for two medics and two missile/bazooka/rifle for extremely-long-range support.  Taps will surely appreciate.  Meanwhile...  Days remain until departure: 13.  To-do list items remain: yet to be determined.  Probably a lot, hopefully not too much.  I am feeling that ulcerous pain again.

      My migrane reached its pinnacle tonight, not even a double shot of ibuprophen can ameliorate it.  Apparently the only way for me to reduce the pain is to lower my head as if bowing or looking at my shoes.  Being humble and self-deprecating has other benefits as well.    Spent the whole day debilitated by the headache and the waves of stomach pain.  I did win seven dollars from Party though, so it wasn't a completely waste of a day.  Bought two books: Cryptonomicon by Neal stephenson and the Drizzt trilogy by R.A. Salvadore.  They should last me a couple of weeks, once the aches blow away.  Decided against driving over to Mark's for the PS2.  Considering the possibility of wasting more hours and aggravating the migrane, it's probably a good idea.  Although since video game craving can surface at any time in any form, it's best to guard myself against it.

      Sick I've been, sick I am, sick will I be tomorrow?  There was the near-fever and headache from two nights ago.  And ever since then I've been having persistent migranes and stomach aches.  Low energy, low appetite, felt like food poisoning.  How is that possible?  I don't think I've been eating anything foul.  Mom's cooking should be fine, considering that neither she nor Jack got sick.  I haven't really eaten anything outside besides the Big Shot BBQ pork sandwich on Tues or Wed.  Maybe from drinking?  I haven't drank excessively, at least by the standards of a typical binge alcoholic.  Weed?  I've never heard of people getting sick from smoking weed.  If anything weed should have eased the onset of the pain.  The more I think about it, the more I think that the old smelly bottle of vodka(I knew I should've paid attention to the un-vodka-like smell) from Ed's house, the one he brought out after Salick, Mark and I drank everything else, did the trick.  On top of the illness, nights of over-drinking, over-smoking, combined with days of under-sleeping, under-hydrating, under-nourishing and under-exercising have resulted in around-the-clock fatique.  I must admit, although the illness has caused much discomfort, it has not caused much dismay in my daily ritual of doing absolutely nothing.  This whole week, I've split time playing Diablo II, LOD, Master of Orion, and Front Mission 4 (plus NBA2K3 and Winning11 with Mark).  My neck is stiff from so much video games.  I literally played Front Mission 4 (giant robot TBS game) from the moment I woke up until now.  If not for Mark coming over and taking away the PS2 (for Megan and Mika to play Spiderman2), I most certainly would've have been playing still.  With Japan preparation and grad school stuff lying in shambles and lying in week-old weed, the illness has not caused much chagrin either.  Perhaps this malaise is not merely of the body.  It is still the fourth.  There's still enough time to make a mental roadmark.  From this point on, things shall change.  Now that I have gathered and listed most of the stuff I need for writing sample and other grad school considerations, instead of keep working on it to no end, I ought to just set it aside and start making serious efforts in preparation for Japan.  Packages need to be shipped out by mid-July in order for them to arrive in Japan by the time I get there.  Collections of pictures, omiyage shopping, book shopping etc. remain to be done as well.

      From Ed, Eric, and Taps.  Not including a first-hand all-in by me(my AA against Mark's K paired on flop), voided on an Ed-ian technicality.  Actually the jokers were in the deck for the hand so the technicality is not so presposterous as shuffling the deck mid-deal.    With Jon and Eric around, the night was filled with a pleasant amount of Ed-bashing, which was a nice change of pace.  Mark jumped into the fray against Ed a little too.  Lots of ribbing and rubbing from everyone against everyone (it was refreshing to get some jousting from Eric, being rarely in the driver's seat of the table).  All in all I'd have to say that the vibe was good, an excellent way to win twenty dollars.  Swear there's really something about this deck.  Again I had pocket 6's.  Ed wouldn't call that all-in but I showed him nonetheless.  Also split two more all-ins with 4's and 7's.  I had some nice cards, 2 AA's to be exact (one won in the aforementioned technicality, the other barely won more than the blinds).  Ed had four 7's once.  Mark flopped a flush and a full-house, both against Eric I think, who had at least 2-pairs both times.  There just seemed to be more unlikely (but exciting) combinations of cards coming out of this Kem deck.  Maybe the larger numbers and letters in the card corners gave the hands that you get that much more memorable--or maybe these cards are just greased somehow.  Came back home way too drunk and stoned at about 3am.  A combination of booze, weed, dehydration, too many hours of Master of Orion, and days without exercise gave me one of the worst bouts of headachy semi-sleep last night.  I was sweating and overheating so much in bed I actually thought that I was coming down with a fever or something.  But other than the headache that went away, weak stomach, and overtime on the toilet, I actually felt alright this morning.  Not alright enough to finish 8 more miles before Sunday, but alright enough to couch-surf all day.  Better get with it.

      Up fifteen from tonight/this morning.   Most of it from Salick (sp?) and Dominik (sp?).   Way too everything to think like a critic. Think Mark is down too, maybe a little bit, But Me and Ed made out with fifteen.  Each.  A Leech  Was stuck around my stack  for most of the last game. Ed was either catching some cards or I'm just really really drunk and stoned. Oh well, I still made out with fifteen.  Some notables: pocket 6's, which showed up at an abnormally mutated rate (at least 6), had not been (two of those in consecutive hands...) kind to (correction, consecutively MY hands with which I knocked out ) Ed tonight.  66 from a fresh deck of Kem Cards.  You think they grease specific cards to increase their appearance?  I wonder if that's part of the appeal to Kem cards.  My Kem cards.  There's a certain Japanese word for that aged-worn-in-well-used-and- well-cared-for look of things.  I wonder if that is something these Kem cards can achieve?  Will the Tercel, plus a carwash, acheive the said look?  Will my cues?  The bleached and hole-ly red volunteer t-shirt?  I especially wonder about the last.  Mark pointed out at some point tonight about a story idea which sounded really interesting but I forgot.  I also wonder about that, and about other things.  Other things such as why the hell am I still up and typing nonsense at 6am.  I don't know the answer to that one.  I think I will wonder about it.  I also should wonder about everybody's birthdays.  Probably even construct...  Oh dammit.

      The eastern part of Tottori prefecture is known for mainly two things: the Uradome coastline, 1.5 km of rugged precipitous cliffs, caves, and former pirate hideouts, and the Tottori Sakyu, the sand dunes.  We were tour-bussed to the dock and got on a tour boat.  Many JETs were visibly hung-over, this might turn out to be more ride than some could handle.    The girl in red hair in the right foreground was Kate, the guy with shaved head in the left foreground was Matt.  Between them, the ponytailed girl in red top is Tottori Kate.  To her left in brown and headband is Amy.  The orange tanktop is Simona.  The girl in blue-sleeved white tee is Yuca.  These names will be repeated in the following narrative.  The coastline can be seen from the boat:         Pretty chill ride, barely any waves on the water.  The hung-over victims finally released their collective breath and held on to their nausea.  I was by myself mostly, poeticizing in the drama of the landscape and lamenting my yellow Irvine Chinese School t-shirt being stained by the squid icecream I got before boarding:       It tasted suspiciously similar to vanilla.  Probably just a gimmick for tourists.  Mayumi, our prefectural advisor, was so curious about it she chipped in for me to buy one.  Soon we got off and were again bussed, this time to the Tottori sand dunes:    Kerry and Rachel(?) to the right.  It looked like they were taking off their sandals, but they probably put it back on soon after.  The sand was very hot.  I didn't want to walk in my sneakers and got a big toe blister.     This picture of elementary kids competing in a shoe-tossing contest was taken with the vivid setting in the manual mode.  Once we got over this hill, we could see, to the side of where we came from, the huge writings in the sand, weakly reminiscent of those Peruvian alien stone paintings.    Once we got over this hill, it was such an awesome time that I didn't even bother with the pictures.  There was this HUGE precipice of sand, between 40 and 60 degree steep, that fell down all the way into the beach.  The sand was soft and thick, plowed and loosened by climbing tourists.  Jumping off the precipice, you can literally get a 2 second hangtime before landing softly and harmlessly 10-15 feet below!  And you can get in a good 5-6 jumpes before the slope tapered and flattened.  I did that a couple of times, as much as my stamina can allow the multiple climbs (I'd estimate that the precipice was at least 100 feet in height), before and after I jumped into the ocean below.  Matt launched off the cliffs long-jump style, I opted for a hybrid of Jordan and split-leg SCUBA entrance, and Pam topped everybody with her self-styled summersaults.  We were the only three energized enough to do it multiple times.  I tried the side roll once, and tested out the summersault/front roll once as well.  Naturally, all these acts of childish nonesense was witnessed by many Japanese toursits, whose reactions were unknown, and un-cared-about, by us.  It was hard sweaty work jumping/rolling down and then climbing back up, so it was a good thing that the ocean was so close.    The water was cool, with a slightly cooler undercurrent.  The beach floor was flat and shallow, no deeper than 5 feet deep as far as 30-40 feet out, so the waves were barely noticeable.  You can lean back and float in the calm water without even worrying salt water getting into your nostrils.  Jason (Tottori-shi JET, potential organizer of Tottori ultimate) jumped in first, followed by me, followed by Tyler, then a couple of girls, then another couple of girls, then, predicably, a bunch of guys.  I don't think I've had so much fun wading in the waters.  Simona started it all by taking off her orange tank-top and waving it at the people standing/sitting on the beach, then the act was followed by Yuca and Kurayoshi Kate.  Of course Tyler and I couldn't let the guys be one-upped and did the same with our shorts.  Tyler was bolder than me and even swam around a little.  Jason thought he was stung by jellies (though I seriously doubt it).  Tyler went up and hauled Amy into the water.  Then the whole thing got too crowded and awkwardly sexually charged so I got out and jumped around the sand dunes some more before jumping back into the water for a rinse.  Tyler got out and found that his boxer ripped near his right ass cheek.  Someone, Manjinder I think, took a picture of it.  After posing a Superman for the picture, Tyler turned-around and mooned (he didn't take it off so it was more of a three quarters moon) a nearby Japanese family, father mother plus two school-age kids, while proclaiming proudly "Eigo no sensee desu!" (I am an English teacher)  This happend for about 1.5 to 2 hours, then we gathered and rinsed off.  It rained a little as we walked back, completing a day of double cycles: sand/sea and sun/rain.  We lunched at the Tottori sakyu visitor's center.  The food was called mushi(steam)-something style of Japanese cooking, with a stack of wooden boxes being steamed over a personal mini-stove on your table.  The food was, like the rest of the day, just awesome.  Shrimp sashimi, raw with purple eggs; flavored steamed rice; little clams served on a big clam shell; udon noodles; steamed salmon and bigger shrimp.  Slurped it all up like a true Nihonjin.  The bus ride to and from were good as well.  I talked, or rather listened, to this Jewish princess type named Kate from Chicago throughout the bus ride.  She had complaints about almost everything she could think of, and seemed to genuinely believe that I was listening everytime I say "Yeah that sucks," or "Wow that sucks."  She complainted about crashing her brother's junker car in June, about crashing it and having to go to work, about how pissed her brother was, about how not pissed her Dad was, about this and that and more I could not recall.  And after the sand dunes, about how wet and sandy she was, about how she had to go to work all wet and sandy, and pointed it out to everybody by asking Mayumi (our prefectural advisor) how to say wet and sandy in Japanese.  Jesus.  I joked about something in the line of being wet and sandy is like every guy's fantasy, thinking that maybe my blunt and unsmooth attempt at flirting would shock her into shutting up.  Obviously it didn't work.  I probably went a little bit too far with it the rest of the bus ride and ended up slapping the sand off her ass before we got off.  Now that I think about it, that was entirely inappropriate, and  she was probably more offended than amused.  Mission accomplished.  Decided not to tag along with the hardcores and party at Subo's place.  Sign of growth at 25?  Trained back to Yonago with Pam, with whom I had a good talk with, despite generic topics.  Got home round 5pm, ate instant ramen and fell asleep while watching Sex in the City season 4 tape 1.

      Today we had orientation at Tottori-shi, the capital of Tottori prefecture.    Took the 10:30 train from Yonago station with most of the Yonago JETS.  Tried reading Jared Diamond`s Guns Germs and Steel but couldn't resist small talk.  For some reason I sneezed and sniffled throughout the whole thing.  An hour later we were there.  Some of us went to an Italian restaurant, three of us, Matt, myself, and Jen from Sakaiminato went to a Korean restaurant.  The bi-bi-ban there was not the cold dish as I thought it was, but turned out to be rather hot, both in spiciness and temperature (it was served in a burning hot stone bowl).  Matt called it a workout eathing that thing in the heat of the Nippon day without AC.  Orientation turned out to be the usual bore as everything else.  Some rather uninformative information sessions later we were served a buffet Italian dinner with all you can drink Asahi beer, which was nice.  During which I found out that not-Sakaiminato Jen was a pretty avid poker fan and plays PTY, which was a good thing to know down the road.  Later we went to a bar, and then karaoke.  Nothing especially notable, just drinks and ethanolized cordiality.  Then I went back to the hotel which was supposed paid for by the Nakayama BOE.  And I typed this in the hotel lobby with music box background music.  It`s playing The Circle Of Life right now.  Good cheesy tune to get some cheesy sleep before tomorrow`s adventure.

      There was Spy Games the movie, and there was spy games the games played concurrently during the movie.  I believe that I may have inadvertently put a subtle move on Courtney tonight while watching Spy Games, a move so subtle that I didn't really even notice it, so subtle that it's possible that it might never happend at all.  While watching the movie, Courtney's foot touched mine a couple of times, inadvertently by both of us.  She was for somereason extremely uneasy and impatient and kept shifting around and playing with her bottle and hankerchief.  Then we touched very so slightly, the tip of her pinky toe and the side of my calf.  I didn't move away at first because I hadn't even noticed it, then I noticed it, but didn't move away.  So that was it.  This went on for maybe 20 seconds before she withdrew, and a car loaded with explosives ran into a building and blew up the whole thing.  Now keep in mind, the movie was very confusing.  "So, was that good or bad?" I asked, and Tyler explained the drama behind the exploding car.  Then Courtney put in her 2yens.  "You see, Brad Pitt was late, in bringing the doctor, so Redford decided to go ahead and use the Lebenanese terrorists to kill the Sikh.  They had bad communication and the whole mission went to shit."  Was she saying something else?  I was so turned on by the prospect of having this kind of double talk with Courtney.  Was she daring me or something?  "But the Sikh is dead, right?"  "Yeah, but the doctor was dead."  At this point, I started to think that either a) the whole thing never happend at all or b)the whole thing happened, Courtney was aware, and shot it down.  Either way I scored nothing, although I would've preferred b) so that I can at least get some brownie points for subtlety.    Then the movie went on, and on a couple of instances she turned and looked at me.  I didn't return the look, but from my peripheral vision those looks seemed loaded with meaning and inquiry.  One such instance she turned and looked at me during this line: "Maybe you (Redford) didn't anticipate his (Pitt) feelings for her."  Jesus.  I just played dumb because it's probably what she expected out of a guy and because at this point it's probably better to play it safe and not acknowledge the moment.

      After the parade was over, we (Amy, Courtney, Tyler) walked around town checking out the rest of the festivities.  There were some Okinawan traditional matial art/dance,     and taiko.     I had a squid on a stick for dinner.  It was covered in soysauce, much like alot of different BBQed foods in all the booths.  At 500yen, it was ridiculously expensive for such a small portion.  We met up with some other people at this restaurant, but I was so tired I just left around 8:30pm.  The streets were packed!  And people were screaming over each other in loudspeakers.  The road in front of the station were lined with these 20 foot tall wooden antennaes drapped lanterns, about two per block.  This is the best way I could describe it, but see for yourself.     This one is apparently sponsored by the Tottori Bank.  Over the past week I have seen these guys practicing with these lantern antennaes in front of the train station, taking turns balancing them on hand, elbow, shoulder, chin, etc.  Considering the wind this was an impossibly difficult feat, and these candle-lit lanterns fall down into the spectators constantly,     Here are more underexposed shots with faux action photo flavor.       I remember thinking the whole thing ridiculous at the time.  The only motivation, as far as I can discern, for this whole balancing activity seemed to be the difficulty and the danger of it.  But now that I think about it, this whole tradition of getting wooden antennaes up and balancing them against the wind has a strangely sexual undertone.  I guess it's not much stranger than the ESPN Outdoor games.  Anyway, I stuck around for a few photos and that was it.  Went back home and passed out.  The next day was pretty much all rained out until late afternoon.  Met up with Courtney and Tyler and climbed up to the castle ruins to watch the firework (hanabi, flower fire) in Yonago pier.  For the entire duration of the firework Courtney and Tyler were obsessed with taking pictures of the explosives.  I didn't want to get all pedagogical and tell them what was really on my mind.  Turning precious metals and explosives into oohs and aahs is meant to be a celebration of fleeting moments, and taking pictures of it just seemed contrary to the spirit of the whole thing.  Plus, our digital cameras aren't really up to the task anyway.  Bam, boom, blah, and that was it.  Went home and slept because I had an early day tomorrow at Sakaiminato.

      Atsui=hot.  Matsui=festival.  You can complete the connection.  There was a festival in Yonago this past weekend.  It’s actually called Gaina Matsui, which translates into Bad Boy Festival.  Why “Bad Boy” I have no idea.  Your guess is as good as mine.  Woke up at 10am, shit-shave-showered and then called Amy: we’re meeting at the usual spot near the barbershop at Ekimae (area in front of the station) around 1:15.  Decided to do a little bit exploring myself so I left early for a little bit biking.  Ran into another JET group--Adam, Pam, and Manjinder--near the city hall.  Mori(sp)-san, the supervisor to these three, was an employee of the city government and knew about this pre-festival kick-off for the city hall employees.     When we got there, the pre-party was already under way.  People took turn shouting into the loud speaker, to the people waiting their turn (at the loud speaker) and anyone who cared to listen (which was everybody), who Hai's and Yoshi's at the top of their Lung's.  It was just an awesome atmosphere of people getting wasted,  in public, and in front of their co-workers and supervisors.  You can tell the hierarchy of the city hall just by standing there: the lower ranking workers (mostly younger-looking) were standing around and cheering and shouting without abandon, while the supervisors were sitting down and laying back in the lawn chairs, knocking back sake and spitting watermelon seeds.  And of course, the women were standing behind all of this, looking pretty and grinning in their yukata (summer version of kimono, traditional Japanese dress that makes women look like candy-wrapped presents).  And just as any top-down hierarchical despotic political systems in human history, revolution is inevitable...     Water from a sake keg (I'm guessing that not even the Japanese are crazy enough to splash sake so liberally) were dispensed with impunity on victims who were literally dragged out of the crowd.  Some were dismissed with just a few splashes, some were grabbed by the collar and dunked into the keg (a big, ~20L bucket would be a better description), and some were forced to their knees and choked on pouring beer/sake.  Pandemonium!  Unfortunately, with the shutter delay that plagues most digital cameras on the market, I was unable to capture these Kodak moments.  I did get a under-exposed picture of myself dueling with whom I thought to be the MC of the event:    (I'm so proud of this picture, under-exposed or not)  After this, we headed towards the Yonago City Cultural Exchange Center, 2 blocks away.  At this point, with the compounded effect of      This "cultural exchange" event turned out to be just another typical sip-and-meet.  I was unable to get into the flow, having made up my mind about drinking a minimal amount of alcohol.  Talked, correction:listened, a good deal with Kathrine, who had many helpful advices on how to choose and participate in Japanese junior high school clubs.  Talked briefly with Ted, who sympathized with my late night.  Courtney repeatedly commented on my lethargic status and tried to chipper me up.  Talked with Shinji Matsubara, head of the insurance division of city hall (whose name I only remembered because I ran into him at city hall today), who spoke excellent English, good enough to offer me genuine insights on how the TC movie Last Samurai was received and perceived by the Japanese public.  Apparently, they really appreciated Hollywood for making an effort to demonstrate the aspects of Japanese culture and philosophy that are superior to their Western counterparts, even though the said demonstration had to be carried out by Tom Cruise, an idealized version of your common-variety whitey, in the movie.  Also spoke with a group of Chinese co-workers from Da-Shi (I'm guessing that it is written big-creek, somewhere near Beijing) that came to Japan to learn something about hard drive motors, and another Malaysian guy who came to Japan for the similar reason of learning CD-ROM motors.  Spoke Mandarin the whole time, which surely impressed the hell out of anyone who paid attention (only Ted commented on it though) to my 2.05-lingualism (.95 short of tri-lingualism).       Blah blah blah blah and we learned our dance moves for the parade--yes, we had a spot in the parade for Yonaga Gaina Festival down main street!  Rounds of rock paper scissors determined that I was one of the two carrying the banner, an atrocity of an idea in the typhoon wind.     The wind was so strong, my pole broke in half, twice.  After that I didn't even make an effort to stretch out the banner so much and just slacked it using my collarbone as the, uh, uh, middle point (can't remember the term)--even then my collarbone still ended up bruised the next day.  It was hard work, much harder than anyone behind me was doing banging away on their hacked-up Japanese dance steps.  I was so pissed about the whole thing, and only Corinne and Tyler offered any semblance of sympathy.    But these guys showed up:     Who basically drove in front of us to block the wind.  These guys rock!  Considering that the DUI percent in Japan is 0%, just imagine the sacrifices the driver made!  The tension started to build, and I started to forget about the pain against my neck and collarbone, we're next in line!     And then we danced and banged drums and carried the banner against the wind for 9 blocks     with audiences!     As in the norm, hard work in groups somehow always end up being rewarded by nothing more than a group photo.     More to come for that night's activities.  Must go now.
