         My dearest Wesley has strep throat, but somehow after the last few days I haven't thought much about Wes. It's pretty stupid of me, but on Wednesday I went downtown with Ashley Aikens and met Adam. Jason has been trying to hook us up, but I finally met him that night. He's extremely attractive. On Thursday I met up with him and wing night and stupid Mitch wanted to leave, so I ended up going home, but yesterday we went downtown and I hung out with him all afternoon &amp; saw "The Village". That movie was terrible, but seeing Adam was lovely, we talked till somewhere around 3 in the morning. My mom got pissed that I was still up and made me go to bed. My dad's tiny fuse was lit this morning and I'm grounded for a week, but I wanna sneak out. Because last night Adam said I was amazing, and that he wasn't sure, but he's definitely interested in something with me. I was so happy, so if I want to see him at all this week, I'll have to sneak out. It's kinda weird liking Adam, because I worked so hard to free myself for Wes. Josh even knows about my crush on Wes, and he's like "Leela, you'll so have a chance with him, be upfront about it and just tell him. I know Wes, trust me, He'll go out with you". So I dunno, now there are two boys in my life...this is nuts  beyond  nuts. I'm going to have to wait this one out and see what happens. Adam's going to teach me how to drive and when his friend gets to town he said they'll come and pick me up, I hope I don't get caught, hehe! I just woke up now, and it's 4:30, haha nice, I'll go eat breakfast.

        So, my man just came over. We hung out for like 5 hours. We were pretty bored, but we had a good time. hehe, he got really sick, swollen eyes, sore throat, head ache, and he fell asleep in my bed, aw how cute! His friend wanted me to make out with him, but since I'm totally drooling over my man, I turned him down. I think my man realizes that I want him, we talked once he got home & It was pretty reassuring, I think we're going to do stuff together whenever he comes over on like Thursday or Friday night. I don't sound to stoked about this whole thing, but I am, I'm talking to Anna on the phone. She seriously has been a saviour to me, last night I heard about all these terrible things&nbsp;Andy said, and I almost cried. Anna's been there for me though, she's helped so much. She made me realize that Andy is a stupid piece of shit, and that fucker doesn't determine my happiness. I think I'm starting electric guitar soon, Anna, Tara, &amp; I are starting a band. It's going to be amazing. We're pretty serious about the whole thing, we just need a little bit of motivation. I'm going to show Andy "Didueatmygenitals" what he's missing. Haha, that's what my babe called him. How special. Anyhow, I'm out for now. YAY! My Boi was in my bed.

        Yeah, shut up, I spelled Monday wrong on purpose. Soo..today has been alright. Anna's comming over for a sleepover in about an hour or somethin', so I'm stoked about that. Dain and I have started talking again n' the guy's turned into a total ass. Last night be openly suggested sexual relationships with me, and eventhough he doesn't want a romantic relationship, he still wants me to be his first? I'm kinda wondering who the hell he thinks he is, I don't want to share my sex with someone who THINKS it could be something special. I want this dude to love me and want to be with me every second, isn't that how it should be? Dain's wack. Second. My baby's friend was expecting to meet him and my man downtown tonight, well that isn't happening. So they might come over here if I can find someone to make out with my boi's friend (hehe! YES!). I almost cried this morning thinking "he" just wanted to be fuck buddies, but then I realized I was being paranoid and I'm going to work with the flow of things. You know what though, I have a damn cavity. FUCK! Now I have to get my damn teeth drilled, but it's alright, no biggie! Anyways, I better get going, I wanna get online and socialize with a few people. I'll write lata sometime.

        Welcome Home Leela...to nothing but fucking shit. Life has been ordinary. I went out to dinner with my dad's old college buddy. That guy has had 200 to many joints. The wedding was..well..if I lied, magical. If I was honest, as gay as elton john. Somewhere inbetween the speeches praising John Kerry and my cousin trying to sleep with me, I decided to screw the whole thing, and the rest is a blur. I was supposed to go downtown tonight to meet my beautiful love, but instead it looks asthough I'm doomed to yet another night of sitting at home. Tara lacks enough motovation to go downtown, so I'm imprisioned here. This afternoon however, I slipped into somewhat of loneliness. As retarded as that sounds, I was thinking about this, and I'm tired of this solo act I've had, but untill "he" realizes he needs me, just as much as I need him, this is a permanet feeling. The Fall Out Boy CD&nbsp;is somewhat relieving though, considering these boys are MY boys, and have helped me through the thickest and thinnest of times =).

        Damn, so it's 9:49 on Friday morning and I'm up! Bummer, In a lil' bit I'm leaving for the airport. I've got a wedding to go to in Cincinatti with My dad &amp; lil' sister. It's sweet how I know none of the people I'm going to see, so I'm not to stoked about this trip. I won't be home till Sunday, which means you don't have to listen to my annoying posts for another day or so. I talked to Jason on the phone last night, I love that boy so much. We're going to have a good time at Grange together, and hopefully go shoe shopping too! =) Hehe, thats right, shoe shopping, he's willing to unleash the wild shoe crave inside me, and thats what makes me love him, he's my super cute big bro. *wink wink. Hm, I wonder if Tara is going out downtown tonight, ugh, she probably will and she'll go see my super hottie babe-o-licious man. Not so kickass =( but I guess I'll live. I've decided that Mo Rocca is the cutest thing that ever happened to VH1 and I'll never get sick of "I love the "which ever decade they're raving about"". Last night on '91 they talked about Kurt Cobain, oh man, truly a legend. So an ode to Kurt is definitely necessary. Oh, and by the way, before I go, check out  urlLink www.smartpunk.com  it's sweet, got plenty of shit for peeps like me. Anyways, I'll leave ya'll alone. Holla atcha gurl.

        Well, I'll have you know, this was one boring Thursday. We were about to go downtown, but the weather didn't look promising, and there was just no motovation. My man will have to wait. Haha, I doubt he's waiting in general, but a girl can dream. Hm, In the Shadows by The Rasmus is really sounding good right now and so is Death of Season by AFI. There isn't much you can say about my boring life, except, when is the right man going to step in it. When am I going to get my guitar? When am I going to get enough determination to finish my summer school stuff, oh geeze. Damn homiez, I really want the Vampyre SN or the Buddy Guy Polka Dot Stratocaster. Daymn, When am I going to get up and make something of my life. SOON, I SWEAR. I'm going back on AIM or to listen to some songs. Check out Coheed and Cambria my friend.

        Wow, So I just read Josh's livejournal thing, and I feel really bad for the kid.    Wednesday, July 21st, 2004   6:47 pm   I dont know what i have to do or say to make someone love me like i do them. all the things that were done and said between us meant nothing to you. it braks my heart to know i still love you. maybe one day ill be over you or maybe not, but i have to try to hold my head up and live life one day at a time. it hurts more to just wake up everyday than it does to be stabbed or shot. I hate my sensitivity to life in general. fuck i cant even kill a ant without feeling guilty.      &nbsp;   That's harsh, but I&nbsp;totally feel for him and understand what he's going through. I wish he could see his situation like I see it. He needs someone with more depth, his last girlfriend hung up on him because he couldn't get to the mall to meet her? She's going to crush him for something stupid like that? I really wish I could help him with his heartache, I hate seeing people like this, because after Mike ended our relationship, I felt totally the same. His sensitivity is amazing, I admire the fact that he's brave enough to show it. He has a heart and that's something I find amazing, he's got something unique. I love it. Maybe none of this is my business, but I think he's looking for love in the wrong places.

        Hey There Sunshine,&nbsp;it's time for a mid-morning sex talk. Haha, I'm being serious. I've done some thinking about what I said in my last entry about "considering sex with josh" and I'm kicking myself in the ass for it. Taking my values into consideration, I really wouldn't want to have sex with someone that I'm having a "fling" with and lives in North Carolina. Infact, on a walk to Unimart with Anna we talked about sex and marriage. We want to wait, but homie, I don't know If I can do it =( I mean, I want to, but what if there's to much pressure, or I just don't want to wait. What if I don't ever get married? I'll be a virgin for life? Ouch! In the car on the way home from getting groceries I was thinking about it (yeah, I think about sex a lot, so deal with it). And if the situation came with me and my baby, would I have sex with him? I mean, I know it's right to wait, but what if that's what he wants, I wouldn't mind. Argh, like, I know I should wait, but I want it to be special, and I think with him, it would be. But what if that's not right? Will I go to hell? Will he? Well, I don't think so, but I wanna know! What if I terribly regret it when it's through. How could I regret it? He's amazing, and I have so much love for him! And the real question is...Why am I concerned now, I'm not even dating him. We've only kissed a couple times, and I'm not sure if he just wants to be "fuck buddies". Gosh, Maybe I'll worry about this later, I mean, it's only 1:14 in the afternoon. I'm not sure if I'll even see him tonight...I hope so

        Sooo...Today wasn't too much fun. My mom woke me up extremely early to hit up the mall. It was boring, considering I went to the mall with Anna yesterday. I bought some dresses, some undergarments (hehe), and jewelry. I still need my cool adio's! Josh talked to me earlier, he got his eyebrow pierced and broke up with his girlfriend. It was kinda exciting, because now I can actually flirt with him without feeling bad. He joked around about using some condoms, I think I might just consider it. Ian nabbed me some condoms from the aids center, I was supposed to go get them tonight downtown, but Aikens turned me down, so I was forced to stay home and retreat to a world of boredom. I thought a lot about my baby today. He has incredible blue eyes and I'm just thinking about how in love I am with him and his endless, deep, blue eyes. I just can't imagine a less than perfect moment with him. Tonight I was thinking about lying on warm pavement on a summer night staring at the stars with him. Aw, I'm in such a sappy mood, but it's soo true. He's just so amazing and everything I could hope for in a guy. He's such a jackass sometimes, but when he's acting serious, he's such an incredible person, with a huge heart. I just hope there's room for me in there (= hehe! Once again I've found a song to describe my feelings so here it goes.      Well there's a light in your eye that keeps shining Like a star that can't wait for the night I hate to think I've been blinded baby Why can't I see you tonight? And the warmth of your smile starts a-burnin' And the thrill of your touch gives me fright And I'm shaking so much, really yearning Why don't you show up, make it all right? Yeah, it's all right. And if you promised you'd love so completely and you said you would always be true You swore that you would never leave me, baby: What ever happened to you? And you thought it was only in movies As you wish all your dreams would come true It ain't the first time believe me, baby I'm standin here feeling blue Yeah I'm blue Now I will stand in the rain on the corner I'll watch the people go shuffling downtown Another ten minutes no longer And then I'm turning around The clock on the wall's moving slower My heart it sinks to the ground And the storm that I thought would blow over Clouds the light of the love that I found Now my body is starting to quiver And the palms of my hands getting wet I've got no reason to doubt you baby, It's all a terrible mess I'll run in the rain till I'm breathless When I'm breathless I'll run till I drop, hey The thoughts of a fool's kind of careless I'm just a fool waiting on the wrong block, oh yeah Light of the love that I found...  -Led Zeppelin, Fool In the Rain

        Good Morning (= I decided to restart my blog, just incase ya'll wanted to read this. I think I've finally gotten my summer started and I'm lovin' it. The other night I got completely wasted, oh gosh! **Good Times with the Gurls. Anyways, The only problem with this summer is the incredible amounts of boys comming in. It's a tad overwhelming. I'm trying to focus on this particular guy, "My Baby", who shall remain anonymous for now. I've been interested in him for almost an entire year, and slowly we're getting somewhere. We've become pretty tight and we've shared a few "intimate moments", but it has never been at the relationship level. He's such a horndog! We've been hanging out a lot, at least once to twice a week. He called me last night, but I couldn't go. Fuuuuuck! He doesn't even realize how amazing he is. He's got a side to him that I only know, it's so cute, romantic, and passionate. The first time I saw it, I fell for him so fast. It kinda sucks though, because there are other guys that I'm semi-involved with too. One is Josh and I'm not sure what I should do. I met him, he's incredible, plays in a band called "False Exposure" and is overall the cutest thing I've everlaid eyes upon. We met before I went to India and when I came back he had a girlfriend. I mean, I didn't expect him to like me or anything, because we had just met, but he still flirts with me like hell. Last night he told me his girlfriend wasn't going to last long, and he didn't mind if I stole him from her. Wow, I felt sorta bad, considering he tells her how much he loves her, and then I'm this "mistress" that he's teasing like hell. I dunno what to do, but then again, shouldn't I be concentrating on my baby?

          I am aware of the fact that I wrote in here 10 minutes ago. I am also aware that I should be in the shower. I am also aware that I should be doing my summer school work. Stupid Leela. I just don't have any motovation except music. I'm not going to get this Algebra done and I'll have to be put back into College Prep 2. I need to get up and do something with myself. You know what, fuck that. I'm going to sit in the car for 4 hours tomorrow. I'll do it then, I'll tattoo it on myself, I will get it done. But while I'm here, and at home. I'm going to do what I want. I don't give a fuck about school work. I have school work to do when school starts. This is summer, I am going to party. If you have a problem with that...change your attitude. I didn't get to go to Warped Tour...So I have an excuse for being so mad. My mom is starting to nag, what did we do to her, she's an adult, she volunteered to have children, this shit is that womans job too. I'm grounded, I haven't seen other people besides my family in about...a week. They cannot expect me to be happy. Alright Leela you little Bitch, Shower. Now.

        This fucking sucks. I already typed up this entry, but the damn computer erased it so now I have to write it all over again. What a little bitch. Anyways. I didn't write yesterday, for some odd reason, so I'll fill you in. Yesterday was full of a whole lot of nothing. So you didn't miss much. Riverside Romance has been going really well and me and anna have been doing a lot of song writting lately. We've got a whole list of tracks, which go something like this:

         69...Isn't that a very sexual number? Yeah, I don't even know about things these days. Wes seems like something distant, like beyond my reach. Adam however, he's been really sweet to me. So I'm pretty into him. Dylan has been acting weirdly too, ever since I stopped talking to him, and got involved with Adam, he's become jealous or something. He told me how he wished he could hold me in his arms on the beach and all this really cute stuff. He said saying "I love you doesn't even describe how much I really do". It was amazing, he's so sweet. Ashley and Anna think he likes me. I'm not sure, I don't even care about this shit anymore, love is just terrible. I don't wanna think about it much, it sucks. Ellis is also apparently the drummer for our band, he's got places to practice and guitars and amps. This might actually turn into something big, I'm really excited. I bought the Taking back Sunday CD and the New Found Glory CD. I'm going to go listen to TBS, Ashley's on the phone.

         Right now I keep thinking about Autumn and how much I love it. The end of Summer the beginning of Fall. There are just so many "life-defining" moments that happen in Autumn. Sitting in the grass, the air is cold, the kind of weather that you put on a sweatshirt, and just that will do. Where the air is crisp and it smells fresh. And the horizon seems only a mile away lined by birch trees. The sun is orange and glows, so that you could stare at it forever and never get bored. The breeze rustles your hair and his hand is in yours. No words are spoken, but all the words in the world are heard.

        Yeah, So love is a beautiful thing. When the fuck is it going to find me. I met this Josh dude tonight and he's the sweetest thing ever ever ever! He's phone palz with Mark from Blink-182, Friends with a dude in Simple Plan, His cousin is the frontman in Metallica, and he talks to Bam Margera on MSN. But fuck, what the fuck! I like Adam..Wes..and now this dude? What is going on, I don't even know who to care about anymore.  Fuckety Fucking Fucks . Someone just have sex with me and allow me to be a sexual sacrifice, I need a drink or something, I need to feel the burn of vodka. I'm tired of being held down &amp; held back. I'm gonna do whatever the hell I want. Fuck, I don't even wanna care about shit anymore. I just wanna be in fucking love and live my life my way. Fuck you and your stupid blue eyes, Fuck you and your skater hair, Fuck you and your deep sincerity, Fuck!! I bet their lies! Kurt Cobain if you can hear me...MAKE ME GREAT. Bed. Later. Worrrrd.

        Being grounded has been amaaazing, um just kidding. I doubt I would be doing much on a Sunday night anyways, but who knows. I talked to Adam on the phone last night! Wohoo, he's soo cute. My mom's like "Is Adam the new hottie in Leela's life?" "Yes mommy, I am going to fuck him next time I see him too." Haha, I wonder what her response to that would be. Ooh, big news. Anna, Tara, & I have decided to name of our band. Riverside Romance. I came up with it, Oh baby. I can't wait to get this band thing started. Some Josh dude IMed me on bolt, so that's another Josh that I have to talk about. (besides Josh Brauct, Josh Gainer, Josh Mayhue, &amp; whoever the hell else, I'm forgetting). I appealed to him somehow, I guess it's due to my beautiful taste in music and everything. This band is weak, but in a couple years, I bet we'll be rockin', we have to set up a practice schedual and everything. OH and Andy apologized to me last night, Whoppee! I'm really over what happened between me and him. I'm concentrating on Adam and yes, I'm going to say the name of my baby, Wes. It's obvious anyways, he's like the only person in the whole world who doesn't know how much I love him, I proclaim it to everyone else! 1love, I'll write more later.
