        My freshman year at UMD, I lived in a converted triple in Queen Anne's hall. Unlike most of the underclassmen dorms, QA was on the south side of campus, in a cluster of dorms filled with students in the Honors and foreign language programs. Those of us who volunteered to live in QA were a unique breed, due to its status as A) the only dorm where each room had its own sink, and B) the only combination Honors and certified Smoke/Alcohol-free dorm. Yes, we were the nerds of nerds - top of the line geeks complete with role-playing games, anime collections, and daily political dissections.       One of my roommates, Amy, was something like a quadruple major - I think she was math, physics, computer engineering, and computer science. AND she was in the marching band. Needless to say, she was a little - how should I put this - *concerned* when I moved in with over 100 square feet of tie-dyed wall hangings (for what it's worth, those hangings got our room into the  urlLink Washington Post !). We became friends, though, and she actually visited me (and another mutual friend of ours from UMD who also came out to Cal for grad school) a few weeks ago. While we were all at a BBQ, my California friends grilled her about what it was like to live with me. One of her stories concerned "Christina-isms" - the non-sequiters that she found so amusing, she made a web site out of them. The web site has been gone for a while, but Amy recently e-mailed me the Christina-isms for me to share with y'all. Enjoy!! :)       I have no toilet paper! How can I clean my ears?! My underwear must feel so neglected. Integration by parts, baby! Bring it  on ! Massive amounts of llamas! I have to repaint my dog now. He could fill a toilet with his presence and that's it. Nothing to fear about my underwear-wrapped alarm clock. I love you Delaware River Port Authority!! Yes, yes, that's it! Mad rhinos! That's what I need! A book that explains the laws of physics in terms of frisbees! Dude, it sounds like they're beating puppies down the hall. Slowly but surely, we're taking over the world! I know too many men! Notice the dead fish. Uh-oh, I forgot I'm not outside. I can't spit. If only one could immerse oneself in lettuce. Oh, I was just chewing on myself again. I'm going to go pee in the lobby. Queen Anne's... because we have sinks!!! And you said you would never fear me! Ha!  "I ate a piece of cheese!"  "I HAVE ISSUES!!" "I know I'm a dork, but what's really amazing is the sheer purity of my dorkiness."         Have your own Christina-isms? Feel free to post them for everyone's enjoyment. :)      ********************************   In another freshman-year related item -  STEVE IS COMING TO VISIT!!!  YAAAAAY!!! Yes, the infamous St. Louis native that y'all have heard so much about will be in town October 15-19. Mark your calendars and prepare your togas...or something...      ********************************   Props to Kat for providing an excellent evening of food, drinks, and venting about men/life last night. Waking up on someone else's couch never felt so good!

        ...where the equestrian events are on at 2 AM instead of 5 AM. (Freakin' Bravo!)      So my first two nights in the new place weren't as bad as I expected. I made a 9 PM run to Target Tuesday night to get some items required for basic apartment civility - TP, trash cans, etc. Thankfully, by the time I hit the sack, I was so physically and emotionally exhausted that I fell asleep almost immediately. Last night I got to bed a little later (dinner + Olympics with the ENV house - thanks Kristin!), but still slept. I'm really looking forward to cleaning things up this weekend and making my place look like an actual apartment instead of a well-appointed storage space.       It sounds terrible, but now that I'm back in CA, I feel like I can deal with my brother's impending deployment a little better. Back in NJ, every time I saw Dave there was this litte awful voice in the back of my head that said "this could be the last time you see him!" Thoughts like that don't really contribute in a constructive way to emotional stability, so maybe the "out of sight - out of mind" effect is a good thing. Not that he's really out my mind at all... you know what I mean...argh.       I'm  really  over-caffeinated today so forgive the slight stream-of-consciousness of all this. Bleh!!!

       So tomorrow I return to California after spending 10 days back home in New Jersey. Overall it was a great trip - got to see friends, family, the Pine Barrens, and LBI. I spent some great time with Mom and Dad, though the requisite blow-up with my dad today made things a little more stressful than I would have preferred. I said something stupid, and he flipped out, and I apologized, and he remained flipped out. Oh well. I don't think he realizes how freaked out I am. Neither of them do, and I can't blame them, I'm trying to stay strong for my mom's sake. If she sees me flipping out then I KNOW she's gonna lose it. I almost started bawling today at dinner in TGI Friday's when Dave was talking about the things he'll be doing in Iraq. Ugggh. Every time I think about what he's about to do, I get so upset. Today has been so bad, I've been on the brink of tears all evening long. And this is not drama-queen bullshit. I honestly don't know how I'm going to handle these coming 7 months without becoming a basket case. I guess I'll basically have to consciously not think about it. I am not looking forward to any of this.  I wish I had gotten a chance to spend more time with Dave while I was home. He's spending most of his time on leave with his friends, not family, so I didn't get half the time with him that I wanted. But what can I do, he's a 20-year-old kid who wants to hang with his friends, not his parents and overbearing older sister. I feel so helpless. I want to help protect him and keep him safe, but other than prayer (which I know is important but is only so mentally empowering) there is nothing I can do. He's such a good kid, he puts on a good "meathead" facade but he really is a very kind, thoughtful, compassionate human being. And so brave. I hope he knows how much I love him and admire him, how proud I am of him. I feel like we're these two sides of the same genetic coin, and I don't know what I'd do without him. Good Lord, I hope I never have to find out.  So tomorrow I get back to SF at 6:30, which is nice 'cause it will give me time to prepare for my first night in my new apartment. I have to get pillows and some other things. I hope I'll sleep, but I'm not sure. New apartment, new sounds, all alone, sleeping on a futon with my shit all in boxes and nothing but thoughts like "will I ever see my brother again?" in my head. I'm looking forward to getting things in the apartment settled, but I am not looking forward to tomorrow night at all.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ On a somewhat lighter note, I should mention that last night I hung out with Janelle and Courtney (who some of you would know as Kyle's cousin), and it was one of the finer evenings I had during these last 10 days. It was great to get back in touch with Janelle, who is still one of the craziest/sanest people I know, and I love her dearly for it ("Schuykyll Expressway AARRGGHH!!). God I missed that girl! As for Courtney, if you had told either of us back in middle school that someday, we would be good friends, well, Courtney would have shoved a basketball up your ass and I would have just ran away. Who would have thought that 15 years later we'd be trespassing into Ocky at 10 PM (what a depressing sight that is) and then talking about life until 3 AM?

        Top Five Toms Thoughts While Watching the Olympics, Day One:   5. When the @#$%^&amp;* are the equestrian events going to be on TV?!? 4. Aw man, I haven't been to the gym in two weeks. Eesh. 3. Kid Rock thinks he's an American Bad Ass? He obviously hasn't met Blaine Wilson. 2. Oh, Michael Phelps, why can't you be 4 years older? 1. memo to Bob Costas: SHUT UP!!!  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Went to the Phils game today. In the rain. They lost (refer to the  Jinx  in yesterday's post). Silver lining: Wow, what a  urlLink park . Philadelphians now get to feel a little more like San Franciscans: They get to watch an underperforming team in an overperforming stadium! Now  that's  what I call parity!!  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I feel like I should mention something about Hurricane  urlLink Charley , but really, Hurricane  urlLink Schwartz  is so much cooler. I love this guy!

       Which of the following got creamed today?  a. The Eagles (I know, it's just the preseason) b. The Phillies c. the state of Florida d. all of the above  If you answered d, congratulations, you tore yourself away from the fashion spectacle that is the Olympics' opening ceremony long enough to notice something other than HOW FABULOUS THE BRAZILIANS LOOKED!!!!!!! Did you SEE those SKIRTS?!? AAAHHHH!!!  Ahem. Righto. Moving on...   Terp News:  How come I didn't know until today that Bruce Perry (a Philly native and  "Bruuuuuuce!!!!"  of my senior year at U-Maryland) was drafted by the Eagles? And that Eric Milton (one of the Phillies' best current pitchers), who's pitching at the game we're attending tomorrow, went to Maryland too? "Hail to the black and gold..."   Jinx?  This year, every time I've watched (in person) the Phillies, Giants, or A's, the team I want to win loses. When I watched the Phils in SF earlier this year, they lost (the only game of that series that they lost). The Giants have lost the other 2 games I've attended at SBC Park this year, against Colorado and Arizona. The A's have lost the 2 games I've seen at the Coliseum, against the Yankees and the Giants. Understandably, I'm a little worried about tomorrow. If things don't pan out, I'll seriously consider buying an A-Rod jersey and moving to Boston...  ...it would look pretty cute with one of those Brazilian skirts!

       You know, I could go on about this for hours, but really, this is it:  Item 1: Gov. McGreevey is gay. Item 2: He cheated on his wife.  re: Item 1: Better late than never to learn stuff about yourself. re: Item 2: Unfortunate for all involved. re: Item 1 + Item 2: This means he has to resign  why ?  Sources in  urlLink this article  from the Post make the point that, had the governor not made some bad choices with his political cronies, he probably could have survived the revelations. I'm sure there's a ton of political stuff that could be said about all this, but all I can really think about is how courageous his speech today was. Yeah, I know, I know, cheating on his wife wasn't too courageous. But all of us have done things we're not proud of. Not all of us have to go in front of the national media and declare what those things are, let alone  come out  at the same time. Wow.  The way the NJ Republicans are drooling over this whole shebang is pathetic. The head of the NJ Republican State Committee threatened to  sue  to  force  a quick resignation? On what grounds, exactly? Assholes. And if anyone tries to cite this situation as an example of "look at those gays - can't keep their dicks in their pants", I'll scream. ARGH.  But the  biggest  revelation of the evening - Diane Allen got FAT!! Remember when she was an anchor on WCAU? Dude!  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Hit up LBI today. FINALLY. Water was warm, surf was rough, and for once, I got sunburnt worse than my dad. Finished the day with a dinner of fresh crabcakes and shrimp followed by key lime pie. Tomorrow Mom will cook the half-bushel of crabs we bought.  Heaven, brought to you by the Jersey Shore and Skipper's Seafood.

       ... and hire a logistician!  After 23.5 years of Iggles worship, I made my first journey to Mecca today - training camp at Lehigh University. We (me, Mom, and Dad - Dave stayed in bed, grrr) got there an hour and a half early (for the afternoon practice) and scored perfect seats in the bleachers - only to be told at the last minute by camp staff that practice was going to be held on a different field where there were no bleachers from which to watch. We ended up having to stand a whole football field away from where the practices were and could barely see anything. It was kinda a bummer. Although I did get to watch David Akers (jokingly) tackle and beat the crap out of his kicking coach. Of all the players, Jevon Kearse acknowledged the crowd the most when he came out of the field house. It'll be interesting to see what kind of contributions he'll make on the field this year. Other musings:  1. I watched T.O. for 2 years in SF, and I have some super-mixed feelings about him being here. All it'll take is consecutive losses and a dumb comment out of his mouth (accompanied by endless WIP rehashing) for things to get ugly. I have hope, though - I think McNabb can do a better job keeping him in line than Garcia. Ahh, Garcia. Poor Garcia.  2. Props to the people in Brian Dawkins jerseys. He's the only recognizable part of the secondary left. Other sign of impending secondary doom: The Eagles signed a rookie corner from Rutgers. RUTGERS! Wait, maybe that *wasn't* the kicking coach Akers was beating up...  3. Westbrook is still listed on the roster as a kick returner. I thought I heard somewhere that he wouldn't be doing that anymore 'cause he was too much to risk or something like that. Huh? Of course, I'm still a member of the BRING-BACK-VAI club, so what do I know.  Our first pre-season game is against the Pats on Friday - BRING IT ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)  ~~~~~~~~~~~~ California - we may love our Guvernator, but we're as solid Blue as most of Kerry's suits. So there isn't too much cash being spent on TV ads in CA for either campaign, especially in the Bay Area (I have yet to see a single ad). So I forgot how much it sucks to live next to a Grey State (Pennsylvania) during an election year. If I see one more pro-Kerry commercial with the little blonde girl, or one more pro-Bush ad with all the firemen, I just might join Katie up in Canada. With all their hockey hullabaloo....

       My brother asked me tonight why 4 of his friends died in Iraq. "I want the whole story, from the beginning, the politics and all that stuff. Why the hell are we there? Why are my friends dead? Why am I going there? What's the deal?"  So we talked about neoconservative theory, geography, and the culture of fear/control that's been carefully cultivated here since 9/11. I'm glad he feels he can open up about this stuff with me. He's really wired. I wish there was something I could say or do just to help him relax.   pray, pray, pray, pray, pray, pray, pray.   in other news: (paraphrasing) Mark: "I have never seen two people be so combative in such a subtle way as you and Kyle."  Me neither. What gives?

       Is my blog title too long?  Mark and I saw Garden State last night, and boy was it great. In his rookie effort, Zach Braff pulled off one heck of a writing/directing/starring triumverate. Mmm, triumverate. I think the film will really resonate with those of us caught in that strange realm between college and the "real world". We may be out of school and working - but how many of us really feel like "grown-ups"?  It's nice to be home for a while. It's great to open your windows at night and hear cicadas in the trees instead of sirens on Ashby Avenue.  Dave's on his way out to get another tattoo. God help my mother.
