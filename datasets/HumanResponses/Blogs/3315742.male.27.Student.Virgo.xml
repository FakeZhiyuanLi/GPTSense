      Bad habits, such as smoking, drinking, and gambling, need not be considered bad as long as they're kept under control, which unfortunately is seldom the case. If you're betting beyond your limit, determined to get back what you lost, & sooner or later go back to get what they owe you, then it's a bad habit. If you bring $40 & have the discipline to quit when that amount is lost, then it's not a bad habit, just a poor way to spend $40. If drinking interferes with areas of your life outside of the drinking environment, like sleeping in, getting out of shape, or spending too much, then it also is a bad habit. If it doesn't, then just keep it in moderation. Same with smoking. Bad habits aren't necessarily bad, depending on the amount of control exerted over the situation.

      Developing self-discipline is similar to developing endurance; a little bit at a time. Too much at once is overwhelming & is likely to lead to frustration & failure. Whatever the area you wish to develop self-discipline in, such as exercise, eating right, frugality, punctuality, whatever, start small. Take eating right for ie. You wouldn't immediately start by spending $50 in the produce section, cooking up a storm, & determine to eat that way from then on; it just isn't practical. Set little goals like no more mayo. It may seem too easy @ 1st to make much of a difference but this is where the rubber meets the road. Stick with it, then set another little goal, H20 instead of pop. Then bigger, no more fast food. Get it? That's how to develop self-discipline.

      A friend need only have 2 requirements, supportiveness & loyalty, particularly in one's absence. Is that so hard?

      The determing factor of one's financial success is not the size of one's paycheck, but of one's philosophy on the use of money. The most important, fundamental rule that is critical to achieving eventual financial independence is to "Pay Yourself First". While the majority spend most of their paycheck and hope to have some left over, the successful minority save first, then spend. The ideal amount to save before spending is 10%. Depending on one's circumstance, this amount may be higher or lower, as long as any amount is saved before spent.

      The best diet, hands down, is a vegetarian diet consisting of four main components, fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes. These are all water rich foods that provide the body with the most valuable nutrients needed for maximum performance without the unhealthy side effects of most of today's foods. Too many details to get into on this topic for now.

      The 3 pillars of fitness are strength, endurance, and flexibility. Strength is developed best thru the use of free weights and resistence exercises. Endurance is best developed thru cardio exercises for periodically extending periods of time. Flexibility is maintained most effectively when performed during or after exercise, when blood is flowing thru the body and the muscles are more elastic. Technique is the most important aspect of one's fitness regimen, consistency is second, attitude is third.
