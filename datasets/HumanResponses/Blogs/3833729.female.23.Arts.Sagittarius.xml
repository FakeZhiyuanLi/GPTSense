      I sit here, just looking at him. Cars, buildings, busy people passing by.  He seems preoccupied. I wonder, is he thinking about us? I smile as I stare at the one thing that changed my life. My thoughts drift to the day I told him what I felt. Tears.. I remembered. And a lot of love. I smile again...First gear... Second... third... Eyes on the road. Not even a trace of happiness on his face. I wonder. Religion? Money? Sex? Is love ever enough? Whatever happened to us?  Sigh.  What's  your problem?  Smile. I'm alright. First time I fall this deep. First time I'm messing up. First time I love anyone more than myself. First time I hurt someone so bad. Like a duckling in a vast lake. I feel lost. This love... so unfathomable. This love... so new. Consumes me like fire.  Twenty-three years I waited. I'm not about to give it up. The ups and downs. The laughter and the tears. There's an inner sense of happiness. Ride on... 100.. 120 on a winding road. Makes my stomach sick. or not? Hold on. Seat belts tight. Makes me want to scream sometimes. Good? Bad? Definitely nice. Hang on... crazy feeling I can't have enough of. Like a bad medicine you get addicted to.  I turn to him. I'M SORRY. Hugs. Kisses. Don't ever do it again.  And I love you so.  Yes, he loves me. Every day... feels good just knowing that.

      And Sundays are for weeping, and early Monday mornings. This house is uneasy. Unlike my recliner in the office. Sleep through the day... easy. Step out of the fridge... and I find you. My comfort. My shield. My life. Oh you're on the phone. I'm sorry. Warm iced-tea in a white-tiled dining/locker room. Toothpaste-on-a-toothbrush in my mouth afterwards. Breath meant for kissing. Good morning!  What's for lunch? Let's eat Chinese. Nooodle time. Yawn. Yawn. Yawn. I love you. And you love me too. Perfect day. A movie. In my house... quick shower. Put on fresh clothes. Back in our home... with a recliner in the fridge. Regular days... I am living. I am alive.  Now I woke up... and my pillow is wet.  Sundays are for weeping, and early Monday mornings.

      First quadrant. Friends chatting. Sex rings and stuff. Mya got irked. She was hurt. I’m an asshole. Always have been. Old and wasted, and definitely an asshole. That’s what they think. That’s what she thinks. I say to myself… hey it’s ok, every family’s got one nowadays. They all laugh. They all enjoyed the joke. What joke? I was serious in a way. Mya got irked. She was hurt. And I’m still an asshole.   Too much confidence can kill a man. I believe that everything I do is always right, so it’s always ok. And it only follows that everything I say is just. Why do I think that way? I smile and I say to myself “you’re an asshole!” and it feels good. Do I shun myself from other people to let them know that I’m a tough guy so they won’t mess with me? Probably. Yeah, that surely explains it. A bully. I walk through life knowing that I am king, and I own you. No questions. I own you.  Pause. A long one. Thinking. It felt bad didn’t it? Why do I feel bad? Mya got irked. She was hurt. And I’m an asshole.   Mya still loves me.

       creaks in the wind   time passes whether you want it to or not.  i decided to take a back seat and let the scenery run by.  like watching things happen to somebody else who just happens to look like me.  no pain no happiness no fear no pride. took a vacation from myself headed nowhere. nowhere.  ended up in regret somehow.  tried to get back in the game but got swept in and couldn't find my feet.  i took a long time of stumbling around; taking too many looks behind; falling to my knees.  getting back on the horse isn't the tough part, i believe its staying in the flow so you don't fall off.

      I stare at my half-empty glass of golden bliss that sends chills down my throat, while this stupid guy on the boob-tube pretends he’s the president of the USA and declares war over Vietnam. Wanted to call someone, realized I don’t have a phone. Wanted to buy one, realized I’m short by a buck.  Buck-naked man drinking beer. A knock. Someone at the front door. Stairs leading down. Door swung open. Hi bro, wher’ve ya been? Back to the stupid guy/president.  Outside… must go out some more. No, not some more. Must go out. Always in-front of the boob-tube. Climb more trees, play more games… hide and seek. Ride my bike, fly a kite. Hey bro, let’s go swimming. Hey mom, hey dad, take me to a movie?! Grandma, grandpa… are we gonna go on vacation? My computer broke… that’s it for the games.  And then I turned 27 again.

      I bumped into a friend the other day. Haven’t met him for about a year.  Small talk about past trippings. Rock concerts and alcohol shots. Made me feel old. When my mom and dad would lecture me six years ago I would readily tell them to leave me alone ‘coz I’m old enough to know what I’m doing… how I wish now that I am not old enough to know any better. Mya would definitely disagree. I was told that I feel old because I always think I am old… I think I am old because I’m surrounded by young people who think they are already old enough. I don’t really dig old people. They are always serious about life. Why is everybody in a hurry? Life is spinning around me so fast I could scarcely keep up. Does anybody ever really stop to ask what would he or she be ten years from now? Answer: older. Smarter or richer or poorer are just a product of time. The only thing that is definite with time is age. Ten years from now I will be a lot older… will I be happy? Well, I am happy now. If I look back ten years ago I was also asking myself what I would be in ten years… answer: Happy. Content? Well, just happy. I have someone who makes me happy. But still I feel old.  Mya still disagrees.

      The clock breaks the silence... it's six in the evening, got out of bed. Poured hot coffee that would perk me up the rest of the night, audio slave cd in my boom box... nextdoor neighbor yells. Bath time. Hey dude, put on yer jeans, gonna be late for work. Sunglasses at seven o'clock PM. Time to log in. Calls, calls, calls. Sighs. A long one. Why is this sigh extra-ordinarily long?! Oh yeah... I remember. Just remembered. I'm in a rut. And I can't get out, not yet. So calls, calls, calls... and more calls. Lunch break. Lounge. Sleep. Not really!!! Pretend to be asleep??? Most likely!!! Lunch break's over. Oh shit, two more hours. Well, it's an all night thing. Log out guys. Ooops, not so fast... post shift meeting. Kill me now, please!!! At long last, time to go home. No??? oh yeah, more work. Pantry... number seven please (hot choco). Call center life...   And I'm a Mechanical Engineer back in college.

      Never had I seen a girl who is truly an F1 addict. You can see the passion in those eyes... the way she talks about it, the way she gazes steadily at the boob-tube this one time I sat with her to watch the ending part of a not so great of a race. Imagine, the end part, not so great a race, but still it sparked something in those eyes. She has the heart. She has the spirit. If she was one of those seatbelt strapped German race car drivers behind that blazing red tiny contraption with a stallion as an insignia, she'd be a God, not much like myself, but a God indeed in her own right. And since I know a lot about how a car ticks more than your average guy, she bombards me with questions always with a grin on her face trying to digest what I am about to tell her... digesting it already even before I could answer. I play hard to get. Though it pisses me off sometimes because just the thought of tinkering with an engine sickens me (imagine growing old as a kid cleaning carburetors and changing engine oil for your dad, not to mention entering an  engineering school in college), I envy her because I once was like her, but I lost the passion. I lost the heart.  A question: Why?  Do you really want to know?  Normally I would answer I had gotten tired of it.  But I never did.  It is who I am... not just what I do.   But I steer away from it for the moment, because it is hard for me to be who I am where I am right now, because right now, what I do is all I can afford to be. But she drives me. And it makes me want to be somewhere else. Where I can be who I am for her.  And the green light flashes...

      A bitch from hell. Workstation drama queen. Power-tripping pale lesbian. Hormone deficient homo erectus. How do we blame her? Trigger-happy lazy bone. Is she suckin' too much caffeine? Nicotine dependent hairless ape. Manual driven automobile incapable. what a wus! Always sees me for the wrong reason. Pretensious friend... wolf in a sheep's clothing. Why do you think you rock? My ass!!! If stupidity can be bought, you'd be priceless. Name as sweet as a peach... you foul my tongue in disgust. Why do you push me so? Don't touch my love. Nobody can.  Why do you test my patience? Don't make my love cry. Nobody can get away with that. Don't tell my love where to sit. Don't tell her where to go. Not even you can do that.  Who the fuck do you think you are??? I am a grasshopper, yes. But you are no dalai lama. Get off my back.  And now a cite form.  Of course you know...  This means war.

      Stop... look... and listen! Are those people's eyes that stare at me/us? Must be somethin' on my face... on my nose? Or perhaps there's somethin' 'bout you. About you... yes. About me. About me. What about me then? Is there somethin' I did... Somethin' I failed to do? People lookin'... starin'. Talkin' to each other, behind our backs. Behind our backs! Friends they are. Talkin' about somethin' on your face... on your nose. Or perhaps there's somethin' about me. About me. Yes. About me. Not gonna ask what about me... I know. Thanks for the sugar on my lips.  And then Shakespeare:   "There are more things on heaven and earth, Horacio, than your so called philosophy."  Stop... look... and listen!

      It’s cold outside and you sit in your garage… double shot of Jack Daniels coming right up. Straight-no-chaser, just how you like it. Puffing on your Marlboro 100’s… red. You have a grin on your face. I love the smell of clams on your grill… while dried leaves fall all around the place. What are you staring at? You stare into space like you’re looking at the woman of your dreams. Why do you have tears in those beautiful brown eyes? Your brother sits with you, talking carelessly… about how things will be alright. About how we all face hard times in our lives. Why won’t you let go of that bottle? Why do you smoke so heavily? Why do you kill yourself? You just sit there numb… dead from the inside-out.  Like an empty shell impervious to cold.  I shake my head… you poor soul. You are so lost. Why are you alone in this?  Long night. Tough week. You lose yourself over that red bell pepper with cheese wrapped in egg  and cold milk straight out of the fridge. Your mom is talking to you… you have no idea what about, your head is pounding. Your mouth so dry. Hang-over. Straight into your mouth goes an Advil out form the closet. In and out of your ears is your mom’s early morning lecture. Do you wanna talk about it? She asks. A big gulp of milk to wash down that oily egg concoction. It all wants to come out again. It’s a weekend. Weekends mean no work… no greasy fingers and dirty tool boxes and screwdrivers that you turn and turn, ‘til your hands hurt and bleed and makes you not want to see another mechanical tool ever again.  Relief. An escape from the things that occupy you and makes you forget. Forget about your past. And how it betrayed you. Forget about how we all face hard times in our lives. Like what your brother said. It’s a weekend. And you remember well on weekends.   I made you stand up from where you were sitting. I threw your Jack Daniels and Marlboro 100’s in the trash. I caught your attention from staring into empty space. I gave you your life back again. And gave you company. I made you forget everything that is putting your life on hold. I set you in motion. I set you free.  Don’t go back into the dark… it gets so scary sometimes.

      Tell me how much it hurts... and I will say to you I'm sorry. Show me how much I betrayed you... and I will calm you down as if to a lake. Should I turn back now and leave you to the wolves? Or protect you with all my love and soul? The latter seems more appropriate... but that is not to be deliberated. I give you my pain that which is love... and I give you my hell that which is my soul. Ease my suffering by easing the pain. Take me out from hell by cleansing my soul. I will give you my all while you owe me nothing in return. And this is how much I love you.  Kiss me when you see me... and I shall writhe in pain for it will be death to depart from you afterwards...  my love.

      This morning I woke up with the smell of toasted bread and melted butter, with the strong scent of brewed coffee on a hot teapot. Quiet. Airless. Humid. Hot. My body is sweaty all over. My thoughts are throwing off pictures of yesterday’s events. Tears. Pain. Sufferring. Betrayal. The hurt in her eyes were unbearable. Sorry. Not enough. Her tail lights shining brightly while she cried on her way home. I know she did. Leaving. How can I bear the thought of losing her… never! Hot coffee on a teacup is strange, but then again, I am hungry. One sip, one bite. And I see her face in my mind. Will we ever have breakfast together again? When the door swung open I knew it’s time to go. It’s 7 o’clock in the evening, and my morning bird now sings, and it’s time to go to work once more. I will be waiting…  &nbsp;  you are my first thought in the mornings.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
