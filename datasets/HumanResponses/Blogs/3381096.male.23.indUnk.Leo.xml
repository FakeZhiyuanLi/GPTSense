      I am sitting in on the 7th floor of AMP Chambers in Wellington New Zealand right now.  It is 12:46 pm, May 19th, exactly 5 months since I left Memphis, TN to begin my 7 to 12 month journey around the Pacific.  After New Zealand comes Japan, Thailand, and Australia.  Most of my time will have been dedicated to New Zealand, though in hindsight, I would have done it differently, you live and you learn I guess.  I make for Lake Tekapo on June 12th, a ski resort in the heart of the South Island.  Hopefully, I dont fracture every bone in my body learning to ski and snowboard, I have had good luck in not getting injured trying new things, but even as I write this sentence I know I have jinxed myself.  I am now looking forward to many weeks in physical therapy recovering from my debilitating injuries having crashed into a tree, perhaps even crashing into another dumb neophyte coaxing his way down the powder covered advanced hills.      Time moves too quickly when you do nothing but work sporadically and drink with fellow OEers (OE is code for Overseas Experience).  OE seems to be a right of passage among those in New Zealand and Australia, a glimmering hope for those in the UK and Western Europe, and a desperate chance at something new for those of the former Eastern Bloc countries.  For Americans, like myself, it is an afterthought, something that might be fun to broaden our horizons.  In the view of the foreigners the lack of Americans traveling outside their own country is another example of our insular, almost jejune, views of America and the rest of the world.  It is true that just under 20% of Americans hold a passport, but I find that is more to do with the sheer size of the United States, rather than our lack of interest.  I dont know many people who have seen all 50 states, but I have met many people who have seen all of New Zealand (though most of these people are not native New Zealanders, in fact, many New Zealanders never leave their own town, yet they harp on Americans for being so esoteric).  So what do I think of myself?  Am I one of the few, the proud, the travelling American?  Am I better than other Americans?  Frankly no, this trip would not have been capable without the emotional and mental support of my friends and family, not to mention the financial support of my parents.  But I am something of an anomoly among those in New Zealand (including Australiasians, Europeans, and South Americans) for being one to travel outside the US.  However, I find this odd because for the first 5 nights I was here in Wellington I met 5 Americans.  Anyway, I will update this website when I get a chance, let you know how the travels are and try to come up with more material for the book I am writing concerning my travles.  Thanks for reading  Chris
