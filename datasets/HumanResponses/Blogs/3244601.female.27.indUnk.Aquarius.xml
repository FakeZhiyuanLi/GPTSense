      I got this whole “blog” idea from a friend (hi Karen!), and today decided to finally share my “life message”- I’ve been reading Rick Warren’s The Purpose Driven Life’ , that’s why. I’ve always  found  writing to be therapeutic, so let me start spilling what I can no longer keep bottled up… :D      My story begins in September of 2003.  My dad, at 58,  had just retired from work and he and my mom were scheduled  to leave the following month,  to stay with his older sister- a retired nurse and the latter’s husband who are  in Vancouver, Washington.  I was looking forward to being left behind, to live on my own (well, I do have an a sister who’s a year older and with whom I am not on speaking terms,  who will also be left behind, but this “other” story I intend to develop as a totally different chapter, perhaps in the coming days, or months). :D   My parents stayed with my aunt for a month the previous year, following the approval of their residency status,  or“green cards” as some Pinoys would call it. They waited for this moment for years, and I was excited for them,  also excited at the thought of them taking my elder sister with them believing that this would give my sister a fresh start in life.  But most of all, I was excited with the prospect of regaining my independence.  I’ve lived in several boarding houses back in college at UP Diliman (four to be exact - first, with a family residing within the campus where I stayed for more than a semester, then with two other college students my age in a  multi-unit apartment in Katipunan, infront of Miriam College  for a year, and finally in a house (which seemed more like a convent) run by nuns and strategically located infront  of the Claret chapel for another year. My eldest sister  (I'm the youngest in a brood of three) and I also stayed several months in my late grandmother’s house in Sampaloc- but the arrangement was not as convenient for me as it was for my eldest sister who was then studying in St.Scholastica.  My cousins who were studying in UST were with us; I left after getting tired of hearing about their being late for mass or making sure they had their rosaries in their pockets - it felt like they were rubbing their righteousness in my face.      But before this turns into a story of my living arrangements in college, let me move forward to what happened in September 2003.  One Monday afternoon,  when I was ready to go to bed (I sleep during the day and stay up at night working in a call center), my mom called me to help move my dad to the sofa; my dad could not get up from where he sat on the floor, complaining that he was really tired.   I sensed panic on my mom’s face, she began calling on their closest friends from Couples for Christ;  two of their CFC “brothers” came over after half an hour and took my dad to the hospital.  I felt really useless then, all I had was a student driver’s permit and the five-hour driving lessons that I took a year ago did me no good.  During that half-hour wait, I kept an eye on my dad, offered him a glass of water and helped him to the bathroom when he said he needed to pee.   I helped him back to his seat  after finding him half-kneeling on the  bathroom floor,  and at that point, I could no longer  hold back the tears.     (More next time….. :D)

      Watching the  Fellowship of the Ring (LOTR)   again  - (hey they aired this twice on HBO today) made me realize that one can outgrow one’s fascination with Orlando Bloom after all.  Because I have :D   Found myself eyeing Viggo M.  and falling for his character instead.  Aragorn.  The unassuming heir to the throne of Gondor who battled till the end to clear the way for a hobbit tasked to destroy the One Ring.  You wont find as many courageous and honorable men in real life as you would on screen, and this movie has plenty of them -   even Sam Wise made me swoon atleast once, especially  in the Return of the King :D       Alright,  these  little crushes are pathetic excuses for a non-existent lovelife, but they  keep me sane, and atleast they’re harmless.  And these keep that spark of idealism burning, i.e.,   of my belief in the “goodness of men” (just borrowed this line from the movie,  but by “men”, I mean potential partners, ok? hahaha),  and of the hope that someone is out there for me and my single girl friends (I’m not selfish).  Ok,  enough about being mawkish.      On the subject of idealism and righteous men, let me add that I hope Raul Roco becomes the next President.   I know I’ll be too lazy to show up at the voting precint tomorrow, but I hope this one vote wont ruin his chances of winning.    And may God bless all the mommies in the world, especially my own!

      I’ve been reading up on ftp and servers lately but I still haven’t figured out how to post a cartoon strip that would have aptly expressed something that I was too lazy to articulate.  Yep, still no cartoons on this page. I gave up. I’ve given up on a lot of things infact – finding decent men, moving up at work, making people understand me  (naah, I won’t bother explaining my actions-  a colleague is beginning to annoy me with the way he probes into what he considers a very lonely existence, but what I otherwise call MY life and none of his business). :D    I used to be more assertive, I  appealed to the university’s VP for academic affairs in order to graduate with honors. This happened five years back.  The college dean then wasn’t very fond of me and refused to recommend me as a candidate for cum laude on account of my failing PE (how absurd) and math/econ subjects – and  these weren’t even part of the program that I shifted to.  But I wont bore you with the details.  I won my case and my medal, and it was the sweetest revenge. :P        But now my strategy is to just to let things happen.  This may not always be effective but I have no problems accepting the results.  I grew up reading about the world’s  movers and shakers, and secretly wish that I’d be like them but I’m not complaining.    And to prove that this  minimum-effort approach works, let me recount my recent bout with the graduate school adviser who kept me from enlisting in a  terminal subject. I was depressed for days as this meant delaying my graduation by another semester. I almost wrote to the  schoolpaper to expose the callousness with which they ran the program (she was the same adviser who kept me from enlisting in a subject that was a prerequisite to the terminal subject in question (do you follow? :D) because they ran out of slots last year when in fact, I pre-enlisted for the course.  Good thing my gripes didnt see print, because a week later, I heard that they “changed their minds” and finally allowed some students to enlist.  Rule-of-thumb, never antagonize anybody.  With nine units of graduate course work  and very little aggression left in me,  I know that I’ll  complete the course and soon have more free time to do the things that I like, such as  reading up on ftps and servers.  :D

      I'm beginning to question the soundness of posting private thoughts over the net, and of allowing needless distractions, when I should be completing a schoolpaper that's due 12hours from now.  Writing helps me organize my thoughts, and I sure need some major mental de-cluttering before this turns into a headache.       I spent the last few hours learning how to post pictures (thanks again to Galenlondeien :P);  I cant afford any more diversions. I should be getting back to work - I mean, schoolwork. I am away from work -- another cause for anxiety.  I used to take pride in having a near-perfect attendance. Hey, writing was supposed to  calm me down.. Now I'm more distraught. Great. Maybe I should rethink my priorities.. Aaargh, these random thoughts have to stop. Now.   One last, here's a photo of me, hope this will draw more readers to my site.  :P

      It sucks when you like somebody yet you try to find all sorts of excuses to cover up. And you dont understand why whenever he's around, you feel a certain calmness yet your heart is racing. This is crazy.  There's a guy that I cant seem to get out of my head. Oh well, maybe it really wasnt meant to happen. Too bad, he's never gonna know that all this time I thought about him.  I'll just let Josh Groban console me with his song... :P    "She's Out Of My Life" She's out of my life She's out of my life And I don't know whether to laugh or cry I don't know whether to live or die And it cuts like a knife She's out of my life.  It's out of my hands It's out of my hands To think for two years she was here And I took her for granted I was so cavalier Now the way that it stands She's out of my hands.  [Bridge] So I've learned that love's not possession And I've learned that love won't wait Now I've learned that love needs expression But I learned too late.  She's out of my life She's out of my life Damned indecision and cursed pride Kept my love for her locked deep inside And it cuts like a knife She's out of my life.

      I’ve relied on a number of self-help books to keep me well-adjusted.   Growing up in a dsyfunctional family, I never really had anybody to ask around for advice. Not that I question the wisdom of my parents’ or my elder siblings’ counsel, it just feels awkward discussing your angsts with family.  And I take full responsibility for this social/ emotional inadequacy.   But anyhow, I’ve managed to keep myself sane by poring over “The Road less traveled”  by Scott Peck;  I still refer to this book whenever I’m confused, or contemplating the meaning of life :P heck, no, I love my simple, albeit lonely, life enough and will never consider committing s------.  Besides, there will always be a blogspot to host my angsts.    Creepy thing, a guy who sat in one of my evening classes last semester shot me an email that read something like:  “so, you read Andrew Matthews, I think we’re a lot alike (crap) … do you also get depressed a lot?”   duh.  I couldn’t think of a pick-up line that’s more pathological than this.  Naturally, I didn’t reply.  Hope that depresses him more. hahaha   Dr. Peck’s book has wonderful insights on attracting grace by combating laziness, valuing relationships, owning up to your mistakes and rejecting responsibilities which aren’t really yours. He has a striking definition of love, too: extending yourself for something or someone for the purpose of nurturing your own or that person’s spiritual growth. Nice, huh.  This book was recommended by a nun in my senior high school class.     My optimism I owe to Andrew Matthews, and his books, Being Happy, Making Friends, and Follow Your Heart.  His nuggets of wisdom are easy to read and comical – gentle reminders not to take life seriously.

      Nothing to blog about, there’s pretty much nothing going on in my life these days.   At work, there’s a bunch of girls who spend their free time picking on other people’s faults, and I’m not spared. And you’d think avoiding them would be the solution? Well, no, they’ll make a big fuss out of that, too. People can be really crass. Whatever happened to kindness in the workplace?   If you have to bitch, do it discreetly, or better yet, don’t bitch at all.   The office isn’t the most appropriate place for that.  Then there’s my Saturday morning class, with 20 students enrolled, but only 4-8 showing up each session.  The discussions are so awkward, the professor allows himself to be pushed around and doesn’t keep track of the attendance– he has a doctorate but needs elementary instructions on self-confidence and people skills. And this happens to be a class on communication!  Oh my, I hope I’m not starting to find fault the same way my officemates do.    I was planning to go to the movies but there was no one to drag with me that I just went home and slept through the rest of the day.  Last flick I saw was about some web-spinning comicbook hero whose life was screwed in many aspects, but who managed to win the girl of his dreams in the end.  And this was on a weekend when I was supposed to work on the first section of a business plan due that week.  I have a mid-term exam this Wednesday and I figured out that some diversion would motivate me to study afterwards.  But I guess I’m just going to have to force myself to hit those books.   Talk about delaying gratification.  If it’s any consolation, I came across an article that says exercising one’s mind lowers the risk of getting Alzheimer’s.  Fine. 36 units of graduate studies wont be a total waste after all.

      I did some things when I was younger that I'm not really proud of. I played along with some liar, convinced that he was trying to break his ties with another girl, only  to appear like the villain in the end. I'm not completely faultless because I was being selfish then. It was a juvenile and messy affair but its over. I may have lost some self-respect then, but this guy will never win my goodwill back.  It's sad when people think that you're gullible and an easy prey for mind games. I was considering changing my mobile number after changing my phone, but I didnt want to go thru the hassles of updating my contacts just to avoid pranksters and anonymous texters.  On a lighter note, Anne Hathaway was really pretty while doing the silliest stunts in the movie "Ella", which a friend and I watched last Saturday.  If you still consider Shrek as your favorite modern-day fairytale, then watch this film. The storyline seems to have been crafted carefully, enough to make even the staunchest feminist enjoy this version of Cinderella.
