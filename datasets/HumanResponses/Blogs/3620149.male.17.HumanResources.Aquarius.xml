      Well i've finally gotten around to creating one of these things.  i guess its about time.    it is currently one o clock in the morning on the 13 of june, one day before mary and me's, i and mary's, mary and mine's, our 8 month anniversary.  i took her out tonight to see The Day After Tomorrow but ended up seeing hp3, not bad but crap ending.  then silver diner until they kicked us out.  but neither of us wanted to go home so i took her to canterbury woods elementary.  its strange how paranoid you are when making out in an elementary school playground after dark when a car pulls up.  8 months.  wow!  i dont think i've even ever had a goldfish for that long.  this is actually pretty cool. eh?

      Its sunday, yay. sorry i didnt post yesterday but i didnt come home last night. time flies when youre having fun. or dying.  So yeah. yesterday started out pretty crappy. i slept in and my dad called at 920 to remind me that i had to be somewhere at 930, so i had to rush to get up and didnt get a chance to run. i had to go change missalettes at st. michaels, which wasnt that bad and i got to hang with a couple friends i havent seen for a while. peter has the entire collection of bud light "real american hero" commercials on cd so we listened to a bunch of them. there are 28. have you heard 28? i havent. so then i had to go back home before i got breakfast because i had forgotten my phone. i thought it had been charging. i was wrong. so i left it there again as i wen to bk for breakfast.  O yeah. i stopped by the school to see the new and improved trailer. since of course my idea wasnt good enough so they painted over it. it looks like crap. but what do you expect. eh.  So when i get back from breakfast my moms like your phone rang. it was the pool. apparently i was supposed to start work at 11. its like 1130. i called cus i was told 12, but no, i have to drop everything and go sit and watch midgets at the pool. i didnt even grab my suit. work sucked. i cant believe these kids would come to the pool when its drizzling and cool. stupid kids.  Yeah so it rained. a lot. thats when the day started looking up. the president of the pool called. you know, the boss of bosses. he said one of us could go home. as i have the least need for money, thats me. so i went home.  Sometimes it pisses me off that i get treated like shit at work. i mean sure im one of the younger employees. and im one of the only guys. but i do more than most of those lazy bitches from college who assume they deserve something cus theyve been there forever, meaning 3 years. i think im gonna get a real job next year. eh.  So then i called laura. mmm. happy. we went to fuddruckers with her friend jenny. who plays tuba. enough said. and josh and carter. it was good times. then we went bowling. for the first time in a long time i bowled over 100 two games in a row. even after penguin bowling two frames in the second. laura just makes me better at everything.  So then laura and jenny had to go cus it was 10 o clock. jenny had mentioned something about mr clarkson at dinner but we just figured she knew him. no. hes her dad. that was weird. especially to see him in a t shirt and jeans. weird.  And you know how josh is always talking about how his brother has the asian connection? its true. there was this big group of asian dudes loitering around outside amf. and they were like is that adams little brother? it was crazy.  So then carter and josh and i went to wakefield forest and set off fireworks. sweet. i didnt even know where wakefield forest was. i still dont. it was sweet. then we went back to joshs and i relearned that i really suck at halo. apparently standing in one place and spinning is not the best plan. go figure. then dead or alive 3. another game i am not so good at. i took out josh and carter in tag a couple times. like 3. to their 17. o well. carter had to go then. and i was like i dont care. so josh and i played team battle. i lost 14 times. at this point i was too wired to go home so i just stayed there for the night. we watched good morning vietnam. good movie for 2 in the morning. then we played team again. i lost another 15 times. in the morning we played again, another 18 losses. i think we can say without a doubt now that i am not good at pretty much any video games. o well.

      In short, ive met the girl im going to marry.   In long, her name is laura franklin, shes a senior at yorktown, and i love her.  for real.  i know you are all reading this thinking i have lost my mind, more so than usual.  but its true.  i have never felt like this about anyone.  she makes all my other relationships seem like nothing.  they are like having a dog compared to this.  i feel like ive known her my whole life.  she completes me.  god thats corny.  I believe in love.  i used to make fun of those saps who thought they could make something of a high school relationship.  i myself was always just in it for the game.  but now i understand.  you who have never loved can not begin to fathom the feeling.  its complete happiness.  not the kind you get when you just aced a test.  not the kind you get when schools out for the summer.  those arent happiness, just joy.  true happiness is so overwhelming that you can do nothing else, but at the same time gives you the ability to do anything.  its confusing.  you who know me know that i make an ass of myself fairly routinely.  well i dont care anymore.  it just seems trivial.  I believe in love at first sight.  i remember the first time i met her.  it was the first night at governors school.  my suite, which consisted of myself, josh, mike from lee, hank from richmond, matt from abingdon, and john from yorktown, was eating dinner together to get to know each other as we would be living in close quarters for the next month.  laura came up to talk to john, they are good friends.  i dont remember what they were talking about but mike and i were having our own convo and i caught the tail end of her sentence talking about her suitemates.  i, being very hyper and wishing to make an ass of myself, said something along the lines of "mmm...suitemates"  to which the entire table erupted with laughter which normally would have made me very high and mighty.  but i looked into lauras eyes, those beautiful brown eyes, and i felt embarassed.  it wasnt that she was chiding me with her expression or that she looked disapointed, in fact she was giggling wealy herself.  just something in her eyes made me feel bad for making a joke.  i didnt talk to her for two weeks.  but i knew something was up right then and there.  i dont know.  well actually i do know.  i know i love her.  and i know she loves me.  no doubts.  I believe in miracles.

      Ok, so ive been gone for a while. Ok, so i havent posted anything after the initial. Ok, so i havent kept in touch with friends. O well, get over it.  Ive realized that at the time when i created this thing, i only did it because everyone else had one and i was clamouring to get "back in the group" after basically ditching everyone for mary.  eh.  well thats over.  both the clamouring and the mary thing.  good riddance.  to the clamouring not the mary thing.   Hmm... mary.  i still feel kind of bad for breaking up with her.  she didnt seem to be happy with it even though she tried to seem content.  but thats one of the reasons it had to end, she never showed her emotions.  even when she wanted to take a break for the summer and i got all flaky, she was always like "yeah, i think about you" which isnt very convincing.  About the whole me getting flaky, many of my closest friends tried to talk me down and i really appreciate it.  really.  i should have listened.  in retrospect, it was really all a pride issue.  i couldnt let her go until i was ready.  im the man goddammit, im supposed to make the decisions.  jk.  though that was one of the problems.  as many of you have noticed (and pointed out over the years) i am not one of the most testosterone driven guys around.  but i had to make all the decisions and take all the action.  which just isnt my style.  i dont know. Retrospect is always 20/20, and i think i know why i went out with mary in the first place.  it was a combination of things.  first, i needed stability after such a rocky spring and summer with the whole katherine fiasco.  well it wasnt really a fiasco.  just really fucked up.  many of you know the story, ive told it a thousand times.  if you by some fluke dont know or have forgotten, ask a friend.  anyway, i needed someone who would provide stability so i could do other stuff.  everything in my life was going to hell and i needed something to hold me up.  and she did that very well.  Secondly, i couldnt handle the game anymore.  after destroying my emotional well being for katherine, i couldnt handle juggling several different prospects at once.  i was a wuss.  eh.  But now its over and it was a good run.  9 months is pretty fucking long to be with one person.  but she put up with me and i thank her for that.  but ive realised i was never truly happy with her.  she made me feel wanted when i was around her but i was never happy.  there was always something missing.  there were always doubts.  i just hope she had a good time.  I really hope we can continue to be friends cus my feelings for her havent changed.  though now someone has fucked me over by telling her that i was making out with this girl i met at governor's school.  what is confusing to me is who and why would anyone tell her something like that.  the only two people who would even know about this girl(more to come later), would never do something like this.  josh made fun of me for going out with a communist the whole time i was with mary.  and sabina doesnt even talk to her.  i dont know.  Marching band camp sure is gonna be fun.
