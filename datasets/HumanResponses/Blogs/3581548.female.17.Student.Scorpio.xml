         Shew, tonight has been insane. Sam, Michelle, mom, and I all goofed on with my webcam. It was halarious. Then Sam pranced around in my bra. lol. It was halarious.  Me and Mike talked for a pretty good bit tonight. He said some sweet things. But i'm not sure if i should believe it, he was drinking. haha. But it was flattering.  Tomorrow Shan and I are goin to hang out. We havnt talked much lately. She's been at Caroline's all week. We dont really talk when she's there. i mean it doesn't bother me bother me, but it does to a certain extent. Yess Caroline is a great person, and fun to be around, maybe im jus jealous of her. I don't know i need to quit being so selfish.  Anyways, i need to go to bed, my other half is calling me in the morning. She's such a cur`racker. haha. i love her bunches`!!!!

         What a last few days. Monday-- didn't really do much. Shan left to go to the movies..then i jus kinda layed around. Bored shittlesssss.  Tuesday I spent the night with Crystal & Corey. We got caught in this  huge  storm, we were on the interstate and we couldn't see a thing, so we went to Kevin's parent's house until the storm let up. Then today we went to the Huntington Mall and Billy Bob's. We road the carosel or w/e with Corey. He is such a gooood baby. He didn't cry once`!! At Billy Bob's he laughed soo hard at the Bears. I wish i had my camera. It was the cutest thing ever`!  Riight now i'm talkin' to Miike. He's such a cool guy. despite all the rumors, i still like him. I've decided that if i meet a guy, and then sum1 tells me something about them, im not gonna listen. I'm not goin' to base my opinion on sum1 from what sum1 else thinks. I think that i need to form my  own  opinion of the person.

          Today has been yet another uneventful day. I layed out again. Maybe this summer i won't glow in the dark. haha. But shortly after that..me and michelle went running around to look for Sam a gift for their 4 month anniversary. yeeehaw`! not. but Shan came to the mall and is stayin the nite with me 2nite.  Me and Shan went to Winifrede. It waasn't exactly our kind of fun...but we made the best out of it.  I have a huge problem..i'm starting to like someone that i shouldn't.My sister would  kill  me`! She said he "got around" but i don't thnk she knows the story that i know. and that would probably change her view of him. but gosh, why me? i mean, it's not like i could get him anyways. But it's worth a shot...

          ugh, whyyy do i screw everything up?? it's not meant for me to have a boyfriend. it's honestly not`!! i don't understand whyyyy i can't get one thing to last? sumthin is def. wrong with me... let's re-cap..  * Eric.. cousin. let's not go there.. it was innocent.  * Jason.. my first boyfriend.Like i knew what i was doing? so yeah, i freaked out and didn't know what to do so i ended it..which was a mistake..then later down the road..the truth came out and i poured my heart out to him (he always said that you got to be straight up with him..so i did)..and what do you know? i get the biggest rejection of my life...  * Josh.. 6+years of nothing but a childish crush which turned into a one-sided loooooove(haha youll never guess who was in love alone?)yup that'd be me. he had no feelings towards me, and yet, he still doesnt. what a surprise. yet, i cave into him EVERY TIME I SEE HIM. yikes, he's my friend, with benefits..which jus..isn't fair on my part. he knows ive liked him.. he jus.. doesn't care.  * David.. well..where to start..we started talkin online..i had a class with him and i was nervous as hellll around him.. so i was VERY shyy and kept quiet. I was able to talk to him about anything over the internet..but in person, i felt totally dif. i liked him, i was nervous and didn't know what to sayyyyy...or how to act. So that gave him the impression that i didn't like him..so he moved on. And that was the end of that. he didn't like me like that .. i screwed it up by the way i acted at school... how dumb can i get??    Yeah..what a screw up i am..

         ...Today is the first official day of my summer! No more bullcrap drama. At least til' August =) It's so good to be able to sleep it and not have to go through all the makeup & hair products to impress the whole student body haha.  My Piston's are losing by 8 to the  lakers !! seriously now. not cool. i hate the lakers. lol. Gosh, I hope Kanawha Central has a good team this year. they did last year, but their coach is gone this time around. that makes me sad...I miss Tommy.He's in for a while right now, and i've seen him twice. but i will see him again before he leaves for Germany.  I'm having ex-boyfriend problems. I gave him my heart long time ago, and i never really got it back. it's stupid of me to still have feelings for him, considering he shot me down and broke my heart. But i deserved it, so i don't know whyy i'm trippin. It's over and i realise that. It's just, everything we do, everything we talk about, somehow links to him. and it is taking the best of me. I can't go anywhere without seeing sumthing that me and him did together, or that we talked about or that we made fun of. It jus bothers me. ...It's my last summer before i graduate and get out on my own. I want to have fun with my friends and if there is a possibility for a summer fling, im ready to go! haha. i'm so weird. i know lol.  Awww... My really good guy friend Adam, just told me some really sweet things, here ill show you..           SCRudy369: you are a very beautiful girl with eyes to die for          SCRudy369: u are one of the top 10's          SCRudy369: and your body is amazing  isn't that sweet? haha. sorry it made my day. But speaking of sweet..my sister is outside with her boyfriend laying on a blanket in the yard lookin at the stars.  gag me`!!  jp.  well, i'm worn out. i'm goin to bed so i can lay out tomorrow morning/afternoon. I need sum sun. i'm tooooo pale haha   `m.i.s*
