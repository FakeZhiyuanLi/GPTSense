       I had a good appointment with K this past week.  We had missed a week because she was gone, so I was sort of feeling like there was so much to cover and not knowing where to start.  Ended up with us talking about Panther (not a suprise...) and me for most of the time.  Interesting thing happened...  As we were talking about us, and what I get from the relationship that is positive and what the lessons are to be learned, my necklace that I wear all the time just slipped off.              Came unlatched and just slid off.       I caught it and made the comment that that was odd (and heres why I love K), she then started asking me what the necklace ment to me...           and how important it might be that it came unhooked right then in the point of the conversation we were having which was basically about my frustration with Panther...        I told her the necklace is something I have worn for years in different ways.  I change out the items all the time, but am always wearing something.  and 99% of the reason I wear it is because of Panther...I wear either something he gave me, or something that has pertinent meaning to him and I on it pretty much all the time.        Right now I have 3 things on it   a Faery that he gave me    a Konji charm of Faith that we bought in DC    an amethyst crystal that is just mine...        She then lead me through discussing what it might mean that it fell off...and what we came up with was that while it fell off, and that would to the outside world seem like it was "broken" in reality I could tell it was not (the clasp was still intact) and because I was aware of the fact it slipped off I was able to catch it and put it back on rather then ignoring it and losing it, or assuming it was broken and throwing it away.        This lead to the idea that with Panther and I, that while from the outside perspective it seems "broken",  from my innerself I see that it is **really fine** and that as long as I pay attention to that fact and dont ignore things and let them fall and be lost, it can be put "back on".        Onward now to the lessons I feel I need to learn within this relationship.  I came up with 2 possibilities, which actually leads to one... Let me see if I can sum them up.  Well the one possibility that I have pretty much thrown out and I'll explain why in a minute, is the idea that I am to learn to not be naive and to learn to walk away... the other lesson (which is the harder of the two possibilities) is that I am to learn patience and trust.  Trust in my innerself more then anything.  To trust the inner voice that tells me to keep holding on, and that it is all worth it, while the outer voice is going "dont be a smuck, just let go and walk away...it'll hurt less now then if it happens later"...see that is where the conflict comes in to play.        The idea of the lesson being to walk away is really the "easier" of the two...and it really is just the complex expressing itself...the no trust, fear of getting hurt complex...its not really a lesson now is it.        Now the other one, the trust in me, the listen to my inner self one, that one is the hard lesson and the more difficult because it means going AGAINST all my inner defenses that have built up because of the complex that is trying to fool me into thinking its a lesson to be learned.  Sooooo, basically we came to the conculsion that as frustrating as things are right now for me, I really do want to give Matt and I more time and I dont want to turn my back and protect myself.  I need to learn patience, self relience and trust, while at the same time learning to speak up for myself.       ***I cant pick easy lessons now can I?******      We also discussed how this relationship Panther and I have really in all its oddity has some good sides.  The fact that I am "alone" so much makes it where I am               1) forced to be dependent on myself, therfore stronger then I would be if I was in a traditional relationship where I could dump things on someone elses shoulders and              2) gives me alot of time to do this work, move forward on this journey I have started.  I have no conflicts of someone tugging me away from my inner work and that is partly why I am able to do so much and move forward so quickly.        Also, my doing this work, and shoring myself up, makes me a stronger person to be there for Panther as he starts his own work and really needs my dependability and not my flakyness...
