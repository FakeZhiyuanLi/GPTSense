      If you've seen any recent movies you may have seen a trailer for Halo 2. Well...at the very end when the XBox symbol comes up you'll see that it will flash the website  urlLink http://www.ilovebees.com  . If you visit this site you'll see some wierd things...one of which what seems like a countdown timer. There are many thoughts on the purpose of all this but the best and most speculated is that a Halo 2 demo disc will be coming out August 24th. Visit&nbsp;  urlLink http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/6404/Halo-2-Single-Player-Demo-on-August-24th &nbsp; to see some more details.

      I love the O'Reilly Factor first off...so I was watching it and then I found out the ultra-liberal Micael Moore was going to be on. You may know him from his newest flick "Fahrenheit 911" which basically just rips on George W. Bush and how he sent troops to Iraq/Afghanistan. O'Reilly found him on the street at the Democratic Convention&nbsp;and he asked why he wouldn't come on his show. Well...the long and the short of it is that Moore was scared, because he knew O'Reilly would tear him apart. Well...the debate turned out to be quite fair and well played. Although both sides made some dumb comments. If you go to  urlLink http://www.foxnews.com/ &nbsp;then you should be able to either search or find the video of it. At the time of this posting the video can be seen by clicking on the picture of Michael Moore to the right of the page. I urge you to see it and comment on it here in my "blog".&nbsp;&nbsp;  Wow I love that word.

      OK...the way to post a comment:  So your reading one of my many posts and you would like to comment?  Well, first, you need to click on the little comments link at the bottom of each post, usually says " 634 Comments " or something like that. Then after that you will after scroll to the bottom of all those comments and you will see a faint link that says " Post a Comment ", click it!&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok so far so good. Now This might be tricky...You'll see a screen that look like it wants you to login, this is where you start freaking out and afraid that you won't be able to post a small comment. Well...today is your lucky day, cuz if you look below that sign in part there is a small link that says " or Post Anonymously ". Click it! You did it...but then you ask, "What if I don't want to post anonymously?"&nbsp;&nbsp; Well...what you can do is write out your comment and then at the end put your name. After your done writing that comment you can go ahead and click " Publish Your Comment ".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So how did you do? Post a comment for this post if you were able to do it!

      Well...Senior year is on its way, and along with being excited it's my last year in high school, I'm afraid that I have no idea what is in store for me after this coming year. I plan on going to college but who know what will happen. Colleges I have been looking at include: Calvin, Azusa Pacific, Augustana, Univ of Illinois, and UCLA. As for majors some considerations are engineering, psychology, graphic design, and architecture. The college and major I am currently leaning towards are Azusa Pacific and Psychology. Is it too early to be thinking about all this? I hope it all works out for the good...

      Gay marriage, not cool, in fact very disgusting. I really hope that we can prevent gay marriages being recognized. If you feel the same way I would ask you to please sign this petition (at  urlLink http://www.illinoisfamily.org/PetitiontoDefendMarriage.pdf  ) if you can vote, if you can't vote: maybe start the petition and get signatures of people that can vote. The deadline is August 31st, 2004 so act fast.

      This looks gay, but I really wanted to try out this "blog" idea. Don't ask me what a blog is...I really don't know. What I hope it's not is a journal/dairy...cause that would be well...again gay. I guess I'll use this to say things that I just feel like saying. Feel free to comment on them and send me feedback.

      There has been very little activity in this blogs comments, I'm not sure if that's because no one reads it or if people just dont feel like commenting or if people just don't know how to. Well...I urge you to comment because I would like some feedback (along with some reassurance that people are reading this). If you don't know how there is a post earlier that tells you how.

      WOW!   Possibly my new favorite movie...I saw the first one when it came out but Vol. 2 I never got around to seeing until today...when we rented it and watched it...and holy cow...amazing. It's got such a great plot. In the first one it seems like it is just a lame excuse to put a lot of gore and fighting, but the second movie explains it all so well!   Great movie. A must see. Tell me what you think if you see it. And has anyone heard anything about the making of a third Kill Bill, because it seems like they did set up for it a bit in the first one (light spoiler coming up ->) when the little girl, Nikki, sees her mother die and Kiddo tells her she'll be waiting if she still feels sour about it when she is older. Post you thoughts in comments...

      So I was on yet another vacation last week....and it was great. I met a lot of great people, some of which I got closer with than others :-)   But anyway... beach, volleyball, poker, movies, ice cream, jet skiing, and tubing was just a taste of what we did. I was supposed to stay up another 4 days but I really wanted to come back and hang out with some people. My senior pictures were also supposed to be taken up there but there wasn't time so, hopefully, I'll be able to go back and get them taken.
