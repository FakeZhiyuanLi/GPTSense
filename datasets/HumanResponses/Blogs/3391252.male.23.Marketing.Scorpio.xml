      How's it going? Last night on 'Enough Rope' Andrew Denton spoke to a man from Iraq who has the most popular Blog in the world at the moment.  He said that his blog was a way for him to speak his mind on certain issues and if people wanted to read them they could.  So, I have decided that I should probably use this thing as my own little soap box!  People who know me are aware that I get pissed off at a great many issues, so instead of venting my anger at poor Danielle, who gets to hear me rant, rave and generally carry on when I get in one of my moods, I will let it out here.  Today, I'm starting small - the commercialisation of music.  Over the years I've witnessed (as has everyone) the climb up the popularity ladder of commercial music.  You know, who I'm talking about - Britney, Justin, Christina, Fred Durst etc.  Why is it that these "artists" are so popular?  I gather it's because they're clean cut, nice, are generally untalented.  That's right, I said it, they're untalented!  I know a vast majority of people will be screaming at me right now, but exactly how talented do you have to be, to be given a sheet of paper with lyrics on it and sing it into a microphone?    A million people can do that, they aren't special.  What is special is an artist.  Here's a history lesson kids, sit down on the floor, cross your legs, sit up straight and listen to old Uncle Nick give you the low down on what an artist is.  A few years ago there was a time when artists sat down and wrote themselves a song that expressed themselves.  They wrote real music.  That's right Timmy, they wrote the songs all by themselves and the songs expressed their beliefs, their moods, anything they wanted.  Lets leap frog forward to today.  Today an "artist" will pick the image they want to represent and then their record company will hire people to creat songs that reflect that image.  Let's use a case study - Miss Britney Spears.  Britney when she first came out was a young girl, and as we all know record companies can't sell a young girls record to other young girls if their parents won't let them listen to it.  So they created the image, "Britney Spears - nice, clean cut, Christian, virgin."  And you know what?  It sold!  Little girls all around the world went bananas for it, and so did their parents.  There was no swearing, no drugs, no sex, no death - nothing bad whatsoever.  Then something bad happen to Miss Spears, she discovered boys, alcohol, drugs and sex.  She became the exact opposite of what her record company were trying to sell.  How can a record company make a billion dollars if their 'product' doesn't reflect the image they're trying to sell?  Well, that's easy kids.  You just change the image.  This is marketing at its most disgusting.  Sometimes I hate my profession.

      Howdy, I've just started using this thing and I have no idea what I am doing.  I hope it is working correctly.  If you aren't able to view or add a message to it, please let me know.  I suppose, since I was the on who started this blog/forum thing, I should say something interesting.  Well, my name is Nick...interesting enough?  I have a girlfirend, Danielle, and she has put up with me for the last 5 years.  I just purchased a fully sik Toyota Corolla.  I think that about covers it!  Peace Out Homies,  N.P.B.
