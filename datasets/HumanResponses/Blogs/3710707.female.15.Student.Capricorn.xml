						   Well... as i figure, why not just write in here... nothing better to do...  My life is a pile of crap, no offence to anyone, but seriously, i believe it pretty much it.  Good points:   I have a boyfriend who loves me (for all you sceptics, dont express ur views) and i love him.   My grades arnt too bad at school, I got 4 Bs and 3 Cs.   I have a group of awsome (fucked up) group of friends dat i luv!   I'm not fighting with my mother, we are being 'considerate' of each other...   I miss dad heaps but i'm seeing him more, at least 3 times a week now which is awsome.   I am going to start going to the gym with meeka regularily... which is going to hopefully make me loose my tub.    Bad points:   I am worried about Kathryn and Suzy as they were caught smoking (and its kathryn's 2nd time getting caught).   I dont trust anyone in my life...   I have a bad back.   My work still hasnt called for my second training day.   I'm stuck in the worst season of the year and i'm irritable because of it.   My brain is turning to mush because PEOPLE KEEP HITTING ME!!   Ive had my first real argument with my boyfriend, and it was a mere mishap, but it was painful none the less.   People keep waking me up to the fact that i cant trust him, it hurts sometimes. Like just as an example, when I let Matt read a sweet message dat chris sent me he laughed about it, and so did Kirsty... and i suddenly realised that they were right. And of course by that time i had remembered that he had also sent bec txts like this.   I cant trust nething sweet he says, cause i know that he said the same things to bec...   That i am realising the full force of everything i say and do.    But i'd better go...  Bro wants my mouse... ill explain that later...  Bai...  ~Shadow~  &nbsp;

						   I cant believe i'm watching Australian Idol... omg... i feel like such a pansy... But ive so gotta have my shower, i'm such a lazy lil bitch, but oh well... if u dun like it, u can go fart on a tree!  Hmm... so...  I dun think neone wants to hear about my fabulous day with Chris, but I saw Stepford Wives, which was ok. I dun really recommend it though.  Anyone wanna go c I-Robot (or something else.. depends whats best out) next weekend cause i'm planning it. I'll probably make it Sunday.  In dun really have much to write in here... my life is pretty much unwavering at the moment...  So ill just go...  Cya peoples  ~Shadow~
