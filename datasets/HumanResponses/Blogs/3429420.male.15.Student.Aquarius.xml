      "PAinkiller"  The past is like a gaping hole No matter how hard you try to run from it You just find that you are running in circles You think of the cause and effect Every action you have made The scar, which the past had inflicted, cannot be healed Like a wounded bird trapped in a cage You realize that the same mistakes being made Your conscience hunted you  You start to doubt yourself Asking yourself the same questions over and over again You felt weak No longer the will to walk on Prayers to god was a momentarily salvation But never was it a cure Painkillers ease but not your pain As you see your love ones One by one Vanishing into the darkness  When you tried to grasp and treasure them  They were all gone Your eyes were hollow, empty without life When you tried to love another  Mistakes were repeated Sorrows and misery embedded Deepened and worsened

      It is the birth of one  And the evolution of another Slave to its master Yet a master to change  Bending rules Forgoing the ancient laws   Words carved beautiful statues Bringing them to life  Beating heart beats and explosion of emotions Sorrows, love, pain and joy  All intertwined  Birth of life and the dawn of death All raised from its graves Only one who weaves its thread  Wield its might Like a tamed lion Becoming a friend to its lord

      A cup filled with the rainbow of colours Each signify a different meaning Some surfaced to simplicity others hid deep meanings Colours varied in different forms When blue might appear blue Often it does not  I was a boy  A simple boy My appearance, my shell My face, my mask My heart is so disguise  I fear so much to reveal my true self Will others shy from me? Will the people who care for me leave? Will I be alone? So many questions,so many answers I need to know  Fatigue washed over me like a tidal wave Maintaining the cloak sapped my strength The weight of the world weigh down upon me Nothing seems to aid Still I have to carry on Battling against an unseen enemy

      Time past like a dragging cart I studied the sea of sweaty faces Some delighted in mirth Others solemn and distant While I struggled with my apparent task The weight of the rifle seems to drag me down Blood flowed from cuts Pain and fatigue weakened my determined mind I lick the dry skin of my lips My feet turn from flesh to lead My mind and eyes wandered  As sun faded out of view The day ended The weight of responsibilities and rules lifted from my shoulders A young primary student walk past me Reminding me how fortunate they were  But still they have to face the inevitable weight of responsibilities  And the winding paths of failures

      “We must not fail our duty, let us ride on!” Lysandros barked a command as he spurred his steed onwards. He muttered a silent blessing to Khaine as the fog begun to shroud the land. He and the few other scouts have lost their way among the fog, if he does not bring this message to Aldamir, the rest of the army would be in peril. Adamantios pointed ahead as a tide of darkness swarmed over the path ahead. Lysandros nodded as they rode into the trees, which provide ample cover for them. There was an order to keep silent and any communication was to be passed by hand signals. The chitterling horde marched forward, ranks and ranks of units were tightly packed together.   “I hate this damn whether!” Quikchitter bared his teeth. Quikwarp who stood proudly.   beside him nearly squirted the musk of fear as he tried to push it back.   He was honored to be invited by the Grey seer to ride upon the Cauldron of thousand poxes. As the cauldron went it releases terrifying screams and laughter, which would even send chill down the spin of a dragon. Quikchitter pondered about where will be their next destination, the arrogant Quikwarp was almost too proud he should have let him walked with the rest of the army. “ Quikwarp I have an important task for you.”   “What is your wish? Most potent of potentates,” He replied boldly as he swings his tail around excitedly.   “I need you to go down and check to see if the ratling guns are working well, recently there seems to be some minor malfunction,” Quikchitter spoke rapidly spurting saliva into the cauldron of thousand poxes. Only to be responded by hideous hissing sound.  His ears lowered and lost his enthusiasm as he heard the bad news. He muttered silent cures to the Grey seer and half hopingly that he hadn’t heard it. He made his way down the filthy corpses as he pinched his nose, he wondered how could the Grey seer have stand to all these perhaps he have a spell which could remove this repugnant smell. It was all too possible; the selfish Grey seer would not impart his arcane arts to anyone. As he walked towards his own company of clan Skyre rats, he thought he had smelled something. Among the smell of furs and rats, he smelled something unusual as he tried sniffing harder. “Elves!”  He curse the day that he had been born, the foul rats have spotted them. If they were to ride out from here they would be swarmed by hundreds of rats. There would be no chances of survival. If they were to abandon their horses here they would not make it in time to deliver the message. But sacrifices were needed to be made. He signaled one of men and whispered into his ears. His face betrayed incomprehension but swiftly nodded and proceeds to task.   The Grey seer stood upon the surveying his army as pride swelled within him. He attempts a grasp at the winds of magic. Gathering a small globe of energy in his hands, he blasted a slave pulling the cauldron. The rat expanded and contracted his eyes were red and was swelling to a point of bursting. Poxes and symptoms of diseases appeared on his skin. And soon the rat exploded leaving only a pile of bones producing putrid smells. “Faster, faster, quick, quick!” The Grey seer snarled as he lashed out with his whip. Suddenly, bells were rung and he knew they were being attack. Anger and rage boil within him as he wondered who dared an intrusion into his army. The frenzied monks broke of the ranks and gave chased towards their enemy. Shouting war cries and froth and phlegm’s dripped from their mouth. Quikchitter quickly cast a spell of vision, and so he could see clearly what was disturbing their flanks. The vision shifted in and out, blurring images and palpable ones. The spell stabled as he could see a horse running away from his army. “Stupid fools, its only a horse,” he spoke softly under his breath. A green light glowed madly on his fingers, sending the shadows dancing like a mad caper on the ground. He incanted the ancient words of his ancestors and unleashed a streak of green lighting towards the escaping horse. Reducing it into a pile of dust. The blood frenzied monks gave up as they saw there was nothing to kill and hurried back to bolster the ranks of the army.       A boyish smile appeared on his face as he savors the victory. “ Well done men.” Lysandros spoke softly but just enough for the elves to hear.

      The young elf ducked as a blade shimmered past, at the same time lashing out and hamstringing his brutish foe. The orc gave a deafening roar and fell to the ground like a huge tree shaking the ground. The thin elf stepped aside nimbly, avoiding the collapsing bulk. Drawing his dagger, he bent down and delivered the killing blow.  The champion looked up from the dead body and saw that his comrades weren’t doing so well. Many of them had fallen before the orcish onslaught. He knew any moment from now would mean life and death. He raced with elegant steps across the slaughter ground avoiding the corpses on the ground.   “To me!” Mansuetus commanded as he raises his sword high so everyone could see. Within minutes the elves formed a circle around him raising their spears high threatening anyone who comes within a metre length. He surveyed his disciplined soldiers proudly. The well-trained elves did not fail him. A few orcs made a daring attempt trying to carve its way through but only ended but with spears through his torso. “ Hold! Elves and you would live. Expect no quarters, for you would give them none!” The leader bellowed and every elf shouted in a single tone.” Hundred of orcs surrounded them waiting for a hole the defenses. A few orcs again made daring attempts but soon ended up dead. It seems the orcs weren’t as patient, Mansuetus thought as a smirk appeared on his face. “ On my command, you would send this brutes to wherever they came from!” He shouted a command in the ancient language to the crossbowmen. The crossbowmen loaded their crossbow and nodded in understanding.  Finally the orcs patient was at an end, the green skins roared and shouted war cries in their primitive language. “Now!” the champion signaled and spears was leveled to the eye and sound of crossbows unleashing death. This was what he savored every moment as the orcs lumbered into the wall of spikes. Steel met steel, blood splattered everywhere and sound of screams and shouts filled the air. “ Fight on my elves and fight well for this day you will replenish the blood within your armors!” Mansuetus charged in fray of combat, slashing and hacking as he went. An orc twice the shoulder length of him and was the largest orc he had ever seen. The massive orc bawled a challenge, and was quickly answered.   Through the visor he stare into the eye of his foe trying to anticipate his every move. The orc wield his axe menacingly and gave an evil laughter. “Fle’ be fo  ma, da wil‘ na de fet ma.” His voice boomed loudly as he made his unstoppable assault. Mansuetus parried with every ounce of strength and speed he could muster. Strands of hair flew as he avoided the humongous axe only by an inche. He saw an opening and made a riposte attack only to see his blade bouncing harmlessly off the orc tough hide. What would appear a grin appeared on the orc ugly face. Beads of perspiration dripped down his delicate face. He was panting heavily and he felt he could not hold off the assault anymore. His bones ache like a rusty mechanism. His green skin foe seems to be tireless only to be laughing and fighting. Fear gripped him like a vice.  Darkness descended. His eyes were wide opened, he groaned in pain. Blood streamed down from his open wound. Every strands of strength was sapped away from him, he could no longer feel his legs, and his limbs were drained. He dropped his axe and crashed into the ground. Mansuetus took moments to realize that a shadowy figure was at the standing at the back of the orc general. He wanted to laugh at the moment but could not. From the shadows came a calmed voice, “Thou have done well Mansuetus, champion of fifth regiment of the Shadow Warriors.” Only to realized he was the assassin, whom his general had spoken well of Mansuetues made a courtly bow and said, “ I thank thee for thine compliment for if thou wouldst have saved me, and I wouldst have fallen to these cursed orcs.”  “The battle is over, assemble the elves and have them report back to the camp immediately,” he spoke softly.  Mansuetus nodded and said, “Yes, my lord.”        Mansuetus walked into his simple house, he took off his armour and took his scabbard and hang it by the side. “Mansuetus! You are finally home I was so worried about you.” Mliara said excitedly as tears swelled in her eyes. She was a beautiful woman, with striking features and fine figure. She ran over to embrace him, and kissed him deeply. Fatigue of the battle and heat of love conflict, and he spoke softly, “I missed you greatly, but I am tired now I wish to rest.” He gave a reassuring smile and wiped the tears softly away from her face. “I have prepared your clothing and when you have finish bathing, we can have a good feast tonight.” He took up his fresh clothing and walked over to the river.   He could see the clear water flowing gushing down the endless river. The wind blew softly and the leaves rustled. He stripped off his bloodstained tunic and entered the refreshing water. He rested on the rocks by the riverbank and enjoys the peaceful and soothing ambience. Life was too perfect for a moment he had a caring and lovely wife and recently he was promoted to captain of his regiment. The extra income would provide a better life for his wife and he himself. He opened his eyes lazily not knowing for how long he had slept. Suddenly sound of splashing water made him jumped to his feet. He quickly put on the robes his wife had sewn for him and with drew the dagger in his boots. He sneaked among the bushes, his natural talents made him moving like a cat, among the bushes. He crouched down and to his horror he saw bands of men dressed in barbaric helms and leather clothing wading through the river.   He quickly made his way back to his house and put on his battle equipment. He and his wife quickly made their way out of the house. Every second lost would mean life and death. They ran as fast as their legs could carry them. Suddenly shouts could be heard. Mansuetus heart raced, as he knew the enemy had spotted them. Mliara tripped on a piece of rock and fell, blood was spotted on her knees. “Mliara!” shouted the battle-trained warrior.   “I can..not…..go on any fur..ther, Mansuetus you must…carry on!” she slurred as tears burst forth from her.   “My love I cannot go on without you, if we must die we must die together.” He ran back and carries her on the back. “You cannot run fast enough if you would carry me, they would soon catch up with us.” Perspiration streamed down his face, muscles tensed as he ran with all his might. Sound of his pursuers came closer and closer; he knew with every step they make they would be one more step towards the city. The chaos men were coming closer and closer. He fought on against the endless tide. What would have seemed forever, he thought ended with a loud thud sound. Droplets of blood glittering in the sun spurted forth. Grief and sorrow overwhelmed him. He stopped and slowly put her down by the side of a tree. An arrow protruded through her chest. “I’m sorry my loved one,” she said drawing all the energy within her. Her eyes closed and he knew she was dead. He gripped his sword and there was a glint of madness in his eyes. Blood course through his veins. He invoked the name of Khaine and turned around to face the chaos worshippers. A muscular man held a bow in his hand and smiled, happy that he had shot the target but soon his smile was gone as he head rolled off to the ground.   Mansuetus, captain of fifth regiment of the Shadow Warriors fought with frenzy and hatred. He was cutting left and right beheading anyone who come within the tip of his blade. The chaos worshippers soon learn to fear him, they surrounded him and no one dared to attempt an attack. He glared menacingly at his foes, if it was as if just a look of his eyes to even cause fear in the heart of a stout dwarf. He swings his blade in a sinister way. Light danced off from his blood-forged armour, the runes on his sleeves glowed brightly. Instead of waiting he lunged forward skewering the groin and hamstringing another. More chaos men formed up around him. Only rage and sorrow were gushing through him. In his eyes he knew no fear. Regardless of his own life he charged into the tide. Hacking and slashing and hewed a path though the chaos men. But slowly he was overwhelmed no matter how fast he could dodge or strike he was unable to. The chaos men swarmed down on him and held him tightly. He roared in rage and bit his teeth into his tongue the sweet taste of blood filled his mouth. Veins were bulging up as he struggled frantically.   A group of elves charged into the fray and it was all too much for the chaos worshippers. They turned and fled ignoring leaving their weapons on the ground. Mansuetus lay on the ground filled with cuts and bruises. A huge scar was evidently marked on his armour only missing his flesh only by a few inche. His eyes were vacant; he felt life has no meaning with the death of his wife. “We spotted this band after a few peasants had sounded the alarm. We apologies for the late arrival.” The leader’s words contained sympathy and fear. He ordered two of his men to aid him to stand. Their faced betrayed irritation as they tried to push it back. Mansuetus staggered across to his wife and knelt beside her. Tears swelled in his eyes, as he buried his head in his wife hair. “ Please wake up my love, I beg of you.”

      I looked upon the world A pulsing light  Growing every minute Daring and brave was I  I challenge its unknown might Blood was spilled Tainted the lands A new champion arises  Such was its might I was imprisoned Chained to the bounds of eternity Strength and life was drained from me The brightness in my eye flickered and faded  Sorrows and agony clenched my heart  Fatigue was my constant companion Memories and nightmares haunted me The aura of it presence tremble me every moment Flesh rot and hang from my whitish limbs The seductive allure of hell draws me towards it  Writing the last sentence of my life I watched my life flashed before me Like a rat was I  Staring at the unassailable titan  Witnessing my blade turning to dust My armor my faith swept away with the currents My shield my honor is what I have left  Crows and vultures flew the skies covering the sun to an eclipse  Jokers and minstrels both sang and mock at my foolishness  Perusing his poems And studying mine Looking down at my own demise Drowned my heart and soul

      There have been times in my life when I have felt helpless.It is perhaps the most acute pain a person can know, founded in frustration andand ventless rage.The nick of sword upon a battling soldier's arm cannot compare to the anguish a prisoner feels at the crack of a whip. Even if the whip does no strike the helpless prisoner's body, it surely cuts deeply at his soul.  We all are prisoners at one time or another in our lives, prisoners to ourselves or to the expectations of those around us. It is a burden that all people endure, that all people despise, and that few people ever learn to escape. I perhaps are one of them who cannot escape the bound of reality. Sometimes living for others seems like the only choice, we in life are chained by society and law. Do we have to follow?

      "Five for fighting" Song  I can't stand to fly I'm not that naive I'm just out to find The better part of me  I'm more than a bird I'm more than a plane I'm more than some pretty face beside a train And it's not easy to be me  I wish that I could cry Fall upon my knees Find a way to lie 'Bout a home I'll never see  It may sound absurd But don't be naive Even heroes have the right to bleed I may be disturbed But won't you concede Even heroes have the right to dream And it's not easy to be me  Up, up and away, away from me Well it's alright You can all sleep sound tonight I'm not crazy or anything  I can't stand to fly I'm not that naive Men weren't meant to ride With clouds between their knees  I'm only a man in a silly red sheet Digging for kryptonite on this one way street I'm only a man in a funny red sheet Looking for special things inside of me, inside of me Inside of me, yeah inside of me, inside of me  I'm only a man in a funny red sheet I'm only a man looking for a dream I'm only a man in a funny red sheet And it's not easy… It's not easy to be me

      "The hierachical order"  Blades tore skies apart Lightning splits the wounded bird Silent winds swept the lands asunder Angry clouds darkened the skies Scythe of reapers plough the cities  Lucid dreams haunted in forms of echoing shadows Treachery spoke louder than compassion Every corner was a silent dagger, And a coup practiced neater than a courteous bow Even masters contorted in fear While slaves waited for the darkness to descend Shadows rise and fall unendingly

      Unsurprisingly, it is the 14 of june. I have been spending my time most often in Npcc, but many things have past that worthed my attention and pondering.   The Angel Well over my days i must say, i have valued and tried to learn as much as possible. I read the book, Woman can't read maps and men just can't listen. Haha, strange choice ehh? It made me understand the difference between men and woman and why such difference exist, and what we can do to prevent pressing the red button. Now i move on to a new book written by a famous and good writer, R.A Salvatore who wrote many good series. I have only managed to the first book among the hundreds.    Other than that, it has been most satisfying to win another battle against the odds. Perhaps i have played too long and the expierance have been instilled upon me or perhaps my opponent needed more time.  Another attributes which i have gained over the days was being able to control myself over problems and everything. Being composed in difficult or tough situations is a most useful skill. I have to thank warhammer for that...haha  The devil  There are always evil thoughts which sprouted in my youthful mind. Sometimes it pays to heed its call but i must not be misled. Now i realise more that firends are the essential ladder steps to climb to the top. But perhaps it is nothng more than a evil thought. Still it makes sense, other than simple ladder steps friends provide companionship and someone to talk to. Now i must try to get rid of it.Begone creature of hell!  The dark  Since from last week, my good cousin or rather my best friend had left for army. I miss his companionship and a listener for my sorrows and joys, and nevertheless some good laughters.Still i cant change anything it is beyong my capability to prevent it. Though I was glad that he was positive about it instead of frowning.   Npcc has took up most of my time, spending my time sitting on iron steel chairs and listening to chants. Much time is wasted, a good thing is i can practice my body language reading. Managed to read a few but still i'm not very good at it.  The shooting competition was of my msot regret in this past ten days? Yes it was the most regretful thing. I didnt expect that i have enough time, so i didnt aim for the shooting competition. I have only managed to score a score of 93 which was fairly poor although i pass. I didnt try my best was the worst mistake i have commited!Now i truly wish for a time machine.

      "Truth of reality"  As I sat on the sun set hill How the scenery seems mundane compared to you Looking into your enchanting eyes The presence of you gladdens my heart And your words sweeten my soul Time stopped parallel to space Holding your warm hands, seeped the strands of love  You are the one Who I’m willing to sacrifice for upon the altar of love To brave through the flames of hell To don the shinning armor and be your knight To hear your sorrows and despairs To understand and love you   But when the dawn of reality shines upon me How I realize This was all an elusive dream There is no everlasting love No true love Every lie renders me apart Leaving me torn and tattered in an inevitable demise Dark devils fed my soul  And men mocked my foolishness  Winter now prey upon the land Leaving it bare and dead Life faded into the whispering wind

      "Power of love"  They say angels birth from hell And devils warp from heaven No one knew the truth  When time fled into space And space into time None shelter it with concern  When love seeks to blind the heart of the lonely one None forsee its path  As the blinding of love unbind it self  The legends of knights in shinning armor reincarnated The soul of saints rebirth And the blessing of the gods shone once again Such awe and splendour  Hidden in the seed of love itself

       They say there is nothing we cannot overcome in life What of times when steel of determination were cut open by the blade of love? Fallen so many times to dark pits Hurt, torn and shattered.  They say men should have no fear But to me the world was divided by fears Fears that could end everything Fears that others would not understand And I Fear that love could end a friend  Why must the tears linger for the winter’s chill? When will the sun shine the light? When will the rain wash away all the wounds?

      Love, present, past and the future   Where art thou? I left my dreams and hopes As the light shimmer of memories To a new land, I am there  Smashing the mirror,  I knew there was no way back Ruins of past and present lay before me Am i to find the one who i love and who love me not, in the midst of the sunless lands?  Where the wind seems an absent vacuum And the air tainted with death My home? I do not know There seems not a presence of a smoke nor shadow AS i tread lifeless waste I found a charcoal sheet Upon it wrote " July 2 Year 3210 "

      Love never dies a natural death. It dies because we don't know how to replenish its source. It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals. It dies of illness and wounds; it dies of weariness, of withering, of tarnishing.

      There were so many times When i look into her eyes but yet she shun them from me So many times Is there an end?  I knew i must leave But where? Perhaps somewhere where I can find love and care or perhaps a dark corner where i can cry alone I do not know..  Treading upon the silent street Hands warmed by my side Eyes cast down Every step leads me into the oblivion  The lingering pain in my heart  was my solitude companion and none could take it from me
