      Welcome to the Very First Edition of Cool Shit!  Today's Cool Item: Apple iPod     I recently got the 15GB Apple iPod and it works great. When you install it you get itunes. Itunes is a pretty good Jukebox and it does and awesome job of converting file formats... I got about 115 songs on my iPod and it can hold a lot more. The iPod has great sound quality and I recommend getting one.  Thats the end of Cool Shit Volume 1 and In the Future check out for my reviews of more Cool Shit!

      I recently got an invite to test out the Google Email Service "G-Mail". Its pretty cool. I played around with it a bit its nice how it stores your email. You get a Gigabyte of space so you never need to delete messages. A cool feature is called conversations when you send an email the reply is attatched to the email you sent. It stores all the emails and replies in a thing called a conversation it works good.

      Well I am getting a DVD Burner. Its not any fancy DVD Burner only a 4x DVD+R Burner. I wanted a DVD Burner to maybe burn some movies and back-up my data.   Now I can back-up my PC to restore it incase of problems which screw it up lol.

      After my computer got all messed up from Spyware and Adware I wanted a good anti-spyware + adware program. I think I have found one with  SpywareBlaster  This program not only gets rid of the spyware you have it also prevents you from getting that junk. A nice feature of the program is you can take a screenshot. It saves all the settings of your system and in case of a problem it can restore your computer to a time when it was working. I recommend downloading this one. Keep your PC safe from adware and spyware.

      Been busy so haven't posted in a while. I got a new video card the ATI ALL-IN-WONDER 9600XT so now not only do I have better graphics I also can record tv and burn it to dvd's with my burner. Works pretty good. Great Quality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   My sound card in my computer blew so now sound only comes out of the left speaker. So I have to get a new sound card. I ordered the  Audigy2 ZS Gamer PCI Soundcard Sound Blaster  off the net hopefully it will arrive soon. Looked like a pretty good sound card before I was using the onboard sound. Wasn't to good for capturing sound with my ATI AIW hopefully this new card will fix that problem.

      I am pretty tired right now... Went to bed late last night. I was on the computer and I found this deal at a website. It was enter your email and you get 1 code for a free itunes song... Well I wanted to download some nice songs off itunes so I got over 200 codes. I used about 75. Got around 150 left. You have to use them before December 7th thats what it said after I redeemed them. The offer doesn't work now looks like they ran out of codes. Luckily I stayed up a little late to get a lot of free music from itunes!

      I picked up a new video game for the Xbox. I got my first football game for this year. I usually get the NFL Fever series from Microsoft but this year I got the new ESPN Football game. Its really good and&nbsp;super realistic. It has this league feature built in the game like XSNSports that was in the microsoft games. I joined a league to test it out but haven't played my first match yet. Its like the franchise mode in single player but online. You players can get injured and you can make trades ect. Its an awesome game. Still can't wait for Halo 2 though.

      Haven't posted in a while... I bought a lot of songs on itunes. Only got 110 free songs left but that can last me awhile since there are no songs on itunes that I need yet. I am updating my computer soon. My 20GB Hard Drive is pretty full so I decided to get a 200GB one. Maybe I will have some more updates after I get the Hard Drive and some other computer stuff put it in my computer.   till then,  peace

      My computer has been acting slow lately while trying to play some games. All I have is 256mb of ram so I think I need more.     I am getting a 512mb chip to add to my pc. This should make it a bit faster and able to handle those games better.
