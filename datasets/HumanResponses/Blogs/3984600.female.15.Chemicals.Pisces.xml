      Well, today is getting off on a great start. Not. I am almost positive it is going to be one of those 56 hour days. You know? It's like it never ends, and you seriously contemplate just taking a couple of pills and knocking yourself out until the next day. Hmm. So yeah, Charlie is still gone. I miss him, but I'm positive I can find other things to do. Maybe I'll write a book. What else is there to do (besides getting my 5 month over due permit, practicing violin, read an intellectually stimulating book...). GAH! VIOLIN!!! I am only practicing like 3 times a week. I am COMPLETELY DREADING orchestra this year. Besides the fact that I already SUCK ASS, I'm probably going to be sooo behind. All the kids in orchestra are such over achievers. I'm sorry, but if you practice 7-10 hours a week.....that's a little strange. But guess what? I ONLY WISH I HAD THAT STAMINA. ARRGGHHH. I'm just being a jealous little girl. I mean, I guess some people don't even remember they have an instrument&nbsp;in there room for the better part of the summer, but I hate being the one that does JUST enough. I'm mediocre! YES! Gah.   On a lighter note, I have decided to get my permit on Saturday! I mean, I want to get my permit on Saturday, and that's my goal. I have to get it before August or else I can't get my license on my birthday. Stupid DMV....   I really need to get some pictures&nbsp;in here, or something that resembles them. Hmm. Maybe I will draw a picture! COOOOOLLL!!! I will do that. Right now actually.

       I'm typing in "Georgia" font. Just thought I'd let you know. Yeah. I had a dentist appointment today. Fluoride SUCKS. Eh, then I went with my mom to an outlet. It's like a mall, but cheaper. The story of my life. Let me tell YOU....actually, nevermind I'll spare you. &nbsp;   &nbsp;    My room smells really gross. I hate that paint smell. You know what's even grosser? I just found a dead fly on my window. You know what's weird? Have you ever seen a fly drop dead in mid flight? Me neither.     &nbsp;   Man, I've been reading some web journal things, and some of them are so sophisticated and deep. I felt like such a dumb ass after I read mine (I know what your thinking: "I thought&nbsp;you were,&nbsp;too."). Maybe I should start writing articles about AIDS in Africa or children in sweat shops. Hmm. What do you think? I'm thinking I would look more like a a pompous ass than a dumb ass, and frankly I don't know which one's worse...    &nbsp;  I  'll be on way now. Oh, don't forget&nbsp;to always&nbsp;extend your ki, childs!

       Secret message! Figure it out children:    Got a lot of time on your hands I assume. Well, glad I could make your day a little shorter.     &nbsp;   I'm a little bored today. I saw that&nbsp;Cinderella movie today. It was a  laugh riot . Let me tell you....it was either that or the robot movie. Guess it isn't the "Willennium"&nbsp;anymore. Sorry Will. I never noticed how flawless an ugly girl could look. It's funny how in movies&nbsp;they always&nbsp;seem to choose the&nbsp;name "Sam" for the beautiful ugly girl that's a tomboy. Ha.      &nbsp;   I have Ki Aikido today. Not my favorite thing in the world. It's weird. I dread it up to the day, and then after class I feel like it's the coolest thing in the world. Hmm. Love-hate relationships never last...sad. I have one of those with food. I feel like Richard Simons now. Did I even spell his name right? Oh well. I heard he slapped a cop....way to go, Rich. You never know who's out to get the government these days. None the less, props my man.

       My goodness.....this is so sad. I guess I better write something before I get shot for having such a boring site. I have no pictures. That really sucks. Well everyone seems to have one of these web-page/journal things so I figured I get one myself. I'm a rebel. Man what do I say? Maybe this wasn't such a good idea....hmmm....Hey! I painted my room green, and today I&nbsp;punctured&nbsp;my&nbsp;ankle with a jewlery box. Actually, you know what? Nevermind......do shoot me....&nbsp;

      Sorry I haven't been writing. It's just......Actually, I'm not sorry. I could care less. No one really reads this, so what the hell am I doing apologizing. ANYWAY. Nothing new really. Only reports of Europe from Charlie, oh and my aunt came to visit for 2 days. I NEED TO GO INTO A COMA FOR A LITTLE WHILE. Maybe it will help me speed a little through this BLACK HOLE of a summer that's SUCKING the life out of me. Hmm.   The only good thing about this summer:  is that I've had a lot of time with my darlings: Rachelle and Laura and Jenny, and that well...screw this. I'm gonna go eat animal crackers.
