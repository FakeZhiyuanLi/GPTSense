      I talked to Sheena online yesterday.  She's in Spain right now.  She's coming back next week, I think, and then she's going to Tennessee for a week after that.  She said she loves Barcelona and could stay there forever.  I told her that I would appreciate it if she came home eventually...not that I would actually get to see her, since she lives in Minnesota and I live here, but still.  I would like to go see her again sometime soon, but I don't think I'll be able to.  I told her about the Falling Up and Rebecca St. James concerts in Mpls. on August 14th and 15th, and she said that I should come and we could go to those.  I would love to, but I really don't think I'll have the money.  Well, I could always take Kim's advice, "Don't ever let money keep you from doing what you want to do." but I don't think that really applies in a situation like this.  I think that applied more to college, and trying to figure out how to pay for it.  So anyway...yeah, that's still up in the air.  Maybe I should start a "Help Steve go to the concert" fund.  Would anyone really donate to that though?  LOL.   I got a letter from MNU today with the names and addresses of my roommates.  It has O down as one of my roommates, but I've mentioned that before.  The other is Sean Henderson from Topeka, Kansas.  They told us who our roommates were going to be when I was at SOAR in June, but I didn't write his name down, so I had forgotten.  One of the first things I thought when I got the letter was that when Sean gets his letter, it's going to show both my name and O's, and of course both of our addresses are in Williston, North Dakota.  I can just picture him thinking, "Oh man, I'm going to be rooming with TWO North Dakota people!  Probably the only two people from North Dakota going to MNU, and I have to room with both of them!"  LOL.  I'll give him a call soon.    Yesterday, I went to the Columbia House website and ordered some CD's.  Columbia House is a great thing (IF they have the music you're looking for.)  I haven't ordered anything from them in a few months because they never have what I want.  They did, however, have "Phenomenon" by TFK, (I was both surprised and impressed) "Glo" by Delirious, "Love" by the Juliana Theory (another surprise) and I was so happy to find that they have all of the Switchfoot CD's.  I only ordered "Learning to Breathe" though.  They have a thing going on right now where you buy one CD at regular price and get 3 free.  They charge a lot for shipping, but still the total came to $29.94, and if you average that out, it ends up being about $7.50 per CD, which is not bad at all.  I wish I could have bought more...but then again, if I could have, they probably wouldn't have had the ones I wanted anyway.  They didn't have anything by By The Tree, Hawk Nelson (BTW, their new CD comes out tomorrow, but I don't think I'll be able to buy it until I get paid this weekend) Watashi Wa (I've been looking for some of their older stuff) FM Static,  Number One Gun, or Ace Troubleshooter.  I was really hoping to find "Madness of the Crowd" by them on there, but it was not to be, I guess.  LOL.  I'm gonna get going now.  Hope you all have a great evening, and I'm sure I'll write more meaningless babble tomorrow.
