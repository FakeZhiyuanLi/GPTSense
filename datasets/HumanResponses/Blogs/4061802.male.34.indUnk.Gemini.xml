						   The huge friendly dinosaur almost sat down on Abigail one day, while she was practising her ballet.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Oi!&nbsp; Watch where you’re going!” she yelled, all the way up at him.&nbsp; The dinosaur looked all around himself, trying to find the source of that little voice.&nbsp; “I’m down here,” she shouted, “too near your bottom.”  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Oh,” said the dinosaur shuffling a bit away from her, “I am sorry.&nbsp; It’s just that I’m rather upset.”  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Upset?” she asked.&nbsp; “Why?”  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “It’s my birthday today... and I....”&nbsp; The big dinosaur went a slightly red shade of green, for a moment, with what may have been embarrassment.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Oh, what’s wrong?” Abigail asked.&nbsp; “You shouldn’t be upset on your birthday.”  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I know.” said the dinosaur as he lowered his head to the ground, near her.&nbsp; “But, I don’t know any girls that will come to my birthday party... and I think all the other dinosaurs might laugh at me.”  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I’m sorry.” said Abigail.&nbsp; “I don’t think I know any girl dinosaurs that could come along at such short notice.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “No,” agreed the huge finely dinosaur, “I don’t suppose you would.”  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But then the dinosaur suddenly stood up very tall, his head so high and far away that Abigail could barely make out his big new smile.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, his smile zoomed quickly, but carefully down to the ground level and he almost shouted in excitement, “Would you like to come to my birthday party, Abigail?”  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had to take a step backwards, rather suddenly, before she could answer.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Will there be lots of cake?” she asked, rather rudely.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “There certainly will.” replied the dinosaur, not seeming to mind.&nbsp; And then he added, “But you shall have to wear a party hat, like we all do.”&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Ooh, yes please!!!” screeched young Abigail, with genuine joy.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Let’s go, then.&nbsp; Climb up onto my back and I’ll take you there.”  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Abigail clambered eagerly to sit on the friendly dinosaur’s back.&nbsp; As he started to move, he started to hum a slow tune.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What’s that song you’re humming?” asked Abigail.&nbsp; The dinosaur stopped to think.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I... I don’t really know.... It’s just a tune.&nbsp; I don’t really know any songs.”&nbsp; Which Abigail thought was very sad.&nbsp; Then she brightened up and said,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I know!!! I shall teach you some dinosaur songs... then we can sing them together at your party!!!” she exclaimed.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Yes, that would really make me very happy.” smiled the dinosaur.&nbsp; Then, as he started walking again, asked, “What’s the first song called?”  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Ummm... I know.&nbsp; It’s called The Stegosaurus Stomp.”&nbsp; The dinosaur smiled.&nbsp;&nbsp;“That sounds like a very good party song!&nbsp; I hope our party hats don’t fall off!” he laughed.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abigail cleared her throat and started to sing, &nbsp;

R&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sort of… more the … fragmenting.  A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Onion style.  R&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That’s it.&nbsp; Each new layer revealed is…  A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; …as big as the one before, isn’t it!  R&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes – but no more real – and no less, I guess.  A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And each new layer could have been the original outer.  R&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or the very centre.  A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The core.&nbsp;     R STOPS WALKING.&nbsp; A HAS TO TOO. &nbsp;

						       KIDDERMINSTER     phone: 01562&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pop 55,200      Traditionally famous for its thriving carpet industry (established 1735), Kidderminster is a town that has thrown off the shackles of economic collapse in pursuit of a brighter retail future.      Orientation & Information    Once you realise that Kidderminster’s “ring road” doesn’t go all the way around, navigation becomes much more simple.        Postage Hero    Roland Hill, creator of the Penny Black, England’s first postage stamp has a statue by the town hall - as well as a small-ish shopping centre named after him.     &nbsp;      New Shopping      The town is experiencing a “jam doughnut” effect – the previously derelict brown-field sites, left by the once great carpet industry are now undergoing furious re-development.&nbsp; Retail parks usually found suffocating the outer edges of most British towns are here to be found doing the same to the centre.       Severn Valley Railway   This traditional steam train line (( 01299 403816) allows travel from Kidderminster, past the West Midlands Safari Park (( 01299 402114) and Bewdley, all the way as far as Bridgenorth. The pub at the front of this old station serves a decent pint of mild.       Walking Tour      Park in the central Tesco’s car park, walk past the Piano Building (look at this from the air) and the new Weavers’ Warf development.&nbsp; Pass the beautiful Crown House, walk up through the Bull-Ring and on to the High Street.&nbsp; Turn right at Woolworths and walk 100 metres downhill and then another right through the Roland Hill Shopping Centre.  Down the escalator and turn left – walk past the Town Hall and Roland Hill’s Statue.&nbsp; Finally, turn right and you’ll find yourself back at Tesco’s.&nbsp; Lovely.       Entertainment    See  shopping  and  places to eat .&nbsp; Also worth a visit is Aggborough Stadium, home of Kidderminster Harriers FC.       Places to Stay      Perhaps surprisingly, Kidderminster is hardly over-run with guest houses. Beulah Villa (( 01562 67148) is a small B&B on 187 Chester Road South.&nbsp; You would be best advised to take your own towels. Across on the other side of town, the Gainsborough House Hotel (( 01562 820041) on Bewdley Hill does a good weekend rate, from £32, as well as a large “buffet breakfast with the staff”. Alternately, we would recommend staying in either Verona or Edinburgh.       Places to Eat      There is more to Kidderminster than Pizza Hut and McDonalds, just barely though. By far the best Curry House in the area is the Bengal Lancer (( 01562 66270), situated on Blackwell street, opposite The Red Man, a pub that keeps a wide range of ales well. There are several chip shops across the town, serving food of widely variable quality.&nbsp; On any one evening, you may delight to greasy food which is either over- or under-cooked, too hot or cold, crispy or slimy – seldom much choice for vegetarians, sadly.       Getting There & Away    Both are best if done quickly. The railway station, on Comberton Hill, serves Worcester to Birmingham Snow Hill (trains no longer arrive at the safer and more convenient New Street Station). To the South, the A449 leads to Worcester and the M5 (South).&nbsp; To the North-East, the A456 takes you through Blakedown (speed limit 30 mph) and Hagley towards Birmingham, the M5 (North) and M6, as well as the M40 and M42.&nbsp; Beware – westwards lies Wales.&nbsp; Try to avoid signs towards Leominster and you should be fine. International travellers wishing to visit Kidderminster should consider the East Midlands Airport, then the M42.

						   Sophie's smile was far lovelier than her name - and she knew that the two together were her sole defence against allegations of mediocrity.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wasn't happy; often wondered what it would take to make her life perfect - what she would have to do, or be.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he appeared.&nbsp; On the High Street, holding apples.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was, perhaps, a little older than her.&nbsp; His strikingly flat appearance froze her just long enough to allow him a window for introduction.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These three apples - or rather their seeds," he began, "will perfect the quality of your life.&nbsp; They can make you into anything that you would like to be."  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She laughed, did not believe.&nbsp; "What would you be, if satisfied?" he asked.&nbsp; "Rich, for instance?" he suggested while removing a butterfly knife from his jacket pocket.&nbsp; She didn't have time to step back before he deftly flicked the knife open and halved one of the apples, slicing a tiny wedge of flesh from the end of one finger in the process.&nbsp; He quickly kissed the small drop of scarlet away, then levered a single small pip from the core.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And ate it.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait." he insisted and ensured by forcing the remaining apples into her hands before disappearing into a nearby newsagents.&nbsp; Then, on returning, "Look."  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He scratched randomly at the ticket, instinctively revealing, to her surprise, a jackpot combination.&nbsp; Then, to greater surprise, swiftly shredded and threw the ticket to the breeze.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His questioning brows mimicked her own as she wondered where her voice had gone.&nbsp; "Would you like these apples?"  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She bit eagerly at the previously halved apple, heading home.   She became rich with predictable improbability.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the fortune felt cheap, poor, held no value for her.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The money went as easily as it came.&nbsp; She bought all manner of possession - men not dearest - as she felt her concrete needs wane.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currencies of all name flowed through her hands as she drifted across the globe; exotic, beautiful rarities becoming grey commonplace and, above all, meaningless.&nbsp; She couldn’t identify either the precise time or place when she had lost her smile.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For, however much she accrued (all entirely through impossibly legal and fortuitous occurrences), satisfaction remained well beyond the reach of her wealth.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps I have to be loved?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ate the second apple.   He realised that he always had been so.&nbsp; Long before he ever dared admit it.&nbsp; He was very much in love with Sophie, although she could not understand why.&nbsp; It was the very blindest of devotions.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She began by questioning his faith in her, then moved straight on to challenging and testing it with a savagery that he couldn't possibly have deserved.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She changed her image - her clothes, her hair, her manner of speech - entirely, her very character,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He still admired, desired, cared, trusted and loved without any seconds’ thought.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She treated him with irregular contempt, with an unpredictable lack of kindness but he grew to love her more deeply still.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She spent nights and more away, making no secrets of her pleasured engagements with innumerable others.&nbsp; He would remain inhumanly patient and, for her eventual and resentful return, Sophie would find herself adored all the more.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For he could understand that the roots of her behaviour anchored in unhappiness.&nbsp; Although he recognised his own obvious powerlessness, he would do any possible thing to feel her smile on his skin again.&nbsp; But all he could know to do was resolve never to let his love for her die.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As if in some last vain attempt to prove herself unworthy of his affections, she finally frittered away even her vastly undeserved fortunes.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she allowed him to fund her alternative liaisons.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was he who finally admitted to himself and then dared voice it aloud - that she wasn't satisfied with him.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He suggested that she eat her third apple.   It was mouldering by now.&nbsp; Only in one small, greenish-turquoise patch, but smelling far more acrid than she could have predicted.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her fingernail sank easily and quickly into that decomposing circle.&nbsp; She bit and swallowed that part first - as quickly as she could, to expedite the expected unpleasantness.&nbsp; But the nausea rose quickly to fill her brain.&nbsp; Her lover was there to catch her in faint.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following conversation was hers alone.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the bitter and swirling colours, she felt the return of that strikingly flat man who had been the start of all this.&nbsp; He smiled, "Perfection?&nbsp; Satisfaction?&nbsp; Any joy, whatsoever?"  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slurred, "None." through her hazy sadness.&nbsp; But he had known that already.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before you finish the third apple," he continued,&nbsp; "I would repeat my original question:&nbsp; What would you be, if satisfied?"  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His words became a mirror.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She tried to blur through the focus that denied sharpness to the self-image which faced her now.&nbsp; It was no more herself than she now felt.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sophie began, "I want to be...."&nbsp; Broadening his smile.&nbsp; "I... need to be myself." she realised.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You may be right."&nbsp; The convecting vapours confused him away and daylight returned.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It really was Sophie who sat up now to face the remains of the final apple.&nbsp; One final seed for one final wish?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she opened the bin to throw it away, she refound her smile.

						   The words you need to hear tonight Are written here in grey and white, My deepest thoughts in plainest sight. Why don’t you read my mind?  The feelings that you’d wish found voice, The longing for your warm embrace, The dreams you need to sleep in peace. Why can’t you read my mind?  I’d never close my thoughts to you. My love floats here in lazy view. Words frame lies but thoughts are true. Why won’t you read my mind?  Open up your thoughts to me And show me what my eyes can’t see. Change my hopes to certainty. Why can’t I read your mind?
