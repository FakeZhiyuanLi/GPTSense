        So this past week has been a little weird, full of different emotions and feelings, and I guess it's pretty impossible to sum them all up into one entry, so I'll just stick with the big stuff. On Saturday, I invited Christina to the play and to spend the night at my house. She and Olivia and Nathan and myself, all went to the play, which kind of turned into a bit of a disaster. First, Olivia, as usual acted up like a tard, and made the whole situation stressful. Second, Nathan invited one of his other friends along, who Christina doesn't particularly like. At first I thought she was just being silly, but after I met Brittany, I began to think that I was feeling the same way as Christina. She seemed sort of snobby, and not some one I would really want to talk to that much. Then during the play, this whole tention feeling was going on, which made me angry, and in turn ruined the whole play for me. When we got home, I was complaining about it, because I hate it when Christina just sits there and gets angry, and sometimes takes it out on me by calling me stupid or something, and I was taking it out on Olivia, and then Christina came over to spend the night, and there was still some tention. So I told Christina right out, and it bugged me that she would just let Nathan anger her like that. We got to talking, and I actually told her how I felt. I even let her read last Wednesday's entry, we almost started to cry, but kept it down to a soft roar. It was a good night. Then on Sunday, Mom adressed Olivia and I about everything that's been happening between us in the last month, and how our arguing is really getting on her nerves. That was a good day, because even though we had some arguments, and were crying, we got out a lot of stuff that had been bothering us, and it was helpful. I think that Richard is moving out of my math class, and I'm so sad about it. I don't want him too, even though it only reminds me of the things I can't have, I like looking at him, and thinking about what it would be like to have a boyfriend like that. He's really cute and really intellegent, and oh, I just want him to like me as much as I like him. I mean, just because I'm fat, does not mean that I don't have a good heart and mind. I just want some one to like me, and if it were some one that I liked back, it would be a plus. I mean, I don't want a huge relationship, I just want to know that I'm good enough for some one to like me the way I feel about some people, like I do Richard. I also like Chase a little. But, not as much as Richard, and I think I only like Chase, that way, because he likes me at least for a best friend. I might have some chance with him. I miss him a lot though. He moved away, and I don't ever get to see him anymore, and I really miss having him for a friend to lean on. I mean, I still talk to him online every once in a while, but it's different. I'm going to visit him when I get my licsense. I'm going to have a party on the 6th of March, and it will be so much fun. It's theme is Dr. Seuss, because we share a birthday. It's so weird, because it's my 16th birthday, and Dr. Seuss' 100th birthday this year. Two very memerable years to turn. I'm so excited. I've already made the invitations, and now all I have to do is hand them out, and make sure that it all gets aranged. Well, it's time I high tail it, which is a car expression, which I've been thinking about cars for a while, since I'm turning 16, and I'm going to be able to drive now. I'm super excited.

        Today was so full of mixed emotions, and confused frustrations. It started off okay. Can you believe that I got up at 5:40am so that I would be ready to get out the door as soon as my ride came, and I was actually late. I woke up to my alarm clock right away, went into the house, took a shower, went to my room, got dressed, brushed my hair, brushed my teeth, and got my backpack together. I just should not have started resting. I wasn't laying down, and I wasn't sleepy. Once I've taken my shower, I'm not sleepy until halfway through Spanish. I was just sitting down, petting Angel, and relaxing, but when the time came to make my lunch, and breakfast, I was rushing, and I went out the door right, and I mean on the second, right as my ride pulled in. That was fine, and so was seminary, school was great. I was happy all throughout school, and all my classes, up until Math. That seems to be the class that I hate know. There are two reasons. One is that Richard is clear across the room, and we never talk, and I miss talking to him because I really like him. He's smart, not just smart, but intelligent, he's funny, and he's not horrible looking, not that that will change how I feel about who I like, it's just a plus. It's just, I know I can never have him. As much as people will argue, that I'm so cute, and that there is undoubtedly some one in the school who would date me, I know it's not true. First of all, I'm fat. Just a simple statement; I am fat. Plain and simple. I'm not horrible looking, I'm not so bad that no one wants to look in my direction, and I don't waddle from side to side when I walk, which is a plus, it's just... I'm pleasantly plump, as Elizabeth Schulte would put it. Also, when I'm around Richard, I act really stupid. I'm not putting myself down when I say that, I mean, I literally act stupid. The kind of stupid you might call a blonde, or, I don't know, anyone who isn't smart. I act like I don't know anything, and that I'm helpless. I just act plain senseless. It's my form of flirting, even though I know that it doesn't make me look any better than I already do, in fact, it makes me look worst, but, I want some one to like me so bad that I'm making up different personalities for some one to like. I don't even know who "me" is. I really don't. I know that I enjoy certain things, and that there are certain aspects about me that will never truly change, but who I am day to day, is just what I don't know. So, I act stupid around Richard. The second reason why I don't like math, is because Elizabeth and Heather are both in that class with me, and instead of them each talking to me, they talk to each other. So, okay, I'm jealous. I don't even think it's that, it's just, I now know that they would rather spend their time together, then with me. They don't even include me at all. That might help a little. It also doesn't help that Travis, Joe, Heather, and Elizabeth all sit in this little square, and Tim sits right in the way for me to be included. So know what I do in math, is something I haven't done since Eighth grade; I actually do math. Now, if only Richard could see that I'm actually a little smart. That's a regular day in math, but today was worse. I was looking at my grade to see, well, what my grade was, and Heather and Elizabeth just left, when we all have the same class together after that. They just left without a thought or care about if I was coming. Writing this just make me cry because I don't even feel like my friends are really my friends. It makes me wonder if anybody would truly, and I mean truly cared if I just died. Heather has said multiple times that she wouldn't cry if I died, and Elizabeth is just too high in her league for her to care enough about me, and what I feel, and if I would die. I mean, it's ridiculous. I shouldn't be feeling this at all. So the next class was Theatre, and I just let Heather and Elizabeth do their own little thing on the opposite ends of the house seats, but of course, because I am known as the happy 'facts of life' girl, I had to be happy. And I will be truthful, it is really hard for me to stay sad in the theatre. Also, I just am most of the time happy. It's become a habit, not that I really am having good happy thoughts, but its my facade, and it is super fixed and is going to be really hard to break if I ever find the need to. So, while we were reading Shakespeare, Heather and Elizabeth were on house right, and I was on house left, which are the two opposite sides of the theatre seats, and they didn't even ask me to come sit next to them. I didn't actually mind after five minutes of analyzing what we were reading, and learning things about drama. If there is one thing about me, that will always be the same, it is my fascination with dramatics. I have, am, and always will be in love with theatrics. It can make my mood so beautifully happy, that I can't help it. Which is why in Microbiology &amp; Genetics, I was so hyper. I was more than hyper, I was acting ADHD! I don't know how I went from super depressed to so hyper I had to shut myself up a million and one times, but it happened. I believe it was that the sub in theatre was trying really hard to get into it, and be a part of it, and make it fun and interesting, which is something sometimes even Cromwell doesn't do all the time. I mean, she does, but in a different way that the sub was. I really liked his style of teaching. I think the difference was that he was a sub, so he only taught sometimes, and she has had to deal with kids learning theatrics every school day for the past who knows how many years, and she's become accustomed to teaching us kids what a kid will grasp in theatrics, rather than teachings us like adults, and learning along with us, like I think the sub tried to do. I don't think he knew a thing about drama, but he was learning along with us. I really liked it. So all through Micro/Genetics I was hyper, making Heather hyper, because my frustration towards her just melted away with the anger of it all in drama, and Ashley Fanning became crazy, because she was our partner, and therefore was infected with our contagious hyper-ness, and I spent the entire period wanting to get outside. I was going to walk with Heather, and even Christina was going to walk, but then it was sprinkling, and Christina wanted to ride the bus, and I felt an overwhelming sense of commitment to Christina right then. For the past couple of weeks, month, the last year in general, I feel like we have been growing apart, still being close friends, but we were once much closer, and that is partly do to my lack of interest in life. I won't make excuses, but sometimes I just wanted to give up. I haven't told anybody that, not even Christina, because, I just don't know how to. I don't want to commit suicide, but, I just want to stop, give up, breeze through life as a nothing. And that meant leaving my friends behind too. But Christina has been trying for the past couple of weeks to get us back to the state we had been and could be, and I just finally noticed that she is trying to help me out. Make our friendship everything it can be. I'll admit, sometimes our views go in opposite direction, and sometimes I just want to beat her up, because we don't agree, but I love her to death. Not many people have been able to look past that rough exterior, and see what I have. She is able to be a bully, not as much anymore, but at one point in time, she was, but if you look into her eyes, and read her soul, you can see, I did see, that all she wanted was love. Love from friends, and boyfriends, and family, though she may not be able to admit it to even herself. And I want her to feel that I'm here for her, that I love her, and that she can talk to me about anything. So I rode the bus, and I thought, this is it, this will be our turn around, and I will be happy again, truly happy, and I will want to keep going, and I will have something stable in my life, even if it is just one friend, because I know that she would do that for me. And then we got on the bus, and she started talking to Krys, a new friend she's made, and I wanted to poke my own eyeball out with a pair of scissors, because I don't want her to laugh, and have more in common, and have "those one times" with anybody but me. And because I haven't been there for a while, she's found others to have "those one times" with, and who can be there for her, because I wasn't. It was my epiphany, my wake-up call, the thing that shook me out of my deep sleep, and I knew that I had to tell her, that, I needed her to be my friend, and not have more in common with some one else. So, while we were in the library, I told her jokingly, in a round about way, how I felt. It came out more as I'm jealous of these new people your hanging out with and hugging, and you can't be their friends anymore. I didn't know how to tell her, that I love her, and I don't want to loose her, and that I just want to her to realize that I have no one right now that I can turn to, that loves me as much as I need. That my father is an alcoholic who doesn't even come close to understanding what he puts me through. That my little sister hates being with me, doesn't even like me wanting to talk to her, thanks God for her friends, before me at a Thanksgiving dinner. That I have a mother who's TV programs always come before me. They when I need to talk to some one, no one is there. That I just need her. It was so hard to even look at her at that moment, because I was ready to burst into tears, because I was trying to tell her everything I was feeling, without making her feel bad because there was nothing for her to feel bad about, and that just coming close to the subject made me really emotional. I need to tell her these things, but I don't know how to without hurting someone, even myself. And I don't know when to do it either. I don't have the time to have her come over and for us to get in the comfortable point where we talk about everything. The last time we did that was after she broke up with Chase, and that was so long ago, I can't even remember. We walked home, laughed about things I was so disconnected from because I needed to be emotionally disconnected to be emotionally stable. I went to mutual, which was a lot of fun. We just played some theatre games, and hung out, had a doenut, and I was in even a good enough mood that I played the piano. And then I came home. All I wanted to do was talk to mom about how I was tied down with homework. I just wanted her to listen. But every time I opened my mouth, all that came out in response from her was that I was grounded for three weeks, which I know won't stand very firm, but still. I only wanted her to love me enough to listen and understand, that I can't breathe sometimes because I feel like nobody in the world loves me. I just need that reassurance, and I can't be guaranteed it. And so, I got into my email after crying to God, and hoping that tomorrow would be better, when a long expected email arrived, consisting of Christina's latest journal. It was packed full of everything that has happened for her that I have just ignored for the past year. I have been as emotionally detached in the past year as I was today, and I didn't even see everything she was going through. Maybe giving me her journal was a way to make me see, or maybe it was just an innocent gesture to show me some of the things that happened and the feelings she felt that I didn't really inquire about. But whatever it was, I just wanted to cry, because I had missed it all. I mean, I had been there physically, but emotionally, I was gone off in space. I had let my very best friend in the world down. Completely. I don't know why or how I could do it, but I did, and I hate myself for it right now. I just want to call her up and tell her that I love her, and I want to hug her, and tell her that I'm sorry. But, it's 11:39pm, on a school night, and she is asleep in her bed, I'm sure. Which is where I should be. I don't know how to end except to say, I should have done my homework, but I'm glad that I chose to reevaluate my life instead. If I had to do this day over, I wouldn't change a thing. Except possibly my outfit.

        Does it make sense to like some one so much? No...but it's happening! I don't even see him, and I'm freaking in love with him... I mean it... I don't want to sound all creepy stalker like.. but I find that I start to look for him in the halls in between classes, and I think about him all during math, where he should be, but of course, he was just too smart... The other day, I got in line for lunch,a nd he got right behind me, and all I was thinking was, 'I should say something' 'No, he doesn't want to talk to you'... but I just said hi anyways.. So I said hi, and asked how things were going, and he ACTUALLY talked back to me, it was amazing... Not that he didn't talk to me before, but before I didn't like him as much... I don't know why I like him, because I don't even know him, though I think I've said that so many times before. It's true though. I mean I know his name is Richard W. and I know that he likes baseball and football, and that he is really smart, but doesn't like to be told that. I know that he listens when you talk to him, and makes an effort to talk back to you. I know that when he was in my math class, and I'd ask him for some help, he wouldn't complain, or ask me what I would give him in return, he would just help out like a good person. I know that when I look into his eyes while he's talking, that it's sincere and genuine. I also know, that he will listen to what you have to say, even if he doesn't agree, and won't critisize or ridicule what you've said. I also know, that he was raised in the church, but not baptized, and he knows the principles of the church, so he can't hate me because of my religion. He knew I was mormon in the process of us becoming aquantences, and he respected me, without mocking me, even though he didn't believe the things of the church. I know that if he ever asked me on a date, it would be sincere, and I wouldn't have to second guess it, though I'm not saying that he ever would ask me, just an if... and that's what I know about him... I just wish I knew more. I just don't know how to confront him and start talking, when there are no times when I can... I just don't know...

        It's hard being an individual, like so many people are. I am so boring, just average. Another unseen face in the crowd, and that's how it's always been. I don't know why it matters to anyone out in the world, but I'm afraid of heights and spiders. I can't sleep unless it's incredibly dark or we're in the car. I hate the smell of corn. I like cat's and dogs the same. My favorite flower is the water lily, and I love the smell of the ocean, the feel of the grainy sand in between my toes, and the feel of a wave crashing into my legs, the look of the foam coming in from the water. I hate the feel of seaweed, but love the look of it. I don't like any pig substance, but love Canadian bacon and pineapple pizza, and that's the only kind. Meat balls, meat loaf, and meat in gravy are disgusting. Chicken is best grilled and on a sesame bun. Cheese is wonderful, especially pepper jack cheese. Musicals are god's creation, and action films rank high on my list. Black and white photos are best, as well as black and white films. The silent scenes of a movie make it anticipating. I love the color green more than any other, but hate it on myself. I can't stand to try on clothes, and when I go shopping I end up not buying anything but crap junk food. I don't like happy endings in stories, and I appreciate the details that are far too often called boring parts of a book. I like to be a fan all the way, not half; I need to have merchandise and all their albums or books. I only watch TV for the commercials, and sometimes I will leave the TV on the TV Guide Channel to look at what's playing, instead of actually watching it. I love playing sports, but not really watching them. I love the feel of hard rain drops on my skin and soaking through my clothes, but hate it when it only partly rains, sprinkles or mists outside. I love the look of a lush green forest or colorful flower garden, but try to get me to plant anything, and I'll complain. I love the feel of moist soil on my feet. I love walking on the crunchy grass on the early mornings of winter, and I'll get up at six just to walk under the dark sky, and step on the crunchy grass. I think leaves are more beautiful than flowers. I like my hair long rather than short, but if my hair is long I won't wear it down, and if it be short, I'll let it spring into a life of its own. I type faster than I write, and my cursive is unreadable. I'm afraid to excel but won't let myself fail, and if I do better than my friends I'll berate myself, same as if I do worse. Nothings good enough, but I'm too lazy to try for anything better. I love acting and being on stage, but try to get me to sing as myself, play an instrument and give a speech and I'll shy away and shake uncontrollably. I appreciate humor. I'm not very funny.

        My mother has been in California for most of this past month, and everybody has had to give up a few things. I've had to give up my free time, my fun, my friends, my privacy, my sleep, my... the list goes on. I'm not trying to say that I shouldn't have to do these things, because I know that I should, without a doubt. But when my mother came home, she was a total bitch to me, for no reason. The day she got back, she was yelling at me about anything she could fine to do. I went on the computer (after she yelled at me for being too close, and in her face) and she called me and yelled at me because she wanted me to be with her "for a few minutes" which turned into over an hour. So, after this hour passed, I came back to the computer, so I could, I don't know, maybe interact with a human being that didn't treat me like a stray dog. I didn't have my music up loud, or at all, I wasn't makeing any noise, I wasn't doing anything buy talking to Bethany on AIM. But of course, mommy dearest didn't want me doing that either, and she let me know. She let me know quite clearly. She yelled and yelled for all she was worth, than went to the bathroom, and yelled at me from in there, because the shampoo bottle had fallen from the edge of the bathtub, and no one had picked it up, and it was, of course, my fault, since I let the house go to waste while she was there, and just ignored messes, and stepped over them. So I get pissed, and go out to my room, and fall asleep angry, and nine thirty comes around, and my sister comes to my room saying that mother dearest want's me. I went to her, even though I was ready to kick my foot through the wall. She wanted me, get this, to go get her chinese food, because she was hungry. Boo hoo. Even though I'd been asleep for an hour, and my eyelids almost refused to open all the way, I decided I would go for her, to squash any chance of her yelling at me further. I have Olivia come with me, because I don't want to go by myself, and I needed some one to come with me, or else I was afraid I might purposely drive myself off of a bridge. I get to the restaurant, and they are closed, and Kentucky Fried Chicken is closed, and every other placed is closed. So I come home, tell mommy dearest, and head out to my room, but she stops me before I can close the door behind me, and very sweetly, asks if I will MAKE her something! I was ready to just run at her and grab her throat, and give her something to be angry at me for, but I hold it in, and ask her what, and she wants a fried egg sandwich, with lots of mayo, but not fried too hard, and the bread not toasted. I swear I almost threw my hand through the window in anger. I never get these urges to want to inflict pain on anybody, but I couldn't respond, or she'd yell some more. So, I climb into bet at ten, and, look at this, I can't sleep, because I am SO angry. I stay up the whole night hating being alive, wishing I were dead, and thinking up all the things I could do to help that last bit get into action quicker. Like I said before, I never feel those things, I never really want to kill myself. Everybody THINKS about it every once in a while; what would happen, who would cry and be sorry for the things they said to you. But no one ever really actually plans a way that it can happen. I did. I decided that I wanted to come in the house in the morning, and get all the pills that Tone is so stacked up with, and just take them. They wouldn't know, until at least four or five... but I don't, because I believe in something higher than myself. I go throughout my day, sometimes still seething from the night before, more often trying to be happy. I can't stand some people, like the people that I want to like, but just after they've redeemed themselves for something they said last week, they do it again, only this time worse. Take Jason from Theatre as an example. The tampon incident just wasn't enough for him, now was it? No, now every time he sees me he has to sing the "Fact's of Life" theme song, and say things relating to me being a whore. I want to like him, because he's cute, and sometimes he can be bearable, but not today. I swear I was ready to kill him, when he said I was tacky. I've never said so much as one rude word to him. Never. So I'm in this horrible mood fifth period, and six period comes around, and I'm still angry, but then I see Addison, and he really makes me happy. He makes me laugh, and he laughs with me so I don't feel like an idiot. I want to like him, more than just a friend, but he has a girl friend, and he is a junior, and.. I am me. So I decide I don't want to like him, even though just looking at him makes me happy, because he's so much fun to hang around with. So I leave school all happy, and pull into the driveway, and the bad mood hits me. And to make a very long, longer than I intended, story short, my mother does almost the exact same thing to me, and she yells, but this time, I react differently, I yell back, because I'm not going to sit there and let her ruin my life. Too late. So, why do I hate myself so much, when she's the one that makes me so angry? ... Because I'm the one that she reacts to in the first place. God, I'm such an idiot, and I don't even know it. I don't know what to do anymore. Sometimes I feel like I can't breathe, and than mommy dearest comes a long, and I just want to kill myself. Get a knife, and slit a wrist, and get if fucking OVER WITH! I'm not abusive, I'm not crazy, I'm not even depressed, I'm just fed up. FED UP!

        The past couple of days, my family has had a booth at Summer Fest. The booth next to us sells little glass figurines, like elephants and dogs, ballerinas and piano's, ships and turtles. Not only do they sell them, but the man makes them, right there in his booth, using only a blow torch, a pair of Digidium glasses and the sticks of glass. I find the process to be such a fascinating thing; how it's just the movement of his hands and his imagination. I suppose I had little stars in my eyes, because he let me come to the back of the booth and watch him make a bullfrog (a frog with a bulls head; horns and all). I even got to wear the special glasses. I am still captivated by the skill and patience required to make such beautiful things. While I was thinking about it last night before bed, the image of two very large hands with bloodied scabs on them came to mind, and at once I knew they were the creators hands; the hands of the one who sacrificed his life for me. It's amazing what skill and patience the lord had with this world and its inhabitants. And then I realized how grateful I was that God had the patience he did, and that he was as forgiving as he is. I guess that's why he's God, eh?

        There is a reason that I haven't been writing in here lately; I've been too depressed, too hurt to take the time to do so. I guess I should start from the beginning, eh? Okay, well, the beginning is Wednesday, the 21st. On Wednesday, I knew that Christina was going to go with another one of her internet boyfriends to the Drive-in, and I was getting so worried that something would happen to her, that I decided that I should go as well, in a different car, of course, but parking right next to her. So, I got home, made the plans, asking my mom if I could "give Olivia a birthday present early" by taking her to the Drive-in with me. Well, okay, and I wanted olivia to enjoy herself, so I let her choose one friend she could take. She choose a boy named Jeremy. That was my first mistake, because Christina's date canceled, but I have Olivia's hopes up, and I didn't want to break that, so I decided Christina should come too. So it was Olivia, her friend Jeremy, Christina and I, all going together in my car. That was my second mistake. Well, I had to put Tony to bed, and so Olivia, Christina and Jeremy were waiting in our front yard, and appearently Christina and Jeremy found some interests in eachother. I noticed, but younger boys will flirt, and Christina is a flirt, whatever. It didn't really bother me, until we were already at the Drive-in, and Christina insisted that she and Jeremy sit in the back of the car together. I gave in, and let them. My third mistake. The entire movie they were getting close to eachother, and ended the movie with making out. I ignored it, my fourth mistake. So, we were sitting in Spiderman 2, when they all decided that they wanted to go somewhere and park the car. By this time I had had enough, but I didn't want to be the party pooper, so I endured it. All night, until two thirty am I was listening to them making out, watching the road with total disdain, and wishing I were home in my bed, that I hadn't gone to the drive in at all, and that Christina cared about herself more than to get with a guy who was younger, smoked, was getting busted for drugs, and already had a girlfriend. Well, the next day, I was shoping with mum in Salem, when I got a call from Christina, asking if she could go into my room, because her whole house was super hot. I had an idea that she was going to meet Jeremy, but I wanted to be the cool friend again, so I said yes. My fifth mistake. So, I get home, and I purposely didn't knock on my own door, and when I swung it open, Jeremy has his shirt off, and Christina is whiping her lips with the back of her hand. I got in, apoligized, got my stuff, told them to leave soon and be quiet, and just left them to do whatever they wished. My sixth mistake. Then I left for the weekend with Emma and her family to Newport, along with Abbe Groh and Stephanie King. I had so much fun, and was being so carefree; enjoying the beach, and the company, and the never ending mint chocolate cake, when on Sunday, I got a text message from Christina saying, "What would you say if I told you that Jeremy and I had sex on your bed?" I replied with, "Did you?" I was in shock. I thought that after I had left on Thursday they had had sex, and it was my fault for letting them stay in there without me being there, or my parents knowing. "No, but can we?" She answered. "No, I'm sorry... actually, I'm not sorry, because one day you'll meet some one that you'll think is special and who will make you fill special, and you'll regret giving away your virginity to some one who didn't care about you. I don't want you to hurt yourself like that." Is what my little speech was to her, but I guess it wasn't enough... Right then I should have called my mother and told her to make Olivia stay inside, and lock my doors, because a plan was being planned. I wouldn't have told her what, just to watch out; but I didn't. My seventh mistake. On Sunday night, I got a call from Olivia asking for Christina's number. I told her it, but then asked her softly, while crying, not to call her. She said she wouldn't, but I made her promise me that she woudln't call, and I begged her not to get involved. I just didn't want her to get dragged into anything that she didn't have to. I love her, and anything that can hurt her, I want to keep her from. Obviously, me crying for her to please not do something wasn't convincing enough for her not to do it, because when I got home on Monday, Tony told me that Christina and Olivia had been spending a lot of time together. I knew right then, that Olivia had broken my promise. I had asked her on the phone, "Think about it, Olivia. When's the last time that Christina wanted to talk to you?" I wasn't trying to be mean, but I wanted her to understand that Christina was using her for Jeremy, even though I wasn't sure how, I knew that it was the truth. I was right. After I got home, and Olivia showed up, I made her tell me if they had had sex in my room. They had, and not on Thursday; they had been using my room all weekend to do whatever the hell they wanted to do. I cannot describe how hurt I was. How used I felt, and still do felt. Now I know the whole thing, how and when, but I still don't understand why. What were they thinking to lie, and sneak, and.. use me and my parents. Both of them, no, all three of them, Olivia, Christina, and Jeremy. So, I was enjoying my innocent weekend with the friends who don't decieve me; meanwhile, in Dallas, Oregon, Carolyn Hudson's room, this is what was happening: Christina and Jeremy were using my room all weekend for whatever they wanted to do, and Olivia was helping them get in and out. On Sunday night, after I had told Christina that she could not use my room to have sex in, they used my room to have sex in. Jeremy gave Olivia a few ciggerettes to smoke, they smoked in my room, had sex in my room, un-virginized my bed and room, cheated, hurt, snuck, hurt, lied, and have I mentioned hurt people, all in the confines of my room. *Sigh* I still cannot process all the hurt and pain that I'm feeling still. On Monday, I told Tony, called Christina, told her all the pain she had caused in my family, and felt like total shit (excuse the language) all night, hardly slept, and dreamed of only people decieving me. Then, on Tuesday, I made the decision, that I would tell Christina what she needed to hear, that I cared for her, and that she should care for herself, and how she had hurt me, and we were in there for at least an hour and a half, most of the time me talking. And then I decided, it was enough, she was sorry, she was reaping the consequences, and I had done everything I could. And so my mind was made up; I could forgive and forget, really, or I could stay mad, and hurt our friendship as much, if not more, than she had, because it would have been intentional on my part. I made the decision to take her out for icecream, and deal. Just because I forgave her, doesn't mean that it isn't effecting me. To say that, would be lying to only myself. I'm so hurt, not just by her, but by Olivia, and the whole situation. I just, I cry to think that I could have stopped this, some how, even though it wasn't my fault in the least. Oh, lord! I still don't know what to do. I want to trust both Olivia and Christina as much as I did before this whole thing, but now I don't think I can. I don't think I can trust anybody right now, because I am still so hurt, I still feel so used. And I honestly don't know what to do. I just don't know, anymore...

        After I wrote that last bit, I promised myself that the change would happen right then. Well, every one who is smart understands that change takes time, I know that, but I wanted a change in my attitude; a change in my day. Of course I changed my attitude, for the better, but Satan knows me, like I learned at camp, and he knew exactly what to do to get me down again; only this time, I wouldn't let him! When we first got to La Pine, Grandpa promised he would take Christina and I out on a back road to drive the pick-up. Well, today he fulfilled that promise. Christina drove first and every thing went fine; a few cars passed and the steering was a little difficult for her, but other than that, all was well. We drove out to Twin Lakes, where we got a drink; then it was my turn to drive. Every was fine at first; I backed up great, slowed to the first stop sign great, started off great! And then, I looked at the speedometer. It was at zero- I knew I was going faster than zero, because I was actually going at all. Grandpa said it would kick in soon: he was wrong. I had asked Christina to tell me when to speed up and slow down because I was a bad judge of speed. She sure let me know, like I'd asked, so I shouldn't have been upset, but it felt like she was criticizing me. She tends to be better than me at most every thing, so this just felt like another time I was doing some thing "second best". She's never said anything like that to me, so it's not her, it was me. So, here I was driving along, doing okay for not know what speed I was going, and being told to speed up every two minutes, when a junction sign came up. I asked Grandpa three times if that was the junction I needed to turn off onto, and the second time, Christina told me he would tell me when to turn. As we came almost right on it, Christina asked him. He didn't hear or reply until we were passing it. "Okay," I told myself, "I can do this." I knew Grandpa hadn't meant for me to miss the turn, or that it was my fault, but I still felt inadequate. Well, I missed the first road to turn off, so we could turn around, and then the second road came up, and I stopped really fast. And I mean FAST! It was because I was stressed and it's hard for me to calm down when something goes wrong. After getting off the highway, really fast and stopping bad, I'd had enough; Grandpa turned the tuck around and I thought I was done. Oh no, he wanted me to finish. "Okay," I told myself again, "I can do this." I wanted to change, right? Well, giving up would not help that goal, so I got back in the drivers seat, and started off, only to find that my door wasn't shut all the way. Easily fixed, I knew I could do this, only now, I didn't want to. After, Grandpa had made the statement, "Boy, when she stops, she really stops," to Christina. I don't think he realized how much that hurt me, after all those things had happened to me. I imagined that I would get home, go up stairs and cry my eyes out, as we made the last few miles home and then a thought occurred to me: 'Which of the things that had happened today were in my "center of control"?'--something I'd read from a book titled, "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens" by Sean Covey. The center of control is what you control and what you don't, and it's good to know the difference, because it's a waste of your time and energy to get upset about things out of your center of control. So I decided that it was in my center of control that I'd stopped fast, and yet that was under a stressful situation, and so it woudn't be effective to get upset over anything that happened today. I know myself and my limits, and stopping quickly is some thing I need to work on, but really couldn't be helped at that moment, so even that was in a sense out of my center of control, and therefore simply unnecessary to get angry about. It was out of my control that Grandpa had said what he had; It was out of my control that Grandpa hadn't been paying attention to the junction turn off; it was out of my control that the speedometer had broken. All of it, so getting upset, and crying over it all would get me no where, and I'm trying to move forward, remember? I'd been thinking all this, while on the way back, taking a chance to help myself, and hence was in a quiet meditation for the majority of the time. It had been decided in my mind, my center of control is over only me, my actions, and so getting upset wasn't the way. "Okay," I thought one more time, "I can do this." Only I didn't realize that as soon as I'd made that decision, Satan would work on me just a little more, hurt me just a little longer, poke and prod at me just a little bit harder. When we'd gotten home, we were telling Grandma about our eventful hour, when Grandpa said, "The ride home was the only time she'd shut up." Ouch! That hurt. I know he hadn't meant it to. I know that it was out of my center of control, but I knew the pain searing in me was louder than my reasoning; going upstairs and crying my eyes out didn't seem like too bad an idea after all. And then, something made sense; I was being tested by none other than Satan, and I was about to fail. If there's one thing I am not, it is a failure. I was not going to let Satan, that snake that can bruise a heal, get any satisfaction from me, so like a priesthood holder to a possessed soul, I bruised that serpents head, by saying to myself, "... O thou child of hell, why temp ye me? Knowest thou that the righteous yieldeth to no such temptations?" (Alma 11:23) I knew right then, without a doubt, that I would change. It will be just as hard, and take just as long, but I will not, and I repeat will not fail. The righteous yieldeth to no such temptations, and I am, no matter what I may do, say or think, a righteous person, because I love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, and have the Gift of the Holy Ghost, and I will repent forever, so I can stay righteous. This isn't a new concept, but a very helpful epiphany. God works in mysterious ways, and he helped me, in more ways than I can count, to come to this one conclusion. I have a center of control, and what some one says, no matter who much it hurts is not in it; and Satan is not in it; and I am not going to let myself be put into Satan's center of control. I will love God with every thing that I am. It's funny that I read about the "center of control" just a few days ago, and how it has changed the way I think and react SO immediately, and it's funny that Bekah Butterfield had told me her favorite scripture once (Alma 11:23) a long time ago, and I wrote it down, and remembered it. It's funny how such a bad day can turn out so good. "Okay... I can do this."

        Today is just not my day... I break two of Grandma's glasses, mess up Christina's iced mocha latte thing, lead Andrew on and then drop him like a ten point bag of potatoes, and break the promises I've meade to myself and God. And I'm two hundred and fifteen pounds. Why, oh why, do I have to go through day's like this? I've had just about enough of trying to be everything for everybody, and I'm not getting anything from it. I'm trying to be good and choose the right, but it's so hard when I can do something that no one will see... Only problem is that some one does see; Heavenly Father see's what I'm doing to myself... I see what I'm doing to myself, and I don't like it. I don't know what to do anymore. Pride is keeping me from seeking help. Well, not pride, because I feel no pride for myself or the things I've done, only hatred. Fear is what's keeping me from getting help; Fear of being judged; Fear of being judged correctly. I don't want people to see who I really am; what I really think, because that would give me what I deserve, a whole lot of lonely days to think about myself, and openly hate myself more. Maybe I should just give up. Maybe... but I know that's not the way. It's just hard to live life by the principle that is the way. Like I told Andrew, on a some what different subject, but one just as important, I know what I should do, I just don't know how do to it... I guess no one always has "happy, happy, happy day's" and I just need to make it through one more day of a bad one, to come out on a hopefully good one... If anyone could read this journal and see the difficulty I'm having at living life righteously and happy, that person would know me so well; not just my likes and dislikes, but who I really am, and I don't even know that all the way... Maybe someday I'll figure it out, just not today. I live almost differently than I write in here. A normal day will have me happy and carefree, hardly remembering Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, hardly praying or reading his words, hardly being a friend a friend would like to have. That's something I want to change. Change again... Why does it always come back to that? Because I'm finally realizing it's what I need to do for my life to be successful and what I will do. I never want to regret, so I have to make some changes... Just some changes.

        Last night Grandpa got me and asked me to come watch something with him. So I obliged, not knowing that he was going to have me watch something about "The Mormons" and their alleged "polygamous acts". Now, don't get me wrong, I love grandpa, but him trying to feed me anti-mormon things, just because a few cracked-pot jokers think incest and polygamy's the way, makes me upset. I know who I am, and where my life is going, at least in terms of my faith, so I don't need help re-deciding things. I'm happy where I am with my faith and my beliefs and it's only causing me frustrations that he did that. I know he thinks he's doing me a favor, but... it only upset me. Another reason why it upset me so much was because I couldn't tell him that the "Latter-Day Church of Christ" is not the LDS church that I practice in, and that the church no longer practices polygamy. I couldn't bring myself to get up, tell him I wasn't interested and walk away. If I can't tell Grandpa, some one that's suppose to be close to me, that the anti-stuff on TV doesn't hold any interest for me, that I'm happy with my beliefs, that I love my God and Savior, then will I be able to tell people on the street, people who may be one of God's 'ready to harvest' fruits? I know what my answer is now, "Yes, I would", but I'm hoping to change that into something as sure as my testimony of Christ. We made sour cream noodles today. It was a fun process for me, and something that requires a few people to do it, so I'm going to try to do it with my family when I get back home. Also, making dinner with Christina the two times we did has helped me to realize that I can take a lot off of mommy dearest's shoulders by cooking once or twice a week for the family. I think I"ll make that one of my Personal Progress goals, maybe as a ten hour project. And it will really help out mum. My scripture reading has sort of flopped while I have been here, but I'm hoping to pick that right back up again. I'm pretty sure I won't have the Book of Mormon entirely finished by the end of summer, but I'm going to read enough to satisfy myself and Heavenly Father. I know my floundering in my thoughts and actions has created a fault in my relationship with Heavenly Father, but I also know that I'm getting better, which helps with me wanting to get better. I prayed that I'd see some results, and I'm seeing them. Proof that I couldn't live without praying. I swear I am NOT obsessed with Andrew, it's just he's said some things and done some things that I've taken a special notice to, and he inspires me to be a better person. I met him in February on an LDS chat room. At first we just chatted like two people getting to know each other, but then it continued to come to the point where he says *kisses* and *huggles* and he gave me his cell phone number, and we text message a lot. He makes me so happy- not in an 'in love' way, but, just knowing him has made me a better person, and isn't that the type of people I should be around. I don't know... he's just awesome. I'm both glad and sad about him leaving on his mission. I know I'll miss him.

        Andrew's going away and I'm sad, because he's really helped me through the things I'm going through... I'll miss him, but he said he'll write to me and tell me about the experiences that he'll have, and it's sure he will have some awesome experiences as a missionary. I'm way excited for him, but still kind of sad he won't be on line every time I need to talk to him. Oh well. I can only pray for his success! Maybe someday in the future I'll meet some one as cool as him, closer to my age, and available to be mine! Maybe...

        I know that being the Laurel class president means I have an increase in responsibility, and I readily accept those additional responsibilities, but there are some forces in my life in which I have no control over, and some of these forces have been working against me. I have a father who makes and brakes promises, and in doing so makes hope and breaks my heart, every time. He'd rather be lost in a world of alcohol than hear my pleading voice with a sober ear. It's hard for me to be happy because of this and so I act like I'm happy. Most of the time it works, but others, it doesn't. Sometimes I wish I didn't have to get out of bed, he hurts me so much. my mother, hard as she may try has a fast and angry temper. No one's perfect, I know this, and I also know that she loves me dearly, but that doesn't always stop her from yelling about the small things like a broken dish or a basket full of unfolded laundry. Because of this, my relationship with her is dwindling, and I find myself wishing that there were no relationship to salvage. I love my sister with all that I am, and yet, she still finds a way to upset me to the point of explosion. I don't care so much about the stained clothing or the broken thing-y that she borrowed as much as the attitude she has of not caring about how it makes me feel. I have no ro-model, except for Christ, and sometimes hoping to be like him seems like such a waste of time it hurts to breathe. Missing a meeting because my alarm clock is broken; being late because my mom had me go to the store for her; not calling because I'm grounded for some missing 'Propel" water... all these things are out of my "circle of control", and if I dwell on them any longer, I will explode. The only thing I control is myself and my relationship with Christ, and so I'll work on that as long as I live, but I must give up the things I have no control over.

        Yesterday was the journey to Christina's grandparents (I call them Grandma and Grandpa) house. It was long- but it was fun. I keep hoping the ten days we're staying will be just as fun, if not more. It's hard spending so much time with Christina and Cole, but it'll be okay. The only thing I'm worried about is getting Christina angry with me before we leave, and that'll ruin my whole trip. I don't want to think about angering her but she is easily agitated and kind of moody. I haven't talked to her about her internet boyfriends yet, but again, I want her on my good side for the time being. And besides, it does kind of intreage me a little bit. I know it shouldn't but it does. I just don't know what to do or think anymore. Life isn't always fun, but I'll make it. I know I can and will.

        Once you've gone off the path it's seven times harder to come back; it's like trying to be good in dog years. I've learned this. But that doesn't mean I can't get back. I talked to Andrew again last night, and he really is rooting for me. He's one person who really is inspiring me to change my ways, because he was going through the same thing, and now he's going on a mission at the end of the month. I know I can do it, too! I just have to keep working at it, because if you're not moving forward you falling back wards and I want to quit falling and start moving forward again.

        So, I've been thinking a lot about myself and the way I want my life to be, and how I want it is not how it's going. I want that to change. Change is a hard thing to do, that is certainly something I've learned over the years, but not impossible, and besides, if it isn't hard, than it wouldn't be something worth fighting for, even if it is yourself that you're fighting against. So here's what I want to do: Change. Change who I am, how I think, what I do and say, and what I stand for. It's going to take work and it's going to be hard but it's going to be worth it. It's going to be eternally worth it. Now, I once read a very unique book called, "For Time & All Absurdity" by Robert Farrel Smith, and in it was this quote, "... a goal not written down is just a wish." So, to follow through with my goal I have to write it first (or type). I want to stop hating myself; I want to love myself. I want to think eternally and banish all harmful thoughts from my mind. I want to pay a full tithe, not through obligation, but by wanting to serve God. I want to pray regularly to my Heavenly Father and read from his words daily. I want to be married in the temple to a man who loves me but loves God more. I will.

        Let me ask you: How much of a dork can one person be? Well... Now let me answer you: One person (me) can be the biggest dork in the entire world! Here I am, complaining about working for maybe forty hours a month and having to pay a couple of bills, when Nephi is crying out in repentance because he was praying to God in a nervous fear that his brothers were going to kill him, and that was supposedly wrong, because he's had so many blessings...? Man, I have got to straighten out my priorities. It says in 2 Nephi 5 (or 6) that the Nephites learned to work with their hands, which in biblical terms means to work your freaking butt off for almost nothing in return. New goal: Try to be positive about my work. Maybe then it won't be so hard... Maybe. (Most assuredly.)

        I suppose it's best I learn this now, but work sucks. I work for a minimal three hours a day, three day sa week, four weeks a mont, get three hundred dollars a month, pay ninety dollars a month for car insurance, ten percent of my paycheck a month for tithing, pay at least twenty bucks a month for gas and have to buy anything I want and have to save money, too! What does that leave me with? Nothing but a headache because I had to do math, and some tired fingers for typing it all too fast. I said it before and I'll say it again: Work sucks!... but it pays the bills!;)

         A few nights ago my family rented a couple of movies to watch together. They were: "Along Came Polly", "The Secret Window" and "50 First Dates". They were all okay, but I only really liked one; "50 First Dates" with Drew Berrymore and Adam Sandler. Now, normally any movie with Adam Sandler is pretty useless, funny as heck, but containing no real moral or value. This movie, however, was brilliant. Though it still had some crude humor, and unnecessary sexual innuendo's, the moral and ending were beautiful. The story line is a player (Adam) who gets with tourists as weekend flings, meets a beautiful, charming girl (Drew) and falls in love with her right away. The next day, he tries to sit with her at breakfast, she seems not to recognize him, and finds him to be frightening. After finding out that she has no short term memory, Adam begins to meet her every day, for the "50 First Dates" and gets her to fall in love with him every 50 times. He makes a video for her to watch every morning, so she knows that she loves him, and the story ends with them being married with a child, her still not remembering. The reason I loved this movie so much was because the moral is: true, real love, is waking up every morning, with a fresh start, and falling in love again and again, over and over, forever and ever. That is what I want out of my life, my marriage-when I have one. So, I have to choose the right guy to make me fall in love with him every day. Here are just some things I would look for in this man: *He loves me completely*

        "My Dearest Love, I want you to know that I believe in you. I believe that you have what it takes to make your dreams come true, and I just want you to know that I'll be there beside you through both the good times and the bad times. I 'll be your light and warmth when the road gets rough. I'll lend you a shoulder; I'll hold your hand when you hesitate. I know you can make it. Never stop trying! You never know what you can achieve or where your dreams will take you! I love you!" That was an e-mail I got once from a friend, and I wanted to always remember those words. When I replied to that e-mail she told me that she hadn't written it, but it had captured everything she felt, so I sent it to my sisters, and it's a chain reaction, because I found a note Cheyanne had written to her friend, which had the same message on it. When I think about it, it's exactly what our heavenly father would say to us, if we would just listen long or hard enough. My goal is to share these words and listen to the words of God.
