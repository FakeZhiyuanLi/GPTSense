      Pay day today! Woo hoo!  NEWS:  I am thinking about applying at UNLV law school as well.  It is CHEAP, and I love Las Vegas.  Plenty of jobs.  But I don't know how much housing will be.  I need to research Vegas some more. :)  However, if I find some other cheap law schools that are good, I might apply for them as well.  I have about $18,500 to work with.  We'll see...

      Well, I stayed with my friend Cori last night.  She's pretty cool. :) ... We watched Erin Brokovich last night, good movie, although I was a bit tired, so I couldn't get into it as much as I wanted to.  Oh well, maybe I'll try it again later.  I figured out, now, what my "admission index" will be for Lewis and Clark Law School.  If I get a 160 on the LSAT, I will have a 2.51 index.  165 means 2.71 index.  170 means 2.91 index.  I've scoring between 156 and 162 on the pre-tests, so I think a 160 is more realistic than a 170.  We'll see on October 2nd.  I'm kind of overwhelmed with this law school thing right now.  It seems there's all these prep courses, associations, and outlines and stuff you should buy in addition to all the law school books you are required to by.  ACK!  I'm talking about the ABA, Bar/Bri, things like that.  I learned that if you are an attorney in either Oregon, Washington, or Idaho, after 3 years of practicing law, you can apply for the 2 other states' bar without retaking the bar exam.  Nice!  Sounds good to me.  51 days until PCC beings.  I can't wait for school.  For some reason, I miss it so much!  Today Cori and I went to the Tonkon Torp picnic, it was pretty cool to hang out with the folks from work, but there wasn't much food, and it got boring after a while because I didn't see a bunch of my "friends" there (people with whom I want to associate with).  Oh well, it was still interesting to see all the attorneys "out of their element". :)  I'm exhausted right now.  I think I may have some kind of cold.  I got a cough, scratchy throat, I'm very hungry, yet sick to my stomach.  Hmmmmm ... who knows.

      OK, so I managed to get a copy of the June 2004 LSAT test.  Woo hoo!  That will help me study immensely.  The two library books that I have are due on the 15th, and I can't renew them, so I have 10 days left to study with them.  Hopefully, on the 13th, I will have some extra money so I can buy my own LSAT study book.  Last night, it was probably about 70 to 75 degrees, and it started raining in the evening!  I couldn't believe it! ... oh well.  I guess that is Portland, Oregon for you.
