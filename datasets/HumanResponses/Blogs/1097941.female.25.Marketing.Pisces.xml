      Give thy thoughts no tongue, Nor any unproportioned thought his act. Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar. Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel; But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in, Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee. Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice; Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment. Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy; For the apparel oft proclaims the man, And they in France of the best rank and station Are of a most select and generous chief in that. Neither a borrower nor a lender be; For loan oft loses both itself and friend, And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. This above all: to thine ownself be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man. Farewell: my blessing season this in thee! - Polonious (Hamlet)

      One thing  Restless tonight Cause I wasted the light Between both these times I drew a really thin line It’s nothing I planned And not that I can But you should be mine Across that line  If I traded it all If I gave it all away for one thing Just for one thing If I sorted it out If I knew all about this one thing Wouldn’t that be something  I promise I might Not walk on by Maybe next time But not this time  Even though I know I don’t want to know Yeah I guess I know I just hate how it sounds 		   	 www.fingereleven.com

      Long time no talk guys...  I guess I should catch you all up to speed.  I moved back home to New Fairfield, CT back in mid April, I'm once again a suporvisor at Starbucks and up for management training, and I have met the most amazing man.  Yes, I'm dating a paramdeic.  Go figure...  LOL.  He's a sweetheart.  I'll tell you more later.  The cats are now 16 months old and love my parents house.  Way too much fun exploring and getting into trouble.  LOL.  My babies are getting so big!  Picking up the pieces and starting over again.  I'm glad to be out of Newport and away from my life there.  It was just a bad deal all around.  I miss a few individuals from there, but over all I'm glad I left.  So to Newport I leave you all with a big, 'FUCK YOU!'  Don't let the door hit you on the way out Newport.  You treated me like shit and now that is all you are to me.    P.S. I modified my Blog and lost all of my new posts so that's why it jumps from July to February.  Oops...

      ...the irony of mourning people who kill themselves is that the love felt for the dead is insufficient to have prevented then from dying in the first place. It's a special agony to feel feelings that are acute but belated. If suicides result from a longing to be understood, or touched, or reached, maybe it's not inappropiate for those who remain to feel forsaken, to be forced to endure a somber feast of years. If they feel like failures, maybe it's because in essence or in fact they failed. They didn't mind time, connect in time, communicate in time. Somehow time is most seriuosly implicated, and of all things, that idea made me saddest - makes me saddest.

      It was that double failure that moved me the most - the failure of her life and her failure to depart from it.  I wonder if her early end was inevitable, but temporarily postponed.  Maybe you cannot stop death from coming to the dying.  It must require a massive exertion of consciousness to reach a conclusion that is in such direct opposition to nature.  Unless of course, that conclusion is not oppositional at all.  For who can be certain that suicide is not just one particular doorway to death - death being in and of itself irrefutably natural?  Why should those who take their lives at once be any more criminal than those who do it tediously, with noxious living, with dope and vodka and nicotine, junk food and idle regrets, with behaviour that hurts people other than themselves over and over again?  And yet, there are those who endure agony to live.  When the will to survive is present, it is so sure, so clear - what if the determination is not present, not celar?  What if a person has been made weary before their time?

      Most of us in this &nbsp;day and age are addicted to some form of on line chatting.&nbsp; I happen to use instant messenger all the time.&nbsp; I met a guy recently who rapidly became a good friend.&nbsp; I started talking to him from hot or not.&nbsp; yes, thank you, I can already hear the laughter writing this, and finally met him face to face last night.&nbsp; I went to an open mic night and got to listen to him sing and play his guitar.&nbsp; It was awesome.&nbsp; When I woke up this morning this is what I found in an IM from him....   &nbsp;  'thank you, you really made me feel good lastnight being there. You are finding a special place in my heart, who are you? where did you come from? I don't know but I'm glad you drop in my life :-D'   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ......&nbsp; love you too Scotty.&nbsp; Can't wait for the show Monday night.&nbsp; {{hugs}}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now isn't that just an awesome way to wake up?&nbsp; Not to mention making a great friend, but it made me feel really good.&nbsp; (:
