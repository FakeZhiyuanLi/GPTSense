      I haven't been able to keep posted because i've been traveling. my starting point was in a small army base in New York. Ft. Drum. i was driven to albany then spent two desolate days there. i had no internet connection. after that we flew to detroit and spent a couple hours there. then we flew to Los Angeles. after looking around for an hour we drove to San Diego. that's where i am now. in about two days i going to disneyland. after that Ontario canada. i don't  know exactly what i'm going to be doing in ontario. i do know that we'll spend at least a week there in a hotel.

      Earlier i told you about a party. i went to that had much soooo much fun. i ain't going into too much detail about dat. the big barbecue was a big sucess. I managed to run the grill and keep the guest entertained at the same time. My mother and sister and cousins all lent a useless halping ow and then. in the end it was me and my brother. my mother who decided to have trhe barbecue and invite alllll her friends and children. i was in charge of alll these people. nobody had any complaints about how i did it either. it was my first barbecue too. i am so proud of that accomplishment

      Whatever i said i meant it the best the possible way. i said that because not only do we think completely differently but you think more geniously than me. i would like to get inside your mind for one day (and plant a virus)and just figure out how you think. it's almost like i'm jealous. (syke) I clikcked on that link that said the similarity is shocking or something like that. thes stupid cars showed up and it made me mad. i check out the BK site. i think there is a database that the closet phrase is matched to. i told punch the T.V. and it punched itself. I told it to go in the kitchen and get a knife. it started rolling around on the ground. i turned off my compute rafter that. n e ways pEaCe!

      Right now I can't sleep, so I was just lookin through profiles for somebody to talk to. I saw a picure of one of the most finest latino girls i have ever seen. i sent her an e-mail to try and get something together. I have not gotten a response back yet. If i don't I'll just have to cut my losses and stick to friends i can actually kiss. I think her name is Aileen, or something like that

      Toady I had a troublsome day. I had to prepare for a barbecue on Sunday. My mom is throwing one for all her friends that helped her through the loss of her husband. At the same time I was trying to arrange a party on saturday. So far everything is looking good. I am throwing my own goodbye party because I'm moving and nobody I know as any organization skills. At least not as good as mine.
