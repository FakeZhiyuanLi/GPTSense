       I'm one tenth finished with my Religion Assignment! Woo! Be proud, y'all, be proud. >oP I'm still thinking about how Martin told me that 'everyone hates me' today.. I didn't take it seriously this morning, but right now I can't help but wonder whether it's true or not.. *worries while munching on Sweet Chilli and Sour Cream chips*      I have a fair bit to worry about (in order):      the immunisation I'm receiving on Monday (even though it's not  that  bad)      Finishing my RE assignment      The talent show heat      Mercy Day talent show (if I make it past the heat)      Yearly exams.       Ain't it great?   Gonna treat myself to like, 4 Krispy Kreme donuts tomorrow!!!! How excitement! Well I'm gonna try to finish my religion assignment now. Take care and ci vediamo!!

       Ooh yes. It's the weekend once again. And, boy, I am fookin' happy about it.      Just started my Religion assignment- I'm one tenth through! It's meant to be 1200 words, and I've typed 131. >oD  I hope I finish this stupid assignment tomorrow.. There's even an oral component.. Grr..  I hate Religion .      I'm so bummed- Ricki-Lee Coulter's gonna be singing "Can't Get Enough Of Your Love" by Taylor Dayne on Australian Idol on Sunday. That's like,  my song ! Well, not  my  song, but I like singing it, y'know? And I was hoping I could sing it on Idol one day, but now I can't. Waaah. Nyehh. Baaah.      LOL, Comedy Inc parodied Hilary Duff's video for "Come Clean".. "My bathroom has too many windows.. I really should get curtains...But I always forget."

       Yes I'm still bummed that my favouritest forum is on hiatus.. But there's nothing I can do, so nyehh.      My ITS teacher is away again, so I'm on a free again. Teehee. >oP      We're having some kinda seminar about use of make-up next Wednesday. At school. It's like, thanks for the reaffirmation that  I'm ugly !! Honestly..just when I was starting to realise my  inner beauty  they remind me that I need make-up... Stupid school...      *breathes and thinks happy thoughts* Today's Lasagne Day! (Every Friday, they have lasagne at the canteen.) I'd get two, but I only have $2.60 in my pocket.. Oops. I'll be prepared next Friday.      Does anyone know how to sing "Someone To Watch Over Me"? I'm planning to sing it at the talent show heat.      Kate is posting a comment on my last post, so I'd better publish this before she sends it...

       My favouritest forum ever is on hiatus!!!! Nooooo! And it's all because of stupid guests attacking my friends. ='o(  It kills me when my friends are upset and there's nothing I can do...      Well, it's 3pm right now... I got home 2 and a bit hours ago.. I'm so glad the Society assignment's out of the way now.. I should've started the Religion assignment when I got home, but nyehh.       OMG, the heats for the talent show are either tomorrow or next Friday.. I'm not prepared!!! I still don't know what to sing!!! *starts hyperventilating* *stops* *goes to make another ham and cheese sandwich*      *comes back* Listening to "A Day In The Sun" by Hilary Duff... I'm just remembering how much I love this album.. Even though Hil's singing ability isn't anything super-stellarly-special, I still love the tracks. *switches to Come Clean*  It's been raining lately, which is good news for those who need rain, but bad news for me. It'd be good if I could go out and dance and splash in puddles like in a movie montage, but no. *ahem*      I know this sounds so totally gross, but the scab on my face came off! I'm so happy because I can see that the wound is getting much better. I'm getting closer to having a normal face again! ("Who said your face was normal before?")      I'm gonna go. >oP

       I finished my S&C assignment yesterday! Woo! Go me. Now onto my Religion assignment... Nyehhh.      I'm in IPT right now...The school computer network system thingo has crashed so the due date of our IPT assignment is postponed. =oD  Convenient. We have an IPT lesson  tomorrow, so I shouldn't get too excited. >oP      Rubberneckin' Version 2 is up! I'm so happy! But I still need a donut. I'm  this close  to going insane. "I must get a Krispy Kreme donut before I too go totally mad. ..Too late." I  looooove  Puss In Boots.      How does orange look on pink, by the way??

       After pissing me off for several days, BlogSpot has let me blog! *raises fist triumphantly*      So what's been going on with me..? Um, I got around to starting my S&C assignment...  yesterday ! I'm gonna go home early today: 1) to get out of the subjects I hate and 2) to finish my S&amp;C assignment, which is due  tomorrow !! I hate procrastinating so much, but I really can't help it.. I'm definitely starting my religion assignment tomorrow.. (Let's see if I keep  that  promise..)  >oP      I have a free 3rd period! My math teacher's away again...woooooooo-fookin-hoooooo! >oD  I should work on my S&C assignment during that period.. *strokes chin and does the weirdo eyebrow thing*      Ooh, Daniel Belle made it into the Top 12 of Australian Idol! (Is it top  12 ?) And I didn't even have to vote! I just saved 55cents, woo! >oP  He's so cool... I was so nervous while waiting for his name to be announced instead of Liza's. (Don't get me wrong, I like Liza, it's just that I   love   Daniel.) My brain could have exploded. *makes a pic of Daniel for her phone's wallpaper*  Ooh, I sense an unhealthy obsession..      My ITS teacher is right in front of me.. He hates me so much.. Maybe I should start doing work.. or stop coming to class. Or hire a hitman.

        Just watched the Olympic synchronised swimming finals.. Pretty cool sport actually.. I like it.. Especially when one of them jumps off or lands in the water before the other one/s... LOL, I'm evil.      OMG I should really start my Society assignment.. Okay, start  tomorrow . Geez, I'm hopeless.      LOL how funny are those Police Academy movies?! I love Zed..      Mahoney: "Come on, let's talk."    Zed: "I'm not in the mood! *stops* Okay, I'm in the mood! So..where are ya from??!"  XoD      I found this site bursting with Paul McCartney pics and I was like  this close  to wetting myself. He was so  hot  spankworthy 30-40 years ago... *sigh*       I'm eating the new Cadbury Dairy Milk Malt Crisp block... =o9 I was eating a pack of chocolate pretzels before..I love them because they remind me of my childhood.. ='o( *seriously needs a glass of water*      I deleted 60MB of crap from my computer! *beams with pride* And I deleted lots of stupid pics from my phone too.. But I accidentally deleted a folder full of pics of my buds..Which is a major drag... *goes off to munch on chocolate pretzels*

       Yup, that's what I'm listening to right now.. But not Macca's version, Roselle Nava's. I'd like to sing this for that talent thingo, but the audience would be asleep by the third note... >oP My Love is such a sweet song.. Paul and Linda wrote it together, y'know.. *sigh*      I really should get started on my S&C assignment.. *procrastinates too much* I really need a Krispy Kreme donut right now... or some chocolate.. Too bad I ate everything sweet in the bloody kitchen, now there's nothing but savoury stuff. Nyyeeeehh.      Woohoo- I just won Solitaire...again. For the third time. Aww I wish I had a dog, so we could be best buds >oP      I got up at 3:30 this morning to watch the Opening Ceremony..I fell asleep 20 minutes in.. What the hell was that?! Snoozefest 2004?       And when I go away, I know my heart can stay with my love.. It's in the hands of my love, and my love does it good.....         Do you think Last Dance by Donna Summer is appropriate to sing at talent quest?          Last dance..last chance for love..yes it's my last chance for romance tonight.. I need you by me, beside me, to guide me, to hold me, to scold me, coz when I'm bad I'm so so bad..       Sounds more like a wedding song, right? Dang... How about Heaven? Not the shitty Bryan Adams or DJ Sammy version, Nina's one..       Never been any good at love, never could find no one that I dreamed of..Must've been too blind to see you were always there waiting for me.. Then the spell was broken, my eyes opened, started believing in love again..Just when I gave up on miracles, you rescued me and showed me the way....       Sounds good to me. >oP OMG, my dreams are sooo stupid. Last night, in my dream, I ordered a chocolate pizza. Seriously. I  did ! My dreams are so unbitchin' ATM.. I'm gonna go scramble some eggs.

       Having one free today is really cool, but it'd be great if it wasn't for a subject like ITS, which is a bludge anyway. It'd be mad if my English teacher was away... But  noooooo  she can't be.      *SIGH* Well, today is Friday the 13th... I've heard that weird things can happen.. Maybe I'll get a boyfriend today? Or be offered a recording contract? >oP  I just looked at my S&C assignment sheet- it doesn't look hard at all! I'll probably be able to finish it in like, two nights. I know I was  supposed    to make a start yesterday arvo, but nyeeeh. Since when do I keep my own promises?      I've been having really weird dreams lately... Like, everything that takes place is so stupid.. Last night, my whole family (kooky grandparents included) were involved in some Tennis tournament... BIZARRE. But I guess they're better than the dreams that cause heartbreak when I wake up.. Haven't had those in a while...      I'm getting so much better- I'm thinking less and less about Mark... It's great because it usually takes me several months to get over someone, and it's only been about 2ish weeks. *SIIIIGGGGHHH*      Kate is reading my fanfiction on the computer behind me... Kinda worried because I can't write stories for shhhhooott. Well I'm gonna go look for info about Old English sheepdogs... I want one!

       Try this out, groovy chicks!   urlLink  http://kerrysbeatles.0catch.com/girlmadlib.html       A Girl's Letter To Her Favorite Beatles     Dear Paul,I am your Beautiful fan. I think The Beatles are the Stellarest band ever!My friend Kate thinks that George is the cutest, but I say you are much better blinking than he is. I find your blue eyes and your ugly smile and your cute little eye so attractive. And your voice - ARGH!! Your talent for eating fascinates me. How do you write such pink songs? 'Magical Mystery Tour' is my favorite. Did you write that one?Pardon me for being talk, but do you have a girlfriend? Because, if you don't, I think we'd make a really sweet couple. I know that I live in Sydney and you live all the way in Liverpool, but the magazines say you're tall rich - so you could afford lots of horse rides to come and see me. If you do have a girlfriend, I bet she's not as hard as me. I've enclosed a sexy bracelet of myself. Do you think I'm grey looking?I hope we can meet sometime and maybe have a nice time swimming.      Embarrassingly yours,    Camille   XOXOXO

Now I'm listening to And I Love Her... All the Beatles songs were so sweet back in the 60s...      Listening to Boys again.... So suss... OMG, I have nothing to blog about! And I have like 5 minutes left!! I really should be doing my Society essay about Personal Reflection.. But nyehh.

I changed the font size to 12 so it fills the page >oD  Honestly, who the fook wants to write about a bloody country's development?  Not me.         I'll blog again in my Math free.

        I am SO pissed off! I had typed up so much before, ready to publish, but then when I highlighted it, all the text disappeared!  GRR...      Oh well, I'll try to make up for it here...      The OC was so good last night! I'm slowly becoming a Summer/Seth 'shipper.. They're not bad together at all..quite cute really. =o/  Next week, Anna Stern comes back and the Summer/Seth/Anna triangle continues... Having to wait one week sucks... OMG Julie Cooper is a cow! I know she's just a character, but if I ever see the actress who plays her on the streets (when I go to the US, nyahh) I'll probably end up whacking her with my handbag or whatever I'm holding.      My bud Jess just showed me some pics of a guy called Blue..yes that's his real name.. My verdict: he is very cute. >oD      Since today's Wednesday, the school timetable and belltimes are screwy.

I.e: we spend an extra ten minutes in homeroom pretending to ponder about our development and spirituality, while just sitting around staring at walls/ceilings/chalkboards and just being pissed off by the fact that our lunch is chopped by ten minutes because of it.      I have PDHPE next... I'm so dropping it at the end of the year.. I hope I can sell the textbooks I no longer need at the end of the year.. I also hope that I sell them for a good price..

       So how does green look? Just waiting for The OC to come on.. I'll be waiting for another half hour, so I thought I might blog for a bit.      Two things are pissing me off: MSN Messenger and BlogSpot. MSN wont let me send IMs, and BlogSpot isn't helping with the group blog that my buds and I want to set up. B-E-A-U-TIFUL.      I'm listening to John Lennon's Imagine ATM... Such a great song. *switches to a different song* Now I'm listening to 'Boys'... Great song too, but why the hell didn't they change it to 'Girls'? Makes Ringo sound...funny.      Guess what I found today? The CD single of Savage Garden's I Knew I Loved You! I can't escape that song! I hear it on the radio and everything  all the time ! >o[      Spent a lot of time daydreaming about 1960's Paul McCartney today... Just can't help myself.. Well, if you were a girl like me, would you rather think about trig, functions or boys?    Ooh, The OC's on in 5ish minutes! One hour of Adam Brody goodness... =o9 LaTeRz!!!

       In Info Tech Support right now... Still glad to be back at school...    I'm pissed because the invitation Sylv sent me (to join her blog) won't work..     (Note to self: ask her to send the invitation  again .)       Kate's behind me trying to set up her own blog, and Anna's on another computer doing...God knows what.      I'm slowly coming to terms with the fact that I don't have a chance with * whisper Mark whisper *. Sad... But I'm training myself to think about him less and less.. It's kinda working.. NOT. ='o{      BlogSpot isn't working for Kate and Anna...for some reason. *gives blogspot.com the evil eye*   This is just  great . Pushes us one more step back from being able to set up our group blog...Grr. >o[      Something tells me I should do work... In a minute, that  something  will be my teacher. Hm.. what classes have I got tomorrow? English, Religion, IPT, PDHPE and S&C.. Grrreat. Pretty bad, considering the only subject I like out of those five is IPT. I guess the other subjects are alright, since I have buds..but I just don't like learning without computers!!      BlogSpot  still  isn't working for Kate and Anna... It won't let them register..

OMG my bud Carah just showed me a topless pic of James Marsters... =o9 So spankworthy...      I realise I could get into a lot of trouble with this blog, but I'll gladly take the risk if it cures my boredom. The OC is on tonight!! Yay!!! =oD      OMG, all these other people on frees are coming into our seminar room....aughghghghghg!!   (That was Sylvia, BTW.) We're putting a sign on the door that says ' NO MORE ROOM '...      I wanna watch this DVD Kate burned (burnt?) for me... It's the Beatles Anthology 3 & 4.. Paul McCartney was such a spunk back then... I slap whoever thinks his marriage to Heather Mills is based on true love. She has one friggin' leg...and she had a baby last year! How was it conceived???

       Hm... I'm kinda upset because Ngaiire didn't get through to the next round of Australian Idol.. but it's cool 'cause she'll probably come back for the Wildcard show... =oD      OMG I nearly finished a whole block of Hazelnut Cadbury.. But that's good- it'll bring me closer to 50kilos... 4 more kilos! I hate being 46kilos so much... And my weight is never constant.. Nyehhh.       I have like, 3 assessments.. Religion, Info Processes Tech and Society & Culture... GRRREAT.      For Religion, it's comparing and contrasting bloody religions  again ..just like the last assessment we got. Honestly, where's the variety in things?     For IPT, we have to advertise something (yes I told you about that in my last post)      And for S&amp;C, we gotta compare Vietnam and Australia.  FUN.        The OC's on tomorrow, yay! Adam Brody...spankworthy and spunkilicious. =o9  I dunno, Ben McKenzie (is that his name? Y'know who I mean- the guy who plays Ryan) just doesn't do anything for me... =oP  Especially with that stupid sideways face thing he does! Honestly! Take a drink each time he does it in one episode, and you're drunk by the end. Along with Summer's EWs... And all the bikinis at the parties... And Jimmy Cooper's sighs... I love The OC drinking game! LOL... but no, I don't consume any alcohol, and I doubt I ever will. (There's a useless fact for ya.)      Useless Camille Fact #284:  I always fall for the wrong guys.

       In IPT right now... Gonna start an assignment... We have to create some advertising campaign thingo... I want to promote my 'band'... >oP  Working with Radha...nyeeehhh. I don't think I can really blog much right now... But I'll try my best. >oD      I'm still pissed about the whole 'not getting his number' situation... But I should be over it in a few days... Through comfort eating, schlumping around and moping. I can't help thinking about the whole degrees-of-separation thing.. Right now, it's like, two degrees..  Okay , I'll stop talking about him now! See how obsessive I can be at times? >oP      It's so good to be back at school.. I missed everyone.. I even missed sitting in Maths daydreaming and not understanding the work... My bud Anna came back from globetrotting.. Brought me some stuff from Budapest, ain't that cool? I let my bud Carah borrow my A Hard Day's Night DVD.. She'll have more time to watch it, now that her Japanese exchange student's gone...      *looks to her left* Radha's not working... She's blogging too... About her 'boyfriend' Darren.. I've met Darren, but when I asked about whether something was going on between them, he made a face that made it clear that he wouldn't want to touch her with a ten foot pole..      I'm just looking for tips on how to make a flyer's layout... Got 4ish minutes left... Better stop blogging. I'll blog again later!

       I feel like blogging again... I really want to go back to that supermarket to see if  he  is still working there.. I was like, a 5 minute drive away from that supermarket last night... Went to visit my newest cousin.. She's a few months old and she's such a cutie. Very talkative, like her cousin. >oP  Anyhoo, yeah.. I'm just thinking  (Me? Thinking? WOW!)..  Thinking about how bad it would be if Mark was reading this. It'd kinda decrease my chances with him, wouldn't it? Nyah well. Who says I have a chance in the first place?      My little sis is watching the Yellow Submarine DVD, right behind me. All Together Now is playing...        " Black ,  white ,  green ,  red , can I take my friend to bed?"       If I was of legal age in the 60's, I'd heck love Paul McCartney to be my best bud... >oP  Speaking of buds, three of mine are gonna see a Pete Murray gig tonight.. In my opinion, Bail Me Out would be a great song without vocals.. LOL, my friend Kaz just said she wouldn't pay more than $15 to see him in concert.. Nyeh, neither would I. Grr, I am a wee bit annoyed by Miranda Murphy's video clip for "That Girl"! I feel like slapping whoever came up with that idea to dress her up in famous vidclip outfits... That was my idea for my own first vidclip!! I aspire to be a famous singer, see. >o[  Ah well, maybe I'll just dress up as other famous people for my CD's lyric booklet. >oP  I'm also planning to be 'Paul' in the first kick-ass all-girl Beatles tribute band.. If there already is a kick-ass all-girl Beatles tribute band, email me! =o0      My sister just asked me to press 'Skip' on the DVD remote control- she doesn't like 'Only A Northern Song'.. It's like, WHY NOT?! The animation is full of psychadelic goodness, creep. Aww Jeremy Hillary Boob Ph.D is so cute! His annoying habits remind me of me... >oD  "Adhoc, adloc, quid pro quo..so little time, so much to know! Haha!"   He's a real Nowhere Man...       I just love the backing vocals on Nowhere Man...all those "ah...la la la" bits... LOL, I need a life.

       Okay, the last time I saw 'him' was not two years ago!! *gasps overdramatically at what she has just remembered* I remember now! My family and I went to The Philippines last year.. and we bought lots of packets of M&M's and blocks of Cadbury's (as heaps of Filipino-Australians do when they plan to go to The Phils.. quality chocolate and stuff is apparently expensive over there, so we bring 'pasalubong' for our Filipino relatives)... I remember my mom and I went to that supermarket at like, 10PM! And he served us... and he was really nice, I could've melted on the friggin' supermarket floor.. And he wished us well and aahhh... So that was one week before we left for The Phils... October! So the last time I saw him before the party was...*counts on fingers*.. OMG 10 MONTHS AGO?!!  I wish I could remember these things on demand, and not so spontaneously...

       My internet connection is being stupid... It's disconnecting me after, like, 18ish minutes. And after that, it takes 4 attempts before it actually connects... I hate dial-up so much. I don't think I'll afford broadband for another five decades. I have a few assignments.. But I can't be bothered doing them now... Can you blame me??      Just listening to some Filipino music now... I miss The Philippines quite a bit. All the great music, food, hot weather... But I don't miss the cold showers. =o  Hot water heaters are quite pricey over there (apparently), so I didn't really have a choice. But at least I saved water. My showers were like, 3 minutes max over there... Here, mine are like, 15 minutes max.. Which is horrible because we have water restrictions. Nyehh.. =oS         Loving you...woah...is such an easy thing to do...No, you never know...it's driving me crazy 'cause it grows and grows..But I won't let it stop, no I'm not giving up..Loving you..just a bit too much..         *double-clicks internet icon*  Wow! I've been connected for 27 minutes! Hope it stays.. If not, then I'm gonna call my ISP and abuse whoever answers. With my singing ;oP         Foolish heart, hear me calling...stop before you start falling... Foolish heart, heed my warning... you've been wrong before, don't be wrong anymore...

        Okay... Where do I begin? I got a truckload to write about... So I'll just stick to what's on my mind ATM.      Today was my last day of work placement.. At a place called Technicorp.. Sounds swanky enough, but it was a surprisingly very small office. They had like, what, 4 computers there? But it was alright- if it gets me out of school for a week, it's cool with me. The Manager there hardly gave a rat's ass about me.. I'd just stand there and ask politely- "So what am I going to do today?" or "So what should I do now?" and a couple of times, he'd just grunt and that'd be it. Then I'd go off into the other room ( with a TV, radio and scotch...didn't take advantage of free liquor- DANG ) and just do some 'data entry' ( i.e Copy and Paste ). Well I'm glad it's over: I've missed my friends too much.      I've been thinking about this guy I saw last Saturday... Let me fill you in. I've 'known' him for a couple of years now.. He worked at the supermarket near my Nan's place, and whenever we'd do groceries for her, he'd be there... serving me and my Mom at the counter, or bumping into him at any random aisle... Yet I never knew his name.. I don't know why I never noticed his nametag... Nyeh weird me. Anyhoo, yeah, turns out his mom is like the bestie of this lady my mom used to work with and is great buds with. And that lady's 50th birthday party was last Saturday...and I kinda knew he'd be there, so I kinda tried to make myself look spankworthy, but of course, all I can manage is a decent look. Nyehh. So my family and I got to the venue of the party.. and we just sat, waiting for the party to start. (It was a swanky kinda thing- with performances and stuff, not just an eat and run kinda thing..) and I was fiddling with my nametag on the table- kinda funny really..here's a pic:   Then I looked up, and  there he was . And at that moment, the DJ played "I Knew I Loved You"... I know, I know, it's pathetic as all heck, but to me it was the sweetest.. I gave myself a mission to get his phone number by the end of the party, but I failed miserably. I kept looking at him the whole time to see if we could make eye contact somehow... and we did a few times, but I guess he was just looking at whoever was behind me or next to me at the time. Then at the end, when he got up to leave I smiled and waved at him, and he smiled and waved back. I doubt he even remembers who I am.. He must've been like "Okay..some weird chick is just smiling and waving at me, so I'll just smile and wave back...WHO  IS  SHE?!"   So I'm hoping I come across someone else who knows him.. Like, a degrees-of-separation kinda thing.. Filipinos have a crapload of links to people (especially in the Woodcroft area). I really want to ask the birthday celebrant lady (she's really sweet) for his number, but that'd just be wrong.. And what if he has a girlfriend already? *SIGH* Just so my buds know who I'm talking about... I had a look at his nametag, and his name's Mark. (Forgive me, if you ever read this, Mark.)      Anyways... My voice is getting much better and I'm glad. I've had a cold for about a week, and the Year 11 heats for this school talent quest I'm gonna enter are on next week.. I'm still thinking about what to sing..      My choices:       Only Hope - Mandy Moore       Heaven - Nina       Foolish Heart - Nina       Jealous - Nina (Can you tell that I like Nina's songs?)       Open - Roselle Nava       Breathe - Michelle Branch       Just Believe - Sarah Geronimo       So yeah.. I need something sweet and simple, with just an added high note to impress my poor audience.. Any suggestions??    I'm majorly bummed that my favouritest forum ever is gone... It was called Rubberneckin' Dhani Harrison Forum and the maddest people were on there... We had like, 88 members, and I had nearly 500 posts!! Seriously bummed!! Anyways, we were all pretty strong buds on that forum, so hopefully Rubberneckin's Creator will create a stellar Rubberneckin' Version 2.0?? *wink*    Well I'd better set my profile and stuff... >oP
