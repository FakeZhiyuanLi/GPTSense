      Current Music: Blink 182 - I Miss You (WM.com) Current Mood: Content with being. Digits of Pi Calculated: 3.14592653  *Big Dragon Yawn*      It's THRUSDAY!  Now normally I wouldn't be this excited except that it’s a long weekend and today was the last day! Yay.  Tomorrow I’m going to work with my dad, a little extra money never hurt.  Mr. Allen from Allen's Jewelers came today, designed our class rings, and came home to find out that he screwed up mine.  He didn't put down anything about the stone, so need to get that fixed, and I swear that he will mess up the Latin because the C in cogito ergo sum (I think therefore I am) looks like a g and all of his g's look like q's.  They already messed up my mom's diamond ring, so I’m pretty skeptical.  My ring size is about 11 and a half, about the size of my dad's hand.     I wish I could take Latin, but Copenhagen doesn't offer any Latin courses on distance learning or anything.  I also want to find some advanced mathematics and physics courses online also... free if possible, I just want to get a feel for them before I go.  I really want to go for computer technology, maybe some robotics, mathematics, physics, astronomy, physiology, biology, and some chemistry thrown in also.  But really, I will never be able to do all of it so I’ll have to cut it back to something less.  I'm going to have to fight for tuition and scholarships next year, my class may look dumb but there pretty tough, tougher than many of the past grades.     I forgot to eat today.  I didn't have time for breakfast, missed lunch for my class ring order, and skipped the leftover surprise for supper tonight.  I didn't miss it that much, since I already gained 30 pounds from last summer.  This summer I am so intent at using the treadmill it's not funny.  Well anyway *eep* I better *eep* go back *eep* to *eep* sleeping *eep eep eep*  BE Gone with you vile EEPS!! *meep!* ... Great... LATER all! :)  ~peace

      Current Music: FFH - Fly Away + the radio telling me that there is going to be a severe thunder and lightning storm tonight... YAY!! Current Mood: Angry- mostly at myself Digits of Pi Calculated: 3.1459265  I'm just going to open right now and tell all of you that I’m sorry.  Mostly Garret, I’m just too stupid to notice that I’ve been a jerk and everything. Jason if you could, just let him know that I was just really angry at no one, and I'm sorry that I had dragged him down and burned any kind of friendship we had left.  I feel like I just lost someone I cared about again, and really wish that I could start this year over like how it was suppose to go.  It seems that right before every summer I screw it up again, well I’m sorry.  I've removed any kind of post that would pull you down, and hope that I won't post anything like that again.  I've actually talked to God last night; it was the first time in about two weeks.  If my sister reads this, I don't care if it sounds stupid or whatever; it’s just what I believe and what I think.  Oh God, I just want everything back the way it was, but I’m on the point of giving up.  Like Mrs. Griffins favorite saying, its like sand through my fingers.  Its true, friends are hard to hold onto, especially when they make others, you feel left out.  And now it’s my turn to feel this way.  God is about the only person who I can talk to nowadays, and I really need His guidance if he can give any.  I know why you (Garret) gave up on me, I was becoming too worldly I guess, and since you wanted to remove yourself from all these worldly things, I was next.  Well, I’m sorry for acting stupid, and I guess then if you really don't care about me anymore that’s fine.  I've known how stressed our friendship has been and it causes you more tension than its worth.  Jason, you were right, God can be my friend I guess.  I'm beginning to think it may be a good thing not having any close friends, because then there is no one to leave you.  God will always be there whether I know it or not, and I respect that.  I estimate that by the beginning of next year I shouldn't have any close friends, and I’m ok with that.  I hope that Garret, you and I could go to Pennsylvania once more some day, maybe for a week.  Thanks for being my best friend for a while, you were really cool.  Thanks Jason for being online, you were the only one who asked me about my day or how I was and I’m grateful for such things.  And I thank God for always being willing to accept me even when I’m stupid.  And of course, I’m sorry if I screwed up anyone’s feelings and I’m sorry I messed up peoples plans, because I know from experience that everything is better if I just keep my mouth shut and leave people alone.  ~Later

       Current Music: My Own Thoughts Current Mood: Crappy Digits of Pi Calculated: 3.145926  Well, today sucked and I’m sure that no one cares. There will probably be a grand total of 3 people who ever glance at this. It’s been a week, and for not having a life I really have no time.  I made a little kid cry on the bus. And if you watch the bus can video it looks like I was beating him up also. One little kid on the bus is such a jerk. He sits ahead of me, and all the way home, he throws things at you, beats on the seat, whacks you on the head, and beats up his sister. And today it was the end of it. He whacked me on the head with a roll of paper, so I grabbed it and through it to his sister, Video View: 'I took the kids papers, taunting him, and gave them to his sister so that he would go after her.' Then I was sick of him whacking his sweater up and over the seat at me, trying to get me annoyed, so I yanked them out of his hand and told him to stop while leaning over the seat. Video View 'I ripped them out of the hands of an innocent little boy and then yelled at him over the seat and threw it at his head.' And then, he was flinging seatbelts at me from over the top. I jumped up and tried to look intimidating, (Works rather well sometimes, I'm huge when I want to be), and then I reached down and tickled him because he was in a ball. Three seconds later, he screams in pain and begins crying. He jolted when I tickled him and whacked his head on the window edge, probably did hurt like heck. VIDEO View: 'I got really angry then beat him up and threw him against the window'. So now I’m just waiting for the phone call from the parents asking why I hit their little angel.  ~~ Yes, It Does Suck, as does my life (now I know I have one)

      Current Music: Fryderyk Chopin - Preludes (24) for piano, Op. 28: No. 17 in A flat major, "A Scene on the Place de Notre Dame de Paris" + the sound of my mother complaining about her job in the background (not so musical but I'm drowning her out with Chopin) Current Mood: Nonchalant Digits of Pi Calculated: 3.141592  It’s the muggiest day yet. All the teachers had their windows open totally breaking the new rule of it having to be "100 plus degrees" to open the windows. The administration needs a serious overhaul. Anyway, it was too nice outside when I left school today. It may have been that it was just Friday, but there was a great calm after school. After the first few seconds after I walked off the bus, I couldn't help but admire the beauty of the lawn... Now, normally dandelions aren’t that pretty or inspirational, but I just had to sit. There I lay on the front lawn, only about 15 feet from the road, but it was sooo nice. My backpack was strewn on the other side of me. I kind of lost track of time sitting out there. I was lying under the five year old tree in our lawn, and napped. It may have looked strange but you have no idea how good that feels after staying up all night, doing homework, reading, working, researching. My brain just quit, and it was the best feeling of yay you could ever imagine. I really think I need to do more of this, "not thinking" thing.  People take their front lawns for granted. We keep them nice and trim all year, but no one ever does anything with them. We don’t play on them anymore, they’re just something to look at before you get inside, away from nature, in our houses where we have lights and TVs and Computers to take our mind off of, everything. Now, I encourage everyone who is reading this to try something new; sit, enjoy your front lawn. No matter how small it is, enjoy what’s there. Its nothing drastic I’m suggesting, just sit. Now listen, to your neighbors mowing the lawn, wave to the people on the roads as they drive by. And have nothing to do. Whatever you had planned, watching TV, things to clean, these are all unimportant; just realize that no one is watching TV with you, and whatever you clean gets dirty again so let it be dirty for 15 more minutes. Breathe and enjoy life, everything was created for us, so why do we sit inside and die. And if you feel even more daring, lay on the grass, it’s not wet, there are no creepy crawlies, it’s just green and intimidating. And then, when you’re done with your adventure, you can go back inside and finish whatever you had planned.  ~~Peace

       Current Music: Veggie Tales - The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything - Love WindowsMedia ;P Current Mood: Satisfied with the day Digits of Pi Calculated: 3.14159  Captain’s log, Star Date: 20049.5 My brother was home this weekend, and with him came the entire first season of the original Star Trek... Now personally i could sit through 4 or 5, but not 10 or 15... I pretty much have them memorized.  All i have to say is, wouldn't it suck to be "Ensign BOB"? The caption would say "Ok, for this away mission, I'll need First officer Spock, Doctor McCoy, and Ensign Bob..." Right about this point, you know you’re going to die, so what’s the point. I'm rather surprised that there are so many Senor Officers with the death rate among Ensigns; they never have a chance to be promoted. Now, if there are around 300 people on board the ship, and around 100 of those are Ensigns, There are about 100 episodes and half of them feature an away mission, that’s about 50 Ensign Bobs. So now that’s about a 50% chance of being The Ensign Bob who just got eaten by the mutant giant (bad pun ahead warning!) from planet Ure, in the solar system Scrude. So personally, if your name is Bob, or Jack, or Johnson, I would get out of that red uniform pretty quick like.  *Playing with phaser...* Have you ever noticed that when there is a fire fight on a ship, no one shoots a hole in the window or wall? And who would be stupid enough to put an OVERLOAD button on a phaser. And now, how fast is "Ramming SPEED! Lieutenant Sulu!" And would you put a setting on a ship for it? I wonder how long it was sitting in Committee before they actually decided on a good speed for ramming a ship. I would have loved to be the person who had to test it... Ramming Ships into brick walls... ahh the good old days.  And one last thing, why do the planets look red and green and purple in space, but there normal on the ground... anyway *hops in time machine with a replicator and a few phasers* I'll be heading back to my own time now, and if you want a phaser.. Just call me!  Later... :P

       Current Music: Lord of the Rings - Concerning Hobbits Current Mood: Content Digits of Pi Calculated: 3.1415  Yes, Pie is good. As are many things, but Pie is the best fruit in the world... Hehe. I'm sorry to everyone that I have been a jerk to over the past week. It has just been too much I guess, and I mistook my friends and abused relationships. Thanks for sticking out for me when I was in the Deepest Crap Well you could find, you all rock!  If there was one thing that I learned this weekend it's that HUGS are Gods greatest creation.  I guess this is going to be a short blog entry... Well, later everyone!!! ~~Ps. Jesus Rocks... Just trust me on that. Later

       Current Music: Franz liszt - Hungarian Rhapsody No 1 Current Mood: Tranquility Digits of Pi Calculated: 3.141 I was researching online about the new release of MandrakeLinux 10 official, and I must say, Mandrake is pretty evil. The new release is for paying customers only, and when it does become available to the public its just a dulled down version with missing packages. Linux is registered under the GPL, Gnu Public license, which protects the freedom of technology and programs, letting people obtain the source code and modify it to whatever liking they have, but never to sell it. Mandrake is just being as evil as Red Hat started out being. I'm very proud of our school; they already blocked the new google mail service that is still in the beta version, adhering to their strict rules of absolutely no outside contact with the free world. Trying to keep information from people and prohibiting any type of contact with fellow students. I wouldn't be surprised to see the expression of the human mind prohibited. Mrs. Rowsom, our tech director still hates me; I have no clue as to why still. I have the urge to bring in a laptop next year to use my own stuff in school, but Mrs. Rowsom still won't let me use the network with it. Our school is too full of idiots that they can't trust anyone with anything, which is why they have every computer locked up with Fortress and guarded with Bess. Anyway, I'm just rambling on about nothing, and this homework won't do its self, LaterALL

      Current Music: The hum of my computer Current Mood: Sick of homework Digits of Pi Calculated: 3.14  Today was equally as boring. I went to work with dad and helped build a pool for some rich old woman who doesn't need it. She does have a lot of old junk in this antique barn, most from the 50s and also some old farm equipment. Then I drove home, did farm work, and here I am. Back in my own little sanctuary, where there is no world outside of these four walls, well six if the closet counts. Sitting here on this bed, typing a blog that no one will read, adding to the already growing internet pollution sitting on servers around the globe. This post will probably go to some server in Los Angeles or maybe in Hong Kong, where it will be stored for all eternity, or at least for 400 years until the magnetic disk on the hard drive slowly degrades bit by byte by sector, and it will be gone forever, having no meaning except to fill a void and make the day not so boring after all.

      Current Music: Title- Rain, Artist- Nature Current Mood: Lonely Digits of Pi Calculated: 3.1 In the Beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. Thousands of years later, man created the computer and the internet, and it was good. And within that internet, smart people created Blogs, IMing, and Web Pages, and it was good. And on this day, I create this Blog, and it is good.

      Current Music: Robert Jager - Esprit de Corpus Current Mood: sleepy Digits of Pi Calculated: 3.14592653589  Yes, as stated above, I am tired.  I'll make this short. Things to remember: -Never attempt to (rescue) a wild cat by grabbing it by the neck and trying to wrestle it to the ground to put iodine on its gash. -Cat's teeth are large, they will hurt, and  you   will be needing the iodine and peroxide afterwards. -Wiring a house is easy, finding the live wire is a pain.  I belive I can call this activity "Live Wire Roulette" This comes from my experience of having 2 different outlet boxes with 2 wires in one and 3 in the other.  One wire goes from one box to another, one goes to the light switch above, one is live, and one is a mystery wire... You have to strip each one and wire it to the outlet, with a non-insulated utility knife.  Take your pick, which wire first.  You will know when you find the hot one, electrical burns are nothing. -Shoveling for two hours is not a good thing, neither are the calices and blisters that form from such activity. -When using a drill with a screw tip for wiring outlets, keep fingers away from end of drill.  When the 5 inch bit slips and you're finger is in the way, you're skin has little chance of survival.  So says my hole in my index finger that oddly looks like a Philips head tip. -Thou shall not pop thine blisters. -Chasing barn cats away from your house cats is ok, speeding off of a newly built wooden bridge is not ok.  Half inch splinters are an unfortunate side-effect.  ~To whom ever is still reading this blog.

      Current Music: Good Charlotte - Girls and Boys + the sound of AIM Current Mood: nonchalant with down-ness Digits of Pi Calculated: 3.1459265358  Last day of school. All and all this was a pretty sad year. A lot has happened over the course of one year, and i can tell you one thing, I’m not me anymore. Basic wrap-up of this year in chronological order... that i can remember, I’m a Dory.  -Begging of year, Happy -things got better, became friends with some people, Samm, Tricia, Amanda, Tory, Britney, sally, some others, my brain is boggled and I forget things a lot so don't worry if i forget people. -Middle of year, so-so (Dory: cant complain) -somewhere in the middle of the year friends were betrayed by me, lost a few, went into depression, screwed up life, forced myself to look back at life and wonder what i was doing for years and years to others and understood why some hate me. Became better, was ok with it for a while, months later sank into a deeper depression. Lunch was becoming suffocating with all those people who see me and who I’ve made lives hell for and others that were so close to me and now who have lost interest in each other. Watched the administration become more evil and force the best teachers we had to leave, and who will undoubtedly hire only teachers that they like. -End of the Year, Pain. Guilt. Shame. Anger. Alone. -Had the ending conversation, heard the door of friendship close and slam in my face, lost a part of my life that will never grow back. Will never be used, will never be open, will never be carefree, completely happy, pure. Again.  I will never go through this life again. I changed.

      Current Music: Radio - nothing more Current Mood: Decent, glad that the week is over Digits of Pi Calculated: 3.145926535     Well, the week is over.  Two more days of school left then it’s off for the summer.  Tonight is the relay for life thing and I’ll have to be up all night walking if no one shows up.  My English teacher is going to DJ for the one in Lowville, she rocks!    I guess this is going to be a short blog entry.... later all!  I ate your Web page. Forgive me. It was juicy And tart on my tongue.  Do not meddle in the affairs of dragons,  for you are crunchy and taste good with ketchup.
