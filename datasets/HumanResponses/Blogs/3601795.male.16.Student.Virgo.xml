      Of course, one of the most important questions of life that must be answered is:  What do you do when you're trapped in a well with a goat and a slinky? How you will escape?  First, i would name the goat Barbra. Then, i would whisper sweet nothings in her ear so that..well, she'll get to know me better that way..neways, i'd sqeeze on her nipples...of milk of course cause i gotta drink something...even tho i'm in a well...yeah, well, after that nice venture i'd sing the slinky song!!! "Slinky, Slinky...um...da da da da dum da da!...da da da da da da dum...um...deedle lee dee de deeee!" Yeah! Then, while Barbra is under a sort of hypnosis cause of my great singing, i will attach the AWESOMELY POWERFUL SLINKY to her HUNORMOUSLY BIG HORNS and kinda catapult myself self out leaving Barbra and the Slinky to play with each other until a week passes which will end in the starving/rotting goat and a rusty stinky slinky at the bottom of a drinking well for children. Who cares! That milk was sure good tho...wah?...Goats with HUNORMOUSLY BIG HORNS aren't girls??? .......... "move over...i'm diving in!"

      (imagin an EnGLiSh aCcent, if u will) Of course, the meaning is quite obvious yes yes, i see...*obnoxious laughs*Ahahahaha...Oh, Capital darling... You see, dear, the reason that people love to flock to Blog, yes yes, is that they feel they need some sort of "out-let" so that they can 'tell the world their story'...unlike us who indeed love to guzzle tea and shove crumpets down our throats yes yes, quite.  Yeah, understanding the reason for creating, writing and posting for the world my life or 'stories from it', was at first, unclear. I was skpetical of some of the 'ideas' people discussed at first: "My life sucx big ovaries", "Like, omg!, Who wants to touch my nipples?!?"...well, maybe thats a dream site... neways, because of my negativity towards the trustworthiness of man, (especially wo men ), i didnt feel like my works could really make a difference to enough people, that i would be kinda reguarded as some other whinny guy, overwhelmed by excess insecurities or boredom, wishing that some girl would read this and become in love with my apathy for life...(which is not unlike what i used to believe people who posted were) So, i when to my local Psych, and he helped me figure out that by maybe being a mit more positive towards others, and understanding others views instead of just my own, i could become more intouch with what i truly wanted, and not get stagefright ne more....or pee-pee my bed...and also that altho, i may not make a difference in thousands or even hundreds of peoples lives, maybe even just one, atleast i helped that people better understand wsup from the eAsTsIdE oF dA viLLe cAlLeD NASH...T-Rey's version...
