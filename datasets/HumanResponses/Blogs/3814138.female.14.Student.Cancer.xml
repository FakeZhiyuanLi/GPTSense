      My name is Amanda. I don't want to seem like the overly depressed Goth that wanders around with no friends, in a world of all her own while comtemplating the meaninglessness of life. Well, I have some friends. Other than that...it's somewhat true. I'm sure some lives have meaning...just not mine. I seem to be painfully mediocre at everything I attempt and I'm pretty sure that will continue for a long time if not the rest of my life. I've never been popular, even when I dressed like a 'normal' human being and acted like a bubbly blonde (back then I was blonde) and I wanted so bad to be accepted. It never happined. I always felt like I was the third wheel in the group...or fourth wheel as the case may be. No one actuly included me. One of the people that I really, um, I guess respected would be the correct term, made fun of me constantly and I always ended up going home at the end of the day, depressed out of my mind while everyone else was in love with the art based school we all attended and never wanted to leave. The thing was, I was in love with it too. I loved everyone in it because they were hilarious and sick-minded and artistic even though there never really was a place for me in there. I stated writing this really explicit poetry about suicide and murder. I found a way of reliveing myself of all the anger that was building in me because of the ASSHOLES at my school. I want you to know right now that it was not bad enough for me to actully commite suicide, no where close, and no, I do not think the world is against me, but poetry helped me get all the anger out so I didn't have to spend an entire French class in the bathroom, crying to people my problems that only pretended to care just to be polite. After a while the poetry got less disgusting as I found other ways of getting away from it all. Ozzy Osbourne, though he's probably style of music you would have expected to, you know, release me from all the negative energy. But it was such a difference from the bubblegum pop about everyone being happy and boyfriends being perfect. After hearing Ozzy Osbourne, I realised something that definatly changed my life...POP IS AWFUL!! I started listening to AC/DC and some watered down punk groups. They may suck to me now, but after Nelly's 'Hot in Here', Simple Plan sounded pretty damn good! Well, one day, when I was looking for pictures of Ozzy Osbourne on the internet for my now discontinued website (this was now summer vacation) I found a picture of Ozzy Osbourne standing with Marilyn Manson. Under the picture was a sentance saying how shock-rocker Marilyn Manson was a family friend of the Osbourne's. He looked really cool so I desided to download some music. Marilyn Manson kicks ass! I had completely abandoned all prep music and the soft punk and went on to AFI and the Sex Pistols in replacement of New Found Glory and Simple Plan. I desided that there was no chance of me really having any good friends as I was going back to the same school again so I ditched the uncomfortable prep clothes too. No more tight jeans for Manda! My shirts...not that tight either. And I started wearing those studded leather bracelettes. I got back to school in September and not only did I not have any friends, people were calling me a poseur! Well, I shouldn't say I didn't have ANY friends, just no real good ones. The one person that still talked to me, well, she called me a poseur too and that really pissed me off because she was suposed to be me friend. Halfway though the school year she ditched me for a girl that had just come to the art based school the begining of that year. She had probably ditched me before that, but the newer girl and I started hanging out as well and I didn't really notice because she was still there all the time. I had other friends for a month or two at a time but I was always nervous that they were not actully my friends and were just paying attention to me to be polite. I'm very self-contios and extremly shy and I have a hard time trusting people. But, that's all behind me now. No one called me a poseur by the end of the year. I had gone punk and then, slowly I started to dress more Gothic. I started listening to Gothic music as well as Marilyn Manson, Sex Pistols, Ozzy and AFI, like the Bauhaus, Skinny Puppy, Dead Can Dance and Clan of Xymox. I never really had the right attitude to be a punk. Oh, and don't take the titals to seriously...there lines from one of my poems.
