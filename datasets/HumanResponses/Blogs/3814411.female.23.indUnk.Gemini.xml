      9:30 AM Today’s the big day.  I’ll be seeing my doctor at 2pm later about my gallstones, and he (or she – I don’t know the person) will tell me what procedure needs to be done.  I’m excited, but nervous at the same time.  I just hope that I can put off my surgery past VBS – I have a promise to keep that is more important than my body, that is, serving the LORD by reaching the next generation.  Suddenly that opportunity has become much more precious to me.    I was really looking forward to seeing my job coach this week, for in my eyes, he holds the key for my escaping my current job (even though deep down, I know it’s really up to the LORD), but I spaced out and deleted his meeting time in my Palm Pilot for some reason.  Then I scheduled something else, that is, a trip to the public market with my friends Christine and Curtis.  I really wanted to show him my job leads, all three of them.  One of them looks particularly promising, that of a stage painter at GEVA theater.  My neighbor knows the head of the arts department, which could be a foot in the door for me.  It’s not what you know, but who you know, right?  I’m an okay painter.  This would be an opportunity not only to get better, but also to escape from Jeff.  I know he’d never actually do anything (besides, as I must keep reminding myself, my evidence is merely circumstantial).  He’s smarter than that.  It’s just my awkward feelings. I want out.  Fast.  August can’t come soon enough!  3:00 PM The public market was okay.  They didn’t have much of a selection, but the prices were right.  A vendor even gave me some free bok choy, since I seemed like I would take some home if I knew what it tasted like.  I haven’t had any yet, but I’ll get to stir-fry it eventually.  I really enjoyed the selection over at Abundance, a natural foods store in the city.  Ever since I became a vegetarian a few weeks ago, I have been actively experimenting with different kinds of foods and recipes.  I was excited that I was able to make a good tahini yogurt sauce.  Soy (I used soy yogurt) is even good for that!  Soy rules!    My only bones to pick with my new diet are the flatulence and the expense.  I complained that I couldn’t eat my black bean vegetarian enchiladas at work because they get me into trouble – in other words, I putt-putted throughout the whole day!  The farting, Christine assured me, will pass.  The expense, however, comes with the territory.  I don’t know why they make junk food so cheap and health food so expensive.  No wonder Americans are so obese!    It was fun spending time with my friends, too.  Curtis and Christine helped me select veggies at the public market that would stir-fry well and make good salads.  A breast feeder at Abundance flashed poor Curtis when he was looking for a bagel.  He was quite upset, but Christine managed to calm him down somewhat.  It was a shame that it was cut short due to my appointment with Carol, my support specialist, at 12:00.   Well, the appointment came and went.  I’m going to see a specialist, who in turn, will either recommend me for the surgery or do the surgery him or herself.  I was a little disappointed that the doctor didn’t send me off with my hospital papers today, but that’s life for you.  Sometimes you have to wait.  My appointment with said specialist is at 9am on the 21st, the week after Vacation Bible School...also after any commitments I have to Champion this coming week, so if I have the surgery after that, I should be all free and clear.  Even if they schedule me, I can cite a medical absence.  I’ll warn them that I’ll probably have an upcoming surgery, though, so they know that something’s coming.  I must be the consummate professional.  Anything else seems to get me into trouble, not only at my job, but also with my job coach.  Urgh.    I'd rather just be  myself.   I mean, I am, to an extent, just a very polite version.  When I'm out of work, I can let my hair down, so to speak.  I can, for example, tell people what I really think of them and their actions if I choose to do so, saying what I think they  need  to hear, not what they  want  to hear in order to make a sale go smoother.  I'm not deceitful.  There's just a different way of putting things.  Outside of work, less tact can be used, more blunt honesty, is all.  I can be completely honest with my co-workers, but when it comes to customers, I have to put on the kid gloves.  I hate that.  For example, we have bathrooms, but we're not allowed to tell customers that.  Our official story is that we don't have them.  I'd prefer to say "They're not available for customer use."  I said that once.  It didn't go over well.  Also, my store isn't hiring, but our official baloney euphenism is "We're handing out applications."  I'd rather say "We're not hiring right now, but feel free to try again in September.  That's when the college kids (although I would feel strange calling someone my age "kid") go back home."  That's more honest.  But I can't say that.  I'd get fired.  It really upsets me that I can't be totally on the level with people.  Maybe that's why I hate my uniform.  I don't like who I am at work.  I feel like I'm a boring, stodgy old woman stuck in a twentysomething's body.  I work my tail off, but I'm all about work.  To an extent, I do envy the co-workers who stand there and stare out the window all day or generally goof off with each other or their friends.  My sense of duty has always been stronger than that.    My jokes always seem to fall flat, and I don't feel like I communicate well enough with my coworkers somehow.  The other day, when one of them (an Asian guy named Andy) brought back a tachit gun, he said "I'm sorry, the other one doesn't work."  He was hoping to get two so that attaching the tags to the college tees would go faster.  I said "If that one is the one that works, I'd hate to see the other one!  What, does it shoot out flames or something?"  Andy looked at me like I was from outer space or something and said, "No, the needle's broken."  "Oh."  I get the distinct impression that Andy doesn't like me.  When I relayed the conversation to Anita, who is a friend who used to go to church with me and also used to work retail, she thought it was hilarious.  Some people just click, and some people don't.  I can take some comfort in that I never see Andy outside of work.  I have nothing against him.  It takes an awful lot for me not to like a person.  They have to actually do something pretty serious to me, not merely dislike me.  Bad working chemistry is no excuse.  I think of myself as being like a Far Side cartoon - either you get me or you don't.  And that's okay.

      For the first time since I can remember, I'm not confused anymore.  I had been confused about this dumb arsed situation about Jeff, this guy I'm attracted to at work.  It all began when I began to notice that lately, when he has to count my cash drawer when I leave during the day that he has the tendency to clutz out, get really stiff and make feeble attempts at conversation.  I questioned my mom about it, and she said, "Diana, that's not unlike how you would act around a cute guy."    "Impossible!" I remember thinking.  This is a guy who was on my case about absolutely everything, never smiled, and seems to eat, breathe and sleep the life of retail clothing.  I used to wonder if he was some kind of robot.    Then I caught wind of a suspicious conversation.  It turns out he is in love with someone, and just realized it a few days ago.  His co-worker that he was talking to thinks it's crazy.  Who could this mystery girl be?  I thought it was me (since the clutz-outs began at the same time frame he specified), but as I type this, I'm really doubting it.    For one thing, these feeble attempts at conversation are always work related.  One example is "Was it busy yesterday?"  Pfft.  Today's two-second conversation (which was preceded by an extremely awkward four minutes of silence) was about some idiot customer who thought I had counted her change wrong.  She thought she had handed me three twenties, but had in fact handed me two twenties and a five.  I said something like "I hope she went to Starbucks (which is right next door) to cool off or something." He laughed a bit, and told me that telling the customers what they are handing me each time can avoid such confusion in the future.    It  would  be crazy if Jeff did feel anything for me.  Neither of us can pursue it, even if there was a chance on Earth that a mutual desire was present.  He has a higher position than me, that of (temporary, until he returns to college) key carrier.  I'm not entirely sure what the policy is on interoffice dating in general, but I'd be willing to bet that semi-management and customer assistants are not allowed to fraternize.  If he asked me out and was discovered, he would lose his job.  I probably would too.  Even if interoffice dating was allowed, I have other reasons for not dating Jeff.  I seriously doubt that he's a Christian.  Based on what the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 6:14-18 and on my own personal experience in the past, I'll not subject myself to the experience of dating an unbeliever again.  I'd be courting disaster.  It doesn't matter what I feel.  Feelings can and do deceive.  It's probably just a stupid crush anyways, and besides - Jeff goes back to college in August.  Just a few more weeks.  Besides, if I get that gall bladder surgery, I'll be long gone before then, gone before he can even miss me or understand what's really going on.  The surgery would conveniently excise me from the premises for three to four weeks.    If I knew how he felt for sure, it would hurt even more to set my feelings aside like this, but maybe this is God's way of trying to spare me, by me not knowing.  It's still torturous, but I know exactly what to do.  Nothing.  If I merely step aside, this arrow will fly right by me.  I swore to myself, ever since I crashed and burned with my last ex (who I thought was a Christian but in reality was anything but) that if the opportunity came to date an unbeliever again - one who I  knew  was unsaved, that I'd pass it by.  If it comes to that, I'll make good on that promise.  What else can I do?  I love God first, me second.  I know I wander, but I'm fiercely loyal when it counts.    I know He has my best in store for me, and if that comes in the form of marriage, then fine.  I have a feeling that God can do better for me than Jeff - better than I can do for myself, that is.  He's all wrong for me.  I need to be the only caustic, workaholic one in the relationship, dangit!  Two of that kind...it just seems disastrous, especially if one does not know the Lord.  But before I even think about getting ready for marriage (for dating is to precede marriage), I have the feeling that I have some things I need to take care of now.  I have to conquer the world, my world.  What that means, I don't know yet.

      I'm kinda sleepy today, actually.  Some silly person woke me up at 8:45 AM today.  I wanted a sleep in day, and I couldn't have it.  I feel like a teenaged brat who got the covers yanked off of her.   I checked my voicemail to see who it was, and it was my job coach.  I grumbled, rolled over and tried to get back to sleep.  Unless it was my mom calling with news about my sick grandparents, (I had panicked and thought that my grandma had died), I was NOT answering the phone before 10 AM.  No way, no how.    My poor grandma.  Darned job coach.  There was no way I could fall asleep after that.  I found out why I've been having abdominal pains lately.  Gallstones.  I'll be seeing my doctor about it next week.  After months of suffering (although I could have gotten an ultrasound much sooner.  I'm to be blamed for that), I have the answer.  Hopefully, the solution is easy to fix.  My mom says that the surgery is fairly simple and I'd be off my feet for two weeks.  Thankfully, I've saved up some money for such an occasion...dunno if my workplace does workman's comp for that or not.  I don't think that applies here, though.  Well, it's time to be off to work now.  More will be posted as it applies.  Later!  ~*~Diana
