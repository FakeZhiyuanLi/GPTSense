						   http://www.copanhonduras.org/ruins.htm http://www.duane.zehr.com/copanruinas1/ http://www.honduras.net/copan/ruins/ http://travel.yahoo.com/p-travelguide-485319-copan_ruinas_vacations  A Maya capital from the 400s to the 800s AD, Copan is one of the largest and most impressive of all the Maya centers discovered so far. It consists of pyramids, temples and 21 stone pillars, or stelae, with exquisite carved likenesses of ancient Copan kings. While Tikal in Guatemala is the largest known Maya site and is easier to get to, Copan shouldn't be missed by anyone interested in the Mayan civilization. The ruins are accessible by road from both Honduras and Guatemala.  The Maya built Copan in one of the most beautiful areas of Honduras, on the banks of the Copan River in a fertile valley with a near-perfect climate, although the summer is extremely hot. There is evidence that the city's demise was brought on by overpopulation and deforestation: Overuse of the land rendered it unable to support the large population.   The Copan Archaeological Park covers 74,130 acres/30,025 hectares at an elevation of 2,100 ft/640 m. Only a fraction of the ruins have been excavated, but as jungle growth is cleared away from each new section and more mounds are tunneled into, even more wondrous things appear. One of the most spectacular was the discovery of the Rosalila Temple (named for its rosy red color), found almost intact under a later temple. An exact replica, painted in the same red, yellow, green and white colors as the original, is in the new Maya Sculpture Museum, located near the main entrance to the park. (The original temple can't be visited and is considered too sacred and fragile to be moved.) In addition to the Rosalila replica, the Sculpture Museum now houses some of the original stelae from the park that were being destroyed by ground moisture and fluctuations in temperature. Though you may be tempted to bypass the museum for more time at the ruins, don't do it: We found the museum one of the most rewarding parts of Copan.   Copan's Hieroglyphic Staircase contains the longest hieroglyphic text in the world. Although its 63 steps are covered with a canvas roof, the 1,200 glyphs are still in danger from the combination of moisture and the salt in the stones. Eventually they must be removed and treated in order to preserve them. The steps once led up to a small, thatched-roof temple, though the temple is now gone.   Other highlights include the beautifully preserved and restored ball court (its acropolis was eroded by the adjacent Copan River, revealing a cliff face 121 ft/37 m high in which a number of earlier levels of building can be distinguished) and Altar Q, a box-shaped altar in the west plaza, which has sculptures of all of Copan's rulers sitting on glyphs representing their names. The excavation of Copan, which started in the 1930s, continues. Archaeologists have identified the remains of Copan's founder, K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo', or Sun-Eyed Green Quetzal Macaw, deep in the center of the massive Acropolis. Another site, El Sitio de las Sepulturas, is a rare example of fully restored residential dwellings of nobility and priests. Further excavation is expected to reveal a great deal about the daily life of nobles and others who lived with them.   Although the ruins take only a few hours to see, the nearby town of Copan Ruinas is a tranquil place to relax for a few days. With cobbled streets, mom-and-pop eateries and tiny but clean hotels and hostels, it is a safe and accommodating area to learn about small-town rural Honduran life. Don't miss the Regional Museum in town, where objects found in a tomb discovered in 1989 -- three scepter pinnacles, two large jades and a shell containing congealed human blood -- are on display. There are also several smaller archaeological sites in the area, as well as hot springs and waterfalls. Activities include hiking, river tubing and horseback riding.

						   "Copan is unique among Classic Maya centers because of its extremely long history of field research, which essentially incorporates the whole tradition of American Archaeology. Also unusual is that this research has involved independent projects from many institutions, sometimes working simultaneously, each with its own goals, theoretical frameworks, and methods." --Copan, The Rise and Fall of an Ancient Maya Kingdom, Webster, Freter and Gonlin.  In 1530 a local chief called Copan Calel led an uprising against the Spanish; after his defeat his name became attached to the ruins.  The original Classic Maya Name (as recently deciphered)is Xukpi.  John Stevens (who mapped the area) and Frederick Catherwood (who rendered beautiful drawings) visited the site in 1839. Catherwood's lithographs are now famous.  Alfred Maudslay, supported by  Harvard's Peabody Museum  worked during field seasons from 1881 to 1895.   Carnegie  Archaeologists worked at Copan from 1935-1946 with a two year haitus during WWII.   Gordon Willey of  Harvard University  initiated the most recent epoch of Copan research in 1977 (to 1979)focusing intensive archaeological investigations on sites outside the Main Group. Harvard Archaeologists surveyed and remapped the Las Sepulturas urban enclave, improving on Burgh's original survey.  A long term, ongoing study of Copan's architecture was begun in 1970 by two  Austrian doctoral students in architecture , Hasso Hohmann and Annegrete Vogrin.   In 1977 the Honduran government, through its agencies of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and the Honduran Institute of Anthropology and History began a large-scale Archaeological project at Copan.   The Authors of Copan, the Rise and Fall of an Ancient Maya Kingdom Acknowledge many people with regard to essential field and laboratory research carried out during their PAC II and related projects. Among them are Glenn Storey, Rebecca Storey (UH), Randolph Widmer(UH).

						   The burial population that we will be working on is a collection of bones from people who lived near the Mayan Pyramid in the Pre-classic period of Mayan Culture. (1400 BC to 300 AD) Copan Ruinas, Honduras is the Easternmost outpost of Mayan culture. It was an important religious center during Preclassic (1400 BC) thru Post Classic (1000 AD)phases. The current research is to determine the reasons for decline of the civilization and to determine as much as we can about the people who lived there.  The schools that are doing ongoing research at the site are Harvard University, Penn State and the University of Houston.  I am currently working onsite with my professor, Dr. Rebecca Storey, Gina (Graduate student, UH) and Molly (Graduate Student, Harvard)

						   Well, everyone, all is well in Honduras. I managed to safely navagate the streets of San Pedro Sula, catch a bus to a small town in the mountains near the border of Guademala, and find my professor and fellow students with no address, no internet access, and NO ENGLISH! Ha!  Empowering time of life, I tell you! I am frankly surprised at how well I have done with the Spanish language .... although I very often get snickers...especially from the kids.... but the Hondurans are a warm and generous people who will do anything to help.... I will be attending mass tomorrow night, after finally getting to see the pyramid from which those artifacts and persons I have been working on were excavated. Very excited about that.  After living, working, eating, playing, sharing a single bathroom ...with 2 grad students and one professor... we are all already sick of each other.  And 3 more weeks to go. lol  We have a daily heavy downpour. I lost my umbrella when we went out drinking. HONDURAS HAS THE BIGGEST F...ING ANTS I HAVE EVER SEEN! AT LEAST AS BIG AS A VW BEETLE!  MOSQUITOS ARE LITTLE GUYS BUT CARRY MALARIA...SO LOTS OF BUG SPRAY DAILY. WE CALL IT PERFUME NOW.  FOUND A NEW DRINK...MANGO DAQUARI...YOU GOTTA TRY IT...WILL HAVE TO TRY TO DUPLICATE WHEN HOME. OH MY GOD WELL...IT IS POURING WORSE. MY STREET WILL BE A VAST DOWNHILL RIVER BEFORE I GET HOME. LOVE KISSES AND MISSING YOU ALL. GOD DO I MISS AIR CONDITIONING IN THE AFTERNOONS. NIGHT IS NOT BAD. BYE ---NEXT POST AS SOON AS POSSIBLE EV

						   Well friends, Day ONE:  As always in my life, unexpected weather delays and other miscellaneous adventures are making me late in arrival to my site. I safely saw my travelling companions off on our flight (it was overbooked -- I did not make the flight)..... so, I had to choose between travel to another Honduran city, travel to Guademala or several day's delay. I choose to travel to another Honduran city which will only cause a mild layover and a slightly longer bus ride to my final destination. All in all I will be about one day late rather than several. I have not heard good things about the bus ride from Guademala and the several bus transfers required to get to my little town in Honduras....and my spanish is barely adequate....so I opted to travel to the Capitol of the country and travel on a single bus ride. Will report more as time permits. I will say....I have married twice and was late to both weddings. I had hoped that I had outrun the luck of the Irish, but alas.... she follows...LOL Hasta! Evelyn

						   Hi Evelyn...sounds like your trip there is similar to my trip to Vera Cruz.  Although we stayed in a "nice" area and were safe, the people we passed through the many towns left an impression of sedated life.  The children were usually happy, but they know not what lies in store for them as adults.  It's something to make you stop and think...do we really NEED to make donations to churches and fundraisers for all those people who live oh-so-far away?  YES.  And we need to pray for them.  And we need to do what we can when the opportunity arises.  It doesn't mean sit on your butt until someone comes and asks for your help...it's going out there and being proactive...helping others.  Of course, there are literally thousands of homeless, abused, sick, and neglected children, adults, and animals here too...so where to start?  Ask God.  Let Him lead you where He wants you...you will know.  I miss you terribly and hope that God blesses your time there.  Oh, and we will HAVE to go try that Mango daquiri, ok?  I'm waiting on you, chickie!  :)  Jill "Madd Bess, B.I." Buie

						   The things we take for granted in the United States are many. Being able to afford food. Medical care, even shoddy medical care for an expensive price.... Clean water to drink. Cars and gasoline. Air Conditioning. Jobs ---even for $5 per hour. Laundromats. Here, I see people washing their clothes in a polluted stream, scrubbing them on rocks. Dogfood is not sold and all the dogs are skinny and sick. Horses are fed on the side of the road because one family owns ALL the land. Horses are the transportation for anyone who can{t walk that far or can not afford a broken down American Schoolbus that doubles in its new life as a bus service for long distances. Cats do not live past age 2 because of disease. they were imported. Daily thunderstorms knock out the powergrid for the town almost every other day.... which also means no water. The water here is not safe to drink. It will give you Dysentery, Cholera and a host of ugly parasites. There is no trash pick up. Telephones are rare. The only jobs are tourista shops and the farms belonging to a single family. If you are born here...your life expectancy is about 60 years...if you make it past age 15. Thank God tonight. And instead of sending missionaries to save the souls of these people....send the corps of engineers. Love, Evelyn

						   Well, today I was able to spend my time off viewing some of the local area and shopping (groceries = we are having what we can only call "food fantasies")At first I could not find MILK. I finally found some soy milk (I prefer it anyway) but later found milk packaged in plastic bags...so it can be frozen to prevent spoilage.... In the town in which I am living for this short time, there are two distinct classes of people those that have much and those who have nothing. The third class of people are the Mayan people descenant of those who built the pyaramids and whose Ancestors I sit and glue together bit by bit, scrap by scrap... the Maya eat from the trash of those who have so little. They have less than nothing. They are ignored, unclean, discarded and ignored. I have met some American students who have come with much needed antibiotics and medical supplies donated from a hospital in New Hampshire. Good mission. There are 17 church groups here, many churches, they sing and pray but do not bring clothing, medical supplies, money or supplies. the churches here include Catholic, Seventh Day Adventist, United Pentecostal, Mormon, Baptist (not in this town but near by)and a host of others. They do not build or repair houses (made of mudbrick and plaster). They do not donate time nor money to repair the broken water lines nor the outdated electrical grid. The electrical grid was built in part to support American Troops during the Iran/Contra affair.  There are no native people here who wear glasses. There is not an eyedoctor within 150 miles. No optical shops , no readers for the old folks. No wheelchairs for the handicapped. Infact, there are few handicapped. They have all died young with no medical care.  the children here wear much worn and torn clothing that is traded and was donated from America following the last big hurricane disaster. The Honduran Red Cross has little to assist with and their only 2 vehicles are on blocks in the front of their complex.  Abuse of women is about twice that as in the united states. I have seen it for myself, and had to fight with myself to keep from interveining. It was finally my own experience ...and knowledge that after the interveiner left the woman would be further punished that kept my eyes diverted and mouth shut.  Tourists pour into this town for their two day stays...drop what seems like a million dollars in a few shops and leave...content and oblivious to what I see. I live in a house in the city...I walk to work with the masses...I shop at the local shops, not the tourist dives.   The disparity of wealth is sickening. The injustice of humanity is worse.  The little children beg near our house for the rotten mangos that have fallen from our tree.  One of the graces I have been given in this life is the opportunity to have been raised with Appalacian grandparents who had nothing. That has allowed me to recognize that having nothing...does not mean you cannot live a happy and fruitful life. I know that as long as the children have some food in their mouths that 57% of all that are born will live to be 15. That is only 43% who will not survive. That is pretty good odds in a harsh environment. And their are also the rich here, of Spanish Conquest Descent who will live happily.

						   Well, made it home safe and sound. True that air conditioning is hard on me now. the Lettuce at lunch made me sick at my tummy not used to a meal that does not include heavy meat proteins and frijoles negros (refried black beans) Other things memorable from the trip.... The guys at the center took to telling me that I was stronger than good whiskey.... I take that as a compliment.... I had a beautiful little male admirer of about 25 yrs of age.... CUTIE!!! I fell in love with the Honduran people. They are warm, loving and friendly.  I loved what I saw of Guatemala, as well... There is definitely a for-fun trip in my future....Love that part of the world. Met some of the most interesting European and American back-pack vacationers. The ones that came in on tour busses are annoying....VERY Annoying  I want to explore my options as a geologist. Geology is my minor...I was never able to say which one I preferred.... Geology or Archaeology. Love them both.  I took 9 and a half rolls of film, but most of you will not care for all the pictures of bones and teeth that I took... So I will spare you and just pick out the Temple and town shots  Good to be home.  Every woman should travel to a foreign country alone at least once. There is nothing more empowering than landing on foreign soil, navagating to a different state....finding a specific town...finding your lost companions without an address.....and all with very little linguistic experience or aptitude.  I will bathe in hot water every chance I get. I will hold my grandkids close I will kiss my children, no matter how old or how much they protest. It will take a long time to quit testing the lights and water to make sure they are still on each day. Goodnight. Evie

						   She made it home safe and sound. She only had to travel to another country (Guatemala) to do it.I guess it will take a while for her to get acclimated. I took her to lunch (on the way home from the airport) and she kept speaking Spanish to the waiter and was excited about getting lettuce from the salad bar! Also, she had trouble sleeping last night at the Holiday Inn (she was cold with the airconditioning). I guess she will be sleeping in the tent in the backyard for a few days :)   Personally, I am glad she is home....she forgot to show me how to use the DVD player while she was gone.  Dawn

						   1. A Harvard degree is still just a piece of paper. It does not give you a lick of common sense nor common courtesy. It certainly does not entitle you to instant respect.  2. A PhD does not make you courteous nor well mannered.  3. Poverty does not make you unhappy. But wealth makes you dissatisfied.  4. She who sits quietly by will be just as quickly insulted as those who are not quiet....but the quiet ones often get to hear it right in front of themselves.  5. Politics suck.  6. Ashes to Ashes and Dust to Dust....We are that which is in our hearts, minds and souls....we are not that which lies within this multihued sack we call skin. And skin color....is the most ridiculous notion. It does not exist in death.   7. A rich man's bones will crumble just as quickly as a poor mans.
