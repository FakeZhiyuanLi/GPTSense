       So i slept in this morning and that was great, i really cant remember the last time i slept till 10AM.Tish and i finished watching the movies we rented and then we got ready to run some errands and pick up Noah at 3.   Tish and i are going back and forth being really lovey to blah wit h each other and it is making me crazy. Not to mention the fact that yet agian she is hidding something and wont tell me about it. Why is my relationship so unsteady? I seriously go from be mad about her to mad at her in a matter of seconds. I dont know whats going on. I dont know how much more i can or even want to take at this point. If she is hiding stupid stuff from me than i can only imagine what else she is not telling me about. I just dont know i am so confused. I wish i had some friends here or my family.I am pretty sure if things with Tish dont work out that i will move back down to SO CAL.I hate to think like that but it is true.    I have nothing exciting to report about today. Maybe tomorrow... i have Noah all day i am hoping he is in a good mood so that we can go out and do something fun together. I really need to work on my report that is due on Tues. I think that maybe i have been putting it off more because i dont really like the class. I dont think i really want to be a medical asistant. I just wanna be a rock star.Why couldnt i have just been a rock star???? Is that really to much to ask?   I guess so.    Well i am off to confront Tish(i might be back later to blog about the fight)Why does love have to be so much work? I know that it takes some work but damn this is ALOT.   N

       So today was suposed to be my "ME" day. I had it all planned out i was going to lounge,play with my sims,read,work on my website and just do whatever i wanted. It didnt turn out that way at all. This morning i was using the computer while Tish was getting ready for work and i opened up the notepad on MY desktop and found saw something called Darling. Of course i was like "whats this?"I opened it and to my total disgust it was a love email from my woman to her ex. It was an old letter but still i didnt need to see that shit. Just 2 days ago i came across saved IM's of theirs. I was furious,sad,and hurt. I called her in and she was just like "oh" like it was no big deal and when she said sorry it was so fake i couldnt even accept it. Now everyone has a past. Myself included i was in love once before but i really feel like her past is always being thrown in my face and it makes me feel so awful.I really feel like i cant express my emotions without her getting mad at me. She had the nerve to ask me why i opened it...... I was like WELLLLL. So anyway that led to a uncomfortable day and me telling her that i wasnt using her computer anymore. I am so tired of seeing shit like that.(another time i came acros naked pics of a different ex) So i went to best buy today and i got my own computer(yea) I was going to wait a few more weeks till i could get the notebook i wanted but i just couldnt imagine using that pc agian. I got a really great deal on a desktop that came with everything. This is my first very own computer!   We talked a little and we both said the same ole things we always say and then things were a little better. We dont have Noah this weekend so it has been a nice break for us and we are both looking forward to sleeping in tomorrow morning.   I love her so much and at times i just dont know if i can be the right gyrl for her.I dont think i have it in me. I am so afraid that i will just keeping taking until i cant take anymore and ill snap. I really dont want that to happen.She really is an amazing woman and we dont really have a lot of problems it is just that the few we do have are BIG. Well i am going to go to bed now. I predict a good night sleep tonight. Wishing for a better day tomorrow.

       So last night was another night that we couldnt get Noah to bed. It took us 2 hours to get him to bed..... and that was our BED. I layed down next to him (it is now after 10) i am ready to go to bed myself except i am to wound up. The second time we put him to bed was a little after 8 and he didnt want to be in there and he let us know by throwing up in 4 different spots. So we had to clean that and give him a bath. After that we tried snuggling reading anything we could think of.   Well when he finally went to sleep in our bed i got up and went to his room and moved some things around and cleaned(in hopes that something was just bothering him there and i could fix it)When i was done an hour later i came and got him and put him in his bed. Climbed in my bed and got all snuggly next to my girl.3 hours later i here comes Noah he came right around to my side and got in went to sleep..... Like a sucker fish he was stuck to me anytime i moved he moved closer.Well about 2 hours later Tish was getting up for work and she took him back to bed. There i was in my cozy bed alone,and sleeping like a brick. So needless to say we didnt get any adult time last night or this morning either:-( We both really enjoy our time together first thing in the A.M and last thing in the P.m )Good news is Tish is going to be home from work in less than 2 hours and we are going to sleep and talk in each others arms. And we do have a lot to talk about. I sent her and email last night and thats always nerve racking for me. I never know how she is going to react. She really makes me feel bad for having feelings and even more so for letting her know about those feelings. But there comes a time when they have to be let out.I dont want all this awful stuff building up and then something insignificant is blown out of preportion.   Other than the sleep problems that Noah is having he is still the light in my eyes. Seems everyday he is bigger and smarter and does something to amaze me. I sometimes feel like i can just look at him for hours and hours. He also is getting more and more use to me. He calls me Mimi but latley and more and more he calls me mommy or mimommy or something. It really is cute. Or he will come up to me and say momma more or whatever and i am like hey your momma is over there --->But he is talking to me. Tish said that it is fine that he can call me whatever he wants.I think that the only one who is going to have a problem with it is Ex. Since she wants to be the one and only mommy. I think she would like it if even Tish wasnt momma. But whatever the simple fact is i love him like he is my own son. I raise him like he is mine and so it is no wonder that he is going to think of me as a mommy. What a lucky little guy to have 3 moms.. I guess we are all lucky that he isnt a girl...... a teenage girl with 3 moms. I couldnt stand my 1 mom when i was a teenager. I want to have a baby and i want it to be a girl.... hmmm    her name is already picked out...Olivia Marie Reed Perez. Never in my life did i think i would want a plain name like that...I have always thought my kids would be name Venus,Skye,Scarlette,Maddison or something... But the more i thought about Olivia Marie the more i really liked it.Not to mention that Olivia is Tish's middle name and Marie is mine.   Anyway enough blabbing. I have to get a few things before the hunny gets home....   ciao ciao

       I am in an awful mood so far today and it is only 10:00 am. I didnt get a good night sleep. Noah woke up at 12:30a in the morning screaming and crying and had to come to bed with us. I had just gone to bed when he woke up so i didnt get any sleep. Then when he woke up this morning he was still crabby i think he is getting another tooth or something. I also feel like i am getting a cold but thats no surprise all the kids at daycare are sick so.......   I also came across somethings that i didnt really need to see and that has me in a supper foul mood.I feel so confused and like i just really wanna scream.I should be studying for my test on EKG's on thursday but you know what? Right this minute i just dont give a shit.   On the flip side things with Tish are still going really well and we havent had any serious problems in the last 2 weeks. We have finally realized some of the things that make each other tick and are working on them. Doesnt help that we are both PMSing at the same time but we are working on it. We are just starting our 9th month as a couple and our 8th month of living together. "It's not always rainbows and butterflies it compromise that moves us along"Hmm Where have i heard that before? We had actually gotten to the point where we were going to give up. Then almost as quick as we had decieded that we fell right back in love. It was a pretty amazing thing. We both werent sure we had it in us to make it work but somehow or love is finding a way. So i think ill go read my book and take a nap while the house is quiet.

Things i would like to do today are-- watch the movies i rented on sun,wash and vacume my car,watch all my shows that are on my tivo,play the SIMS,get a pedicure,give myself a facial and finish my book.HMMMMM i guess we will just have to see what i get done today. I always say i just wanna veg out and do NOTHING,but i cant sit still  it drives Tish nuts . I always have to be moving around i can always find something to do. Opps see just sitting here i thought of something else i need to do. Tish and I want to move so bad so i need to look online for something for us. It is crazy we cant seem to find what we are looking for at all.I am so ready to get out of here. When we move watch out i am going to be a decorating fool. I love to do that kind of stuff so much. Getting so excited just thinking about it. Well the laundry calls.     Blog ya later!
