      Ok, i was giving my sis a lift to the gym when she asked me this question,"Why do people like to smell and continue smelling weird odours?" I didn't know the answer to that, but i will agree with that people DO like to sniff at weird odours AND continue to smell them. I remember when I was a kid, I liked to take a deep breath of exhaust fumes coming from a bus pulling away from the busstop......... Maybe that explains all the ideas i get..........hmmm............i should take in more of those fumes..............

      ok so i came up with this theory some days back while on the way to the post office...........so here goes......  the sars virus is actually a genetically engineered strain of the corona virus created by either the iraqis or osama..........and was released at the same time as the iraq war..... this probably the unconventional warfare that iraq had claimed...............but how does it spread? simple, mosquitoes~!  i mean what better way to spread a virus and make sure it continues spreading endlessly and undetected than by using mosquitoes~!  alrite......back to studying..............

      si liao lah............i can't concentrate~!!!! exams in 1 week's time and i cant concentrate~!!!! im stuck~!!!!! if the open loop gain is used to calculate the output voltage even when there is a feedback loop, then what in the world is closed loop gain used for?!  actually, in unity gain buffer Ao is still used cos there are no extra resistors connected in the feedback loop. but when there are extra resistors added to the feedback loop, then the effective gain is the closed loop gain..............i think.............  hmmmmmmm........cool.....i can finally type without looking at the keyboard.............alrite~! so studying does weird things to u....................but typing without looking at the keyboard does help me pass the exams~!!!!!!!!  die lah....................

       This is something that's been bugging me since i dunno when............it's a kinda pointless question.........but i think it is something that nobody can prove............    "What if the world were colourless?"     I mean think about it...............air is colourless.............but we cant see air............you cant say black or white or grey.........cos those are colours too in a way..........they reflect certain lightwaves and absorb some to produce the colour........so if the world were colourless, what would we see? we wouldn't be able to see objects.......also colour is relative to the surrounding objects............    example, if let's say u look at a white canvas..............u are looking at air which is colourless rite? so if let's say the canvas and evrything else is colourless too........so what can u see?    i still cant find an answer to this question..............the nearest answer i can get to is we'll only see silhouettes..........just outlines of objects.........but even that doesnt really seem to click cos you need a coloured background to see a silhouette..........but there's no colour in the background!

      ok..........i just have to rant about this............FEAR FACTOR is a cheesy show.........so is lightyears............and the miss singapore universe pageant............  wanna know what they all have in common? they all have a cheesy cast, with cheesy storylines or rather bustlines in the latter............ I mean, fear factor has really cheesy contestants........it's a game of dare.........just go there and do the freakin stunt~! there's no need to play on other people's fears or blah blah blah..............and may i add, DURIAN IS NOT A DISGUSTING FRUIT~!!!! it is a delicacy...........how in the world can they use durian in one of the eating stunts is what i wanna know............  lightyears sucks bcos of the characters squeaky voices............my god...........and get this...........it's a show about polytechnic life shot in a university campus....ahdoh~! another major flop for sure..............now i'm wondering, what is so interesting about polytechnic life that mediacorp can make 2 serials about poly life so far.........there aren't any serials about JC life nor uni life.............so wat's the thing about poly life? hey, if squeaky voices and relationship probs make for good tv then i think just about anywhere will make for a good location for a serial..............except for maybe the old folks home...................  miss singapore universe sucks why? bcos i'm hoping it is not the true representation of s'pore women............not the word here is HOPING.............IF the beautiful women in singapore are really the same calibre (mentally) as they are............think i'll go take a vow of celibacy if that's the case..................my god..........and the new miss singapore universe has a 'fierce' face.................her looks will definitely cause a fight in a kopitiam..............not bcos they people are fighting over her............she has the "kiam par" look....................basically..........bitch face............sigh.............what were the judges thinking.................

      Here's another kai-ism:    "If it's meant to be yours, it will be yours........     I actually got this from a friend quite sometime back and it popped up again when my sis told me a fortune-teller predicted that my brother-in-law would make a big fortune in dunno when. This friend of mine explains many things this way.Things such as winning the lottery and such. Basically, it just says that if things are meant to go your way, they will go your way. There are some things in life you just cannot control. So there is no point in fretting and calculating and obsessing about them. I personally do not adhere to any religion nor teaching. I believe in fate and that brings me to another kai-ism:     "All things happen for a reason. Sometimes starting off logically, but always ending up unexplanable. And they still happen and will happen again."     A friend once decided to follow a certain religion because he felt there was a greater being out there that causes things to happen spontaneously. I agree with that, but I do not agree with the greater being explanation. To me, all things happen for a reason. Take for example, why I'm pausing now and why I'm deciding to type out what exactly I'm thinking. The reason behind this? Because I'm trying to think about how to explain this. Note the word TRYING. cos it's very difficult to think and watch tv at the same time. Nvm, forget the example. Anyhow, even the smallest and most un-important event happens for a reason. But at the end of it all, it all boils down to events happening randomly and spontaneously. And these things you cannot predict, explain nor you do that thing you do...........huh? whatever.     "What goes around, comes around............and smacks you in the face."     This is almost similar with the chinese saying, "Er you er bao, shan you shan bao". Meaning, do good and recieve good, blah blah. But I would change it to, "Er you er bao, shan you whatever bao u can think of". Meaning, the earlier saying is really useless. Seriously, how many times has a person done good but recieved bad in return. Hey it's reality. So for those who are still in lala land, pls go smack yourself in the face. But the gist of the kai-ism is that, there is a consequence to everything you do. A really simple example would be holding your bladder for too long. You get wet underwear.

How to drink your alcohol and puke at the same time.....THROUGH THE SAME STRAW.     4. How to not do stupid things when you are not yet drunk (i.e. tell your friend, "Let's get drunk~!" when seeing another already dead drunk)     5. How to not smack the people who are trying to help you get home.     6.

       2 days and I'll be 22years old............ god i feel old............time flies really fast.............can't believe it's a year since my last birthday.........which incidentally i spent mostly drunk.......... and so did many of the other people at my birthday................hmm.........guess it can be considered quite a success...............    let's see how many other birthdays i will most probably have left................1.....2.....3......10......20.......ok.........give it until 50 more years or so................. here's another kai-ism about birthdays:      "You will always only live until your next birthday.........so celebrate it well.........cos it might just be your last............       not trying to sound pessimistic here.........but you never know when you will go........when it's time to go, it's time to go.............so celebrate your birthday well......besides you are only 22yrs old once in your life.......or 25 or 50 or whatever...........so do the stuff that you love to do and make sure your friends have fun also.....cos they are your friends...............    did i jus type that.................die..........think im turning senile..............at the nice young age of 21yrs and 363 days...............hmmmm.........actually think it's more of the worrying abt exams.........WHY IS LIFE SOOOOO UNFAIR~~!!!!!! i wont be able to celebrate my birthday in peace for the next 3 years~!!!!! and by the end of the 3 years, i'll be too old to handle alcohol effectively.............and i'll become a crazy alcoholic every birthday..........hmmm.........sounds fun..........YEA BABY~~~!!!!!    NOTE: The above mentioned party method is conducted and supervised by trained professionals. It is very dangerous and should not be attempted by people without prior training. Kids please don't try this at home.

      Here's another kai-ism:    "We live to eat and eat to live........."    Think this is something that is widely accepted by alot of people out there.........but i believe the first half of the saying is better enjoyed by the majority......... This leads me to another kai-ism:    "There is no greater love than the love for food. Neither is there a greater pleasure than the pleasure of eating. Simply because to eat is a luxury."      Some religious fanatics might flame me for the first part. But I'll say one thing, you guyz are too extreme. That's why you are called fanatics. HA~! I'll bet you fanatics whichever god you are worshipping would probably have felt better with a full stomach than an empty one when they were mortals. Even you can't live without food. Nobody can. You can love food, you can derive happiness from eating. Don't get me started on the sex part, cos I'll tell you it can be done........go watch "American Pie" and you'll get what i mean...........    The second part, is VERY true..........think of the tastes from the food stimulating your senses........think of the feeling of a full stomach after a meal..........think of the lazy feeling you have after eating.............what can i say..........it's better than anything in the world...............may i add, you are getting sleepy, you are growing sleepier...........your eyelids are getting heavier......you are now under my control.............damn....i'm missing the swirly swirly thingy............never mind, you are not getting sleepier, your eyelids are extremely light and you are not under my control, forget the last few sentences. That's just another part of my plan for world domination.................*evil laff* (In case you haven't noticed, you already forgot the last few sentences and dismissed them entirely. So you ARE under my control. *evil laff*)     That leads to the last part, to eat is a luxury. To love is a luxury, pleasure is a luxury. Therefore, to eat is a luxury. Although food is a necessity, TO EAT is a luxury........some people can't eat although they got food cos they need to sell the food to make money..........that leads to another kai-ism for another time......I'm hungry.........."If love is blind, I'll find my way with food......" THAT was not a kai-ism........it doesn't make sense..........actually as do all my other stuff........but it still doesn't qualify............maybe another day it might........it's starting to make sense.......hmmmmm............i'm hungry...........

      pimples........my lifelong companions..........hate them.............  i've had all types of them.........small ones, tiny ones, big ones, huge ones, composite ones, cone shaped ones, dome shaped ones, cone shaped ones with a green cherry on top, pimples the size of US on the world map...........etc etc.......name one, i've had it...........it's turned into a been there, done that sorta thing..........  yea.......i can just see it now..............50 years down the road, I'll be a pimple tycoon..........making a living out of growing pimples and harvesting them for the sake of scientific purposes...............hmmmm............that would make me more of a test subject for scientists than a tycoon.............. my experience with pimples, it shows..............on my face.......  my face, it's a war zone.........something that saddam would probably be imagining as the scene after his mother of all battles............  pimples, they just sprout..........like mushrooms...........hmmmmm..........i like mushrooms.........mushrooms are nice...........not on my face though.......... if only i could take a syringe and suck out all the pus in the pimples.........if only they had a use for the pus........maybe cultivate the bacteria in it and use the toxins produced for botox injections................then i'll be a millionaire face.............  yea.........it's disgusting..........but when you've had as many pimples as i've had, you kinda go loco........cuckoo......... hmmm........never had a cuckoo shaped pimple......yea, that's a consolation..............life is good.............

      Another kai-ism:    "If it's time to go, it's time to go..............I mean die you idiot..........not pee"    It's actually quite the same as "If ya gotta go, ya gotta go." If you need to pee, ya REALLY gotta pee............so when it's time to die, you will die............it's better to let go than suffer from a burst bladder............die i mean............. I agree it might sound like an irresponsible way to put things, but hey, wake up and smell the roses............you can't control how long you live...........we cannot tell when we will die from piss leaking into our blood stream through a hole in our bladders...........or die from SARS (which incidentally i strongly believe Osama created the virus)........ as a good friend of mine puts it, "No point lah...."  the only responsible thing you can do is live your life happily and make sure all those around you have happy memories to remember you with..................that way, they will in turn do the same for their friends..............

       ok..........some more kai-isms: Got this one during my Discrete Maths lessons...........It applies to the natural male human reaction to a beautiful woman..........no.......it's not what you think, perv.........   "If A sees, B sees. If B sees, C sees. Therefore, if A sees, C sees."   It works both ways too........and can be applied to many other kai-isms.  This next one is a general observation and happens quite often.............   "Beautiful women will flock together..........ALWAYS............."   I'm not sure of the reason for this............think it's the same herd instinct that pulls guys together...............  A combination of the previous two kai-isms:   "If there is a beautiful woman, A, there will be a beautiful woman, B. If there is a beautiful woman, B, ...........you get the idea."   This explains the earlier kai-ism more simply.    "Having a lot of guy friends does not make a girl a tomboy. It only makes her a very deluded and horny girl."    I got this while reading an article on the new miss singapore universe............in fact it's something i see a lot in all this sorta articles............. I gotta make this clear..........even though probably no one is reading this,  "A girl with a lot of guy frens does not mean she is a tomboy. She is just a very deluded and insecure girl who needs to surround herself with alot of guys to assure herself that she is attractive and have power over men." No, I don't have something against beautiful women or women in general. I just feel that such people are really sad cases........    ok....stop here...........need to sleep

      Think I'm gonna start a "ism" of my own.......as in "Taoism", "Buddhism"...........like Richard Fish from ally mcbeal............ I shall call it, "Kai-ism"!    Here's the first rule of "Kai-ism":   How to wash your car -   "Only wash and polish the front and back."    Why? Cos the front is the only thing they'll see on their rear view mirror when you come charging up from behind. And your rear is the only thing they will see as they eat your dust..............What about the side? Cos you'll be too fast when overtaking them.

      here's a way old kai-ism i use to describe certain things................it's one of the first few kai-isms:   "It is impossible to get lost in the world..............."   It's backed by a very simple theory..............first of all..............we live on an island..............so if you hit water............you know you are going the wrong way..............and further more............even if you don't hit water, the world is round...........so no matter which direction you go............you will eventually find yourself back at the same point again................simple..........

      ok...........here's something i picked up while watching "Karate Kid" on TV.......so i decided to add it to my collection of kai-isms..........   "When you walk on the road, if you walk on the right, it's ok. If you walk on the left, it's ok. But if you walk in the center, squish - just like grape......"   I think what it basically means is that whatever you do, be decisive and stick to the decision.............being indecisive will only lead you nowhere.............  That aside, i have come up with a theme word for after the exams............it's "INDULGE".............and that's exactly what i'm doing now.................indulging in guilt free TV watching..............actually i have one more paper tomorrow................but what heck...............

      Tomorrow is my discrete maths paper................and after reading tons and tons of pages of discrete maths text and notes, I have come to the conclusion that the people who invented maths were really very bored people................and the people who want discrete maths to be taught to the student population are either really blind or sadists.................WHY CAN THEY LEAVE THINGS AS THEY ARE?!??!  I don't getit............why bog students down with stupid things such as "all numbers can be written as primes or have a prime factor in them"..............i mean, a number is a number!!! stop touching it! and stop asking students to prove things such as "There are a finite number of primes of the form 4k+3"...........Basically my point here is, "I DON'T CARE!!!!".............i'm satisfied doing normal maths................i don't care if the greatest common divisor of 2 integers are the minimum primes of each number........  sigh.........wish i could say the same for exams.................back to books...............  nvm..........*lun lun*.............i will lun.................just 24hrs and im free...........*lun*

      here's a new kai-ism:   "Exams are like a rollercoaster ride............"   It's very simple. The days that you spend studying and mugging for the exams are the same as the upward ride of the rollercoaster. They are long, torturing and full of nerve-wrecking moments...........and then when you hit the top..............it's all downhill from there..............most of the time including your results............they keep going down down down until you hit rock-bottom...............just like your confidence in the exams.............

      i've been doing some thinking while studying earlier.................in light of my disappointing performance at the electronics paper yesterday, and also the ridiculous difficulty of understanding discrete mathematics, i have decided to quit schooling for the time being and setup my own business..............  yea..............i have yet to decide what to sell.................i am open to suggestions............but i have my eye on certain lucrative ideas.........chicken rice, cai tao kueh.....char kway tiao.............but i think the most lucrative one would be to sell my ideas of kai-ism to the people of the world.........hmmmm............i believe that would sell very well as a coffee table book...................or in the form of toilet rolls so people can read before cleaning themselves off..............not a bad idea actually.............  ok..........back to studying.............

      yes..........i can't study..............again~!!!!!! studying is depressing...........it kills your brain cells..................so much so that all you can do is become a potato.............i think i am becoming one..........eat too much....if im not studying, im eating.....if im not eating, im studying............this does not bode well on my body.............  and all you do when you study is sit right? so it's not good to be sitting down the whole day cos all your organs will start to move towards your butt...............so you'll end up with your brain in your butt...........gives new meaning to the term "butt head"...............so that's not good...................cos you'll be sitting on your brain during the exams................boy, that has to hurt.............but look on the bright side, you will never have headaches again............u'll have butt aches...............yea............the next worse thing to having headaches - having butt aches...........and when you become constipated due to the lack of exercise, you'r gonna be smelling weird stuff even though ya dun have anything in front of you..........  ah.........the wonders of studying............it makes you less of a human...............and more of a butt.............. see what studying does to me? i type nonsense...............actually i type nonsense most of the time............but this is really nonsensical nonsense.............at least my other nonsense make sense..................nvm..............see what i mean?

      Ok.............i can't study..........again~!!!!!!! sigh...........this is not good................studying is a very difficult thing to do when you dun feel like doing it but you have no choice but to do it otherwise if you dont do it, next time you will start to think why didn't i do it and then remember because you don't like doing it but then it's too late to do it cos you have already flunked out bcos you didn't do it so you start regretting not doing it and then wishing that you had done it else you wouldn't be sitting in that sorry state thinking that if you had did it, then you would not be sitting there pondering why you did not like to do it and writing rubbish on your blog confusing yourself and still wondering why are you still not doing it............  do wat??  oh ya........study..............sighz....................

      Some weird things really happened yesterday..................i saw a lotus elise and a honda integra type R on the way to a family dinner at rendezvous hotel...........they were stopping at the red light one behind the other............stupid thing was the lotus stopped behind the integra..............how can a lotus be made to stop behind an integra?!??!  anywayz, i realized why the lotus is such a good car..........the driver was practically sitting on the road! yea, the car was that low on the ground.............the lotus stopped next to a taxi, so i could see the very obvious height difference............even the integra looked like a monster truck in front of it..............another thing was the engine........my bro-in-law's car was 2 lanes away from the lotus and all we could hear was the lotus............only thing i dont like about it is the hood.........looks terrible........  so we finally reached the hotel...........and parked there, was a bright yellow ferrari modena..............i have never seen a lotus before, but i've never seen a lotus and a ferrari all on the same day..............and then...........during dinner............i saw..........not another sports car............i saw a toyota corolla............a tree crashing down on it......just missing it.............yea, i SAW the tree fall............really freaky ya know............to see the tree fall on a car..........no the car wasnt smashed............the main tree trunk just missed the boot...........but the branches didn't...............  it's like some sorta doomsday signs or something..............or maybe jus lucky to spot all these weird happenings.................either way..........it leads me to another kai-ism:   "Never settle for a japanese car. If you can, upgrade to a continental car asap. Cos if a tree falls on your head, either you are fast enough to get away, or the car frame will hold up."

       ok......so now there's this HUGE.........actually not so huge.......but HUGE pimple on my face...........sometimes when you have a big pimple on your face don't you just want to squeeze the life out of it..........and then watch the pus ooze or spurt out like a super soaker 100 gone nutz...........yea.........i don't want to do that..........    what i feel like doing is.............to take a syringe...........poke it into the pimple......and then suck the pus all out............the enjoyment is in seeing the amount of toxic green stuff that can be harvested from just one pimple the size of USA on the world map.............now............imagine how much pus you can harvest from 5 of them............by that time........you'll be nothing but one giant, living, breathing, pulsating pimple.............kinda like the alien spores you see in an Aliens movie.............when the alien eggs start to hatch, they pulsate............and when the alien comes popping out of the egg..........that's more or less you squeezing your pimple.............and the alien clinging onto the throat of the dumbass stupid enuff to go close to the egg..............well......that's your pus stuck to the mirror covering the reflection of your throat............    ok........on to more important stuff................I AM BORED~!!!!!!!! anywayz, i was watching the new "xi you ji" series last nite on tv............and this is sorta like the aftermath of the original storyline...............basically, i would say that it is not entirely a terrible show.................it was HORRIBLE..............i don't get it...........there was this scene which shows the whiny monk (yea, tripitaka) fighting~!!! really~! like somersaults and all that shit.................i thought he was supposed to be against killing?!? and in the first place, he's supposed to be the whiny monk! he's supposed to get captured and whine alot, and have stupid faith that his disciples will save him (which incidentally they always do)....................    ok on to the grand finale of the show...............it showed wukong fighting the demon...........nothing wrong with that...........but why does he have to do it street fighter style?!?! duh! i mean like...............he was doing evrything~! chun li, guile, e honda, blah blah..................i dun get it............chun li doing the kick thing.......the "hundred leg kick" or something liddat............she looks great doing it..............wukong doing it looks more like he's using his hands to wave his leg around...........doh~! oh yea, there was the sonic boom power by guile also..........and an uncannily familiar kick that whips in a cresent moon..........doh~!     sigh............one of my favourite age old childhood stories tainted by the wildly colourful japanese culture of modern time..............but if they used japanese girls for the show, think that would be great~! yea~!

      ever had one of those days that you felt something is wrong or is going to go wrong? well...........mine just passed...............and let me just say it was not an enjoyable one...  i had that naggy feeling that something was wrong since the morning.............like as if something bad was going to happen..........and something did happen...........i crashed my car.........i.e. i had an accident............anywayz, that's not the weirdest part.........it's like today was the day of the number pairs.............i've been plagued by pairs of numbers the whole day..........  today, 0206 (i.e. 2nd June) at 1150hrs, i met with the accident.............my car (number 1335) crashed with another car (numbered 4566).............when the tow truck came.....it's number was 5566.............when i finally finished with all the paper work and stuff...........and my dad came down to the breakdown centre.........it was 1424hrs..............going further...........when i called for another tow truck to bring the car to the workshop.............it's number was also 5566! fair enough............my place has this irritating fella who likes to park his car outside my house...........his number is 5544...............and there are other numbers too..............i saw a 8894 and a 2259 parked in my estate also..............on the way home in my friend's car, i saw a 4433 in front...................WHAT IS IT WITH PAIRED NUMBERS!!!!!!!?!?!?!??!?!? even the "d" key on my keyboard is acting weird and printing two d's instead on one d....................oh yeah...........the tow service numbers had a alot of 3s and 5s also........and when i finally got home..............the time was 0044hrs..........and when i came out of the bath.........it was 0055hrs....................oh yea..........and the price for the snooker game i played with my friends was $21.00............and the price for the repairs of the car might come up to $1500...............  anywayz.............it may seem like a coincidence..............i figure this is jus a very bad day..........things cant get any lower than this............i must have hit rock bottom.....so the only way to go is up.................yes.........i shall invest some moola tomorrow on all these numbers at the lottery............if i get it..............hey.........that'll be nice..............if not.........dun think i'll have much to lose................:)  i guess my dad is rite................positive thinking is very important..............especially when things get rough..................it keeps you from falling into depression.........if not for that important lesson...........i don't think i would be taking things so well now...................thanks dad...........

      I've always wondered why people take part in the lottery.............it's obviously for the money.............but what is it that spurs people to take part in it so religiously?  lately i've been short of cash.............of course with the big buang i had, now im paying for the repairs...........*heart pain pocket pain* and i believe it's due to the accident that i've taken a little interest in the lottery...........and trying to make money in general...........something that i've never shown much interest if any at all in the past...................  i used to think that people who buy lottery tickets were all buying "hope"..........and now i strongly believe this is the case.............it's not an obsession with making money anymore..........it is the hope of attaining our dreams that leads many people to buy lottery tickets............  In singapore, our dreams are you could say mostly of material gains...............the 5 Cs come to mind...............frankly, i haven't any idea what the 5 Cs really are...................i think everyone has their own version................but the main thing is that people buy the lottery bcos they want to achieve their material goals..............thus brings me to a new kai-ism, more like a theory actually..........    "The Big Buang Theory"    The basis of this theory is built upon the fact that people are not born with the desire to make money...........but they are born with their hopes and dreams..................events have to happen that culminate to people feeling the need to make more money to recoup their losses so they can continue on with achieveing their dreams..............these events can be multiple money incurring events or as in my case one HUGE buang of a misfortune...........multiple events can lead to one big accummulative financial incurrence...............however, if a person who can manage to live life away from moola and basically away from the rest the world..........probably in some deserted land or something, would not have dreams of material gains.............

      whoever said that the internet is a great source for information was definitely right..........  i came across an article just now that taught people how to measure the speed of the microwaves in your microwave oven..........all u needed was a piece of chocolate or anything that melts and a ruler..............by heating up the chocolate until it starts to melt and then measuring the distance between 2 hotspots on the chocolate, u get half the wavelength of the microwaves produced by your oven.............interesting........  another interesting thing i learnt while surfing the net was how to measure a woman's bra cup size...........though i don't remember it anymore cos i think ill stick to my old method.........i believe more than a handful is a waste.........of course that's because i have quite big hands..........though less than a handful is too little also.............

      recently, i've been wondering why people are bored...............why do people get bored...........how in the world do people get bored in the first place?  and also how in the world did some of those big shots make it big especially with ADHD..............  i've come to the conclusion it all stems from a 2 character traits...........it's a person's curiosity and his sense of perfection................  look at it this way.............a person who is very curious probably has his brain working most of the time...........his interest is driven easily by the slightest thought..............this is the basis and the start for a person to keep his hands busy........  a person's sense of perfection is his continuous need to outdo himself.........to better his last performance...........until he reaches the point where he gets a feeling similar to an orgasm...........u get the idea..........  so......if we put both traits together..........if we all develop both of these traits.............i don't think there's a problem of boredom any more...............possibly even the end of senile dementia...........maybe even world peace.........given any activity maybe like playing a motor racing game anyone can never feel bored.............ever...........  all this does not factor in the physical aspects of the human body.......things such as fatigue and sickness do have an effect on the human mind also...............

      now...........if MI2 and titanic were interwoven........then that fat rose wouldn't have fallen for that scrawny jack.............she would have gone for the handsome ethan hunt.............at least ethan hunt would have had a better chance of surviving getting crushed by the big iceberg........i mean when they were in the car making out...........duh.........  now that's aside..........here's an oft heard phrase that i have decided to induct into my blog of kai-isms:    "The world is round..........and money makes it go round........."    If i had enuff money........i would make it spin faster.........but that would basically be a waste of my money cos it would achieve nuthing for me..........on the other hand.............it's the easiest way to create the world's largest joyride.........  Technically, the world is slightly oval cos of the magnetic fields..........yadda yadda yadda.............

      ok........i had this idea for quite awhile now.............  they shld make the movie industry like a kinda movie universe..........something like wat the comic industry has.........y'know....marvel universe with all their heroes and the DC universe with their own heroes..........so i think they shld do films that have some sort of interwining storyline with other corresponding stories..........  imagine having Mission Impossible 2 and Titanic interwoven..........and maybe Tomb Raider and South Park...........okay......that's abit off the line....maybe let's say..........We Were Soldiers and Enemy at the Gates interwoven  then maybe you can have The Godfather with Titanic since they from the same time frame...........  of course you could have crossovers..............Disney with Paramount Motion Pictures..........then it'll be Nemo vs South Park................poor fishes..........

      ok...........was listening to the radio jus now........and they were advertising the new "ringring" tone thing...........the one where the service provider replaces the ringing tone u hear while making a call.............  anywayz..........i was thinking what happens if they have a tone that has heavy breathing and moaning and groaning.......ya.........and then goes the scenario:  guy calls his girlfriend..........and then he listens to the ringring tone while waiting for his girl to answer the phone.........the phone rings for a while.........the guy's thinking,"Wow......this ringring tone thingy is great........" he detects a familiarity in the moaning and groaning but cant place a finger on it...........and the moaning and groaning continues on......he thinks his girl is busy with something else so he hangs up..........  next day he's feeling frisky and starts getting it on with his girl..........and then suddenly it's turong senjata for him.........  for the uninformed............turong senjata is the malay command for "arms at ease"...........  ok lah.........call me perverted..........but hey.........it makes for great advertising if the service provider decides to use it......

      i am proud to declare that I HAVE DONE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TODAY~!!!! all i did was laze ard..........watch tv..........sleep.........this is bad considering my exams are less than 2 wks away.........BUT i have a valid excuse..........nope.........not valid reason.........a valid excuse.........ya ya ya..........it's an excuse...........there are no reasons for procrastination..................  ok.........so here goes...........i had a bad stomach.............ya.........the whole day.............it's an excuse and I LOVE IT~!!!  anywayz........at least i did something fulfilling...........i read a section of the papers...........now that's an achievement considering i seldom touch the papers..................and what did i learn from the papers today? well........i've learnt that the papers can be much more substantial visually than a porn mag if they wanted to...............there was a huge article on breasts today...........there are pictures of breasts all over the pages..............and to tell the truth i found it interesting............did u know the average cup size for women in s'pore has increased from A to B! wow~!!!   hopefully ill still be alive when that increases from B to C.............cos i believe an average handful is around a size C...........think my handful is around D...........but i doubt my hands or any of my 3 legs will be working when the average cup size increases to D...............that's sad.........but ill be looking forward to the B to C increase...........

      ok i think im allergic to eraser dust................got this rash right on the center of my italy (read YI-DA-LI).............it came about when i started studying for the exams and had lots of eraser dust on my table.................  ya......im not blaming the rash on the exams........bcos it's ridiculous to be blaming the exams for this kinda un-important thing.............we shldnt be condeming exams.........they do us so much good...........like kill our brain cells and make us more senile the more papers we take...........it makes us do extremely stupid things like writing inconsequential things and posting it up on the web for all to read.............ya..........exams are beneficial for us..............yup they sure are..........  ya rite, whoever believed or supported the last bit of crap i typed...........u must be a participant in the "Brainiest" contest.....by the way..........any1 noticed that almost all the participants so far are speckies? ya, and the next one, "Brainiest Scholar" is gonna be one hell of a laugh.................im looking forward to that..............yes...........scholars and me are a no no..........we dun mix well......................

      was listening to the radio earlier on today..........and there was this programme about couples trying for children..........and they had this doctor on the programme to give some advice on how to optimise the factors for a couple to concieve........  one of these was about the woman having to take her temperature every morning........and i quote, "Take your temperature before you wake up in the morning" Ya, i get wat he tried to say..............but..............  how in the world do you expect to do that? how do you take your temperature before you wake up? i mean.........what are you doing before you wake up? you are sleeping~!!!! unless the doc's expecting the woman's significant other to take a thermometer and sticking it up her ass...........AND unless she is the kinky kind, i dun think Mr significant other will be significant for very long no matter if it's a thermometer or anything else for that matter...........  and then there's this other thing the doctor mentioned.............he mentioned that guyz should exercise more to increase fertility............and swimming is the best form bcos...........get this.........it cools the balls..............  no, he didnt say balls, he said testes. but i prefer "balls"..........i aint no doctor...............  then in my opinion guyz shld swim naked.............ya and scare the balls off all the other swimmers in the public pool........that way they cant concieve and based on the law of the wild..........the naked guy gets to spread his seed as widely as possible bcos he's the only one who can make them..........  or picture this...........couples trying to concieve will have something else to do when they wake up in the morning........the guyz wont be putting menthol shaving foam on their faces only..........  better still..........guyz NOT wanting their great lives ruined by children will be doing something else while their wives are sleeping at nite................in the bathroom taking hot showers..........  ok..........last bit..........  there's this new MacDonald's advert on tv now.........the one on the Fish McDippers..........and the jingle had this line in it, "My boy is dipping in his sauce and my sauce just like his dad"................hey, this is not PG rated you know...............sounds more NC-18 if you ask me.........if you dun get it..........use you imagination alittle...............if you still dun get it..............no amount of menthol shaving foam will ever help u.............

      here's something interesting that happened last week while i was shopping for a friend's birthday present........... now, before my illustration of the incident, let me make a shout out to the birthday boy,  "YOU BETTER APPRECIATE THE PRESENT~!!! I HAD TO BRAVE GREAT DANGER JUST TO GET IT~!!!!"  now that's done, on to my david and goliath story........... "In fair Tampines where our (a friend and myself) odyssey unfolds...............david met goliath........."  ok lah, abit unkind to call it david and goliath..........but.........wat the heck...........anywayz, we were wandering around century square in tampines looking for a metal chain necklace..........and we wandered into "Yellow"...........and this salesgirl approached us..........smelling the possibility of making a sale...........she turned on her persona knob to "Salesgirl friendly"..........and i, smelling a possiblity of a bargain, turned my knob (figuratively, NOT literally.....abit obscene if i were to do dat......and totally painful) to "Consumer friendly"..............and the exchange went on until we managed to pick one particular piece..........  i had requested she matte the piece of necklace cos it was too shiny and i would come back to collect it in half an hour's time..............so we left and returned.........she was still matting the necklace.........so we took a look around the shop somemore...............and i made a passing comment on how i wanted to buy a piece for myself but had no money.........  now this is the critical part...........and this is exactly what she said (translated from Chinese), "If you don't buy now, next time you won't be able to see me here anymore."  ya.........duh~!!!!!!! evidently she had turned her knob to "Looking for a guy friendly" and was hoping i would turn my knob to to same level..........anywayz, i jus dismissed the remark and pretended nuthing happened.........subsequently the salesgirl was too embarrassed to look at me while i was paying........ the salesgirl isnt ugly...........chubby tho........sweet looking lah...........BUT NOT MY TYPE~!!! and even if she was.........i was only looking for a sales transaction~!!  i do not doubt that im irresistably handsome.........but somehow or the other i seem to attract only females of the larger kind and those males unsure of their own sexual identity................it sucks~!  maybe i should have invited her to my friend's birthday celebration that night.........and introduced her to my friend as his present...............so i say again......... "YOU BETTER APPRECIATE THE PRESENT~!!! I HAD TO BRAVE GREAT DANGER JUST TO GET IT~!!!!"

      i dun understand this...........how can a tv show still be called "all new" when it has been showing for months?!?!  they are putting "all new" this and "all new" that or catch the "all new" season of this or that on every single show~! and the the stupid thing is, the show has been showing for the past 2 or 3 mths~!!!! as much as i'd like to agree with the marketing strategy of the tv station, but this is carrying it abit too far.............to the extent that they are taking the viewers for idiots.............."all new" this and "all new" that.................as i like to say "all 'your dead man head' new"................

      here's something to think about.........  {true} bored = sian {bored == nothing to do} based on assignment axiom  {nothing to do == zuobo} something to do = nothing to do {something to do >= zuobo}               since (something to do == zuobo) then (something to do >= zuobo)  {true} bored = sian {bored == zuobo} by assignment axiom {bored == zuobo} nothing to do = sian {bored == zuobo ^ nothing to do == sian} therefore, {true} bored = sian; nothing to do = sian {bored == zuobo ^ nothing to do == sian}  i dun understand it either..............sometimes i feel like im not on this earth anymore.............shit.........cant find my brain

      here's a riddle to think about, "What do you do when you are bored and have absolutely nothing to do?"  answer is very simple...........ABSOLUTELY NOTHING~!!! isn't that incredible~! wow~!  actually i have lots to do..........just dat i dun feel like doing them...........but actually i only have one thing to do.........STUDY but i dun feel like doing it.........mus enjoy for this evening.........enjoy the fruits of my labour after a successful paper today.........and enjoy it while it lasts..........cos the next papers are absolute goners.............  another thing i came across while studying the other day..........why do people verify the correctness of programs? i dun get it...........you'll know if the program is correct when you run it~! why bother to mathematically verify it?!?  sigh.........the world is a paradox..............and that sux...........no verification needed for that..........

      watched "Return of the King" a few days back...........and there are only 2 thigns i can say about the movie......one, it's too damn good to miss...........it's worth every cent of your dollar and more..............  two, it's quite a "happy" movie............."happy" in the sense you might feel abit disgusted..............there are many scenes where you find guys calling other guys "my love" or 2 guyz pretty much acting "happy".................and there's even a character which might have wanked too much...........he talks to himself like talking to another person and refers to him as "my love"...........go figure..................  i think the director is a very "happy" person.............it's quite unsettling if you ask me.............it's abit too "happy" if you ask me................

      ok..........i jus read this crazy article from boredomsucks.net...........it's abt women and semen..............  it seems that women whose partners used a condom got depressed easier as compared to those who don't.......really~!!!  anyway, i dun really know the truth to this.............i havent gone around knocking up women and then asking them how they felt after that..............anyone out there tried it yet? let me know if you have...........it's gonna be one hell of a laugh................especially after she finds out u didnt use rubber when she tot u were using one...........hahahahahaaa.......  ok lah..........that's not funny..............lives can be ruined bcos of this.............it is irresponsible and inconsiderate and unthoughtful of me...............heck..........HAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAAAAAAAA~!!!!!!!!!  lesson learnt here for the guyz is,"Don't go knocking up girls without rubber in your wallets."  and for the ladies, "Always carry rubber bands.............in the event your partner doesnt have condoms, you can still have protection........and if you are into bondage.........pull on the rubber band and let fly.........ouch~........now that's protection"

      fear factor has been showing on tv for quite awhile now...........and they have all those creepy crawly dares for the participants.............but i think the scariest stunts are not those where you have to eat bugs or jump off a building or ump into a pool of snakes.............  one really scary and traumatising stunt would have to be enclosed in an empty biosphere all alone without anything in the biosphere.............no objects, no people, nothing at all, and maybe a clock.........that ticks.............and to be enclosed for say maybe a year or 2 would be sufficient enuff to drive anyone nutz..............  another stunt, is to jump into a six feet deep hole full of people.........for the ladies, it would have to be full of testosterone charged men..........while for the men they would have to be estrogen charged.........ya.....'happy' people...........and i mean REALLY REALLY happy.............so imagine being in a deep hole that you cant get out off and there are a whole lot of guys/gays groping at you trying to spread the lurrrrrrve~~~  now that's scary...........

      ok..........today i have something more substantial to post.............  first off, there's a new theory abt women's butts that the guyz and i came up with in school today...............it seems that the colder the weather, the perkier and tighter the butts going around..............there was a noticeable increase in the number of good looking rear ends moving around the school today.............im not sure what causes this strange but most welcomed phenomenon, but here's my fren's reasoning..............the cooler the weather, the more the butt muscles contract........thus leading to a much perkier and tighter butt.............my reasoning is that when the weather is cool, the ladies can afford to wear tighter and more air restrictive clothing.............air in their clothes is not jus the only to get restricted...............think most guyz find it really hard to breathe when their girlfriends dress up more during the cooler weather.............  and this leads me to a new kai-ism~!!! finally.........after many months of drought..............    "If ya got it, Flaunt it.........."    this does not just apply to the good stuff such as a perky butt or muscular body.............as long as it is not offensive to others, why not flaunt it? so wat if you are larger than life? flaunt it~! give yourself some confidence...........live it up alittle.............  and on to my last substantial post...............i have finally found out how chickens get bird flu............i thought of it while driving home today..................there were a few trucks transporting cages and cages of chickens..............and guess what? it started to rain!!!! and the cages were not covered, so the poor chickens were getting drenched in the rain........so there u have it.............bird flu~!!!! exciting isnt it?

      you know the thing that most people wonder about, what is it about men and breasts................ well, i dun really know also.........and im a guy~! but ill try to answer it today..........it's not our fault~!!! we are guyz~!!!! we are testosterone driven creatures..........we do not jus use the brains in our head.............but it's not a bad thing..............let me state first, whoever invented the male sex is a friggin genius~!  ok back to the topic abt men and breasts...................it's not entirely our fault we are fascinated by breasts..........i mean......there are adverts on tv about women's breasts all the time~! all those slimming commercials and the latest one......the triumph bodysoft line of undergarments...............how's a guy gonna react PSYCHOLOGICALLY when he is flashed long lingering scenes of womens' breasts for most of an hour's telecast time?  and the makers of the advert are damn smart..............they pick the nicest pairs.........tell me, what's a guy gonna do?!?!? tell me~!!! this is the biggest conspiracy ever played on humans.............ill bet even the ladies are fascinated by breasts also................they watch the advert and probably go, "ooooo.............aaaaahhhh...........i wan~!!!!" the bra or the breasts i dunno which they want, but they'll go running out to buy several pairs so they can try to replicate wat they saw on the telly.........  anywayz, i think both nature and environment make men so fascinated with breasts..............i was watching the discovery channel the other day and there was this documentary abt a tribe in dunno where, and the female tribes people were practically naked...........but u dun see the men staring at them 24/7.............maybe cos they dun look too good.........i dunno..................  to end..........ill say something ive said before..........more than a handful is a waste...........cos i have big hands.........bras are jus a convenient way to help men measure breasts without actually having gotta use their hands...........they are measuring cups.............

      ok.....ive got a new theory abt men and women..........actually it's more about men and women's sizes.........  dunno if ive posted this up before..........but wat the heck.........  in our world........or at least in the world i live in...........there are many ways to describe largeness........... for the men......there are so many adjectives.........well-built, masculine, big boned, etc etc......... but for the women..........there's only one word........FAT..........  guyz, wat do your girls ask u when they try on something in front of the mirror? they ask,"Do I look FAT?" you see, they use the word more than we do........they think of themselves only 1 of 2 ways........FAT or not FAT..........but they never say they are thin~!!!! y? cos there never is a thin~!!!! they are always FAT and need to get not FAT..........  and what happens when u tell them they dun look FAT? most might just smile and SEEM to accept it...........but actually deep down inside they still think that they are FAT.........  here are some reasons why we guyz always keep telling our girls the same thing while they are in front of the mirror: 1. if we told them they are not FAT to make them feel better, then they really are FAT...... 2. if we told them they are not FAT and it were true, they still wouldnt believe us cos they still think they are FAT... 3. if we told them they are not FAT without looking at them, then that means our eyes hurt looking at them..... 4. if we told them they are not FAT bcos our eyes hurt looking at them, means that we are looking for a way out of the downhill relationship.......... 5. if we told them they are not FAT while we have our arms around them, means we got stuff that needs polishing....... 6. if we told them they are not FAT without looking at them means there's something more interesting on the telly......possibly BAYWATCH.........and BAYWATCH girls aren't FAT.......... 7. if we told them they are not FAT while smiling, we are lying.......... 8. if we told them they are not FAT after sex, then we are ready for a second round........OR maybe it's jus a simple,"Thanks girl, can I sleep now?".............. 9. if we told them they are not FAT with frowns on our faces means we are late for something......... 10. if we told them they are not FAT while looking in their eyes, we mean it...........NOT~!!!! we are still lying........

      i think in this day and age, with the music of this day and age, we music lovers must learn how to appreciate retro music so that we can further appreciate the music of today and the future.........  ah shucks.........jus trying to sound smart...........not saying im not smart.........but not saying im smart also.........heck......i am smart.........i am helluva smart..........i am so smart i scare myself sometimes.........hehehehee...........enuff ego boosting......  back to the point..........i think retro music shld not be dissed..........at least not all of them shld be dissed.........most suck.....really suck...........but there are some really good old stuff that can still get your butt shaking and body moving...... songs like "Night Fever" by The Bee Gees, "You're My Heart, You're My Soul" by Modern Talking, "I Need Your Loving" by The Temptations and stuff from Culture Club..............i think most would agree with me that at least one of these songs still gets their toes tapping..............  and one more..........John Travolta still rules man.............sure his saturday night fever dance was kinda dumb.........but hey....it's the attitude and style he brings with him that is appealing.........  in the future only 3 names reign supreme: PAUL VAN DYK, DJ TIESTO and PAUL OAKENFOLD..........'nuff said

      ever since "Passion Of Christ" came out, there's been this big hoo-ha abt censorship...........and there was this particular short clip on one of the channels abt how movie censorship benefits the viewers...........get this, they claim that now with more levels of ratings, we get a wider selection of movies to watch..........think this is a really ambiguous claim.........kinda hard for pple to relate to..........  at first, think most pple would be going, "Huh?"..............how would having more censorship ratings affect the selection of choices? as far as ratings r concerned, only those who have access to all the ratings will benefit..........and even then, what's there to benefit? the movies are there already.........it doesnt mean that jus because you have access to all the ratings, u suddenly have more movies to watch than before the ratings were implemented...........  i think wat the censorship board is trying to put across to the pple is that, wif the new ratings, they will be able to bring in more movies and not worry abt not finding the proper rating for the movie...............maybe..........but this is singapore~!!! who do they think they r bloody kidding~!!!! they'll take off all the good parts of the movie irregardless of wat rating they give it...........and after they do take out everything, the movie's as good enuf for a 8yr old as it is for a hormonally charged 18yr old...........either way for the 18yr old guys, he'll jus go home after the movie and have wet dreams of the gorgeous lead actress..........and the girls will probably not be following the plot, they'll be jus staring at the lead actor....  we watch the same movies as the americans..........except maybe the really lousy ones like those filmed in the backyard of somebody's house on home video...........so wat wider choice?!?!?!? movies from the middle east? how abt movies from the north and south poles? imagine watching "Antartic Beauty", the story of a walrus going through mid-life crisis......geez...........wonder if they have a suitable penguin for mena suvari's role..........

      alrite.........today's post is gonna be quite substantial.........but i need to study~!!!!! heck.........  first up, it's interesting wat goes thru the minds of students during lectures.........at least i find my thoughts extremely weird and totally un-related to the lecture or each other........  take for example, today during a lecture, it suddenly occurred to me that a fren had cut her hair.........and the last time i saw her was in an event abt a mth ago..............fantastic isnt it..........so i set abt finding out the truth of the missing hair and sms-ed her..........but i think she mus have thought i was nutz cos there was no reply.........and i later found out from another fren she was in fact wearing hair extensions before that event............ hmmmmm...........now..........this is one of those stupid things that women do.........wear hair extensions to work - in the hot sun~! huh?!?!  ok.....nvm the mystery of the missing hair, during the same lecture, i also recollected an article i had read on sunday......this one's interesting........... the topic of the article was supposed to be abt ethics.........but it was abt whether bras cause breast cancer..........and nvm that, the author was a guy...........think the guy must have been a boob guy, cause he certainly did his research quite well......talk abt job interest.............i did learn a thing or too from the article though...........i learnt that bras preventing sag is a total myth..............he states that sooner or later, breasts will sag.............so supports my claim that we guys are the biggest victims of the earth cos wonderbras r the biggest joke played on men.............  anywayz, wat i find most puzzling is, wat has bra causing cancer gotta do with ethics? maybe it's cos the writer was trying to cite the inaccurate findings made by a husband & wife research team as unethical..........but seriously........huh?!? think the writer jus had nothing ethical to write abt.........and so he decided to indulge in the safety of the female bosom........by writing such an article, he gets to enjoy himself wif research and yet draw readers to his column although his article had no relevance watsoever..........  the last thing on my mind during the lecture was actually abt how little pple laff nowadays.............i think wat we need more is to laff and less of the worries abt work..................work we have to........but i think most pple seem to forget that we have to rise above all the work and enjoy life alittle..........laff a little, smile alittle........and things will seem so much brighter...............of course too much of a good thing is jus as bad as it is good.........work is a mus do, but keep wif the schedule u have for yourself and work jus seems to fade into the background.........  on to more serious things, today i think, would be the ultimate example of my kai-ism, "What goes around, comes around, and smacks you in the face........" on the way to class this morning, i did not perform my usual "overtake and horn"..........kena horned i mean.........so i think the whole world decided to take the chance to capitalise on my moment of vulnerability.........1 friggin van and 1 sonovabitch lorry cut dangerously in front of me on the expressway while i was trying to overtake another vehicle, and they did not even signal~!!!!   it seems like when the weather turns bad drivers turn badder.........and it just happened that today i did not feel like pulling any fast moves and this is how i get treated in return.........it does not pay to be good to the world nowadays.......from now on im gonna put every single driver on the road wif me, in danger..........no more mr niceguy........and the first on my list, corollas...........  actually, there is a bright side to this, i could take it as a compliment to me..........the drivers miss hearing their hearts pound in their ears so much that they want to force me back into my old routine again..........awwww.........so sweet.........*pour sarcasm here. allow to drip dry.........."

      alrite, jus tot i'd put this up b4 i forgot abt it......... today, i did something really bad..........at least i dun think it was bad..........but think most pple would slam me for it......... while driving to school today, i horned a nun driving a corolla...........and in my defence, let me just say this, she was hogging the road~!!!! nvm she hogged the road, she was seeking shelter in the shade of roadside trees while holding up the rest of the traffic at the traffic light...........and nvm she was doing all that, to top it all off, she was driving a corolla~!!!  am i sorry i horned the nun? no.........it's very simple, if u cant drive well, dont drive...........if u r gonna drive like u own the road, u better be related to the LTA chairman, else many pple will be trying to run u off the road..........and if u drive a corolla, u are on my hitlist...........  on to other topics, today i was sitting in the canteen wif a fren..........and we were lamenting at the low population of girls and lower quality of girls in our course............if only we had some form of exchange programme btwn courses..........yea....if only..........den the biz ad girls (note, girls only, the guyz can exchange elsewhere) can exchange with some of the guys in our course.............  and my fren came up wif the name for this programme, it would be called the intercourse exchange programme........ now THAT would be interesting........

      well..........think ive mentioned before that life throws funny things at u.........and jus when u think you've seen it all.........something else pops up and makes u realise u havent.........well........it happened to me jus now only.........  was surfing abt the net and dropped by the Ministry Of Sound website jus to see wat was new.........and there was a "X-Rated" online video channel...........and so..........being the normal male homo-sapien..........i was curious..........so i clicked on the link..........the first few videos were.........how shld i say..........entertaining.........but curiosity really did kill the cat........and i soon found that out.........  i tot i had seen them all.........all kinds of videos.........and then up came a video..........of barbie dolls making out..........lesbian barbie dolls........barbies dolls shagging............it was how shld i say.........errr..........surreal?  and then..........nvm mind that.........i thought it was over......and up comes an advert for one of ministry of sound's albums........showed naked women dancing at first...........and then..........it was naked men........... i think it would suffice for me to say, today IS and possibly will be the most traumatic day of my life..........sorry......i need to go wash my eyes now.........my eyes~!!! im blind~!!!

      alright, so here's something new on the extremely illogical and totally un-understandable world of women........  was helping a friend yesterday do some filming for her project........and my car was an essential part of the filming (im so proud of my baby, it's a model).........so we had to go downstairs to where the car was to film it...........and my dear friend went to put on a pair of socks.............y? cos she was going to wear shoes..........  but we were only going downstairs?!? she said she did not want to rub off the skin on her heel........ok.....fine......so we proceeded downstairs.........and then.........guess wat...........she wore her shoes like slippers~!!!! squashing the heel of the shoe down............ huh?!?!?! den wat's the purpose of wearing the socks?!?!?  and then there was another thing that happened..........this involved her friend...........something that the female species seem to like to do very often..............talk to their belongings...........huh?!!??! i was fixing up a another friend's comp the other day...........and i asked her if she did anything to try and remedy the prob...........she said she talked to it and tried to coax it into working.............and she even sayanged it...........but none of the above worked.......... errr..............duh~!!!!!! was she expecting it to work?!?!?!?!?  somebody explain this to me.........i really really do not understand women...........but then........as much as i complain and get perplexed by their actions........i guess guyz and girlz are pretty much similar........jus the perplexing stuff is all on the surface and it can be sooo..........perplexing...........anyone can guess how i feel now? ya.............perplexed~! all together now........PER-PLEXED~!!!! one more time..........forget it...........  do you women ever stop to think abt wat u are doing? and whether it makes sense to do it in the first place?

      was watching the tv jus now and saw the trailer for the next "brainiest" show....."Singapore's Brainiest Lawyer"........ and there was also the next "Singapore's Brainiest Kid"...........kinda shows how little imagination or how low a calibre singapore television is...........  anywayz..........how come they do not have titles like "Singapore's Brainiest Procrastinator"..............would be interesting to see how the host manages to get an answer from any of the contestants..........then maybe they could come up wif "Singapore's Brainiest Schizophrenic"...........then Gollum from LOTR could take part........and lose terribly............cos all he'll be doing is going,"My Precious....."  Host: "Who is the president of the united states of america?" Gollum: "My Precious....."  Host:"Errr........Which recording artist was recently charged with child molestation?" Gollum:"My Precious....."  Host:"Gollum........Here, let me keep the ring for you......" Gollum:"NO~!! Tall evil woman wants to steal our precious!" Smeagle:"Woman is not evil. Woman is our friend....."  Gollum: *spits* "Tall woman is evil~!!! Tall woman is not our friend.......tall woman is too tall........too tall is not our friend........" Smeagle:"No........Smeagle will not let you hurt Tall woman......tall woman is smeagle's master......"  Host: "oh yuk.........i might be female and i might like older men but you r way too old.............oh god........and senile too......can you please put on a pair of pants?"  Smeagle: "Smeagle does not fancy master.........Smeagle wants to serve master......Smeagle is too gay to fancy master......Smeagle only fancies Gollum.........Gollum is my love......"  Host: "oh yuk..........and stop staring up my skirt~!!!!!"   speaking of schizos.........ever wondered if those superheros in comic books ever suffered from schizophrenia? i mean.....they have secret identities and stuff.........and lead double lives..........isnt it just possible that maybe one of them got too carried away? that would be interesting..................batman sitting in his cave going, "My Precious......."  back to the topic abt brainiest kids...........i noticed that the kid who won the last brainiest title had a big head, was extremely skinny and big specs..........now we know what happens when you push your kid too much.........he becomes malnourished.........now all ya have to do i give him a nice shiny ring and...........yea.....all together now........"My Precious".....

      ok......so my fren read a piece i put up on this blog and had a few opinions on the topic of women and older men......... and we had a lively discussion that went on to women being ruled by emotions while men r logical creatures........ so i made this comment abt women being illogical at times......and she said that it's not that they are illogical, it's bcos we guyz do not understand.........  so here's wat's interesting.......... if something is not logical, it's illogical...........so if we guyz understand something that's illogical, means we are illogical creatures..........but we are the logical ones~!  so by arguing that we r illogical when we r logical, isnt that illogical?  but this fren of mine had this to say, she said, if we understand it den it will no longer be illogical..........  but how in the world  can we understand illogical things? did i mention my fren was female?  which brings to mind my kai-ism, it might have the property of illogical but it is not necessarily illogical.........and THAT, is not logical to me..........it's totally illogical~!

      my life revolves around very few things really..........let's see.......... Women, Fast Cars, Money, Music and my Family and Peepz..........ya.........to put it all simply...........my happiness...........  But today, it's not going to be abt my happiness...........it's more abt wat intrigues me most..........and it's the same thing that intrigues all men - women  im sitting here......watching "America's Next Top Model" as i type this..........and there was this part where a contestant was late to a gym workout.........y? cos she was primping herself...........to go to the GYM~!!!!!!!! duh  anywayz, they used to say in the olden days that women shld be seen and not heard.............well...........i prefer to see and feel...........in more ways than one..........  ok........something else jus happened..........one of the contestants jus fell ill.........she was shivering and crying and had to be sent to the hospital..........sighz..........times like these i realise y men were made in the first place.............to carry women to the hospital cos they cant walk when they are sick...........but the ball swings both ways.........we get lotsa luving in return...........hehehehee...........and to quote a certain movie, "we have to do it........cos we'll die if we dun do it"  back to the topic.............jus the other day i was chatting to a friend...........and she was stressed.........she had a few major deadlines to meet.........and they were drawing near..........and this part i dun understand.........she was stressed not bcos the deadlines were near...........she was stressed bcos she was bumming around and not doing her work........huh?!?!??!?! how hard can it be to jus pick yourself up, do the work and get it over and done with?!?  and the other day, i was playing snooker wif some frens.........and a fren asked me wat time it was..........neither of us had a watch.........and all our handphones were on a tray jus 2 metres away from my fren..........so i asked her to check out the handphones.........and guess wat...........she didnt want too...........y? cos she was too lazy...........huh?!?!? and then i had to get the phone for her to check the time........sighz.............  women...........hate to love them, but we cant help it. love to hate them? which man can do that? maybe the gays..........speaking of which.........sometimes i really envy the gays.........cos they get access to the best women........EASILY..........  i jus saw a gay stylist adjust a HUGE diamond in "The Land of The Twin Peaks"..........if i were him i would be scaling the peaks..........more than once...........but then if i were him, i would be gay...........and i wouldnt have such interests............but then again...........them peaks were high enuf to turn any man, gay or not gay, into a mountain climbing addict...........

      ok......here's something that i came up with while eating lunch just now..........  in school there's this girl, tall, abt 2yrs my junior, not exactly pretty or beautiful, slim (stick thin actually).........and she's always seen hanging out with a bunch of guys..........only.............  one will begin to wonder why she does that.............oh yah, did i mention she's helluva rich? ya..........she is...........it's very interesting..........cos the only thing abt her that i find attractive is her height..........other than that, she's pretty much jus a skeleton with extra "mammary bones"..............but other guyz dun seem to think so..........  a few months back, somewhere at the end of 03...........i was bumming around outside the lab with some frens.........there was a group of guys, think abt 5 or 6 also there.........and she comes along..........evidently the group of guyz know her......and suddenly they are like a pack of wolves............she was leaning against the wall talking to them, and it's interesting how the group slowly starts to surround her..............my frens and i were watching in amusement...........  it looked like bees mating, u know, the drones surrounding the queen bee? or a pack of wolves on a hunt.........and i think she wasnt exactly an innocent prey...........more like a vixen who knew her powers of attraction.........k lah..........that's bad of me......but it really seems that way someimes.........i have never ever seen her hanging out with any other girls..........she's always with at least one other guy...........makes good fodder for rumours..........  this whole thing brings me to another point, i think in most societies the females always seem to want to find an older partner.............one fine example would be when a fren of mine approached another girl in a club one night, she was around our age......cos she turned out to be the fren of a fren of ours.............and she turned my fren down with a simple line, "I prefer older guyz."  this is kinda sad for both sexes actually...........it has been said that women mature faster..........ill agree with that, but "level of maturity" has become too much of a factor in terms of the power women have over men.........as in the above example, it's a great ego bursting pin.............but then again.........let them have it.........cos we still have the upper hand in society........it's a called "male dominated society" for many reasons you know.................  there are so many things to add.........lazy to type lah.............but ill say one more thing...........it's really sad for the guyz cos if u look at it, the problem snowballs to the bottom, junior females preferring senior guyz all the way until the bottom where the junior guyz are pretty much left with nothing...........poor them...........  as for me, i can see myself in my 50s and dating 20 something year olds during my mid-life crisis...........of course if i have a wife then, she wun be too happy abt it...............and the best part, she cant date any guy older cos: 1. any older guy probably cant get out of his wheelchair 2. even if he can get out of his wheelchair, he'll still need viagra, which in time will cause him a heart attack 3. he'll probably fall asleep listening to her  and she cant date younger guyz too cos: 1. pple talk 2. few younger men want older women. they want women of the same age~!!! 3. she would still outlast him in sex, but the thought of being tied down to a woman with kids probably of the same age as he is doesnt appeal much........he might as well start seeing her daughter if she has one...........

      so lately ive been digging lounge music..........not really jus lounge music, let's call it chill out music..........so ive decided to update "The Absolutely Boliao and Inconsequential, Uncircumstantial, Not Worth Looking At, WTF?!?!?, Dumbass column on the left hand side of this blog."  Chill out music is really really great for those who like to jus bum around doing nothing or chill out and have some time to themselves..........relax and listen...........also there are some lounge music albums tailored for certain purposes, namely, "Erotic Lounge"...............actually after listening to it, there wasnt anything erotic abt it cept for the song titles........ but then again, think it's made with women in mind, guyz are visual creatures, we dun need music to get it going..........all we need is a room with a woman in sexy lingerie.........now THAT'S an erotic lounge..............  anywayz, ladies and gents, kick back and relak with a martini/scotch/cordon bleu in hand...............

      sianz boy...........fooking sianz...........one more time........sianz boy.............. lately ive come to a revelation abt certain things in life that we percieve to be difficult to achieve or attain..........  very often we hear things like, "it's too hard" or "ive tried my best" or "ive already done this this this. but dunno why still not enuff"..............well, a lesson ive learnt in my course of quitting the cigarette...........is that, it's not just abt how much you do...........there's something else that's equally as important as the amount of effort you put in to attaining your goals.........simply - it's how much do you want it........  it's quite a simple thing actually.............but not easy to swallow or carry out also...........few people can actually swallow the fact that what they do is just not enuf.............often, it's this self denial that leads to problems........a person has to open his own eyes wide open and admit that, hey, ive not done enuf...........and then ask himself.............how much does he really want to get to his goal...........other than knowing what goal it is........perhaps knowing the impacts and consequences of achieveing the goal will help boost his determination...............  and today im proud to admit and celebrate 2 things........... 1. i flunked my last sem exams bcos i did not put in enuf effort for them..........and my goal is to make sure i clear the rest of my semesters as smoothly as possible............and then get a job that i will do to the fullest of my capabilities.........jus so i wun let myself down...........  2. it's been 2mths since 9th Jan 04...........the day that i gave up smoking for life..............:)

      ok........what is there to gripe about today? i have absolutely no idea...........i had some thoughts past few days...........but didnt jot them down or anything...........so guess what? i forgot............  in a way, that's gd.........cos dat means i got more time to study some..........instead of writing about kinda inconsequential stuff................hmmmmm.........and suddenly i remember wat i wanted to write about today...............2 things.........bear with me will ya?  first off.........this topic requires more thought..........i think one of the strongest driving forces among the range of human characteristics is pride........... think about it.............whether it's for self pride or it's to show others.........pride perhaps motivates humans easiest........for example, a group of boys playing soccer..........each tries to display his owns skills and outshine the others..........each plays hard and tries to improve his skills everyday jus so he wun lag behind the rest in the game...........he might think he's doing it cos he wants to be the best among the rest of the boys..........but further along the road he might realise it for his own self ego and pride that he continuously tries to improve his skills.............  contrary to the belief that pride is one of the seven deadly sins, i think it swings the other way and is jus as effectively helpful in a person's life and self development...............it can be used to motivate a person to strive for greater achievements............  next up is a new entry into my list of kai-isms........been awhile since i put any new ones in........so here goes........   "A something is a something, if and only if it has the property of that something......"    actually this is from one of the subjects im taking in school...........basically it jus means that if something smells like a thing, it tastes like that thing, looks like that thing, it still might not be that thing.........that something might have properties of that something, but it may not necessarily be that something, but for it to be that something, it MUST first have properties of that something..............  lost? ya........so am i...........but the world hasnt ended so dun bother worrying abt something being something else and not being that something you think it is cos somethings jus arent wat they seem just becos it looks, smells and tastes like that something...............nvm...........

      today there was this article on the newspaper..........kinda interesting..............in fact the whole page was rather interesting.............it's kinda like the 'sex page' of the papers.............most of the articles were related to stuff on sex.........like "homosexual sheep" and "topless march against anti-nudity laws"  first off...........homosexual sheep?!?!? now that's a first...........i duno how many pple will actually be interested in knowing abt homo sheep..........i mean...........homo sheep!!!! wow~!!! that's so interesting~! and the article mentioned that there are homosexual tendencies in many species of animals..........  but seriously, i never thought i would ever see such an article..................imagine the king of animals, the lion, getting knocked up from behind by another.............totally defines fall from grace..........  and the other day, there was this docu on discovery channel abt hitler..........seems like he was gay too.........interesting.....the most evil and possibly smartest man in the world..........and he's gay..............wow........the fact that he's gay makes him even more dangerous.............maybe he killed all of them jews cos one of them rejected his advances...........wow...........im having a revelation here.........to be powerful and successful.........ya gotta be evil, devious, smart and most ultimately GAY~!!!!!  ya rite.........screw that (no pun intended).........im staying straight............even if it means being a goody goody two shoes, being a mommy's boy and puny..........

      here's something really huh-worthy......... thing happened during dinner today..........went something like this.....  was talking about something with my parents......couldnt remember wat it was..........but suddenly my dad mentioned that the word "kohee" in japanese meant "the female sexual organ" (it's a direct quote)...............errrr...........huh?!?!??!?! and it was dinner~!!!!! at the dinner table~!!!!!  ok..........maybe nothing's wrong with that...........but then subsequently my dad and mum started a long discussion abt vulgar words...........and how a fren of my mum's got mistakenly called "vagina"..........no prizes guessing what her actual name was.............but they couldnt bring themselves to use any...........y? i figure it's one of 2 reasons.......... 1. they didnt want to cos i was around....it would make them embarrassed...... 2. they would be embarrassed even if i wasnt around.........  im leaning towards the 2nd reason.........cos my parents are what most would label as the kuai type..........not the type to use vulgarities...........the most they probably can get out is 'shit'.............and they cant throw one word out without almost breaking out in laughter...........or maybe im jus not used to hearing them scold vulgarities...........think it's a little of that too...............  and what did i do during dinner? kept my mouth shut, finished up and left the table..........bcos of 4 reasons........ 1. i lost my appetite 2. to save myself some embarrassment 3. to save my parents some embarrassment 4. prevent myself from feeling further disgusted

      ok.........here's another food for thought...........didnt put it with the prev post........else too long.........hard to read..........  there's this thing going on in NTU and NUS about file-sharing........seems like the schools are taking action on students who are sharing their files...........and it is interesting how they are taking action..............they are resorting to fines...........  first thought that coems to my mind is, "why are they getting monetary gains from the situation?"  the whole file-sharing thing basically jus involves the student and the recording authorities...........so what has the school got to do with it? ok..........bcos the school has been deemed as a regulatory channel for transfer, they shld take action on any illegal activities.............true true.............but why fines? why not just suspending accounts of the students?  i fully agree that the schools have to take action..........but having monetary gains bcos of the situation seems alittle too much to me.............granted that students are POOR...........and a fine would seem like a deterrent..........but isnt the suspension of accounts a much better alternative to implement as numero uno action to take?

      there is something in this world that is more dangerous than drivers not using a handphone hands-free kit while driving - cyclists not using a handphone hands-free kit...........today i came across one who nearly knocked me down while he was happily trying to ride his bicycle with one hand while talking on the phone using his other..............how stupid can these people get?!?!?  his balance wasnt very good to start with..........wobbling all over the place..........and nearly smacking into a pillar before he decided to stop and finish his conversation................it's interesting though.........how such people think...........he swerved to avoid me..........but that did not fire a warning in his brain that what he was doing was dangerous to others..........the only time he did stop was when he nearly banged himself on the pillar..........funny how people tend to stop doing dangerous things only when they themselves face a threat and not when others around them are facing the danger that they are posing..............but who am i to judge.............i'm not them..........i did not ride a bike with one hand and talk on the phone at the same time..........i wasnt the one who considered my one hand riding skills to be good enough to avoid danger.........piangz............these people r really dumb ass...........  on to more gripey stuff.............i got saman-ed.........AGAIN~!!!! this time i had put a parking coupon...........but i missed the carpark auntie by 8mins~!!!!!! tian you he li?!?!?! i dun put coupon, i kena saman, i put coupon, i STILL kena saman........i might as well pay an advance saman to hdb and lta so i can at least save myself the time of going to pay the samans and buying parking coupons.............

      there are many slimming studio ads on tv nowadays..........most promise to give women that perfect body..........recently ive noticed this particular ad that doesnt promise to give the ladies the perfect body............rather it promises to give a women a girl's body of 34-24-35..........nuthin wrong with the dimensions..........but the weird thing is how they chose to market their service..........  a girl's body?!?! at first look, the dimensions provided, 34-24-35, look pretty good...........but compare this to the previous 36-24-36, i cant help but wonder where the 2 inches off the top and 1 inch off the bottom went...........and why 2 inches off the top? i always thought the perfect female form to be slightly larger at the top than the bottom..........when has that changed? ohyah, i forgot, we men are from mars..........we are not in tuned with the changes made to the laws on planet venus........ but i thought it's our opinions that matter in the fist place?!?!?  and why a girl's body?!?! do the people on venus think we martians want to oogle at pre-pubescent or maybe teenage girl bodies? on a side note here, maybe the mars rover can find some martians up there and ask them......cos evidently we have lost touch with what we want now...........no doubt that there are some people who find the blooming age of girls to be attractive..........but they are jus a small minority~!!! and i don't think a girl's body is 34-24-35 in the first place......  think about it this way...........imagine a beautiful mature woman's face.....ful lips, smouldering eyes, long curling lashes, almond shaped face, *drool*............on a body that has a small top but wider bottom..........some asian cultures may endorse the new definitions..........but ill really start thinking twice about getting hot and heavy with a girl of such proportions.............it jus looks weird~!!! for me it used to be fear of skinny women with big heads cos their bodies looked like they would fall apart if you touched their heads..........and now with the bottom heavy women.........you might just need a big roll of black tape by your bedside in case her waist breaks off..............black tape works wonders.........for that matter, the girl can go..........men can jus shag the roll of black tape..............

      many times i have found out that it's extremely difficult to resist temptation.............like for example last time i spent a huge bomb on my car's head unit and front speakers...........knowing very well that in the future i would be spending more on changing ALL the speakers in the car..........and today..........or the past few days rather..........the itch to change ALL my speakers came.............and boy it itches real bad...........  anywayz..........was thinking abt some of the crazy things ive done in the past while i was washing the car.........and i think it would suffice to say that ive committed my fair share of blunders in my 23yrs of life.............  23yrs..........sometimes it doesnt really hit me..............jus the other day my fren was telling me that another fren was going into NS soon..............it went something like this:  Fren : "hey, you know xxx is going to NS soon." me : "izit? how old is he?" fren : "same age lah. 23." me : "23?" fren : "ya lah. 23." me : *blur* fren : "imagine. he's same age as us but he's going into NS only now......" me : "23?"  i see the situation 2 ways........... 1. I'M TURNING SENILE~!!!!!! I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER HOW OLD I AM~!!!! 2. i guess sometimes we lose track of certain things cos we dun really wanna admit to changes in our lives.........changes like growing older.........think it would be safe to say that most wan to stay young as long as possible........  it's ironic......many teens wanna look more mature cos they wan to be taken seriously (actually cos it's more cool....but let's give the benefit of the doubt here). Older people wan to look younger so they can show that they are as able as the younger ones (actually it's bcos of their vanity but again.....BOTD......benefit of the doubt).  not saying there's anything wrong in the above..........but underneath all of the trying to impress people, trying to project an image..........there lies the same reason...........self fulfillment...........people do all these jus to make themselves feel better abt themselves.............vanity and cool...........to be taken seriously and proving to have age defying abilities........the all boil down to the same thing.............self fulfillment.............  i still think i have senile dementia...........and im gonna end up like my father...........old....absent minded........stubborn...... not bad..........im already stubborn.........that's 1/3 of the way.........

      ive just checked my mail...........and all see in my inbox now is spam, spam and more spam..........as much as i find them extremely a waste of time to read and troublesome to delete, there are a few which have managed to induce a few laughs also...............  example, exhibit A............a razor for women who want the shaved look...........actually, i jus wonder whether it's the women who want it more or the men who want it of them..............anywayz, yea..........according to the ad, "painless~! no bumps~! it removes the thickest hair and yet is so sensitive to the skin. easy to manouvere."  dun ask me what im doing wif such an ad in my inbox..........i have no idea also...........spammers amaze me.......if i knew, i would probably be female.......and shaved..............  on to other things, anyone noticed how the news likes to show the different sexes on tv by focusing only on the crotch or the butt? and sometimes also the chest.............though i think they do the butts more cos the chest would jus be plain lewd.........  im not sure abt this yet, but i think a woman is less offended if a man stares at her butt instead of her chest..........i dunno.........ladies help me out here..........this is something new..............though this doesnt mean u guyz can go gluing your eyes on a girl's ass................it's bad for u................physically and mentally..............physically cos ya gotta start straining your eye muscles to point downwards................mentally cos it's hard to reprogram a breast man into a butt man................it could lead to a man with lost identity dangerous to women i.e. groping hands.........everywhere.......up down left right, u name it, he's got it covered..............

      breaking news~~~~ my pimple has burst~!!!!! pimples rather.........2 of them..........one singapore, the other, kuwait..........both produces pus like how both refines and produces oil.............  yep..........it left behind a crater the size of singapore.............this isnt bad tho.............u know how some pple are quite insensitively described as having a moon face? well............fortunately, my face isnt the moon...........but there was a time when i had the moon on the side of my face...........yea...........picture one huge pimple with craters and more pimples on it.....yea...........my experience with pimples is vast beyond your imagination...........and it shows...........i would bet the mars rover would get lost on my face..........either that, or get stuck in craters..........better still, get flipped over by once believed dormant 'volcanoes'.........  things arent that bad actually...........actually the zits have toned down alot since i quit the cigarettes and started to watch my diet alittle.............the word here is ALITTLE.........i have started to watch my diet A-L-I-T-T-L-E...............so dun judge me when u see me eating ter kah during lunch.............i jus love em..........cant stay away from them..........the edible kind....not those that u see leaving pot holes along orchard road...........ok lah..........im mean.........live wif it...........  anywayz, wat else is new? let's see..........was talking to my dad abt the joachim kang case...........for those not in the know, the guy embezzled quite a sum of money from his catholic church..................ok, the next part's not gonna be easy to swallow for some.........so if u think u can take my blunt words, read on...........  i read some of the stuff said by the pple..........and there are some really.........how shld i put this nicely...............dumbass?.....moronic?........brainless?..............farking stupid?...............errrr...........ok lah...........'nice' pple out there...............i mean..........there was this lady, helluva rich, who gave the bugger $800,000 as church funds, to use at his OWN DISCRETION.............$800,000~!!!!! at his OWN DISCTRETION.............i mean which dumbass person does that?!?!? and never mind, get this......this moron was an accountant............yea...........she's a friggin accountant and she does this sorta thing to a person not even family..............and here's wat she said, "i have complete trust in him. what happens to the money is btwn god and him." how in the world did she end up being an accountant?!?!?! like i said, she's a real nice person.........  one thing ill say tho...........this joachim kang is as much a blardy ass as he is a smart ass.............y?  first of all, the blardy ass part.............after being sentenced, he said his conscience was clear...........yea rite.........u r a friggin religious leader.............dun say this sorta bullshit for pple to hear lah..............ought to be shot.............stinking son of a bitch..............many pple say wat he did is btwn god and himself...........yea...........if that's the case, god probably asked him to take the money..........and when asked how god communicated with him........he would say he heard voices........better yet, he sees dead pple..........then i would wonder who he worships actually...........  next is the smart ass part.............yea, joachim kang is one smart ass.............think there would be some who would agree with me that by confessing, he would end all the hoo ha and jus serve a short sentence before coming out to live life as a rich elderly man...........yea, he'll probably leave some money to be recovered by the authorities, but he would most probably have some stashed elsewhere.............i mean, look at it.........serve 7.5yrs.........then come out with maybe half of the money still stashed.............and a man who has the capability of embezzling such an amount most probably would have anticipated such a scenario...............  when he said the pple must understand the reasons behind why i am confessing. it is to bring an end to the suffering of others in this episode................  yea, and so he can jus blow off the whole thing and enjoy his money without any more scrutiny on his future lifestyle..........and the pple who believe he's doing good.....................time to wake up and smell the roses lah................dumbasses.............

      this is gonna be another long day...............3.5hrs before the start of my first paper.............and 7 days to the 'unofficial' end of my exams.................exciting isnt it? farney how things get so monotonous as time goes by............each sem turns more and more routine...............remember feeling all the anxiety attacks before the papers during my first sem at ntu.............freaking out every single minute before and during the papers..........now.............i feel...............peace...........inner peace..............rather im more distracted than calm..............and wat can distract a man more than..................women~!!!  was watching episodes 8,9 and 10 of the OC last nite..............and i think ive found taste for women with short hair...........actually it's been a while...........but i think ladies who can carry off a short crop are diamonds in the rough..........which actress made my head turn so much? samaire armstrong.............saw her debut in episode 3 of the OC, and she left quite an impression..........  here's her fan site  urlLink http://www.samaire-armstrong.com   seriously, how many women actually look really really good in a really short hairstyle? better still...........find me a girl who is actually willing to go really short.........most lament even when their hair fall off..............and isnt the long hair sadako look getting boring? yea, mybe waves and bangs are in...........but..........it's still long hair...................think short hair is kinda fun too...........shows attitude and confidence...........all in all, it gives individuality................  yea.............and the good thing abt short crops, not everyone can pull it off.............so i dun think there'll come a time when we'll see it everywhere like the long hair styles we see everywhere now.............for those who think u cant carry off a short crop, either go botak or leave your hair..............nah.............dun even go botak, singapore would flood if all of u went botak...........and trust me, it would be a mess of tears and hairs.............

      since ive already done up a post on the world's current affairs this morn, i think now the only thing left for me to write abt would be the really impt things that are happening in the world today............namely, the size of my pimple...........oh i forgot, the world doesnt revolve ard me.............who cares, this blog REVOLVES ard me, and i tell it where and when to stop revolving and go the other way................  got this really huge son of watever on the side of my face.............think it's due to the recent late nites............see wat studying does to u? it destroys the most impt thing u hold dear in your life.............your friggin face...............think abt it.........which part of your body do u care for the most?  cant believe the weather, it's too damn hot to do anything.............half the time today was spent trying to save my sweat.......think im running low on it............now im sitting in front of my sis' pc with a huge fan blowing at my side........and im still bloody sweating................ill start sweating blood soon if this keeps up............  anywayz, past few dayz ive been stuck wif this great dilemma............it's something that would have a great impact on my life and the one whom i think i love the most.............i have talked to some frens abt it............and they encouraged me to go ahead..........they said it's worth a try...............but then, im afraid of being rejected............and there's a risk that things would turn out bad..............i might get terribly hurt in the process...............but there's also a chance that things will turn out great for the both of us.........  haiz............decisions decisions decisions............shld i? or shldnt i? shld i join the nissin cup noodle eating challenge? i mean, $3k for the 1st prize, $2k for the 2nd and $1k for the 3rd.............and all i have to do is eat the most number of nissin cup noodles in 15mins.............and even $1k is a fair amt of money..........enuff to buy a set of new wheels and tyres for my 'wife'..................of course i run the risk of getting extremely sick in the process.........how leh? how leh? ive timed myself before.............1 cup w/o the soup took me less than 2mins...........think wif a cooler soup would take me abt 3mins..............so how? how how how how how? decisions decisions decisions.............haiz.............still gotta go thru prelims first then finals............haiz..............

      i jus finished flipping thru the papers..........and didnt want to wait till i forgot abt it before i entered my piece on it here........well........let's just say the papers seem more like the funny pages nowadays.............the way things are being reported..............  i dunno if the journalist was trying to report the news as it really is or trying to be funny..............example, the recent collapse of nicoll highway...............the article contained bits of experiences by commuters...........and the journalist did a "report it as it is" on wat was said by the pple being interviewed.........a housewife in an apartment block thought the loud explosion was due to the national day parade rehearsal. so she asked her husband to bring their son to the balcony to take a look. and her husband's reply, "National Day rehearsal your head. Get out of the bathroom so we can go downstairs." i hope for her sake she has a nice figure......  somehow i just feel that this would be perfect for a tv reality series, but not for the newspaper............i would think the journalist would have the sense to do abit of content filtering........this paper will be sold outside of our country......and it doesnt reflect well on our pple's image.........  and from that to the stupid things pple do during a crisis..........one money changer grabbed 2 things when he evacuated a nearby building...........his handphone...........and his cordless phone................duh~!!!!!! you already grabbed your handphone rite? y would u need a cordless phone?!?! and never mind that, how would u expect your cordless phone to work that far out from your store?!?!?! if u had the time to grab things, wouldnt it first be your id stuff and then your handphone? y a cordless phone??!  oh i know...........he must have watched too many reruns of miss singapore universe 2001..........in case of an emergency, bring your handphone so u can use it's radiation to attract attention for help..........and he probably thought the cordless phone may help boost the strength of the radiation, OR allow him to call and console himself..............for wat, i dunno.......nonsensical pple do nonsensical things..................

      here's something that i think happens to at least 10% of the world's population at one time or another..........it's when u turn a certain age and your parents or relatives start asking that *wink wink* *nudge nudge* question during family gatherings or during weddings, "So..........When's it your turn?" or something close to that..........  well, im proud to say that ive been involuntarily admitted into this exclusive elite club..............by my own mother..........and she did it no frills style...........straight out of the blue..................this is wat happened:  me: *walks into room and sits down in chair beside mother* mother: *reading a book* me: *starts to open my mouth to ask something* mother: "When are you going to find a girlfriend?" me: *mouth open*  i was totally totally caught off guard.............at least she could have nudged a little, winked a little or something.............she even left out the "So........"..........but it's doesnt mean that i havent given this question any thought before.............so when am i getting one? dunno leh................am i supposed to blush now? customary ah? ok lah.........*turns beet red*.........happy?  seriously tho, i believe in fate...........and fate comes in many forms and ways.............so when u least/most expect it, she/he'll be there..............so wat am i doing now? absolutely nothing...........im happily waiting..............im a guy........and im still young.............even then, age is normally not a factor for men..............i'd like to believe in my small little personal world that im "Absolutely hot and sexy everywhere" *add british accent*...............call it self consolation? maybe. call it self denial? maybe. call it sad? screw u.  i guess to me getting a girl shares the same priority as doing well in my studies...........which is just a notch lower than staying happy and building my character..........true, having someone to be with brings alot of happiness..........but at this point in time, in this day and age, i think the whole gf bf thing is over rated...........pple put too much emphasis on it...........i guess one can argue that pple are social creatures and this has been going on since men started bonking women on the heads for sex.....ok, reasonable...........some might say im just jaded, sour grapes.............ok loh, up to u............your brain wat, not mine...........it's a reflection of wat u would be if u were in my shoes...........and den again, if u were in my shoes and i were in yours, u would understand my reasoning...............and i still wouldnt understand yours cos then my brain would be too small..............  come to think abt it, the last relationship i had was...........abt 4yrs ago..........wow..........how time flies.............yea, 4yrs might seem eternal to some...........short to others...........but, like i said........why count? if she/he comes along and things are cool btwn the 2 of u, den jump on the whoopee cushion and start making whoopee...............but dun let it bug u if he/she doesnt come along...........it's as good as tying yourself down mentally to needless worries.............  this next one is gonna be lame.........but i jus had to put it in............hhahahahaaa............. think i speak for many guyz out there when i say that ONE of the great things abt a relationship is making whoopee.......

      alrite...........this was supposed to my birthday blog update...........but then...........i forgot the time............aiya.......basically birthdays have become kinda forgettable for me..............i mean..........it's getting boring.........monotonous...........routine........the things i look forward to on my birthdays are the stuff that i wanna do........and those depend mainly on wat i have not done for a while..............den when i finally do them on my birthday......they bcome done.............and im left wif one less thing to do.............isnt it boring...........  for example..........breakfast..........ive not had a proper 7 or 8am breakfast in dunno how many years, probably longer dan the time it takes to grow from diapers to shorts..........im talking abt a real breakfast wif food and not just a cup of water or milk.............the word breakfast has all but disappeared from my dictionary and nearly non existent in my stomach's top 10 meals of the day..............  and they tell me breakfast is the most important meal of the day...........oh really..........and wat happens if i miss it? i get hungry? wow.........now that's something new..........so if im hungry when i wake up, dat makes the next meal i that i take, breakfast..............so wat happens if i wake up at 11am? and eat at 12pm? is that breakfast or lunch? it cant be brunch.....cos brunch is btwn breakfast and lunch..........and lunch is defined as the meal u take after breakfast.........so if the first meal i take after waking up in the morning is breakfast.............wat is the meal i take after i wake up in the afternoon? but then..........y the dilemma? there's only one word to describe it all...........food..........  the next thing that i wanna do but havent done satisfyingly for a long time is to sleep for 12hrs through the nite until breakfast or lunch or watever u wanna call the meal i take after waking up..............seriously.........if someone could jus turn off the sun for a day...........ill be eternally grateful.........and turn on a nice cool breeze too..........the world needs to laff more.........and we all need to have longer nites...........there are so many nice things to do in the nite.........namely...........sex...........sleep..........more sex..........cruising the highway...........more sex.............sleep..........u know wat i mean...........sure u can shag in the day..........but the atmosphere is always best at nite.............it's cooler too.............so when a cool breeze blows on bare skin, headlights shine..............and all things seem bright and clearer too...............it's a sign...........  there are things i dun really like abt birthdays tho...........PPLE WISHING U HAPPY BIRTHDAY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NITE............i appreciate it, it's a nice gesture.........thnks to all who do it...........but...........birthday boys need sleep.........and i often attempt to do the 12hr sleep thingy on my birthdays...........and the bright screen on my handphone does not help very much.............so..........if possible could u guyz save the birthday wishes until the next day? and i dun mean 12am, 1am, 2am.........i mean 12pm, 1pm, 2pm..............thnks..........  considering all the above stuff.............i would think that ive never had a fulfilling birthday...........and probably never have one..............y? simple..............if i wanna do fun stuff in the dark on my birthday......i wun be able to sleep 12hrs through the nite...........and if i do the 12hrs sleep, i wun be able to wake up for a proper 7/8am breakfast..........i mean, it wouldnt make sense for me to eat, shag and sleep all at the same time.............sleep and shag at the same time i think it's still possible........but eat and shag? either u puke everything out when she's on top, or u get a stomachache going missionary...........doggy style? dun think she would appreciate anyone using her back as an eating table...........  anywayz, to end it all...........i think it's really nice of the tv station to start advertising the new t-shirt bra on my birthday..........but..........im not really interested in the bras..........could they show something else? or maybe wear something else........or something less?

      can i gripe abt the heat again? yea......it's still farking hot.........and i made the stupid mistake of shifting the fan to my study area.........so now im typing this in my oven of a room.............logic behind it? so i will start treating my study area like a second home at least for the next 2wks or so...............  anywayz, i jus had a thought.........about y men and women exist.............while studying digital communications...........dun ask wat's the link.............if i knew, i wouldnt be taking exams in the first place..............  i believe in the existence of a thing called balance............or to put a more cheem word........moderation........nah.....balance sounds more profound...........so.............balance.............men and women balance each other out..........in fact, everything has an equal and opposite element to balance it................basically, it's just to say, a person can never have too much of a good thing..................too many sweets make you sick.........yea, u get the idea...........  take sex for an example........ya, my world revolves ard those few stuff and sex is one of them so if i wanna make use of it as an example, i will..........cos y? it's my blog.........and also cos of the friggin heat.......... anywayz, why izit dat humans were made such that their sex drives kinda wanes and dies off when they grow old? cos of balance...........when we grow old, we cant be shagging like rabbits like we do now when we are young....our bodies jus cant take it.........tho the government would love it..........but most importantly, i think our libidos die off mainly due to the "ick" factor...........no one would EVER want to know that their grandpas and grandmas are still going abt it like rabbits in the middle of the nite...................yea.......there are many going ons far scarier than the things u imagine go bump in the middle of the nite.............  but then of course, we humans, we like to screw around with things (yes, pun intended)...........we came up wif viagra, wif cialis, wif miracle drugs dat give men longer lasting boners even when we suffer from muscle atrophy or erectile dysfunction..............oh yea...........ED will no longer exist...........it'll be like smallpox.............eradicated...........cos there'll be traces of miracle drug passed on to future generations due to viagra induced pregnancies...........  bcos of our screwing around............both ways meant..............there comes the imbalance..............ever heard of the number one oxy-moron (an oxy moron is a combination of 2 words wif clashing meanings) "civil war"? here's the number 2,"horny geriatrics"..................u see........like i said before, women prefer older men...........and in the past, we the younger guyz at least have the one thing the older men din have............no............not stamina...........first of all, you need a boner...........and the old guyz din have dat in the first place~!!!! and now...........there's viagra........and the whole table jus flipped 180.............it's like antartica turned into a desert.............  so wat answer do we have for it? actually there is nothin humanly possible.............first of all wat's the prob? we need to be older to get women our age.............how? look older? we cant~!!! we have out done ourselves by inventing botox~!!!  but then~!!!!! wait wait wait.............nature always finds its way.............balance always prevails...........so nature and it's handy little tool called evolution...........came up wif...............no...........not accelerated ageing.........smarter women.......y? think abt it.............women hook up wif dying old richer men.........and either divorce them b4 they die, or get all the money aft they do..............den..........they go looking for younger toy boys which mean..........us........the younger guyz.........and we get the money showered on us.............then we.............use the money........to find younger women..........sure we dun get women our age, but like i said..........balance..............we might not get exactly wat we want.........but we do get something else good too.............it's balance all over again too...........shag older woman, not so fun, but we get money.........shag younger woman but lose money................wat can i say...............balance.............it's THE word.........

      i had a dream last nite...........i dreamt that my sister and i decided to take a trip down to malaysia.........to buy dried cuttlefish...........isnt that interesting?  y dried cuttlefish? to eat lah..............u can make good soup wif dried cuttlefish.............porridge too.........throw in some "pi dan" and "not so dried" cuttlefish and u get one of the greatest dishes known to the human person...........yea........one of the food elite.............  anywayz, back to the dream..........after deciding to take a trip to malaysia to buy dried cuttlefish.........my sis and i packed our stuff, got on a cab and headed to the woodlands checkpoint..........and when we got there, i realised i couldnt go to malaysia..........cos i had not renewed my passport...........and so wif heavy hearts, we hopped back on the cab and headed back home...........i remember being very sad cos we didnt have anymore dried cuttlefish at home...........yea........and when i woke up...........i felt very upset.............cos i realised how empty the world would be without dried cuttlefish...........*sniff sniff*...................  and from dried cuttlefish we go on to a drink that i think has been wrongfully taken out of one of our fast food franchises' menu...............the McDonald's Milkshake...........  i remember loving every drop of the milkshake when i was younger.........it was THE drink..........THE beverage to order to go with your burgers.........it was simply put.............fantastic...........i dunno y they took it out of the menu.........i jus hope one day they bring it back..............which reminds me...........there was this cooking competition called Iron Chef on tv sometime back.............and there was one episode where they made squid ink ice-cream.............doesnt sound enticing really........but the colour is really interesting..............wonder if they'll bring back the milkshake and come up wif a squid ink milkshake.......or better still, dried cuttlefish flavour..............nah.........dun think that would be nice..............  so......i guess the message today would be for us all to cherish the simple dried cuttlefish.............cos one day, when u realise u have no more dried cuttlefish in singapore, u will have to travel to malaysia to buy them.............  and bcos of the shortage of dried cuttlefish in singapore, we might have to start an education syllabus on dried cuttlefish specifically........and then for those who want to major in the subject, they would have to go to china to study about dried cuttlefish.........and then bcos of certain differences in opinions, INCONSIDERATELY cause a stir among the chinese there by making needless but hurtful remarks..................which in turn leads to deteoriating ties btwn our 2 countries..........and then "big brother" steps in wif his guns blazing..........but gets knocked off by china the sleeping giant...........which leads to the escape of "the fly (translate hor seen)"...........which leads to one huge mess.........  now u see how important dried cuttlefish is to us?

      let's see...........i was fooling ard the singtel website when i came across this "my dream d8" contest thingy......basically pple put up their blogs and info on themselves for others to vote and rate.............so upon seeing some pics of the top few female contestants, i was intrigued.............seldom do you get the chance to see what a blogger looks like and good looking ones at that.............i jus wondered what these pple would have to say...........ok lah, ill admit it, i dun give a damn what they think, i jus wanna look at them.........happy?  anywayz, i soon found out that there are SOME smart and beautiful women out there..........and by SOME, i mean one so far..............i scanned through a few, and only found one who's writings made me laugh.........the rest, fly kite lah...........actually it wasnt so bad...........but i JUST had a revelation...........it dawned upon me that many girls in singapore lack a really CREATIVE sense of humour............  it jus hit me really, as im typing this now.............i mean.........guyz, think abt the girls u know...........and think abt why u laff when u r wif them...........chances are you yourself are making the jokes and actually laffing at their reactions to your jokes.......so basically, u r laffing bcos: 1. u managed to get a provoked reaction from a girl 2. she's so cute when she's teased 3. u told a joke dat's not farney 4. your teasing attempt backfired on yourself all in all, the girl didnt make u laff bcos she was funny..............  it's true..........think abt it..........most girls i know.........lack the aptitude to spin a good tale for a good laff, or come up wif a creative story or funny way to look at something or possess a good wit...........most sit quietly and listen demurely, and raise laffs bcos of their reactions on getting teased.............or they use a very similar way, i cant find the word to describe it.........but read how they write on their blogs and u will begin to realise u are reading the same kind of stuff over and over again.............and many use the same type of self-deprecating humour...............there's actually THAT much self-deprecation that anyone would bother to listen to...........seriously, i have met VERY VERY FEW females who can hold their own in the area of humour............not saying im very farney, but jus saying, there are methods of humour that i think most women in singapore have not explored yet.............they are jus not creative enuff..............  so i find it really farney when i read that most of the contestants would impress guys most wif their "wit and humour"...................ironic isnt it.........they arent farney, but i find them farney.............ok lah..........they r farney, but not farney enuff...............

      ok........im cracking up..........jus saw this really really funny scene walking back to my place.........  i was passing my neighbour's place and he was washing his car..........with his girlfriend.........wat's so funny? well, normally it wouldnt be funny..........but this time, the girlfriend obviously had absolutely no idea how to wash a car........it was hilarious..........the lost look on her face was side splitting...........  i seriously do not know what the fella was thinking, asking his girl to help him wash the car........or maybe she volunteered to help...........den i think he's quite dumb...........either way, he's dumb...........yes, today im slamming a member of my own sex, ill slam the girl after this.............  Number 1 rule of washing YOUR car:  "NEVER trust anyone else to wash your car for u..........UNLESS the other person is a professional or u know he can wash cars REALLY well and has prior experience of doing so"  i mean how stupid can a person get to entrust his "limb", his "wife", the second biggest invesment of his life to inexperienced hands?!?!?!?  Number 2 rule of washing YOUR car: quite the same as the first,   "Wash YOUR car YOURSELF"  washing your car is spending quality time wif it........u have to thank it after using it, after all it ferries you evrywhere u go, it keeps u sheltered and makes sure u get home or to the hotel in time for that quickie during lunch hours........and it sits patiently waiting for u to finish your not so quick quickie.........and it is your trusty steed at the race track.........where man and machine become..........one..........washing your car is bonding, pple.............bonding..........  Number 3 rule of washing YOUR car: more or less the same as the first 2,  "Women in bikinis dun wash cars, they only wash themselves........no, they wun wax your car or anything of yours for that matter"  I seriously dunno how pple can find their cars clean after women in bikinis are done wif it..........they lean on the car, they rub themselves all over the car.........they dun use sponges to clean the car, they use their friggin breasts~!!! tho i wouldnt deny breasts are soft and.........nvm.........point is, women in bikinis do not do a good job at washing cars......they end up washing themselves in car shampoo...........now u know why such women have shiny skin, they use wash and wax car shampoos.........BUT let me say this, im not saying pple shld stop such services.............  ok.........final piece, SOME women cant wash cars.........they might know how to wash everything in the house, but they are clueless when it comes to cars.........i seriously dunno wat my neighbour was thinking..........maybe he thought he could get all wet and wild with his girl...........i dunno............u wanna get wet and wild? go take a shower together, that way u can get wet and wild all u want..........maybe she'll even throw in a free wax and polish after washing..........

      hmmm..........let's see what i have to gripe abt today..........nuthin really...........but while taking a bath, one of the age old un-answerable questions popped into my head.............if your wife and your mother were both struggling in the sea, who would u save first?  there have been many variations to this question........some even compare the girlfriend and mother...........which is a totally invalid question dat has a straightforward answer, save your mother first lah...........your girlfriend IS and only IS your girlfriend.............only when your girlfriend has become your wife.........then do u have dilemma........but what happens if u apply the question to your girlfriend AND your wife?  well...........think given such a situation, i doubt the man would save either........he would just find another woman..........reasoning? simple, claim insurance for wife's death, loose the extra burden of supporting a highly traumatised girlfriend who will probably in the end want u to marry her jus so she can have access to the cash u gained from your wife's insurance..................basically, wiping the slate clean and starting all over again........and with the extra cash too...........or, he could tweak it alittle...........save the girlfriend, marry her, buy insurance again, find another girlfriend...........throw both of them in the sea again.........  ok lah, that's a sadistic way of thinking..........but this stuff makes for good soap opera plots.........  anywayz, on to my answer for the age old question of who to save first........wife or mother...... given my upbringing, i think i would save my wife first.........and try to go back for my mother......... reasoning? my mum wouldnt let me jeopardize my future for her..........awwww..........so sweet huh?  ya........think most mothers would expect the same, except maybe for those who dun get along well with their daughter-in-laws.............well............in such cases, i would think the mothers were the ones who threw their daughter-in-laws in the sea in the first place..........den decided to jump in too..........y? cos they wanted to make sure their daughter-in-laws really drowned........and then they would drown too........to escape the death penalty.........

      today, im gonna gripe more abt women..........women drivers in particular............. what do i have to say abt them..........well..........not much............jus that they are a hopeless screwed up bunch and should not be allowed on the roads for the safety of other drivers..........they are a danger to themselves, other drivers male or female.............basically, they suck.................they suck ALOT..............  my encounters with them number in the millions...........and today, cos ive had one too many shock from them, ive decided to bring up some incidents.......and SLAM them...........who's not happy? dun read lah, my blog leh.............  first off..........dunno if i have mentioned this before, the encoutner wif the carebear honda fit female driver...........one would think that a carebear owner would probably exercise more consideration for others.........i was following a few car lengths behind this honda fit that had tiny carebears decorating the rear windscreen..........and we were slowing down to exit the PIE.............we were braking lightly also.........and our dear carebear freakazoid decided to brake HARD........for what reason, i dunno.........maybe cos ants were crossing the road or she suddenly had stomach cramps..........i think it was bcos she wanted to me let me get up close and personal with her carebears..........well........i would have really luved that, but there's one tiny little problem...........my car got jealous and tried to strangle me wif it's seat belt..............crazy carebear freak........  the next incident wasnt so traumatic...........but it was highly un-nerving.............i was following this new volkswagen beetle...........and the new beetle has a big rear windscreen.............and i could see into the cabin and what the driver was doing...........now this is the interesting part...........guess what the driver was doing..........she was talking on the phone...........looking at the rear view mirror...........not to check the traffic, but to adjust her hair...........and she was driving..........normally, this wouldnt be so un-nerving...........but there's something different here.......... 1. she was holding the phone on one hand........ 2. she was looking at the rear mirror and doing her hair........with the other hand...... 3. she was driving.........with? no hands~!!!!! wtf!?!?!?!??!  then there was another incident..........this happened abt 2 nites ago..........happened to my fren actually......... my fren had stopped in a carpark to drop off 2 others..........and after the 2 fellas got off the car, guess what happened.........a female driver decided to try and matchmake her little hyundai accent with my fren's car door........ she was reversing out of the parking lot and banged into my fren's passenger door........... it's ridiculous~! there were 4 girls that car~!!! 4 pairs of eyes couldnt see there was a car stationary behind them~!!!! and never mind that, what was she doing in the first place?!?!? was she even looking at the rear vie w mirror when she was reversing out?!?!? oh i know..........maybe they were too busy talking abt how much their husbands love them or UNsatisfy them enuf.............my god...........how blur can they be...........  really, women drivers are terrible..........sometimes i thank god the automatic transmission was invented..........if not things could be worse due to their indecisiveness..............picture this.........  a female driver approaches traffic light.........she is quite a distance away, then she thinks,   "should i down shift? maybe i shld stay in this gear........wat gear am i in?" *looks at gear knob* "i think im in 3rd gear. shld i downshift now? nah, no need lah............maybe i shld downshift? oh no, it looks like it's gonna rain, did i leave the windows open at home? shld i start to brake now? but i haven't downshifted..........shld i downshift? mayb i shld call a fren and ask.....who shld i call? dun wan to call dear dear leh, later he think i cannot drive.........shld i call xxx? i wonder how she is wif her new bf..........he's quite nice actually..........wonder if she'll wanna swap swap for fun..........oh no, my hair is messy.........." *looks at mirror and adjusts hair wif one hand* "ok, think ill just brake......"  and guess wat..........she does brake, but forgets to clutch in, and viola~!!!! ENGINE STALL~!!!!!!! and nvm that, she stops and STALLS 100m away from the traffic at the light..............so she restarts the car and tries to move off again.....but the car stalls AGAIN~!!!! go figure...................  ok.....so ive said abit more than "not much"..........who cares........it's my blog..........but to be fair to the ladies, i think there are some who make really good drivers..........just that ive not met any yet.............and not all are of the type ive mentioned above...........

      i have come to a conclusion y singaporean women are terrible international beauty pageant contestants...........yea, they are beautiful, but jus not gorgeous...........the finalists from other countries on the other hand are jus absolutely  G-O-R-G-E-O-U-S.....................and the next thing, their smiles...........it's like they stuck scaffolding and support beams in their mouths.........it's so damn fake.............and never mind the fake smile, their answers to the questions........have improved over the years, but still...............sigh..........i feel sorry for the comperes actually, they probably want to laff their guts out, but cant...........and have to tahan for 2hrs.........

      was surfing ard jus now and found some other blogs by singaporeans..........first of all, can i say that i dun understand pple? what's wif the pictures and stuff? makes the whole blog look so cluttered.............so cluttered it hurts to even look at the damn blog...........but there are some nice blogs around.........nicely done up, a few pics and nice colour coordination that doesnt make a reader feel like he/she's stuck in a 60s-70s psychedelic timezone..............want an example? u know my answer.........heheheheee...........for the uninitiated, make a guess when i say there's only one good blog in the world........mine lah............  jialat, this blog thing is getting outta hand..........but farney how blogging has a role in my life.............there's a cycle........evrytime when sch closes, this blog is relatively untouched and not updated...........but once sch reopens i start to pay more attention to it...........and as the exams grow closer, i update it more and more..........once the exams are over, the cycle starts again.............kinda like other guyz having sex...........dun get it? if u r female, i pity your guy, pls delay your orgasm faking, he needs relief............

      everyone, it's april fool's..........so let's all sit down and reminisce on all the jokes played on us today.......... 1. my car heading towards the guardrail at 100km/h at "99 bend".........that was a close one.........phew 2. changing to the spare tyre after the puncture, only to find that the blardy thing's too small............. 3. realising it was april fool's day when more than 3 quarters of it was over.........  think this april fool's is the most eventful in my 23yrs of life.......... and before i end, would like to mention, last nite another man passed away in an accident on the ECP........and i might have joined him too..........cant help but feel there was some connection btwn the 2 incidents...........i dunno who the man is nor his family, but in my own way, i offer my condolences and thank my lucky stars............

      alrite, here's something to ponder abt...........it's abt why pple steal..........y'know, snatch thieves and burglars and robbers and whatever lah.........  i was watching the news yesterday and they were doing a report on newly installed cctv systems in housing board lifts.........evidently the systems are helping alot and have caused a drastic drop in snatch thief crimes..........well, from the thief's point of view, u would think, y not jus use a ski mask?  well, this is where my "something to ponder abt" comes in...........y do pple steal things in the first place? i think cos it's mainly they r in need of money.........duh..........and if they are so in need of money that they resort to stealing, how do u think they can afford a ski mask? considering ski masks prob cost alot in singapore, why? primarily cos bukit timah has no snow...........and even if it had, the ski masks would be too expensive.....why? cos fines are the greatest deterrent to singaporeans...........so pple cannot afford to pay for equipment to commit crimes~!  and then u would think, y not just use stockings? dun u think it would be weird for a guy to walk into a female garment shop and buy stockings? only to later put them on his head? and if he had no money, would u think he would be stupid enuf to use his girl's used pair? either they stink like nutz, or there are too many holes on them..........well, maybe if they r desperate enuf..........and also another thing, men do not know how to wear stockings, on any part of their bodies.........they'll probably cause a tear in the stockings..........and frankly, the stockings dun seem to help much in the cover and concealment department...........y do women use them? cos it's fun for men to take it off them~!  den y not use socks? ok..........but like i said, if he needs to steal from pple, i dun think he owns a decent enuf pair of socks that will cover his face at all, there are probably holes all over the sock.........and he probably hasnt washed them for months, so he might not even stay conscious enuf to commit the crime..........and even if he managed to steal money, he might jus faint before he can get away.............or he'll need the money for treatments at the national skin centre..........  and the moral of the story here? ya, other than dun steal..............use underwear, not footwear...........that way u can double up as a pervert too so when u eventually get caught, u'll have a longer term in jail and wouldnt need to worry abt food and lodging longer..........duh

      well, today has certainly been eventful..............yesterday rather.............i almost buanged the car again...........while going thru "99 bend" thank god i didnt............managed to escape a disaster..........thanks to my skillful driving i might add..........all i got was a grazed bumper and a punctured tyre..............y the tyre punctured is still a mystery though.........cos i grazed the rear bumper, but the front tyre punctured........think it was due to the tyre overheating...........anywayz, im not going to question too much, i thank my lucky stars nothing worse happened.........  and things might just turn out to be a blessing in disguise...........the tow truck guy happened to own a workshop that sells pretty inexpensive and good suspension, good option for my future upgrading plans.............and also luckily my parents are out of town.........so i can get the car back in shape before they come back...........phew.............  things were kinda weird actually..............after the incident, i was afraid it would be one of those, "oops i did it again" things, but after getting out of the car and inspecting the damage, i almost collapsed in relief.............  this doesnt mean im not going to attempt "99 bend" and "portsdown" again...........im still gonna keep trying them.........until i get them right...............and then, there'll be "upper thomson"..............one day, i will conquer all of them..........but first, the punctured tyre..............

      it's the 3rd day of work, and i have done 3 days of OT........ not complaining much, but my legs arent exactly wat they used to be....anywayz, job's not that bad......jus the lousy stinking space suit.....otherwise, quite alright..... get to watch nubile young things moving around of course good lah.........  anywayz, saw this nubile young thing sitting listening to some fella talk at a workstation today.....she was resting her chin on one hand and was giving her undivided attention to the fella......when i say undivided, i mean undivided.....for at least an hour........in the same pose.........think at the end of it all, the guy would probably have an ego the size of the factory.........  yea, maybe im envious of him......but im still gonna have my grapes and eat them....sour or not.........  errrmmmm..........anyone noticed how great jasmine trias looks? pity she lost.....she's the type of girl that most guys wouldnt bear to hurt........and boy can she shake dat....errr..........do the hula........  last one, reading my blog may suck but u've got this far so grin and bear it.......  on an episode of everwood, it was mentioned that a woman has certain desires to be held tenderly and also to be ravaged all at the same time......errrr......i dun get it......not that i need to, but women puzzle me in case u havent noticed......it's like they want the whole cake and eat it.........im sorry, i can only have one......... anyhow, i like the ravaging part.......it sounds......fun........  errrrrmmmmm..........this does not bode well.........nubile young things......ravaging women.........i need a cold shower...........

      well......finally got a job for the hols.........and work started today.....and yes, i got lots to gripe abt........  job involves installation of some cabling and stuff........in a wafer fab plant........ i.e. we gotta wear some sorta de-con suit while inside the factory.......  this is the first time ive been in a wafer fab plant.....and it really looks like one big slumber party except there arent any beds or mattresses......and u cant tell who's who......which is really quite exciting........it gave me an idea for how to hold a swingers party.........  at the beginning, the whole space suit thingy was pretty fun.....one minute i felt like i was in a slumber party, the next i imagined myself as a space man.....then it turned into a de-con team working on a major epidemic.........den after dat, i imagined i was in a sauna.....and after dat......i jus got damn bored and annoyed wif the suit......and to top it off.........dat was only 10mins into the day.........  so wat to do? do wat i do best........pple watch.........  i noticed alot of nubile young things working in the wafer fab plant........but being faceless and shapeless.........i could only observe their demeanour......which was equally interesting..........then there were the not so nubile young things that walked and acted like a nubile young thing........interesting still......  maybe the SDU should conduct their functions in a wafer fab plant........evryone would be faceless and evryone would be able to interact much better......all u see are eyes, hear voices and feel each other's mannerisms.........NAH~~~~ ill be the first to tear off my partner's de-con suit and see how she looks........  face it pple, this world we live in is realistic........9 out of 10 times, a couple is first attracted to each other or one to the other based on looks........  but seriously tho, it would still be nice if we could block out that part of the brain which evaluates aesthetic appeal......alternatively, we could all live in a wafer fab plant......

      First thing to get out of the way, don't ever try using mouthwash in the mornings and then have a glass of milk........rinse your mouth thoroughly before drinking anything mild like milk..........coffee and tea or water is ok........but do not, i repeat, do not drink milk after using mouthwash.......you'll realise what plastic tastes like......  and on to the maintain topic of today's post......The Great Couch Potato Revolution.  im proud to say that i am an avid supporter of the greatest revolution that has ever taken place in the history of mankind.....which revolution has ever matched one of this scale and this cause?  The Great Couch Potato Revolution is all about the wide spread and on going acceptance of the pple's acceptance of the greatest invention in history - the remote control.  i strongly believe in the many uses of the remote control......or rather having everything controlled remotely......y shld i even have to spend energy walking up to a tv set jus to turn up the volume jus a little bit more? y shld i have to get up to get a drink from the fridge? everything should be accomplished by merely a thought......accept certain things tho........sex and driving......and even then, viagra could be digitized and women's libidoes can also be remotely controlled.....the nites are gonna be longer but no longer cold and lonely........  but think abt it......arent we all heading that way? not the crazy sex thingy.....  yea, im just a lazy pig......but arent we all that way now?

      caught Troy last nite.......was quite interesting........though the battle scenes arent as good as those on LOTR.........but the fall from grace of pretty boys in the movie makes up for that.........i think Orlando Bloom might just lose many fans after the movie......and Brad Pitt......he dies and i loved every minute of his death sequence......Eric Bana? he's no pretty boy cos the incredible hulk isnt pretty unless u have a fetish for spinach green skin.........  anyone ever noticed how each movie has it's own weird obsession wif something? like for LOTR it was abt calling each other "my love" whether male or female.....in Troy, the characters are obsessed wif staying home and shagging their women.  NOTE: they used "make love to their wives" but the characters in the movie do not play "Monogamy" but they do play "Monopoly" wif the women of the country as commodity....  which leads me to another thing........anyone ever thought abt how people in ancient times practiced contraception? especially since slavery and prostitution are age old practices......well, i remember reading something abt how they used sheepskin as condoms...........  now we know why they have to start cloning sheep.........  anywayz, i realised that ive been having pimples for at least 9yrs......i cant believe it.........then i decided maybe it's time for me to start another assault on them......so off i went to buy some benzoyl peroxide (i.e. pimple cream) to smack on my face.........and i found out later while surfin thru the net, benzoyl peroxide is also a bleaching agent........considering the amount of it ive dumped on my face, im starting to wonder how much acne michael jackson had more than me......

      was originally doing this post before dinner when i got interrupted for dinner.....so i decided to lay it off till after dinner.........im so smart it hurts sometimes.....  anywayz, why izit that channel5 shows really crap shows during the period before and after dinner? channel I gets my vote for best dinner time programming with all its sitcoms.........alrite, the baby of singapore's family of tv channels scores~!  on to other things.......i think im losing my mojo.....again......i cant seem to find anything to write abt.....again.....this jus sucks......it's like turning 50 and losing your libido.....but then again......like i said, balance........u gotta lose something in return for gaining/keeping something.......im most probably not losing my libido so losing my mojo is gd.........  btw, im thinking of starting like a "Hot Babe of the Week" thingy......if im gonna talk abt girls, im gonna need to show some flesh around here......not mine.....

      think i might decide to move into the living room permanently.......jus imagine this, JBL sound system, 29in TV, a nice big fan (sorry i dun really enjoy aircons), a laptop, a sofa bed and the ultimate must haves in any luxury living room - remote controls.....wat more can i ask for?  anywayz, was flipping through the channels just now and finally settled down with Yan Can Cook on channel 5.....yea, not exactly THE choice of tv programmes but im not picky...much.....  wtf is the bugger still doing on tv?!?!?!? oh, i forgot, these are re-runs.....frankly if u ask me......the fella is one big hoax......"This is very easy to do. Anyone can do it."......yea, sure anyone can do it.....dat's y u no longer have a tv show in our singapore tv schedule.......and it just occurred to me that chefs on tv really have it going for them......i mean think abt it.....they can teach pple how to make great dishes on tv and not worry abt getting bad feedback.....y? they could just simply say, "u didnt do it rite." it's all too subjective.........so u see, martin yan is actually one smart dumbass......  was reading a blog maintained by a certain Germany obsessed chick......and after reading her blog for the past wk, ill say one thing......"It's ok Chok Tong. You can't convince everyone."  not trying to put her dreams and aspirations in a bad light or anything....but i really wonder how many pple out there are the same as this SPG-to-be........and the more i read her blog, i realise how stuck onto her dreams she is, whether Germany's in the picture or not......which is good cos she has conviction.....and yet in a certain way too idealistic for comfort......then again, i remember being idealistic too.....  there is a certain thing that really concerns me......leavers are gonna be one pretty sad bunch......i'll bet that amongst all the reasoning that the world is their playground and that their hearts are still in singapore or whatever bull they can come up wif to try and justify their leaving their homeland, they still know deep down inside they have in a way, betrayed their home.......and become pple wif a lost identity....  back to the topic of the sourcrout obsessed blogger, ill just say one more thing......her future boyfriends might have some inadequacy issues to contend wif.......yep, for those who have followed my blog, u should have known this was coming.....

      jus got home from a nite of clubbing.....how was it u might ask......i guess hot and steamy might be appropriate......the club was so packed, it was suffocating......all anyone could breathe was just hot air........anywayz, was already expecting such a situation in the first place.....mambo wednesdays are known for the exchange of bodily fluids and heavy breathing and less of the dancing........  so y did i still go? it was mainly cos frens needed company......and i was eager to flaunt my new found prettiness......anywayz, there were 2 virgin clubbers to break in.....and i jus love doing such stuff.........tho next time i think ill suggest a better venue.....mambo wednesdays are considered baptisms of fire crowd-wise........  after swopping much bodily fluids and breathing heavily into the ears of girls rubbing themselves all over pple they were oblivious of including myself........i was the designated driver for the nite and had to send our 2 newly baptised clubbers home in punggol....they were pretty much stoned....cos they promptly knocked out during the ride home.....leaving my co-driver and myself to find our way back........which we unsuccessfully did for a full 1/2hr..............  but then, driving ard the punggol/sengkang area at 3+am in the morn isnt dat bad......i always enjoy a nice change of scenery every now and then......tho i think the 2 ladies in the back preferred the familiar scenery of their own beds........baptism of fire.....they were fried to a crisp..........

      Greetings from a foreign location~! my living room....... yea, using my mum's notebook while watching cable tv in the living room.....it's so convenient to have a wireless connection dontchathink?  Well.....got a new look to the blog....even thrown in my profile on the side there. Now just have to throw in a list of links to make it more complete.....was getting fed up trying to alter the code of the old format.....so thought it was time for a change....  got tired of titling the prev 10 posts jus so the sidebar looks nicer.....you can see the spoils of my efforts.......ill jus post more during the next few days to do a cover up job.......  anywayz, just wanted to drop a post regarding new findings in regards to the female anatomy.........think those who caught the jacky wu show on channel U last nite will catch my drift.........trust me, my reaction is probably jus the same as any other hot-blooded male who caught the show.......as of now, im still having goose pimples.......for those not in the know, imagine a girl with breasts the size of your head.......ok lah.......dat's exaggerating.......but she was a freaking H cup~!!!! she could suffocate a man with those........she's the stuff that men build their fantasies on and a woman's worst fear......  my first thoughts of it (or them if u rather) are unimportant....cos i couldnt think....but "WTF?!?!" was all i could think of after dat.......and of course i realised her future husband would only need to buy pillows for her........then he'll just use god's gift to the world of men......yes, we have found the 8th wonder (wonders?) of the world......and im still feeling breathless.....no, im not indulging in any fantasies now.......  geez.....ball's in your court now britney.......

      well.....it's been quite a boring day.....except for some things....and nope, i havent remembered what i wanted to post this morn........  first off, blogger has finally come up wif a comments thingy for their blogs......abt time if u ask me........all the other blogging sites already have it......not providing such a feature is a bad business strategy...........so hopefully after this post, pple can comment on my posts........jus dump wat u wan at my posts......ill try to stay un-provoked shld it be unfair criticism.........  so on to the next thing.......dunno if i have mentioned this.....but ive recently found out my typing speed to be 58 words a min.........not bad huh.........yea......compared to fren's whose speed was 37........shows i got nimble fingers that can work miracles........ladies?  today, was on the way to meet a fren.....and decided to stop for petrol at my regular petrol kiosk........and the cashier was suddenly friendly wif me.......she's quite cute actually.........malay tho......but cute......so y was she frenly wif me today? i soon found out upon meeting my fren........  so off i went to meet my fren.........and while walking ard looking for her stuff, she mentioned i looked pretty.......yep........pretty......me.......pretty......  from now on, i reserve the right to be called pretty......women will have to be called handsome from now on.......  altho i do like to believe in my small little world that im jus absolutely hot and sexy everywhere, but pretty wasnt exactly the word i was hoping for.......in fact pretty wouldnt be the word any guy would be associated wif.........so that explains y the cashier was so frenly today........hmmm...........wat can i say......im just absolutely hot and sexy everywhere.....and too damn pretty to resist........

      ....... i forgot wat i wanted to post.  other things first then..... was surfing ard the net for other blogz to read....and realised nowadays pple like to post pictures of themselves......which got me wondering.....should i do that? at the risk of losing my fan base (currently numbering only one - me), why not splash a nice big picture of myself on the blog? yea, rite.....sorry, im not a picture-y person....count the number of pictures ive taken in my lifetime and u have the number of times u have contracted a terminal disease (i.e. 0 or 1)........  y? cos it's been my life long mission to be the next Man Without a Face.....nah....actually most of the time one of the next few things happen: 1. the photographer goes blind, cos im so good looking, it hurts. 2. a pimple bursts into the lens 3. the photographer is too short, she manages to get only my chin. (yea, notice how the pple who want take photos are mostly female? and how they are mostly shorter? at least in this place called SING-A-PORE)  i dun get it......was watching episodes 19-22 of the OC yesterday....and they were going around exclaiming how being able to take photos wif your phone is the autograph of the new generation...errr.....it is? oh it is! is it really? maybe it is......convince me...  lemme try and recollect wat i wanted to post and post later..... ohyes, I'VE GOT MY MOJO BACK~!!!! yea baby~~

      added more linkz for your viewing pleasure.........and for the guyz.....viewing pleasure does not necessarily mean porn..........yes, it's viewing and yes, it's pleasure but viewing pleasure does not mean porn........  errrr......suddenly i feel very self conscious...........forget the last bit on porn........  anywayz, thought of something weird that happened over the past weekend...... happened while i was bumming around wif my sis in her room.....she was using the computer, i was watching tv......when my father decides to gatecrash our tranquil state of boredom........  TV : *breast enhancement ad for post pregnancy mothers. pair of breasts shows on screen* Dad: *walks into the room* "Hey, there's this show about breasts and bras tonite rite?" Sis & I : *Are we his children?*  somebody tell me, how were we supposed to react to that?!?!??! and what kinda of reaction was he expecting from us?!?!?  Dad : *Leaves the room* Me  : "We have a problem." Sis : "I think he's bored."  seriously, how many guyz out there actually talk to their fathers abt ladies' undergarments let alone their worldly (would like to have used globular here, but it sounded weird) assets? i dunno abt the other guyz, but I certainly dont stand around wif my dad at a shopping centre going, "Look at those Pa. How do you think Ma's compare to those puppies?"  It's ridiculous~!!!

      well, since this being mother's day weekend, i thought i'll jus find something interesting to write abt...........first of all, did u know that the word 'penis' does not exist in the nokia handphone dictionary? at least it doesnt in mine.............and not only that, the word 'shit' doesnt exist either..............  how can such words be left out? they r used so often...........maybe not 'penis', but 'shit' is...............so how could nokia have left left out such words.........talk abt low quality control...........but if im not wrong, the word 'fuck' exists in the dictionary..............wat gives?!?!  and a few days back, i learnt that tau sar piah is also called tambun piah...........or tambun biscuit for the linguisticly impaired...........and no it's not pronounced as tam-bun.........it's tam-boon.............so tam-boon for the linguisticly impaired.........anywayz, yes, i think im suffering from an addiction to tambun piah...........everytime i walk into the kitchen and see the box of tambun piah, i cant help feeling the need to feel the soft crumbly melt in your mouth texture of the tambun piah..............  i guess im paying for my tambun piah OD episode.............my pimples are going cuckoo on me...........this sucks......so boys and girls...........what have we learnt today? too much of a good thing is bad..........but dat doesnt mean that too much of a bad thing is good either................  and finally, mother's day is 2mrw..............so i think it would be best not to use the phrase "son of a bitch" during these 2 days..............

      is it possible for a person to OD on tau sar piah? i think so..........and symptoms of OD include a sudden pimple outbreak of humongous proportions.........i guess this is what i get for finishing 16 tau sar piahs in one sitting..................but they r so delicious..................so irresistable...........so flaky........and they jus crumble in your mouth..............would probably have finished the whole damn box (32 in a box) if it were not for some self-restraint..............  think i would have done myself in by finishing the whole box.............as it is im suffering the consequences for 1/2 a box......and ladies, that small little dot on your face is a lousy excuse for a pimple...........compared to those im having now, yours is hardly a skin rash....................  though i think there's more to this outbreak than just tau sar piahs...........think it's due to the lack of sleep the past few days...............as a matter of fact, beauty sleep is very real for me...........seems like if i keep more regular hours of sleep, my face more or less does a mr hyde to dr jekyll flip in one of the nites.............really~!!!!  now u see my obsession wif trying to get a marathon sleep session going...............

      alrite...........here's something new to ponder abt while u are eating...............actually eating tau sar piah in particular.........basically it goes like this..........  we all know dat tau sar piah comes on boxes which have 2 or more layers of tau sar piah in them...........so when u start eating from the box, u have to finish the whole damn layer..................y? leaving one tau sar piah is the same as leaving none.........leaving a lonely tau sar piah in a layer to contemplate it's pre-determined destiny is just plain cruel and inhuman........so leaving one tau sar piah in the layer is wrong........it is the same as leaving 2 tau sar piahs to fend for themselves in the dark box while waiting for their timely demise....................dat's cruelty to pastry.............  then wat abt eating just one tau sar piah? well, dat's just plain cruel in more ways than one...........first of all, u will be causing needless worries among the other tau sar piahs............they might start fretting too much abt their one tau sar piah brother being thrown away into a dust bin and rotting his life away instead of ascending to tau sar piah heaven........and den reincarnating as useful fertilizers..................  secondly, and most importantly, we humans have a god given duty to dispatch our dear tau sar piahs as quickly and as timely as possible.............we owe it to them since they form the frontline in our war against snacking hunger..........lest our frontline crumbles and falls apart due to the harmful phenomenon called "lao hong".............  thus, is the reason why we mus think abt the food we eat..............tau sar piahs in particular.............

      ok...............this sucks..........but it's not to say i wasnt expecting this in the first place..........i am supremely bored...........yea...........it's that time of the semester again.............it sucks..........well............kinda expecting it really.........and this blog might not be updated that often already since there really isnt much happening ard for me to gripe and rant abt.........so it's a long wait until the next sem b4 i will have anything constructive to write abt..........  and yes, wat i do write is constructive.............while wat i do day by day is unproductive.............studying is unproductive........the only things it has produced so far are the pimples on my face...........which by the way has not let up despite the 'unofficial' end of the exams............in fact more have popped up...........literally...........think it's the lack of proper sleep.............but i slept 10hrs last nite~!!! tolong lah..............gimme a break from the pimples~!!!!!  here's a thought.......... there are many ways of exchanging bodily fluids btwn 2 pple...........and bursting pimples are at the bottom of the list........i wouldnt even call it exchanging fluids anymore..........duno if pus qualifies as a fluid...........

      no idea wat that title means......sorry lah, im too tired to think of titles esp since ive been keeping late nites for the past few days......nites....watever....  anywayz, popped in to blog alittle, since i have the time and have something to blog abt......  first off, Reagan's dead......pity though......first American president that i came to know of..........passed away due to Alzheimer's (too lazy to check my spelling)....always thought he was a nice guy president....then again, being below 10yrs of age means that most pple seem nice......  and my incredibly rich neighbour has gotten rid of his old Porsche Carrera......only to get a new Porsche 911 Turbo AND a Ferrari Modena.........that brings his total car count to 5... gives new meaning to 5 Cs really.........  think i might have come across a new discovery linking your own breath and facial hair growth........it seems that your own breath seems to stimulate facial hair growth....came across this finding after working in this temp job for 4weeks.......a person clean shaven can change into the clean suit and wear a face mask into the fab plant and come out wif a fair amount of bristle even after half a day..........  i shudder jus imagining what the nubile young things look like after a day's work.....  and it seems the......errrr...........fragrance? of your breath doesnt affect how much stubble that grows.........actually i only had the opportunity of testing one fragrance -garlic........havent tried other fragrances (i know it sounds weird but couldnt come up with another word)

      absolutely no idea y i came up wif sucha lame ass title for this post......was just too lazy to think of one........  without any relation to the movie watsoever, think there are times when a person can just dream too much and too far ahead.......so much so he/she can lose touch wif what they have at the moment and who they actually are.........  i love to dream.......i believe it's good to dream....it keeps you interested in your goals and it gives you extra spice when there isnt the usual salt and pepper in your life........but ive come across some frens who lose themselves in their dreams and jus become obsessed wif making their dreams come true with money being the pre-dominant dream.......these pple are just a blardy sad lot really......to them the term "friends" becomes just that, a term........friends become jus potentials for more business......pple change, sometimes for good and sometimes otherwise.....  on to other things, my results are out.....think most who follow this little tribune of my life should have known by now ive cleared all the subjects......and wif a bumper crop of grades too......my best harvest these 2 yrs so far.....thanks to the frens who have rooted for me........  finally, a teeny little bit of general knowledge, did you know guppies cant give birth if they are stressed? yea, my sis told me that.....something i dun get......i always thought giving birth is something u cant control......anywayz, stressed guppies get my vote for most constipated fish......

      been quite awhile since the last post.....seems i get less to write abt during the hols.....or gripe abt rather.......  anywayz, many things have happened.....ironic i complain that i still have nothing to blog abt........from guppies to work to clubbing and a heavy mind......exciting few days really......  well, my dad built a fish tank full of guppies for my sis......and he put it in btwn the both of our rooms....so evry nite, i fall asleep to the sound of flowing water from the pump.....not a bad way to go to bed, but i do think such sounds may be incontinence inducing.........it's nice though to have a fish tank again.....nice to see fish again instead of japanese carp that might look better on a plate......  work has been tiring....think i pulled a muscle...and thankfully no more nightmarish run-ins wif nubile young things........else i might pop a vessel too.........  and to top off the list of exciting things, i have finally done something that i never thought i would ever do......visit a gay pub......and to tell the truth.......matters of such happiness never really seem to sink into you until you actually see it for yourself........i walked into the pub, and i the first thing i managed to focus my attention on, was a couple kissing......go figure.......i left after a drink......  my results are coming out amongst other mind intoxicating matters.....scheduled on friday.....but could be out 2mrw.....doubt any1 looks forward to such things........but better sooner than later.....and get it over and done wif........jus hope it will turn out ok......

      Not really end of the wk yet, but i guess it's just abt it......... alot's been going on in the past wk, and i am just so glad im off work.........otherwise things would have been&nbsp;pretty messy...........  the beginning of the wk was a whole muck of feelings...........anger, fear, frustration, sadness........sorrie lah, nuthin happy to feel..........as i once told a friend, i had forgotten how taxing it is to feel so strongly for someone.............yea, but good or bad....i loved every minute of it........it's nice to feel again..........  i felt angry at how certain&nbsp;influences in this world has robbed me of one of the most important&nbsp;persons in my life........i felt frustrated bcos i could only watch hopelessly as&nbsp;she struggles and i cant do nutz.........i felt scared cos i&nbsp;might not&nbsp;always be there if she got hurt.........i felt sad cos these 2 mths has ended...........but im thankful for the memories.......thank you  then again, i guess for now she has to walk on her own..........see how lah, at the end........  the new semester is starting soon.........so, time to frame up the old slate and bring out a new one so life can work its wonders on it again..........  so yea, there's a new season of the bachelor coming up............

      this marks the beginning of the final wk of my hols........school starts on the 26th......and wif it starts a new chapter in my life and perhaps for others too......... &nbsp; it's been quite an interesting 2 months..........ups, downs, everything all compressed into the&nbsp;nice short span of 2mths.........at times, i wish things would end differently...........but yea, reality bites........dun feel like typing&nbsp;much now.........will leave the whole chunk till the end of the week........ &nbsp; sigh &nbsp; thinking of starting a new blog.........at a more feature packed host.........

      i have 2 topics im just dying to blog abt.....time to get it out of my system.......  first off, it's abt spidey......everyone knows that he shoots webbing from his wrists rite? yea, it's also a well known fact spiders do not produce webbing from their limbs.....and no, they dun produce webbing from their mouths either......  they do it from their butts.........so how come tobey maguire aint swinging thru the streets of new york hanging by his ass? would be quite an amazing feat and spectacle to aim and shoot webbing at a target using your ass........ yea, then spidey would have to mod his suit to those kiddie pyjamas with a butt flap.....  next up is a topic on rulers......it occurred to me that the measurements we use today might not be accurate as compared to when the first time a ruler was made......there is the existence of human error.....and over time, the centimetre might not be a centimetre anymore.....

      actually came up wif some really stupid titles but they were not huh-worthy enuf......next time im just going to leave the blardy thing blank.....  ok so here's a post after a long hiatus...... i gather most pple have caught the new spidey 2 movie......and i think many would have noticed there is a certain similarity btwn it and it's predecessor......yea, kirsten dunst in a very wet dress......actually kirsten dunst's nipples were the highlights to be exact......  this topic came up at work yesterday......some of the guyz and i were jus talking kok and dunst's nipples came up......yea.......she might not be much of a looker in my book, but the nipples are definitely viewed as a crowd puller......all the guys agreeing wif this point say aye. aye~!  and of course, when there are guyz and the topic of nipples come up, breasts will definitely come next........and this is a new piece of information.....though i might say not surprising......regular stimulation of breasts will really help them grow larger.....as in, excited stimulated not massaged stimulated........and this was told to me by my colleague - a guy.......and by the looks of things, he has only passed theory.......practical haven taken......then again, looks can be decieving......he claims to have read it........ahhhh.........the power of knowledge.....  note to self: remember to mention this to significant other at the risk of having got to sleep on the floor.  note to significant other: u look great, pls dun make me sleep on the floor.

      i guess it's old news already that i have someone special in my life......yea, thanks to some runaway mouths.....would preferred to have broken the news myself actually......anywayz....life is better than it ever was.......and someone is definitely smiling smugly to herself just abt......now......  so on to more impt news...... wat is it abt females and hair plucking? my girl offers the explanation that it's a very good way to show affection and bond wif someone.......yea, i can agree more....but for a guy who is not accustomed to having his facial hair pulled out instead of shaved off, it can be an equally painful experience........  i guess it all boils down to the fact that physical contact and emotional ties are connected together......there isnt one without the other........and small little actions such as hair pulling (yes, it's hair pulling....or hair tarik if u would prefer) are great examples.......guess it would be safe to say that men tend toward the physical side of bonding, while women lean toward the emotional side........balance, it's all abt balance.........
