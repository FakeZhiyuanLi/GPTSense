      I wrote this just after a significant incident happened to me and alex. His ex girlfriend and alex talked - about their past. And sad as it may seem, the girl "realized" that the feeling was still there. She even said that it made her cry, reading the testimonials we made for each other in friendster. Wahoo. Talk about "prior claim" attack. She asked him if alex was happy with her.  Yes. He said.   I cried. But not because he said that. I cried because after that, she told her.  Yes, we were happy. But CJ and i are happier. I am happier with her.  That, i knew... I shouldn't give alex up. I was on the verge of giving way, after all, he loved her first - i thought. but hey, id i think about it... Even if i pains me to know that i've caused heartache to someone. If i give alex to her... ALEX WOULDN'T BE HAPPY WITH HER. Because she's happy w ith me. And it's not only him who's gonna be sad if i give way... I'd be sad too. Actually, i wouldn't know if life's gonna be the same.  Also... My family, alex's family... They'd be sad. I guess i've also learned to love his family, they love me back also. My family loves him too...   Our friends, all we had from them are support and encouragements... Could i afford to make them sad?  The price alex's ex girlfriend had to pay is priceless just to get him back to her - it's a whole lot of people's happiness...  I'm happy now, having a boyfriend who surely knows well the decisions that he makes. I'm glad he chose me.  DOWN TO EX-GIRLFRIEND MEMORY LANE by Cj de Silva  I was almost an ex girlfriend, although not exactly. It never became us. And I can say some of the blame should go to me, I’ve let him go. I chose my responsibilities over him. I got scared that if I take the risk of being with this guy, my life would turn into a mess. I got scared of something that’s not supposed to scare me – the future. And I’m never afraid to admit I regretted what I did. But I didn’t regret it completely, for if I didn’t commit that mistake, I wouldn’t be the better person I’ve become.  I learned a lot from it. I’ve grown up because of it. For a year, I’ve strived to heal myself. I’ve worked hard to make myself better, get up from the wreck he made me become. I’ve concentrated in making him realize that he was very wrong upon letting go of me that easy.   But that did not require me to be bad. I was never bad to him.  A year ago, I learned that he found the love of his life – the person he replaced me with, I thought before. I was bitter. I was sad. Yes, I love him still – that time (Let me clear myself). I wanted to claim him. I wanted to tell his girlfriend, “Hey, you know what, once, your boyfriend was mine!” But hey, it’s true he was once mine. But he’s not anymore.  I tried to face the fact he is not mine anymore. Even if I try really hard to be better than her, I will never be. Even if I try hard to put up a good fight, I’ll never win. She won. Or better yet, there is no competition to begin with. It would be very stupid of me to compare her to me. It will not matter if I am prettier than her, or if I am more sensible than her. What matters is, HE LOVES HER.  I faced it. Instead of being bitter and feeling like a loser, I tried to see my so-called defeat as an opportunity to change myself into somebody better. I tried to be happy for them. I tried to be happy for him, and for her too. I took out all the bitterness inside me, all the desires of gaining him back. I erased this prior claim that he belonged to me. I RESPECTED his choice. I RESPECTED her. I RESPECTED their relationship. I gave them my RESPECT whole-heartedly.  Although we (me and the guy) promised to be friends, better yet, the best of friends after the wreck we have been, I never treated him as my 911. I did not expect him to be there for me like he had been when he still “loves” me. I didn’t haunt him, even if I had feelings for him way back then. I gave him and the person he loves the peace they deserve. Duh, they’re happy.  I moved on. Yes, we (again, me and the guy) may have had a past I’d wanted to correct (but never can I). But it doesn’t make me credible of any crazy actions I could do to get him back. His girl does not deserve it. In fact, I should be thankful of her for making the “love of my life” happy. I should look up to her that she satisfies him. I should respect her because she does not look down on me because I was her boyfriend’s past love. I should be happy for her for she won the (former) man of my dreams.  Now, I am healed. I’ve fixed my life and made it happy, with the help of my friends, my best friends. And now, I am ready to love again. And I’m glad I have found one. Now, I am braver. I am stronger. And the love I have found right now, I can say, is very much deserving of me. The happy life my life has become after my first heartbreak is happier right now.  Remember: it is never good to be bitter. Move on. Be happy (even if you remain single or you find the person who’ll love you).
