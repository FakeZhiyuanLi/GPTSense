       urlLink    My Neighborhood, Seattle. Rob and I passed this house one day after the Folk Life Festival. There was a very old woman in the yard whose back was at an osteoperotic 90 degree angle. She was on her hands and knees, picking at something. Her hair was in a bun, but most of it had fallen into her face. Her eyes were rheumy and her face was drawn. When she saw us she became really embarrassed. Ignoring the condition of the rest of the house, she said, "My goodness, these weeds."  urlLink

      I'm cripplingly narcissistic and a horrible speller so I've been reading my posts over and over compulsively. I need to clear the air. The last entry was too snotty and punk rock. I'm not nearly that thoughtful or tortured a soul. It's a big goddamned front. I was playing at being overtly cynical because secretly I feel so giddily optimistic about where this blogging thing could take me. Artistically.   I imagine myself sitting down at a coffee shop somewhere while I pour over the constructive comments posted about my blog and, by extension, myself. The creative inspiration literally gushes out of me. This upwelling causes quite a commotion and I'm asked to leave. I cross the street to another coffee shop where I bravely churn out page after page of my novel, taking breaks only to finish my short stories and order more scones.  I'm immediately the talk of the goddamned town--all towns really. And then the imagining ends more or less and a blithe feeling of contentment takes it's place.  This is what blogging seems to do for me and it's awesome and I feel I'm definitely going places. Though once again in the interest of veracity, the delusions aren't new, just more frequent.   Oh and some kid told me my blog title sucks, so I'm going to change it. The first couple of words in this post should do.  'Kid' being a term I use for people whose opinions I respect and who have at one time or another criticized myself or my actions.

      Now that I've turned my full attention to blogging, concentrated the meat of my intellectual power directly at it's core, then turned that meat back inward upon itself, I've reached a startling conclusion.  I'm going backwards. I'll ellaborate.   I had an idea for a novel once, got the juices of the aforementioned brain-meat really flowing. Had it all stored up in my head, even wrote some of the important stuff down. It was going to be huge, had just read a bunch of Gabriel Garcia Marquez (LONG before Oprah!), it was gonna be massive. And it hasn't gone anywhere since. I had a tough time getting started, that was the problem. There was just too much to think about, I couldn't break it down.   So I backed off, decided to take it easy. I would start with short stories. And start I did, started roughly a dozen. Started some at the beginning, some at the end, some diabolically in the middle. I took those little morsels of story and incubated them until they were totally fleshed out--thickening them up without ever spreading them out to encompass a beginning middle and end. Vignettes are basically what I had, though even vignettes do something usually--the ones that are thought to have literary merit. So what I had were vignettes crystalized to the epitome of vignettehood and obviously, as stories they suck. I liked all the ideas well enough, I just couldn't finish. I'll let the Freudians pick me over for that overtly sexual symbolism, whatever. I guess that little vignette about vignettes had a beginning middle and end . . . and wasn't 12 pages long and dripping with angst.  Back on point I haven't written anything in a long ass time, probably because of this vignette thing.  Now I'm blogging, and that's that.    Oh and mountain-friend just reminded me that our high school English teacher told us there's no reason to use more than 3 periods in an ellipse.

      My friend from the mountain thinks "metabloggical" might be a new word. So I'm copyrighting it. Anything blog related gets lapped up like so much Gravy Train by so many pitbulls. Hopefully I just found my niche for reaping blog-related profits and this whole gruesome charade can end.  Be honest, like the recording industry and the film guys tell you, if you use my word, pay for it:  ...................... well I can't seem to figure out how to put a paypal donaton link in this thing . . . foiled

      Generally speaking if I'm not the first to do something then I don't like to do it at all. This is true of just about everything in my life that falls into the category of the zeitgeisty. Right, and if it's zeitgeist I couldn't be the first, you're right, go to hell.  I tried to keep a journal once, and failed. Always thought an online journal would be nice, as I spend most of my life on or near a computer, but doing anything constructive with a computer seems like a chore when all you do falls under passive and inane online consumerism or videogaming.  Then when Howard Dean made millions for saying nothing and giant media conglomerates started allowing their underlings to do the same that pretty much killed my desire to blog--and I also HATE that term.  By and by my constitution was rocked by the knowledge that a friend who lives at the foot of a mountain with 40 year old phone lines and an AOL dialup account has his own blog. If you knew anything AT ALL about me you'd realize that I decided I needed a blog too and fast.  Keeping up with most people (i.e. those goddamned Joneses) is pointless for it's impossibility, but I've developed a deep need to at least keep up with the Kromers (my family FINALLY got satalite a scant few months before they; my parents live only a few miles closer to civilization at the foot of a totally different mountain).  Luckily I already technically HAD a blog as I had signed up for one in the hopes of getting a free gmail account or something--this one actually.  It will probably be a lot of nothing: existential dread and the horrors of having a job that may be rapidly turning into a career . . . and probably some metabloggical ramblings on the nature of blog qua blog  . . . . oh yeah, that sounds nice

      God this is infuriating. The dipshit said this a while ago, but I just saw it again  urlLink here , headlining a very   anti-american   blog chronicling the dead from both sides of the war.    "The story of what we've done in the postwar period is remarkable. ... It is a better and more important story than  urlLink losing a couple of soldiers  every day."    Who said that? Representative  urlLink George Nethercutt  (R), the voice for my hometown in this nation's Legislature. Sickening.  That's not exactly the  urlLink whole context , and he surely didn't intend it to be that   pointed.   Regardless, I'm sure he meant what he said. This doesn't make him evil or a murderer, just blind to the fundamental flaws in the pro-war position.

      I was just thinking about this while drafting a longer blog. I want to one day be important enough to the world of literature, film, journalism, philosophy--anything, I'm not picky--to have my name   adjectivized.   I want someone to read someone else's work and proclaim it "  Baumgartenian  ."  Now that I think of it, one of my roommates in college put this seed in my head to begin with. His last name is better suited adjectification.  Ideally, I'd like this to be a positive adjective, something that commands instant respect. Looking at my body of work thus far, though, I'd be happy with it becoming a synonym for   urlLink overwrought   or  urlLink  tedious  .     "Ugh, X's new Y was so contrived it was almost Baumgartenian--though not as long and directionless. I wouldn't have been able to stay awake if the indulgent characterization hadn't made the bile surge at the back of my throat."   -- Some Reviewer.   Yes, that would do nicely

      Here is an expose on the  urlLink tactics  U.S. intelligence used in their attempts to break Saddam Hussein and locate the WMDs. It comes from  urlLink http://www.independent.co.uk/ , which appears to be a regular Brit newspaper--probably skewing to the left.  There's mostly real news, but some funny stuff like this too.

      I just can't put together a decent sentence tonight. This is disappointing, I had some pretty important stuff to devote way too many words to.   For instance, I think I'm the only person in the world that noticed  urlLink Phil LaMarr  is an extra in Spiderman 2. I'm sure you caught all the other cameos, including the loser Raimi brother begging for any bit part Sam would give him. Bet you missed Phil though.   This is probably only portentious to me, but if the least funny actor on a perenially underachieving  urlLink sketch comedy show  can sink low enough to&nbsp;walkon as an&nbsp;extra, then the economy is much worse off than I'd ever imagined. The producers of  urlLink Samurai Jack  and  urlLink Futurama  must pay their voice&nbsp;talent&nbsp;in&nbsp; urlLink play&nbsp;money .&nbsp;Look for&nbsp;Phil on disaster-bound mass transit, slack-jawed directly to the right of Spiderman as the web-slinger stops the elevated train from de-elevating.   I think I caused a tumult in the theatre, cackling as Tobey McGuire fought to save thousands upon thousands of people from doom. In my defense, I would have laughed without seeing Phil LaMarr, as Tobey's   trying really hard to stop this train   face looks just like a   wishbone passing sideways through the lower colon   face. Some acting coach&nbsp;should tell him that general exertion is a different face than a painful bowel movement.   If they were the same, weightlifting in all its forms would be a much more satisfying spectator sport.   I also thought I caught a  urlLink Stan Lee  cameo. An old guy with biggish hair and horn-rimmed glasses pulls someone out of the way of a&nbsp;hunk of falling building.&nbsp;I also thought I saw him at my cousin's wedding in&nbsp;Stockton, California, so take&nbsp;both sitings&nbsp;with a grain of salt.    Here's a&nbsp;heads-up. If you the only thing you like more than funk and fetishism is the crooning of Elton John, then you should buy or download the  urlLink Scissor Sisters . This apparently belongs to a sub-genre of music called perv pop, and I like it. It's&nbsp;what&nbsp;Sir Elton and Prince might come up with if they were locked in a room together with a gimp--only gayer.   I wanted to&nbsp;discuss all&nbsp;those things at length, I just couldn’t make anything come out funny. I’m as disappointed as you are.

      I've watched the DNC for a grand total of 18 seconds, long enough to see  urlLink Teresa Heinz Kerry  fight&nbsp;a losing battle with the English language. Her fight was much like the one I fight daily in this blog. It struck a chord.   That was the only thing that struck me, and the experience lasted 16 seconds too long. The other two are null because that's how long it took my brain to realize what I was watching. If I had quicker reflexes or even a remote control it could have been over much sooner.   It's an affront to my senses and an assault on my decency. It would surely make Ignatius J Reilly's valve close off forever. Of course, I'm not one of the > 50% or whatever of people who don't know what the fuck Kerry stands for. For these people the DNC might be useful.   The 18 seconds thing was actually a lie, I watched the&nbsp;NBC news broadcast before the start of the convention. The thing that struck me then was how jubilant these people were pretending to be. They were acting like John Kerry was some leftist messiah. He's not obviously. He's the defacto placeholder that is least offensive to the most people and therefore stands the best chance of being swept to office on the wave of anti-Bush sentiment. That's why I'll be voting for him.     You know you have problems connecting with voters when your running mate--that is vice presidential pick--has a  urlLink 24-point  higher approval rating than you do. I wonder what this guy's approval ratings are. He's Kerry Edwards. Look at that smile. Is he some kind of sexy African-American synthesis of the two men? Probably, and it looks like he's going to be  urlLink rich  soon. Maybe we should rethink our nominee.    Every analyst I hear spouts the same mantra: Kerry has to ignite the base. This is probably true, but unrealistic and a little unfair. Asking him to electrify America is as futile as asking the same of a lightning rod. He's no orator. He's wordier than I am. Don't be stupid  urlLink George Stephanopoulos . You have a giant head, use it.   I do feel a little cheated though, John Kerry actually excited me once. It was probably almost two years ago now. I was living in what passes for the  urlLink ghetto  of Spokane, Washington. We rented a big house with bars on the windows. The bars&nbsp;couldn't keep prowlers out of the gaping holes in the crumbling foundation. Luckily most of the foundation was obscured by&nbsp;hundreds of rosebushes, which inexplicably bloomed 9 months out of the year. It was an oddly magical house, and one that stank of cat piss.&nbsp;   The previous tenant's wife fell in with some sort of sex cult and had left him with four children and no second income. He was one person and could barely manage the rent. Later, we would be&nbsp;six people and&nbsp;would still&nbsp;barely manage the rent.   Needless to say, the poor guy had some shit on his mind, and forwarding magazine subscriptions didn't have top priority. He moved and got himself a more managable life;&nbsp;We got his subscription to  urlLink Men's Journal .   On the cover of this particular issue, August 2002, Kerry sat astride a Harley-Davidson in a fringed black leather jacket. He talked about interesting things, said that if he decided to run, it'd be nice if  urlLink John McCain , his&nbsp;buddy,&nbsp;would run with him. The Bi-Partisanism&nbsp;he hinted at in&nbsp;the article was kind of nice. He seemed intent on unifying the country. He took stands on issues, he was vocal and--though this might just be clever editing--he was concise. He seemed to have something approaching the charisma of Bill Clinton, which is good, as no one ignited the base like Bill Clinton. Of course, Clinton was also a  urlLink winner --which tends to fire up a group of consistent losers.    Granted, Kerry&nbsp;might have just  seemed  more promising.&nbsp;back then it was much less likely that anyone was going to have a chance against Bush. In those days I often found myself staring longingly at pictures of history's greatest murderer. Maybe my judgement&nbsp;was impaired.&nbsp;Thankfully though, the President has fucked up anything he's ever touched, and all the best spin in the world won't change that.    Quick question: when did beady-eyed  urlLink Joe Scarborough  stop being such a thoughtless firebrand? I hate this guy for the same reasons I hate Michael Moore, Michael Savage, Al Franken and Anne Coulter, though not as much because he's not as stupid as some of that group nor as loud an absurd as the three who aren't Al Franken. I meant that sentence to imply that Al Franken is just plain stupid . . . I don't know if that came across. Yet, here is Scarborough  not  spouting biased polemics laced with jokes that&nbsp;entertain like partial-birth abortions. This has to be a trick. He shows his colors a little more in that  urlLink previous link . "Hardblogger" is only a week old though, and those appear to be his only two posts, so time will tell.

      How does one develop passion? Is there a handbook? I feel like I’ve been deprived of a basic rule set of human existence. Certain parts of the game are unclear to me.   This is the shit 16 year olds worry about. Does being 23 mean that I’m behind the curve or that I’m hung up completely? I still don’t know these answers and I don’t know if I’m going to be able to recognize them if I find them.   I’ve seen Lost in Translation probably a half dozen times; it’s a movie that resonates strongly with me. I really only think I’ve seen it twice. I should watch it a few more times before writing something like this, but who has the time? I would, if I didn't waste so much of it.&nbsp;   Charlotte and I are similar characters. Red-headed philosophy majors with comparably sized breasts.   Like the best escapism, it starts by entering into a common dialogue with the viewers it affects.   We’re both awash in a world not our own. It’s all very sad and languorous. Familiar, that.   Of course Charlotte has the benefit of a jet set to spurn. They're trendy, insipid. They’re beneath her. Who do I have to spurn? Nobody. You have to be part of something in order to turn your back on it. Maybe I need a semi-famous spouse to become disillusioned with. Then I can spend weeks lying around a Japanese&nbsp;hotel room in my underwear. Maybe then I'll get some perspective.   She’s also lucky in that she has a loose three act structure from which to draw direction. Even if that direction is to be, for ninety minutes, totally without direction, it’s still something.   That’s the calling card of good postmodern cinema: the same weepy despair, the same lack of cohesion with the world at large, but in an exotic location populated by hip people with good hair.    Like Mark Ruffalo’s coiffure in  urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind . To . . . Die . . . For.    "I wish I was adrift in  that  sea of despair."    Like they say, the water is always blue-greener on the other side.   Truthfully I’m drawn to these kinds of movies because they find a way to authenticate the gentle, aimless loathing I feel and romanticize it at the same time. That’s the trick I’m increasingly unable to do without help. The romanticizing. I used to be much better at it. I think this means I’m losing my imagination. Maybe I’m just losing my youth.   One existentialist or another—pretty much all of them really—thought of birth as absolute freedom, a more or less limitless spectrum of possibility. It’s as close as you'll ever get to a point of infinity. There is almost nothing you can’t do—except, as the saying goes, pick your parents.   Then something happens. You make a precognitive decision, you spit up on someone's shoulder, your parents name you, you come out breach, whatever. You become imbedded in the world. A choice has been made, an event imposes itself on you, and that absolute freedom gets a big chunk taken out of it. All those things that might have happened if you were named George are fucked because you’re Cecil. Your freedom is narrowed and you can’t really get it back. Even changing your name to George won’t let you reinvest the Cecil years. Life is full of events like this, more and less important ones. More than that though, life is the  sum  of these events, all events, and that’s really it. It’s an inevitable move, from freedom to helotry. The thing that makes Existentialism the supposed antidote to the horrible crippling despair of determinism (evolution et al) is that you have an occasional voice in how your freedom is taken from you. That’s not how they spin it of course, but that’s what it boils down to. And that’s what sucks about modernism. On one hand, there may be no freedom at all, despite what you may think. That’s determinism and it’s probably the more frightening prospect. In the best case scenario though you only really get to pick the doors you get locked out of.   This is the new optimism and it sucks.   There’s no more transcendence--maybe we’re just realizing there never was in the first place. You can’t get freer.   There can be no transcendence without a god, but gods are pointless&nbsp;without humanity to worship them, and still it seems, no humanity as we define ourselves without at least the idea of transcendence—the idea of freedom. So which came first? That seems to be the crux and crucial difference between all world views, religions and whatnot.   Which came first?   Either a god created man and implicit in that creation comes transcendence, or man created transcendence and needed a god to work out the logistics. This seems to be the real trinity.  Even the existentialists wanted transcendence, and got as close as they could get to it.   Does this have something to do with my lost imagination? I don’t know anyone who isn’t a goddamned liar who thinks they’ve become more imaginative with age. Does imagination fade as a matter of course or as a matter of survival? Who wants to be the guy that can extrapolate all those lost opportunities? I couldn’t get anything done if I could see past the countless doors that have closed on me. At the same time, can you think of a better way to describe transcendence? Seeing through closed doors? Isn’t that just imagination? Is that all we’ve got to raise ourselves up? It makes sense in this context to think of imagination as the most transcendent part of ourselves. And we lose it.   What does that&nbsp; say about the ability to attack something with passion? If passion here means “ a strong liking or desire for or devotion to some activity, object, or concept ,” then how do we come to be devoted to an object or idea? Do you just get whittled down until there’s only one thing left to occupy you?   Does that then become your passion and the thing you pursue? It’s bleak but I can’t really get my head around anything else.   So then, is it good that I don’t know what I want to be good at? Does that mean I’m more free? Or am I just hobbled by indecision, by a lack of clarity?   Sometimes it feels more like the latter. Other times it’s the former.   One thing I think I’m sure of: passion isn’t archetypal, it’s contextual. As Charlotte loses the only thing she’s been passionate about maybe ever—and before she’s had a chance to really embrace it—you feel more hope for her than grief, like maybe passion is just a matter of stumbling through the right doors until you’re at the right place and time to meet the object of that moment’s passion. That’s Sophia Coppola’s big contribution with this movie.   And maybe that’s a better way of looking at the new optimism.   This reads like some reading response I would have written in college. It feels like old times. Maybe I'm transcending . . . or just remaining obstinately immature.

      I've discussed this with a friend and I didn't really make it known that shaky-cam has a place. For example Gladiator and Saving Private Ryan, despite how I made it sound, were  good  uses of shaky cam.  It also may have started more with Heat, which I don't remember really but  urlLink Michael Mann  has always done the handheld  urlLink Soderbergh  thing, so that's not so hard to believe.  The problem is that, as I mentioned, it's become zeitgeist. It's hip, so people use it in bad places.  Bad places like in a climactic fight between two trained killers. These men know what they're doing. I want to see them pick each other apart piece by piece. I don't want to hear an "oooof" and wonder if Damon just broke homeboy's knee or poked his eye out.  A carefully choreographed fight scene is wasted on shaky-cam antics. Granted the Bourne fight scene isn't meant to be Kill Bill vol 3, as it employs the same 'imperfection' that makes the rest of the movie so good. It's a gritty scene. Spit flies, eyes bug out. It's down and dirty. So maybe a little shakey is good. But when 15 seconds of&nbsp;a scene is devoted to Damon's spasmodically lurching right thigh I&nbsp;say&nbsp;"Meh"--regardless of how sexy that thigh may be. When even running down the street get's the shaky treatment I start to get annoyed.  It should be a tool to exploit, not a gimmick upon which to to build 120 minutes of film.

       urlLink Brian Cox &nbsp;does something for the&nbsp;niche role of the grizzled CIA mucky muck that I will measure all future clandestine bureaucrats against. Unlike so much that is wrong with action movies, and so much of what is right with the Bourne Supremacy, there's nothing archetypal about his character.   He’s not righteous in the face of evil. He’s not pure evil himself. He’s not a double agent.   He’s greedy, he’s out to cover his own ass, he seems tubercular. He has constructed a grandiose self-image to beat back his pangs of conscious. He’s human.   Brian Cox is never the star of any movie I’ve seen him in, but he’s usually the brightest spot.   It’s articulate characterization like this that makes the Bourne Supremacy work despite the annoying inconsistencies that plague all action movies.   There’s a part early on. This bugged the hell out of me; you’re going to think I’m crazy. Jason is in India, laying low. He’s got a bungalow, he’s got a cute German girlfriend, he's "off the grid",&nbsp;he’s living the life. Then Jason sees him, the guy he’s never seen before. This guy, Bourne knows, is there--in that country, on that subcontinent--just to kill him. How does he know this?   “It’s all wrong, he’s dressed all wrong, that car’s all wrong.” True, he’s white, has a sniper rifle flung over&nbsp;his shoulder,&nbsp;and it’s a gleaming new  urlLink Kia Optima . Way out of place.   That's just good sleuthing.   About 45 minutes later we’re following the CIA operatives at work in Germany. They’re acting very stealthily. They slink out of their hotel. They mouth something into their cufflinks. They have trench coats and don’t look German in the least. They nonchalantly look both ways before getting into their . . .  Chryslers ?   Here is where I ask the film makers to take advice from their own goddamned script. I know nothing about the spy trade, but I know that if I’m a German bad guy, and I see a half dozen suits get into a half dozen jet black Dodge Caravans, I walk the other way. I’m not exaggerating.  Dodge Caravans . The CIA field office in Berlin thought it better to ship a bunch of American-made minivans rather than buying a fleet of  urlLink CITROËN &nbsp;like everybody else.   A few minutes later, Bourne steals his&nbsp;German assassin friend's&nbsp; Jeep Cherokee .&nbsp;It's not enough that, against all odds,&nbsp;clandestine American operatives drive American minivans, but&nbsp;Director&nbsp; urlLink Paul Greengrass &nbsp;expects us to believe their&nbsp;German counterparts&nbsp;are driving American SUVs as well? There could be a unicorn wearing a monocle riding shotgun and we couldn’t get any deeper into  urlLink FantasyLand .   Right, Jeep and Dodge are all Chrysler, which is owned by Daimler, a German Company. But I’ve been to Germany. Number of Chrysler’s I saw there? Fuckall.   I understand marketing is an important way for producers to recoup the costs of making a big-budget film. What is unforgivable is letting product placement get in the way of characterization and common sense.   The other big problem I have with this movie is the cinematography. God how I despise the shaky-cam action sequence. I don’t know who started this. I think I saw it first in Gladiator, or maybe Saving Private Ryan. As much as I like him, Spielberg should be hung from the top floor of DreamWorks SKG by his flowing pepper gray hair until he apologizes for setting the frenetic, over-caffeinated, jiggle-tron zeitgeist upon an unsuspecting world. It’s not that I’m missing&nbsp;what the shaky fight scene is trying to do. I understand it's purpose: frantic realism.&nbsp;I like realism. But when I choose between realistic cinema and putting off that next grand mal seizure, I choose the latter.   I’m picking at these details because I liked the movie a lot.   I wanted perfection. In the end though, what I ended up liking the most was its dogged imperfection. Not the stuff above, that’s still just stupid. I’m talking about the problem that thrillers have of trying to attain total completeness. We’ll call it the Usual Suspects syndrome (see also: The Game syndrome). You take a convoluted-ass plot and three dozen characters you don’t think anyone will ever be able to wade through, much less wrap their heads around, bring everything to a boil, then drop the pieces one by one into the audience’s lap. QED. In the above two movies that was fun, and done well. In the deluge of films that have done it since, I haven’t been as impressed.   Luckily Greengrass doesn’t fall into that trap. There aren’t any epiphanies, there aren’t any archetypal struggles of good vs evil, Bourne never dangles above a tank of piranhas while Cox dictates his whole maniacal plan. These are all very, very good things, though I’m sure that most people will see a flaw where I see strength.   The plot wasn’t taught enough.   Taught and thriller appear together so often they’ve become synonymous. That bugs the hell out of me. There’s nothing taught about real life, even at it’s most thrilling. The pieces never really fit right. Screenwriter Gilroy seems to get this. Good for him.   There’s also a surprisingly great chase scene. All chase scenes have the good and bad guys slamming into each other. This one has the good and bad guys pinballing a third motorist between them pong-style. I also liked how, despite his status as uber-agent, Bourne’s driving isn’t perfect. He screws up, he gets tagged by oncoming traffic. He does some amazing things, but he also gets blindsided by a truck—not the bad guy’s truck.   As I said, comparing The Bourne Supremacy to Shakespeare is stupid. I’m with Comrade Snowball on this one: Each movie to the best of its ability. Don’t fault the retarded kid for not knowing how to read, it’s a good day when he makes it through lunch without choking on his applesauce.   The Bourne Supremacy made it all the way through second recess and back home for the day without losing its mittens or running off to masturbate behind the Special Needs Annex. As action movies go, that’s brilliant.

      I’ve taken two showers today. I’m not bragging.   The first was hurried, my girlfriend woke me up with a phone call asking me to come take pictures of she and her sisters for a photo album they are going to make for their parents. I was to meet them at Kerry park, about two blocks from my apartment, which has panoramic views of the Space Needle and Seattle proper. They were coming from breakfast. I hadn’t been invited.   I was however, the guest of honor at the  wake your ass up and come take pictures of us outside on the hottest day of the year party . I don’t get invited to many parties.   It was unbearably hot then, at 10&nbsp;in the&nbsp;morning.   The second shower, scant minutes ago, came after I spent several languid hours failing to avoid heating up the few cool pockets of air in my apartment. The project was doomed from the start.   It’s an unforgivable&nbsp;design flaw in the human mechanism that we should give off all this heat.   There are two engineers sitting near me. I know they're engineers because when I got here they were complaining about some flawed structural paradigm. They now seem to be talking about religion. They're discussing Christianity specifically. Both&nbsp;seem to be for it.   Maybe they can shed some light on this.   Christian engineers might have some special&nbsp;insight into how the  urlLink God of Love  could fuck up so badly. This is the kind of blatant disregard of thermal properties that engineers get fired for, they would know this. The problem, I'm sure, is seniority. They higher up you go, the more mistakes are tolerated because there are less people above you to piss off.&nbsp;  Being chief engineer of the universe probably affords you a mistake or two.    That  is a flawed structural paradigm.  It is doubly unfair that, of all human beings, I would give off the most heat--ever. This divergence from the norm&nbsp;can be expressed in powers of 10—in this case, 10 hojillion. This is what the conversion looks like: H (Luke) =[H (Normal Human) ] 10 hojillion . That's heat in watts, in case&nbsp;you're keeping track.   urlLink Weather.com  gives today a 9 on the sightseeing index. That sounds great. I feel like I&nbsp;should take advantage of that. I like to take the advice of indexes, especially when they're for something like sightseeing. The only&nbsp;sight I can see at the moment is the sweat beading on my forearm. Sweat has no business on the human forearm.   The second shower, then, was to try and recapture that old feeling of not leaking body fluids faster than I can replace them.   It worked, but not for long.   I managed to make it here in relative comfort, clinging to shadow, avoiding sunlight. I tried to look stealthy in a nonchalant way, which, to the observer, probably looked like drunken hopscotch.   Heat is bad for the way I'm percieved by others.   Heat makes&nbsp;men think it is a good idea to buy "unbifurcated garments"-- urlLink utilikilts . I'm sternly opposed to this.   Heat is bad for civilization.   Now I'm just rambling like an idiot. It's because of the heat.   There is a woman here sipping a shot of espresso with a  spoon.  The spoon is&nbsp;twice the size of the shot glass.&nbsp;   This is what heat does to you--makes you  crazy .

      If you have a few free minutes--and if you&nbsp; even happen to be reading this blog you probably have more time on your hands than necessary--you should read Ben Kromer's  urlLink maybe something good will happen . He's funny. His latest blog is a theoretical analysis of leftist and rightwing political strategy during wartime. All of this is simulated via Warcraft III on his painfully slow computer. His conclusion (if there was one) is "that I suck at Warcraft 3 even worse than I suck at life."   Ben reminds me that, despite all the people I see on TV, there are a few thoughtful, intelligent conservatives out there.   If not for a few friends who don't have blogs, I'd think the same about liberals, and libertarians for that matter. And on and on.   Mike Sheffler's  urlLink Cone of Ignorance , similarly, reminds me that math majors, though generally not to be&nbsp;seen with&nbsp;in public, can be interesting human beings and are worthy of our friendship--or at least interesting to put behind glass and study.     **Bonus points if you can pick out the sentence I stole directly from Kurt Vonnegut. This is getting ridiculous.

      I think I just had the kind of experience people refer to as epiphenic. I think I had an epiphany. It's 8 PM right now more or less; I got home from work around 4. I watched the Simpsons, made dinner, watched more Simpsons then read for a little while. It turns out I was reading the  urlLink best goddamned book of all time . Shannon wanted to go to a coffeeshop, and after our usual rigamarole I decided I probably did too, so&nbsp;I stood up. It hit me then.&nbsp;I didn't feel&nbsp;a trace of the shittiness I felt at work today, that whole period of my life&nbsp;seems really far away. There's a radical disconnect between my work life and my life after work.&nbsp;That&nbsp;is good I think.  &nbsp;  It also explains some things that weren't explained&nbsp;very well by my rambling sociological commentary of a few days ago. Like why I only&nbsp;feel pressed to get a new job whilst at my current job. &nbsp;  I think what put this contrast into such stark relief was what a staggeringly shitty day I had today. I mentioned that the bossman more or less read me the riot act in the passive aggressive way businessmen do business. Today he more or less hovered the entire day. Hovered around me. His desk is close to mine and he was probably just doing all the things he normally does,&nbsp;but all those mundane actions&nbsp;took on&nbsp;a sinister palor. All the things I thought were funny or quaintly annoying were now cunning devices of torture. His jokes made me want to put the sharp ends of&nbsp;pencils in my ears. His whistling made me want to drown myself in the toilet. He asked me, at one point, what I'd taken care of today; I told him. He replied, "Alright, keep going."  &nbsp;    No fucking shit   Rob  .  &nbsp;  I wanted to turn my lungs inside out screaming that. All I could manage was, "Okay."  &nbsp;  I think&nbsp;work today&nbsp;was&nbsp;just perceptibly worse than other days, but today&nbsp;I was forced to own up to it. I was good at this job once, and I enjoyed it. Now I don't, but not because I'm not good at it anymore. I'm not good at it anymore because I hate it. That makes this job&nbsp;the most torturous prospect I've ever faced. Bills make it worse. I have lots of them.  &nbsp;  Bills are the kinds of thing you get yourself into when you think your life is going to be great from now on. They're the kinds of thing that really suck when you realize just how bad your life has become. You realize how much you despise the thing that helps you pay your bills, which was also the thing you got the bills for in the first place. To have something to spend your money on.  &nbsp;  I have an apartment, a car, insurance for that car. I have a cellphone. I have loan payments from college. College helped me learn how to articulate all of this, and in a round about way forced me into the situation I'm now articulating my feelings for.  &nbsp;  Now I want to go back to college to better learn to articulate myself. I can only assume this will lead to a situation I'll despise even more but that I'll be much better prepared to articulate.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Right now I sound a lot like Kurt Vonnegut, who wrote the  urlLink best goddamned book of all time . This is why I don't think I'll ever be able to write anything. I end up emulating whomever I'm reading at the moment.  &nbsp;  I was going to write all about how my epiphany changed the way I look at my life. I was then going to explain exactly what that life&nbsp;was  really  like. I was going to use a lot of big words. I don't really want to do that anymore, so&nbsp;I'll say I feel bad when I'm at work, but when I leave, it's like I'm never there.  &nbsp;  I said before that I thought that was a good thing, but now I think it's the worst thing possible.  &nbsp;  Some kids in&nbsp;Middle school used to make fun of me every day for years. This made me feel like shit and I used to throw up a lot. Two or three of them were especially bad. Ten years later one of them asked me to be a groomsman at his wedding. I said "yes, of course." I became their friend&nbsp;when I&nbsp;started treating other people like shit.  &nbsp;  A similar thing happened in college, with similar results.  &nbsp;  I forget things too easily.

      I'm working on adding a few more thoughts to why I'm such a screwup, but there's been a bit of a snag.  &nbsp;  My boss emailed me last night. He asked me what he could do to help me increase my productivity. That's business speak for put up or shut up. So I guess this is the cosmos once again telling me something needs to happen. Either fake-happily do my job like I used to, or radically break from my circumstances . . . it'll more likely be the former.  &nbsp;  So I'll have to split my time between painstaking self-analysis and trying to figure out what this strange meter is supposed to measure and why the readout looks to be full of cod-liver oil. For that matter, why does this cautery transformer reek of burnt human flesh? Oh, right . . .&nbsp;that's what it's for, charring human flesh.

      My night last night: roughly 6 hours of Rise of Nations. Single Player. Tucked into my closet cum office space, the entire night I lead the English against the Romans then the Inca in an atemporal battle royale. I stopped to eat a little bean dip.  &nbsp;  I realized something profound about myself somewhere betwixt bean dip and bedtime--the kind of thing&nbsp;only really profound&nbsp;to the realizor I think--I'm not gonna go anywhere, especially with video games around.  &nbsp;  I do nothing all day at work except blog and bitch to my friends on Trillian about what a vacuous wormhole my life is.&nbsp; There  I get really&nbsp;motivated to do something about my goddamned existence but, you know, my hands are kinda tied because I'm at work.  &nbsp;  Then&nbsp; work is over and I more or less break for my car,&nbsp;eager to&nbsp;become an active participant in &nbsp;my life. By the time I've navigated the 520 parking lot (50 minutes for 15 miles yesterday) all I want to do is sit down and stare at something. TV would suit, but the fact that the syndicated powers-that-be have been showing nothing but old crappy episodes of the Simpsons the last two weeks quickens my retreat to the closet.  &nbsp;  As for the commute itself, I used to use that time constructively. I dreamt up a story collection that took place entirely on the freeway. People daydreaming their way into car accidents and whatnot, questioning how the human paradigm&nbsp;could've gotten so off track as to be a species of  commuters . This was before I had a decent computer. Now I just glare at the HOV lane, wondering how far I can get before a motorcycle cop comes roaring out of the swamplands and busts me--how close I can get to that first game of--whatever.  &nbsp;  To be fair to this state's  urlLink shit traffic system , upon arriving home, I'd still do nothing even if I had a chauffer and/or a rocket-propelled grenade to make my commute faster/easier.  &nbsp;  I think the problem is that I'm a very Pavlovian creature&nbsp;by nature. Like most people who have brushes with priesthood,&nbsp; urlLink Ivan Petrovich Pavlov  thought creatures were mere&nbsp;bundles of drooling reflex and carnal desire. I'm not sure if he extended this distinction to include humanity, but, in my case, he should have.  &nbsp;&nbsp;  The only time I have ever taken my life in hand is after some cosmic nudging. I so lack drive that I have to be  forced  to action if action is to be taken at all. Conscious attempts at action without&nbsp;this force end ignominiously. I have a history of not doing a goddamned thing, yet being adored by every employer I've worked for. Stimulus, response. Every time I've made a preemptive attack on the wheels of fate, I get nowhere. Stimulus, response. The jobs I  do  get just fall into my lap. Stimulus, response. Primitive, instinctual Luke learns from this and continues down this path of evolutionarily stable behavior. So&nbsp;it's a chicken/egg type of dilemma, but regardless of whether it's a cause or an effect, I am completely unable to self-motivate.  &nbsp;  Despite this knowledge, Luke the conscious agent remains naive, hopefull. "  Holy cow there are lots'uh things I'd like to do. There's a big beautiful world to be explored!  " Thankfully, Pavlov's Luke, the Luke of the cerebellum&nbsp;begins subconsciously working his magic. "  Yeah, big and beautiful. Well&nbsp;you can't have it, move along, nothing to see.  "  &nbsp;  Cerebellar Luke's got the right idea; Conscious Luke is iceskating uphill. This disappointment, this Carteresque malaise, is my stupid rationality thinking that transcending circumstances is something other than impossible. He thinks there might be a chance I could do something worthwhile if I'd just stop taking the path of least resistance. Like I said, naive.&nbsp;He looks at the results, has the wherewithall to trace them back to their causes, has the intelligence--for lack of a better word--to turn this into a more or less representative algorithm for Luke's life. He sees the narrative arc and still swings blindly against it. Unfortunately, Conscious&nbsp;Luke has control of emotions, and&nbsp;being constantly broken at the wheel of fortune makes feelings of sadness and failure&nbsp;happen.  &nbsp;   So&nbsp;this bloated, self-deceptive humunculus sits astride the instinctual cortices and gets mad. He tells them what horrible fuck-ups they are, cursing his luck to have been bound to such vile creatures,&nbsp;such automatons. "  You plod along;&nbsp;your dyadic reasoning lacks foresight  ," he screams. He&nbsp;continually explains their shortcomings&nbsp;on the off chance they will someday&nbsp;understand. His complaints are legion: They are guileless, lazy, they lack ambition, they fail to see the myriad choices that lay before them.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  They, of course, do their jobs well: processing stimuli, responding accordingly with hardwired, algorithmic precision. The problem is the new guy--the&nbsp;lumpy mass encased in bone, bobbing in its own juices atop the much older bundles of synapses. The new management. It doesn't know its place; it thinks it's better than it is, all powerful. It&nbsp;genuinely believes&nbsp;the random mutation that gave rise to it was somehow better than those that gave rise to the other hunks of flesh, each more or less suited to its own mindless task.  &nbsp;  This has always been the pivotal question for me. If evolution is going to work as a worldview, how do we explain consciousness? This isn't the freewill question mind you, I think that's a tertiary issue to the big problem. Evolution is the study of chance and advantage. It's like dungeons and Dragons. Roll the dice, calculate your survival traits, your short comings, your saving throws, etc. With all the handwringing, the self-doubt, the self-loathing, the crippling indecision, the arrogance, how can consciousness be a survival advantage? The answer, I think, is that it's not--not anymore .   &nbsp;  I read a book once:  urlLink A Primate's Memoir , by Robert Sapolsky.&nbsp; It's the most interesting travel memoir I've ever read, but has nothing to do with what I'm talking about. Another book of his,  urlLink Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers , is about the nature of stress from a neurological standpoint. I didn't actually read that one. I read a review about it that seemed comprehensive enough that I could put off reading it--probably forever. Basically, stress is caused by adrenaline and certain other chemicals that flood your system when you sense danger.&nbsp;It's good shit; it has the effect of nitrous oxide to a riced-out Honda Civic, making you run&nbsp;faster, jump higher, think more clearly. This is great if you're more used to being hunted than being hunter.&nbsp;With our poor locomotion and soft hides,&nbsp;we need all the adrenaline we can get.&nbsp;One of our novel traits, according to Sapolski, is the ability to  create the illusion  of danger and thus, to a certain extent, create all the adrenaline we need. We can take previous stimuli--previous brushes with danger--and project that forward, sensing danger where it  may be , rather than where it definitely&nbsp;is. That's consciousness, and it was apparently really good at keeping us from the jaws of tigers and whatnot and somehow helped us&nbsp;realize these fantastic cultural constructs. Kudos brain.&nbsp; It is also, though, responsible for a myriad of stress-related ailments&nbsp;stemming from the constant stream of adrenaline we jumpy humans imagine into existence. Eventually, being too good at anticipating danger breaks us down physically. The point at which this becomes what we would call diagnosable&nbsp;paranoia isn't really important because, essentially, it's all paranoia to varying degrees.  &nbsp;  All of which leads me to this conclusion. Now&nbsp;that we've effectively orchestrated an end-run around evolution--pulled out the weighted 12-sided die of civilization--all consciousness really does is break us down. It's harmful, disasterously harmful.&nbsp;We have ulcers, heart problems, crippling paranoia, insanity. We don’t have to worry about the jaws of animals anymore, only the brains of other humans. And it’s our own paranoid brains that are precisely the reason we have to fear our own kind. It’s us and the chimps--the only animals on earth who kill in cold blood. Do chimps get paranoid? That would be an interesting follow up, and might go towards an answer to whether unique ability in fact leads us down the equally unique and extreme path of preemptive slaughter.  &nbsp; Could it be that murder has something to do with a life lived in a state of constant fear? Michael Moore has made a career out of arguing there is. What would  urlLink these guys  say about it? What about the possible correlations with human expectation?&nbsp;Anticipating a narrative arc seems to be very similar to the act of constructing danger. Much like the adrenaline pumping mechanism, it is controlled by and subject to the interpretation&nbsp;of the big deflated grey Buddha-looking thing in our brainpans. So given the successes and failures that exist in my mind, the whiner makes judgements on where our life should be heading. It's this projection that has been bothering the hell out of me. The homunculus is&nbsp;tenacious in propping up his extrapolation, constantly nagging me to improve my position, to get my life where it "should" be. But at the same time cerebellar Luke continues to take the path of least resistance. The path of least resistance in this case, it seems, is placating conscious Luke. So at work I look for new jobs and contemplate my existence lackadaisically. Then once I'm free of the restraints of work, the easiest way for primordial Luke to get some rest is to shove conscious Luke in front of blinking lights and explosions.  &nbsp; The fact that I'm pretty good at videogames helps me feel like less of a failure. There is, though, a high turnover rate when you play games on easy difficulty.

      I just found out why the missionary position is called that. I'd wondered about it for years probably, but always been afraid to ask because I assumed it was some simple and widely known answer, or some culture-wide in joke I'd missed out on. I was probably wrong, unless most people are jokester Anthropologists:  &nbsp;      "In those days, face-to- face copulation was considered uniquely human, a cultural innovation that needed to be taught to preliterate people (hence the term 'missionary position')." &nbsp;--  urlLink Bonobo Sex and Society     That site is of much greater value than just answering questions of sexual slang by the way.    And on another note--one equally as revellatory--my boss told me he's doomed to spend his retirement in Florida, as all New York Jews, including 5 generations of his family members, are required to. It's nice to know that, for at least a select few Israelites, the diaspora has ended. It's kind of depressing, though, that God's chosen people should end up outside Ft. Lauderdale.

      With this revived interest in a journalism career and at the behest of a friend disguised as an anonymous commenter, I've been digging through my old Gonzaga pieces. Good GOD are the older ones wordy--yes much wordier than this blog. The more recent ones aren't as bad. Seems to be that the section I wrote for switched to an  urlLink Onion  format half way through the year so I had to emulate journalistic prose rather than just spouting poppycock--which is fine in private, but has no place in our society.  &nbsp; So I'm still on the fence about posting my articles here . . .  &nbsp; Oh but I have been writing a sociological&nbsp;treatise on why I'm such a horrible failure and why I'll never amount to anything. &nbsp; Stay tuned. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

      I've been sitting here for three hours spinning a pen cap trying to figure out how to break into journalism.   And by  break into  I mean write something that will somehow be published by someone.   I really don't know where to begin, and I don't think  urlLink AIBO  will be any help sniffing out a solution to this problem.   I'm crippled by what I consider my lack of a portfolio. The anemic bundle of bleached tree fibers amounts to two real articles, two real editorials and about 15 satirial  urlLink Onion -esqe articles and assorted commentary from my days as a newsie at the  urlLink Gonzaga Bulletin . Oh yeah, all the real articles were for the  urlLink Cheney Free Press --dunno if that'll work for or against me.   My big idea was to start small, stick with my roots. Living in Seattle I have access to shitloads more concerts than my fellow Americans in Spokane. Any act that rolls through Spokane more or less has time on their hands between the Emerald City and Boise or Missoula. SO, I write an article PREVIEWING concerts coming to Spokane based on watching a given band in Seattle. The best chance of landing this gig, I think, is through an independent spokane area rag (see:  urlLink The Inlander ,  urlLink The Local Planet ). Newspaper concert reviews are fundamentally flawed because they always appear after the fact. " Best concert ever huh? Tight, I'll have to catch them when they roll through again in 5 or 10 years."    My system, obviously, would fix that. I've already pitched this idea to some chick at the Inlander whom a friend (also working at the inlander) put me in touch with. The email went unreplied to. That was months ago, back when I kinda liked my job and wasn't actively think of ways to leave it and be self-sufficient. Things, like people, change. It's not me, it's you.    So I'm going after the idea again, but this time I want ammunition above and beyond what I've done in the past. I'm going to write an article  unasked-for , dazzle them, and I'm in. Unfortunately the only band coming to Spokane in the near future that isn't Loverboy or this guy is Pedro the Lion.  Fortunately , I really like Pedro the Lion and I'd jump at the chance to go to their concert anyway. Win win. One snag: the closest they get to Seattle before hitting Spokane is Vancouver, the  night before . The plan isn't nearly as well thought out as I'd hoped.   Back to the drawing board . . . If there is an easier or better way, someone let me know.   Update: Looks like David Byrne is coming to town. I'm seeing him in Seattle a night later but I saw him in Spokane at the Fox a few years ago and talked to him a little so maybe that'll work. . .

      Why do people need personalized license plates? What exactly is the point? I don't understand it, but I'd really like to. Unfortunately, the kind of people that have such plates seem far too ostentatious for my fragile disposition. I get sweaty around such people, I worry they'll start to pinch my cheeks or rib me with their elbows--back me into a corner and explain to me the versatility and universality of tweed. So, forcibly alone on this voyage of discovery, I speculate wildly.  Do they have difficulty meeting people? Do they think their love of Saabs will spark a roadside conversation? A life-long friendship?    "Excuse me, but I couldn't help noticing you think 'SOBSROK'. Do you mean the European car manufacturer or the spasmodic contraction of the throat? I, for one, enjoy both."   Is the drive to let complete strangers in on their inner most desires so strong that they have to coalesce their reason for drawing breath into a 7 digit alpha-numeric code? Were they not held as children?  Is there not one amongst the millions of bumper stickers that adequately demonstrates their status as a " 18FCALI "? Or do they simply relish the fact that they are able to waste literally thousands of minutes of people's lives daily as a freeway full of motorists collectively wonder, "what . . . the . . .  fuck ?"   All of this is bad enough. It seems to me, though, that in addition to wasting my time, most of these plates are outright lies or, in the best case, percolating self-deceptions.      SK8RGRL      Just really likes  urlLink Volcom  and either loves or despises  urlLink Avril Lavigne        1337HXR       Rewarded himself with that for getting his  urlLink Mandrake -based  urlLink Counter Strike  server up and running.        PRNSTAR     Isn't, but desperately wants you to think he is.   The impetus for this drivel began on the way to work: I was stuck behind an  urlLink Audi TT . The shiny black roadster, looking like someone had tugged at a VW Beetle with a taffy-puller, was driven by a beehive of thinning silver hair that may or may not have been mounted to the skull of some osteoporotic septuagenarian. The license plate read  MJS4FUN .  Besides driving fast, which these cars do pretty well, the only fun I can imagine gleaning from an Audi TT is laughing as more than one friend  urlLink tries to pile in  the car with you. The fun-factor necessarily diminishes if one of these friends is a dwarf or an amputee. The car was a hardtop because, frankly, it looked as though any whipping wind would cleave with grim finality what remained of her hair from their enfeebled folicles.  So it had to be the rule-bending exhileration of speed. This ball of fluff though, alone in her car, windows fully up, was watching her speed strictly--watching it sit perfectly 10mph below the 25mph limit.  " YOU'RE NOT HAVING  FUN ! " I screamed, fists shaking. The scream was imagined of course, but imagined with the incredulity of a young Tom Hanks managing a team of unruly housewives ("There's no crying in  baseball "). My hands were steadfast at 10 and 2. As sweat formed a puddle betwixt my brows, my left eye began twitching uncontrollably.  I vented this annoyance to a friend (ref:  urlLink 1 ,  urlLink 2 ), and he notified me that his father, in fact, had a personalized license plate. He then cautioned me to not " paint all users with the same brush ", which is good advice. Further, he said that he feels initials (his father's simple, austere choice) leant an elegance to the affair of owning a motor car.   So all of a sudden   I   look like the crazy one.  Strange how initialling your car is a sign of cultivation, while initialling a carton of milk with a permanent marker conveys anal retentiveness and paranoia.

      This effects very few because no one really reads this exercise in self-centrism: I've changed the title again to further underscore the purpose of this blog because some of you just aren't getting it.   I write things that are meaningful and important to me; you ignore the deeper semantic meaning and go straight for the syntax errors. With each one you find, I get a little closer to crying. It's like an easter egg hunt that destroys my self-esteem.   And since the spell-check button on my pages doesn't work at all, it would appear that this is an officially sanctioned event of blogger.com.

       "You're no Brad Pitt."   I've heard that my whole life. No matter what I'm doing, I seem to get compared, unfavorably, to Brad Pit. I just couldn't quite pull off Jeffery Goines in my Intro to Drama production of Twelve Monkeys. "Close Luke, but you're no Brad Pitt." Double-faulting a third set tie-break to lose in the second round of the district tournament. "Good try Luke, but Pitt would've nailed that serve."   "99th percentile on those SATs? Not bad, but not Brad."   I've been a failure my whole life, but before Thelma and Louise, people just didn't quite have the resources to effectively tell me how I had failed to stack up.   "You're no Billy Crystal,"  was common, but didn't really affect me, because even as a child I knew that I was at least as good as Billy Crystal at most things. Not being completely unemployable outside the awards show circuit for one.   Lacking a concrete human persona, critics were forced to mine the ether of that most beguiling of linguistic constructs, the adjective. 'Twas gallantry I lacked, or chutzpah, verve, that certain something, je ne sais quoi, whatever. It was always something, they were always adjectives, and they were always in the negative.  "Ya ain't got it kid,"  my uncle would say, affecting the tone of a prohibition-era dock worker, despite having never left the Inland Empire. None of this was very convincing to an eight year old because the criticism was never tangible enough. I still don't know what chutzpah means.   As mentioned, Thelma and Louise changed this. It put a heaving, virile face to my secret shame and began my decent into the annals of the also ran. By the time Cool World hit, I knew I'd be playing second fiddle for the rest of my life. He has a string of hit movies, undeniable talent and a hot wife. All of this despite being a transvestite.  Lately though, I'd been mounting a comeback, and the change was more in perspective than tangible success. Essentially, I stopped judging myself vs. the Brad of the present. Luke 2004 just can't stack up to this year's model Pitt. So I started comparing us at points in our lives, i.e. Pitt at 23 vs myself at the same age. I was comporting myself  urlLink rather favorably . I've graduated college (Baumgarten, 15 : Pitt, Love). I've never yet had to chauffer strippers (30, Love) or dress as the giant chicken "El Pollo Loco" (40, Love) to sustain myself. I've never lived in Oklahoma or Missouri (game Baumgarten).  This weekend though, a long, sour note from the non-first violin of failure burst my eardrum of pride; shattered my champagne flute of hope.   We were hiking in the Cascades, though not very high up. This was a lazing about, communing with mother nature and slaughtering some of her creatures kind of weekend. My pre-pubescent brush with hunting exorcized whatever desire I may have had to kill a fellow mammal, so I had to find some other phylum upon which to unleash my preternatural blood lust. Unfortunatelly, furry things are pretty pervasive, and snakes can fight back, so my only recourse was to guilelessly dangle a line and hook in the water with the hope of snagging one of the slimy bastard rejects from kingdom Animalia: the fish. But the plan had a kink. The only rod I had access to was specifically designed for fly fishing. Initially I saw no problem with this, I'd seen A River Runs Through It, starring my arch-nemesis; I'd read the book.  I'd been fly fishing as a child, caught a fish that would have fit in here. Further, so my reasoning went, fishing isn't even a real sport, it's nature's equivalent of a doctor's office visit: little action, a lot of waiting. And I can sit circles around  anyone .  Norman Maclean wrote that as a child, he thought Jesus must have been a fly fisherman, and John, the most beloved among the apostles, would have been a dry fly fisherman. After crunching the numbers on this weekend's fish haul, I place myself right under Judas Iscariot, who occupies his own ring of hell, holding the can of nightcrawlers for the lesser apostles (see:  urlLink St. Thomas ,  urlLink St. Matthias  et al.) and their conventional fishing rods. I have a long way to go before I'm even allowed to  look  at a traditional set of bait and tackle, even longer until I get to dangle a bloated worm and stare intently at a giant red and white bobber.  Forget for a moment that I failed to catch a fish, or that it took me upwards of an hour to get my various lines tied. Forget that I snagged the pole on every bush and low-hanging branch on the way to the inlet of Peete Lake. Forget that I had no waders, and seeing no pools of slow moving water close to shore, I decided to wear flipflops and shorts to trudge through thorn bushes and brambles on my way down to the river--in the hopes of getting deep enough to find some fish. Forget that the poor traction of my flip flops, together with my crippling lack of coordination gave me a pumping arterial hemorrhage and left me face down in what I can only describe as a den of asps. Forget the shrieks of pain piercing the mid-afternoon calm as they ricocheted of the peaks of the northern Cascades.  Forget all that and I made a pretty good show of fly fishing.    Luckily Peete Lake is very close to Roslyn, Washington, home of  urlLink Northern Exposure  and the  urlLink worst web page  ever  . There I was able to enjoy a tasty burger and get some perspective. I may never be as good as Brad Pitt at anything, but, without even trying, I'm better off than pretty much any of these poor bastards. The guy from My Big Fat Greek Wedding excluded.

      . . . a veritable shit-storm. A front of explosive Diarrhea just rolled in about 15 minutes ago, wreaking havok on my office's toilet. Couple that with a camping trip scheduled for tomorrow and the outlook for this mid-July weekend is dim.  Hope is a good thing but it looks like we can expect at least an 80% chance of pressure-washed trees and/or ruined socks.   In related news: I'm pretty sure, as counter-intuitive as it sounds, that lactose intolerance is catchy and somehow airborne. I never had any trouble digesting dairy until I started dating a girl needs Lactaid to even drive through  urlLink these states . All of a sudden, I can't have a non-fat latte without shredding my insides and lining the toilet bowl with them.  And yes the bathroom I just defiled was the same one my coworker took her soda into.  Now you understand.

      I've been trying to avoid complaining about work because when at work but not working, the last thing I want to think about is the job I'm not doing.  I just can't avoid it any longer  Whenever someone even remotely affiliated with authority walks into the office, my boss says really loudly, " Whoa [insert name] is here, every body make it look like you're working. "  This makes all the underlings laugh -- five times a day, every day.  The  urlLink irony  of the joke is not lost on me, and I'm not just poo-pooing middle-aged humor. An  urlLink ironic  joke is really only amusing once. Repetition in humor can be done to great effect, but recycling jokes based on a leige-lord masquerading as a serf is just annoying.  Other one-liners beaten to death:   "You're confusing me with someone who knows what is going on."   "I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid."   Hmmmm, those're all that come to mind right now . . . but there will be more.  Oh yeah, he's the only Jewish person I've ever known who spends most of his time whistling     ... Christmas tunes       ...in the  middle of summer   granted I don't know many jewish people.

      Holy shit, in response to an anonymous comment to my last post, I decided to put a few things in my profile, to abate what seems to be one person's raging lust for information about me. I typed in some things, whatever came to mine, didn't bother with interests because, well, you wouldn't GET my interests and my influences are mostly German. So then I save it, then revise and save again because the occupation field apparently requires you keep the witty non-sequiters to 40 characters or something--which is what's wrong with this country by the way: field lengths.  Finally I amputate my response until it's completely nonsensical and save. Then, characteristically, out of my intense self-preoccupation and to make sure I didn't misspell anything, I check the formatted version.  Strange.  All my bands and books have turned into links. . . so this is how they make money, I think to myself--outloud--the heads of coworkers craning around to see which worker shattered the collective drone. I slump in my chair and expect the click of a band to take me to itunes.com or to Amazon for one of the books.  The truth, as I'm sure most of you know, is much more sinister. Clicking my own link for  urlLink The Decemberists  took me to a page filled with faces smirking ironically in thick-rimmed glasses and with cigarettes perfectly framed in the upper-left corner of the webcam snapshot. More frightening than the fact that I'd been setup for complete indexing and cataloging by some annonymous taunt, was the fact that I'd been more or less perfectly categorized by this system based on my enjoyment of a single band. Any of these face shots seemed like viable candidates for a torrid affair of intellectual and sexual comingling. By that I mean a casual friendship I unsuccessfully try to steer towards romance.  I'm ever more frightened of places like  urlLink eharmony.com   who, with their trademarked 29 points of compatibility, could probably tell me things about myself I don't even know.     ME  : "Excuse me, Dr. Harmony, all these potential matches are men."  eHarmony.com : "Indeed."  It also makes me think that the three and a half years I spent emerging from my pupa into the rarified air of snot-nosed individualism was all a big waste of time. I mean I specifically listen to the Decemberists because no one else does (except for every friend and aquaintence I have). I read books I think no one else has read just to lord the fact over EVERYONE. This page of smiling pseudo-literati was really fucking with me.   I took Existentialism from a  urlLink Keirkegaardian  Catholic who was very proud of the fact that he grew up in the aftermath of the "free-love sixties". He was fond of drawing attention to the fact that all the counter-culture movements that sprung up then didn't succeed in abolishing homogeneity in society or in bringing individualism to suburbia, they simply created smaller pockets of sheep that thought differently in the same way. That's the kind of cynicism I eat up with fork and knife and seems to have borne itself out today. I'm just one of the throng of Decemberists fans that look and think and dress the same. I would've been in the same basic position if I'd gotten a finance degree and was making shitloads of money.  Though I'd probably be cursed with crappy glasses.

      Are there any new angles from which to examine Nazism that haven't been beaten into total pastiche? Yes. Well, maybe not anymore--but there was, until  urlLink Facing Windows  found it. I'm not going to say any more because it's one of the film's little secrets, the central mystery. The Reich connection is slowly hinted at, nudged into your consciousness. At times I thought I had a leg up on the movie, like I'd won the battle of wits. And that's true, to a point. It's really great work, giving you this info early enough on that it sits there at the back of your mind, stewing enough that it almost seems familiar. Then, just when you're comfortable with it, in comes the obligatory twist. It's not shocking the way The Crying Game is shocking, it's more of a tragic, drawn-out moment. The results are, well, kick ass.   You may have guessed, I thought the movie was brilliantly written. The story is content to draw you along at it's own pace, gradually revealing the mysteries of four lives that become entangled when an unhappily married couple stops to help a senile old man who can't remember anything about himself. One of the few screenplays in a long time that has made me absolutely sick with envy.  And it's Italian, so be prepared to read.

      That's right I said it. I'd thought it for a while but like a good and abiding member of society, I kept my mouth shut, maintained the status quo. But when I saw his visage 15 feet tall in triplicate across the various screens of the White River Amphitheatre, banging his head to the arena-sized rock of RUSH, I couldn't be quiet any longer.  This is but the latest example of the brutal decline of the cast of Seinfeld. The only thing worse than pitching Kentucky Fried Chicken is certainly being a running joke in the multimedia backdrop of a 30-year-old band's reunion tour . . . but like so much of the rest of their careers since, it would make a GREAT episode.  I was going to go on a tyrade about the seedier underbelly of the concert, as if the denegration of David Starsky's dad wasn't enough, but I don't know if I want to.  More or less there were a bunch of Nascar dads--I'm not stereotyping really, they were wearing the clothes and had their children with them--who started to get really aggitated and I couldn't figure out why. The most vocal (well I assume he was talking and not just mouthing, but for the sheer rocking going on, I can't be sure) of the lot was also the most heavy-set and bore the largest mustache. It took quite a while of intense study, but I finally caught a fragment of a sentence: "fucking hate faggots."  I'm no lip-reader and certain words have similar mouth motions as other totally different words, but I'm sure he wasn't talking about olive juice and I can't think of any other phrases with that particular alliterative flavor. When the ringleader physically started to throw things at the best-dressed man in the section, there was no more room for doubt.  This is probably the first time I've actually witnessed this kind of overt hate and it really bothered me--left me seething. It wasn't just the act itself but also the fact that I didn't donkey-punch the bastard. For his part, I'm sure the object of the edible projectiles didn't even realize what was going on, his shirt so stiffly starched that it didn't seem to actually touch his skin and formed a protective shell the popcorn simply glanced off.  I'm still mad at myself for not stepping in somehow, or at least narc-ing them out to security (which if I'm being honest with myself, taddling is just about the ONLY thing I would've done) but for shit sake, they had mustaches.  But looking back on it, I just feel sorry for those hate-mongers, for in their loathing, they missed the real show. Not the band, they really weren't interesting until the pyrotechnics started flaming and the lazers threatened to prematurely blind 10,000-odd people. They missed the  closeted  gay couple posing as frat brothers.  Right, once again this is body language observation and thus open to interpretation, but I have several friends who were or are in fraternal organizations of the Greek stripe, I know what happens, maybe even engaged a little "bonding" from time to time. There comes a point in a boys life when curiosity outstrips fear and . . . hmmm, I'd go on but I hardly know you. The point is that this was not your run of the mill pledge-week homoeroticism. No, this was full on unrequited love. I have to hand it to them though, they had the aging frat alumnus look down quite well--though that was the ultimate downfall, they had it down far  too  well.  Maybe they weren't closetted at all, maybe their absurd matching getups were regular weekend attire, maybe they actually walk in the hinterland where gay culture and fantasy sports co-mingle, wanting their homo-erotic cake and buffalo wings too.   This blog isn't about biased commentary, this is about unadulterated truth. They were dressed in identical Rush Tour shirts, identical Lee dungarees, identical beige hats from American Eagle, the artificially weathered kind. The tall one stood ABSURDLY close to his squat mate, far too close for even the most intimate of friends, their entire bodies physically touching for the better part of 4 hours.  The short one didn't move much, mostly just the self-conscious head-bobbing and foot-tapping I've more or less raised to the level of art. The tall one, meanwhile, danced like a goddamned youth pastor, raising his hands to the glory of Rush, each swaying motion glancing his head-nodding friend ever so slightly. Fascinating.  All of this would be mere conjecture by itself. Lumped together it becomes something more. Of course when the taller one had to inch by the shorter one after a bathroom break and the short one helped his friend past with a gentle squeeze of the uppermost thigh, the verdict was in.  Dammit if I didn't forget my camera, otherwise this would be a career making blog . . .

      Friday night I got thirty years of rock condensed into one spectacular . . . ly long night of Nascar T-shirts, male short shorts, bad bleach jobs, worse facelifts, and of course all the homophobia you could shake a broomstick at.  The band was RUSH, the anniversary was diamond ( urlLink paper depending on whose grandmother you talk to ), the crowd was stoked and also mostly high or drunk, the performance--I understand--was quintessential. I say understand because I really have no frame of reference to compare it to, having only previously heard Tom Sawyer and a handfull of tracks from Roll the Bones. So I take the word of my two young cousins, who accompanied me--or rather, whom I accompanied. They supplied the ticket and the running commentary on Neal Peart's all inclusive drumming aesthetic and the evolution of Geddy Lee's voice; I supplied the car.  As this was technically a family outing and I really never see my family as I live such a distance away as to make travel prohibitive, I tried to understand this thing that my cousins were obviously so wrapped up in. The task proved more or less impossible. There was just too much funny shit happening in the audience to care about what was happening onstage.   Cousin : Whoa man, did you hear the guitar at the end of Working Man there?   Me  : Yes, wow.  Cousin : That was amazing   Me  : Yeah, so is that man with the David Crosby Haircut and Marlb-rolled sleeves.   Cousin : [laugh] Yeah   Me  : Wow he must've really liked the solo too, he's taking off that bleached denim sleeveless jacket with the Rush pentagram thing and holding it aloft. And now his girlfriend--there, the one with the track marks--is illuminating it for all the world to see with her Harley-Davidson Zippo.  That was almost word for word one of the many FANTASTIC observations I was able to make of this most American crowd in their natural habitat: Drunk and blindly clutching at lost youth.    There was also the guy in the threadbare shirt commemorating Rush's 1976 "Two Hemispheres" Tour with hair more or less like these guys, who kept looking back at me with a more or less ironic look on his face, mocking the fact that I wasn't double-fisting the devil horns. He actually smirked in disbelief and shook his head. I'm a lost cause, you're right   There were of course SCORES of ex-high school football players, whom you could distinguish easily enough by their tight, curly mullet and full beards, their mil-spec cellphones clipped to their large-buckled belts and the small studded earring they kept in their left ear--a silent vigil to that district championship, that miracle season, 197x. The sub-genus, Ex-quarterback, further differentiated by the bleached-blonde silicon repositories that hung off their arms, their baby-doll t-shirts doing nothing to hide the scars from that third cesaerean section.  I'll add more to this later . . . .

      Yesterday was the first day I blogged and I was all caught up in the idea of blogging in and of itself. It was all fluffy and ethereal, all very academic. Looking back at my posts from today, I'm seeing a change.  I notice myself falling into good blogging form: writing some horribly self-centered crap then violently defending myself against friends and would-be detractors.  This came much more quickly than expected and with sentences that, dare I say it, are so staccatto as to rival my days as a trumpet player in middle school jazz band.

      Same friend, though more friend in title now--aquaintance really, seems to have been rather illuminated by this infant blog of mine.   Quoth Brit:   "It always amazes me how different english and american people write . . . Aye, americans are much more subject to prose-like sentences, sort of a literary version of Dawsons Creek.."   I'll try to make my sentenses more terse. Better yet I'll throw all my posts into the Hemingway Novel generator. While I'm working on that here's a list of rambling ass brits:   Joseph Conrad  (slight deduction for being Eastern European by birth)  Oscar Wilde  (bonus points for writing rambling PLAYS)  Shakespeare  (Ultra bonus points for writing rambling plays in iambic pentameter)  more to come as I think of them

      Found this while trying to explain what a blog was to a British friend. Poor wretch had no idea. Apparently their politicians like to individualize themselves based on issues and platforms rather than the trendy way they fundraise. . . neanderthals.   blog    n.  Short for weblog.  A meandering, blatantly uninteresting online diary that gives the author the illusion that people are interested in their stupid, pathetic life. Consists of such riveting entries as "homework sucks" and "I slept until noon today."   v. intr.  The act of posting to a weblog.

      I called in sick to work today citing sinusitis. I made the most of it . . . or rather, I made the more of it buy expending lots of energy making a photoblog. It's the sum total of non-crappy pictures I've taken since I got my wonderful Canon A80.     urlLink Be Gentle .    I want to find a way to do link the pics similar to the way  urlLink Smacktooth does . It's a cool style I think. Except I'd probably have the pics across in the header. Actually, I think I'd just like thumbnails of the (x) most recent posts linking dynamically to the (x) most recent pics. Mike, any ideas?  Anyone else?

      I was thinking about the divisiveness of the political discourse in this country, the polarization, the outright hatred from both the extreme left and right. I was thinking about the terror level, Burt in most of the country and Ernie in New York City and DC.  I was thinking about fear as a vehicle for recruiting conservatives.  Think about this. Why do we call Republicans "conservative"? Look at their platform. Legislating to ensure the survival of "traditional American values" and leaving the rest to big business. They want to conserve the way of life begun by our--predominately--Puritan forefathers. This is fine in itself. I like Jesus and his teachings. I think Jesus was a great guy.  I think Jesus, were he alive today, would be more inclusive with his love and respect than both the current Republican Administration and most of the groups who have devoted their lives to his worship (the Catholic Church as a whole, the Southern Baptists, et al). But that's kind of beside the point.  They have a conception of a country and of a culture they like. They feel these things are in jeopardy; they desperately want them to persevere unchanged.  Let's look at culture as a function of evolution. Cultures are fluid, this is an observation, not a partisan value judgment. They change, this is inevitable. Conservatives, by definition, are resistant to change. Republicans, as a party, are resistant to  cultural  change. They think our country is in danger of falling into a moral fissure. Certain others feel our country is struggling to climb its way out of that fissure. These are value judgments.  So culture. How does it change? More importantly, how does it change the fastest? I'm not going to cite sources or attempt to convince you, I've got a concert to get to. Cultures, in my opinion, change the fastest when imposed upon by outside cultures, this kind of synthesis is much better at evolving a culture than a culture left to its own devices. Realize that I'm not using evolution as a term of teleological movement. When something evolves, biology teaches us, it isn't "better" per se, it isn't moving towards perfection, it is merely changing.  Just as scientists propose a spike in the pace of biological evolutionary change when asexual reproduction gave way to sexual, the pace of cultural evolution speeds up when cultures are fused, or when people of divergent cultures integrate.  If you buy this idea, what then, is the most present danger the our cultural sovereignty faces? I submit it is influence from other, radically different cultures. Outsiders.  What is the best way stifle this? I think it's fear. Fear of the other. Xenophobia. When our nation's terrorism alert system is inextricably linked with a group of people, we send the message that outsiders are inherently dangerous, or at least suspicious, and to be avoided. Similar in its functionality is the doctrine of unilateralism pushed by this administration.  GWB said, "America will never seek a permission slip to defend it's sovereignty," or something to that effect. It's them against us,   all   of them.  How much hatred of the French has this caused? France, a country who has been our longtime ally. Now the French are selfish communists and a divisive global element only concerned with their own (evil) agenda and a thorn in the side of the peace-loving world. Just like the Terrorists (Islamists). The peace loving are made up of a curiously small number of countries: England, Canada, Australia, etc.  Hmmm.  The coalition of the willing is not only deeply tied to us economically, but  also very similarly composed culturally.  I'll probably add more depth to this later, but these are my thoughts and I have a concert to get to. Discuss amongst yourselves.  Photos (of the concert, not coalition) to (hopefully) follow.     Spellcheck works with Mozilla, now I really need to change my blog title. Strangely, blogger's spell check doesn't contain the word "blog".

      BLLLLARGHGHGH. All yesterday I kept trying and trying to post to blogger. It would save, but not publish. Rather than the cute little status clock thing coming up telling me my blog was 50 . . . 70 . . . 100% published, I got the big 404 error. Maddening.  Still, it seemed like a site problem. When everything else is working and a single page seems to be down, I generally assume it isn't a client-side error.  At least not until now. In Internet Explorer's constant battle to drive me insane, the bar has been raised.  It was as an afterthought that I tried publishing in Firefox. It worked just fine. Go figure.  I've known IE (actually, Crazy Browser, which is IE hacked with tab and integrated Google functionality--up till now the most convenient browser I've ever used) was taking on water for a while now, I just didn't want to switch. I'm lazy. Also though, Firefox doesn't seem to like the Flash installs I do. I install, and Flash works until I reboot. I then have to reinstall. Annoying. So maybe it's IE for browsing and Firefox for the important stuff.  My eLife is beginning to take on the complications of my real life. So much for escapism.  Also, for some god-unknown reason, IE won't display my picture of Vizzini from the blog about Socialism. I had to get image hosting because I'd been just direct-link ganking pictures from sites to suit my needs, but every picture of Vizzini I could find was hosted on Angel Fire or some other site that doesn't allow direct-linking. So I got some space at imageshack.us. Except the pic wouldn't render. I tried a few different things, but eventually gave up.  Then today, on Firefox, there is Vizzini in all his glory. Bleh.  And now this brilliance. Firefox keeps the formatting from Word when I cut and paste. That's something I would expect from a Microsoft browser. Firefox it is.      “I fell asleep, he musta crawled in there for warmth.”        *     *     *

        (If you didn't notice this post yesterday it's because either Blogger or IE was possessed by a demon of Luke-infuriation. I'm working on moving exclusively to Firefox as of right now)    I made the most bomb breakfast this morning. I love scrambles. I love over easy eggs. Why has no one combined the two before? Maybe they have, I don’t know.  Regardless of the novelty, that is exactly what I made this morning  Green onions, mushrooms, hash browns, cheese, and a few eggs offering up their gooey goodness.     “They don’t even have a dining room.”      * * *

      I mentioned the other day that Mark Ruffalo has been in a ton of movies this year.  Today I opened up NYTimes.com and saw his face again. A.O. Scott's name was near it.  Movie Review? Wuzzuh . . . He wasn't that poorly shaven in Collateral [these are the banal conversations I have with myself], and that only opened up a week ago . . . there's something fishy going on . . .   It turns out his new movie, or rather,   newest     movie  , is called  urlLink We Don't Live Here Anymore  (reg. req.).  That makes  urlLink four movies  this year and three last year. That's a staggering number. So far, he's given varied and insightful roles in all of them. He wasn't even that bad in A View From the Top, which I watched under the threat of some   serious relationship terrorism   (unlike our country as a whole, my terror level stays at orange most of the time). I also missed 13 going on 30, so if anyone would like to comment on that movie, I'll probably figure out a way to ban your IP.  I can't wait for  We Don't Live Here Anymore . It opens this weekend, but only in New York and LA. Let me know if anyone knows anything more about release dates. Mike, let me know if you get off your ass to see it.

        "  You fool! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders! The most famous is never to get involved in a land war in Asia. And only slightly less well known is this: never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line!  " -- Vizzini,  urlLink The Princess Bride   Mike brought up some  urlLink good points  about the people that were getting pissed off about Vonnegut's articles being so leftist.  The people on those forums who posted responses like "WTF, when did Vonnegut become so cynical?" Either A) haven't   read   any of his books or B) didn't   understand   any of his books.  That makes these people either A) Totally ignorant of his work or B) retarded.  He calls himself a "lifelong Northern Democrat"--which is to say he is a socialist. He always has been. Read  urlLink God bless you Mr. Goldwater . Read  urlLink Galapagos . Re-read  urlLink Slaughterhouse Five  because you obviously didn't understand it in high school and/or college.  When Mike said he was an "unabashed" liberal, I thought of another word, "smashmouth". Both are good.  He hits you over the head with his humanism--He forces you to confront his ideas through his dogged use of plain speech, repetition of themes and sarcasm. He often borders on polemics, but unlike Moore and Limbaugh and Franken and Coulter, he makes his case with insights into human nature, rather than the crude observations of individuals or policies that make those firebrands seem transient and unimportant.  He scolds. He lectures. Most of all though, he resonates. That, I think, is what makes those who disagree with him so violently angry. His work will live on long after their petty complaints die a horrible memetic death.  Which proponents of unfettered capitalism will have that kind of longievity? I can't think of one, other than the lumbering market economy itself. And that can be undone--rather, it's dehumanizing effects can be reversed.  I have no idea why Vonnegut's brand of  urlLink humanism  is seen as a leftist cause. That's not what I mean.   I do have an idea   why it's seen as a leftist cause, and I think the reasoning is fucking stupid.   Humanism in this case has something to do with wanting Universal Healthcare and the idea that Life, Liberty and Property (or "the pursuit of happiness" depending on the wording) should mean more than just allowing people to make as much money as possible. It should mean letting each human being prosper with dignity and respect.  This rubs a lot of people the wrong way.   What bastards these humanists be. Some fucking nerve.     I think there are two--maybe three, I'm undecided--essential problems facing Humanist public relations. First is that they (we) don't think money should be elevated above people. This concept is anathema to the  urlLink founding principles of American corporate culture . In a legislative machine not just greased but fueled by soft money from big business, that's an daunting ideological hill to climb--a little like a land war in Asia.  Secondly, the humanist ethos is rooted deeply in what is called socialism. Socialism, in the minds of Americans alive during the Cold War, is inextricably linked to Soviet-era Communism. Through that it's linked to genocide, despotism, militarism, pressed cardboard cars, bread lines, thought police, and George Orwell's  urlLink unimaginative talking barnyard .   That portrayal is at best unfair. Luckily, it's not shared by most of the rest of the world. My friend Rich would agree with me on that. He's from Europe. Before someone calls me an Arrogant Liberal, I'll ammend that: He's British. Not French. He's a charter member of the Coalition of the Willing. He's not a Communist or a member of the Taliban. He has democratically elected leaders and free healthcare. It's not perfect, but it's better than an HMO.  You can have Socialist programs outside a communist framework, and certainly without a totalitarian regime. I don't think a lot of people know that.     There is a third point that I almost hesitate to bring up because I'm not decided about it. I'm ususally pretty indiscriminate with my words anyway though so I'll just dive in. Protestantism. Specifically American Protestantism. Here's how I break it down. Protestantism as discussed  urlLink here  (I'm not advocating the reading of Time Magazine, God no) is a doctrine of personal responsibility and acountability. This is a good thing in the right circumstances, but too often it translates into:     "You can be anything you want to be ... and if you don't make it, you have no one to blame but yourself"   -- Berkeley sociologist Robert Bellah (you should also never quote Time Magazine)  This is a problem in a democratic system when people genuinely believe that the Haves have because they work hard and the Havenots lack because they are lazy. The people with power--with money--having grown up in this environment, tend to view programs like welfare and worker's compensation with disdain and as a theft of hard earned money. Then when you have an evangelist like  urlLink Casey Treat  preaching that to be poor is   an indication of sin  , the problem only gets worse because public perception shifts even farther from the truth. The poor hear these word faith evangelists spew their scorched-earth, smash and grab theology and they become more distraught at the fact that God has shunned them, or that they are unworthy of God. That's not religious consolation, thats a bitter and dangerous pill.  More often than people like to admit, the poor are poor as a function of disenfrancisement and systematic oppression. I'm not talking about racial oppression, though that certainly happens. This is a class based thing. With wages that don't match inflation, the cliche "the rich get richer, the poor get poorer," is completely true. It takes money to make money. If you don't have any, how the hell are you going to get any? People don't see this because it isn't in the best interest of the policy makers to shed light on the subject.  So maybe the biggest problem of all (this makes four I guess) is that our legislators are self-serving morons who line their own pockets and have little desire and even less initiative to exact any kind of social change, because the poor don't vote anyway. Why push for education reform when you can get re-elected without it? Why fight for worker's rights when your slush fund is overflowing with corporate payouts? It's bullshit that, despite the passing of the McCain-Feingold bill, it's still perfectly fine to have one night an election term where all the soft money interests in America can spend as much money on a candidate as they want. They had one at the DNC and they'll definitely throw one for Bush. It's sickening and it's bad for democracy. But it's   especially bad   in a capitalistic democracy in which only money has any real power.  I think I'm really far off my initial topic so rather than scramble to right this sinking ship, I'll just abandon it--But I'll talk some more first . . .  My point is that Socialism is more or less facing a nasty quadruple-penetration in this country, and a lot needs to change before it even becomes a viable topic of discourse. This is a shame because the humanistic ethos seems like a no-brainer to me frankly. I think if more people knew the facts about it, there would be less resistance to it. At the very least there could be a more open political dialogue. And   any kind of dialogue is better than any kind of silence.    Maybe that's naive of me.  But I'm a snot-nosed liberal arts major and I don't care that much about money, so I'm predisposed to bleeding heart syndrome. I think that makes me a     threat to national security.             I wonder if Vonnegut hates dashes as much as he hates semicolons . . .

      In my rage last night I complained that Richard Roeper and his column are just severely disconnected thoughts trickling from his brain without point or texture. This isn't entirely true.  It's only mostly true.  What's also true is that he's a pretty smart guy. I say that because I feel guilty and because he is, probably, smart.  By some uncanny luck, I stumbled across the column of another man. It is also basically just assorted musings in the vein of our Mr. Roeper. The stark difference is that it's brilliant.  The column appears to be written every other month or so--probably whenever the author feels like it. It appears in  urlLink this magazine  and it's written by  urlLink Kurt Vonnegut  (it's hilarious that the world's biggest luddite should have a webpage, much less an "official" one).  He's writing another novel. He's been writing it for five years. He almost seems resigned to not finishing it.  I think what makes me like Kurt Vonnegut so much is that he's so good at making people boiling mad, explosively mad. The interesting part is that he does it by asking people to respect human life and to love each other.  It's fascinating how mad this makes people.  Example:    This article is a merely a silly diatribe. I am very disappointed with the lack of anything that i can sink my cognitive teeth in. The election in Florda rigged? By virtually all recouning methods, Bush won. Time to get over the close call and move on! The US feared and hated as the Nazis? Did the Nazis remove brutal dictators and spend billons of marks rebuilding the terrorized country? The US dehumanizing millons of people? Where? If this is aimed at Iraq, it misses the mark by a lightyear! Linking Bush to Hitler via Christianity? Pure sleaze. All the resources (money) has been taken by “psychopathic personalities”? Is this really meant to be a serious article? (BTW - i am a fan of the wonderful fiction written by KV. Welcome to the Monkey House was terrific. Perhaps he should stick to what he knows best, fiction)     Pointed. Pointed and blind.  Anyway, go to that website and search Vonnegut, there's about 8 pieces to read, they're all great. Some are more politicized than others.  This resonated with me:    “If you really want to hurt your parents, and you don’t have the nerve to be a homosexual, the least you can do is go into the arts. But do not use semicolons. They are transvestite hermaphrodites, standing for absolutely nothing. All they do is show you’ve been to college.”   --Vonnegut.  Dammit he's right; I'm a failure.

      I live on Highland Drive.  A rare bird, that.  It’s not a street, not an avenue, not a road. It is a   Drive  . That is the urban equivalent of   lane  . It’s a cart-track perched on a hill somewhere—paved, but otherwise indistinguishable from the dirt road I grew up on. It’s rutty, steep, quiet and out of the way.  Quiet.  Except the seven times nightly that sirens cleave the air and rattle my skull with ricocheting sound waves. Except when the water engine has to lay on its horn to warn people it’s turning onto the thoroughfare. You have to give fair warning to oncoming motorists because it’s impossible to see over the crest of the hill from Highland. It’s a goddamned death trap.  Tonight, it is also a sleep trap.  It’s 2 AM and I’m ready to crucify the great-grandchildren of whomever thought it was a good idea to put a fire station in a nook of a residential neighborhood whose only outlet to the rest of the world is Highland Drive—my quaint little cart-track.  Murdering the twice-removed progeny of a man who was once in charge of making poor city planning decisions would be a nice reprieve from the gut-twisting angst that has kept me awake waiting for the fire engine to come by. But I’d almost fallen asleep. I’d almost placated myself enough to dose off.  One nice thing about Seattle: it has emergencies you can set your watch by. The city is very efficient in that respect.    [Fade in, Sirens blare. Protagonist sits up, glances at watch]  Protagonist:  Wha? Is it the worst possible time already? *  It’s always either at a crucial point in a movie or when I’ve finally almost convinced myself I’m not wasting my life doing a job I hate for a sum of money that is no longer justification in itself.  Tonight it was the latter.  Now I’m writing this to try and direct the rage at something useful and constructive like bitching to an online community of people whose unifying characteristic is a passing interest in my well-being. It’s also too muggy to attempt REM sleep.  So—ahem—fuck money, fuck job experience, fuck my bills—fuck the person who won’t stop calling my upstairs neighbor † .   She doesn’t want to talk to you  . Fuck me for not attacking opportunities.  I don’t know why it’s so hard to find a job where someone will pay me to discuss issues and voice my opinion. Maybe it’s that I never actually look.   Richard Roeper gets to review movies   and   his editors gave him his  urlLink own daily column . It’s all pointless musings in no particular order and with no unifying theme. It exists only to let slip the banalities from his over-round head—apropos of absolutely fucking nothing. He uses lots of these: *** to separate his disparate thoughts. It’s like a police blotter of stupidity. I’m drunk with jealousy.  I’ll make this easier. Don’t pay me. Give me food and shelter, handle my student loans and find someone to buy my car. You can throw things at me while I type if you want. The only catch is that you have to find me; I won’t be coming to you.   ***

      Mike posted a  urlLink little something  about comment spamming that was more or less for my benefit. In the interest of bringing something fruitful to the conversation I went out and did a little digging on blog authority. I found a whole bunch of bullshit and a lot of math majors struggling to find a thesis project.  I also found this  urlLink guy's site . He uses a lot of jargon the I consciously avoided learning whilst taking stats in college, but he mitigates it with other, more common sense language--and scatterplots.   I like scatterplots.   Scatterplots let me pretend I understand statistical analysis.  It's interesting reading, I think I might finally pull the trigger and add a new link to my blogroll.  He also has a project called  urlLink blogdex . Its purpose is to   "objectively describe the information epidemics that occur regularly within informal social networks."   This interests me greatly. I kind of cut my teeth on this stuff in my devisive Senior Seminar on Metaphysics and Epistemology. I did some research into memetics to provide a counterpoint to all the goddamned neo-Aristotilian epistemological crap spewing from the seminary students.  I see a problem with his methodology though. If blogdex is meant to facilitate an academic analysis--which it very well may not be--then putting it up for public consumption would have the potential to wildly exaggerate the "epidemics" he's trying to study.  This is dependent on how popular his site is of course, and since it appears to be link dependent, blogdex couldn't directly sway results.  But it will channel more bloggers to those particularly viral ideas, exposing more people to them and potentially generating more links. And on and on.  That's the problem with treating information as an organism, it feeds off attention. The effect is compounded when releasing findings on the information you've studied to the same meme pool the information itself exists in. But when the information set is human correspondence and the transmission agent is something as potent as the internet, there really isn't a way around it. Unless he was to not publish at all.   Then I couldn't have written this blog  . I'm sure no one wants that.  It's like giving hamhocks to a pride of lions and documenting with astonishment as they follow your Land Rover around--interesting but skewed. God that's a really bad analogy.    Of all the things those nuts (the Neo-Aristotelian/Thomist/Perceyans) took issue with, they had the toughest time arguing against memetics as a theory of information transmission. They basically thought it had some self-reference problems. They also said the idea was "very scary"--one of the better arguments I heard. The implications of memetics are scary, and also thrilling.

        I associate    urlLink   Chris Cornell      with Los Angeles  . This is a seemingly random, neural-firing kind of association—like I associate Green Day’s  urlLink Dookie  with  urlLink Warcraft II . It’s something that I don’t think I’ll ever really understand.  I’d  like  to ascribe some reason to it. I’d like to think it’s because they’re both seedy, both look like they need more one on one time with a loofah and because each has given birth to some awful music. I’d like to think  urlLink   Black Hole Sun    fits into the equation somehow, as an expression of one of these things. The video, with its synthetic smiles and washed out cinematography certainly seems seems very LA.  So as all the various archetypes at odds in  urlLink Collateral —the Feds, LAPD, the kingpin’s henchmen, our hero and antihero—descend upon a night club for a bit of climactic gun violence, it was fitting that some shit Cornell song or another would be thumping out of the theatre’s sound system. It annoyed me, set me on edge--just how I'd be if I was about to walk into the club they shoot holes in. I imagined this was the type of song any of these expendable people would listen to. It crystallized the Cornell/LA association.  I’ve never been to LA.  Tom Cruise describes the kind of place I expect to find if I ever go there:    “Sprawling, disconnected.”    Just like a Chris Cornell song—this Cornell song. Sound and Fury. Big sounds, layered guitar, throbbing base. Utter shit. It sprawls. Every note is drawn out and heavy with distortion. I guess it's technically  urlLink Audioslave . But anyway you slice it, it's still Cornell's crappy self-indulgent lyrics.   My apologies to  urlLink Tom Morello , but your new band's singer sucks  .  I’ve always liked the music in  urlLink Michael Mann  movies. It fits, despite my personal prejudices. I’ve always liked his camera work. The angles he dreams up fit mood at setting perfectly.  I’ve liked every movie Michael Mann has made. Even Ali. As far as I know he has never made a bad movie.  He never lets you forget where you are, who you’re with. He doesn’t waste the medium. He conveys meaning with every shot, every element—setting, music, everything. The little slider on the Plexiglas divider that separates the front and back seat of Max’ cab is always open, but Mann never shoots Cruise or Jamie Foxx through the hole. The glass is always in the way. It’s scratched, it has papers taped to it, there are fares posted. You only see the back of Foxx’ head, Cruise’s eyes. The characters are almost always obscured. When Mann tracks the cab, though, it’s usually from 100 stories directly above.  Disconnected.  Like LA, like Max, like the killer in the back seat.  Michael Mann makes movies the way Henry James wrote books, with obsessive attention to psychological details.  I hate Henry James. I might have mentioned that I like Michael Mann. James plods along, droning endlessly, obsessing over details, psychic minutia. Mann is obsessive too, but he doesn’t have the luxury of plodding along.  Cinema has a built-in metronome to deal with that.  Mann understands the pacing necessary to keep an action movie afloat. He manages to work in all the important stuff wherever he can find a moment. Revelatory glances are exchanged through gun fire. Max has a weird facial tick that always shows itself just before the camera cuts away. Mann puts this stuff in knowing you’ll miss a lot, but hoping that you’ll notice enough. That’s brave and elevates the script above formula.  It’s a familiar formula.  Cruise’s Vincent is one part Tyler Durden, one part T-1000 with a little cheeky Nihilism to keep the dialogue hip. He's the archetypal post-modern killer-philosopher.  Max has a back story that is similar to the 7/11 clerk that Brad Pitt and Edward Norton threaten to kill in  urlLink Fight Club . He has dreams, but his life is on repeat. Vincent saves him from that.    Vincent kills a lot of people, but in a perverse way gives Max his life back  .  Mark Ruffalo has been in every third movie I’ve seen this year. That’s an amazing feat in itself. He’s becoming one of my favorite character actors. He’s very good at transforming himself. This time he's the Latino cop who thinks there might be more going on than meets the eye.  His Detective Fanning is really close to fitting all the pieces together the whole movie. It takes a while, but he eventually gets it. Then just as he gets it, he gets it.  When almost every big budget motion picture is a thriller, all you can really ask from a director and screen writer working in that cramped intellectual space is that they try and kill off characters in unique ways at unexpected times.  Collateral gets high marks for both of those things. That it also manages Max' growth and dreams in very human terms makes a very satisfying experience.  As I said before though, this is essentially a movie of archetypal characters. Max is too human for his own good, Vincent is godlike. In the end it's a struggle against stasis--"  Improvisation, Evolution, the I Ching  "--it's about breaking free of the tethers that keep life in a holding pattern.  The one who does survives the night and gets the girl.  All in all it’s a great movie and Jamie Foxx does an amazing job. I got home and crossed him off my mental hate list of people who have made a career entertaining white people by doing the black thing.    That's a tough hole to dig yourself out of--just ask Martin Lawrence and Will Smith  .  Asking if a Michael Mann movie is good is tautological as far as I'm concerned. "Good" is built in to every Michael Mann movie. This is conditional of course and part of the suspense of every Mann movie is worrying that this new one is going to suck. I call this inevitable downturn "Kevin Spacey Syndrome" (ex  urlLink 1 , urlLink 2 , urlLink 3 ).  For one more year I can say with aplomb that Collateral is a Michael Mann movie and mean that it is good without reservation.     Mann goes too far toward the end though, getting very Terminator 2 with his shots of Cruise. It was like he was lifting shots directly from the James Cameron Action Movie Bible. I don't know what he was going for exactly, but I'm sure it wasn't this:          Regarding the blog title, you can tell Eastern Mysticism is hip again in Hollywood when sociopaths begin referring to it in screenplays.

      Has anyone else seen the trailer for the  urlLink new batman ?  It got a bigger gasp than the whole running time of The Village combined. A kid behind me literally left his seat. "  Oh Holy SHIT  ," he screamed. Everyone laughed at this, I think because it rang true with all of us. The youth of the world are thirsting for a return to a time when the Dark Knight was actually dark--and didn't suck.  I thought  urlLink Frank Miller and Darren Aronofsky  finally got around to adapting Miller's kickass  urlLink Batman: Year One .   urlLink They havent . That is annoying. Still,  urlLink Christopher Nolan  is as good as anyone else I can think of to adapt the story and direct it (anyone besides Miller and Aronofsky).   urlLink Aronofsky  is doing two other graphic novels instead it seems. An adaptation of Alan Moore's  urlLink Watchmen  (a favorite of my friend  urlLink Ben , I've never read it) and something called  urlLink Lone Wolf and Cub , which I've never heard of.  IMDB.com though says Watchmen is slated for 2005 and I haven't heard a thing about it, Lone Wolf is even sooner and nothing at all about it either. Strange.  I'm no insider, but 2004 is running down and the movie doesn't even have a website.  Anyway, this is good news for fans of good comic books, though I   really   don't like the looks of this:       Nolan has some 'splaining to do.  And who the hell is  urlLink this guy ? Writing Dark City isn't resume enough to be given a batman screenplay, esp. when that resume also includes  urlLink Demonic Toys . Though he did the three Blades. He's essentially an unknown quantity.

      Some of you will be displeased to not find fresh bullshit spewing from this blog three times a day for the next few days. Most of you will be glad.  My brother flew in last night and my parents are coming tomorrow, so my time will be pretty thin, picking them up from the turnip truck and playing big city tour guide.  I saw  urlLink The Village  last night and I want to discuss it so damned badly, but I've got a shit-ton of work to do today so I can get off before my brother locks himself out of my apartment and falls into Puget Sound.  I will say this though, I hate movie marketting   more than anything else ever  . The Village is less of a horror movie than even Unbreakable was, yet they decided to market it as that. frustrating.  The movie itself was frustrating too.  I'm not sure why, but I have an irrational devotion to M. Night Shyamalan. Less to his work itself(The Village is slightly better than Signs, which was shit) I think, than to the   idea   of his work, his aesthetic and his storytelling process. He creates modern day fairy tales--fables rich with symbolism. I love that shit. I just wish he'd do a better job of it. I know he has the talent.  The twist, which isn't hard to spot (which you know is coming by default), isn't totally convincing, but it forces you to reflect on the significance of earlier scenes in the way that Shyamalan always does. It scolds you for not paying attention, and makes you remember.   It's just messier this time around, he isn't able to tie all the pieces together.    The acting, I think, saves this movie.   Adrien Brody is a goddamned G   as usual, but his character's subplot is maddeningly irrational. Unfortunately it's also the most important--it's the lynchpin of the whole revelation. That sucks, but it's still decently crafted.  Shyamalan really goes--now that I'm thinking about it--for like 3 or 4 little revelations (I think calling them twists is missing the point a bit--though I did call them that earlier) rather than one big one. I think that might be a good step in his maturation as a filmmaker. If you can't write a great story with an explosive revelation ( urlLink The Sixth Sense ) then it's better to focus more on the story (The Village) than on the revelation ( urlLink Signs ).  So it's good, not great, not Shyamalan good, but good enough.    I wasn't planning on writing this much . . .

      I was digging around while trying to justify my  urlLink incorrect usage  of   succubus   to describe Gael Garcia Bernal, when I came upon a page entitled  urlLink INCUBUS AND SUCCUBUS: DEMONS THAT HAVE INTERCOURSE WITH YOU . Uh . . . perfect? The root page is "Jesus-is-Lord.com" I knew this was going to be good.  To begin, he's good enough to clarify and expand upon some missteps in Websters definition:   INCUBUS - A spirit or demon thought in medieval times to lie on sleeping persons, especially women, with whom it sought sexual intercourse.   SUCCUBUS - In folklore, a female demon thought to have sexual intercourse with sleeping men.   Above definitions came from Webster's Dictionary.   INCUBI - Demonic sexual attacks on females; may be caused by sexual sins, witchcraft spells, curses of lust, inherited curses, can attack children  SUCCUBI - demonic sexual attacks on males, may be caused by the same as Incubi above   Forget medieval times and folklore, these demons are for real! The demons have sex with both men and women as the person sleeps,   AND YOU KNOW IT  . It's not a dream, and it is not your imagination.  [ed. italics are mine, retarded use of capslock is not]   Aparently all those adolescent nocturnal emissions were satanic in nature. This comes as quite a relief. I'd always suspected anything that made my mom eye me like that as she changed my sheets had to be evil   (see also, dropping shovel from deck onto little brother's head)  . Also, shockingly, 9 out of 10 women have been raped by a demon.  This is fascinating. Some anthropologist should study this guy. His Christianity is draped in the superstition and fear-mongering of the 17th century lay preacher. This is Salem, Massachusetts type stuff. This is a world where demonology trumps psychology. Freud was a harbinger of Satan. I love it--though I've lost the link to that one. Rest assured that psychology is one of the many holes through which demons can enter your life, along with Hellivision.   The  urlLink main page  is better. He's got all the usual stuff, but kicked up a notch. This guy is a showman. He has animated gifs. The Roman Catholic Church, like always, is presented as the whore of Babylon, but here it's in  urlLink slide-show  format.  look up pagan Rome's "pontiff", "diocese", "vicar", incense burning, multiple gods (now called saints), goddess worship, and statues. Why do you think this Satanic masterpiece is called "ROMAN" Catholic? Ancient Rome lives on today! The Great Whore still rides the beast in all her monstrous glory!  Well put. I wonder if he worships on   Sun  day. The problem here, is not his criticism of Catholicism, the finer points of which (the persecution, murder and sexism) aren't exactly news. The problem is that he never turns the critical eye upon himself or Protestantism as a whole.  Among his quotes:    The Bible is like a lion; it does not need to be defended; just let it loose and it will defend itself.  --  Martin Luther  He's a big Luther fan; he likes the guy. Other, less famous Luther quotes (from an equally  urlLink skewed website ):   "What then shall we do with this damned, rejected race of Jews?"  "The Jews deserve to be hanged on gallows, seven times higher than ordinary thieves"   "If I had to baptize a Jew, I would take him to the river Elbe, hang a stone around his neck and push him over with the words `  I baptize thee in the name of Abraham  '."  Maybe he likes Luther because modern  urlLink Judaism is blasphemous . Now I'm getting kind of pissed off, though I still feel like I'm slumming--like refuting this guy gives him some kind of credibility.  Finally, he donkey-punches the politically correct left with a dose of Jesus' truth:     You're intolerant!    No, the truth is intolerant. 2+2=4, not 5, not 11, not 213. The truth is unbending, it is unyielding, it is exclusive. The truth of God is offensive to the hellbound, sin-loving,   want-to-believe-lies man  . God hath not left Himself without witness in this perverse and crooked generation--His word is the Holy Bible (King James 1611 for the English speaking peoples of the world). I am not the author of truth, but I know Who is. His name is Jesus and anything that contradicts His word is a wicked lie.             Blam.     He has the obligatory  urlLink screed against evolution . His biggest ally, apparently, is the  urlLink Second Law of Thermaldynamics .   Take that fake science  . Despite having thermaldynamics on his side, he commits the same error all creationist critics of Darwinism I've read do. He assumes the the theory of evolution   never evolved   past Darwin and Huxley. It's kinda the same problem as taking a series of books of uncertain authorship that were written 1500 years ago, weeding them out from a much larger group of very similar works, then countlessly and horribly hand-translating them and calling the finished product   absolute truth  . I love that he hates the papacy and believes it to be flawed from the beginning, thinks Peter (upon whose rock [God] would build [his] church) was actually Satan, yet he uses the canon scripture set down by the Council of Nicea in 325AD. There weren't any Protestants back then. The Pope was the only game in town. If he could   connect the fucking dots  , that would mean that the Bible, in its very essence and composition, is the work of the Anti-Christ.   Stupid idiot  . You don't have to be a  urlLink sophomore Philosophy student  to shoot holes in that reasoning.  Because of all the reality he's dropping, the site is under constant attack by the worldly henchmen of the antichrist--it almost goes without saying. The work of papist hackers and abortionists abounds:    THIS WEBSITE IS BEING SYSTEMATICALLY BANNED!   urlLink INTERNET FILTERING SERVICES ARE FILTERING THIS WEBSITE SO THAT YOU CAN'T SEE IT!    Is it banned because he's a fundamentalist (truth teller), or, is it because he's an anti-semite? He doesn't seem to ponder that possibility, so neither will we--there are bigger problems afoot:    If you have a problem accessing any of the files resident on our server, try capitalizing the file name, e.g., http://www.jesus-is-lord.com/couldnt.htm becomes  urlLink http://www.jesus-is-lord.com/COULDNT.HTM   Strangely, He doesn't mention the obvious, that a demon of capitalization has possessed his server. He must not want to unduly alarm us.

      And I don't say that lightly.  A friend had pointed out a kind of  urlLink inverse similarity  between Salt Lake City and Las Vegas. I think he meant they were equally trashy in opposite ways. The latter dripping lavish sin while the former gives off the stench of pseudo-ornate piety. This reminded me of a SciFi novel I'd read and set me about the usual web searching I do when something interests me.  In my search I ran into  urlLink SLC on Mapquest . I zoomed out to get some geographic perspective.  Then I got really confused.  Then I went and double-checked it on  urlLink Yahoo maps .  Then the pieces kind of fell into place on a lot of the disparate elements of my life.  For some reason, I never realized that Utah bordered Idaho. I can't really express in words how hugely this changes the way I see this part of the world. It's unbelievable that I've never noticed it before. I grew up 15 minutes from the Idaho border, albeit a different one.  I feel a little dissoriented. I thought I had a pretty good relational idea of where all the states were.   Now all of a sudden the localized map I have in my mind looks like the work of an Enlightenment cartographer, all guilded and utterly distorted. I'm probably giving myself too much credit. My brain map is probably more  urlLink Ptolemaic . Incidently I wonder if that cartographer, Johan Scotus, is the same John the Scot, or Duns Scotus this  urlLink jolly abbott  forced me to read in Medieval Philosophy. I think the time periods are wrong. Seems like my chronology is screwed up too, completing the spacio-temporal bifecta. That makes me a huge idiot.   This is really digressing, but I would have enjoyed that class much more if I'd read  urlLink A Confederacy of Dunces  before taking it. I would have laughed at the fantastical absurdity of the book initially, then spent twelve weeks slackjawed, watching Kennedy's ridiculous character perfectly enfleshed in this medieval scholar. I have a certain respect to anyone who can devote his whole life--because medieval studies seems to be that kind of thing: a life choice--to studying worldviews no one else has cared about for hundreds of years.  Back to the point. It never fails to amaze me just how important relational geography is to the understanding I have of the context surrounding my life. Hopefully I'm not alone in this.  The next closest example was when I moved to Seattle. I'd been to Redmond previously via several routes: From the west into the  urlLink Redmond Town Center , from the east to the place I work, and from the south heading to breakfast via a surface street. It always seemed like a sprawling mess. Huge, with each intersection fanning out in 6 directions, the way all roads in Western Washington do. Then one day I came in from Highway 202, the Northwest I think. Along the way I passed some familiar landmarks, the Town Center, the  urlLink breakfast place , and eventually came to my office. each of these places was within a half-mile of the other. I had a feeling of intense vertigo, kind of like I do now, and everything quietly shifted into place, the map in my mind redrew itself. I felt more complete somehow.  This Idaho-Utah connection clears up a lot, and goes even farther than figuring out Redmond. I had a good friend who went to Ricks College in Rexburg, now known as  urlLink BYU-Idaho .  I never figured out why there was such a large Mormon population there. Turns out it's  urlLink closer  to Salt Lake City than Spokane is to Seattle. Go Figure. So my mind-map is redrawing itself. More than that though, I also feel a little bit closer to the kid who went to BYU-I, then to Mongolia, then dropped off the radar three years ago--like I understand him better because I have the geography of the situation worked out. I don't know if anyone is going to share this sentiment.    This blog is probably the most indulgent crap I've ever written. I can't expect anyone to enjoy reading this, I just felt like I had to write this feeling down somewhere.

      I got home late last night, ate dinner over a Friends rerun. I was too tired to get up and move to the closet when North Shore started. I still can’t decide if that was a good or a bad thing.  It’s a tough call because I realized something. There are a lot of terribly written TV shows. I mean   horrible   shows, shows with no redeeming value. Not only is North Shore utter shit, I felt like I was writing it in my head as I was watching. A character would say something, and I could tell,   more or less verbatim  , how the next however many lines of dialogue were going to go.  For a while I just thought I’d just built up a pretty good understanding of the TV drama formula over the years. I eventually realized that I knew what was coming next because I’d heard the lines before,   more or less verbatim  , on other shows, other movies, whatever.  The big wedding climax:     Girl:   Dad, I never felt that way about Morgan, I felt that way about Jason.   Girl’s Rich Asshole Dad:   Morgan is good for you.   Girl:   No, Dad, Morgan is good for you. Why don’t you marry him? I had the frame of mind to write that little exchange down, I’ve forgotten the rest.  If you’re having trouble placing that last little sentence, you heard it at every recess, everyday of your elementary school life.  I really wish I could remember some more of the conversations leading up to that, the entire hour was bloated with rehashed crap, dialogue that sucked the first time I heard it. Worse, the situations were entirely unbelievable, with two separate staged sex scenes—one of which involved characters who’d never talked before. More or less like this:      Slut who ends up being Rich Asshole Dad’s girlfriend  : Blah blah blah, this is the first time I’ve felt free in years, blah blah blah, is there room under that blanket for two?   Guy She Found Sleeping on the Beach  : (Feigned surprise) bwa ha (thrust). That room under the blanket line I actually do remember. Idiotic. Later, there was an instance of fisticuffs between the daughter of the asshole’s fiancée and the man who really loves her. God.  There is a word for this: Cliche. There are really many words for this, but that one sums them all up pretty nicely.  Afterward, I watched The Casino. It also sucked, even for reality TV. It was still better than North Shore by quite a bit.  So I guess that’s the missing link to why reality TV is so popular among executives. It’s not simply cheaper, it's actually better than the end product of some hack writer. You don’t have to pay shit writers to write shit stories around shit dialogue and you get roughly the same sex and violence quotient in more believable surroundings.  Like the Cottontail Ranch.  This is why I stopped watching TV in the first place.    Apropos of the  urlLink Little Black Book trailer , why does Britney Murphy--in her movies--always look like she’s been chasing Quaaludes with a punch in the face? I mean she's attractive, but she always looks haggard and a little strung-out, like the producers keep her locked in a root cellar when they're not shooting.          Thankfully, Ron Livingston looks like a dream, as always. He remains the celebrity who most closely approximates the nonchalant elegance of arch-friend  urlLink Ben Kromer .

      Just what I said. I'm supposed to be slogging through all the utter garbage that hasn't sold in the last 3 months and find a way to sell it.  This has, in effect, forced me to do a lot of thinking. I've concluded that I hate the title of my blog. It's not funny. It might have been cutely self-conscious at one time--but probably not. It sucks.  As much as it sucks, it will never be as bad as the Klingon-language   urlLink bo logh  , which is probably just Kingon for  blog.  Judging by his links, the guy appears to be at least an armchair linguist. I guess he thinks that makes this kind of hobby okay. Well it's not.  The tragedy is that I might be interested in what this person has to say. Blindly clicking his links is promising. Of the ones that aren't in Klingon, there are some discussing  urlLink civilization as social construct , etc. That's not a tough argument to make, but the point remains, this might be a worthwhile individual,   if he didn't speak a fake language  .  So now we're into the realm of the metaphysical.  Just what differentiates real language from a fake? Those are just labels. Labels cause wars.  I imagine any one of the previously mentioned trustafarians saying something like this. They and the Klingon enthusiasts are in league against me.  In the end, I defer to the greater wisdom of the  urlLink Portland Mercury , whose  urlLink Frank Burres  crystalized in  urlLink Qaolin  what I suspect of most Klingon/Human hybrids:   It is, of course, a strange road that leads one to this place, to a point in life where you apply makeup and a fake forehead, speak a fake language, go by a fake name, and practice twirling a fake sword so you can go to the bars.   Yes, it is a strange road indeed, and it begins in Iowa.   At least that's where it began for Qaolin, who back then was known only as Jim Covill, a struggling Art Education student who dressed less extravagantly, spoke only earthly tongues, and only sang karaoke occasionally in English (and by his own account, he sucked).   I don't know if it's an image thing for everyone who dresses and speaks like a Klingon (or a Jedi or an Elf), but I bet the percentage is huge.  The blog has a poll with a total of 6 possible responses. Only one is in English. It says, "huh?? What??". Cute. 91% of voters picked that one. The sample is obviously skewed because the poll appears on a Klingon-language blog so obviously more voters will be able to speak Klingon. Still, 91% is not   nearly   high enough. If society is indeed a social construct, then I'm all in to do some  urlLink deconstruction .  Incidently, after reading a few  more  of the non-Klingon links (ex.  urlLink 1 , urlLink 2 , urlLink 3 ), I've narrowed my possible grad school fields of study by one. I'm definitely not going to study linguistics. These people are all obsessing over some pointless and picky-flicky minutia. I guess it was too much to hope that all linguists had the gravity of the only two linguists I've ever really read,  urlLink Wittgenstein  and  urlLink Chomsky --more naive still that I'd assume linguists didn't tell jargon-laced linguist jokes the way engineers tell engineer jokes and on and on.  So thank you  bo logh .  I have a feeling I'm going to open my blog tomorrow and it's going to be bare except for some strange tongue scrawled in paint.  It will all seem very mysterious but will turn out to just be "OMG Yr teh sUx" or "Worf for President".

      All this revolution talk reminded me of a movie that looks really good. It's called  urlLink The Motorcycle Diaries  and is about Che Guevara's road trip through South America. It was, apparently, a life-changing experience. The film doesn't seem to bother directly with the worldview he would form later in life, though the trip marked the beginning of his Marxist leanings. I'm sick to death of politics; if this is a manifesto piece, rivers will run red with my fury.  That pouty-mouthed succubus you loved the hell out of in  urlLink Amores Perros  and  urlLink Y Tu Mama Tambien ,  urlLink Gael Garcia Bernal , is Che. No one really saw  urlLink The Crime of Padre Amaro , which is good because it sucked, but he's pretty fantastic in all of those movies.  The trailer I saw starts out with a few quotes, which are wildly divergent and hilarious. Jean-Paul Sartre called him, "the most complete human being of our age." Sartre had a tendency to exaggerate, so I'm going to assume he's not really that great. I wonder, though, is Sartre praising Guevara or deriding everyone else? I'm not sure.  The American Spectator was less ambiguous: "Che is a cultural icon because of his ability to provoke empathy among the spoiled youth of the affluent west."   It's funny, that is   exactly   how I think of the guy. My first glimpse of Che was that famous picture, Warholized onto a two-tone red and black bumper sticker, on the back of some hemp-festooned kid's twinkling yellow Range Rover. There were also the thousands of shirts and posters all over campus, each with the   exact same likeness  . Needless to say, his place as the commander-in-chief and defacto messiah of the  urlLink Trustafarian  army has earned him a place of scorn in my heart.  So, at the very worst, this movie will make me rethink my preconceptions of the man himself and his motivations.  At best, though, I see this being the road movie buddy flick I've been pining for since I saw Easy Rider .  I tend to get too excited about these kinds of movies. I'm obviously setting myself up for disappointment.   Example:  urlLink Maria Full of Grace --that was a really hackneyed segue because MFoG has none of the elements that make up a "road movie buddy flick"--I'm just struggling for synergy.  Regardless, I saw it last night and it let me down, but only because I desperately wanted it to be the   best movie ever  . It's fair to say I was disappointed because it wasn't the movie I imagined it was going to be. Maybe I'm being unfair. Lots of critics are saying that it documents with grim precision and attention to detail the job of the drug mule. It does. And that's exactly my problem with it.  It's entirely too much a documentary, despite being fiction. The camera is too unsympathetic; the screenplay doesn't know what it's trying to say. I hate films that preach too much, that donkey punch you with their message. You leave the theatre feeling cheap and violated, like the filmmakers didn't trust you to extract their urgent message from the subtleties of narrative voice and characterization. So they beat you with it. That bugs me. I have thousands of inferiority complexes and I don't like being talked down to, especially when I'm paying 9 dollars for the honor.  Last night, though, I would have welcomed some abuse. There's a line that demarcates arrogant proselytizing from the complete objectivity that makes a movie pointless.   It's a big line  . Most movies fall on this line.   There is really no excuse for not being on this line  . You can land on this line even with standoffish camera work and ambivalent narration, as long as there is emotion in the script. MFoG lacks that big time. Maria never even really fights for herself, how can Joshua Marsten expect us to want to fight for her? This is all the more frustrating because I can see the film Marsten was trying to make, and   that   film--I think--I would have really enjoyed.  I said before it was too much a documentary, but it's not even that. The characters are so insipid and bewildered by their plight that no one would mistake this for a film documenting real people.  There is little life here, just action.  What life I saw on screen is the direct result of some vitally brilliant acting by Catalina Sandino Moreno. She was almost enough to pull the hulking mass of Marsten's script onto that big ass line--maybe she did, I'll have to think about that. I can't wait for her to get a script that more fully showcases her excruciating amount of talent.    crap . . . it looks like I'm in the    urlLink   1% of people      who didn't think this movie was the second coming. I bet every one of those reviewers has a Che Guevara hoodie somewhere in their closet . . . Only one other guy, Stephen Witty, had  urlLink more criticism than praise . This is annoying because I don't think I really like  urlLink his other opinions . Oh well.

      I forgot about this, we also have all the significant ports. The East Coast is less thoroughly liberal than the west, but  urlLink Mike is right  about the move to the right being less severe as you head west from NYC. So even if we couldn't hold the east coast as convincingly, that's not a big deal, all the good shit comes from China and SE Asia anyway, one well-placed bomb to the Panama Canal and the conservatives would be in dire straits. They'd have to head south around Argentina y Chile, and I'm betting there are tens of thousands of  urlLink REI Lifetime Members  who know Patagonia like the back of their hands. I see them riding  urlLink Guanacos  across the tundraed plain, stark, craggy mountains rising in the distance like a tide of blue doom.   Their light sabers wildly aglow in the half-light as superstitious Chinese sea captains turn back their charges, returning to    urlLink   Shanghai      half-crazed, babbling about the man-demons riding furry horses bareback through South America  . No, they'll have to find another way to exploit China's cheap labor force, the penguins and llamas are on our side.  Don't worry about Canadian ports, they voluntarily chose universal healthcare--they're on our side by default, especially those in BC. Siding with the Conservatives would eventually lose them their unofficial cash-crop, Marijuana.  Smuggling things via the ol' silk road through Europe wouldn't really work for them either as the conservatives have been bitching for YEARS that Europe is more or less communist (utterly without merit), and we all know how much animosity comes from the mainland of that continent focused   directly   at one George W Bush. I don't think we have to worry about the Arabian Peninsula for reasons that don't need explanation. That leaves them what, India? A slow boat 3/4s of the way around the world from China? Not likely. And we can get South Africa if we need to, Mandela is a  urlLink HUGE Che Guevara fan , he can be turned.  Oil could be tough, though. We'd have to secure Alaska right-quick, then put the scientists to work on alternative fuels--and light sabres.

      This blog,  urlLink Smacktooth , mentioned an article the author read (which he can't find) about how the polarization of our country is setting us really close to the brink of civil war. That seems a bit far-fetched, though I'm sure someone somewhere wrote an article about it.  Here's his recollection of the article:   The paper talked about the right wings attempts to take over the fundamentals of America again and how they were making giant leaps and bounds under the feeding of George Bush and his administration. The right is well know for stroking the desires of the underclass, like racism, bigotry, and popular anger, and making them seem ok to rally against publicly. Now is as good a time as ever to do it in the post-9/11 environment. America has not had an enemy so easily spotted in ages to gather its forces and opinions against. Now that the uninformed, the uneducated, and the ill mannered can pinpoint a single enemy by the color of his skin, the right has found its launching point and has attacked its issues like a starving dog on meat. "If you're not against them, you’re against us." They've managed to polarize the country in delicate and specific ways not seen on our soil since the first civil war or the civil rights movements of the 60s and 70s, which can now be called a cold civil war.  The paper predicted the election would be close; with rumors flying from both sides of vote fixing that only polarize people into larger groups. Florida would again be a key issue state and where fighting would probably break out first, but in short bursts. It would be escalated by the calling in of the National Guard by Jeb at his brothers urging in the weeks following the election to help the police keep order and ending with the citizens eventually attacking them. The fighting would spread through the bible belt the fastest as the issue would take on people own individual angers and the "believers" would turn on the non. Public violence would die down and flare up for years to come. It wouldn't be a full out fighting civil war because that would involve the turning of massive military units and their commanders. It would most likely be "terrorist activities" against government structures that would unite groups to fight. An "underground militia" would be born and would grow quickly till a national commander was named and he or she would be tagged as equal to bin Laden in Americas common enemy. Assassinations would be common, but mob violence would be sparse in the long run. The economy would suffer from the loss of companies transferring overseas to a more stable location where the government would be more willing to crush revolt, like China or Japan.   This leaves me with some questions. The national head of this underground obviously wouldn't be a public figure, but would he answer to one in a round about way? Would this be to the Republican Party what the IRA is to Shinn Fein or Hamas is to the PLO? Seems unlikely because the connection between the militant groups and the respective parties in both of those cases grew from the feeling of disenfranchisement and futility that came from working through political channels. As the Republicans are currently in power, it doesn't seem like the militancy could grow in that way.   Though it would be a good way to keep power, as Republicans are traditionally considered tougher on crime and better with defense and whatnot. That's only if they could keep themselves distanced from the militants.   So all in all I'm not sure how this militant violence would help the Republicans solidify power . . . though I think the basic point of their catering to an ignorant, prejudiced, fundamentalist base is more or less right on.  The guerrilla angle is more plausible, but   way less interesting than an all out lefty vs. righty throwdown  . I've been contemplating the logistics of this since smacktooth brought it up. At first I thought our--the left's--chances in full-scale conflict would be pretty slim. I thought we'd get crushed, looking out from my west coast perch over the sea of sociopaths known in the common tongue as the midwest. Plus, other than Clark, I assumed that all military men were Conservatives. So if there was a turning of millitary leaders, most of them would side with the right. Frightening.  Then I remembered an analysis I read in Time--which I can't access here because you have to pay for access to archived articles. Anyways, the gist was that Americans with with college degrees were just as deeply polarized as the nation at large. The divide is more or less along the lines of major. People with liberal arts and sciences degrees tend overwhelmingly to be leftist. Business majors are conservative. Looking at the chief beneficiaries of Bush's tax plan gives proof enough of this.  In that I found hope. While the bible-belters are creating a rigid and labyrinthine bureaucracy charged with running their war machine, the hippy leftists will all form communes dedicated to this and that: effective, eco-friendly weaponry; hemp uniforms; fusion power etc etc. We'd obviously have light sabres. We'd also have the buddhist warrior monks (I'm talking some Shaolin shit, not the Tibetan Buddhists), the yogis--all the crazy eastern religion/martial arts shit. We'd have Tarrantino for rousing soundtracks.  So the trick would be surviving the initial onslaught. Catching and holding them in a war of attrition, probably somewhere in the Rockies is the key. The mountain terrain would leave their hulking tanks ineffective and highly succeptible to the guerrilla campaign by the Forest Service/Green Peace brigade. I imagine some crazy Endor shit going down there, the M1 Abrams tank as useless as the AT-AT walker against the eco-terrorists and forest rangers. Our troops will be better able to handle the psychological trauma of the long mountain standoff because we'll have Tibetan Buddhist chaplains teaching the 8 fold path to the cessation of worldly pain. The Christian Ascetics can come along too.  Once we're deadlocked in the mountains and the seige begins, having most of the scientists and theoreticians will allow us to far outstrip their research and development pace. That's when we get light sabres. These, in the confident and near clairvoyant hands of the buddhist warrior monks, the tide will more or less turn. The yogis will be effective sabboteurs, as they can reverse-digest all manner of contraband and weaponry via the anus and reproduce it at vital moments.  I feel good about our chances.
