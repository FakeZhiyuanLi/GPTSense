       Here's just a few tips on making neopoints.  1. Play the games. Especially the featured game because it pays you x2 what you'd normally make on the game.   2. If you do not have a shop, create one. Keep your shop stocked at all times.  3. If you happen to buy an item that others sell for less than the main shops sell it for, try to avoid buying that item again. But go out into the market place and buy from the ones who set prices way to low!  4. Go by the shop wizard's prices to get an idea of a price that you are comfortable with. Just try to keep that price reasonable. If it's too high, people will not buy from your shop.  5. I buy the scratchcards, and I scratch them myself instead of selling them.

      And For That  For nine months you carried me inside of you showing your love for me without even knowing who I was. Although you had a hard time, you still chose to give me life. And for that, I thank you.  Later as I began to grow up, you went beyond all limits of patience even when I gave you a hard time. You always understood me as only you could. And for that, I admire you.  You slaved by cooking and cleaning making sure that I had everything any child could possibly ever need. And for that, I love you.  There were so many times I never let you know how very deeply I appreciated all of your time and effort. And for that, I am sorry.  You never complained when your mornings started at five, and I would sleep until the last moment. And for that, I cherish you.  Now that I am also a woman, I remember how harsh and brutal your life truly was. You endured so much personal abuse while I was growing up. And for that, I immortalize you.  When I look at you through the eyes of another person instead of your little girl, I see the strength and courage that I myself hope one day to possess. And for that, Mom, I idolize you.  copywrite 2003 Inner-Peace

             "ANGELS IN DISGUISE"  Angels are in heaven, or so the saying goes. But, god sent angels from his kingdom in the disguise of our little children.  A look of innocence fills their eyes as they see the beauty in God's world. A rainbow after a hard rain, the speed of a fast moving train, and even prairie dogs roaming the plains.  Just look into their eyes, and it will be plain you won't find any stains like the kind grown-ups receive from life's pain.   Everyday's a new experience for these angels in disguise. They put their trust in everybody never expecting their own demise by predators who envy or despise.  How very sad it is, for these angels in disguise, that some people never see they are God's most precious prize.  copywrite 2003 Inner-Peace

       This is another one of my poems that I wrote. I wrote this one in 1999.       BY THE RIVERS EDGE    Down by the river's edge I sit anxiously waiting for the sun to set knowing that the radiant beauty of the sky, with its purple,pink, and reddish hues, will soon be visible to the naked eye.    As I sit and stare in peaceful awe, I can feel God tremendously close gently caressing my face in the form of the river's soothing wind bringing me peace from deep within.    I can feel my troubles slowly fade miraculously being carried away with the ebb of the river's tide as its washing my troubled soul and once again restoring me whole.    The sky has now turned a dark gray, and I rise to leave the river's edge turning to give a tranquil glance and whisper, thank you for making me feel renewed so I can face my morn anew.
