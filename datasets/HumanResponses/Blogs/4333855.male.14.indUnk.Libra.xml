        I'm starting over again, sharing this with Matt. So let me introduce myself yet again for the 500th god - damned time tonight.  My name is Nicole, and my boyfriend is Matt. I'm 14 years old. Time's up! That's all you need to know for now.  I really have nothing to say right now besides the fact that I am really on edge today. I'm just stressed about school and stuff. But oh well, I get to see Matt tomorrow so it will be okay. I'm just really annoyed and aggravated with things and I have the urge to scream right now from all this, but I'm resisting the urge. I hope tomorrow goes faster because I'm not really adapting well to school. The day just drags on and on while I listen to dumb people talk and yell and gossip. I'm really not in the best of moods tonight, but I'm talking with Matt, and that's always nice therapy.  ~Nikki~

      This is really cool. Wow! I'm making a blog with my girlfriend....BINGOYO! Oh, don't worry about that (the Bingoyo thing). While you read this blog, you'll see plenty of little sayings and phrases that we both coined. Trust me, she's got some  weird  ones!  Don't get me wrong though, Nikki's a great girl. Five months behind us to prove it. Well, almost five months. Sunday will mark exactly five months. (For those of you geniuses out there, that means we've been together since March 29)  Whoa, almost forgot, I'm Matt. That other person you see posting is my girlfriend, Nikki. Her real name is Nicole, but Nikki sounds cool. I'm 14, I'll be 15  exactly  a month from today. I'm a freshman in high school, and today was my second day of school. This is my second blog. I kept one over the summer, and it was really just a practice for me, to see how Blogger worked. Now that I understand it, I felt like starting a new one. On the same night (tonight), Nikki was going to start on Blogger after moving over from Diaryland. Suddenly, inspiration hit ( like a brick in the face ) and BAM! ( brick ) I had an idea! What if me and Nicole did a web log  together !? Oh my God, Matt! Yousa fucking genius! Alright, settle down, hold your applause. To make a long story short, Nicole agreed, and she picked out the template, and now here we are! I hope you all enjoy this, because I've found that keeping a journal is  extreme immense  psychological therapy. It's my favorite thing to do in the world, write. But now....I get to share it with my favorite person in the world.      Currently Listening To:         Modest Mouse - Float On        Quote of the Day:         Principal of my high school (an 50, 60 year old woman):       "If every student in this school did all of their homework, we'd have honor students out the wazzoo!"
