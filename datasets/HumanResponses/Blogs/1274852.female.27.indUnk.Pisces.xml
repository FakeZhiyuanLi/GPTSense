(heres their site " http://www.bigfish.tv " )   i think i went okay.. they had a test ready.. which i had to sit for 2hrs. the guy briefly showed me a file prepared by the other person they've been looking at.. it was all nicly finished.. but that person took 3hrs. i didnt fully finish it in 2hrs becasue i was stuck bamboozled for 20mins at the start..(the library i was meant to set up, was already TOO set up, the guy came and ungrouped it back to square 1 for me but.. id prefer to start from scratch.) I think i did a good job.. the guys checkin the file this arvo, and hopefully he likes the way i prepared/labelled/organized/animated the shizznit.  GOOD LUCK TO ME!!..  "I even wore my Monkey T-shirt Bru brought back from HK... i could be a dope Flash Monkey" Yesterday at the interview i told them...

      You didn't bore me, although I'm a little familiar with some of the names/styles having lived in HK for all those years.  Dad is a black belt too in Kung Fu...used to go on about chi all the time when we were little....we'd play these 'games' where he'd stand behind us and move us forward with his chi.  Pretty mad stuff when you're 7!  Anyway, seeing as Mint has asked for a nickname to use on this blog, let's put our heads together and come up with something.  I came up with Salsa Sista, Hot Sauce and Pepper Mint because she is such a hottie but I don't know if ninesuns would approve.  Any more suggestions?

      To me ninesuns is not rally a wu name though it is based on a kung fu character. Nine Suns Kung-Fu is the style of Kung Fu used by a character called Tiger Wong in the HK comic "Oriental Heroes". Been a fan for years, it stopped printing in 1993 and issues are really, really scarce. Anyway it is not the physical style of kung-fu that most people learn. It is almost a form of meditation that allows you to harness your "chi" or "ki"(Japanese) which you can either use to shield yourself or dispense via your physical style. For instance you can use Yih Gun Prayer(Chi) with 18 Dragon Slaying Palms(Physical). This allows you to sustain and dispense immense superhuman punishment. Anyway it is a cool comic book and I really the ideas, concepts and names in Kung-Fu. The styles, moves and characters also have cool names like:  Yih Gun Prayer, Fu Yee Challenger, Golden Armour, Heart Demolishing Shovel, Infinity White, Boundless Circle, 18 Dragon Slaying Kicks, Lightning Across the Hill, the Helldragon's stroke. Although I've always loved symbolic names from any culture/story. The Native Americans have great names like Thunder rolling down from the Mountains, Crazy Horse and Son of Star. Gangster names are also pretty cool: The Saint, Easy Win, Crtitcal Bill, Sonny Red, Sonny Black, The Man with the Plan, Little Caesar. Other chinese names are really cool too like the Phoenix Fledgling, The Great Intellect, The Swift God of Death, The Vanguard of the West, The Stringless Bow, The Nine Dragoned and Pillar of the Ninth Heaven. The number nine features heaps as it is lucky.   Hope I haven't bored you guys too much but I just love names that have some meaning... Peace

      Bowling was awesome.  The funny thing is, I also got a text message from the bowling alley saying that   I   had actually won for not participating in psyche-outs.  Methinks there is much shenanigans going on.  Big up to ninesuns on locating the spot.  Sounds beautiful, we love Coolangatta.  Have got the date in the diary - will get rec. leave from work a couple o' months before so that I don't miss the big day.  Can't decide if I should get into Big Brother or not.  A bit over it.  Said that the last two years though, heh heh.    Back to Saturday night; didn't like the wannabe Rage Against the Machine band - do we know if Bru has found his pulse yet?  Mick was 84, Bez & Zoe 91, Ant 90 and Bru 56, 0, and 47 respectively.  We're mates with the undead!!!  More bowling please....

      Bowling sounded like mad fun. Big ups to all those whom attended the resurrection of "the team". Support was much appreciated and hope it continues. The spirit of goodwill made my heart soar like an eagle. Just wait till we actually start playing well, ninesuns "walks upon clouds" kung fu is in effect. I'm gonna talk to Bez about the jerey design this week. We may even be able to get the jerseys here in 3 weeks if al goes well. We''ll have to work on it though. Spent Friday looking for our wedding spot and found it at Rainbow Bay, Coolangatta Apex Park, Sept .19. LTJ "Stands upon a Mountain at Sea" Kung Fu will ost definitely be in the Hizzie.   Peace and shout outs to all my LTJ brothas and sistahs.

      Bowling was mad on Friday. I won both games by default.... we thought Mick had actually won it, narrowly scraping in by 1 point both games over bruha... but to my surprise.. when i got home.. there was a text message on my phone from the bowling alley saying that they had revised the scores.. and that I, infact, had won "by default".  Fuck.. you'd imagine my surprise. yeah, they said that they other jerks were cheatin.. doing dodgy psyche-outs, and because i was such a good sport... I HAD WON. FANTASTIC. I'll have to congratulate the other losers later... but all's fair.. im a good sport.. and i couldnt have done it with out my 'white russian'. BEEAAAAHHHWWWWWWWWWWW!!!! MEEAEAAAAGHHH!!!! FLLAAAAAAAAANNNNNNDDDDEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSSSSSSSSSS!!! "SHUT THE FUCK UP DONNIE!!" "YOUR ENTERIN A WORLD OF PAIN!!" "12yr olds dude."

      The game was dope; you guys only lost by a little and can only get better.  Thanks to Mint for the muffin....yum!  Very excited about the chocolate and tan - we are also thinking of getting some bowling shirts made....we are going bowling at Milton tomorrow night.  Probably because we saw the Big Lebowski again a day or two ago.  Beza is definitely The Dude.

      I think graff is the way to go and who better to do a piece for it but one of the LTJ cru?  We could hold a competition or something.  Jurquette is ready and excited about the return to court - I hope they still do chicken chippies at Carina.    I'd like some red on the uniform please.  It's a good colour.  LTJ cru rocked it at Byron - got Roy Ayers' autograph and made Diore a very happy man with his birthday present.  Much fun was also had at the Brothers Stoney gig......the place was full of loud and aggressive persons so I fit in quite well.  We met lots of new people, saw Diors at Sun Bar then went to the Pancake Manor for breakfast.  Jurquette and Porse had druken barney whilst Bru tried to make himself invisible.  All was forgiven the next morning as Porse had the bad headache and Jurquette had the strong painkillers....as Roy Ayers would say "Love.....will bring us back together...."

      I'm running out of uniforms for the team this thursday. By my guesstimate up to 2 team memebrs may not have our old silver Tenchu jerseys. Which I might add are still the best jerseys going around. I've tried tracking some of our old jerseys but still waiting to hear back from people. Therefore I think new jerseys are in order. Put up some suggestions of colour schemes. I'm thinking orange and white or maybe sky blue and white (jordan brand colour scheme). I'm tossing up the idea of using some graff as the logo as well. What do you guys think?

      Hi all. This is my first post to this blog or any other. Porse Wan and I, ninesuns, will be playing ball for the first time in years this Thursday. Come along if you want to see a bunch of guys try to re-live their youth. Southsiders descend to the court once more. It should be a classic not to be missed... Peace

      Didn't do a whole lot this weekened but was quite busy. Went to Uni all Sunday and finished my lectures for one subject...finally. I also helped Mint with her assignment and Saw a couple of DVDs, "Made" and Poltergeist. Made was hilarious, Vince Vaughn plays a really annoying character which makes it very difficult to watch sometimes. But that's what nakes it funny. P-Diddy also makes an appearance as the gangster Ruiz. I recommend it and if you want a lend I've got it on DVD. Didn't intend to, but to caught up with a whole lot of people this weekend through chance encounters. Looking forward to De La Soul and the end of the semester. Thanks for putting up that link to the matrix analysis site. Let us know if everyone has seen it so that we can start discussing it.  Hope you feel better Jurquette. Good to see Porse starting to post. Disappointed I missed Eurovision. Give us the lowdown on the african fest. Feeling guilty about not hanging out with alll you guys more.   Top 5 things wrong with my employer  1. Nepotism 2. Corruption 3. Negative Culture 4. Red Tape 5. Lies, Rumours and Half-truths

      Yo LTJ crew whut up?!  Had the shittest day at work today.  This one man on the phone was so rude and mean to me, I cried for about half an hour and all the way home on the bus I was sniffling like the big girl that I am.  Luckily, BB was on when I got in and I got to vent my emotions at Ben and dumb dumb boi Saxon.  Phew!  Crisis averted.    How good were Estonia on the Eurovision last night?  They deserved to win - I did like Turkey too, thank fuck Tatu didn't win.  Spain had the bootiest chick.  Maki rang up just before it started because he was so excited.......he should be hooking up with us at the African Fest. on Saturday.    A little reminder that there are drinks at Ki this Friday from 5:30 onwards.  Not a huge night but a few quiet cocktails would be nice.  I really hope to see you all there....you don't have to stay long!  Yes, Beza I do have a dong, gonna shove it up yer jacksie the next time I see ya! *not kidding*  ; P  I like Reggie more and more everytime I see her but she slipped again tonight because she didn't vote for Ben; he's been a turd to her.

      You know what they say about people with big blogs......  Anyway, everyone has a bad game now and again - you guys are doing really good for a team that has not played together in aaaaages and are not training at present.  You shouldn't be so hard on yourself ninesuns.  It will all come together.   As for Donnie Darko, I thought it had more cohesion than say, Mulholland Drive which I loved, saw at least three times but still said 'what the...?'.  I did the same as you ninesuns, went on an internet mish to find out what I was missing - David Lynch the director was so oblique about the movie - which I actually liked, didn't think it was a cop out at all because at the end of the day the movie left you with a feeling. What more could you want? I think it is a deliberate method of film-making  that some innovative directors employ to offset this world of Hollywood formula.  That's why it fucks with you so much because we are so used to being guided along by 'the plot'.  Great example would be The Ring - Japanese vs. Hollywood version.  Enjoyed both but you can see how too much story and too much justification for events can screw with the overall atmosphere of a film.  Man, I am so dealing with a similar situation ninesuns, with people/a person at work - when we were in training there was someone there who was very experienced and knew a lot about the subject matter but had to use every opportunity to display, outdo, needlessly question and lord it over the whole group.  It impeded our learning and bugged the hell out us.  And you're absolutely right, you can tell when questions are asked as a challenge and as an affirmation that they are smarter than everyone else including the trainer.  Luckily I have a fantastic manager who deals with that person very well.  I remember after a particularly gruelling session I wrote in my book 'She uses her knowledge like a weapon...'.  And guess what, I have to sit next to this person everyday and she doesn't like me.  I would like to be able to see the good or 'buddha nature' in everyone and it upsets me that I am drawn into bitching about this person because it is so negative; I don't want to do it.  But people's actions affect you sometimes no matter how detached you try to be.  So this is my personal challenge.  I have been reading a lot of Buddhist teachings and I think I know which way I'm going to go with it.  I'll let you know how it goes.

      Looking forward to actually playing some good ball next week because I played VERY badly last night. My passing has been the only thing I have done well this year but last night I stank up the joint. Many of my passes were way off the mark. The team as a whole however seems to be getting better. I think our play has improved every week. My goals this season are to dominate the paint and be an effective rebounder and defender. Unlike many of the other guys on the team my involvement in organised basketball did not include running set offences. I know what to do when I play on the outside but I'm getting a bit lost in the paint. I did have success when I played in the Filipino league but that was because they usually played a very tight man/zone defense. It's weird but beacuse they played such tight defense it cuts your options... so you actually make better decisions. If there is only one thing you can do... you do it. No hesitation, no decision, just reaction. In this league they give you more space so I get mixed up and often run to the wrong places. Hopefully I'll get better and if you watch me play, try and notice how lost I look out there sometimes.  Just finished another assignment on Wednesday. Only have exams to go this semester. I'm not enjoying one of my subjects this semester and it shows in my marks. I really dislike the subject and also the lecturer. The content and delivery leave a lot left to be desired. But some of the students are absolutely f!@*ed up. One student ,whom is a HR manager, piped up in class and stated they weren't getting enough out of the subject. They went on to say that their company was paying them $50 per hour to be in the class. How f%&#ing arrogant and disrespectful. How would they like it if I came into their workplace and said the same thing. What the f*&# is wrong with people. I pity the organisation that has this person as their HR manager. BTW if they're  a HR manager then what the f%$k are they doing in an introductory HR subject. Just to top this all off, they went on to say that they earned by far more than their spouse does. That spouse should be given a f*$%ing medal for putting up with this person and all of their s#@t.  What is it anyway with manager postgrad students. Most are really good. They are open to new ideas and usually have a great amount of respect for lecturers, students and the learning process. However there are a few that have been downright rude and are grandstanding. Usually they are managers puffed up full of with their own self-importance. I say if you are there to learn then you make a commitment to listen to what the lecturer has to say. Don't sit there and constantly probe,contradict and challenge the lecturer. It slows down the learning process for everyone else. I wouldn't mind if the questions were valid or searched for a deeper understanding but usually they are just looking to prove that they are "smart". If they think they know all the answers... then why are they IN the class. In my book this is grandstanding and has no place in the classroom. This is what annoys me about managers that are postgrad students.    My interest has been piqued by Donnie Darko. I didn't really understand the story. It kind of bothers me beacuse rightly or wrongly I think I'm usually pretty good at this sort of stuff. Well apparently I'm not alone. Look up the web and you'll find many links to posts asking if anyone has seen an analysis of the movie. I have found a few good ones.   http://www.ozcraft.com/scifidu/donnie_theories.html http://www.metaphilm.com/philms/donniedarko.html  I think there may be no real thread or theme that ties the whole movie together. Just a number of mysteries and events that are linked through the main character Donnie and it is up to you to join the dots any way youlike. Even the writer/director said that it is open to interpretation. Sometimes I think this is valid and thought provolking and sometimes I think it's a copout for plot holes. In this case I believe it to be the former. One reviewer put it best when they said the movie tried to match the theory of time travel with the fear of dying alone. A combination I would never have come up with in a hundred years. I tip my hat to the writer on this one. It is compelling nonethless.

      Mick and I will see it this weekend.  Most of the Jerks have already seen it.  Ben from BB3 so needs a bitchslap.  I thought I hated Carlo but he was just a pig.  Ben is a nasty piece of work.  Put on 2 kgs this weekend.  No more gourmet pizza for this Jurque.  The mound of haloumi cheese didn't help either. : (

      You should all watch Matrix Reloaded. I've seen it twice already. Once at midnight on thursday with my class and once with friends. It was good to coming to class at 8am after the movie finished at 2am. It didn't seem as good as the first but I think all the hype affected me. I still loved it even though Neo looks like he's made of plastic in some of the CG sequences.  What I was really impressed with was how they used a real hacking exploit when Trinity was hacking into the systems in the powerplant (it was the SSH1 CRC32 exploit, she also used the Nmap port scanner to find a vulnerable SSH server). They resisted the urge to use colourful graphics and animations during the hacking scene.  Can't wait till Matrix 3.

      I can't remember what I thought either; memory like a sieve.  I do remember there was a huge amount of discourse after the flick - we watched it twice.  He did go back in time and made the choice to stay in bed.  It was about fear of death and his confrontation of that fear - he was so afraid of being alone, dying alone......he was happy in the end.  I found it quite uplifting.  Anyway, will probably watch it again for the engine bit to work out the time line.  Dude, sorry to hear about your Thursday night......there was a lunar eclipse that night which was meant to send out some serious  obstacles.  We had the news about having to sell the Pajero for my folks; there was a lot of tension around the last few days.  Should be all over by tomorrow.  Also, Mercury goes direct so there will be a lot less minor glitches and things will speed up a bit, yay!  Mystic Zoe's predictions for the rest of the month.

      Sounds like you guys had a good time at Grand Master Flash. We definitely had a much quieter weekend.   I was very disappointed Thursday night. We lost, I did my toe again and didn't go to see Krush. I went to the doctor instead. So the night ended up costing me $110. $50 for 2 tickets and $60 for the doctor visit. It wasn't too bad I guess, I think the universe is telling me to slow down. I had to work the next day anyway and Krush will come here again... maybe in 2008. On Friday night I found that I had lost my CD with heaps of mp3s on it, felt disappointed for a while.   Spent more money on the weekend. I've got to control my spending. With the jerseys, bball, movies etc I've really gone off the rails. Matrix was good though. We have a theory but won't spoil it for the others that haven't watched yet. Talk about it later. I too missed the trailer for the 3rd movie. Will go to watch it again. Also saw DOnnie Darko and Ghost Ship. I though Donnie Darko was a really good film. Definitely creepy in parts. The guy who plays Donnie is also in Bubble Boy and Fresh says that I kinda look like him. Anyway what do you guys think happened. Did Donnie see a future timeline in the instant he woke up and choose to stay in bed or did he in fact go back in time to change history. One thing that doesn't make sense is the engine. The engine is the item which changes the space time continuum. If Donnie died by being hit by the engine, where did the plane come from. The plane doesn't fly out for another month. So the wormhole is still there. could it be that this timeline will revert again at the end of the month and begin again. Forming a loop. Anyway how !@#$ing creepy was the rabbit. Maybe the story isn't so strightforward and its an allegory for another idea. What do you guys think.  I also spent far too much time playing Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom. I tell you what, you let people out from under your thumb and they attack. Like Machiavelli says people don't rebel when the hammer is all the way down. The rebelling city states will soon taste my wrath.

I would have sucked GMS's dick if he'd played Justin Timberlake - now that is taking a DJ risk and not giving a mother-fucking fuck.

      Good to hear that you enjoyed your game ninesuns.  Once again, won't get to make the game tonight - will be getting a massage and facial - almost as good as seeing the team play but not quite.  Don't worry about Top 5s, they are fun, they are fluid and that's what's good about a blog, you can make amendments at any time.  For example, I'd like to add Kool Keith to mine and remove Eminem.  I don't think I could attempt a Top 5 movies but I could do a 'Top 5 at the mo' which is in the spirit of Top 5s anyway.....but I need to think about it first.  Excited to see these jerseys!

      Played ball last night at Cornubia and had a pretty good game I thought. Only shot the ball 3 times and had 4 points but I got  few rebounds and a few assists so I was happy. I am running consistently too which is helping. Hope to repeat a similar performance tonight. Also looking forward to watching Krush tonight. I'm embarassed to say this but I haven't heard almost any of his stuff. What I have heard I have liked and always an artist I thought I should start listening to. Maybe it will spark a stronger inetrest. Similar thing happened with DJ Shadow. Hadn't heard all of his stuff but at least I had heard his latest album and a few mixes so I had some exposure. What I am not looking forward to is getting home at 1 - 1:30 at getting up to go to work next morning.   The jerseys are really strating to grow on me. I had them hanging all over the house last night and from a small distance away the jerseys actually come up looking beautiful. You know I wouldn't mind in afew months to try our hand at these jerseys again but strictly if you want them for yourself. The team will keep the current jerseys at least till next year.    Watched the final survivor last night and felt bad that Matt only got one vote. I felt that he really was "the survivor". Yeah he did deceive and manipulate but so did everyone else. In fact he did it markedly less than everyone except for Butch. I think a lot of people mistook his intensity and focus for being crazy. A travesty. Spare me this mockery of justice. That's all I've got to say about that.      Got another assignment due this weekend so won't be doing too much again. However I will take some time out to watch the Matrix Reloaded. Get ready to be Matriculated. Peace to my LTJ brothas and sistahs.   Top 5 MCs  1. KRS One 2. Busta Rhymes 3. Kool Keith 4. Flava Flav 5. The guys from Das Efx   My top 5 movies   1. Magnificent Seven (The best film, with the best lines, best actors, best theme tune.. even though its a remake of Seven Samurai) 2. Akira (Saw it when we were 14 and it took us over an hour just to walk to the train station, definitely worth it)  3. Goodfellas (Probably the best gangster film of all time) 4. The New One Armed Swordsman & The Big Boss (Chris and I saw these films and we have never been the same since)  5. Ninja Scroll (After Akira has converted the most people to Anime, a masterpiece) & Spirited Away (An awesome film)    I know I doubled up on a few but I had to, A top 5 is too limiting and I love movies. These movies all had a big impact on me. However a film not in the list which is one of my all time faves which had a huge impact on me was "Office Spce". I was really stressed out at the time, had a bad job and felt really bad about myself. I was inspired to just take it easy and immidiately strated wearing sneakers to work. Nuff said.

Unfortunatly i dont get paid till the following Thursday, but i might be able to borrow some cash of my parents or something. I was worried they might come out skin colour.. hence making me look more whitey (thats why i lead the push for chocolate) but ah well... Fuckin awesome. Can you post a flick? Hell keen to see how they turned out.  The hoodies are Fiddy bones, and the Tshirts/chick tees are $25. No rush.. i think he got a fair few printed up if ya keen later on.  TOP 5 EMCEES: (in no particular order)  1) TIT (dont go unrecognised) 2) Bru 3) Porzee 4) Diorz 5) Abbolish  LTJ WIZZUP!!  6) Bez J. Ruck

      I like the hoodie too Bez. Unfortunately with all the costs this month I won't be able to afford it. How much are they?  The jerseys are here. They did not exactly blow me away but they are starting to grow on me. However we have to thank the efforts of the of Vince's Dad, the tailor and Vince for gettin us the jerseys so quickly. The jerseys were rushed as the tailor basically had only 4 days to complete 17 jerseys so some things aren't perfect. The colour is not what we expected and ended up being more of a light caramel, nearly skin colour. The logo on the front is hella massive, I'd hoped it would have been a bit smaller. The material also is kinda thin. The design also isn't that crisp (They scanned the image straight off the fax because no one has e-mail, hence there is speckilng). If we had to do it over, I think we would probably send over the prints of the colours and designs via air mail and we would wait for a sample before pulling the trigger. I think though our expectations were high after the raging success of the silver tenchu jersey which was a superb effort by the tailor. The same one I might add. The jerseys however are growing on me and we must thank Vince, Vince's Dad and Bez for moving on this so quickly. Their efforts were great and most appreciated.   The best way we can show our thanks is by paying up. Vince's dad bankrolled the whole operation so we need to get Vince the money soon, this Thursday if possible. Vince will be asking for around $65 per set, so please bring the dough on Thursday if you can. Remember the game is at 6:00 this Thirsday.

      Well, we're going to have to make some dealz here because Milton is Porse and Jurque's 'hood, Mt.Gravatt be the mad southsides and Greenslopes is the land of the ninesuns.....hmm....who has to travel the furthest??!!  Actually, I don't really mind as I am keen as dijon to bowl again - anywhere will do but please can it be disco?  Thank you.  As for the Hip hop thingy at Milton, Koolism and Miss Brown are playing there on Saturday May 24th so that is deffo a bowling night.  Sweeeeeet.  Damn this mouse.  What is Vinnie doing for his birthday?    Sorry couldn't make it to B-Ball tonight but muchos buggeros due to this cough/flu thing that I've had for an age.  Ciggies don't help either.

      cool Fresh, i'll check that out tommorow. No matter how good some-one may be at bowling.. theyve yet to taste the bitter taste of an LTJ  psyche out.  Disco Bowl Mt Gravatt styles sounds cool.. local and shit.. also greenslopes is right next door to my bro's house. We should definatly make it back ot Milton though if there's Hip-Hop evenings coinciding. ( not confirmed yet but Brothers Stoney are meant to be playing at The Alley - the bar inside Milton Bowl on the 26th of June ) It's my new favourite sport.. Im shithouse at B-Ball.. but any sport where your allowed a stubby in ya hand.. is OK with me. I'll be at BBAll tommorow night to support though. Me bru and Masato just went and saw Xmen2.. dont waste ya dosh. :) Ned Kelly was better in the yester i thought. Better hurry up and get the De La tickets.. We couldnt get them from Rockin Horse when we tried.. but Central Station had them. I dont think i'll make it to Krush.. but i know Brews looking for someone to go with.  any way.. its fuckin late..  IM GHOST!! peace bez .. .

      Hi everyone!!!  Mint fresh is here now at last.  Thanks for the nickname, it freshens me up too.  :)   I want to let you guys know that I'm  NOT  that good at bowling, don't believe big mouth nine.  >.  Jurquette, the social calendar looks great!  wish I can join some events.  I've got heaps of assignments/projects to do though.    There is one site I want you guys to check it out,  urlLink juliusandfriends .   it's my favorite at the moment.  Try and have a look in the cartoons part, reckon you guys will like their DJ table. (sorry if I say it wrong)   The cartoons are cute and some are funny too.  You know them if you know  urlLink Paul Frank . ;-)   I love their stuff.  :P

      Welcome Tangmoe!  So good to see you here at last.  If there's anyone else you think might like to join, please give me their e-mail addresses and I will invite them.  Bowling Saturday night it is! I'm sure M-Fresh will beat us all.  Love the nickname, very funky. Don't worry about not hooking up so much ninesuns, we understand how it is.  I am flat out just doing a 8-5....even with flex days.  I really should have found a rich sugar daddy to marry.  Where should we bowl?  We've done Milton and we've done Mt Gravatt.  I personally preferred Milton, but then again we've yet to experience the disco bowl at Mt.Gravatt.  Can we please have some votes?  Okay, now the social calendar - DJ Krush on 15th - not going, seen him twice, no funds but would highly recommend it to the cashed up.  Grandmaster Flash - not to be missed - downside, on the 18th of May, a Sunday for those of you with jobs without flex.  Then the grand event!  Jurquette's 30th Birthday on the 31st of May.  Kicking off at the African and Latin Festival at Annerley in the day and then on to De La Soul at the Arena.  Tickets available at Rocking Horse.  As De La has somewhat eclipsed the birthday celebrations (there were plans for a huge shindig but proved to be logistical nightmare) were are going to have another 30th birthday celebration on the 14th of June at the Alliance Tavern.  It's also Bru's b'day on the 12th and Ant's on the 18th??  So we thought we'd do a joint thing.  The vibe is chill, the music is good, entry is only $5 and it's a great place to invite parents, siblings, work mates, friends who aren't going to De La.....so there you have it.  Oh and further into June....not confirmed yet but Brothers Stoney are meant to be playing at The Alley - the bar inside Milton Bowl on the 26th of June....can get a couple of games in before the gig.  Yay!!!  Love to check out Little Taipei when I'm not on a diet.  It sucks but I made a vow to myself to be a certain weight by the time I turn 30.  It's not going well.  Bez, have you heard about flash monkey job???!

      I'd love to go to bowling on Saturday, I should finish my assignment by Saturday evening. I''ll check with fresh but we should be able to go. BTW you guys had all better bring pink slips because Mint Fresh is going to own all of you. Her game is tight. If we're invited that is. On Saturday before you go Bowling, you should check out Little Taipei in Sunnybank. Heaps of good food and great prices. We've been going a lot lately and it seems to be getting even more popular.    I do miss hanging' out with you guys. It just gets so crazy for me some times and I can't organise anything. I'll definitely endeavour to organise more events. Speking of events. Fresh and Nine's wedding is on Friday September the 19th, APex Park Coolangatta on Marine Parade. It's pretty close to the monument on the border. Mark it on your calendars.   Pretty busy but not much happening in the land of the suns. Just playing ball, studying and working. Got a big assignment due on Sunday about the Comparing the virtues of performance appraisal systems. Writing a 3000 word essay on this topic is an exercise in futility. Speaking of futility, come out and jerk it up with the "Southsiders" tomorrow when we ride out against "unknown team".   When is Grandmaster Flash coming? I don't even have tickets for De La Soul yet, BTW where do I get them, and I've just found out that Krush is supposed to be coming here too. What the *@_% is going on?   I don't know why, but when I hear Bez Ree I think bakery...    Peace to all my brothas and sistahs in LTJ.

      The way I look at it is - one is not better than the other.  However, Mint may feel that one suits her more than the other.  I like Mint Fresh because of the hip hop vibe it has to it, and I like Salsa Sista because it's hot and cheeky with a dance connotation.  So whatever Mint feels suits her, she should go for.  Quite frankly, both names are a lot cooler than what Bez, Bru and Porse call me - Tits.  Even though I have Jurquette, they still use Tits on their pieces because "Jurquette" is too long.  Bez and I both won at bowling on Sunday night.  I think that's because we are good sports and are not competitive in anyway.  It is also because we blog more.  Bowling again on Saturday for sure.

      I've been talking with Mint about her name and it seems she likes the name, "Salsa Sistah". I like it as well and it sounds pretty cool. Although I do like Mint Fresh. I"ll start a list of pros and cons for the names and hope you guys will put forward your thoughts so we can come up with a decision:  S.S. - Hot, Descibes spicy food and even spicier dancing, denoting a hot appearance and spicy personality, more of a latin tip, Produces a mental picture of Latin Jazz, Palm Trees, Lowriders, Clubs by the Beach and Salsa Dancing.               M.F. - Cool, uses her name, More of a hip hop tip, Produces a mental picture of chewing gum commercials, Sunday afternoons downtown with a chill hip hop soundtrack.  One question though? Which one would be cooloer when written in graff? This has to into consideration.  Overall, I reckon Salsa Sistah.  Please respond...

      Finished all my exams now. I'm pretty relieved had no idea how I was gonna go and seems like I did OK. Spent the rest of the day playing Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom. Been busy with other things too. Had an interview for a job in town this week. I think I went pretty well, I'll just have to wait and see. I have mixed feelings about leaving too. Every other job I've left has been a definite step in the right direction. This is the first time I have gone sideways. Don't feel good leaving my colleagues either. They have been good to me and we are entering the busy phase of the project.  Top 5 Reasons I should take job if successful.  1. Job in town 2. More IM/IT role 3. Better prospects for future, easier to get other positions 4. Current organisation culture is negative 5. My current boss whom is good may soon move on putting in place a manager  I'm not comforatble with.  Top 5 Reasons I shouldn't take the job if successful  1. Move from business analysis type role 2. Don't have project implementation skills yet 3. Running away when the position becomes harder 4. Leaving my colleagues when it gets busy 5. A little less money in new position  Hope the house sells soon. It would make things a lot easier on us, in many respects. Chose light blue for the feature wall and spent around $800 on new light fittings for the new apartment. It won't be dark anymore and the painting will be done in the next 2 weeks. I'll probably move in in around 3 weeks. Don't know how much time I'll actually spend there though, have to maintain the house and can't leave it empty because there wil still be a lot of valuable stuff still there.  I'm eagerly watching the NBA draft. It's where teams choose young players to join their squad for next year. It can be quite exciting if you're in to that sort of stuff. A lot of rumours, gamesmanship and strategising, I love it.   Looking forward to going to Coolangatta on the weekend. It will give us a chance to better plan things and a chance to relax for a while. Some wedding planning items are starting to happen. so that is good. Peace to all my LTJ brothas and sistahs. Till next time.

      Had a mad work breakfast at the Pancake Manor this morning.  Once again I went for the Bacon, egg and hash browns with a short stack on the side.  Me and Collette had an eating battle in the name of the Origin (I was an honorary blue) against the boys - needless to say we won with my gargatuan effort.  In fact, I think I scared some people.  One guy said I should go on Fear Factor.  Big Brother is really boring now.  I might get my life back again the way it's going.

      Haven't blogged in a while, been busy. Check out my weekend.  Friday study & clean house till 1:30 AM  7:00 Get up & clean house 8:00 Go to exam 8:30 - 12:00 Exam - International Business **11:00 - 11:45 (Real EState Agent conducting open house)** 12:00 - 1:30 Lunch @ Mint's 1:30 - 4:30 Look for Fridge, microwaves, washing machines & do gift registry 4:30 - 5:30 Go home pick up Andre, have shower, go to Mint's house 5:30 - 6:30 Go to unit and meet the painter and discuss colours etc. 6:30 - 7:30 Dinner back at Mint's (No fuel in the car & massive headache) 7:30 - 10:00 Leo's farewell party. (1/2 hour of Salsa dancing) 10:00 - 12:00 DVD @ Mint's (In & out of consciousness for the last hour) 12:00- 1:00 Drive home and sleep.  Sunday. Did absolutely nothing (Didn't even study for exam.)   The house is not sold yet but getting it ready every weekend and 1 day a week is getting to be a little difficult. I have not moved in to my unit yet. It is clean but we need to sell the house first, some painting needs to be done, the blinds need to be washed, need new lights and we need the firdge etc. Maybe in 3 - 4 weeks I'll be in there. Looked for a fridge, washing machine etc on the weekend. Haven't bought yet but now we know what we're looking for. Also took the opportunity to set up a gift registry on Saturday at David Jones. All gifts are reasonably priced only 1 item @ $100, most around $30 - $50, some even $20. However no one should feel like the list must be used. It is a guide and for people who don't know hat we need/want. If you find a better price or gift or whatever then do not hesitate to do that. Hope the house sells soon. It would make things much easier.  Got another exam on Thursday. So I've got the day off on Wednesday to study. Don't know how I'll do. I hate this subject and barely went to the lectures. All I need to is pass the exam & I should be OK.    I'm trying to organise some accomodation this weekend for us and the girls. Seems like people don't want the business. If I ever see an ad or hear a hotelier on the gold coast/coolangatta approach me, I'll tell them where were ya on the weekend of the 22nd.  Basketball has been pretty good. Even though we lost last week we still had a good time. Steve played and he had a good time too. We seem to be missing a lot of players though. Everyone seems to be be too busy to come down and play. It can be bad someties when we've only got 5 players. Hopefully that will chnage soon. At least everybody that comes gets a really good run. Even if you're doggin' it, 40 mins is still hard. Bez, ask Dave if he wants to play. Maybe even Bez and Steve could get involved. Either coaching or playing. We need all the support we can get. I played pretty badly. Was very lazy and din't help very much. I think I took the game too lightly. I've actually put on weight thugh I ma playing twice a week. Mustn't be playing very hard in the actual games. I'll step it up and see if it improves.  I read that you guys watched Spirited Away. What did you guys think? I thought it was a great film. It has a great story that speaks to everyone, stunning visuals and heaps of comedy. I though the mouse and fly were absolutley hilarious. I've got almost all of Miyazaki's films. Only missing one. They are all very good and quite similar in vein to Spirited Away. If you guys are interested just let me know. Also what did you guys think about Made. I thought it was really funny but really hard to watch (in a good way). Vince Vaughn was just such an annoying @#%hole in that film. It was funny though.  Wedding plans are pretty behind. There's a few more things going on in the land of the suns. I'll let you guys know when things happen. When I move in I'll invite you guys around for a quiet evening by the river. Sounds smashing what. BTW I heard there is no more SARS in HK, people are no longer wearing masks.   Top 5 things for ninesuns to do over the next few weeks  1. Finish Exams 2. Sell House 3. Fix up unit and put new stuff in it. 4. Wedding stuff 5. Find time to breathe

      Biiiig weekend.  It was a like the days round at the Bez pad except it was just me getting maggot at Bellbowrie.  Leah came over and she was really good value.  A lot of fun but a lot of suffering too next moaning.  Thanks to Porse and Bru for putting up with me.  We watched Spirited Away and Primal Fear which I'd never seen.  Then did the usual Rage marathon but it wasn't too flash music wise.  This was supposed to be my quiet weekend but there must have been something in the air.  Debbie rang me at 10 to 12 this morning; she'd just got in from her big night out.  Madness.  Anyway, Top Five Movies I have Seen in the last Month.....  1. Standing in the Shadows of Motown 2. Ring O 3. Y Tu Mama Tambien (I think that's how ya spell it) 4. Blue Velvet 5. Made

Anyway, I want Dan or Reggie to win.  I would prefer Dan but would be happy with Reggie.  For Ant's birthday, we would be more than happy to 'host' the night in.  We can put on our PJ's & ugh boots and have a chilling time here at Bellboring.  Let us know what you and Ant would like to do.  I am keen for a night in....buggered.  I didn't go to work today due to stomach flu.  I won't go into the gory details, it's quite ugly.  Have taken some Buscopan and Maxolon....hoping to be right to go back tomorrow because I don't have much sick leave left!  Also I'm going to miss Mint and El s dinner tonight - so pissed off!!!  : (

      Not much happening since the last time I blogged. Fatigue and illness have played their roles. Both Fresh and I have finished our respective assignments. I've only got 2 exams to go this semester. I'm looking forward to doing a negotiation subject next sem, could be fun. Also looking forward to the Northern Soul party, I like the night life... I like to boogie.   The NBA finals are just about as boring as you can get. It's like watching paint dry. I'm actualy more interested in what teams will be doing after the season, ie draft, trades and signings. Managed to make Fresh pretty mad at me yesterday. Lefty came over and we played PS2 instead of going to the book fair. Pro Evolution Soccer 2 is  so difficult. Eventually went to the fair and I must say it was pretty crap but it's all for charity I guess. There were some cheap records there. If you got in early enough you might find some gems but I have no idea why people would buy half of the crap on display. What scares me even more is what possessed people to buy them in the first place or even what inspired the authors to write them. The stories behind the stories would probably make for better reading. I heard this story once about a guy that would go and buy cassette tapes at book fairs. Particularly unmarked cassette tapes just so he could find out what was on them. The world ceratinly is an amazing place. Anyway the day was not a total loss, we walked around Southbank and had some greasy food. Nearly ate half a skewer that was jammed inside a chicken stick.  The team seems to be playing much better. Our defense is improving and so is our rebounding but our shooting is a little rusty. I think we are  struggling a little to find easy shots. Some easy baskets would give us confidence and we would hit more shots. I can't belive how lazy I am in the rebounding dept. If I was this lazy in my junior days how the hell did I manage to get anything done.  Top 5 fave cartoons (pre Akira)  1. Robotech 2. Astroboy 3. Battle of the Planets 4. Transformers 5.

      Bru's b'day on Thursday.  Then the big party at the Alliance on Saturday the 14th.  You'd better all be there.  I won $8.55 on Powerball.  This is the beginning of my lucky streak. When I win big, we are all going to the Maldives for a holiday.  Reggie is being a legend.  Sax is pissing me off.  I don't want Dan to go, he's a jerk.  Porse and Bru have just left to go pick up my microphone from Bru's place.  He is a thief.....always nicking my shit.

      Thanks to everyone for the most excellent presents and celebration.  I had an absolute ball and truly appreciated the time and effort that everyone went to.  It's brought home to me how great my friends really are and especially Porse, my one and only, what a man what a man what a man what a mighty mighty good man...I love you Porse.  As Bez would say 30 years your fanny's been on this earth granny - well I couldn't be starting my 31st year with my fanny in better company.  Cheers cobs, I love you all.

      Another big weekend for us. Went to Coolangatta on Saturday & arranged the bouquet & catering and assemebled the new bed at the unit. Sunday involved buying a new matress and heaps of packing of my mum's stuff and moving the bulk of my stuff to the new unit. We had a bit of a relax after finishing these tasks at around 6:30. We got some New York Pizza (First time for me, really oily but really nice) and watched Gangs of New York. Pretty good I must say but I'm really starting to get tired. I can't keep up this level of activity without a break for much longer. I'm hoping to finish this Saturday so that I can start relaxing from this Sunday on.   My life is currently dominated by building a future for Mint and myself and I've been thinking about it. One of the best books about the future is Drexler's book, Engines of Creation. Find it at http://www.foresight.org/EOC/ It explores the ideas of nanotechnology and molecular consruction. Building things by making little nanobots which can create more little nanobots whom in turn arrange atoms into programmed structures, creating whatever you want. In theory with these nanobots you could actually make diamond from pushing together carbon atoms. One pundit even claims the next "age" will be the diamond age, with everythingfrom chairs and tables to be made from diamond. Just a theory but you get the idea. People have even proposed biological tree structures that are placed in toxic areas, collecting havy metals for re-sale and reprocessing while breaking down more harmful pollutants to base elements. Another one could be a fish-like structure which could swim the oceans looking for pollutants and breaking them down. The future looks bright IMO.  My top 5 predictions for the next 20 years  1. There will only be 4 currencies in the whole world (Australia will use the chinese currency) 2. China will be the world economic superpower & Europe will have an economic and cultural renaissance (Already happening) 3. Biotechnology will become commonplace, they will develop biological filters, to clean waste water. 4. Hydrogen will be the fuel of choice, oil will be phasing out. (Europe will win out on this big time) Remember 2/3 of the world is covered by water, that's a boatload of fuel. 5. Nanotechnology will become commonplace - this will allow quantum computing, virus killing biological machines, environmental cleanup biological machines etc.

I have to come up with about 4 new songs and it's not happening as fast as I would like.  Ah well - will spend all weekend on it if I have to.

      Glad to hear you guys will be there with us. We should be rockin a really big posse so it should be fun.   I played ball again last night and we had another loss. I was late to the game and hence was unable to get the sheet and everything done early. It seemed that we were slightly unsettled early on. Nonetheless the score was quite close at the half. We fell away towards the end. They were too big and we could not keep them from rebounding over us. Although I must say they were frequently standing in the key for more than 3 seconds and coming over the back. On a personal note I thought I played an extremely poor game. I was not not sharp at all. I guess you could say I was blunt. I was responsible for around 6 or more turnovers. 6 I would say I a gross underestimation however I dare not try to recall exactly how many for fear I would not be able to cope with the resulting night terrors. Any advice is welcome.   Mum decided not to sell the house and one of dad's colleagues from up north will be renting the joint. So ends that saga. At least we won't have to make sure the house is spotless every weekend. Should be moving in this weekend to the new apartment. We will have to pick up the bed and bookshelf tomorrow. Also got a meeting with the celebrant to tidy things up. The shelf was a good pickup. It is HUGE and we only payed $250 for it.  Bez Rock...EEEAAAAGHHH if you are interested in house stuff. I know someone whom is having a garage sale this Saturday. They close up at 1 so get in quick. They've got pretty new and good condition stuff, washing machine, fridge, cupboard (nearly brand new), dining table and chairs and records for sale. 30 Laura St. Highgate Hill. BTW why do you need this stuff?     Work's been pretty slow lately but will begin to really hot up starting next week. I finshed reading the four Storm Riders volumes I had purchased. I must say they were pretty cool. The art seems to progressively get better with each issue. This is extremely rare in comics. From my experince which is mostly with American comics. The art is great in the first 1 or 2 issues but then rapidly degrades. The artists spend more time to get it right and are looking to impress in the early issues but then tend to drop off. Japanese comics can improve as the story goes on but I find that they tend to concentrate on certain panels (mostly important ones) but neglect the other linking panels. Commonly dedicating 1 or 2 whole pages of great detail on 1 action pose or significant panel. Storm Riders is different and I don't know why? Perhaps because it is Chinese. Water colors and pastels are used instead of the normal harder colours and maybe I'm just getting more used to the style but I feel it definitely improves. The structure and flow of the panels can be difficult to get though. However it has been translated from Chinese so there are losses in the translation coupled with the conversion of right-sided reading our left sided reading.   Top 5 Comics of all time  1. X-Men (Absolute classic. Best characters ever) 2. Blade of the Immortal (Extremely good Samurai tale)  3. Ninja High School (Very funny) 4. Something I'm probably forgetting goes in here 5. Oriental Heroes (Still good value action)  Peace

      Hope you guys have a good game tonight.  I am very keen to stay the Plaza....will probably stay Thursday and Friday night.  Will book this week to avoid disappointment.  Beza has been shopping for home goods as well I hear.  I will let him tell you about it.  I got a 3.8% pay rise too...yay....but they are still arguing about it and it's going to a ballot so probably won't see anything until the end of August.  Still, it will come in handy for the wedding and Porse's B'day (23rd of September).  Will be going to see T3 tomorrow night maybe.

      Still busy times in the Valley of the Sun. The game is afoot and it's starting to affect my sleep. Spent the whole weekend doing more wedding and moving stuff. On Saturday ordered the cake and nearly sorted the catering. I will have to go back to Coolangatta again though probably in 2 weeks time. On Sunday got good deals on a fridge and microwave. However we struck out on the fridge. Didn't know that stainless steel models were so expensive. However on Wednesday I got the rings and the fridge now too. Woo Hoo!! 2 more off the list. We are cooking with gas now. The unit is starting to take shape. Sky blue Rizzy and Cream are the colours of the apartment baby...  The house still hasn't sold yet and mum is wavering on whether she should continue to try to sell it. Obviously there has been no real serious buyers yet. It would make things a lot easier if it were to sell. Anyway I should be moving in sometime this weekend. Haven't got a whole lot to move. The mattress could be the only big ticket item to move. Though I envisage that I won't be spending a terrific amount of time there just yet. The bed I ordered from Ikea is six weeks away at the minimum too.  In any case we should be having a garage sale soon. So please come along and sift through our junk. There will be a sausage sizzle, for VIP's ONLY. that means everybody that reads this bolg. You may find treasure and a bargain. At the end of the day you will at least share our company. More details to come.   We are not going on our honeymoon till around Novemebr or December, maybe even February. I will stone broke and that'sno joke. When we do go it will be to Thailand and should be quite good. A few friends may be coming with us. A few days in Bangkok, a another small church wedding ceremony, and then hopefully a few weeks in the  Ihlands Mon .  It should be pretty good. I speak to you guys in persom nore about it later.  There are still suites available at Calypso Plaza. We are paying 220 per night. That's for a 2 bedroom executive. You could chance it & wait for a deal to become available on www.wotif.com. However this is a little risky as September 20 should be the start of school holidays. We did try to reserve a room for LTJ crew members but the Thai entourage conitnues to grow and incredibly is no current space left even though we booked four 2 bedroom suites. We are staying on September 18th the night before and September 19th the night of. Estimated driving time from hotel to location 3 mins. I am planning a picnic next week at the spot to show everybody where it is and do more planning. This would be the perfect opportunity for us to catch up with you guys, do some planning and check out the hotel. All LTJ invited. So let me know. We will also be having a  housewarming too if you guys are interested.  Please come.    Peace to my LTJ brothas and sistahs.  Catch you on the MOFO flipside

      Welcome to the world of work Bez Rock. It sucks but if you want the bling bling you need some money in tha thing. BTW did Bru hear about the possible job opp I told him about.  Didn't get the job. I thought I did well enough but it's OK. I got a small pay rise which was good, around 3%. I now earn around 2G more than the new job would pay, and should also get another small increment in December. So I guess things aren't that bad. Would've been nice to work back in the city again though and become a little more professional.  Played ball again last night. We have been playing much better every week and really played well last night. I on the other hand seem to be playing worse. I have become a turnover machine, I'm good for around 6 - 7 turnovers a game. I may even be the only player on the team with a negative assist to turnover ratio. Maybe 1 assist - for every 3 turnovers.  Just a little heads up for those interested in basketball or the latest marketing hype. Be prepared for basketball to make a really big comeback in the next few years. 2 main reasons. 2 aging Hall-of-fame players, Gary Payton and Karl "Mailman" Malone, will join the Lakers which already have arguably 2 of the best players currently on the planet. Result, possible championship but most definitely heaps of marketing hype. A crop of 3 rookies in the NBA have the potential to provide some good personal rivalries and more excitement. One of them being Lebron James. High Schooler Lebron James in summer training for his NBA team the Clevaland Cavaliers is already drawing crowds bigger than regular season games. I have been reading about this kid for a while now and the hype alone could propel basketball once again to the marketing forefront. The effects have already begun to take shape. Nike recently signed Lebron James to a 90 million US$ contract for 10 years. I have also read that Nike has recently bought out struggling Converse. Converse by the way has gone bankrupt twice in the last 5 years. Nike gets an established brand which appeals to various market niches further strengthening their company and I guess it's good news for die hard fans. I hope they don't stuff up this brand which I was once very loyal to. But this may all be ancillary stuff. 2 years ago when the Lebron hype was just starting to take off Converse copyrighted the use of the term "King James" in sporting equipment and apparel. One of the two nicknames for Lebron James are "King James" and "The Chosen One". It may have been cheaper for Nike to buy Converse than fight to use the nickname. So when you see "King James" on Nike t-shirts and posters you will know the "real" story.  Still been busy with moving and wedding stuff. The house isn't sold yet but the unit is coming along nicely. We've bought new lights, repainted the feature wall a light blue and bought a dining table and chairs. We also knowwhat couch we want. So I'll spend the next few weekends looking for stuff. I'll move in next Saturday.  As for the wedding, the accommodation for out-of-town guests and some locals has been booked. If you guys are interested in hanging out with the wedding crew on the 18th or 19th we'll be at Calypso Plaza. $220 per night for a 2 bedroom executive suite. They're quite nice. The celebrant is set set and the inivtations are printed, we just have to wait for them to be delivered.  Got my order of Strom Riders graphic novels from Amazon this week. Cool comic. Not exactly what I'm used to but I love kung fu stories and the water colors and softer styles pretty good. I'm thinking of ordering more but will have to wait till after the wedding and after I buy a fridge, washing machine etc.   Top 5 Reasons Why I didn't get the job.   1. Fate 2. Another example of "The Man" keeping me down 3. Intricate Worldwide conspiracy against me 4. Interviewers feeling threatened by my overwhealming qualifications 5. Interviewers balked at my requests for siestas   Top 5 REAL Reasons Why I didn't get the job.   1. There was a better candidate than me 2. They didn't like some of my answers 3. Not enough experience 4. They already had someone else in mind for the job 5. I was the wrong fit for the position   Catch you on the  MOFO  flipside

      I went off Dan this week. Mainly because of his whining over the Reggie salt thingy. Anoshka rocks.  I wish she wasn't leaving and could be part of the competition.  Anyway, I'm onna diet - again.  Everybody better be nice to me cos I'm dead cranky due to food deprivation.  The treadmill is starting to get some use too, finally.  Ninesuns, have you heard from Treasury yet?  Bez, how's work going?  Been paid yet (give me 10 bucks)?  Porse! Way to go manager guy.  Bru, hurtin' from the gime yet?  Heh heh.  Big Northern Soul night coming up on the 9th of August.  It's free and there's a dance comp. for the novices.  Should be a good night.

      What a weekend.  Porse's stocktake on Friday until 12.  Had a quick bite to eat that night at Montezuma's - yum, Durango anna Margarita! Saturday - dinner at Tara's (mmmmm, butter chicken) then watched Undercover Brother on DVD.  Then mad dash to Garbo to see Hulk (popcorn, salty AND caramel).  Great flick, props to Ang Lee for giving the characters dimension.    Slept most of Sunday - missed eviction : ( but got plenty of rest.  Had a fantastic time at Mint and El's - we had soup (pork mince and chinese lettuce), meatballs, pork ribs (ha ha, sorry guys), red curry and ice cream for dessert.  It was so delicious......I really have to get on that treadmill this week.  As you can see all I have done is eat for the last week or so.  Getting excited about Fresh and 9Suns upcoming wedding.....it's going to be awesome!

      Gettin' ready for Brothers Stoney tonight and bowling of course.  Can't wait to bowl, have been limbering up in anticipation.  I think I'm going to take Porse out tonight.  We bumped into DCE, Len1 and Lazy outside the bottle-o at Indooroopilly last night - they said they are on around 9ish and it will be pretty packed so we are going to go early, buy tickets, bowl then head home.  It'll be all over by 12 which is shut down time.  Should be a wiiiii-iiicked night.    Porse and I might be going to HK/UK for Christmas.  Just waiting to find out if I can get the leave.  Mad London styles....big up!!!

      Had a pretty good weekend. Went to Little Taipei and had an OK meal. Probably the only time I have been let down by a meal there. I should've had the steak instead. Then we went to Chris' place for Steamboat. We were farewelling his parents whom wil be heading off to CHina for 6 months to teach English. I think they'll have a great time. There was problems with the power so we had a few false starts on the Steamboat but it all worked out.   We then played pictionary till the late hours. We had a lot of fun. Sunday was quite productive. Went shopping, cleaned the unit up. Actually I helped Mint clean the unit. She did most of the work. I also watched the first series of Red Dwarf. The first few episodes were OK but toward the end they were starting to become quite good. The episodes in the 2nd & 3rd season though are the funniest. Lister, The Cat & Rimmer all really start ripping in to each other. Can't wait for the 2nd season of Red Dwarf on DVD.   We had Tuna Mornay for din din. Following this I watched the 60 minutes report on Oz property. Interesting but I think I don't really know enough to make a prediction one way or the other. I do know however that owning your own home in Brisbane is going to be much more difficult. Booms do peek out eventually and the trough that follows may not be huge, but a 4-5% in the housing sector could put the economy into a recession. I know it'll always be the guys that get in at the end that are going to get burned. It's always the little guy.  Finished off the evening by watching Ballistic and then went to sleep. Ballistic was OK, plot not good, art OK(kinda drab), FX poor-OK, Lucy Liu good, photography OK (some good scenes). I think if this movie was made in HK it would be much better. I'll be getting up extra early on Tuesday for a business trip to Ballina.

      I've nearly finished this book on the leadership style of Konosuke Matsushita. This was the dude who started Panasonic & National. It's sort of a biography but more concentrating on his leadership style etc. He managed to build the company into a giant from very humble beginnings. His former 2IC and brother in-law ended up starting Sanyo. It's a pretty amazing story.  Going to Supanova on Sept 13th with the guys. It's a convention for Manga, comics & Sci Fi enthusiasts. Should be fun. I may be able to pick up some cool stuff. My birthday is also coming up soon, so I'm looking forward to it.   I may watch some Manga this weekend. I've actually still got a heap of stuff I haven't watched yet, so this will be a good opportunity to get on top of it. Still haven't lived up to the promise that I would watch everything I have before buying new stuff. Impossible. I may end up watching the whole Saint Seiya series though. That could be cool. I may have to study a little though. I've got some stuff to catch up on. I actually saw one of those Overfiend movies you're talking about Jurquette. Pretty full on, I agree. Urotsukodoji, I think the name is.   The mighty Southsiders lost again last night. We only lost by 9 points but the guys really did themselves proud. I was happy to see the guys playing so well. We dug ourselves a really big hole and were down by around 20 points at half-time. However we scored 32points in the 2nd half to bring it back. Our defense was excellent and we really killed them. On a personal note I was ashamed of my poor performance and attitude last night. I became frustrated more at myself than anything else. I promised myself at the beginning of the year that I would just enjoy the game as I wasn't able to play for 2.5 years. So I'm taking a long hard look at myself and trying to be the change I want to see in the world.  I think I have to be more positive. So each blog, I'll talk about something positive. The story of Matsushita has given me a new perspective and inspired me to think more entrepreneurially. I have some ideas and will pursue them very soon. I already have one of the key ingredients of success which is prior failure. Peace

      Why do people say PIN number?  It's like saying "Personal Identification Number number".  The same with ATM machine.  You're saying "Automatic Teller Machine machine".  It's a crazy world.

      Bloggidy blog in the hizzouse.    Fab weekend just gone, great to see you as always! Ki was interesting, Saturday was rockin', I won a cd in the dance comp. at the Northern Soul....yay!  It's a great cd too.  The next one is on September 20th, just after the wedding festivities.  Then the picnic on Sunday was such a great way to relax.  If we have time today we're going to try and find a decent volleyball net for the beach or the next park outing.  I am battered and bruised from Bootsy dragging me along the grass and I had sore buttcheeks from doing god knows what (was it the cartwheels or the flying frisbee tackles? could even have been the sad attempt at Beyonce bootyshaking) but I was refreshed and ready for werk on Monday.    Porse and I have been taking it easy this Ekka holiday - had a mad meal at Mercury in Toowong last night - Lamb Shanks that fell off the bone if you breathed on 'em and Porse had the 30 day aged rib eye.  We then came back home, got settled on the couch with the feral cat and the hound and watched 24 Hour Party People (how good is Steve Coogan?), Just Married (Hollywood fluff, I needed it), a brief break to have a bath with my fave Lush bath products then into bed to fall asleep to some hardcore manga - I know the english name is Legend of The Overfiend but I can't remember the Japanese name off hand.  Full on!  Woke up this morning to breakfast in bed, and now Porse is cleaning the house while I blog.  What is he trying to compensate for?  I don't care, just keep it coming!  Anyway, hope you all have a great rest of the working week.  We're going to keep a low profile until the wedding so that we can save some bucks and celebrate big styles (don't forget it is Porse's birthday on the 23rd of Sept. too).  Until our next gathering LTJ, stay happy and well.  I love you guys even though you are all the ball lickers.  PS We watched a bit of Jay and Silent Bob too.  I love the motherfuckin' Time! Ooh-eee-ooh-eee-oh!

      Had a great time this weekend. Ki was mad and all of us had a good time. Awesome to the max. What started the fighting on Friday night on the dancefloor? We also had a great time at the picnic. Good to catch up. It was also good to have a weekend that wasn't filled with driving around and looking for stuff. It got pretty thick for a while but We have finally managed to finish the major stuff for the wedding and everybody is moved in and sorted. It's a relief to only have one thing to do per day on a weekend and a great joy to have the opprtunity to hang out with friends. I feel much lighter now.  I'm now in week 3 of my studies. Corporate FInance is looming large and could require some time to learn the stuff, International Negotiation however seems quite fun. I had my 1st lecture on Saturday and it was quite enjoyable. We had a simulated negotiations then discussions on the outcomes etc. It was really quite good. I had to sell someone a used car. It was a win-lose negotiation. The more 1 person wins the more the other loses. I ended up coming out slightly ahead but still got screwed I think. It was interesting to hear some of the other outcomes, some of the buyers really got screwed by the sellers. It is very interesting and could help with my own negotiation skills. I am an extremely poor negotiator particularly bargaining.   Thinking about birthday presents for my bro & chris at the mo'. It's frustrating when you want to buy things off the Internet & you think hey that's agood price. Then you look at the shipping amount and it's greater than the cost of the goods. The Internet is a great opprtunity to buy rare items or cheap local goods. The only way to save just a little money is to buy in bulk. Have to strat curbing my spending. I spent a heap of money in the past few months for the wedding etc. It's time to settle down and sort out the mess.  Fresh and El are still thinking about making a cafe and considering the growth & change in Brisbane it may be a good time to do so. I just worry that the stress and investment will be too much. We were thiking again about going to Thailand but another location became available. We'll wait and see. I got a few small projects of my own to work on.   I should be setting up a small housewarming dinner at my place soon. I hope to see the jerks there. Peace.

      Hey LTJ.  Thank you so much for your support at Ki on Friday.  I was shitting my daks for about two days prior and it was so good to see you all there, despite the fact I got told I have an 80's hairdo.  The sound was pants but I really had a good time.  For those of you that left, there was a big fight at the end when me and some chicks from that private function were dancing to 'Don't Stop Till You Get Enough'.  It has that effect on people (Michael Jackson that is, not the dancing).  Anyway, Joe the manager got really angry and they shut it all down.....which was good in a way because we got to leave then, heh heh.    All in all it was an interesting night.  Joe asked us to come back again and we said we'd do it but not for a while......  Hope to see you all at the picnic on Sunday.  I am Northern Souling it up tonight at the Alliance - I don't think Porse wants to go but I need to get some boogie time in.  Please come if you are free.

      I saw "Monsterio Delicio" @ Ki Bar last night.. the sound was a bit off.. but the performances were dope.  Dont know who the fat geezer behind the decks was.. but he was droppin some pretty cool cuts..  Mick and Zoe came.. and got an ivite to Nine Guns and Mint Fresh's wedding..  Also got to catch up with heeps of the other jerks..   I'd definatly be keen to hook up with that chick with the 80's hair-doo from "Monsterio Delicio" to make some f-f-f-fr-fr-ffreesshhh beats.  ________________  In other news.. i won 2 tickets to go see Def Wish Cast at the snow on the 30th of August..  They pay for the accomodation and shit..but i gotta find my own way there... Maybe i can fly down to Melbs... and get a lift with these other cats from Melburn.  ________________  Top 5 snacks: 1.

      Saw "View from the top" last night. it was OK not the best but OK, Mike Myers was quite funny. Also went to Little Taipei & had Vietnamese style dry noodle salad. It was good. We also did a little work at the house. Nearly finished now.   I bought the Dune DVD last week. Apparently David Lynch took his credit of this version off the fim because of the prologue and various bits of commentary that were added to the film to make it easier to follow. Also 1 hour of extra footage removed by the studios was re-added. I had never seen this movie before but I have read the book. Without the prologue and with 1 hour less footage I would have been completely lost. This film though enjoyable and with good art etc would have been almost incomprehensible. I think the scope of the book is immense and far too large for 1 movie. At least a trilogy but maybe a series would suffice. It was fun but 1 thing did stand out. I somehow either forgot or misinterpreted the "Weirding" weapons that House Atriedis developed. I thought it was a method of hand-to-hand combat and battle tactics not an actual weapon. I totally missed that one.   One thing I would love to see is the Daughter of th Empire series of books turned into say an animated or live-action tv series. It would be MAD. Talk about epic scope. There is nothing like an epic. It makes viewing an event.  Top 5 books I've read  1. Dune 2. Magician 3. Daughter of the Empire 4. River God 5. The King's Buccaneer

      I too enjoy reading the posts and keeping up with you guys. I do regret not being able to hang out as much as before though. The move, study and wedding takes almost all my time. However I can see a light at the end of the tunnel and it feels as if some of the weight is coming off my shoulders. We've nearly done eveything now. All the external stuff ie catreing etc is organised while the moving process is soon finishing. We worked all weekend packing mum's stuff and moving our stuff to the new unit. As of today We have moved eveything to the unit that we need. We just now need to move everything from Mum's to the new unit. That will be happening this Friday. Nearly everything is packed so hopefully that will go off without a hitch this Friday. Fibgers crossed.  Hopefully that will give me some time to relax and spend more time with friends (re: jerks). Also looking forward to actually watching some of the manga that I bought and finish reading the Return of the King (Lord of the Rings, Book 3) before it comes out on the big screen this Christmas. I actually bought LOR and the Hobbit as a set 15-16 years ago. I just never got around to reading it. Every time I did start, I couldn't get through it. Although having read most of them now, I do actualy enjoy reading Tolkien and finally get why people think he is such a great author. Someone once told me they read LOR 3 times, in their youth, when they turned 20 and just 2 years ago brfore the movies came out, stating it actually seemed different every time they read it. They later explained this by saying they were a different person every time they read the book. Food for thought. What would other books seem like now if I read them again.  The mighty Southsiders had another loss last week. A rather large one too I might add. It's getting really hard to get regular players. JW, Lefty, Tiger, Coops are all no longer playing. We need new players next season. Maybes and I can play sometimes players aren't what we need. We've only got 6 games left till the season ends. Then 2 semis but I doubt they'll do somethng with us this low in the table. Works out for us because the first semi is the night before the wedding. it would be better if we didn't have that game. I personally haven't played poorer than this basically ever. I am handling the ball way too much, turning the ball over and being very lazy on the boards. My goal for the rest of the season... To go one game where I do not get beat on a box out or turn over the ball once. I actaully had a talk about this last night with Lefty. I asked about what I'm doing now that's so different to what I used to do. He told me quite plainly that I wasn't playing in the post and wasn't using any of my usual tricks**. I used to get open quite often and easily, so I will endeavour to do so from this week on.   Got some new shirts/uniforms for work today. A sky blue polo top. Looks OK and I don't have to wear a tie or a shirt anymore. Reminds me that we should start thinking about new Southsiders uniforms for next year. Orange or Rizzy are the colours I'm thinking of. I think we should stick with basic colours for the new uniforms and a smaller logo this time. 3/4 or maybe even 1/2 the size of the current logo. If we do it earlier we can get samples made up. I'll start working on a design now. What do you guys think.  Anyway thanks for listening. Till next we blog. Peace.  ** One thing I found out a long time ago was that I never really had many good bball skills other than passing. I couldn't jump, I couldn't handle the ball, I was really skinny, streaky shooter and most importantly I was a poor mover off-the-ball. I relied almost entirely on small tricks to get by, like bumping players, quick-release, etc. This meant that I excelled in streetball but struggled in organised ball. I did get better but never well enough to be very good, however I managed to play well above my level in streetball.**

      Hello LTJ cru.  Just wanted to say how much I enjoy reading the posts from everyone.  It's a great way to keep in touch seeing as we're all so busy an' all.  So keep the faith.  Great weekend coming up next weekend.  First Monsterio Delicio at Ki Bar on Friday then the big Northern Soul night on the Saturday - It's free entry and heaps of fun.  Practice those dance moves.  This weekend will be a quiet one in the sense that I won't be going anywhere.  I have had back problems again so I am trying to be very careful with myself so that I can shake my booty down next Friday.  Bru and I will be hard at work on the loops and music for the night - Porse is working Saturday then off to a box seat at the rugby.  Despite the fact that it's not his thang and is to do with work, I'm sure he'll have a great time.  I used to subscribe to a nanotechnology newsletter - I wonder what happened to that?  I am not up to date at all - I've even stopped reading New Scientist....keep us informed Ninesuns!

      So where do we go from here?  The party can't be over just yet?  Well, Porse is having his picnic in New Farm park on Saturday, same place as last time.  I've got the volleyball set all ready to rock.  Then we are heading back to Bellbowrie for a bit of a party.   After that we're going to Livid next month to see J5 and hopefully Prince!  I love Prince.  Let's get a posse together and get Lovesexy.  Looks like Porse and I will be spending out Christmas and New Year in the UK and Paris.  We'd better get saving so we might drop off the 'scene' for a little while......promise to bring back prezzies for you all.  Hope everyone is well and that we can get together soon.

      What a fantastic last week or so.  First the wedding - had a lovely time and got some great pics.  Will scan and send to you Ninesuns and Mint.  Then a bit of a party with Debbie and the champ - you guys are always fun to hang out with.  Got to chill with Bezrock and check out his excellent interviewing skills at aforementioned wedding.  Bru did us proud with his drinking after over a year on the wagon. Congrats to Andre for winning the "Drop It Like It's Hot' comp! Missed the Northern Soul as we were so tired out from all the carousing but headed for the coast again on Sunday for Porse's Versace Birthday experience.    The only 6 star hotel in the Southern Hemisphere - boy did it live up to it's reputation.  Here are some keywords - champagne, eggs benedict, bacon, sausage, mushrooms, smoked salmon, seafood buffet, crisp white wine, deep tissue massage, in house movies, spa bath and bath salts, free cosmetics, more champagne, house music at sunset, margaritas, vodka expressos, rose petals on bed, Lindor chocolates, robes and slippers, chilling by the pool and ROOM SERVICE!

      Hi all. I'm back after a couple of months of study. I'm actually not finished yet. I've still got 1 exam to go but it is 2 weeks away so I've got some wiggle room now.  I saw Kill Bill this week and thought it was an excellent film. Really good soundtrack which set the mood. Great cinematography, and direction. Good performances, I'm not sold on Uma Thurman though. I love Lucy Liu and it's going to be fun to watch Michael Madsen in the next one. I was actually beginning to wonder what had ever happenend to Tarantino and Thurman. They seemed to both disappear. There were also a slew of references to early kung-fu and samurai films.   The violence was a little shocking and unlike others I don't think I ever really got used to it. It made me a little uncomfortable even towards the end. In a way this sort of makes me glad. I don;t thik it was Tarantino's intention to de-sensitize us to it. I think he just wanted to do a real kung-fu flick. In my opinion it definitely wen't beyond the level of violence in the old kung-fu movies. The spraying blood etc was all the same but a few things were different. The major difference I think is the sound. In the past you'd just hear a sharp slice, a thud and screaming. Now your hear sickening thumps, gurgles and tears. A good film though and thoroughly enjoyable. Took fung-fu films to another level by really going to town on the soundtrack and the angles and sets used.    I have thoroughly enjoyed the Rugby World Cup. Talk about putting in. Some of the teams have really commited themselves knowing full welll they were facing world class opposition and proceeded to really stick it to them. Makes you belive in the human spirit when you see that. My favourite team, The cherry blossoms. One of my goals in the next few years is to see them play in Japan. They've just been added to my favourite world sides that I'd love to watch: Top 5 world teams  1. Dutch National Soccer Team in the World Cup in South Africa 2. Cherry Blossoms in Japan 3. Socceroos in the World Cup in South Africa 4. Wallabies in the World Cup Final v France  5. Boomers in the Olympics in China  I just could not belive the heart they displayed against both the Scots and the French. Tackling machines. It seemed that they were just appearing out of the ground in front of the opposition.  Looking forward to going to Thailand. I'm going on the 2nd and I'll be there for a whole month. I can't wait. Itinerary:  I'm getting married again in Bangkok (The Thai version) A few days in Phuket Back to Bangkok for a few days (Highlights: The very exclusive "Right-Hand concert", Temples & shopping) A few days on Koh Pha-Ngan (Highlights: Milkshakes by the beach & Diving) Back to Bangkok to look at future opportunities and relax  Looking forward to the new NBA season. My Mavericks look really good this year. Lebron James whom I told you guys about earlier looks to be the real thing if his first real test was anything to go by. Unfortunately I don't have Foxtel and can't watch the games. I'm trying to work really hard to pay everything off so that I can watch the games next year.  I want to join Capoeira so that I can have a nickname. Andre has one he is called 'Brazil'. Another guy is 'Elastico'. I just hope my nickname isn't something like 'Grande' or something like that.  Work sucks and is becoming political. I hate it. My goal is to one day control my own destiny then being a helpless crew member on this corrupted ship. This rat is ready to jump off at the first opportunity.   Top 5 Kill Bill References to early kung-fu Cinema  1. Shaw Bros opening screen credits. (Shaw Bros are the studios that made many kung-fu films early on) 2. Sonny Chiba is "The Street Fighter" 3. The Yellow "Game of Death" tracksuit (I only wish I had one and could get away with wearing it) 4. Gordon Liu is the "Master of the 36th Chamber" 5. Green Hornet masks  These are the ones I noticed but there are heaps more.  How was J5, I felt bad when I couldn't go. Were they good and what did they do? I can only hope they come back again one day. Are the Beastie Boys ever going to tour here again?  Peace

      Just saw Prince.  He was dope.  Going to buy myself a bass and learn how to be as funky as him. He did all the classics and every lady in the house wanted to make sweet love to him down by the fire.  Seriously thinking about seeing 50 cent.  Anyone want to get a posse together??

      Kill Bill Vol 1 has changed my life.  I have been off work for over a week now with a herniated and slipped disc.  Ouch!  It hurts as much as it hurt my wallet when I had to pay for my CT scan.  It was pretty space age but.  Anyone who hasn't seen Kill Bill - go see it now.

      Thank you Fresh and Ninesuns for the great food and company.    Currently in the grip of World Cup fever - who would have thought it?  We are going to the game on Wednesday night.  Go Fiji!  El's red curry was so good - I have been dreaming about it all morning.  I did so well last week on my diet, I lost 2 kgs.  After yesterday's feast, I put on 2 kgs.  Oh well, at least I broke even.  Looking forward to seeing Prince on the 27th.....Livid is next week too - Jurassic 5, can't wait.  To anyone who likes that sort of thing, the Northern Soul night is on again on the 1st of November.  We are trying to get a posse together as it may be our last night out for about a month or so due to saving up for holiday at X'mas.  Let's have some more blogging action guys, I feel like I'm the only one that ever says anything on here and I am BORING.

      Haven't done much at all this week. Had a haircut on Tuesday and had a nice chat with Debbie and her flat-mate Al. Apart from that just been watching the movies I never had a chance to see through the year. Some good ones too. I thought "Ali" was quite good. Yojimbo was also really good. It got re-made into "Last man standing". It's actually almost a scene-for-scene remake, just using guns instead of swords. Clint Eastwood I think basically based all of his characters on this guy. I think Yojimbo was actually turned into "Fistful of dollars" or "For a few dollars more". Haven't seen them so I couldn't tell you.  I been getting into "Legend of the Condor Hero", the "manga" version and the new "live-action" version. It's so cool to finally get access to an actual kung-fu series and in both formats as well. I can't say the stories match up so far though. They both have the same name & I belive it is quite a famous series as well. I haven't seen enough of them to know where the stories fit on a time-line. Seems like the live-action starts a little before the manga one. Kung-fu stories are just so cool. Kill Bill I think distillated most of the elements of both Samurai and Kung-Fu films and added a great soundtrack. The result is an awesome film.  Been reading "Jack: Straight from the Gut". It's the story of the CEO of General Electric (GE). It's pretty good but then again I'm into this sort of stuff. One thing I've found about being successful is that you can't really copy someone. You need to innovate. In fact I read a few articles about the "innovation" theory of business. For a while lats year the new management "buzzword" was "innovation". They basically said that there will be very few "experts" in the future. The premise being that experts tend to think there is only 1 or a few ways of best doing something. With this attitude there is no real motivation to try something new or innovate. As business becomes more fast-paced and more competitive organisations cannot afford to only imitate. With this strategy they can only aim for No. 2 at best. Therefore under this theory companies should hire those with no experience in the particular field in order to see problems from another perspective and innovate. I believe that there is some credence to this theory. I do belive that organisations need to innovate more and all levels in order to be more competitive but  Idoubt the expert will die out. What I think will happen though is that management and positions which look at strategy, process etc will increasingly be more diverse. For example an engineering firm may eventually hire a marketing CEO instead of an engineer etc in order to chnage things up and ask questions like "Why do we do this, Is it necessary" or "Why don't we do this". That's my two cents on that.  Been falling behind in the housework lately. Need to go through the cupboards for some spring cleaning and need to do the washing and clean the bathrooms. I'll need to get started tonight as I leave on Tuesday and want to catch-up with everybody this weekend. Looking forward to the various lunches, dinners and hanging out to be done this weekend.  Been cooking up a storm lately. Unfortunately it's been the same thing. Pasta. I'm getting pretty good now. Have to find a new recipe. New dishes I'm going to learn to make are:  1. Vietnamese Noodle Salad 2. Gado Gado with Satay 3. Panang Beef  Top 10 fave dishes  1. Spaghetti Bolognaise 2. Gajah Mada Mi Goreng (Fried Noodles from Indonesia) 3. Gado Gado 4. Pork Noodle Soup 5. Tortellini in a cream pasta sauce 6. Lasagna 7. Panang Beef 8. Sushi 9. Thai Green Curry 10.Chicken Tikka Marsala  Had a decent week at work. Spent 1 week in a large dept. figuring out what they do for the project. Went better than I thought it would. I will be making a strong recommendation that special resources be assigned in order to deal with the issues of putting in the system. If we do it the project will succeed. If they don't it will fail simple as that. I'm quite prepared to walk if this doesn't happen. I'm going to start looking when I get back anyway. I'm not being supported at the level above my boss. I can get the support elsewhere or at least get the smae money and a opporunity elsewhere.  I'll have to crack open my comics when I get back and actually read or re-read them. In the Mid 90s I bough a whole heap of comics which I never got a chnace to read. I bought them regularly then put them in a box as I didn;t have a chnace to read them. I don't exactly know how many there are but it would be at least 100 comics. I remember not reading 5 collected titles I bought for basically a year. I was a big collector through high-school and halfway through uni. I unfortunately ran out of money and the titles kept getting more and more expensive. I think they're around $7 to $8 each now. When I first got into them in 1989 they were 1:20 each. That's a rise of nearly 700%. They've really shot themselves in the foot though because comics have become an adult's hobby. They're too expensive and they will lose the next generation of readers. I think that novels and literature in general will also suffer. There's a fairly large bunch of kids that started reading comics, moved to fantasy novels and then into different forms of literature. Combine this with competing media such as film, web, games, tv and literature is definitely going to suffer in the future.  Comic creators are basically going to have to rely on creating the next "iconic character". ie the next Batman, Spiderman, Wolverine etc which they can spin off into other media. Not a bad strategy but not the best either. Relies too heavily on the creating a "buzz" around the character. "Buzz" apparently is the new marketing theory evolving out of viral & guerilla marketing etc. Anyway I think comic creators really lost the plot around 1993-1996. Things were never better for the industry. People couldn't get enough. Titles such as X-Men were spinning off characters from their series into even more series. The original X-Men comic turned into around 10 or more titles. Loyal fans continued to buy the new titles. Then they started creating special editions, chromium covers etc. Intially these were recived very well. Then along came "Image" a newly formed comic label featuring the star creators formerly from DC and Marvel. They rode the crest of the wave and people flocked to the conventions to see them. Prices continued to rise. Then all the comic stores began to open. Where a town would normally have 1 comic store there would now be 3 to 5. This generated a lot of false demand. The companies were getting all of these orders so their projections were becoming larger. They carried on with the creation of spin-offs, special editions, multiple covers etc. This would make the fall even greater. By this time many collectors were becoming quite disnchanted with the whole thing. Prices had risen to 5 times greater and they now had to collect 15 titles instead of five to follow their particular universe. For example a fan of the X-Universe (X-men family) in order to stay abreast of the chnages had to collect not only Uncanny X-man but X-Men, X-Faxtor, X-Force, Wolverine, Generation-X and all the various mini-series Rogue, Gambit, Bishop etc. etc. Fans felt cheated and were running out of money. They left in droves and the fall was very hard indeed. I think Marvel were bankrupt at least twice.  The stragey now I think is to be alternate and small or try to combine all the different media which all contribute to the universe you are creating. The Matrix is a good example. The game. movies and the animatrix all add to the their universe but do not go over the same ground. All the different titles/media deal with different characters and times in the same universe.  Good luck on the exam Jurquette. I miss hanging out with the Jerks. I hope to able to hang out with everyone more next year.  Peace

      Back at work!  Yay!  I had an exam yesterday, all about Superannuation Legislation, Taxation, Preservation, Eligible Termination Payments....exciting stuff.  Put it this way, I will be happy with a pass.  Hope all our LTJ readers out there are happy and well.  Porse is home sick today with a tummy bug....shock horror, he who never takes a day off even when he's dying.  iT'S A NICE CHANGE TO BE AT WORK WHEN HE IS AT HOME....Bloody caps lock!!!  Anyway, if I ever make a lot of money, Porse is so going to be my bitch.  I'll leave the kids with him; I reckon he'd be pretty happy with the househusband arrangement.  Still enamoured with Queer Eye, I just can't get enough of it.  Now that Idol is over, I am watching less telly which has got to be good.  Juliano has been encouraging us to go out more as he is playing at lots of places around town.  Funds are short but we hope to have a night out before we go.  Perhaps we can get a bit of a gang together to celebrate X'mas and support Diores.....please let me know if you are interested.  I will get Porse to ditch the car so that he can enjoy himself.  I'm not drinking alcohol at all until my holiday.....well, that is the plan so far but I realize that I have a work X'mas party next week that I have paid $54 for.....being on a diet means I can't enjoy much of the food and then not to drink??!!  It's hard to stick to resolutions when there is much socializing to be done!

      So glad to hear Mint is feeling a little better.  It is a very complicated situation with being away, being best friends with El, I'm sure her loyalties are torn and she just wants all of her loved ones around her all the time.  I feel for her.  As for your work, it really sounds like it's time to get out. There is nothing stopping you, you have the skills and more qualifications than most people I know. It's funny that you mentioned the poignant side of the Office because in series 2 I found myself feeling even more sorry for the characters especially David Brent who I thought I was incapable of feeling sorry for.  Although it seems like a dim memory now, my two and a half years at Suncorp were quite horrid and it amazes me that I stayed there all that time.  For what?  To try and prove to myself that I was a 'good worker'.  I ended up surmising that if I wasn't a good worker would that be such a terrible thing? There are so many worse things you can be.  I believe in working hard but for the right reasons. It's a worry when your own warped self-perception is your driver for doing something you hate.  Very neurotic.  My new job has been great so far but I am really struggling at the moment.  At the time my back went, there was a team reshuffle and as a result I am on a new whole new team.  The good thing is that my old manager and tech. manager are on this team too, but with being away with my back, coming in sporadically has made me feel like I'm not a part of it and that people are going to judge me by this period of my life.  Before my back happened, I was so focused, now when I'm at work it's like a whole different job, because I'm standing and uncomfortable, my concentration levels are down and I feel muddled in the head!  I'm afraid of making mistakes and losing the respect of my peers.  I told one of my supervisors how I felt and she was very understanding as she had a similar situation that went on for about 5 months and she ended up on income protection of a few weeks but I just won't be happy until I'm in the saddle again. I ended up taking the last two days off.  I can't afford it moneywise - this trip is costing us heaps - but I'm hoping that 4 days in bed will help so that I can take less medication and be more on the ball.  If I didn't have this trip I'd just get a sick note for the full 2 months recovery time but at the back of my mind is always the money. This trip is such a blessing but it seems like I really have to pay for it in other ways to actually go! And when I get really depressed I do stupid things like drink champagne with my painkillers and dance which has set me back (excuse the pun) even more.  After Wednesday, I felt like things were spiralling out of control so I took the 2 days off, have gone on the Atkins diet to try and get healthy, also means no alcohol for at least 14 days and have started gentle walking on the treadmill again.  It has made such a difference in my outlook on things and I am so keen to go back to work on Monday now that I have my positivity to keep me going.  I guess my point is that when things are shit, it is very easy to get stuck in a hole (for me, it's hard not to get self-destructive) or do nothing about it, wait for something to happen to change the situation but it feels so much better if you do something about it yourself, however small.  2003 has been such a mixed year, so much joy, so much confusion, a few obstacles.  I hope 2004 has a bit more joy and less confusion....don't mind the challenges so much, they help us to grow don't they?  DON'T THEY??!?!?  I remember Slam Dunk from ages ago, it was big in HK, you could buy the figures and pencil cases....it was huge there when I was still in high school.  I can't believe it's gone on for so long, that's like 12 years or something, didn't they have comics too, maybe that's how it started.....it must be good.  I never watched it because it was always translated to the Chinese....being the poor Cantonese speaker that I am, I need English subtitles!  I hope we can all get together on the 13th of December at the Northern Soul for a X'mas party.  I know Ninesuns and Tiger will be gone by then so we will do something with you guys before that.  We leave on the 16th of December.  I'm asking the universe with all my heart that my back has sorted itself out for the flight, I am keeping to my side of the deal by taking care of myself (no more dancing for a couple of weeks) so I reckon it will all work out.  We watched some fluff last night - Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle....all it made me do was think how good Kill Bill is (again).  Can't wait for Vol. 2.  Just think, this year Mick and I will be watching the final LOTR in the UK.  I still can't believe it's happening.  Had a dream last night that we were in Wales and I didn't pack enough stuff.  I woke up this morning and decided to start packing asap.

      Guy won. Good for him. Mint is feeling better. The week is over. Been falling asleep on the floor a lot lately. I'll just close my eyes for a second.....ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ  I can't believe I don't have access to the NBA. It sucks.  Netherlands went through to the European Champs beating Scotland 6 - 0. Wow. That's a real demolition, in every sense of the word. Looks like some of the old guard won't be around to partake in the Champs. Kluivert, De Boer & Van Bronckhorst have all done their country proud and I've enjoyed watching them. However their time may be coming to an end. The legacy left behind by the great Ajax team of 95-96 is coming to an end. Sad, really.  Up to Episode 68 of Slam Dunk. only 42 episodes and 4 movies to go. Excellent series imo.  Australia has to down England. Here's hoping it doesn't rain.  Works hasn't been as bad the last 2 days. Must be the calm before the storm. Big moves ahead after Thailand for me.  I'm really poor now. Flat broke till payday this week. This has been an extremely expensive year. It must stop soon.  Long time Jerks  Peace

      I really miss Mint and I'm worried about her. She doesn't seem to be too happy about where she is at the moment. She misses Australia and says she wants to come home. I will go there soon and I hope she will feel better.  I finally finished my studies last weekend. I felt relieved that it was over for a few months. Wasn't as hard as I thought, fear really is all in your mind. Only 1 semester, 3 subjects to go. I also think I've gotten through the most difficult subjects now. Even though I'm doig 1 subject extra, I think next semester will be easier as I won't have such  difficult subjects. I, however, won't be playing bball again that means. Too many subjects. I also want to spend more time with Mint.  I finally ended up watching the office and while I found it funny, I also found it painful to watch and ultimately quite sad. It's really quite sad to realise that most of us spend the majority of our waking life somewhere we hate and spend the rest of the time dreading a return to work. Only to retire and be so programmed for the workplace that you  cannot function without it. Very sad. I really feel sorry for all the characters except for Finch. HE is a real b@$*@rd. It once again affirmed to me that I need to do something. Remember the MAX strategy "No experiments are Failures only a failure to experiment".  Looking forward to the Monsterio Delicio show tonight. I'll have to tape Idol. I hope Guy wins, he deserves it.   Been watching a lot of shows lately. Watched all of the office and some Manga too. It's pretty cool now because with Andre's help, I hooked up the PC to the TV. I'm hoping to get a few more episodes of the Sopranos. I like the show but just never seem to get around to it. I'll have to look at the video stores again to see if they've got more episodes.  Finally saw Battle Royale. Quite a good movie, I liked it. It was interesting to see the how things like crushes, jealousy and all the other teenage stuff they are going through still play a part in the game. What was also interesting was how the girl in the tracksuit to some extent, but mostly the ones in the lighthouse tried to carry on as if nothing happened. Making lunch etc. Andre told me once that he saw footage during WW2 of people in business attire dodging tanks during the invasion to try and get to work. It seems that our habits, customs, social norms etc. are so important to us that we will cling to them even to the end. Or maybe when your're world is turned upside-down those little social graces are what keeps from totally losing it.   Saw the Rugby world Cup as well. The wallabies really looked like world-beaters on Saturday night. Mortlock and Tuqiri are unstoppable while England is the most boring team on the planet. Wales scored 3 tries to their 1, France scored a try and they didn't. The rules need to be changed. 1 for a drop-goal. Two points only for a penalty kick. Maybe even  less, maybe 1 as well. That will definitely promote the runnning game. If you want a bit of fun on the night, I think Roy & HG might be covering it for Triple J. Their work on the Origin series is absolutely hilarious but it's even better when they really hate one of the teams ie Manly. So this should be even better as it will be open slather with the English. Just switch on the radio before the game to see if they are on. Remember England are chokers. They haven't won anything since "66".  How are you feeling now Jurquette. I hope you are feeling better. Maybe a little less dropping it like it's hot and a little more setting it down like its lukewarm. Things will get better.  Top 5 things to do this week.  1. Make Mint feel special 2. Watch Monsterio Delicio & Friends 3. Clean the unit & do the washing 4. Clean the car 5. Go through my junk

      Feeling pretty crap at the moment. Mint left for Thailand this week so that is getting me down. I know I'll see hear again in two weeks though. The problem that won't end soon is work. I think it's actually starting to affect my health. I'm not feeling like myself at all. I'm getting a lot of pressure from the various stakeholders involved and my confidence and fervour is waning. My goal in life now must be to strike out on my own. I cannot possible go on like this forever. When I'min Thailand I will most definitely search for some opprtunities.  Good news on the study front. I'm nearly finished. I got back my results for 1 subject and found that I did quite well. Only got 1 more exam to go this year. This is the toughest subject in the whole course for me. I'm doing OK too. I've just got to pass this exam and it wil be over for this year.   I've been so apprehensive about the exam that I've avoided studying and found anything else to do. Yesterday however I sat down and studied a quarter of it and found that it wasn't as hard as I first thought. I strated to get it and now I've now nearly learnt 1/4 of the content of the exam. I'll finish that 1/4 tonight. I've got the next two whole days to go through the rest but I'm thinking I may have a better chnace of passing now. I've still got to do it though. Once again I've found that the fear comes from not knowing and once you do it you wonder why you were ever scared.  I've got Battle Royale now but I'll have to wait till after the exam on Saturday to watch it. It will be a fine prelude to the Rugby semi-final which I'll watch straight after. I had sneak peek and heard the music at the beginning. I've heard it before and must admit it's the perfoect choice. I stopped there though as I didn't want to tempt myself into watching before the exams. I actually managed to read "Mistress of the Empire" while procrastinating. Just one more chapetr then I'll study. 2 days later, book finished but no study done at all.   I hope you feel better Jurquette. You're too good a person to be in that sort of pain. The universe will right itself in due course. Just hold on and don't lose hope.  Peace

      I'm having a really bad time at the moment.  My back gets better so I start doing my normal activities and then it flips out again.  I have to go back to the doctor again today for more anti-inflammatories - which means a) money b) I'm not at work therefore not making money and c) feeling shit about not being at work.  I've missed out on so much due to this bloody problem (rugby game at Suncorp, spent 1 hr at Livid, couldn't go to Trevor's thing, El s thing) and it's starting to make me very depressed.  I don't know what to do so I'm going to go to Dr Denzin (he's a good doctor) today to beg for help!  Work keep telling me to go off on income protection but I can't see myself doing that - it's like going on the dole or something - I don't feel comfortable. I can't sit down for more than half an hour without discomfort. I am doing the best I can at work by standing up at my workstation but by 5pm all the muscles in my back are complaining, not to mention my feet!  Anyway, enough of my whinging - I just feel a bit down and wanted you guys to know just in case I sound a bit cold or I don't see you guys for a bit or whatever.  I don't know.  Don't want to piss anyone off.    The upside is that when I drink alcohol with the medication I'm on, my back doesn't hurt at all!  Until the next day.  Another upside is......um.....let me think about that one and get back to you.

      Great to hear you had a good time in Cairns - you should talk to Porse cos he lived there for a while.  Hey 9suns, where did you stay at Palm Cove?  We stayed at the Angsana but never made it to the reef or to the kuranda rail thingy.  That's what duty free vodka does to you.  Not watching Survivor I'm sorry.  It's strictly Neighbours, Idol and Queer Eye round here with stints of Futurama & Father Ted on DVD.  Mick got Ring 2 - japanese version the other day.  We are planning on watching it one evening this weekend for maximum fear factor.  Julien and I are DJing at Ric's on the 19th of this month.  Yes, it's a Wednesday so I don't expect any worker bees to come but just in case you ain't upta anything.  7 weeks until HK/UK and Mick and are are totally broke.  Going to have a great time getting to know the family intimately, it seems.  : (

      Cairns was a hoot. We went there on Friday night and left on Monday morning. I was really surprised. Cairns is a really great town. Really designed for tourists and students. There seems to be a fun vibe happening all over the place. Restaurants everywhere and happy tourists with heaps of touristy places to go. Quite a fun place and very cosmopolitan with all the tourists and international students. I don't exactly know how much work is going on besides tourism. There seems to be heaps of people but no office buildings. The complete opposite to Brisbane. Brisbane needs to get some tourist attractions. I'm sorry but the Science Centre just doesn't cut it for me. What Cairns has is the equivalent of having King George Square, Southbank, A port, The Mall and the markets and heaps of restaurants all in one area. We need to do more in this area here in Brisbane. Not enough in town.   We stayed at Palm Cove, that's where Mum and Dad are staying. It's around 30 mins out of Cairns. Very pretty and quiet. Nice clean beach with a smaller crowd. Good if you just want to chill out. More for the older tourists but not a a lot of restaurants etc. It seems like my mum has been on vacation for 6 months now. Dad lives like 3 mins from his work and they've got heaps of time to do things.    On Saturday we started out by going to Kuranda via Skyrail and back via the Train. If you want to get fleeced, spend heaps of time in Kuranda. I think we spent too long out there. It may have been better if the markets were open. However they weren't and the train back was train is hot, slow and not as good the Skyrail. If I could do it all again I would go over via Skyrail, find a restaurant, have lunch then go straight back via Skyrail. The skyrail is more spectacular and cooler than the train. We were picked up directly from the hotel by the tour operator which was convenient. Skyrail Good (45 mins) Train Bad (1.5 hours).  Then we went to a Restaurant and I payed $40 for Seafood Jambalaya. It was good but I don't think it was worth $40. Anyhoo the service and atmosphere were quite good. The wait staff were very helpful and were all internationals. They had staff whom could speak everything from Japanese, Chinese, korean, Spanish, German, French etc. They also had menus in different languages as well. Thiis was really awesome I thought. This happens everywhere. All the staff everywhere can speak more than 1 language, Awesome. You don't have to pay heaps to eat well though. There are heaps to choose from.   On Sunday we got picked up at Palm Cove by the "Reef Rocket" and went to Green Island. This was a blast and I highly recommend it. We looked at Coral, fish and turtles through the glass bottom boat and Yellow submarine which was Very cool. We didn't go snorkelling though as we weren't prepared. There were so many fish that you could see them in plain view from the jetty. The reason there are so many fish etc because it's a national park an no one can fish or take animals from there. A good example of how man and nature can live together.   You should also check out the Rusty markets in Cairns. Cheap fruit. I had heaps of Mango. We came back Monday morning and I wish that we could have stayed longer. What was J5 like guys? Also if anyone reading this has got access to ESPN please let me know. I'm willing to pay money for someone to get me tapes of NBA games.   Everytime I turn on the Rugby I see a minnow beating a world power, only to see them lose. I must be emitting some sort of field which dimishes the power of the underdog. This is in sharp contrast to my actual love of the underdog.   Top 3 World Cup upsets I've spoiled by turning on the TV  1. Samoa Vs England 2. Japan Vs France 3. Wales vs New Zealand  This series of Survivor is really good. Good mixture and clashes of personality. We're all big fans at home. Rupert is the Man. Guy deserves to win Australian Idol. Slam Dunk is one of the coolest series I've ever seen, it does move a bit slow though.  Peace

      Hello from Wales - we are slowly getting pissed on Bloody Marys - and looking forward to my dad's curry tonight, he is doing a rogan josh and a chicken tikka marsala.  Mick and I love this place despite the gloomy weather - the house we are staying at is just beautiful and my relatives are party animals who won't let us not drink.  Even Aaron has been on the vodka.  Should make for an interesting game of Cranium after dinner. Hope the jerks are kepping the lurve alive and can't wait to see you when we come back.  Mwah mwah!

      Greetings from Honkers. Porse and Jurquette are alive and well after an extended journey via Singapore.  Porse managed to get a considerable amount of sleep but I am feeling throughly shagged.  We are back on a plane tomorrow at 8am to go back via Singapore and on to London.  From there I believe it is a 3 hour drive to Wales.  Woo hoo!  We have been out shopping already and Korean BBQ is on the cards for tonight if I can stay awake.  I'm looking forward to doing some shopping on the way back through, there are so many bargains to be found.  Until the next travel blog - hopefully from Singapore Airport tomorrow - hope youse are all grouse!!!

      Man, work is so tough with this standing up business. By the time Thursday comes around, I'm starting to feel old. I can't wait until I get paid next week so that I can start budgeting for this holiday (don't know how much I'm going to get with holiday pay etc).  11 days until we fly to Hong Kong.  I have started some packing but it's proving to be harder than expected.  I am trying to travel light but so far I have a pretty full case.  Winter stuff takes up so much room!  We have our work Christmas party tomorrow.  I'm quite excited because this is the first and only Christmas party we'll be going to in Australia this year.  It's open bar with finger food plus karaoke!  Woo hoo!  I haven't had any alcohol in a while, plus I've been on Atkins so it will be interesting to see whether I have the bottle to get up and sing after a few champagnes or whether I'll just be messy.  The diet has been good for me.  I've lost around 4 kgs so far.  I've found it difficult at times with cravings but overall, it hasn't been too bad.  I hope to catch up with Porse's family this weekend.  Lew is going to PNG and won't be back before we fly out so it would be nice to see everyone before then.  I'm already thinking forward to next week - we have a team day so in the afternoon we'll be leaving work and heading to the park for a picnic.  Then I hope we can all get together on the 13th at the Northern Soul night to say goodbye before Christmas.  I keep having dreams about babies.  It's freaking me out.  Biological clock, yes, it could be, but the dreams are never very pleasant.  I've always forgotten to feed them or they are mutated or something.  Less cheese before bedtime, methinks.  Aaron is 16 on the 6th of January.  Cripes.  That means I am 31 next year.  I'm not quite sure how I feel about that.   Did I mention that Porse and I are going to see Roy Ayres at the Jazz Cafe in London?  I'm pretty stoked because he was so good at Byron.  We're staying at the Camden Lock Holiday Inn....not exactly to my usual 5 star taste....should be interesting!

      Sitting here waiting for Bru to come back from the shop with a coke.  I am on the coke diet.  I'm not going to eat any food, just drink my favourite beverage which I have tried in vain to give up! Why aren't I at work you may ask?    Well, I came back from holiday short of my daily medication and couldn't get into the doc to get more during 'out of work' time so I kinda left it, thinking I could get by for a week or so.  Bad idea.  Made myself very sick.  Let's leave it at that (there's more but I'm kinda embarrassed).    I go back to work tomorrow but I have to do stuff like increase my medication and go to counselling.  Blah!  Something to do with upsetting my chemical imbalance which has to now be redressed. Nothing serious.  Apart from the fact that I feel like killing myself at every waking moment......sounds dramatic but it is true.  The only way I can describe it is that half of me is fine and the other half is itching to bludgeon my own head in.  Fortunately the doctor says this is common and treatable. Mick and his family are rallying round so it should be a minor blip.  God I hope that doesn't sound too bad....it really isn't you know, I haven't even told my parents because I know they will worry.  HAPPY STUFF!  Porse and I are paying off out debts this year as we are planning to live and work overseas in 2005.  You may see less of us out and about and Bru is moving out here for a while - but we're going to get the house really rocking so that we have plenty to do on the weekends.  I'm told I'm going to have to give up my Bollinger habit but it will be worth it in the long run.    We are thinking Hong Kong and the UK as possible destinations - main reason being the proximity to other countries we are keen to visit.  It doesn't make sense to be in debt here, work for a year for a big holiday and then start again from scratch.  Australia is just too far away for what we want to do for the next few years.  When we are ready to settle down and do the mortgage thing, I'm sure we'll be back.  My dad said he went through a similar experience after a few years here and is so glad to be back in HK even though eventually they will come back.  Our holiday was really fantastic.  I have a great affinity for the UK and Wales which was quite strange as the weather isn't the best but the people I met and the old friends I caught up with were so brilliant. Not to mention my aunt and uncle that we stayed with, they made us feel like royalty.  We are planning to go back again this year in October as my dad is singing at the Royal Albert Hall in a welsh male voice choir.  Major highlights in total random order:-  1. Playing with my dad's friend's iguana in Liverpool. 2. Holding my dad's friend's Eagle Owl (4 ft tall) and kissing it. 3. Seeing Roy Ayers play at the Jazz Cafe. 4. Finding out that Roy Ayers was staying on floor above us at hotel. 5. Meeting up with DJ friend Andy and going to Blackmarket records (an experience in itself). 6. Driving down the M4 with Aaron listening to Dizzee Rascal at full blast. 7. Mick surprising me with an O.D.M watch from Trendy Plaza in Hong Kong. 8. Seeing Kieran from Big Brother 2 in the ladies markets in Mong Kong, and saying g'day. 9. Having brunch at the Brasserie (again) and getting the mad dealz from our old pal Alson. 10. Getting a beer from 7-11 at 2am whilst having a DVD marathon at folks flat. 11. Buying 'God of Cookery' on DVD for $20HK from HMV ie not pirate. 12. Arriving in London around 6pm after 24 - 30 hours of no sleep to find Aunt and Uncle have hired huge minibus and that the weather really wasn't that cold. 13. Driving round London in a huge minibus with the whole family, completely lost for about 3 hours trying to drop Leah off at her friends place and cheering every time we saw a Marks and Spencers.  True Grizwald experience.  14. Arriving in Wales at 1:30 am after mammoth bus ride and doing tequila slammers to celebrate. 15. Catching up with cousins that I hadn't seen in years to find they were so cool and friendly - Darren making me envious with his upcoming mad travel adventure, Mike (who said I rapped like Dr Evil) with his beautiful girlfriend Amy, Anne-Marie looking gorgeous and with a ballsy attitude to match, the lovely Selena and her fiance Aaron, and last but certainly not least, the irrepressible Zack who I wanted to take home with me. 16.Jamming with old band mate Jon on his piano after he cooked us awesome roast dinner with yorkshire puddings. 17. Getting drunk on champers with Bryony at the World's End Pub then stumbling to the pizza place where we subsequently scored ganja and charlie off a dodgy rasta guy named Ricky. 18. Teaching my Aunt, her friend and my little cousin how to freestyle, then watching Aaron drunkenly busting a Del rap. 19. Capturing it all on video. 20. Sneaking up to the attic to play pool, watch TV and eat vast quantities of our favourite UK junk food - Jaffa Cakes, Frazzles, Monster Munch, Cheddars, Munchies - the list goes on. 21. Waking up in a snow covered farm on the day before we were leaving and having a snowball fight with mum. 22. Watching the final two episodes of the Office on Boxing Day and the day after where it all comes together. 23. Having the best Bloody Marys on Singapore Airlines made by the beautiful stewardesses. 24. Celebrating Aaron's 16th Birthday in Dan Ryans where my dad ordered the mixed grill which was so big we couldn't stop laughing.  He was warned before he ordered it but remained indignant that he could handle it. 25. Seeing my dad don a bib saying "I heart ribs" before commencing the gargantuan mixed grill. 26. Staying at the Peninsula Hotel - Porse, Aaron and I having room service with the table positioned right in front of the harbour view.  Singapore Slings and Peninsula burgers all round.  Phew.  There is so much more.......but then again there will be more to come. Hope all you jerks are well and hope to see you soon.  Love Jurquette

      Work sucks hardcore. I'm currently exploring my options. We'll see how far I've come in the last 2 years. The management here sucks and I want to work closer to home (CBD). I miss Mint so to keep myself occupied I've been playing a lot of PS2. Andre's already completed 1 game, Beyond Good & Evil. A pretty good game from what I saw. Ubisoft have a few good titles out at the moment. XIII, Beyond Good and Evil and Prince of Persia: Sands of Time. I think a big year for them in 2004. I still remember playing the original Price of Persia in 90 - 91 when they were the first to develop Rotoscoping. The ability to display a wider range of movement when changing direction, turning around etc. Previously sprites would simply just go in the opposite direction when turning. I've been mostly playing NCAA. It's a pretty good game. Tends to become quite easy after a while. The nifty feature I like is that because it is a university/college game, players retire after their senior year and this allows you to recruit new players just finishing school to play for your university. It's pretty good to build squads for the future. It's fun.  I want to get a new PC because we've been so busy doing other things that it's hard to get time on the PC for playing games. Maybe soon. At the moment I'm really into this anime called Legend of the Condor Heroes. The story is from the first book of a famous Chinese Kung-Fu trilogy. The other books in the series are called Legendary Couple and Heaven Sword and Dragon Sabre by Louis Cha. There have been many movies, series, comics etc retelling these stories. They're actually pretty good. I'm actually also watching the Condor Heroes Chinese TV show as the episodes become available. I'v become a really big fan of the CH Anime theme song. It is sort of Japanese Pop/Rock but I like it. What can I say? Also been listening to the Kill Bill Soundtrack, Jazzland Revisited and 100% Acid Jazz. Jazzland's really good and I like the Acid Jazz CD but the Kill Bill soundtrack didn't wow me as much as it did in the cinema. It think the music selected needs the images to give it more substance though when used is very complementary.   I heard some pretty good news last night. You may recall me talking about a HK comic book I used to like back 10 years ago that stopped printing. Well due to popular demand they may be re-releasing the title and maybe some other classic Kung Fu titles in a large monthly anthology. So youd get maybe 2 - 4 comics in one large book(200 pages - Common in Japan) every month. How cool is that. I hope it goes through. I'd be one of the first to pre-order. Anyway at the moment I've got heaps of stuff to go through. I've got to clean out all our junk and I've got so many books, comics, mvies etc to get through. I continually acquire stuff and I've got no way of catching up. Only last weekend I finished wactching all the Sopranos DVDs form the first series. A good show I might add. I'll have to work on it.   I hope I can catch up with the jerks soon since they've come back from hols. I'll contact you.   Till next blog

      Got back from Thailand on Saturday. Had a great time. Spent most of it visiting relatives & friends, shopping and eating. We also spent a fair amount of time seeing the sights and visiting the islands. We were very busy and although I had a blast I would like to spend more time on the next trip just chilling and not going anywhere.  Fake Diesel clothing is everywhere. If you're going to buy it make sure it is very different from what's generally available or you will really look like a tourist (silly).  Places we went  Phuket   Quite nice, Savoey restaurant was excellent, Day trip to Koh Phi Phi was spoiled by wet weather, saw where they filmed "The Beach". One of the holiday highlights was the PA guy on the Phi Phi ferry. You WILL enjoy the scenery. These people came to the islands 200 years ago, THEY ARE NOT THAI PEOPLE etc. I was laughing with him almost the whole trip. Try to travel when the sea is calm, take the seasick tablets and chew the small sour fruits availale on-board, surprisingly... they work. Got a major bargain with Fresh's help. Hoodie being sold by a vendor with very red eyes originally listed price at 850 Baht. Got it down to 350. Try to wear shirts which are noticably Thai but not something any tourist would buy. Diesel T-shirts don't count. They will know that you know what the general price for things are.  Koh Pha Ngan  Very nice. Gracious hosts whom welcomed us into their family for a week. Took us everywhere and I had heaps of fun riding in the back of the Ute. Oceanview resort is the best resort on the island. OK Bungalow was better than OK. Very fun atmosphere heaps of international long-term travellers. They book 1 month at a time. Heard about a Swiss man whom looks after a beach accesible only by boat for a local business-man, He's been there for 10 years. Food is nice.  Shopping in Bang Kok  ** Central is the name of a chain of shopping centers. ie Central Bang Na, Central Rama III  - PS2 games @ Central RAMA III or Yeo Han (Fortune Center) - PC games Any IT section of a shopping center shoudl have them. Best  selection I found was @ Yeo Han. - DVDs at Yeo Han or some IT sections - Clothes, surprisingly the best was a small shop on Phi Phi called Narcotica. In Bangkok MBK, upstairs in most of the Central shopping centers. In general T-shirts cost around 200 baht up to 300. Shirts around the same. - House items - Chatu Chak or JJ markets. Now open all week for homewares and furniture.   - Traditional favourites  Patunam for clothes (Didn't go there beacuse too hard to park and difficult to get around as is very crowded. Can be hard to find good stuff but there is heaps to look through. Best prices. No Air-Con.  JJ markets for clothes, homewares, accessories etc.. (Only open Saturday and Sunday) NO Air Con, Extremely busy on the weekends very hard to walk. Absolutely no parking. Toliets for the ladies are not so good.)  Pantip for Games, DVDs etc (Hard to park and far way from where we were staying)  Touristy Stuff  - Jim Thomson house (Nice) - Floating Market (Good, remember to tour around the canal areas, It's great to see how people live around the canals. The canals don't smell) - Ancient City Theme park. Go in December and travel on a bike to get a good feel for things. Take the day. You'll discover a lot about Thai culture and architecture. There are many restaurants. - Emerald Temple, worth seeing once in your life - PP Farm (Cool Ostrich Farm)  - Chulalongkorn's Mansion. Mad dealz. Go visit.  - Kao Sarn Road (Not what I expected)  Food  Good at most places. Noodles on the street are very good and available everywhere. Eat some Rotee off the street. It's a fried pancake and is normally eaten with condensed milk. I had one with Banana and Chocolate. Awesome. If you love seafood you're in luck, it's served everywhere.  Food Loft was the best restaurant we went to. If you go to Bangkok you should check it out. Savoey was very good. Oceanview resort is very good too. Chinatown is mad.  Tastiest food - Crispy skin chicken & Pork Ribs (Da best)   Movies  Movies are really cheap. Around $3.50 for a normal seats which are better than in Oz. Gold class is around $9 - $12, I think. Go watch one. We saw LOR and Once upon a time in Mexico. It was an honor to stand before each movie for the King's song, which is very stirring I might add.  I love the King. He is everything a king should be. He is actually noble.   People are nice everywhere especially in the country.   What you can't get in Thailand. - The latest shoes at good prices. HK is the best for that.   Great things happening in Thailand  OTOP The Elite Card/Club Subways from next April (They're free until August) CEO Govt Management System War declared on Drugs, Poverty and Corruption  Payed a 400 baht fine for overstaying 2 days, I heard about someone who had a 20,000 baht fine. That's 100 days over.  More later. Peace  PS Work sucks I already hate it

      We leave Hong Kong tomorrow.  : ( I wish I had one more day.  However, I am looking forward to seeing you all and finding out if our pets are oaky.  I wonder if Bootsy will remember us??  We stayed at the Peninsula hotel last night - it was as joushie as it gets.  Aaron wouldn't leave until Mick pretended to call my mum.  Back to work on Wednesday - will be a shock to the system but I am looking forward to it.    Still more shopping to be done, better go!

      Welcome back guys, glad you had a good trip. Also happy to hear you will be going O/S. Fresh doesn't want to gp back to Thailand so I thinkI might be here for a while. Where will you go and what will you guys do?  Sorry I haven't been round to see anyone lately. I have had to work most weekends since I've been back also been working when I get home a bit too.  Things happening in the land of the Suns  Weeping that I do not have pay TV, I can no longer watch NBA games. So busy that I've been sleeping at 1 or 2 in the morning. Project is reaching go-live and while it won't be a total disaster it is FUBAR. My job fills me with dread, I don't look forward to waking up in the morning.  We are frightened to death of losing jobs that we hate.  Applications are going slowly. Brazil is still looking for work. As low as the unemployment rate is it is still quite hard to find work.  I need a haircut. The house is still pretty busy and not organised. It's been moved about on my to-do list for the past 3-4 weeks. Of all the games I have only been playing NCAA basketball and building my dynasty. Not going as well as I'd hoped. This must be what GMs go through but 100 times worse.  Still missing Fresh as she is not back yet.   I want to watch God of Cookery. Still haven't watched Infernal Affairs yet.  Being captain of the Oz cricket team guarantees you will be Australian of the Year. We can look forward to Ricky Ponting to be judged the best of the best in 4-6 years time when he retires.

      This blog is getting static again, I think I will have to invite more members!!!!  Who am I kidding - I guess I'm the only one who is nerdy enough to blog all the time.    Top 10 things I have been doing recently:  1.  Taking shitloads of medication 2.  Bonding with Bootsy - I'm in love. 3.  Hanging out with Bru, watching the Midday Movie on 7 and predicting the synopsis. 4.  Going to the doctor, talking to work and arranging a rehab plan - ie back to work on reduced hours for a spell.  The government ain't so bad! 5.  Seeing little of Porse (the little workhorse) as his boss had a heart attack and is in hospital. 6.  Watching DVDs sent over from HK - Monster (v.good) and Golden Chicken 1 & 2 (very funny canto comedy). 7. Playing Mario Cart on Beza's gamecube. 8.  Not drinking. 9.  Getting more and more outraged by President Bush and his cronies. 10.Severe addiction to several reality shows - The Hothouse, The Resort, My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance and the one and only Queer Eye!  Anyway, big up the Mullet Beza!  Ant and Bez came over to see us the other weekend and it wos very nice.  Bez has borrowed the Office series one and two and I think he is enjoying it.

      Hi y'all.  The blog's been pretty quiet - just thought I'd post to say that I am still alive but there are a few issues going on in my life at the moment so please don't think that we have disappeared just yet.  I haven't been to work for a while now but all that's set to change tomorrow!  I will be almost normal again I hope.  I have to take quite a lot of medication every day and have to get a blood test today (yuk), renew drug scripts etc but from then on, it's business as usual. I have to go to a psychiatrist every week which costs a bomb, even with Medicare. Due to lack of funds, I don't think we'll be going out for a while but if anyone feels like paying a visit, get in touch and we'll catch up.  Even better, get  Porse  out and about, he has been worrying about me and working so hard, he probably needs some time out with the boys.  Anyway hope everyone else is well - if you feel like reading something really interesting, my cousin Darren is travelling around South America and beyond - he is blogging as he goes and I love living vicariously through him.  Check it - http://www.speedytravels.co.uk/blogger.html

      Good morning jerks.  Hope you are all well and getting through life with the minimum of hassles.  I don't like to whinge but I have had my fair share of dramas of late and I am trying to keep my head above water at the moment.  Firstly, I feel a bit of a lab rat because my anti-depressant medication hasn't been working.  I have just started taking something called Efexor - XR after years of taking another type called Cipramil.  It is taking a bit to get used to, I am sleeping irregularly and I have little to no appetite (hey, isn't that every fat chicks dream???!).     I also tend to get sleepy in the afternoon.  Luckily my psychiatrist has put me on leave for this week and gradual return to work over the next 6 weeks for three days a week commencing next Monday.  Ninesuns, I hope to be able to catch up with you one of those days as I will be working until 1:30pm, perfect time to grab some lunch (or for me to watch you, Mint and Tangmoe eat!)   I am pretty stressed as finances are stretched but I have at least another month before things get bad so  am hoping to be back at work and recovered by that time.   Unfortunately there was an incident over the last two days that has affected me profoundly which I just have to get off my chest.  Over a week ago, Leah rang to speak to Steve. (This is weird because he has only met her a few times and has no idea why she keeps ringing to arrange things with him) As I was asleep down the other end of the house and it was fairly early, I asked her to ring back to see if Steve would pick up the other phone down his end of the compound, heh heh.  I have been trying not to get involved in Leah's conversations with Steve because they involve her arranging to come over and pick up items from storage in the garage.  Each time she is asked if she has everything and it's all cool but the following week, there is always another phone call.  On one occasion she has rung to say she is coming over and not turned up at all, while we've waited at home all day for her.   Well, on Tuesday, I was graced with another one of those calls except this time it was 2pm, I was asleep in bed after suffering a headache and nausea - just another one of the side effects of my Efexor - XR on top of which I take 1000mgs of Lithium and 2 mgs of Xanax for anxiety.  Suffice to say I was bombed out of my mind and needed some 'quiet time'.  Once again she asked to speak to Steve but first she asked how I was and I explained I was on the second day of my new drug and it was a bit yuk.  I told her that Steve was out and wouldn't be home until the evening.  Of course she wanted to get some things from the garage again.  I found this a bit odd as she turned up unannounced the week before and Steve had helped her to get more stuff.  Trying to stay out of it, I suggested that she ring Mick who would be home at 6pm.  This was not good enough for Leah who suggested that I leave the door unlocked and she would come in whilst I was in bed as it would "only take a few seconds'.  Now call me paranoid but I don't like the idea of being fast asleep, alone in the house with the doors unlocked.  I refused to do that but said again that Mick would be home at 6pm.  Leah then hung up on me.  I called Steve to try and work out what was going on as he had only just helped her with her stuff.  The two items she wants is her electric piano and some roller blades.  In fact when she was over last, Steve offered to help her with these items but she said they were not necessary.   Obviously I was a bit cut about being hung up on in the state I was in - her initial concern for my health swiftly evapourated when she was told that she might have to wait 4 hours to come around and collect her stuff as that was when the braun would be home - kitten weak Zoe wasn't going to be of any help and to be honest, after the constant messing around, the way I was feeling physically and mentally, I really didn't want to get involved.   Porse, Bru and I all had a bit of a discussion about it that night and promptly forgot about it because we expected that there would be another call shortly.   What we did not expect was a call from my dad last night saying that Leah was threatening to break into the house or call the police in order to get her stuff!!!  I could not believe what I was hearing, I thought my dad might have got the wrong end of the stick and explained to him that she had been offered to come around at 6pm the day before and that breaking in or calling the police might be somewhat premature.  From there I called my mum who explained that Leah had lost her job so was eager to sell some of her stuff.  When Porse got home he was furious because he is the one that stacks everything up in storage in the garage and has offered countless times to drop everything off to her as he drives a work truck.  She has always turned us down (apart from the times she's needed help in moving house) and insists on coming around to pick up random items rather than the whole lot.   Porse got her home number and rang to speak to Leah to get to the bottom of everything but she kept hanging up on him.  She said that he'd better call my dad to discuss the state of the house since we've been living there (1. Relevance? 2. God am I glad I took those photos of what the house was like when Leah asked us to move in so she could do a runner to Hong Kong.  Mum cried when she saw them.  Dad refused to look because he knew he would be heartbroken). Porse tried to get an arrangement sorted out but after being hung up on he left 3 messages telling her to grow up and deal with the issue at hand as Leah started raving about things that had nothing to do with the collection of her items. Porse immediately rang my dad; they get along very well and my dad advised that Porse and Steve should deal with it all as I was not in a fit state to be involved.   Porse then rang back to tell Leah that he had spoken to her dad and there didn't seem to be a problem so what did she want us to do about her stuff?  Her boyfriend Jay answered and Porse said "Who's this, oh Jay, how you going mate?"  The response was, "I'm not your mate, don't call me your mate, you're attacking my woman, you shouldn't be leaving messages on my phone, I have flatmates here, perhaps I should come round with them to sort things out"  Porse was flabbergasted and just said that there should be no beef between him and Jay, the problem was with trying to set up an arrangement to get Leah's stuff - that we were the ones being threatened with break ins or police action.  Bearing in mind that it was only the day before that she asked to come over and 6pm as a time was rejected by her, I felt like I had entered the twilight zone.  Police action, break-ins and the beating up of my boyfriend was all on the cards over an electric piano and rollerblades.  Leah was then put on the phone to Porse and did this "Stop shouting at me" act in front of the boyfriend to rile him up (Porse was in fact laughing at the lies that she was spewing) and completely denied the threats about police and breaking in.  Most unfortunate for her as she said this to both my mum and my dad!   I was seriously worried about the threats made to Porse so I rang my dad and told him what had transpired. Dad made an arrangement now that if she wants to get anything from the house, she has to organize a time with my dad who will arrange this with Porse or Bru.  This Jay character is not allowed to come over to our place at any time and my mum is ringing him today to address the threats - we have never met Leah's boyfriend, all we know is that he's 36, has two kids and is a kiwi.  If first impressions are anything to go by it ain't a good one.  We don't know whether they are idle threats or whether we have to watch our backs. My mum thinks the world of Porse and is NOT happy.  I'm still trying to work out what it has to do with Leah's boyfriend anyway.  The lastest I heard from my dad is that Jay said that Mick 'fronted up' to him so he did the same back.  How the hell he got that out of Hey Jay how you going mate - I will never know.

      BIFDEE ANNOUNCEMENT!  I am having some very low-key drinks after work on Friday to celebrate my 31st birthday which is on the 31st.  That won't be happening again so I thought it was worth a get together.  Any excuse really.  We've decided to go to Jorge which is on George St, just up a bit from Irish Murphy's (which is on the corner of George and Elizabeth).  I don't think it will be a late one, as Porse is driving and we are going to Missy Elliott and the Northern Soul night on da Saturday.  They have food if you wish to have dinner and I'm sure they have snacky or tapas type stuff if you just want to nibble.  Gonna sent out an e-mail to get numbers as I may book un table pour le partay.  I just got paid for the first time in aaaaages and I am high on bucks woo! For some reason this is triggering that Christina Milian song in my head so I'm going to strut off to the shower and commence my going to work preparations.  As for BB4, I heart Merlin, and Paul is a fucker, a mother fucker and a father fucker.  I have voted many times now to see him gaaaaaaawn.  Porse was sad to see the end of Paradise Hotel, that weird US show that he got me into and we are still fighting about Charla.  TV is pretty addictive at the moment.

      Hit the ballistics G!  Man o man I am strugglin'!!  Work is getting me down - I am on this rehab plan but the universe is foiling my attempts (with bugs, migraines, negative thinking) to get back in the hotseat.  Not that there is a hotseat, I stand at work to prevent further damage to my lower back.  All of which points to the fact that I reckon I'm a bit of a fatty these days and could do with losing a few extra pounds.  Perhaps then my health would improve!  I'll start tomorrow.  Yeah right.  I had a fucked up nightmare the other night.  First I was in HK and was about to kill myself and went to my parents for help who basically told me to get stuffed, then it cut to me watching Iraqi prisoners getting their eyes gouged out by American soldiers who then forced them to eat 'em up in a soup made with the inmates own dung.  Where does this evil muck come from and why is it in my sleeping head?  Mind you, last night I dreamt I was going out with Prince so that kinda made up for it.  Don't know if it's the medication but I've been slipping off to little fantasy lands recently, call 'em crushes....Porse knows all about it so there is no disrespect there, especially as I have to wipe drool from his face every time Beyonce is on TV, inna magazine, on CD cover etc so here are my Top 5 Crushes at The Mo (if I was single, thin and looking for a companion)  1. Merlin from Big Brother 4 (Please don't diss, I'm a sucker for a sensitive guy) 2. Prince 3. Angelina Jolie 4. Dizzee Rascal 5. Lazy Grey - Brothers Stoney   Here's what's hot in the land of Jurquette....  1. Pictionary 2. The Sims/Bustin' Out for PS2 3. Wes and Helena having a sprog, Ethan 4. KIll Bill Vol. 2 5. Paradise Hotel Finale  Yo Jack that be Wack....  1.  Treatment of Iraqi Prisoners - "We were just following orders" defence.  Nazi Germany anyone? 2.  "President" Bush 3.  The Block - I just can't get into it 4.  The Resort disappearing after 5 episodes???!!! 5.  Credit card debt now exceeding $30,000 - I shit you not.  Did anyone see Eurovision?  I taped it but have heaps of other DVDs to get through so I will save it for a rainy weekend.  It is my birthday soon, so I will be having little drinks and nibbles at Ki bar on the 28th of May at around 5:30pm.  All welcome.  On Saturday I am going to see Missy Elliot and then off to the Northern Soul night to dance the rest of the night away.  Actual birthday is on Monday the 31st so I will be at work.  Joy.    Bootsy has started howling like a wolf in the mornings.   We don't know if it's the cold or because Elroy was staying and now that he's gone, he be missin' his dawg...yo!  Maybe he is just bloody annoying.  He farts a lot too these days.  Not much more to tell.  Wish I was a little more upbeat but I have been through a lot since October of last year healthwise so I'm gonna try and have more fun this year.  Travel has been put on hold until I can shift some of my debt, shouldn't take more than 2 years then I'm free as a bird!!!  Money isn't everything but is sure as hell helps.  We should all go to Mick's parent's pizza place soon, for a night out.  It is in Sunnybank and I think it has a good vibe and good food.  More blogging please, even if it's just from me.  Ooh, we have lots of rainbow lorikeets out on the feeding trays right now.....they look wicked as in good not evil and full of doom.

      Well, it's been a while!  I have now fully assimilated the wonderful new drugs they have put me on to keep my brain chemistry stable and it looks like it's working.  Have had the flu for the last few days but am back at work today for a few hours and for the rest of the week.  That Leah stuff all blew over - well, she drove by our house with her tough boyfriend - it's a no through road - then claimed to folks that she was showing the kids the house - despite no kids in car.  Hmmm.  Never mind, water under the bridge.  I did the worst thing yesterday - came down with a cold on Monday but luckily it was a public holiday.  Then I slept through most of Tuesday ie forgot to ring work and forgot that I was meeting Mint, El etc at the Pancake Manor for lunch!  I have never done this in my whole life - what a loser - I'm so sorry everyone - I just did not wake up and only got the message through Porse when he rang me.  Now I am too embarrassed to call anyone........but I will.  I can't say sorry enough.  KIll Bill Vol 2 was great.....can't go into it now because I am still feeling bad about yesterday and have to get on the bus now. Blog soon.

      Welcome back to Bris, Ant and Bez. Thank you to 9Suns et all for the fab food and challenge on SingStar on Saturday. We will miss you El and hope to see you soon.   I am back at work - woo-hoo!  The much needed bucks should start rolling in.  Is anyone still watching BB4?  We are, sort of.  I've got into the O.C. with Bru.  Porse has boycotted it.  We are calling ourselves the O.C gang = Overall Cool gang, which has proved to be somewhat divisive in the household but I'm sure that will last as long as the series does.  What else?  Can anyone recommend some rental car places?  It's for my aunt & uncle over in Wales.  They are coming over for Crim-bo-selecta.  Hee hee!  Shamon.

      Happy Birthday again Ant!  I hope we can do something this week before you jet off to Melbourne, you jetter you.  Actually, Porse and I will be doing a 1 night jet to Sydney to see Dizzee Rascal on the 23rd of July.  I am stone broke but I just had to do it because his album has had such an impact on me during the last 6 months (blah blah blah he's also a hot 20 year old).  We're not even going to be there 24 hours which is good because it means less time to spend money.  Justin Timberlake was surprisingly good, even though I was highly hormonal and was crying in the truck cos I didn't want to go, I'm glad I did.  His band were awesome, he sang like an angel, played guitar and keys and didn't dance until the very end which is a Very Good Thing.  The more dancing he did, the more our eardrums would have burst by the combined screaming of desperate 16 year olds.  There was star spotting to be done too....we saw Cameron Diaz by the speakers backstage.....Miranda (?)(see, I'm using star in the broadest sense of the word) from The Resort, the chick who was in charge of housekeeping that kept having run ins with Eva.  Oh, and Levi from Idol.  I didn't actually see any of these apart from Cameron because Porse was saying 'there they are' but not actually saying where.  Most annoying.    Now that terri has gone, can we please get rid of Bree?  I voted so many times but to no avail.  And Bez, Bru said the steaks at the Normanby are dead good, better than Ki!

      Happy bifdee Ant.  Sorry we are going to Justin Timberlake on Saturday (I am a bit pissed off with him cos he has come across as a wanker in interviews, wish I could sell me ticket) but we will catch up with you soon.  Dizzee Rascal is playing at Splendour in The Grass and the tickets are sold out ---- arse!!  Very pissed off.  My psychologist is making me do all these tasks every day to help get me back to work (go back on the 28th).  I have to be up at 8am, do yoga, perhaps some chores, go for a walk, a bit of treadmill etc etc.  So far, in general, I have got up at approx. 10am - 12pm and once loaded the dishwasher.  Ooh and I sorted some clothes out for the laundry.  This would be okay but I have to write it all down and I can't lie cos I feel bad.  Bugger.

      Hi Jerks.  Ta for the grand birthday celebrations at Jorge.  I really liked that place.  Great service and mad cocktails.  I loved that Samurai....can you make me one Beza?  BTW Beza and Ant, thank you for my massage, I already went and had it....actually, I had it on Monday the 31st, me actual birthday, so it was mad.  Then I met a mad bi-polar dude in the mall who drew pictures of me and I gave him 15 bucks.  He needed it. The I went to 2 Small Rooms with Porse for the intimate birthday dinner.  We had a 300gm sirloin each...it was fucking wikked, I tell thee!  Hmmm. What else?  I am off work again, my medication is all wonky and I have to go back to the shrink to take even more.  I think I might have to give up alcohol because it is not helping, plus the lithium is making me put on heaps of weight.....I am rapidly expanding like a balloon.  Thank god for Porse who doesn't care or at least says he doesn't extremely convincingly.  Can't wait until Miriam goes into the house.....I hope Ryan or Paul try to get it on with her.  I like Trevor but I still like Merlin a lot.....but I have heard some bad stuff about him.    I also got SingStar for PS2 for my birthday....it is a great group game.....Sonja and I battled Porse and Bru and they won.  Can I just say that I had a sore throat that night?  Anyway hope to have a boys vs girls rematch some time soon.  And Wiley ate all da pies.

      Porse and Jurquette Jet to Sydney to see Dizzee Rascal.  Friday 23rd of July  8am Zoe up and packing trying to decide whether or not to take suitcase just for one night. At least manage to narrow it down to two pairs of kicks. Ingest too much caffine via coffee and diet coke.  10am Porse awakens.  Takes Mersyndols.  This is an indication that he stayed up late the night before with Bru and Snax drinking beer and being a 24 hour hip hop b-boy or something.  10:30am  Boy In Da Corner goes on the CD player and much rump-shaking and yelling of east London slang ensues.  The excitement builds.  11am All packed and time to go - we hit the road.  12pm Arrive early at airport and score cool seats on plane.  Bonus! Gate no. is 40....very unlucky in HK.  1pm Take off!  2:25pm Landing!  3:15pm Check into hotel....great location but put on level 4 (yikes) in room 424!    4:00pm Find some Euros in room worth about 7 bucks.  Maybe not so unlucky after all apart from stench of chlorine filling room from pool just outside our door.  4:30pm Time for some room service.  I stick to Atkins diet ie a bit of cheese, Porse goes for the All Day Brekkie and a side of spicy wedges.  The wedges win.  5pm - 8pm Getting ready, showering, tarting up and checking out the Ryan eviction on Big Brother.  8:10pm Walk to venue expecting doors to be open as advertised.  8:30pm Meet lovely couple in line, Ross and Vanessa.  Time passes a little quicker.  Doors still not open.  9pm Doors finally open.  9:05pm Discover that Dizzee is not on until 12:30am.  Arse and bugger.  9:10pm Decide to have a few drinks.  Or more.   11:00pm Decide that I have seen Dizzee Rascal in the crowd.  Ask him his name and he says AJ.  Refuse to believe he is not him despite the fact he looks nothing like him.  11:10pm Get even more maggot.  What else was there to do??  I mean, 3 and a half fucking hours!!!  11:30pm Shit band comes on....still lucid but tired and bored of waiting for Dizzee.  Have some great chats with Vanessa inbetween assaulting the bar. Have fun dissing Blue Juice (the shit band) with new friends Ross and Vanessa.    12:30am -ish Dizzee comes on.  Spot we had staked out for hours gets bumrushed.  I venture into the "mosh" to get a better look.  Memory starting to flicker a bit by now and fatigue has set in.  12:45am Feeling overwhelmed by mosh, Porse takes me towards toilets to get a breather despite my initial resistance.  I spot some stairs and walk straight towards them to sit down and have a rest.....but I faint instead.  12:45:30sec Face plant into stairs, split chin open, blood everywhere.  Security call a taxi but I tell everyone I want to go home.  This does not work coming from a pissed, fainter on anti-depressant medication.  1am Arrive at RPA hospital.  1:05am - 3am  Fill in paperwork, get asked if I know where I am (fucking hospital, missing Dizzee!) and if I have taken any drugs (drugs are bad m'kay!!).  Porse tells them about my prescription stuff just to be safe.  Needed 3 stitches in chin.  Right knee bruised as fuck.  Given Tetnus injection for that extra pain factor.  3:15am  Back at hotel; need room service as possible cause for fainting - drinking on empty stomach with prescription meds.  10am Wake up feeling sorry for myself and sorry for Porse because we missed the show and sorry for workmate Ed because I was going to go to FCUK to get him a T-Shirt but was too buggered.  Not much else to tell.  Porse went to breakfast, we packed, got a taxi back to the hospital where Porse had dropped my watch from his backpack then onto the airport.  Uneventful flight back.  Disco nap for me and then being the hardcore motherfucking crazy party animal that I am generally not, we went to the Northern Soul 2nd Anniversary with Porse's mum and sisters plus Bru and Mon's friend.  Was a great night.  I drank, I danced and I did not faint once.  Currently wondering if this is anything to do with the fact that I stopped taking my lithium that very day? I am now convinced that it doesn't agree with me.   Stitches out tomorrow, woo hoo, but bruising is still pretty bad.  So much for checking out the cutting edge of the grime/eski scene.  More like the cutting edge of concrete stairs on my chin.  Still.  Mustn't grumble.  I definitely had a laugh before and after the 'incident'.  It just hurt more after.  Any news fellow jerks?

        Hello LTJs!!! Haven't blogged for ages. How are you guys doing? I just finished my contract job, now coming back to be unemployed!!! Ninesuns, Tiger and me haven't done anything much. We watched School of Rocks last night and it was    hilarious. My in-laws just came back from Swiss trip, they are staying at my place now. (it's good that Helen cooks dinner for us and also cleans up the house) and now we've got SingStar at home, we sing sometimes and can't wait for new additional songs. (Jurquette, your name is still on our chart!)  That's all happening at the moment. Wanna catchup with you guys some time, maybe we go to the park or something. What do you reckon?

A bit pissed on champagne tonight but have a few irons in the fire and looking forward to the future.  Soon.....DIZZEE RASCAL.....my all time fave at the mo.  Having to fly down to Sydney to see him but no big deal.  I am pissed so I must go.  Love to ALL!

      Just found out my lil bro Aaron may be coming down to stay for a month.  This will be totally cool.  A lackey to do the washing, cleaning and cooking.  Just what I've always wanted.  Plus he is a lot of fun and I must admit, I shed a tear or two the other night before I fell asleep because I missed the little scamp. I feel like I'm missing out on seeing him grow (he is now 6'3) and not just in height. I told my mum and it must have tugged at the heartstrings; she is looking into cheap flights right now!  I am so sick of BB4 because I am hooked and no-one likes the people I like and I hate all the people everyone else likes.  I feel like an outkast cos roses really smell like poo-ooh-ooh.  Any comments, issues, concerns or opinions about who is hot or not?  I had a great week at work....I don't want to jinx myself and I have to go back to doctors etc next week but oooow!  I feeeeeeel goooood!  In a James Brown at age 30 way not 68 or whatever he is now and crazy as a fiend.  No attention paid to grammar tonight because it's too late and I want to bash this out before I goes to bed.    Porse is calling me to bed and Bootsy is in his winter vest and ready to get curled up in bed so off I go.  I think we will be having a Christmas in July one weekend soon.....decorations, the roast and all the rest.  Let me know if you are interested.  This is Jurquette, hopped up on goofballs signing off. (Actually, I did the most Ashalea thing tonight - made a drink w/orange juice and cranberry, ice, the works.  Forgot the vodka.  And I was going "This tastes funny, maybe the juice is off??)  Audi!!!
