      In the first entry of this log, I would like to say that I love Carlo, who has shown me good things can happen to good people.  I tend to have bad things happen, things you could not imagine, things out of my immediate control and here perhaps in my log, you shall learn about some of these as well as all the good things that also happen at times.

      Ik verander van dag tot dag, uur naar uur en zelfs minuut minuut lang wanneer ik leer. Ik zou een Test Tocht me kunnen zijn, als de Veron wet zegt, "Poging is de hardste wet van alle omdat zij de test voor geeft en de les later"! Maar ik ga geen waar snel. :)

      If Nothing Else, you have someone to debate with!  Is there anything wrong with simply having someone there sometimes?  My path is both treacherous and lonely but I look for a way......

      Recently as I awoke this morning with a severe headache, I thought I was going to work but remembered that today was in fact Tuesday, my Regular Day Off.  I had a weird dream again, I was the Borg Queen and I experienced compassion, the alien ship I encountered began to pray and I would not allow them to be assimmilated into the collective.  (I think there was a hidden message perhaps) .  Its so hot that it prevents me from sleeping right away, though it always takes me such a long time to fall asleep anyway.  My headache was because my mother went to the store, I gave her money to get a few liters of Diet Coke and she brought back Caffine free Diet Coke in a 12pack.  Today I plan to go get it myself and never let my mom shop for me again LOL.  Well, I am off to get some Tylenol for my head, hope your not bored yet.

      Baby, I will do what it takes for you to be happy.  Ask me anything, tell me anything, for I will do anything.  I can't really express all of my feelings.  Am I not a keeper?  Who else but you would consider me as such?  I love you Carlo.

      I too know Sadness my love.  That is maybe one of the few things I do know even more than yourself.  I offer you an alternative that never expires, just like my love for you and my thoughts of you.

      Vos mots m'ont touché maintes et maintes fois. Je vous promets mes mots porteront la prudence de ce point hors., merci si beaucoup de pour tout que vous êtes et tout que vous faites. Nous sommes vraiment à un moment important dans notre relation où nous pouvons continuer sur le chemin parfois rocheux mais beau nous marchons ou choisissons la solution de facilité. Aimer ne peut pas être facile, mais il obtient seulement mieux après l'orage de sable. Je vous aime.

      Some people are good, but a little too good.  I'm here to be me and nothing more, nothing less.  I feel I am dead in a sea of life.  Some people just like being unhappy and hate seeing people happy, but I am not one of those.  Its not my fault, I do what I can!

      Life is a journey that completes only once.  Growing as a person is always and forever. My attempt, to clarify, is not to win you but rather simply to show you that love comes in many forms through many feelings, and in many ways.  I stand in the pale moonlight to think of a way....        I am sorry if I say one thing and imply another, but, I do love you more than you may ever know.  I have always had a problem communicating my feelings into the cold world of logic, but, are we both not teachers?  You are the most independent free thinking soul I know, I do not and could not impose, nor would I try, a way of thinking upon you.    We have good days, we have bad days, but all I can do is apologize for the bad, and bring you along for the good.  The only disease to be cured is my approach to things.  I cannot be the one to challenge the fact that nothing ever lasts, but I am rumored to be a loose cannon and do defy expectations rather or not you have even thought them up.    There is NOTHING I would now, or EVER change about you, I like you just the way you are and ever shall be.  I am thankful that you are open to expressing and sharing your feelings as I do the same.  My life has almost always been a closed book but I am opening it a little at a time, like a butterfly spreading its wings.

      Here is a story of two people, who sailed into each other's lives in a wondrous way!  There was once an Emotional Creator of things who had a heart of water, very soft and very much alone, no one understood him.  Then there was this other remarkable person, the Emotionless Destroyer with a heart of Fire as hard as Steel.  The god of faight said to the Creator, "Your loneliness is immense I will create another for you, but he shall be a destroyer".  The god of destiny saw that the god of faight had created a destroyer and created a creator.  The two set sail and met each other in a port of a beautiful place.  The Destroyer said onto the creator "I know everything but for emotion, I am alone, and afraid to love". The Destroyer understood things but could not see the world for why things are, but rather, how things are. The Creator replied "I know everything that you do not, I can see the world through rose colored glasses, allow me to join you, I can see the wind, and hear the drop of a feather.  I will show you love and emotion, and soften your hard cold heart for I know you want these things". The Destroyer Replied "I am afraid, I fear what I do not yet understand". The two set sail but the Creator knew not where to go for he knew not of the world, but understood it., the Destroyer knew the world and did not understand it. Whatever one lacked, the other made up for and for the first time the gods were fearful of the power of the two. The Destroyer began to cry and the Creator asked him why? The Destroyer replied, "I an crying for I am loving, for you have shown me how to feel". The Creator wiped the tears from the Destroyer and said "I love you you too,  my heart was soft but you tempered it for me and showed me logic and the world; it become harder until we now share the same heart".  The two became one and began to take over their own faight and destiny, and behold the gods were powerless to stop them!  The Destroyer and the Creator vowed that as they became one great force and they slew the gods! Now, the mortals could find their own destiny and faight as the two watched over the world and loved each other until all things end.  Their names were Justin and Carlo.

      Why is it that there is always a bias opion or perception of the world?  You look out the window and see leaves falling from a tree and yet the media would focus on the fact that the leaf fell from upon the tree, not the fact that it is slowly falling to the ground in a beautiful way!
