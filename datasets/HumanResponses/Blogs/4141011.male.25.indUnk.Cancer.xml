						   Yesterday I took a couple hours off early from work to go get the car fixed up.  I needed to get some new tired put on because my exisiting ones were worn.  When I called NTB to reserve some tires the salesman, the manager, asked me "Any particular brand?"  I replied with, "Perferably the best."   He then quickly recommended Michellen, but there was only 2 in stock for my size.  So I went with second best, the BF Goodwrench tires.  They still cost 440 dollars.  Anyways,  I went I got those put on Thursday afternoon.  While I was waiting in the waiting room, some other customer was getting upset because he had been waiting there for 3 hours.   I later decided to get my alignment corrected and then the fuel injectors, oil, and transmission.  Did I leave anything off?  Oh I then got the car washed.  But those tires are nice.  I stuck a penny into the thread and lost Lincoln's head.  I should be prepared for the winter weather with my traction tires.  So by the end of the day I had spent around 700 dollars.  Plus I got some baseball cards at Toys R Us.  I might be a sucker when I pay out for car maintenance, but when my car is happy...I am happy.  I have mistreated her some in the past when I have gotten lazy or when I try to stretch an oil change another to 3100  miles.  That reminds me I need to detail the inside this weekend, I promised her.

						   Well today I need to go get new tires put on my Civic.  I reserved some BFs from NTB and will go get them put on if I have time today.  I also want to stop by Jiffy Lube and get my fuel injectors cleaned and transmission flushed along with the oil change.  Time to get the car fixed up.   It is the morning now.  Today at work I want to work on the calculator compiler.  But I really am not 100% motivated at work nowdays.  I can't stand my office mate.   This guy talks on the phone all day about his son's little league games.  He sounds like such a "soccer mom."  He really don't have a real job besides paper pushing and I seriously doubt his keeness in that task.  Yesterday he was searching for boxes because he was moving.  He asked if I had seen any large monitor boxes.  I thought to myself a refigerator box would be bigger for you to live in.  This is the same guy when he moved into the office rearranged the office so that he consumed more space for his 1/4th of the office.   Anyways, I am off.

						   Well I typed something into this Blog thing and then somehow I hit the backspace.   Then my browser we back to the previous page.  So I tried to go forward and then post was gone!  I guess I can't make mistakes or else you lose everything.  These blog people still need some tuning up before this stuff becomes mainstream.

						   Well it's Monday again. Today I had cereal and OJ for breakfast. I decided to wear my button up shirt untucked today. I then came to work listening to news radio. I just finished eating a PB sandwhich and bannana with milk for my lunch. If the weather is good this afternoon/evening I will go for a jog.

						   I was out shopping on this Saturday.  When I was in Target I saw a mother and son next to the baseball card counter.  I could tell the son was wanting to get a pack of Topps or Upper Deck.  It reminded me a lot of me when I wa 13 years old standing next to the baseball cards at the shopping store.  So anyways, I had to get some cards.  I was first going to only get one pack, but thought why only 1.  I have the money to spend on a couple of $1 or $2 packs of childhood.  So I grabbed 9 packs of different brands of cards.  It felt kinda weird randomly getting something like this without care of money while these kids with a $5 bill stood there deciding on what few packs they wanted to get.  That was fun.  That was grown up.  It was spontaneous and I can't wait to open them.  I just want to savor the moment of opening a fresh pack of cards.  The suspense of who is inside.  What inserts are in there or what do these new generation 2004 baseball cards look like.  It will be fun.

						   Hey it's Thursday.  Tommorrow is paypay.  Today I skipped breakfast.  Arrived at work around 9 am.  I had chocolate milk and a cheeseburger for lunch.  Then around 5 pm I drove home.  It was pouring rain on the way back.   I had a chicken pot pie for dinner.  Then I played with my computer and watched the Braves game.  The Braves won.  Now it's time for bed.

						   Well I came home today from a long day at work and went for my usual jog.  I went 3 laps which comes out to be about 3 miles total.  Then I came back to my apartment and took a shower.  Today I skipped breakfast.  I had a peanut butter sandwhich and chocolate milk for lunch while sitting at my desk.  Then dinner was ramen noodles.  I spent the evening watching the History Channel.  Modern Marvels was about fortifications and then Liberty Ships.  Did you know they used to built ships in 4 days?  That Kaiser was quick.  Anywho, now it is Early Edition on PAX.  I must be like 50 years old.  Oh, damn, I am half way to 50.  I just realized that.

						   Well the finale of Joe Schmo just aired.  It was good.   Austin and Piper decided to renew their relationship and get married.  But before they were about to tie the know, Bryce came out and revealed the act.  Tim and Amanda took it really well.  It was like they just wanted to get drunk and forget about it all.  The entire series was hilarious and outrageous.  Can't wait for the DVD to come out.  Will there be a Joe Schmo 3 and will I be on it?

						   Well yesterday my presentation to my boss, boss' boss, and other important people up there went pretty well.  I practiced what I would say and got each slide down to the important stuff.  When I was presenting the audience stopped me to ask questions and make comments.  I think I could do it again if I had to.   I did get stressed out a bit by it.  My blood sugar shot up to 250 something.  When I came home I just collapsed with a nap for almost 2 hours.  Today is more ordinary.  I just finished eating my PB sandwhich for lunch and am about to continue doing the same old same old.   Tonight is the final episode of Joe Schmo 2. Should be good.

						   Today I got up and went to work. I arrived about 15 minutes after 9. I had another cheeseburger for lunch. I usually don't eat cheeseburgers but since I've been out of bread for my PB sandwhiches I have relied on imitation meat cheeseburgers from the deli downstairs in my office building. I had a Diet Dr Pepper to go along with it. I think I should cut down on my soda intake. The acid levels from the soda can't be good for my teeth and stomach. After lunch I continued working on my presentation.  I am giving a technical briefing next Monday to some higher ups in my division. It pretty much is a way to give me exposure. I don't like presenting material especially to my superiors. It can be intimidating even though I am the expert on the subject. The briefing is scheduled for 10 am and should last 30 minutes. My power point presentation consists of slides with pictures. I plan on speaking to my audience rather than reading slides to them (If only I can do that).  I left work with a headache. I came home and turned on the news and snoozed for about an hour before getting something to eat. I had ramen noddles and mini-ravioli. Now I am watching the Braves game.  Overall the day was tiring. I need to get more sleep, but I think I am getting enough. Maybe its my matress that keeps me tossing and turning at night. Maybe its something else.

						   Well this is the start of my blog.   I just have to try this blog thing out because it seems the biggest thing since gigapets.   Anywho, today I got up around 8 am, drove into work.  There was a branch meeting.  Then I had a cheeseburger for lunch.  Came home around 6 pm and picked up my package from the leasing office.  I had received notice from Fedex that my wireless PCI adapter was delivered.  I got the NIC hooked up and started discovering the wireless networks in my area.  Then I had a microwave dinner and watched Family Guy.  The day is almost over and I shall be heading off to bed.
