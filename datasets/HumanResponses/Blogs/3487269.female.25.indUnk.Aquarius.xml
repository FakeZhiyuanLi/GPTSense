      I am the person who value my friends so much.  But the problem is that I have trouble telling them how special they are to me.  Words do not come easy for me so I am writing this article in their honor.   MAMI BELS  - This is my nanay in law school.  It is because of her I realized that "Green" is the best.  Aside from that, I would never forget the truth about the birds and the bees.  Thanks Mami for being there.  You are someone I can truly run to and just be myself.     ATTY. IRENE  - Ahhh... my sweetie friend.  She made me feel special and made me smile most of the time... and because of her I realized my mood swings.  I am ever grateful to her family for making me feel welcomed in their home.  I thought true love for a friend is hard to find, but I found that in her.   ELAINE  - My former bestfriend and alcohol buddy.  She made me laugh, she made me cry... but be that as it may, she would always be a friend to me.  I started my dream with her to become a lawyer and now it is only at a hand's reach (i could smell it already!), I hope I could share that glorious moment with her.  She would have a special place in my heart because once upon a time not so long ago... she considered me as her bespren yain.  WaBSu!   SHARMILA  - It is because of her I realized how to be more compassionate about animals.  She is a true animal lover that is why she is special.  Aside from that, this friend of mine is truly sweet, witty, and very kind.  I would like to thank her for her advice when I was on the verge of insanity when I got a note from a ghost from the past.  I just hope that someday, we would see each other again and just have a blast!   TAHWIN  - Oh yeah!!!  A real gentleman... a charmer!  I am lucky to have him as my friend.  He is someone I really feel comfortable with and whom I trust.  Of all my male friends, he is the best.  I miss counting empty beer bottles with him.   JEWEL  - A blast from my highschool past.  I would never forget her never ending sermons.  She made my highschool life meaningful.  She was there to keep me in the right track and reminded me not to neglect my studies... and all those stuffs.  Uwe, wherever you are... thanks for the memories and palangga to gid kita!   AGNES, ELVIE, AND GEMMA  - My neighbors, barkada, and biker buddies in grade school.  From the old house to the countless wounds and bruises because of bike racing, overturning of the three-wheeler to the kick ball... geez, I can truly say that I had a happy and complete childhood.  Not to mention my hair full of lice!   BOBBIE AND GENSEXY  - My "mare" in law school.  I had really such a swell time with them.  From the kikay stuffs up to the serious stuff... all I can say is, they are the best buddies I have, not just in law school, but also in life.  To Bobbie, thanks for believing in me.   BSB3 FAMILY  - Sorry for mentioning you guys collectively because of the term family connotes... you guys are too many to mention.  Thank you for all the happy memories.  Truly I can say that I would not have such a wonderful college life without you guys.  Our bonding is more than friends... we treated each other as brothers and sisters for the same cause... ang manggulo sa school, lumaklak ng lumaklak, at mang-inis ng mga professor.  Remember almost all of us compressed ourselves like sardines in the elevator just to hide from our statistics prof? Anyway, I know I owe you guys a lot for not showing up on parties and other events.  Basta, just hang in there a little because not too soon the PARTY ANIMAL SHALL RETURN with more barf to come!!!

      I love animals, especially cats.  In fact I have ten, to wit: Simba, Owy, Bal, Kissy, Illyo, Helmie, Prince, Abubie, Sharon, Sayti, and Poy.  I just hope that someday, I would be able to build a "Home" for stray cats wherein they will not be put to sleep...
