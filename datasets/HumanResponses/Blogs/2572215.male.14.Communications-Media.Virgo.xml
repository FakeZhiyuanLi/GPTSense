       urlLink     Did You heard About The G-mail .....  Ok It Provides 1Gb  (1000Mb)  Of Disk Space It Has A Real-Time Update Speed Of Your Mails ..... High end Servers & All Provided By Google's G-mail ......  In this Case ......  The Yahoo! Mail Has Increased It's Mailbox Storage To 100Mb then ..... But If You Look @ The Upgraded Plans You'll Find Out That Yahoo! Provides 2Gb Of Space  (Twice As much as Google's Free Mail)  For Only 2$/Month & It's Really Good ... But I Hope That The Google'sBeta Mail Could Upgrade To Alpha & Full Version Cuz It Has A Great Loading Speed ...... I think That The Challenge That Google Has Just Started Gonna Increase The reliability Of Internet In A challenge ..... Cuz The Hotmail Services Are Extremely Growing ...... For More Details About Next Generation Of Hotmail Click  urlLink  Here      In Other Words I Can Say That The Internet Is Just Getting Better In A challenge  These Are ScreenShots Of Both Services ......

       Ok, Let me Start Talking About Search Engines .....  Ok The Most Usefull Thing In Internet Is Searching .... I Do NOT mean Searching For A Specific Site Or Any Computer Or IT Related Thing ......  I mean  Everything  ..... Ok You Know Internet Grows Fast maybe Faster & Faster And We Can't Keep Track Of Every Site Or Figure Out That witch Internet Service Is better Or ....   But We Can Search For Them .....    & For Searching You Need A  Search Engine  .... Search Engine Is Usually Is A Web Service That Connects To A  Database  & It Will Send Some  Keywords  To the Database Server & As A Response The Database Returns Some  Queries  That You'll See the As The Resut of Search ....... Ok Now You Know The Basic Of Search Engines & How Do They Work .......  As I Said "Internet is growing Fast & You Cannot Keep Track Of All sites & ...." Ok?   You Know The Number Of Search Engines In the World Is Counting Up Almost Every Secend Now The Problem Is Two ...  But Don't Worry I'm Sure That You Can manage Because There Are Some Parameters   That Can Tell You Witch Search Engine Is Better .... The Frist Is  Speed Of Search Engine  Then By These Parameters I Recommand  urlLink Goolgle.com  Or  urlLink Msn.com's Search Engine  That Is Related To Microsoft® The World Most Huge Software Development Company & The Google® Search engine Is One Of the Greatest Search Engines Of the World .....   The Secend Parameter Is  Number Of Queries  & In this Case You Have to know that All the Search engines Have A lot Of Queries & A Huge Database I Recommand Google & Microsoft In this Case ..... The Thrid & The Most Effective Parameter Is Supporting Meta Search ... Meta Search Is A Technology That Submits Keywords to the Database But It Would Search Trought The Meta HTML Tags In The Source Code Of The site & Returns A Result I think All of the Search engines now Support Meta Search . It Helps You To Find What exactly You Want ..... The Other Parameter Is  Croprative Search  That Can Help You Saving Your Time .... In this Case The Search Engine Submits The Keywords To  Several  Or Even More  Databases  Of  Diffrent Search Engines  & It Returns A better & Complete Results ... Q: But You May Say That "Does This Type Of Searching Returns  Dublications  ?"  A: I'll Answer No The Dublications Will Be Removed & The Queries That They Are Almost The Same Will Be Stored In A group & Will Save Your Time .... In this Case I recommand The Mamma® Search Engine That Includes A Extreme Large Database   (Because It Uses Other Ones Too)  There Are Even More Parameters Like Supporting Several Languages Or .....   But they Are In A Lower Priorty .....  @ Last I Wanted To Tell You If You Want To Subscribe To My Blog News Letter Or You Have Even More Questions You Can Post A Comment By Simply Clicking The Comments Link Below Or  urlLink Mailing Me  With Regards Farzad E.

        Well Do U Have A Problem Buying Graphic Cards Well I Can Help ...  As U Know There Are Several Parameters ....  The 1st One Is The Manifacture Of The Chipset On The Card ....  Well Personally I Prefer The ATI Chipsets Cuz They Have Reasonble Prices & They Work Even Better Than NVIDIA Or Others ... Personally I've Tested The Sparkle Series With A Rendering & The ATI Radeon 9000 Series With The Same One & I Saw A Dump In The Sparkle Series That It Can NOT Render The Text Based Textures Good & It Would Return An Unwanted Result ..... & I've Experianced The Nvidia Graphics: TNT2 & Sparkle & .... ATI Radeon: 7000 & 9000 & 9800xt And Even MSI Graphic Cards....  As A Result In Gaming Experiance I Say That The Radeon 7000  (64mb)  Was Working Better Than A 128Mb Sparkel Graphic Card .....    Then I Recommand The X800 Graphic Card From ATI Or Radeon 9800Xt 256MB DDR From The ATI Crop.  Actually If You Don't Want 2 Spend A Lot Of Money On Ur Graphic Card Then I Recommand The Radeon 9000 Pro DDR It Has The Best Performance In Home & Office Designed Graphic Cards .....   There Are Some Other Parameters That I've Included In The Selection Above  Like Thermal Control & The Noise Or Memorey Management & Support & ..... Well The Other Parameter That U Have To Include It Personally Is The Accessories & TV Tuners , Capture Devices & .... That Are Included on The Graphic Card Board .....  Well As A Home User , Entertainment User , Power User , Gamer , Or Professional User ..... U Have To Choose The Graphic Card Model That Meets Ur Need ....

But The'll Look For Meta Tags Placed In Your Site ......    You Can Specify The Meta Tags In The Starting Line Of Your HTML By Setting The HTTPequiv To KeyWord & Then Inserting The Keyword In Content .......   After This When A Search Engine Will Return Queries It Would Look If The Site Has Meta Tags .....  If The Site Includes Meta Tags Containig That Keyword Then The Search Engine Will Place It On Higher Place Than The Ones Don't Have Meta Tags ...... If You Found This Usefull Please Click On Comments & Submit Your Comments After That If I See This Is Intresting For Visitors I'll Place A Post Including The Syntax Of Meta Tags & A lot More .....

And it ain't that i'm wiser...      it's only that i've spend more time with my back to the wall.      And i've picked up a couple more years on you,baby...that's all.     i've walked a couple more roads than you,baby...that's all.    And i'm tired of running'while you're only learning to crawl.    And you're heading somewhere...    But i've been to somewhere...and found it was nowhere at all.     And i've picked up a couple of years on you baby...that's all.     Now saying goodbye,girl don't never come easy at all.    But you've got to fly cuz you're hearingthose young eagle call.    And someday when you're older,you'll smile at a man strong and all.    And you'll say i've got a couple more years on you,baby ...that's all.     i've got a couple more years on you baby...that's all.      you'll say i've had more chances to fly and more places to fall.      it's ain't that i'm wiser.      it's only that i've spend more time with my back to the wall.

        I Hope That U Specially my Friend Sanaz used this Article ....  Ok Let's Start this Lesson with the Question that how does A URL Wil be retrived .... Ok you know that computers in the internet have their own Unique ID  (exept Invalid Ones)   It's Called IP ....  A Ip Adress Formula Is X.X.X.X | 0  You have to know that The IP adress of the web server is required to obtain the contents & retrive a URL ..... But you almost never type an IP adress of a WebServer To obtain the Webpage .....  But you may ask that how the domain names (the names in type of x*.x*)  will be converted to an IP ?  Have you read the Last Article Of mine Posted On this Blog? Ok , All we need to convert the Domain names To IP's Is Connecting To a DNS  (Domain Name Server)  ..... S DNS Is Technically A Search Engine That The Input Keywords Are The Domain Names & The Results Are IP Adresses ... But you may ask Is there A DNS Server In the world ... But It is exactly the point that The DNS Use Croprative Search Globally ..... That's why you can access your website from almost anywhere with a  Unique  Url .... With Regards  Please Send me your Questions ...... Farzad E.

        Ok, Let me Start Talking About Search Engines .....  Ok The Most Usefull Thing In Internet Is Searching .... I Do NOT mean Searching For A Specific Site Or Any Computer Or IT Related Thing ......  I mean  Everything  ..... Ok You Know Internet Grows Fast maybe Faster & Faster And We Can't Keep Track Of Every Site Or Figure Out That witch Internet Service Is better Or ....   But We Can Search For Them .....    & For Searching You Need A  Search Engine  .... Search Engine Is Usually Is A Web Service That Connects To A  Database  & It Will Send Some  Keywords  To the Database Server & As A Response The Database Returns Some  Queries  That You'll See the As The Resut of Search ....... Ok Now You Know The Basic Of Search Engines & How Do They Work .......  As I Said "Internet is growing Fast & You Cannot Keep Track Of All sites & ...." Ok?   You Know The Number Of Search Engines In the World Is Counting Up Almost Every Secend Now The Problem Is Two ...  But Don't Worry I'm Sure That You Can manage Because There Are Some Parameters   That Can Tell You Witch Search Engine Is Better .... The Frist Is  Speed Of Search Engine  Then By These Parameters I Recommand  urlLink Goolgle.com  Or  urlLink Msn.com's Search Engine  That Is Related To Microsoft® The World Most Huge Software Development Company & The Google® Search engine Is One Of the Greatest Search Engines Of the World .....   The Secend Parameter Is  Number Of Queries  & In this Case You Have to know that All the Search engines Have A lot Of Queries & A Huge Database I Recommand Google & Microsoft In this Case ..... The Thrid & The Most Effective Parameter Is Supporting Meta Search ... Meta Search Is A Technology That Submits Keywords to the Database But It Would Search Trought The Meta HTML Tags In The Source Code Of The site & Returns A Result I think All of the Search engines now Support Meta Search . It Helps You To Find What exactly You Want ..... The Other Parameter Is  Croprative Search  That Can Help You Saving Your Time .... In this Case The Search Engine Submits The Keywords To  Several  Or Even More  Databases  Of  Diffrent Search Engines  & It Returns A better & Complete Results ... Q: But You May Say That "Does This Type Of Searching Returns  Dublications  ?"  A: I'll Answer No The Dublications Will Be Removed & The Queries That They Are Almost The Same Will Be Stored In A group & Will Save Your Time .... In this Case I recommand The Mamma® Search Engine That Includes A Extreme Large Database   (Because It Uses Other Ones Too)  There Are Even More Parameters Like Supporting Several Languages Or .....   But they Are In A Lower Priorty .....  @ Last I Wanted To Tell You If You Want To Subscribe To My Blog News Letter Or You Have Even More Questions You Can Post A Comment By Simply Clicking The Comments Link Below Or  urlLink Mailing Me  With Regards Farzad E.

But Its Been 2 yrs. That They've Decided 2 Do This But It Didn't happened Till Now But They're Fighting Each Other 4 Money .... Well I Love Money But If I Had A Family I Loved That Too , Then I would Keep Both Of Them .... Then I Dunno Y My Father &amp; Mother Don't Understand This .... Well Forget About This Thing Now & Let Me Continue ... I Found My Only Chance , The Computers ... Actually I Started Working With Computers Since I Was Almost 10 ... But Now After Almost 5 Years It Became My Only Chance , But I Dunno If I'm Right But I think I Made A mistake ....   (Maybe A Great One ...)   Something Is Really Funny For Me , &amp; That's The neighborhood I Lived In Since I Was 7 ... In That neighborhood I Am & I Was The Only Guy &amp; There Were Girls All Around Me   (If You Look @ My Birthday Pics. U;ll Find Out That I Was The Only Guy Around & All My Friends Were Girls)   But Within A Wile My Brother Became 5 yrs old ...   ( He's Just 3 Years Younger Than Me &amp; He is My Only brother , I Have No Sister @ All)   That Time I Was Almost 8 & I've Just Started Spending My Time With My Brother ....  &amp; After A Year I Could Not Even communicate With My Brother .... Funny ? Yes , But I Became A Computer Expert In A Few Years ....  (Maybe A Computer Slave ?!!)   But I Don't Want To Talk About That Thing .... I Had A Serious Problem , And After A While My Mom Talked With A physiologist .... In The physiologist's Office I Found Out That I'm really Sick   (I Don't Mean physically , Mentally )   After That I Used Several types Of medications Till Now .... anyways I'm Using Them Right Now But My Doctor Said That I Can subtract Them But I Still Have Problems ....  In This Case I Found A Way To Comminucate To People , I Know It's Really Really A Foolish Way To Do This But .... Now I Can Comminucate With People By Giving Stuff To Them  (Most Of The Time Online)  & By This Way I Can Speak A Few Words To Others .... Although It Makes Me Feel Better , Really Better .... &amp; I Only Sent This Cuz I Am Really Depressed Now Cuz Someone Called Me Robin Hood .... Well I Sent This S  specially To That Person .... In Other Word i Can Say That I Was Just Locked Up There In My World .... If There Are Problems In This , Excuse Me Cuz I'm Not Feeling Well Now ....   Nothing More For Now .....    By Farzad ....
