      Holy cow!&nbsp; What a cool site.&nbsp; Just like that and I'm blogging.&nbsp; I wish I had known about this site while I was in the Peace Corps in Honduras.&nbsp; Oh well, I guess the two sites I was involved with while in Hondo-land were more than I could chew anyway.&nbsp;   Hmmm...let's try a link to those sites, shall we?&nbsp;  urlLink Malaria.arizona.edu  was set up stateside with Matt Wyckoff's generous help, and our  urlLink Sierra de Agalta  site was put together between myself and my wife and two other awesome volunteers, Dan and Krista Kapps.   Look, I'm rambling already!&nbsp; That's enough for a test posting.&nbsp; Stay tuned for more interesting schtuff...

      Read the  urlLink AP Wire  yourself. That guy never ceases to amaze me. Literally 75 days before the election and he plops his lazy, dumb ass down for a week to soak in the Olympics. Apparently he's going to be "working on" his Convention speech. Puh-LEASE. (Actually, maybe it would take him that long if he was the one writing it.)  You'd think the guy wasn't worried about the outcome in November, even though this is shaping up to be the most hotly contested election in US history.  Hmmmmm.....can you say, "October Surprise."  I swear, I'll gladly eat my shoe on November 3rd if the next two and a half months go by without any of the following:  Bin Laden capture Home Soil Terrorist Attack Cheney "forced" to resign due to "heart problems" Israel attacking Iran Any state's vote tally involving electronic ballots with no paper trail hotly contested

      If you don't already know,  urlLink Pax Christi  is a Catholic organization dedicated to primacy of conscience, economic and social justice, and respect for creation.  It strives to create a world that reflects the Peace of Christ by exploring, articulating, and witnessing to the call of Christian nonviolence.   They have just come out with a major Statement offering advise to Christians who are trying to figure out how to vote responsibly this November.  It will shortly be published in all major Catholic publications and beyond.  I hope this wise, succinct declaration really gets around.  Check out the whole letter below.  It's short, please read it all the way through:   Pax Christi USA Election Sign-On Statement  (To sign onto this statement, go to www.paxchristiusa.org, print out the statement, and follow the instructions on the response form. You can also endorse this statement online.)  "A Catholic moral framework does not easily fit the ideologies of 'right' or 'left,' nor the platforms of any party … Our responsibility is to measure all candidates, policies, parties, and platforms by how they protect or undermine the life, dignity, and rights of the human person, whether they protect the poor and vulnerable and advance the common good." – From "Faithful Citizenship," issued by the United States Catholic Bishops.  It is a common misperception of politicians seeking office that the Catholic vote can be courted by addressing a narrow range of issues. In reality, the great majority of Catholics in the U.S., in agreement with the U.S. Catholic Bishops, will vote for candidates based "on the full range of issues, as well as on (the candidate's) personal integrity, philosophy and performance" ("Faithful Citizenship," U.S. Catholic Bishops, 2004). Members of the media – and indeed a few of our own religious leaders – do a great disservice to our church and nation when they attempt to use one or another issue as the benchmark for Catholic identity. To characterize a whole content of our faith in a single issue is inappropriate and unjust."The Christian faith is an integral unity, and thus it is incoherent to isolate some particular element to the detriment of the whole of Catholic doctrine. A political commitment to a single isolated aspect of the Church's social doctrine does not exhaust one's responsibility toward the common good" ("Doctrinal Note on Some Questions Regarding the Participation of Catholics in Political Life," Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, November 24, 2002 and approved by the Holy Father, Pope John Paul II).The Catholic Church teaches that all life is sacred. A candidate for office must understand that the Church stands against any policy or course of action which diminishes life, dignity or the rights of the human person: abortion, capital punishment, war, scandalous poverty, denial of healthcare, mistreatment of immigrants and racism, to name but a few. All are essential issues to a "pro-life" voter. For over 30 years, Pax Christi USA has raised the immorality and injustice of modern warfare as a serious affront to our Church's proclamation of the sanctity of life. Over the past two years we have seen more than 900 U.S. military and over 15,000 innocent Iraqi civilians killed in what Pope John Paul II repeatedly stated was an unjust and unnecessary war. Contrary to words used in political speeches, a commitment to the sanctity of life must be judged by the actions taken to defend and promote life in all its forms. War is a defeat for the culture of life and political leaders that bring about or perpetuate war sin against God and humanity and cannot be considered in any sense of the word "pro-life."There are 60 million Catholics in the U.S. We take the responsibility of voting seriously. Each of us will evaluate candidates based on what our conscience – formed by reading the signs of the times in light of the example of Jesus in the Scriptures and the teachings of our Church throughout the ages – demands. We will examine the broad range of issues, measuring "all candidates, policies, parties, and platforms by how they protect or undermine the life, dignity, and rights of the human person, whether they protect the poor and vulnerable and advance the common good" ("Faithful Citizenship," U.S. Catholic Bishops, 2004).In the gospels, Jesus implores us to love our enemies, to feed the hungry, to bless the peacemakers, to set the oppressed free, and to care for the widow, the orphan, and the stranger. This November, we will look for and vote for candidates who take as seriously as we do the teachings and example of Jesus Christ.

      John and Teresa came through Medford on Thursday, creating quite a hullaballo.  There were about 7 thousand people in attendance at the rally, which was exciting to experience.  Working on a local campaign, I and my candidate were privilaged enough to sit up on the bleachers behind the dais for the event, smiling white-toothed at all the cameras.  Being up there was obviously a rush, but it had some practical disadvantages:  namely, we were utterly blinded by the press lights, and slowly cooked to a rotissarie gold.  No matter.  To be so close to someone that you've only ever seen on TV and paper is always cool, at least as long as you respect the guy in question.  It brings everything into focus a little, makes things real.  Afterwards, John was swarmed by the masses as he darted into the crowd, while the Secret Service required us bleacher-folk to stay put.  (I'm sure there's logic in that somewhere.)  I did get to chat with Teresa for a few minutes; I talked to her about the Peace Corps, and mentioned my wife, who had spoken with Teresa on the same subject several days earlier in Flagstaff.  Teresa remembered my wife, as their conversation took place on a quiet morning outside their hotel as she was preparing to be a part of the motorcade that took the Kerrys to the airport.  That was neat to see; she probably met 30,000 people between seeing my wife and me, but then again, my wife has always been the type to stick in your mind.  Here's the question I'd like to pose:  Only several days earlier, Cheney was in town (Jackson county is hot territory for each campaign; we've been told to expect a major Kerry serrogate (i.e. Dean, Clark, Clinton, Gore, Edwards...) every three days in Jackson County starting next month) and he put on a GOP campaign rally (NOT a fundraiser) in which only 3,000 INVITED, highly VETTED participates were allowed to attend.  This was a big discussion topic in the media around here, and it's no secret that this is how the Bush people have always run the campaign.  They require one to SWEAR FEALTY to Bush by signing a contract before one can get in the gates of a Bush Speech.  How is this good strategy for Bush, to take pains only to speak in front of the already converted?  How does he plan to affect independants and swing voters when they can't get near enough to him to hear his take on the issues?  History shows us that Undecided Voters end up voting TWO TO ONE for the CHALLENGER.  If they can continue to see Kerry in person and shake his hand at appearances of an average size of 7-8 thousand people, and can't even get in the door in small numbers to see the bobbing head of the most secretive president in history, whose team do you think those coveted voters are going to go to bat for?  I know for a solid fact that Kerry's event was all-inclusive.  I was involved in the setup and the run-through the night before and the question about what to do with "Bush people" did come up.  The answer straight from the Kerry high-up?:  "Let 'em in.  We want everyone to hear what Kerry has to say."  Folks, that's in direct contrast to the way the Cheney and the Bush visits went here.  I know for a fact that you couldn't get in to those visits unless you signed an oath and were a registered Republican.  Fact.  Either Bush is hopeless, or the American people are.  If the guy can only sing to the choir and smile for cameras, he deserves what he gets when he loses (again), or we deserve what we get if he wins.

      This  urlLink Nation article  on the possibilities of fraud in the Nov. election is startling.  TRUTH-LOVING PEOPLE: READ IT!  I know very well why the people in power at the highest levels want electronic voting to go forward as planned in the up-coming election: it offers them the opportunity to really, truly toy with the vote.  What I don't understand at all is why the rest of the nation isn't screaming mad and running around the streets stark naked with sandwich-boards declaring that the end of the world is upon us.  We're looking down the barrel of our country's greatest civil unrest since the Civil War if this election is heavily contested and there is no paper trail to help figure things out.  Mark my words.  News flash, folks:  This country is not ready for electronic balloting, and electronic balloting is not in the best interests of ANY OF US common folks.  Why the hell would any of us sit idly by and let anyone meticulously set up, in plain view, a way to trump your voting power?  Do Republicans think that it's okay to let an election be tinkered with just because their side is likely to benefit?  How can that possibly serve even a Republican in the long run?  How is this ludicrous notion even Conservative in value?  Since when did "conservatives" suddenly begin to lend unwavering trust toward completely untested technology?  (Oh, wait, I'm wrong:  This computer technology has been tested, and has failed enough times so miserably that the maxim of "erroring on the side of caution" i.e. scrapping the project for good, is a total no-brainer.)   urlLink READ THE ARTICLE   I am growing more and more confident that the ideolouges of the Right believe their causes are so important that they will go to ANY LENGTHS to assure themselves continued power.  In their minds, the ends justify the means.  This is so dangerous and I'm so overwhelmed by the notion that I have no idea where to start in repudiating it.  Like Lincoln said, and as John Kerry recently reiterated:  (I'm paraphrasing and embellishing here) There are those in this country who wallow in the self-righteous assuredness that God is on  our  side.  Well, I can only drop to my knees and humbly pray in all of this that we are on His side!  At the very least, people, demand that these machines leave a paper trail!  For God's sake!  Try to think of a public, touchscreen machine that you've ever used that didn't have some sort of printout capability!  It's not like the technology to spit out a piece of paper doesn't exist!  Oh, wait, I just thought of one:  Gambling slot machines.  There you go.

      In case anyone's looking at this site other than my own two myopic eyeballs, here's a MUST HAVE in your 'favorites' folder for even the most passive, quasi-politcos:   urlLink Electoral Vote Counter   This site is updated, and changes,  every single day  based off of the latest polling data and I'm constantly looking at it.  It's great for getting an idea of trends.  The commentary is decidedly Pro-Kerry, but I'm totally confident that the data is objective and truly reflective of how things are looking.  Otherwise, I wouldn't bother with it (I've never been in the business of filtering my knowledge of the world based only from information that I want to hear.)  Enjoy

       urlLink    Fun, fun. The local Channel 5 NBC affliate here in Medford interviewed me today for about 10 minutes and then I appeared on the broadcast both at 6 and 11. The interview went fine and I wasn't even nervous.I'm not exactly CNN analyst material, but I held my own, I think. They wanted to get me on the news to talk about the debate that was hastily set up between my candidate,  urlLink John McColgan , and his incumbent challenger, Representative Greg Walden.Of course, out of the 10 minutes of talking I did, they chose to air one of the more bellicose comments I made about the whole deal: "I do find it interesting that the Walden camp chose to wait until this morning to agree to a debate tomorrow, in Baker City, but John is still nonetheless excited for the opportunity to be able to present a clear choice to voters in the fall..." There was another comment they aired, me saying how wonderful it would be to have a televised debate in Medford itself, and that was pretty much the gist of the whole shabang.Woohoo! Austin being interviewed by Ch5 news.

      Holy mother of pearl! A fellow Peace Corps Volunteer friend of mine who is still down in Honduras was just shot right outside of the PC Headquarters in the capitol city of Tegucigalpa late at night! His own Incident Report of the event appears below.  I have to say, I was sweaty with a sick feeling in my stomach the first time I read this. I couldn't possibly count on all my digits the number of times I've been on the same street corner at that same time of night or later in that city! Peace Corps down there was already a bit facist with rules and motherly scoldings regarding keeping us all on a short leash in the capitol with all their CYA policies. They're gonna clamp down on security now like it was 1984. In that regard, I'm glad the whole PC thing is behind me...  This definately takes the cake over my own infamous run-in with El Peligro in Honduras: the time I suddenly found myself in a knife fight (my assailant had the knife--I, alas, was armed only with a pair of binoculars and eventually a rock) on the Carribbean city of La Ceiba. But that's a story for another posting down the line.  Enjoy this riveting tale and tremble:  INCIDENT REPORT peace corps - honduras  Written: 8:00am, Tuesday, August 3rd, 2004  Last night, Monday, August 2nd, 2004, I ( Patrick J. Wilson, Honduras Water & Sanitation Peace Corps Volunteer May 2003-May 2005) went to the French film festival in the CINEMARK theatre at the large “Mall Multiplaza” in Tegucigalpa. I went with Marc Hanson, an ex Peace Corps volunteer from my training group who is currently working for the NGO called “CHF”. At the theatre we met up with Gabian Heller, a friend and fellow “Honduras One” volunteer. Marc and I arrived at the theatre at approximately 7:10PM.  At approximately 9:30pm, after the movie, Gabe, Marc, and I went to the Hotel San Martin to socialize over a couple of beers. Marc left the Hotel San Martin to go back to his hotel at around 10:30pm, and Gabe and I stayed until about 11:30pm. We drank 4 or 5 beers apiece in total.  Upon leaving the front doors of the San Martin at around 11:45pm, Gabe and I saw that the streets were deserted; not a taxi in sight. Gabe and I stood there for a moment, and then instinctively turned to the left and walked ½-block to the corner, where our chances for catching a taxi were much better. When we got to that corner we encountered a prostitute, but still no taxis, so we decided to keep walking down the block in the direction of the Peace Corps office.  As we approached this next corner, a small group of men appeared quickly, running towards us from the left. What happened during the next 30 seconds or so happened very quickly. First I heard some kind of explosion from the left, past, but close to, Gabe (we were walking side by side, and he was on my left). I must have jumped away from this sound, because suddenly there was about 8 to 10 feet of separation between Gabe and I, and a young male Honduran-looking person, who was short with short black hair and appeared to be between 14 and 18 years of age, ran up to me and I heard a second explosion, and I saw that this person was very, very shakily, nervously aiming a gun at me. He was at a distance of about 6 feet in front of me.  He wasn’t saying anything, but he was waving his gun in such a nervous fashion that I was afraid he was going to fire another shot. His gun had a very long (maybe 12”) barrel, with an unusually wide barrel, maybe 1” in diameter. This was a very confusing moment. I took a quick inventory of the situation and noted that:  There appeared to be 4 men involved; one waving a gun at Gabe, one waving a gun at me, and 2 additional men with no gun showing. Something had happened to my right foot; on the inside part, right behind the ball joint for my big toe, I felt a slight stinging sensation The boy nervously pointing the gun at me seemed nervous enough to fire another shot.  My immediate priority was to calm this kid down enough so he didn’t shoot again. So I put both hands in the air and repeated over and over “Esta bien! Esta bien! Esta bien!” Meanwhile I weighed my options as to what to do: fight, flight, or give them whatever they wanted.  My first guess at what was happening was that we were being assaulted with paintball guns, based on how my foot was feeling and the appearance of the gun pointed at me. If this were the case, I thought to myself, all 3 of my contemplated options seemed a bit silly. In the end of this eternal moment, I decided, “The guns could be real, let’s give them whatever they want.” At this point a man (I believe one of the 2 who appeared to be without a gun) approached me and started to remove my backpack. I let him, and he also reached in 2 of my pockets (back right and front left) and removed my Banco Atlantida bank card, my California drivers’ license, and my Honduran ID card.  At this point all of the men fled. Within seconds, the prostitute on the other corner, another girl, and a man driving a taxi appeared and were very concerned for us and helpful. Gabe and I weighed our options and decided getting off the street was top priority, so we accepted their ride back to our hotel, the “Guadalupe 2”, which was maybe 6 blocks away down a hill. During the ride, one of the people said they recognized the attackers, so I wrote my cell phone number on a piece of paper, gave it to them, and they said they’d call later with more information.  I banged on the door of the hotel, the attendant opened the door, and in that moment I called the Duty Officer on my Peace Corps E-Zone cell phone (which happened to be in a pocket the man didn’t check), reported the incident to the duty officer, who was Jenny Chavez. She started the phone calls to inform the other interested parties in Peace Corps, and advised that we go to the nearest hospital immediately, which was called “Viera”.  Gabian and I went by taxi to the Hospital Viera (I paid 40 Lempiras for the ride), a doctor began attending to Gabe’s wound, which was more serious than mine, and I then received a phone call from Cisco, the PC-Honduras Country Director, who said he was on the way, and I began making phone calls to Banco Atlantida to cancel Gabe and my’s checking debit cards.  My first call to Banco Atlantida (232-1050) was at 12:34am, now Tuesday morning, August 3rd. I gave them our names and requested that they cancel our debit cards immediately. At 12:38am I called back, both times speaking with a person named “Angel Romero”. At 12:38am Angel Romero told me that he’d found and canceled Gabian’s card, but that he was still looking for my account number. By the end of this call, at 12:53am, Angel Romero informed me that he had found and cancelled the cards of “GABIAN D. HELLER” and “PATRICK WILSON”, but that I would have to call back at 8:30am to cancel my stolen checks.  At around 1:15am, Cisco and Carlos Banegas arrived and determined that it would be wiser to relocate us to a hospital called “HONDURAS MEDICAL CENTER”, so they transported us both to the Honduras Medical Center in their car, where we both received treatment for our wounds. My wound was treated with 3 stitches, a tetanus shot, and antibiotics via I.V., and Gabian’s wound was treated by a surgical procedure removing the bullet lodged in his foot at around 7:00am Aug 3rd. At the time of this writing, I am still in the Hospital Honduras Medical Center, with Gavian and Cleo, and I have just been discharged, and Gabian is to stay for 48 to 72 hours for observation and treatment.  ***end of statement***

      I was putting off doing this 'blog' thing until I had the time to 'do it right.' I wanted all my entries to follow some sort of chronology, or theme, but that's just not going to happen. If I really wanted to back track and get all my thoughts and feelings and ruminations from the past up to this point, I realized that I'd never actually catch up to the present. So I'm not going to bother. Maybe occationally I'll reminisce. Whatever. On with the madness...  Here's some madness for ya:  This website's spell checker doesn't recognize the word 'blog.'
