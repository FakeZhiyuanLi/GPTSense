       Saturday morning, bright and early, I met my training group at the Education Gym for a 30 minute info session regarding 'mentally training for a marathon'. Some people believe that a marathon only requires physical endurance, but in reality there is actually more mental than physcial training required. Half the challenge if getting to 'start line' because although a full marathon will take ~4hours to run, it takes several months of training to get there.  One thing I found very interesting, was setting more than one goal. Our trainer Kim made a it clear that only setting one goal is really preparing yourself for disappointment, because if for some reason you are not able to reach that goal, you will feel like you have failed. But in reality you have accomplished many things. Kim recommended that everyone set at least 3 goals:  First, is the best case scenario. If on that day everything falls into place and you run the best race of your life.  Second, is your realistic goal. You may not run the best race of your life, but still finish in a time reasonable time.  Third, is your liveable goal. What do you have to do to that even though things may go wrong, you can still look back and still be proud of yourself. This may be simplify finishing the race.  So once again, Kim gave an entertaining and informative info session.  After our info session, we ran a 12km out-and-back from Ed Gym north along Spadina. Although, early rains make things a bit wet, the day turned out to be very nice, as we enjoyed the great view of the Saskatchewan River.

Lets just say that the first couple batches were let than perfect, but they are looking better and better with each batch we make.      Special thanks to Milton Jurado, Tyson Falconer, Ed Gavelin, Denver Falconer, Linda Hiebert, Wilf Hiebert, Amy Hierbet, Amy Nicholson, Brent Kelly and Yang Tang for their great help with making the perogies.

        April and I organized our first beer night at Vertigos Lounge, and what a great time it was. Approx 35 people attended, which meant there was more than enough beer to go around.

You are thee best!!

         I have   committed myself to helping improve the lives of people with arthritis by joining   urlLink  The Arthritis Societyâ€™s Joints in Motion Training Team   . This means I am committed to raise money for The Arthritis Society by running my first marathon in   urlLink  Lisbon, Portugal on December 5, 2004   .        The Arthritis Society is the only non-profit voluntary health association seeking the cause, prevention and cure for all types of arthritis. There are over 140,000 people right here in Saskatchewan and over 4 million people across Canada suffering from arthritis.     As a member of the Joints in Motion Training Team, I'll be working to meet two very personal goals. First is training for and completing a full marathon on behalf of someone with arthritis. A marathon is 42.2 km (26.2 miles) in length. To train for this grueling event, I will be running 4 times every week over the next 6 months which will be both physically and mentally enduring.     Second and equally challenging will be raising funds that will support the Society's research and education programs.   Throughout the fall I will be organizing several events to help reach my target fundraising goal. If you are interested, I would be more than happy to email you of upcoming events such as steak/beer nights and pub crawls.   If you would like to make a contribution to The Arthritis Society and help me reach my fundraising goals, you can do so online at my  urlLink Joints in Motion Training Team webpage .
