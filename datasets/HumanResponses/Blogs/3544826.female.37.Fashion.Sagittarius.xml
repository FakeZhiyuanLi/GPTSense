       This was a big moving weekend.  Now we are living in a cavern of boxes.  The question is always "where is my..." or "where is the..."  I was still packing while the movers were carrying stuff down.  It was so much work! At one point I sneezed and saw stars.  I never saw them so clearly.  Usually there is just a vague swimming something that disappears quickly, but this time I saw little perfectly round pinpoints of colored light that swam in little arcs, leaving fading trails behind them.  My little girl (my real daughter, not my inner little girl) is desperate.  What with all the moving and hauling and searching for things and cleaning and stuff, there is no one to play with her, to pay her attention, to take her to the park.  Remember "it takes a village"?  Where is the damn village?  We had a babysitting come by for a couple hours, and it was beautiful.

      In one of Bush's rare   press conferences  , he was asked who in the world we would be handing the Iraqi government to on June 30th.  Bush, as much in the dark as anyone, replied, "We will find that out soon. That's what [UN envoy] Mr. Brahimi is doing; he's figuring out the nature of the entity we'll be handing sovereignty over."  In other words, you'll find out when I do.  The difficulty for the White House is that no one there knows anything about Iraq.  This is why they first called for elections and afterward realized that a free election would probably make Iraq a Shiite state (similar to Iran).  Whoops!  At first, it seemed like  urlLink  a complicated caucus-based election   would be the best way to control the result, but Iraqis saw through it.  So the White House threw up their hands and appealed to Brahimi...  "The problem was that the Americans, after first agreeing to [Brahimi's] idea of a technocratic government, had changed their minds. They accepted the complaints of their friends on the governing council that they could not all be shunted aside. The Americans were also afraid that genuine independents might call for a US troop pullout."

        "A poor fellow with a craze, Sir," said Mr. Dick, "a simpleton, a weak-minded person — present company, you know!" striking himself again, "may do what wonderful people may not do. I'll bring them together, boy. I'll try. They'll not blame me. They'll not object to me. They'll not mind what I do, if it's wrong. I'm only Mr. Dick. And who minds Dick? Dick’s nobody! Whoo!"    urlLink David Copperfield  , Charles Dickens

      I saw a few news celebrities:  Chris Matthews talking on his cell phone, Tony Blankly yakking with somebody.  So it was not very exciting.  But do you know who is all over town?  LaRouche's people.  I was sitting outside Faneuil Hall, where unfortunately, they've staked out a prime piece of the marketplace.  Over to my left is Chris Matthews "Hardball" stage, and in front of me are a bunch of the LaRouchers trying to hand out their campaign literature.  I tried to give off a "not interested" vibe, but in the end one of them came to talk to me, and I figured what the hell.  I talked to her.  It was not a pleasant conversation.  Everything I said, she contradicted.  She changed things I said to bend them to her point of view.  She had an answer instantly ready for any political problem.  Not a practical solution, though: just drastic, crazy stuff, like "put all the banks into receivership" and "start bankruptcy proceedings on the IMF."  In the end, she started getting aggressive, and so I left.  I've heard the LaRouchers described as a  urlLink political cult , and that fit with the weird feeling I got from the girl.
