      Let me just start off by saying that this is my opinion, and if you think I am an asshole for writing this, that is your opinion and though I do not like it, I will respect it and move on.  Michael Moore frankly makes me sick. Moore finds every tiny thing wrong with Bush and blows it up a thousand times. The only reason that he hints at his opinion that Kerry should be the next president is because he's not Bush. In fact, Moore even admitted on the Daily Show that he never publicly announced his support for Kerry, which shows that all he cares about is getting Bush out of office. Even if it means putting Saddam Hussein into office.  Moore's recent movie: Fahrenheit 9/11 is a tragedy. He is laughing all the way to the bank with the money people are spending to see this controversial film. Don't waste your money. It's only one more method for him to be able to get more publicity and money. He looks like a bum for God's sake! He doesn't care what anybody thinks. Only his opinion matters. He supported Ralph Nader! Does anybody even know or care what party he is affiliated with?   I know Bush has his faults, but so does everyone else. I also would agree with the fact that Bush has made some mistakes with the economy, but as far as the war on Iraq goes, I support him all the way.  Anybody know of a little thing called WWII or Pearl Harbor? The U.S. decided to remain neutral and look what happened, or even more importantly and less well-known is what was going on in Germany. The Nazis were developing technology that was coming close to advancing on us. They were very close to developing nuclear weapons. In fact, if we didn't respond when we did, you would be reading this in German, if we ever got our freedom back.  If we remained neutral in the matter who knows what could have happened. And just because we didnt find any weapons of Mass Destruction doesn't mean that Iraq didnt' get close to acquiring them or even that there still are some hidden a mile under the earth's surface. You think we're the only ones with secret technological advancements? The U.S. aside, look at how horrible a dictator Saddam was. If a man forgot to pay Saddam for a loan, he would send soldiers to rape his wife and daughter(s).  So if you still want to support Kerry and/or Michael Moore, thats your perogative, but please don't question Bush's decisions on the war. I appreciate any feedback as usual in the forums. Thank-you

      For anyone who has ever wondered when and where I got my nickname: I have the story. It is as follows:  I started out as David, and some people began to know meby that name. One day in journalism class as I sat by myself at a table next to a group of upperclassmen, One of them asked, "Hey slick! Where ya from?" That person was Xavier Diez. I answered Detroit. DJ Gleising went on to say, "Oh, it's D from the D!" Xavier said, "No, DD! Tony Awrey then did something that would change my life forever: He said, "No, let's call him Slick-D."  Some sophmores began calling me Slick-D and eventually someone called me it in front of my Honors Algebra class (when I was still in it) and the freshmen class began calling me Slick-D. Variations to shape through various people including Zac's SlickDizzle and DJ's (who continues to be the only one to call me it) Dirty-D, but Slick-D Remains the most popular and my claim to fame. So thanks Tony, I owe you my name.
