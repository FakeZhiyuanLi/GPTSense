      Ok I understand the last record was about motivation and then nothing. Rather bizarre but I am a bit.   Andy suggested http://www.playforyourclub.com/play.php?14422 new game, I cant play it so have given up. Hate football anyway however was exceptionally pleased to hear West Ham will remain in the first division. There is a god after all, am sure there would have been many tears!  Tory is now 30 and says she feels no different, had a very drunk night out resulting in me being very sick in the club. Considering we were out in Tiverton it was a bloody good night. Can not remember getting home but do remember the rather nice policeman. Oh well another night out survived and I didn't reveal my breasts which was quite good (unusual). Did meet a bloke who gave me his business card but lost it and can not remember his name.........shame really he seemed quite nice. Had not realised business cards were useful for pulling purposes - will hurry up and order mine.  Anyway I can only think of smutty things to say so am going to stop now as its not that kind of site. Am sure some inspiration will come to me and I will attempt to be witty and charming once again.

      Have been thinking about why I want to write this. I suppose it is some kind of diary record of things that happen in my life. It's the parts I am prepared to share, the little bits of me people dont know but could if I told them to where to find it. It is not the really personal thoughts and feelings but allows people a bit closer than normal. Perhaps it is simply my way of rationalisng my thoughts.

      Yesterday my cleaner told me that he has had three people leave because of the state of our office and complained that last weekend there were nine bags of rubbish. Don't really see his point, if there is rubbish you clean it up, hence the point of having a cleaner, if there was no rubbish why we would bother hiring them? It seems like no one takes pride in their job anymore - am I getting old or just insensitive to others. Plus I am doubly concerned cause I was thinking about getting a cleaner at home - if they think the office is bad they need to see my house. Cleaners objecting to cleaning is this a new concept or have I simply missed the point?

      So on Saturday I happen to mention to mum that I think I might try Actimel, once she stopped laughing I thought best to forget it (was I a victim of another advertising campaign?). Get home from work on Monday to find someone has been in the house. Firstly think it could be Anthony and Cleopatra having reported me to the RSPCA for not giving them Iams and not changing their water often enough, then perhaps the ex popped back for his post, I checked the garden and dad had not been over to cut the grass so I phone mum to find out if she had been over. Bingo! Told me to look in the fridge, I find all sorts or goodies - carbonara, lasagne, strawberries, melon and the Actimel. She decided it might be worth it after all and thought she would do some shopping for me (nice). Now having my good bacteria daily and will see if I feel any different. Not had any strange urges yet but so far only had one bottle.  I have just spent all evening cleaning the house could this be the start - I wonder!?

      Ok so it gets to 1.00am and I find myself standing in Sams looking at the types (I know I am a snob but these thoughts just come into my head without provocation)the flesh baring, swearing, drinking, some almost copulating types, scare me. Yes I drink, I swear and sometimes I may even get lucky but I hope I do it in different stylie, a slightly less Jerry Springer affair with a little bit more decorom and hopefully (and not always the case) no audience.

      Today is a bit odd - starts off by me waking up after sleeping for eleven hours, I dont normally sleep for more than two at a time, really was an omen. Next get a text from the ex, I reply, and another, I reply again, not really ready for this, will now start to ignore them.   Contemplating returning to bed when the door bell rings, shall I ignore it? Decide to look out the window to see who has the nerve to arrive on the doorstep unannounced. Its mother, how many times to I have to warn her there are no guarantees its safe just to turn up - I lean out of the window and tell her to piss off but she insists on being let in.   I am told to get dressed as we are going shopping - off to Taunton, four hours later am stuck in a traffic jam on the motorway. I need a beer, I want to be outside, I want to be in the pub, I knew I should have gone back to bed!   Still have the evening to come...........

      I have just got out of bed.   Having visited the doctor earlier this week I have taken nearly four days worth of antibiotics and my face is still continuing to swell. My teeth all feel that they are about to fall out and my head feels like it is being pounded with a baseball bat.   I am taking paracetamol, ibuprofen and antibiotics is it any wonder I now also feel sick. Worst of all is I can not drink and I missed the England game last night because I was too ill to be awake.   How much longer can it last?

      Am slightly amused that I appear to be turning into a rational human being.   I am well aware I have a tendency to be demanding, emotional and a little self-obsessed, but I appear to be developing a genuine interest in other people. There is no other motivation than I would like to know them better.   It is true that I have been known to spend time with people because they can enhance my life in some way or because I want them to adore me and not because I have an interest in their thoughts or feelings.   So this less shallow me is a bit of a shock, especially as it’s effecting my sex life or should that be lack of sex life. Having only had sex with one person in the last six months I can honestly say I am really not interested in sex for sex sake.    Could this be related to the fact I have stopped getting extremely drunk, or is it just because my vibrator is so damn good and I am emotionally stunted.    The truth of it is, I have realised there is more to life than shagging – wow!

      So yesterday, I spent the entire day in bed only to be woken by my phone ringing at 14.30. Having successfully diverted it, I then had a sudden feeling of guilt and decided to see who it was. It was mum asking me to phone her urgently so I returned her call only to have her screeching down the phone 'Joanne something fabulous has happened you won't believe it'.   To me this meant a huge win on the premium bonds, or maybe the national lottery, the death of a hated one (ok may be a bit harsh) but what I was not expecting, 'Stevens here and he's lovely'. So, once I asked who Steven was and was told 'you know Janes Steven' it all fell in to place and I had a vague recollection of someone I had not seen for at least fifteen years.   Mum then went on to say he is 'really lovely Joanne, and has a job similar to yours and is thirty now'. In my shocked and half asleep state I mutter 'right, that’s nice' and mum says 'so shall I send him over then?' all of a sudden I wake up and tell mum I am spending the day in bed, I hear the disappointment in her voice and give her the option of passing on my mobile number.   Fine, I am always interested in meeting up with old friends but am not sure why the memories of the last times mum has introduced me to people keep flashing into my mind - should I be worried…………………………………………..

      There is this bloke I met through a friend of a friend and the first thing that I was told about him was that he was extremely well endowed. Obviously being a red blooded female, I quickly went about confirming this piece of information, and yes, it is true.   Having now met said individual while I was in a sober state while, others were a little worse off, I decided that being known as the bloke with a big knob must be quite difficult. True it would probably be easy enough to find candidates to have sex with but that is all it is, short term flings – does this actually lead to friendship, building relationships, mutual interests, someone to have a laugh with, or perhaps someone to fall head over heels for?   Maybe I have it wrong and said individual is happy to have his endowment grabbed by passing females, does not feel uncomfortable that it is the point of conversation when his names is raised and likes the attention. I understand the attraction of casual sex but surely there is a time when you want a little bit more?   Would you not rather be introduced as the funny, interesting, intelligent person that you actually are? I can imagine a girlfriend being pleased that her man has a big penis initially but how pissed off would she be once all her friends had had a feel?   Size matters, but not as much as knowing the person and them knowing you – a bloke with a big willy will keep my interest until I have done what needs to be done, a bloke with a great personality will keep my interest a lot longer and a bloke with both, well that’s another story!!

      Having been to Homebase at the weekend and paid for plants, pots and compost I feel I deserve some kind of recognition for this act. I now have a garden that is looked after (well dad does it for me) and it has been enhanced by my new purchases.   I feel very proud of myself!

      Well this the first Sunday in a while that I have not woken up with a hangover, simple reason is I did not go out last night. I stayed in watched Casualty and had an early night. This was nice however it did leave me with a dilemma - what should I do today? So I have cleaned the house, cut the grass, read the papers and am now wondering what to do next. What do other non hungover people do on Sundays?

      So the last post I made was Thursday morning stating my alcohol concerns. The next thing I am inviting myself to stay at a work mates house and planning on getting drunk at Nicolas picnic. so after rose wine, white wine, red wine mixed with orange juice, pimms, gin, sambucca and vodka I was a bit drunk. Not so bad in itself, however, this resulted in me flirting outrageously and the usual amount of drunken sillyness. At 5am Friday morning I was not a well person. The sweepstake at work correctly guessed our arrival time, Nicola and I arrived singing, and still rather drunk, with Alister cross that we had broken his shower - (it worked fine with me!). Had to have a half day holiday in order to feel better, will now have reputation as the office lightweight. Anyway it was a very good evening visited Brazz, The Ship and Timepiece, had fun, met some real weirdos and then fell asleep. Fanbloodytastic!

      Am slightly concerned about my alcohol levels. I do not get drunk every night, however, I probably do get very drunk once a week. Definition of very drunk is more vodka that I care to remember and a number of shots, followed by an short amount of time hugging the toilet bowl.    My latest concern stems from Tuesday night when I decided to drink the entire bottle of Sainsburys very tasty Sangria (11%). That in itself is no bad thing however I was on my own, and it was before 8pm - am I worrying unneccesarily?   The nice drunk happy feeling is good, but it now takes me a whole day to recover - perhaps I need a new hobby!

      I don't understand why being single effects some people more than others. I have now been single for five whole months and am happy about it. I have met some interesting people, some I would like to spend hours chatting to, some I would like to have sex with and some I know will remain friends forever, each different person brings something new. What interests me most are the people who I chat to who awaken a part of me that has been dormant, they are the people I would like to get to know more, to understand and spend time with, the people that challenge me. Its not about sex, you can have sex with anyone and have an alright time, for me its about two people broadening each others horizons and making their days a little different.    I may be a born romantic but thats no bad thing - its just me!

      I am on my bed in the hotel - is nice but a bit noisy. 5 mins from the  office so I get extra sleep - bonus. It only took me an hour to get to  Plymouth so I stopped off for breakfast.   Arriving at the office I saw my new boss who filled me in on my next few  weeks. Next week I am spending the week in Plymouth, the week after in  Falmouth the following week in Plymouth again and then the systems are  being installed in Sidmouth. So far so good.   The only scary part so far is the launch and press attention they are  hoping to get. They want me to be the 'face' of it and be photographed  handing over cheques for the carnival and being the contact for a pr  campaign that is going in the paper! Do they not realise I am not at all  photogenic?  Anyway I am in a TSR training group this week and am trying my hardest not  to takeover. Keep reminding myself that the training is more for their  benefit than mine.   Role plays tomorrow. I am looking forward to it - one of my many strengths!

      Tomorrow is my last day at C&W and I feel really odd about it, I have done my handover notes and tried to leave everything as organised as possible. I am sure there is something I have forgotten. I want to make the transition as straightforward as possible for my replacement - I know how horrid it is to start in chaos.   I am still scared about my new job and am sure it is going to be very demanding initially, especially since I have not had responsibility or staff for the last six months. C&amp;W has been the most easy going job I have had EVER and I am hoping I will soon get back into the mania that is call centre work.   Next week I am in Plymouth for four days staying in the Premier Lodge, I am then working in Sidmouth for two days holding open days. The Call Centre is not going live until the end of August so that gives me plenty of time to get up to speed and settled.   Tomorrow I am having a few drinks in the Prospect after work to celebrate leaving (or my soon to be ex-colleagues will be celebrating getting rid of me).   A new chapter of my life is about to start and although its a little daunting it is also&nbsp;rather exciting!    &nbsp;

      That time of year again - annual vacinations. Had the letter, Anthony was surprisingly in this morning, (obviously forgot about bin duty).&nbsp;I locked the cat flap, bribed him with his favourite treat of cooked gammon made an appointment for this evening at the vets and went to work feeling rather smug. All going very smoothly until I get home. The cat flap is hanging off the hinges and Anthony has done a runner - I wonder if children are any less hassle?  &nbsp; However I am still smiling.&nbsp;I have ordered a new mobile phone, a&nbsp;Sony Ericcson P900. It has&nbsp;only cost me £110.00 plus I get to keep my number and get 200&nbsp;minutes and 500 texts a month all for £30.00. Obviously I am putting this down to my excellent negotiation skills however the credit should probably go to Orange who have really improved their customer service and as a result their customer retention - I am impressed.

      Just returned from my latest Ann Summers trip, made a couple of purchases. A rather nice chiffon dressing gown in a deep burgandy colour and a bottle of passion fruit massage oil that is warming and lickable- sounds interesting.&nbsp; Was quite tempted to&nbsp;buy a pair of handcuffs, the metal ones that really mean you're unable to escape. Ideally I want two pairs so each wrist can be attached to the bed&nbsp;frame - maybe another time.  &nbsp;  Now I just need&nbsp;someone to help&nbsp;test the products&nbsp;- any volunteers? &nbsp;&nbsp;

      Every morning I wake up wrapped in my duvet lying diagonally across my bed.&nbsp; My bed has a warm comforting feeling and when I am under my duvet I feel protected against everything (except spiders). My bed is even more&nbsp;soothing when I have changed the sheets, I do not think there is anything in the world that can beat the feeling of getting into crisp clean sheets taking a deep breath and drifting off to sleep. Right now I want to be in my bed, I want to be asleep.

      Have decided to become a surrendered wife, have also introduced the concept to my work colleagues and friends as I feel they are assertive young ladies like myself and may also benefit. True, I have no husband but it's still worth a go. www.surrenderedwife.com  The basic principles of a surrendered wife are that she: • Relinquishes inappropriate control of her husband • Respects her husband's thinking • Receives his gifts graciously and expresses gratitude for him • Expresses what she wants without trying to control him • Relies on him to handle household finances • Focuses on her own self-care and fulfillment  A surrendered wife is: • Vulnerable where she used to be a nag • Trusting where she used to be controlling • Respectful where she used to be demeaning • Grateful where she used to be dissatisfied • Has faith where she once had doubt.  Would following these principles make me a surrendered wife or complete doormat.............I wonder!

      Tonight we are going on the Chalk & Ward summer outing, a trip on the little boat to Turf Locks organised by me. I am shocked that everyone wants to do this on a Monday night and a little disappointed - I will have to moderate my drinking.   Am staying at Kays house and very sensibly have taken this morning off to gain a few hours extra sleep in preparation and to recover from the weekend.   Am sure it will be fun and am determined not to make a complete ass of myself.

      This weekend I have been away. Alister had arranged for us to visit Nicola in the big city, no not London, Bristol.   Friday night we set off and when we arrived the four of us ended up going out for a meal. This was very grown up and civilised the wine flowed, the food was fantastic and they are all great people. So to surmise - good food, good wine, good company.   The meal was followed by a few drinks in some bars and we went home at midnight as Jules was not well. Unfortunately we arrived back singing and raucous. Jules went to bed first and I soon found the need to be wrapped in my duvet.   The next morning I was up early (Alisters snoring was driving me nuts), Nicola cooked us breakfast, Jules headed off for the remainder of the weekend to visit his mum, leaving Nicola, Alister and I wondering what to do. We decided to go the the zoo.   The zoo was fantastic. Spending many hours there we saw many animals my favourites being the lions, red panda,and the gorilla. I had no idea they were that big - truly amazing.   Last night we had a meal at home and then headed to the waterfront, went to a few bars and ended up in the most amazing club. It was actually a moored boat on the river playing the best music I have heard in a while. A kind of soul, jazz, indie mix we danced and danced finally getting home at approximately 4am.   A really good weekend - I really feel I have got to know Al and Nic better and that we actually have more in common than I first realised. The person who sent me a text asking if Al and I were getting cosy together was completely out of order, it is possible to have platonic friendships. All in all it was a very innocent weekend. I had a lot of fun with people I adore and trust.   Most importantly I feel I have taken control of my life back - and that is the best feeling.

      It seems like I have sold my soul back to the call centre devil. I have been offered a management position in a new call centre thats opening in Sidmouth, it is more money than I am on and less hours (bonus!). However it will be bloody hard work and I am a little disappointed that I can not stay and work at the advertising agency - I like it here.  The reason I am doing it is so I can extend the mortgage and pay off scumbag. Surely that in itself should be exhilerating!

      I think I said I needed to get back to work for the distraction and this week I truly embraced that concept - I even have the bruises to prove it.  Am putting the last week down to pure madness and insanity and hope next week will be slightly less eventful.  Less eventful is safe but rather dull.  Am glad I will be in Falmouth as another week in Plymouth right now would probably result in me being evicted from the hotel and work getting terribly confusing.  Perhaps this girl hasn't changed her spots after all!

      Friday night went to Timepeice, have to admit I was freaked out by the entire thing and was worried that I would come face to face with Scumbag and the slapper. It is the fact I have not seen them together and am concerned of my reaction when I do. Add alcohol to the situation and I know it will go one way or the other, I will stand there and cry or I will pick up the nearest object and beat them with it, there is a 50/50 chance of each event.  Obviously I am well aware that I should just rise above it acknowledge them with some scathing comment and move away with a disapproving look on my face. I just don't know what I would do and that scares me.  Slept at Al's, woke up at 8am, was home by 8.30am and in bed again by 9am, imagine my horror for my phone to beep at 9.20 to announce an ansaphone message. My new boss needs me to be in Sidmouth by 10.30 to do the interviews as the guys coming up from Plymouth can not make it as there car has broken down. Feeling tired and grouchy I went to work and actually had a very productive day, the candidates were all completely inappropriate but I managed to write the incentive program and some interested people wandered in off the street.  I spent most of the evening typing up the incentive program only for Andy to come on line for a chat - his girlfriend has moved out, he thinks it will turn out to be permanent and is pleased about it. This induced turmoil and confusion in mind and yet another sleepless night. I know he is a lying, cheating fucker and that I should have written him out of my life years ago but it is not that easy. I am attracted to him on a scale unlike anything I have ever experienced before. Perhaps I just need to get it out of my system - who knows.     All then went wrong during our chat on Sunday morning when Andy announced he also had someone else lined up as I had not been in touch for a while and he wanted to keep his options open and enjoy being single again. At this point I disconnected him for being an arrogant wanker, however later felt this was unfair as he has been a very good friend and it is understandable that he will want some fun - I just don't want to know about it.  Also he is currently a skint student and I am high maintenance - perhaps it is right,  girls don't like boys, girls like cars and money.  Have left it that we will try not to wreck our friendship and he will be more tactful however I am sure neither of us will stand a chance if we come face to face with each other - it is always the same magnetic force.  Looking forward to getting back to work so I can distract myself - have been giving far to much consideration to the above.
