      and barely having time to think in between...i don't plan to do this for the rest of my life of course, just a now thing for this big trip comin up....i read a quote today that said ...in the end the metaphor of a journey is utterly meaningless unless you have someone or someplace to come home to... that's been on my mind....before i know it i will be back and it is what i come home to that counts...

      i bought more stuff for my trip today, an eagle creek toiletries bag and an off the shoulder pouch to carry my mp3 player, guidebook, camera and stuff...part of the airport at Charles De Gaulle in Paris collapsed which is creepy since i will be flying out of there to go to Athens and then back to the US.  Also, they found a bomb in Athens, never have i felt more close to world events than now....

      before i go on this european trip, i must make a trip to good-ole austin...it's been a year since i left and frankly it feels like yesterday. so many things have changed but so many things haven't, it's weird, the displacement hasn't really affected my sense of time...feels like yesterday...again....the things that i miss about austin:   picnics at barton springs sushi at musashino's bubble tea at momoko's live music at stubb's bbq, emo's pretty, lazy sunday mornings breakfast taco's at the taco  shack gelato at dolce vita  apparently it seems as if i may miss the food more than anything...haha

      so athens may not be ready for the olympics, but i am ready for athens..i was watching fine living last night, around the world in 80 homes and it looked like paradise on those greek isles...i am getting a little nervous but nervousness is part of the excitement...off the subject, there has been one wedding and two engagements in the past seven days...there def. is something in the air...love, actually....haha

      i work so much that i almost forgot what life was meant to be, enjoyed. so i have decided that i am going to extend my trip so that i can visit countries such as Croatia, Germany, Spain(again) and Portugal.  i've always felt so rushed to go through western europe, and i've never had longer than three and a half weeks, so depending on my budget, i will try to go for over a month.  i know that work is expecting me back at a certain time, i only gave a tentative verbal estimated date, and work will still be there when i get back. i mean, there will always be work for me when i get back.  also, i will be working on this trip, writing away around europe... it's work to live, not the other way around.

      so i'm back from houston....it did not flood but i think my friend flooded her system with way too much tequila.  i think the trip made me appreciate dallas a little more, not much, but it's progress...

      i'm really over everything....everything being everything...it's that mid-time of the month where all the hormones in my body get together and decide to have a round-table about all i am doing wrong and how they want out. they've had it! ...work was a little frustrating, i keep thinking i need to be somewhere else, doing something a little more pro-active, being more kinetic. how many more days until i am hopping ferries to little greek islands? well, first i have to get through london and paris....

      in the past two days i have encountered two people whom have each been to the Greek Island of Paros.  it seems to be a favorite. so here i come.... the weather has all of a sudden become chilly, which is strange for mid-may.....there is flooding north of houston, of which i am headed to tomorrow morning...well at least i have big tires.

      so i ordered two backpacks from REI today. one 2800 cubic ft and the other 5000 cubic ft. i can't decide which to take since it would be nice to be able to take everything but once i'm there curse myself for dragging all my material possesions all over europe. but then again it would be a drag to not have all my stuff but a relief to have such a light load while hopping on planes, trains, ferries and taxis.......i'm thinkin go with the bigger one and pack in between....solved.

      so my initial title for the blogspot was tammy's trips, but once you remove the space between the two words to condense as a url it looks like this: tammy'strips.  hmmmmm......perhaps not... so we leave it as tammytrips.....which upon further review is still weird.  oh well....just going to have to live with it and not think about it too hard!

      i can't believe that in one week i will be in europe. the feeling is unreal because i have kept so busy that to think of a break in the routine seems an anomaly.  to not be working for three weeks..... what? enjoy life, not think of money-making, such an odd non dallas thing to do... i'm gonna wake up, hit some sites, eat everything in site, go to the beach, learn about ancient greek history, have some drinks and just not give a care in the world to anything really...sounds just bout rite. :)

      oh wow is greece beautiful. i can't believe what a wonderful time i had. the food, the islands, the people, the way of life. it was nice. why am i back? i wonder that everyday. oh well. i am grateful to have had the opportunity to go to such a lovely country and it seems as if i went at a great time. they won the eurocup this year! and athens and the olympics, ahh....is that going to be an interesting one. i wrote some poems along the way, cool beans on that, got a new wardrobe too that fits...and only three new watches. hey.... can't not know the time when you're traveling....ok, it's good to be back tho. only to look forward to the next opportunity to go back again....
