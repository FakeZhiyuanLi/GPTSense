        Deu 6:6-9 (6)  Never forget these commands that I am giving you today.(7) Teach them to your children. Repeat them when you are at home and when you are away, when you are resting and when you are working.(8)  Tie them on your arms and wear them on your foreheads as a reminder.(9)  Write them on the doorposts of your houses and on your gates.    K, well this is something that I think is pretty important, basically cus God does. The generations to come are critical!  urlLink Tim Hawkins  said that  the Christian Church is always only one generation away from withering and dying.  This means that if we don't reach  every  generation they will pretty much, be stuffed.  What I've been doing for the last 2 days has been (kind of) to do with this. I recently became aware of a group in the Wendouree Community called  urlLink Strengthening Generations  whose aim is to improve life for the young people and families in the Wendouree and also Sebas/Delacombe area. What they do is based on a plan/program called  urlLink Communities that Care . This is a secular organisation, who don't acknowledege God in any way, however, they  are  doing the work that God called us to do (James 1:27) Basically (this is what I've learned @ the workshop training these past 2 days) what they do is once a community is assessed as being ready for change, this program begins, first by setting up Community Action groups, then surveying the school population in the area to find the areas of Critical Risk for the Young People, and also the protective factors that are in place to prevent the Damaging Behaviors. Then where we are up to now is about analyzing the data (it's in a report, so we don't have to crunch the numbers- thank God!) to assess where our community needs action. It's a huge plan, very long reaching, and it's going to take a lot of work. After we've done this stage the next one is to identify the relevant service providers in the community and see how they can work together, become more effective, and to bring to attention the areas that are missing. It's all very exciting! The  urlLink results  in the USA & UK speak for themselves...

       My soul is allegedly worth £70679. Given that the exchange rate is currently 2.3999, then my soul is apparently worth $169,625.56Aus. The interesting thing is that God thought my soul was worth more than that...

       I had a fantastic weekend in Melbourne with Adam and Ruth who moved there 9 months ago so Adam could go to  urlLink  Tabor . I caught the train to Melbourne, & on the way listened to Christine Caine talk about evangelism, and why we should care. Pretty challenging. Anyway, we spent the night eating donuts, mmmm..... and playing  urlLink  scrabble . You would neva guess, but I won! Scores were Adam:144, Ruth:139, Tab:164.    Saturday  We window shopped @ Chadstone - and spent no money (amazing) 'cept for going to urlLink  Gloria Jeans  - who sell coffee not jeans, and we bought pretzels @ Eastland which I found out were not little biscuit thingies covered in salt, but kind of a dough. Yummmmm! In the evening Jodie came around and we watched  urlLink Maid in Manhattan  - I wasn't too impressed with it - it was  not dirty at least, but then again it wasn't really  anything  but trite. Oh well.   Sunday  Ruth & I went to the 11am service @  urlLink Crossway  which was about moving on from traditionalism and the stuff that tends to kill our faith & turn it into a dead religion. Very inspiring stuff. That evening we all watched  urlLink Australian Idol  - my first time - and I have to say that I was enamored with Guy. What talent! He's listed on the  urlLink Planetshakers  website, photo and all, as a singer for "the band". Nice! Can you imagine! Australian Idol @ PlanetShakers.... again.... Nice! I really hope that if he does win, or get a record deal or whateva that he uses it as a platform to spread the  urlLink gospel  .  What an opportunity!   Monday  Well, I kinda slept all morning cus I was up 'til 2am finishing  urlLink my assignment  4 Youth Ministry 2 @  urlLink Harvest Bible College . It is a book review of Leaders who will Last by  urlLink Tim Hawkins - he's a dude.  This is a link to a  urlLink review  done by sumone else, and I'll try to get a link to  urlLink my review  on the links @ the side of this page! Neways, we drove around a bit in the arvo then I caught the train back to Ballarat.  I have 2 say that I was unaware of how much I missed being away from my friends and the usual stuff we do Friday-Monday. So I was extremely glad 2 see everyone!    Well, my day didn't end there (tho it should have) cus John's internet wasn't working, cus his housemate hadn't bought more hours ( they should go  urlLink TPG ) so I went, picked him up, and he finished his assignment here. So by the time we'd finished it was late!    In conclusion  It was the best weekend really! Thanx Adam and Ruth for looking afta me so well! Miss you guys... Anyone 4 a game of Scrabble? Bring it on!

       Hmmm, this is something very interesting! I found the Alta Vista  urlLink Babel Fish  site, and translated my first blog entry into French. It goes as follows (for anyone who reads French)...  Salutations! Bienvenue à. Mon Blog! En termes d'étiquette, c'est une grande et courageuse étape, ainsi... les sorts obtenus à apprendre mais moi espérons u comme lui! En fait je ne m'inquiète pas si u ne l'aiment pas, cus on le cense que être au sujet de moi, et ce que je pense, mais j'espère qu'u pourra l'apprécier 4 étant moi; si ce sens de marques. C'est tout.    Now the strange part... I translated it directly back into English, and this it what my entry says now...  Greetings! Welcome In My Blog! In terms of label, it is large and courageous stage, thus... the fates obtained to learn but me let us hope for U like him! In fact I do not worry if U do not like it, cus one it cense that to be about me, and what I think, but I hope that U will be able to appreciate it 4 being me; if this direction of marks. It is all.   Interesting...

       Woah, lotsa stuff happening in Tab-Land! Hmmm, I'm just trying to figure out what to write. Well, today was cool, I started the Cert IV Community Services (Disability) today - Nice. I found out we'll get a letter in a couple of weeks telling us that we succesfully completed Cert III which will make me eligible for double the amount of jobs that I am now. I'm happy.   I got my computer back from Marchant's Computer Service - I only sent it in to be fixed yesterday! Fastest service around! The best thing is that the CDROM is fixed - it hasn't worked in >1 year! THANKYOU JOHNM!! Tab's happy!   I'm also trying to figure out what to do next year with work and study and stuff - planning for 2005 as well. Have to pray b4 I make any decisions,  it's too big for me.

       This artical may lack in integrity, but... it's funny!  1. Never walk without a document in your hands  People with documents in their hands look like hardworking employees heading for important meetings. People with nothing in their hands look like they're heading for the canteen. People with a newspaper in their hand look like they're heading for the toilet. Above all, make sure you carry loads of stuff home with you at night, thus generating the false impression that you work longer hours than you do.   2. Use computers to look busy  Any time you use a computer, it looks like "work" to the casual observer.  You can send and receive personal e-mail, chat and generally have a blast without doing anything remotely related to work. These aren't exactly the societal benefits that the proponents of the computer revolution would like to talk about but they're not bad either. When you get caught by your boss - and you *will* get caught  -- your best defense is to claim you're teaching yourself to use new software, thus saving valuable training expenses.   3. Messy desk  Top management can get away with a clean desk.  For the rest of us, it looks like we're not working hard enough. Build huge piles of documents around your workspace. To the observer, last year's work looks the same as today's work; it's volume that counts. Pile them high and wide. If you know somebody is coming to your desk, bury the document you'll need halfway down in an existing stack and rummage for it when he/she arrives.   4. Voice Mail  Never answer your phone if you have voice mail. People don't call you just because they want to give you something for nothing - they call because they want YOU to do work for THEM. That's no way to live. Screen all your calls through voice mail. If somebody leaves a voice mail message for you and it sounds like impending work, respond during lunch hour when you know they're not there - it looks like you're hardworking and conscientious even though you're being a devious weasel.      5. Looking Impatient and Annoyed   Always try to look impatient and annoyed to give your bosses the impression that you are always busy.  6. Leave the office late Always leave the office late, especially when the boss is still around. You could read magazines and storybooks that you always wanted to read but have no time until late before leaving. Make sure you walk past the boss' room on your way out. Send important emails at unearthly hours (e.g. 9:35pm, 7:05am, etc.) and during public holidays.   7. Creative Sighing for Effect  Sigh loudly when there are many people around, giving the impression that you are under extreme pressure.   8. Stacking Strategy  It is not enough to pile lots of documents on the table. Put lots of books on the floor etc. (thick computer manuals are the best).   9. Build Vocabulary  Read up on some computer magazines and pick out all the jargon and new products. Use the phrases freely when in conversation with bosses. Remember: They don't have to understand what you say, but you will sound impressive.  10. Have 2 Jackets  If you work in a big open plan office, always leave a spare jacket draped over the back of your seat. This gives the impression that you are still on the premises. The second jacket should be worn while swanning around elsewhere  11. MOST IMPORTANT:    DON'T forward this to your boss by mistake

       Once upon a time, on a balmy spring evening, two friends were going for a drive in a gorgeous little mazda 323 known as Pzy. The sun was setting, casting an orange glare over everything in it's path. These friends decided they were hungry, and so would go to Bilo to get some food. They needed to move from the right lane to left, so they checked it was clear, and started to merge. SUDDENLY! Out of the glare sped a car, going much faster than the prescribed speed limit! OH NO! Pzy's driver didn't want to see Pzy hurt so they swerved back into the right lane! But due to the shock the speeding car had given them they over steered onto the median strip. Now on this median strip lived a white post, a pole and a baby tree. Pzy took a liking to the white post baby tree and pole, and they made a great impression on her - beginning with the dent in the now curvaceous bumper, along the driver's door which is permanently closed and down to the rear of her body. Poor Pzy! The side mirror liked the pole so much that it decided to leave the car and live at the feet of it's precious pole, on the median strip.  Pzy will receive some counseling, and perhaps some therapy, but it won't be long 'til she is back on her feet. She will always bear the scars of her encounter, but she will grow in character as a result, and isn't that after all what life is all about?

       I was surprised to hear in class (Cert IV Disability) today that  urlLink Radio Dave  had died.  His death makes me sad. Not so much that he died, but that no one REALLY cares/ed. If they had , who knows? Another soul lost for eternity? It's heartbreaking.    Radio Dave, the music man, dead at 39   -By Catherine Best  Saturday, 22 November 2003  ONE of Ballarat's most recognisable characters has died. David Gamble, better known as Radio Dave, was found dead at his Wendouree home on Thursday, aged 39. A Ballarat icon, Mr Gamble had long been a familiar face on the streets of Ballarat. He was renowned for his mobile beep-box and quirky antics but was yesterday remembered as an enigma known of by many, but understood by few. "I think most people would have seen him and recognised him, he's pretty distinctive," UnitingCare Ballarat executive director Cliff Barclay said. UnitingCare was one of Mr Gamble's regular haunts that he wandered the streets of Ballarat to visit, invariably treading the footpaths to the tune of his latest musical fad. "He's a bit of a Ballarat icon, Radio Dave," Mr Barclay said. "I don't want to make him out to be an angel or anything, because he certainly wasn't, he was a troubled soul that sort of, in his own unique way, became a part of the Ballarat landscape." Mr Gamble was a regular at Australia Fare Pie Shop in Sturt St, where part-owner Debbie Lewis said he used to drop in. "He came in every day, we had a chair for him out in the backyard. He used to sit out in the backyard and have a coffee and something to eat each afternoon. "I know the first time he ever approached me... he just looked so down-and-out, so cold, so dirty and he just said, "Lady, can you make me a cup of coffee," and I said, 'Yeah I can do,' and it started from there." UnitingCare staff discovered Mr Gamble dead at his Wendouree house at midday on Thursday. He had not been seen in several days and staff were concerned for his welfare. Police said Mr Gamble died of natural causes, although a post mortem will be conducted in Melbourne. A funeral service will be held by UnitingCare and Centacare next week. In the meantime, people like Laurie Nigro, who owns McDonald's in Sturt St, are grappling with his death.  "I'm certainly shocked a little bit, it's only three or four days ago that I saw him down the street and to hear suddenly that he's passed away - it's a bit of a shock really," Mr Nigro said.    I wonder what his story is? Did anyone know, did they care? I didn't. Bit late now.

       This past year has held so many highs, so many lows, excitement, disappointment, failures and success.  I have learnt so much about how much I don't know! I've discovered a passion for teens in Youth Ministry that I never knew I had, and which I may not have discovered if not for my failures. I found a course that I'm actually going to complete, a job I'm excellent at! I have built relationships with people from the ages of 11 to 60 that I never realised I would cherish so much. I have learned even more to love my family - and more of the puzzle of why I am who I am!  Yeah  -  I've grown! Yeah - sometimes I really screwed up! But do you know what I learned?  That God's grace that is bigger than all my sin! Grace that paid for my sin! His mercy "that brings me from valleys of sorrow to rivers of joy." And I can say with even greater assurance than EVER before,   Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?... No! In all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us! For I am  convinced  that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present or the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 8:35,37-39)

       Don't u just love it when cool things happen?  The other day I bought a daily calendar of the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People - which gives a different piece of advice everyday. It dawned on me as I was choosing which calendar to buy that what I really want is a calendar that gives me Youth Ministry advice encouragement and wisdom. So I emailed my idea to the  urlLink Simply Youth Ministry  website - which is the place to go if you are a fan of Doug Fields (author of  urlLink Purpose Driven Youth Ministry ). Neways... today I received the following email:  Tabitha,  Thanks for the suggestion. I actually had a second to run your thought by Doug yesterday. I think it is a good idea. We will keep it in mind.  Have a good one,  Andy Brazelton    ARGH! (excited scream) They actually thought my idea was good - AND- it was "run by" Doug himself! That guy is my hero! The ministry he has and the passion for young people that comes out in his writing is amazing!I so wanna be like him! It's very exciting that he actually got to hear the idea of a little, somewhat silly, and inexperienced youth ministry team member from Australia! So, stay tuned for that calendar eh?!

       I was more than a little concerned when a member of the congregation @ my church encouraged us in his"Annual Post-Christmas Address" to take notice of what the "The Bible Codes" have proven. What I have heard of them is quite dodgy - so I decided to do some research today and make an informed decision.   This is a summary of what I have found so far   Michael Drosnin has written two books so far on this so called  "Bible Code", using the technique of Equidistant Letter Sequences (ELS). Basically they start at a letter, and then find every nth letter on from that, until they find a word or phrase. Then they rearrange the letters around this phrase or word and find other related words.   The messages that are found in this fashion are mostly very strange, but see for yourself at the  urlLink Bible Code Digest .   A website called  urlLink The Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal  has a great deal of research which has been conducted to test the validity of the claims by Michael Drosnin.  urlLink [Check out the article - it's excellent.]  What the author concludes is that ANY text can be used (biblical or otherwise)  to "find" secret messages. I found on the web a great deal of debate as to the veracity of these claims - plus a challenge issued by Drosnin  "When my critics find a message about the assassination of a prime minister encrypted in Moby Dick, I'll believe them." (Newsweek, Jun 9, 1997)    The critics answered in record time, having found at least  urlLink nine predictions  of who, when, where, and how the assassinations occurred. The clincher for me is that  urlLink Drosnin's own death  can be "predicted" using his methods in Moby Dick- the book he uses to refute his critics! The Bible Codes are totally bogus - and it scares me that people might actually take them seriously.  I believe that if God has a message for me - he'll tell me - just like he always does - I don't need any of this  urlLink frippery  to tell me "God's secret messages!"

       I was in a 2ndhand bookshop the other day - found the "Long Dark Tea Time of the Soul" but u know I can neva find ne of the " urlLink Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy " Trilogy (in four or five parts). 'Spose it's cus they're so good no one gets rid of them.  lol! Neone who doesn't realise the answer is 42 will be going... What The...?  Really, I thought the subject title was appropriate to add my own farewell to Steve -  urlLink Oh captain My captain  -   I was riveted to the TV once  urlLink Steve Waugh  entered the pitch. Well - as much as I could be seeing as how I was @ work, then I had to drive home, and then to another work all while he was batting. But I did find my old walkman which has a radio - so neva fear-Tab heard it all.  I reckon everyone else was more nervous than Steve was - It's funny that all the reporters said that he didn't convey any emotion, blah blah blah - well not in his face maybe but they should have looked @ his feet! He was jumping all over the place!   It was strange for me who started properly following Cricket in the summer of 1999 (I was in Lakes Entrance and there was nothing else to do) to see the man that is the face of Aussie Cricket (to me) say "so long". I have gotten up, more than once, in the middle of the night to watch the team this man has lead score victory after victory! So thanx for contributing to my love for cricket, dude!   I am sad that Steve has finally left (not too sad that it's silly tho) but it's cool too, b/c I'm really looking forward to seeing Ricky Ponting develop his own leadership and keep Australia kicking butt!  Oh yeah - it was kinda cute* to see Billy Bowden give him a hug @ the end - fairly un-umpirish but eh! It was nice of him to do.    * rationalization of using the word 'cute': since 1838 ' urlLink cute ' has been accepted as referring to charming. It's unadulterated, original meaning is 'shrewd, clever'.

       This weekend is the "Ministry Team Retreat". It's a weekend where we "go bush" and plan the year, learn stuff, pray and bond as a team - as the Youth Ministry Team. It's always pretty fun but full on too. Please pray 4 us this weekend and all this year eh? I've been reading the BEST book - called the "Youth Builder" by Jim Burns - the dude who trained Doug Fields . Neways - it has the most profound stuff in it! One such quote was      "What students need today is not an adult that dresses like they do, knows all the latest trends in youth cultureor even talks like they do. What students need today are adultsthat are crazy about them and are willing to share their lives with them."    Not bad yeah?   " The bottom line in youth work is not how many kids are in your youth ministry now. The bottom line is where your kids will be in 5-10 years time."

       Oh My Goodness! The  urlLink Jars of Clay  concert in Melbourne ROCKED! We got to stand right up the front - and I mean  right  up there! So so SO awesome! The play list was as follows-   -I need you- -Flood- -Crazy times- -show you Love- -Valley song- -Amazing Grace- -Sunny days- -Frail- -I'm Alright- -Revolution- -Trouble is- -Worlds Apart-  ...and then for the Encore... -Liquid- -Love Song-   Ah! It was SO excellent! Seriously, if you haven't ever listened to them, well, find sumone with one of their 7 CDs and beg to borrow it!

       Ugh! I hate being sick! the only good thing about being sick is when other people are sick with u. It's kinda nice to have unasked for shared sympathy and misery all rolled into one. Johnm is sick with the same cold, that we got from either Harvey or Heather - niether will admit guilt. Meanies.  My fish are loving the whole new clean tank, new seaweed stuff, and new food deal. I've decided to call them George, Ringo, John and Paul. Good names. I have also decided that I will not get a fifth fish or if I do, I will not call it Yoko. If you can think of ne betta names, let me know.  Registered the Youth Ministry for  urlLink Clean up Australia  day today - should be fun! Also increased my skills as a photocopier, and decided that Centrelink's new and (not)improved form logement system [you have to wait in line with all the people who have an "inquiry"] really stinks. That's all.

It reminded me of how much I dislike moving myself, and how glad I am that I haven't moved in over a year! That's the first time since I turned 18 almost 5 years ago...  Saturday is the  urlLink Deeper Launch  - get to see Paul Coleman, and play @ the Science Works all day..... Niiiccce!  Today I'm going to clean out my fish tank, and buy some more food for them - in case anyone was wondering.

       Oh yeah! Go MTR*! It was brilliant stuff! Heaps of great planning, learning, bonding, team work and playing  urlLink UNO . All essential elements of a successful MTR!   That's about it 4 that. Yesterday was  urlLink Australia Day ! In our unpatriotic country,  it's still kinda undercelebrated. The 26th also happens to be one of our friend's 21st, so we all met @ the lake to picnic, walk and see the obligatory Australia Day fire works. The fire works were pretty cool - what we could see of them anyway. Afterwards we were almost run over (I'm not exaggerating) by a council vehicle that was illegal driving on the lake foreshore. He even laughed and thanked us for letting him drive within one foot of us in the dark - we weren't happy. Moral of the story - keep away from white Toyota LandCruisers that have Ballarat City Council number plates ok?  Cool. I saw something very exciting last night @ the lake - there were  - I'm not kidding - hundreds, if not a thousand teenagers there! I was blown away by the sheer number that we encountered. At first all I felt was old - then I was reminded of our great commission and my growing life passion - to go make disciples ('specialy for me - of young people) so I was challenged to use Australia Day around the lake as a place to contact  and evangelise (the big scary "E" word) some of the youth of Ballarat who would otherwise have no contact with Jesus Christ. It's a formidable task... lucky our God has BIG Muscles!  *MTR= Ministry Team Retreat

Well - Paul Coleman was anyhow. The other dude - the comedian- well he was less than mediocre. He had a few shining moments, but on the whole he was  fairly lame, downright inappropriate several times, and disrespectful of public leaders. Fairly poor, I was quite disappointed. Science works was cool but, and we went to Highpoint and drank  urlLink coffee . My cold disappeared for the day. Very strange - as it's back again now.

Basically someone writes something, then everyone else can go and change it all - making the original author look very silly indeed! It's very cool, very silly - but very funny! It's got contributors from different countries, and by the look of things each are passionate and have very strong convictions about their religions (got that from reading their blogs! - there's no religion wars going on!)so it's going to be quite diverse. Very cool idea Chris!

       I wonder what makes humans say that becasue things have always happened a certain way that they should stay that way.  For instance: We posted our site for the Clean up Australia day first, when there were no other groups doing the site (according to the organisation). So I was taken aback today when I received a call saying that another group had done it "for ten years" and so they are doing it anyway - and they're starting at 8am not 1pm, so... there!   If anyone can thing of any other sites to clean in Ballarat, please let me know!

       It was so beautiful today! I wanted to play, so I went 'round to John's and wasted 1 & 1/2 hrs deciding what to do. So we went to the  urlLink Botanical gardens , then went and ate fish and chips.  At 9pm was the start of the  urlLink 40 hrs of prayer weekend , for urlLink  Connect Ballarat  - a movement that is basically all the different churches praying for transformation and revival in our city. Yeah! It was pretty cool. I was gonna work a bit and mostly chill 2morrow, but I'm thinking I'll go to that instead. Kel and I dropped John home, cept 5 min later we got a call - he'd locked his keys in the house... Kelly went and rescued him! That's all. Gotta go, gotta sleep.

       Went to see "The Passion of Christ" last night - pretty amazing. The portrayal of Satan (who was a woman - not that you could tell) who was far from grotesque, but rather almost beautiful was pretty cool [is also VERY COOL when Jesus crushes the snake in the garden!].  The crucifixion scene, was interlaced with the last supper - so at the time Jesus' hands are being pierced with long sharp nails, he is telling us that he loves us, and that his command to us is to love each other.  It made me realise how futile his death will have been if we don't obey him.   Found some  urlLink interesting reading  about the Passion - including why Mel Gibson made it...

       I'm intrigued to see the many reviews of "The Passion of Christ" which have already come out, labeling the film as " urlLink the bloodiest story ever told, ", "one of the cruelest movies ever" and "a sickening death trip."  - duh! It's the crucifixion of Christ! What did they expect? Sheesh!   This reminds me of a poem I found when I was in year nine:  Christmas is for the children Especially for children  who like animals, stables, stars and babies wrapped in swaddling clothes. Then there are wise men, kings in fine robes, humble shepherds and a  hint of rich perfume.  Easter is not really  for the children unless accompanied by a  cream filled egg. It has whips, blood, nails, a spear and allegations  of body snatching. It involves politics, God and the sins of the world. It is not good for people of a nervous disposition. they would do better to  think on rabbits, chickens and the first snowdrop of spring. Or they'd do better to  wait for a re-run of  Christmas without asking too many questions about  what Jesus did when he grew up or whether there's any connection.

       Ah... PC3 - their last Melbourne concert... EXCELLENT! We drove down in the sweltering heat, minus air-con, and with the windows mostly up, b/c it was just as hot outside (could hear the music better too). The concert was standing only - no chairs unless you were a special invited guest - but honestly, who wants to sit anyway! So within a meter of the stage is where we found ourselves - and there we stayed! The concert ROCKED! Fantastic stuff! I think my favorite of their new songs is " urlLink  Into your arms  ".    Into your arms  struck something in my heart the first time I heard it, and does so whenever I've heard it since. The chorus simply says "all I can do is run into your arms of love" which I guess is what I'm on the journey of discovering. I will never be able to to or say the right thing or even be the right person, for my God to love me. All that there is for me to do is run into his arms of love, and trust that he'll hold me there. I struggle, because I am "Little-Miss-Independance", not to mention a control freak, so the act of letting go takes so much more of my will and faith than I ever thought possible. Each time I think that I have done it, I find another place that I'm hanging onto.

       I was awakened this morning to the not-quite-serene tones of boys voices outside my window. It turned out to be ok, cus they were putting flowers on my car, and Heather's car! Ohhh. I'm not sure who it was, but it was some combination of Alastair, Matt, and/or John. Whoever it was we thank them.   They along with some of the other young adult type people are bushwalking this weekend in the  urlLink Otways  rainforest, which "encompasses the lush temperate rainforest and mighty trees of the Otway Ranges, the emerald green foothills, the fertile volcanic lakes country, and the stunning scenery of Australia's most famous Otways coastline".

He's my God and he is my refuge He's the rock on which I stand He's my God and he is my fortress,  He holds the oceans on his hand.  There's NOTHING my God cannot do! *****************************  Nice yeah? Well, God has totally been working in our small group, Wednesday night there were 13 girls - and still 2 more that are going to come! Go God! It's pretty daunting - but our God is BIG and he's going to give us all the strength we need. (We need lots with 13 girls between 11 and 15 in one room!)   please pray for us all on Saturday - the girls have organised an outreach activity to get their friends to - and they're running it themselves!

Praise the Lord for putting generosity into people's hearts! Very very awesome!  Then I went Opp-shopping with Dave and James, So much fun! I found a book  - urlLink  The Lost World of Everest - that I read over 10 years ago, and I never found it again! I was happy! Also got 2 hats (one is REALLY great!) a Garfield/Australian mug, a couple of long sleeved tops, and some old  urlLink Carmen  tapes. Dave found sum records - all swing, and James bought 2 old cameras that had him and Dave quite stoaked! All in all it was gr8!  Next I drove to Geelong to catch up with Yuko, who I haven't seen for almost 2 years! We had coffee in this cool-as little place, went shopping in the city, and stuff.  I gave her a  urlLink Purpose Driven Life , which she promised to read.

       Something to think about when writing. Bigger words do NOT mean better communication!   Plain English editing and a professional subeditor’s skills are similar. Both use commonsense rules to guide them to produce a more concise, clearer style. The 10 most important editing principles are: 1. Think of your reader’s needs. 2. Organise your content well. 3. Write in a natural style as if you were talking to the reader. 4. Keep sentences short. 5. Use active verbs. 6. Be specific rather than general. 7. Cut all redundant words and phrases. 8. Use simpler words rather than complex words. 9. Cut down on jargon. 10. Edit vigorously.

I reckon that having a knowledge of your typical reactions, strengths and weaknesses is hugely important (it's called self awareness).

       This play was pretty darn cool. Tragic sort of a storyline, but some fine actors! Kate and Maggie  - both awesome chicks who are in the Young adults small group that I go to, were  a part of it - Kate, "The Mother" a main character, and Maggie, having a brief but memorable cameo role as the "Madame".  Great, thought-provoking stuff. I disagree with  urlLink Chris  that it was slow. I think it was a good pace, b/c for me it was a lot to take in and process properly.

         I've decided to fan the fires of the great debate. What is the real name of the melon, with a rough outside, but yummy orange inside, that is about the size of a person's head? Is it Rock melon or Cantaloupe?  This is what I have discovered:   The true cantaloupe (var. cantalupensis), introduced to Cantalupo, Italy, from Armenia, is a hard-shelled or rock melon. [ urlLink The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition.  2001.]    If the  urlLink Australian/American dictionary  is anything to go by, Americans generaly call it Cantaloupe, while we call it Rockmelon.  I have also discovered that it's scientific name is  urlLink Cucumis melo , which really doesn't give standing to either side of this debate.  Woolworths' online friut & veg ( urlLink www.greengrocer.com.au ) calls it Rockmelon, while  urlLink Coles Online  has it listed as Cantalope.

       I'm wondering, is there a better way?   Two teenagers came to my door just now asking me to donate to the  urlLink Red Shield Appeal , to raise money for the  urlLink Salvos . I didn't have any cash b/c I didn't know they'd be coming. So I felt bad, b/c I wanted to contribute. Then I remembered - there was food money left over this week which we won't need b/c we're doing the  urlLink 40 Hour Famine . So I gave them the $9.30 out of the food tin. [Hopefully Heather won't mind...] That means that this week Heather and I instead of eating for our usual $3.50 per day, ate only $2.90 (each). That's still more than the majority of people in the world right?  So I'm thinking there has to be a better way that we can get the money to the right places! Should we have a tithe-tax? Should we try communism - with God in it?? What to do!!!!! The current way is ridiculous!

       Why I didn't show up for work - Author unknown  I had twelve bottles of whisky in my cellar, and was told by my wife to empty the contents of each bottle down the sink or else.  So I said I would, and proceeded with the unpleasant task.   I withdrew the cork from the first bottle and poured the contents down the drain with the exception of one glass, which I drank.  I extracted the cork from the second bottle and did likewise, with the exception of one glass, which I drank.   I then withdrew the cork from the third bottle and poured the whiskey down the sink, with the exception of one glass, which I drank.  I pulled the cork from the fourth sink and poured the bottle down the glass which I drank; pulled the bottle from the cork of the next and drank one sink out of it and threw the rest down the glass.  I pulled the sink out ot the next glass and poured the cork from the bottle.  Then I corked the sink with the glass, bottled the drank and drinked the pour.  When I had every one emptied, I steadied the house with one hand, counted the bottles, corks, and glasses, and sinks with the other, which were 29, and as the house came by I counted them again and finally had all the houses in one bottle which I drank.   I was not under tho alcofluence of incohol, as some theople pink I was.   I was not as thunk as you might drink.  I felt so feelish, I didn't know who was me, and the drunker I stood thero the longer I got.

        ALCOHOL ads should be banned from TV, a parliamentary inquiry was told yesterday.  Advertising companies were marketing alcohol like it was soap powder or dog food, Australian Drug Foundation spokesman Geoff Munro told the Victorian Drugs and Crime Prevention Committee.  It is a powerful drug, a potentially lethal drug. Tobacco can't advertise, pharmaceutical companies can't advertise. Why does alcohol get special treatment?"   "We wonder why young people get so wrapped up with alcohol -- it is because these are the only images they see."   He said alcohol ads were banned on television in France and Denmark and only shown after 11.30pm in Spain.   Turning Point Drug and Alcohol Centre director Margaret Hamilton said the social cost of alcohol in Australia was $7.6 billion.     He said there were more than 3000 deaths from alcohol each year.

        If we love God, then it requires us to hate idolatry. If we believe there is such a thing as goodness, then we must also recognise the presence of evil. If we believe our religion is the only way to Heaven, then we must also affirm that all other paths lead to Hell. If we believe our religion is true, then it requires us to believe others are false.  This is the claim by Amir Butler  urlLink [The AGE: June 14]  an Islamic Australian, who believes that the Racial Villification Laws are actually hurting religios groups, rather than promoting freedom, as they were intended. His statement I belive is totally true, that we as Christians must not be afraid to stand up and say, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the only Way, the only Truth and the only Life. All other roads lead to hell."

       Interesting  urlLink new laws  to be put in place in Bendigo, to make sloshed spew-ers clean up their vomit. It's part of the new push to curb anti-social behavior... I guess that kind of thing is a good start for a place like Bendigo. I'm not sure it will ever make them as cool as Ballarat though [keep trying].

       I suppose that if you haven't heard about Playschool's "thru the windows" saga that u must not live in Australia, or have contact with any form of media. In that case you wouldn't be reading this, so I'm not writing this 4 you.  There has been considerable press about Brenna and her two mums, after they were featured on Playschool, apparently   The ABC decided to film the segment after  urlLink it was contacted by a lesbian mother  who wanted to see a family similar to hers on television.   According to Brenna's 'mum's'  two mums and a sperm-donor gay father make them a perfectly normal, nuclear family  In whose reality?   The Australian Bureau of Statistics found in 2001 there were just over 2.3million mum-and-dad families and 2187 two-mum or two-dad families.  That is approximately %0.08 of Australian families.

No kidding! the  urlLink Herald Sun  reported;  "It was amazing to see them up there at the same time as us but they just seemed to be totally normal."  and this too;  They rang ahead and made a booking like everyone else.

       The "morning-after pill" is going bye-byes.  Well sort of.  It's been proposed to put it back onto prescription only because of the massive demand for it amongst teenagers, as young as 13.  urlLink The AGE  reported that  An outcome of this will be more teenage pregnancies, which result in poorer health outcomes for children and mothers than delaying pregnancies until later on. This is linked to the issue of medical record to teens being made accessible to their parents (at the moment this is not the case). Dr Glasson told  urlLink The Australian  that  the growing problem of suicide and self-harm was also a major concern if teenagers felt too frightened to confide in their GP.  So how common is teen pregnancy? According to  urlLink SUSAN MAUSHART  16 percent of teenagers (I'm assuming that's female teens!) fall pregnant each year!  So that's the facts. The thing that bothers me, is that it seems that no one really minds that the teens are having sex, just that they get pregnant. How do we find the solution to teen pregnancy unless we look to the source of the problem?! Realistically, if kids don't have sex, they won't be creating their own kids.  It's as simple as that.   Apparently however,  urlLink in the US  at least, kids who pledged to save sex till marriage were just as likely to have sex before marriage anyway, and more likely to be "unsafe". Not heartening news. So I'm guessing the whole big "lets-have-a-rally-and-hype-people up-into-making-a-pledge" doesn't work either.  Wanna know what I think? I think it requires us to have personal relationships with the teens in our lives, to spend time with them, and give them the love and attention they crave, and to let them know of their undescribable worth in God's eyes. Not just tell them, but show them. I don't believe that God is into mass education - that's why it doesn't work! Lets go one-on-one, like Jesus did, and produce healthy passionate disciples who can follow through on their convictions, regardless of the pressure to do otherwise.

       Continental make really good rice. I know that on the packet it calls it a side dish, but seriously - you'll stuff yourself if you eat a whole packet yourself - which I just did.   You can get them on special for 98c if you look, and it's a good feed. So if you have no money - get a continental rice thingo.   That's all for today :)

Anyway, James and I did our best to look awful...         urlLink       urlLink      Christop, as always, man of the moment,  sporting a beautiful  urlLink shaved eyebrow ,  and classy bottle glasses.   urlLink    urlLink        urlLink    Last but not least,  Flip - It was her 21st  we celebrated in such  a fashion.

       I'M SURE YOU'VE ALL READ THIS SOMEWHERE BEFORE- HOWEVER THIS IS JUST TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY!   Definition of a Bar-B-Que   It's the only type of cooking a real man will do.  When a man volunteers to do the BBQ the following chain of events are put into motion:   1) The woman goes to the shops.   2) The woman makes the salad, vegetables and dessert.   3) The woman prepares the meat for cooking, places it on a tray along with the necessary cooking utensils and sauces, and takes it to the man, who is lounging beside the grill, beer in hand.   4) The man places the meat on the grill.   5) The woman goes inside to organise the plates and cutlery.   6) The woman comes out to tell the man that the meat is burning.  He thanks her and asks if she will bring another beer whilst he deals with the situation.   7) The man takes the meat off the grill and hands it to the woman.   8) The woman prepares the plates and brings them to the table.   9) After eating, the woman clears the table and does the dishes.   10) Everyone praises man and thanks him for his cooking efforts.   11) The man asks the woman how she enjoyed "her night off."  And, upon seeing her annoyed reaction, concludes that There's Just No Pleasing Some Women!

       Hey all! Last week... mmmmmmm. It was NICE!!! James, Em and myself travelled to Mildura on Friday, spending Saturady and Sunday at his old place, in Walnut avenue. I discovered that Mildura has a Spotlight store, that they have a cool Salvos opshop, and that it is much warmer than Ballarat.  Sunday we decided to make our drive to Broken Hill. It only took 3 hours, so we drove an hour a go - first Em cus she wanted to drive over the boarder. Then it was my go, I hadn't driven James's car before.... ewh! A Ford Falcon (Auto) not pretty. But I like driving, so I drove. James did the trip into Broken Hill itself, we arived just on dusk, so couldn't see much.  We had our first of many BBQ's that night, and played a massive game of Warlords and Scumbags. I was the only person who upon becoming Chief Warlord retained my seat for another go. However being the lowest scumbag was fun too, b/c you get to facilitate the game... nice.  Em and I stayed in the "girl's house" unfortunatly our other room-mate snored - loudly!!! Not cool!!! The next day was James' and my 3 month Anniversary. Excitement!!! I had to write him a letter by candlelight - it was kinda fun *giggle*.  So the week passed with each day consisting roughly of, worship, lecture, morning tea, lecture, lunch, lecture, arvo tea, free time, tea, activity of some sort. It was great! I'll write more about what we learned next time. Suffice to say that it was all extremely challenging! It was an awesome experiance, and I met some "top blokes, and grouse sheilas". (Go Eric Banna!)  Unfortunatly James was quite sick towards the end of the week. Poor guy, he was trippin out all day!!!! So we drove back to Mildura on Friday night, dodging the kangas. Fun stuff that.  We vegged on Saturday and drove back to Ballarat - where it was freezing cold. In Mildura I was wearing a t-shirt.  I have still got tons of stuff to digest about what I learned and discovered that week, I'll share it when it makes more sense in my head!
