      Whew! I just finished a big piece of work and  it was good . Felt really fulfilled and satisfied the moment I clicked 'sent'. haha..that's me. A workaholic at times, cos I can work and work and don't feel the pinge in my stomach.  I love my work, more importantly my company and the people I worked with. This  dream career  didn't come easy. Found it after I have been through some rough patches after graduation. And probably that's why I value it so much :)  I look forward to coming to office each day, maybe becos I find meaning in the work that I do. Now I seriously understand Uncle's meaning of  Passion for Work .  Wondering how are you, Uncle? Kindof missed you. Maybe I shall give you a surprise visit one of these days. Looking forward to that startled yet happy face when you see me :)  I am about to get ready to go to the gym. Missed my Yoga last night and felt REALLY disappointed. So am going to make up with practice at gym later on.  Oh ya, sorry Dad, for postponing Father's Day celebration. Don't doubt our love and sincerity, cos we love you!!!

      Kaining, you looked so cute in the little white and green dress.  Maybe cuter if you had allowed me to carry you..haha..dad said its my perfume. Ok, i will stop wearing it for you.  The morning mist and damp air mimicked the climate in Frankfurt..wonderful. Really enjoyed it on the way to work.  Ade, buck up in life. Just felt tired watching you continuously trapped in a viscious cycle of ' mock ' relationships. Nothing wrong with that. It's purely a matter of choice. You know it when I said you already had the answer in your heart, but you just wanted my affirmation, of which had unfortunately antagonised with your decision.  I will stay with you no matter what. Do me a fav. Just remember to be more down to earth and realistic when it comes to relationships. Looks isn't everything. Marriage is just one facet of life, there are many more important areas that we should give priority to, not becos bf don't deserve the attention, but becos we should try to achieve a balance.   God has everything in mind for us when he made us. He has his reasons for his delays. Have faith in HIM, cos he will never let us down :) Show him that you deserve his hard work.

      Mmm..frank about almost everything you said in your blog. felt your sincerity illuminating from the words as i read them. you know i mean it when i said that. at times quite touched also but that's practically IT..haha..  i think i have changed. never used to be so expressive in the past. will hide my feelings at times, though seldom. now more liberal with them, cos i think mizpah had taught me to show my emotions through my body and words.   when you care for someone, show them. you never know whether you will ever be given another chance to display that kind of affections.   wat i do today is important, cos i will never have today again.   anyway, i don't understand. which part of my blog is  dusty ???  ps: i finally understood a portion of your star gazing poem. haha. interesting. maybe you can explain to me when i see you. i kindof like the feel of it, unlike your other pieces.

      yes, i READ your blog. did it during lunchtime when i was seriously groggy.   wat should i say? or what did you expect i would say?    now i know why i had 'unstoppable' sneezes in the morning. cos you had seriously missed me..haha..not laughing at you lor. just felt quite mmm..quite good?? to know that even a friend can miss me so much. the strange thing is, i only last met u last wed, after which you claimed i  spoilt  your star-gazing night. if i had known you missed me so much, i might have sacrificed my shopping trip last night with my sis and accompanied you?  was thinking abt the things i wanted to tell you while the bus was moving just now and my latest fav hits were humming in my ears.  oh ya, i told you i admired your frankness. yup, i like frankness. cos i am not sensitive ( as you had put it ) and a little lazy to guess emotions. that's my nature, can't be helped. maybe that's why i can't feel the knots like ah bug do.

      Went through an emotional day. Was sneezing so badly in the morning until it developed into full blown sinus..wah se..the feeling is horrid. Took 2 Chlopheniramine tabs and expected to be knocked out by afternoon. True to my words, I did and hobbled in my cubicle like a walking zombie. Didn't even bother to put makeup cos really felt lousy. Even attempted to stay awake by standing and reading my files.  But I glad its over. The medicine worked. And its all that mattered. Lose something, gain something. Forgo my sombreness, regained my health.  Went to wtc today to repair my film camera. Ya, not a typo, its film not digital, almost in antique phase. Even Canon said they no longer have the gadgets to repair my camera but will do their best. I beilieve them. Many suggested I throw away this camera and get a new one. That's becos I could easily get a good and new film camera for less than $200. Or if I had wanted some flexibility, could have contemplated getting a digital one.   But its not so simple. The Canon camera which I am currently using had accompanied me all over the world..Redang, Ipoh, KL, JB, Kota Tingi, Malacca, Phuket, PhiPhi, Chicken Island, Bangkok, Krabi, Turkey, Washington DC, Florida, New York, Korea, Nepal, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Ooty, Kolam, Allapey, Trivandrum, Sri Lanka. Its packed with memories.    You will never forsake something which had been through thick and thin with you, right?    Took a bus home from wtc seah im bus-stop. Another place stained with my memories. Will remember that particular spot for life. Same place, same setting, same atmosphere, but different emotions. Strangely, no more strong feelings.  Hi, hope you have found your 100% :)

      Yo Bunny,   You asked me to spread some of my inspirations in life to you cos you had lost your drive lately.  Maybe you are right, I am still on a ' high ' since I was back from India 2 weeks ago. But more importantly, I guess its because Mizpah had taught me how to appreciate the simplicity of life.  I realised that what's making me happy is that I have come to equate my ' responsibilities ' in life to ' priviledges '.  Cite you an example.   I dread family committments at times, in some way or another, like extended family gatherings. If given a choice, I would have chosen to hang out with my buddies.   But you know what Auntie Jenni at Mizpah told me? The Tibetan kids don't even get the chance to go home one time a year. They can only go home once in 5 years.   I watched with sadness as I saw the faces of envy when they sent off some of the other Indian Mizpah kids for a short family reunion during the holidays.  Started to reflect on how fortunate I am, cos I get to go home and spend time with my family  everyday . I work at a place I love. I have groups of fun loving friends and colleagues who missed me when I was not around. I have enough food to eat. I have clean hot water to bathe everyday. Aren't all these priviledges of life given to me?   Thank you God for everything.   Would you have been happier if all your current responsibilities as a daughter, as a friend or as a worker were suspended?  You have a choice to choose the kind of life you want.  Happiness comes easily. It's just a thought away :)

      Just came back from a Great Singapore Shopping spree at Bugis Street with my two sisters. I usually prefer to shop alone, but this time, I really had an enjoyable time with them.  Just after we had decided to make our way home, I saw this  Gorilla  bag which I had been eyeing for quite sometime. Saw it at Far East before but didn't buy it.   This time round, nothing could stop me from getting it. As I was about to pay at the cashier, I realised that the makeshift stall did not accept card transactions. It required the premitive cash payment and the best part was, I had no cash! Same for my sisters!!  With an aim to satisfy my desire, my sis started "fund-raising".We started digging out whatever we had..notes and coins. I contributed 50 cents, don't laugh ok.. Substantial stake cos wouldn't be able to buy the bag without the 50 cents..hee..   Think I am fated to own the bag..haha..cos I am holding it now.   Really reminded me of the time I was at Sigriya in Sri Lanka. We practically had to pool all our possessions to raise money to climb Silgriya. In the end even had to borrow from the driver to employ a guide.  Nevertheless, I can't help but smile to myself, cos felt its quite an achievement :)

      Ah Bug, thanks for bringing this song to me at Mizpah, so much so that I kept singing it in my dreams :)   Long time ago in Bethlehem so the holy bible said Mary's boy child Jesus Christ was born on Christmas Day  Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today And man will live forevermore because of Christmas Day  While shepherds watch their flocks by night they see a bright new shining star They hear a choir sing a song the music seemed to come from afar  Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today And man will live forevermore because of Christmas Day  Oh a moment still worth was a glow, all the bells rang out There were tears of joy and laughter, people shouted "Let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace."  Now Joseph and his wife, Mary, came to Bethlehem that night They found no place to bear her child, not a single room was in sight And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn And in a manger cold and dark, Mary's little boy was born  Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today And man will live forevermore because of Christmas Day Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day  Oh a moment still worth was a glow, all the bells rang out There were tears of joy and laughter, people shouted "Let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace."  Oh my Lord...

       urlLink    Hai, my darling couldn't recognise me ever since I came back from India. I don't think I changed that much anyway, but you know babies, they can only recognise familiar faces that accompany them all day long, not pretty faces..haha..and she sticks to my mum and dad like chewing gum on your hair.  So cute, saw her wearing the little GAP blouse I bought for her when I was in US last Nov. At that time she was only a teeny weeny babe of 3 months, but I bought this 12-18 month blouse cos sis said she would outgrow her clothes at an alarming rate.  And true enough, she is only 10 months now and the blouse fitted snugly on her.  How amazing!&nbsp; urlLink

      Hey fren,   You really made me laugh all night..can't help it. Everything about you feels and looks so so so funny tonight, especially the "40 things guys should let girls get away with".  Important abstract:   You asked her what she wanted for her birthday.   She replied, "If you really loved me, you would know" ..haha..how true..  I am in high spirits now becos of you.   Thanks, you made my night :)

      I love my mum and dad..they pamper me so much I don't think I can ever find someone else who can shower me with more love than them :)  My dad sacrifices his sleep to fetch me to work each day during his vacation.  My mum wakes up in the wee hours (I really meant wee hours.. 4.30am when she has to work and 7am when she is on vacation) to cook me lunch to bring to work. She will never forget to pack in my breakfast and fruits to accompany my meals.  Indeed, I felt strengthened after the breakfast and lunch of love from home. No doubt about that.  Thank you mum and dad.  I will work hard :)

      Prayers have to be unselfish, saturated with Love, and  free from the taint of attachment to the gift that the prayer would bring .  Prayer must emanate from the heart, where God resides, and not from the head where doctrines and doubts clash.

      Haven't been sleeping much since Monday. Spent much time catching up with my family and friends since I came back from India..but guessed its worthwhile since I felt emotionally and psychologically fulfilled though physically tired..  Just woke up from a long nap, and hey,come to think of it, this is the longest period I have slept for the past week :)

Fantastic, cos now I can share my inner thoughts and reflections with you.

      I love the feeling of blogging in the morning. I think partly becos of the freedom to type, more time to stop and ponder, and also becos the laptop is always occupied by my sis at nite.   The feeling of opening your eyes and realising that dawn is here without the reminder of an alarm is fantastic. Have been doing that for the past few mornings and  it feels extremely good . Remembered your Confucius saying.   My mind is usually clearer in the morning too, so less junk on my blog..haha  Just read my sis's blog and realised that she has an identical layout as mine. That's my youngest sis; Angelia-lookalike, and more like me compared to my other sis. Alot of commonalities in terms of dress sense, character, personality.. maybe becos we were produced by the  same factory ..haha..and most importantly I find it easier and more comfortable to talk to her. Trust her more since she can keep secrets.  I finally slept for more than 7 hours last night. Dropped dead on my sofa after I reached home last night..and slept and slept..continuously from 11pm to 7am!! 8 full hours! That's probably why I feel really energised now :)

      Am having lunch now, and blogging at the same time. I know you would see this, that's why I had to find time to write. To let you know I am here for you. Silence speaks, right?  It's hard to withstand this day of solitude from you, even though it's just 24 hours.   I am amazed by the extent that I am missing you; dunno who's  'committing suicide'  in the end..haha  I'll wait for you tomorrow, and pray for your safety and strength.   Haha..not very articulate. But that's essentially me..and what I wanted to say.

I don't know whether I deserved this precious gift, but I promise to treasure it intently.  Let me feel the light of love from you, and may I trouble the angels to send you my gratitute, Father.

      Hey,   I know you won't die. As I told you before, I don't know why I am so sure. But the feeling is the same as the last day we left Mizpah. I knew I would come back to Mizpah one day, and so that's why I didn't shed a tear.  My intuition usually quite zun one. So trust me.  I'll pray for your strength and endurance.  Just jiayou.

      Had a pleasant surprise in the morning, when I woke up and looked out of my window. The sky was a nice yellow ochre, with thunder accompanying in the background, but surprisingly, no rain.   Realised that I had become much more disciplined when it comes to waking ettiquette since I came back from Mizpah. I don't laze around in bed as much now, and wake up definitely more easily and readily. And the funny part is..this does not correlate with the amount of sleep that I enjoy..haha..ironically.  Just read this from a prayer book, not a bible though, but one that my boss had shared with me.   The secret of perfect health lies in keeping the mind always cheerful - never worried, never hurried, never borne down by any fear, thought or anxiety. If you place complete faith in the Lord at all times, you will receive His Grace. Grace takes away the pain of Karma. The Lord can save man completely from Karma.  Illnesses are caused more by malnutrition of the mind than of the body.  .

      It's raining, finally..after days of scotching hot weather.   My nose is raining too, and I am desperately trying to curb the flood that it is potentially bringing..haha..looks like I need another 2 yellow tablets to give me the boost.  Didn't sleep well last night. Woke up couple of times because I was sneezing in my dreams.   Worry not, cos I am still awake enough to challenge my day!!!  PS: Dear Lord, thanks for the nice cool weather.

      For once, since I started my blog, I don't know what to write.   Just think that silence beats words at times, cos it gives me the chance to slow down and ponder upon my thoughts and moves.

      Just had my dinner a while ago. School's re-opening tomorrow, so mum and dad will be busy once again. No more home-cooked food liao. How sad.  But despite my pure indulgence in home-cooked food, I don't want dad and mum to overwork as well. They wake up super early each day; mum wakes at 4.30am in the morning to do some housework before she leaves for marketing. Dad wakes up shortly after that, ard 5 plus to go find mum in the market before going to school together.  How tiring it must have been for them. So I m fine with hawker stuff whenever they are working. Its already a blessing to be able to have food to eat, must be contented.   Suddenly thought about my dream. I have always had a dream to build schools all around the world for children who can't afford education. Had this dream since 2 yrs ago and it came after I seriously reflected on what I wanted to do in my life. I saw an image of my school miraculously emerged in my mind while reflecting. A little like Mizpah, a little like the ranch area I saw in Korea. A little like Mountbatten. I have drawn pictures of my dream school at least 4 times and the most recent one, a mahjong size sketch, was drawn during OpLumos retreat in Feb last year. I still kept it with me. It accompanies me to sleep each night cos its placed next to my bed.   I sincerely believe in dreams. Cos with dreams, I set goals. With goals I find direction in life. With direction in life, I find my way back more easily when I stray. That's why I pick up rather fast after I fall :)   Was telling myself my short term goals (1-3 yrs) would be to let dad and mum retire soon, and enjoy life like Mrs Cheong. Travel with them. And give them more grandchildren..haha..I will try my best ok, mum?  Want to retire by 35, be financially stable, and blessed with hubby and 2 kids by then..haha..After that, continue to pursue my dream :)

      Felt strange this morning.  Normally my biological clock would stop working on Sunday, when I don't have to work. and on weekdays, I will wake automatically ard 7am.  But then today, I woke up early, considering that I slept at 4am.  And I woke with God in my heart..haha..so strange. Maybe because I asked him to talk to me. And he responded.

      **lovely song by fanfan**   总在我家巷口和你分手 仿佛象偶像剧一样 觉得我们就要发生些什么  总在回家时候不知所措 想再打电话给你 可是再见刚刚才说过  有一种想要拥抱你的冲动 想静静看着你的笑容 让你藏在怀中 直到我每天的尽头  因为想一个人而寂寞 因为爱一个人而温柔 因为有一个梦而执著 因为等一个人而折磨 因为想一个人而解脱 因为爱一个人而宽容 因为有一个梦而放纵 因为等一个人而飘泊 因为想一个人而寂寞 因为爱一个人而温柔  像夜的朦胧 你的深情难懂 我的世界因为你而不同  因为想一个人而解脱 因为爱一个人而宽容  像风的自由 你的深情难留 你的背影 是我最美丽的所有   **beautiful**

      finally got to watch spiderman today.was quite shocked when i reached the ticketing counter at PS at 2pm. it was packed to the extent that i thought they had all come to welcome an idol, maybe my  indian idol  ..haha..if you know what i mean..hahaha  reminded me of the time we were waiting for vincent and jason to check out the train schedule to Allapey at a railway station in India. me bugs and darling were just standing there stoning and talking. suddenly a bunch of indian kids popped out from nowhere and started surrounding him, asking for his name, signature and photograph..haha..that was why we named him  THE INDIAN IDOL**  thereafter.   **note: only in india, k..hahaha  managed to get the movie tickets in two minutes without having to jostle with the crowd. my secret: visa gold card. haha priority queue. no time wasted. quite impressed cos i hardly ever used that card.  this is our first show together :)  despite falling asleep on his shoulders, i kind of enjoyed the parts i watched when i was awake. find certain parts quite funnee, especially some of the lines mentioned by the cast, which were similar in context to my relationship with darling.    "Put your intelligence to good use."    "The best way to win a girl's heart is to use poetry."   becos of that, we laughed at ourselves in a pool of silence..haha..  Thank God for the so many coincidences between us   720 :)

      my goodness, angie baby...now i fully understand how it feels to have a bad tummyache.  churning, bloated, stomach cramps..took the medicine darling made for me, i believe i am on the road to recovery.  quite worried abt mum. my mum goes for regular checkups at marine parade polyclinic because of moderately high blood pressure, of which she is currently on medication. that day her polyclinic doctor called her and asked her to go back for a review, but as the phonecall was answered by my sis in the midst of her sleep, she did not question further. and mum has delayed her visit to the dr because of various "unvalid" reasons like ah ning, work..  mummy, pls be obedient k. go and see your dr on monday. i m really worried. i pray for  Lord to watch over you from above, and for your happiness and good health, always  :) Amen.

      Yup, I'm in love. I finally admitted to it..haha..  i can't hide it anymore, especially when i heard ah bug's joy for us when darling told her we are finally together over the phone just now at marina. i remembered telling ah bug that there was absolutely nothing going on between the two of us on a sunday morning few weeks ago when we were on our way to urban challenge at pasir ris park [ah bug, there really is nothing at that time!] and i also promised her should there be anything one day, i would tell her :)   darling, tks :) tks for helping me fulfill that promise to her. i am really very very happy tonight, especially after our phonecall to her. could practically feel her joy for us radiating through the phone!!!    ah bug    no need to get anything for us k. save the money. your joy and happiness for us is my best present.      angelina jolie   tks. u have been there for me, the first one to know abt this, the first one to really show support for me (re: one of your blogs really enlightened and touched me!), the one who 看水 for me.   although most of the time we only expressed how we felt about each other through our blogs, i still want to say i appreciate the things you have said and done for me, in one way or another.   ok ok, you are not used to me being so polite, but i just want to say thanks. kaiwen wants to thank you too :)oh ya, hard of u huh..got to keep this secret for so long. but quite impressed with you, cos you ACTUALLY COULD DO IT! tks :) still owe u a blog. will remember to do it.   ps: just want to say out loud..the feeling of falling in love is wonderful..never knew i could find someone, other than God, my parents and sisters, who could love me so so much. i sincerely thank Lord for all that has happened :)  721 :)

      hey Angelina Jolie, that new blogskin of yours is cool, definitely when compared to the keypad of your laptop, if you know what I mean. Frankly speaking, think you are really like me. we both reflect on our lives instead of squandering it away..haha. yup, i felt guilty yesterday evening and decided to come home early.   really think i am very xing fu, and I came to realise this not just recently, but long ago. i am surrounded by fantastic people. give you an example. my parents and sisters love me; my liebling loves and pampers me. i meet nice uncle when i was buying mee goreng at the hawker centre - uncle makes it a point to pack all my 3 plastic bags full of tabao stuff into a single carrier so its easier for me to handle; i met an interesting and outspoken trainer during my 3-day course; my coursemates are real funny and crappy - really brighten up the leadership course i am currently attending; corina remembers me - she called me up yesterday afternoon just to share a simple joy that she is experiencing with me (hey don't abuse the $ you just got from your claims!!); uncle wuts was so happy and pleased to see me on wed when i went back to NUH to visit him and the rest of my ex-colleagues; and most importantly I know that  God loves me   extremely to bring all these nice people to me and surround me every moment :)  it's amazing whenever i think of the things that God has planned for me. I sincerely thank him for everything that has happened in my life. These things were there for a reason.  i woke up this morning feeling extremely loved by everyone. isn't that wonderful?

      Just bought some joyce stickers from holland v. cool, didn't know liebling is so in love with my name..haha..  u see, it would only make sense if a gorgeous lady is accompanied by a gorgeous name, rite?  i m kind of tired right now after a long day of class. my trainer has been really entertaining and fantastic and i felt a weird sense of instant connection with her even though i have never met her before..maybe becos she has a naturally outgoing personality like i do, and we share a similar passion for our work. she said i transmit positive energy..haha..do i?

      had so many doses of emotional tonics for the whole day. surrounded by wonderful people. thank you God.  kelvin was in an extremely fantastic mood today, smiling away to me..maybe cos he is going home tomorrow??  dragged myself out to go for lunch..cos was lazy..then met kimluan and cathy at the door. turned out to be an interesting lunch with them. had a nice talk about aloha and richmond house, fraser's hill etc..really craving to go somewhere and stone for a few days.  worked hard today. when finally felt so tired, decided to take a break and check angelina jolie's blog. wow..was deeply touched by her sensibility and understanding.   aj, my grappling thoughts miraculously dissolved after reading your posted blog. thanks. i will always remember those words you wrote for me :)  mum cooked in house seafood spaghetti for my dinner. was real nice. and i suddenly missed liebling's culinary skills for a moment.   was stoning in bed after tuition at 930pm and thinking of liebling. was so touched when God fulfilled my wish after a long wait till 11pm. but it was worth it even when i had to sacrifice my sleep :)had to sneak out so that mum will not notice that i am out of bed and not resting..haha..what an excitement! even had to resort to using my room phone to call my sis at my house phone in her room so that she can keep a lookout for me to check if mum is asleep before i can go out to meet liebling downstairs. Cos shhhh...mum thought i had fallen asleep long ago after tuition finished at 930pm..haha..actually i did lah, for a short while but woke up cos i remembered i had something more important to do.  angelina jolie: yet to finish a blog for u. continue tom. cos eyes closing. gdnite.

      Was watching ray of light, or issit light of life at 9pm on Channel U..nice show.  was featuring this amazing lady, Ivy Lee, a successful real estate agent, who has won over 50 awards in the real estate field.  wat really struck me was the secret of her success was something so simple but yet fundamental;  sincerity , and  giving without expecting anything in return .  yup, that should be the true spirit of giving. 最高境界..haha  when one can finally achieve that, giving becomes an act of pure love, with no personal gains attached to it. as a result, sincerity emerges during the process of giving. that was actually the underlying reason for her success.  i have been trying to adopt the same approach in all aspects of my life..family, friends, partner, work...through doing that, I am happier, since there is no stigma attached to my giving, and hence no expectations, thus no disappointments.  i understood that long ago, but kept forgetting it.   thank you God for the reminder :)

      cool, just came back from an overnight stay at sentosa pa chalet with my lumos buddies.  interesting, cos i never knew the existence of these chalets, and the nostalgic history museums surrounding them.  missed all these lumos buddies of mine..its strange though, cos only saw them couple of weeks ago..maybe cos these are people who had been through thick and thin with me at mizpah, so needless to say, the bonds that have emerged have kept us strong even without seeing each other.  was supposed to come back only today, probably in the afternoon. but a sense of guilt brought me home much earlier. v bad. cos I had a mis-balance in my life. was sleeping on the couch on fri early morning when mum asked me in my dreams whether i wanted to have dinner at night. though groggy, remembered telling her i can't cos will be going for a chalet gathering till sunday afternoon.   even though i was 80% asleep and my eyes closed, i could sense my mum's disappointment when i told her i won't be at home to accompany her over the weekend. the guilt just flooded me. was pondering about this when i was at the chalet. and missed my mum terribly on fri night when i was at the chalet. can't explain why also. really wanted to go home..so made up my mind to do so on sat night. so i can wake up earlier on sunday and spend time at home. i did lor..am glad i made the decision. sorry mum for causing that disappointment. i did not take you for granted. promise :)    message to victor, annie, sheau wen:   as i had said during yesterday's facilitation, really want to say thanks for bringing lumos and mizpah to me. i dunno how to express this immense gratitute, cos i have learnt and gained just so so much from this expedition. thank you for the wonderful things that had happened to my life since february last year. i  REALLY  appreciate.

      hey! nice to receive a message from you about Mizpah.  are you someone from OpLumos? or are you one of my blogger friends who can connect with me through Mizpah? i tried assessing your blog, but unsuccessful, dunno why. mmm..suspense for the moment.  but whatever your identity, its definitely a pleasant surprise to hear from you :)  mizpah had left me with love, indelible memories, and a definitely more disciplined lifestyle. it has taught me how to love God..  i had actually planned to write a full blog on mizpah. look on..cos i will soon.   oh ya, i have lots of photos to share with you if you are keen, so just let me know.

      AJ: There's no such thing as dumb on your first try. It only becomes dumb when we don't learn from our mistakes and keep repeating them. You will know what I mean when you go into the circuit the next time. Bet me, you would never ever forget the tester's scoldings and expression everytime you do the crank course or go up a slope!  &nbsp;  How&nbsp;will you ever&nbsp;forget something so indelible&nbsp;when you had been so so disappointed by it&nbsp;this time?  &nbsp;  Had the same feeling as you had felt now. Was disappointed with myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can't help but did something I shouldn't have during lunch.&nbsp;Dropped the card and dropped his heart together with it. And I&nbsp;feel lousy now. I should have trusted the Lord and darling, but I deferred and swayed. I doubted.  &nbsp;  Guilt floods my&nbsp;entire self. Why did I forget&nbsp;about that basic trust which had bonded us?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      had a pleasant surprise this morning when I stepped into the office.   saw a gorgeous-looking bible lying on my table. It's a gift from Corina. I merely mentioned to her that day about wanting to get a pocket bible so that I can read God's words constantly on the go. And she fulfilled that wish :) Really very happy. It's not the tangible gift, but the love that comes from the gift, that really mattered to me.   corina, thanks :) I owe u a letter. Will expedite it..haha   darling gave me another surprise by being able to guess  EXACTLY  what I had planned as a surprise for him later at lunch but the secret is out... no longer a surprise liao ...But nevermind, the intention is good. self-comfort.   my sis is having her driving test today. Praying to Lord to withold the rain, dilute the traffic and fill her confidence. She was telling me that she had in mind the celebrations that will follow once she passes her driving test. Hey, count me in for the treats, cos my "angbao" played an important role remember? Practically digged into my bag to retrieve an angbao when i remembered it will bring good luck. it did for me. cos i passed at my first try. and i also took my test on a 16th. but it's 16th june 2002. ok will wait for your good news later :)  &nbsp;  ade commented that i am becoming prettier and prettier since i came back from india.  the fact is, i am lor and have been lor.  the&nbsp;best part is, if i am not physically tired, you would practically see me glowing, just like the fireflies at mutumalai..hahaha. mai said the same thing to me last sun at fcbc as well..  &nbsp;  my sis also commented. same for my dad. didn't realise that, but i guess, how can i not be when i am pampered with happiness from everyone?&nbsp; &nbsp;

      wow..been 2 weeks. and i have come to love you more and more each day. not good with words, but i think u are one person i know who understands me, or should i say really make it a point to know how i am feeling.  adeline met with an accident yesterday during office hours. got a shock when she called and sms-ed me after the accident. i was stuck in a full day's meeting and didn't see her sms till 4pm when i came out of the meeting room. gave me a BIG shock cos it reminded me of corina. when i met her yesterday at raffles place before i had dinner with zz jl sm and limin, she seemed alright. who would know she actually woke up and started crying in the middle of the night? got me real worried this morning when she called me. din know wat to do and darling's face just came into my mind immediately. was very affected when he told me he will rush down to accompany adeline to the doctor cos i couldn't take leave. really..can't describe how touched i was. remembered telling him i would love a man who can love my family and friends as much as he loves me :) 10 more points for u darling..haha. that was not all. in the end adeline finished her clinic visit early. so me and darling didn't get to meet her at IOH. we went for a simple lunch at pearl's centre. was quality time spent just talking to him over the that short 45 mins lunch break. he walked me back to the office in the mild drizzle under that baby blue umbrella. met felicia and saw her shocked look. aiya who cares :) that wasn't all. he went on to find a particular type of chinese medicine to improve blood circulation for adeline ( haha..i didn't mean to give the wrong instructions darling !) he didn't give up when he couldn't find it at silat. went on to chinatown and eventually got the meds. after that we arranged to deliver the meds to ade but she was asleep liao. Lord, pls tell me how can i not be moved?  really must thank God. cos he had protected adeline me and lan eng from extreme danger yesterday. adeline was hit by a car but escape unscathed. only buttock pain. whereas for me and lan eng, God shielded us from lightning yesterday. both of us just stepped out of the office buildings when suddenly two bouts of lightning struck JUST ABOVE OUR HEADS like two swords crossing in the air. the one above my head hit the alarm bell two foot steps away from me. the alarm sounded. both of us were so terrified we stood there rooted to the ground, and couldn't move for that few seconds. WOW..can u imagine? lan eng and i were hyperventilating after that all the way to the bus-stop. thank God once again, for protecting me and lan eng and adeline :)  he lost his wallet during his boxing lesson and felt very demoralised. broke my heart. but i cheered him up once again..now you know my power haha. he still insisted on delivering the medicine to ade and sending me home after that.   little little things make the man. i agree with you jet.  716 :)

      It's my fault. Didn't mean to wake up late and disappoint you. Really didn't mean to.  I panicked when I saw it was 6.55am when I woke up this morning. I knew you were already where we were supposed to meet when you called, and I could feel your sadness and disappointment although you told me you were still at home.  My tears couldn't hold back anymore after I hung up the phone.  Sorry.

      have experienced countless coincidences since we came together. sometimes really think its a wonder.   countless examples.  the night of the blackout was no doubt a primer for our relationship. and i was so  heng  lor, cos if i had gone downstairs 5 to 10 minutes later, i would have been trapped in the lift. and the sinus headache and chocolate strawberry played a part too.   his family match was partly one of the reasons i met him on that fateful wednesday night. i went down with nothing but came back with something :)   we watched spiderman at PS yesterday. i was so tired i was sleeping in his arms. but everytime tobey maguire or any of the cast was about to say something special that we could relate to, I was always awake and watching the show at that time.  yesterday on the way home from bukit timah, i was sleeping so so soundly on bus 16 that i think i would have missed my stop if i continued to dose off. but i woke up at our star gazing spot, which is two stops from home :)  while he was on his way home from tuition yesterday and i sms-ed him to tell him something, he called me ( which was something i really didn't anticipate ) just to say something really really lovely JUST AS I WAS ABOUT TO STEP INTO THE BATHROOM!!! the magical part was hearing those words from him AT THAT PERFECT MOMENT :)  few days ago, i didn't even tell him the time i was supposed to wake up the night before. but he called at 7am, the time i was supposed to wake up!  at bk after the FCBC Children's Program, we couldn't really spend time together. he left to withdraw some money from the atm machine at level 3 of PP. just as i was about to sms him and tell him i missed him... guess what happened? his sms came into my samsung inbox and it was exactly what i wanted to say to him :)   just now, when i had finished bathing and busy smearing moisturiser on myself, darling's sms came..the timing was JUST RIGHT..haha..  amazing lor. even i can't believe it sometimes, but he told me there are MORE coincidences to come, runs in his family..and i will soon get used to it..haha  719 :)

      Just realised that it's not easy being a friend,&nbsp;even&nbsp;if they are&nbsp;passerbys, according to serene's standards...haha..now i know why.   Ade, i have known u from the time i was wearing a pinafold at mountbatten. a total of close to 17 long years. but how much have we known each other?i seriously doubt so..really upset when i saw your sms this afternoon, cos it sounded so hostile especially when i started out with a good intention to ask you out&nbsp;to do some&nbsp;catchup. why do you have to complicate matters by thinking likewise? i really don't understand.   AJ ever mentioned i have rather high expectations of friends. maybe it's true..haha..but think of it from another perspective, if i don't care about you, why would i bother to be frank with you and&nbsp;point out&nbsp;what i don't think is right?   Think about it..really value you as a friend :)&nbsp;

      Feeling superb now, cos i fulfilled my promise to myself and arrived at dad's car&nbsp;much earlier than yesterday. this means that he doesn't have&nbsp;to rush off to school.  but i just realised that kaining is sick today, cos she is teething and she's having fever..my sis says she is greedy, haha..cos initially i think few months ago,&nbsp;only two teeth came out from the lower gum on the&nbsp;front, and after that&nbsp;her teeth stopped growing. but you'll&nbsp;be amazed cos she can already eat tonnes of things that you can never imagine a baby of&nbsp;10&nbsp;months would..eg. ice cream, bread, french fries, porridge, bananas, carrots and biscuits!! Amazing. I think by&nbsp;CNY, she would have been able to eat steamboat with us..haha. this time round, 4 teeth sprouted at one go! No wonder all the unconfortable symptoms are&nbsp;bugging her. Who wouldn't be?  my elder&nbsp;sis called dad to fetch her home early from nursery care cos' she&nbsp;needed help to take care of her. really wished i could take leave to do so..but i can't. my other sis would have to do the job alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  can't wait to go home and play with her tonight, but i guessed she might have gone home by the time i arrived, cos i am going for yoga and gym after work, which will stretch all the way until 8 plus.   sigh, think i am going to miss both my darlings tonight :)

      went for my first formal visit&nbsp;to kevin's place. the feeling is really different from the past two to three times when i went there&nbsp;as a friend. not that there is any&nbsp;mega difference now..mmm... we are still as close, but&nbsp;probably much closer after 1 July...   like AJ, i was in a foul mood at work today.&nbsp;felt&nbsp;drained and wanted to&nbsp;finish my work asap, and was praying for&nbsp;7pm to arrive quickly.btw, i&nbsp;have never been an unsatisfied employee, and has never&nbsp;been in my&nbsp;two years at my place of service. in fact i love what i do as a living, cos&nbsp;seriously speaking, my professional work is always tagged with a purpose, and a meaning one.&nbsp;but somehow today, it suddenly&nbsp;dawned on me that sometimes it doesn't pay to be kind at work. you get bullied and people take advantage of you.&nbsp;for a moment, i wished i was a taitai, and didn't had to bear all these nonsense.   eventually i managed to balance up this negative thought with feelings of darling and ningning and my family and God.&nbsp;maybe becos&nbsp;God saw that i had a lousy day, so he gave me a starry night with a gorgeous moon and darling by my side at 7pm. we had dinner&nbsp;at clementi kfc with his freshies ( he just came back from USP FOC and was wearing this BRIGHT yellow tee )&nbsp;Really glad i joined them for dinner ( cos i had initially requested not to&nbsp;and attributed my bad mood to PMS ),&nbsp;but the dinner turned out to be fine, cos it allowed me to&nbsp;reinforce&nbsp;some thoughts. i realised after that dinner that i&nbsp;have developed to a stage when i can&nbsp;practically ignore what others think&nbsp;of us, just as long as we are happy together and most importantly&nbsp;our families are&nbsp;happy for us.&nbsp;   i met sister sophia at kevin's place. she looked tired but pretty, must have been the full day tuition sessions..though we didn't really talk much, somehow i feel she's nice, as she makes me feel quite at ease and comfortable in his home&nbsp;:) hey, that's&nbsp;very important as it means that i can integrate into&nbsp;his family...   btw, want to thank AJ for waiting for me at the lift just now. touched man, cos i thought she would refuse when i called her from kevin's place and requested her to do so. thanks huh. i really appreciate. maybe i was just tired that day. i will&nbsp;forget it soon. God bless and i know he will look after all of us from above.   it's getting late..think i better go sleep now cos&nbsp;i have to wake up punctually at 7 tomorrow. cannot make dad&nbsp;rush again. sorry dad. really didnt mean to be late today. i will make sure i am early tomorrow&nbsp;:)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Now I seriously understand what it means by waking up with an aim. Experienced it this morning, when I was supposed to meet vit k at 7.&nbsp;u would&nbsp;understand what i mean when you have to lug yourself out of bed in this nice luring morning weather&nbsp;when your bed is beckoning you and your body&nbsp;only had 4 hours of rest.  &nbsp;  despite the above, i feel&nbsp;he's&nbsp;worth every sacrifice.  &nbsp;  we had nice teochew&nbsp;porridge for breakfast in the serene chinatown vicinity.&nbsp;my stomach was fed, and&nbsp;so was my soul.&nbsp;&nbsp;it's really important for us to have a good monday meal as we &nbsp;have to starve till thurs ..haha, or probably&nbsp;maybe tonight.  &nbsp;  it's amazing how truly motivated&nbsp;one becomes&nbsp;when&nbsp;one knows what the reward&nbsp;one is entitled to&nbsp;:)

      spent another beautiful day at home. started this sunday morning considerably early..and the feeling is good. Gotta do the same tomorrow so the momentum of life goes on and on :)  &nbsp;  haven't had much&nbsp;quality time&nbsp;spent&nbsp;at home since I came back from India. So, was real happy that I had time for&nbsp;a short nap after lunch (one of the my most sinful indulgence is to sleep after a full stomach!!!); woke up to see darling already here; having dinner with mum and dad, and talking to darling.&nbsp;gorgeous day. wished i could spend one day out of a hectic week just doing that. that's why i feel really rejuvenated now.  &nbsp;  it's another beautiful star gazing night. nothing can beat the company and scenery.  &nbsp;  P erfect .  &nbsp;  had a good insight into his family background...complicated but&nbsp;interesting. i like, cos&nbsp;that's what isolates him out of the ordinary. i was his only audience when i requested him to&nbsp;show me all the various wushu stunts he had been training..aikido, judo, bagua zhang etc..find it real cool cos gotta&nbsp;do with some&nbsp;fantasy thingy..haha  &nbsp;  will be waking up early tomorrow cos&nbsp;he has a&nbsp;4d curfew and we won't meet till thurs.  &nbsp;  finally, a&nbsp;thurs that we will be meeting :)&nbsp; &nbsp;

      i value my family a great deal. it's one of my top priorities in life, though i really must admit i'm trying desperately to spend even more time at home. seriously, i feel happy and contented just lazing around at home.  &nbsp;  darling came to my place for the first time today. frankly, i wasn't nervous or in the least worried. dunno why, but i really didn't prepare my feelings for his first visit.  &nbsp;  he fitted in like part of my family, could communicate with my parents, my sis and my  other darling .&nbsp;no fights between them..hahaha  &nbsp;  really think we don't have to spend&nbsp;the time we have for each other in an extremely&nbsp; exotic way , cos just accompanying me and stoning at home reading a book, talking to me or surfing the net together&nbsp;makes me contented enough.&nbsp;it's not boring at all, cos ' i considered this as quality time :) seriously..&nbsp;he feels the same. maybe that's why i like him. simple like i do in certain ways.  &nbsp;  it's not easy to integrate into one's family. but i am glad he has made a determined effort&nbsp;to&nbsp;do that. results wise..mmmm..ok lah..not too bad...  &nbsp;  remember to jiayou k  &nbsp;

      Oops..I gotta be an  Angel  tomorrow, cos going to see Kevin's popo, as it's her birthday.   Mmm..should not be a problem to me,&nbsp;since I have always been one or maybe rephrased as I can be one if I wanted to..hahaha..I guessed it's related to my dual personality. I can be quiet at times, not dao k..it's just my meditation or stoning time, as I need&nbsp;alot of thinking and pondering&nbsp;space to clear my mind. Then most of the other time i am usually quite hyper :)   I went to the watchshop to fix the batt for the Guess Collection watch darling bought as a surprise for me. It's cool when I saw the watch&nbsp;starting to tickle...even AJ said its gorgeous, and I feel real happy and contented and blissful :)&nbsp;

      Just came back from a wonderful retreat for the past 3 days. Can't seem to blog my experience properly, cos' it's simply beyond words.   In summary, I would say my soul is fulfilled though my body is weak.   Okok, I would throw in another bonus statement..haha..  "Every  sacrifice  was worth it. " :)&nbsp;

      Gosh..i am burning out. told myself in the morning when i woke up at 5am that i have to last through the day. And&nbsp;i did it successfully without stealing a wink, except during my lunchhour, after a&nbsp;bowl of mee which kept me hungry and craving for food the entire&nbsp;cold rainy afternoon. Thank God for&nbsp;the&nbsp;fantastic breakfast of half-boiled egg (one of my hot fav!!),&nbsp; garlic flavoured mashed potato and jackfruit&nbsp; this morning. It kept me going till lunchtime :)  You'll probably need 3 lorries to carry my head and 5 hours of massage to loosen my neck muscles now..that's how bad it is. Doesn't help much to be a pharmacist. Maybe the two tablets that i just popped into my mouth would solve the problem&nbsp;in a couple of hours time.   i need the&nbsp;magic touch...and lots of&nbsp;sleep... zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz..

      I didn't realise I had so&nbsp;many things until i started packng juz now. Good gracious, you can't imagine. I seriously wondered how did I manage to shift from my old house to my new house which I am currently staying 5 years ago!!&nbsp; As my new place is juz across the road, my younger sister and I even attempted to use a trolley to do some pre-shift cos we thought the lorry couldn't tolerate our loads!!!  Had a fun time packing just now. And almost done :)  In another month's time, I will be shifting again, but this time round, it will be my workplace. Kind of excited, cos how often would you able to shift your office right? Imagine the preps..backfile scanning, backing up of information, shredding of unwanted documents, packing my file, clearing my food..Gosh..it's a mega big task man..  I really like my current workplace; Cozy spot, conducive for working; I own&nbsp;a nice and spacious cubicle with a garden view, with a backdrop of&nbsp;trees waving in the breeze, of birds singing and occasionally the graceful dancing of raindrops on the rooftop. That's why&nbsp;I seriously&nbsp;think I will&nbsp;miss this place. Maybe big boss also felt&nbsp;the same, and he gathered people to work on some nostalgic reminescence of the whole compound - we had a professional photographer who came a few weeks ago&nbsp;to take snapshots of everyone, every corner and every significant detail. But I guessed, there are still some things that photos and videos can't capture, and it's left rooted in all our minds to bring over to our new place.  I was told I would also get a window seat at my new workplace, next to some really nice colleagues who had been a great mentor to me :) Always grateful to him, as he gave me a good start in enforcement work and stirred my interest in law. I even contemplated going for further studies in law but now the time is just not right.  Alot of major changes are slowly phasing into my life. Thank God I am taking them in my own stride and under Lord's guidance. Shall further elaborate here and there. Do check them out :)  &nbsp;

      Hey, I just came back with from a bbq with my family. Haven't done that for YEARS ( i think&nbsp;the last time we ate bbq food together was at my ah ma's place in Tanjong Rhu !!), cos my dad and mum are not keen on charcoal roasted food..although me and all my sisters are bbq fanatics. But it's the family time that really mattered to my parents I guessed.   My elder sister called and told us&nbsp;ningning is still having a fever. I think it's becos of the teething phase. Maybe she will come to my house and recuperate tomorrow..so that she can recover faster since there are more junk to eat in my house and&nbsp;more people to play with her.   Just remembered she is like Mai. When she was very sick in India and resting at YMCA, sister&nbsp;ang practically refused to let her go shopping with us.&nbsp;She&nbsp;wasn't even allowed to get out of bed.&nbsp;But&nbsp;ironically&nbsp;she did&nbsp;not recover with that scary treatment, and only got better when&nbsp;we finally permitted&nbsp;her to go Sari&nbsp;shopping with us. That's why I don't think she would ever forget that traumatic experience&nbsp;since she was telling me she wouldn't let&nbsp;sister ang&nbsp;know I was sick yesterday!   Ah Bug: Thanks for your chicken soup&nbsp;offer, although i didn't get the chance to savour it cos&nbsp;I&nbsp;recovered very&nbsp;fast with the loads of tlc.&nbsp;

      I had a discussion with darling the other day. Asked him why must there be evil on earth.   If God was powerful, why can't he remove Satan and Evil from earth so that everyone can live happily everafter?   I know this sounds very fairyish and idealistic. I asked Uncle Wuts the same question. The answers I got are as follows:   Uncle Wuts said: God is a fair God, and as he loved us,  his children , so much, he gave us a choice to choose either to be good or bad. That explains why some of the angels deferred and turned evil.   Darling said: There is no such thing as good or evil. We are all sons and daughters of God. And since we are all images of him, and theoretically since we&nbsp;are evil, thus God is also evil cos we come from him.   I hope to find the answer one day. Through reading the bible and talking to God.   I know I will.

      Am shocked by my own blurness at times. that's was what my darling said. he slipped in 2 surprises into my Fila bag yesterday afternoon, &nbsp;and i did not even realise that until he dropped some really  OBVIOUS hints ..haha dumbo me.   Was real happy,&nbsp;cos he surprised me with a&nbsp;Guess Collection watch ( the type with the rectangular watch face and cool wrist chains ).  REALLY LOVELY AND GORGEOUS &nbsp;and i loved it, especially with the special thoughts which came together with the gift.   Surprise number 2: a nice poem about the 4 legged 2 headed monster who was separated into two,&nbsp;after&nbsp;which the left half&nbsp;went searching for the right half.&nbsp;They finally found each other not long ago..haha :)   Oh ya, he also&nbsp;mentioned something about surprise number 3, at clementi interchange notice board. cool, i shall check it out and surprise myself!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I realised how easy it is for one to take things for granted. So many examples that I can think of:  1. I take buses that cruise on the Nicoll Highway to work every morning. The whole journey takes about 40mins. After it's collapse, all these buses were redirected to BeachRd/Lavendar area, and becos of that, jams are common and I needed twice the amount of time to come to work. On that fateful day, I was attending a first aid course at St John's Ambulance quarters at Beach Rd and was less than 1 km away.  I never expected such a solid highway that I have been travelling regularly for the past 8 years to collapse, but it did.  2. My mum and dad loves me so much. They provide for me physically, financially and emotionally since I was borned. But guilty as I am, I admit I hardly have time for them. I seem to be always stuck with work and committments. But come to think of it, who are the people who loves me most in this world?  3. When I was at Mizpah, water definitely didn't come easy. The mains will only release water on alternate days from 5 to 7am only. If you miss the time, the whole Lumos gang consisting 20 oddof us would have to scrimp and save H2O for the next two days. Not enough water for washing up, bathing, brushing your teeth, doing laundry, cooking and flushing the toilets. Can you imagine that when the only thing you have to do to get free flowing water in singapore is to pay $ and turn on the tap to enjoy this priviledge that many poor people around the world are not entitled to?    4. The blackout night. We find blackouts exciting, especially if it comes once in a blue moon and for a short period only. Cos it's then when we can start fishing out our torchlights, candles and portable electrical applicances that we usually would not use on electricity days. Just imagine if we have blackouts every night. Would you still enjoy it? Maybe it's high time I start appreciating the currents flowing through my mains..haha  5. Being a Singaporean. I am proud to be one I must say, and LOUDLY. Have heard tonnes of complaints about bureaucratic governments, endless fines, exorbitant taxes, increasing electricity and water bills, escalating road charges, stiffling education system etc etc. But think of the flipside. Wondering if we even remember to praise the government for our secure living environment, clean water, beautiful HDBs, loads of greenery along the roads, pretty airport, safe medicines, colourful NDP celebrations, clean environment, low crime rates ... Do you?  6. Thanking  God .  We curse when things go wrong. We unconsciously petition within our hearts when he does not answer our prayers. We rather listen to strangers who say things we like to hear instead of God's words. Praying and bible-reading are seldom priorities in our lives. If not for God who created us and granted us the niceties of the world despite our sin-ladden bodies, would we still be here?  Seriously pondering about these..and many more. Maybe it's high time I adjust my priorities in life.  Life is not only about living for oneself.

      They have been married for two years.  He loves literature, and often posts his work on the net, but nobody ever reads them. He is also into photography, and he handle their wedding photos. He loves her very much. Likewise with her. She has a quick temper,and always bullies him. He is a gentleman, and always gives in to her.  Today, she's being "wilful" again.   Her : "Why can't you be the photographer for my friend's wedding? She promised she'd pay."   Him : "I don't have time that day."   Her :"Humph!"   Him : "Huh?"   Her : "Don't have time? Write less of those novels, and you will have all & get the time you need."   Him : "I... someone will definitely recognize my work some day."   Her : "Humph! I don't care, you'll have to do it for her.! "   Him : "No."   Her : "Just this once?"   Him : "No."   Negotiation's broken. So, she gave the final warning: "Give me a Yes within three days, or else..."   First day. She "withheld" the kitchen, bathroom, computer, refrigerator, television, hi-fi... Except the double bed, to show her "benevolence". Of course, she has to sleep on it too. He didn't mind, as he still has some cash in his pockets.   Second day. She conducted a raid and removed everything from his pockets and warned, "Seek any external help, and you bear the consequences." He's nervous now. Night. On the bed. He begs for mercy, hoping that she'll end this state. She doesn't give a damn. No way am I giving in, whatever he says. Until he agrees.   Third day. Night. On the Bed. He's lying on the bed, looking to one side. She's lying on the bed, looking to the other side.   Him : "We need to talk."   Her : "Unless it's about ! the wedding, forget it."   Him : "It's something very important."   She remains silent.   Him :"Let's get a divorce."   She did not believe her ears.   Him :! "I got to know a girl."   She's totally angry, and wanted to hit him. But she held it down, wanting to let him finish. But her eyes already felt wet. He took a photo out from his chest. Probably from his undershirt pocket, that's the Only place she didn't go through yesterday. How careless.   Him : "She's a nice girl."   Her tears fell.   Him : "She has a good personality too."   She's heartbroken, because he puts a photo of some other girl "close to his heart".   Him : "She says that she'll support me fully in my pursue for literature after we got married."   She's very jealous, because she said the same thing in the past.   Him : "She loves me truly. "   She wishes to sit up and scream at him: "Don't I?"   Him : ! "So, I think she won't force me to do something that I don't want to do."   She's thinking, but the rage won't subside.   Him : "Want to take a look at the photo I took for her?"  Her : ".....!"   He brings the photo before her eyes. She's in a total rage, hits his hand away and leaves a burning mark slap on his face.   He sighs. She cries.   He puts the photo back to his pocket. She pulls her hand back under the blanket.   He turns off the light, and sleeps. She turns on the light, and sits up. He's asleep. She lost sleep.  She regrets treating him the way  She treated him.   She cried again, and thought about a lot of things. She wants to wake him up. She wants to have a intimate talk with him. She doesn't want to push him anymore. She stares at his chest. She wants to see how the girl looks.   She slips the photo out. She wanted to cry, and she wanted to laugh. It's a nicely taken photo of herself. A photo he took for her. She bends down, and kissed him on his cheek.   He smiled. He was just pretending to be asleep.     "You learn to love, not by finding a perfect person, but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly."

      When someone mentions an eagle, what do you think of in your mind?  Many people imagine a big bird, flying high up in the air, with its wings spread out, moving around gracefully with so little effort.  The eagle has very sharp eyes which can see a long distance. When it sees a meal, like a rabbit on the ground, it can come down very fast and grab the animal with its sharp claws.  The eagle is called the king of the birds. It has great strength, super vision and really strong claws.  A story is told of a man who found an eagle’s egg. He put it with his chickens and the mother hens.  Soon the egg hatched. The young eagle grew up with all the other chickens. Whatever the chickens did, the eagle also did. He thought he was a chicken, just like them.  Since the chickens could only fly for a short distance, the eagle also learnt to fly a short distance. He thought that was what he was supposed to do. So that was all that he thought he could do.  And that was all he was able to do.One day the eagle saw a bird flying high above him.  He was very impressed. “Who is that?” he asked the hens around him.“That’s the eagle, the king of the birds,” the hens told him. “He belongs to the sky. We belong to the earth — we are chickens.  So the eagle lived and died a chicken, for that’s what he thought he was.

      Felt a sense of achievement today, finished 3 tuitions at one go, all the way from 1130 to 7pm. wow, amazed by my stamina, cos it's tiring to give tuitions when your kids are not cooperative.  when i almost finished the last lap, felt so drained cos i didn't take breakfast and lunch. my blood sugar fell so low my brain was sleeping and i was spouting nonsense unconsciously to my kid..haha. luckily kevin was there for me. in the end he took over teaching eugene, who was as concussed as i was, not becos of food, but becos of sleep deprivation. reminded me of the time i was in tj. oh gosh, i was sleeping 3 hours on the average at that time, and i still couldn't seem to finish the tonnes of school work, all becos i was assigned to the triple science scholar class. nope, don't think i fitted into the scholar category, maybe just  heng  lor..haha..  btw, happy anniversary darling. just want to let you know i am feeling happier and happier each day with you around :)

      I have got 3 consecutive tuitions tomorrow, starting from 11 and ending at 6. Gracious, I think I should wake up early to have a really good breakfast cos I don't think I could squeeze out any time for lunch. But not to worry, my vitamins would carry me through :)  Kevin's popo's 80th birthday ' bash ' was good, both the people and the atmosphere. They were really nice to me, kept giving me food..haha.. do I look hungry ?  Kevin told popo he brought me along as a surprise gift for her, took me by surprise as well..but could see she was happy.  I liked their company cos I felt quite comfortable .  Think I better go and sleep. Need to regenerate for my marathon tomorrow.

      It's so easy to feel blissful. Just like being happy. You don't really have to make an effort.  My family and I celebrated Ah Ning's 1st birthday today. 12 months ago, she was still in the making. 11 months and 20+ days later, she could run already!  If I see God one fine day, I must ask him how he actually came out with the idea of creating humans :) Wonder why the bible did not say that " It was good .."  Big and small darlings all by my side today..and my whole family. All the joy of my life..felt really contented and blissful. Wouldn't mind spending every weekend like that cos' thats what families are all about. I like big families, I like the feeling of everyone squeezing together and nudging each other round the dinner table, crapping away as we munch away. Must work towards this goal in the near future..haha  Going for a Nike Real Run - Marathon. 10km. Need sometime to recharge. Gotta catch some sleep so that I can wake up at 5.30am and make myself a good breakfast. Maybe I should name it as Nike Rail Walk - Walkathon.  I miss him, although he was still at my house an hour ago. haha..power of love. okok, pls basket all your goosebumps.

      kevin and i do the most absurd things. we would never mind travelling from the opposite ends of the island (him from ntu and me from serangoon) just to catch a glimpse of each other, even if it is for that short half an hour over breakfast or lunch. we can sit outside the mrt station and chat with each other until the last train calls for our boarding. we can be so deprived of sleep and end up sleep-walking on our way home but whenever we see each other, the endorphins would keep us so high that we can go without food or slumber ( i was sleep walking on my way home from the bus-stop while he missed his bus-stop and ended up sleep-walking on AYE ). we can communicate through silence and distance and sms each other at almost exactly the time we step into our homes ( this is not the first time already!).   he completes my sentences .  seriously, i thought i was busy, in fact very busy..haha.. until i saw his schedule. he is probably the only art student with such a committed life and packed curriculum. very organised person, except his table, and this has definitely influenced me. you will be surprised at how spotless my study table is and how well i have planned my schedule. maybe i should pick up more good habits from him :)

      Wow, finally..elaine you are back. Have been waiting for you to be back. The worst thing is I don't know where you were and when you would be back.  You see, elaine is this friend of mine from MPS (Mountbatten Pri School). FYI, this retro school had been reduced to shambles. No more MPS now, what remains are just piles and piles of sand opposite the Old Airport Road Market.  Anyway, she works as a SIA air stewardess. And seems to be always flying around. Can never keep track of where she is flyign to and when she is coming back.  Need her help to sort out some + stuff. Hopefully can resolve this misunderstanding soon cos it has obviously dragged on for too long. I remembered my sis telling me that I have rather high expectations of people around me, but tell me how can I not be when they refused to self-improve and move on?  Imagine changes to only your body while your mental and emotional development remaining stagnant....that's scary...extremely horrifying..eeeeeeeeekkkkkkk....pls pls do something about it. It's time to buck up. Have a match with my niece, she is making superb progress. Already knows how to run and babytalk even though she is barely 12 months.  haha..my mum is talking to her now :) Can feel her sense of pride as she speaks to ningning over the phone even though she can't make out what she is actually saying.

      What do you really hope to achieve in life ?  There was once an American businessman who was sitting by the beach in a small Mexican village.  As he sat, he saw a Mexican fisherman rowing a small boat towards the shore and noticed that the fisherman has caught a quite number of big fishes that is known to be a delicacy.  The American was really impressed and ask the fisherman,"How long does it take you to catch so many fishes " ?  The fisherman reply " Oh, just a short while"  "Then why don't you stay longer at sea and you could catch even more ?  "The businessman was astonished.  The fisherman simply does not agree, "This is enough to feed my whole family " he says.  The businessman then asked "So, what do you do for the rest of the day then?  "The fisherman reply " Well, I usually wake up early in the morning, go out to sea and catch a few fishes, then I would go back and play with my kids. In the afternoon, I will take a nap with my wife, and evening comes,I will join my buddies in the village for a drink, we played guitar, sing and dance throughout the night. My day was ever so complete andcarefree.  " The businessman does not agree with his way of life and offered a suggestion to the fisherman. I am a PhD holder graduated from Harvard University, specialises in business management. I could help you to become a more successful person. From now on you have to spend more time at sea and try to catch as many fishes as possible. And when you have save enough money, you could buy a bigger boat and catch even more fishes. As you go on, you will be able to afford to buy more boats, recruit more fishermen and lead a team of your own. Soon you will be able to set-up your own company, your very own production plant for canned food and do direct selling to your distributors. At that time, you will have moved out of this village and to Mexico city, and then expand your operation to LA, and finally to New York city, where you ! can set-up your HQ to manage all your other branches.  " The fisherman asks, " So, how long would that take ?  "The businessman reply " About 15 to 20 years  "The fisherman continued " And after that ?  "The businessman laugh heartily " After that, you can live like a kingin your own house, and when the time is right, you can go public and float your shares in the Stock Exchange, by then you will be rich, your income will be coming in by the millions!!  The fisherman ask " And after that ?  The businessman says " After that, you can finally retire, you can move to a house by the fishing village, wake up early in the morning and catch a few fishes, then return home to play with the kids, have a nice afternoon nap with your wife, and when evening comes, you can join your buddies for a drink, play the guitar, sing and dancethroughout the night!!  "The fisherman was puzzled " Isn't that what I am doing now ??  "So, what does one really hope to achieve in life, do we really need to work so hard in life ?  What do you hope to accomplish in the end ?   *****

      I love ah ning. She's soooooooooooooooo cute, made me feel like having babies :) haha..really, can't help but sayang her. I don't even mind sacrificing my sleep just to play with her.  She was wearing the little white and green dress and i think she looks extremely girly in that outfit..especially with the little flower clip over her fringe and the small passion red slingbag over her dress.  okok..finds it quite difficult to express what i want to say. Just give me sometime to download her photo from my phone and you will understand what i mean.  Realised the kids nowadays are just so smart. My niece has the brain of a 2-year old although she is only 11months. If you pretend to flare up at something wrong that she has done, she would cup her small arms round your neck and give u a sweet little hug. How can you get angry with her huh?  Was feeding her bits of the Gardenia banana and corn bread. She loves it! Whenever i paused to do other things, she would grab the plastic bag containing the bread and walk steadily to me ( and YES, it's me only, cos i was the one who fed her !), saying mum mum mum mummm..cos she wants me to fill her little mouth with the bread again. I am really impressed cos she can remember that I actually fed her..hahaha  She loves rubber balls. If you purposely roll her toy balls under the sofa, she would do the leopard crawl and stretch her small little arms as FAR as she can go to retrieve them. You will be so amazed just looking at her overcoming that little challenge.  I really can't wait for her to come again next Tues. Will pray for my mum's nod to take care of her.

      Just watched Hui Yan Kan Tian Xia, in which Zoe Tay was introducing Madrid in Spain as part of a travel's special.  It's a beautiful place, with antique buildings, cool eateries and nice scenic countryside. Swept my heart away when I saw the real Snow White's castle. Looked like the Cinderalla castle I saw in Disneyland last winter. I liked it so much I couldn't bear to leave, especially when I saw the fireworks against the background of the castle in the starry night.  Gorgeous, just like the name of my blog..

      I just realised I can probably only see Kevin on Sunday. Hai, that's becos we are both so tied up with work. AJ possibly thinks it's ridiculous, as that's her norm for her and her loanshark bf. But it's definitely not for me and my vitamin. How can you deprive yourself of your daily supply of nutrients for more than 24 hours? You need to eat 3 meals a day right?

      Just came back from a long leisure walk from Sentosa. The race flagged off at 830 and i jogged the first 2km with ah bug and ah bang, after which ah bug saw the 1st water point and decided to stop to replenish some h2o. our jog never seemed to resume for this marathon after the water point. the momentum was kind of disrupted and we strolled and chatted for the next 7km, until we reached the jungle trail where we resumed our last 1km dash. so altogether we jogged for 3km. was thinking to myself that it's not too bad, considering i am not a freq marathon runner..haha. Used to be a sprinter in school though..it's the truth. Don't doubt that. All along I was in the school team, had a special trainer and was even nominated for the interschool national race. Even the memories of wearing those spiked and skin thin running shoes are still fresh in my mind.  Had a discussion on a project that could help Mizpah with Vic, Ah Bug, Ah Bang, Vincent, Ally and Angie at the WTC hawker centre after the run. Jason had a hunger attack and went home for some remedy. He was feeling sick from hunger even before the race started. So pls forgive him. We were thinking of setting up a " Sponsor A Kid " scheme to render some assistance to Uncle Mohan and Auntie Jenni in the kids' education. We saw with our own eyes how difficult it was for them to bring up 22 kids, yet they were still happy with life. We wanted to do something to ease their burden and make them even happier. Thought of seeking personal and public sponsorships to support the kids. We were also thinking of setting up a dedicated website on Mizpah to showcase our project to the world so that whoever who is keen to give a little can do their fair bit to spread love and warmth around.  Cool. Finally something is moving. Am glad Angie had initiated this or we'll all be procastinating.

       urlLink    That's my small darling :) Isn't she lovely? btw, she looked a little confused in the picture cos she was wondering what song we were singing just now and why is everyone so unanimous. Only after we completed the Eng and Chinese version of her Happy Birthday song, she starred at us for a moment and started clapping her hands..&nbsp; urlLink
