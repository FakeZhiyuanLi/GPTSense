      The wrestling show last night was a good one. There were a few faults with it, but for £6.50 a ticket, there's not much legitimate complaining to be done. Glad that I managed to get the car, since the main event didn't finish until about 10.45, so I'd have had to leave early if I was getting the bus back. Was good to have Snap out too.  Was meant to be going to Bedlam tonight, but it turns out that there's no real point, as my sister's working until late, and by the time she gets back with the car, it'll be too late to be worth going. 'tis a shame, as I was kinda looking forward to a slightly different night out from the usual Catty / New Flesh stuff. Still, there'll be other times to go.  Not much else happened since the last update, so I shall bid you adieu...

      Well, that's annoying. I just spent the best part of quite a long time typing out a post, and now it's vanished. Well, I'll just type it out again, but I expect it'll be a bit more truncated.  My feet are sore. I was standing up all last night, and the boots I was wearing have next to no cushioning in them. That's to be expected, since they're about 5 years old. But the upshot is that I'm in a bit of pain now.   On the journey home, I saw a guy I was at school with. Made me think about friends. I used to be really good mates with the guy, and was just about the last one to finally give up on him when his drunken arsehole antics started becoming part of who he was while sober. So I basically cut him out of my life, and when I got a new mobile, I didn't give him the new number. He's tried to contact me a few times since then, but he doesn't appear to have changed.  Anyway, he wasn't able to talk to me last night, since Eilidh had phoned me, which was somewhat of a lucky break. It got me thinking though. Looking at my mates, of the 6 (technically 7, but one's in Miami) that I'd class as the closest, the ones I can talk to about anything, only Dave was in my life 5 years ago, I'd never even met the rest. Just shows that nothing's set in stone.  Was out on Wednesday night at New Flesh. It seemed really dead, even though the numbers were up on the previous week. I think this was because there were less folk there that I knew (verging on none). So I spent most of the night talking to the Faerie, which was pretty good fun. I've certainly had worse nights out.  Going to a wrestling show tonight in Kilmarnock. Managed to get the car from my sister, which is a godsend, as the transport to and from Kilmarnock is a shambles (last bus at 10.30? I ask you...). Should be good fun.  On a bus related note, that reminds me. When I was getting off the bus last night, the guy started to drive off while I still had my back foot on the step. It was a feeling of weirdness, as I felt my leg spinning round and starting to twist around the other one. So I stumbled onto the pavement, the driver continued to drive off, and Eilidh caught the barrage of obscenities that I fired off in the bus' direction. Sorely tempted to write a letter of complaint, here.  That's about all I've got to say at the moment. May update later in the weekend.

      There's not a great deal to say here, since this is in fact the first post I've typed here. But there'll be more to come. I can't vouch for the quality though.  If you want to read the details on the shit that's been happening until now, then feel free to visit  urlLink  here . It covers the last 15 months of my life, and is of only mild interest. Shit happens.

      Well, last night was fun. In the 'Would rather have my eyes removed by a rusty spoon' sense of the word fun.  I've decided that, by and large, people are scum. One guy last night seemed unable to tell the difference between a £10 and a £20 note. So he basically accused me of being a thief and a liar. Which was silly of him, since I was 100% sure that I was right. So when he continued to try and argue his point, there was only one thing to do - break out the sarcasm. He didn't like this, but I stand by my actions.   Then, while getting the bus home, some shit almost kicked off. I'd always thought that 'Excuse me mate, could you get your elbow out of my spine please?' was a perfectly reasonable request. Apparently not. The guy next to me was clearly under the impression that his ticket gave him the right to a seat and a half, with added attempts to injure other travellers.   His attempts at 'threats' were of just about the lowest quality I've ever experienced. After repeating "don't start" many times at my initial requests (which was strange. In my view, it's the person who elbows someone else who's starting it.) he then changed his line of argument to "What are you wanting to say?". Which again was strange, as he repeated that so often that he never even gave me a chance to say anything.   Thank fuck the weekend's over, is all I can say. I can only hope that time will solve problems. It should never have come to this though.

      "...and we're still waiting for the results from Cathouse (Landing), Cathouse (Street outside), and Riginals. All other constituencies have been declared."  So, only been 2 days or so since I updated, but there's stuff to say. Oh, there's stuff to say.  Friday night, went to the Catty. Sober, but still not a bad night. Started to dance, but lasted a song and a half before my left knee went, so that was that for the night. Thing is, every time I start to think about getting the knee checked, it clears up for a while, so I forget about it. Pesky trees. *shakes fist*  Decent amount of people were there, and Steve and Kat made it out together, which is always good. Night took somewhat of a turn for the worse later on, far too much politics for my liking (ironic, since I have a degree in the subject).  Which brings us to last night. Went to the cinema to see The Italian Job. Or rather, tried to, but it was once again sold out. So we went to Once Upon a time in Mexico. Was mildly impressed with the film, but it seemed to be little more than some flashy set pieces (which were very well done, don't get me wrong) with a rather disjointed 'plot' thrown in to try and link them. Some amusing moments in there, and once again, Johnny Depp steals the movie.  Post movie, I went to the Catty again. This time, I was drinking. Oh dear god I was drinking. Can't remember a great deal about how much I had (which should give you a rough idea), but I woke up this morning with an empty wallet and a VERY sore head.  Racking my brain for (somewhat sketchy) details of what went down, and I come to the conclusion that once again, I'm an arse when I'm drunk. Apologies (profuse ones, no less) to all those who I may have offended. Upon getting the bus home, I then took 15 minutes to get from the bus stop to my house. Those amongst you who have been to my house will know how ridiculous it is to take this long. The quest for speed is not helped by falling over walls and into people's gardens. Ahem.  Following on from that, and I'll once again be sober for quite a while. That's about it really. Going to go and take some aspirin now.

      Watched the replay of the wrestling last night, wasn't too bad a show. Some crazy bumps OF DEATH, and some not too bad wrestling all in. Triple H jobbed as well, which makes it all worthwhile. Not a massive turnout, but more than would have been there had I watched it on Sunday night. Good to see Heather back up for the first time in ages as well.  Plan for afterwards had been to go to frequency, but that wasn't on, so I just pissed about online for a bit and then went to bed.  Wednesday night wasn't so good. Went to New flesh as always, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I normally do. After about an hour there, I was tired and just wanted to get to my bed. Didn't really spot anything wrong with the night musically, it may just have been the way I was feeling.  I keep getting invited for interviews for these jobs that I applied for from the job fair. I only applied half-heartedly, hell, I don't want half the jobs, but they keep trying to offer them to me. Still, I'll see how those go, got a few interviews next week.  Shenanigans are afoot. The bad kind. I get the impression that there's about to be a screwjob ending, and I can't help but think that it's entirely deliberate. It's what they've secretly wanted for ages now, and if things pan out the way they're looking, then they'll get it. I will have no part in their ill-gotten supremacy, though. It's old school or not at all.  Elsewhere, I'm getting inklings of something stirring, but at the moment, they're nothing more than that. Text is annoyingly good at concealing true feelings and thoughts.  ...and now for the weekend. Busier than normal for me, plus the return of an honourable night out. Should be fun.

      Interview didn't go too badly.   Job seems easy enough, and in response to my earlier worries, apparently the late shift in the bar finishes at 2.30am, which is better than 'when they stop drinking'.  Should find out in a few days, they said.  Fuck all else happened. Ciao.

      Who'd have thought it?   For the first time in a long time, there was no Pay-Per-View watchery on Sunday. Most of the folk who normally show up for it were unable to attend for whatever reason, be it working or having just had a kid etc, so I decided it wasn't worth staying up until 4am alone, and went to the Catty.  Wasn't a bad night, some decent conversations, and I danced for a longer time consecutively than I think I ever had before. Given my general level of unfitness, this came damn close to killing me.   Afterwards, ended up giving Stacey a lift home to Motherwell, since wherever she was meant to be staying had fallen through. Road was an absolute deathtrap, particularly on the way from Motherwell back to mine. Parts of it were practically a river. Still, made it home by a reasonable hour.  Got a job interview tomorrow, for bar work in some hotel in the city centre. It's one of those jobs that I just applied for to try and keep the dole office off my back, with the predictable haphazardness about the application form, and they've only gone and given me an interview. Still, if I do get it, it'll be money until I get one of the infamous 'proper jobs'.   The one possible downer on it is a late license. I've worked in a hotel once before (for 3 shifts! - well, actually, I quit because of this) and the license basically kept going until the guests stopped drinking. So you'd be rota'd on until close, and would have no idea when you'd finish. Still, we shall see if this does that.  So there's that tomorrow, then New Flesh at night, and I'll be watching the replay of the wrestling pre-Frequency on Thursday.  I'll probably update again after the interview. Byeeeeeee.

      Not been up to a great deal.  Did a shift in the Scotia on Thursday. Plan was to head along to Frequency afterwards, but by the time we got finished (which was in time for curfew), Steve had texted to say that it was dead quiet, and they were closing it at 2am. So went and got some food from Bifteki, and got Steve outside. Gave him, Kat, and Eilidh a lift home, and sat online for an hour or so.  Woke up yesterday, and Bifteki's revenge had been exacted. My stomach appeared to have taken an intense dislike to its contents, so it ejected them. Anything I tried to get down there made a prompt reappearance, and from now on, I eat at riginals.  Feeling a bit better today, so that's not so bad.

      Stand back. It's rant time.  Last night, went to Revolution for the first time in about 18 months. I had a not bad time. The music was pretty much the same as all Muppet's other nights, but there was good banter from various sources, and I think things are getting back the way they ought to be on one front.   But there was one downer on the night. it was quite hot in there, so I went to the bar to get a pint of water. And waited for TWENTY FUCKING MINUTES to get served. What in the blue hell is up with that?!? This night is constantly busy, yet they put 3 staff on. Now I know how busy these night can get, hell, I worked in Strathclyde's Union for a while, but that was just beyond the pale. I mean, we were never that bad at Rage, we always managed to get folk served reasonably quickly. It wasn't a great hassle, because I wasn't drinking alcohol, but the wait was ridiculous. Future trips to the bar took place upstairs.   Speaking of Unions, it would appear that contrary to what I was told earlier, Rage WILL be back, but they're putting it in Vertigo. For those of you who've never worked in the Union, that translates as 'They're trying to kill it'. Vertigo is seriously the absolute worst venue for a night in there. It's cavernous, so unless it's rammed full, then there's no hope in hell of any atmosphere being generated. The bar is tiny, even smaller than the QM, and can only really hold 4 staff before 'too many cooks' syndrome kicks in. It's also too small to cope with the number of freshers who will inevitably show up for Rage. So, they'll stay sober, or spend a large chunk of their night queuing for the bar. And we all know how much fun that is.  I don't give it very long until the students get fed up waiting, and migrate to another rock venue on a Thursday, be it the catty or Frequency, a new rock night upstairs in Fury Murrys, with top-quality promos that are better than both the Catty and the Union. God, I sound like Fletcher with all this whoring. Unclean....  Back to the rant about last night. Having left the QM and dropped Sarah, Layla and Dave off, I headed to the airport to pick my sister up from her flight in from Tenerife. Parked the car, and went in to wait. Bored and tired, as there's a minor delay on the flight, so I decide to go and get a coffee to kill time for a bit.   That turned out to be a good plan, with just one little flaw. No fucking coffee shops were open. Is it really that difficult to have a small stand of Starbucks or whatever open overnight for the poor suckers who are probably quite tired and might actually NEED some coffee? Evidently, it is that difficult. Idiots. Fucking provincial airport 9-5 mentality. Fuck it in its stupid ass.  Plane gets in, sister gets off, and we head back to the car. I've been parked for 65 minutes. Put the ticket in, and guess how much payment they demand? Go on, guess. I'll wait. Done that? Good. If you guessed £4.10, then you're spot on. FOUR POUNDS MOTHERFUCKING TEN! If the ticket machine had had a gun and a mask, and said "This is a stick up", then it might have been a more blatant example of highway robbery, but that's the only way. I am still absolutely fucking livid about this.   Short of doing a 4x4 escape over a flowerbed there was no real way to avoid paying it, so I was forced to cough up.   That's about all that's been happening recently, really. New Flesh tonight, more than likely. I'll maybe go to a pub or something to watch the Celtic game beforehand, sinceit's on Sky Sports extra, and ntl don't carry that channel.  Ciao anyway folks.

      So, I did get up at 6am. That's more kinds of early than I'd like it to be. Still, by the time I got all the crap sorted (and had one of the most hurried breakfasts in the history of the human race) it was daylight (ish) and I headed off to the palace of Scapegoat. Filled the car with petrol on the way.  So we drove to Leuchars (albeit half an hour behind schedule - like I expected anything less...) and halfway there, we discover that the A9's been closed. A body had apparently been found. Hideously inconvenient, what with several thousand people heading to the airshow, and several thousand more going to the Celtic game in Dundee.  Road being jammed solid as it was, we shot off down the backroads, and made it out of the other side of Perth and back onto the proper route. Only about 3/4 of an hour late for the show, as it happened.  Funny incident as, having flashed our tickets at the car park entrance, we got to shoot through past the queue (who were all clearly buying tickets on the door) and into the show. This annoyed some decrepit old coffin-dodger, who was obviously of the opinion that Britain got where it was by waiting in line when it didn't have to. One suitably dirty look from Kat later, and we were in, and he was still waiting. Message for old dude: I'll still be alive in 10 years, I would expect. You?  The show itself was fairly entertaining. Planes doing things that they really shouldn't, and some of the shit that the Red Arrows were coming away with was fucking insane. It had so much potential for fiery crash death, but to their credit, they pulled it off fantastically well.   One criticism of the show was that there wasn't a great variety of planes there. The Tornado and Hawk (albeit slightly different variations) made more than one appearance each, and there were a few planes (like the Jaguar) that seemed to be there to 'make up the numbers'. The show would have benefited from a few of the more recent additions to the world warmongers federation, or possibly even just some from a few more varied countries. To translate that roughly, we wanna see the Russkies!  Things took a definite turn for the worse when we reached the car. It would appear that the FUCKING MORONS who were parked on either side can't open a door without smashing it into my car. No dents, but still a slash of red paint on my door, and some blue paint on the passenger side.   I mean, come on, is it really difficult to show a little consideration for someone else's property? Cars are fucking expensive, and I'm not too keen on having some inconsiderate fucktard damage mine, simply because they're too moronic to open the door more gently, or squeeze out of a slightly smaller gap.  Part of the blame has to lie with the air force guys they had running the car parking, as they could have seen that that was likely to happen, and maybe spaced the cars out a bit better.   The car's a clapped out old wreck anyway, but that's not the point here. It's the principle of the thing, more than anything else. I am so fucking pissed off at that.  Still, came home, and started to feel a bit tired about halfway, so stopped off for a bite to eat and a bit of a rest. XL Bacon Double Cheeseburger meals rock. Even if the guy serving them is slow as hell, and they're a little burnt round the edges. But what can you expect from some motorway services?  Made it home just after 8 or thereabouts, and a quick look at the car reveals that I've done 230 miles today. Which is a lot of driving.  Still, I'm pretty tired, so I'll finish this up now.

      The job fair was pretty sucky, as it turned out. Not a great deal of stuff that appealed to me, if we're being brutally honest. Got a few forms, and a booklet of jobs that are available in the city council. saw a few that I could do, so I'll give those a go. Most of the time these days when looking through job info, it's like a contest to see how far down the advert I can get before I hit the requirement that disqualifies me. Was a bit panicky as to how to apply in time for the closing date (which is this Monday), but found out that you can apply online, so that gives me the weekend to fill it out.  Was out on Wednesday there, as it was, is and ever shall be. Wasn't a bad night, all things considered. I didn't dance too much (in fact, only one song), but there was decent banter from various sources.   Did have an encounter with the evil watch destroying gremlin OF DOOM. Or the Faerie, as she's otherwise known. She grabbed my hand, and actually tore the strap clean off. She claims it was an accident, but I remain suspicious. I'm sure she's got shares in a watch manufacturing company. Or maybe that's just the conspiracy theorist in me.Upshot is that I had to go into town and get a new watch. The strap on that was too long, so I flung it into a jewellers to get it altered. Should be ready in a day or so.  Freuency's opening night last night. I was drinking, fo the first time in a while, and in a surprising twist of fate (as opposed to a swanton - b'doom tiss) I wasn't a miserable drunk. It would appear that if I drink VKs of whatever flavour (apple is fantastic), then I end up as a happy hyper drunk. Which is the kind that I enjoy being. So there was no moping about last night, no bemoaning everything that goes wrong in my life. Which is always a bonus.  The turnout wasn't great, but there hasn't really been a lot of promotion for the night so far. Musically, it whips the ass of the Catty and its tired Thursday playlist of overly commercial. Steve played Real American as well, which again is a good thing. I'm sure the night'll pick up as time goes on. I'll probably end up there most nights, but probably only a 50-50 mix of drinking and not. Fistfight on the bus as well. And people wonder why I take the car most of the time.  Going to Leuchars tomorrow for the airshow. Should be a good day out, but it will result in getting up at 6am or thereabouts. Hopefully there'll be a crash. Balls of flame are always good.  Not a great deal else to say, really. A few situations are in danger of escalating, and a few others are subsiding, so I shall keep somewhat of a watchful eye on those. No great concern to be shown yet though.

      Was up at Steve and Kat's last night. The visit has confirmed one thing for me that I was well aware of, but am now acutely aware of: I'm never having kids. I simply do not have the patience to look after something that small and annoying. I'm sure it's cute and all, but the constant crying would have resulted in defenestration if it was my child. Hence the no kid-having in these quarters.  Elsewhere, not been up to a great deal. was out on Sunday night, and it was fairly amusing, as Jam once again comes to the fore in riginals. I wonder what they must think of us in that place.  My sister's away on holiday for a week, leaving today, and yet the first I found out about it was yesterday. Gotta love that whole 'communication within the family unit' thing. Still, it means a week of no restrictions on my use of the car. And a week of paying for all of the petrol.  Gonna probably go to this job fair thingy tomorrow, see if that brings anything. Doubt it, but it's always worth a shot.  Not really had much to say, so I shall say not very much. Indeed, I haven't. Cheerio!

      Not been here in a few days, due to many factors, the main one of whihc is that the site hasn't been working on my PC. I'm sure there's a logical explanation for it, but until it presents itself, then I'm going to blame the ageing hunk of junk that passes for a computer currently sitting on my desk.  As a result of this, I don't expect I'll say too much. Each time I tried to come here, I had plenty to say, but it's not so fresh in my mind, and so won't be as long winded (OI! No cheering!).  So anyway, went out on Wednesday night to New Flesh, and had a surprisingly good night. Musically, I only danced once, but that was due to the troublesome left knee of doom - sorry, OF DOOM! - giving me pain again. The songs were great though, a whole bunch of them that I really enjoyed. Was good to see some folk out (at NF) for the first time in a while, and I generally just had a damn good time.   Also on Wednesday, I bought a ticket to go and see Dream Theater in Manchester in the new year. 16th January, to be precise. The ticket arrived this morning (technically yesterday morning, since it's after midnight), and I'm just all happy. I just have to sort out transport down there, and all will be well in the world. Words cannot describe fully how happy I am that I'm going to get to see them live. Best of all, the shows are billed as 'An Evening With...', which means that there's no support. i.e. Dream Theater'll be on stage for close to 3 hours. It just does not get better than this.  Moving on to Thursday, we end up in the Cathouse, and we're sober. Actually, no, we aren't, I am. Most others are fantastically drunk. Again, an absolutely off-the-charts night out. For some reason, it wasn't too busy (well, not by Thursday's standards anyway), and there were a good amount of decent people out. Dave and Eilidh were both pretty blitzed, and chaos ensued as dave ranted about how the Cybermen were made entirely of jam, and wore silver boiler suits to try and disguise this. He the told the guy in Riginals that he wanted jam on his whatever-he-had, rather than salad and sauce. But it was a comedy sight, and eye pokings abounded.  Friday was soemwhat dull. Went to the cinema to see Jeepers Creepers 2....and once again I'm glad I have an unlimited card. Whatever critic that the advert quoted as saying it was 'The Horror movie of the year' must clearly have watched it on January 1st, since it's an awful, awful film. It's too slow, it's too predictable, it's too long, the shocks aren't shocking, the horror isn't scary, the creeper himself is proof that what you don't see is scarier than what you do (especially when what you do see is laughable), and the special effects aren't very special. If you have 2 hours of your life where you're looking to do something less fun than stapling your head to a wall, then this is truly the movie for you.  Tonight (Saturday) I covered another shift in the Victoria. Despite the odds being stacked against us (there were only 2 of us on, and we had next to no change - which became actually no change by the end of the night) we still got through it pretty pain-free, and the bar took a decent amount of money. Had to get a taxi home since the buses all seemed to be full and weren't stopping at the stop I was at, but hey, shit happens. And one customer found out the hard way (by not getting served for some considerable time) that my name is not 'big fella', and attempting to get my attention with those very words will fail. Catastrophically.  Not gonna be up to much tomorrow (technically today). Shall probably drop into the Clutha and see Eilidh for a bit, and give her the tapes I made up. (She asked me to make up some tapes of music that I think she should be listening to - what has she let herself in for?). So she's got some Tool, Led Zeppelin and Dream Theater to be getting started on. Probably Cattying at night. Might drink, depends how I feel in the morning.  On that note, I shall head off to my bed, since I'm tired in extremus.

      Was covering a shift in the Vic last night. It seemed pretty quiet, but managed to take in £400, which apparently isn't bad for a Tuesday night. One guy was in though, and oh dear god he was the most annoying and boring man in the world. When he found out I'd done a degree in Politics, he went off on a rant about how Scotland is dying, and it's all the fault of the politicians who legalised abortion. Now at this point, I heard a small sound, but didn't know what it was. With hindsight, it was an alarm bell going off in my head.  Later on, it got worse. I was wearing a Led Zeppelin t-shirt, and the conversation went a bit like this: "Zeppelin were a good band. But they're all dead old now." "Yeah. Hell, one of them's a corpse" "But his spirit's in heaven" "If you believe that sort of thing, then yeah, I guess" It turns out that was just about the stupidest thing I could have said, as I was then subjected to a rant about how 'The Lord' (in quotes because it's fictional) was guiding our spirit and our soul from this world to the next. I said I didn't believe all that, and once you die, you're worm food. Cue him telling me that  "Oh, it's not about belief, it's historical fact".  Somewhat annoyingly, I couldn't let him have the full brunt of my argument, I had to try and be as non-offensive as possible. Oh, how I wish I'd been on the other side of the bar, to tell him that sorry, but he's talking shite, and the fact is that this so-called God simply doesn't exist, and was an invention of the church to try and scare the people into slavish obedience.  The guy then went on to tell me to make the most of my life, and how he'd raised 5 kids in a Canadian mining village and never taken a day off work in his life, and...file under boring stories and irrelevant opinions.   Other than that, not a great deal's happened. New Flesh tonight, and it appears that there's been a fuck-up with the sound system at Fury Murry's, so Steve's night upstairs there doesn't open now until  next  Thursday.  That's all for now, folks.

      Just got the standard daily nonsense from my mum there. I'm really getting sick and fed up with her constant nagging about the fact I don't have a job. Does she think I haven't noticed? Then when I can't be bothered answering the same fucking questions every day, she walks away as if she somehow thinks she's in the right. Newsflash: She's not. What exactly does she think she's going to accomplish by complaining because I'm on the internet? I've heard the same lecture time and time and time again, and you know what? I still don't give a fuck what she thinks.  The fact is, she last worked in 1979, before I was even born. But she seems to be under the impression that she knows all there is to know about the employment market. When in reality, the way she thinks things work is exactly the way things don't work. And just because a tactic worked once for 'the daughter of a friend' (I mean, really, that's up there with "Some guy gave it to me" in the grand hall of woeful attempts to back up a statement) does not mean it'll work for me.  She's often brings out the "As long as you're happy with your lives, then I don't mind what you do" argument. Apparently, this has the hidden proviso "as long as it's exactly what I envisioned you doing". It drives me insane at times, it really does.  On the job front, away from the rants of an ageing moron, I signed on again this morning. Got held up for ages 'cos the guy in front of me in the queue seemed to be incapable of answering even a simple question from the guy at the desk. Although this meant that when it came my turn, the guy practically went hypersonic in getting my stuff signed. Had a quick look at the job terminals to see what was available, and it made depressing reading. Just about everything seems to have unreasonable requirements or a really shite salary. I hate to say it, but I don't see it being much longer before I cave in and go back to bar work.   Speaking of which, most of the others from the Darkroom last year have had a letter for the past few weeks asking if they're gonna be back this year. I have had no such letter. So it appears from my marvellous powers of deduction that they don't want me back. I guess that's probably because of the slating I gave them on the internet after they made me redundant before the summer.   I don't care, to be honest, if they asked me back, I don't know if I'd go. Let's face it, the place is going to shit, and even though Allan Mawn's leaving, that leaves Sniffy in overall charge of the bars and such like. So no-one but her will be allowed to take any sick days, and her friends  and dealers  will get all the jobs and contracts.  I did hear that the Barony and Gameszone (currently being refurbished) aren't going to be ready for freshers week there. Mere words are insufficient to describe the joy I felt upon hearing this. That place is a potential goldmine, and it's being run into the ground. There goes another year's takings. *laughs*  I think that's enough ranting for one day. More Union-bitching to come in future entries, you can be sure of that though.  Had an odd night last night. Went to the Cathouse, and it was different from a normal Sunday night there. Well, not different as such, just there were a whole lot more people there that I knew, it was almost like the Sunday nights of a couple of summers ago.   Started off promisingly enough, decent banter with a few folk, but as the night went on, things went...kinda weird. I don't even know why they felt weird, it was just like something was out of place. I can't quite put my finger on what it was, though.  Anyway, enough of this malarkey, I'm off to do very little.

      New Flesh last night, the first night of what the geeks amongst us would refer to as v5.0. I wasn't even planning on going, but since it's almost a tradition that I turn up (and drink) on the opening night in a new venue, I turned up, and drank.  I'll be the first to admit it wasn't really a promising start, I arrived at 9.30, and the only other people in the club (apart from the staff) were Steve and Mhairi. But it soon picked up, and folk started appearing, including some who I haven't seen in fucking ages.  As for the venue itself, I can honestly say that I think Steve's struck gold with this one. It isn't the cavernous expanse that Destiny and Privilege were, and it's not the sardine tin that was Reds. It's as close to perfect as he's going to get for the numbers that a Wednesday night draws. The dancefloor is roomy but not too big, and there's some suitably dark corners to hide from (or with) folk in. I don't think New Flesh can survive another move in the next 12 months, so here's hoping this time it works out.  At work, I got my shifts for when I go out on the sales floor. 7.45 - 3.30, and 7.45 - 4.00 every second Saturday. Early starts ahoy, but here's the good bit: Every Monday off. So Sunday nights are back on for going out, and PPV's will return to my house with a vengeance (or is it Survivor series - b'doom tiss). This is doubly w00tsome, as Mondays are the busiest day for the workers. Also, I'm not working on the Saturday directly following training, so that's good as well.  EDIT: This bit wasn't meant to be public knowledge yet, apparently. Sb yyqsd mhiyne xykb vra Iieuncg Tsu sa topbrzaga gb xyo ocwxsizy wya.

      Where to start?  Nothing much of note happening in work, only a few minor points. I scored 100% on the first 'proof of learning' test that they did, but that's nothing to write home about, as a trained monkey could pass with flying colours.  Also, I joined the Communication Workers Union today. I feel so dirty, joining a union, pesky communist scum. But the benefits are good, so there's advantage-takery ahoy to be had on the horizon.  As regards the workmates, we're actually all still getting on really well. Which is good. One of them in particular is really decent, and actually seems to find my sense of humour amusing as well, so all kinds of bonus there.  Destiny are being a bunch of theiving gypsy cunts. They're refusing to pay Steve for last night because he put a shout out about the moving of the night. This isn't over though, not by a long shot...  Saw Finding Nemo last night. Despite horrendous traffic problems getting in there, it was actually really enjoyable. For all that it's aimed at kids, there's plenty there to keep the attention of the adults, with quite a few nods to other movies. And the sharks are so Pythonesque it's untrue. Only one scene that I didn't like (and I mean  really  didn't like), but other than that it was all good.  This always happens, I have shitloads to say, but when I actually come to put it all down, my mind goes blank. Ah well, shit happens.  Ciao.

      Thieves are stupid, it would appear.  My sister got her purse nicked at the Tunnel last night, and they took the cloakroom ticket out of it, and went and got her bag. The scummy thieveing gypsies then stole her mobile phone, but, get this, left all her money, all her bank / credit cards, and took a scarf that was worth about a fiver.  The bag was then found abandoned at the end of the night, and someone phoned here today to say that they'd found the purse outside afterwards, and could we go and collect it.  So it appears that the phone and scarf are all that's gone.  Still, I hope death and pain visit them in great quantities.

      Spent most of today at the cinema, and it was certainly a day of two halves.   First movie to be seen was League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. And it sucks more than a hoover factory. Now, some of the set design was fantastic, I will give the movie that, but they appear to have spent the entire budget on that. The special effects weren't special, the cast (Connery in particular) seemed most disinterested with the whole thing, and the plot made next to no sense. I mean, come on, for fucks sake, Mina harker's supposed to be a vampire. So why is she checking herself in a compact mirror?!? Or is she a special kind that DOES have a reflection?  This movie also raised an issue that I've been meaning to rant about since I saw Hulk. The British film classification system. Why did they bring in the 12A rating? What was wrong with 12? Now, any parent can take their kids to see one of these movies, and the fact is that many kids simply have no idea of how to shut the goddamn hell up in cinemas. I preferred it when it was a simple 'Are you 12? No? Then fuck off'.  Thankfully, there were no such similar problems in the second movie we saw. Kill Bill. I can say without fear of contradiction that this is one of the best films I've ever seen. I loved it from start to finish. There are actually no faults I can find with this movie, it is THAT good. I recommend that anyone reading this goes and sees it. Immediately.  Back at the ranch, my mum's home from her holiday in Portugal, so I can revert to 'doing nothing about the house' mode. Which, let's face it, is my favourite way of living. If something's worth doing, somebody else will do it.  Work plods on, got my first pay through, which is always good, and also it appears that the dole office are finally paying me the last of the money they owed me. About fucking time as well.  Picked up Pro Evolution Soccer 3 for the PS2, and it's predictably fantastic. Many folks online have been complaining of stuttering, but I don't appear to be suffering from that, so go me. Although that may be because the commentary is turned off on my copy. (Well, turned off by me, since it usually sucks).  Can't really think of much else that needs saying at the moment.

      Work still goes well.  The team are all getting on really well with each other, and the trainers are still dead decent. They are equally amenable to ripping the arse out of breaks as we are, which is good. I can get away with collossal amounts of sarcasm, which is good. And the material that we're learning is easy as hell, which is good. I'm upgrading one of the team to B^2 as well.  Away from work, bought Tiger Woods 2004 for the PS2 at the weekend. It's really good, and so far it hasn't fallen into the trap of getting repetitive like most golf games do. With 20-odd courses, I don't expect it to either.  There's actually many PS2 games that I want coming out in the next no-very-long-at-all. Pro Evo 3 on Friday (I wasn't actually gonna get this straight away, but Gamestation are doing a deal where you get £15 trade in on Pro Evo 2. Which means it'll only cost £25. w00t.   Following on form that, there's Smackdown 5 in November, and also Worms 3D's out about then as well, which I'm looking forward to. Then we've got GT4 and MGS3 in the new year.  Saw Cabin Fever on Saturday night. It's been badly misadvertised, it's not the scary experience they hyped it as, I found it gory and amusing in equal measure. There's not really much tension in the movie at all. But it's still enjoyable. I'd recommend seeing it, if only for the leg-shaving scene.  Helped Steve and Kat move stuff last night, they're pretty much completely moved into their new flat, which is looking good. Was meant to be going over to IKEA with Steve to pick up some stuff, but there was someting up with the steering, so I wasn't going all the way over there. Dropped it into the garage today, and it turns out the tyres were just underinflated.   On the subject of car trouble, we passed a car that was in the middle of burning to a crisp while heading from EK to Newton Mearns. Rubbernecking ahoy.  Not much else on the go, still waiting on the bastard dole office paying my final amount that they owe me. I get a nasty suspicion that they're gonna try and screw me out of it, but I'll have that money, even if I have to resort to fraud.  Bye for now.

      Work isn't too bad so far. Trainer seems a nice enough person, atmosphere's nice and relaxed all good as yet.  Rest of the training class seems OK. 9 of us, 3 men, 6 women. 1 person never speaks, 2/6 BGW, 3/6 IIWD, and 1/6 NWABP. Most of them are friendly enough.  Away from work, was out last night for Dave's birthday, and will be out tonight for Dave's birthday. Not working tomorrow, though, so won't be leaving early tonight. Final payment from the jobcentre isn't through yet, so it's once again a sober one for me.  That's all really. There was a longer entry, but my PC crashed, which it's been doing a lot recently. Just randomly rebooting, sometimes without me even touching anything. It's 5 years old, so I think it's on its last legs. May invest in a cheap replacement soon. Don't need skynet, something that has the power to run Photochop, has a decent HD space, and a CD burner would be perfectly sufficient.

      This new job, while it is just callcentre work, appears to have the potential for serious raking in of cash. Working bank holidays gives double time, and I could even get triple time if I worked Christmas Day. For that kind of money, I'd happily skip any family dinner shenanigans.   Training proper starts tomorrow, at 9am. Which is quite early, but still, I'm finished by mid-afternoon. In the 5th week of training, I get my shifts proper given to me, and they can't be changed for 26 weeks. So I could, in theory, be starting work at 7.15am for 6 months. That'd be 6 months of getting up at 5am. Yikes!  Seen a couple of movies recently. Caught Underworld on Monday night, which was enjoyable enough. Blatant rip-off of Romeo and Juliet, but since I hate Shakespeare, I'll allow such flagrant theft. One thing that stuck in my mind was the shoes that Seline was wearing. If she's meant to be some death dealer or whatever she calls it, surely some footwear that allows her to run....well, less like a girl...would have been better. Just a thought.  Then last night, the intention was to see Battle Royale, which I still haven't ever watched. But no. The spirits gathered, and wreaked their terrifying revenge on those who wish to see movies by decreeing that the movie be sold out by the time I got there. Thus it was so.  So I went to see Bad Boys II. Probably about a half hour too long, but good enough as a 'leave your brain at the door' type movie. Some of Will smith's lines were fairly amusing as well. 2 funny moments, as one of the guys is drinking a huge (and I do mean huge) soda, and Jeff leans over and just says "That's a medium. They cost 40p." Other amusement as I'm one of probably 10 people out of 600 in the cinema who knew who the hell Dan Marino was when he made his cameo.  Other than that, not really a great deal been happening. Picked up Ring (Japanese version) on DVD. Will probably watch that soon enough, and find out if it's true that the American remake was as bad as they say. Well, not  bad  as such, just a shadow of the original's brilliance.  Pub for a while tomorrow for Dave's birthday, but Friday morning work hits any plans for major chaos over the head with a large hammer. No saturday morning work, though, so shall probably hit the town with him on Friday night, if all goes according to plan.  Right, this time I am away.....

      Friday, I worked a shift in the Scotia. Cretinous buffoon customers ahoy! Including some ned who threatened to 'deck that fat cunt'. Don't see why he should be so pissed off. I mean, it's only because I made him look like an utter idiot using only words.  Saturday, went to see House of 1000 Corpses. Was a bit incoherent in plot terms, but there were some nice set pieces, and I loved the Slim Whitman scene.  Also, picked up Soul Calibur II. Fantastic game, utterly fantastic. Working my way through weapon master mode at the moment, attempting to unlock stuff.  Vic tonight, was dead. Closed at 12, was out by twenty past. Still, 'tis money in my pocket.  Shenanigans were resolved satisfactorily. I like it when everything falls into place.   Giants lost 3-1 to the Marlins in the 1st round of the playoffs. The MARLINS?!? Hang your heads in shame, guys. That leaves the Red Sox and the Cubs as teams that I don't hate.

      Out last night for Ross' birthday. Was pretty good, some good banter from most of those gathered, and general fun abounded.  Discovered that I could lift up certain people using only my feet. Also discovered that my fingers are not meant to be bent back the wrong way, thanks to someone's attampts to do exactly that. (Looking in your direction here, Eilidh). Also, found out that certain rumours are going around about me. They're false, people.  Was watchful in case interference needed to be run, but danger was averted.   Home, slept, up. Things are looking up on the shenanigans front, had a decent natter about it, and there may be a resolution soon. As before, no side-takery for me. But much listening.

      Got that call-centre job that I went for. So I start next week. Got 5 weeks of training at part-time hours, then on to full time. It's Â£5.37 an hour, which isn't to be sneezed at, and indeed the only downer is that they didn't have any pm shifts, so I had to take morning hours. Which can mean starting as early as 7.15am. This will kill me. It will literally kill me dead.  So it's all good. I'll sign off soon enough, and I think I'm due a final payment, since it's paid in arrears. w00t.  The upshot of these early starts is that I'll no longer be able to go out 3 or 4 nights a week. Since I'll be doing 5 days from 6 (always have sunday off), it means that New Flesh every Wednesday is now not going to happen. I'll still show up if I have Thursday off, but that'll be the only time. All signs point to me selling out and going to the catty on Saturday nights....*gasp*  Fuck all else been going on in my life, that's the only thing of note that I've had in the past few days.

      Not been up to a great deal most of the week, just working and sleeping really. Went to the pub with Dave on Tuesday night, but found myself getting tired really quickly. I'm not liking these early starts AT ALL.  Work itself has been fun when I'm actually in there. Yesterday I hit my points target for the first time since I started, which means very little since I'm still getting my bonus protected for the next week at least. I then followed that up by having a really shite day points-wise today. There has at least been humour though in the ways to cut people off, and phoning them back if they hang up on you.  Also, I took a call from a guy today who sounded like Weebl. I had to try VERY hard to stop myself from laughing.  Problems afoot on the 'seeing Dream Theater' front. It looks like I won't get the Friday and the Saturday off, only one of them. So I'm going to have to take the Friday, and then travel back overnight to make it into work on the saturday. It sucks, but I am NOT missing this concert.  That all, really.

      Went to this last night. I thought it worked pretty well, there was a decent turnout from peopel I knew, as well as a fair bunch of people I hadn't seen in a while. Left just after 2am due to immense tiredness (hey, I'd been up since 5.45am)  Only a couple of minor criticisms of the night (and overall, I have to say, the Academy is a fantastic venue for a club to be held in), and that's that the upstairs dancefloor was way too small (almost to the point of non-existence), and that when a can of Irn-Bru costs £1.60, then that's simply taking the piss. Still, that meant I didn't have to spend much money, as principles and being skint kicked in.  The music on the ground floor was too loud by far, almost to the point of ears bleeding. And I managed a half decent stunner on Brian.  I'm not sure if the night would work often, but as an occasional thing, maybe quarterly, it has the potential to become quite an event.

      Not a great deal's happened since I last updated. Work still progresses, and it would appear that the team I've ended up in are a bunch of complete nutters. There is, however, plenty of good banter, much piss-ripping at the expense of customers, and there does seem to be an all round good atmosphere about the place.  On the negative side, this whole malarkey of having to get up at 5.45am is a bad, bad thing, and it feels like I can't really do anything anymore, since unless I want to be an absolute zombie the next day, then I have to go to bed about 11pm, which is stupidly early by my standards.  Got the Altnation event at the Carling Academy tomorrow night, which is shaping up to be a good one. Following that, I may be out on Sunday night at the Catty, my first Sunday there for ages. Well, 6 weeks at least.  Also picked up a ticket for A Perfect Circle in February. Got in nice and early as well, so I am now the proud owner of ticket number 11.  Time to go, I shall update after the weekend, I would suspect.

      At times, I despair about the state of people in society. More accuarately, the people who call into BT. Some crazy old woman phoned today wanting to get her rental phone fixed. A rental phone so old that it uses the old style of hardwired socket.  So she demands a new phone, for the same price as she's currently renting it for. I half expected her to say she was paying half a groat. But no, she pays £2.75 at the moment, and can't afford to pay more than that. Well, tough shit missy, because our cheapest one is £4.99. I offer to put her through to the faults department, because my screen tells me (it's good like that) that faults with residential phones go to the faults department. She isn't happy about this, but once again, tough shit missy. So she goes through to the faults department, because frankly, if you call me,  I  control what happens with the call.  I am fast developing a dislike for stupid old people, and stupid Glesga Wummen who can't even accept that there's a set procedure I have to go through to even get started on the call. The bottom line is, my job is sales. And I can't sell if someone's taking up my time with a trivial enquiry, or can't even understand a simple menu and get themselves through to the righ department. So somenoe that tries (however unwittingly) to stop me doing my job, from trying to make my targets and bonus, then they're going to get a dose of customer service, Semprini style. No-one's yet had to join club RLS, but that'll happen soon enough.

      What I'm about to type may be difficult for some people to grasp, but please bear with me, and at least try.  Now, I don't know if anyone has noticed, but it IS possible for a male and a female to be friends, and nothing more than friends.   What this means is that when a male stays overnight at the flat of a close female friend, there is no reason to assume that anything is going to happen. There is no need to react with instant suspicion. There is no need to make innuendo.  And there is no need to believe everything (or indeed anything) that you hear. For those still in doubt, feel free to ask me as to the truth of rumours about me whenever you see me or speak to me. I will be more than happy to confirm or deny them.

      So, first day on the sales floor. Was bricking it a bit prior to starting, but the first call I took was easy enough, and most of the customers were okay.   Minor irritants included other parts of BT who don't want to take the call that you're trying to transfer to them (this can be fixed by my finger 'slipping' onto the transfer button anyway), customers who can't speak English, customers who can't understand you because you're Scottish, and customers who's mobile cuts off about 30 seconds before you can finalise the sale of highly-bonused products to them.  The rest of the team seem pretty decent, and a wee bit mental at the same time. I'm ludicrously tired at the moment though, but I'm sure my body clock'll just take a bit of time to adjust.  And the manager didn't seem to have any worries about me getting the time off to go to see Dream Theater. So it's all good.

      Prior to the showing up of everyone last night, Jeff came up and we removed my E drive from the computer, for the simple reason that it was misbehaving. Although it insisted on working fine while I tried to demonstrate the fault. Wiped my old HD and put that in as an E drive for a temporary measure. Noticed also that it was getting pretty hot inside the case, so I may invest in an exhaust fan soon, just to try and keep stuff cool.  Also suggested to try and keep the heat down was replacing the 2 Hard Drives with a big fuck-off 80 - 120gig effort, thus giving it a bit more breathing space. That's a story for another time (and more money).  Off work the rest of today, it's all good.

      Usual deal last night, a few folk over to watch it, and some good banter ensued. Highlights included: - The spontaneous laughter from the group as Chris Benoit reversed a move into the Crippler Crossface. - The total surprise from us all as John Cena actually managed to lift the Big Show. - Steve Austin vs the interns. (If you were there, it was funny) - Michaels and McMahon trying to outblade each other. At least, that's what it seemed like. I was half expecting HHH to have bladed before he headed to the ring, just to prove that he is the Game-ah.  But a good show, and I'm sure there'll be similar shenanigans next month.

      So, I've finished the training part of work. It was astoundingly easy, and the poeple were cool as well. I now find myself starting out on the sales floor on Tuesday, and it remains to be seen how that goes.  Was out last night. Mucho drunkenness from me. I'd been drinking Wild Turkey after I finished work, and then I got wired into the Jack Daniels. Crashed at Eilidh's, and have only been home for an hour or so. And dear god my head hurts.

      Will probably drop by here tonight, as it's my last chance for the foreseeable future. When I start work at 9am, it's not beyond the realms of possibility to go out for a couple of hours.  When I start at 7.45, it is beyond the realms of possibility to go out and be even remotely coherent in work the next day.  So tonight will be my farewell for a while from New Flesh. Which is a shame, because aside from the fact that I'm mates with Steve, it is one of the best club nights in Glasgow, and provides a valuable alternative to the Cathouse.   I'm not stuck for good nights out though. Since I'm off every Monday from now on, Sundays at the Catty are a possibility again. But not this Sunday, it's Survivor Series. Good to have PPVs back on the agenda.

      This album arrived yesterday, and it's fantastic. It's a much heavier effort than they've done previously, but that's a good thing. Some stupidly long songs on it (only one is less than 7 minutes, 5 are over 10), but again, no complaints about that here, except perhaps that there aren't any tracks that are likely to get played in nightclubs.  Still, shit happens. I'm now even more excited about going to see them in January.

      Forgot to mention, I found out why I didn't get asked back to the Union this year.  Turns out that they did plan to ask me back apparently, but got confused and sent the letter to the wrong person. Someone who they didn't want back.  I can fully believe this, given the general management competency level there.

      In a quick 'How life goes', There's not been a tremendous amount happening.  My PC is now much upgraded, thanks to one of the most generous acts in the history of...well...my experience. It is astoundingly appreciated. So, yeah, it now works without crashing every few minutes (hence longer entries here), and is more powerful.   I have a copy of Photoshop now, but I know fuck-all about how to use it. I've spent many years using Paint Shop Pro, and it's a matter of trying to work out how everything works in a new package. So far I've resisted the temptation to go back to PSP, as that would clearly be for sellouts. Once I learn how to use Photoshop, I can only get better. Artistically, i've always been an ideas man. I know what I want to do, but don't have the talent to do it. Hence shoddy messes aplenty.  It's also got a CD burner, so my music collection will be getting distributed soon enough. Eilidh's getting schooled, and I'm gonna probably burn some Dream Theater for Steve, to save me luggin CDs into clubs. He hates CDRs though, so I'll probably end up having to force him to rip it onto his laptop.  Speaking of Dream Theater, work don't seem to have a problem with me getting the time off to see 'em in January. And my copy of the new album is in the post, apparently. w00t.  Had a funny experience last night while out at the Catty. saw someone there that I was sure I recognised, but there was just enough different about the way she looked that planted seeds of doubt in my mind. Was busy talking to people, so I didn't bother asking if it was her or not.  That's all for now, folks.

      Saw the director's cut of Alien last night.  Now I'll start straight off the bat and say that the movie is fantastic. That was never in doubt. It's one of the best sci-fi horror (Is it really horror, or just suspense? What IS horror? That's for another post, I guess) type movies that's ever been made, and I absolutely love it.  But it's the second high-profile Ridley Scott film to get a director's cut, and it got me thinking: Why do we have directors cuts? (Hereinafter referred to as DC) Is it a genuine attempt to get the proper vision if the director out to the masses? That was obviously the case with Blade Runner, although that was necessary due to the hatchet job done to it by the studio. I have no objection to DC's being used to overcome studio interference, in fact, I positively encourage it. I defy anyone to say that the DC of Blade Runner doesn't piss on the original from a high height.  But the DC of Alien is different. Well, actually, it's not, and therein lies the problem. The only noticeable scene that's added is when Ripley discovers the cocoon, and that was on the DVD version already. So in this case, it seems very much like it's simply an attempt to cash in, or indeed to raise awareness of the upcoming DVD Quadrilogy. (How can you have a quadrilogy when only 3 movies exist?)  On the note of the DVD set, it looks like I may well be investing in it, since it has the theatrical and extended versions of each movie (Fincher cut - Yay!)  But yeah, getting back to the main point, I'm becoming increasingly suspicious of DCs. But maybe I'm just getting more cynical as I age.

      Saw this today. When I went in, I was hoping - not expecting, just hoping - that the general crapness of Reloaded would be because of a necessity to set up the 3rd movie.  What I got....was not great. If I had to use one word to describe the movie, I'd say 'competent'. The action sequences, I liked, although I found myself preferring the ones in Zion over the ones that were actually in the Matrix.  The worst part of Reloaded, the philosophising, made a return, although not in such overloaded quantities. And quite a lot of the complex questions were ignored. Still, saves the Wachowski brothers from having to actually think, doesn't it?  The ending just got silly, and I found myself rooting for Smith at the end, although that's probably just me and my hatred of Keanu Reeves.  Overall, a reasonable way to pass 2 hours, but nothing earth-shattering, and certainly not eleventy billion dollars worth.

      So, another Halloween's been and gone. last nigth was actually the best fun I've had in ages on Halloween. The costume worked really well, despite the necessity of a few iterations.  I'd bought all the necessary stuff earlier in the day, so drove up to Steve & Kat's to get made up as The Terminator. It was a lot less painless than last year, and only took an hour or so. This time, also, Steve recorded it all on the digital camera, so there's no need to wait forever to view it.   It also turns out that last year's use of glue as the bottom layer was a good thing, as the scar wax was having issues with staying on my face, and it won out in the end, with falloffery in extremus. Still, the silver and blood looked good, and it worked really well with the bullet-holed sunglasses.  Headed to the catty, via Heather & Jeff's flat. Six of the Magnificent Seven were out, and the tone was set when we got there at 10.20 and saw a queue that's longer than I care for. Man, it was packed in there. Too packed. But I managed to find a few places where it wasn't too hot, and thus it wasn't too bad overall. Got my photo taken for the official site as well, and there were a fair amount of people commenting on the goodness of the costume.   Gave a few lifts home afterwards, and the spiderweb nature of the destinations meant that I didn't get to bed until 5am. Still, I don't begrudge any of them, they're my friends and I'll drive them home rather than leave them to run the gauntlet of the city centre.  That's about it so far.

      It's Decemebr 31st 2003, 8.20pm. I sit here, alone in the house, and pissed off. I've been relatively healthy for ages, and now my sinuses have gone and gotten themselves blocked up again. The EXACT same thing that happened last year at this time. So while everyone else is out having fun and such like, I'm stuck at home, too ill to go anywhere. It's annoying, since my plan was to go to Heather's flat, where there's a party happening, but despite pumping myself full of pills and medicine all afternoon, I don't feel any better.  Still, since I'm here, I may as well look back on 2003. What sort of a year has it been? Well, it's been a year of peaks and troughs. The highs have been stratospheric, and the lows have been Rock Bottom (ROCK BOTTOM! ROCK BOTTOM! ROCK BOTTOM! THE PEOPLE'S CHAMP IS ON FIRE!)  I dated Eilidh for a while, and while I was gutted when it didn't work out (and I mean gutted. It hit me a lot harder than I ever let on at the time), we are now fantastically close friends, I can't imagine life without her, she's one of the nicest people anyone could ever hope to meet. So I'd class that as one of the positives of the year.  I graduated from University, having got a 2:2 degree in Politics. I then promptly failed to get a job that related in any way to the subject I'd just spent four years studying. After a few months of working in bars (and scamming the dole office at the same time), I got my current job, working at BT. I don't expect to keep it for too long in the grand scheme of things, I've spoken to people who say it becomes soul-destroying after a while.  2 of my closest friends had a kid. Congratulations to Steve and Kat, it's really cool, but at the same time somewhat scary as you realise that life does go on, and you find yourself in a position of having to take responsibility for your life. I may not say this publically very often, but I do have the utmost respect for the pair of them, there's no way in hell I could do what they have, I simply do not have the patience for it.  Another really close friend left the country. He certainly seems to be happier there than he was here, and more power to him for it. He was always a good source of advice, and I'll miss the random movie-going. He's geekified me more than anyone else this year. And I'll head out for a visit once I get a decent level of cash together.  Overall, I'd say it's been a not bad year. The goods have outweighed the bads, and I'm glad that what's happened has. Mostly.  What of 2004 then? It's a tough one to call. The only thing major plan I've got is the Vegas trip, the rest is somewhat up in the air. As for New Year's resolutions, this year I aim to lose a bit of weight, and I'm also giving up alcohol completely. I decided I'd rather not more money than is necessary, only to end up making an arse of myself and not being able to remember it the next day. I can have plenty of fun while sober. A bit more sex wouldn't go amiss this year, either. :)

      I was going to write here about how good Requiem for a Dream was. To keep it short: A fantastic film, very depressing though. Only bit I didn't like was the bit where she and the host leave the TV. Lost the realism from the movie a wee bit, I thought.  But that's all you're getting about RfaD. Because I got a disturning IM about 5 minutes ago. One that told me about the plans of Hollywood at the moment. They're remaking Dark Water.  Were they not content to make such a hatchet job of Ring? Must they destroy another movie that I love? Is it beyond the realms of possibility for them to, just once, LEAVE THE FUCK ALONE? What was wrong with it the way it was? Nothing that Hollywood can fix anyway, that's for sure.  Japanese horror movies are a breed of their own, they have that quality that's so hard to get right, they have atmosphere. Hollywood will ruin this, guaranteed, and I am so fucking raging about it that it's untrue.  Damn you Hollywood. Damn you straight to hell.

      Today, picked up Twin Peaks season 1, The Perfect Storm (only £5), and Requiem for a Dream.  I'm fast running out of space for these things. And the Alien Quadrilogy's still to arrive.   Ah well, never mind.

      Was out last night for Eilidh's birthday. And there was drunkenness. Oh dear god there was drunkenness.  Hit the Lab at about 9pm, and a nasty moment as I'm stopped at the door and asked who I'm with tonight. Got around that by explaining (truthfully, for once) that a bunch of us were meeting, and I'm the only one with even a semblance of punctuality. Get inside easily enough though, and discover that it's really rather busy. It quietened down as the night went on, so it wasn't all bad. Good banter, and several lunatics were in the building. Luckily, they were all part of our party.  Moved on to the Cathouse, and silliness abounds again, although I start to feel the onset of queasiness in my stomach. Yes folks, it's Cathouse Coke kicking in again! A quick tactical vomit, and a switch to lemonade as mixer, and everything is all good. Left about a half hour early because I was too tired and drunk for my own good, and went for food, where it would appear that Eats1 can rival riginals for chips n cheese. Bit more expensive, but also a bigger portion, so that's fine.  Woke up this morning astoundingly hungover. Bah. But it was a good night, so I'll take the hit.

      Went into town this afternoon, primarily to return one of the buggiest pieces of software I've ever owned (Worms 3D, for those that care), and it was the busiest I've ever seen it. Too busy.  Didn't buy anything, and left speedily before I committed mass murder. I'll go and see if I buy anything on Monday or Tuesday, failing that I'll end up buying stuff online.  Eilidh's birthday today, much honour to abound this evening.

      Not been a bad day, all in. Got woken up at 3am by my sister crashing though the door, drunk as hell.  Woke up again at 10am, and told my mum with 30 minutes notice that I wouldn't be going to the family church service, mainly due to my hatred of religion in all its forms, and the fact that I don't believe in god. She took it OK though, so that was good. My sister seemed more disapproving, but her opinion counts fuck all to me.  Decent enough haul of presents, mostly cash and vouchers since I'm really picky and almost impossible to buy for. Basically, if I haven't outright said I want it, then buying something for me is a risk. So this state of affairs suits me fine.  Relatives were tolerable today, but things got a bit frosty when I cracked out the Michael Jackson jokes. Fuck their attitudes though, the guy's a [insult removed for libel reasons, just in case].   The meal was OK, but my mum forgot to cook the roast potatoes (!), and the turkey was overly dry. I've had worse though.  Other than that, it's been the same as every other year. Tired as fuck now, going for a lie down soon.

      ...ly shit I'm bored at the moment.  It's 11.05pm local time, and I'm alone in the house. My sister's out with her boyfriend tonight, my mum activated heathen mode and trundled off to church for the watchnight service.   Really, though, what's that watchnight service all about? - Right folks, that's midnight, Jesus was born loads of years ago today, ignoring the fact that even if Jesus existed (and I'm sceptical at best), they've not taken account of the time difference between here and the middle east, and also science has supposedly proven that the birth was meant to have happened in March.  I know science has made plenty of mistakes in the past, but I still trust it more than a book that some crazy religious nut-jobs wrote 2000-odd years ago and used as a method of trying to brainwash others into joining their cult.  The family'll be over tomorrow for dinner, and I give it less than an hour before I get sick of them and want them all to leave. Not only that, they're bringing that stupid fucking dog of theirs. I just KNOW they're gonna try and get us to watch shit Christmas day television, but that'll happen over my dead body.  I'm just somewhat thankful that I don't have to do anything difficult in the preparation. Hell, I don't have to do anything at all.  Well, typing this out's killed 10 minutes or so.

      Well, not hell as such, more BT.   Got sent home early today (one of only 2 people in the centre to get away like this) because, to put it bluntly, no-one was phoning in. And those that were soon found themselves getting hung up on most speedily. Not by me, I hasten to add. Ahem.  That's me now off until Hogmanay, which is a nice break.

      Caught this on DVD last night at Steve's. Started off quite humorous, but took a more serious turn as the movie went on. Certainly not what I was expecting the film to be, but not necessarily the worse for it.  I did like the cinematography, the desert environment was well-handled, and some of the sound for bullets whizzing past was well done as well.  Usual moralising tone present for most of the movie, which brings it down a notch or two. A good movie, but not one I'd buy.

      In work the other day, GTX crashed. For the uninitiated, GTX is the program that controls the people who dial in, amongst other things.  This meant that we had to use manual login, which is a good thing. Because when GTX goes down, no-one can tell how long anyone is online, how long we take between calls, and most importantly, the system that records all the calls. So we can do whatever the hell we like. Cheek to the customers? Check. Sarcasm and arrogance? Check. Laziness and general arseing around? Check.  Got in this morning, and GTX was working. Bah! The tech dudes had said it would be Monday before it was back. So I had to actually monitor my skiving.

      Hell. Motherfucking. Yeah.  Saw this today. Easily the best film of the year, and very possibly one of the best of all time. I was very impressed with 99% of the movie (the other 1% being the stuttering sound for a while in the middle, but that's probably just this cinema).  Particular favourite bits being the battle, notably the charge of the Rohirrim, and the journey through the paths of the dead. 2 Wilhelms that I noticed, as well.  Now, admittedly, Peter Jackson had a work of genius start with, but he could easily have screwed it up, and yet he didn't, not at all. Message to the Wachowskis: THAT is how to do a trilogy properly.

      Meant to say earlier, at the movies, there was an advert at the beginning linking movie piracy with organised crime ("which lessens the chance of movies being made"), and terrorism ("which disrupts our society").  What the fuck you mongo?  That's clutching at straws of the highest order. It's patently obvious that the Hollywood powers-that-be don't like pirates (unless they're Johnny Depp), but to resort to such despicable scaremongering (and make no mistake about it, it is despicable) defies belief. What's next? Linking movie piracy to paedophilia? "If you watch pirate movies, you're contributing to kids getting fucked in the ass".  Of course, if they delivered a decent product at a reasonable price, then there wouldn't be anything to worry about. But let's not hold our breath for that happening.

      It would appear that the Americans have finally captured him.  Watching the coverage on TV at the moment. The press conference smacked of triumphalism from the US, and in particular the hooping and hollering was a bit over the top.  Tony Blair's said that he wants Saddam to be tried in Iraq by the Iraqis. So, some questions about that: Will Bush agree? (No) Will Saddam get a fair trial? (Of course. I hope you're not suggesting that Blair and Bush would pack the jury with people who could be relied upon to deliver the 'correct' verdict) What if he gets found not guilty? (I don't think we need to worry about that happening) Have any weapons of mass destruction been found yet? (Erm....) Wasn't that why this war was started in the first place, to find WMDs? (Shut up) Do you think they'll ever be found? (Lalala I'm not listening)  The war was still morally and legally wrong from the very start though.

      Finally got around to seeing this, and overall, I'd say it was worth it.  The battle scenes at sea were well done, particularly the effect of splintering wood as a cannonball flies in at great velocity. The claustrophobia of the ship was captured well on film, and even Russell Crowe gave a performance that I didn't hate.  My one main criticism is that we aren't properly introduced to many of the ship's crew, to the extent that it was hard to feel any sympathy when generic crewman #78 kicked the bucket. maybe that was the intention all along, although I somewhat doubt it.  A good way to pass 2 and a bit hours though, certainly worth seeing.

      Bunch of cunts.  They're apparently not showing either of the next 2 Pay-Per-Views. I want my wrestling, dammit! The Wrestling Channel's not even going to be on ntl, and now this happens.  I wonder if they realise quite how many people only have Sky subscriptions for the wrestling. This could come back and bite them.  I know what they're up to, though. If they deprive us of this, then they're hoping there'll be a huge demand of relieved people when they try and launch more wrestling on Pay-Per-View.  Bastards.

      This evening, I watched Celtic attempt to qualify from their Champions League group.  We sucked, pure and simple. Beaten 3-2 on the night, we finish 3rd in the group, and go on to the 'consolation' of the UEFA cup.  You wouldn't think it would be a difficult message to pass on to your team: Don't handle the ball in your own penalty box. If only someone had told Bobo Balde.  That's been the only thing even resembling excitement that's happened this week.

      It's times like this I hate Glasgow.  I was out last night, and I took the car. Glad I did, because oh dear god it was COLD. It MUST have been well below freezing, and even in the 30 yards or so from the car to the door of the Cathouse, I was absolutely frozen. It didn't help that there was queue to get in. Literally ran to get back to the car after leaving at 3am.  I don't mind the weather in Glasgow, 99% of the time. It's not too hot in the summer, and generally pleasant most of the rest of the year. The problem arises when we get a cold snap, much like is happeneing at the moment, because the temperature plummets. And given my habit for wearing t-shirts 11 months of the year, that causes coldness. I should at least be thankful that it's not raining at the moment as well.  It's not so bad in the grand scheme of things, but there are moments that it annoys me. Bah.

      Was up at Steve's last night. An...interesting bus journey home.  Me & Heather leave at 11.20 or so. Wait for 16 or 18 bus as the stop's near to Steve's, plan being to get bus to EK town centre where I can get a 66 (66 stop being about a mile form the flat) None appear. Walk down to catch 66. None appear.  16 appears, we jump on. It's going the wrong way. Never mind, we'll just head back into Glasgow when it turns round. But it's not doing that, oh hell no, it's stopping and going back to the depot. Driver raises himself to godlike status by giving us a lift into city centre before he heads depot-wards, and I get a 66 home from there. Which was full of neds. Finally get to bed at 1.50am.   Overall, was a good night. My pizza was a bit too charred to a crisp for my liking, but that was nothing more than a minor downer.   Done fuck all today though.

      Didn't get on the web at all yesterday. Logged in today, and I had 346 new email messages. 4 of which were not spam.  Anyone know a good way of stopping them? I've got the filters active on Eudora, but they still download the messages to the junk folder, and they're not 100% accurate, so I still have to check that a genuine massage hasn't been junked by mistake.

      For the past day or so, my phone's been messing around.  When I've been near a speaker, tehre's been the sound of interference that signifies a text trying to get through, but it never gets there.  So if you've got something important to say, then a call is probably the best way of making sure the message gets through.

      Work today, amusement ahoy. "Good morning, thanks for calling BT, my name's Gordon, can I..." "Get me your supervisor" *goes to get supervisor* "Sorry, she's on a call at the moment, but she'll be with you as soon as possible." "Right, complaints department then." "Okay, I'll just put you through to customer services, they deal with that sort of..." "None of you lot listen, I want the complaints department" [Note: Customer Services deal with complaints] "As I said, it's customer services that deal with..." "You're all as bad as each other, none of you scumbags care!" "If you'll just give me a chance, then I'll put you through to the people who can..." "FUCKING SCUMBAGS, THE LOT OF..." *click*  Silly man. When I can terminate the call with one button, he should have known better than to be abusive to me. BT's official policy is '3 strikes and you're out', which means on the 3rd instance of abusive language, we can terminate the call. My policy is 'one strike and you're out', which kicked in here. So he was gone, and probably ended up in an even bigger rage.  It raised a point when he said 'None of you scumbags care', though. It was at this point that I decided the call would be ended by my hand, and it was only a matter of deciding when. I thought about it a bit later, and realised that none of us DO care. My customer care skills are zero, for the simple fact that I don't care about the customers, and I'm fast developing a barrier to keep out the emotive language that people try and use.  "It's for my mother, she's 94 and has terrible asthma." Well, that's great, but I still can't make the appointment any earlier. The bottom line is that as long as it's not my fault, I get paid no matter how fucked peoples phones are.  Now this may seem like a callous attitude to have, and to an extent I suppose it is, but the fact remains that I don't get paid enough to actually give a damn.  So next time you phone a callcentre, just remember that any sincerity is more than likely as fake as Michael Jackson's face.

      Went to the Catty last night for the first time on a Sunday in almost 2 months.  It was a good night, some top-quality banter from many of the gathered throng. Didn't dance much, but when I did, I actually seemed to have some tiny semblance of rhythm, which surprised even me. Evens that it won't be repeated though.  Got home just before 4, and some cretin had parked across the turning circle at the top of the street, so not only did I have to reverse back down, I also had to walk to the house in the cold. And dear god it was fucking freezing. Which I suppose is to be expected, what with it being Scotland in novemebr, but it's still not pleasant.

      Out for a meal last night for Kat's birthday, and it was my first time having Sushi. The verdict? Not bad, but I don't really think it's my scene. The restaurant was nice, and I like the idea of the conveyor belt for food and such like, but the fact remains above all else that....it's still raw fish.  For those of us who like our seafood a little more cooked, there were also pieces of chicken  and noodles on the belt, and they were pretty good.  Bottom line is that it'll probably be a one-off experience for me, but it's still good to try new things once in a while. And as usual, an all-you-can-eat buffet turned into a competition between me & Scapegoat. Also as usual, it ended an honourable draw.  I'm still pretty shite at using chopsticks though.

      Got my bonus for December in my wages today....£150 or thereabouts. Not too shabby.  Still hate the place, but money is always pleasant.  Oscar nominations out this week, and only a few points of note. RotK HAS to win best picture, or all hell will break loose. Nice to see Johnny Depp getting a nomination for Pirates, but I think they'll give best actor to Sean Penn for Mystic River. Which I couldn't really complain about, he was good in it.  And why no Serkis? Hmmmph.

      Had a strange thought in work today. Despite the constant pressure on targets and such like, we are always told to 'sell to the customers needs'. In theory, this would be fine, if we didn't have the sales targets. Customer calls in, we find out what's best for them, and sell them that.  But it's not like that. Because we get told that we have to sell all these products, and they give us various amounts of points towards our bonusplan. This raises an interesting quandary, ably demonstrated by an example customer from this afternoon.  He doesn't speak great English, but enough that we can understand each other, and certainly enough that I don't want to slam the receiver down in a fit of rage. I do the check to see which option he'd be best on. As it happens, it's the one that gives me the most bonus So I go on to explain how it works, and he agrees. But I could tell that he wasn't listening, and that he didn't really understand what he was buying.  Now, on this occasion, I had no problems with this, because this particular option WAS the best for him. But on other occasions, it'd be perfectly possible to sell someone something they don't need or want, purely taking advantage of the fact that they can't understand properly what it is they're signing themselves up for.  This musing is of no real consequence, I suppose, since in the grand scheme of things I'm going to get the best possible deal for myself, and I'm not about to reduce my pay, or get myself warned for performance reasons, just so someone gets the best possible deal.  But it's worth a few moments thought.

      My god I'm feeling down at the moment.   Back to work tomorrow after 3 days off, and this time I'm in for 5 days straight. I know it doesn't seem like much, but when the job's as soul-destroying as mine is, then starting on tuesday and knowing that your next time off is on Sunday, then it depresses the hell outta you.  That, and the fact that I have to be up before the sun's even set (that's an exaggeration).  Time to start looking for another job, methinks, before I go insane. They do say it's easier to get a job if you already have one. One that is NOT customer-facing.

      Bunch of us out last night for Eilidh's farewell night out.   Went to Wagamama or whatever it's called in West George Street. Seemed like a nice place, and indeed, we all enjoyed ourselves. At the time. The atmosphere was good, and it was nice and airy.  Moved on to The Lab, and everything seemed to be going fine....until I started to feel sick. One vomit later, and I'm feeling decidedly less than pleasant. The second vomit later on came after me running ("Faster than I've ever seen before"-Dave) to the toilet. General analysis of the symptoms suggests that there may well have been nut traces in the food.   Wasn't feeling well enough for the Cathouse, so I just went home to bed. Seems like a bit of an anticlimax for Eilidh's big final night, but it really couldn't be helped. I am actually gonna miss her more than words can say, she's been a really fantastic friend to me over the past 18 months or so. She deserves the best of everything, and I hope with all my heart that she has a great time in the US.  Now, to go and see if I can get my stomach to settle down enough for breakfast.

      I'm getting a bit fed up with all the nonsense at work.   They're continually fucking about with our bonus plan, to the extent that if I'd got the same sales when I staretd 9 weeks ago that I'm getting now, I'd be earning close to 3 times the bonus. It's goalpost-shifting of the highest order, and it's not fun.  Also driving me utterly insane are the run rates. Basically, BT expect us to sell x amount of each product per 100 calls. Which is fine and achieveable. Normally. But their call routing is mince, truly mince. So we get shitloads of calls from people who want to complain about their bill, or to find the number for directory enquiries, or who simply can't work a push button system. Worst is people who have a problem with their internet account, and don't want to pay 50p per minute. So they call the free line on 150, and then get pissed off when we won't transfer them.   It's difficult to sell x amount of products per 100 calls when about 30 of those calls are simply impossible to sell on.   It also doesn't help that the manager is incompetent. Now a good manager would spot when a team member isn't hitting their targets and help them improve. This one takes the approach of "Get it sorted. I don't care, just get it sorted." Well worth the money there.  Still, a prominent MP called in today to complain that his line wasn't working, and to ask why. Probably because you haven't paid your bill. Alas, confidentiality forbids me from telling anyone who it was. Although if someone were to guess right, saying yes wouldn't be against the rules, i don't think. Hypothetically speaking, of course.

      Was out last night at the Catty, was somewhat of a weird night.  Not very many folk out, which meant at least that musically, there was a lot more variety. And the whole night went by with absolutely no nu-metal at all. Which is always nice for a change.  Nothing of any great note happened overall, and the whole night seemed somewhat subdued.  Still, bag it and bin it, and move on.  Next Sunday should be a good one, it's Eilidh's farewell night out.

      Dream Theater are not one of the most well-known bands around. Taking up residence at the heavier end of the prog spectrum, they have a reputation for tremendous musicianship, and long songs (many over 10 minutes) that contain more separate parts than Jeffrey Dahmer's fridge. Many are put off by this, and correspondingly, the band have enjoyed only modest success in the UK.  This, of course, matters not one jot to the 2700 people in the Manchester Apollo to see them. We know what they're like, and we love them for it. Dream Theater have a fanbase that many other bands would kill for in terms of their unceasing devotion to the band.  It's an all-seated gig tonight, which is probably for the best. It's not the sort of concert that you'd headbang or pit to, it's the sort where you watch and appreciate. The Apollo is a fine venue, with a floor area with removable seating, and also a 1300 capacity balcony. I was up there, and it gives a good view of proceedings. The acoustics were never less than perfect, and if every venue was like this, the world would be a much better place.  House light down, and we're ready to rumble. The big screen shows a series of highlights from the band's career, starting with the beginnings as Majesty in 1985, through to the present day. And then we launch into opener 'As I Am'.  The first thing that strikes you about the concert is the production quality. The sound is spot on, and the mix is perfect. Often at concerts, the vocals are too low to begin with, and take a few songs to get sorted. Not here.  Also noticeable is vocalist James LaBrie's attitude. I'm loathe to say he 'knows his place', but it is certainly worth pointing out that when there's an extended solo or section of the song with no vocals, he leaves the stage to allow the other four members to get all the attention. Quite a refresing change from some bands and their affliction known as 'Lead Singer Disease'.  As the band proceed through latest album 'Train of Thought', which is played in its entirety, it becomes obvious that they're tighter than a 12 year old's....actually, it's best not to use that analogy. Let's just say that they are VERY tight. It's almost telepathic the way they all know exactly what each other are playing and when.  And so after 70 minutes, the band leave the stage, and the houselights go up. At most concerts and with most bands, this is a case of 'thanks for coming, safe home now'. Nut not tonight, and not this band. it's only the intermission, and there's more to come.  After the band returns, they start on their older material, and John Myung breaks out the 12-string. At this point it should be noted that John Myung is the bassist, and yes, he's playing a 12 string bass. Flawlessly. The bass itself looks like a large sword, the sort you'd expect the hero to wield in a Final Fantasy game.   Of the other band members instruments, Jordan Rudess' keyboard has a touch screen control panel of such a size that I remain convinced that every time he changed a setting, the Starship Enterprise veered sharply off course, and Mike Portnoy's drumkit was the largest I've ever seen, with three bass drums. John Petrucci had an array of guitars, including a 12 string of his own (twin neck, natch).   Also, a comment on James LaBrie's voice. It's not often I can say this, but he was giving an absolutely flawless performance, and with god as my witness I mean FLAWLESS. Perfect reproductions of every note from the albums, as indeed we got from every member.  The setlist for the second set was not exactly what I expected, but not any the worse for it. Another thing that sets this band apart from others is that they keep a note of the setlist from the last time they played each town, and make sure you get different songs. Just a little touch, but one that makes for a better experience overall. there were some songs missed out that I'd have liked to have heard, but if they'd played everything I'd wanted to hear, we'd probably still be there.  Almost without realising the time, the band are playing 'Learning to Live', and it's the end of the concert. They've been onstage for just short of 3 hours, and everyone's going home happy.    Setlist: As I Am This Dying Soul Endless Sacrifice Honor Thy Father Vacant Stream of Consciousness In The Name of God  -- BREAK --  New Millenium Under A Glass Moon Through My Words Fatal Tragedy The Mirror Hollow Years War Inside My Head The Test That Stumped Them All Goodnight Kiss Solitary Shell Pull Me Under  -------------  Learning To Live   The bottom line: This show was everything that I hoped it would be, and more. While the music may not be to everyone's taste, those who do like it can rest assured that attending a Dream Theater concert will give you total satisfaction, and astounding value for money. Highest possible recommendation.

      Amusing bus journey to and from Manchester. As I was getting on at Glasgow, a guy was being refused entry to the bus for being too drunk. AT HALF TEN IN THE MORNING.  Then another drunk guy on the journey home started getting aggressive at Glasgow because he thought the bus was going to Newcastle. He demanded that the driver take him there, and was promptly and correctly told to fuck right off.  Of Manchester itself, I got off the bus and discovered that the city centre there is actually the coldest place in the world. None of yer Antarctica pish, it was here. Cold as hell, with a biting wind from all directions. Wasn't there long enough to see much of the city, but it seems pretty similar to most city centres, although it does have a tram system of sorts (the metrolink, I think it's called).  Got some sleep on the bus home, but not much. mainly because some god-damn bitch ass motherfucking idiot was playing some games on their fucking phone the whole way. Didn't help that there was a kid crying down the front either. But apprently it was part of the party meant to be going to Newcastle, so it got its comeuppance.

      The Ric Flair DVD set arrived yesterday.   Watching it, I'm reminded of an age gone by. An age when the wrestlers actually knew how to wrestle. They had technial training. They knew how to work a match. They were experts in psychology. They were well aware of how to get the fans into their match. They thought nothing of wrestling for over half an hour every night. They were people who looked like you or me. With a bit of work in the gym, you too could get a start in wrestling.  Fast forward to now. The norm is people who are well over 6 feet tall, and 250 - 300lbs heavy (now I'm about 250, but not in a healthy, actually has muscles, sort of a way). Most have next to no actual wrestling ability, instead knowing a few big moves and separating them with punchy kicky shit. With a few exceptions, they can't go more than 10-15 minutes without becoming blown up. 1 hour matches are rare to the point of almost being in museums.  The only way to break into wrestling's top echelon (and by this I mean the WWE) is for the average man in the street to grow 6 inches, or hit the steroids big time (no, HHH, I'm not talking about you. I fully believe that you got that physique from hours of painstaking work in the gym.)  The blame for all this lies on many fronts. My main beef is with the fans of wrestling these days. They've watched the decline of wrestling. They've seen McMahon's army of roidfreaks take over the sport. They've fallen for the catchphrases and the comedy skits.  They've become pavlovian in their repsonses, chanting back towards the ring whenever The Rock or whoever feeds them the set up line.  They've been conditioned to accept a 3 minute match on Raw as a legitimate contest, and as such, whenever someone does try to have a proper technical match, it's dismissed as boring because there isn't spot after spot after spot. Only if the participants are already legitimate main-eventers is the match accepted. The 'sports entertainers' have taken over, and I don't like it. It's partly because of people being determined to keep their place on the top of the card, when it's obvious to all concerned that they should have retired long ago. So they have a match with the young upstart, bury him, then claim that as proof that he can't draw money and should drop back down a level.  Sometimes I worry for the future. I needn't be overly worried, I'm sure. There'll always be quality wrestling available. It may just be a bit harder to find. Meanwhile, the big leagues will evolve into another iteration of what the power men think wrestling should be. And the fans will follow like the sheep they are.   On a slightly less depressing note, there are some promotions (Ring of Honor springs to mind) that are trying to turn the tide. But they draw 400 people to an event, and the WWE draws 12000. So it's a while to wait.  Also, the Flair DVD, need I say it, is off the charts brilliant. Buy it. Now. All of you.

      Watched this last night while up at Steve's. Wasn't really sure what to expect, aside from the fact that it was Japanese, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It's quite clearly one of the most blatantly violent movies in the history of my movie-watching antics, and the blood count must venture into the realms of many, many gallons. Having said that, it's not just a gore-fest, there are a few amusing moments in it. Well, to be more accurate, it's full of amusing momenst, but they probably won't all be quite as amusing to someone who doesn't have a sense of humour as sick as mine.  One touch I did like was Kakihara's mouth. They just don't make humans like that anymore.  The ending got a bit confusing though. We think we worked out mostly what had  happened, but those crazy Japs                                                                                                                                                                          never seem to be quite capable of telling a simple story in a simple manner.  And I want a pair of those boots.

      Just a general update, nothing much has been going on recently.  The Royal Rumble will be shown in the UK after all, but not on Sky, it'll be on Setanta. ntl do carry this channel, but I still won't get to see it, since it's on the 25th, and that's Eilidh's farewell night out before she heads Stateside for 3 months.  Work remains the same as always, mind-numbing, and full of utter morons calling in, but it still pays well (ish). Also got my time off next Friday confirmed, so Dream Theater is go. I'll no doubt write a lengthy rant about the greatness of that concert here next week.  It would appear also that my Best of Ric Flair DVD has been posted, so that'll be pretty damn good when it shown up. Combined with the Shawn Michaeks and cage Matches DVDs, it looks like the WWE has finally figured out how to give fans the value for money they expect, each of these packages are fantastic. There's also the Mick Foley set to come out later in the year, and rumours of a 3 disc best of Bret Hart. So that's good.  Was out for a wee bit last night with Dave and Heather, and it became painfully obvious that there are next to no good pubs on the southside, and the ones that are passable are either too busy to even get close to the bar, or have brought in a shit dj to get the fat old slags dancing on a Friday night (I mean, seriously, who dances in a pub?)  Update more when more's happened, natch.

      Got a letter this morning from the Inland Revenue.  It would appear that according to their calculations, I didn't earn enough in tax year 2001-2002, and thus unless I fork out £21, that year won't count as contributing to my state pension.  As a matter of principle, I'm not going to pay it, for the simple reason that given current trends, I don't expect there'll BE a state pension by the time I hit retirement age. Once I get a permanent and secure (well, secure-ish) proper job, I plan to geta private pension, since that's the only way I expect there'll be cash coming in post work-stoppery.  But still, bastard government. And bastard Union for not giving me enough hours.

      I have discovered a new subspecies of humans.  No, really, it's true. They seem like most humans, and to the untrained eye they are regular humans. They have a good grasp of whatever language you wish to speak to them in. Their pronunciation is good. You start to talk, and there's no outward sign of badness approaching.  But they have an affliction. Whenever they speak, they talk rubbish. Unintelligible rubbish. They make you think "I know all of those words, but in that order they make no sense"  Their common behavuioural pattern is to telephone my work. Anyone fancy a cull?

      Well, for the moment, the problem with the errors appears to have been fixed somewhat. Thanks to the age old trick of 'throwing out requests on a forum and hoping I get an answer', I altered the proxy server I connect through, and that appears to have solved the problem.  It was frustrating though, as while I would never class myself as an expert on computers, I do like to think that I'm fairly PC literate. I don't even mind if somethings wrong and I know that I have to do A, B, and C to fix it, but don't have the knowledge. It's when I don't even know what the problem is that I get frustrated, as there's not even a starting point.  Still, it's fixed now, so that's not too bad.  Borrowed Stone Cold Steve Austin's autobiography from Kat last night, and read it this morning. Quite quick and easy to read, but it's one of the more blatantly ghostwritten books from wrestlers, very obviously pasted together from transcripts of interviews. He has some interesting points about his career, but he never gets near the level of detail or reflection that Mick Foley did, and that hurts it. It's like autobiography-lite, if you will. An enjoyable enough way to pass a few hours, but not deep enough for the true wrestling geeks. I do agree almost entirely with the ideas he has to improve the state of wrestling today though, a return to the old school.   Finally, I really should get on with arranging the deferment of these student loan repayments. It doesn't feel like a year since I last told them to fuck off (in a manner of speaking, and through official channels, obv), but needs must, and I'll get the form filled in, it's just a case of finding my payslips from the past few months. Once I get more cash together, I might see about just paying it all off in one go, as opposed to the '5 years of paying' crap that they seem to be wanting.

      Until I get the problem with posting things fixed, it's gonna have to be many small updates as opposed to one big one.  Ate dinner at Ichiban last night, and managed to avoid a repeat of previous Japanese restaurant shenanigans, so the food stayed down. This is always a bonus. I can't remember the name of what it was that I ate, but there was (pigeon?) beef in it, so if you're there, I can recommend a portion of No.26. I'm actually developing a bit of a taste for Japanese food, and I can foresee a sushi-fest occurring in the not-too-distant future.

      As regards the complaint at work mentioned in a previous entry, it's basically a case of a guy being angry at the cost of his bill, and during the call he took exception to the tone of my voice, which is the same tone of voice that I use when talkign to anyone, nay everyone on this planet.  He threw a MAJOR hissy fit about it all, including a scream (literally) that "I'M BRITISH!", which led me to conclude racism (or Xenophobia at the very least), unless anyone can offer me a legitimate reason as to why he would mention his nationality.  Upshot of it all is that he's going to file a complaint, but I've done nothing wrong, so I'm not overly concerned. I'm actually supposed to be in work at the moment, but I called in sick.

      Was out last night, and hot damn if it wasn't one of the best nights out I've had in ages.  It was almost like the Sunday nights of old. There was banter in extremus, general stupidity, none of the issues or hostility that can sometimes creep in, and no-one was so drunk that it affected the night adversely.  Highlights included the barbershop quartet / fat sandwich combo, removing layers of skin from Faeries (which WAS an accident, honestly), grand theft auto (not the video game), energizer bunny dancing, and a total lack of tact from almost everyone.  Good night.

      Spent most of this weekend tinkering with my PC.  Well, not the hardware, since that's just an accident waiting to happen with me. But some software tweakery abounds, and everything appears to be working a bit better, which naturally makes me a happy person. Browser is now Firefox 0.8 (must products keep changing their names?) and I have a method of playing Real media that isn't bloated to whale proportions like the official realplayer is. Minor mucking about means that (fuck knows HOW) Zone Alarm and AdAware also work, which is a first for me.  Other than that, not been up to much. There's a rant building up on a previous employer, but I'll sit on that one for a wee bit, best to wait until everything is clearer, and nothing I say will have any possible recriminations.   Staying in tonight as well. Had considered bedlam, but not really up for it. I know it's something that I should probably go to one of these days, trying new things and all, but tonight will not be that night.

      ...staying in.  Not going out tonight, when it all came down to it, I was too tired to do anything other than veg out in front of the TV / computer. Now granted, I'll probably keep doing that until some ludicrous hour of the morning, but at least when I do this, I'm only 3 feet away from my bed, and the associated slumber of goodness, whereas if I'd gone out, it'd be somewhat of an effort to get home once true tiredness kicked in.  I'm finding that I'm doing that a lot recently. I don't go out anywhere near as much as I used to, and while this is to be expected due to the oft-mentioned 5.45am starts to get ready for work, it gets irritating when your sleep pattern is affected on the days when you're off. And then by the time you've got sorted into the sleep pattern you want, it's the beginning of the week again, and you're back to stupid o'clock starts.  There's so much about this job that I hate, honestly.

      Heard some good news today, an old friend is getting married soon. She emailed me this afternoon to tell me, and while I was shocked to hear it, I'm really happy for her, despite the inherent cliche of Valentine's day proposals.  In all seriousness, this is great news, she was a fantastic friend to me before she moved abroad, and was always there for advice, and more often than not, she saved me from total embarrassment by guiding me away from routes best not taken. There will always be a place in my heart for her, and I truly believe that she is one of life's good ones. She deserves nothing but the best, and by all accounts she's found it.  I raise my glass to thee (metaphorically speaking, since I'm not holding a glass at the moment). Congratulations!

      A quiet one last night, as in a fantastically old-school evening, it was only Dave who made it up for the wrestling.  This matters not one bit, as an evening of banter ensues. I was more tired than is usually desirable, so I can't remember everything, but the quote of the night does go to Dave, with "I liked Chuck better when he was gay". Ambiguous comments a go-go.  Pay-Per-View itself was pretty much what I expected, with an undercard of pure filler, a cruiserweight match that they gave 15 minutes or so to (gasp!), and the big 2 matches delivering what was necessary. And Eddie Guerrero is the WWE champion. I never thought I'd find myself saying those words, but it's true, and he's facing Kurt Angle at Wrestlemania. Finally, after years and years, they give him the recognition he deserves.  I am happy, despite the continuing lack of coffee.

      Took a 5 minute break at 9am in work this morning. There was one reason and one reason only for this.  Logged straight onto Ticketmaster, and started trying to buy tickets for the WWE in Glasgow. Got there at 9.00 and 30 seconds, and the top-price tickets are already sold out. Choose 'best available' and get some of the £30 tickets. Well, 4 of them. Just as well I did that then, as had I waited until 9.30 and my proper break, ticketmaster would have been sold out, and the other sites selling them had server overload.  Got home, and looked at the confirmation email, and it appears that the £30 tickets are floor level, so the tiered seating was obviously sold out as well. Fuck, those things go quickly. Still, I'm going to see the WWE live, so all is good.  My only gripe is that when Raw came over, Jericho was on Smackdown, and now Smackdown's here, and Jericho's on Raw. Bah.

      Today, I have been mostly bemoaning the fact that I'm single.  I hate Valentine's day with a passion, you get all these images of couples being all loved up etc etc, and it just fills me with...well, with jealousy. They're happy and I'm not.  The whole imagery and sentiment of the day, while designed for people to show their love for one another, simply emphasises just how alone the single people are.  Maybe I'm just bitter though. Well, I know I'm just bitter, but maybe I'm overly bitter.

      Online once again, my room's all fixed up, and everything seems to be working well.  Logged on, and there's 725 emails waiting for me. Of which 6 were not spam. The joys.

      Forgot to mention, I'll probably be offline for a few days, my room's getting done up, so all furniture (including the PC) has to be moved out while it's done.  Getting double glazed window fitted, and a laminate floor, so it'll be worth it in the long run.

      Last night was a good evening of entertainment.  Arrived at the venue a bit later than I'd planned, since I had to stop off at Furys to get flyers, but afetr what seemed like an age in the queue, I got to the front, and had to exchange the SECC ticket that I had for one of the Academy ones. Only because I was so far back in the queue, then the only tickets they had left were balcony ones.   This annoyed and irritated me somewhat, since I'd wanted standing, which is why I bought standing. Hell, I had ticket No 11 for the SECC, I bought it early for a reason. Balcony wasn't too bad though, it's the kind of gig where you don't have to be on the floor to appreciate it.  Show itself was utterly fantastic, I enjoyed it immensely. Light show was good, apart from the one spotlight that seemed to be pointed straight at my face. But James Iha was a kindly soul and stood in front of it for a while.  Maynard had a worrying obsession with people taking off their pants, but he seemed in good humour for most of the gig, and managed to fit in the traditional apology for President Bush.  Music was as good as you'd expect, highlights were hearing The Nurse Who Loved Me and Magdalena in the live setting, I loved those.  Annoyance as I'm only a few seats away from THAT GUY (you know who I mean, there's one at every gig), but he'll probably be overtaken by evolution soon enough.  Afterwards, got a decent amount of flyers handed out, and bought a t-shirt. Which, upon getting home, turned out to be size M. Great. I asked the guy for XL, he checked and handed it to me, so it seemed like a safe assumption that he'd given me an XL, so I just pocketed it. Waste of a fiver, and my sister now has a new APC t-shirt.  Catty afterwards, was alright but nothing special.

      Shocking day in work today. Came within a hair's breadth of getting up and just walking out. Literally 60% of my calls were from people who are nothing but morons. Sold next to nothing, to be expected.  Only one moment of (very minor, but you take what you can get) amusement and satisfaction for me: "...and what is your name?" "Gordon" "No, your full name." "I don't have to give out my surname." "GIVE ME YOUR FULL NAME!" "No." "I'M TELLING YOU, IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME..." -click-

      Picked up the Half Life Generations set today. I'd forgotten just how good this game was, andf it still holds up to scrutiny today. The set's also got the Opposing Force and Blue Shift add-ons, as well as Counterstrike. My only criticism is that to be able to play them online, there are many megabytes of patches that have to be downloaded. Which is not pleasant when you're on a connection like mine. The slow connection of suck. It may be easier to get someone with broadband to download and burn 'em all. I shall see.

      Saw this movie this afternoon. It's not perfect by any means, but I still liked it. Indeed, the only Tim Burton movie I haven't liked was the Planet of the Apes remake.  The film is about Edward Bloom (Albert Finney), who's dying. His son (Billy Crudup) tries to make sense of the myriad of stories that he told during his life, told in flashback with the younger Bloom played by Ewan McGregor.  The stories are varied, but most of them feature an element of fantasy. They basically tell of the adventures of Bloom during his younger days. They are definitely a stronger part of the film than the bits set in the present, which seem like little more than turning the page to get to the next chapter of the past.  It's an inoffensive film, though, and the ending more than makes up for the faults earlier. It's perhaps a bit sickly, but heartwarming nonetheless. I won't spoil it, but it is only the 3rd film in 15 years to make my eyes well up.  Worth watching.

      I feel dirty.   Today, I did one of the things that I've sworn for ages I'd never do. I applied for a credit card.  I've always had a deep unwillingness to get one, purely because I hate being in debt (okay, I'm £2500 in student loan debt, but that's to the government, so it doesn't count), but I felt that since I'm going to be in America, and nowhere over there is likely to accept switch, it's best to have a card that I could use in an emergency, even if it's just to get me home or something. But it's an absolute worst case scenario, I have no intention of using the card.  And I'll be cutting it up when I get back to the UK.

      So, yeah, got the tickets and everything sorted out, and I'm confirmed as going to Las Vegas.  Fly out of Glasgow on the morning of the 20th April, and get back on the morning of the 29th (having left Vegas on the morning of the 28th - timezones eh?)  Spending 8 nights at the Circus Circus hotel, and current exchange rates give me about $800 - $900 spending money while I'm there.  The flights were ludicrously cheap to buy, got them for £290 + tax, which I'm told is great for a return flight at this time of year. There are stops in Amsterdam and Minneapolis, but I can tolerate that. Gives me a chance to stretch my legs. Land in Vegas at about half six in the evening, so the flight times are good as well, not the usual "Flying out on holiday from Glasgow? Then you won't be wanting flights in daylight then!" type shenanigans.  *bounces about, unable to control his glee*

      Went to see this last night with my mum, go figure. She wanted to see it, and I had an unlimited card, so I thought fuckit, and went with her.  To be honest, I was a bit disappointed with it. It struck me as little more than 2 hours of violent preaching from the Right Reverend Mel Gibson, and most of the regular readers of this are well aware of my views on religion.  It's still one of those films that you really should see, just because of all the controversy, if only so you can say that you have seen it and form your own opinion. But I thought it was a bit crap.  The violence was absolutely fucking BRUTAL though. *makes mental note - Don't get crucified*

      Have been somewhat ill the past couple of days, and as such have taken a sick day off work today. I've just been somewhat blocked up, which was leading to a headache and nausea. It's starting to clear up a bit now (and I should fucking well hope so, given the amount of medicine I've taken over the past 24 hours), so all should be back to normal.  Just got 'phoned by the Travel agents, and it's looking like all systems are go for a Vegas trip. I have to drop by tomorrow and get everything finalised and booked. I'll update more on the exact details after it's all sorted, but I am so excited about this, it's gonna rock so much it's untrue.  I'll just have to tell work what days I'm taking as holidays. Not ask, tell. If it means a 2 week sickie, then so be it.

      Ever get that feeling that despite being surrounded by people, you're completely alone?  Aye. Was out last night, and while it started off as a really good night, just after about 2am or so, I started to slip into misery. Think it may just have been tiredness, but it still didn't leave me in the best of moods.  *sigh*  Just another lazy day today, then 5 straight days of work. The joys.

      Went to see the wrestling at Braehead this afternoon.  Got there in plenty of time, and managed to get parked without too much difficulty. Got inside, and our seats weren't too bad. I always get worried about things like that, thinking I'm gonna be miles from the action, but it's always closer than it looks on TV. It is now clear that getting tiered seating would be a good thing in the future.  As an arena itself, Braehead is surprisingly good, nice and modern, and with good facilities and acoustics.  As for the show itself, it was a minor letdown, to be honest. Brock Lesnar and Kurt Angle were missing, for obvious reasons. There weren't that many top stars there, and when your opening match is Chuck Palumbo vs Orlando Jordan, you know what to expect.   John Cena was hugely over, although his match lasted about 2 minutes max. The whole show had a sort of lacklustre feel to it. Some of these guys have had only one day off in the past 7, and the tiredness certainly showed.  Crowd was into Eddie and Rey as well, plus some inexplicable cheers for that fat piece of shit that they call Rikishi. Plenty of cheap heat and pops, so they were at least putting on an effort to make this more than the 'Hello, insert city's name here!' that there usually is.  A pleasant enough way to pass an afternoon, but not what it could have been.

      Was out last night at the Catty, first time there for a good few weeks.   Bunch of good people there, sat on the landing for most of the night just havin' banter with folk.  Collectively, it's been decided that: There are many dinosaurs, bigger than the current ones, that simply haven't been discovered yet. Namely the Megasaurus, and the Ultradactyl. The Pringles machine on the landing is in fact a time travel device. howevere, since it involves Pringles, any attempt to travel through time will result in the bottom part of the body, in this case the ankles, becoming crushed into small pieces, much like the last few crisps in a Pringles tube. Oh yeah, and everyone has a filthy, filthy mind.  Home somewhat speedily, and slept.

      Got home from work today to find out that some people (although I use the term under duress) had broken into my sister's car last night. Drilled a hole in the front passenger side door, and went in hoping to steal the CD player. Which was in the house. So they made do with stealing....wait for it....you won't believe the haul they got.....a Fiat Punto owners manual and a few burnt CDs. Hope whoever it was feels it was worth it.   Seriously, why the fuck would someone go to that much effort for what they got? My only conclusion is that they are nothing other than parasitic subhuman blots on the face of humanity. What this country needs is prison sentences. Long ones.  Grrrr.  *so angry right now*

      So we did watch Wrestlemania last night, and I was very impressed with it.  First up, what I didn't like about the show: The tag title matches. Really, they were just two clusterfucks that took up space and didn't really do much in terms of storyline or crowd reaction. And that fat piece of shit Rikishi is still on TV. It would have been better if they'd taken the time from these matches and given it to...  The Cruiserweight match. Ten guys, ten minutes. What the fuck you mongo? This match really needed a half hour, and it could have been a classic. Chavo Guerrero retains, which drew complaints from Dave since "How can Rey Mysterio lose? He's dressed like the flash?"  About 2.30am or so, Kat texts and asks who won what so far, and gets a reply about jam. Simultaneously from me & Dave. Ach, I was videoing it for her and Steve anyway, but I haven't checked yet if it worked. And I forgot to do it on LongPlay, so it's split over two tapes.  The rest of the show was really good, I thought, with some solid wrestling throughout. Didn't really expect Trish's turn at all, but on the plus side, it does make Jericho a bona-fide face. It was also an example of how to do a storyline PROPERLY. A slow buildup, and no need to hotshot it in the desire for ratings.   Evolution and Rock'n'Sock put on a good match as well, with a finish that I expected, but wasn't disappointed with.  Brock Lesnar and Bill Goldberg learned the hard way about New York crowds that they cheer and boo who they want to. And the entire arena seemed to know that Lesnar was quitting, as 'You sold out' chants echoed all over MSG.   Eddie retains title over Kurt in a top class match. This was one of those matches where you didn't know beforehand who was going to win, which is rare these days.   Two matches to go, and it's MARK OUT TIME! Kane in the ring, and me and Dave are literally on the edge of our seats waiting for what's about to happen. Lights out. 'Oooooh yeeees'. Paul Motherfucking Bearer! Druids with torches. Crazy chanting. A short pause. This is what we have truly waited many months for. BONG! Fucking Yes!  To explain, The Undertaker was the wrestler I marked out for when I first became a fan, and I've always had a soft spot for the deadman character. Although not the biker idiot. So to see him back as the zombie type Undertaker for the first time in over 4 years was a nice moment. He's not the full-on deadman that he was before, and the match was short and plodding, with so little selling that you'd think it was a Hulk Hogan convention, but the entrance was the most important bit of it, make no mistake there.  In the main event, a legitmate classic, with the correct result. The crowd chose wisely as well, and while I'm sure that this won't last as long as it should, be aware of one thing above all else. The record books will show that in front of 20,000 people or so, at one of the most historic arenas in the world, Madison Square Garden, Triple H submited cleanly in the centre of the ring to Chris Benoit.  The show closed with Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit in the ring together as champions.  Wrestlemania XX was billed as 'Where it all begins...again'. if this is the beginning, I'm looking forward to what's to come. I repeat, Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit in the ring together, each a world champion. It is a good time to be a wrestling fan.

      Went to see Starsky & Hutch today.   Didn't think it was that bad. There were some mildly humorous bits, and a nice cameo, but overall, it certainly wasn't earth-shattering. But it didn't register on the Dreamcatcherometer, so it passes as a movie that can take up 90 minutes inoffensively enough.   Wrestlemania tonight, Dave's coming up to watch it, and it's shaping up to be a good one. There's only one match that is likely to be the official bathroom break match, and even that should be mercifully short. And we shall see if Bret Hart shows up, as has been rumoured. part of me's worried, as it's a New York crowd, and they may well turn him heel (or boo him out of the building, as it's otherwise known).  Work's been a bit crap this past week, there's an atmosphere of witch-hunt about, as numerous people have been suspended. There's various scams that people have been doing, and I'm guilty of one of them, although it was a minor offence and didn't get me any advantage or higher bonus. So I'll have to hope that they don't spot it, otherwise I'm job-hunting again, courtesy of Mr P45.  Otuosoedw bh jbvb, S nqejk ogl mbng egzitojalk, ggy bs xyo okbhz iz er nrnq heqvo hpkqk fy.

      I often find myself despairing over the common sense of others.  I've just spent about two hours trying to fix my sister's PC. Her initial diagnosis was that "it's broken". This clearly being of no help to me, further questioning revealed that she had in fact fallen into the age-old trap of the computer-illiterate, and had been opening email attachments from her friends. Without checking the file extension. For many months.  It was thus quite clear to me the size of the task that awaited me. I did get it sorted though, despite having to replace her virus checker of suck with Norton. Upon scanning her system, there were indeed a fantastic amount of viruses, trojans, and worms on the machine.  Cue fury about the sort of people who write programs along those lines.  And so, once she gets home from wherever she is tonight, then she will be on the receiving end of our old chum, the stern lecture on computer security. I am as close to 100% certain as one can be that it will exit one of her ears withing a few seconds of it entering the other. She'll learn eventually.  If I've got the time, I'll convert her away from Microsoft  viruses  software wherever possible.

      Didn't expect THAT.  A good victory for Celtic, and it contained everything a good match should. namely, attractive attacking football, hard tackling, us winning, and a pier six brawl breaking out.  Rab Douglas is a cretin, Bobo Balde only mildly less so, but he played well tonight, so I'll let him off.

      Went out last night for Heather's birthday, which was pretty fun. Bunch of us in Otis', which has some rather natty new furniture. (well, might not be new, but it wasn't there last time I was)  Some good banter and such like, although I bumped into someone I haven't seen in a while, and it was commented on that 'your hair got big'.  The rest of them went to New Flesh afterwards, but I headed back home due to a need for sleep.   And that's about it. Sister now has her car, so I do indeed have control of the dentmobile.

      Have somehow forgotten to mention over the past week that work is shit again.  For a while, we thought they'd improved the call routing into us, because we were actually getting calls where you could at least have a chance of selling something. But NO! It would appear that this is little more than a fluke for a few weeks, as it's back to the same old shit, people who can't even get the right department, and sometimes not even the right company...  "Yes, I want to complain about the film that was on last night" "What?" "The film you showed last night. I want to complain about it" "We're British Telecom. We don't do films. We provide phone service" "Oh, I thought this was the BBC" "No, it's BT. Thanks for calling anyway" "Aren't you going to do anything about my complaint?" "Given that it's entirely outwith our jurisdiction and field of relevance, we are indeed going to do nothing" -RLS-  They've also changed the targets again. Each product has the same points value as before, but we now have to sell 165 points worth per hour, as opposeed to 115 before, a 43% increase. Even Stalin's 5 year plans didn't set targets that unrealistically high compared to this.  This has all been done because they've run out of money in the bonus fund, and it doesn't get renewed until April. But you can be damn sure that they won't improve it once there IS more money. Arseholes.

      Things are looking good.  My sister's just bought herself a car. So she'll have her own, and with my mum having her own as well, that leaves me as the only driver of the dentmobile.  What this means: I'll have to pay all of the petrol costs. This is not a problem, since I already pay for the petrol I use, so there'll be no change there. I'll have to pay all the road tax. Not a great problem either. I'll have to contribute to the insurance. At the moment, my Mum's had the Megane on her insurance, so we haven't had to pay anything for it. I've told her I'm willing to stump up for it, on condition that the policy goes into my name so I can start building up a no claims bonus. Checking online for some quotes, and I can get fully comprehensive cover for £470-odd a year. The snag for this is that I have to be the registered owner of the car, but if it all comes down to it, my Mum may be willing to sign the owneership of teh car over to me (for legal convenience purposes only, natch. It wouldn't actually be my car...) The current insurance isn't due for renewal until May, so it's not of vital condern.  Upshot of all this: Come early next week, I'll have almost 100% control over the Dentmobile.  Things are looking good.

      Bit of a war brewing with the neighbours, albeit good-natured.  For the past couple of years, each family has bought the tackiest Xmas present possible for the other, and last christmas we got them a garden gnome, bought from the pound shop.  This past weekend, I came home to find 2 gnomes that they'd bought in Millport, sitting in my front garden. So I did the only thing I could do. I took it indoors, fetched a hacksaw, decapitated it, and put it on their doorstep in a gift bag.  This morning, found another gnome head (from their Xmas present, no less) on a stick in the garden.  Still planning revenge. Undecided as to what to do, but this can only escalate. It'll go too far at some point, but it's fun at the moment.

      What a trip! Seriously, absolute best week of my life.    Outward Journey  Not the best start, it has to be said, as I get to Glasgow airport to check in, and discover that the flights have been changed, and instead of flying through Minneapolis to get there, I'm now going through Houston. This isn't too bad in the long run, as the airline is now Continental rather than KLM, and they've got nicer planes.  Flight from Glasgow - Amsterdam isn't too bad, although I discover an unnerving thing about how aircraft take off, namely that the engines always sound like they're at death's door, and planning on sending you there shortly. When it happens 6 times in 9 days though, you get used to it and realise that it's fairly normal.  Amsterdam airport in monstrously large, especially compared to Glasgow. This does mean that when you're stuck there for a few hours waiting for a connecting flight, there is at least stuff to keep you occupied. Hit the internet cafe for a bit, to make sure that Jeff had got the details of my new arrival times etc. He had, so it's all good.  The journey to Houston was LONG. 10 hours flying time, and I didn't manage to get a damn bit of sleep on it. The flight path went up past Iceland and Greenland, then down through Canada, which means next to nothing to look at (waste of a window seat, there), and the added bonus of knowing that if anything goes wrong with the plane, you're well and truly fucked as the plane'll land (not very smopothly, either) on the frozen wastelands of northern Canada.   Houston's another huge airport, and tries to outdo others by calling itself an Intercontinental airport as opposed to an international one. Which is a fair point to make, given that even pieces of shit like Prestwick call themselves international these days. Only had a 90 minute stopover or so at Houston, which was just enough time to clear immigration etc (they do NOT like sarcasm, and are inherently suspicious when someone's flights have been changed - although it's not exactly like I chose it), before getting on the plane for Vegas.   That flight was pretty uneventful, and I landed in Vegas just after 10pm local time, thus taking my total time awake clock past the 25 hour mark. Got met by Jeff and Jennabea at baggage claim, and we're off to the hotel after getting my luggage (commendably hassle free).   Check in wasn't a problem either, and my room was on the 34th floor (of 35), with a decent view westwards. It was a good size, and well equipped with all I'd need.   The City  The first thing that strikes you about Las Vegas is the sheer size of the place. Not in terms of population, but actual physical stature. Everything's just bigger. The strip's 3 miles long, and that sets the tone for the rest of the place. With well laid out streets, and parking just about anywhere that you could want it, it's a far cry from the dense jungle of roads that is Glasgow. Distances were such that a $5 all day bus ticket was soon a good friend of mine.  The city looks really nice too, and it shows that it's been built relatively recently (well, compared to my city, it's new). Once darkness falls, it's a totallty different ball game, as the lights come on, and turn the place into a power plant owner's wet dream. Not that it's bad, but the neon and flashy lights can go for your head after a while.   The Weather  Baking. Absolutely fucking BAKING. To be expected, since it's in a desert, but still. 70 degrees at night, and up above 90 during the day, and it's still only April. To contrast this, in Glasgow, 70's considered roasting even in the height of summer. It is a dry heat though, so you don't feel as uncomfortable as you would over here. Once it's night, that's the best time to go out, and certainly that's when I felt most at ease.   Food  Biggest. Portions. Ever. In really hot weather, my appetite goes down, and I was rarely able to finish everything, such was the amount they gave out. I found out the hard way how much a fluid ounce is, when I ordered a 44oz Pepsi (hey, only $1.75), and practically died when I got handed over 1300ml worth of said cold beverage. Other food notes: I am addicted to Gatorade, it is official. In and Out is the god of fast food places. Free refills of soft drinks = a good thing. Mmmmm....sushi.   The People  Don't think I've ever met a friendlier bunch of people in my life. Perhaps it's because the city is so reliant on tourism, but the customer service skills are off the charts, and when they say 'Have a nice day', you get the feeling that they actually want you to have a nice day, which is pleasnt change form this country.  Also met a bunch of Jeff's mates, and again, without exception, they all seem really cool. My accent was fairly popular as well, which is fine by me, as I don't exactly have to work on it.   Other random stuff  - Ended up at a party for Jenny and Jennabea's birthdays. Got drunk. I have now decided that that will have been my last time drinking alcohol, ever. While I had fun, I also noticed a creeping onslaught of the things I don't like about a drunken me. Managed to keep it in check, but still, I'm not drinking again. The party was good fun though, as I show my prowess at shotgunning to all concerned, and laugh as they all fail in their attempts to keep up. My wrestling fanboy action also appeared, as Jeff got a chokeslam and a Tazzmission, and Mikki ended up in a Scorpion Deathlock.  - Did a bungee jump. Was really good fun, although after the fact. There's nothing quite like the terror as you're going over the edge, and one of the attendants asks "Isn't that meant to be attached?" Oh those pesky kids.  - Saw Kill Bill 2, although kept dozing off during it, mainly because I'd been awake for 44 of the previous 48 hours, resulting in much 'prod-and-stab-so-he-stays-awake' from Jennabea. Loved what I saw.  - Saw The Punisher. Not a bad movie, but then, I've never read the comics. It's worrying when Kevin Nash is in the best scene in a movie.  - Got taken to a strip club (Hell, it's Vegas, it's practically my duty to go). Almost HHH'd my drink at one point.  - When having sushi, beware of the death roll, unless of course you wish to lose the ability to taste anything for the next 20 minutes.  - A 10 minute cab ride from hotel to airport is more than enough time for a lecture about the importance of bringing the lord jesus into one's life, it appears.  That's all I can really think of to say at the moment. I'm sure more'll come back to me, but I just want to reiterate, best week of my life, ever.

      2 days from now, I'll be en route to Las Vegas.   And to tell you the truth, I'm absolutely bricking it. I'm not particularly worried about what goes down while I'm in the city, more about the act of getting there. I'm fantastically paranoid that there's gonna be some almighty great fuck up at immigration and I get sent home, or they end up sending my luggage on to somewhere else, or any one of a number of things that could go wrong.  I know the chances of it happening are somewhat remote, but I always do this in situations like this, I think of the worst case scenario, and then assume that that's going to be what actually happens. I'm sure everything will be fine, but I just have this nightmare vision of being stranded at Minneapolis airport with no money or anything like that.  Must find something to do to take my mind off this....

      Initial plan for tonight was to go to the Catty. At 20.36 hours, this was still the case. At 20.38, it was not.  Every one of Steve's lifts to the SAS thingy he was going to in Burntisland had fallen through, so he called and asked if I could take him. So I said yes, 'cos I know how much he's been looking forward to this, and he's a good mate, I couldn't leave him in the lurch.  There's no greater pleasure than driving through pitch black roads that you don't know at 10pm at night. The constant fear of some moron coming racing round the corner and killing you dead certainly keeps the adrenaline flowing.  We took the Kincardine bridge route over there, and made it by about quarter to eleven or so. Grabbed a quick coffee, and I headed back, taking the Forth road bridge and then the M8. Made good time, despite nearly getting wiped out by some asshats racing superspeedway style on the way into Glasgow. In Corsas. Really, guys, if you're gonna race, use better cars than that.  Made it home by about half twelve. Free entry's expired, so no Catty for me. Meh.

      Work dragged in today, boring as hell, with cretins aplenty calling in.   With about an hour and a half to go, though, things picked up. The Doncaster call centre picked up a fault, and that meant manual login to clear the backlog of calls trying to get through. Or at least, it would have meant that, but our manager was off, and so it was basically a license to skive for the rest of the shift. I took 3 calls in 90 minutes, with times of 7 minutes, 18 seconds, and 3 seconds.   I'm now off for two and a half weeks. It's great.  Credit card still hasn't arrived though.

      Well, that's that for another season. Celtic got knocked out of the UEFA cup, and to be brutally honest, we played pish, and deserved to get beaten.  Still, we knocked Barcelona out, and I didn't think we'd do that. Now we just have to concentrate on the league and domestic cup.  Ho hum.

      Sunday night was good. Headed into town to meet the gang (no, I can't believe I just said that either) in Rufus', and following some begging, managed to nab some free passes for the Catty. Headed down, and all made it in before the free entry expired.  It was probably too busy to fit into the top echelon of Sunday nights out, far too many cretins in attendance. But those who were there all conspired to have a good time, and there was some high-quality banter from many folks.  Dave said miaow a lot, I accidentally hit Heather in the face, I freaked Lynn out by suggesting the vocalist for the Union Underground is a necrophiliac ('Turn Me On Mr Deadman'? - the evidence is plain for all to see), Kat did karaoke, and Steve had a mild case of honour. And there was the inevitable return of a barbershop quartet. Unfortunately for those with musical sensibilities, all we seemed able to sing was 'bawbag'.  Since I didn't have the car in there, ended up getting the bus home, and it reminded me why it is that I usually take the car. Full of bigoted morons.  Only 3 more days of work prior to vacation OF DOOM (the good kind of doom). All kinds of w00tery.

      Fantastic movie.   Let's be honest right from the start, movies with zombies are almost always good. This is no exception. Many moments that are laugh-out-loud funny, and plenty of geeky in-jokes and references to be had. My favourite bit was the battering of the landlord to Queen's 'Don't stop me now'. Most amusing.  Plus there's the constant references to Big Al.  Thumbs way up, highly recommended for all to see.

      Got my dollars for Vegas yesterday. Twelve hundred of them, thanks to a really good current exchange rate. Got $200 in cash, and $1000 in travellers cheques. This should be fun.  And after having to send 'em some payslips, the bank approved me for the emergency credit card.  And the manager at work finally remembered to put my days off into the spreadsheet. Only 2 of the team are allowed to be off at any one time, and there are 3 of us with holidays booked at the same time as me. But I'm in the spreadsheet, so fuck 'em. Hell, fuck 'em anyway, I was going no matter what work said.  This is all shaping up to be really good.

      Friday - Cathouse. Good night, but left early due to tiredness on a grand scale. Saturday - Lazy day, then sushi. This is a good thing. Sunday - Dawn of the Dead, then Cathouse. Movie good, better than I thought it would be, and I liked the Richard Cheese action. Catty not too bad, but was quite tired, since I hadn't had much sleep at all. Gave Barry a lift home, and got to sleep about 5am.  Apologies for the above crapness, it's short attention span day here, apparently.  15 days until Vegas. People have been giving me 'orders' of stuff they'd like brought back. Some of it won't be a problem, but at this rate, I won't be able to manage it all. Bear in mind I do have a 20kg baggage limit, and I'm only taking one suitcase. So if it doesn't fit, it's not coming home with me.

      In work today, it was a 'fun' day to mark the fact that BT had been in that building for ten years. Very little fun took place, but that was of secondary importance, as the hot manager on my floor was getting into the spirit of things by wearing an astoundingly short skirt, and some knee high boots.   Distraction-tastic, and all of a sudden all I can do for the rest of the day is stare and drool.  We got a couple of hours of manual login, so it wasn't all bad. Skiving ahoy.

      The new series of Big Brother launched this weekend, and while watching it, as amused as I was, I couldn't help but feel that it was the ultimate example of scraping the bottom of the barrel in a desperate search for ratings.  It was a good idea to begin with, and the first series was popular, partly because no-one knew what to expect, and partly because there was a decent heel (as pantomime and obvious as he was). Series 2 through 4 were utterly fucking nondescript though, and people gradually stopped caring, as one dull non-entity after another won, and took their place in the massed ranks of the d-list celebrities fighting it out for a slot on the hell of daytime TV.  This year they pledged that they were going to get 'evil' ('INDEED' - insert Kaientai dubbing here). They've done this by making the house more cramped, in the hope that people will get to each other more. Or, to be more accurate, they've realised that only 2 things sell in the desperate quest to make your show 'edgy'. These being sex and violence.   Since they failed in 4 series to get people to fuck on national TV, they've switched tack, and are trying to get them to fight instead. And the choice of contestants only confirms this. First in - Marco, a homosexual who hates asylum seekers and refugees. Second in - Ahmed, a former asylum seeker and refugee who's homophobic. You could almost cut the tension with a knife, were it not for the fact that it's supermarket brand tension, pre-packaged and fake.  The rest of the cast of misfits were just as predictable: the feminist dyke (with the cheapest heat ever on her entry to the house), the arrogant one, the regular 'nice' person, the transsexual, you get the picture.  What makes me despair about this is the way the public will probably still watch this in large numbers, and convince the TV execs that it is a good idea, so they'll commission even more of this tripe at the expense of programmes that might actually do something about the dumbed-down, vacuous stupidity that passes for British TV these days.

      So, about to leave to drive into town to meet dave, Steve and Kat last night, I get to the car. And see that something's wrong. Notably, that my rear tyre on the driver's side is flat. There is a simple reason for this situation. It's because some fucking cuntweed has slashed it.   I am still raging about this, even the next morning. That car's seemed to cost me nothing but vast amounts of money since as soon as I took posession of it. Now most of the costs like insurance, I can handle, because I knew they were coming. But now I have to fork out for a new tyre simply because some fucktard with nothing better to do has put a sharp object into it. It's not going to be that expensive, and I have the money, it's just the principle of the thing.   It's times like this that I really give serious consideration to moving away. Even just a few miles out into the countryside, away from Glasgow. Where I could be pretty certain that my posessions would be safe from the constant threat of mindless vandalism. Where there wouldn't be neds hassling you all the goddamn time.   Why can't half the population of the world just go somewhere quiet and just fucking well curl up and die?  Not in the best of moods at the moment, and this was just the final straw.

      Took a call in work the other day from a Mr Akuma.  Managed to fit the phrases 'uppercut', and '15 hit combo' into the conversation without him noticing, which was one of those rare moments that makes work feel not so bad and lets me smile for a few minutes.  Having said that, the guy was so stupid and slow that I could have detonated a small nuclear device in his front room and it'd have taken him a while to notice.

      Fuck, this is a good album.  I bought it today, and I'm mighty impressed by it. It's clearly the sound of a band that's grown up a lot. There are still some heavy tracks, but the band aren't afraid in the slightest to soften their approach, and I feel that this makes them more complete. By having the odd folky or acoustic track, it makes the heavy seem heavier.  Also of note is the fact that the lyrics seem to have progressed greatly since the debut album (don't start, I don't class MFKR as a proper album), and now are a lot more mature and sensible than the 'Fuck this world" mentality of a few years ago.  There'll be those who criticise them for this album, mainly the kIdDiEs WhO tYpE lIkE tHiS, but I really like it, and I think it's given them a stab at longevity that they probably wouldn't have got if this had been another 'more of the same' album.

      Work are being cunts again.   A notice came around today saying that all Scottish workers would now have to follow English bank holidays, because when we're off on our bank holidays, the English still call in, and the workload is bigger. So we get shafted.  I'm legitimately raging at this. Where in the fuck do they get off changing our holidays just to suit another fucking country? This is symptomatic of the English mentality of making everyone else bend to suit their view of the world, and I for one am fucking sick of it. What next? No holidays at Christmas because a bunch of people don't celebrate it?  So the bottom line is that when just about everyone else in the country has the day off, we're fielding calls from cretins. And when the English ahve a bank holiday, we get the day off, but there's nothing to do, OH NO, there's nothing to do, because why would there be special nights on anywhere when no-one else is off the next morning.  Gah.

      So, I saw Psyko Dalek (or Pysko Dalek, if the tickets are to be believed) for the first time last night, and I have to say I was impressed by them.   Of particular note was the drumming, which I liked, and special mention has to go to Div, who's quite the frontman. He strikes the right poses, is almost Fear Factory-esque with the odd semi-melodic bit thrown in, and has an all round good stage presence. "This song's about tanning burds up the arse"  Bit of a catalogue of disasters at the gig though, one of the bands pulled out (which turns out to be a good thing for scheduling purposes), one band walks off withing 2 minutes of me getting into the gig, another one (Second Skin, I think) losing half their set due to sound problems (which is a shame, because they acquitted themselves well from what I saw), and about 50 people not getting in because the tickets were ambiguously worded, and they thought it was over 14s, with only the bar area over 18s. When in fact the whole place was over 18s only. But meh, I'm sure this happens at all gigs.  Hit the Cathouse afterwards, and had a decent enough night for the time I was there. Danced more (and worse) than I have for quite a while, and I'm feeling it this morning.

      So, yeah.  Work today wasn't too bad. the time passed fairly quickly, mainly because we found new and exciting (read: mildly less boring than normal) ways to distract ourselves from the drudgery of taking calls from cretins.  The guy sitting next to me has even more contempt for the customers than I do, and really doesn't seem to give a damn if he gets sacked, so it's always fun to be around when he's ripping the piss, which he does regularly and with great ease. The best bit is that the customers never seem to have even the slightest idea that he's doing it.  Having got home, i'm now tired beyond belief, hence the reason that I'm not out tonight. I picked up a few DVDs yesterday, but I'm too tired to even watch them. But they'll do for occupying me over the next couple of weeks.  Celtic won the cup today in Henrik Larsson's final competitive game, which was nice. Dunno what the team's gonna do to try and replace him next season, but I expect just about every agent in Europe is about to try and hawk us their 'star' player.  That's about all for now, so I'll go get me some sleep. Sleep good. (Napster bad)

      Well, thanks to a quick visit to an internet cafe, I was finally able to get a gmail account set up, so with ntl still teh b0rked, I'll be using that for my email from now on.  So if anyone wants to contact me, I'm now reachable at gordon.henderson(@)gmail.com Remove the brackets though.  Heard good things about the service, namely the spam filters, and the fact that there's a gig of storage. So none of this hotmail '2meg and you run out of space' crap. And the much-criticised adverts appear no more intrusive than the ones at the side of google search pages that everyone ignores anyway.

      Well, I didn't get the secondment at work, didn't even make it to the interview stage. Although this may be because there were a couple of hundred folk who went for it. So I'm not too bummed, because at the end of the day, it'd still have been in BT, and I hate them with all my heart.  So the search for another job continues apace (a slow pace, but apace nonetheless). Got an application pack for the Inland Revenue in the post today, I'll see how that turns out. I don't even mind what job I end up with, as long it's not dealing with the public the whole damn time.

      Went to the cinema this afternoon, and caught one of the previews of Troy.  It's certainly classic Hollywood, in the sense that it takes liberties with the story, panders to the lowest common denominator, and is a triumph of style over substance.   Brad Pitt's accent changes many times throughout the film, and he's just generally useless. Clearly there to look good, and in that sense he succeeds, but he doesn't do much else.   Orlando Bloom's even worse, although he is given some utterly risible dialogue to work with.   Helen of Troy is supposedly the most beautiful woman in the world, the face that launched 1000 ships. Based on this movie, they launched in a desperate quest to flee her attempts at acting.   I liked Brian Cox as Agamemnon though, and Peter O'Toole gave a nice turn as the King of Troy, stealing the whole movie with his speech to Achilles.  There's no sympathy for any of the characters, which is a major flaw. Most movies like this at least try and set up one side as the faces and the others as the heels, but Troy insists of switching all the time. First you think the Greeks are ok, and that helen's a cheating bint, but then Achilles is such an arrogant bitchy cunt that you start to prefer the Trojans. And then we switch to the Greeks again, hoping someone will kill that twat Bloom. The end result of all this is that you don't care about any of the characters, and don't really give a rat's ass who wins.  One thing that really got my goat was the typical Hollywood idea that audiences have no attention span and everything needs to be dumbed down. The Lord of the Rings trilogy showed them that movies can be long and still have people go to see them. This movie runs 160 minutes, and yet they still don't have time for the siege of Troy. It's no surprise that the end credits list the movie as being inspired by Homer's Iliad, as opposed to based on it.  Speaking of The Lord of the Rings, it's worth noting that as big as the battle set pieces are, they don't seem that awe-inspiring since we have the Pelennor as our new reference point.  This isn't to say that I hated the movie. It was well shot, and didn't particularly feel that it was as long as it was. Overall, it's worth seeing if you've got a few hours to spare, but there's no need to make a special trip.

      Got the notification from the DVLA the other day that I was now the registered keeper of the Dentmobile. Which is all well and good, until the fucking thing develops a hole in the exhaust within 8 FUCKING HOURS of the documentation arriving.  Raspy engine noises are bad, so while I was at work today, I got my mum to take it to the local branch of Kwik-Fit to see what was up with it exactly.   Got home from work, and discovered the exhaust looked suspiciously brand new. Which it was. And it had cost £130 or thereabouts. At that price, I'd expect the thing to be solid gold. They even had the audacity to say that we should be thankful that the catalytic converter was okay, because that would have been another £200 and a pound of flesh to replace. So whoop-de-fucking-do for the trees and associated huggers.  The heated rear windscreen's still fucked though, but that's not so vital at this time of year.

      Well, got my application for the secondemnt handed in at work, so it remains to be seen how well that goes. I don't even kniow yet how many have applied, but I'd like to think I'm in with somewhat of a chance.  Going to get myself a new mobile phone at some point soon, I'm getting fed up with the current one. Can't decide what one to go for. Shall probably wait until a couple more wage packets have gone in to my account though. Well, there's last month's bonus to be paid, but that's not for another couple of weeks though.  Speaking of wages, it appears that work did actually pay me for the holidays I took. Despite the fact there's no way in hell I'd accrued those holidays. Feh, I don't care, it's cash for me.  Other stuff I will probably end up buying in the future:  A digital camera. Just because I want one. A decent size hard drive. Because 6gig and 8 gig are not the storage sizes to be running a system on. Plus, it'd be needed to go with the other thing to buy... Broadband. I'm fed up with 56k, I really am. I reckon I can afford it easily enough. And if my sister thinks she's piggybacking on it, she can fuck right off.  2 minutes left on this connection. Time to go.

      Colour me livid, here.  Got the car sorted out recently, as I've mentioned in an earlier entry, this means that it's getting transferred into my name for legal reasons. (although my mum'll still own it to all intents and purposes)  The main reason for this was that it's only when I'm the car's registered in my name that I'm able to get insurance in my name. And since I was expected to contribute to the cost, I was only gonna do that if I could start building up a no-claims bonus.  So I started shopping around for quotes, and most places were quoting me about £700 for a year's fully comprehensive cover. I finally went for elephant, 'cos they would give me it for £462, which seemed reasonable (ish).  Got an email today to say that because I added their breakdown cover, it's an extra £70 or so for the year. Which I think is a bit excessive. Actually, I think it's a lot excessive.  Further rage came about when talking to Lynn last night in the cathouse, and finding out that she's paying pretty much the same as me. Now, no disrespect to her, but she's 19 and has already been in an accident that's written off a car (yes, I know it wasn't her fault), whereas I'm 24, and have 7 years of claim-free driving. I can't help but feel that I'm being punished for being male.   Insurance is like that though. More accidents and claims involve males. Therefore, all males are more dangerous. Fuck right off. Sometimes I'd almost like a personal hearing in cases like this, if only so they could see that I'm not a boy racer in a bammed up nedmobile.  Grrrr.

      My email's utterly fucked, I can't get into either of my ntl addresses, they download about 4 messages and then it goes tits up.

      It's odd, as soon as I decide I want out of BT, an opportunity arises to get a secondment for 6 months doing site support for the agency. The only downside is that I wouldn't get any bonus, but that makes no different to my finances, and it's more than offset by the fact that I'd be offline. No more calls from cretins!   Even though it's only for 3-6 months, it's still a chance to get some decent admin type experience. I'm going to give this one serious thought.

      Went to the wrestling show on friday night up in EK. was a good show, one of the better ones I've seen. The odd bit was sloppy or dragged on too long, but overall it was certainly worth a visit. The next time they hit there, they'll have the Honky Tonk Man and Marty Jannetty, apparently.  Scraped the side of the car into a lamppost while leaving Steve's on Saturday. Just the paintowrk damaged though, nothing serious.  Hit the catty afterwards, and nothing of note happened. No change there then.  Sunday I headed over to Kelvingrove Park to hang out for a bit, but left as soon as I got the offer to go and meet Eilidh, who was back in Glasgow for the first time in 3 months. fantastic to see her again, I'd missed her so much. Pity she's heading up to Skye for a while, but at least I can shoot the shit with her by phone without needing a mortgage.   Saw Kill Bill 2 again, this time without sleeping through it, and enjoyed it just as much this time as I did last time. So yay to that.   Then headed down to the Catty, where it was busy, but not sardine busy. Mostly good night, some good banter with various folks, some folks running away in terror when it's PATENTLY OBVIOUS THAT I MEAN THEM NO HARM, and other such nonsense. Took a bit of a turn for the worse towards the end, as all the stuff to think about in my head exploded  out and demended to be answered, when I couldn't and wouldn't at that time. Still, I'll fix that over time.  And now, I go back to working at BT tomorrow. The joys, oh the joys.

      Where to start?  My time in Vegas showed me a few things, and opened my eyes to a couple of points about what I want to do with my life. Or, more accurately, what I don't want to do with my life.   First step is to find a new job. As mentioned in the previous entry, the customer service ethos over there is so much higher than it is here. Maybe it's because they are so much more reliant on tips. Then again, maybe they're just much more friendly people. Whatever the reason, it showed me that I really have to get out of a customer facing environment before I lose my mind. When it all comes down to it, (and I'm honest enough to admit this) I don't CARE in the slightest if whoever's on the phone needs a line installed as a medical emergency or because their business'll fold if they don't or whatever reason they deem more vital than anyone else's.   It's just me. Those who know me will be well aware that when the chips are down, I'll go to the ends of the earth for my friends. My friends. People that I have spent time with, and enjoy the company of. But the people who call into work? they're just faceless drones on the other end of a big long wire. I'm not paid enough to give a rat's ass about them. I wouldn't ever give a rat's ass, but sometimes you can pretend. But false sincerity is worse than no sincerity at all.  I'm just somewhat disillusioned with it all. While I was away, I saw people who were making a decent amount of money doing jobs that they enjoyed. The key word there is enjoyed. I've always said that I'll take a pay cut for job satisfaction. But right now I have wages that can quite easily be filed under 'pittance', and no job satisfaction whatsoever.  Other areas of life that need fixed are less urgent, but need fixed nonetheless. I need to be more impulsive, and not just about trivial things like what to have for dinner. Far too often, I get an inkling of a feeling that I want to do something, and for fear of making a mistake, I think about whether it's a good idea or not. And as sure as night follows day, that thought process results in me finding a reason (however small) not to go through with it. So I do nothing, all the while knowing deep down that I really DO want it. But still, I sit there, frustrated.  I need to try and get a grip on my mood swings. I can go from happy and carefree to being burdened with too much to be concerned about in the time it takes to snap one's fingers. And when I have somethign to be concerned about, I always think of all the scenarios, but the one that sticks in my head (and thus the one that I have ingrained as the one that WILL happen) is the worst one. Every damn time.  Giving up alcohol (forever, this time) is one step towards this, as that always seemed to bring out the misery. It was while I was drunk at the party in Vegas that I realised that there I was, slumped on a couch, and slipping back into the person that I REALLY didn't want to be. I caught it before it got too far, and stopped drinking for the rest of the night, so it wasn't as bad as it could have been.  To sum up this entire entry in two sentences: I've can see the way I want things to be, and I can see the way things are. They are not the same.

      Post graduation, we went for food at the Ivory restaurant (no, that's the name, it's not actually made of ivory - b'doom tiss)  It's actually very nice, the food was both affordable and tasty, which are alwats two plus points in my book. I can particularly recommend the chicken strips, and the duck. Also, the strawberry cheesecake was to die for.  After that, I need never eat again. (Note: That statement isn't true, and such fact will be demonstrated tomorrow morning, right about breakfast time)

      Tomorrow, I have the joy of attending my sister's graduation. And frankly, I'd rather be disembowelled with a rusty spoon.   Now don't get me wrong here, it's not as if I wish any ill to my sister, I'm pleased for her that she passed everything and such like, but I can think of few things that fill me with more dread than this.  It was bad enough when I was the one involved, I'd have happily grauduated in absentia. I told all members of my family not to come if they didn't want to, thinking this would afford me the same privileges at their ceremonies. No such luck.  So I now have to suffer through the boredom, the speeches, the general mind-numbing tedium, person gets name called, wanders on stage, shakes hands, gets degree, lather, rinse, repeat, 'Quick, this is her', they all look the same to me, "don't ridicule the others, their parents could be sitting close by" - "I'll ridicule anyone I damn well please"  As if all that's not bad enough, I'm the designated driver, which means hanging around while my sister talks to her vapid asshole friends as if she'll never see them again, when in fact she talks to them constantly on the phone, and then bitches about them to all her other friends on other calls.  God I'm bitter tonight.  In happier news, I got accepted for that job I went for at the Inland Revenue. They're full at the moment, but I'm on a reserve list, so once a slot opens up (oo-er), I'm there. And more importantly, I won't be in BT.

      Went to the BCW show in East Kilbride tonight.  I'm consistently impressed by the shows and the promotion in general. They've improved dramatically since I first caught them last year, and there were some really good matches and spots tonight.  The performance was perhaps hindered a bit by the low ceiling at the arena (I can't believe I just called it that), which put some restrictions on the moves that could be done off the top, but everyone adapted well.  Match of the night was clearly Alex Shane vs Doug Williams, and Shane in particular has some damn good mic work, although he we would be well served checking, before he calls everyone in the arena mongoloids, that there are in fact no mongoloids in attendance. Oops! And credit to the fat guy in the front row (legit 500lbs) for being a good sport about the constant ridicule he suffered.  The main reason for going was of course the appearance of The Honky Tonk Man and Marty Janetty. True old school. Honky worked the crowd well and was super over, although the workrate wasn't particularly off the charts.   Janetty was lumbered with The Highlander (who I remain convinced only has his position on the card because he's the booker) as a tag partner, but still seemed to be in pretty decent ring shape. And he actually did the 'tag partner making the save' spot properly, pushing the opponent off the pin, rather than just hitting him, which was a pleasant surprise.  Overall, a good show. Worth seeing them if you can.

      Work was fun yesterday, as we taunted the English about losing in Euro 2004 by altering the phonetic alphabet. "That's P for Portugal, B for Beckham, M for Miss...". Was a fairly quiet day overall, not that many people calling in, so I wasn't too stressed. Got told towards the end of the day that there had been a system crash of sorts, so my extra shifts today and tomorrow were cancelled, and Monday was in jeopardy. So I'll find out on Monday morning whether or not that's happening.  This meant that last night, I was able to go out for a while. Headed out to the Cathouse, where a decent enough night was had, albeit with a few minor issues. It's also always funny when the dj is completely panelled though, and last night was no exception. Was being watched in a suspicious matter at one point, but nothing was happening, so gossip mongers can STFU.  PC upgrades have now taken place, with a 160gig hard drive now in my machine. Much cheapness, managed to get it for £65 including postage. Not many upgrades to go, I'll keep the 6gig that was the E drive, and make that a removable one, for file transferring between here and Scapegoatia, and there's an extra fan to be installed. After which, it's only broadband to be added, since an ethernet card was fitted last night. And possibly a new case, depending on how I feel at the time.  Got not very much sleep at all last night, so I'm just gonna have a lazy day today, I think.

      So I got offered extra hours at work this weekend, and normally I'd have refused point blank, but for some reason I made further enquiries as regards why they asked.   Glad I did, as it was for the offline team. Don't know what I'm going to be doing, but I do know I won't be dealing with customers. This makes me pleased.  So I'm on Saturday 10-4, Sunday 10-4, and Monday 10-3. If this goes well, then I'll maybe try and see about getting myself moved to an offline team full time. That would rock.

      I just got several votes in an online awards ceremony.  Worryingly, they were for 'really needs to get laid'. REALLY worryingly, only one of them was me voting for myself.  So the question is: Were the other votes sympathy votes, or ridicule, and are any of them likely to result in my getting laid?  Pesky secret ballots. And why am I even admitting to this?  edit: All the votes were ridicule. bah.

      Mondays, being my rota day off work, generally follow one of two possible patterns: 1) Get up mid morning, and do something semi-constructive. 2) Get up at lunchtime, and piss about on the internet all day.  So today, I ended up getting up even earlier than I normally would have, as I'd been roped into giving Steve and Kat (and Morgan) a lift to get some 'foties took'. Or rather, they had to get from EK to Newton Mearns and then town by 11am, and someone with a car is the best way to do that.  The photographer was overly camp, verging on the ludicrous (or fabulous, depending on what way inclined you are - I'll stick with ludicrous), but Morgan behaved, and so the whole ordeal was painless.  Headed along to A1 afterwards, and I finally caved in and bought an action figure to put on top of stuff. Clarifying, the plan's always been to get geeky stuff on top of speakers, monitors and similar appliances that I own / use, but until now, I've never got round to buying any. So, as of today, I have a small Xenomorph on my left PC speaker (sadly one from Alien3 - yes, Jeff, it DOES exist, especially in the form of the extended cut - and not the original), and a Buddy Christ on the dashboard of my car. I'm undecided as to what to get for the right speaker (The Luggage, ideally, if I can find one cheap and with semi-decent quality), and I quite fancy one of Ryu, Ken, or Akuma for the top of the monitor.  Have set the wheels in motion for upgrading one of my hard drives (the media one), and thus the 6 gig effort I'm using will soon retire, to be replaced with a 160 gig monster (well, by my standards it's a monster) in preparation for the eventual installation of broadband. The 8 gig drive will stay as my Windows / programs drive for now.  That's about all I did of note this week(end), but on a slightly more depressing note, England look far too likely to do well in the European Championships. If they win this thing, we'll never hear the end of it...  Peace out for now, y'all.

      Just back from the cinema, and a trip to see Jersey Girl, the latest movie from Kevin Smith.  Now I've been a fan of Smith's movies for many years, but I was a bit sceptical about this one, as it's the first time he's branched away from the View Askewniverse, so new ground of sorts was being broken here.  Turns out I needn't have worried, the movie's better than I had any right to expect. It's got all the things I like about Smith movies, namely good observations on life, some well-written dialogue, and Jason Lee (sadly only in a cameo role). The things that I could live without in these movies are largely missing, with much less dick and fart jokes throughout.  The best bit of course, is that Jennifer Lopez dies in the first ten minutes. That's worth the price of admission alone.  The film's not perfect by any means, some of it's too schmaltzy, and the kid is far too smart for someone that's meant to be seven. But generally speaking, it's worth seeing, and isn't harmed at all by the lack of Jay and Silent Bob.

      It's the last week of the month in work, and while I still hate the place with all my heart, I'd like to leave on my terms, not theirs.  So to avoid P45-ness of suck, then my stats and performance have to improve. Mainly because I spent the first 2 and a half weeks of the months arseing about like I invented it as a pastime. Now the simple stats, like time offline and other such nonsense, I can fix easily, that's just down to my attitude. The other figures, namely how much I've actually sold, are what causes a few problems, since it is partly out of my hands, requiring as it does the cooperation of those who call in to buy stuff.   So how do I go about fixing this then? Simple, when you think about it. Remove the need for co-operation. Wave goodbye to your conscience. In other words, "If they're breathing, they're buying". Take no for an answer? Nuh-uh. They'd better have a damn good reason for not wanting the product, or I'm gonna make damn sure that they take it.  Now, to the casual reader, it may look like like I'm scamming, but it's not really like that. I'm not going to put something on a person's account without them agreeing to it, I'm just going to use every trick in the book to get them to agree. I'm going to become the exact type of salesman that I despise. But only for a week until I get myself off the performance improvement plan that I'm on. Then it's back to my old friend laziness.   Of course, I've already spotted a few loopholes that can be used to boost stats within the rules at anytime. So they'll stay in my armoury.

      So, relaxing this fine evening, my sister offers me some toffee, since she doesn't want it. Fine, I think, a free snack, and bite in.  Suddenly, something doesn't feel right. Indeed, running my tongue around my mouth feels a lot...sharper than it did before. The main reason for this being that the toffee appears to have chipped a tooth.  This is rather inconvenient, since I've not been to the dentist in 6  years, and I'm pretty sure that I'm not registered with them anymore. It's not like I'm in any pain or anything, it's just a little annoying. And if I want to get it fixed, then my spider-sense tells me that it's gonna be a fucking nightmare to find a dentist who'll take me on as an NHS patient.  There's no fucking way I'm paying to go private, hell, I resent paying full stop, which is primarily the reason I stopped going in the dim and distant past. The whole point of the NHS is that it's meant to be a free service, paid for by the nation's taxes and such like. To then be asked to stump up more for getting your teeth looked at, even when you're an NHS patient, is just wrong in my book.  Anyway, we'll see how it feels come the morning, and how able I am to eat easily.

      Sunday night, watching TV, England vs France is on as part of the Euro 2004 championships.  England take the lead in the first half, and the commentators go into overdrive, wittering on about how great the English are. Their arrogance defies belief at times. The platitudes keep coming, even when they miss a second half penalty, "11 heroes on the pitch" and such jingoistic nonsense.  91 minutes gone, and France equalise through a Zidane free kick. Media calm down a little (not much, mind), and it's still "a draw against the best team in the tournament".  Or at least, it was until 135 seconds later, as France get a penalty, win the match, and wipe grins of the smug variety clean off English faces.  They say the Scots should support the English when Scotland don't make it. I say fuck off, this brings joy to my heart.

      Had folk up to watch Bad Blood last night, and it was decidedly old school. All the classic elements of wrestling gatherings were there in abundance: Kat there for the first time in a year. The table being filled up with food in seconds. Steve bringing munchies that require the use of the kitchen. Steve and Dave arguing about comics and related geekery. The dog being annoying. HHH not jobbing.  All in all, it was a good night, and after all were gone, I cleaned the room half-heartedly (secure in the knowledge that when I came downstairs in the morning, my Mum would have done it. All I have to do is say that I was willing to clean it up), and once I got upstairs, I was asleep practically instantly. Which meant I missed the 'We missed the bus, can we use your living room while we wait for the next one in an hour?' text from Steve until 1230 today.

      Well, the interview didn't seem to go badly. I've certainly had worse. These days, they're getting to be almost cookie-cutter, I'm usually pretty certain even before I go in what the questions I'm likely to be asked are.  Not that this is a bad thing, it means that the answers get more and more polished with each subsequent job that I go for. By the same token, it leaves me even more stumped if something else crops up.  That didn't happen this time though, I knew what the questions were going to be like, it was just a matter of which areas they decided to focus on.  We'll see how this goes, but I REALLY need out of BT soon.

      Fun in work yesterday. BT has recently announced that it has the technology, and will be blocking its web users from accessing child porn.  Some woman phoned up to complain about this on the grounds of internet freedom, and well, I was in one of those moods.... -- So, you want to complain that you can't access child pornography? -- No, I want to complain that it violates people's freedoms. -- But it's illegal in this country to even view the material. You want to allow others to commit this crime? -- But it's an issue of personal rights. People should be allowed to look at what they choose. -- Right. So you're in favour of people being allowed to look at images of children being sexually abused? -- That's not what I meant. -- But it's what you said. This sort of thing ruins childrens lives, and you want to allow it on the grounds of personal freedoms?  /Customer Hungup It makes it all worthwhile, really it does.  Have an interview with the Inland Revenue tomorrow, so shall see how that goes.

      Boring weekend, did nothing very much, and then got bored and miserable at the Cathouse, left just after 2am.  Saw The Day After Tomorrow today. Standard 'switch off brain and watch the pretty FX' summer blockbuster fare, although the wolves were somewhat crap in the CGI stakes, as in LXG bad.  Other than that, I've not really been up to a great deal. It's Bad Blood this coming weekend though, so that should be quite good. If nothing else, it'll give me a week's break from the constantly repeating cycle of Sunday nights.   I'm so bored right now.

      Got a call on Saturday asking if I was interested in getting 2 Wednesday tickets to Download for £50. Now, this was something I wanted to go to, but I had previously baulked at the thought of paying £45 or thereabouts for one band I really wanted to see (Metallica), one I wouldn't mind seeing (Slipknot), and 2 that I was somewhat indifferent to (Korn & Him). But at £25, well, that's worth it, because it's what you'd expect to pay for a standard metallica gig.  So, having got the tickets, I was then left with a spare one, since Dave couldn't go. Got that sold easily enough, and headed along to Glasgow Green after work yesterday.  I arrived there just as Him were taking the stage, so I watched their set, and it was somewhat of a mixed bag. The songs are pretty good, but the band seemed to be going through the motions somewhat, and the sound was utterly risible (this was to be a recurring theme throughout the day).   To elaborate on the sound, it would be clear for a while, and then muffled, then clear again. Almost as if there was some sort of automatic noise limiter in effect. If that was the case, then thank you Glasgow City Council, and thank you local residents (with one or two exceptions), for being a self-centred bunch of fuckheads.  Slipknot were up next, and they put in a good performance. There was a lot of energy in it, and I thought it was an improvement on the last time I saw them (Gig On The Green 2002). They've reached the stage in their career where they can play a decent length of set without having to add in filler tracks, and can even get away with leaving out some of their bigger songs. The sound seemed a bit better here.  After Slipknot, I met McLeary, who launched into a rant about the barrier system (there was an area at the front that was restricted to a set amount of people). Homosexuality in the form of a solid object, he called it, and I have to say I'm inclined to agree with him. If people can't behave sensibly in a festival environment, then frankly, they deserve to get injured.  Korn were due up next, and I wasn't overly impressed with them. But then I'm not overly impressed with them on record anyway. They put on a decent enough showing, but the set seemed somewhat top-heavy, with most of the big songs in the first half, which mean that my attention waned as they went on. Jonathan Davis did get the cheapest pop of the day for coming onstage playing bagpipes. Not very well, but playing bagpipes nonetheless.  Following this, I grabbed a bite to eat, as I hadn't eaten since breakfast that morning (6.30, fact-fans). And was promptly horrified at the cost of the food, verging as it was on the astronomical. £3 for a burger? £2 for a cup of Coke? And not even the good coke either, it was the UK stuff. Ludicrous, I tells ya.  And now for the main event, the reason I was there in the first place. Metallica. I missed the chance to see them play when they were last in Glasgow (8 years ago), so I was pretty excited about this. And they didn't disappoint.  Opening with 'Blackened', they set the tone for the rest of the evening, with a set full of the classics, played tightly, and with a decent level of between song banter, even if it does seem a little interchangeable between cities. The pyro was put to good use as they took full advantage of the setting sun and growing darkness. My only gripe is that they didn't play 'For Whom The Bell Tolls', or 'The Four Horsemen', but then again, there's only so much time they've got to fit in everything folk want to hear. The new material from St Anger sounds a lot better live than on record, as well.  2 and a half hours later, as 'Seek and Destroy' comes to an end, there's about 15000 people leaving, and all but the most hypercritical should have enjoyed themselves for at least part of the day.  As I left, I got handed a flyer for 'the new Wednesday rock night' in Fury Murry's. Which I found odd, since they'd cancelled Fletcher's just the previous day. My suspicions were correct, as they'd ditched him, and had known about it for 2 weeks without telling him.  Headed round to Barfly to New Flesh, and it was, to put it mildly, utterly dead, with all the other descriptions of corpsehood from the Parrot sketch being equally valid. That finished just after one, and I hamed it. I'm off work today, though, which means that I at least got a decent sleep.

       Out last night for Ruth's birthday. I knew I had work this morning, so I planned on leaving early, it was more 'showing face' than anything else.  Was actually a really good night, a whole lot of 'fine upstanding citizens' out and about, and much humour and banter from all concerned. Left at half one, ostensibly to try and get some sleep before work.  Turns out I'd have been as well just pulling an allnighter, as when I got home, I could get no sleep whatsoever, and thus I'm now sitting at 37 hours of non-stop wakefulness. The joys.  Work wasn't actually too bad, the day went quite quickly, and we were all arseing about on a grand scale, including going on break for 25 minutes to watch an argument break out amongst some people. By the end of it, all the ISC advisors on the whole floor were logged off and watching. And laughing.  Haven't decided what I'm gonna be doing tonight. I'm not actually that tired at the moment, but that will no doubt hit me not too much later on.  Right, I'm away. I have more to say, but now is not the time...

       Been listening to this for much of today (well, since I got home from work, at any rate), as the Prodigy album I was getting sent hasn't arrived due to Trillian crashing twice.     I have to say, it's really a fine album. Probably because it's a collection of reworkings of blues songs, so Tyler and Perry weren't allowed anywhere near a writing session. Actually, that's unfair. Tyler and Perry can write some damn fine stuff, it's when they allow the record company to parachute other songwriters onto the process that it all goes to shit.     But it's a damn good collection of good old-fashioned blues rock, which, let's be honest, is what Aerosmith do best. The Geffen-era output was okay, and it certainly revitalised their careers, but it wasn't a patch on the material they were coming up with when the Toxic Twins were loaded up to the brim with high-powered drugs.     Aerosmith have always been a double-edged sword to me. They were the first band that I ever got really into, way back in the early 1990s, but a combination of poor albums (Just Push Play, anyone?), and THAT concert in 1997 (a blatant contractual obligation concert, never before have I seen a band go through the motions in such a banal manner) led me away, and onto other stuff. But I've always had a soft spot for them when they're on form.    This album that I didn't pay for has been brought to you by broadband internet connections.

       Was out last night, wasn't a bad night out, but I got bored and tired far too quickly. I'm getting a bit sick of the Cathouse, to be honest. It's just...the same, all the time. These days, how good a night out I have is determined mainly by the people who are there. The club doesn't change. Now don't get me wrong, there are some damn fine nights I've had there, where I've danced like a loon for hours on end, and the music's been off the charts. But those are a lot fewer and further between these days.    I'm just a bit down at the moment. Not down, even, so much as confused. I've got some stuff going on in my head, and I can't get it shifted. I really have to make a decision soon, but if I leave it too late it'll be made for me. It may be made for me anyway. There's no real wrong outcome for this, just a good one or a better one. 8 or 2? Who knows?

       I'll keep this short and sweet.   Friday night - good night, had fun.  Saturday - ntl engineer arrives. All goes according to plan, but then the account doesn't set up properly. Leave it for a while, go into town. Meet Dave, Steve, Kat, and Roz, plus Heather who left early, in Rock Gardens (easily the best of Glasgow's 'rock' pubs). Good laugh, much joking about. Head off to the catty, but there aren't many people there that I know, and I'm tired, plus Steve and Kat are pished. Dave is Dave, as always.  Sunday - That's today. Phone tech support, and they give me a fix for the account non-startery. It works.    So, I now have broadband. It rocks. I can never go back to dialup. No more am I fearful of large files or overly elaborate websites.     Internet....do your worst.

       So, I installed an exhaust fan on my PC this afternoon. Just a cheap thing from Maplin's, but it'll keep the inside of the case a bit cooler for the longer times I expect it to be up and running for. And once I get Linux, then we'll see the true meaning of long continuous uptime...    It's only really temporary until I get a new case, as this one dates back to 1998, and I'd like to upgrade to a monster case (well, not monster in size, more in cooling and such like. And I'd like a few front USB ports as well).    But the main point here is that I managed to get it all going without having to call upon assistance from outside. Granted, it wasn't exactly difficult, but the intent was there.

       Decided that I couldn't really face going out tonight. Mainly because it's the Glasgow Fair weekend. (note to non-Glaswegian readers: Historically, all the heavy industry shut down for their workers to get 2 weeks holiday for the last 2 weeks in July. The first weekend of this featured a fair of sorts held in the city for those who couldn't afford to leave. Although the heavy industry's mostly dead and holidays are a lot more staggered and modern, the tradition remains, and thus there's a public holiday on Fair Monday, i.e. tomorrow)    So, yeah, it's fair weekend, which means that everyone's off work tomorrow (except those who work for BT, go figure), and the Cathouse will thusly be more packed than a tin of sardines that's been crushed under an industrial steam-hammer. Frankly, the Cathouse is a bit shit when packed to the rafters, and full of far too many arseholes, so rather than going out and getting annoyed by a swarm of cretins, I figured I'd just have a quiet night in.    Quiet nights in are much under-rated. It's good just to have your own company for a while and relax watching movies or pissing about on the internet or whatever. Plus, you're never more than a few feet away from bed, it doesn't require any effort to pass out through tiredness.    Watched Edward Scissorhands just there, and I'd forgotten how much I loved that film. Which is to be expected, since it's Tim Burton, and the only film of his that I haven't loved to bits was Planet of the Apes. All of his other stuff has been really great, and I need to pick more of it up on DVD.    Other than that, not done much. Headed down to Dave's last night, just hung out for a while with pizza and other such munchables. A good night, with all kinds of stupid banter. Sometimes I think we'd actually be real trouble if our minds were left to bounce off each other for too long. I've known this since the Napoleon theory and the extra episodes of The Bible though.     Right, offski.

       Spiderman 2. Dear god this movie is utterly fantastic. Saw it yesterday, and it's just about the best superhero movie that I've ever seen.    It avoids the pitfalls that most movies of this sort get snared by. There's actual character development, and no one character is overly dominant. The villain is believable without being overly cartoony (Green Goblin costume, this means YOU).    The special effects are better than the first (although Spidey swinging about the buildings is obviously CGI, but not as glaringly as in the original).    There is humour there, and it's knowing, without degenerating into spoof territory. Prime example of the parts of the film that had me grinning like a moron is of course the appearance of 'Snooty Usher', played by god himself, Bruce Campbell. Almost steals the movie on a grand scale, like he's halfway down the street with the film in a large bag labelled 'SWAG' before the cops arrive.    Despite everyone's criticism of Kirsten Dunst, I didn't find her that annoying, to be honest. She's the weakest link of the film, no doubt about that, but she's not necessarily weak, if you get what I mean. the worst of a good lot can still be quite good. And let's face it, if the opportunity presented itself, then aye, I would.    Away from the movies, it's just been another quiet week at work. my terminal seems to have a magnet on it, designed not to attract metal, but instead idiots who have one of the following flaws:          Don't speak English. Now I know we're in a multicultural society and all that tripe, but it is the only language I speak, so if you want me to understand you, then you'll communicate on my terms.       Can't work a simple IVR system. It said press three for billing, so you pressed one. What the fuck you mongo?       Have the brain power of an amoeba .     That's all for now. Now to go and figure out if someone knows more than they're letting on...

      So the Butler report's been released and it basically says that there were serious flaws in the intelligence that the UK government used to take the county to war in Iraq.  Blair now says that that's all well and good, but the war was still ok because Saddam's gone.  I KNEW he'd do this. Fucking slimy cocksmoking liar.

      So, that DVD I ordered from Play (Spiderman, fact-fans) still hadn't shown up after a fortnight, so I emailed them to see what was up. Less than 12 hours later, and they've emailed back to say that they're sorry it's missing, and it's now sold out, so they'll refund my car instantly. w00t. Makes up for the Post Office being thieving gypsy cuntweeds.  And I've ordered broadband. Provisionally due to be installed on the 24th of this month, so it's all looking good for a tenfold increase in connection speed. *crosses fingers*

      Not done much this week, mainly just working and similar such crap.  Gonna get myself broadband in the next couple of weeks or so, and seriously considering switching to Linux once I've done that.  Other than that, it's been pretty dull. Job still sucks, but I've been informed of a possible date of exit. Which would be 'teh rock'

      Yesterday wasn't as good as Saturday.  Turns out that my dog has an anal abcess. This means she's in constant pain, and has mild constipation. So the vet's given us some pills and antibiotics for her, which should clear it up in a week or so. It's kinda sad to see her like this, for as much as she annoys me almost all the time, I don't like to see her as miserable as she clearly is.   Being a dog, it goes without saying that she's having none of the pill-takery, and much spit-outery is in evidence. To get around this, I decided to wrap the pills in a little bit of cheese. Success! as it doesn't even touch the sides of her throat on the way down.  Elsewhere, went to the Cathouse last night, and on the way in, there was a very distinct smell of air-freshener. Turns out that this was because a pipe had burst the previous night and spilled its contents all over. Worryingly, it was a sewage pipe. I'm told a large amount of the staff had to get innoculated, so in a short while we can expect them to be complaining of Cathouse syndrome (it's like Gulf War syndrome, except with the same symptoms every week).  The night was mixed. The first 2 hours were great, there was stupid banter with all sorts (it's been decided that Slipknot should sing Sinatra while doing a kickline at their next concert - c'mon, it'd be funny...), and a decent length of conversation with Eilidh, which is all too rare these days with her normally living up in the field. But then she got sick and left, and I got bored and tired, and just generally fed up with everything.   To tell the truth, I've been feeling like this on and off for the past few months, basically since I got back from Las Vegas. I had such a fantastic time out there that Glasgow just doesn't seem to hold my interest the way it used to. It comes and goes, but the periods where I mope are more extreme, and the times when I'm truly happy are all too fleeting.  Got another 4 days at work starting tomorrow, and I'm just dreading it. The regular manager's back from her holiday, which means an end to the working environment of fun, and back to the constant struggle to get anything done with the 'would be pointy-haired if she was male' moron shouting all the time.  And someone can count themselves very lucky that I value someone else's opinion and wishes as highly as I do, because it's just saved them from extinction.

      I've been quite busy this weekend, which makes a change, it's nice to once in a while have a weekend where I don't just waste it by allowing myself to vegetate the whole time.  Started off by going over to the Barras market with Steve yesterday afternoon. Didn't buy anytyhing, but it was good just to look around and see what was for sale (and be inherently suspicious as to the legality of a large portion of the available goods - "Naw, these DVDs are pure legit, there's writing on 'em to tell you what it is an' all"). Walked into town, and I picked up the Michael Palin 'Around the World in 80 days' DVD set for £3.99, which was muchly bargainsome, and, like all proper versions, does not feature 'kung-fu loon' Jackie Chan. I mean really, I like Chan's movies, but there are certain roles that he should be kept the hell away from, and Passepartout (sp?) is one of them.  On the way back to the car, we ran into a throng of the sort that reminds why I hate Glasgow. Yep, the World Bigotry Championships had their Glasgow heat yesterday, going under the title of the Orange Walk. The joy of a bunch of intolerant fuckheads marching to celebrate beating some people of a mildly different religion in a battle 314 years ago, IN ANOTHER COUNTRY, while a few thousand neanderthals drag their knuckles along the ground supporting them and cheering them on. There's no need for it, and it really shouldn't be happening in this day and age.  Come the evening, having consumed a large steak, 4 of us headed out to watch Shrek 2. I enjoyed this movie a lot, much like I did the first one. It strikes the right balance of slapstick and pratfalls for the kids, and decent jokes and pop-culture references for the more mature audiences. The animation was absolutely top-notch, and may well be the final death-knell for 2D animated movies. They just don't have the same level of immersion that you get with the newest crop of 3D pictures.  I have only 2 gripes about Shrek 2:  1) The changing voices. This isn't really a dig at the movie in and of itself, more at Hollywood in general. Now, in this movie, Joan Rivers and Larry King have voice parts. But some assclown at the studio has obviously decided that we aren't culturally aware enough over here to know who these people are, so they've been overdubbed by Kate Thornton and Jonathan Ross. So we have a character who looks like Joan Rivers, and is acting like Joan Rivers (i.e bitchy and deserving of a long time - ideally the rest of eternity - in a pine box), yet is voiced by that daft bint who presents (and I use the word reservedly) Pop Idol. We're reduced to having the no-talent presenter of a no-talent show because we can't be trusted to know who is providing the voice in a film. Thank you Hollywood. Thank you very fucking much.  2) They've announced that there'll be a Shrek 3. And a Shrek 4. Maybe I'm just a little cynical, but I don't think they'll be able to keep the quality up and fresh for another 2 movies.  3) Hell, here's a 3rd gripe. The trailers prior to the movie. Around The World In 80 Days I've already spoken about (and never will again, with any luck), but the others were all about the destruction, nay obliteration, of my childhood memories.  Thunderbirds the Movie: Looks shite. Garfield the movie: Looks shite. Garfield in particular fills me with horror. The only possible saving grace is Bill Murray as the voice of the Garfield, and I still feel they should have retired the whole concept when Lorenzo Music died. (the day the music died? Sorry)  Post cinema, me, Dave and Eilidh all headed back to Dave's, and watched Monsters Inc. Again, a good movie, first time I'd seen it. Dave also had a magazine with a feature about the Hives, and asked me to autograph the bit where the guy who looks like me was pictured. Glad to oblige, fame at last.  This morning, I went to the early showing of Fahrenheit 9/11 (a 4th July special, if you will). I agreed with most of the politics behind it, but it seemed a bit contrived in places, and it was very much a movie of 2 halves. The first half was classic Michael Moore, political conspiracies and all that jazz, but the second half was pretty different, it switched to an anti-war emotive piece, as he went for the heartstrings. To be honest, the second half doesn't work as well as the first, and it lessens the impact of the film as a whole.   I think the criticism of Moore isn't as valid as the Republicans would like it to be. This isn't an objective piece he's made, it's his opinion. Yes, he presents facts, but he presents them in such a way as to support his points. But, if we're being entirely honest, that happens in all documentary pieces, albeit usually to a lesser degree. No film-maker can be truly objective, there's always a part of their subconscious that'll influence it. But I did like the quoting of Orwell at the finish, and the fading out to "Rocking in The Free World". Free world indeed.

       It's been raining here in Glasgow almost non-stop since late on Sunday. With the exception of the odd small period of dryness punctuating it, it's been near-torrential constantly.  Apparently, these are the after-effects of some big fuck-off hurricane that was out in the Atlantic about a week ago, but it's seriously fucking intense. We had the average monthly rainfall for August fall in 2 days.  Consequently, I've been getting soaked a lot.  Last day at BT tomorrow. Woo.

       In work today, I return from my lunch break to be told that I have to phone home urgently. I'm instantly filled with a palpable sense of panic, as it's almost unheard of for me to get such a message.  So I call home, to be answered by my mum telling me that the Inland Revenue had called me to offer me a job, but they could only hold it open until 2.30  So I call the IR, and they tell me that although it was a clerical post that I'd applied for, a job had come up in security, and would I be interested? About a nanosecond of thought later, and I realise that it's not BT, so yes, I would be interested.  Transpires it's a 3 month contract initially, but there's the possibility of extension. Still, it's away from BT, and it's 9-5, so my sleep pattern may return to some semblance of normality.  Start on Monday.

       The foot was a lot better when I got up this morning, but it's still be no means perfect though.  The camera arrived in the mail this morning (well, actually, it arrived by parcel force, but it was at the same time as the mail, so it counts), so I've been mucking about with that today, trying to get a feel of what exactly everything does.  Decided to head over to Comet to pick up some decent batteries and a charger. Car stalled when I tried to start it. Twice. Got it going the third time, only for it to cut out again at the end of the street. This should have beena  warnign sign, but nay, nay and thrice nay, I carried on. The lack of any real power in second gear was a bit annoying, and when I turned onto Clarkston Road, there was even less power. As in none. So I drift over to the side of the road, and try to get it started again. Nothing. Fuck.  Call up the breakdown people (thank christ I added that onto the insurance policy), and to their credit, they had a guy there within 20 minutes. And what happens? Why, the same thing that always happens in these situations. He tries it, and it works first fucking time. He'd been getting a lot of stuff like that, it was just the rain, apparently, so he sprayed some WD40 about to insulate something or other, and I was off.  Didn't feel like chancing it though, so I just headed the 200 yards back home. I'll get the batteries after work tomorrow.  And that's been my day. What fun.

       Well, I'm a clumsy oaf.  Walking down the stairs about ten minutes ago to get a bag of crisps, and fell down the last of them. This resulted in me going over on my left ankle, and as such, I sit here in front of the computer now, in constant pain, and having great difficulty walking. Excruciating doesn't even begin to describe it.  The end result of this is that I'm loaded up on painkillers, and there's certainly no way I'm going out tonight. I'll not be able to drive on this foot, unless I'm planning on using the clutch with my right foot (ain't gonna happen)  On the plus side, there's a decent thunderstorm just starting that I can watch / listen to.

       There are many ways to ensure that you're wide awake and alert in work of a morning. Watching DVDs until 3 in the morning, thus giving you less than 3 hours sleep, is not one of them.  So, yeah, been somewhat of a zombie today. Was fairly quiet in work, so that's not so bad, meant I could blend into the background, and skive a bit. I've noticed that, actually, over the 9 months I've been there, that if I just show up, sit there, do the job, and go home, making only the odd sarcastic / cynical comment along the way, then they don't even notice when it's a day that I turn up, sit there, do nothing and go home.  Was up at Steve &amp; Kat's on Wednesday, since it was Morgan's first birthday. Doesn't seem like a year ago that she was born, but the calendar reliably informs me that it is. A good evening's entertainment was had. And vegetarian food isn't actually that bad, in as much as something containing no meat can be good.  The Chris Benoit DVD that I'd ordered appeared yesterday, so that's all good. It's always amusing to see things reversed into Crippler Crossfaces.  Out to the catty tonight, I'm currently on a streak of 2 and 0 for nights out there that haven't sucked, which must be a record for recent times.  Bought myself a digital camera yesterday as well, which is something that I've been meaning to do for ages, but a decent sized bonus from work made it possible this month. Nikon Coolpix 3200, got it for £150 or thereabouts from Amazon, so I can expect delivery in 3-5 days, apparently. Got a 256Mb memory card as well. I was just gonna get the 128Mb card, but was talked into the big one by Brian Shannow, as only he can: "youll kick yourself later if you get the smaller card and run out of storage when some drunken bint on the landing whaps her chebs oot"  But yeah, that's pretty much it for me at the moment. Time for dinner.

       For many years, there have been two philosophies on how to motivate someone to achieve a goal. The carrot approach has argued that you should dangle the prize in front of the subject, so they can see what they aiming for, and this will drive them forward to achieve their goals.  The stick approach is harsher. It is designed to punish the subject for even the simplest failure, so that fear is what forces them to succeed, knowing that pain will greet them if they don't manage. Aversion therapy, if you will.  It turns out that this is not the true definition of carrot and stick theory. The Carrot and The Stick have been working in conjunction all along.  The carrot dangles in front of the subject as before, urging them to try harder. Not too hard, it says. It's not too difficult to get some carrot. Go on, you know you want to.  And then, once the subject has decided that yes, he does want some carrot, and is going to pursue it, that's when the stick joins in. The stick appears out of nowhere, and starts bludgeoning the subject upside the head, screaming maniacally all along. "Wanted some CARROT? Are you mad? What made you think you stood even the slightest possible chance of getting carrot? Go on! Get back into your miserable carrot-free life! Hah! Feel the power of the stick! Shattering dreams since the dawn of time! BWAHAHAHAHA!"  The stick then slinks back into the shadows, and a new carrot starts to appear on the horizon. The cycle repeats. Every. Fucking. Time.
