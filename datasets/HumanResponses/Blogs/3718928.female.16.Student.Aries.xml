       So.I first made my profile like a month ago, but I kind of forgot about it, until mike showed me his poetry one and I helped inspire his poem Albino Giraffe...haha good times.  Speaking of good times last night was great! Katy, Braden, Mike, and I went to see The Village, I dunno after seeing it I don't think it was scary at all, but during the movie, I'll admitt that Katy and I were hidding under my sweatshirt for a lot the scary parts but then in the end you're like what the f*?  Yeah but still it was fun because Braden and Mike were being halarious, I still don't understand what they were going on about with the leprachauns... ehhh who knows? After that we went to oberwise and katy and braden sucked in some helium and talked like the munchkins from wizard of oz... and then braden put a ballon under his shirt and just walked out... a little strange but whatever... then the most enlightening experiance of the evening.... Everyone  went  with me to the gas station and showed me how to fill up the gas in the car, because I had no idea- kind of pathetic but what can you do?  Well, I must say Katy has got skills because she got it exactly on 5 dollars, which was all I felt like filling it up - just enough so I could get home (I figure my brother can fill it up all the way later).  Ahh I still can't believe I finally got my license! Its pretty exciting for like 5 days and now it is wearing off...  Yep well thats about it, I really have no idea if I'll ever post again but I will probably just because I get bored easily.    much love *T*

      Well, I just got back from tryouts (day 2) and I must say that I'm extremely sore and out of shape, my vertical has dropped three inches.:.:.yiKes!  So now I have to bust my butt to get back to my former shape, and I really need to start to eat healthy, but I think I'll start that tomorrow.... Oh but some good news is that the cable is finally working again!! Saturday morning when we were getting our landscaping redone they cut the cable line and so I was doing this thing called reading, yeah so instead of watching the olympics on the tv, i read about them in the newspaper... i think my vocabular is expanding because of it. But yeah, i think i want to marry michael phelps--such a nice body and he's really tall which is always a plus and he's athletic and probably has got some extra cash... sounds like the perfect husband to me... oh and I'm sure he has a great personality....'""""'cleesh cleesh"''''" I'm out`'`'

      Alright, so I really did post again, cheers for me!  So basically right now life is decent, summers been nice, also busy, but thats winding down.  With volleyball I haven't gone through withdrawl or anything from being off two weeks so thats chipper too, family is same old- I still get blamed for everything but I know there are other people out there in this big world that have it a billion times worse so I'm not complaining.  Recently though, I've been really stressed out about college and volleyball and all that crap.  I know I want to play division one vball in college but I have noo clue what so ever where, and I just keep getting more stressed because all these people I know are already verbally committing or at least getting offered *cough Yanz cough* haha I'm just kidding -Jess I'm so proud of you my little knitly lion or whatever penn states mascott is!  You deserve this and good luck!!! But anyways yeah it sucks, i really wish i knew where i wanted to go , or at least knew if someone wanted me at their college, but the thing is i'm not doing anything about it.  People are telling me I need to call the colleges and find out myself, but I feel so stupid doing that and I get really nervous and my confidence drops when ever I even think about calling coachings or visiting... oh well I guess I'll just procrastinate, haha I'm praying I'll get some answers deleivered to me after sept. 1st (cross your fingers!!)    Anyway after getting all those stupid worries off my chest I feel better and on another note stuff with friends is going well.  I've been hanging out with a variety of people but lately its been with a kind of mixed up new group which is really fun.  Kayli calls it the Cleesh (cliques or something like that pronounced wrong) and its really cool because I've been just having a ton of fun everytime we get together.  Oh! so the last few nights i've been watching the butterfly effects, with kayli, colleen, katy, braden, and mike and seriously it is a really good movie, so don't write if off too soon!! Well i'm off to blockbuster to get some good scary movies, hopfully.  Oh and FOOTLOOSE has the best music ever- everyone go buy that cd ! it makes me so happy!!
