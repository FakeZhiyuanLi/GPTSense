      A school boy sitting at his desk was listening with some interest to the teacher lecture the class on the subject of "Clarity of thought, how to think".  When class was dismissed the boy left his pencil box behind.  He walked half way to his next class before it occurred to him to go back and get it.  When he re-entered the class room his teacher greeted him by saying to him "Ah, I see young man that you came back because you forgot your pencil box!"  "No Teacher" the boy replied. "I came back because I  remembered  it."   The difference is not great, but wonderfully significant.  The difference between the almost right word, and the right word.  One is pretty clear, and the other crystal clear.  Mark Twain said it this way:  "The difference between the right word and the almost right word is the difference between lightning and a lightning bug."  Clarity of thought can help us when we really need it, and the lack of it can destroy us when we are the least bit less than careful about it.  Consider this seemingly simple phrase:  "With all deliberate speed".  According to Roger Ebert: "Fifty years ago this week, on May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that "separate but equal" could no longer be the rule of the land. Its decision in the case of Brown vs. the Board of Education ended segregated schools and opened the door for a wide range of reforms guaranteeing equal rights not only to African-Americans but also, in the years to come, to women, the handicapped, and (more slowly) homosexuals.   The decision was a heroic milestone in American history, but it was marred, this new documentary says, by four fateful words:  "With all deliberate speed." Those words were a loophole which allowed some Southern communities to delay equal rights for years and even decades; the last county to integrate finally did so only in 1970."  The justice who wrote the opinion that was to be signed into law, what would he have given to be able to take back those 4 simple words?  I can imagine that it was some lawyer that read the language of that decision back then and decided that the word "deliberate" could be interpreted to mean that one should "deliberate" awhile before taking any drastic action to "change things around here".  I think that it is possible that the interesting (or creative) use of language by people in the legal profession is one of the main reasons why Americans say that they do not like lawyers.  I myself remember watching Professor Alan Dershowitz a man that I admire say something I thought to be a tiny bit frustrating during a TV interview.  He was part of the legal team that defended O.J. Simpson and he was asked if he thought that despite everything, did he really think that O.J. was really guilty?  Instead of saying yes or no, his reply was something similar to:  "I can think of many very persuasive reasons why a jury would find him not guilty".  Need I say anymore about the matter?  Perhaps it is so that the extra work that we have to go through to unravel what is being said to us that causes to get fatigued, and that contributes to the level of dislike of a certain class of people that we have.  Here are two simple words for you:  "Well regulated"  How much trouble can two simple words get us into these days?  Between the years 1979 and 2000 there has been a significantly consistent level of deaths by firearms in the United States.  About 30,000 annually.  These figures are remarkable in regard to the absence of any drastic fluctuation.  How would these statistics be impacted if the second amendment to our Constitution were not written the way it had been?   "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."   I can see how some people would argue that the terms "well regulated", and "Militia" are QUALIFIERS, and as such a judgment as to true necessity of a militia, and/or how "well regulated" it must be made and used as a determining factor as to the continuing restraint upon the infringement of such a right.  I can well understand that some people would argue that these are not qualifiers and that this right is simply guaranteed under the amendment.  I am persuaded to believe that any interpretation of this language is going to be influenced by an analysis of whose Ox is being gored and that sadly contributes little to the concept of clarity of thought.  When contrasted to the language used in the first amendment it seems a little less clear than it really should be:  " Congress shall make no law  respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances."   These few simple words:  "Congress shall make no law" are really quite unambiguous, and if you really think about it represent one of the greatest gifts ever bestowed upon a nation of people.  What would our lives be like today if a different set of words were used instead?  What would newspapers be like today?  Television journalism, the Internet, books and everything else that we rely upon for information but for a few simple words?  The Founding Fathers gave to us many great gifts including rights and liberties.  They were able to give us these things because of a great gift that they had.  They had (for the most part) the great gift of clarity of thought.   M J Soveign Editor
