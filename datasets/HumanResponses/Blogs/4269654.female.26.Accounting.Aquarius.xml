       Negative energy, don't we all have some of this within? I would think we would have to considering all of it that surrounds us. Is there a way to completely block it out and if so will it make me a happier person. You see, I am a fairly happy person. I enjoy laughing and being silly and letting the inner child in me come out to play every so often.      So last night I and a few friends were having a little get together. Ya know some jokes a few bottles of wine couple hands of cards. The usual. Well I had heard this news story on the radio earlier in the day that just made me think....wow....Weird. Crazy. So let me enlighten you guys on this rather odd and extremely disgusting news tidbit that fell into my lap while driving.         In some state that I'm unsure of last week there was a dentist who had his license taken away from him for injecting his "happy juice" into the mouths of his un-suspecting patients, telling them it was a dental rinse, and then asking them to swallow it. Well, apparently a few of the poor women this happened to knew what it was they had just tasted and got together and sued him. Upon a search of the dentists office they found several syringes in his desk drawer full of said "happy juice". YUCK!      Ok so the point to that was... my boyfriend walked in the room where me and my friends were all hanging out after he had come out of the bathroom and wiped his wet hand on me. Triggering me to think 'ewwww he just wiped pee on me' which then triggered me to think of the news story I had heard earlier cause it has to do with bodily fluids. So I tell my friends the story, mainly to gross them out as it did me. Then this guy, we will call him John. ( not my friend) starts telling me what a negative person I am and how he doesn't even listen to things like that because he doesn't allow negative energy to consume him. Okay, I am thinking John is a complete fucking moron. I was just sharing a news story. Then he goes into how he has this forcefield around him that no negativity can withstand. To quote him " It would be like a spitball hitting an airplane." What the fuck, dude??? By this point everyone is confused now and they all we all just keep saying, Huh? Huh? What? I'm confused.      Sometimes I just do not understand where people are coming from. Maybe someone reading this will understand where he was coming from. If so let me know. Until next time---

      I would like to start out with a little explanation as to who I am and why I have created this little corner of my world. Although, I feel like who I am will probably reveal itself to you readers through these blogs more than I could ever explain. So on to why I have created this blog then shall we? I stubbled across this the other day while 'taking a little break' from work. You see I always read the Real World/Road Rules Blog spot. I just love both of those shows, it truely is an obbsesion. So somehow I ended up here and I thought to myself; this would be a neat thing to do. I can truley express real feelings on all kinds of subjects and the worse thing that will happen is no one will read it. Not so bad. I also could use the typing practice and learn a little more about my computer, also. So I am going to learn as I go, hopefully I wont do too bad. I do feel like I should tell a little basic history about myself though so here it is. I was born in Birmingham, Alabama where I grew up living a twisted version of a somewhat normal life until I was 16. At that age I got married ( yes I know 'married at 16, lives in Alabama' I am not that stereotype. Though I do meet all the qualifications!) and stayed married until I was 19 and living in Tampa, Florida. I left my husband and came home to Alabama. Then I met someone and left for Cleveland, Ohio, where I resided for three years and returned back to Alabama at the age of 21. For the past five years I have been living with my boyfriend in our house here in Alabama. I have had all types of jobs and many reasons for the choices I have made. Some not very good ones I will have to admit. However, I would not change a thing. I am mostly happy with the person I am today and where I am at. I do fight inner-battles constanty it seems and struggle with the state of the world and the people in it among many other things. I do not want to overwhelm anyone so thats where Im stopping for today. Till next time------
