      Ghosts of the Morning          If she only knew, if only I could have showed her, she was so much  more then she thought she was, every morning when she rolled out  of bed, I would watch the curves of her body as she dressed, and  though a word was rarely said     The most important thing in a day, the unspoken words, the way I felt  when I knew I walked in your eyes, it's all gone, all that's left is the  memories, and ghosts just can't hold me the same.    If only she knew that bowl of cereal she brought him was so much more  then a quick meal, if only she could have seen him looking at her, she  wasn't looking back, but in just being there she was more then she  thought she was.    The most important thing in a day, a missed glance, the way he felt when he knew he walked in your eyes, it's all gone, all that's left is the memories,  and ghosts just can't hold him the same.    If only she knew that silly smile was all because of her, little blonde curls  made up with ribbons and bows, a constant fight to be on time, but none the less, a childish grin because love is what made up the morning mess.    The most important thing in a day, a missed smile, the way she felt when  she knew she walked in your eyes, it's all gone, all that's left is the memories, and ghosts just can't hold her the same.    Ghosts aren't real, and we all know that these phantoms can't replace you, but it's better then nothing, and it's the only way we can hold on to the parts  of you that we all need. I get the cereal now days, and make the ribbons  and bows, but it's not really my hands that hold the bowl, and phantasmal fingers guide that brush.    The most important thing in a day, a missing person, the way we felt when we knew we walked in your eyes, it's all gone, all that's  left is the memories, and ghosts just can't hold us the same.    ~Chris~  Thats my post for now, I'm heading off to michigan for 4 days to see a friend.. have  fun all.

      Well at least thats over, birthday was yesterday, went to work, had cake, bleh bleh bleh. Anyone Remember the maigc of a birthday when you where younger, when it was like a week away, and you just couldn't stop thinking about what you might get? hoping htat you would get the one big thing on your list, and then wondering who would get you the one thing you forgot to put on your list, but wanted anyway, Having a big party with aunt's uncles, cousins, that sort of thing.  those were magical times. Now it's just that your a year older,... nothing more... oh well, maybe next year will be better, oh I did find an interesting quote though "Birthdays are funny beacuse even though you are a whole year older, you are still only a day smarter."  Oh did I mention my lovly wife (x-wife soon enough) sent me a birthday card, bless her soul, she offered to make me the strawbery cake that I like so much, the one she made me every year for my birthday, how sweet. here's my take on that matter, here let me RIP your soul out, but I'll still make you a cake..... I'm sure it's all just the normal game she's been playing with me for years now. But still it sucks. And it still bothers me, it must be nice to be over someone and know that theya re not over you, that way you can take pot shots at them, and even if they don't respond, you KNOW that you got to them.  Anyway I leave for michigan in 2 days I may or may not post again before the trip, not that anyone reads this anyway.

      Ok post numero two (or something like that)  Well this morning I got up and started making a bag lunch for my 10 year old boy, as his class is taking a trip to stirbridge village ( colonial villiage) and I came to realize that I didn't have any juice boxes for him to take for his lunch, so I said to myself "self this isn't a problem I'll run down to the town market thats about 100 yards away and grab some". Well, I get into the store and I grab the apple juice boxes (way over priced) and I go to stand in line, it's pretty busy for this time of morning, about 10 or 15 people about, so there was a small line, and I'm standing there minding my own bussiness, you know, reading the headlines from star, the enquierer and so forth, oh and cheking out which magizine had more on the cover about sex then the others.. and all of a sudden there is a hand on my shoulder, so I turn and it's roger.. in case you all didn't see in my last post my wife of 6 years (11 year relationship) took off to live with another guy, but I also found out that she was sleeping with another guy at her work (witch was this same small market, and the guy's name of course was roger) so there I am, caught in a torrid of things to do, I turned and he asked me "so hows laura" (laura is my x-wife) now I'm thinking to my self I wonder how many times I can hit him before he stops moving, but instead I allowed self control to win out and simply said "get your fucking hand off of me or I'll shove it up your A$$!, which he did of course and slinked off into the back of the store, still it left me very angry and wondering how much of this shit I can take before I finially snap. Then I brought my kids to school and went and picked up my bike (84 honda shadow 500) at the shop, and headed to work. Thats all for now, tune in next post for more from my sorta life.

      A friend suggested that I start a blog in order to "help vent my frustrations", so  Here goes, this is my blog, here I will post everything from random thoughts to things that are going on in my sorta life. I am a (almost) 27 year old computer tech, I have 2 children, a 10 year old boy, and a 6 year old girl, I had a wife of 6 years, until about 2 months ago when she decided that the mom/wife life wasn't as appealing as she thought it would be. I own my own home (for now) in am a small town man at heart. Well thats all I can think of for now, I'll post again soon, oh I'll put a pic of my ugly mug up here as well.
