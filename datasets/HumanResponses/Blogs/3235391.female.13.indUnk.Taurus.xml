      Grr.....my landlords just wanna piss me off don't they? Well, my dad was okay today. I'm not as mad with him as I was yesterday. But my mum...grr. All she wants to do is wallow in self pity and scream at me. She thinks that she's the only one with a troubled life. But because of her troubled life (and of course my fathers), I have a troubled life. See, my father was raised in a middle class family where he was tought that love just gets in the way of everything. So the only we he shows his emtion is by screaming them at me and my fellow tennent when it all just gets to hard to keep inside. This is a...lets just call it...yearly volcano. My mum came from a REALLY high class and rich family who spoiled her rotten. And now, they are both fighting and on the verge of a divorce (which I hope so badly for) and they're pulling me into it. Telling me to take sides. Pissing at each other behind they're back to me. I hate it. I hate them. I hate life.  The landlords want rent....taliho!

      Hehe. Thanks for helping me make this Sarah. This is awsome! But today wasn't. Grr... My landlords (parents) are trying to mold me into something I'm not. They want me to be smart and perfect in math and science. They just don't get me. I don't think they want to. I think I scare them because I'm different. I really want to get away from here. Far away. To a place where people who actually love me are. God I can't wait till I'm older. I'm gonna move outta here the second i turn 18. Oh and my public speaking. Grr.... I'm just never good enough for my mum OR my teacher. it drives me insane. Why can't they just settle for what I can give them. I don't even want to do this. And dad. Man!!!!! He's not gonna eat for two days just because I couldn't control the nature of traffic and couldn't get home to finish my schoolwork. See if I care dad. You can just go melt in molten lava! Just to warn you. Since I seen really perky and possitive in real life, theres gonna be lots of bottled up emotions that I'm gonna spill here. Lots of...mad stuff. blah. I dun care. The only person whos gonna have my link are Sarah and...me. hehe. Ta for now  ~Prakruti

      I feel so left out. My mother is so serious when my bro was at school. But the second he stepped into this house it was "Oh my little baby!...". For once I want to feel loved. The only things my parents say to me is that I'm a  complete disapointment. It makes me...sad, that I can't be the one, for once, to put a smile on my parents faces.  I had a nice buble bath and seriously considered drowning myself in it, just like Sarah. But once I read her post describing what she had did. I don't know what happened. I thought about it and figured, if I killed myself, then what will I miss? My first kiss, my sweet sixteen. I'm guessing Sarah figured all this out ('cept the kissing part)  after  she found she didn't have and bubbles. She has a tough life, I have to say, but if only she knew what I go through. My family is torn apart and it was all because I was born. We came to Canada and I apperantly changed.   I have my public speaking competetion tomorrow. I really love doing this. The rush you feel when everyone is looking at you, it is unbeleivable. And your thinking to yourself, "they're all here to listen to me". Last time I won, there was a smile on my parents face one day. The next day it was "Prakruti, did you finish science?". I hope I can find someone who really does appreciate me. Not because I'm they're friend or they're my friend. Which is usually the case. I don't know, I think I'm being to picky. Oh well. I have like this mind that is just way, way, way to passionate. Love is like the ONLY thing I can ever think of.  I want to get a good rest before tomorrow. I'll write and tell you what happens!

      Hiho. Let me just start of wit this. MY MUM IS JUST...grr. She just wants me to be perfect. She even yells at me if I don't do things according to "the plan" she and father made for me when I was born...study, study, get good grades, don't have a life, get good grades, be a loner, get good grades, get into med school, get good grades, get married and.......get my kids to get good grades. They don't realise me as an individual just as a younger version of low life...nerd. Grr.  I have toastmasters tomorrow. I have to talk in front of people on my speech. Ah. the wonders of my mother. Why does she have to make me talk in public. I have good social skills! I have changed schools since the past 8 years, I know how to talk to people I don't know. Ah dash it all. I'm gonna go practice.

      I went over to Sarah's today. It was SO good to actually see her. Her sisters boyfriend picked me up in his car and my mum was like "Oh my. I am NOT sending you with him!" I was scared because well...it was scary.  We saw Peter Pan. Oh god I LUV Jason Isaacs. Witty, charming, who wouldn't like him? :D Sarah let me borrow like 5 million books (okay well five). But I let her borrow my bible so we're even.  She's leaving for Whitehorse on Monday. I feel so sorry for her cause its like, 2 weeks with mum for company. *Shudders at very though*. I wanted to sleepover but when I asked my dad he said I had enough fun and it was time for me to come home and study...sad excuse dad, sad excuse. You know what I found? When Sarah and I are like "virtually" talking on msn, we can talk about anything. But when we are actually around each other "physically" we can't talk about anything THAT depressing. Its kinda weird but i guess we're not really morbid people, or we both want to seem as the non-morbid type. Ah well. I'm gonna go since nothing else of importance happened today. I might change my layout since I'm just not feeling it. Well, I'm kinda jelous of those two BABIES having their first kiss when I can't even get a guy to talk to me let alone kiss me. But I want my first kiss to be special with someone special. Specifically Ronil. I will write more on him later tonight since my wrist is in pain 'cause I'm using the main comp and not the laptop since the laptop has a nicer keyboard. :D The landlords want rent....taliho!

      As I did my "thang" on my audio blog yesterday. My landlords are fighting...again. I think it really got to my mum. This morning she wouldn't talk to me. And then later when I tried to make convo with her ( I asked where I should stick my TEMPORARY tatoo tat Sarah A. gave me for my b-day) and this was her exact words..."PRAKRUTIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I awakend the spirits in her.   I honostly don't want to really awaken the spirits in her. That's because she used to be abusive. Not like, i got black eyes and stuff...no, no. She gave us slaps when she was mad at me and my bro. Which was especially usual with me since I was like a minature rebel. Now I'm just a...rebel. Anyways, I got really scared. In fact, I still am. And...Sarah please tell me your not going to the aquarium cause I NEED like seriously NEED to get outta this house before I get hurt. Or just really pissed. And plus I need to see your trampoline...:D. I'll write more later if there's something worth writing. Taliho!

      Wow. God really does see me out of the corner of his eye, (sometimes). Here I'll explain it to you. You see, in my public speaking, there was a first, second, and third plase winner who got recocnized. The first and second place winners go to the final district competetion and if and of those two get into a freak car accident and dies, then third place winner goes in their place. Now I know your wondering which one died cause I'm going to district baby! *Ahem* well back to what I was saying. Neither Zaarah nor Ray died, but I hoped dearly that they could've plundered the depths of hell. No, no. You see what happened was, the VICEpresident of the optimist club saw me speak and found it , and I quote, "utterly revloting that I got toped by a girl who couldn't even remember to say her name." Hehe. Zaarah is going DOWN.   So the district level competetion is in Seattle. I am going there on a plane with, Ray and Zaarah. They can snog their heads off while I actually put my time to some use and read my beautiful book which has now become my bible "A great and terrible beauty." (More on this later). I am going to have a roommate and stay in a hotel. Of course my parents will be there but not all in my face going "Prakruti do this!" and "Prakruti do that!". Score! I'll show everyone that I DO have talent. There's going to be a banquet as well, like one of those semi formal banquets your brother goes to at New Years with his "med school buddies" and comes home drunk.   I have more good news...SARAH IS BACK!!!!!!!! I am just beyond happy. I read her blog. She seemed really happy to be back. I suppose being stuck in a car with your parents for 4 days straight gets to you. She gets me! She read my post and she understood what I meant. I thought that even she wouldn't get it! I feel so...I don't know. I feel happy. She understands that being needed is a good, nay, great feeling. It just makes you go "Wow you like me...you really like me!". Shes right we do have our own way of getting the message across without useing somewhat complete sentences.   Okay, now I shall tell you about my new bible. "A great and terrbile beauty". I know what everyone who reads my blog is thinking. What about Harry Potter? Well I like Harry Potter, yes, but I don't feel the pain of an enitre community depending on me to survive. In this book, the four main charecters make an oath. They say what their heart desires most. And all of them say what my heart desires.    ~*~  "To find true love." "To be beautiful." "To be too powerful to ignore." To understand myself."  ~*~  So as I said, Ray and Zaarah can snog each other senseless on the plane while I connect with my fictional soul sisters. As long as they don't suggest a threesome. *Shudders at the very thought*.   I should really get back to my work. Not that I'm working, just reading fanfic. hehe. Well, bye!  1:22 (later in the day)  Do you ever have that feeling where your being controlled by everyone around you? Like you don't have ANY say in anything you do. I really hate this feeling but apperantly I'm going to have to live with it until I'm like....married. I just wish Prince Charming would come and carry me away QUICKLY.   1:24   Do you also ever have that feeling that some people are your friends just cause your rich? I really hate bragging about myself but my family really is rich. And I don't know, I think Ashley just likes me because of that.   1:25  Do you feel that sometimes your being watch. I swear my house is like completely haunted! *looks around nervously).  1:26  Do you sometimes feel like you need to get away from your family even if just for a week. Just hav some time for yourself? *gives time for readers to think*. I do to....Sarah take me to Chritina Lake!!! (Is it Chritine or Chirtina....I confused.)  1:27  Do you think that sometimes you need to buy premeire ticktes to Harry Potter POA ahead of time. I shall go buy it...I'm going with Sarah to see it right?  Alright I'll right more later!

      I got third place. I suppose thats good. But I know I was the best there. I should have gotten first place. Instead, idiotic Zaarah got it. The judges picked her cause she was loud. And second place...Ray. I could just squeeze him sensless. Not that he has any sense in him that is. I wasted my time there when I could have spent those precious minutes with Ronil. He's falling for Jayna. I know it. I know it because life is just not going my way. Now, I'm really gonna go hurt myself. Life has no meaning. Just a puppet for my parents and a fake happy smile for my friends. I'm breaking, I'm broken. No one needs me anyways. What good am I to the world? Just a couple of good answers to some disturbingly annoying questions. I want to run. This is why I like soccer so much. When I run, I feel freedom. No one controls me when I run. No one can control me after I die. I'm scared of these thoughts. I don't really know what to think of them. No one understands me, so no one to talk to. Sarah has gone...somewhere. I'm eagerly waiting for her to come. Check how well my spelling on here is and make me laugh away my misery. Thats what shes best at.  I have to go help mother. Bye.

      MY DAD IS SETTING UP MY LIFE FOR ME AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HIS PLANS ARE!!! Its scary. He said I don't have enough time to think. Not that he's giving me time. And even if he did, he'd merge and mold until he would be satisfied. Doctor scary thought but MED SCHOOL...even scarier thought.  I really want to be a special needs teacher you know, help other kids. But my dad said I can persue that "rifraf" as a hobby. Sometimes he just makes me so boiling mad.  I know his heart is in the right place but sometimes I wish he'd be like a normal dad. The one who tought me how to play b-ball when I was going through my TomBoy stage. Instead he bought me pink frilly dresses with laces. And now all he talks about is "the future" and "my role in it". Its scary. I'm gonna stop ditching on my father and turn to another big issue at hand...SARAH IS LEAVING ME!!! She's going to....a place...far away...VERY far away...TOMORROW. :'(. It's evil really, the time I need her most she's going. The final round of Public Speaking is coming up and well....there's lots of stress in this kinda stuff. Its sad really. Truly it is. But ah well...I'll tell her when she comes back.  Thats all I can think of wirth writing right now. But if and when I think of something else I'll come and share it. TutTut and Fare-well!
