          Days that is...       Okay, well, there you go. Is this a good way to kick it all off? I suppose it's as good a time as any. Actually, it's a  worse  time than at any point up until now. At least it's got the potential to be that. Very much a "coming at you from behind" way of looking at it, that's for sure, but conceptually, we're talking about hoping for the worst at this point. LOL Sometimes I wonder why they wouldn't let me write any of the lyrics. You just have to remember it was straight ahead Rock n Roll, Wild Thorn Style. No one wanted to get too  deep  wit it. We weren't RUSH for God's sake. We'da kicked their  ass !  LOL Okay, slow down there buddy... keep a lid on it for a bit. Folks is just tryin' to get ta know ya. Gonna scare everyone off with your crazy talk. I do have to admit that I am quite excited about the whole concept. And by that I don't mean any of the concepts we've covered here so far tonight. Have I lost everyone about yet? I guess part of that is by design, part is just doin' what I do, part is just me bein' me (and those  are  two different things.) It  does  of course make sense to  me , and frankly, in my opinion, it's pretty damn sweet. The main hope, which is really probably the core of what  all  of this is all about, is that someone will find it just interesting enough to stick around just long enough and be just intelligent and cool enough to unravel it, tune in, lock on, and ride the vibe with me. It'll be a scream.... whaddaya say?  And that, Ladies and Gentlemen, is what they call the Hook. Getcha? Lemme know. I'm pretty sure I'll be here for a while. But hey, right now, I gotta go.  See ya!

       There are times when certain things happen that fermet a rant from somewhere deep inside that  absolutely  has to get out. Well, one just popped. And away we go...      I turned on the TV tonight to one of the most shockingly cheesy programming nightmares ever to throw images against my eyes. Now, I watch a lot of television, way more than I should. You can ask anyone that knows me; it's a fact. Plus, at my core, despite my reluctance to admit it, I'm a sci-fi tech-nerd geek. Point is I've seen more than my share of cheese. What I saw tonight took the cheesecake. And it was more than bad: it was unnervingly shocking. I'll explain as best I can.      Now I happened to tune in with about 10 minutes left in the show, so I can't admit to having a completely firm grip on the details of the plot. Apparently, some evil tech-nerd terrorist had kidnapped the daughter of a prominent, public figure (he appeared to possibly be a senator or high-stakes businessman or something). Being the evil tech-nerd terrorist that he was, he had created a website on which he was posted the live video of his victim, struggling while strapped into a chair. The display on her father's computer screen was captioned "Heather Cam 2001." The whole thing looked to have been recorded on low quality video tape and produced down at the local independent station. Bad lighting, bad cut scenes, unrealistic sets, stiff and predictable dialogue. Horrible writing and direction. It wasn't a case of "it was so bad it was good" that kept me watching... it was so bad I simply could not believe it had made it on to TV. What could this hideous, shoe-strung-together piece of crap be? Ladies and gentlemen, those of you with weak intestinal fortitude may not wish to continue, 'cause this is where it got really scary for me.      Walker, Texas Ranger. Are you effing kidding me?  Walker, Texas Ranger?  Are you serious!!?? Now, I've never watched the show, as I'm not a Chuck Norris fan, and it just sounded like a bad concept from the very beginning. But this thing was on the air for a number of years, wasn't it? Wasn't it even a hit of some proportion? Certainly it had somewhat of a name-brand recognition. How could this be? What I was seeing was made with seemingly no consideration for originality, budget, thought, or storytelling. Didn't this show even have a budget?      We cut to Walker, walking in the dark through a foggy, industrial storage-tank-looking facility, apparently hot on the heels of the evil tech-nerd terrorist. We cut to an "on the scene" reporter, with a video inset of the live webcast. This reporter is apparently on a completely different "scene," as she's in the daylight, standing in front of a building. She watches the live feed along with us on a graphic inset. "Ladies and gentlemen, there she is, this is completely horrifying" she tells us. Why they sent a reporter out to the street to describe the webcast instead of having the lead anchor at the desk do it is beyond me. They have a bigger screen back at the anchor desk for us to see, they wouldn't have to pay for the live remote, and it's a known fact that we trust and empathize more with the anchorman than with the roving reporter anyway.       Cut to a bar full of people, nervously watching the live reporter's pulitzer-prize winning effort unfold. Cut back to Walker, still searching the industrial site in the foggy darkness. Cut to a closeup of the webcast itself, with the despairing victim whispering "I love you Daddy." Cut to her father, watching on his laptop, caressing the screen gently with his fingers, as if he was caressing her face. I can't emphasize enough the very low, almost crude, home video-taped quality this all had to it. I think they blew their whole budget on that needless remote "on the scene" crew and didn't have any money left over for the actual shooting of Walker, Texas Ranger. Cut to the evil tech-nerd terrorist's hideout, which really could have been shot in Chuck's garage. Our villian is sitting at a desk in a dark room about 2 feet from our damsel in distress, typing  something  on his own keyboard with no monitor, although there were various monitors mixed into the outrageous assortment of tech gadgetry, blinking lights, and tangled wires that filled this den of wicked, twisted brilliance. Cut back to Walker, still searching. In fact, I'm pretty sure this is the same footage we just saw of him. Cut back to the bar full of trembling people. Cut back to the shocked reporter. Cut back to the concerned, screen-caressing father. Man oh man, the tension is really building.       Cut back to the den of twisted brilliance, where the distraught heroine pleads with her captor. "Sorry," he says, as he gets up from his chair, apparently finished tapping his doctoral thesis out on the keyboard, "I'm already running late." As he heads for the door, we get a close up of one of the monitors and see a clock counting down from 2 minutes. Uh oh. How will she ever escape with her life? It was so nerve-wracking! In a blazing, triumphiant moment that was ruined only by it's utter predictability, the evil genius opens the door, and is kicked in the head by Walker, Texas Ranger. Hooray!      With the clock at 1:45, Walker and Evil G engage in battle. Walker administers upwards of 15 kicks to his head, stomach and back, but it's not enough. The evil nerd-terror tech guy is apparently Evil G, Oklahoma Ranger or something. Of course there is the potential that earlier in the show it was revealed that he drank some secret concoction of his own making that gave him Ranger-esque abilities, and frankly I wouldn't put it past that being just the case. Cut to the girl. Cut to the clock (1:25). Cut now to a close up of a rifle, which will presumably be fired when the clock counts down. Cut to the reporter on the street watching the webcast, where the Okie and the Texan are locked in mortal combat in front of the girl. Cut to the clock (:45). Cut to the nervously hopeful bar. Cut back to the fight.      Do I need to go on? The mere fact that los Rangers were fighting in front of the girl,  directly in the line of fire,  made it all to obvious how this abortion was going to come out. Our man could barely hold his own against Evil G., and it was one lucky twist that threw the villian into the screaming bullet's path just as the clock arrived at 0:00, and the day was saved.      It's scary to me. To think that enough people watch this with enough regularity to keep it on the air for years... enough people to make it a hit! How could this be possible? Every year we're forced fed more of this happy horse shit, and I for one started choking on it a long time ago. This was the bottom of the barrel for me. To think that Americans in general, overall, as a whole, are accepting what's being doled out, the absolute putrid filth that is being passed off as entertainment... well it just makes me think that people in general, overall, as a whole are at a much lower level than I thought.       So anyway.... did you guys see Friends last night?       A person  is... can be... smart.  People  are stupid.

        Whew! Made it. Okay, okay... you can all relax now. Here I am at 38.     I'll have to add more to this one later... maybe as my observations about me at 38 occur.

         Today we're going to see if  perceived  dilemma turns into an  actual  dilemma. You see, I absolutely have to post today (in order to keep the chain of "2 to...," "1 to...," alive, right?) but I don't really have anything set to say. Nothing I have to get off my chest or anything. So this may just turn into a rambler, which may not be all that good for business. Could be especially hurtful for a burgeoning business such as this.  On the other hand, some of my best stuff has come "off the cuff," so maybe we'll be all right and the worry rendered unnecessary. Let's hope. Keep in mind that while "Luck is not a factor" is a kick ass quote, there is a lot of power in "hope springs eternal," and it does not invalidate the first quote in any way. All I'm saying is it's not a bad thing to hope -- you just can't   hope   instead of   do  .       It is actually 1 to 38 right now -- and I'm okay with it. Just in case anyone was wondering. I know I know, 38 ain't really one of the   big ones,   but every one of them these days seems a little harder to take than it should. Remember when you were a little kid, and your birthday seemed to be on par with Christmas or something? It really seemed to be a big deal. Like it was   YOUR   day, and everyone knew it, and acted like it. Gifts, well wishes, phone calls... I guess it really doesn't make sense to expect that kind of tradition to continue and to be extrapolated into the present day. Think about it in relative terms, like inflation: the little, simple things that bring so much joy to children just don't cut it for grown ups. Adults are way more complicated and jaded than that. If we were going to give adults the Royal Birthday treatment the way we do for children, we'd be talking about wads of cash, drugs, blow jobs and sports cars being given away freely. Now, none of that sounds too bad does it? Well, that's because you're thinking of it as your birthday. If you come from a very rich, promiscuous and tolerant family, maybe that  is  your birthday. Wouldn't  that  be sweet?      Now I don't want to get on a big downer here, but no, these days birthdays are not anything at all. I don't expect to be getting any cash, drugs, blow jobs, or sports cars tomorrow. Not even a hand job. Now I know what I said earlier about "hope," but that hope sprung a leak many moons ago. I'll be lucky to even get a card... maybe from someone at work. I'll treat myself to a steak or something especially good for dinner (but what's better than  steak? ) and make sure I get "extra" stoned (if I can remember by the time I get close), and that'll be me at 38.       And so, I'll go ahead and say it did  not  turn into an actual dilemma. No problem at all in fact.  Judge away, judgers.
