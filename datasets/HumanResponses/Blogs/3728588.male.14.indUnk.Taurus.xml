       urlLink HaloMods - Your Halo Modding Source  -yea, the sites been revamped and everything has been reskinned and updated.  also, over at  urlLink   , they have a new cover story about the civilian warthog. That's about as close to a fan fiction as i ever want to get Traci and Shannon... anyway, my girlfreind (possibly ex) is away at camp for a month, and then is moving to Chicago. I have the best timing...  The Lawn Nomes are attacking with their mustard bombs, see all you crazy people later! :)

      i don't know why, but all of a sudden, I don't care about people moving, i don't care about camp, or my friends I made this year. I feel stangely detached, and i really don't give a shit. if people want to hide stuff from me, so be it, I'm gonna live my life, and i don't give a crap what you say.  so anyway, i went and got my second copy of homeworld last night, (yea, i said second) The first one was so scratched up my cd tray didn't recognize it, but while i couldn't play it, i made a few badges for the game,  GO UNSC ODST!!! no, not football, united nations space command, orbital drop shock troops... i r a dork I was searching around for anything homeworld 2 related, and found the sierra forums, thier pretty cool, got lots of nice artwork and concepte. if you look around, you could find a lot of nice mods. and that brings me to my next point. there is an alaming number of people who don't know what the word mod means. I'm not explaining it here, but how can so many people be so oblivious to something when it's in every game and cell phone on the market. Geez.   urlLink    so anyway, I'm gonna go play homeworld...

      Ok, it's my first post, and the best part is that i don't know what i'm supposed to be writing here. Oh well... So anyway, school's offically out now, kind of bittersweet if you ask me, considering my girlfriend is moving and all, but i'm sure you all didn't come to listen to complain about my personal life like in some girly journal thing. Trust me, I'm not going to talk about my social problems and my social life... so if i'm not talking about that, I'll go right into what i'm writing this whole thing about, what i find on the internet, and it's relevance to myself and you... no, really, it's crap that I found on the internet that i'm going to share with you because you were so curious that you actualy clicked on the link to come to here... so, moving on, I was just surfing around last night, and found this music website with all these songs. Apperently, this guy writes songs for movies, games, and for pleasure, but the best part is that he's got Halo remixes! woo-hoo! for some reason Master and Chief reminds me of the last day of school, but go figure.  And that brings me to the next website,  see, i'm kind of a hardcore, would-wait-in-line-for-weeks-in-the-rain-just-to-get-a-copy-of-Halo2 kinda guy. So, now that you know that, you will soon realize that a good deal of my links will have to do with Halo in some way... here's some of the Halo related junk floating around on the vast wasteland that is the internet:  urlLink www.edgen.com/music/  - that music site i was talking about  urlLink http://halo.bungie.org / -Halo general updates  urlLink www.redvsblue.com alright, i think like 2 pages is good for the first update>>> just one note- i love you shannon no matter what happens-

       Congratulations Obsidian Moon, you have gotten your own mention in my blog. First off, don't think your better than me. Even if you do know me, it must not be very well. Second, don't think your better than me, because if you think you can judge a person by their blog, then you have got to be one very mis-guided person. I talk about Halo here in my blog so my friends don't have to hear about it. I don't care about spelling here in my blog, because it's some website no-one is gonna look at, that only people on my buddy list should know about. Actual, having you around has been amusing. If you know me, then you should have my screen-name already. IM me. Go ahead. Instead of using some bull-shit made up name, IM me, and we can settle this normally, instead of just insulting me under the cover of some made up name. What happens if you don't IM me? I'll just delete your comments and take my blog off the listings. Oh, and I appreciate your concern for spelling and punctuation, but if you go around to other peoples blogs to tease them and correct their spelling then I suggest you get a hobby. Oh, and I noticed that you don't even have a blog, and you signed up this month, so once again, if you have the time to sign up on some website, only to leave "flames" as you like to call them, then you   really,   need to get a hobby.

      Hello everyone...  Yes, if you understand spainish, then you know that I'm writing this to you on my tv.  Ah, the beutity of an Nvidia 5200 Graphics card... lol  Resolution is a little low, but not so low that I can't read what i'm writing. So let me give you a little update on what's going on:  Getting an inground pool  Taking out a closet in the family room  Refinishing the hard-wood floors in the Entrance, Living Room, and Dining room  Getting a new bench-talble in the study for the 2 computers,  Getting a new computer (not some Dell, more like an low-budget Alienware... ;) )  Getting a new patio for the pool (most likely)   >>  so as you can probably tell, i'm gonna be kinda busy in the next few weeks.  Oh, did i mention going to Rhode Island with my 21 person family...  yes, if you can IM me, consider it an accomplishment because I'm not gonna be availible for a while. Well, tommorow looks pretty dull actualy, but whatever, I'll probably invaite kyle over and have a Ground-Control 2 lan party or Mechassault thing.  Oh, that reaminds me, Traci, if you read this, you said your brother was getting a mod chip for you (soon-to-be) x-box. I've got like 25 games so if you want to put a couple onto your hard drive, I'd be happy to lend them to you.  Anyway, i'm losing felling in my left foot right now, so I'm gonna go on the trampoline now...  Oh, and obsidian moon, It's my blog, i live in america, and we have free speach, i can say whatever i want, and if&nbsp;I know you, have the guts to come forward and tell me who you are instead of useing some lame-ass internet screen name, or get the hell out of my blog. :)

      Ok, I just rebuilt my computer from the ground up. tripled the Ram, got a new hard drive, 5.1 surround sound speakers, everything.  most of you don't know what that is, but whatever. about the title: Halo CE: found the dev. mode, and am taking third person pics with like twenty guys in it. yes kevin, 20. Unreal: it used to run really slow, but with the tripled ram, it's running faster than my friends new computer Homeworld 2: I just re-installed it and found my old mods. I can now choose which race i want to be near invinceible with the click of a button :)  So, I went and saw I, Robot on saterday with a couple of my friends. I liked it a lot, plus there was a movie preview of Halo 2, so it was all good. I liked it more than Anchorman, but I liked that more than Spiderman 2.  Oh, one random thought. If all the girls would stop using the exuse: "I'm pms'ing" than I would be a lot happier. I a diabetic. Does that mean i can do crazy-ass stupid stuff to everone and say: "I'm a diabetic."?  No. I can't. So quit using it as an exuse. Plus, it happens once a month. I live with diabetes 24/7. so there. I win.

       urlLink WizKids - MechWarrior  -yea, that's one mech you   don't want to mess with   so anyway, i got back from lake placid a few day ago, it was killing me not having internet up there. Anyway, broke up with my girlfriend 5 minutes ago. "Long distance relationships don't work out" or something. I think someone is polluting what's getting through to me, if you get what i mean, but whatever. Don't really care, like I said: "I don't give a shit anymore." -and that's a direct quote... lol there's an awesome update over at bungie, it's like eight pages of Halo 2 goodness. ZELDA HAS NOTHING ON HALO 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it's too true.... oh, and if anyone ever asks if you want to see a nubble, just turn and run, or you could shoot them.............. :)

                I have good news about the franchise! Or is it bad news? Or... Well you get the point. You beloved Link has just won a contest! Which one you ask? Well if you live in Newtown and have cable then you probably remember channel 66. You know, the one called tech TV, the one you always skip over? Well, just a few minutes ago, with an overwhelmed 73% of the vote, Zelda, The wand of gamalon, was voted, (now get this) THE WORST GAME EVER!!! Yes that's right, not just in one category of gaming, but THE WORST GAME EVER!!! My rendition of how bad the game is? "Nintendo gave their permission to Phillips (yes, that lightbulb company) to make a Zelda game for their console, the CDI, yes that thing you've never heard of that sound like it's made to clean CD's. Apparently the gaming developers at Phillips are Crackhead ten year olds, because almost all of the game constists of cutsenecs. But wait, where have I seen this before? Oh, that's right, it's on the bible channel, no, not the national one,  the local bible channel." It's that bad folks. No, let me ask you a simple question? Can you really even attempt to compare that to the game-of-the-year, award winning, XBN 98%, EGM 97%, lowest-score-it-ever-got-was-a-90%-because-it-was-out-of-10 game Halo, and it's soon to be, Record smashing, Halo 2? And don't even get me started on the chicken-humping, dance-number-while-fighting-ninja crap of the Final fantasy franchise. The first one was supposed to be final, how the hell can there be like twelve of them?

      The Prophet is not unstoppable, but his defects are not visible to those blind to the truth... It's army has strength, but it's religious devotion hides their true sight... They follow blindly, unable to disobey command from their leaders... They have found our defects, and now we are here, at the crossroads of humanity... The Forerunner saw this in light of their creation... And created a choice, the second path... Their arrogance... Their devotion... Their belief in what is not certain to happen... Their undoing... The Covenant can fall... Only one can find the first keystone, the markers to the undoing of the onslaught... ~117-

       urlLink    Yup, it's me, the new, more tanned and generally improved Paul, back from a week in rhode island. About the pic, that's Mechassualt2, the game I'm looking forward to the most, next to Halo2 that is. But i didn't come on to talk about that. (GASP! lol) Yea, sounds like pretty much everyone has gotten thier schedule but me. Oh well. I'm really looking forward to seeing everyone at the orentation (the spelling part of my brain is off right now) . Anyone i know who's either tall or fast, talk to me, 'cause I'm trying out for the Track team in high school, and would like to have someone I know there. :) Talk to everyone later.&nbsp; urlLink

      Yup, the problem with Obsidian and Onyx is solved for now (see above), and now those two retard's and go screw each other without me having to know about it. But anyway, If figured out how to post pictures, so expect a lot from me in the next couple of days. Well, more like 2, 'cause then I'm goin' to Rhode Island for a week with my 20-person, 10-of-them-kids, Italian Family. Yea, it's ok, a lot of body-surfing and boogie-boarding (don't know the correct spelling). The house is actual pretty nice, but there's no internet, so, yea... Talk to you all later, well, all of you but Obsidian and Onyx that is. :)

       urlLink Bungie.net : Bungie Forums  -yes, Frankie has just confirmed it, there is *certainly* not going to be a demo of Halo 2 on the August 24 edition of OXM. Su-weet. Yes Obsidian and group, make fun of me, whatever... I'd probably look subscribe to OXM if I had any spare money, but it's all in the fund for my new computer. Oh well, I'll just find some money my brother leaves lying around. lol. Ok, Obsidian, I just gave you some more kindling for your massive trash-heap of Flames, do your worst you punctuation-freak. :)

      Ah, looks like obsidian has gotten her posse together and are going to attempt to harass me. Making wild and false allegations are going to get you no where in your life. Oh, I forgot the link to the computer website:  urlLink   . there you go. now i sit back and watch the "flames" come in. like clockwork...

       urlLink I love bees  -wait for the black box with the text. It's not a virus by the way. I don't have the slighest idea what it means. Maybe obsidian moon might know, since she seems to be so superior to me. lol... anyway, my parents agreed to get my the new computer, and I'm getting a 17 inch LCD monitor to go with it. Woohoo. of course I'm getting it for Christmas though. There's always a catch. oh well, gives me something to look forward too. I can't wait to smoke through loading screens on games, load internet pages in the blink of an eye. Render pictures and search through source code with reckless abandon. Sorry, I'm sounding like an infomercial. Oh, and obsidian, I was shopping for a new keyboard. Yes, very girly indeed. *sarcasm*
