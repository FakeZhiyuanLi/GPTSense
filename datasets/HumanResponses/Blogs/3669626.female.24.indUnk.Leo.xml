      I clearly recall, when I was twelve, my mother buying a book for the daughter of a friend entitled 'A Rose in Winter' and written by Kathleen Woodiwiss. That was it, the first romance novel I ever read. Looking back on it now, it bears all the hallmarks of the novels I would later come to hate: the whimpering heroine, the cruel but masterful hero, and some mild bodice ripping. Plus, there was the cover, lurid and almost lewd. The sort of cover you would hide by bending it as far back as possible to avoid being spotted reading that sort of   trash  . So what on earth hooked me on this book? What could have possibly possessed me to become a serial reader of romance novels, you may ask? I would love to pretend it had nothing to do with a distinct lack taste, but frankly I don't really remember what I liked. I remember only the vaguest outline of the book. All I know for sure is that something in it had me hooked.  There have been innumerable novels that have followed on from that one, but all the seeds lay in the original. Now, I would never read a book with a plot or a hero like 'A Rose in Winter' Frankly, I rarely buy books that require any sort of cover-related subterfuge. But I still buy romance novels. They are like candy: sweet and tempting. Some of them are godawful. I mean, really, who could keep anything approaching a straight face whilst reading the line "Pleasure me Strong Wolf" (Actually true!)On the other hand, there are some truly wonderful novels that happen to have romance as their principal plot line. Many of them are no different to general fiction. Some of them are better than that. And they are fun and often steamy. Above all else they can transport you into someone else's life for a little while. And is that not what all books are meant to do?

      I have just made my first attempt at blogging, with no clear notion of what I intend to write. Furthermore, I have no idea if anyone is ever going to read this; but I suppose I will have to imagine that someone will: if for no other reason than to prevent me from writing something that really ought never see the light of day.  I could start out by saying something about myself. I am originally from Arizona, went to university in Montreal and I now live in London. I love to eat, to cook and to eat some more. I am short and have dreams of a kitchen where I can reach even the tallest shelf. I cannot hold my alcohol. To be fair, that puts me in the company of every other short woman I know. I am married; my husband is English.  I read voraciously - often two or three books a week. When not busy with other things, I can get through a book or two a day. By other things, I naturally mean work and all the other shit that tends to get in the way of reading.  I have a not particularly secret weakness for mixing good books with romance novels, and I hate women's magazines.   I could say more, but won't.  LT
