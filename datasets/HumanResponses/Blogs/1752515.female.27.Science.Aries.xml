      Yesterday, a guy in the lab was using a Qiagen gel extraction kit. As he opened the container of QG buffer, he yelled, "EEEEEWWW, GROSS! There's a pube in the QG buffer."   It's unclear if this stray pubic hair belonged to a member of our lab or to a Qiagen employee.  Here's a great prank to play on a hated labmate: Shave your pubes or (if everyone hates the person, have the whole lab shave their pubes). Divide the pubes between buffer solutions belonging to the hated labmate. This person will never know where the pubes came from, unless they do a panty check.

      Texas is really fucking hot, so hot that it's hard to breathe in the summer. Today the high, so far, is 101F or 38C, and it's only May.  These crazy Texans all seems to have an intense fear of rain. This is a genuine Texas phenomenon: If the temperature is above 100F or 38C, the Texans are outside, usually cruising in their Ford F350,000 pickups, in full force. If the temperature is not high enough to cause heatstroke and/or the sky is overcast, the Texans complain about the crummy weather. Honest to god this happens; you will hear Texans complaining about the poor weather if the temp drops below 100F and/or there's a cloud in the sky. It doesn't make sense because you'd think the Texans would embrace clouds because the clouds make it not as fucking hot.

       More on my friend who is no longer my friend.   As I said before, this person suddenly stopped being my friend about a month or so ago. It's unclear why. The last time we hung out, we went to a going away party for a member of my lab. Then ECO and I went back to her house, drank a beer, and parted ways. After that, she stopped returning my phone calls and acted chilly and awkward when she saw me in the hallways of our building.  Was she offended by my blog? I went back and checked the blog entries for around the time we stopped being friends. It's not clear to me how my blog could be construed as offensive to her. One of the few conversations that we've had since we stopped being friends was for her to ask me where my blog went and when it would be coming back.   I have a clear conscience about the termination of our friendship. If I did something to piss her off, I feel that it's her responsibility to tell me about it because I have no clue what abruptly ended our friendship.  My ex-friend tended to be a bit controlling at times, and I have a gut feeling that maybe that's why she stopped being my friend. Like maybe I didn't follow her instructions or something. We used to go to basketball games together, and at the games, she sometimes tried to manage when I could go to the bathroom or when I could go to the concession stand. Towards, the end of the season, I became irritated and would pee at will during games. This may have been upsetting to her. Also, whenever we were slated to hang out she'd call 10 minutes before the designated meeting time. "WHERE ARE YOU? I'M ALREADY HERE. YOU'RE LATE." For the record, I was never late.  The following stories aren't neccesarily about her excessive controllingness, but for the sake of acronyms, let's call her control freak lesbian, or CFL.  Here are two amusing stories:  ECO and I ran into CFL coming out of our building one day, talking on her cell phone. She signalled for us to wait until she got off the phone, so ECO and I waited. Later we found out that she had been on the phone with her sister.(First, a little background: According to CFL, her sister is an expert in medicine for two reasons. 1) The sister is a receptionist at a doctor's office. 2) The sister has had EIGHT babies come out of her vagina. I admit that she probably knows a lot about childbirth given that EIGHT babies have passed through her vagina.)  CFL to sister: "My labmate's cousin in France is dying of cancer, and the doctor says that she can't drink water. What should she do?"  CFL: "But isn't there something else she can drink?"  CFL: "What about juice?"  CFL: "What about soda?"  Presumably, CFL's sister was on the other end saying, "I don't know. Maybe your labmate's counsin in France who's dying of cancer should ask her doctor."  I was tempted to tell CFL that the cousin could probably keep within the doctor's orders by drinking absolute ethanol, a non-water based liquid, but I didn't say it for fear of being offensive.  Here's the second story:  ECO and I invited a few people over to watch basketball and have a cookout. CFL was skeptical because the forcast called for rain, but I assured her that we'd figure something out in case of rain. The day of the game, it was cloudy with intermittent drizzle. CFL arrived at our house, clearly perturbed that I was grilling on a cloudy day. She called her sister while at our house, "We're having a cookout AND IT'S RAINING. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?" On and on like this about how horrified she was that I was grilling out on a cloudly, slighly drizzly day. It's important to note that I was the only person outside in the drizzle. CFL was under no obligation to be outside. Our other two guests did not seem to be perturbed by my grilling. To make CFL feel better, I even held an umbrella over the grill during the brief periods of drizzle.   This intense fear of rain was an integral part of CFL's persona. ECO and I invited a few friends to go to the lake and have a cookout. We called CFL.   CFL "But it's cloudy."  Me: It's not cloudy.  CFL: "What if it rains?"  Me: It's not supposed to rain today.  CFL declined go to the lake with us. At the lake, it was really hot and we had to continually reapplied sunscreen. It would have been nicer if it really was a cloudy day.  I've never met anyone quite like CFL. (Actually, my mom is kind of like CFL.) Also, ECO had a friend like CFL. ECO's CFL abruptly ended their friendship one day for no apparent reason.   It's weird. Before entering grad school, neither ECO or I had met a CFL-genre of person. Given this fact, you'd think that CFL's are rare in the world. Yet somehow, we both managed to make a grad school CFL friend. ECO and I are both cooped up in lab all day long, isolated from the outside world. Yet somehow, while we were inconspicuously toiling away in isolation, we were unknowingly attracting control freak lesbians. I guess the good thing is that now ECO and I both can identify CFL's. Also, it's a really good thing that ECO and I found each other before the CFL's came and tried to snatch us as girlfriends.

      My advice to other bloggers is to make sure that nobody at work knows about your blog. I've read horror stories from other bloggers about what can go wrong when your coworkers know about your blog.  Currently, nobody who works in my building, with the exception of ECO, knows about this blog. This wasn't the case with my former blog, so I changed the address. Hopefully I'm safe as the homicidal lesbian terrorist. Although if anyone wanted to google "lesbians and nanoparticles", they'd likely find me. (Actually, I just googled that, and I don't come up, at least in the first 100 hits.)  Nothing bad, at least not that I'm aware of, resulted from my former blog, but just to be safe I moved my address.  One person in my building, other than my wife, knew about my former blog. About a month ago, she stopped being my friend for no apparent reason. Consequently, I became paranoid about my blog, and took it down.  This friend was kind of crazy, so now I can blog about her behind her back!!! She's excellent blog-fodder.

      Laydee-fest  ECO and I went to the Laydee-fest kickoff tonight at the Church of the Friendly Ghost. It was a singer-songwriter showcase- local lesbians showing off their skill on acoustic guitar. It's unclear why we were prompted to attend this event. As we arrived and drove past the Church of the Friendly Ghost, we first saw the expected- a bunch of dykes inside a church quietly and politely listening to the singer-songwriter. ECO wasn't sure if we should go inside, but I happened to notice abortion protesters outside of this lesbian event. This piqued my interest, so we went to Laydee-fest.  Outside the church, there were three women in their 20s holding anti-abortion signs, like "abortion degrades the dignity of women." To their credit, they seemed like nice abortion protesters, but it was unclear why they were protesting abortion to a small gathering of dykes listening to folk music. I thought that we'd find answer inside..  But we didn't. Once inside, we saw a table for registering to vote, a table selling cupcakes, and a table selling Laydee-fest t-shirts. On stage a woman sang about flannel while the 50 or so, mostly lesbionic, audience members hummed along. It was still unclear as to why Laydee-fest was being picketed by abortion protesters. It's possible that maybe the proceeds from the cupcake sales were being used to fund abortion, and maybe that's what pissed the protesters off. But how did the protesters find out about this event- I certainly didn't see any signs that said, "Lesbian Singer-Songwriter Showcase: Come buy a cupcake to fund abortion."  Maybe the protesters had something else in mind, like they wanted to discourage the Laydee-fest attendees from having abortions. Clearly, for most of the attendees of Laydee-fest, abortion is not a personal issue because they already have this problem taken care of.   The protesters were all dressed up with nothing to protest. Perhaps, a more fitting protest slogan for Laydee-fest would be, "Women bump-bumping woman degrades the dignity of women, but at least it prevents abortions."

      I'm collaborating on a project involving nanoparticle eating bacteria. It's cool in a gross sort of way. The nanoparticle eating bacteria probably came from my colloborator's nose or throat. I suppose that this guy was picking his nose while making nanoparticles one day. He discovered that the bacteria from his booger were able to grow with only nanoparticles as food.  Anyway, I'm culturing his nanoparticle eating boogers, and let me tell you,  it's nasty . The cultures are very stinky (like a combination of ass and bad breath), and now they are developing scary throat booger-like things. I bleached the flasks before it got too scary. I think I'm working with a strain of pseudomonas dorkus-throat-booger.  The next time you cough up something nasty, think of me.

      My mom is a scary strong woman.  I had a metal futon frame in my old apartment. The frame was defective, so it was hard to fold and unfold the mattress. There was one particular component that was fucked up. It was a piece of stainless steel about a half inch thick that was bent the wrong way. The futon store wouldn't replace the part.  I left my mom home alone in my apartment with a two liter bottle of Coke and a gallon of ice cream. When I returned several hours later, my mom was sweating and had a crazed look in her eye. "I ate all the ice cream and Coke, but I fixed this steal part."  I couldn't believe it: My mom had bent a half inch thick piece of solid steel at a 90 degree angle with her bare hands. I was thoroughly amazed. I tried to bend the steel, but there was no way I could make it budge. Seriously, bending steel like this is a task for the Iron Man competition, those really huge men on ESPN who lift 5000 pound balls and drag school busses.

       Another story from the parental visit.   My parents have a river behind their house, so one morning we (ECO, me, and the parents) went on a rowboat. My dad did the rowing, and he did a fine job. We reached a point in the river where the current was pretty strong against us. My dad was slowly navigating us through this patch of river when my mom decided that we weren't moving fast enough and that she needed to micromanage the situation. She started barking orders. My dad kept repeating in a whisper, "Who was in the Navy? Were you in the Navy?" Finally, my mom got pissed that we weren't going fast enough, so she jumped out of the boat. She waded in the water behind the boat in order to push the boat upstream. Pushing the boat was slightly more efficient than if my dad had just continued rowing. In the process, my mom got her jeans all wet, but at least she proved that she can micromanage everything.  My mom was in a crazy mood this particular dad. After she got back in the boat, she started talking incessantly. Crazy talk. "Look at that house. That's a nice house. Oh this is a nice river. NICE. NICE. NICE. Look at that tree. That tree was struck by lightening." On and on for like an hour. My mom was the only person in the boat who was talking. I was used to this mom behavior, but poor ECO was thoroughly freaked out and couldn't wait to get out of the boat.

       Email from Mom:   Hi R.,  I am at (your dad's work) now. I just left a message on your answering machine at home. We had a major storm here (for (town in MI)) on Friday. I was at (a store) at the time. Everyone had to stay in the middle of the store for at least 30 minutes while the storm/tornado passed. When I finally left, it was still black out and pouring rain, at 1:30pm.  At (your dad's work) (your dad) said everyone did the same, moved to the center of the plant, except for (your dad); he said that he stayed in his office in front of his big picture window and cruised the internet. The power never went off at (your dad's work).  Anyway, the power at our house have been off since Friday afternoon, so we have not water because we have a pump, no phone, no internet, etc. We are not supposed to have service restored until Monday, but the way things are going I think it will be Tuesday or later. Friday night there was another storm and today there is a tornado warning until 5 pm. I know they cannot be out fixing the lines during a storm. (your dad) is upset though. He has driven through town a lot to get to work, with so many trees down, blocking the streets, he has to go in very circuitous routes. Anyway, he reports that he has not seen a lineman out fixing anything these last few days.  There are huge trees down all over; very large trees were uprooted and laying in the streets. I only saw one house with a tree laying on it however. None of our trees came down. I was surprised because some that I pointed out to you a questionable. We had a lot of debris in our yard though. I have taken most everything out of the refrigerator section and thrown it away. Tomorrow I will do the same with the freezer. I left the refrigerator door ajar so it doesn't start to smell. Make a note: refrigerators and freezers that are not running should be left open or they will smell.   Anyway I just washed my hair here and (your dad) wants to get going. I had just read all my material on emergency preparedness too! Also, I finished  (a book) and we went to (a store) and I bought (another book) and I will start tonight.  We have to go.  Love, Mom I will call you when we get our phone working again.    My response:   ECO and I watched porn and played bump bump all weekend. The power stayed on here.

      I'm feeling very uninspired lately.   First, I don't have that much benchwork. I've found that if I don't have a lot of work, it's hard to do any work. On the other hand, when I have a lot of stuff to do, I'm at my most productive.   Second, I've been trying to read papers to kill the time. Unfortunately, the type of science that I do, nanoparticology, is dumb, so the papers that I've been reading have no point, except to say, "look what I can do!" Eventually the science world's fascination with nanoparticology will fade. But for now, all you need to get your paper into a good journal is to mention that your work has potential applications for nanotechnology. Even papers that have absolutely nothing to do with nanotechnology, like a paper on Drosophila genetics, will try to find a way to insert nano in the abstract.

      Normally when I visit my parents, I return to my life with a major case of the heeby-jeebies, and it takes me several days to recover. I didn't feel that way after this visit, probably because ECO was with me. ECO, however, is still majorly creeped out by my parents, and will need a few more days to recover. In fact, she's even had nightmares starring my mom, complete with the crazed look in her eye that my mom gets when she's feeling extra crazy. And I thought that I was the only person capable of having nightmares about my mom.  When I first came out to my mom, she didn't want me to be a lesbian for several reasons:  1) "Everyone hates the gays." This would be a valid concern if I was a factory worker in Michigan, but I'm not.  2) "R, do you have a disease?......The gays have the AIDS." Except it's really, really hard to get the AIDS from lezzie sex.  3) "Women are evil." She has a point there; women are shear evil. Except ECO. Plus, I'm not evil. In fact, I know a lot of lesbians who are not purely evil. It's the straight women you need to watch out for.   4) "What will people think of me?" Most people think my mom is bat-shit crazy anyway. If mom really cared about people thinking badly of her, having a lesbian daughter is the least of her worries.  So what's the real reason my mom doesn't want me to be a gay?   Because if I marry a woman, no woman would allow my mom to micromanage her. My mom wants me to be in a situation where she can micromanage me (plus the husband and grand-babies) for the rest of her life. This is why my parents want me to marry a man, preferably a spineless one with no personality, like my dad.  My mom is pissed because she can't micromanage me anymore, and only ECO can micromanage me now.

      Dude, my lab is so irritating.....  Today, actually right now as I write this, the gay guy is giving group meeting. It's really annoying because 1) we had to wait 20 minutes for Whore-hey to arrive before the gay guy could start 2) the gay guy is giving his exact same prelim talk, word for word, so everyone has already heard this talk. He has no results to present, so it's basically his hypothetical proposal.   Myself and a few other people got the fuck out of there because we're not listening to the same, lame talk twice, within a two month span.  Then Whore-hey asked me if I'd gotten a receipt of submission from the journal. When I told him, "no", he was puzzled. It's because my other boss is too incompetent to upload the paper to the journal's website!  I had a bad feeling when I gave my american boss the paper on a cd last week: As I handed the cd to him, he made this off-handed comment about having had too much to drink already. (It was 5pm on a Wednesday.) I have a feeling that the cd was lost or he vomitted on it or something.  You know how Rush Limbaugh has a secret drug habit. Well, I wouldn't be surprised if my american boss also has some sort of drug habit.

      On a better note, I feel much recovered today from my journey to MI. Yesterday I had the most wicked headache from not drinking coffee in the morning. I also had a wretched stomach ache, accompanied by a mild case of the shits. And then ECO informed me as to why I had a stomach ache- the nasty spoiled milk from the coffee that I'd sipped!  And it dawned on me that maybe the reason I threw up and had the shits as a kid was from spoiled milk.  ECO helped me realize something else: When I was a kid, my parents weren't too positive about my friends. ("Never trust anyone. The only person who will love you is me.") Except there was this one guy that they absolutely loved. In fact during high school, they talked about me marrying this guy. ECO met my high school friend a few years ago. He's kind of creepy and has no personality. Actually, in technical terms, he's a computer programer with Asperger syndrome. But this guy was the only friend my parents liked.  I was never romatically involved with this guy, and found him rather physically repulsive. But my mom totally encouraged me to date him. She wanted to go to the prom with him, which I didn't. She even encouraged me to kiss him, to which I responded, "EEEWWWWW GROSS". Then she said, "Well, just start by kissing him on the cheek."  ECO figured it out my mom's fascination with this guy: He's like my dad- no personality and no spine. Essentially, my mom wanted me to marry this guy because she knew (or thought) that we'd live next door and let her micromanage us.

      I don't think my boss submitted my paper yet. He came to lab yesterday to talk to someone in my office. As he walked by me, he avoided eye contact and had a guilty look on his face. I assume that means he didn't submit my paper. He was supposed to upload the paper to the journal's website a week ago, and the journal tells you within a week or two if they will review your paper. I'm trying to have a positive attitude, but it's really hard. How incompetent can my boss possibly be? It takes all of 5 minutes to submit the paper. Everything is ready to go: the cover letter, manuscript, figures. Please, logon to the website and upload the fucking paper! Please.

      ECO and I visited my parents in MI this weekend, and ECO learned all about how I grew up. I know that everyone's parents are weird, but I've always suspected that mine are extra-weird. ECO was creeped out by my parents, and she confirmed for me that they are of the extra-weird variety. It's hard to explain my parents. You kind of just have to watch them in action. Before this weekend, I'm not sure that ECO "got" my childhood. Now she gets it, and she's amazed that my parents spawned a seemingly normal child (me).  Here's what happened this morning:  We woke up at 5:45am to leave for the airport. My mom made coffee, even though ECO clearly asked her not to make coffee the previous evening. (Even though my parents do not drink coffee, they have a lot of coffee. You see, my parents horde stuff; whenever they stay at a hotel they take the free, in-room coffee bags.)  After  the coffee had been made, my mom asked ECO how much water to add when making the free, in-room coffee. Turns out that mom added way too much water. Oh well, mom insisted that we drink the coffee anyway; you can't let free coffee go to waste. So ECO put the coffee in travel mugs. My mom gave her milk and sugar to put in the coffee.   The milk was all fucked up; I'm not sure how to explain this: Well, first, the milk was fat-free, which is bad. But there was something even more fucked up about the milk. My parents do this weird thing whenever they have a drink. They rarely finish a full glass of milk. Instead they'll drink about 3/4 of the glass. Instead of dumping the remaining milk down the sink, they put the 1/4 full glass back in the refrigerator for later. Because you can't waste milk. So the milk that my mom gave to ECO to put in the coffee this morning was essentially  my mom's 2-day old backwash . And this is the essence of why my family is fucked up. When my mom wasn't looking, ECO dumped her coffee down the sink. I took a sip of the coffee (if you want to call it that!). It was the nastiest coffee I've ever had in my entire life. Then when my mom wasn't looking, I poured it out.

      ECO and I ran across some Mo-mo's (mormons) at lunch. I'm good at spotting Mo-mo's, so I was able to identify them before I saw their Mo-mo name tags. (It's kind of like gay-dar.)  The Mo-mo's were all wearing dress slacks with a white, short-sleeve button down shirt. One Mo-mo caught my eye: he was wearing his Mo-mo pants gangsta style. Essentially, his pants  were falling down his ass and were precariously close to exposing his special, Mo-mo panties.  If I was a Mo-mo, I would be that guy. Technically, he's probably following the Mo-mo pant regulations, but he's doing it in a very bratty way.

      Here I am at work causing trouble: I submitted a link for homicidal lesbian terrorist to be posted on the GOP website. (I'm a GOP team leader.)  So I guess I should say something political, since I'm now linked to a political website.  Does anyone notice the irony of the Iraqi prison sex abuse scandal? When Clinton was president, the Christian Coalition got their panties all bunched up over the president getting blow jobs in the oval office. They were upset that their children had learned about blow jobs, a part of good old-fashioned  hetero  sex. Now Bush is president, and there are pics of Iraqi prisoners getting ass-raped and whatnot on the internet. But this  isn't  cause for the Christian Coalition to get their panties all bunched up; they're NOT upset that their children are being exposed to ass-rape, gay sex, and gimp suits (all kind of gay things) as a result of the prison scandal coverage.   I went to the  urlLink Family Research Council Website   There's nothing about the prison scandal, only stuff about how evil the gays are. I don't understand Christian Coalition logic: Gay sex is bad, unless it somehow involves Dubya. Hetero sex is good, unless it involves a Democrat.

      I had a much needed vacation in Hotlanta this weekend!  I returned home to find that Whore-hey has approved my paper, so we can submit it! He made a few corrections to the manuscript, but his final version of the paper not very different from the original manuscript that caused him to have a hissy fit.  Now I just need to track down my other boss and pressure him to upload the manuscript to the journal's website!

      The German lady is cool, and she showed further evidence of this today.  Next weekend she's meeting up with some German friends in San Francisco.  All afternoon, she was yelling on the phone in German, coordinating the trip with her friends. Finally when she got off the phone, she told me, "Never travel with Germans. They're so irritating. Maybe I've been in the US too long, so that's why Germans get on my nerves now. They have to control everything and plan everything."  See, Germans really are irritating. Even the German lady thinks so.  The German lady, by the way, has evolved considerably since first coming to the US. I remember her when she first got here- our first interaction caused me to think of her as a major bitch. But, now the German lady has chilled out.

      Another wretched day of grad school.  To kill the pain, ECO and I went out drinking with ECO's ex-girlfriend. First, we called her at her job to see if she wanted to hang out, but we were informed that she no longer works there. Since she also hadn't returned our calls recently, we went over to her apartment to make sure she was okay.  It turns out the ex was fired from her job for sexual harrassment. She was a manager at a restaurant and was dating* a waitress. One night they got fucked up and made-out and the waitress spent the night. The next day the waitress reported that she'd been sexually harrassed, so ECO's ex was fired.  *how ECO's ex defines dating: to her, dating is defined as hanging out with someone you have a crush on. The other person doesn't know they are dating you.  ECO's ex is very industrious. Normally, being fired from a job for sexual harrassment would not look good on your resume, and it might be difficult to find another job. However, the ex is capitalizing on this situation by getting a job at a place where it's a plus to have "got fired for sexual harrassment" on your resume: A strip club.  So we hung out with ECO's ex and her friends from her rat infested apartment complex*.  * The complex is intentionally rat-infested. You see, ECO's ex has pet rats. Not just any pet rats, really nasty pet rats. One of the rats has a giant tumor, the size of it's own body, protruding from its stomach. The rat will retract its limbs into its tumor and then just balance on the tumor. Then there's another rat with one eye, named Uno. Here's how Uno lost his eye: A passel of baby rats, 10-15 baby rats, was born in the rat cage. One day the rat with cancer, not the mom, got fucking pissed and started eating the baby rats. ECO's ex saw this and tried to save the babies, but not before Uno, the baby rat, lost his eye.

      Dude, my bosses suck...My wife hates them because they are making me crazy.  They're supposed to help me with my paper, but they haven't showed up today. One of the guys in my lab talked to them on the phone this morning: His paper has been accepted to a journal. Now he needs the bosses to sign off on the proofs. No, that's too hard for them. The bosses told him that they were too busy to do approve his manuscript because they were busy helping me with my paper. But, like, they're not fucking working on my paper.  My labmate, by the way, got a Ph.D. from the lab in December. Now he's a postdoc in the lab. He hasn't published any papers, so it's hard for him to get a job. He's a really cool, laidback guy, but the bosses piss him off. Last fall during group meeting, he actually started swearing at them because they weren't submitting his paper.  Anyway, my labmate assured me that things will not get better, but only get worse, with the bosses.

      I feel like I'm missing something. Nobody is in my lab today, except me and a handful of Asians! Where did everyone go?   This phenonmenon also happened when I was in my former boss's lab. Except I knew why nobody was in lab on the particular day. A, my former boss, was out of town all the time. All of the white kids in lab knew her travel schedule, so consequently, when she was away, nobody came to work that day.  I don't understand what's going on today. Yesterday, my both of my bosses came to work, and they were helping me edit my paper. We got through the intro and results yesterday, and they promised to come in today and help with the discussion. Except nobody's at work today.  This is the kind of situation that makes one feel a bit paranoid.

      Ganglia Friday, April 30, 2004   Are you gay like Ellen?  Ellen DeGeneres was on the Tonight Show. I kind of look like her. We're both goofy-looking and have large, protruding beaks.  In college, I taught tennis lessons during the summer. Once one of my students, a 12 year old girl, completely out of nowhere asked me, "Are you gay like Ellen?" This was in 1997 when Ellen first came out of the closet. I don't know why she asked me that: maybe she was into lesbian punk rock and had heard the song, "Gay like Ellen", by the Butchies. Before I could answer, my tennis student said, "Oh, I didn't mean to say that out loud. Sorry." - posted by Roz @ 9:17 PM Comment (1) | Trackback (0)    As I predicted, CP fucked up his only job offer in dramatic fashion. His mistake was to begin negotiating before he'd officially been offered the job. He wrote the university an email, asking for 20G more salary, twice the start-up funds, and bigger lab space. The university responded that they couldn't accomidate his demands, so they would hire a different candidate. CP has no recourse because he wasn't officially hired. The university told him over that phone that they were interested in hiring him, but he never got a job offer in writing. The lesson here is to not show your crazy side until AFTER you've been officially hired.  CP called the postdoc in my lab to tell him the sad story. The postdoc was like, "You did what! You demanded those things BEFORE they officially hired you." Then CP got pissed off at the postdoc, "Why didn't you tell me that? Is this an American thing- that you have to be hired before you can negotiate salary? It's your fault for not telling me." The postdoc was like, "Dude, you never told me that they hadn't officially hired you!"  The postdoc in my lab, bless his heart, made the mistake of giving CP his cell phone number, so now he's made a new(unwanted) friend. CP is going to be calling this guy everyday now, until CP gets pissed off at the postdoc and decides that the postdoc is out to get him, like everyone else in America.  So I guess Whore-hey is going to continue paying CP? It's weird because Whore-hey is always complaining that the lab has no money. That we can't update our janky circa-1985 equipment. So his solution is to pay CP while CP looks for a job. - posted by Roz @ 9:25 AM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Thursday, April 29, 2004   What's up with CP (the crazy, slightly mental ill postdoc who was fired from my old lab)?  CP doesn't talk to me anymore, but he has been talking to a postdoc in my lab. CP was offered a faculty position at a large state university in the south. CP swore the postdoc in my lab to secrecy, and told him to not tell anyone, especially me: CP thinks that I will call up this university and tell them not to hire him. CP needs to remember that he's the crazy one, not me.  Anyway, by the postdoc from my lab's assessment, CP got a good offer, a good salary, and good lab start-up funds. CP doesn't see it this way; he is offended by the offer. He is the author of 40 articles, mostly in shitty journals like, the Chinese Journal of Wanker-Ass Metallurgy, so he should be given more money. Finally, CP is offended that the lab start-up funds will expire after 2 years, so he will then need to write grants to secure funding for his lab, just like everyone else. For some reason, CP thinks he should be exempt from the grant-writing process. This guy is really whacked, and it's possible that he will not accept this offer, his only job offer to date.  In any case, my euro boss, Whore-hey, has decided to employ CP until he gets a job. Whore-hey doesn't want CP to get 86'ed back to China. But, CP has a job offer. So, like, is Whore-hey going to pay CP indefinitely, until Harvard offers CP a faculty position on the condition that he doesn't need to write grants?  I'm seriously considering taking up schizophrenia. There are so many fucking crazy people in science, and they all seem to do quite well for themselves. - posted by Roz @ 9:17 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    Wow, I've been going fucking nuts with this blogging thing lately.

In fact, she's starting to confide in me about her personal problems. For example, her parents are ultra-conservative and get on her nerves. I think this has something to do with why she isn't out. Nobody in the lab, except me, knows about the German lady's lesbianinity. I'm a little confused. Am I supposed to know that she's lesbian? When I went out with her and her girlfriend, I observed their PDA's, but they were drunk. My question is: Has the German lady come out to me already? Or is she still planning on having a talk with me, and coming out then?  The German lady's parents are getting a divorce. When she told me that, I almost blurted out, "Now would a great time for you to come out to them." But I restrained myself because we were in lab, and because I was unsure if I was supposed to know that she's a lesbian.  Being around closeted homosexuals is really weird. It reminds me of this article in the Onion from a while back: Closeted Homosexual Thinks He's Still In the Closet. Everyone knew this guy was gay, but had to awkwardly act like they didn't know he was gay. I have two people in my lab like this.  When I was in college I had a friend who was a big bull dyke. A big, closeted bull dyke. Except she wasn't in the closet. Strangely, she thought people somehow wouldn't know, even though she was on the softball team and had short, bleached blonde hair. How more fucking obvious does it get? Anyway, once she got pissed off at me for outing her, even though I didn't out her. Everyone knew; I didn't need to tell them. When I told her that everyone knew, she became even more upset with me, accusing me of telling "everyone".   Then my bulldyke friend got a summer internship. One of her coworkers saw her out one night, kissing on a random woman. At first, she was freaked out that everyone at work would know. After a few days, everyone at work was still nice to her, so she concluded that they didn't know. How clueless was this woman? - posted by Roz @ 8:46 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    My lab is really getting on my nerves. I need a vacation. All of the men in my lab, including my advisors, are whiney babies. They need their mommy to wipe their asses for them. I didn't start off today in a good mood, owing to Whore-hey's whiney email outbursts. To top this off the boys in the lab were being extra special whiney and in need of their mommy today.   Our lab got new monitors for our computers. We replaced our big, heavy circa 1995 monitors with slick new flatscreen monitors. Everyone put their old monitors in a room that houses a particular piece of fancy equipment in our lab. Tomorrow a repairman is coming to service the instrument, so we need to get the monitors out of the room. There's a handful of whiney boys who use this particular instrument, and all day they whined about how we need to move the monitors out of the room. They expended a lot of energy on complaining about moving the monitors because they're wussy little boys. Finally, the lesbians were like, fuck this, we're sick of listening to you complain, we'll move the monitors. So the German lady and I hauled the monitors to the chemE building. I'm so sick of listening to everyone whine.  Yesterday, the wussy boys noticed that one of our lab refrigerators wasn't cold enough. The boys were all whiney, "What do we do? The refrigerator isn't cold. Where's my mommy to fix it?" It was really irritating, so I called a service technician. The technician came to lab and fixed it. If I hadn't done that, the not-cold-enough refrigerator would have been a major issue in group meeting next week.... "Oh my god. The refrigerator isn't working. What do we do, Whore-hey? What do we do?" The bosses would have quietly listened, while wondering if their mommy could fix the lab refrigerator. I've concluded that all of the men in my lab, with the exception of maybe one, have major mommy issues.. - posted by Roz @ 8:16 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    I'm not making this up: we really do have Jesus Day here in Texas. - posted by Roz @ 8:12 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    I watched a show on PBS, the Jesus Factor: A President and His Faith.

I guess I'm a little disappointed in Whore-hey. I thought he had the maturity of a 12 year old, but in fact, he's more on the same emotional level as a 3 year old.  Everyone in the lab is pissed off at Whore-hey. He's been off partying in NYC and Europe for the past 6 months, and the lab is in disarray. A lot of people are ready to publish papers, but since the papers aren't Science or Nature Biotech material, whore-hey doesn't want to publish their results.  The German lady has also had some problems. She sent him an email a few months ago describing her results. Whore-hey responded that he didn't believe her results, they sucked, something like that. Last week the German lady resent her previous email. Whore-hey fucking loved her results the second time he read the email!  I'm looking forward to my postdoc. Seriously, my situation could not get any worse. Unless my postdoc advisor decides to fire me or something equally disasterous, my postdoc is guaranteed to be better than grad school. - posted by Roz @ 10:37 AM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    Getting a paper published when you have 3 bosses is a really miserable experience.  A, my crazy former boss, is not responding to my requests to read the paper. My american boss badly wants for crazy boss to read the paper. This situation is okay. I don't care if she reads the paper.  Whore-hey, the euro boss, is a whole different ballgame. He thinks that the paper fucking sucks, although he's not specific about why it sucks so bad. First, he said it sucked because the results were inconclusive. American boss, however, thinks it's okay that the results are inconclusive and we should submit it. This pissed off whore-hey even more. Last night he sent me an immature email, saying he didn't want to be an author on the paper. This really freaked me out! My boss told me that my research sucks so bad that he wants nothing to do with it! So I wrote back, explaining to whore-hey why I thought the results are important and the paper should be submitted. Whore-hey replied that he agreed that we could publish inconclusive results, but now the reason he doesn't like the paper is that the writing sucks.  This is truly a nightmare. I can't wait to write my next paper. - posted by Roz @ 10:02 AM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Tuesday, April 27, 2004   Warning: Tapioca ball must chew before swallow.

ECO told me about the vaginal problems to ask me what I think caused her boss' cooties: was it from boinking men or from having a baby?  But I couldn't get over the fact that ECO's boss tells her grad students all about her nasty pussy! This has to be a form of harassment. Seriously, if you're a grad student in the lab, you are obligated to listen to your boss talk about her crusty pussy. On the other hand, if a fellow coworker talked about her pussy incessantly and you didn't want to hear it, you could say, "Shut the fuck up before I bitch-slap you!" without fear of getting fired.  Anyway, ECO's boss' hetero pussy condition is further proof that Geezuz hates straight women. Maybe the reason Geezuz was a virgin was that he couldn't get laid. Consequently, he sent down a pussy scourge from heaven to all those scanky bitches.  Geezuz hates fags because they tried to hit on them. He wanted to kick their asses, but instead he sent down AIDS from heaven.  Geezuz was cool with the lesbians. They didn't want to sleep with them, but that was okay. They were all fat and ugly and wore flannel, so he didn't want to sleep with them anyway. Geezuz comisterated with his lesbian sisters about how hard it was to pick up chicks. - posted by Roz @ 7:29 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    As I've mentioned, ECO and I are visiting my parents in a few weeks. If I had a normal relationship with my parents, we could joke about things I did in high school. ECO could say something like, "Hey remember that time Fez gizzed all over the backseat window. Well, R wasn't jerking off Fez that night. Fez was jerking himself off. Instead, R was drinking beer!" Then my parents would laugh, because this happened 10 years ago.  But my family isn't normal. If ECO said that, I'd be grounded the rest of the visit. ECO would have to sleep in the basement, and my mom would sleep in my bed with me, to make sure I didn't smoke crack.  Where did my mom's paranoia about me smoking crack come from?  When I was in high school, I did bratty things like, I'd sit in the back of the classroom, pull my shit over my head, and say something like, "I am the great Cornjulio. Would you like to see my bunghole?" This caused the teachers to think I was "on drugs". Ironically, when I went to class "on drugs", I was remarkably well-behaved, sitting quitely in the back of the class.  So anyway, my sober behavior led the teacher to beleive that I was "on drugs." The principal called my mom to tell her about my drug useage. Around this time, there was a rumor at school that someone had told the principal that I was a cocaine dealer. This is how my mom came to believe that I was smoking crack.  The next few months were hell. My mom slept in my bed with me, drove me to school, and basically followed me around all hours of the day and night, except when I wasn't in school. I couldn't take a dump in peace. During this time, I caught a cold. My mom was convinced that my cold was actually the symptom of cocaine withdrawl.So my mom was a little crazy, but she wasn't the only crazy mom at my school.  Keep in mind, the only drugs I had done were smoking pot a few times and drinking an occasional beer. Also, there was this over the counter asthma drug called, Mini Thins, and kids at my school bought Mini Thins at the gas station. If you took enough Mini Thins, the effect was equivalent to low-grade speed.  I remember this letter to the high school newsletter. It was from a crazy mother: Her son had drank two beers at a party, and come home smelling of alcohol. She wrote about how this caused her to freak the fuck out! She debated taking her son the emergency room for alcohol poisoning (because he'd had two beers.) The son was not drunk and convinced his mom not to do that. The mom stated that having her son drink two beers was the most traumatic thing to ever happen to her in her entire life! She hoped no parent would ever have to endure what she went through. This lady was seriously out of touch with reality.  Does being a parent make you go fucking crazy and become irrational?   - posted by Roz @ 4:12 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Monday, April 26, 2004   I went out with the German lady, and it was cool. She bought me a beer, and we listened to some music. She cuddled and kissed her girlfriend. I now have undeniable evidence of the German lady's lesbianinity. This is the first woman who I've either seen or heard of who is both German and a lesbian. All German ladies look like dykes, but bona-fide Geman dykes are rare. According to a friend who studied in Germany, Geman lesbians are like unicorns.  Since the German lady is not officially out, we didn't discuss her lesbianinity. It's like she knows that I know that she knows. But we can't talk about it. Also, her friends know that I know that she knows I know. But we can't talk about it. Everything was hinted at in conversation.  ECO and I hung out with the German lady, the German lady's girlfriend and two of the German lady's friends from the (nudey, German) co-op. One of the German lady's friends is dating a woman who works in my building. Instead of going out with her boyfriend that night, she opted to go to the gay bar because she's bisexual. But her bisexuality is under wraps too. I was informed that she went to the gay bar because, well, you know why. BECAUSE SHE'S BISEXUAL. Seriously, does anyone think I care if this woman is bisexual. Or if the German lady is a lesbian. I've suspected the German lady's lesbianinity for quite some time, but it wasn't interesting enough to confirm definitively - posted by Roz @ 9:20 PM Comment (1) | Trackback (0)    I have a highly personal, embarrasing condition.

The bus had just left so I walked to the next one and the next one and at the fifth stop I decided enough was enough and just sat down and the plan was to hop on the next bus I'd see. I had to wait a while but at some point this Japanese woman appears out of nowhere with a camera and a video camera around her neck and a gigantic suitcase on wheels. She was obviously heading towards the hotel that is next to the stop I was at but from where the hell did she come from? It was almost midnight. So if you ever wondered, Japanese tourists grow on trees here in Reykjavik and then wander the streets at night.  I thought it was funny because this is what ECO and I did when we arrived in Reykjavik. We wandered the streets for several hours, luggage in tow, until it was time to check into the hotel. At one point, we became really tired and took a nap on the lawn of the house where Reagan and Gorbechov held their cold war summit. We woke to find an Icelandic lady standing over us, looking at us quizzically. Once she detected movement from us, she scurried away.  - posted by Roz @ 9:05 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    ECO and I are visiting my family in two weeks. ECO, especially, is freaked out by my parents. Everything is so under the table and not talked about in my family. Here are two stories from high school to illustrate this point:  The night before I went to college my parents took me out to dinner at a fancy restaurant. My dad ordered this huge chalis of red wine. At one point, both of my parents left the table, leaving me unsupervised with the wine. Since having dinner with my parents was fucking intolerable, I reached across the table and chugged the red wine. Because the chalis was so big, it was impossible to tell that I'd made a dent in the wine. When my parents returned to the table, they were like, "you drank the wine. we know you drank the wine." I denied it; there was no way they could tell I drank the wine. The level of wine in the chalis was about the same, and they hadn't seen me do it. My mom continued on with lecturing me about college, "When you go to college, you have to study constantly or else you'll flunk out. Then you'll have to move home and work in a factory. When you go to college, don't drink alcohol, like you just did, or else you'll flunk out." On and on and on.   ECO and I went out for dinner last night, and we had red wine. It stained our teeth red. That's how my parents knew I'd drank the wine when I was in high school. Because my parents are weird, they didn't say, "we know you drank the wine because you're teeth are red."  Another story happened my senior year of high school. I went to a party with a Latin American exchange student, let's call him "Fez." I brought some beer, and I drank it with Fez and a Swedish exchange student. We ran out of beer and decided to go to the liquor store in a neighboring town, Osceola, where they sold beer to high school students. We arrived at the store at 11pm, but the store had closed early that night. Desperate for beer, we stopped at a convenience store to try to buy beer. Unfortunately, a passel of po-pos were eating donuts inside. My friends and I freaked out and left the store. As we were leaving, the po-po's got up from their tables and stared us down. We left the store. As we were driving, the Swede and I decided that we needed to get off the main drag, in case the po-po's radioed to their buddies that some drunk teenagers were driving west on the street. Fez sat quietly in the back seat, not making a sound. The Swede and I navigated the back roads of Osceola until we were lost. Soon it was midnight, my very strict curfew. Eventually, we figured out how to get home. The Swede suggested that I call my parents and tell them that I'd fallen asleep watching a movie. We stopped at a pay phone, but my parents didn't buy the story, "We drove by your friend's house several times, but the car wasn't there."  I dropped off the foreigners and instructed them to remove all beer cans from the car. Then I went home; my mom was furious, so she yelled for a few hours before going to bed. In the morning, my dad woke me up, "Go clean out the car now before your mother sees it, and WW3 breaks out!" Inside the car, I found two beer cans under the seat. I grabbed them and threw them in the trash bin behind the house. When I got back to the garage, my mom was there, pointing at a white sticky stain on the backseat window, next to where Fez had been sitting quietly during my getaway from the po-po's.  Mom: "What is this on the window!" Me (relieved that she hadn't seen the beer cans): "I don't know." I touched the window. "Hmm. It's white and sticky." Mom: "You know what this is." Me: "I have know idea! Maybe it's lotion? Or potato chip grease?" I seriously had no idea. All I know was that Fez had been sitting in the backseat with a can of beer. There was no lotion or potato chips. Mom (to my dad): "You know what this is! Do you know what your daughter has been doing?" Me: "Mom, I have no idea what you think this is!" Obviously, my parents were in on a secret!  The conversation went on like this for a while. My parents never told me what the mysterious white, sticky substance was. Then my mom stopped yelling, and was nice to me the rest of the day. She seemed strangely happy. I knew she didn't know about the beer because if that was the case, I'd be grounded for months. Plus, my mom would have slept in my bed with me at night to make sure I didn't smoke crack.  One day, when I was in college and had learned many things, it dawned on me what that white sticky substance was, and i wanted to kick Fez's ass.  Why didn't my mom just say, "Why is there cum on the window? Were you jerking off Fez?" - posted by Roz @ 8:34 AM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Sunday, April 25, 2004   My wife and I made a rare venture out Friday night, and we went to a punk rock show. A few years ago, ECO and I were youthful and hip (on account of our youthfulness). We're both 27 now, and neither of us could be considered a kid anymore. Not only are we old, but we're out of touch with the youth of today. For example, we're horrified by this whole 1980's bad fashion obsession. No fucking way would I let my kid walk out of the house dressed in tight jeans, converse tennis shoes, a ripped jean jacket, thick-framed tinted-lens glasses, and sprouting a mowhawk.  Bisexuality is in these days, especially the male variety. On Friday night, I observed for the first time ever two men French kissing outside of a gay bar. There's a new trend in dating: three way dating with two guys and a girl. ECO and I saw two such couples. It was weird: All three parties were physically affectionate towards everyone else, including taking turns kissing. When I was a kid, we didn't have this sort of dating phenomenon.   - posted by Roz @ 5:08 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    Who will go to heaven?  In this world, there are only two really, really, bad activities that will send you to hell: for women, abortion, and for men, butt-fucking another man. Partake in either of these activities, and you'll be 86ed to the eternal flames of hell.  Lesbians are Geezuz's chosen people. Think about it: A really high percentage of women will have an abortion at some point in their lives. (About 40% of women in the US have had an abortion.) Presumably the majority of these women are straight. Therefore straight women are going directly to hell.  Gay men are also going straight to hell. It says so in the Bible. Besides, AIDS is Geezuz's way of saying that he hates fags. In addition to fags getting AIDS, a lot of straight women are contracting AIDS, especially in the developing world, further proof that Geezuz hates straight women.  Heaven is dominated by straight men and lesbians. No straight men has EVER had an abortion. Plus, it's unlikely that very many of them have butt-fucked another man.  Lesbians are also going straight to heaven. Most lesbians have not had an abortion, because you can't get pregnant from lezzie sex. Plus, it's nearly impossible to contract AIDS from lezzie sex. Finally, the Bible doesn't prohibit lesbianinity. Unlike ass-fucking, Geezuz smiles on carpet munching.  Everyone knows that straight men are going directly to heaven. But, it's a little known fact that the lesbians are going to heaven too.  If you're a straight woman, there's still time: You can repent for your sins and become a lesbian. - posted by Roz @ 12:52 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Friday, April 23, 2004   "Fucking Whore-hey. Fucking Whore-hey Whore-he-ho*"  Upon receiving an email from my euro boss, that is what I yelled today while sitting at my desk. Jorge had read the final version of my paper, and Whore-hey didn't like it.  Six months ago, Jorge, me, and my other boss talked about where to submit my paper. Jorge insisted on a full paper to this particular journal. Now Jorge has changed his mind and wants me to completely rewrite the paper as a communication for a different journal. Hence my outburst.  My outburst was a way for the German lady and I to start talking. We bonded about how irritating the bosses can be. Tonight, the German lady and I might go out clubbing together.  I think that the German lady has tried to start conversations with me before with her outbursts. "Shizen. Hiken Ze Shizen." But I don't know what that means. If I were to venture a guess, I say it means: Shit. Fucking Shit. We've never bonded until today.  Then I had to go to Nano &*$%^% Night, a poster session for nanotechnology at my university. It was lame and stinky. The air was permeated by the stench of unwashed Asian grad student after a hard day of using the electron microscope. I thought, "Fuck Nano &*$%^% Night." And then I came home.  *my euro boss' name, phonetically and in Spanish.   - posted by Roz @ 6:28 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Thursday, April 22, 2004   About six months ago, I brought a few plants into lab, put them next to the window, and watered them.

Currently, the paper is all ready to go, and the cover letter is written. Now my boss simply needs to submit the paper, a process that will take all of five minutes to complete. All he needs to do is go to the journal webpage, login, and upload the paper and figures. He's too busy to do this, so I predict he'll get around to doing this in another month. It fucking pisses me off!  I know I shouldn't be annoyed by this, but I am. Whenever the boss comes to lab, many of the guys in lab are all whiney, like, "What do I do? What do I do? I ran a gel. What do I do next?" So the bosses explain very patiently and very extensively what to do next to the whiney dudes. And I feel like they don't give me the time of day. Which is fine. Except when I want them to fucking submit my paper. God damn it. I'm really fucking pissed that this paper thing is draggin on for so long.  I'm also really scared about my next paper. If it's gonna take this long for them to read my paper, edit it, and submit it, I'm not gonna get another paper out of grad school. Once I'm out of here, they're gonna be, like, "Fuck it. I don't have time to submit this paper." The only reason I've progressed this far is that I'm here to make them feel guilty. Whenever I talk to my boss about my paper, he says, "I'm sorry, I'm a bad advisor. I know this is unacceptable, but I'm really busy." Then yesterday I saw the boss and asked him when he was going to submit the paper; he told me to pretend like I didn't see him, like he wasn't actually at school. God fucking damnit! This is my plight as the bastard, step-grad student. - posted by Roz @ 8:46 AM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Wednesday, April 21, 2004   How we're educating our children here in the Promised Land:  Here in Tejas, we're raising taxes on strip bars to raise money for schools AND to fund tax decreases for rich people.

One reason there's nothing to do is because my nanoparticles are lost. I ordered $700 worth of nanoparticles three weeks ago but never received them. Today I learned that the nanoparticles were received at my university three weeks ago, but are now missing. The dude in receiving who signed for and then lost my nanoparticles picked an expensive package to lose.  Group meeting We had group meeting today. Sometimes, I don't understand the meeting presentation. Part of the problem is that I work on a totally different project from anyone else in the group. (As I mentioned earlier, I'm the bastard love child grad student.) Consequently, I'm not familiar with a lot of details of projects in the lab that the presenter often skims over. It's not clear if I don't understand the presentation because I'm dumb or because the presenter isn't doing a good job. Today a postdoc gave a presentation about his project. One aspect of his project was unclear to me. Anyway, after meeting I was walking to another building with one of the bosses. My boss said to me, "Did you understand why he's doing blah blah blah? It just wasn't clear to me." Essentially, nobody, including the boss, understood what this guy was talking about, but yet, nobody bothered to ask.  The undergrad My undergrad is doing better in lab. It makes me happy because I want her to do well. She couldn't be more different from me, and she has this particular personality trait that I cannot understand or relate to: She has an intense fear of making a mistake. Her parent probably fucked her up somehow; now she has this weird, detrimental personality trait. She had to write a research proposal for a scholarship, and she had two weeks to complete the assignment. I suggested that she read review articles and then write the proposal about a simple, well-defined problem. So anyway, she dropped out of the scholarship competition because she decided that her proposal wasn't creative enough and didn't meet the high standards that she holds for herself. I was like, "Dude, you need to get over how your parents fucked you up!" Except I didn't say that. I said something like, "I'm sure any proposal that you will write is just as good as any proposal that your competetion will write." But she doesn't listen to me. - posted by Roz @ 3:23 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Monday, April 19, 2004   ECO and I have been contemplating our postdoctoral future and thinking about where we should apply. We've narrowed it down to two geographical regions: San Francisco bay area and North Carolina triangle park area. The good thing about living in SF is that it's cool and gay friendly. The bad part is that it's really fucking expensive. North Carolina is exactly the opposite: It's dirt cheap to live there, but it's also south of the Mason-Dixon line, which means the natives don't care too much for the gays.   North Carolina may not be too bad for the gays. I know two people who live there now, both lesbians. One of the lesbians was a former postdoc in Tejas. Incidently, she was also temporarily roomates with my former crazy bitch boss. Two months before moving to NC, the lesbian became so infuriated with my former boss that she abruptly moved out. The second lesbian was a former postdoc at my undergrad institution. She worked in the lab next to mine, and I had a creepy sort of crush on her. One day I barked at her in the hallway. So, like, if ECO and I move to NC, we may run into my former crush. In case this woman doesn't remember me, I've decided to bark at her. Then she'll remember me. She'll also move far, far away from NC and never be seen again. - posted by Roz @ 8:53 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    Okay, so it's not clear if the other lesbian identifies as a lesbian. But does she identify as a rugmuncher? That she should. I'm in a lab full of carpet munchers, except for the gay guy, of course.

I'm the love child of your ill-fated collaboration with A, the bitch who moved to Boston, and I work on nanoparticles."  This is what ECO suggested that I say to my advisors each time I talk to them to preface our conversations. Well, she didn't tell me to say exactly this, but she did suggest that each time I talk to them, I remind them what exactly I'm working on and what I'm doing in their lab. I've been doing my little intro each and every time I talk to my advisors for the last two years and it's greatly helped our communication.  Somehow, when the other grad students say to my boss, "My PCR failed so I did BiaCore, and that worked but my protein expression and FACS signal were a little low.....", the bosses know exactly what they're talking about. As the bastard step-grad student, the bosses aren't exactly sure what I'm doing or why I'm in their lab. Hence, the need for the introduction each and every time we talk.  Still, they, especially the euro, had trouble remembering who I was. I came to terms with this. I'm not really their grad student, just the bastard grad student, and they have grad students of their own to worry about. It's asking a lot for them to remember what my project is. One day after two years in the lab the euro boss found out I was a lesbian (because it wasn't obvious before). After that, he could remember who I was. Little does he know that now there are two lesbians in the lab. I think that knowing there are, not one, but two lesbians in the lab would be quite mind-boggling for him. (Everyone in my lab likes pussy, except for the gay guy, of course. But he's still in denial so he THINKS that he likes pussy.)  So, anyway, I worked on my communication skills with my bosses and tried to clearly explain my new results while making sure that they knew what my project was. Then I wrote a manuscript for publication and gave it to my american boss. Strangely enough, you'd think he'd never seen any of my results before. But in fact, I'd told him all of my results at least seven times, and I have group meeting slides to prove it. So it took him like 6 months to come to terms with my project and my various results. Fortunately, we're ready to submit my paper now. Unfortunately, my other boss, the euro, hasn't seen the paper yet. I have this sinking feeling about him finally reading the paper. He's gonna be like, "Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Where did this project come from?" Even though I've told him all of my results, like, 5 times.  Which brings me to another point about my relationship with my bosses...  So the manuscript that's ready to submit has been edited and deemed acceptable by american boss. I just know that when the euro boss gets his red pen on the paper, he's gonna be like, "What the hell is this crap!" That's because my two bosses rarely agree. Often their advice for my project is diametrically opposed. Often I will tell one boss a result of an experiment and his response is, "Why are you doing that!!! That's a really dumb experiment!!!" It's sort of a rhetorical question, so I don't answer. But the reason I'm doing THAT experiment is because the other boss told me to. Generally this scenario happens each time the american boss tells me to do an experiment. Then if I tell the euro boss the experiment, he totally disses it and at the same time, without knowing it, he's disses the other boss.     - posted by Roz @ 7:59 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Thursday, April 15, 2004   Generation Y scares me.

Already my mom is thoroughly confused by what she has spawned, my blog would be downright traumatic.  I remember once when I was in middle school, I was hanging out with my friends, joking around.

Later my mom took me aside, "I don't understand why your friends think you're funny, R, because you are not funny. Why do they think you're funny?"

The assembling a computer thing is turning out to be a disaster, instead of "a good way to save money for the lab" or "job training in case the science thing doesn't work out", as the bosses intended.   I feel really bad for the guy in my lab, who is assembling his own computer as a test case. He's spent weeks putting it together. Now it just doesn't fucking work and he can't figure out why. It's not that he's dumb; it's just that he's a BIOCHEMIST. So he's going to Fry's and exchanging out individual components to see what the problem might be. Unfortunately, I don't think that he can get a refund for all of the parts. The next option is to have a technician figure out what the fuck is wrong with the computer. The problem is that it costs money to do this, so then assembling your own PC is no longer cost effective. Not to mention all the time this guy has spent fucking around with computers and not doing science. The lab might has well have just bought an assembled computer.   Yet another example of the bosses being a penny-wise and a pound-foolish with the money. - posted by Roz @ 10:10 AM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Tuesday, April 13, 2004   Lesbians crack me up. Curve magazine is so entertaining, not because it's actually funny or entertaining. Well, it is funny, but it's more like, I laugh at the magazine, not with it.  Here's a paraphrased quote from Melissa Etheridge: "When I first started dating my wife, we'd go out to a restaurant. Then she'd go outside to smoke a cigarette, and a bunch of men would try to hit on her. She would say, 'I have to get back to my LOVER GIRLFRIEND.' I thought that was so cool. I wrote a song about it."  I bet that song is very profound.  Then there was an article about lesbians rescuing cats and dogs. One example was given about an abused cat. Fortunately, the cat is okay now. To paraphrase: "The cat was placed in a good lesbian, Quaker household where he is being given a second chance at life." Why do I think that's funny? Why is it necessary to tell me that the cat now lives in a "good lesbian, Quaker household"? They could have just said the cat found a good home. No, Curve magazine wants me to know that the kitty is living with a bunch of dykes who don't believe in electricity and who drive a horse and buggy. Knowing this is supposed to make me feel better about the plight of the abused cat than simply knowing the cat found a good home. - posted by Roz @ 1:30 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    Dissed  Whenever I see the CP (crazy postdoc) family on campus, they totally diss me. I wave and say 'hi' to either CP or Mrs. CP, but no response. Then when I see CP next, he'll claim that I dissed him, because he's crazy.  So today ECO and I saw Mrs. CP interacting with a man. At first, I thought the man was CP, but it turned out that he looked identical to CP, except he was about 6 inches shorter. Mrs. CP towered over him. As we walked by I waved at Mrs. CP, but she looked away.   I guess I can understand why she dissed me: She was probably trying to get her game on with the little CP. Her thought bubbles were like, "Damn, this man is fucking hot. I want to get some of that. Hmmm. Uhhhm. Hot diggity damn." Except in Chinese. When she saw me, she pretended she didn't know me, and hoped that I wouldn't tell CP that I saw her flirting with his mini-me. - posted by Roz @ 1:08 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    This weekend I wanted to go to a trendy art/ techno music show at a local art gallery.

We'd be laughed out of the art/techno music show if we showed up in our grad student uniform, a bleach stained t-shirt and jeans, incidently the only type of clothes in our wardrobe.  It made me sad that we're too ugly/poor to go out in public. I don't get it: I think ECO is beautiful.

What is that smell?!? I know the guys in my lab fart a lot, but what's with the constant fart smell. If I leave a sweatshirt in lab a few days, it acquires this nasty lab funk. Other labs don't stink like this. Why my lab?  When I was in college, my dorm room always smelled like dead animal. My roomate and I would go away for a weekend, and upon our return, the smell would have gotten worse, sometimes much worse. We never figured out what that smell was, and other people in our dorm didn't have such a problem.   Now that I'm removed from the situation, I think I know what that smell was: our sweaty clothes. Neither of us were terribly hygenic. My roomate took, like, one shower the entire first semester of college. And I was bad at laundry. I'd never done laundry before going off to college, and I tried to put it off as long as possible. I avoided laundry for the first month of college; I wore the same sweatpants everyday, while going commando. Finally, I washed all of the clothes I owned, all at once, and all crammed into one washing machine. My clothes turned out pink and even stinkier than before I washed them. First, I'd forgotten to put in laundry detergent. Second, I had a bunch of new, red (school colors) work-out clothes, so the color bled into the rest of the clothes. Third, as I mentioned before, all of my clothes were crammed into one washing machine. Finally, I didn't have enough quarters for the dryer, so I just brought the wet clothes up to my room, and left them in the laundry basket until I wore them again. It was a disaster, but I didn't want to repeat my laundry just yet. So I wore my stinky, moldly clothes another month, before I tried again to do laundry.   Needless to say, I didn't score my freshman year. - posted by Roz @ 5:39 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    I don't have anything to blog about these days.  Grad students in my lab occassionally talk about my bosses behind their backs. I wonder if the bosses talk about us: "Dude, that guy needs to take a shower!" "I know, totally." "And that one jackass in our lab, how annoying is that guy?" "Dude, he's such a suck-up. He irritates the fuck out of me."  Actually, everyone in my lab is great, but still, I wonder if the bosses talk shit about us.  I heard through the grapevine that CP got a faculty position somewhere. I'm happy for him. I talked to him on the phone a few days ago: He sounded less crazy, but he didn't tell me about his job offer. I think he's paranoid that I'd call the school and tell them to rescind their job offer. The reason that I think this is because when I talked to him several weeks ago, he blamed me for him getting fired. He claimed that I called our former boss and told her that CP hadn't been working, so she fired him. In fact, the former boss hates me, and at the time, I hadn't spoken to her in about a year.   Incidently, I looked up the symptoms of schizophrenia on the internet. ECO instructed me to do this because one of her former collegues may be affected. The former collegue is currently in a mental hospital. Yep, this person went directly from the lab bench to the looney-bin. These things happen in science.  Anyway, my research on schizophrenia leads me to believe that CP may be affected. He has some symptoms: 1- paranoid delusions. Everyone is out to get CP, including me. The former boss wants to kill him. When he was told to move his family out of the lab, he was being unfairly discriminated against. Essentially, everyone in America is on a mission to get CP. 2- delusions of grandeur- CP believes that he should definitely get a faculty position at, say, Harvard. 3- disorganized speech- i.e. what I call crazy talk. CP resorts to crazy talk when you ask him a question about an uncomfortable topic, like how he did an experiment. 4- There are 12 million people with schizophrenia in China!  But, CP seems better lately- Maybe he's taking his medicine.  - posted by Roz @ 4:52 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Thursday, April 08, 2004   My bosses think that it would be neat-o if everyone in the lab could learn to assemble a PC from scratch. In case the science thing doesn't work out for us, we can always get a job at Dell. My office is turning into a little PC assembly line, and one of my officemates has spend the last several weeks assembling his own computer. Unfortunately, he hasn't gotten the computer to work yet. We are biochemists afterall.   I'm just peachy with my vintage 2000 PC. It works just fine for me and never crashes. I'm cool with the whole "assemble your own PC thing" as long as I don't have to do it. But, actually, of all the people in the lab, I might possibly have something to gain scientifically from assembling a computer: Whenever I give a talk, I always say that my project has potential applications in nano-electronics and nano-computing. But I don't have a fucking clue how a regular computer works, let alone how a hypothetical "nano" computer might work.  Which leads me to the German lady. Her PC doesn't work. She's always banging her optical mouse, while yelling "Shitzen!" Today she emailed the boss to ask for a new computer... Then later she starts screaming in German, getting the attention of everyone in the office; she'd received a response from the boss: "The boss says I can assemble my own computer!" "Oh no!" replies another officemate, "Does this mean we're going to have to listen to you yelling and banging things the ENTIRE time you're assembling the computer?" (It seems the German lady doesn't bother only me.) "Nein," says the German lady, "I will assemble the computer at my (nudey, German) co-op."

Yesterday she decided to clean out her files, so she grabbed the paper recycle bin and brought it to her desk. Instead of sitting it down, she slammed the recycle bin onto the ground (very German). Then she proceeded to go through her papers. With each paper, she alternated crumpling the paper into a ball or tearing the paper into pieces, while periodically yelling "Shizen!" or "Hiken Ze Shizen!". (Either it's a German thing or she has Tourette's syndrome.) This whole process involved excessive noise making! After she left, I was curious why the process of throwing away paper elicited such a strong reaction. Was she throwing away old love letters? So I looked in the recycle bind: the discarded papers were sequencing results and old science papers: the papers contained no personal information. In essence, the excessive crumpling and tearing was unnecessary; she could have simply placed the papers in the recycle bin. - posted by Roz @ 12:55 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    It's April Fool's Day!  Last month, one of my bosses encouraged the lab to play an April Fool's Day prank on our other boss, who is on sabbatical. The lab was less than enthusiastic about playing a prank. My idea was to have everyone send him and email saying that they'd just gotten phenomenal results. But this prank had serious implications. It's hard enough for my boss to keep everyone's project straight (in fact, I'm not convinced that he knows what my project is), so this sort of prank would have negative reprocussions for our quality of advising. My boss would be thoroughly confused for several months as to what was going on in the lab.  Pranks are dumb, anyway. April Fool's is for students at MIT, who have the maturity of a 6 year old, as a way to make them feel smart and clever for thinking up a prank. - posted by Roz @ 8:53 AM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    Bad things happen to good people:  My lab has had a run of bad luck lately: 1 last night a postdoc from my lab returned home after a hard day to find his apartment complex burning down.

He's still here this morning.  2 Last month, a guy in my lab had his skull cracked open under strange circumstances. He doesn't remember how it happened. He remembers leaving a bar at closing time and unlocking his bike from a bike rack outside the bar. The popos found him wandering the streets without shoes and with blood gushing from his skull. The next day or two later, he woke up in the hospital with a black eye and a broken skull. His shoes, keys, watch, and bike were missing. Fortunately, he's recovered and doing fine now.  3 That same weekend, another guy in the lab had his apartment broken into and his stuff stolen. Fortunately, he wasn't home.  Other bad things have happened to my lab: 1 Since moving here, I've had my car broken into twice. Also, I was in a car accident, where my car was totalled and my fingers broken.  2 A few years ago, a new foreign postdoc joined our lab. He moved his stuff into his new apartment, locked the door, and went to get a bite to eat. He returned to his apartment to find the place cleaned out. The only thing that wasn't stolen was his ax, which had been hidden behind the door. That night he slept on the floor, clenching his ax, in case they returned for him. He was freaked out by America, as his first day in the country hadn't gone too well.   - posted by Roz @ 8:42 AM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)

      Ganglia Wednesday, March 31, 2004   A while back, I blogged about a woman in my building who has stinky poop, the stinky pooper woman (SP): A mysterious new woman started taking incredibly stinky dumps in the first floor bathroom about 2 months ago. Well, since then I've had two under-the-stall SP shoe sightings, so I can now identify SP by her shoes. Today ECO and I were in the building, and a woman walked by. ECO stopped talking mid-sentence and stared down the woman's shoes. The ID was negative; we still haven't found SP.   I had an awkward bathroom interaction with ECO's boss. All of the stalls were occupied, and in one of the occupied stalls, I was taking a big, stinky dump (not as stinky as SP's dumps, though). I finished pooping, flushed, left a minor skid mark, and walked out of the stall. Waiting in front of my stall was ECO's boss. We smiled awkwardly at each other, and her boss made some comment about having to wait in line to use the toilet. I'm kind of embarrassed that ECO's boss now knows what my poop smells like- it's a very intimate thing to know about someone! - posted by Roz @ 12:46 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Tuesday, March 30, 2004   I think that my undergrad figured out that she's not interested in research, as I haven't seen her in a while. This is a good thing.  The last time my undergrad came into lab, we ran a gel. Then I explained to her what we were going to do next. I'd been talking less than two minutes when she leaned against my bench and fell soundly asleep... while I was talking to her. I said, "I'll finish up this procedure. See you next time." I haven't heard from her since.   Our working relationship never really gelled. Usually, my undergrad would come into lab, and we'd start by setting up a procedure. When we had a break in the experiment, I instructed her to write out the procedure in her notebook and/or read a paper relavent to the experiment. Instead, she either took a nap or worked on her crocheting. I really wanted to make our research relationship work, so I talked to my undergrad about the importance writing in her notebook. Still this was interpreted as, "Crochet!"   One day a postdoc in the lab came into my office and teased my undergrad about her crocheting. Apparantly, this freaked her out, and she never crocheted again in lab.  Finally, I asked her why she didn't write in her notebook. She explained, "If I write in my notebook, I'll make mistakes. See, already my notebook has too many cross-outs. I can't make a mistake." I told her it was okay to make mistakes and cross-outs, but still, we never got the writing in the notebook thing to work.  My undergrad applied for an undergrad research scholarship, and she asked me who she should ask for a recommendation. I suggested our boss, because she's in his lab. "No, I want to get a recommendation from someone who does interesting research, from someone whose lab I'd be willing to work in if I get the scholarship. I want to work with a professor whose interested in my proposed research." Very amusing.  When she first joined the lab, she told me all about her activities for gifted people that she was involved with. I guess I had higher expections for her, as she was a super duper honors student and had done research before.  Having an undergrad was interesting, but I'm glad it's over now. Undergrads are supposed to be kind of flaky. When I was an undergrad researcher, I thought that I must be a major a pain in the ass for my grad student. In retrospect, I probably wasn't so bad.  Right now, I don't have a lot of interest in other people when I'm in lab. All day, my only thought is "Nanoparticles! Nanoparticles!" If you're not a nanoparticle or think that you might be dating a nanoparticle, I'm not interested.    - posted by Roz @ 6:16 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    I wake up yelling crazy things at night, like "NO!

Last night I was web-stalking my lesbian teamate only to discover in horror that she's now "straight." A photo album from her wedding shoot was posted on the internet. My former teamate, dressed in pink, was shown in various states of cuddling and affection with her new huz-bin. The pictures were all sorts of wrong. My teamate looked miserable and awkward. This woman is such a dyke, and my coach did that to her, turned her to the dark side!  Actually, I think that her parents had something to do with it. After she was off the team, she told her parents that she was bump-bumpin' the coach. Her parents were horrified. Her dad threw her against a wall and threatened to kill the coach. Then she graduated from college and moved back home. She wanted to go to med school, but the only school that accepted her was in her hometown, where her dad worked. I'm guessing her options were either no med school or med school plus marrying a dude. She choose the later. - posted by Roz @ 2:21 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    Someone else has tried, unsuccessfully, to repeat CP's experiments. A grad student in my former boss' new lab tried for several months to get CP's magical experiments to work before giving up. So, like, the reason I can't get it to work isn't because I'm dumb.  Now CP is sending email to my former boss saying, "you are a bad person and a horrible scientist." Then my ex-boss goes into her lab and asks the students if they also think she's a bad person and a horrible scientist. She has low self-esteem. My response would probably be, "I'm not sure about the bad person part, but you're definitely an incompetent scientist." That would earn me brownie points!  - posted by Roz @ 1:52 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Sunday, March 28, 2004   Only interesting if you're a major lab geek:  I'm consistantly amazed by the quantity and quality of research coming out of my lab, considering that NONE of our equipment fucking works.  We're a bacteria-growing lab, and we need two pieces of equipment, shakers and centrifuges. Our vintage 1982 shakers are always breaking, and our vintage 1979 centrifuges are jerry-rigged and break down constantly too. Sometimes, we make protein in our lab, and we'd like to run this protein on a gel. Good fucking luck finding a functional gel rig!  I have two other problems with my lab that are unique to me. First, I CANNOT get a fucking PCR to work in our lab's PCR machines, but if I use another lab's PCR machine, everything is fine. Second, before I joined the lab, we only had a short range UV light box. Somehow, people were able to cut out gel bands under short range UV light AND successfully use this DNA for cloning. Not only use this DNA for routine cloning, but they can also miraculously use their NUKED DNA to make huge plasmid libraries! I could never get this to work as short range UV nukes the fuck out of my DNA (but not anyone else's). Supposedly,, there's this weird, jerry-rigged strategy for cutting DNA with short range UV, but it never worked for me. Fortunately, I stole myself a long range UV lamp from my former lab.  Supposedly our lab is well-funded, and the bosses are famous. But we can't buy new centrifuges, gel rigs, or shakers. In the past year, all of my new lab's original microcentrifuges have died, and our bosses' are too cheap to replace them. Fortunately, I stole a bunch of microcentrifuges from my former lab. The other funny thing is that while we're constantly repairing our janky 1980s equipment, we're spending G's like their going out of style on repairs. I bet it would be cheaper to just buy new equipment.   We have a few highly functioning machines, costing 100s of G's. Unfortunatley, I don't use these particular machines. No, I just want to grow some bacteria and spin them down, but that's a big fucking ordeal in my lab. - posted by Roz @ 4:28 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Thursday, March 25, 2004   I got a $6.99 haircut by a woman affectionately refered to on campus as "Edward Scissorhands." The last time I went there, two years ago, I vaguely remember her double-fisting it with the scissors. This time she cut my hair with only one pair of scissors, but those scissors were snipping the whole time, even if she when she wasn't actually cutting my hair. The whole process took all of 3 minutes.  ECO insisted on the haircut because my hair's been looking "puffy" lately. This puffy look makes certain features of my face appear larger than life. ECO feels that the excess hair draws undue attention to my beak. Getting a haircut creates the illusion of a small beak because it garners more attention for my other facial features, drawing attention away from the beak.   It's like getting a nose job for only $6.99. - posted by Roz @ 5:44 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    I'm a big women's basketball fan, and my team is in the sweet 16. Lesbians are prevalent both as players and coaches in women's basketball, but it's all sort of in the closet. People don't want to acknowledge it. For example, when a woman's game is televised and in the rare case that the coach is not a lesbian, the announcers will always make a big point of showing the coach's huzbin. But they never show the wives.  The star player on my school's team is a big bull dyke, but I bet most people watching the games don't realize this. There are lots of signs of her lesbianinity. For one, I see her out at the gay bars. But the most obvious sign is whenever she scores a basket at a home game: her picture is displayed on a big monitor in the middle of the stadium. Under the picture, her nicknames are listed: Big Stack and Big Girl. And I don't think this tips people off. Any straight woman would be fucking pissed to be advertised as a "Big Stack", but this player is proud of her nickname. Sometimes opposing fans display signs mocking her size: the player acknowledges the signs and gets a laugh out of them. For example, "Mack (the football coach) called and he wants his linebacker back." The lesbian player thinks these signs are cool.  There was an article in the local newspaper about the woman's basketball coach. The article said that during the early 90s, there was a whisper campaign against the coach during recruiting season. "Don't go to that school, the coach is a big bull dyke and will try to molest you." Consequently, recruiting suffered during the 90s. It all started to turn around early 00s, when the star bulldyke player signed with my school. Then more lesbians signed on, and my team is now stacked and ready to take the national title this year.  I hope Penn State gets their asses kicked in the tourney (they're also in the sweet 16). During the early 90s, the coach made a big point of saying that lesbians were not allowed on the team. If she discovered any lesbitarianism, you'd be kicked off the team. You're never going to win in women's basketball with an attitude like that. - posted by Roz @ 4:18 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Tuesday, March 23, 2004   I was sort of like my lab's gay guy before I came out. My whole life I'd been followed around by these sort of harmless, R(me) is gay jokes.   During my freshman year of college, I was having dinner with my sports teamates at a restaurant in a small midwestern town. My teamate commented on the lesbians in the restaurant. I was like, "No way, those aren't dykes. This is my hometown, so I know that there are no dykes living here." My teamate was like, "This is your hometown, right? Well, that just proves my point." I turned bright red and was like, "Nuh, uh!" I officially came out my junior year, but it wasn't shocking or scandalous. No, nobody found it particularly interesting. In fact, nobody had ever assumed me to be heterosexual. I think that the gay guy will have the same experience when he finally comes out.  The first person to think of me as a het was probably my grad school advisor. For 3 years, I worked in his lab as an out lesbian and looking very lesbionic. Yet, he didn't seem to notice this. - posted by Roz @ 5:42 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    The husband of the supermodel grad student finished his rotation and is no longer with us in the lab.  Both members of the supermodel couple are intensely jealous and possessive, both afraid that the other is cheating on them. The supermodel would often come to our lab to check on her husband, Fabio (not his real name). When Fabio wasn't here, she'd note how long Fabio had been missing from lab and who else in the lab was absent at the same time as Fabio. What I want to know is who in the hell did the supermodel think Fabio was cheating with? My lab consists of all men and two women, me and the German lady. The German lady hasn't been around lab this semester because of prelims, and I'm a lesbian. So what does the supermodel say to her Fabio? "Fabio, you were missing from lab for an hour today. The really hairy, stinky guy was also gone at the same time as you. What's going on Fabio? Are you cheating on me?" Or maybe she thought Fabio was cheating on her with the gay guy. I could see them hooking up. The gay guy is ultra femme, and Fabio is butch; they'd make a cute couple. - posted by Roz @ 5:23 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    The gay guy in my lab passed his prelims with flying colors.

I'm not sure that the German lady will pass with flying colors. Her presentations never make sense: she tells the results of a bunch of seemingly random, disjointed experiments. Then it's your job as the listener to 1) figure out the purpose of her project 2) figure out the meaning of her results.

A called me at exactly 3:00 central time. This was the first time she'd contacted me since she moved two years ago.   Lately, I've been emailing her repeatedly in an attempt to get CP's notebooks or to get any input about CP's experiments. No response. I've also emailed people in her new lab, and they told me: good luck getting CP's experiments to work.  So A called me today. She was polite and nice, but with none of the usual inquiries about my personal life. I wasn't offended. First, she addressed my interest in seeing CP's notebooks.  A: "I don't even know where CP's notebooks are!" Me: "I do. They're locked in a room in (A's former labspace). I can see them through the window, but I don't have a key to the room. Your secretary has the key." A: "Oh. Well, those notebooks probably won't help you. I doubt there's anything useful in his notebooks."  Next she proceeded to tell me about the research in her new lab. I got the impression that the people in her new lab had figured out that CP's stuff wasn't working, although she said nobody in her new lab had tried to repeat his experiments. Her lab appeared to be going in a completely different direction. Changing direction isn't what you would do if you'd just had several phenomenal papers. But if your publications weren't exactly as advertised, you'd try to do something else and hope nobody noticed that your original publications were bogus. Basically, A told me to stop trying to repeat CP's experiments, and she gave me suggestions for new experiments. These suggestions were my backup plan for my project in case CP's stuff didn't work. I guess now my backup plan is now the plan.  Interesting. A knows that I know that she's a fake and that CP's data is fake. One thing didn't make sense.  A: "I'm trying to get CP's appointment to the university extended until May so he doesn't get sent back to China. My secretary is writing letters to get him reinstated, but the people at (your university) don't want him in the building. Something about CP or his wife being violent, I don't know. I never got the complete story about what happened with CP. Do you want me to have CP try to work with you on your experiments?"  Me: "No, I'm just fine working by myself."  A isn't a total dumbass. Without explicitly telling me that CP's experiments were fake, she told me to do something else, to not try to build on his results. I feel this sense of closure. I don't have to keep trying to do this experiment.  - posted by Roz @ 4:24 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Monday, March 22, 2004   Dude! I grew some pot on the balcony, and it worked!

As I was putting my groceries on the checkout platform, a woman, late 30s and Jewish looking, came up behind me, "How do you like that butter?" Me: "What do you mean? It's butter." My thought bubbles, "Why is this woman talking to me about butter?" Woman: "But it's European butter." Me: "Oh, I just grabbed some butter."   Then she put a travel magazine on the platform, "I like to imagine getting away, even if I can't really get away." Me: "That's cool. Athens. (I read the title of the magazine.)" Woman, "Yes, my ex-girlfriend is going to Athens. She moved to Europe.... Random ex-girlfriend facts." Me: not very responsive to the putative flirting. Then I paid for my groceries and left. As I was leaving, I thought, was I just hit on?  I wasn't looking particularly cute today, but I was having a small beak day. I told ECO about being flirted with. Her response, "I just don't see it. You're not looking particularly hot today. You're having a regular day."  I don't go out in public much, as I'm kooped up in lab all day. This causes me to be half-baked socially.

First, I went to a local company lab to drop off some samples because this company is doing an experiment for me.

I sat down in a chair next to her desk, and talked about my samples. Then:  Softball dyke: "What's your number? I mean your credit card number." Turns bright red and mumbles something about asking me my number.  As I was leaving, she attempted some awkward conversation about the weather, again turning red.  I might have been flirted with, hard to say. I was wearing my grad student uniform, ragedy jeans and a t-shirt with bleach stains, so I didn't look particularly hot.

We got a little rowdy and started bashing Germans. Our friend was cool with the German-bashing, but her roomate was irritated with our racism.   But, is it really racist to dish Germans? ECO and I are both half German.  Germans are really irritating, and I hope to never have to go to Germany. The main reason we hate Germans is because they think they're better than everyone and they like to talk about how everything is so much better in Germany. (So go back to Germany and stop irritating everyone in America!)  When I was in high school, I carpooled to school with 2 German girls. It was really irritating because all they talked about, when they weren't speaking German, was how much America sucked. Even their mom joined in the America-bashing. Everyone was dumb, fat, and lazy in America, not like in Germany. It's interesting to note that the mom had an enormous ass, and the two girls sucked at school, even at math, a subject where Germans supposedly excel. Still, they continued to bash America in front of me, the hard-working, studious American with a small ass.  Then when I got to college, there was a German on my sports team. She was the worst player on the team, but for some reason, she thought she was the best player on the team (because she was German?). She liked to point out how much better everything was in Germany. Everyone on my team hated her. Her parents came to one of our athletic competitions and antagonized the other parents; They just thought they'd inform the other parents that everything was better in Germany. (Then go back to Germany... Oh, that's right, they don't have college athletic scholarships over there. So you just came over here to get your education paid for AND to let the Americans know that their country sucks?)  Now, there's a German in my lab. She's actually the nicest, least irritating German I've ever known. She's totally tolerable, but still she has some annoying German habits. She can't help it.  She likes to bang her mouse against the desk while yelling, "Hiken Zee Shiken." She even got a new, laser mouse, but still the mouse needs to be banged periodically. Ever notice how Germans like to pound on things unnecessarily? Sometimes they even hit themselves.  Also, she likes to talk loudly, actually yell, on the phone in German for hours at a time. (HIken Zee Shizen!) It's really distracting if you're trying to work at your desk. Fortunately, she's stopped doing this lately, so maybe she's gotten the hint.  The amino acids, lysine (K) and leucine (L), play a central role in my German labmate's project. When she gives group meeting, she prefaces her talk with, "In Germany, K is pronounced L, and L is pronounced K. So when I say K, I mean L, and when I say L, I mean K." The bosses are like, "no, no, no. We're in America now, so you're going to pronounce the words correctly." Apparantly, she didn't get the point. The next time she gave group meeting, she gave the same introduction, and again the bosses corrected her. Let's see what happens next group meeting.  ECO has a German in her lab too. She hates him. He's an especially irritating German. Before ECO began to passionately hate this guy, he invited us over to dinner at his house because he's gay and we're gay. It was really irritating because the entire conversation was about him. He speaks 5 languages and he plays 4 musical instruments. Blah. Blah. Blah... He's a total dumbass.. He told us, "You'll find this really hard to believe. I know, it's really hard to believe, but, my friends can't even believe it, but my brother is actually smarter than me. I know it's hard to believe." Why is it so hard for this dumbass to believe that someone is smarter than him? Probably because he's German.   - posted by Roz @ 5:51 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    Finally, the scientific truth about homosexuality.

This brand of patriotism is distinct because of its "yer either with us or yer our enemy" mentality.  This type of patriotism all started on September 11, and I can't help but think that the American people are being manipulated. Now, I know this may sound crazy, but I believe that there was some sort of conspiracy behind the terrorist attacks. No, I don't think Bush knew, but I think some of the evildoers in his administration knew ahead of time. It's possible that Karl Rove orchestrated the attacks or at least he knew about the planned attacks, but failed to stop them. He did this in order to drum up support for the Iraqi war and his vision of world domination.  I've been reading left wing websites to get support for my theory. You never can trust what you read on a website, and much of the evidence for a conspiracy can be explained away. The most convincing evidence that the government knew about the terrorist attacks but did nothing was this: It took a really long time for fighter jets to be dispatched to intercept the hijacked airlines. Seriously, WTF else does the military have to do all day, but protect the country, especially likely enemy targets, NYC and DC. You'd think they could get a fighter jet fired up in less than an hour, the time it took from when we first knew planes were being hijacked to when the plane hit the Pentagon. Is the military that incompetent? We're over fighting a war in Iraq, but god forbid we get attacked here, because it's gonna take a really, fucking long time to get those fighter jets reved up. - posted by Roz @ 12:37 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    On our way to school, ECO and I drive past Darque Tan, and inevitably, we see the orange people* congregated outside.

We know that we belong to this genre of people because we always get ignored in restaurants, stores, and just about anywhere we go in public.

A few months ago, he tried to get me to do his lab duty with the excuse that he couldn't do it because he had prelims. His job was to wash pipets- every 3 months or so, he had to perform a simple task, which takes 2 hours max. But he couldn't do it because he's a big fucking drama fag who has prelims. He's got to be gay, right? A straight man wouldn't be such a drama fag. Also, if he's so fucking stress out, why is his hair always perfect, his clothes always perfect, and he's always clean shaven.

They don't own a car, but their friends pick them up for church in a car with a bumper stick,"Big Bang Theory: Jesus said bang and it happened." So I assume that our neighbors are the genre of Christians who do not believe in evolution.  In spite of their Christianity, the neighbors are extremely nice to ECO and I. They love our kitties, are very friendly, and try to talk to us. At first, I couldn't understand what they were saying because of their hard-core, backwoods of Tejas accent. But now, I can carry on a conversation with them.  The neighbors are very nice, although a little unusual. This might be a mean thing to say, but, by their appearance, they're the sort of people that you might expect to see in the movie, "Deliverance". My first encounter with them was when I was moving in with ECO (U-Hauling). My friend and I were moving my futon upstairs. The husband (or huz-bin in Tejas-speak) came out of his apartment, grabbed the futon from me, and carried it upstairs. All this happened while he was clothed in only his panties. I soon learned that he regularly walks around the complex in just his panties.  Another memorable interaction with the neighbors happened while they had friends over. The women-folk were sitting outside in front of their apartment, cutting each other's hair. ECO and I went outside and were walking to our car when one of the woman stopped me, "Ma'am, my friend thought you was a boy and that you're a real, cute boy." The friend, who thought I was cute and just happened to be toothless, waved. I turned bright red and ran away. ECO politely thanked the woman for the compliment. I'm totally a babe-magnet.  ECO and I often wonder if the neighbors know that we're lesbians. It's pretty obvious that we're a lesbian couple, but it doesn't make sense that the Christians would be nice to us, if they knew of our lesbianinity. We've concluded that they probably think we're just roomates or sisters.  - posted by Roz @ 6:19 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Monday, March 15, 2004   Mother charged with murder for refusing a c-section  This is disturbing, or "deeply troubling" as President Bush might say.

However, whenever you'd ask him a question about his experiments or told him to stop grabbing your ass, he'd pretend to not speak English. "I'm sorry. I don't speak English."  2) People in the lab complained about CMF to C., my former boss' best friend/favorite grad student. (C has been mentioned in previous posts. She's the one who allegedly blew her committee.) C's explanation for CMF's ass-grabbing was that ass-grabbing was part of CMF's culture, and that if you didn't want your ass-grabbed, you just were jealous of him. The implication was that ass-grabbing was necessary for the continued scientific brilliance of CMF's research.  - posted by Roz @ 4:47 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    I've written extensively about CP. There was another guy in my former lab that I also hated. CP and this asshole did magical experiments together that nobody can reproduce, and neither of them will tell anyone how to repeat their magic.  Anyway, this other guy, CMF, creepy mother fucker, was a real asshole. CMF was straight, married with 2 children, and Asian. He didn't bother me that much, and I only had a few unpleasant encounters with him:  1) CMF asked me "what kind of things do you like to do with your girlfriend?" I asked him what he meant by that, and he giggled.  2) I sat next to him at group meeting once, and CMF kept trying to poke me. (Are we in kindergarden?) I picked up a book and whacked him. My former advisor witnessed this.  3) He surfed porn on my assigned lab computer. The computer just been reformated, but almost immediately, it was fucked up again. I was trying to figure out why the computer was all fucked up, and came across pics from rapecentral.com saved in CMF's folders. This guy had 2 lab computers all to himself, but still he felt the need to download pics of women getting raped to my computer.  I had it good compared to the rest of the lab: CMF particularly like one straight man in the lab. He liked him so much that CMF was always trying to grab the guy's ass. CMF also said sexually suggestive things to this guy. Once the innocent straight guy asked for the time. CMF replied by bending over in front of this guy, and saying, "It's time."  Someone complained to my former advisor about CMF's creepy behavior. Instead of being pissed off at CMF, she said that people in the lab were jealous of CMF because he was such a great scientist!  I never cease to be horrified at myself for joining that lab.  - posted by Roz @ 2:02 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    ProBush.com  I love this website. At first glance, it may seem like a pro-Bush website, but upon closer examination, it's actually making fun of Bush supporters. It's dripping with sarcasm, and it's so brilliant. I wish I could meet the person or people who created it. I love the 'random quotes' and the store section, where they sell random, stupid, crap to dumb Republicans, and the 'patriots' page, where they lure dumb people, with no concept of sarcasm, to sign the page.   The website was definitely not made by Republicans because ProBush.com has a sense of humor, unlike Republicans. - posted by Roz @ 12:48 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    Passive aggression  For the last few months, I've been trying to repeat CP's results, published in a high profile journal, with no success. I've asked everyone I can think of for advice on how to do Cp's experiments and get the same answer: "Good luck!" I've asked CP for help, but he is evasive, and won't tell me how he did his experiments.  CP was fired from his position last month, and now he's trying to get another postdoc position at this university to avoid deportation. He's talked to several professors at this university. It seems that many profs at my university don't believe CP's papers and are asking him a lot of questions about his past research.  So on Friday I got this email from CP asking me what experiments were done for his first author papers. He wanted to know how certain, basic points of the paper were proven. This is really retarded... He's the first author, and he doesn't understand his own paper!!! Plus, the questions he's asking me are answered in his paper. Just read your own paper, CP!   CP also requested that I send him a copy of a manuscript I've been working on.  So I replied to CP's requests... I answered the questions about his paper really vaguely. Then I emailed my manuscript, but in a format that he can't open. Next, I asked him a series of really detailed questions about how his experimental procedure, the one I've been trying to reproduce for months.   I was passive aggressive. I don't like to be passive aggressive, but I feel that this situation calls for it. - posted by Roz @ 12:36 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Friday, March 12, 2004   For lack of anything better to do, I'll blog about poop.  1- The first floor bathroom has acquired a new, nasty poop smell. This distinct poop smell is always present, at all times of day and night. The first stall is expecially stinky, and there's always skid marks in the toilet. ECO and I hypothesize that there's a new woman with especially stinky poop and who began working in the building about a month ago.  2- Today I had a 'torpedo poop'- The poop ejected from my butt with amazing force. The impact with the water caused a loud splash, and I was happy that there were no gossiping woman in the bathroom to hear it. - posted by Roz @ 11:36 AM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Thursday, March 11, 2004   Supposedly, I'm a woman, but there are many aspects of female behavior that I can't comprehend.  1- Why does it take woman so long to go to the bathroom, expecially if there's a line? (This behavior explains why there's always a line for a woman's bathroom.) Seriously, I could take a dump, pee several times, and change a tampon in less time than most woman take for a typical bathroom trip. What do woman do in that stall, all by themselves? Masturbate? There's no way you'd catch me masturbating in a crowded public restroom, while others are waiting in line... That's so rude. Are they masturbating? That's the only explaination for why it takes so long. Are they douching? I don't get it.  2- Why is going to the bathroom, like, the huge social event of the century for many woman? In my building, there's always woman in the bathroom for the sole purpose of socializing, gossiping, giggling, cackling. I don't mind it, except when I'm taking a huge dump, and then I'm in the restroom with two cackling woman while my ass is exploding. Horrible smells and sounds are coming from my ass-I don't want this to be a major social event; I want privacy. And it always happens that when I have to poop, there's a group of woman several feet away from me, and their gossip is interminantly interrupted by the sounds of my farts. It just seems like the bathroom is not the most pleasant place to gossip. Then I feel guilty for interrupting their conversation with poop-plopping sounds, like I'm breaking some etiquette rule, but I know I shouldn't feel guilty. Some people use the bathroom for its intended purpose-taking a dump. Do men have this problem? Is the bathroom a gossip venue for men? - posted by Roz @ 10:00 AM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Wednesday, March 10, 2004   Similarities between my boss and I we both have: -the same cell phone -the same wedding ring -the same birthday -a hot wife -a micromanaging, bitchy, 'force of nature' type of mom -the same ass (my wife pointed this out)  There are significant differences, mainly, my boss is a major George Bush fan. In fact, he has (or had in 2000) George Bush For President signs all over his lawn. He's also kind of squemish about lesbians.   But, I also have an unusual reaction to lesbians.

Yesterday, I accidently sent an email to my friend that I meant to send to my wife. My friend was all confused by my email. I think that I must have replied to the wrong message.  I've done this before. Once, I got an email from a local lesbian listserv. I meant to forward the message to my wife, but instead I replied to the sender with a message like, "I want to give you soft kisses. Do you want to play bump-bump later?"  I'm just happy that at least I've never sent an email to my boss that said something like, "Do you want to have sex tonight? I want to munch some pootang." At least to my knowledge, I've never done that.  Fear of email mishaps explains why I never send sexual email messages to my wife. I have this intense fear of fucking up and accidently sending the message to either my boss or my mom.  Also there's the problem of viruses: Sometimes viruses will pick random deleted emails to send to everyone in your address book. This happened once: my computer sent an old, deleted email to my boss. The message was pretty innoculous: I'd sent this particular email to my mom a few years prior, and it basically said, "I'll see you this weekend. Pick me up at the airport on Friday.. Blah..Blah." This explains why I try to avoid writing things like, "my boss is a fucking idiot" in emails. - posted by Roz @ 11:02 AM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Thursday, March 04, 2004   At the dinner, I sat across from the closeted gay man in my lab. He talked a lot about his girlfriend. And he talked about his prelims. It turns out that he hasn't worked out since December and has been gaining some weight. In fact, he's put on three inches around his waist and he feels soooo fat. He can't wait till prelims are over so he can go to the gym and work off those extra pounds. I think he wanted the other guys to say, "Noooo, you're not fat. You look fabulous," but they didn't. FYI: this guy is rail thin.  So he's definitely gay, right? No extremely thin straight man would talk about how he's been feeling fat lately! - posted by Roz @ 7:38 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    I've had my fun for the evening. It wasn't very fun. My whole lab (~30 people) crowded around one table in a Mexican restaurant. I ordered fish.... When my meal was served, everyone was like, "wow, you got a lot of food." On my plate was an excessively large piece of aluminum foil. I unwrapped it to find a tiny piece of fish garnished with cabbage. My meal should have been described more appropriately on the menu as 'an entire roll of roasted aluminum foil filled with lettuce and garnished with a smiggen of fish.' I'm so hungry now, and there's no food at home. Poor me. When my waiter took my plate he asked me if I needed a take-home box for my lettuce and aluminum foil. I declined.  I sat across from the one of the guests of honor. He had a sad look on his face and was clearly not having fun. He got his Ph.D. today, but still, that was not enough to make him happy.  After 2 hours of sitting at the table, nobody was attempting to escape, so I busted a move outside and called ECO to get me. I couldn't take it anymore, and I didn't even thank my boss for the wonderful dinner, my tiny little piece of fish. Fortunately, there are at least 30 people there, so nobody will notice when they all leave an hour from now. - posted by Roz @ 7:25 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    My rotator is so awesome, and her project is going so smoothly. I just know that if I were physically working on this project, it wouldn't be working as well. To put it more simply, my rotator is better at science than me. I have her under my servitude for another 15 days, and I plan on maximizing her scientific skills.  It's interesting that of all my grad school projects, the one that works best is the one that I'm not actually working on. You may wonder: what does this say about me?  Another interesting thing is that my bosses don't seem fired up about having my rotator join the lab. Although there's a lot of competition among first year students to join this lab, it would be retarded of my bosses to not take my rotator.   Compulsory grad school fun time  Tonight we have a lab dinner because two people graduated today. To celebrate my (now former) labmates being let out of prison, we have a compulsory celebration.

I wondered what in the hell she was talking about because she insisted that I had a disease. Later she informed me that "the gays have the AIDS." Therefore, since I am a gay, it's likely I'll get the AIDS.   Since then, it seems she educated herself on the issue, and discovered that it's highly unlikely that I'll get the AIDS.

WTF, he can't even lower taxes, and he's the lower taxes president. Maybe taxes for low income people were raised to make up for the rich people's tax cuts.

      Ganglia Saturday, February 28, 2004   Frightening!  Grad school scares the shit out of me! Today, I was reading the Ph.D. thesis of a grad student from my former lab. (I've mentioned this grad student previously; she's the one who discussed the size of her ass with my former boss.) Anyway, her thesis is frighteningly horrible. AND the really scary part is that my current bosses supposedly think that this thesis is the BEST thesis by any grad student EVER at this university. Not only is it poorly written, but her data doesn't support her conclusions AT ALL. In fact, her data supports the exact opposite conclusion.  I'm nervous about my own defense because she's published these incorrect results and conclusions, but my interpretation of these experiments is exactly the opposite of hers. My research builds off her crappy research. Actually, my results corroborate her results, but my conclusions are the exact opposite of hers.... Because I'm right, and this woman is really dumb (at science, not at giving blow jobs).  I don't have the blow job thing going for me, so it makes me nervous about my defense.  This woman's thesis and research was SO bad. There's only one thing to conclude from the shit-faced grins of the 4 men as they left her Ph.D. defense: her defense was a big fellatio-ridden orgy. After the defense, at least one of them commented, "That was the best defense EVER!" Her defense was closed to the public, so we'll never know for sure. - posted by Roz @ 1:20 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Friday, February 27, 2004   I have this thought at least once an hour: "When I'm finally done with grad school, I will feel more happy, relieved, and thankful than anyone who has EVER survived grad school EVER." I have this thought more often than I think about sex, but these days I think about sex very little because I'm SO stressed out.  I know that this obsessive thought probably isn't true, but let me tell you: I will be so unbelievably relieved when I'm done.  I'll probably think, "Wow that was a close call. I'm glad I made it out alive."    One time when I was in college, the po-pos came to my dorm room looking for me, but when they stopped by my room, I was downstairs smoking pot. The po-pos decided to wait for me in my room and chat with my roomate. I returned to my room, stoned, and found the po-po's waiting for me. I had a bag of weed and a pipe in my jacket pocket. Normally, I kept the weed on top of my desk, in open view. Anyway, the incident with the po-pos turned out fine... They gave me a warning to stop my dorm pranks. The po-pos didn't mention marijuana or suspect that there was marijuana in my jacket or that I was stoned.  After the po-pos left, I was so fucking relieved. That was a really close call! I could have lost my scholarship. But, luckily, I pulled through, and everything was fine.  That's how I'll feel when I'm done with grad school- like somehow, by divine intervention, I was able to get my degree. - posted by Roz @ 6:13 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Wednesday, February 25, 2004   Grad school is turning into a nightmare, and I'm sure that once it's over I'll have grad school nightmares for years to come. It's that traumatic.  Not much is new with CP. He's still crazy, and yesterday he either emailed or called me hourly. I didn't answer the phone or respond to his email. At one point in the day, I was in my boss' office discussing my paper (which is also turning into a big, fucking nightmare), and CP called my cell phone. Then he called my boss' office phone. Then he called my cell phone. We didn't pick up the phone, and I turned my phone off. When I turned the phone back on, there was the usual message from CP. "Help! It's CP! You must help me now! Call me! CP. This is CP." Apparently, he's calling everyone associated with my former lab, including people in Boston, asking for help. It's not clear what he wants or how anyone can help him.  Anyway, work is a nightmare. Apparantly, my paper figures look shitty, and I need to get more images. Then I need to repeat CP's experiments, get them to work, and make everyone feel better that fraudulent papers weren't published.  My bright spot in all of this is my rotator. She's awesome, does her work, doesn't bother me, and her project seems to be working. I have her for another month.  I also have an undergrad, which is more frustrating. My undergrad's experiments turn out all funky, even though I watch her while she's working. Undergrads need lots of time and patience, which I have little of. To add to my frustration, my undergrad refuses to write in her notebook or read a paper, prefering instead to crochet while we have downtime during an experiment. - posted by Roz @ 9:47 AM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Monday, February 23, 2004   CP called me several times today, but I didn't answer the phone. He wanted to use the printer in my lab. Then he called again tonight. I answered the phone because I wanted to ask CP who the stalker lady was. At first, he told me all about how he talked to human resourses about getting fired and stuff. Then I asked him who the Chinese stalker lady was, and he got all agitated. He denied knowing her. "I don't know who she is. I am from China and she is from China....(a bunch of crazy speak)...why you ask me this?" Me: "Oh, I just wondered if she had anything to do with why you got fired." CP:"Why you think that? You think about things too much. Do not think about her anymore!...(more crazy speak)" (Crazy-speak is yelling incoherently, not talking in complete sentences. It's a little like drunk-speak.) Then I asked if the reason he got fired had anything to do with research. Again, more yelling in crazy-speak.  Finally, he asked if I'd talked to my boss today, and I denied it. CP:"You are lying. I came to your lab today, and the people in your lab told me you were in the office talking to your boss for an hour. What did your boss say to you? Did he tell you why I was fired?" Me: "No, we were just talking about research." CP caught me in a lie. Oh well, all CP does is lie. Anyway, the reason that I denied talking to my boss was because my boss told me to not tell anyone that we had talked. - posted by Roz @ 7:40 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    More CP tidbits: About a month ago, the CP family flooded the sink in lab, which in turn flooded several floors underneath them.

There was too much potentially juicy gossip that my real boss wasn't telling me. The only thing I learned is that CP's wife attacked A's secretary by throwing textbooks at her. Not really that interesting in the scheme of things.  Also, A really, really wants to see CP's computer files, notebooks, and data. This is understandable if she thinks he's falsifing results, but not interesting gossip.  No new info on the true identity of the lady stalker. - posted by Roz @ 3:41 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    Okay, I chatted with my boss today about CP, and learned lots of stuff. 1) CP's lady stalker situation isn't what it appears. It's not at all related to CP getting a woman knocked up or having an affair. What's really going on is all on CP's computer, and that's why CP is really freaked out that they have his computer... The boss refused to give any more info. It's in my best interest to not know what's going on; I just have to trust him.  2) I now know the identity of the crusty old man who my former boss, A, is blowing in order to become famous. I had long hypothesized that A was blowing an old, crusty, highly-infuential man in order to enhance her reputation. Without actually saying that A gives a mean blow job, my real boss totally confirmed my hypothesis. Wow! I was right.  3) Then my boss and I debated the pros and cons of whether or not CP had faked his data. Even the cavalier, A, is concerned about fraud. My current task is to figure out what's going on by trying to reproduce CP's results.  I feel like I'm in some sort of spy/adventure movie.    - posted by Roz @ 1:31 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Saturday, February 21, 2004   CP just called me. He was concerned that our former boss' secretary received the estimate for computer repairs. (WTF! Why is he so concerned about getting the computer fixed?) Then he whispered, "A(former boss) is trying to kill me." Me, "Excuse me?" CP: "A is trying to kill me." Me: "I see. So how's are you doing CP?"   He proceeded to tell me about how he got fired. The director of the chem building came into the lab one day, saw the baby, and told CP that he couldn't bring the baby to lab. The director came back to the lab another time, saw the mattress, and told CP he couldn't have a mattress in lab. CP pleaded his case that he needed the mattress for his baby, but the director reminded him that the baby wasn't allowed in lab either. Then CP went on his interview, and his wife and baby spent the night in lab for two nights. During that time while CP was away, the chairman came into the lab while his wife was pumping her breast milk and told his wife that she couldn't do that in lab because it was against the rules and was a big liability risk for the university. Well, CP's wife got pissed and bitched out the chairman of the department!   That was just a summary of my conversation with CP, but it seems that there were several incidents when the chemistry department instructed CP to not bring his baby and mattress to lab. Still, CP pleaded his case to me that he was trying to follow the rules and is being discriminated against.   CP is trying to get another postdoc at UT with my current bosses. (Unbeknownst to him, they're not going to hire him.) CP is also extremely freaked out that they have his computer and all the personal info on his computer. He didn't go into detail, but he really, really doesn't want them looking at his email. There's email from me on his computer. I believe in one email I refer to my former boss (A) as 'retarded'. There's also an email from A's current postdoc. In the email the postdoc in Boston refers to her as 'the worst scientist ever' and 'a complete idiot.' There's also email from my euro boss on CP's computer. CP implied some of EB's emails are kind of deprecating towards A. CP: "You know I have emails from EB on my computer. EB knows the truth about A that she is a very bad person and a liar." Then he started talking about how EB will help him because he knows that truth about A. (Unbeknownst to CP, EB may think A is crazy, but that doesn't mean that he thinks CP isn't crazy.) Personally, I'm kind of excited about the possibility of A reading CP's email, assuming she does. Then she'll know what people really think of her.     - posted by Roz @ 7:35 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Thursday, February 19, 2004   Something I want to know: How does CP drive around campus all day?  He's always driving around on campus during the day.  During the day, there are guards posted at the campus entrance. The guards don't let you drive on campus unless you have a permit or pass or something. I've tried it. The guards think I'm a homicidal lesbian terrorist or something and they turn me away.  Somehow CP, who has a restraining order to not be on campus, is able to drive all over fucking campus all day long! - posted by Roz @ 7:20 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    I got a complementary email from my euro boss today.

It was a number I didn't recognize, and I answered the phone. It was CP. He was frantic: "Hello. I need help. I need you to come outside and help me immediately. I'm outside your building."  I told him I had to finish my work before I went outside.  Twenty minutes later I went outside to find CP talking to a random undergrad and holding the undergrad's cell phone. When he saw me, he gave the undergrad her cell phone back. He opened his car door to talk to me. Outside it was about 70 degrees, but inside his car it was 95 degrees. He had the heat on high and was wearing a coat. Nasty, white crud was encrusted on his lips. In the back seat, his baby was bundled up and screaming. She was thinking, "I'm fucking hot, and I'd like some fucking teet!"  He needed me to get his mail in the chem building and to give a letter to our former boss' secretary. He explained in detail what the letter was about: it was an estimate for repairing the laptop that he used for work before he was fired. The laptop belonged to the university. He wanted to make sure that the secretary knew exactly how much it would cost to fix his/the university's laptop. WTF! If I'd just gotten fired from my job, I'd be like, "fuck you. figure out how to fix the laptop yourself." No, CP is concerned that the university fixes the laptop.  So I went into the building and got CP's mail.  When I returned to CP's car, the baby was still screaming, and CP was freaking out.   He said, "If anyone asks, say that I didn't sleep in the lab. You never saw the mattress. Also, tell them that my baby was never in the lab. Where's (your current boss)?  Me: "He's out of town."  CP: "Oh. I need him to help me. But I can't even go into the building because they will call the police and have me arrested if they see me. If anyone asks, you didn't see me on campus today. I will be arrested if they see me on campus. I need you to pick up my mail everyday."  Me: "What? Everyday? Why can't your wife get your mail?"  CP: "She'll be arrested if they see her."  Me: "Can't you have them forward your mail to your house?"  CP (agitated): "I must go now. My baby is very hungry. She has been screaming for half hour."  I was aiding a fugitive. Great! Also, why should I say that I never saw the mattress? Everyone knows about the mattress. Doesn't he realize that when they changed the locks on the lab and packed up all the stuff, they found the mattress? Is he pleading ignorance of a mattress in the lab? Also, why is he fucking driving around on campus if he's gonna get arrested? Why doesn't he just call the secretary and ask her to forward his mail?  Yesterday, I saw CP, his wife, and the baby going into a campus library. It looked like they were going to chill there for a while. He's totally going to get arrested for chillin' with the baby in the library. It's like he's fucking asking for it. He's like, "Go ahead. Someone pleeeeaaaze kick my ass. I really, really want to get fired, arrested, and sent back to China." - posted by Roz @ 2:11 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Wednesday, February 18, 2004   I turned my cell phone off during seminar, and found a message when I turned it back on.

Yesterday morning he came into lab and found the locks changed. The secretary and a grad student were packing the computers and other stuff inside the locked lab. Then the dean of the department approached CP with a letter from my former boss, terminating his employment. CP was instructed by the dean to leave the building and never return.  CP claimed that these events were entirely unexpected. For the past month, there were construction workers preparing CP's lab for a new prof, and he didn't notice this? Anyway, his new plan is to get a postdoc with another prof at the university... after he was instructed by the dean to never return to the chemistry building. (WTF!)   Now CP is in the country illegally, because his visa is dependent on his employment with the university. His wife doesn't have a student visa, so she's also here illegally.  It's especially fucked up because CP could have taken any number of small steps to prevent this diaster. I told him what to do a year ago, but he wouldn't listen to me. It's a tragedy, but it's entirely of his making... It's as though, in some twisted way, he wanted this to happen.  By the way, CP does have a home. I drove by his apartment last night after he called to tell me about his lab eviction. His car was parked outside the apartment, so I assume he still lives there.  Today I saw CP and his wife outside the chemistry building. They had returned to retreive their personal belongings from the lab and were packing them into their car.  Later ECO and I went to lunch. We saw CP, the baby, and the wife. CP looked at me and then walked away. It was weird.     I don't think that the Straight Pride March happened as scheduled. Instead, I saw an especially large number of Christians preaching on campus. They were holding signs showing pictures of burning buildings and yelling things like, "you're gonna burn in hell." The Christians are always on campus aggressively handing out pamphlets, and yet they have the nerve to say that the gays are recruiting. I've never seen a gay recruiting. Mostly, the Christians stay away from me; I guess they realize that I'm just not gonna be saved. - posted by Roz @ 11:43 AM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    My rotator asked for more competent cells...again. - posted by Roz @ 11:18 AM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Tuesday, February 17, 2004   Fascinating website  You might think I'm being sarcastic, but truly I genuinely find this person's blog fascinating.

Today I got an email from my former boss' secretary requesting me to remove any "items of a personal nature" from the lab where CP and his family are living. (What the hell does she think-that I live there too?!) Tomorrow at 5pm a new professor will officially move into the lab and any remaining items will be thrown away.  CP does have another lab space to move into. It is an unused lab possessed by my current, real boss. However, I suspect that my boss will draw the line at having a mattress and a woman breastfeeding a baby in the lab.  I've been meaning to drive by CP's apartment to see if his car is there. The whole story that CP, his wife, and baby are all living in a chemistry lab is TOO far-fetched. It would make sense if CP alone was living in the chemistry building, but not the whole family. I'm going to drive by his house sometime this weekend, preferably early-morning, to see for myself what's going on. It's too weird that he's living in a lab.   I know science pays poorly, but not that poorly. Or does it?

I had trouble getting bacteria to grow, and when my cultures did grow, the bacteria did odd things, like turned different rainbow colors. About two years ago, my weird problems stopped, and suddenly, I was able to competently perform experiments.   Strangely, in the past month, all my weird experimental problems have come rushing back to haunt me. My new problems coincide with me getting my own mini-lab, consisting of a rotator and an undergrad. Now we (my brood and I) have illogical and unexplainable nuclease problems, problems getting bacteria to grow, and problems getting phage to infect bacteria (usually people have the opposite problem- unwanted phage infection.) I don't know if these problems are all related to my brood. Yesterday, I was all alone in lab, but I couldn't run an agarose gel to save my life. I can't explain it. - posted by Roz @ 6:41 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Saturday, February 14, 2004   Today I am making competent cells for the last time ever as a grad student.

My rotator has gone through 150 reactions of competent cells in 1 month, and consequently, I find myself making competent cells for the 3rd time in 2 months. (I do a fair amount of cloning, and it takes me about 2-3 years to go through as many competent cells as my rotator has in one month.)  At least, there are 4 plasmids to show for the 150 reactions of competent cells, and I didn't have to make any of them.  My rotator has completed the cloning part of her project, so there's no need for her to have competent cells anymore. I'm going to be very suspicious if she asks for more competent cells. - posted by Roz @ 1:23 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Thursday, February 12, 2004   I've been thinking about CP a lot lately, as you can probably tell from my blogging material. One thing I've been wondering is this: did my former boss know about CP's mental problems before the rest of us. Maybe that's why she hated him.  But it doesn't make sense for 2 reasons: 1- Why would you hate someone for having benign mental problems? Was he hurting someone? In that case, why didn't my former boss fire him years ago? Which brings me to my next point:  2- Why would you have all of the data coming from your lab depend on a mentally unstable person? (CP was the primary source of data for the lab. Essentially, all projects required CP's expertise at some point, and he is an author on most of the papers coming out of the lab.) If CP is/was mentally unstable, it's possible that he was fucking with the data. In other words, if you were a new professor, would you want your reputation to depend on a crazy nutjob?   So why didn't she just fire him if she knew he was nuts?  If she doesn't think that he's nuts, why doesn't she write him a rec letter and help him get a job, so that he's not homeless and camping out in her old lab?  My former boss is also a nutjob, but that's a story for another day. - posted by Roz @ 7:58 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    Update on the woman who hasn't shown up in lab for 4 years but is still getting paid  I haven't seen her paystub in the lab mailbox for 2 months now.

I'm accurately listed as a fourth year grad student on the website.  My Chinese stalker has given up on me:( (It made me feel loved to have a stalker.)

Here's her email:  Hello, r (me),  I don't know whether you have sent my email to the right person. My boy  friend CP is a pure Chinese. He grew up in China. We were  classmates in the high school. He left China for American at the end of  1999. He went to the (amercian university) in Jul.2000 and has  being working as a post doctor in Professor (my crazy former boss's) lab since  then. Before Pro. (my crazy former boss) went to the (another unversity), I could call him. But, after  Pro. (my former boss) left (american university), he began to work with other professor in this  University, and therefore his phone number changed.  You may be very familiar with the following papers:  (list of paper's that CP and I are co-authors)  From these papers, I think you and CP are cooperators. You may be  familiar with him and might be possible to help me in finding his phone  number.  Miss r, I can say I never tell lies. Also, I don't think CP tell  lies, because to be honest is the most important personality for a  scientist. If this CP is not the person I'm looking for, I should say  sorry to him. And again, I ask you to help me to contact the right CP, who once worked in the (department), once  more. You are greatly appreciated for your kindness. And I also promiss I  won't bother you again.   Usually, I use the email address (CP's secret email address) to contact him.  However, he always fails to receive my emails because he is very busy. He  has another email address (CP's official email address) which he told me I cannot  send my emails to.  I forward the following email to you as a support to prove that I am  honest. Believe me, please. And I think you won't refuse to help a person  who are really in need of help, will you?  Any way, please reply this email. I don't expect you to think I was playing  joke with you or bother you deliberately. I respect you because you are so  kind. I am looking forward to hearing from you.  Best wishes to you.

Recently, a player on a men's sports team was suspended for 2 games for assaulting a woman. I was on a college sports team. During my time on the team, I was suspended for 2 weeks and several games for smirking at the coach. I also did other disrespectful things, which were outlined in my suspension report. Like, once I didn't turn around when she called me during a game. Because it was noisy and I didn't hear her. Other stuff like that.  So my punishment for smirking was worse than this guy's punishment for assaulting a woman.  My freshman year, my coach was boinking a player on the team. My assistant coach knew about the boinking and reported the head coach to the athletic director for this unethical conduct. The asistant coach was prompty fired, and my head coach continued boinking. The head coach claimed that the assistant was fired for insubordination. But everyone knew the real reason, and it was true that my coach was hooking up with a player.  My head coach was a big dyke, but always claimed that she was hetrosexual. Whenever we had recruits, she suddenly had a boyfriend, and a random man was present at all recruiting dinners. Then we never saw the random man again. One reason that my coach hated me is because I said things around the recruits, like "Is this your boyfriend Coach? I didn't know you had a boyfriend!" That totally, fucking pissed her off, but she couldn't do anything about it.  Also, not neccessarily around recruits, she would say, "That man is so fucking hot!" Sometimes I said, "But don't you think that woman over there is hot." Again, that really fucking pissed her off. But these weren't things that she could write on my suspension papers.  Okay, I know I was a brat.  I remember my recruiting trip, one particular moment. I was watching practice, and the coach sat down next to me on the bench. She began stroking my thigh and telling me about her ex-boyfriend. I thought, "Yeah right! I'm sure you have an ex-boyfriend!" Anyway, I was strangely aroused by the stroking, and she stroked my thigh several during the trip.  Then I went to college. I was kind of into my coach my freshman year. Once during practice, she came over to me and grabbed my crotch in order to demonstrate an athletic move. In reality, the crotch grab was unnecessary. I found myself strangely aroused and unable to perform athletically for the rest of practice.  By the time my sophomore year rolled, I knew about the other player my coach was boinking. Also, my 30-something coach had gotten braces, and she decided that washing her hair was bad so she stopped doing it. Her appearance went downhill, so I no longer found her physically attractive. I started to think that my coach was dumb, slimy (physically and metaphorically), and gross, and I didn't want her to grab or stroke me anymore. As a result, our relationship deteriorated, and by my senior year, we spoke to each other as little as possible, except for, of course, my occassional bratty remarks which pissed her off.  I really don't know why, but I took a bratty pleasure in annoying my coach, as I do with all people I don't like. My mom really got on my coach's nerves. Whenever my parents came to a match, my mom would try to talk to my coach about really boring, annoying stuff, like traffic and the weather. I loved to watch! It was so awesome. Normally I'm embarrassed by my mom annoying people in public, but I was totally into it when my mom talked to my coach! My coach had to talk to my mom AND she had to be polite and nice even though she couldn't stand my mother! I could tell that talking to my mom irritated the crap out of her, so I took a sick pleasure in it.  I'm like a sadist or something. - posted by Roz @ 3:44 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    My former labmates in Boston know about CP's homelessness. They just emailed me to ask if it was true.

I just want to hear his  voice, otherwise I would get mad. He told me he would call me. But I didn't  receive any call from him. I have tried my every effort to contact him by  phone,however, I do not know his phone number. Although you do not know his  telephone number,either. I think it would be easier and possible for you to  find his number than me. It's almost imposible for me to find it because  I'm in China. Maybe you will think I am mad. I really feel pain. I cannot  live without him. I just want to hear his voice. This is why I am here  begging for your kind help.  Anyway, please give me a reply. I am looking forward to hearing from you.

I forwarded the email to CP. Then this morning, I got a phone call from the same person, a woman in China. She urgently needs to talk to CP, and she knows that I work with him. I told her that I don't work with CP anymore.  Obviously, CP doesn't want to talk to this woman. If she can get in touch with me but not him, then he's avoiding her.  There's a crazy story behind CP, and I wonder who this woman is. Is she the mother of CP's baby left behind in China? Somehow I can't see CP as a womanizer. He's short, dorky, and very, very stinky.

While I was there, I walked by CP's lab. I realized why he's being evicted now as opposed to earlier.  My former lab consisted of two neighboring rooms. When my old advisor left, renovation of the bigger lab room began. Now, workers are tearing down a section of the wall that joins the two labs, in order to make the lab space contiguous.  It seems there might be liability concerns with having a woman breastfeed her infant on a construction site.  The main thing about CP's situation that baffles me is that there are no personal possessions in the lab. No clothes, no diapers, no bottles, no pacifiers. That's what I noticed the last time I visited the lab a few weeks ago. I don't know if they keep food there because I didn't look in the refrigerator. It didn't even occur to me until now that they might keep food in the lab refrigerator: Bread, milk, eggs, formaldehyde, thioglycolic acid.  You can see that there might be some liability concerns for the university.  The only things in the lab are: desks, random chemicals, and an old pull-out sofa mattress that the whole family sleeps on. Also in the lab are all of the library books on campus about both electron microscopy and viruses. The books were all due back at the library on January 17, 2001. No wonder I can't find any books that I want at the library.  Another thing that's weird is his job situation. Obviously, he can't support his family on his postdoc salary, so he's been looking for jobs for about 6 months. He applied for a lot of jobs, but only really hard-to-get jobs, like professorships at Harvard, MIT, Stanford. He could probably get a good-paying and easier-to-get industry job or even a job as a professor at a small college, but he didn't apply for these jobs. Because he's CRAZY. - posted by Roz @ 12:19 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Thursday, February 05, 2004   The creepy waitress/college student/porn star  ECO and I first met the creepy waitress/college student/porn star at a local diner. She was our waitress, and she stared at ECO and I while we ate. At the end of the meal, ECO went up to the counter to pay the bill. Creepy waitress (CW) told ECO that she thought ECO and I were a cute couple. Subsequently, whenever we've gone to this restaurant, CW's face lights up when we walk in the door. She is always our waitress, even if we're not seated in her section. And she stares at us while we eat. She's also told us that we are cute more than once. We don't go to this restaurant very often, but when we do, CW is always working.  CW is probably about 21 years old. According to a friend, she's cute, but in a creepy sort of way. She kind of reminds me of myself when I was 21 because I was kind of creepy then.   I did undergrad research and had a crush on a postdoc in the lab next door. Once, I barked at her. (I don't know why I did that.) My bark drew her attention, and she looked at me. Then I turned bright red and ran away because I was kind of creepy.  I may still be creepy. One of ECO's collegue's thinks that I'm cute. I should be flattered that someone finds me attactive. Instead, it's disconcerting. You see, the people that Erin's collegue finds attractive are all CREEPY.  To wrap this up, CW is also a porn star. Last night, I went to the debut of a lesbian movie made by a lesbian porn production company. CW was in the movie.  I was never a porn star. - posted by Roz @ 7:22 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    I was having trouble coming up with blog fodder the past few days, but of course, crazy shit always happens to the people around me (not necessarily to me directly). - posted by Roz @ 10:25 AM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    A few months ago, CP was trying to get his mom to come to the US so that she could help take care of the baby.

This caused the woman's daughter to univite her mom to the grandson's 7th birthday party. Lesbian grandma (LG) is pissed off about being uninvited to the birthday party, but she's not backing down.

Also, it seems like he might be up to things even crazier than this because my boss kept saying, "Is there anything else that you want to tell me in confidence?" I told him about how CP won't tell me how he did a published procedure and how he's flaked on helping me with TEM. But this didn't seem to be the crazy information he was looking for, and I wasn't aware of any illegal or unethical activities by CP. He concluded the conversation by telling me to have nothing to do with CP, and I told him I'd already come to this conclusion on my own.   I really wasn't aware that CP was living in the lab. I thought he had a home, and as of November, I'm sure he had a home because I picked him up there. I know that his wife and baby spent the night in lab when he was on a job interview a few weeks ago. His wife is a student, so he told me that his wife had to stay on campus while he was gone because she can't drive. It made enough sense, although it seemed like she could just ride the bus. But in retrospect it doesn't make sense.   One Sunday afternoon a few weeks ago, I was walking to the gym, and I saw CP outside the chemistry building. I said hi to him, and he directed me to watch his stuff and wait for a taxi while he parked his car. The taxi never came, and he returned 20 minutes later. I asked him when his flight was, and he said 5pm. The current time was 4:20pm. I was like, holy shit, dude, I'll take you to the airport. We made it to the airport at 4:45pm. He got on the flight, went to his interview, and didn't get the job. This was his only job interview. Anyway, the suspicious thing is that when I was walking back from the gym later that evening, I saw his car parked in front of the chemistry building again. It didn't make sense why his car would be there because his wife doesn't drive (supposedly). I just assumed it was someone else's blue 1990 Toyota Corolla that I'd never seen before parked in front of the chemistry building on a Sunday night during winter break. Maybe the wife and baby were sleeping in the lab because they had nowhere else to go, not because his wife couldn't drive home.  In conclusion, I think CP is getting 86ed back to Asia. I feel bad for his daughter, but not for CP. He brought his back luck on himself.  Ironically, he named his daughter, A, the same name as my crazy former boss, who, according to cp, has ruined his life. I don't know if ironic is the right word; crazy is more descriptive.  Today ECO asked me how I always manage to attract nutjobs.   - posted by Roz @ 8:45 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    Common misconceptions among materials scientists about biology  1) Viruses can swim. (They can swim, but can they fly?)  2) My former advisor is the inventor of a popular drug discovery method. (She was in middle school when this approach was invented during the early 80s.)  - posted by Roz @ 9:30 AM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Tuesday, February 03, 2004   I haven't been blogging lately, but I've thought a lot about the advice a professor at my undergrad institution gave to me before I went to grad school: Don't join a lab where the professor will use you as a human cannonball. Then she implied that my undergrad advisor did this to his grad students.  I left for grad school, all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, and I joined THE human cannonball lab, a lab which puts all other human-cannonball labs to shame..  A lot of grad students are in labs where their advisor doesn't know their name. I am (or was) in a lab where the advisor tries to actively screw over people. Because she's psycho.  Today she did something psycho and it pissed me off. I shouldn't be upset, I should have expected it.  Normally, when you publish results about a plasmid, other labs may write to you requesting the plasmid. Ethically, you are obliged to send them the published plasmid, although some labs don't send plasmids to other labs. Today I asked my former lab in Boston to send me a published plasmid. My former boss (AKA Psycho) refused, saying that she wanted to control what she sent to other labs. Then I looked on her lab's recently (within the past month) updated website. I'm listed as a grad student in Psycho's lab. When the lab first moved to Boston, I sent them a bunch of plasmids that I'd made along with maps, but she's not going to return the favor.  This plasmid isn't terribly difficult to make. I'd just have to spend $200 of grant money to order a parent plasmid and primers. It would take me a few days to make it. But I don't need to make it because someone in Psycho's Boston lab is going to send me the plasmids behind her back.  What other crazy people do I have to deal with? Well, there's a postdoc in Psycho's lab, here at Tejas with me. The stress of being in the crazy bitch's lab is getting to him, and he's on the verge of being sent to the looney bin. I won't go into his crazy personal life, but here's why he pisses me off.  He's published two papers that employ the same procedure, although the procedure is described differently in each paper. Now I am trying to use this procedure, but have been having difficulty getting it to work. I decided to ask the crazy postdoc for help. He said that neither published procedure is correct, but guess what? He won't tell me the correct way to do the procedure.  When I talk to him, our conversations are like this:  ME: What temperature do you use at this step?  postdoc: A (my former boss) is so mean to me. Everyone in America is so mean to me.  ME: Let's stay on topic here. How long do you let this reaction go?  postdoc: I am a victim. I must speak out or my voice will not be heard. I am treated very badly in America.  He's going to be committed any day now.  - posted by Roz @ 7:06 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)

      Ganglia Friday, January 30, 2004   I noticed just now that my jacket has my name written on the label, and I remember why my jacket is labeled.  Before I left for college my mom insisted that I label all of my clothing, right down to my panties. It's an urban legand among moms that their children's clothing will be stolen when they go off to college.   Maybe the labels were a deterrent, but nobody tried to steal my clothes in college. Sadly for me, nobody was even remotely interested in stealing my panties. When I went to college, I was at least hoping someone would be intested in my panties.  Lately, I've been wanting some new clothes. Not just because I'm sick of having clothes with my name written on the label, but because my clothes are just plain janky and so 1994. I wear jeans and a t-shirt everyday; my clothes are stained with bleach; my clothes make me look janky. Unfortunately, I probably will not be able to afford new clothes, for like, 10 more years. - posted by Roz @ 1:37 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Thursday, January 29, 2004   My trip to the printer provided me with blog fodder:  I printed out a few papers, and then I went across the hall to retrieve them. While digging through the pile of newly printed papers, I noticed directions for entering the Maxim hometown hotties competition. Without thinking, I blurted out, "Who's entering the hometown hotties competition?", which attracted the attention of everyone in the office. I kept digging for my paper and discovered an email for S. Goddess, the supermodel. She's been approved for the competition, so maybe she'll be in Maxim.  Normally, you don't encounter supermodels in science, so it's interesting for me to have the husband of a supermodel (let's just call him Fabio) in my lab. It's also interesting because it seems that signs of his supermodel wife permeate the lab. - posted by Roz @ 9:20 AM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Tuesday, January 27, 2004   My banner ad is about competent cells- proof that there is a program searching the content of my blogs for the appropriate banner ad.  I figured it out- there's an Asian black market for competent cells. Yesterday, my rotation student asked me for more competent cells. I was like, 'But there's still 10 reactions in my freezer box, that's enough for your ligations." She was bummed, but I told her I'd make more.  Better yet, I'll have her make competent cells. - posted by Roz @ 6:01 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    The supermodel grad student's husband is such a dog; I can't believe this guy is married to a supermodel.

Melissa Ferrick even wrote a song about racial stereotypes and gay stereotypes. Something like this: "If you let little girls play with trucks, their sexuality gets all screwed up. And Jewish men make good lawyers, and the Chinese know how to do laundry. And who really cares about the Vietnamese." Very profound.  Well, I have another stereotype to add to the list. (Non-science people may be bored by this.) Asians use a lot of competent cells. (Competent cells are bacteria that are 'competent' to absorb recombinant DNA, and so they are useful for cloning.) An Asian rotation student in Erin's lab once used like 100 reactions of competent cells in 3 days. This means that she transformed 100 different ligations in 3 days. That's an unusually excessive amount of cloning. Was she eating the competent cells for breakfast?  The reason I'm bringing this up is because I have a similar rotation student, who eats competent cells for breakfast. She's not as bad; I think she's only used 35 reactions in one week. It's not unreasonable, except that she hasn't done 35 ligations. I don't want to diss my rotation student because she's bad ass. She just needs to slow down with the competent cells.  So remember: Keep the competent cells away from the Asians. - posted by Roz @ 5:07 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Tuesday, January 20, 2004   Fighting Bioterrorism  The guys in my lab want to kick the gay guy's ass. Not because he's gay, but because he's a lazy suck-up. Supposedly, he often goes to the boss' offices with the exclusive intention of brown-nosing. I wish I knew how he managed this. Whenever I've gone to their office to talk to them about my paper, they say they're too busy and shoo me away.  Anyway, the gay guy worked at a biotech company before joining grad school. Everyone at the biotech company wanted to kick his ass because he was a lazy suck-up. On Sept. 11, 2001, he was so distraught over the terrorists that he had to go home from work early. The next day he went to work and announced that he was dedicating his life to fighting bioterrorism. In pursuit of this goal, he decided to go to grad school.  When he joined grad school, he applied for a government fellowship from the newly formed, department of homeland security. He's really stoked about his fellowship because it entails doing a 'fighting terrorism' internship with the government.  Terrorism smerorrism. That's what I think. The terrorists are too busy climbing around on money bars to launch a bioterrorism attack.  - posted by Roz @ 3:15 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Monday, January 19, 2004   Another poop story:  This happened my freshman year of college. My roomate and I were the hellions of our dorm, and we disliked our housefellow. We began to think she was kind of crazy at our first dorm meeting. She went over the rules of the dorm, etc., etc. One of the rules was no drinking for people under 21, which was everyone. As our housefellow said this rule, she burst into tears. Awkwardly, we sat in silence for several minutes, as she cried.   My roomate and I never got in trouble for drinking. We were stone cold sober during all of our pranks. Some of the more memorable pranks included throwing wet toilet paper at people, running around the dorm covered in mud, and 'pennying' people into their rooms. Our housefellow was kept busy writing us up for everything. At one point, we had to meet with the head housefellow. If we were written up one more time, we would be kicked out of the dorm.. homeless.  I had to find an anonymous way to retaliate, so I devised a scheme. One day, as my roomate quietly studied, I removed a shoebox from under my bed, pulled down my pants, and took a giant dump. I ate a lot of Lucky Charms back then, so the poop was red, green, and very stinky. My plan was to take the dump to the post office the next day and mail it to the housefellow. As we were in Wisconsin, a blizzard foiled my plans. My roomate wouldn't let me keep the dump in our room, so I put it in the dorm study area, under a couch. I got distracted and didn't promptly mail the dump after the blizzard. Sometimes, when I walked down the hall, I heard people commenting on how stinky the study room had become. A few weeks later, my dump was discoved, and someone threw it away, I guess. I never did mail my poop.  Those were the good ole days. Today, if I tried to mail a dump, the FBI would track me down and arrest me for terrorism. I'd be held indefinitely without formal charges or a trial. You'd never hear from me again. - posted by Roz @ 6:24 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Thursday, January 15, 2004   Supermodel Grad Student's Web Site  The rotator's supermodel wife has been around the lab a few times, so she knows that he's leaving her swimsuit calendar on an empty desk in the lab.

How did he stake his claim for the desk?  I came in this morning, and the guys in my lab were crowded around a swimsuit calendar that had been left on the said desk. At first, we were trying to figure out who the calender belonged to. When we got to August, everyone recognized the model, and we figured out the owner of the calendar. The swimsuit model was the rotator's wife.  (I don't know about you, but if I casually left semi-neked pics of my wife around lab, she'd be fucking pissed at me.)  I don't think his wife minds. She's a graduate student in our department/supermodel/mother of a toddler. It's a lot to juggle.   Our department first found out about the supermodel grad student last fall. A senior student was throwing a party, so he obtained email addresses for the new grad students from the department. Listed next to the supermodel grad student's name was a website. The said grad student went to the website and found many semi-neked photos of the said supermodel grad student, plus info on how to hire her as a model. The title of the website was S. (ethnicity) Goddess, so now that's what everyone calls her. - posted by Roz @ 9:56 AM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Wednesday, January 14, 2004   I predict that Bush will announce a major terrorist threat just before November elections.

He's pretty stereotypical: excessively good personal hygeine, flaming hand gestures, chatty in a faggy way. Except that either he doesn't know he's gay, or he doesn't want others to know it.   His mannerisms wouldn't ring my gaydar bell so much if it wasn't coupled with the fact that he has to somehow steer every conversation to talking about his girlfriend. I think he's trying to say, 'see, I have a girlfriend, I'm not gay.' But it has exactly the opposite effect. This leads me to believe that he knows he's gay, but is trying to make the lab think the opposite.  Yesterday he was talking to someone about the weather, but, of course, he had to steer this conversation to his girlfriend. 'The weather's been so cold and rainy lately that it's been hard for me to get out of bed with my girlfriend in the morning.' (Faggy hand gesture.) 'My girlfriend...'  Also, he walks around the lab while talking to his girlfriend on his cell phone. He has to tell her that he loves her, like, 7 times each conversation.  You may wonder, 'does he really have a girlfriend?' Yes, I've seen her. It's possible that they're a lavender couple.  Today the guys in our lab were talking about movies. Gay guy, "I thought Brad Pitt was fabulous in that movie!"  Other guy, "Dude, Brad Pitt sucks."  Gay guy (hurt), "Well, now we now how you really feel."  I hope he finds the right man. - posted by Roz @ 10:58 AM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Tuesday, January 13, 2004   Pathetic Geek Stories will no longer be associated with The Onion.  In memory of PGS, I have a story that I never got around to submitting.   This happened when I was in either fourth or fifth grade: I had braces, and I wore headgear to school. (My mom would occassionally stop by school to make unannonced headgear checks. If I wasn't wearing my headgear, I was in big trouble.)  I had other appearance problems too: I had a mullet. It was kind of a crazy mullet; certain areas of my hair were prone to stick out uncontrollably, giving me 'wings'. I was proud of my mullet. Sometimes at night I would trim the sides and top of my head with dull scissors. I was enhancing my mullet, ensuring the sides and top would never grow and the back would always stay long. My desire for a mullet was innate.  I was a weird, hyper little kid. There are home movies to prove it. I tried really hard in school. In music class, I always sang my heart out, and I belted out all of the songs at the top of my lungs.  During music class one day, my teacher held try-outs for the school play. The audition consisted of groups of three students singing a song for the teacher in front of the rest of the class. My group was the last to audition. I was so excited and determined to sing my best. Halfway through my audition song, my teacher stopped playing the piano. "R," she said, "you're not singing, you're talking."  Embarrassed and humbled, I didn't sing the rest of the audition. We concluded music class that day with the whole class singing a song. Instead of belting out the song, I lip-synced. Again, my teacher stopped the class in the middle of the song. This time it was to give me a complement, "R., your singing is much better!"  I got the message: I shouldn't sing. I never sang again.     - posted by Roz @ 2:27 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Monday, January 12, 2004   Dude, I just won the lottery. For the next three months, I will have a really competent grad student doing my work for me.  First year grad students have to do rotations in different labs, working with a senior grad student. The rotation students are a mixed bag at Tejas, but I totally hit the rotation jackpot. This woman is badass.  Today was her first day, and I had her do some shit-work that I'd been putting off. She did it competently and correctly with little instruction from me. What more could I ask!  On top of this, my advisor wants me to cut my losses and leave in a little over a year. Basically, I'll be getting a Ph.D. by default. He's sick of nanotechnology and wants to cut ties with my crazy former advisor. The best way to do this is to let me out of here ASAP!  If I was working on a project that was useful to the lab, he'd want me to stay as long as possible. But since my project sucks and I'm wasting lab space and valuable grant money, I'm of no use to the lab. I'm getting fired, but getting fired from grad school turns out to be a good thing for me.  For those of you who had a bad day, I'm sorry. I don't want to rub salt into your wounds.

(I know that you can get arrested for public urination. Can you get arrested for pooping in public? I'm sure many people have seen me poop.)  This is a pooping/love story:  My most notorious public defecation occured while I was on a date. ECO and I had been dating about 2 months when we went jogging together. We were casually jogging through a neighborhood north of campus when it hit me: I had to take a giant, diarrheay dump. Not 5 seconds later, I was running frantically, like a chicken with its head cut off, looking for a place to shit. Liquidy shit oozed from my butt and began running down my leg. I ran to the most private place I could find, which wasn't that private: I took a dump in someone's driveway. Cars were driving by. I moved a trash can in front of my neked, shitting butt to block its view from the cars. When I was finished- I yanked off my poop-saturated panties, and put them in the trash can. I was covered everywhere with shit. It was on my legs, my arms, my back. I was embarrased; I was on a date with someone who I'd just started dating and who I really fancied.  Fortunately, she thought my pooping episode was just about the funniest thing she'd ever seen. She drove me to my house- with the windows rolled down, of course- so that I could take a shower.

A guy in my lab told me a great way to get rid of telemarkers in the evening- tell them that they are cutting into your valuable drinking time. I tried it and it worked. The telemarketer replied in a cheery voice, "I wish I was there with you.' and hung up.  The next morning I got another telemarketing phone call. The drinking excuse just didn't seem appropriate, so I said, "I can't talk right now. I'm really hung over." The telemarker replied, "Sorry to hear that." and let me off the phone.

During our brief conversation, I kept backing up and he kept moving forward. (He's kind of stinky.) And I stared at his ears! It was gross and all, but the thing that was most disturbing was that I'd never before noticed his ears. Maybe, with the busy holiday season upon us, my advisor hasn't been adhering to his ear waxing routine. Did the ear hair sprout up overnight, or did it take me 3.5 years to realize that my boss has a lot of ear hair?  I can't necessarily say that I want a close personal relationship with my advisors, but I wish that I had more interaction with them. When I'm a postdoc, I want to have more interaction with my advisor.

      Ganglia Monday, December 29, 2003   I wonder if my lab will have group meeting today.  Group meeting is a weekly event where everyone in the lab gets together with our bosses. Each group member is supposed to talk about their research for 5 minutes. Usually, though, most people talk for longer than their allotted 5 minutes. Consequently, group meetings are a big fucking ordeal. Usually, we're trapped in a room for 2 hours, listening to the most intimate details of someone's failed PCR reaction.  Very often, our bosses show up in lab on Monday, and they cancel group meeting. They just don't feel like having it, and you can see why.  However, if it's a holiday we will have group meeting. Memorial Day, Labor Day, Fourth of July- group meeting is in full swing. I think the bosses are trying to prove some sort of point, but I don't know what it is.  So I wonder if we have group meeting today, December 29. Most people are away for Christmas break, so that leans in favor of group meeting. But today is not a holiday. If it was, say, New Year's Day, then we'd definitely have group meeting.  - posted by Roz @ 9:50 AM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Sunday, December 28, 2003   ECO, my wife, hung a bunch of pictures in our house.

When I was 7, I lived in New England with my family and my beloved dog. After a year, we moved back to the midwest.  During the year on the east coast, I met a woman in her early 30s who owned a dog like mine. She lived in my apartment complex, and she befriended me. ( or I befriended her. I was only 7, so I don't remember how it happened.) We used to walk our dogs together in the evening, and she told me ghost stories.  After my family and I moved back to the midwest, I kept in touch with this woman, and she sent me Christmas presents. Time passed. I grew up. She got married and adopted a baby. Over the years, her presents got more elaborate and included not only Christmas presents, but Halloween presents, Valentine's Day presents, Fourth of July presents. Every possible holiday type of present. Usually her packages consisted of a sweatshirt or pair of socks with a holiday theme and some nasty, stale candy. I dutifully send her thank you notes, as instructed by my mom. Occassionally, my mom talked to her on the phone or sent her a card.  When I graduated from college 5 years ago, this woman (now in her late 40s) attended my graduation ceremony with her husband and adopted toddler. I didn't spend much time with them when they visited for my graduation because I was busy with other things.  The summer after I graduated from college, they requested that I visit them in New England. My mom thought it was a great idea, and this woman paid for me to fly out there for a weekend.  The visit turned out to be not such a good idea, and finally, it occurred to me that this woman was crazy. As I mentioned before, she adopted a toddler from Eastern Europe. I thought the kid seemed pretty smart and normal, aside from the fact that he was a spoiled brat. Whenever he misbehaved, this woman explained to me that he was misbehaving because he was adopted, instead of disciplining him. Then she would buy him a toy or candy to quiet him down. She did everything she could to avoid interacting with her adopted (she liked to mention that he was adopted) son; it was completely crazy- the worst parenting ever.  The real kicker of the whole trip came one afternoon while she was giving me a tour of the outside of their house. At one point, she pointed to the neighbor's house, and said, "Lesbians live over there, so we don't let our son play on this side of the yard. You know what kind of things they might try to do to him."  Seeing as I'm a lesbian, I was horrified. I could have replied, "I'm a lesbian." But I don't think moments like that are a good time to come out. I was trapped at their rural New England house for a weekend. I thought they were crazy and that it was best to not say anything. Besides, this woman didn't let me get a word in. She talked and talked, and I listened. I don't think she asked a single question about me.  Soon after the visit I moved to Tejas, and I met ECO. I told ECO about my situation. ECO thought it was a completely crazy situation and that I should never talk to this crazy woman again. Her thinking was that this woman would soon get the point that I didn't want to be friends with her anymore. ECO's strategy hasn't worked so far.  I stopped writing thank you notes for the holiday packages of decorative socks and stale candy. The packages kept coming, but decreased in frequency, from about 1 package every month or two to about 1 package every 6 months. It's been about 3 years since I stopped writing to her. Last spring, she sent me a package for my birthday, and I dutifully threw it in the garbage. Around the time of my birthday, I went home early from work one day because I felt sick and wanted to take a nap. During my nap, the phone rang, and it was the crazy woman. She told me that she's sent a package and then she proceeded to talk for a while and tell me everything she was doing. She didn't ask me anything about myself, and I didn't say anything, except 'hello' and 'bye'. I just thought, "This is completely crazy."  This Christmas marks the 3 year anniversary of not writing to her. I thought that she'd given up and wasn't going to send packages to me anymore, but I was wrong.  The day before Christmas I got a present from her in the mail. Then I went inside and found that she'd left a message for me on my answering machine. The message was kind of long and rambling with the gist of the message being that she really, really wanted me to contact her.  This whole experience has convinced me (and should convince you) that this woman is completely nuts, even more crazy than I could have dreamed. ECO thinks that I should write to her and tell her that I'm a lesbian. That takes too much effort. Besides, what if she goes crazy and accuses me of doing 'those kind of things' to her son? What if she's even more relentless about trying to contact me? What if she starts sending me Jesus literature? (I guess the Jesus literature would be kind of funny.) Over the last 5 years, this woman has surprised me with her relentless craziness.  I guess this story is to be continued...... - posted by Roz @ 4:05 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Friday, December 12, 2003   My parents are coming to visit next week. They're getting used to my lesbianinity. I think they knew even before I told them.  When I first moved to Tejas, I lived in a nudey co-op. My mom helped me move, drove here with me and all my stuff, and then stayed in my nudey co-op room with me for a full week. (Boy was that a hellish experience!)   Once during the week, this guy, nicknamed 'Scary Dan' tried to talk to me while my mom was with me. I blew him off. My mom took me aside and was upset with me. She said, "R., when a boy tries to talk to you, you should smile a lot, and you should try to talk to him. You could say something like, Oh, I don't know 'hi, my name is R.'"   Mind you, my mom wanted me to flirt with Scary Dan, a 40-something college student who had earned his nickname for a reason.   A week later, after my mom left, I hung out with Scary Dan and another guy in the nudey co-op one night. The three of us went on a beer run and also stopped at Taco Cabana. While waiting in the drive-through, Scary Dan told us about his nudey co-op enemies and about wanting to kill various nudey co-opers. The other guy and I were scared. At this point, Scary Dan had lived in the nudey co-op all of three days; he was soon evicted. And this was a guy that my mom wanted me to flirt with....... - posted by Roz @ 11:31 AM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Thursday, December 11, 2003   More on the woman who's still collecting a paycheck after 3.5 years (at least) of not showing up at lab  First of all, I must say that I'm totally rooting for this woman. Obviously, for all practical purposes, she's quit grad school. She may even have a real world job. I just want to see how long she'll keep getting her grad school paycheck. That's one reason I check the mailbox of my former lab- to make sure her paystub is there each month.  Here's a very nerdy joke that I heard about this woman-  She's a 'theoretical' chemist.  Now I will talk about possible reasons why this woman quit grad school.   The lab was a lot different before I joined. It contained 3 female grad students and 1 male grad students. This is what I heard: One of the female grad students dated the male grad student. It was all good until the theoretical chemist chick broke up their relationship and started dating the guy. Eventually, they too broke up.  Then the third woman in the lab started seeing a guy who was a chem eng grad student. ( I don't know if they were actually boning. More on that later.) Again, the theoretical chemist chick broke up this relationship and started boning the guy. They are now married and moved to North Carolina together.  After breaking up two relationships, the other two girls in the lab hated the theoretical chemist. It seems my former advisor may have taken sides too.  The second reason she may have quit was this: Another grad student joined the lab and 'stole' her project. But you can hardly blame anyone for her project being 'stolen'. She hadn't gotten around to working on the project for four years when the new grad student joined the lab.   So why am I not sure if they were really boning?  Well, the original girlfriend of this guy had a big butt, to put it bluntly. So maybe they weren't really dating; they were just good friends. It is known that the woman with the big butt had a huge crush on the chem eng grad student guy. The theoretical chemist had a much smaller, firmer ass.  In fact, the woman with the big butt and my former advisor would often discuss their butt sizes in lab. Sometimes, when my advisor was feeling insecure, she came into lab, and said in a whiney voice to the girl with the big butt, "C., do you think my butt is too big?"   To which C. replied, "Oh no, A. You're butt isn't too big! My butt is too big."   To which A. replied, "Really. Do you really think my butt isn't too big? And, by the way, your butt is NOT too big."  I listened to the conversation, and thought, "I hope they don't ask me if I think their butts are too big."  My former advisor was on the cover of a popular money magazine once. I was in her office one time, and she started admiring her picture on the cover. She said, "This picture makes me look like I have chipmunk cheeks." I guess I was supposed to say, "Oh no. You don't have chipmunk cheeks." Instead, I said nothing.  Maybe that's why she hates me. - posted by Roz @ 11:58 AM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Wednesday, December 10, 2003   A while back, I blogged about unusual people in science. Well, I forgot one. This person isn't necessarily an unusual scientist. In fact, I wouldn't call her a scientist. This is more a story of a unique way of making a living without working.  When I first joined my first grad school lab, I noticed that there were two people on the list of lab members who I'd never seen. Since I thought my new advisor was crazy, I theorized, after a few months in the lab, that my advisor had make-believe grad students. Eventually one of the MIA grad students officially quit grad school. The other one remained a lab member. In fact, she's still considered a member of the lab.  She gave a few group meetings while I was in the lab. All of her group meetings were the same. She talked about her proposed project. Her 'data' consisted of her unsupervised undergrad's work and a few computer searches that had taken all of 5 minutes to complete (although she let on that the computer searches had taken several months.) Then she wouldn't show up until her next group meeting. Once, she was 'inspired' for a few months. During this time, she came to lab a few mornings a week.   My former lab has now moved to Boston. Not this woman. She got married and moved to North Carolina with her husband. But she's still considered a grad student at UT AND she's still collecting a paycheck from my former advisor. Sometimes, I check the mailbox of my former lab in the chemistry building. Her pay stub is in there every month!  Anyone who's been to grad school knows at least one person who didn't show up to lab for a few months or who slacked off excessively at lab. Well, my story tops yours.   Let me reiterate: This woman has been collecting grad school paychecks for 6 and a half years. For the 3.5 years that I've been in grad school, she has not done any work at all. In fact, she's rarely showed her face in lab. In other words, she's gotten a paycheck for at least 3.5 years, has showed up very rarely to work during that time, and the boss doesn't seem to notice. - posted by Roz @ 3:11 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Sunday, December 07, 2003   It's hard to come up with something to blog about everyday, but today gave me some great blog fodder. I went to gay church.  I'm not a big religion fan, but ECO and I thought we'd give church a try. We went to this particular church knowing that it was gay-friendly, but didn't know that everyone there would be gay. It was weird to see so many gay people not in a gay bar. (Sometimes when I'm in a place with a lot of gay people, I think of my boss, a Euro. I imagine him at the gay place surrounding by gay people, all the while completely oblivious. During church I thought that if he was there, he would have gone the entire service without noticing anything out of sorts.)Anyway, there were greeters outside the church, who asked if we were new. Service started off like any other church service, except that everyone was gay. There was a little more singing than at your average Catholic Church.   It was all fine and good until communion time. That's when things got funky. Everyone was invited to partake in communion. But when I saw what 'partake in communion' meant, I was like, no way, dude! One by one everyone went to one of the pastors (there were 12 of them). The pastor fed you the communion wafer. Then the pastor hugged you for about a minute while whispering in your ear. It was freaky and cult-like, and I wanted no part of it. Couples received communion together, so they made a 3-way hug with the pastor while doing the creepy whispering thing. I got really nervous and panicked when I saw communion. I was freaked out because there was a chance, a very slim one, that ECO would want to do this weird communion hugging and whispering thing with me. I tried to look on the bright side of receiving communion; at least, I'd know what they were whispering. It would be like seeing Mormon panties or knowing the special Mormon code to get into the Mormon temple. But what if I started giggling uncontrollably during the whispering? ECO would be pissed at me for being disrespectful. Fortunately, when the usher, who was wearing a rainbow vest, invited us to communion, ECO said no thanks. I was too freaked out to respond, and just tried to not smirk (unsuccessfully).   (Incidentely, when I was in college, I was suspended from the tennis team for smirking. Good thing they don't discipline you for smirking in grad school, or I'd be out of here. It was difficult for me to not smirk at my former boss.)  At the end of service, the new people were invited to join in refreshments and learn more about the church (and join the cult?). When the service ended, everyone started hugging excessively. My goal was to get out of there without being hugged. Outside the church the pastors were lined up to hug people.  We made it out of there with minimal physical contact. - posted by Roz @ 3:11 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)

      Ganglia Tuesday, November 18, 2003   This whole bad 80s fashion trend isn't just for Austin 20-something hipsters. High school students are doing it too. Today at the grocery store, there was a high school kid wearing ripped jeans and a jean jacket with stuff written on it in permanent marker, like the anarchy symbol and a crossed-out swastika with the text, 'hate is wrong.' He also had a mohawk, which was dyed green. He was shopping for groceries with his mom.  Then I saw another guy wearing the same outfit. At first, I thought it was the same guy, but on closer inspection I realized it was a different guy. He had an indescribably more early 90s feel to his garb. The first guy, who was probably born in the mid-80s, had very mid-80s fashion sense.  I'm not entirely opposed to jean jackets. In fact, I was proud to own a stone-washed jean jacket during the 80s. I used to write symbols, like the anarchy symbol and crossed-out swastikas on the bottom of my shoes.  I realized today that I was too young to be a bad-ass 80's character the first time around. I was 2-12 years old during the 80s. The second time around for this fashion, I'm 26, too old to get a mohawk. Plus, I think they're kind of hideous looking.  If my teenager dresses all 80s, I'll be embarassed to be seen in public with them.  - posted by Roz @ 8:16 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Monday, November 17, 2003   Last night I went to see a concert, the Yeah, Yeah, Yeahs.  I don't understand the youth of today. First off, everyone at the concert was dressed like it was a 1980s costume party. But it wasn't a costume party; they really dress like this in real life.  I lived through the 80s, and I thought that decade was horrifying. I couldn't wait for it to end. The kids at school tried to put hairspray in my hair and get me to tuck my pants into my socks. My mom made me wear hideous, sufficating turtlenecks and funky-colored corderoy pants. I remember wearing fugly ski jackets and tacky earrings. My mom made me dress '80s so that I'd fit in at school. During the 80's, I hated the DARE program. (I always said stuff like, "I want to do crack when I grow up." to 'Officer DARE'.) Anyway, during the 80s, I always thought: "when I grow up, I'm never wearing turtlenecks or fugly ski jackets. Once the 80s are over, I'll never be traumitized by bad fashion again."  Last night the 80s came back to haunt me, the concertgoers were so vintage 80s.   Another thing I noticed about the youthful concertgoers is that they stink. (I must admit last night that I contributed to the stink with some rancid farts, but at least, I don't smell rancid in general. The farts were my way of retaliating against the general body odor problem.)  The highlight of the night was when I was followed through the crowd and across the club by a particularly stinky man. As he followed me, he coughed, sneezed, and weezed, like he had the plague or something. At one point, he grabbed my waist. Finally, I escaped, and later I felt something on my cheek, so I asked ECO what was on my cheek. It turns out it was a huge booger from the diseased, stinky stalker. - posted by Roz @ 6:14 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Sunday, November 16, 2003   I've gone over to the dark side; I've come to the conclusion that SUVs aren't so bad!  - posted by Roz @ 3:45 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Thursday, November 13, 2003   Right now, I'm working on two projects: selling a janky used truck and writing up a paper about my research.

There are two types of people interested. 1) The Mescans. 2) Used car salesmen who want the truck so they can resell it at a higher price.  I was tipped off when I returned a call and the answering service informed me that I'd called carbuyers.com or something like that. Also, with all my newly acquired car commerce experience, I can now spot a car salesman a mile away. They don't flat-out say that they're used car salesman, but they drive a big SUVs and wear suits, not the typical guy who drives an old pick-up.  Anyway, all of the potential buyers are men.... stinky ones. The truck reaks of man-stink, and reminds me why I'm a lesbian: I think that's the main reason- the smell. Anyway, ECO and I are really repulsed by the smell of the truck and drive with the windows down, but still, it's too stinky for comfort. - posted by Roz @ 6:09 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    We're selling our truck. The ad was posted in this morning's newspaper. Judging from the response, you'd think the ad said the following:  Sexy 18yo with big tits seeks an older man for sex only.  Since 4am this morning, my voice mail has been on the verge of exploding. I didn't think we'd have a problem selling our jankety truck, but I didn't expect this much of a response.

Last night, Scarborough Country, a Fox News, show had a program debating immigration. One of the panel members opposed to immigration was Pat Roberson. The panel members for immigration were, I think, an economist and a lawyer. So this is supposed to be an informative debate about the benefits and drawbacks of immigration, and it's debated by educated people on one side and religious whackos on the other side. Anyway, Pat Robertson went on this tirade about how the United States is supposed to be a white, Christian country, a haven for white people in this world of brown people. I learned from Pat that California is now a third world country because white people are a minority there. I didn't know that. Apparently, all of the white people are moving away from California because they don't want to pay welfare benefits for the brown people. That's why California has financial problems. Then he proceeded to insult the pro-immigration panelist by saying that he'd be offended too if white people moved to his country. The panelist was like, "whoa, whoa, whoa, I was born here too, asswipe."  Like I said this was supposed to be an informative debate on a news station. But it ended up as Pat Robertson's racist tirade. I guess the anti-immigration side doesn't have a point; they just don't like brown people.  It's similar to how the anti-gay marriage religious whackos have no point. They just say, "It will destroy the sanctity of marriage." They don't explain themselves; they have no point. But most Americans agree with the religious whack jobs. I guess when Jesus is on your side, you don't need a point. - posted by Roz @ 4:23 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Tuesday, November 11, 2003   Did I really just buy an SUV? I feel like I'm in high school, and I snuck out of the house with the keys to my parents new car. I'm in denial.  People treat you a lot differently when you're driving an SUV. For example, nobody cuts you off, and people let you switch lanes, instead of speeding up when you put on your blinker. The road is less hostile to the SUV. When I drove the Civic, I felt that the SUVs were purposely trying to run me off the road. Well, nobody's trying to run me off the road now.  When I wear nice clothes, people are considerably nicer to me than when I dress normally. It's the same thing with my SUV. I hate people for this. I'm so disgusted.

Does this qualify me as a yuppy? Am I going to want an even bigger SUV in a few years? What's happening to me?! I woke up hung over a few weeks ago, rolled over, and said to ECO, "let's buy an SUV."   According to ECO, this SUV purchase does not make me a yuppy. No, I've been a yuppy all along but never had the money to express the phenotype.  You know how when straight people have an irrational hatred of gay people, it just means that they're a closet case. Has my hatred of SUVs been because I secretly, deep, deep down craved my own SUV?   - posted by Roz @ 2:13 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    I sold my jankety-jank car. Stay tuned.

Am I incompetent?" Maybe if I assigned ECO to buy an SUV, she would be able to competently complete the task.   We went to one dealership together, and split up to look at the SUVs. Three salesman asked ECO if they could help her, but nobody wanted to help me. In fact, I asked three people for assistance before I found a salesman who (reluctantly) allowed me to test drive a vehicle.  When ECO and I first met three years ago, I developed a cooter problem and needed to see a doctor about it, but I couldn't get a doctor's appointment. I called different doctor's offices for like 2 hours. Either they said that they wouldn't take new patients, or they said that they wouldn't accept my insurance; basically nobody wanted to treat my janky-ass cooter. I told ECO about my problem; she called me 5 minutes later to tell me she'd scheduled a cooter-doctor appointment. We both were in disbelief about the other. I thought it was absolutely amazing that ECO was able to schedule a doctor's appointment for me in less than 5 minutes. ECO, on the other hand, thought I was kind of retarded.  - posted by Roz @ 3:21 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    I'm trying to buy an SUV, but it's actually more difficult than it appears. I'm very frustrated.  I've tried to get price quotes by calling different dealers, but they're reluctant to give them to me over the phone. Then if I go to the dealership, the salesman are really slimy and manipulative. For example, I got a price quote over the phone, but when I went to the dealership, the same guy wanted $1500 more for the car. So I left, and was very pissed off.   I've come to the conclusion that new car salesman are actually way more slimy than used car salesman.  On top of my problems with trying to buy an SUV, nobody wants to buy my janky-ass car.

I arrived at her house at the designated time. Instead of leaving for the airport, I was trapped in her house for a full half hour. I had to watch her prance around in her panties, pack for the trip, and smoke a few bowls. All the while, I listened to her stories. She told me that she just repierced her vacant lip piercing, so I asked if she was planning to put in another ring. "No", she said, "I don't really look good with a lip piercing.

      Ganglia Wednesday, October 29, 2003   The natives were once again unsuccessfully in their attempts to kill me.  Yesterday as I was driving home on I-35, I had two close calls. The first happened near this totally fucked up part of the highway where the lower and upper deck of I-35 converge. (The rumor is that the person who designed this upper/lower deck thing, upon seeing what a fucked up mess he'd created, committed suicide.) Anyway, I was driving along and the traffic in the lane next to me slowed. I slowed down too because someone could pull out in front of me. Which is what happened. I was nearly side-swiped and I had to swerve into the shoulder. It scared the fuck out of me. So now I'm driving along (and shaking).There's a lot of traffic. I'm going about 65, driving with the flow of traffic. This angered a big truck behind me! Apparently I wasn't going fast enough. The big truck starts tailgating me, flashing his brights, and honking. So I switch lanes. As I get into the other lane, the truck flies past me while laying on his horn.  My goal is to make it out of Texas alive. - posted by Roz @ 10:21 AM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Monday, October 27, 2003   This is an example of a lesbian hand.    - posted by Roz @ 11:54 AM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    ECO's grandma is Jewish, and her mom is Christian, very Christian. The mom is trying to convince the grandma to believe in Geezuz. "You're going to die soon. I need to feel secure that you're in heaven when you die, and the only way to get into heaven is to believe in Geezuz."  "But I don't believe in Geezuz; I'm Jewish. If I believe that you have to believe in Geezuz to get into heaven, then my Jewish parents aren't in heaven."  My mom is also kind of crazy, except not about Geezuz; she's convinced that the terrorists are going to get me. After September 11, she thought that I was Bin Laden's next logical target. She prepared a terrorist survival kit for me. It contained the following items: clean grannie panties, deodorant, make-up, low calorie peaches, a hairbrush, a nail file, $100... You get the point. When I moved in with ECO, she was freaked out by terrorist survival pack. She took the $100 and discarded the rest.  Also, after September 11, I began getting suspicious phone calls at all hours of the night, like at 2 or 3am. The caller wouldn't say anything, but just stayed on the line for a while. One Sunday morning, I got like 3 of these weird phone calls in a row. Finally I picked up the phone and was like, "What the fuck!!!! Stop calling me!!!"  "Oh, hi Rozzy. This is your mom."  "Oh hi Mom." Then I told her about how I kept getting these phone calls. She didn't say anything.  At the end of the conversation, she said (very guiltily), "Rozzy, you know how you've been getting strange phone calls. Well, I think they might have been from me. I'm sorry."  After that, the phone calls stopped. - posted by Roz @ 10:01 AM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    Lately, ECO's been interested in finger size. You see, an article was published in Nature Magazine a few years ago about the correlation between finger size and lesbianinity. If you're a woman and your ring finger is longer than your index finger, you're a lesbian. If your index finger is longer than your ring finger, you're simply a straight woman. ECO and I have lesbian finger measurements, while her mom and sister-in-law have straight women hands.  But am I really a lesbian? My fingers are crooked, especially my middle and ring fingers. If they weren't so crooked, maybe I'd have straight hands.  Supposedly, scientists someday will be able to tell if your baby is gay in the womb. This is deeply troubling to the religious right; they're against both abortion and the gays. Is Geezuz trying to trick them into having abortions? I have a solution. They have the baby, but then they leave it in the woods to be raised by wolves. Gay wolf babies.  I picture myself in the womb with my two big, crooked middle fingers, giving the doctor, who is doing the ultrasound, the finger. Seeing one finger, the doctor says, "it's a boy!" But on closer examanation, seeing both fingers, the doctor concludes, "no, it's just a lesbian rapper baby." - posted by Roz @ 9:37 AM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Sunday, October 26, 2003   Today I visited ECO's family in San Antonio.  I often get wrapped up in my everyday life, obsessing over minor little things like, nanoparticles. Understandably, I feel out of touch with reality. When I see ECO's family, I think, " so this is what life is like for the average American."  Anyway, this is what I want to know: My brother-in-law gets welfare, and was on it even before the twins were born. He has a good job as a mechanic. He makes more than ECO and I combined, and (before the twins) he had one kid who was being raised by the grandparents. So I want to know how his wife pulled up at the welfare office in their new Ford Expedition SUV, was like ,"yo! can I get some welfare here," and the welfare people were like, "absolutely, we understand your SUV payments must be pretty high. And it's your god-given right to drive an SUV... blah blah blah."  And the irony is that ECO's parents are against government handouts, think George Bush is god, but yet adore their son. Yet their son is the reason their taxes are way too high. They resent people on welfare, just not him.    - posted by Roz @ 7:11 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Friday, October 24, 2003   Yesterday I went to a seminar by a famous nanotechnology guy from Harvard or MIT, some fucking snooty Boston area university. The seminar was packed, sitting or standing room only. I was sitting on a stair with a few others. A chemical engineering professor introduced the speaker. Then he went into the audience to sit down, and he chose the stair that I was sitting on. Me and the others on the step cleared a big space for him to sit down. Nonetheless, he still had to bump me with his ass as he sat down, and not apologize. I made my body as compact as possible, so this mutherfucker could spread out as much as possible. He spread his legs out to facilitate the passing of his crusty, old dude farts. Then he had to continually elbow me, knee me, etc. during the 60 minute talk. When he got up, he hit me with his butt again. When he left, he cleared a huge space on the step, where 3 of him should have been able to fit. Who does this guy thing he is? What's up with crusty, old white men? They sincerely believe that they're entitled to everything, including my space. Whenever I'm walking on a sidewalk and I pass a group of white frat dudes, they never, ever yield any space on the sidewalk. Women always move out of your way. It reminds me of the cartoon in Hothead Paison, the lesbian bible. Hothead is sitting at the end of a bench waiting for a bus. Some dude comes along, spreads out over the entire bench, and rubs his crusty hairy legs against her. So she kills him. - posted by Roz @ 1:38 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Wednesday, October 22, 2003   My family is small, quiet, dull. I'm an only child. My parents lead uneventful lives. ECO's family is, in contrast, crazy. Her brother, my brother-in-law, is under investigation by the FBI for fraud. It seems that he devised a clever scheme for not paying his electricity bill. His wife and kids moved from apartment to apartment four times before getting caught. At each new apartment, he registered the electricity in one of his toddler's names with the toddler's social security number. It was a fool proof plan until he got caught. Now the kids, (the oldest is 3), have started out in this world with bad credit. My brother-in-law owes $2700 in back electricity bills. It seems like his only option now is to move in with ECO's parents. (Who's gonna give him electricity?) Her parents love cleaning up his messes, and they deserve him as their son. ECO, in contrast to their darling son, in an abomination. That's what Geezuz and Rush Limbaugh say! You see, ECO, is a lesbian, and lesbians are responsible for all bad things. In fact, ECO is probably somehow responsible for her brother's mess.   - posted by Roz @ 7:31 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    Boston, MA  I don't like it. Not only does my evil nemesis, AB, live there, but I've had bad experiences both times I've been there.  I first went there when I was about 8 years old. I lived in CT, and my parents and I went there on a day trip. We went to a restaurant in Boston where a waiter dropped a tray of beer on my little bitty 8 year old head, and as I remember, he was kind of a dick about it.  The second time I went there was this summer with ECO on our way to Iceland. We got up early and drove to Boston from Vermont; we were looking forward to spending the day there. The problem was that we got lost, and the locals were no help at all. We went to a drug store and asked the clerk if she could point us in the direction of the ocean, bay, harbor, etc.  "Excuse me, ma'am. Could you point me in the direction of the ocean?" "Ocean?!@!!!! What ocean! There's no ocean around here." "The Atlantic Ocean. Anyway, where is the bay?" "Bay!!?!! What are you talking about?!!" (I was begining to think that I was crazy. I often wonder this, and this interaction was confirming my suspicions... I'm the crazy one.) "What about the harbor?" "I don't do oceans, harbors, whatever!!!!" Her collegue overheard me. "OOOOOhhhhhh! She's talking about the beach." "OOOOOhhhhhhh! The beach." "Yeah. Take the yellow line. Then get off at the blue line." "No. You take the red line. Then the yellow line." "Thanks for your help!"  We left. Seagulls were circling overheard. We were a few blocks from the ocean, bay, whatever. I bought a map.  Then something unusual happened. A man stopped to help us figure out where we were on the map. He was very friendly; people aren't usually that friendly to big bull dykes like ECO and I. As we walked through downtown Boston, construction workers stopped their work to wave at me. Old ladies smiled at me. Very unusual. But ECO and I figured it out! (Actually, just ECO figured it out; I'm not that perceptive.) I was wearing army pants and a black t-shirt. I looked like an army dude, and they were expressing their gratitute to me for protecting their country.  Anyway, it was too hot and too crowded in downtown Boston. We blew that joint and headed to the airport early. More pleasant things were in store for us in Iceland. - posted by Roz @ 6:35 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    Pics of me drinking hard stuff I was worried that my face would be permanently stuck in this position.       - posted by Roz @ 10:28 AM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    Pics of ECO drinking Icelandic liquor We actually had to smuggle this nasty stuff into the US. You're only allowed to bring 1L of hard stuff into the US, and we wanted to bring in more to give to people as presents. So we hid it in our luggage as we went through customs. ECO was freaked out that we would get in trouble. I agreed to tell the customs officials that it was all my doing, if they found the extra liquor. But, really, what could they do to me for having too much booze, send me back to Iceland? Anyway, we went through customs, and this woman asked us questions, like what we were doing in Iceland. And, are we sisters? No, we're not sisters, we just got a civil union in Vermont. She immediately got kind of awkward, didn't ask anymore questions, and just let us through. We didn't get searched. I asked Erin if she thought our customs agent was a lesbian. Erin said, no, she has a foreign accent, probably just a German lady. I was like, no, she had a Boston accent; I think she was a lesbian.  Anyway, we didn't know this stuff was so nasty when we bought it. Now when we give it as a present it's more like we're saying, "thanks for being our friend, you mutherfucker!" Perhaps we should give this to our enemies.       - posted by Roz @ 10:26 AM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    Pics of kitties Below are pictures of my daughter eating a popcicle.

Traffic has noticibly improved and there are fewer rabid SUVs on the road. Old Austin is making a comeback after being eclipsed by the technology boom of the late 1990's. Old Austin was best documented in the early 1980s movie, Slacker. A slacker is someone who "slacks off" their work, doesn't pull their weight. Well, there are people who avoid work everywhere. What makes an Austin slacker unique is their creative, sometimes unusual way of avoiding work.   We met a classic Austin slacker recently; she is the roomate of one of our grad student friends. When we arrived at their house, we could tell that this slacker does not believe in soap. It is bad for the environment.   Recently, our friends decided to wash their bath mat; it hadn't been cleaned in a while. Instead of using soap and a washing machine (bad for the environment), they put the bath mat in the shower. They reasoned that the mat would become clean by having water run over it during their soapless showers. Months have passed and a brown substance still oozes from the mat every shower.   The slacker asked us what we were doing during the coming weekend, and we mentioned that we were going to watch a football game. We learned that football is bad because the football field takes up "earth space."   Finally, the conversation turned to technology. The hippy slacker is convinced that technology is bad (of course) because technology increases the entropy of the earth. She explained scientific theories to the three scientists, and we were politely amused. Later we learned that she owns a car and a computer, in addition to all the modern (and dirty) amenities in her house. Her boyfriend, while he doesn't speak for her, drives a big SUV.   We're convinced that she's not really overly concerned about the environment given her modern lifestyle. Instead, in true slacker fashion, she rationalizes not cleaning and other work avoidance by saying that it is bad for the environment. Quite unusual and creative, in true Austin slacker fashion.  - posted by Roz @ 9:51 AM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    I set my wife's panties on fire... literally.

      Ganglia Thursday, September 25, 2003   My wife gets upset with me because she thinks I hate Austin, and it's not true. I like Austin. Here is my list of things I love about Austin, not in any particular order: 1. Breakfast tacos at Curra's or Taco Xpress. 2. Prickly pears. 3. The weather in the winter. It rarely gets below 50, and so is perfect for doing things outside, like running and biking. 4. The beautiful desert landscape of the Hill Country. Places like Mount Bonnell and Hamilton Pool. 5. Alamo Drafthouse. You get to eat while watching a movie. 6. Pretty good lesbian scene. This is a mute point to me now. However, if you are a lesbian under 23, there are plenty of events and cute girls. Laydeez nights at the local bars seem good for scoring if you're young and single. The best thing about Austin for me is that I met ECO here, and this is where she's from. 7. There are some pretty neat distinct neighborhoods, like East Austin and South Congress. Unfortunately, with any good thing, the yuppies and SUVs want to hijack the SoCo, hence the name SoCo. Enough negativity. 8. The urban and cosmopolitan, yet small, feel of downtown Austin.  Okay, that's all I can think of for now. Here's my list of negatives, although I admit it's getting better all the time.  1. SUVs and traffic congestion. This is getting better with the downturn in the economy. 2. Cluster fucks. Like at Zilker Park, 6th St. on the weekend, UT football. Again, it's getting better, sadly because of the bad economy, and I'm learning how to avoid the cluster fucks. 3. The weather in the summer. It's too hot; it hurts my tummy. I'm a little baby. Boo. Hoo. 4. Bugs, ants, cockroaches. It never freezes so they never die. It's gotten better since I've moved in with ECO. Our kitties eat the bugs. Unfortunately, my desk at work is swarming with ants as I write this. 5. I wish there were more places to ride my bike. I wish I could ride to work without fear of being hit by an SUV. I wish I didn't read in the Chronicle about people being run over by SUVs while crossing the street. Maybe this isn't an Austin-specific problem; I can't help that I'm obsessed with SUVS.  - posted by Roz @ 6:47 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Sunday, September 21, 2003   Lesbians are so damn PC, let me tell you: I was reading an article in Girlfriends magazine the other day about fat, really, really fat lesbians getting stomach stapling surgery to help them lose weight. The "fat-acceptance" lesbians were all in a tither because they felt the wimmin getting the surgery were conforming to the fascist beauty standards of the patriarchy. We're not talking a few extra pounds here; we're talking wimmin who can't walk and haven't seen their cooters in years. In their case, the surgery is a medical necessity, but the fat-acceptance wimmin don't see it this way. - posted by Roz @ 12:40 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    I forgot to post this when we first got back: The Icelandic Phallological Society, dedicated to the study of penises, was located right around the corner from our hotel.

Here's my first story:  Last night, ECO and I went on a beer run the the Chevron down the street. We left the gas station, and I wanted to turn right on Riverside, near the intersection with Congress. The light was red and vehicles stopped. My problem was that a large SUV with a trailer was obstructing me. If the SUV had pulled up a little, I could have pulled my little Civic onto the road behind the SUV. There was a huge space between the bigass SUV and the car in front of it, so I pulled around the SUV into this space. This angered the SUV!!!! Lots of honking and flashing of brights, and I hadn't done anything to harm the SUV or hinder its travel. In fact when the light turned green, the SUV sat there for a while as my Civic zipped away. - posted by Roz @ 10:51 AM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)

Today he asked me if I'd really gotten married. Next he asked me who the lucky guy is; I told him it is a lucky girl. It was awkward, but he tried be cool.  There are two possible explanatons: 1) Since he's a Euro, he might have thought all this time that I'm a German lady. (I've never actually said to him that I'm a big dyke.) 2) He's known all along that I'm a big dyke, but he became thoroughly confused when he learned I was getting married. Many people are confused by this.     Lesbian or german lady? You decide.   When I first joined grad school, I went to a grad student social function where I met my future wife. I talked to an Indian guy at this function, and he asked me if my sister was a grad student in the department. I told him I didn't have a sister. Then he pointed at a sexy woman across the room and demanded to know how I was related to her. I plead my case that I was not related to this woman, but I don't think he believed me. Today I saw the Indian dude in the hall, and he said, "Congratulations (on marrying your sister)!"

Basically, it goes like this: Aliens are highly evolved humans in the future, so the UFOs that visit us now are time-travelling aliens. Humans evolve into aliens because of selective pressures, induced by overpopulation, and smart people are selected in this scenario. (Maybe this explains the alien-like appearance of my friend, CBM. His descendents are going to make it.)  In my dream, this information about aliens was revealed to me during a night of bar-hopping. I woke up because I was washing my hands in a sink when a rat crawled up the drain and bit me. It's too bad I woke up then because I was about to learn the secrets of Jesus (Geeziz, if you're in the promised land) and how he fits in with the whole alien thing.  Although I can't say I believe in UFOs, my dream theory makes more sense to me than the conventional wisdom about aliens: Little men from another planet are out cruising the universe at night, painting the solar system red, and then they decide to stop by earth for a while, to... I don't know... probe some unsuspecting farmer's anus.  - posted by Roz @ 7:51 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    Now that I'm not in lab, I can post this: What's up with Germans!!!

The reason I can't write about her while I'm in lab is that she has another annoying habit. She pauses to read my computer screen as she walks to her desk, and she comments on my computer activities. For example, 'You're STILL working on that. It's taking you long enough.' She says such snide comments in all earnestness, so I'll get a complex. - posted by Roz @ 7:06 PM Comment (0) | Trackback (0)    The Indigo Girls have been played on the lab stereo lately, and a Korean guy is responsible, NOT me.

For example, what if we live up north, she gets drunk, passes out in a snowbank, and then dies of exposure?

      I mentioned before that I'm working on a project involving nanoparticle-vorous bacteria. This guy in another lab brought me a sample of nanoparticles contaminated with some nasty microbes, probably from his throat boogers, and he asked me to indentify the organism.   So I set out to indentify the bacteria, and yesterday I got some new test results. The organism was identified as a very bad bioterrorism agent. Actually, it's probably a harmless analogue of the very bad bacteria. But still, I was freaked out when I got the results saying, you have X bioterrorist agent. I called my boss, and he assured me that most likely, I have a harmless analogue of the bad bacteria.  It's a little freaky that there's like a .000000001% chance that there might be this bad bacteria in my lab. According to my boss, the only way I'd have the bad bacteria was if a terrorist intentionally tried to attack me. Otherwise, it's the innoculous analogue found in the air and water.  This is definitely a story that I should NOT tell my mother, even 20 years from now. After the 9/11 attacks, my mom became convinced that I am the next logical target for the terrorists. In my mom's view, the terrorists' to-attack list goes like this: 1) world trade center, 2) pentagon, 3) me, the daughter of a scary strong woman in Michigan.  This story would only confirm to my mother that the terrorists are indeed out to get me.  My collaborator dude was a little freaked out by the bad bacteria story, so he brought me all of his stinky nanoparticles and a few lab utensils to destroy. Dude, let me tell you, his nanoparticles were stanky! Even though all of the containers were tightly closed, his stuff reeked of a combination of ass, throat boogers, and dirty socks. (Dude, this guys nanoparticles were so stanky that they smelled worse than CP, the crazy postdoc, if you can believe that!) I've decided to buy some pure cultures of different bacteria, instead of trying to deconvolute the combination of microbes that are eating nanoparticles while emitting a unique ass, throat booger, diry sock smell.

       Freudian slips   I have some embarrasing blog-fodder.   Today ECO was trying to get me to hurry up, so we could leave the house. She kept saying, "Can we go now? Are you ready yet?"   Then something horrific happened. I had a Freudian slip, and I said, "yes, mom." I was completely horrified as to what had just come out of my mouth and I prayed that ECO hadn't heard me.  E"What did you say?" Me"Nothing." E"Did you just call me your mom?" Me"No!" E"Oh my god! You just called me mom? What the fuck!" Me"I know. I can't believe that just came out of my mouth! I feel so violated by myself!"  I'm not sure how to feel about this. Needless to say, it was disturbing.  Am I normal? Do other people have creepy Freudian slips like this?  I know that my mom also suffers from weird Freudian slips, but not as weird as mine... When I was a kid, sometimes she call me by her sister's name.

        Creepy people in science    Sometimes I wish that I worked in one of the core instrument facilities on campus. It's a good job: you don't have to work very much or very hard. You get lots of vacation time. You have good benefits. And no matter how incompetent or creepy you might be, you can't get fired.  There's one particular guy who works in the core instrument facility who's incompetent and especially creepy. I mentally refer to him as "Being John Malkovich" because his name is similar to John Malkovich and I often wonder what he does all day and what goes on in his mind while he's doing it. What must it be like to Be John Malkovich, the creepy instrument guy?  I first met Being John Malkovich (BJM) my first year of grad school when I took a class taught by him on using an instrument. The class consisted of 5 people: me, three guys, and an undergrad girl. BJM focused his attention on the undergrad girl. By the way, BJM is a balding, soft-spoken, 45ish white man.  Before class, BJM would whisper to the undergrad girl. "Sarah, what are your interests, outside of science?" Sarah was usually short with BJM, "Nothing, I have no interests." BJM would whisper, "That's nice. My interests are reading, juggling, kungfu, and canoeing. I'm going to be in a juggling contest this weekend. You should come and watch it." "No, I have to work all weekend."  Then the class would begin. Whenever it was time to demo something on the instrument, BJM would ask the undergrad to demo the technique.  After a few days of the class, the undergrad became thoroughly creeped out by BJM. When he asked her to demonstrate on the instrument, she freaked out. "No, I'm not going to demonstrate that! Why don't you ask someone else? Why do you always ask me!"  So I wonder what it's like to be John Malkovich. If I had to write his job description, this would be it: "Go on vacation for several months out of the year. When you actually show up to work, DO NOT fix any instruments. Go get yourself a coffee. Most importantly, try to indiscriminately slime on  ALL  of the woman who work in the building. The most effective way to do this is to quietly walk up behind them and whisper, "I'm going to be in a juggling contest this weekend. Do you want to come and watch me?"

We're afraid that if Bubba finds out that he's installing a gay stove, he won't do it right.  ECO comes into the bedroom periodically to talk to me, but she told Bubba, "I'm just checking on my animals."  I've done a lot of interfacing with the public today, as I also had a dental appointment. ECO and I had to switch our dental appointments, so the dentist now knows that we're the gays. The dental hygenist really, really wanted to let me know that she's cool with the gays, so while she cleaned my teeth, she talked about the gays. She asked me questions about my partner. I responed with different gurling noises. She told me about how the office has other lesbians as patients, like this lesbian couple from Iowa. She told me a story about what it's like to be a lesbian in Iowa. I thought it would have been funny if, once all the cleaning stuff was out of my mouth, I had said, "What are you talking about? I'm not a fucking dyke."  Bubba is finishing up with the stove, and ECO is writing him a check. Since both our names are on the check, Bubba might be able to figure that he installed a gay stove today. But we don't care because  our gay stove has finally been installed!  To celebrate having a functional stove, I'm going to cook my wife a special dinner, pan-seared steak with sauteed spinich.

      Something very bad happened today. My computer was hacked, even though I had an (apparently ineffective) firewall installed. The German lady determined that it was being used as a server. She scanned my computer and found a lot of files with names like, teen xxx and animal sex, so she deduced that my computer was being used as a server for a porn site.   Now my computer is all sorts of fucked up. More fucked up than I've ever seen a computer be. I couldn't open any programs because there's no memory. Plus, my computer did stuff on its own, like it was possessed, until I pulled the cord from the wall.  The only good news here is that I had all of my data backed up on an external harddrive, which was not attached to my computer during the hacking. Still, I'm worried. What if the harddrive malfunctions when I try to access the data? There goes grad school.

      It's hunting season for our son, Max. I'm both disturbed and, at the same time, have a sick fascination with his hunting.  Last night he brought home a headless mouse as a present for the mommies. Usually Max catches birds. He eats the entire bird feathers and all, except for this one nibblet. I'm not sure what it is, it's a red ball, possibly the bird's heart. I think that maybe the heart is a delicacy, so it's an extra special present.  My wifely (or huz-bandly) duty is to clean up the remains of Max's hunting. I'm supposed to clean off the front door mat and not speak a word of it to ECO. Usually, I can't keep my mouth shut because of my sick fascination. Inevitably, I say to ECO, "Did you know that your son decapitated a mouse last night and then left the rest of the body for us, as a snack?"

      Dykes are everywhere..  So there's this undergrad in the lab who tries to talk to me a lot. She didn't register on my consciousness until today at the bbq. She brought a female friend, and they touched each other a lot. They both looked like straight girls, like that movie Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion. You know how straight girls sometimes have this weird touching/ going to the bathroom together thing going on. On the other hand, they were touching each other quite a bit, and this undergrad does seem a little too excited to see me sometimes. It's really hard to tell.  You don't necessarily need to be female to be a dyke.  A few months back, a guy in my lab had his head bashed under mysterious circumstances. I think the head trauma caused him to become a lesbian. His personality has changed since the accident. For example, he gets easily frustrated and upset. Other things have changed to. Since the accident, he's become buddies with CFL (control freak lesbian), and he asks me about ECO all the time, which is weird. Then he organized the lab bbq---potluck style. Yikes! You know that you're a dyke when you organize potlucks. I can't think of everything right now, but suffice it to say, this guy has gone lesbo.  I guess the moral of my story is that you have to like pussy to be a member of the Whore-hey-ho lab. On my side of the lab at least, (the Whore-hey-ho lab is a big, sprawling enterprise) everyone is either a dyke or a straight guy. There should be a sign on the lab, "Those who don't like pussy, dare not enter."

      The German lady came out of the closet today at the Whore-hey-ho lab bbq..  She brought a piece of meat to the bbq, a pork tenderloin, which closely resembled Ron Jeremy's penis, complete with the nads and everything. The German lady held up her very, large, phallic-looking piece of meat for everyone to see, and made an announcement to the Whore-hey-ho lab: "I haven't had a piece of meat like this in a long time." Then she laid the meat on the picnic table and took a knife to it. Collectively, all the guys were like, "Ouch!" One of them stopped her before she could cut the meat, and convinced her not to do it. Then the German lady put her meat on the grill. It looked like a huge dildo. There's a picture of the German lady holding her meat. Maybe I can get it and post it.  My thought bubbles were like, "Did the German lady just come out of the closet?"

My new shoes are shiny and white. More shiny and white than the picture shows.

      Okay, the Christian Coalition has really given me a good laugh this time. On the Family Research Council webpage, there are many articles about why the gays shouldn't get married, because they're obsessed with the gays. One of the reasons that the gays shouldn't get married is because they have more health problems than straight people. Gay men contract AIDS from gay sex, and guess what STD lesbians contract from lezzie sex?..... You guessed it: bacterial vaginosis, a relatively harmless bacterial infection of the cooter that makes your pussy stink. The FRC website, has three articles on why stanky pussy syndrome precludes lesbians from getting married:  urlLink Article 1    urlLink Article 2    urlLink Article 3   Click on the link, and then find "vaginosis" on the page. Lesbians shouldn't get married because their pussies are stinkier than straight women's pussies. It's totally unclear where this information is coming from; I highly doubt that lesbians have a higher rate of stinky pussy syndrome than straight woman, but so what if they do? I say, if two woman with stanky pussies love each other, they should be able to get married! Then they won't get their pussy stank on other people.   http://www.frc.org/get.cfm?i=IF03H01  http://www.frc.org/get.cfm?i=IS01B1  http://www.frc.org/get.cfm?i=PV03D02

       Lesbian movies   They're so bad. It's tragic. I'm going to review the lesbian movies that I've seen recently.  Go Fish. There are some lezzie movies where I'd prefer the actresses keep their clothes on. This is one of those movies. Another is the entire San Francisco Lesbians series.  2 seconds. We rented this because on the box, the women looked cute, so we were hoping they'd take their clothes off. The movie was described as "sexy and highly erotic." It seemed promising. We watched the entire movie (a German lady riding her bike) in the hopes of seeing the sex scene at the end. This movie was called two seconds because the girl on girl action lasts 2 seconds.  Journey to Kagekestan. The women were cute, and the movie was described as "sexy and highly erotic." It seemed promising. Two German ladies journey to Kagekestan together. Random stuff happens to them. At the end of the movie, one German lady says to the other, "I must finish the journey to Kagekestan without you." That's it. No sex whatsoever. It totally sucked. Plus, it didn't make sense. The German ladies drove to Kagekestan through the desert in this really small car. Every night they set up their huge-ass tent, complete with beds, tables, chairs, desks, typewriters. It really bothered me because there's no way all that stuff fit into the German lady's car. The moral of the story is don't rent lesbian movies with German ladies that are described as "sexy and highly erotic."  Out of season. The woman were cute. (except one had a mild case of camel toe, but I could get over the camel toe if she took her clothes off) I'm not sure what the plot was or if this movie even had a plot. Anyway, there WAS a sex scene at the end of the movie. A really good one, from what I could tell. The only problem was that the fucking DVD was scratched right on the sex scene. Some kissing, a flash of boobies, then it just ends. I played it again, this time, a flash of neked women. DVD ends. I tried to get it to work for like an hour, to no avail.   This is the second time this has happened when I've rented a DVD at this particular store- the DVD is scratched RIGHT ON the sex scene. What are the chances of that happening. I'm never renting at that store again.

      I was checking out the  urlLink Family Research Council Website  . They're obsessed with the gays, and don't think the gays should get married. On their website, they state their urlLink case   for why the gays shouldn't get married. One of the reasons is that the birth rate in the US is declining, and the declining birth rate is bad for the economy. Instead of having an average of 7 babies per woman, like in the olden days as Geezuz would want, American woman are only having 2 babies on average. In Europe, the birth rate is even lower than in the US. The FRC doesn't say why the Euros are having so few babies. But I know why: It's because they're all gay. Europe is fruity, and if we Americans become fruity like the Euros, there won't be any babies.

      I'm bad at the games, lesbian or german lady and fag or eurotrash. When I first saw ECO, I thought, "She's hot. She's an exotic beauty. She's a German lady." I tried to sneak up behind her to listen to her talk. I was so psyched when I discovered that she wasn't a German lady.  When I first got to grad school, I didn't know that all Euro men looked gay, so I thought my boss, Whore-hey was a fag. Later I learned that Whore-hey is so not gay; he's eurotrash.

Not very high, I hope.   Ellen and I have many similarities- the most prominent similarity being our large, protruding beaks. In fact, most of the woman that ECO finds attractive have large beaks. At least, I know that I'm ECO's type.   Why would ECO find Ellen so fucking hot? She doesn't have anything that I don't, except money. Whatever, my beak is bigger than Ellen's beak.

      Random bits of info:  My mom just called to inform me that my great grandmother was murdered (fifty years ago) and may have been a prostitute. She didn't mean to shock me, but this info was urgent enough for my mom to call me immediately to let me know about it. My mom calls me a lot during the day to tell me random facts about my relatives.  I think the German lady and her girlfriend are on the outs. (I learned this from overhearing the German lady's phone conversation.) This is certainly good news for CFL (control freak lesbian), not to be confused with CLF (crazy lesbian friend). CFL likes to gratitously touch the German lady (and me, when we used to me friends.)

I woke up convinced that my paper had been rejected and I had the Sisyphiun(?) task of repeating the same experiments over and over and over until the paper was finally accepted to a journal, any journal.   Who was Sisyphus? Back in the olden days, "The gods condemned Sisyphus to ceaselessly rolling a rock to the top of a mountain, whence the stone would fall back of its own weight. They had thought with some reason that there is no more dreadful punishment than futile and hopeless labor." Sounds an awful lot like grad school to me!

      Womyn on womyn rape- for lack of a better topic.  As I've mentioned ECO used to have a crazy lesbian friend, CLF. ECO doesn't hang out with her anymore, but when we were all friends, ECO and I used to go out with CLF to the local gay country bar.   One night, while we were out at the bar, we witnessed a man punch a woman. Later, we left the bar. As we were walking down the street, we came across a beligerently drunk woman and recognized her as the person who'd been assaulted. CLF, ECO and I befriended the woman. From what we gathered, she was attempting to find her truck so that she could drive to the man's house and kick his ass. Since she was really, really wasted, she was having trouble both walking and remembering where she parked her truck. CLF decided to take the drunk woman home.  While I can't say for sure what happened, I have reason to believe that CLF date-raped the woman. According to CLF, she took the drunk woman home. Once home, the drunk woman called her friend. Instead of leaving, CLF waited around for the woman to get off the phone. Then they made out (consensually?). CLF claims that SHE, not the drunk woman, passed out while they were hooking up. The next morning they woke up together, and the drunk woman was like, "Whoa Whoa Whoa! Who the fuck are you?" Keep two things in mind. 1) This woman was really, really drunk, like nasty, sloppy drunk, like peeing and puking on yourself drunk. 2) CLF was stone-cold sober. Regardless of what really happened, CLF took advantage of the drunk woman.  ECO and I see CLF's date-rape victim out at the bar sometime. We make eye contact, and she gives me this look of recognition, like she's seen me before but can't place me.  Crazy lesbians.

      I'm here, but I have nothing to blog about, nothing at all.  I went tubing (toobing if you're a native) with my lab on Sunday. I got assorted splotches of sunburn on crevices of my body where I either didn't properly apply sunscreen and/or the sunscreen washed off. No stories there.   The German lady and CFL (control freak lesbian) went on the tubing trip. CFL tried to micromanage everything until she got sufficiently drunk. Then she chilled out.  A few months ago, the German lady's girlfriend came out to CFL. CFL told me about it, but made me promise to not tell anyone. I'm still trying to figure out what's up with the German lady. Is she out? Does everyone know, but they're pretending like they don't know? On the car ride driving home, CFL decided to call the German lady's girlfriend or "roomate", as the German lady calls her. I don't know why she did this, but it provoked the guy in my lab to start asking the German lady questions about her "roomate".

      Another person that I kind of miss, who I haven't heard from in a while, is CP, crazy Chinese postdoc.  The other day my american boss came into lab, showed me a Chinese name written on a piece of paper, and asked if I recognized the name. I didn't. He asked if this person might have worked for my former boss, A. I didn't know. Finally, he asked if I thought that this name might be one of CP's aliases. I said, "Sure, I guess that's possible." End of conversation.   I didn't ask my boss what that was all about. Probably because he wouldn't tell me. He would probably tell me that it was in my best interests not to know.   A few days prior to this, I asked my boss if he knew what was up with CP these days. He didn't tell me, but he listened intently to my gossip about CP's faculty position offer. Then he didn't say anything, and abruptly changed the topic of conversation.

I know in the past I've said kind of mean things on my blog about the German lady, because, at times, she's gotten on my nerves. But, I genuinely missed the German lady. Some days when she was gone, I would come into lab, and think, "OOWWW. Where's the German lady? When's the German lady coming back?" Her absence has made her grow fonder to me.

      I promised ECO that I'd blog today. Reading blogs is her daily break from her mad scientist thoughts.  My baby, ECO, is truly a mad scientist, the maddest, mad scientist I've ever met. She works with Drosophila melanogaster, fruit flies. My favorite cute thing about ECO is when she spouts off about notch/delta endocytosis. All while a dozen or so fruit flies (with crazy mad scientist mutations) are buzzing about my baby's head.  ECO has enlightened me about many, many things, not the least being science. Specifically, her breed of mad science-Drosophila genetics and developmental biology. It's taken me 4 years, but now I feel that I  finally  understand her project. For the previous 4 years, whenever ECO would spout off about her work, I felt like she was speaking a foreign language. But I hung in there and tried to understand her. Now I'm being rewarded with knowing what my mad scientist wife is saying to me. I feel like I have minimal competency in the language, fatty-fat-facet-ese(ECO's first gene). My baby has a cool project. I wish that I worked on her project, instead of mine- nanoparticles.

      What do I want to be when I grow up? I used to think that I wanted to be a professor, but I'm getting increasingly frustrated with science so I'm not sure if I want to go that route. Besides, I'm not even sure what the job description of a professor entails. You'd think since I've been working in a lab for the last 4 years that I'd have some sort of clue what a professor is supposed to do all day.    I'm convinced that getting tenure is a free pass to pick your ass all day long.  Here's a sample schedule for a professor:  Go on sabbatical for a few months.  Go on vacation for a few months.  Then return to the university.  Whine and complain about how your grad students students want to publish papers.  What's up with that shit?  Have a boat party.  Go on a retreat.    I'm sure professors must do something, but it's totally unclear what it is they do. I suppose they write grants. Afterall, somebody needs to pay to get our janky, circa 1980s equiptment fixed all the time.

      Both my family and ECO's family have made tremendous progress in dealing with the gays. This weekend was visiting my in-laws weekend. My family and ECO's family couldn't be more different. Visiting my family is full of long periods of awkward silence. My in-law's family is characterized by constant noise, 24-hours a day. There are lots of baby noises, as my brother-in-law excels at reproduction.    They have a 4 year old girl and twin 1 year old baby girls. They're very sweet babies, but I don't know about babies. They're so much work, and they need constant undivided attention. Do I really want one?    The family doesn't want the babies to know that the aunts are lesbians, but it's really obvious to the 4 year old. I think she tries to fuck with the family.    The 4 year old asks questions like, "who's aunt v married to?" "who's grandpa married to?" Then she'll say, "who's aunt eco married to?" The mom says "nobody." But the baby will say, "no, aunt eco is married to aunt r." It totally freaks out her parents. Then the baby will say, "I want to marry a girl." This freaks out the family even more. "NO! You must marry a man!" Then baby asks "why?" The family is freaked out that the baby will turn into a lesbian, butI'm convinced that the baby is fucking with everyone

      My lab is having a boating trip this afternoon, but I'm not going because I'm very depressed about my paper and also, I don't know anyone in my lab anymore.    On the boating trip sign-up sheet, I don't recognize about half of the names.  My bosses say that they want me to leave so that someone else can take my bench. I feel like all of the new benchless people stare at me like a pack of vultures. My corpse is still warm, but they can't wait to take my bench.

      My paper was conditionally accepted about 2 months ago. I did the required experiments and answered the reviewer's questions. Now, my american boss doesn't want to resubmit the paper. He doesn't believe some of the data, because it doesn't intuitively make sense to him. Let me stress that writing this paper has taken over a year, and my data has made sense up until now. Nobody else, including the reviewers or whore-hey, have a problem with this data. Just my american boss. Why is he bringing this up now after the paper was accepted, instead of a few years ago when I originally presented the data to him? Is he fucking with me?    I verified the data in question by two different experimental methods, but since the results in question suddenly don't make sense to my american boss, my paper can't be published. I feel like I have to get the result that the american boss wants or else. Fortunately, whore-hey believes my results, and they make sense to him.    Let me tell you, this paper has been a fucking nightmare. I'm convinced that it will never be published, and I'm trying to accept that. The reviewers loved my paper, but my bosses take turns freaking out.

      My mom successfully had my grandma taken to a mental hospital today. Grandma was pissed when the po-po's showed up at her house, arrested her, and took her to the mental hospital. But that doesn't necessarily show that grandma's crazy. Wouldn't you be pissed if my mom showed up at your house to have you committed?   I don't know my grandma very well, but from what I gather, she simply wants to sit at home all day watching tv, drinking beer, and smoking cigarrettes. She doesn't like my parents and is rude to them when they visit her.     Last week my mom wanted my grandma to be put in the Alzheimer's ward of a nursing home. I reminded mom that the doctor had said grandma  doesn't  have Alzheimer's. That didn't matter to my mom. Her solution was that the nursing home would keep grandma permanently sedated, in a drug-induced Alzheimer's-like state.    My mom scares me. When I was growing up, I had this fear that she would have me committed. I finally escaped her control when I turned 18. In the time leading up to me going to college, my mom got extra crazy. She slept in my bed at night and wouldn't let me go out alone. I think she was scared of me leaving her, and wanted to treasure every last moment of control.    My mom is also a control freak. Ironically, she accuses everyone around her of being a control freak. If you don't do exactly what my mom tells you, you are deemed a control freak.    My mom can also be very sweat and nice, but it's times like these that make me afraid of her and scared for the people around her, like my dad and grandma.

       FYI and much to my mom's dismay:   You can't just show up at the police station and say, "I'd like to have my mother-in-law committed." and expect the police to say, "okey dokey, we'll go pick up your mother-in-law and take her to a mental hospital....never to return."

      My mom called and left a message on my cell phone: "Hi R. We're taking grandma to the mental hospital...Never to return. I'll call you later after she's been committed. (more crazy speak about taking grandma to the mental hospital)"    I called my mom back to find out about the sudden rush to take grandma to a mental hospital...never to return. My grandma has been getting progressively crazier, like imagining things and threatening suicide, but it wasn't clear why she needed to be institutionalized right at that moment and never to return. My mom was very excited about the pending institutionalization in a crazy sort of way. First, my parents were going to the police station. Then the police would go with them to grandma's house to take her away. My mom had to get off the phone because my dad was waiting outside in the car.    My mom seemed to be in an especially crazy mood. After I hung up the phone, I thought to tell my mom, "You know, this plan could backfire.  You   and dad  might get committed instead of grandma."

       The most disturbing shit is happening to my ass.     My wife and I went out to dinner at a nice restaurant followed by a drink at the adjoining bar. At dinner, I had the rainbow trout stuffed with crab along with a side of rice and creamed spinach. (Just thinking of dinner makes me want to shit. Excuse me.) Then I drank a mojito, an awesome drink consisting of rum, fruit juice, and fresh mint leaves. I'm not sure if I'll ever drink one again.    I woke up in the middle night to take a shit. Not just any shit, but the most disturbing shit of my life. A constant stream of liquified colonic material exploded from my ass for a good 15 minutes, punctuated by several toilet flushes. I was convinced that I'd eliminated the entire content of my colon and possibly my large intestine too. Not true.    I woke up later in the night for another liquid shit. This one only lasted 10 minutes. There went the contents of my small intestine, I thought.    I woke up in the morning convinced that was just a dream. I've had diaheria before, but nothing anything close to that. My dream of a colonic explosion was confirmed as reality when I ran to the toilet for another explosion.    I'm doing okay now. I think I lost about 10 pounds along with my entire colon last night. I took some pepto bismo, which has changed my shit from liquid to tar-like. I'm chilling out today, not leaving the house and staying close to the toilet.    Thanks for letting me share that story.

      Trauma in Vegas  It's Friday night. ECO and I are watching a bad tv program about casinos, and it's reminding me of my traumatic experience in Vegas.  This all happened in the course of one day in Vegas.  In the morning, ECO and I went to the gym at our hotel to work out. The gym was overpriced and they tried to charge me for everything. I'd pick up a towel, and out of nowhere a gym employee would appear. "That will be $5 for use of the towel." Me "What! I don't want the towel if I have to pay to use it" Vegas employee "Too bad. You'll be charged to your room."  I went into the locker room to change. As I was getting neked, this bitch came up to me. "You can't be in here." Me: "Why not?" Bitch: "Because this is the WOMEN's locker room." Me: "I am a woman."  Later in the day, ECO and I were in the hotel lobby when we were approached by a female casino employee. "Are you two... "friends"? Us: "Yes." Casino employee: "Well, I am too, and I've been one for 35 years." Been what? It wasn't clear. Apparantly, the casino had figured out that we were dykes, and they wanted to sell us a time share. The casino employee directed us to a booth, where another employee told us about all the free prizes we'd won.  We were given coupons for all sorts of free stuff in Vegas, like meals and shows. Just before we were to be kidnapped and forced to attend a presentation on time shares against our will, the casino employee asked us a fateful question:  CE: "You do make more than $50,000 per year?"  Us: "No." CE: "Combined?" Us: "No." CE: "What? You don't make more than 50Gs COMBINED, even before taxes?"  Us: "No."  The casino employee abruptly ripped the coupons from our hands, and rudely directed us out of the booth.  Later that evening, ECO and I went to the casino bar to drink and watch football. We sat down at a table. The waitress never came to our table, only to the tables surrounding our table. I went up to the bar to order drinks. The bartender would not look at me. I went back to the table, and a waitress walked by. I asked if we could order a drink. She rudely asked to see our IDs. We showed ID. Then she walked away before we could order a drink. We chilled out and watched football, but the casino refused to serve us drinks, presumably because we were lesbians with an annual, combined, before tax income of less than $50,000.  I will never go to Vegas again, ever. Even if someday, my wife and I make more than $50Gs combined, we're still not going back to Vegas.

      The Evildoers of Evil are from Massachusetts.  Bush is supposed to be a uniter not a divider, but he consistantly demonizes an entire state of the Union, Massachusetts. He's always saying "John Kerry is a Massachusetts liberal." The audience is supposed to scrunch up their face, squint their eyes, and say, "EEEEEEWWWWWWW.OOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWW. EEEEEEEWWWWWWWWWWWWW" (picture of the face to be posted tomorrow.) The implication being that the people of Massachusetts are evildoers and haters of freedom.  In addition to his boycott of France, Bill O'Reilly will soon be calling for a boycott of Massachusetts.

      I'm pretty bad at pronunciation.  A case in point is the pronunciation of my middle name. Until I was about 12 years old, I thought that my middle name was pronounced: Y-von-e. I believed that other people were pronouncing my name wrong. One day it dawned on my that maybe  I  was pronouncing my middle name incorrectly. The correct pronunciation is E-von.

      My bench smells like ass, more specifically like TBG's (throat booger guy) ass boogers. All day I've cleaned by bench, but still it smelled foul. I finally discovered the source of the offensive odor, a plastic tube holder used by TBG.   It's like everything TBG touches, including glass and plastic, acquires a nasty throat/ass booger smell. TBG wants me to figure out what is contaminating his nanoparticles, but I think that TBG needs to go to the doctor to find out what's contaminating him.

      The correct pronunciation of my boss' name is whore-hey whore-jew. I learned this today, and I'm a fifth year grad student.  I started wondering if I was pronouncing his name wrong because I've heard other people pronouncing it. Recently, people from other labs have come up to me and said, "How are things in Dr. whore-jew's lab?" I thought, "That person pronounces my boss' name all fucked up." But then I noticed more and more people pronouncing his name whore-jew, so I asked around. I even typed his name into the program "simple text", which pronounced it whore-jew.  I feel dumb.

      Something embarrassing dawned on me today. I don't know how to pronounce my advisor's last name. I'm a fifth year graduate student. I know his first name is whore-hey. But the last name, is it whore-hey-ho, whore-he-hey-ho, whore-jew, whore-jew-ho? It's just not clear.   I've been thinking about getting a postdoc position, which has lead me to wonder how to pronounce different professor's names. But then I thought, "Wait a minute. How do I pronounce whore-hey's last name?"  I think I've been saying it wrong (totally butchering it) for the past 4 years. I asked someone in the lab, and he suggested that I should listen to whore-hey's voice mail message. So that's the plan. Tonight after my boss has gone home, I'm going to call his office and listen to the message. Then I'll finally know how to say his name.  In my defense, I don't interact with my boss very much. He's been gone for the last 7 months. Today I calculated that I talk to him for roughly 100 minutes per year. A significant portion of that time is spent by me explaining who I am and that I work with nanoparticles.

      I've mentioned in several posts that I'm colloborating on a project involving nanoparticles, throat boogers, and a dorky guy. I know what you're thinking: this project sounds sketchy. Yes, I know this, but I tell people that this project isn't any more sketchy than my research project.  The dorky guy, TBG, or throat booger guy, is starting to get on my nerves. TBG is very, very long winded. He goes on and on at length about nanoparticles and throat boogers, and frankly, I'm not terribly interested.  TBG is very, very dorky. He's so dorky, in fact, that dorks make fun of him. The guys in my lab, not the hippest crowd, rip on TBG behind his back. He's that dorky. He wears a gigantic backpack, everywhere and at all times. Even my sweet wife rips on TBG's shoes. I hadn't noticed the shoes before, but apparantly they're what the cool kids wore back in high school, except they're not very cool anymore.  I was reading another blog about grad students. One of the ways you can tell a grad student is by their clothing fashion. Grad student fashion sense is trapped in the year they graduated from high school, which for today's grad students is circa 1995. It's so true.

      Scientists are whacked.  A case in point is the bioinformatics professor whose lab is across the hall from ECO's lab. He does all sorts of crazy shit, and he has his own crazy folklore. 1) One time ECO spotted him screaming at a grad student in the hallway. 2) He fired a technician for downloading software for a class on a lab computer. He was fired for sabotaging the lab computers. 3) Since it's a bioimformatics lab, the research is done on computers. The crazy professor monitors all computer activity, so if someone in the lab takes a dump, he knows about it. He makes comments if his grad students take too long in the bathroom. 4) He asked ECO's boss out on a date via email. She didn't respond to the email. 5) The previous 4 examples were pretty run-of-the-mill crazy scientist stuff, not particularly interesting. Here's my favorite thing about this professor. He drives a jankety, beat up 1982 Honda Civic. He parks his janky car in the faculty parking lot behind the building at our virtually crime-free campus. Everyday, he dilegently attaches The Club to the steering wheel of his car. I just want to say to this guy. "Look, dude, nobody, I mean NOBODY, wants to steel your 1982 Honda Civic with vanity license plates that say "RNA". Stop wasting your life attaching The Club to your car. You could leave your car unlocked with the keys in the ignition everyday, and I guarantee nobody would steel your car. Besides, you should WANT someone to steel your car."  Is this what science does to people? It makes you so out of touch with reality.

      I'm really stressed out by work. I know this because I've been sleepwalking, and I only do that when I'm crazy stressed out.   Last night I went outside on the balcony while sleeping. ECO woke up and asked me what I was doing.  me "I'm looking for my samples." ECO "Come back to bed." I came inside and went to the bathroom. ECO "What are you doing now?" me "I need to find my samples."  Apparently I was having a very stressful dream about nanoparticles, but I don't remember any of it.

      Warning: Do not read this post if you are offended by natural beak functions.  Linda sneezes a lot, big, boogery sneezes. They get all over the walls and all over Linda. I've tried to wipe up her boogers with a tissue, but before I can get to the booger, Linda eats it.  Yesterday, I had a big booger in my nose. I picked it, and gave it to Linda. She ate it enthusiastically.  I told this story to ECO. She listened quietly, and then said: "You're disgusting and abusive to kitties."  What do you think? Was it abusive to let Linda eat the booger?

      Lesson for lesbians (or anyone else, but especially lesbians): If you are dating two people at once, DO NOT bring both of them on a date at the same time. No matter how liberal or polyamorous you may be, it's  always  a bad idea.  In college, I was kind of dating two women at the same time, and I brought them out together one night. Now they are married to each other.   Last night, we went out with ECO's coworker. She's dating two women at the same time, and last night she brought both of them out. I knew this wouldn't turn out well, and it didn't. One of the women was clearly pissed off about the Elimidate format of the evening. I don't think ECO's coworker will be hearing from her anytime soon. The other woman seemed cool with everything. So at least they didn't hook up with each other and leave ECO's friend behind.

       Lesson from grad school   1. Don't believe other people's work. When you're starting a new project, verify that the results you're basing your project on are correct. Otherwise, you could find yourself wasting a lot of time.  It sucks because the idiot who came before you and reported incorrect results will get all of the credit. Then you're stuck sorting out that person's mess. But you don't get any credit for sorting out a mess.

      I like to periodically check on the status of MIA grad students. The MIA grad student from my former lab is still considered a grad student at this university. Her address is in North Carolina. In the past 4 years, she's been to lab less than a dozen times.  Sometimes, like right now, I thoroughly hate grad school. I can relate to the MIA grad students. I wonder if I could get away with not showing up for several years.

      There are many genres of grad students. There are two particular genres of grad student that seem to be evenly distributed between labs. Every lab has a stinky/creepy guy in addition to the MIA grad student.  My experience with labs is limited to the three labs I've been a member of, plus ECO's lab. Each of these four labs has a stinky/creepy guy and a MIA grad student.   Unfortunately, in each of my three labs, I've had to work with the stinky/creepy guy. In my undergrad lab, I sat next to a stinky/creepy postdoc. Not only did I have to smell him, I had to listen to his crazy tirades. He wanted to kill everyone in the lab, and he told me about it. Plus he didn't like the gays, black people, or mexicans. Then I moved to Tejas, and I had to do a rotation with the creepy guy in the Whore-hey-he-ho lab. He didn't change his clothes or take a bath during the entire 3 month rotation. He liked to talk to me about George Bush. I'm not sure what my rotation project was, but I did learn that this dude wanted to fellate George W. Bush. Then I moved into my next lab with the crazy bitch advisor. I met CP there.  MIA grad students are much less offensive. They simply don't show up to lab. Currently in the Whore-hey-he-ho lab, we have a MIA grad student who hasn't shown up in a year. He's getting paid and is considered a member of the lab.  My bosses are also MIA. Whore-hey hasn't shown up to lab for 7 months, and I just learned that my other boss is on family vacation for 3 weeks. I made a funny joke in lab today. Someone asked where the bosses were. I said, "They're hanging out with (the MIA grad student)."

      I can totally understand why grad students get wasted all the time. Your experiment isn't going to work anyway, so what's the point of doing it? Why not get wasted?   In preparing my paper, I went through my old notebooks. I did so many totally useless experiments. My time would have been better spent getting wasted. Grad school is futile.

      I'm sad. Drinking is so gross, and I will forever associated grad school with getting wasted.  I think that 90% of all grad students are alcoholics, at least the grad students in my building. It's really hard to not drink when everyone is doing it.  My fellow grad students have a much higher tolerance than I do. If I get drunk, I'm out for a few days. When the other grad students drink, they're completely fine the next day.  A case in point is CFL. A typical weekend for her begins with getting wasted Friday night and partying till eight in the morning. Then she goes directly from partying to work. At work, she's productive and looks great. She works for a few hours, goes home, and does it all over again on Saturday night till eight in the morning, before going back to work on Sunday. I would die if I spent a weekend as CFL.   CFL is a little extreme. Most people in my building don't go directly to work after getting wasted. Still, my collegues are mostly highly functioning alcoholics.  The German lady gets wasted all the time too, but her response to drinking is more like mine. She usually comes to work at 2pm, looking rough and unbathed. After working a few hours, it's time to start drinking again. I can understand this response to drinking. It's the people who get wasted night after night, and yet manage to look fabulous everyday. What is up with those people?

      I mentioned that I went out Friday night and everyone got really drunk. Then they started speaking a different language, drunk-speak. Even though, I was also drunk, I couldn't follow any of the conversations. Mostly, I just smiled and nodded and wondered if I was too drunk or not drunk enough. We partied till eight in the morning, talking incoherently. Nobody knew what anyone was talking about.  I remember one conversation in particular with the girlfriend of a putative gay guy from my lab. She was talking about good people as in "Mark is a good people. So is Mary. She's good people." It made me cringe. The natives tend to start talking like this when they're drunk. "Jennifer's good people."  I honestly hope that nobody ever calls me a good people.

      The German lady is not out of the closet to the lab, even though she brings her girlfriend to lab social functions, even though her "roomate" calls the lab all the time asking for her German lady.   The German lady's girlfriend is out to my lab, but not the German lady. The German lady needs one of those t-shirts that say, "I'm not a lesbian, but my girlfriend is."  I've been wondering if the German lady is out to me. It's like she knows that I know that she knows, but we can't talk about it. The German lady asked CFL if anyone if the Whore-hey-he-ho lab knows about the German lady's lesbioninity. CFL told her that, indeed, I do know. The German lady was surprised and freaked out. She wondered how I could have possibly figured it out. Now she's paranoid that other people might figure it out.

      I don't interact with my fellow labmates at work. I walk around thinking, "Nanoparticles! Nanoparticles!" I'm unapproachable and can't be disturbed. I've been working in the lab for 1.5 years, but still I don't know my labmates very well. Sometimes, they try to talk to me. There's this one guy who periodically tries to talk to me by mentioning something about lesbianinity. He's surprisingly up-to-date about the news of the lesbian community, even more so than me. For example, the other day, he started a conversation by telling me that there's a new lesbian movie in India, which is causing riots. I did not know this. Other times, he'll try to talk to me about women's professional basketball. Strangely, he knows a lot about women's professional basketball, even more than me.  On Friday night, ECO and I went out with a few people from lab, the German lady, another dude in my lab, and CFL, control freak lesbian. I learned all sorts of things about the folks in my lab, like they're all adamant Republicans. Apparantly, they talk about George W. Bush all the time at work. I've never noticed this before. It sort of made me view my lab in a different light. The guy who talks to me about lesbianinity is an adamant George Bush lover. The closeted gay guy is even worse. Suppposedly, he's ultra, ultra-conservative, like Rush Limbaugh conservative. I've never heard him talk about his conservative views in lab. I've only heard him talking about Brad Pitt. He wears a CIA t-shirt to lab, a very tight CIA t-shirt. I thought that the t-shirt was saying "Look I'm gay!" but really he's trying to say, "Look I'm ultraconservative."   After bar time, we went to a guy from my lab's apartment. His apartment made ECO and I question his sexuality. It was a fabulous apartment, beautifully decorated, very clean and neat, AND it smelled wonderful. In short, it was very gay. I think that you can tell a man's sexual preference by the smell of his apartment. A straight man's apartment is supposed to smell like dog or moldy socks. If a guy's apartment smells fabulous, you have to wonder if he's gay.  Plus, this guy usually looks fabulous at work. Grad students are simply not supposed to look fabulous everyday, nor should they have beautifully decorated, good-smelling apartments. In the last presidential election, this guy voted for George W. Bush.  So are you're starting to see a pattern with my lab?

      I am the gay guru of the Whore-jew-ho/other guy lab.  Today the closeted gay guy arrived back to lab from his summer internship in the San Francisco Bay area. He had a fabulous time in San Francisco! We had this hour long heart to heart about life, his internship, getting government security clearance if you're a gay, and gay pride parades.  Our conversation was interrupted once by an undergrad girl. When they saw each other, they both let out a girly squeal. They hugged. Then the gay guy said, "Oh my god! I love your hair. It's longer now!"  Straight guys aren't supposed to notice haircuts or let out girly squeals, right? I would have noticed the undergrad's new haircut if she'd shaved her head, maybe.  To be continued.

      The equipment in my lab is sooo janky. I can't take it anymore. I dred running a gel because it's sooooo difficult. First, you have to wait for someone to finish with the gel rig. Then you have to jerry-rig your gel, so that it runs. Then while your gel is running, everyone is like, "When do you think you'll be done with that? It looks like your gel is almost done. Do you think you'll be done soon? Can I use it next?"   I want to say to them, "Back off! There's no limit to what my well-aimed turds could do to you."

      ECO and I are both grad students in the same department, yet we've had vastly different experiences. In fact, our grad school experiences are polar opposites.  One example is our annual committee meeting. ECO's first committee meeting was very serious. Her committee was interested in her project and gave her good suggestions for future research. Sometimes grad students bring food to their meetings, but ECO did not. Afterwards, her committee commended her for not bringing food to the meeting because food distracts from the science.  My first committee meeting was the exact opposite. On ECO's recommendation, I chose not to bring food. Whore-hey (all whiny): Where's the food? Me: There's no food. Whore-hey: What! You're required to bring food. Why else would we be here?!!! Obnoxious committee member (OCM): I'm hungry too. Why didn't you bring food!!!  Then I gave my talk. It went okay. Whore-hey and OCM didn't pay much attention and mostly gossiped amongst themselves. I got few suggestions about my project.  After the talk: Whore-hey: I'm soooooo hungry. I can't believe she didn't bring food. OCM: I'm hungry too. Whore-hey: You'll need to bring food the next time.  I have my next committee meeting in three weeks. I'm bringing extra-special, expensive pizza, and I asked my committe what they want on their pizza.  OCM: I like sausage, ham, onions, mushrooms, and pineapple.  Whore-hey: I will eat anything.  My committee meeting is all about the food. It's going to be a bunch of stinky, pathetic dudes scarfing down pizza and not paying any attention to my talk.   Whatever! I don't care anymore, as long as I get a Ph.D. I'm giving my committee members pizza in exchange for a degree! I never imagined that getting a Ph.D. boiled down to food.

      This story will probably make you think that I'm gross, really, really gross. I'm not going to argue with you.  This afternoon I was doing a delicate experiment involving nanoparticles when I had this overwhelming desire to poop. I quickly finished what I was doing with the nanoparticles. Then I briskly left lab and began walking down the hallway to the bathroom. I can't explain what happened next: a small turd suddenly and rapidly ejected from my shorts. Then I resumed my walk to the bathroom and finished pooping.  Anyway, the turd is still there, outside my lab. Nobody has stepped in it yet.  I've finally synthesized dUMP in lab.

      I've noticed a pattern: Lesbians tend to look more like their fathers, while staight women bear greater resemblance to their mothers. For example, I've been told that I look identical to my father. Also, many of my lesbian friends bear great resemblence to their fathers, while their sisters resemble their mother.  There must be a way to quantitate this. Scientists can determine the sex of a skull based on physical features. Analogously, they should be able to quantitate the lesbianinity of the skull. Call it The Lesbianinity of Facial Structure Index.  BJM (Being John Malcovich, the slightly creepy instrument tech) has a 15 year old daughter. Her parents are divorced. She lives with her mom in another state, but every year she visits her dad, BJM, for a few weeks during the summer. Something freakish happened to BJM's daughter over the past year: She morphed into her dad. They now look identical. Everything is identical, their build, their facial structure, even their mannerisms and the way they walk.  BJM's daughter makes me giggle, because she's so obviously going to be a dyke when she grows up. I wish I could see 5 years into the future when BJM's daughter is a big dyke. This evidence would further support my theory about lesbians resembling their fathers.

      I have a disturbing confession to make. When I was a kid, maybe 8 years old, I was fascinated with Richard Simmons.  I know! Creepy! Right?  I watched his show, sweated to the Oldies, and I wrote fan letters to Richard and requested the recipes advertised on his show.  My parents were freaked out by my Richard Simmons fascination. (You'd be freaked out too if your kid was obsessed with Richard Simmons, right?) I think they threw away my letters because I never got a reply, nor received any recipes.  I saw Richard Simmons on tv the other day, and it made me think of my crush on him. It's embarrassing, but not embarassing enough to prevent me from blogging about it.

      By the way, only one of my bosses, the american guy, is a 'Publican. Whore-hey strongly opposes Bush. This gives me some comfort, that I'm only dealing with one 'Publican, instead of two.

      I had a minor victory today. I convinced my boss of an idea after several months (or years) of trying to get him to understand something.   If you're a grad student, here's how to convince your advisor of something.  you: "I think blah blah blah." your advisor (half listening): "No. I don't think so."  Hammer away at this point for several months.  Whenever you see him say, "I think blah blah blah."  After a few days (or months or years, depending on how often you see him), your advisor will say, "I have an original idea. What about "blah blah blah"?"  Victory. The key is restate the idea enough times that it becomes a part of your advisor's subconscience. After a while, he will become convinced that HE thought of this and then will be comfortable with the idea.

      I think that both of my bosses are 'Publicans. Whore-hey sent a forward to the lab, prefaced with. "Since I'm a professor, I'm not allowed to share my opinions, but here is an example of disrespectful material on the internet."  T HINGS YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE TO BE A REPUBLICAN TODAY:      >  Saddam was  a good guy when Reagan armed him, a bad guy when Bush's    >daddy    >   made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him and a bad    >   guy when Bush needed a "we can't find Bin Laden" diversion.    >    >   Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is communist, but trade    >   with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international  harmony.    >    >  A woman can't be trusted with decisions about her own  body, but    >  multi-national corporations can make decisions affecting all  mankind    >  without regulation.    >    >  Jesus loves you, and  shares your hatred of homosexuals and Hillary    >  Clinton.    >    >   The best way to improve military morale is to praise the troops in    >   speeches while slashing veterans' benefits and combat pay.    >    >  If  condoms are kept out of schools, adolescents won't have sex.    >    >   Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy. Providing health    >   care to all Americans is socialism.    >    >  HMOs and insurance  companies have the best interests of the public at    >   heart.    >    >  Global warming and tobacco's link to cancer are junk  science, but    >  creationism should be taught in schools.    >    >   A president lying about an extramarital affair is a  impeachable    >offense.    >  A president lying to enlist support for a  war in which thousands die is    >  solid defense policy.    >    >   Government should limit itself to the powers named in the Constitution,    >   which include banning gay marriages and censoring the Internet.    >    >   The public has a right to know about Hillary's cattle trades,  but    >George    >  Bush's cocaine conviction is none of our  business.    >    >  Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime,  unless you're a    >  conservative radio host.

Does it mean that he's a 'Publican? If so, that means he's really, really dumb.

      The new thing is dating websites based on political affiliation. I went to one site  urlLink SingleRepublicans   to check it out while I was killing time at work. In order to view the profiles, you have to log in. So I created a profile with minimal information about me. My name is "Linda". I live in the south, and I have a thin build.  On the Democrat dating sites, you have the option of gay dating. There's no such option on the 'Publican site. All the women are looking for good Christian men, not big, bull dykes.  Anyway, today I got an unexpected email from a Republican suitor.    Hi Linda,     I'm interesting in having a serious long term relationship with you. Please email me.  -Republican Suitor.    Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Based on the minimal information provided on my Republican dating profile, this man has decided that he wants a long term relationship with me. WTF! What was he thinking? "She's a chick. She lives in the south. I'd do her."

      My Ph.D. is dependent on a janky, tempormental, exquisitely complicated, multi-million dollar piece of equipment called a TEM. This fact alone brings me to tears.  I need to complete some experiments on this piece of crap instrument in order to get my paper published. Herein lies a big problem for me. I'm getting used to the fact that my paper may not get published because I can't get the experiments done in a resonable amount of time.  This evening I went to use the TEM with CP. (The crazy postdoc is back!) I've been trained on the instrument, but I'm not competent enough to use it without adult supervision. Since the instrument is solidly booked several months in advance, I can only use it late at night or on the weekends when there's no adult supervision. Hence the need for CP.  This evening I signed up for TEM with CP. I fired up the TEM as I waited for CP.  Then I started the alignments, but soon I realized that the instrument was majorly PMSing on me. I called CP several times. No CP. I called TBG (throat booger guy). TBG was out of town but gave me some techinical support over the phone. But not enough support to overcome the PMSing TEM.  As I waited some more for CP, I read the instrument log book. It was poignently funny and depressing.  The log book confirmed my theory called "TEMing while Asian". (You know how Asians are bad drivers. Well, they also TEM kind of fucked up.) I noticed a pattern in the log book. Whenever a problem with the instrument was noted, inevidibly the previous user was Asian.  TBG's log book entries were excessively detailed. "I arrived at the TEM, and I smelled smoke. I looked around for a source of the smoke but did not find one. Does anyone else smell smoke?"  There's one female TEMist at my university. Her log book entries were funny. This was my favorite. "The instrument is (all fucked up). I attempted to adjust the (special TEM knob.) But the knob broke off of the (multi-million dollar) instrument. Then I went home crying." I can totally relate. I'd go home crying too if my Ph.D. was dependent on a piece of crap.  I finished reading the log-book but CP didn't show up. I couldn't figure out the problem with the instrument, so I went home crying too.

      This diet is conspicuously lacking desserts. Also, the refrigerator is full, but there's nothing to eat. It's all like hippy food, fruits and vegetables and stuff.  I'm hungry.

      I'm on a diet. It's my wife's idea. She felt that our eating was not healthy or structured enough. Now we have a weekly meal plan.  Yesterday we went to the store to buy all of the ingredients for the new diet for 1 week. That was the craziest thing I've ever done in a grocery store! We spent $215 on groceries, twice as much money as I've ever spent in a grocery store. Grocery shopping was cool. It was like a scavenger hunt, and for almost two hours, I didn't think about nanoparticles every 5 seconds. (This is why I hate grad school. If I was normal, I'd think about sex every 5 seconds. Instead, I have obsessive thoughts about nanoparticles.)  Anyway, our cart was bursting with groceries. In fact, people were staring at us because of all of the groceries. Usually, my wife and I get stared at because we're dykes, but these stares were distinctly different. They were more like, "you have an assload of groceries" type stares.  Today is the first day of the diet. The diet is sort of like what you'd eat in a perfect world. It consists of mostly fresh fruits and vegetables, plus some whole grains. It's like the USDA food pyramid diet.  Right now, I'm eating an organic pot pie stuffed with vegetables and organic lentils.  There's a movie called urlLink  supersize me  . It's about this guy who eats only McDonald's for a month. His health goes to pot, and he gains an assload of weight.  I wonder if something equivalent, yet opposite, will happen to me on this organic grains diet. After a month, I'll be really healthy, yet I will no longer have an ass..
