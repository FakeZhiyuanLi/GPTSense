      I really am not likin school. But its almost out so yea!!!! I think we have like 23 days left... i hope so, but track is almost over and when thats over Kim and Tommy r gonna leave. Im really gonna miss them. Next year wont be the same w/o them, i mean i only new them for 2 seasons but i'll miss them sooooo much, and friday might be our last practice. Next yr is gonna suck. I mean I was getting close to Kim and Im gonna miss talkin to her. Kim's a leader and a good person and I know a lot of the girls look up to her. I know she'll come visit us, i cant wait to give the shirt lol. Tommy, he's such a nice guy wht can I say. I know i always made fun of him and called him a freak for being so weird all the time but he knows that i dont mean it... at least i hope he does. He's a really smart guy and suprisingly funny... i was not expecting that but i mean that in a nice way not a mean way. I hope they come and visit often b/c im gonna miss them!

      Ok, today was... well there's only one way to describe it... SWEET!!! lol, but seriously it looked like it was gonna be the worst day of my life but it wasnt. At first i knew my best friend was     ed at me and she had something 2 tell me b/c everyone said she did, then she saw me after 8th period and told me that she didnt wanna b friends ne more. So i had to go tothe entire practice trying to like hold in how i was feeling, then when i got home my sister said that she called and that i should call her back at 7:30. Well at like 7:00 i get a phone call and it was christina and she was like look i know b4 i said that we couldnt be friends but i dont think i could do that, and she was like i wanna be best friends again... and now i feel so much better like nothing happened b/c it was my fault she was mad and i totally understood but when she pulled that lets not b friends ne more card i was sooooo freaked out. Man am i lucky have  such kool chilled friends. Man i feel so much better i dont even care that i was grounded. Life is SWEET!!! lol

      I hate school, w/ all the days off i 4got how much it SUCKS and then i remebered after the six hours i spent doing regents... french followed by math. French tres facile (and i suck @ french) then there was Math, oh sweet jesus that was sooo hard... it took me the full 3 hrs, im such a fuck up! I was ready to cry in the middle b/c i had no energy left, like my brain literally hurt. But now im sitting @ home b/c i cant do ne thing 2night b/c i have another regents tomorrow. I'm pissed off b/c i wanted to go to the mall w/ Dani, Tory, and Dave but I cant b/c my parents wont let me... not that it makes a difference Im gonna go to bed @ like 2 wherever i am and no studying is gonna get done so theoretically i should b able to go to the mall and enjoy myself after a hard days work but thats my parents for me... that's wht i get for being in accelerated classes... a really shitty schedual. U'd think b/c were smart they would give us this nice schedual where we get all the tests over w/ after the 1st week and we have the whole next week off but noooooo they just cant handle that they have to make it really long and spread out...and NO Parties, I miss middle school... Just Kidding!!! Well yeah i think u know how i feel about the shitfaces who make these fucking regents in the 1st place so no need 2 elaborate...Time for me to go and find other ways to keep myself sain b4 ppl go online 2night, oh ino ill straighten my hair if u care... well yea, later!!!

      Okey Dokey, night b4 my regents wht should I be doing? Cramming right... wht am i doing? Procrastinating... yet again. Which brings me to the point of this blog, Procrastination is it really my fault or was i born w/ it? I think that I was born w/ the lazy mental attitude and it's not my fault. Personally i think that doctors should look into coming up w/ a cure for my unfortunate illness that i cannot cure. I cant seem to study, I want to but i feel that i'd rather be sitting here typing than studying even though 2morrow im gonna b pissed that i didnt study. As you can see I am thouroughly bored even more bored than if i would just sit down and study but for some reason i cannot do that. When i become president of the USA have full assurance that i will not only stop the war in Iraq and make sure Bush is kicked out of the US if he is not already assassinated and I will have this investigated. Thank you for you r time please comment...

      Hey, i haven't posted for awhile. Not that i've been busy just that i nvr feel like it lol. Well today i went to the mall w/ Dani and i got my dad his father's day gift and i got x tina her bday gift so im all ready lol. And all ineed now is a bathing suit... but i need it by Thursday so i need 2 go to the mall again soon, maybe i'll like go w/ my mom so i wont have to pay for them lol. I hate this humid weather b/c it's makes my hair all poofy and that really pisses me off b/c its poofy enough w/o the humidity. Im so mad i couldn't go swimming @ Kat's 2day but i couldnt get a ride over and by the time my mom came home it was 2 late 2 go over u know... but i think i'll call her 2morrow and say im sry i couldnt go b/c i told her i'd call her 2day but there was no point b/c i couldnt go ne wayz. I solved my music crisis, well i dont think u even know wht my crisis was... ok well ive had a lot of free time on my hans now that schools out so the past couple of days i've been dl music on my dell(my other computer the apple doesnt have ne free music programs) so ne wayz i put all my music on a program b/c it skips when i listen to it on Limewire so then i was looking @ my library on limewire and i guess the music is shared so ppl were hitting my music which is highly illegal and i dont know how to stop it so i figured that i'd just delete it all b/c i had it on another program ne wayz... so i started deleting it and then i got to about the letter N (my music is alpabetized) and i thought i'd check 2 make sure that it didnt effect the program that i kept the music on...well it did the music that i had deleted wouldnt play!!! So i had to re download all the songs i had downloaded which took me like a couple of hrs 2day... not like i had was doin ne thing b/c i was stranded in my house lol... ugh!!! Well at least i learned my lesson lol, so thats basically how i caused and fixed my music crisis... Not that u probably cared lol i bet most ppl didnt even read to here and if u did u must b really bored lol so ne ways Later!!!

      I am so mad at my parents, ive been mad at them for 2 days and im not gonna stop being mad until they admit they're wrong which not be for awhile b/c they're so FUCKIN stubborn. For the past 2 weekends my mom let me have rides w/ Tory but now all of the sudden my dad came home and im not allowed 2 ne more. I am SOOOO mad b/c i was allowed 2 for 2 weekends and everything went fine and i didnt have to lie to them and nothing bad happened to me, now they're not letting me. Wanna know the reason? Because he's 18, he's fuckin 18 and they think im not old enough to hang out w/ someone that old. I hate their decision b/c its so like judgemental. And its complete shit, and i havent even told 1/3 of the story all i know is im grounded next weekend and FUCK THEM, im gonna go out whether they let me or not. Idk if they dont let me go 2 cali they piss me off and it's probably best b/c if they let me go im not gonna fuckin come back

      Whats up? NM here, last night i went moonlight bowling. It was me Christina D Christina H and then Dani, Tory, and Dave came. Dani had gone 2 a concert so i definatly wasnt expecting them to end up coming and i didnt think they were hanging out w/ Dave so that was another big suprise. He's so funny he showed up playin his harmonica, and when he throws the ball he throws it so freakin hard the all the pins go flying. Overall i had a good time. I really suck at bowling but i was good that one time so i'll hold on to that, i bowled like 120 and ever since then i havent even been close to breakin a 100 which kills me because i HATE LOSING!!! But obviously i had a good night. Then i slept over @ Chrisitna's house and we finishes watching Down With Love, and Ewan McGregor was sooo Hot in that movie, he was just as Hot as he was in Moulin Rouge. Christina wa talkin to Fisher on the phone and now i remember y i dont like him, he is such a prick to me, he pisses me off sooooooo much, it's really weird, i dunno something bout that kid really sets me off and i dont think it's just that fact that he hates me for no reason. Oh well who gives a rats ass about him ne ways. Well next weekend should be eventful, we're gonna go 2 my grandma's church's picnic on one day and somewhere else on Saturday, so i guess friday is the only day i can do something so yea lol that sucks b/c i really dont wanna go to my grandma's thing lol, so that's all for now later.

      Here i am, alone on a friday night. Its partly my own fault. (no im not grounded) see, christina invited me 2 go c Harry Potter w/ her but i didnt wanna c the movie so i didnt go w/ her. Everyone else is gonna go c it too, except Dani. I was kinda leanin on the hope that she would wanna hang out w/ me and we could do something b/c i dont wanna be home alone on a friday night but she wanted 2 hang out w/ Tory so i guess im here by myself now. I really have no life. The only person who called me to hang out this weekend was Christina, thats it. I do understand why Dani wants to hang out w/ Tory b/c he's her bf and they don't see each other as much as i c her so i understand.  O well there's always tomorrow.

      Ok im really bored right now i just got back from my global review session... very eventfull... and now i dont have ne thing to do so i decided to write in this b/c i havent for awhile. Ok so this weekend i have no plans so if i u wanna make plans call me or tell me 2morrow b/c u know how many ppl wanna make plans w/ me. But seriously i dont wanna b a loser so if ur not doin ne thing 2morrow please call lol. So today was a regular day, but one thing that was different was my perfect posture. Im telling you (the reader) it really works, when u sit w/ good posture u get like an ab and back workout, i really felt it today. Im gonna have really nice abs by next school yr im tellin you and all of u will be jelous and wish you had sat w/ good posture and i'll laugh at you hahaha. And im still pissed off bout all the fuckin regents they're (NY state govt ppl) makin me take. Y do i have to have 4 in 1 yr and 2 IN ONE DAY thats six fuckin hours of math and french wht the fuck is wrong w/ them have they no heart!!! Y do they give us 2 regents in one day but break up the english for 2 days? That makes no sense, wht us sohpmores arent important enough to get our tests split up but the jrs are? And mine is 2 tests not one so i have even more of a right to have it on 2 seperate days, this is just so messed up. As you can see this has been truly bothering me. Now back to my weekend, lets see...For friday: Chrisitna is seeing Harry Potter, Nicole is gone, and i don't think Dani wants to hang out w/ me so it looks like im gonna b alone. On Sat. Nicole will still b away, Dani is going to a concert, and I'll c if Christina is free. So i'm gonna have 2 see wht all my other friends are doing on friday but i have a feeling im gonna be @ home which really really sucks b/c i wanna go out but i just really don't wanna c Harry Potter lol i already know whats gonna happen so id rather just wait for it on DVD it's just wayyy to xpensive to see movies that i kinda sorta wanna c u know? Ugh so once again let me re-itterate my desperation for plans on Friday (lol) i just don't wanna be home alone so just call me or say something 2 me @ school... later

      Yesterday was kool. I went over to Nicole's and hung out w/ Nicole and Kat then we went to the marina and went swimming for awhile and I kept my hair dry (score!!!) Then Nicole and Kat tanned while I was more in the shade but I still go an Irish tan...NOT SUNBURN, there's a difference. So well ne wayz we went back to Nicole's and waited for her to get ready and then we walked to Hoyer's and listen to old perverts honk @ us... old fucks. Then Nicole and Kat were hungry and I wanted to rent a movie and I remebered that we had some money left on our account @ captain video but by the time we were there we didnt have enough time to get a movie and get back and watch it so then we just went to the pizza place there and Kat had garlic knots while Nicole had pizza and i wasnt hungry @ all... weird. So then we were gonna leave but Kat wanted something in CVS so like i was hidin by the cotton balls while she went to get it bc i was tryin not to be seen LOL...(no ones gonna understand tht except me Kat and Nicole hehehe) then we left and went back to Nicole's and we watched Life As a House and my mom was suprisingly 45 minutes late and then I went home and went online and Dani called me so i filled her in on everything going on and then I went online again talked for awhile and went to bed... yes ino not the most exciting of days but I still had fun, it was really nice outside. Today I went to the mall and got two new shirts and like 6 Buddas... I LOVE BUDDAS!!! I hung out w/ Xtina there for awhile and now im back home. So i hope everyone else had a good day...later -Colleen

      Hey, I'm finally updating. Well i've been very busy lately. I went to Cali and I just got back home. Yesterday we took Dani out for a movie, Spiderman 2 it was OK i personally liked it better than the 1st but like most of them didnt, then we went back to Christina's house and suprised Dani w/ a party! Well not really a party we just kinda set her basement up w/ balloons and signs and stuff... But like then Tory came and she definately wasnt expecting that so she was very suprised lol. We had pizza, cake and then watched I Know What You Did Last Summer, and we just hung out. I had a good time. We had a balloon war, and invented a new game, and I ran on the treadmill for awhile. Dani opened her presents, and at the end we popped the ballons. That was really hard lol. I had to like jump really hard to pop them, and then I was tryig to sit on one balloon to pop it and then I was bouncing on it and then Tory popped it while I was in midair so i landed on Christina's rock hard floor and hurt my butt!!! ouch!!! Don't worry, one day soon i'll recover. Well i think that's all for now. I'll update soon b/c ino it will crush you if I don't lol...

      heh heh...this is definatly gonna be long. Ok so yesterday. Me Dani and Nicole had been plannin to drink hypnotic but Tom was home so we were like ok thts not gonna happen lol so were bummed b/c we thought we weren't gonna do ne thing. Then Alex called Nicole and asked her if he would meet her @ CVS he seemed really upset so even though he like pocketed our $$ and he interupted our doritos binge (which we took ne wayz) lol we walked down bein the good samaritians we are. Then like we went to Cisoros and sat inside and talked for awhile and then we decided that we were gonna go to a park and drink the vodka tht Nicole brought and whisky tht i brought. So we went back to Nicole's and while we were goin back Alex was like do you wanna go swimmin, and we were all kinda like umm well like nah, and he was like we can stop by each of ur houses and get ur suits but all of us had straight hair and we didnt feel like it lol so then when we got out he was waiting down the street lol he was like my boy Jay (Jason) is gonna pick us up at washburns so we can go swimming. So, we get in the car and like im thinkin tht like were gonna go to his house or something like tht or like a park u know so next thing i know were headin north on the Palisades past bear mountain and over the bear mountain bridge to westchester LOL, me and Dani were like WTF is goin on lol. And we had been drinkin the vodka and whiskey @ tht point so like lol Nicole had drunk a little too much and at this point she was like is her words "u guys im fucked up" she must have said tht like 4 million times lol. So ne wayz when we get there Nicole is like shitfaced lol so like then we have to hike through the woods LOL and shes like stumblin and like were all like oh god and then we have to go down all these hills and stuff (and all us girls were in flipflops lol) so we finally get to the place were gonna swim, omg it was sooooo pretty. I mean the water was this deep blue color and it was just so pretty, and then i was pissed bc i didnt bring my suit!! lol i thought we were gonna swim in a pool, o well.  So then we hung out and Nicole was bein like freakin retarded lol but we all had a good laugh "don't laugh at me, i dont like it when u laugh at me, colleen when im sober were not gonna be friends" me dani and lex finished up the vodka and whiskey and after i took my last swig of the whiskey i felt a little tipsy lol but i wasnt like sayin dumb things or slurring. Then we get back (me dani and jay, nicole was waaaaaay behind and alex was helpin her) and this cop is like go tell ur friend im gonna tow his car (he had gone back to see where the hell alex and nicole were) so then he was talkin to the cop, he was competly sober but nicole u could just look @ her and see she wasnt. So we got nicole in the car while alex and jay talked to the cop, but omg it scared the shit outta me bc if he had said ne thing to nicole or nicole said ne thing we woulda been in trouble. So we left and it turns out Jay has a really good taste in music, we listened to slipknot, korn, in flames and a bunch of other kool shit. Dark and heavy it was the shit. I personally didnt wanna leave bc i was havin fun and i liked jay he's really kool, but he's 20 so lol he's not gonna go for a 16yr old, but i better not tell tht to nicole. So we went to the texco station and at tht point me and nicole hadda pee soooooo bad lol, i mean really fukin bad b/c i always do when i drink and ive nvr drank tht much. so when nicole went this guy started to open the door and she yelled "ahhhhh im not done" or something like tht LOL the guy was like tell ur friend to shut the door next time lol. It was sooo funny. Then we got this Blue Hawaiian drink and Alex bought it and they didnt id him so yea we know where were gonna get stuff from now on lol. Then Jay hadda get the car back and they ran into there friend who was like gonna follow them and drop jays car off @ his house and then meet us @ lowland park, so they dropped us off there and we ran down went on the merry go round and like drank the bottle in like 2 minutes flat lol, we just kept passin it. Then we wait 4 awhile and they still haddnt called so we decided tht we were gonna go 2 ciseros bc like Dani and nicole werent feelin well... i felt bad. And so i wanted them to eat, so we called them and they were still @ the guys house they were gonna call us when they got closer. Then we ate talked about the day and how it was nothin like we planned and talked about the guys, how alex would b cute if he was taller and like how we all liked jason, but just for the record dani wasnt attracted to him lol... but yea i liked him, he seemed nice and i liked his eyes, and he had good taste in music but he's 20 lol. Then we called them again bc it was gettin later and my dad  and danis mom were gonna get us @ 9 30, and they said tht his friend was gettin in trouble by his mom so we were like were just gonna go back 2 nicole's. So we went back but when we did nicole saw her neighbor and me and dani we in and nicole asked him if he had it and he was like i got u and left so we decided to go out and wait for him so we went outside and waited and took some dumb pictures and yea tht was tht and then my dad came and picked me up. OMG we seriously needa do tht again but next time were gonna do it right and say were gonna sleep over and then just like hang out w/ them later lol. But we came to the conclusion tht we should def hang w/ Alex b4 he leaves and we should def hang w/ jay bc he was really kool. So yea tht was our day sry it was so long but a lotta stuff happened lol...

      Heyyy... yesterday was a lot of fun, i went over 2 nicole's house and we hung for awhile and then Dani came over after passin her learner's permit test and then we watched some standup comedy on her computer soooo FUCKIN funny lol...my pelican laugh came out of hiding, so emabarassing. If you dont know wht tht is its this HUGE laugh i have tht i open my mouth up wide and like laugh really really loud which for some reason reminds me of a pelican...so then we went for a walk... Hoyers and then to CVS to get some visine bc my eyes were sooooo bloodshot from the beach, and then we went back to NIcole's and i called my dad to let him know i was stayin over, yea tht was real fun... then we "debated" online w/ this kid who called Nicole's friend alex a spicanigger so obviously Nicole and Dani were offended and like then he called Dani a spic and yea needless to say the next two hours we were arguin w/ tht racist bastard... im soooooooo glad dani went out w/ Tory NOT him... we just hung out talkin for awhile and then we got really tired hehehe for some "unknown" reason lol, and we went to sleep and woke up @ like whenever it was late and my sis was supposed 2 pick me up 2day and like she called like 20 minutes later sayin the car wouldnt start!!! Ahhh so then lucky for me Nicole's mom took me home on her way to work, and i got home and got my schedual... lets c  1.) American- Lefkow  2.) Eng- Maye 3.) Math- Ryan  4.) Lunch  5.)

      Hey, back from camping... Thank God i was goin INSANE!!! I had a good time @ the beach but i missed all my friends so im glad im back. Nothin much happened while i was away i just got home today and then i went out to the mall w/ Dani and Tory. We saw The Borne Supremacy and tht was so so... i mean like it was kinda borin in some parts idk i have a weird taste in movies but i thought this felt a little too long... so yea i had yet another RIDICULOUS curfew but this time it was 9 00!!! I was soooooo pissed lol, but hey @ least i got to see Dani 2day i havent seen her for about 2 weeks but we didnt really get much of a chance to talk like alone i mean lol. I wish i was allowed 2 sleep over @ her house 2night so tht i coulda stayed out later, hopefully this week since its only my dad ill b able to stay out later. Itll also b SOOOOOOOO much easier to get around him bc he doesnt know all my friends home #'s so i wont get busted like i almost did 2day lol... my mom was pissed tht i went to the movies and then like when i called her she was like well how did u get there and i was like Dani's mom drove us so like i was freakin out bc Tory really drove me and like i didnt know if she was gonna call her house or ne thing but she didnt so i didnt get in ne trouble so i definatly feel better, i got scared there for a little while tht i was gonns b grounded during my week of freedom lol... man this sneakin around stuff is gettin old, kinda like my curfews heh heh. well, all's well tht ends well, i think thts how it goes. well thts pretty much my day so later
