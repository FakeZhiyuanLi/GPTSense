      I just don't understand boys.  The latest case is someone I've been secretly crushing over for the past year and a half. Saturday night things finally reached a boiling point and we ended up getting physical for the first time. Now, I don't really know what to do about him. There's a physical distance between us of about an hour, which is the most immediate impedance to my trying to start something with him, but there's also the fact that I'm still unemployed and short on funds to put towards fun in general. So for the past two days, I've been trying to exchange witty banter with him and keep coming up short. I just can't seem to come up with anything funny to say.   If I don't stop this pattern of crash and burn soon, I know he's going to just get tired of my attempts to be cute and tell me to shut the fuck up or something. I guess even after six years of trying, I still don't know my way around boys. Perhaps the intimidation factor is so high because he's someone I always figured to be out of my league. I feel this need to impress the guy because my stupid brain is convinced he'll get bored with me if I don't. I spend too many minutes trying to figure out what to say, and what I finally end up with comes out sounding so stupid.   Am I thinking too much?

      I'm starting to fine tune this thing a little, and I can tell this is going to be a big time waster. That's okay, though, because I've got a LOT of free time on my hands thanks to the fact that I'm still unemployed. Since I know myself pretty well, my bet is that I'll be completely addicted to this for about six months, and then...who knows?

      I work in a high-rise building.   It's a thought that still makes me smile, and today allowed me to appreciate what I would call a Perfect Moment.  Let me explain.  No, there is too much. I sum up. First, I love my job. I'm doing the work I went to school to do, and it's even for a good cause. pay sucks, but you know what? It's not as important to me as the job itself is. In my eyes, that's better than getting paid a shitload of money to do a job that is so-so at best. Plus, there's major karma benefits AND good health benefits. I can't go wrong.  On another somewhat distant but related vein, I've always had a major difference of opinion with my mom when it comes to Los Angeles. Don't worry, it's nothing Feudian. Tonight as I was standing in the smoking patio on the third floor of the building, looking down on Wilshire Boulevard, I realized something about myself. I like the bustle. If I had a choice, I wouldn't pick the cabin in the woods for a primary residence. Instead, it would be where I would go to feel calm again. No, I've always secretly loved being surrounded the harmonics of human interaction. Just watching the world go by brings a sense of fascination and appreciation,  You might say I'm addicted to everyday life.  Mom ain't like that.  No, she grew up in the small town of Elkhart, Indiana. She met dad there. That kind of life, that's what she misses. She can't get over it, either. For the past thirty years, she lived in a place that she accepts but doesn't truly like. Kind of makes me wonder how she feels about me sometimes. She's always talked of moving back East, but now I feel she's resigned herself to living out the rest of her days in a place where she's not as happy as she could be. It's a tragedy that I wish I could rewrite the ending to, but I'm just not in a place to save anyone except myself. If she lasts long enough, one day I'd like to change that. She's watching her world be erased and narrowed into an existence so polar to what once defined a day in her life. I guess I understand why she gets depressed sometimes. I can't imagine ending up like that.  I turned twenty-six on Sunday. This Saturday is my rugby team's first game of the season. God, what an addiction that's become. I've made some pretty wild friendships with those guys, and I just found out last night that one of them works in my building. Way cool. Looking back, the first quarter century has been an amazing educational and recreational experience. Of course all my hopes and dreams didn't come true. Big fucking deal. A lot of the ones I really wanted to did happen, and it only makes me more anxious to see what happens next. I'm happy with my life. Parts of it sucked and were so hard to deal with. I'm actually thankful that everything in my life has progressed the way it did. I didn't make all the right decisions, but I have very few regrets, if any. Life has been an experience that I could never have fathomed for myself, and I am grateful beyond words. I can honestly say I'm happy.  I am fulfilled. All I can say now to the forces of the city is thank you.

        we're out there, everywhere.  As we approach this new era of McCarthyism, let me remind you that we live here too.  Go ahead, restrict our freedom if it makes you feel better, safer, stronger. There are things more important than power to us, and you'll be surprised how hard we will fight for them. You're going to have one hell of a time trying to convice us that you're right if you keep waving your cock at the other side of the world shouting, "mine's bigger! Mine's bigger, DAMMIT!!!"  Shut up and Grow the Fucking Moustache already. At least then people might see you for what you really are.   I'm troubled by the Madness of King George. I wonder to myself how so many people can embrace his ideals without regard for the consequences of their fruition. It's the fear that drives them. It's the dread of no security or safety, even in their own home. And yet, they blindly give up those very things so willingly to him. We have been and always will be a Nation of Hypocrisy, so let's just add imperialism to the list of things we fought against long before deciding to practice it ourselves.  I don't care what the war is about anymore. I don't care if it is the Arab or the Oil, it makes no difference. I'm more terrified of his greed spreading through our people while his fear machine manufactures rationale after rationale.  He tells you who to blame. He tells you what to blame them for. He tells you who's going to kill your children if you don't let him kill them first. Well I'm tired of it. I want to see you use your thinking cap and pick up the clue phone already. A nd don't even think of calling me a revolutionary, either. I'm not here to overthrow you. I'm here to wake you up.   79 days and counting...  Fixed my brakes, bought some porn, watched a couple movies (not porn). Oh yeah, I even did a day's work today too.  I found out today that my boss is sending me to New York and Boston in two months. I may just get to pull off my little prank after all. My psychic neghbor who's dying of cancer says the next two months will be hell, then suddenly my life will be launched into orbit.  I wonder what that means?  I should ask her if she's talked to Nostradamus lately...

        Anger. Bitterness. I lost my first draft of this post and it was fantastic. Goddamn puter. Ah well. Let's see if this version turns out as good:     disclaimer.  I figured out the big secret today. It's a beatiful, clever trick that with any luck, will change the world. It's just going to take time.  I pulled a fast one on the right. They never really caught us, but society has begun to show them what we're up to. I'm comforted by the fact that even if a great battle is faught, what survives will be the fruits of our labors, not theirs. So in a way, even if tomorrow sucks, tomorrow's tomorrow won't be nearly as bad as today.  And no, I'm not going to give away the secret. I mean, like, duh. I know when I started my journey, though. I figured out pretty early on that not everything I learned in school was the whole truth. The shift was near complete when I made the decision to forgo things like marine biology and architecture to study a craft instead of a skill. After all, there is a difference. And I knew I wasn't alone.   And we knew it, just like the hippies whose parents were beatnicks that grew up around flappers who knew it too. It isn't even hard to find, if you know where to look, listen, see and feel. We've always been patient, but persistent. Kind of like sandpaper on your ass, if you like bad similies.  But I see it working, and it gives me a kind of faith that everything will be fine. Fundamentally, it is dependent on where your passion is strongest -- the head.  Or the heart. I know, simple, eh? It's delicious epihany whose utter simplicity and truth makes you laugh out loud, perhaps even make you go a little bit crazy.  Go crazy? Don't mind if I do. Heh heh. *muHAHahAhaaahAHah* wooga wooga  *naRf* bOrK! bOrK!! bOrK!!! *uNf**uNf* ArrrrRrRr, the hot panTs! *RaaaAaaWrrr*  i like monkeys. *aB cRuNcHiNg, TeEtH cLeNcHiNg, BiCeP bUlGiNg, ChEsT pUmPiNg, BuTt FlExInG, oNe ToO mAnY jAnE fOnDa WoRkOuT vIdEoS sNoRt*   just kidding.  The internet saved our asses, but only because we got to it first. We embraced the big change and shaped its future. I'm not worried...yet. I think we're going to do just fine.  Have a hysterically devlish idea for an April fool's prank. All I need is access to the voicemail system at our office in New York...  *quack*  On an unrelated note, number 3 got roughed up by number 2 (who was being shoved around by number 1). It happens like that sometimes, but that's what you have to expect when everyone's trying to be 0.  86...

      figures.        Which Izzard Are You?   Butch Izzard: More likely to wear a leather jacket than a summer frock, you look at things from a more rambunctious and bronzey kind of way. That doesn't mean that you won't sweet-talk someone, it just means you'll find a better innuendo with which to do it. You'd love to have a cup of coffee.     the angels are going into hiding.  88 days. He says it could happen any day now. He keeps sending more and more soldiers to the desert, and nobody can understand why. Everywhere people are protesting, and other countries are backing away, refusing to support this stupid stupid idea that there's an evil that must be destroyed before it has even proven itself to be so evil. I'm beginning to worry that my brother will leave and never come back. I'd miss him.  Last week I was hanging out with DJ Mary Jane, a good friend of many years (we did time together in junior high, both of us social outcasts that somehow managed to turn out better off than many of our peers) who spins amazing sets of top-notch drum n' bass and shares my love of  urlLink Margaret Cho . Whilst sitting around and smoking a bowl, a conversation began between us about the city and how she's changing. We both know this isn't the Los Angeles of two years ago. Lately, more and more people have flocked here, many because of opportunity but many more have come because  the  hope  of opportunity inevitably drives them to the Dream Factory.   I don't know who to blame.   Mary Jane is saddend by the realization that the locals are systematically being driven underground, supplanted by the fresh young wanna-be's who think they know their shit better than the wanna-be next to them and are desperate to prove it.  There's only so many places in this town to prove your worth, and now even the locals can't get a foot in the door. Sure, we usually have better connections...I don't know a single (local) friend who doesn't either have a relative or a co-worker who is a member of  urlLink AMPAS  (read: we never have to rent movies). But I see it among the many circles of friends I've been fortunate to fall in with. The culture of the city is becoming more and more hidden as we slowly shift from going into the nightlife to creating our own. It's like the city is so polluted that we'd rather just stay home.   But I knew this was coming. The signs were there. It started at the raves.  It was sad, going to parties we thought were intimate only to find hundreds of people there who lacked respect for what they were witness to. This was never simply a chance to do drugs. This was a family of people who shared a common love for so many things, especially music. I suppose they had a tribal feel to them, all of us dancing wildly to driving beats until dawn, no, exhaustion kept us from dancing any longer. The music never stopped, the vibe flowed between us all like an umbilical cord connecting us all to something bigger. But like I said, things began to change.  We've hidden ourselves again. I don't go to raves in this city anymore, save the occasional Gathering of the Tribes or a party at the Studio, parties that usually start or end at someone's house instead of a dilapidated venue like the Fox Theatre (thank GOD they shut that place down!). A few years back we gave up our phat pants and pacifiers, and effectively gave up the boisterous parties in the process. There are parts of that experience I miss, but the tail end of my raving days left me jaded almost to the point of becoming a "graver." I just couldn't understand why people had to go and ruin such a good thing.  Now, our circles are smaller, tighter and stronger. But the music is better than ever. We still go to the desert and the mountains, but nobody spreads the word. We bring friends to meet our family and celebrate life under the stars.   And we dance like nobody's watching.

       communion.  Momma, I went to a revival.  But this wasn't no halleluja praise the lord revival, mind you. This was a gathering of the tribes. We came together in the middle of a city who does not know herself under the full moon, dancing to music that   moves  you. And we went to chuch, Electric Skychurch, to be exact. We celebrated the day of Mr. King and danced our dreams into sky, hoping that someone, something might hear them and answer our prayer for peace.  90 days.  I made her dinner, thinking to myself how hard it must be to resist the urge to play with his butt. The only reason I even contemplated the notion was because of our little chat yesterday in which she revealed that she's just as horny as I am. And you can't blame her, I mean her boyfried is awesome. He's a kyoot guy with a passion for music that is so right on it's scary.   So I made them dinner.  We smoked a bit and listened to tunes while she and I put the finishing touches on a dish I've decided to call "puttanesca toscana." The damn thing turned out so good we forgot to eat our salads. If I know what's good for me, I'll write this recipe down because it sure is a keeper.  After that awesome meal, we drove through the streets of down town until we found ourselves amongst those who could only afford a tent to sleep in. Their homes lined the sides of the street in a fashion that reminded me of a Monopoly board. I wondered to myself about what they did to keep warm.  We walked past buildings coated with graffitti. Some had been vandalized, otheres had put it there for artistic value. Yet again, two very different worlds collided in a place that gave the atmosphere a certain surreality to it. Art and expression were one. They told me about a sushi bar called R-23 and insisted we all go there sometime soon. We rounded a corner and I could feel the beat pulsing out of the building and rippling down the street. Paid our fee (to the children with AIDS in South Africa), and went to church.  I once wrote about dancing, and how it is the closest to heaven I've ever come. There's no doubt in my mind that it's spiritual. I can't deny the sensory explosions, the feeling of unity and the sound that brings us all together in a way only this music can. It is not a night out, or something to do when I'm bored. No, it is a moment where everything makes sense as we gather and celebrate life together through the movement and expression of our bodies, our souls.Tonight was one such moment, as Roxanne sang undulating notes above a marvelous beat-driven sound that flowed through us and out of us through our hands and feet.   I won't bother going to bed.   Perhaps later, after I've done a few chores and smoked a bowl and jerked off. Then I'll feel keen to throw my face against a pillow and walk the other side of consciousness for awhile. But until then, I'll just sit back and ride the high that drugs can't bring me. I'll float on a wave of endorphins so fierce that only one thing could bring this on...dancing.

      I've made a most marvelous new friend.  A new co-worker, fresh from the Heart of Texas has settled in the cube across from me and kept me in utter fascination ever since he got here.   No, it's not a romantic thing.  He's just way cool.  Bright fellow, handsome, clever, talented practicioner of many arts, tremendously funny, and a fellow fan of salad. I feel like I've been blessed with a partner in crime. It's funny. Up until now, I've never made a regular habit of celebrating that blessed hour of the afternoon, twenty minutes past. It sure does help my work, and I think that's just fucking hysterical.  Self-medication: The only way to be sure the remedy is doing ts job.  From the Further Proof of Fate department, this is the result of my  urlLink inkblot test :    Your unconscious mind is driven most by  Peace   You are driven by a higher purpose than most people. You have a deeply-rooted desire to facilitate peacefulness in the world. Whether through subtle interactions with love ones, or through getting involved in social causes, it is important to you to influence the world.  You are driven by a desire to encourage others to think about the positive side of things instead of focusing on the negative. The reason your unconscious is consumed by this might stem from an innate fear of war and turmoil. Thus, to avoid that uncomfortable place for you, your unconscious seeks out the peace in your environment.  Usually, the thing that underlies this unconscious drive is a deep respect for humankind. You care about the future of the world, even beyond your own involvement in it. As a result, your personal integrity acts as a surrogate for your deeper drive toward peace and guides you in daily life towards decisions that are respectful toward yourself and others.  Though your unconscious mind is driven most strongly by Peace, there is much more to who you are at your core.     I guess I'm working in the right kind of job, then.  Busy week at work. Tried twice to write down *my* thoughts but everyone else's kept getting in the way. It just hasn't been a good week for the queers. He says transgenders don't exist. Yeah, and the world is flat. And Earth is the center of the Universe. And Bush is doing the right thing. Sure.    Don't you dare tell us how to live our lives.   A dark fear in my soul tells me that the lawmen will listen. That's when the real fighting will begin. Pretty soon, the artists will join our ranks as the Church tries to take over America. And as soon as they get their fingers into the law... I'm beginning to figure things out, why the threat of war is upon us, why the nation of Islam will be sacrificed as the catlyst for a greater battle soon to follow. In the end, persecution will come not from outside our borders. It will come from within.   Danger.  But I'm fighting the good fight. It started with a promise to Gaia that I would defend her as a knight would for his kingdom. I keep telling myself I beleive in a force, something that I can see and feel in every living thing around me. Call it the collective ethereal goop that exists as the soul. There are many of us out there, fighting the same fight on many fronts disguised as issues, armed with words instead of weapons. I wonder who will win.  She lives her life like the rock in the river. She cannot move with the water as it winds its course through the mountains and into the ocean. Instead, she holds fast against the current, slowly wearing down as years of constant movement around her chip tiny fragments away at her surface. Everything has been changing around her while she's held tenaciously to that which she knows as herself. It is why she fears so much.  92 days.

      feh.   My car won't pass smog thanks to some tiny little cheap parts in my transmission that cost about 150 bucks. Problem is, the labor to install said parts is over 700. May I remind the fates that my income level is not conducive to these kinds of repairs? I mean, why do I hade to pay 150 bucks just to run a goddamn diagnostic test? This really throws a wrench into things. Guess it's time to start buying lottery tickets and selling my organs on Ebay...  Last night my ex bf Brendan paid a visit from his new home in Vegas. I made dinner, we smoked a few bowls and watched  Kiki's Delivery Service . Big night on the town. Woo. I can tell he misses the city, but for him, Vegas may in fact be a better place for him. Of course, right now I'm of the mentality that any pleace where I don't need a car and can make good money sounds pretty fucking good. Here's hoping I last it out in Los Angeles.  I'm tired. Can I get off this ride?  97 days...

      Oops. Blogger fuckup.  So anyways, it reminded me of how I feel about Tori Amos.   last night I watched Studio Ghibli's  Kiki's Delivery Service . It made me think about how poor Disney just doesn't get it. Their arrogance combined with their ignorance has left them pretty much in the dust when it comes to animation. The financial stats for  Treasure Planet   practically make the argument for me. Disney's losing touch with the crowd. They still insist on creating a product so saturated in sugar that you can't even tell just what that product is supposed to look like. It's no wonder the stockholders are pissed, and I'm sure Mr. Eisner is trying to come up with an answer to explain it. It really is a shame they've got their heads so far up Mickey's ass.  Disney forgot how to tell a good story. The depth is gone, the cinematography is mediocre. And if they were paying attention, they'd realize the bar was raised a long time ago. But no, every year it's another goddamn musical. It's like they can't even take themselves seriously, much less their audience.  Please guys, it's embarassing.  I won a wireless keyboard. woo.  :)

      99 days till the revolution.  I saw an article in the  urlLink /WB122471.DTL">SF Chronicle  today about Joni Mitchell. It really mirrors how I feel about  urlLink Tori Amos . What can I say? I'm crazy for the girl.   Last night I watched  Kiki's Delivery Service , an anime from Studio Ghibli, and absolutely loved it. It made me think about Disney, and why they carry on with this incredible combination of arrogance and ignorance for an art that they obviously are not studying?   Examine, if you will, two recent films: Disney's  Treasure Planet  and Studio Ghibli's  Spirited Away . While their box office grosses pretty much prove my case for me, the underlying truth is that Disney just can't write a good story anymore. To be honest, it's been off and on with them for quite some time. But anyone who has seen both films cannot deny that there's a sense of real artistry about a Ghibli film that you don't see in a Disney one because it's covered in sugar.  The animated music idea...get over it. I think you've done it enough times. Try telling a story with  real  depth some time, would ya Mike? It's embarassing.

      The City spoke to me again tonight. He was a veteran who washed the egg off my windshield while  I was inside buying a quart of oil for Betty. Luckily, I had a dollar in my wallet. It wasn't as much as I wanted to give him, but it was all the cash I had. I listened to him talk about what he went through and how it felt like it was happening all over again. His disbelief in the fate of history's ability to repeat even its stupidest mistakes passed over his face as his squegee diligently cleared the Windex from the window of the passenger door.  I'm counting the days till the revolution.  This evening, as I was driving home from dinner and a movie at Paul & Bianka's, one question kept running through my head:  Why would he go and do that which so many of his people oppose?  So it starts here. I give this nation one hundred days before all hell brakes loose. My bet is that the West will battle the East, decrying the same actions we once fought against together. If it  were  to happen...I do not know who would win. It shouldn't come to this. Even the righteous pay their debts with blood.   I never dreamed of a time when logistics would allow me the priveledge to spend more time with Bianka. There must be a reson for this sudden convergence. With work only minutes away, we now spend evenings together, cooking, talking, smoking, thinking. A friendship is blossoming, one I'd quietly hoped for without realizing it. And this isn't the first time in recent months. My gut tells me a shift is coming...perhaps even I have begun to batten down the hatches.

      People rarely, if ever, look up.  I came to this conclusion while looking down (of course)  on the bustle of Wilshire Boulevard from the third floor of the parking structure at work. What drew me to the edge was not the scene below, but the golden rays of the California sun leaking through the steel piping that lined the building's exterior. I approached them carefully, slowly moving into their path and rejoicing at the sensation of their penetration into my skin. As the golden warmth spread through my body on a January noon, I cast my gaze downwards for a bit of my favorite pasttime...people watching.  People rarely, if ever look up.  I thought it in my head as I watched the cars rush past the pedestrians walk past the bums sitting in front of the buildings. I thought it as I saw their determined faces pressing forward, outward, onward. I began to wonder how often we unintentionally(?) blind ourselves by staring straight ahead instead of looking around. Would they notice the young man with a cigarette looking down with a peaceful stare? Would they see the steel bird soaring over a nearly cloudless and crystaline blue sky?   Most of us just aren't paying attention anymore.  And it's not just when we're driving or walking or working or eating or playing. We are better than you'd think at selectively tuning out the parts of the world we do not wish to be bothered with. Ignorance, the new religion.  I regularly discover something else I've been taking for granted.  This week it was person, last week it was place, next week it's thing. Somehow I doubt that I'm alone. Feh.   New Years Eve took me back to Studio 3025 for one hell of a party. I was a bit naughty, but very well behaved. Saw my family...the one I like. The family that is comprised of the close friends that one only discovers after time has passed and experiences have brought you together.  Bianca and I put the finishing touches on her fantastic selection of edibles and smoked a few bowls between dishes. The girl is amazing...I can't beleive how creative and  clever she is. In the two years that I've known her and the circle of friends we now share, I've come to love them all to death. The music brought us together, a common passion to seek out the rhythms and dance to them until the skies over the Mojave desert changed from black to violet to red to blue.   Slowly but surely, I'm figuring out my place in the world. What's exciting is the knowledge of who will be along for the ride. We may be on this road, but we're just imposters in this country.

      When I'm bored, my last bastion of entertainment is usually gay.com. I like surfing through the profiles because it's a bit like people watching (a favorite pasttime). You can pick up on subtle things about the person just from the way they present themselves. For instance, most guys whose pic shows them at a distance of more than 3 feet from the camera are insecure about the way they look. People rarely, if ever, tell you the real story in these things.  The left is sliding to the right...makes me think that when the battle comes, the sides will be far from even. Yet another thing to consider as I count down the days. It's hard to beleive this whole war is really happening...I mean, how can a man justify an action that surely will tear his own nation apart? I pray that he's going into this blind, that there is some last bastion of humility inside that hasn't kicked in because the damn fool doesn't know enough to understand...and act differently. I want to beleive that in his heart he means well. There's just so much proof against that theory right now, though. I guess all I can do is wait and act on my conscience. I haven't quite figured out what my role in this is yet.  It sure would be nice to know...

      I've got to get out of this "weekend update" mode.  Sometimes it's Lakers flags. Sometimes it's fruit. Sometimes they're hideous framed pictures for eight ninety-nine. On Saturday it was military gask masks, twenty dollars. These people on the streets really are not helping things one bit. That's right folks, it's time to let the fear sink right into your soul. Your worst nightmare is about to come true, sweetheart. The best part is that you'll get hit twice. I don't know about you, but it sure as hell isn't the war outside our borders that I'm afraid of.  All around me people are quietly shifting to one side or the other, and I've yet to determine which side I am on. I know I can't stand in the middle, but at least I have 54 days to figure it out.  Did the usual rugby thing on Saturday, followed by brunch with co-workers at this gorgeous house in Fryman Canyon. Kel lives at this way cool two-story number with a courtyard and a kickass bathtub. Smoked them all out like the crazy pot samaritan that I've become and had fabulous omelttes out in the sun. God I love this town...  Sunday I did brunch with Dan and a fellow artist (one who's  actually been published - twice!). Dan made the following announcement as we scarfed down slices of bacon at the table:  "Whenever my husband and I fight, he makess his apologies with some little gift from Bloomingdale's. To help him out, I've registered my entire list of apologies." I looked at him with a smile. "And what did he say when you told him that?" "Well," Dan replied, "now he's afraid to speak to me, so it worked."  Every time he mentions that store I think about how I can't go in there anymore thanks to him.

      what a  weekend .   Let's see...recap. Friday, 8:00am: Wake up in the cozy bedroom of my boss' boss. There's a furry red sausage named Roxanne under the covers and on top of my right calf. Housesitting.   Break out an all-black outfit (save the boxers, which were a dense blue & white plaid) and head to work. Feels like the weekend at 10:30. Feeling generous, I happily distribute my remaining pop tarts among some co-workers as an afternoon snack. This was around 4:40pm. Splash a bit of cologne on and hit the town with Dan. We grab dinner over at Farmers Market, shovel it in and rush over to the Grove to see  Chicago . Come out buzzing and wander over to Here for a few drinkies. As usual, I feel completely out of place among the Beautiful People but I indulge for Dan's sake. He enjoys the atmosphere. I wish I could, but there's a heavy stench in the air that reeks of pretention. It's the kind of scene that is more amusing for me to watch than to actually engage myself in. Does that make me a snob?   Retire to the Treehouse, as I have become fond of calling it, with Dan in tow around 1am. I'm zonked. I pop in some anime and pass out. Dan stays up till god knows when on the computer. During the course of the evening I am scolded by Dan for not whoreing myself properly online. This thought comes with me to unconsciousness...I cannot say why. Wake up in the AM and get ready for my brother's arrival. He's coming with me to my rugby match because we're meeting our father and his wife. And I've got coworkers coming. Shit, I hope we put on a good show. I say bye to Dan but get no response. Odd...   We get taught a lesson by the Bucks (again) and this time few of us stick around for the social. Those who do don't stay long, my brother and I included.  A swift return to the Treehouse and we say goodbye after I finish feeding the dogs. I take a quick shower and shave and then smoke a bowl as I sit down at the computer and log myself onto a pair of meet markets. I get more than a few nibbles, and what's sad is that the really hot ones all live close to home...but not here. Mouthafucka. Find a Burning Man guy and think to myself, what the hell? It's been a good seven weeks, and dammit I'm frisky so come on over I've got a hot tub and you give a mean massage thirty minutes great see you soon.   *blink*    did I just do that?    I guess I better tidy this place up. Check the hot tub to make sure it's working and wouldn't you know it the damn thing is broken. So much for getting nekkid in a hot tub. Fantasy tabled for future use...   Let's just say I got exactly what I needed that night, and once again in the morning for good measure. *raWr*  now I feel bad sore  and  good sore. This is kind of nice. Maybe this is what Shaggy was talking about, but on a lesser scale...of sorts. Spend the rest of the day doing busy work like laundry and buying a snowboard. Goddamn eBay strikes again. I have this financed however by my endeavours this weekend so I'm not worried. I want a new toy, and I think I'll get more use out of this than a PS2, which is what I was saving up for. I'll wait for another windfall for technology because I won't have to save as much money for it. Besides, it just so happens to be prime hunting season for gear.   Share the good news to Bianka and Paul when I arrive at their pad for the 300th episode of the Simpsons. As usual, the fucked up folk of Springfield do not dissapoint. I return to the Treehouse and cruise eBay looking for ideas on gear choices. I decide to visit a store tomorrow to try out boots and see what fits and what doesn't. Rise around 10am, very sore. Don't like this one bit. Weekend's catching up to me, I think. Do chores around the house and surf a bit more. Head over to Big 5 around 8pm (to prevent myself from spending too much time there) and find myself in the midst of a half-off sale. Shit.  I start playing with the bindings, examining the boots for durability, comfort level, general style and color choices. Hey, I want to  look good. While in the midst of browsing another customer started probing me for information and my advice on the stuff in front of us. I blurted out what nuggets of information I had gleaned from reading countless eBay descriptions and manufacturer catalogues. He then asked me what I was getting. "Oh, I'm not getting anything. I'm just looking.." I replied.  "Are you kidding? It's 70% off. You have to get  something .  So I did. And for a song. Due to a construction flaw I got a sweet pair of  urlLink Airwalk boots  at 80% off (they retail for $175, I paid $52), which I promptly exchanged tonight(?) at another store for a pair that was fine. I would have paid the 10% difference, but they didn't even ask to see my reciept. They just took them to the back and brought out the replacement. Sweetness. Total cost of way cool  urlLink Hobie snowboard , Body Glove bindings, the above mentioned boots and a bag was $206, tax included. A PS2 with 2 game pads and a game I'd actually play would cost me a minimum of $250  plus  tax. And this is actually a healthy outdoor activity. Besides, the cost of a new game is more or equivalent to the cost of a lift ticket. :P  Today...well...had lots to do at work. Ditched practice, went to the gym instead. Came home and read the best  urlLink argument   for the war that I've yet heard.   nap time.

      66 days till all hell brakes loose. Well, hell will be pretty much unleashed for a while before then, but on day sixty-six the ties that bind will break. Things will never quite be the same after that. I wonder if we'll get sirens soon. "Gee guys, it's like what grandpa told us about in 1943..."   I can see the treads starting to unravel. Quietly, everywhere...things are  slipping . I can see it in some of my closest friends. Bianka doesn't know if Osama Bin Laden is real. She questions the existence of this character because the "experts" who always identify him are CIA. Yeah, it kinda spooks me too a little. I mean, what if this guy was nothing more than a terrifying  Simone ? Soon, those that question the truth will break away from those who administer it. Even I am beginning to have difficulty trusting people now.   It's been a week...got plenty to look forward to. Going to watch  24 Hour Party People  toonight while I pack for a housesitting gig at my boss' place in the Hollywood Hills. Nice pad...with six dogs. One is having incontinence issues. I can't complain. There's a hot tub and he pays me to do it. Rugby game on Saturday in ol' OC. Think I'll go and invite muh dad...

      68 days and counting...the tension just gets worse. Bianka's getting nervous, saying things that make me nervous too. She came by my office to drop off a dvd that she borrowed,  The Royal Tenenbaums . I've only seen the first 30 minutes of the movie...I just had too much to do Friday night when I started watching it with her.  "Do you think it will really happen?" She looks at me with eyes that reveal the fear I hear in her words. "I mean, how far is he going to take us into this war before he realizes it's a mistake? He's making so many people angry..." She drifts off for a moment and her eyes wander around my humble cube. She smiles when she sees the homage to Shag that I made with cutouts from wrapping paper, then she looks down at the floor for a few seconds. "I don't know what's going to happen if he goes to war, but I don't think it will be good. He's going to turn his country against him."  I don't doubt what she says. I see it happening already amongst my friends and I wonder to myself where I will stand. I hear things...that a reisistance is building up and preparing for a battle of another kind, one fought with words. Before Bianka leaves, she looks me in the eyes and asks me a question I simply do not have an answer to:  "Brian, what if we have to resort to something stronger than words to make him listen?"  I try to tell myself that she's as clueless as I am, that we just don't want to think about having to resort to some kind of violent backlash against a country we've lived in all our lives. I can't dismiss this feeling that trouble is brewing...if only he would just listen to reason instead of the oilmen's pocketbooks. Has there ever been a peaceful revolution?  Chest lighter. On, to more pleasant things...   Tried snowboarding for the first time on Sunday. Man, what a harsh learning experience that was. The first time out there was truly brutal. fell down more times than I can count. I took such a beating! My arms, butt and knees...man, my knees got SLAMMED into the mountain so many fucking times. I'm surprised they haven't fallen off.  But on the bright side, it was also easier for me to understand and do than skiing. We won't talk about that. Not pretty. But I totally want to get back on a board again now that I've figured out how to turn and regulate speed. I still have a habit of bending too much, to a point where I look more like I'm surfing and dragging my hand into the snow as I turn sharply into the mountain...shooting into the perfect curl. A few more times on the beginner slopes and I might even be able to try something steeper. While on the mountain, I got a gym membership (go figure). Have to be in tip top shape for rugby...or anything else requiring strength and speed.   Mardi Gras approaches soon. I'm making a commitment to myself to give up smoking any and all substances unless at social functions, and drinking by itself does not count. We're talking only when with Family from here on out. I need to cut my lungs some slack before there comes a time when all I'll be able to do is too little. Too late...

      The Boys In the Band are out playing, but they forgot to wear their jackets. I don't think they realize just how cold it is outside.   It is about to get colder.  There is an Air Force base about an hour north of Santa Barbara, next to a city named Lompoc. My family used to know a guy who worked there...got to tour the place when I was, oh...twelve or thirteen or something. It's the largest surface to air facility on the west coast. NASA actually started building a second launch facility for the shuttle here (I got to see a half-formed launch tower when I was there), but abandoned the plan in the early 90's. Long story short (too late), check out this  urlLink story .  This is no fucking test site upgrade. They're installing nukes.   74 Days. Be afraid, be very afraid.

         Saturday 11:18pm   Last year I wrote her a poem, this year I gave her a canvas on which to write her own musings. I see a great deal of insight in Bianka, a brilliant mind that is quietly waiting to blow the world away with one brilliant thought. I figure an empty book is a good place to start writing some of them down.  The sound here at 3025 is a solid wall of funk -- strong throbbing bass that tickles both the ear and the earth. Friends, those who survived the wild crowded parties of past years, have come together for one funkin' good time in honor of Miss B.  One guy is scatting along to the sounds of a single horn accompanied by a bass guitar and some fierce backbeat.  I'm just spending a few minutes here in the loft with a pen and paper, watching the revelers as I sit cross-legged on the couch. Sometimes it's cool to sit back and watch the party instead of be it.  She wanders through the little gatherings of her friends with a warm, golden smile that bears the slightest flush -- she's been dancing quite a bit tonight. Paul looks up to the loft from the other side of the apartment, scanning for something he apparently does not see up here.  The sound stealthily warps into something more syncopated and danceable, making my feet itch. The cat on the floor is still scattin' away into the microphone. I spot Danielle and Mikey on the first landing talking and trying hard not to attack the Indian food spread out on the table by them for a third time.  Bianka comes up the steps from the kitchen and sits next to me. We chat about the graffiti Chris and Drez sprayed onto their walls as a birthday present. She loves the dragon, but she's annoyed that the speakers are hiding his face. I promise I'll come by on Monday for lunch so I can see. She excuses herself for a moment and returns with a scrapbook that Danl put together containing words and pictures that he collected from us last year. The present arrived just this week, one year late and yet still right on time. She tells me how much she liked my poem, so I open the book to find it and remember what I wrote. It's the last entry:    Bianka Can Dance.  Ever since I�ve known her. She moves like Water.  And she�s happy. As she moves  Across the  Floor With a smile.  The beat is Inside her Heart, The music is  Inside her Soul.  The magic is in Her eyes.    Yup, Bianka. Everyone who added something to the scrapbook did something cool. Pictures, poems, drawings and definitions...I'm sure she loves it. I give her back the scrapbook (which she left me alone to look through), and settle back onto the couch for a few more minutes. The urge to shake that bootie keeps getting stronger, but the proper groove just hasn't punched through the speakers yet. Time for a cigarette.  Outside, Bri informs me he's off to Factory with Ervin, but he promises to return after the club closes at 2. I tell him to make good on his promise because  Ihave something for him...nothing special, just a bottle of Fin Du Monde as a little V-day gift from one jaded single guy to another. They head off, and I finish smoking my ciggie while thinking about how much I've come to respect that guy. I respect him a little bit more every time I talk with him because I've come to realize that his eyes see so much more than people think. Sometimes I think he's been reading my diary when he talks about his past, although I'm still certain his life has been at least doubly colorful as mine. That guy fascinates me.  I feel lucky in a way, because I don't think he shows many people just how deep his waters run. It is only slowly that you become kindred with him, for he is always on guard. There are gifts he gives more freely, like his wit. I concede it is considerably sharper than mine, but I'm guessing he's got more material to work with than I do. In many ways, he's lived a life that I envy. He is a partner to many crimes and adventures, one who will do his best to make a friend laugh or an enemy wince. He's truly a force to be reckoned with, but it only makes me admire him more. Just never break his trust or his good faith, for those are gifts he only gives once.  I can't stop thinking about my trip to New York. Or rugby. Or Jim...I haven't mentioned Jim. I may have to mention him later...World Tour has finally been resurrected, even if I'm not really leaving the continent. But already I have plans to visit NYC, Boston and Seattle...and that's just in the spring! I'm sure glad I got that digital camera for christmas, let me tell you...    12:55am   The funk is on, but this time we're dancing. That vibe (that I've come to find is more dependent on the people around me than the music I'm hearing) has transcended upon us once again as our bodies sing together to the beat. Boom Boom Ska-Boom. Yeah, you feel it in you...it's not a series of rehearsed moves and steps. No, this time it is about what you feel. You ain't moving to the music, sister. the music is moving you.  Brian missed his song.  But he'll return...maybe. If I don't see him again (which, as Bianka privately bitched to me, he's prone to doing, especially if he gets himself some candy while he's out playing in the sandbox) he's an ass for not saying goodbye. I tell myself he didn't say goodbye because he  will  be coming back. After all, I still haven't given him his gift...  76 days. May Columbia's wings forever glide through the vastness of the world outside...

      I finally found time to write...at 2am on a Monday night in Manhattan. First time to this amazing city, and I'm really wishing I had more time to explore. Work is keeping me so damn busy, but it's nice to finally spend some face-to-face time with my boss. There's a schizophrenic toilet in the hotel room next to mine that flushes every five minutes. Spent the evening at a charity dinner before sneakin off with a coworker back to his place to get stoned off the remenants of his wild trip to Amsterdam that he got back from last week. After a nice smoke we went to what had to be one of the slimier dives in the city, a stripper/hustler bar off Broadway called Stella's. The strippers would dance (on what looked like two large boxes pushed together in the corner) for a few, then mingle salaciously with the crowd. I found out a dollar goes a long way in this place...you really get your money's worth. It's too bad the strippers aren't that hot and the place looked like a badly decorated rec room in some poor sap's basement. Tragedy isn't a strong enough word.

      Tke sky has cataracts today.  Rage against the machine is playing on the radio, and I'm surprised that I haven't been hearing it played more often on KROQ. I guess they've gotten to Vicaom too now...everyone is slowly beginning to toe the line. I continue to observe the war less and our people more. Whether we fight or not, society will be upheaved. Kind of spooky, huh? The big question to me is, how far will we push each other before somebody throws the first punch?  Anyways, cataracts. Rain has once again brought the city to a screeching halt. Rugby practice cancelled. Plans for an afternoon at the science musem with Dan have been morphed into a shopping trip in Bev Hills. I have to go to the gym before I meet up with him...and buy groceries. Shit, is there ever enough time? Now my weekends are crazy too. At least tomorrow I'll be on a mountain breaking in the board. Just five guys out for some fun in the snow and I can't wait. And of course, drinking....  Speaking of recreational drinking, my boss is too funny for words. She went around the office telling people she gave me the 17th off as my "floating religious holiday" (we each actually get one of these) with a straight face. Doing time with her in New York City is going to be a real trip. Okay, enough procrastinating.

       Things currently on my mind: 1) I'll be able to leave the city once I've learned how to surf. Don't ask me why, but I just know it. 2) I understand more fully each day why he's calling for war. Even still, I'm convinced that too many people do not. In 44 days we'll know for certain, but my dread still has not left me. Something tells me a great change is coming...and I still can't say for sure if we'll like the outcome. 3) Once again my hobby landed me a job lead...this time for a porn site. I'm a bit nervous, since my design concepts have always been playful, never sultry. God only knows how I'll pull this proposal off. 4) Work...arrrg. I sure hope New York is worth the tension I'm feeling right now. I'm a bit uncomfortable with a battle I'm fighting, mostly because I think I've lost my bias. Is it possible to be truly neutral, yet passionate about what you beleive in? The two seem to contradict... 5) I can't beleive how close I came to visiting this HAWT rugby player in Washington D.C. next weekend. I could kill my team captain right now. *pout* 6) Self-introspection: sexual moods are shifting, and I'm a bit startled and uncertain about how to proceed. For all intents and purposes, it would appear that I'm finally entering my slut phase. While I haven't rightfully earned the title of slut yet, my attitude towards casual sex has definitely changed recently. So far I'm enjoying myself, which probably is not a good thing...

      Work was just a clusterfuck of manic proportions this week, thanks to a talk radio dj that the folks around my office decided was a bad seed. Of course, it's hard to argue with them when you hear what he says for yourself. I felt sorry for the guy, it sounded to me like he was leaking anger from every pore. When he opened his mouth, it was a geyser. Wrote down a few choice bits in an email and shot it off into the ether. That afternoon, he went on the air and was immediately taken by his wrath. I listened to him call me a sewer rat. I heard him cry out that his rights were being violated.   I smelled something in his voice...  Fear. I think he realized he was in trouble. But he was so angry about it, so mad with rage, that I felt sorry for him. I copied down his words and gave them to my boss - who smiled and announced that we had fresh ammuniton. I had done my part...for now. Felt a bit thrilling in a way, but not simply because I thought we actually had a chance to bring this guy down. I felt the way I used to feel in the newsroom of the school paper. The ethrill of an exciting story and something big...and being a part of it somehow. It was a hard week to tackle, but I feel good about it.   Lost a coworker on Friday who worked in IT. It turns out she had been blackmailing someone high up. The freaky part was that she was happy about getting fired. Apparently she had been trying for months.   Going out with the boys tonight to network with other jocks. Horoscope scolded me today, I'm guessing for my behavior last night. Lesson learned, point taken. I know I met the third ghost last night. I'm just a little confused because I think I know who the second was...but I don't remember the first.  Mardi Gras comes Tuesday, as do my final days as a regular smoker of all things. Making the switch to gum, we'll see how it goes. I'm limiting myself to parties from now on, and thank goodness they don't happen much often anymore. I guess you could say this is like lent, except for the long term. I really hope I can go through with it.   Finalized my tattoo idea today. Once it's inked, I figure things will change. Call it an action of faith, if you will. I think I need to hit Venice up for a henna version to be sure.  I should do that before I go to New York...

      I've just come home from Bianka's and her house now has posters all over the walls...black and white protest posters that Jeff made and printed out. My favorite is a photograph of an oil rig with the caption, "Our troops will come home when business picks up."   I found out what was in the crates.   we made plans for April 20 and then I realized it also happens to be Easter Sunday. how do I explain this odd combination of holiday festivities to my family when they ask me where I'm going at 4pm? my luck, we'll probably be sitting down to dinner right about that time.  a pity the humor rides on bittersweet waves of irony this time. The surf crashes in a week...will I be on a board or caught in the rip curl?  there is a safe place I can go, out in the desert. I could drive out to Our Own Space with water, my gear and the parachute for a bit and just try to wait things out. but the water wouldn't last very long and one thing I do lack is a weapon of some sort. how would I protect myself? there's only so much faith I can place in Gaia's hands, you know? I can't go out there alone. Dan....what about him? we haven't spoken in weeks and I'm troubled by it.  sometimes there's distance between us, but when we come together the experiences are always...explosive. I think spending too much time with him would be like sensory overload for that oft overlooked sense of humor. I've never met a funnier guy to talk with, and I can tell he's one of those friends I'll see to the death. our lives have a story together, and it one not easily forgotten. there's no doubt I'll miss him when he's gone.   enough politics. it's Easter. get freaky already...

      I'm home, but it sure doesn't feel that way. I'm still caught in the time warp that New York left me in and I landed back in Los Angeles four days ago. That town really puts you through the ringer! Some nights I was out with co-workers, some nights it was just me and me alone. I had a date with a bartender who kept buying me long beach iced teas where he worked. I spent nights with the Gotham rugby team both in their hometown and at a leather bar in Boston.   I wrote a little...as soon as I find what I wrote I'll put it in here. Thank god the folks at IT were able to find me a laptop. I don't know what I would have done without it during this trip! I took a lot of photographs. Some of them turned out amazingly well, mostly exterior shots of buildings and scenery. I found a plethora of anti-war graffiti on Harvard Bridge. The seams of the nation are splitting everywhere...  The conference in Boston was an experience I can't quite put into words, save to say I left feeling raw and exhausted. I photographed the conference from start to finish and somehow managed to write two stories, host an online shat and sleep with a Aussie swimmer. Not bad for four days in a city I've never been to before.  But the trip just kept me so busy...didn't get to see any museums or do any of the touristy things that someone visiting New York for the first time is required to do by law. I spent plenty of time underground, even at time when it would have been safer to take a cab. The fact that there were armed national guardsmen in most of the subway stations did quite a bit to ease my fears. It's also pretty easy for me to make myself look menacing. All I need is a beanie and a scowl and a pair of blue jeans...from that point it's all about attitude.  I got back home to discover Bianka's been a busy little bee. I think she knows the time is coming too. She and Paul have done a bit of, er...shopping since I last saw them. their apartment is filled with survival gear and unmarked crates. Where did all this shit come from? Is there something going on here that I missed?

HomoFabulous  :  nice   lokalkidd  : But I'm an ignorant fuck...I thought he meant the boss too. In retrospect I'm sure he was picking up on me.   HomoFabulous  :  riiiight. So dinner and...?   lokalkidd  : the boss says she's tired so I head off with Jack back to the W hotel...dayum is that place SWANK. We went to this rooftop bar that was made to look like a clambake on the beach, complete with changing tents and firepits.  homo: oooooooooh. :) Drinkies?   lokalkidd  : yeah, 3 margaritas on the rocks (the way any good margarita should be)...and I only paid for one. ;) spent most of the evening talking to this righteous brit lesbian from U Penn who's an associate professor in the comm studies department. There was another girl who told me about how the previous night she had gotten smashed and fucked a guy who was way older than her...and she's married. ;P   HomoFabulous  :  shit! hahahaaha. sounds like you had some good entertainment.   lokalkidd  : yup yup. around midnite we all went up to Jack's room and looked up fur suit sex sites while he played Vice City on the PS2 in the room. Talk about sweet digs...   HomoFabulous  :  yeah yeah, enough about the room. so what happened?   lokalkidd  : well, everyone left 'cept me and I was showing him how to do some tricks with Vice City...then suddenly we were kissing and, well...the clothes just started flying. ;)   HomoFabulous  :  yup, you're a whore. :P But you should still call the other guy back. Don't just abandon him. Did you use your usual tricks on him?   lokalkidd  : yeah...;P I'll call him tomorrow.   HomoFabulous  :  of course you will. :P

      Sears is going down.  East coast bullies are moving in and taking out everything we've come to know and trust, and you see it most in retail. Corporate recycling has been going on here in L.A. for some time now. Though I've come to expect it as a natural course, it's troubling to watch it happen.  People fear this kind of change because deep inside they fear that they'll forget the very landscape of their lives if there aren't any reminders left to trigger memories.  In Los Angeles, however, that kind of change is ingrained in every aspect of the city, be it geographical, architectural or cultural landscape. Whether we like it or not, living here is simply that way...unless you take a picture, you'll be hard pressed to find your memory twenty years from now. To oversimplify things, you could say we like to keep things pretty here. The price we pay is our lack of history and percieved cultural depth. I haven't made up my mind on the subject of depth, but only because my exploration of our culture is still young. I grew up here, but even I have not yet fully explored what She holds beneath her cement ribbons.   Got my ass chewed off at work today, and really felt humiliated because I lied to my boss and she found out. She was troubled by the fact that I didn't feel I could be honest with her...it had nothing to do with what I did.  That  part she apparently already understood and was okay with. How do I explain that it's my nature...I've always had a few trust issues. I don't blame them on any relationship nonsense. Truth is, that's just the way I've always been. I feel like I really let her down, and it left me thinking about a few resolutions I need to make good on. Something tells me that when I do, fortune will blink...

      For the record, the new commercials for Adult Swim are awesome. Simple, elegeant and inherently grin inducing, they only lead me to suspect that Toon is looking to steal sweeps out from under the Big Four. Bully for them if they pull it off...lord knows it's been my late night choice for ages.   My older brother won an Emmy over the weekend, and I'm stunned but not really suprised...that is, I know his talent was incredible - I just never would have dreamed ATAS would notice, ya know? It's a real feather in his cap, and with any luck will result in an offer or two from down here. Buddha knows his wife is so fucking eager to move back here...I think she misses the sunshine. :)  Sat around the Treehouse this weekend again while the boss ran off to Yosemite. He'd never been, so I told him about my favorite hikes there and wished him happy trails. Long Beach pride was the same weekend, and like last year the team made an appearance. Only this time, we got paid to walk around and mingle with the vendors and festivalgoers. Not a bad deal if you ask me...easy way to combine fundraising and recruiting at the same time. Rest of the weekend was quiet, just like work today. Did some thinking about where I want to be at the end of the year, and I need to start cracking if it's going to happen. So much to do...

      All the headaches I got during the weeks leading up to this past weekend with my fellow Rebels in Seattle could have been twice as painful and they still would have been worth it. I'm so with you Spen. As long as I'm not stuck with latrine duty (I'd much rather prefer to be acting chef), it's the platoon life for me.  I don't often find myself so wholly absorbed by a hobby...no, that's such a blatant lie. It's happened many times for many different reasons (reading, writing, comics, web design, raising minions, world domination) that were never quite the same. Rugby, however stands out because I feel like one of the boys for the first time. I couldn't help thinking during Naked Chicken that we were a bunch of twelve year-olds at the swimmin' hole.  There's no better time like the present to make up for missed opportunities. :)  Unlike most folks I know, my waist size is smaller now than it was at age twelve. Still kind of weird to think about...but the point I suppose is that I'm having more fun than a barrel of dead monkeys, and I get to drink too. I've never spent time with such a rowdy, fun-loving bunch of guys like this before, and (holy buddha) the entertainment value alone is stunning...but there's even more. I've grown close to this team that is probably best descibed as Bad News Bears gone horribly, horribly lecherous and violent...and very gay. All that does is add sarcasm, drama and really dark humor. And for all of that and more I love them like brothers.  Who knew I'd become addicted to twisted ankles and knotted shoulders merely because of the company I was allowed to keep while getting them? Sport is a truly amazing, maddening thing. Should it perhaps be considered one of the Passions? For centuries men and women alike have sought out this exact same thing, like a genetically programmed elective class we were all required to take under the direction of Ma Nature. She doesn't give us exact instructions, mind you. All she bestows upon is is the urge to play. Most find their own favorite way to express this urge. I found mine here, with these men who make me laugh as well as bleed (wow, that doesn't sound right at all.). Blame it on my Irish blood...or my fey gifts...or my love of guinness...or the fact that I got assed out of playing sports as a kid because of a seizure disorder...for whatever the reason, I've been infected with SARS: Severe Adiction to Rugby Syndrome.  One way to put it in perspective would be this: I'm not even remotely bothered that I didn't get laid. Now that may sound incredibly shallow, the point is that I had so much fun exploring a brand new city with everyone that I don't even care about what I missed out on. The two boys I lusted over were both married anyways, and I just wasn't feeling the homewrecker vibe this week. I may be horny, but thanks to my parent's skilled installation of Catholic virtues at a very early age I'm still hanging onto a few morals. It's only a matter of time before I crack the code and take those out too, but damn, Mom did some good work. If I had known how much fun I was going to miss out on, I would have put a stop to her nonsense earlier. heh heh...

      a hundred days went by...what was I expecting? a new war between us did not break out, but I still smell it...king George declared his war ended, and I'm still unhappy with the results. that's right, George. tell 'em that we're better and stick out your tongue. real mature.  nyah nyah nyah...we have your oil. gee, I feel happy. don't you?  what? our economy's still broken? damn...well i'm out of ideas...  motherfucker.  war's no way to fix an economy. try using your head this time, ok? you only have one more chance, and you've pissed a LOT of people off. war still on the horizon though. the Great White Machine keeps rollin, and Jeff is still making posters. there's dissent among the ranks, that's for sure. a revolution sure would be nice once all the fighting was over.  did brunch with Dan today and his two friends Cute and Desperate. Cute's older, but he has a remarkable handsomeness that very few manage to pull off on a regular basis. great smile. Cute is married to Desperate, a chap who has driven down a much rougher road. Desperate has tried drugs. lots of drugs. lots and lots and lots of drugs. Cute indulges in some pot and very little else, but Desperate loves the party favors. Desperate also likes to "mix things up."   the first time I met Desperate was at brunch a few months back. he put the moves on me then pretty heavy, and the fact that we had smoked a little only complicated things. one moment we were eating homemade blueberry waffles, the next Dan and I were modeling squarecut swimsuits for the boys and getting groped by Desperate.   weird situation, that's for sure. I won't get involved because I can tell it wouldn't end up well. besides, there's too much else going on in my life...no energy for it. work is stepping up around Santorum's remarks and what's being said about what he said and she said and they said.  big rugby tourney coming up soon and I may have caused a fuckup. I sure hope I can fix things...those guys are my brothers.

      the world is changing.  I have the strange sensation that I'm a part of history, that things I've done have actually meant something in the grand scheme of things. I'm connecting myself to events happening in a way I hadn't thought possible. take, for instance, my boss. He was involved in that case that the Supreme Court ruled on this week...and I helped him.  you gotta take pride in that, man. Shit like this is going to end up in books...or whatever we use to record history from here on out. I played a part. I fought the good fight. and yeah, life could be a hell of a lot better for me right now, but at least I can say that I'm doing something to change the world into a better place. proportionally speaking, there aren't very many folks who can say that (and know for sure that it's true).   you could say I'm improving the lives of many at the expense of my own.  perhaps that's my lot, I'm cool with that. though I still think a war is coming, I'm not as worried as I was before. I can feel the sides shifting...but where they're shifting to isn't as clear anymore.   my mom called today. the cops impounded her car because she was parking it on the street with expired plates. man, was she pissed. she kept me on the line for two hours, bitching about eleven thousand things in a perfectly calculated order, ensuring that their delivery was seamless and intoxicating.  the neighbor's kid keeps bugging her to let him wash her car because he needs money.  her brother is on disability again, and if he'd stop acting like a weasel then he might actually be in better sorts. I point out to her the hypocrisy of her actaully saying that to him, and she replies cooly: "well duh. what kind of idiot do you take your mother for? I'm old, Joe, not senile."  another girlfriend is getting married in two weeks. my beloved gang of hags is slowly dwindling from a harem to a handful. I'm seeing less of them with each passing year, as I await the moment when I'll discover which one is my Grace.  Right now there are three in the running, and one has a kid. she could become a liability later on if she's still single, but at the very least it'll be entertaining. besides, we have good KROQ karma. between the two of us, we win shit from them pretty regularly. this month it's a movie premiere, and next month it'll be a concert. we've got the love of the city on our side, I guess. I'm storing my karma up for the Bijork concert in August, because box seats for that show would fucking rock. you just know she'd going to have a full orchestra with her, because at the Bowl it would be a crime not to. you'll come for the food, you'll stay for the show.

      Vegas. it's the city that invented the Disco Nap. for without it, there's no way in hell you'll survive Vegas. Los Angeles sleeps. New York sleeps. Tokyo and London...they sleep. not Vegas.   I'd hate to be the guy who opens the electric bill at Bellagio or the Venetian. my money says the engergy crisis in California was caused by Vegas, because that place is so disgustingly lavish when it comes to flair. I'm trying to calculate the portion of the quarter that I've just dropped into the Addams Family slot machine  that goes towards the bill. if these assholes were smart, they'd invest in fuel cells...their profit margin would skyrocket. of course, the initial expense at current prices is probably ungodly.  Danny found this amazing deal on Southwest...125 bucks for a plane ticket and two nights hotel. how could I say no? made plans to take off early Saturday morning and return very early Monday morning. then Danny accidentally got us on a plane at 8pm instead of 8am. then our plane was 40 minutes late...then they had to check the engine because they hit a couple of birds when they landed at Burbank, but the mechanic never came. thirty minutes later, they tell us we're on a new plane, but it has to be fueled up. I remember we took off eventually...  landed and met up with an ex named Joe (man, was that weird. I could never call out his name during sex.). I delivered an order he'd placed for some pizza topping and salad. he had moved here seven months ago and was now dating the bouncer at one of the local gay bars. kids, never go to a gay bar in Vegas, especially if you've ever been to a gay bar in a major city. they are capital TRAGIC. I felt kind of bad for Joe, and I'm also a bit confused because his boyfriend is not exactly what most people would consider attractive. but he's happy...can't begrudge that. I guess I just think he could do better if he wanted to.  crashed sometime around 4:20a and slept like the dead till noon. Danny and I got up and hit the strip in search of a good breakfast.   after packing down the griddle snacks at the Venitian, we continued down the strip from there and slipped inside a nearby casino every time we got a bit toasty. We managed to make it down to Bellagio, where there was bad juju in the air. I lost money  and  my sunglasses. that's downright mean! bussed it back up the strip on an SRO stinkmobile to the Riviera for a disco nap and then it was back on the strip for dinner and a bit of gaming.   ate at Denny's because well, I'm playing on a budget. then it was off to Treasure Island for a spell of blackjack. lost there too, but had a good time at the table nonetheless. I'll admit it, I looked for a gay boy and found one. the flirting was a nice bonus to the game, which went back and forth for quite some time. ultimately I ended up losing but I had quite a long run and it was fun. Danny & I made our way back up the strip and disco napped for two hours back at the hotel. we woke up at 4:30 to catch our ride to the airport.  We sank through low clouds to land at Burbank around 8am and drove back to my place. I crashed out for 6 hours...then did yard work until 6pm when I had to get ready for a date. not a very restful vacation, now that I think about it.  yeah, there's more...but I ain't tellin.  pictures. I want to play with the new ones...build myself a half-pint Eiffel Tower resting in the desert. can't sleep as usual, and the doctor says I need to come in for blood tests. let's hope the spikes in the last sample they got (I fell sick just before my weekend in Sin City) have disappeared. if they're still there, that's not good news...the optimist in me says "who cares? at least you have the family reunion in the desert over July 4th weekend coming. even if, buddha forbid, you're sick, you can at least have an escape to think and dance and sing and beat a drum under the black and star-filled sky of the mojave with your friends. Now  there's  a vacation."  cross your fingers, kids.

      a few weeks ago I was talking with Amy, the coolest girl in our senior class at Royal. we swapped words about the past, present and future...and came to the realization we have something very special, something not given to us by a person, but by this city. we talked about the Vibe.   the Vibe runs through the heart of the city. you cannot see it nor can you feel it out. the Vibe has to find you, and once that happens you always know exactly where it is. perhaps it is the spirit of her, La Puebla. whatever its origins, it is a connection that only the locals can feel. I know, I've tested this theory. it creates this special bond with the city that the thousands of transplants will never know. perhaps their children will find their way into its path, and then they'll change. call it prozac for the soul, if you will, but even that title doesn't properly explain the Vibe. it's just there, you know it is...but only the true Angeleno can see it.  everyone is writing.   those, at least, that feel it. why is she calling on us all to put our thoughts to paper? should I be nervous? can't say for sure...but I certainly know when the cosmos drops a hint my way. the Vibe explains why high school was such an enigma, a world without cliques where the jocks played in the band. the quarterback was in AP English. the wide reciever played saxophone. the goalie of the soccer team was in choir. the heshers...well, everyone thought the heshers were cool kids who just saw the world differently. it sure as hell wasn't the high school I had expected. I was raised on John Hughes, and thus grew to expect my own Breakfast Club moment. it never came. what did come, however, beat every estimation. I graduated high school  popular . what a fucking trip.   I want to put up "Locals Only" signs whenever I go out these days. I miss the uncongested roads and the hidden spots only locals used to know about. our sanctuaties...are vanishing. I feel put out for having to hunt for new hiding spots and hangouts in my backyard. is it xenophobia? not really...more like an acute sense of bitterness towards all these jerks who moved here thinking they knew what this town is about. all they're doing is destroying her. every day another mountain gets graded for a freshly cut loaf of townhouses along shiny black streets named Rolling Clover Drive. I'm sorry, but I'm tired of watching it happen. just how far will they take this urban sprawl thing before it begins to implode, and who says that isn't happening already? we've certainly got enough pressure from outside forces.  I was right about the revolution. it's still coming. now Bianka has patches on her backpack saying "I Protest." Jeff made them, and I really like the design...but I wonder just what this patch implies. it's only a matter of time before ther House Un-American Activities Committee starts making a list and checking it twice...

      july 4: On an island in the sun.  I've just spent the afternoon setting up camp on an extinct lakebed deep within the Mojave desert. the closest town, Hinkley, is about an hour away. it also had the last paved road we drove on.  that was hours ago, around four o'clock. this is our own space now. Andrew is spinning some mind-blowing psy underneath a blanket of stars. to quote old skool: he tore the roof off that shit and let it fly into the sky.  it's so hard to stop dancing, even when I know I need some water. there are wine bottles and beer bottles scattered around, waiting for the next thirsty reveller to pick them up for a moment. it's the best fucking family reunion I've ever been to.  Brian bought seventy dollars worth of fireworks and with a little help from a few of us, set off one mighty fine show just around midnight. we've drunk quite a bit, smoked a few bowls...everything's feeling good. I'm pretty wiped out though. it must be 2 or 3 am now, and having gotten little sleep the night before, I'm down for crawling into my tent and catching a few winks.  july 5: vanilla ice cream.  we're sitting in a booth at the Foster's Freeze in Barstow. this soft serve cone is pure heaven, as well as the bathroom. I can't beleive how much dirt I washed off my face and arms.  five of us snuck off during the hottest part of the day in the cool confines of Brian's RAV-4 for a bit of exporing. we found the only gay man in Barstow...he happened to be working the front desk at the ice factory where we stopped to reload.  on the way back to our camp, we took a detour to see these 3,000 petroglyphs painted on rocks about a mile away from the lakebed.  Dammit, I knew I should have brought my camera.   head back to camp and hide under the shade until sunset, when all of a sudden the wine gets broken out instead of the gatorade we've been drinking all day. start getting friendly with a visitor from New Jersey, a friend of a friend who's easy on the eyes and used to teach French lit. he offers to go on a star hike later...after the vicodin he shared with me kicks in. I play along, figuring that vicodin and a little booze is less dangerous than some of the other possible combinations available here. still can't keep away from the dance floor. I'm helpless to the pull of the sound, the tickle that spreads across the hair on my arms. here's a moment where it only makes sense to give in and let something else take over. sound doesn't just flow around, it flows inside. by morning, I've managed to sneak off to my tent with the Jersey boy for a bit of tom foolery, then it was back to watch the sun rise as Andrew times up Electric Skychurch on the firey ball's ascent into the morning sky. suddenly it was  july 6: dirty birdies.  pulled down our parachute/artist's representation of a mushroom/shade structure and started to pack up while it was still cool. picked up crap and tried not to overheat as the day got hotter. hopped into our cars by noon and left this unnamed claypatch just as we found it, save a few scuff marks. I'm exhausted, just like everyone else. I can't wait to spend an hour under the shower at home with a big bar of soap. kept nodding off in the back seat of Paul's truck as I listened to him and Bianka talking during the drive back to LB. They weren't boring, by any stretch....I was just too tired to do anything but lay back and breathe.

      Everybody knows what Feng Shui is these days. Thanks to a host of decorators, Hollywood starlets and how-to books, the term has become synonymous with hamonic settings in which the things around us influence our lives. One might first think the placement of a door or window in their home is inconsequential, but no. Open a Feng Shui book and you are enlightened by the words of ancient China, when homes and towns were built around the orientation of the stars. You learn about Chi, the energy that flows through everything, and how even the Chi of your kitchen has an impact on the course your life takes.  At first you think it's mumbo jumbo, some hokey crap ancient Chinese decorators came up with to increase business for themselves. You dismiss it as a fad...but then you begin to wonder things like "will the direction my front door faces really affect how happy I am at work?" or "Does that wide window next to my refrigerator cause all my money to fly right out of my hands?" Suddenly you're questioning the placement of every single item in your house, wondering if a bit of rearranging might fix all those problems you have with your boss.   And while there just might be a sliver of truth to that decorator theory, the fact remains that Feng Shui has become both a science and an art for many who percieve our environment as an entity that affects our daily lives. But what is Funk Shui? Quite simply, it is the combination of organic attitudes about interior design with a style that beckons one to groove. It is a harmony of environment and experience that transcends good style and spirituality at the same time, leaving one in a place where the possibilities for a good time are endless.  Funk Shui draws from the roots of ther retro modern style that permeated the sixties and seventies in art, design, architecture and of course, music. When blended with The ancient Chinese art of placement and harmony, you find yourself within a realm of style, subtance and swank. In other words, you don't just see the groove, you  feel it .  but Funk Shui is more than just a snazzy room to entertain in. It is a lifestyle moves on the idea that life should be rich, colorful and fun. Cocktail hour isn't an occasion, it is a ritual that removes us from the stress of life and places us in harmony with our surroundings, providing the balance of relaxation we all require to make it through the week without landing ourselves with an ulcer.

      "Three in three days." I looked up from my iced tea. "three what?" "you know, three different guys in three days. that was my weekend, in a nutshell." "you're kidding." "nope..." "dude, that's just wrong. and stop grinning like that. it makes me feel dirty." I could only hold his gaze for about three seconds before I looked away and laughed.   wow, he's been a busy bunny rabbit. I'm not going to embarass anyone and name names. he knows I'm strangely impressed by the whole thing because my slut phase never really ever happened...I just had a short spurt every now and then. though lately, I'm beginning to wonder if that might be changing. can't say how...or when...or why.  long weekend from my end, too. two parties, practice (while hungover) with the boys, another party and a movie with the birthday girl...too much. slow down, I think I want to get off. about now all I can handle is some toon tv. tomorrow, back to the treadmills and the job hunt. rather carefree living, I suppose. I'm reading the Tao of Physics in the hope of coming up with ideas for a promise I made to Bianka. there's a snowball's chance in hell that it could actually happen, but it never hurts to try. ;)  the fortune cookies are broken. decided to treat mom to chinese dinner and we both got the same fortune about an inheritance. sure would be nice if that were true, but you know I'm not holding my breath. life has a funny way of reminding us what we don't have...regularly. no, it's not a square deal, but what other deal is there? if anything, it keeps us focused on our dreams.   and island off the coast of Western Australia is for sale. for a modest fee, one could build their own paradise, perhaps soverign. friends always welcome, enemies would never know where to find us. solar power, of course...desalination for water, a little satellite communications and we're good to go. and you're an hour from Sydney by boat. sounds  like a fine arrangement to me...

      I've had a rough patch.  last week the boss gave me bad news...money was mad short and I was getting laid off.  I guess it beats getting fired. I celebrated the only way I know how, which means over the past seven days I've consumed more alcohol than I want to think about. I didn't go over the edge once, I just felt more frivolous I suppose. I went and got my very first tattoo. after years of agonizing over this design and that, I settled for a simple image that bound me to Gaia. in my mind, I kept saying to myself "it's about time." it's no lie that I feel more connected now. couldn't tell you why, but I do. I figure it's my own knowledge of what the image symbolizes that gives it strength. it is the result and simple truth of the power we wield, the same force that makes this great big clock tick.  I keep dreaming of far-off places I fear I'll never see.  visions of cities and places far and wide fill my head and tickle my itch to wander...I can't shake this feeling of restlessness that's calling me away from the city. is She pushing me away for a reason? if only I had the means to listen to her urgings and journey off somewhere distant, quiet...    went on a spiritual journey (with the aid of shroom) on Saturday in the wee hours of the morning. I sat on the balcony of my new friend Johnnie's apartment and stared quietly at the moon, the trees and the few visible stars for what felt like ages. my thoughts crept through the night sky towards a glowing purple horizon in which the lights of the city appeared to float.   Johnnie's sister Mil broke the silence: "Is that Mars, or a peach?"    the question made us burst into fits of laughter, and I never really regained my focus after that. their cat, Gracie, jumped onto a table and proceded with great flare to stage a flagrant attempt to get someone's, anyone's affection. I succumbed almost as enthusiastically as she did when I began petting her. after five minutes she was spent, and the three of us scurried into the living room to watch weird movies.   now it's Thursday, money's tight and the only place I think I can escape to is San Francisco. dissapointing, yes, but I've got a plan...

      Things had been quiet for too long, I suppose. With all the brouhaha over the recall of the Governor of California, that whole war business manged to fade from the spotlight for a spell. The president's approval numbers are on a freefall and there's little doubt that he won't get another four years. At any rate, I suspect the revolution will hit before we even get to vote on the matter...and Bianka and I figured out where it's going to happen: right here.  It's only a matter of time before the Golden State decides that it has had enough hassle. We both see the cracks forming in the law books...but neither of us can tell when our borders will begin to do the same. The people who are moving in and out of here, they sense it too.  Those that are sticking around have a very different mentality about the shape of things around us.  Speaking of different mentalities, I came across an old deck of tarot cards while collecting things for a yard sale. Went through a bunch of memories, most dating back to my more innocent and subdued days as a boy scout and disney memorabilia nut. Thank goodness people people change, eh? I set the old deck next to the one I'd been using for the past few years and thought I'd put them to the test. The interesting thing was that the two spreads read like a Choose Your Own Adventure story...If you choose this path...turn to page 32.  Life has turned around slowly, and I don't think it's quite finished yet, which is good. I've decided to make my yearly pilgrimage to the bay area soon so that I can focus on things other than what's down here...it's still a bit much.

      one week later and where do I stand? it's hard to answer that question without sounding like I'm bitching about my life. short stories are always best in cases like these, so I'll do my best...  Monday found me doing two things: putting my car in the shop and asking one of my best friends to loan me money. both events preety much brought me to tears. one because of my angst over what felt like a nasty bout of bad luck, the other because asking others for help has always been one of the hardest things for me to do. while I'm exceptionally fortunate to have friends who can do that sort of thing, I still feel like shit when I find myself having to ask for that kind of help. this week I dropped a good 550 dollars into my car, only to have it crap out on me again Friday night. over thae past two days, I've been on the verge of a full-on cry fest more times than I'd care to admit.   so where do I stand on this Saturday night? I've mixed myself a nice strong concotion of vodka and gatorade in the hopes of calming my nerves. I look at my car with fear, wondering if the alternator I've replaced twice will hold out. thankfully, the week hasn't been a total bust. Tuesday night felt like a rescue mission...Bianka came to my house for the first time  ever  and whisked me off to Long Beach for a rockin' good time with my favorite crew. she gave me a helping hand in more ways than one that night, showing just how great a friend she truly is. there are two types of family: the one we're given and the one we choose for ourselves. the one I was given has always been a chaotic mix of good and bad, one I'm tied to with reluctance and with love. the family I've chosen on the other hand, has never ceased to amaze me. I feel lucky and guilty at the same time. I call that family Ohana, the people so close to my heart that I couldn't imagine life without them. hell, without them I'd be so fucked that hookers would stare in awe.

      arrg, got dumped. had a feeling this was coming. could someone  please  remind me why I keep trying to date Geminis? this one thinks he found his One True Love in the apartment above his (I know, I'm trying not to laugh), and has decided he simply can't pass this opportunity up. well, good luck, ya bastard. about the only thing I feel like doing now is writing off the day and smoking a bowl...or three.   I Am A:  Chaotic Good Elf Ranger Mage  Alignment:  Chaotic Good  characters are independent types with a strong belief in the value of goodness. They have little use for governments and other forces of order, and will generally do their own things, without heed to such groups.  Race:  Elves  are the eldest of all races, although they are generally a bit smaller than humans. They are generally well-cultured, artistic, easy-going, and because of their long lives, unconcerned with day-to-day activities that other races frequently concern themselves with. Elves are, effectively, immortal, although they can be killed. After a thousand years or so, they simply pass on to the next plane of existance.  Primary Class:  Rangers  are the defenders of nature and the elements. They are in tune with the Earth, and work to keep it safe and healthy.  Secondary Class:  Mages  harness the magical energies for their own use. Spells, spell books, and long hours in the library are their loves. While often not physically strong, their mental talents can make up for this.  Deity:  Solonor Thelandria  is the Chaotic Good elven god of archery and the hunt. He is also known as the Keen Eye, the Great Archer, and the Forest Hunter. His followers respect nature, and only hunt when needed, but are quick to defend the forest from intruders. Their favorite weapon is the bow, and they tend to be extremely talented with it. Solonor Thelandria's symbol is an arrow with green fletchings.

      there's nothing more upsetting than waking up to a particularly nasty horoscope in your inbox:     "Your luck finally runs out. Think twice before going against common sense. If you're caught in the act of wrongdoing, this time the accusation will stick."  the extended version wasn't much better:    "There's sudden change and a wave of what could be excuses or explanations. Any kind of big shakeup serves as a loyalty test. Do you even know the person who claims to be your new best friend? Try to get your bearings in a familiar room that was just redecorated or repurposed. Were you consulted about this? Maybe someone asked and you forgot about it. Don't let your mood run away with you. Avoid trivializing or lashing out at people that aren't directly related to your problem. You need their help more than you need their anger."  I'm a bit unsettled because I'm having lunch with Johnnie today...to talk. a great confusing mess erupted not long after I professed to myself just how much I really liked the guy. all day Friday I couldn't shake this horrible sensation that karma was kicking me around...I sure wish I knew why. I'm prepping myself for come what may, but I'm just sick over the fact that the stars are convinced this is going to be one bad day for Joe Sullivan. after reading those two predictions, I couldn't help my thirst for more details...could you? I looked up my romance horoscope, and its outlook was equally grim: "Your feelings for someone you had been close to may suddenly change on Sunday, but you may not know how to end it gracefully. Angry outbursts will do the trick, but you're bound to say something you'll regret. Rather than cutting things off abruptly, ask for some time to think things over."  at least I know one thing going into this, my feelings for Johnnie have changed. I dig him more than ever. I figure that's got to be worth something...at the very least it makes me think hope isn't completely lost. it's also a good thing that my Astrologer plans ahead...next week's outlook has a ray of promise, but if the stars hold any truth to them it would seem I'll have to beg this guy to stay with me. I'm going batty trying figure out what he wants to talk about...I'm not even certain it's about me.   ugh. If I'm not neurotic by the end of the day it will be a miracle...well, maybe not a miracle. I'm lucky. I have a pretty reational head on my shoulders most of the time. it hasn't come easy for me, a person whose emotions run like a powerful undercurrent just below the surface of my eyes. I've learned to watch the reactions of my heart before letting them loose. but I'll be the first to admit that this could blow up in our faces if we're not careful. nobody likes losing in the name of love, but it certainly isn't worth breaking someone's heart to prevent it. if those were your choices, what would you do? I've had my heart broken plenty of times...enough to never be able to take pride in doing it to someone else. there's no dignity in that for me, a guy who wears his heart just beneath his jacket. you could say it's there on my sleeve, but with a little protection. sometimes I need a little shielding from the elements...  I woke up really early this morning, which means I'm nervous. I'm also a bit surprised that I'm not hungover, given that one of my teammates served me a rediculous amount of tequila last night. One of the guys is moving to Washington D.C. next week and he made it his goal to get as many of his friends drunk as possible. I had to hang out at our team captain's place for about an hour before I felt okay to drive. I really don't remember drinking much water that night, but here it is...10 in the morning and I've been up for nearly two hours. I'm tense, but even that hasn't given me a headache this morning.   putting thoughts into words helps. there's a device in the Harry Potter books called a Pensieve, which allows its user to pull thoughts out of their head and place them in a bowl. that's the kind of item I would find extremely useful...if it actually existed. Bhuddists spend a great deal of time learning how to empty thoughts from their mind in order to see things clearly.  it is a skill that is much easier to describe than to actually do, requiring a strong, quiet mind that understands how to let go of something and find it again later when it is truly needed. I could use an empty head right now, going into what I imagine to be a real test of how I feel about this guy. right now, I feel he's worth fighting for. I hope that by the end of this afternoon Johnnie feels the same way about me.  whatever the outcome, it's good to know I can depend on the rational side of my soul to kick in when I need it. I'm just really wishing I didn't need it today.

      I don't know whether to cry or laugh.  after a month of lackluster job searches and little misfortunes, I needed an escape from a city that was showing me no mercy on any front. Johnnie and Mil were planning a trip to Kings Canyon with some friends of theirs and invited me along, so of course I said yes. it had been years since I'd seen the giant Sequoia trees that litter the mountains there, and going with johnnie could only improve the scenery. I've grown remarkably fond of the guy since we started dating a month ago...his wit and charm just keep impressing me. Mil's a riot too, and all weekend long she was cracking wise right along with us.  when combined with copius amounts of food, drink and weed the trip seemed fool-proof. of course it wasn't, but we had ourselves quite a blast as we hiked to the many waterfalls that fed into the Kings river.  all weekend long I felt as though someone was giving my spirit an enema, cleaning it of all the crap that had been accumulating over the past few months. when I waded into the frigid waters of the river, I felt at home instead of frozen. perhaps it was my inner Buddha, but I just felt so comfortable floating in the current of liquid snow while everyone else in our little troop waded up to their knees before hopping back onto the shore. I felt the energy of the water moving all around me, and then suddenly I saw it everywhere. it was like someone had switched on the proverbial light bulb and suddenly I saw everything differently. and yes, I was sober...I just knew that Gaia was watching me, is all.  Of course, the city had to wrap her bruised and sore-ridden arms around me when we got back...as soon I stepped out of the Ford Escape Johnnie had rented, I noticed my car stereo had been jacked while we were off revelling in the wonders of nature. for someone who prizes music as much as I do, it felt like a slap in the face from a lover. Mercury's gone retrograde, welcome the fuck home.    I had hoped to get some private time in the woods with Johnnie for a bit of tom foolery, but the reality was that the only private time we had was when we passed out from exhaustion in my tent.  as a veteran camper, I should have expected that to happen, but having never gone camping with someone I actually could have done the deed with I was a bit naive. but it wasn't the dissapointment I thought it would be...in fact, it was one of the best camping trips I'd ever taken, and I came back from the weekend even more twitterpated than I was going in. though I'm at a loss to explain that, I have a hunch it's because the guy rocks my world.   I should descibe this guy I'm describing...curly brown hair, blue eyes and a mischevous grin that rivals my own. he's not a Greek god body-wise, and I'm glad. To me he's so cute I just want to rip his clothes off and, well, you know. he works in the biz, and loves the retro-modern style of the sixties as much as I do. I sure wish I had his travel budget...he's been all over Europe and shows no signs of slowing. I'm always jealous of folks with that kind of opportunity, since I always seem to travel by luck. best of all, Johnnie came along right when the shit hit the fan. having someone like him around sure makes everything else less taxing.  A word to the wise: if you need an SUV for the weekend, do *not* get a Ford Escape. the damn things are so far from a real SUV it's laughable.. No four-wheel drive, fucked up roof racks and zero trunk space make packing for a weekend in the mountains feel like a game of Tetris.

      so it would appear I got an answer to the question posed on the 20th. it may not be a giant crack in the shell of the earth, but it's a start, right? maybe she's doing the L.A. thing and going bulemic on our asses, purging all the fatty crap she's been taking in over the past couple of years.  run yuppies, run...  it's going to be a harsh winter. the rainy season will be a neverenving onslaught of mudslides and floods...I know, because I went through this twelve years ago when a fire came within a few hundred feet of my own house. the only thing standing in its way was the road that separated us from the hills across from the one our house sat on. the memory had been lost to me until these past few days brought it back. I remember getting evacuated, scanning my room for my most valuable treasures to toss into the black garbage bag my mom had just handed me.  do I take my Young Astronauts stuff, or my Disney pin collection? which pants do I really, really like? (yes, even at 14 I was ignoring the signs. in retrospect, I was a pretty dumb kid)  we hurried across town to the my friend Jason's house, where his family quickly turned on the news and handed us each a bowl of matzo ball soup. Jason kept my brothers and I distracted with video games in his room while my mom and dad quietly freaked out downstairs like adults tend to do. they watched as the fire burned straight down to the road...and was stopped. we heard cheers upstairs. my older brother's reaction was: "well Joe, it looks like your room burned first."   at the time it really pissed me off, but what's really pathetic is that my house was actually on the corner furthest from the fire...and therefore the least likely to get destroyed (see above parenthetical reference). but tonight I'm sitting at a distance, watching the fires destroy home after home.  the golden lady of the west sure is pissed off these days. one can only wonder what's gone and baked her noodle.

      I used to joke with my friends that this town was the Hellmouth so oft spoken of in that great television series of our time, Buffy The Vampire Slayer.  strangely, this is no longer far from the truth today, as fire courses around the city's eastern borders in a near mechanical precision. our border with Los Angeles has been blackened and is now trying to creep into the hills of Chatsoworth. seventy foot-tall flames have been dancing around our edges for the past two days...the sounds of C-130's and choppers have filled my ears since daybreak. a friend who lives in the knolls is now safely stowed away with her mother while the fire rages just down the hill from her house. And it's all happening so close to Hallow's Eve...how fucked up is that?  The local networks already have catchy dramatic music pasted over montages of fire footage that they're running as commercials...how fucked up is  that ?  we already know most of the fires were arson. the question is, who'd start them? my mind could cook up a thousand conspiracy theories with just the upcoming holiday as a starting point, but in a sick way it's fun to occupy my mind with a more prepopsterous alibi, which is why I'm all about the Hellmouth theory. yeah, that's right. demons are about to spring up in Simi, and lucky me...there's a graveyard within spitting distance of my house. maybe I'll blow off my halloween plans to sit in the graveyard with a faggot of sharpened stakes by my side instead. yeah...that's the ticket.

      a month gone by and more cracks at the seams. the Feds have begun an assault against the Golden State, with Republican assholes from every corner of the backwoods stepping in to introduce bill after bill in congress. the goal of each is simple: to reverse the forward direction of the state. we want cleaner air standards here than the ones on the national lawbooks, but Detroit's having none of it.  we think there's a time and a place where it's not such a bad idea to prescribe a little mary jane to a cancer patient of a PWA, yet the drug czar targets us more than any other state for pot busts. we think giving everyone here a decent shot and turning their life around sounds fair, but when you're talking about the fifth largest economy in the world...well, let's just say that it really pisses people off that we have more rules and regulations about getting a piece of it.   they don't like the way we do things here in California....THEY like to think that THEY have more control over things here, but we keep coming back with another slap in the face to prove them wrong. THEY aren't too fond of us doing that, but they're too stupid to get it through their thick, leathery pocketbooks that we don't give a flying fuck what THEY want this state to be. this is not their crop to raid, this is not their spoil for the taking. THEY just don't get that the one thing we prize more than anything else is the spirit of freedom and the right to do your Own Thing. and though you might have a spot of trouble tracking down a Wiccan on the street, you most certainly could find someone to echo their credo: if it hurts no person, do what you will.  so now it comes to this...will the San Andreas sever California from the nation, or will its people?

      cheers to the girl who's practical enough to give a guy a gift she knows he'll use. it's espescially frugal when she also happens to be the local purveyor to begin with, but there's more to it than that. after all, we've known each other since (our now extinct) junior high.  yeah, I know I'm being vague. besides, there's more exciting things afoot than the love I have for heather. I've been contacted by a most fascinating fellow...his emails go so far beyond mere banter that I'm beside myself after each one. it's like drinking an Irish Car Bomb.  I'm already detecting an unusually high number of similarities that suggest he's match-worthy. certainly he's friend worthy (and quite fuck-worthy...), because the guy is funny and damn clever. this guy's definately one of those folks I'm meant to cross paths with, I'm just not sure to what extent. cross your fingers, kiddies...

      nobody else shows up. ah. it's okay. I think it's a sign. if necessary, I can fall off the face of the earth for awhile and be assured my freinds would know what I'd be up to. it's tempting...I've hit the floor a few times, but the dj still hasn't played any Weezer. or Green Day. what the hell kind of "alternative night" is this supposed to be? what kind of birthday is this supposed to be?  bless Dan for being my sole acceptor of an invitation to come out and celebrate the big 27. everyone else must have gotten the invite on too short a notice. yeah, that's got to be what happened. so here I am, sipping an overpriced beer and grumbling about how there's no Weezer to cheer me up. I'm starting to feel pathetic enough to tell the dj I want to hear a song because it's my goddamn birthday. one more beer should do it...

      I'd watch the movie. really, I would...but I won't because it's Starring Ben Affleck. I can't help it. please send my apologies to the producers, the director (whose work I am a fan of), the DP and the editor. but the casting director...I think the two of us need to have a talk. I'd rather watch that forgotten stab at animation that Fox took, Anastasia, before tuning in to what looks like a really cool fucking movie Starring Ben Affleck. I just can't do it. I'm sorry.   all around me I'm seeing the signs of a life that feels diluted by one too many films Starring Ben Affleck. by the streams of lies that pour out of our mouths. by the cowards that most of us have become as a result of listening too much and not asking enough of the right questions in response to what we hear. I mean, the signs are out there. we live in a world where more and more young adults are turning away from the television as our parents knew it in favor of cartoons and comic books. why? we're tired and bored of the shit they've been serving on the very media outlets that raised us as children of the eighties and nineties (and by that I mean both decades sucessively, not either, because the children of the nineties are a far more troubled breed). mtv, the entertainment machine that has risen due to our unyielding loyalty as youths, bears no resemblance to the creature it once was.   I have no clue where to begin on this example alone, so bear with me as I wing it. it all started with Remote Control, or at least it did in my movie.   when The Real World  landed on that channel, god was dead and we loved it.  the heathens raced along a downward spiral that took Nine Inch Nails with it (now relegated to M|2, Rezonr's awesome audiovisual creations are pretty much a memory of pop culture). music's sanctity on mtv had been tarnished, and we liked the taste. the cost, of course, was that things rolled down a hill that became too steep.  now we're left with a music channel that only eludes to music, but hey. at least we've still got our mtv, right?  the Disney channel is really just gross. once, it had cool toons mixed with strangely addictive shows like Mousercise and the Mickey Mouse Club. hey, back then we thought exposÃ© was a cool band and britney was in bad musical numbers with big hair. every time I think about where's she's come to now, I can't help but laugh because she was *always* a Madonna-be.    so we're watching cartoons, and softening the blows with an appreciation of the Eames sunburst clock that hangs in marge simpson's kitchen and the words that are spoken in it. we've given up on the news because it's not reliable. we've begun to question not only television, but the newspaper and even the internet. Even the media themselves are touting this as the Year of The Liar, and you know something? it's completely true. dare we think about where this may lead us? I never thought I would see such ironic parallels between the media and culture as a whole, but here they are, coming at my eyes and ears in blistering waves.  trust has become declassé. the people are slowly destroying themselves through the gentle, erotically delicious sucking of their wallets by about seven percent of the country. greed has fueled a treacherous race to climb up above everyone around us, one that has destroyed millions more than it has granted such a glorious victory.   what are we seeing? it is, quite simply, the end result of corporate feudalism. and sooner or later, the people will either need to wake up to the truth or let themselves be destroyed by it. our greed is our greatest weakness as a race of humans. want to save money at every turn? get more bang for your buck, more STUFF to fill up every room of your apartment or house with? well then spend, spend away at all those companies that buy nearly every item under their roof from a country that's paying its workers twenty dollars a week to make them. say goodbye to your domestic production jobs, and laugh away the afternoon as this nation erodes into one nearly completely employed in the service industry. every product will be outsourced, everyone will buy and sell but nobody will make except the kitchen staff, and even that could soon be replaced with machinery. there's one simple problem with this grand, simple plan to make our lives easier: it's human costs are extremely expensive.  go ahead, sit back. turn off the television and open the window. watch for a minute. think to yourself, "there's no class system in America! everyone has the same chance!"  go ahead. I dare you.  think the WTO is a good idea? yeah, it's fabulous if you want to committ mass genocide with economics as your weapon. I don't feel particularly sunny when I walk into wal-mart and think about how many lives those clothes cost. or that can of tuna. or that pair of shoes. yeah, I'm not having any fucking part of that. you won't see me helping the economy by shoping in a place where I'd probably be of more help if I shoplifted from it.   there's no hope for the next generation if this keeps up. just you watch, bitches. Miss America is a thing of the past, it's American Idol, baby. World Idol's only the next big thing...well I'm over it.  I'd rather play outdoors anyway. it's time to take a dip in the ocean and go for a swim. and you all best start swimming too, before someone decides to open a drain underneath you.  bam bam bam goes the beat of our culture.  bang bang bang go our guns. clang clang clang go the registers at wal-mart. clap clap clap go the idiots for their chief. pop pop pop go our minds and our souls.  don't mind me. I'm just a backass mad hatter...

      my world is in the middle of a complete upheaval, but this time it's by my own doing and it's the kind of upheaval that makes one's life a little brighter. in a month or less, I'll finally escape the town that has held me hostage for the past three years and taken my life through a transformation that, in the long run, was probably for the best.  granted, at times it sucked raw, bloody ass, but there have also been some incredibly bright points. I've found my family in the City. I know I can stay here if I want to, and never be lonely as long as I live here. while I may never establish one single place with a roof and walls as my one true home, there's no doubt where that home will be. I can leave and come back at any time now, which is definitely something I have to do. give me a good year to pick up a few broken parts and spackle them back together and we're in business. I even think I know where I want to go, and who I want to become...  I'll never leave the grasp of Los Angeles completely. if anything right now, I'm only compelled to bring myself closer to the heart of the Dream Factory for awhile.  in the process of helping my mom get back home, I've realized where my home is too. I am the first generation Angeleno. this place is what I am, where I came from and who I will always be.  so what if the search for intelligent life here is endless? lately, I've been plucking more than the usual number of gems.  his name is Cargan...odd name, right? I thought so, but it's kind of grown on me.   quite a bit, actually.   okay, I'm twitterpated.  seriously, even innocent thoughts about him get me a little stiff. he could very well be the Yin. I'm completely stupid around him, and there are so many stupid reasons why this is the case. I can't explain it. all I can do it go with it...

      about 5 months ago, my boyfriend and I made a command decision: we would make porn. not just any porn, but porn with class. porn with stly. porn that *gasp* might actually be considered cool. I've always had weird issues when it came to porn (more on that in a bit), but he was so excited about it and it did sound like a somewhat revolutionary idea...so as we drove home from San Francisco (his first trip), I said "what the hell. let's make porn."  not too sure how I feel about that decision now, to be honest. we certainly made good on our idea. the site launches this week. it's been a really tough few months leading up to this, what with all the work and time and money we've invested. I myself have been busy the past few weeks with ad designs, image building, t-shirts and more. and while there's a certain thrill to what we're doing, I can't help feeling weird about it at the same time. when models come over I'm queasy and hide in the bedroom under the guise of having work to do. had to pop a xanax today to calm my nerves, and this is after sneaking the bong in here to have a private tokefest.   what the fuck is going on? have I snapped? I didn't feel like this before. well, not much. I should say instead that I was dealing with this better...  I've always had issues with porn. for starters, I'm not comfortable with it unless I'm alone. it's like a dirty secret that's all mine, and having other people involved only renders the whole experience repugnant. I wish I could say why...but in truth, nothing comes to mind but ancient memories of me hiding pages from the Sears catalogue under my pillow. hardly seems like the emotional fodder worthy of such a complex, no? the upswing is that this state of mind makes me the perfect cameraman, since I have never once gotten hard (much less aroused) during a shoot.   I don't know what to do. we've invested so much in this idea, and now I'm starting to hate it...there's no way I can put a stop to this beast now that we've gone and built it from the ground up. there's just too much invested. there's no way to say "I don't want to do this anymore" without looking like a complete asshole, so I'll just grit my teeth, dig in my heels and run over to Sav-On to get that xanax prescription refilled...

      The latest reports show that by 2006, California will have a "strucured defecit" of about 8 billion dollars. That's a huge number, especially considering that the state currently has no way to recover the money even if things go well between now and then. Essentially, the figure is an  optimistic  outlook at the disparity between the programs people want and the money they're willing to spend on them. Not very pretty, if you ask me.  So where do we collectively dig up 8 billion dollars? All the traditional sources of revenue are, essentially, tapped out with no more grow room to make up the difference and keep up with inflation at the same time. In essense, we have to come up with new ways to make money or else we're doomed to an ongoing battle over what resources we actually do have in the treasury. But if we really want to solidify our commitment to providing a better life for people in California, there's one solution that nobody has yet to offer: regulation of that outlaw plant we keep fighting with the DEA over.  Legalizing and regulating marijuana use could, theoretically, provide as much income to the state as cigarette or alcohol taxes annually bring in (currently $115m for cigarettes and $294m for alcohol) and contribute substantially to reducing the stagnant debt load. Even if marijuana remained legal for medicinal use only, revenue generated from licensing and taxation could still provide a crucial boost to the state's income. And here is where the boys and girls in Sacramento have really dropped the ball.  With a little foresight, California's treatment of the marijuana factor could be a serious business for the state. Imagine a state-run farming co-operative to control the distribution. Imagine an arrangement with the DEA that stops them from raiding people's homes while granting them the authority to deal with anyone who tries to get out of the state with a fat sack of weed. Imagine a sate bureaucracy that issues permits for the sale and growth of marijuana, so that operations out of our control would still be under watch. And with some careful planning, it would all be, at least technically, legal.  Every time the DEA trots into someone's backyard in San Francisco to destroy 6 measly plants, they claim that they're only doing their job of enforcing a federal law. This is where the grey area begins: said law only applies (or should apply, technically) to inter-state trade. Though it happens quite often, the Feddies can't simply break down your door and destroy the lone pot plant growing in your backyard for your own personal use. The laws just don't support their claims of jurisdiction because nobody's shipping that pot to Arizona, are they? So make John ASScroft's boys in blue a deal: they can have the airports, borders and bus terminals to do whatever they damn well please in the "war on drugs," but leave the rest to the state for regulation.   Want a real boost to your income, Arnold? Do what England is doing now (and what the Netherlands has been doing for years). Instead of spending billions to fight against a drug that has been clinically proven to be less harmfull and  less addictive  than both alcohol and cigarettes, put it in the same class and tax the bloody hell out of it. Sell it in a state licensed shop or café, and kindly instruct the proprietors to cut their patrons off when they've had too much. Police costs will go down and revenues will go up. Plus, you'll have the added benefit of clearing out all those prison cells being used by pot smokers who got caught.   Of course there are woes about trafficking, which is why the DEA should focus their energy on beefing up border and airport security instead of bullying AIDS and cancer patients. Hell, give them a piece of the pot tax pie to cover some of the costs of inspecting everyone's trunk when they drive into Arizona or Nevada or Oregon. Give them a few tools to do that job with, and make it clear what their place is and what it is not.  Put an even bigger piece of that pie into educating the public on marijuana's proven effects and consequences instead of the same old lies Hearst was printing to support the timber industry in the early part of the 20th century. Talk about its benefits, but make clear its known side effects, too. Just stop with the half-truths already because anyone with a brain can go online and find plenty of factual information for themselves. There's just no sense in making foolish ads to scare people for the wrong reasons. Make no mistake, it's a drug that has both users and abusers, and abuse of any substance should be discouraged with the same tenacity and tact that we use to discourage kids from smoking cigarettes.  It may be a pipe dream, but it's also a workable solution in a better world where our nation isn't under the iron grip of a radical and narrow-minded conservative government.
