      okee...figured use the classic starting point: interstellar cold war. not yet risen to the battlefield yet (but you know it won't be long). The sides are basically staring at each other while amassing their forces. Side one- well humans gotta appear somewhere or it gets just a li'l too alien. They accidentally sparked this situation during their early explorations. though that was going on two hundred years ago, their enemies aren't quite so short lived as them, and not known for forgiving natures. They're quite the large government as well- humans have only recently (in comparison to the other races present in space) begun to explore. they have a mere two, three hundred planets to their domain with roughly 25% not actually habital, just being used as refineries. they don't count worlds they can't populate OR use in any way (gaseous giants and the like- blue star systems especially. that's begging for a radiation bath). on the other hand- you have the people who's toes they stepped on early by having settled a mining colony in an area that was under dispute. The humans naturally didn't know that the area was already claimed-but by their logic, as it was closer to any of their systems than it was any of the others' systems and they settled it first- it's their's.   the political situation is thus: We have two powerful governments long established in space who didn't realize a race new to space was coming in from an area previously ignored by them (simply cuz it was too remote to be worth the pursual when there were richer planets and systems within easy reach). One is a 'democracy' style, the other is totalitarian.  they had been at sort of a truce/peace agreement stage when humans blundered into things and dropped a match on the powder keg.  On one hand- the humans will have to eventually pick a side if theywant to survive...that's the thinking of both governments. Which is great to them..cuz it means that they can likely annex the systems the humans have already developed into their own governmental reach and thus gain a major territory leap with minimal effort. -naturally neither government wants the other one to gain that advantage.  On the other hand....you know how contrary human nature can be. we might know what we SHOULD do...but that and what we /do/ decide to do tend to be two very different things. They're well aware that if they side with /either/ government- they're losing their independance. they'll be completely swallowed up by such massive groups (a fate that's already befell a few races who've been drawn entirely into either government).  that's as far as I've gotten with it.  (amendment past this point) The 'democratic' government is more of a communistic/socialistic one now. to play on differences between the various species.  Also we have determined that the human government is working on its defenses in hopes of keeping both governments at bay if it can just entrench itself well enough. To keep the other two governments at bay, they've sent a representative (IE: sacraficial lamb)to provide a smoke screen. This guy's only job is to be as wishywashy and undecisive as possible- yet not bullyable into agreeing to urge humans to join either side.  On top of it- humans are trying to build better weapons as close to the potential battlefield as possible.  The socialists are a very non-humanoid species (not sure what they really look like at this point) but they use a projector to create an image to set whatever race they're speaking to at ease in their presence (such as a humanesque one when dealing with humans).  And lastly at this point:  an assassin of sorts from one of the two major governments has attacked a human vessel in hopes of forcing them to finally make up their mind for whom they would join. With the stakes being upped- this means the human rep is now starting to meet stronger figures than some low level diplomats- ones who may be able to try to force his hand (and as such reveal the farce....as he has no power to really make a descions such as that on his own, despite what the governments were lead to believe. All he can do is recommend a course of action).

      I swear I'm going to hurt someone soon. My boss keeps hiring teenagers and old women- the teenagers are too busy going "oh la la~!" over the various guys to walk into the store, and the old women can't figure out how to run a register if their lives depended on it.  How on earth do they expect me to do my job when I'm apparently now part of a day care/elderly care service instead of a cashier? Call me impatient- but I spend more time fixing my fellow workers' mistakes now than I do making sure my work's done.  You'd think at the very least I'd get a raise for all this, but no- the only 'rewards' I get for this is a migraine, a developing ulcer, and enough stress in what most think is an easy going life to turn my hair gray. And if their job isn't done right- I'm the one who gets put down for it.  What. Are. They. ON?!  And lets not forget the "oh I don't feel like going in- I'll just call in. I know they can get her to work." attitude.  I flat out unplug my phone on my days off now....honestly people...

      Yes, I'm still on a ToD kick...but bear with me here while I shamelessly rip off some of it's backstory and try to make up something useful. Kinda stealing from CT's Zeal timeline too.  Yes I know we don't need another story but meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh on us. ^_^v  --okay, here we go--  As people advance in anything- you know they will always lord it over even other members of their own race who haven't made the same advancements. In this case- we have two peoples who followed two different paths: some chose to follow the new path of science, others chose to follow the old path of magic.  Those who chose to embrace science thought the world too filthy and dangerous to genuinely live upon. Every day new illnesses and diseases were being born to try to destroy mankind- things magic couldn't defeat because it was nature itself causing them. While magic could heal things like injuries and wounds- it wouldn't heal an illness created naturally.  Magic would not allow for the corruption of a natural cycle, as it was a part of it.  So they built cities, carved from the stone of the mountains from around the world and in turn gathered those among them who had the talent for magic. These people were then imprisoned and forced to unite their wills to keep the cities afloat. One might think they could simply will the cities to fall, but they were imprisoned within cryo chambers. Unable to awaken and realize the reality of the situation, they could only exist within a false dream-world, shared with other prisoners, unaware of their actual situation for the most part. (Yes, matrixy I know. deal. =P If it makes you feel better, I didn't realize that until AFTER I typed it.)  On the world below, it was no secret to the cultures that had chosen to stay upon the earth how these great flying cities were powered- but knowing and being able to do something about it are two different things. There were also those priests who followed only the power of Fate rather than nature, science or any divine being, who insisted that things must be allowed to see their way through.  So this has gone on for many decades, maybe even centuries. The cities are largely self reliant and generally stay well above the clouds- visible only as silhouttes. But fate is dealing it's own punishment out to them. Magic is a hereditary trait..and by imprisoning those who's blood carried such traits early on, they had quite nicely stolen it from themselves. Though they are working ona way of keeping themselves aloft without magic- they are aware that for now- they need it.  And thier fuel sources are dying. Science is not exact...there will be malfunctions, and while early on, losing one or two was not a problem...the day a city fell made them realize the fatal flaw in their logic. Lose too many..and the cities cannot remain in flight.  Until they can find another way of keeping in flight in their manmade paradises, however- they have to continue to rely on these people or admit failure and return to the world to live as common, dirt worshipping hedge wizards (their view on things, naturally). As they were not willing to give up their perfect, airborne lives- they instead decided on another course.  And so the wars between heaven and earth began. If they could conquer the people who had remained upon the earth- they could take resources for their cities any time they wished. perhaps even take those who didn't have strong magical talents to truly make their lives utter perfection for all those in the aerial cities: take slaves who would do the menial, unpleasant, and occasionally dangerous tasks for them.  If they ruled the surface, after all, where could such people hope to escape to?  For the people below- the aerial cities were an insult to nature itself- abominations that should be destroyed. Now that fate has allowed them to clash, starting with the fall of one city and subsequence slaughter of it's inhabitants by the ground-dwellers, they are readying their own weapons....  But science is of human nature- and some are not so sure that bringing the natural against the human-natural is such a good idea. Humans have raised above animals by learning how not only to exist with nature- but to move past it's primal cycles as well. What weapons they have- those of the cities may know how to defeat. So some have drawn back to watch..worried and apprehensive...and with good cause. Aerial cities are hard targets to reach...  Especially when they themselves are armed with terrible weapons to rain death down on people long before they realize what is hiding above the clouds. As a result, the mages have started altering weather to try to force the citadels down- but they fly well above cloud height usually...far beyond the reach of a mere storm.  Thus the world has begun to enter a dark age with the surface world being torn apart bit by bit by wild storms and devastating aerial attacks...it will only end when one side finally wins...or they somehow call a truce.  Some places have given in to the cities and act as spies in hopes of earning a place other than as slaves.  some within the cities feel what they are doing is wrong, however. They do think the people of the ground little better than beasts...but even beasts should be treated well..not beaten into submission....  ----  Yes I know. lacking actual STORY...but..we all know /background/ story is my strong point. ^_^;

      Just checking to see if this works. ^_^ I'll be using this to post my own personal random musings, story ideas (well background ideas in my case.), so on and so forth.  So if I invited ya here- welcome! If not- scram. =P I'm not friendly and never claimed to be.

      Isn't it strange how silly our society is when you actually look at it? Our entirely world wide economy is based on a metal that hasn't even been particuarly useful, just pretty to look at according to most people, and only recently had any kind of value beyond it's looks.  Pretty weird when you actually stop to think about it.
