      Just got back from 1st Kendo practice. I got there early and managed to meet some people from a web board that helped me to find a dojo. They were kind enought to teach me some footwork and a basic men (head) cut. When the sensei arrived it was time to warm up, and I ended up looking like a fool. The warm up suburi (practice) kept on getting faster and faster, and I ended losing rhythm very quickly and I almost fell over a few times. Then it was time for seiza, and after that the sensei taught me footwork again and 3 step, 2 step, 1 step and jumping suburi, which was the one I messed up totally in warm up.  After that I watched everyone spar. Some of the parents were kind enough to buy me some food :) .

      I've decided to take up kendo. I know you might be thinking, 'hehe this dude has watched Kill Bill too much', and you're probably half right. I've actually been thinking about it for a while (probably a couple of years at the most), and have been ridiculed by certain friends for contemplating starting, 'cos apparently it's not useful unlike jujitsu or kung fu. Well, I've finally got off my arse and have found a dojo in Bangkok and I have my first practice on Saturday.  I have a fair idea of what's in store. I know it won't be easy and there's a lot of hard work involved. Still, I would like to thank the timely release of Kill Bill for inspiring me to finally do something.

      I attended the competition yesterday and it was loads of fun. Kendoka came from all over Thailand to take part. The cup is named after the sensei who brought kendo to Thailand.  I helped out by checking that the competitor's shinai met the standard requirements. I also did the scoring for some of the competitions, which is harder than you might expect, because I had to work out whether cuts were 'men', 'kote' or 'do', and if I blinked or was distracted for a second I sometimes missed it. Also, working out who got the point and writing the score on the board accordingly was a bit tricky, because people only had numbers and a small red or white tag to identify themselves, and the shimpans indicate who scored with the used of a red or white flag.  There were 5 divisions; junior, high school, men open, women open and special (for senseis). The junior, high school and women divisions were quite brutal and very entertaining; there was much hacking and screaming.  A kid called Wataru, who trains at BCC, absolutely clobbered an opponent. For some reason the other kid just stood there for a second and Wataru just cut 'men' and ploughed through, sending the opponent flying. All good stuff.  The special division was good to watch; very clean and precise. Two senseis that teach in Bangkok got to the final, which went into double over time. It was eventually won by Endo-sensei.

      Today's practice was much better. Jackie is a really good teacher even if he can't speak very good english. He persists with me and always corrects me when I'm doing something wrong, no matter how small the problem is, which is what I need at this point. I don't want to be ironing out practiced bad habits later on.   I got to line up for uchikomi, even though I don't have hakama and keikogi. It was good, I got to train against Tamada-sensei, who gave me some good pointers (ie more suburi, more suburi and more suburi :P ).   There were quite a few visitors as well. A lady from the Japan Foundation and some dude who had just arrived from overseas. The lady from the Japan Foundation is pretty cute ;) .

      I'm training at almost every opportunity I get. I do about 250 suburi everyday, which is ok for a beginner I suppose, but I'll need to up that to get some stamina. I would like to improve as fast as I can so I can get into bogu.   I thought I was improving fairly well up until recently. So far I have been taught by two sempai, and I've been getting positive feedback from what I'm doing. However, at the last practice they took me back to basics and put me in with some people who have just joined (going over footwork, etiquette, 3-step suburi, 2-step suburi, etc.), which is fair enough, but they didn't go over the extra stuff they taught me in previous sessions. Is it to teach me patience? Does that mean I haven't mastered the basics enough? In previous sessions, were they only giving me a taster of what to expect? Probably, but at the time I was a little pissed off. So I'm determined to practice the basics everyday until I'm good enough to advance.   One thing I don't want to happen is to be held back, but if it happens I guess it can only make me better by reviewing the basics over and over.

       Bamboo Sticks   I've asked a friend who is going to Japan for a week to bring back a shinai with him. I would order one myself over the net, but I don't have a credit card, and I thought it might be cheaper if my mate brought one over rather than it being shipped over. Anyway, I'm waiting to see what he thinks. I can't wait till I get it :) . It'll certainly make training easier, and I'll look less stupid than when I was using an umbrella as a substitute.

      I thought yesterday's practice was painful. After today's practice, I could barely walk because of the blisters on my feet, I could barely lift a cup of water to my mouth because my biceps stopped functioning. Having said that, I haven't felt this good since I used to run in competitions. Must be the endorphins or somethings.   I must sort out a shinai (bamboo sword thingy). My brother reckons his friend wants to sell one. Otherwise I'll have to order on the internet, which isn't so great, 'cos I don't think I have a valid card anymore, and paying my credit card bills from here is a bit shit.

       Happy New Year!!!  First practice back after new year, and it was hell. We warmed up with 1000 suburi. At 500, I thought I was doing well, but then things started to go wrong. Before I went to practice I had a really big buffet lunch. I had it at 12pm, and practice was at 3pm, so I thought I had given it enough time to settle. By 2:30, I was still bloated, but I thought I could manage. After the 500 point I thought I was going to puke. Also, the sempai was throwing in suburi that I had never done before, and I was all over the place; quite embarassing. I could hear the laughter from one of the sensei behind me, and eventually he had to take me to one side and show me how to do it properly.  Bought a new shinai, took it home and found out it was a size 38 instead of a 39 (was a bit of a rush at the end of the session), which is ok, but it needs to be at least 510 grams, otherwise I'm using a girly one. If it is lighter, I'm not sure if I can add something to it to make it heavier. I suppose I could, but not use the shinai in competition, in case I get busted.

      Another good practice today despite it being unbearably hot. I only faltered a bit during warmup and my cuts were straight. A lot of senseis turned up, but I only managed to ji-geiko with one; there seemed to be some confusion in the rotation. I ended up sparring with one kid 3 times, and being a motodachi for the beginners 4 times. Still, sparring with the kid was better than last week, but I keep on getting pummeled by the sensei (probably too nervous).

      Today's practice was a good one; I wasn't sucking wind as much, and I was more aggressive during ji-geiko. We were actually taught how to use 'seme' (pressure), and a few 'harai' techniques (knock the opponent's shinai out the way before a cut).  In ji-geiko, I tried to take points at every opportunity, be more aggressive, but trying to keep some form going. I tried a lot of 'hiki' techniques (going backwards, usually from tsuba zerai), and some 'suriage' techniques (deflect attacking shinai before a cut).

      All my sempai did not turn up today. They were off in Hong Kong for a competition. So that left me to do the calls for start and end of the session. Unfortunately I didn't know what they were. I never really paid attention when my sempai did this, and I really should have, because it was a highly embarrasing situation.    Here's what I should have said at the start:  sei retsu (line up)  seiza (sit in seiza)  mokuso (meditate)  mokuso yame (stop meditating)  shomen ni rei (bow to shomen)  sensei ni rei (bow to teacher)  men o tsuke (put on helmet)    Here's what I should have said at the end:  sei retsu  seiza  mokuso  mokuso yame  men o tore (remove helmet)  sensei ni rei  shomen ni rei   Oh and my zanshin sucked badly; I didn't have total commitment in my strikes. Also, I didn't grab any opportunities. I tended to wait and see, rather than go in totally committed to the strike I had in mind, regardless of the outcome. Anyway, I'll remember for next time.

      Today I practiced in bogu for the first time. I had been waiting to do this for a long time, so I was pretty excited when my sempai brought out the bogu and said put it on. Well, it's not all that I thought it would be. It's definitely much hotter, and I have to pretty much relearn all the techniques that I've been taught so far. Tenouchi was pretty hard with the stiff kote, although the kote wasn't much defence against a heavy cut (ouch!).   Instead of trying out some simple cuts, I was thrown in with learning suriage and nuki waza, and I sucked big time. One of the motodachi wasn't much help; he was constantly trying to beat me with tiny waza, rather than letting me learn the techniques properly, and my cuts got smaller and smaller while I was trying to land a cut.   I'll see how tomorrow goes. It shouldn't be as bad as today, but I expect to be very tired afterwards.

      I got my hakama and keikogi (kendo clothing) yesterday. It looks pretty cool, but it is really hot to practice in. Yesterday's practice was quite bad, and today's was even worse. I thought I was going to pass out today. I just couldn't continue at one stage, but after a bit of a rest and lots of water I was feeling better.  Lots of senseis turned up today. I'm sure a few were having a laugh at my expense; I'm pretty sure one of them was. Doesn't really matter much if they did; I know I worked hard yesterday and today. I don't know what it is, but this one sensei isn't very nice. I respect that it has taken him a lot of hard work and dedication to get where he is, but he's not a very nice person. I thought every kendoka was supposed to respect each other, no matter what rank they are, so long as they put in the effort. Even so, he seems to have a look of contempt for pretty much anyone.  I got a lot of good remarks from my sempais though, which is always nice.

      Today's practice went very well. My wrist wasn't giving me any problems and I practiced using a technique that speeded up my strikes a bit. Got some compliments about how straight my strikes were, and about my kote strikes. I'll try not to let it got to my head :P . The only downside to today is the swollen elbow; lump like an egg.

      I've got my first exam coming up next month on the 25th. I can't wait, but I hope my wrist heals properly before then.  I think I only have to do 3-step, 2-step, 1-step subri and hayasuburi (10 each) and men-uchi for the test. Seems OK to me - it's only for 10kyu.

      My left wrist is still playing up. I've got a support for it and I went back to the beginner's group at last practice to take the strain off it. So far so good; the shooting pains have stopped and I've tried to keep the wrist immobilised as much as possible.  Neoprene supports are definitely a gift from the gods.

      I think it's about time I bought my own armour. I've been using a club set for a while now, and I think some other people are waiting to move on to bogu, so it's only fair that I should free up the club set.  I've been thinking about a 5mm machine stiched set from kendoshop.com for $287. It should last me a while until I'm good enough or can afford a better set.

      I think I have picked up an injury to my wrist after last weekend's intense practice. A coulple of days after Sunday I could not clench my left fist properly and my finger tendons felt really tight. So I've started to do some serious stretching exercises to try and loosen up a bit. It seems to be working; I can clench my fist now, but not with full strength yet because tendons still feel a bit sore. I guess I should take stretching exercises seriously, not only for the inside of my wrist but also the outside tendons as well.

      Shinotsuka sensei, 8th dan, from the Kanagawa police, came to visit our dojo last weekend. A 7th dan also came with him, but unfortunately I didn't get his name. They were both amazing and they made the 4th and 5th dans look like beginners again. I got some good advise from the 7th dan, which was keep my eyes on the eyes of the opponent, and don't look where I'm striking. I didn't get to spar with them, I suppose it would have been a waste of their time for the beginners to do so, but they were kind enough to give a little instruction at the end of the session.

      The armour has finally arrived. Now I can give back the club bogu and someone else can move up.  The new armour is fairly good quality; 5mm is good enough for a beginner and my budget. I bought a standard machine set (#504) from  urlLink Kendoshop . Everything needs to be broken in; I'm in the process of breaking in the kote by rotating the fist section in relation to the cuff and I've stored the men with the futon in the correct position. I won't be able to use anything for a couple of weeks, because everyone is off to Chiang Mai for a kendo seminar, which, unfortunately, I cannot attend because of work and money shortage.

      I've just had my first kendo examination. I applied for 10 kyu, but was granted 9 kyu, so I'm really happy about that. I got really nervous just before the exam. I don't know why, because we were tested on stuff everyone has done lots of times before.  For 10 and 9 kyu:  suburi: 3 step men x10 2 step men x10 1 step men x10 hayasuburi x10  then men-uchi x4  Oh, and I should be getting my new bogu tomorrow. :D

      Kendo practice wasn't that great. I was knackered when I got there after being stuck in traffic for two and a half hours in the sweltering heat with a busted A/C. Eventually I just had to stop, because I was so pissed off with everything. I didn't feel like I had the energy to fight back, and the more hits I took the more pissed off I got. I think that's the last time I will try and make it to a Friday practice; there's no point stressing about getting there when the traffic is so bad, only to be too tired to practice properly. I guess I'm not a shining example of how a kenshi should behave, but there was no way I could continue in the state I was in.

      Ki Ken Tai Ichi is the spirit, sword and body working as one. This means that at the moment of the strike, your front foot should stomp, your kiai should be released, and the shinai should make contact with the target at the same time.   At today's practice, I think I experienced proper ki ken tai ichi for the first time; there was one men-cut that I executed that just felt different to all the others, yet it felt 'right'; I put everything into the strike and all the elements seemed to coordinate perfectly. I think it's probably because I didn't think about what I was doing. It felt really good.  During keiko, I tried to focus on getting through quickly after the cut, as well at keeping everything straight. I still lack stamina; I really need to sort this out.  Endo-sensei, who doesn't usually say much to me, said my men-cuts have improved loads. It certainly made me happy.   Also, everyone got a tenugui from a visiting sensei (they're very nice - lots of unreadable kanji).

      Well, I'm glad I decided to go; it was an excellent practice and there was no trouble from the police.  I was a little shakey at the start of practice (I'm used to practicing on Fridays and Saturdays, so by Sunday I'm really focused and my technique has been tweaked a bit, but those practice sessions were cancelled this week). I tried to focus on my men cuts during ji-geiko; applying pressure then exploding into the cut, while keeping everything straight. This week they were a little better, although I still need to build up some strength in my arms (I'm still being pushed aside by the stronger kendoka), and I also need a bit more speed.  A sensei, who I don't often get the chance to keiko with, said that I'm a different person compared to when I first started. Maybe it's because I'm no longer worried about being hit, and I try and give it my best everytime. It made me smile anyway.

      I seem to be slacking; I didn't do any suburi yesterday, because I was tired and stressed after work (I've not been paid and one of my students isn't doing too well).   I'll try and make up for it today.

      Today's practice was good; I managed to do all the warm-up suburi, and I managed to complete keiko without taking a break until the proper break time.  We did 2 minute ji-geiko then rotated, which was good, because we got to keiko with about 5-6 different sensei. Unfortunately there was a power cut, but there was just enough light to continue. I'm particularly proud of myself for not running out of steam by the second sensei; I gave it everything with each and every sensei that I had keiko with. I was completely shattered by the end of it though.  I practiced trying to keep my men cuts straight; I keep on getting pushed aside when my opponent goes for men as well. I also practiced some oji-waza; men-keishi-do and kote-suriage-men.  We had a visit from Dave Young, 5-dan, who is from Canada. He teaches kendo to the students at ISB during the week. The students say he's tough during keiko, and it certainly looked like it when a couple sempai had ji-geiko with him. I had two minutes with him during the rotation, and as I went for kote I felt a jolt. I wondered what the hell happened, and then I realised I had been tsukied.

      I really need to improve my strength; I think I must be one of the weakest kendoka in my dojo and I get tired too easily. At the end of the warm-up, my sempai decided it would be a good idea to do 200 haya suburi to finish off. I thought it wouldn't be so bad, but at 150 I couldn't go on and I wimped out, then joined in for the last 20. Still, there was a time when I couldn't do 100 haya suburi straight off; I will get better.  Good points about todays practice: all cuts were straight :D .

      Todays practice was cut short by about an hour. I wasn't too happy about it, but there was nothing that could be done. We practiced lots of basics today, and it seems all the suburi that I did at home with the weighted shinai really paid off; all my cuts were straight and were executed with ease. It's a shame there was only time to ji-geiko with one person.

      After last weekend's competition, I left my kendogi out to dry over the back of a chair, as I normally do after use. My dog seemed quite interested in it. I hadn't washed it for a while and the gi was a bit smelly, so I thought my dog was just checking stuff out.   The next day, when I came downstairs to fold up the kendogi, my foot slipped in some liquid, which, on closer inspection, had a yellowish tinge and a very distinctive smell. The stupid mutt had marked my kendogi while I was a sleep!!!  He's supposed to be house trained and everything. The kendogi might have stank so badly that he was trying to get me to wash it, which worked rather well.

      Even when you think you're good and you're on a roll, there'll always be someone to put you back in your place.  Over the 5-6 months that I've been practicing kendo, I've sometimes thought that my progess has been going fairly well, but then at the next practice I get smacked down. Even though I'm not the sort of person that gets cocky about the whole thing, I think it's good that I'm regularly put in my place. It gives me a solid grounding and clear perspective, without which, my head would be permanently in the clouds and I wouldn't improve at all.

      After last weekends shocking performance, I have new found motivation to try harder, much harder. I've added extra weight to the end of my shinai, but the only things I could find were 4 masonary drill bits, which I've taped to the mono-uchi. Suburi are definitely more difficult.  I've also promised myself to build up to 1000 suburi a day. I've been slacking in the past and now it's time to really work hard. Today I managed 400 with the added weight, and by the beginning of next week I shall be up to 1000 a day (only on days that I don't have practice, which is Monday to Thursday).

      Well, that was certainly a learning experience.  In the first match, I threw away a one point lead by trying to go for the extra ippon. In the other match I simply got whooped by someone from Ramkamheng University. The whole of the squad is very fast. My team even had trouble against a women's team from that university; I drew, my second team mate drew, and the last team mate lost. Being the fool, I thought my team was quite reasonable, and would win a few matches.  The bar has been raised, quite considerably.

      We've been preparing for the tournament for the past week by doing lots of shiai-keiko. I've come to the conclusion that I pretty much suck, and have been wondering whether my team members' idea to include me was a wise move. There has been lots to learn; trying to find exactly what is needed to be awarded ippon. In ji-geiko, I sometimes get called up on zanshin and kiai, so most of the time I think I'm doing OK, but in shiai it is definitely stricter, and 80% of the time I don't get awarded ippon because of this.  I also managed to put someone in hospital, because I felt the need to turn it up a notch in order to get a point. I felt really bad, and even though my sempai told me these things happen it didn't make any difference. All I was trying to do was pass after striking men. Unfortunately, the opponent was still in the way and he toppled over backwards on to his arse. He's OK, but he is advised to take a week off.     The tournament is tomorrow.

      Practice was held at Ramkamheng University. It was really hot today and I was made to do 50 extra haya suburi at the end of warm up, for a reason I couldn't decipher. At least I wasn't the only one; Ote (one of my team mates in the Friendship Tournament) had to do 50 extra as well, and another person had to do it, but the other person didn't do it properly and had to do and extra 20. I could really feel the difference a break of two weeks could make; I was really out of shape and was struggling to make it through the warm-up.  Keiko itself didn't seem anything out of the ordinary. I thought I put in an average performance; I was more focused on not passing out rather than anything else. However, I was told I did OK, and my men cuts are good, although I should work on my footwork after the cut.  At the end, some of us went round to a sensei's house to have some food and watch some kendo vids.

      There hasn't been a practice since Saturday 12th. I'm beginning to feel uneasy.

      I seem to be neglecting tenouchi. I sometimes lose control of the kensen, especially when I miss hiki waza. I'm not squeezing the tsuka like a should be; doing so would lock my wrists and stop me over extending them when I miss.  I have fairly good control over the kensen during suburi, without squeezing the tsuka, so I think this is why I've been neglecting proper tenouchi. This is something I should keep in mind.

      The practice today wasn't too great; it was unbearably hot; and I got stabbed in the throat with a stray kensen. The unintentional tsuki wasn't that bad (my windpipe didn't collapse or close up, thank god), but it did make me choke and retch for a bit.  Apparently, I'm eligible to take part in the next ASEAN Kendo Tournament in 2007, because I have Thai nationality. I think there's a problem with finding enough people; a few people who have dan rank do not have enough time to practice. Still, I will have to do some serious training to get a chance of being selected. Three years should give me enough time to get shodan and myself into shape.  No practice till next week.

      Today was the last practice at ISB for a couple of months; apparently they are closing for a bit. That means we might have to practice at BCC on Sundays, as well as Fridays and Saturdays, which is a shame, because I was getting used to the air conditioning at ISB.  The practice was pretty good, even though I thought I might be a little weak after missing breakfast. I got another compliment about my men cuts. I think it's time to include something else in ji-geiko; I might go for kote-men and harai-men at next practice.

      Practice wasn't held where I thought it would be; the main sports hall was being used by some company for team building exercises or something. Instead, we had to practice at the old sports hall, which has a really old wooden floor that has gaps and holes in a few places. It wasn't that bad; we had the whole hall to ourselves and the hall had a mirror along one wall, so we could check our suburi.

      I just got a text message saying that tomorrow's practice will be held at a different location. Apparently, it will be held in the sports hall at my old university (Chula), which is a pretty cool place to practice. I'm not sure how many people will turn up, or if there will be any sensei or high ranking sempai there. I guess I'll just have to wait and see.

      I found an interesting  urlLink post  on  urlLink Joi Ito's  weblog, about swordsmen being punished for disgrace by having their little fingers chopped off. It seems to make sense, as most of the power and grip is focused on the little finger, the ring finger and the middle finger of the left hand.

      I have not been to a practice for a week, and I've been slacking with my suburi at home. Things have been unsettled recently.  I will be going this weekend, and I'll make sure the practice is worth while.

      The last couple of practices have not been too great. Everything about my performance was weak.  I don't think my mind has been in the right place recently and this has affected my kendo.  I'm doing more suburi at home to try and iron out a load of creases.

      I pushed myself harder than I have every pushed myself before. I didn't wimp out when I thought I was going to pass out; I kept on going until the proper breaks came along. I'm definitely proud of myself, considering the searing heat and the seemingly extra hard session we had.  We started with an average warm-up, then moved on to kihon waza, then ji-geiko with sensei, then a sempai took charge while the sensei did ji-geiko amongst themselves. The sempai went nuts; it started normally with three sets of kiri-kaeshi, large men, small men, kote, debana kote, kaeshi do, but then he busted out something like 10 sets of kakari-keiko and then a few sets of 30 second ji-geiko; that really tested my will to go on.  Oh, and I got my name plate as well.

      No warm-up! I don't know why this was missed. I think it is an important part of training; not only for the physical aspect, but it also gives people a chance to focus on the upcoming session. We went straight into lots and lots of men-uchi and kote-uchi; I think this was done for 3/4 of the whole session.  At the beginning, my cuts we all wrong; the kensen was all over the place and there was no ki-ken-tai-ichi; they didn't seem as crisp as I have done them before. Eventually, I loosened up a bit and things got a bit better.  Well, the only good thing about not warming up at the start was that I had lots of energy for ji-geiko. I just kept going and going and going, and I felt full of energy.   Because there wasn't any sensei at this session, I practiced seme against my peers. I'm becoming a bit more confident in my use of seme. Of course, I'm only a beginner and I've a lot to learn about seme, and things often don't turn out the way I want to during ji-geiko, but I've noticed that I just feel more confident with the use of the kensen and the control of maai to apply pressure.

      A pretty normal practice. I got some encouragement from the senior sensei, so I'm happier than last week, because last week was terrible. I only had time for one ji-geiko, with a sempai who I've not had keiko with for a long time. Normally, I would have been beaten to a pulp, but I was not totally overwhelmed like I usually am. I guess yesterday's practice set me up for today's.

      The practices have been sparodic and this has meant my technique and endurance has suffered (aye, aye :P). I turned up to practice late with only an hour left, because I had to take the car in for servicing, but I still ran out of steam. It wasn't the usual, 'Argh, I'm tired, I'll just pace myself from now on and I'll make it', but a total shutdown after one round of 20s ji-geiko/20s kakari-geiko/kirikaeshi. And, instead of taking a break while the person infront of me did a round, they dropped out and I was thrown in for another round. 'Lord help me!', I thought. It must have looked pathetic; I really can't believe I made it through to the end though. Afterwards, I felt like I was floating; ah, endorphines, a gift from the gods no less!
