      Okay first off, I have explained the fact that I trash her too sometimes. I have told you all that, you should all know that! But what I don't know is that, why would someone pin something on someone I haven't talked to or even seen for that matter?  And what also gets to me is that somebody knows something but they won't tell me what it is! Oh well. It's not anything new but it still gets to me none the less right? DAMN RIGHT! No kidding............... Second, Ryan this is to you! Why is it that you keep talking about justin and I breaking up? WHY? I know that you envy what I have. I mean what we have you wish you could have. You know what I mean! But anyway, I just don't know what to do with you? I want to be nice and all but I am tired of being nice and hiding behind what I really feel inside. I know that you can understand that. Yes I know it is a two way road I know that things can come back at me just as easy as I can give them to someone else. Why can't you except that shawnda is gone and I am not her in any comparison. Things are diffrent, things are going to change. Why is that so hard? Is that even the case with things right now? What the hell is going on? I sure as hell don't know?   Okay this is to Kari, Kari, I am sorry that I accused you of saying that, all of what I hear is second hand. I am sorry that this happend I wish things were diffrent for us. But there not so what I can do? I wish you were here right now. I really need so say things to you. I really need to set things strait. I know that it would help things. I am here so I will say them ( somethings ) Anyway, So what I want to say is that, I miss having you around. I miss not having someone that I can laugh with. I miss all of our inside jokes. Because no one else knows them so nobody get's it when I say it. So yeah then I feel dumb. You have just always been there and now you're not.........It's all sad like and stuffs without you......I know that I can be the most annoying person you've met but, I am trying so hard not to be anymore. I know that sounds like something I just say and not do, but I am really trying right now. I thank you for everything that you have done for me girl. I really do thank you so much and if it's up to me, you are coming to my birthday and that's that.........no one can change my mind on that one.  Michelle, I think that we need to spend more time together, I like to hang out with you. My parents seem to like you alright too, so thats a plus. Yeah, UmmMmmM I really think that things are awsome between us. I think that our freindship could last a long time. I would really like that. I think that that would really awsome........I really don't know what else to say but I don't to make you feel jipped because my other dedications are longer then yours but I see you all the time so I don't have much to say.   I think that I am done for now but I am going to do more work on edditing my spot.

      okay, This week has been very entertaining! Yeah, First off, My personal project is pissing me off! I don't have any of my materials and the photo teacher hasn't told me how to work the medium format camera! thats only because he's always busy! I dont know what I am going to do. I have nothing left to do. I am stuck and that just drives me insane.   Oh well, Other then that my week has been awsome. I know now that I am really in love with him and nothing can change that. Nothing I mean absolutely nothing! But yeah! Things have gotten a little crazy lately. i hope that I am not grounded for too long this time! But I only have 6 min left of class.   Yeah, I'm going to miss my freinds while im grounded! And hopefully they are going to miss me too!  Love-ed you all so much you have no Idea......... But yeah robyn hopefully we can get together to go to the clinic and yeah..... not going to say much else about that...... Love-ed you all again, Love-ed, TwEaK  oh did i mention what I was grounded for? I argued with my parents last night on whether gay was wrong or not and apperantly they dissagreed with me!

      okay today is pissing me off. I don't want to be here today. I don't have a camera I don't want to make the emulsions until I have a roll of film ready. But what else can I do with my time? I don't feel good. I feel like I am going to pass out! I feel like shit. It's probibly because I haven't eaten anything at all today except a granola bar. And that isn't nearly enough. Cuz my antibiotics will make me sick if I don't eat enough with them. So I am probibly going to get sick and thats not what I need.

      Okay today kind of sucked ass.....But I guess thats what you get for being me! Oh well....I think that I am going to have to take math over again!!! That sux major ass...I didn't get this far just to fail it...AGAIN!    Link for science class sorry if I don't post it I'll forget it! http://www.alternativephotography.com/process.html  Anyway, I had a great day other then that! I think that the word assosciation needs to end no more...I was getting too out of it......I was thinking too much...I hate it when I get that way!  Yeah the other day when Ryan left us alone.....I think things got a little too intense...I mean for the enviroment and the circumstances...I thought that all of it in general was amazing but not there and not then...it wouldn't have been the right time...I don't know when the time will be but it will happen...I hope..... (yes baberz I hope it will)  The things that he said to me today made me fill with so much happiness I thought that I was going to explode......    sorry again..... http://www.alternativephotography.com/process_forgotten  I want to believe everything that he says but my heart wont take it for what it is........I know why it wont but I wish that I could get past that....Who knows...yeah UmmMmmMmmMmmMmmM so I don't know what to say...Thats just typical me right there.....BLAH!!  Baberz, I don't know what I would do without you. I don't see me without you...I believe that in my heart I truly do love you, with that all I am and all I have. I will never lie, I will never cheat, I will never betray you in anyway. I want you to know that. I know that you have reasons to have hesitation with this but it's all true. I know that I have these hesitations as well.... wich is why you can understand my constant asking of reassurence...That's all I need.....Is reassurence that you mean what you say and things like that. I hope that this lasts a long time. I want this to work I really do. I know that you do to. But we must admit that not everything lasts forever. We have to realize that.....Which means that we must work at it.......We can't just expect it to work just like that.....I take everything day by day and take it as it comes. That's just the way I work. if thats a problem please tell me. Do you think that if the circumstances would have been diffrent we would have let things go alot further? i think that it would have, but i still don't think it was the right time. But at least it was better timing then the first attempt or consideration.....(I Guess thats a way to put it)  Yes I am listening to that song again. I can't help it. I can identify with it so much its undescribable. Why so much I don't know. Man........I am really tired and its only 8:04 pm and I shouldn't be tired. But as you can guess I am over at my G and G's but.....I can't use the phone or email. I basicly i can't have human interaction. I really did want to call my baberz....But no0o0o0o0o0o my parents had to say something!!!! Girrrrrrrrrr......Thats makes me so pissed!!!! I hate that......Oh well....At least i can earn some money tomorrow...that way I can buy some more thongs..........(maybe lime green) *laughs* Anyway!!  We are not countries. We are not nations. We are not religions. We are not gods. We are not weapons. We are not ammunition. We are not killers. We will NOT be tools. Mother fuckers!! I will not die!! I will not kill!! I will not be your slave!! I will not fight your battle!! I will not die on your battlefield!! I will not fight for your wealth!! I am not a fighter!! I am a human being!!  Yeah that song just ended!!!!! I love that song!! BLAH its the truth too......... Blah.......... Ima go now...I still have a lot of work to do.... I'll post some more tomorrow!! Love you always and forever, Love, TwEaK  *chases imaginery tail......running in circles....sits and watches the stars circle around her head......laighs.......flips you off......goes "pbbbbt"......does the whole bridge thing with her back......screams in pain because of her wrist......does it again anyway.........(the image fades away)*

      I am in a good mood I guess...............But not really......I am acctually really angry now that I think about it and I am going to vent!              I am really kinda pissed off at this lady who came to our school and pissed us all off..... I don't know what to do to get it off my mind.   This lady basicly came in here and told us that we were racist and that we were wrong and that we needed to change... ....             Thats not the whole point she was trying to make. She was saying that things sway in our favor meaning I am white. But somethings tend not sway in other people of other races favor and thats whats wrng. She could have just said that, but she went on this whole speech about how things used to be and the way things are in other places. But maybe this place isn't like other places. Maybe we are diffrent. Maybe we aren't, who the hell knows. In class for the first half of it that was all we were talking about.             I am done talking about it. I am not racist I know people who are and thats just fine for them I am not associated with them. Some of them I do hang out with and I don't hate them or dispise them for that at all i except that as their opinion and thats that. nothing more nothing less........ .........            I wish people would stop looking at the technicalities of the situation and take what she has to say as something that we can learn from and maybe even change if thats wha this generation wants to do?  I want the world to change but I don't look at it as a realistic option for us or any human in gerneral.             I am not saying that all of these people who try to change the world for the better aren't they are changing it only a minority of it changes. That is personally not enough change to see the world as a better place then before.              I am just so worked up about this I don't know what to do with myself. I think that I just want to break down and cry and I don't want to at the same time cuz I think that I would never stop crying and that would just be mean. I think that people need to be more accepting to others opinions. In class I walked out I couldn't take it and I shouldn't have to.             I swear if we have another disscusion on it in D-Block I am so going to cry and no one can stop me not even me for that matter.

      Well okay, I am in science now! They are all outside, to see a group project preveiw of what they're doing......... I asked for the option to stay inside and work. So that is what I am going to do. I am working on my emulsion, I have yet to mix t but once I do I am going to experiment with printing on glass. So that should be awsome. Mr.Chambers has 4 boxes of glass cut into rectangle sections that I can print on. He said that they were going to be thrown away, but that I could use them that way we wouldn't waste all of that glass he got. So yeah this is very cool. I am happy that I am making progress on my project. I am not happy that I am falling behind once again in int. lit. I hate that I can't keep up. I am not where I should be in the book we are reading. I haven't done my vocab for a while and thats two points everyday. So yeah I am not surprised that I have a low grade in that class. I am not suprised that I might fail this class and have to take it next year. I don't want to but I might have to if I don't get my act together like everyone is telling me I should do. But I am also thinking of summer school and earning the credits that I didn't get or need to catch up on. But other then that everything is fine. I guess.......... Last night my mom got mad at me, cuz I was using her crafty stuff and was leaving stuff all messy. But later she comes into my room doesn't say a word. She goes over to my desk and dumps the top drawer onto the floor. On the pile of newly cleaned clothes. I was so pissed. I stayed up till 1:30 am being pissed at her. But as she left my room she said, " I was just reorganizing your stuff. I thought you would like it." But when she left I said to myself. "i'll reorganize your face." I was so mad.........
