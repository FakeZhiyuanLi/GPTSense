      This evening I went to a park - woohoo :d  I used to go there when I was little, but today was the first time I had been in years, and the first time I really appreciated how big it was.  Plus, I had to do some research there, on children playground furniture, for my upcoming DT exam.   Big Brother is much better thi year. Emma, the stupid thick cow is doing my head in though! Get her out of the house already.  Harry Potter 3: The Prisoner of Azkaban comes out tomorrow :D, not sure if i'll go to watch it tomorrow though, might wait till my exams are over - nah, I'll try and go tomorrow! :D  Over and out.

      That daft bitch (kitten?) who would go into the house unless she got a snog from her girlfriend - what a prat. The only good thing about her is that she kept swearing to the press.  Marco - hmmmm - is he gay? or does he just act it?  The man who came in wearing nothing but a G-String should be voted off purely because he's a fucking knob, and an attention seeking loser - wearin a G-String - if that wasn't an attention seeking stunt then nothing is.  Victor - top guy - straight up, no nonsense kind of guy, and isn't afraid to tell his views. Hopefully he'll stay in the house for a fair while.  Ahmed - what can I say but the man is a genius. He fled from war in Somalia, came here as an Asylum seeker, and now has a degree in law and business. Plus, he aint scared to say hes a homophobe. Hopefully he'll make his feelings clear in the house to the gy ones, and all hell will erupt, Victor will back him up.  The Clever Guy - You know, the one who has 4 A levels at grade A, hope he stays in.  There arent any special girls in the house this year, theres a Page 3 wannabe, slut, get her off!   This series will be all about getting as much sex and TV as possible - the C4 bosses think it will get them viewers which it won't. Thick bastards.  I don't like Devina, shes on every bastards TV show there is.  Ah, from now on, my blog will be no-swearing zone.  Currently Listening 2: Michael Jackson - Will You Be There

      Well folks, for the past two days I had been revising like a horse for my Maths (Mechanics) exam, I knew it would be hard, but I kept revising and revising, doing past papers and so on.  Even today in the morning before the exam, which was in the afternoon, I was revising for around 4 hours.  As I went into the exam, I wasn't that confident, I had already decdied in my mind that I was going to re-sit the exam in November. Let me just say, the paper was FUCKING SOLID! Every question was hard. The things I had revised didn't come up, it was just awful.  I flopped it big time. I mean which wanker came up with a question paper so difficult. All my mates found it difficult - even the further maths people said it was hard.  So I'm going to re-sit it.  Also, a few people have said they don't like my attitude. I mean what the fuck?  Just because I don't worry in person and show it off to everyone, "oh god im gonna fail, oh god the girls messed me around, oh god i ant got no money" does that make me a bad person? No. If I don't want to show my emotion in public deal with people!  I got the same shit from my Head of Sixth Form. When he suspended me for two days, for something a teacher had told him I said, which in fact I NEVER did, he said that "I don't seem concerned"..  ...Of course I'm concerend, I've got a spotless record before now and your suspended, people will look down on me when I go for Uni and Job Applications, I mean what did he expect me to do, Cry?  Tut.   Big Brother is BACK! SHAMON! Hopefully this year will be better than last years. But I predict the theme for this one will be sex, sex, and more sex, which I for will not be tuning into. I don't wanna see two rats going at it.  Righty - thats enough of a rant for today.  Schumacher to win the Grand Prix on Sunday.  *leaving*  Currently Listening 2: Baby Bash (i think thats what he's called) - Sugar Sugar

      Sup folks.  Well today has been a dull day so far. I had a crap nights sleep because it was too hot - kept waking up in the middle of the night!  Woke up at around 10. Its now 4.50pm and I have done no revision. So I'm going to start as soon as I've done this blog.  Got a phone call last night at around 11/12, it was a girl I know, and I was curious as to why she was ringing me at this time, I bottled it, and didn't pick up. I'm gonna txt her in a bit and see what she wanted.  I don't know why, but recently I've felt as if there is something in my life missing, I don't know what though. Oh well, life goes on.  I didn't go on the jog! *WOOHOO!*. But I am going to go tomorrow definately.  LOL @ George Bush falling off his bike - not only is he incapable of eating Pretzels, he cannot ride a bike.  Laters.

      A quick entry! I forgot to tell you about "The Moth"!  The other night, at around 10.30, I was on PC, talking to a few people, listening to some music (I think it was Outlandish I was listening to). But yeh, I heard a noise, like a beating, and the lgiht coming my way from the lgihts began to sort of flicker.  I looked up, and there was a MASSIVE moth there - it had come in through the open window, attracted by the light.  I thought SHIT! Its some sort of mutant extra large moth! I went and got some tissue, ready to grab it and flush it down the toilet! However, when I returned to my room - the moth was nowhere to be found.I looked everywhere, but nothing. I presumed it had gone out of the window by itself.  The next night, at around 9.45pm, again I was on my pc chatting to a few people about some stuff - and I looked up, and it was back! The moth was staring down on me from the ceiling!  I ran and got some tissue, and tried reaching for it, made a jump for it, and YES, I'd got it! It still had life in it, I could feel it trying to escape my grip, I took a closer look, and it shot out and started flying around the room again.  It had rested on my wall this time, I wasted no time, I grabbed it! This time, it was mine! I quickly ran to the bathroom and flushed it down!  Tibsy 1 Moth 0  I'd just like to add I don't usually kill innocent insects, its just that moths ae so annoying and they can eat your clothes you know.   I used to have a Tarantula - sorta proving I'm not into killing insects and spiders. (Yes folks, a Spider is NOT an insect)  I'll blog again tomorrow - laters.

      Well folks, here it is, the second entry! :D  I totally forgot to update my blog, well, no, thats a lie. I couldn't be arsed - but I'm bored now, so I am doing.  Its WELL hot here today. In my room the temp is 24.5 degrees C (my clock has a digital thermometre (sp?) on it ;-) )  I'm gonna go outside in a bit and have a little kick about.  Since my last entry, I haven't done anything special. I went on one more jog, and then lost heart. I can't find it in me to continue the jogging - I'll try and go tomorrow morning, we'll see what happens.  My broadband is working finally - not sure if I wrote that in my first entry - I might have, but it don't matter. Its so damn fast, I've downloaded loads of videos since it was up (not  those sort of videos!!!)  Tomorrow, I'm going to revise a SOLID 5 hours for my Maths exam (mechanics module) that I have on friday. The subject is so hard, and I don't even properly understand it. So 5 hours a day, for 4 straight days = 20 hours, I should grasp it by then.  Im off - going to play football.  Bye!

       THE FIRST ENTRY!   Yeah, as it says above, this is my first entry to this blog thing.  My mate, Heather, told me to make this blog diary thing, shes sort of obsessed with me and needs to know everything I do, me being the kind, warm guy that I am, obliged :P  Well, at the moment I'm on Study Leave. My first exam is next friday, its on Maths Mechanics. ITS SOLID! I don't get hardly any of it, and will most probably get a D or E in it. Going to have to revise loads for it.  I recently got broadband (yeah yeah, I finally got it :D), but the damn thing won't work. The modem keeps flashing saying its waiting for a ADSL Signal, even hoguh the connection has been enabled by BT. My cousin is coming over tonight so hopefully he can sort it out for me, if not, he shall be having words with my ISP. (He's good at scaring people on telephones! lol)  This morning, I woke up at around 10am, and I went for a jog! I have been trying to get into an exercise regime for a while (around 6 months), but today it begun. I went for a little 15 minute jog, woohoo, but I was well tired after it, my heart was beating like a rapid drum.  From tomorrow, I'm going to wake up and do 30 press ups, 50 sit ups, then the jog, come back in and do 20 press ups, and 20 sit ups. I will do this EVERY morning for atleast the next 2-3 weeks. I can honestly say I'm not looking forward to it.  I'mabout to do some research for my Design Technology exam, and then I shall watch Eastenders! I can't stand Andy on it - he's worse than me! Glad to hear Janine is going down for a year, and EURGH, when will Vicky finally disappear?  Currently listening to: Michael Jackson - Stranger in Moscow.

Hope your job is going well, and get your arse on MSN sometimes!

      Today, was the first day I actually worked in the store where I will be workign. It had been shut for 5 weeks to undergo renovations.  The store looks good, nice and modern. Today we were filling the shelves up with stock. Went well, I worked hard *wink*. However, during the day, for no reason, one of the top sheves in the wines and spirits sections collapsed, and around 15 bottles of red wine fell to the floor and smashed!  It was a mess, red wine all over the last aisle (sp?) - terrible stuff.  Anyways - I worked for around 8 hours today and I'm knackered!  There is another worker there, he's a deputy manger from another store helping out, and he told me, that at his store, an employee once accidentally threw out some important papers. He got mad, so he made the guy go into the skip, and look for them :-d. Woohoo, how great is he, he said the employee was sik within two seconds - hahaha.  Big Brother last night was good - Victor is the man. I hate Emma more than ever, she thick, dumb, clearly mentally unstable, and a racist. How dare she say to Victor, "stop acting like a black man"  Right, im off - bye.  Currently Listening 2: Michael Jackson - Fly Away

      I'll start with saying England didn't deserve to lose last night. France were the better side - but the game should have ended in a draw. Some stupid mistakes cost us. But I can't help and wonder that if we had won, we'd never hear the end of it.  Today was the first day of work, well sort of, I had to go to the Somerfields in Royton, was ok. Had to stock up the alcohol section today though which I found hard. They have like 150 different kinds of Beer, Wine and so on, and my first day in the store. My superviser who was hardly ever around, just said put these bottles in their places. So I spent like 3 hours doing that. In the process I smashed two bottles of Reef I think it was, they were in a box that I thought was empty, the damn thing fell and smashed.  Thats all.  Currently Listening 2 nothing.

      Its here. What a great days first football.  I can't believe Portugal lost, it was only Christiano ronaldo and Deco who were actually doing some work in the second half. Tut.  Spain were lucky to win, Russia could have scored 3 goals in like 15 minutes. Torres looks like to be player who will reach great heights in the future, I think Manchester United should seriosuly consider sticking a bid infor him, the kid is only 20. I understand last year Man Utd put in a 20 million bid in for him but it was rejected.  Tonight, France against England. I want England to win, and they have th epotential. But come on people, this is France, they've got a star-studded squad, Henry, Pires, Viera and idance are just a few class players they have.  I have decided that I will give blood. It is an important thing to do in my opinion, a ridiculous amount of people die each year from the hospital not having enough blood - how sad. So i'm going to do my bit.  I am also from now, going to give much more generously to worth while charities. Charities that help people in Africa for instance. 1 in 3 children die every minute in Africa from a disease which can be stopped going around. The medication to prevent it only costs around £1-2.  Around 2 million children will die this year from diseases in Africa. There are over 60 million people in the UK. If just 1 in 6 people donated £1 to a charity which helps figt disease inAfrica, imagine the amount of innocent lives that would be saved. Our country, and other powerful countries should be spending money on helping them.  Instead, Tony Blair spends billions on a war in Iraq to find WMDs which were never there, gives himself a £47,000 pay rise - why, because he can.  The big loser over the sea, George Bush, gives Billions to NASA, so they can go and explore space, ok, yeah, it should be done, but there are more immediate and pressing issues in the world.  I also hope that Michael Moore's film documentary of G Dubbya,, Farenheit 9/11 is released in the UK - I so badly want to see it.  Right, im going out for a bit.  I'll update tomorrow and tell you about my first day at work.  Currently listening 2: Michael Jackson - Break of Dawn

      Yes folks, NO MORE EXAMS!  Yesterday, I had 3 exams, two Design Technology Exam which I feel went well, and a Maths exam which went ok too.  Today, I had two Chemistry exams, again, I feel I have done ok in them.  Im not expecting much results wise, if I just pass my subject I will be so happy.   Have you ever really liked a girl, I mean really liked her, and you both get on really well, but sometimes they are cold towards you? How annoying is it? Tut.  Found out a very cool piece of news today - but I am not going to say.  A guy I know from a MikeJackson Message Board, asked me that if I led a political party - what would my policies be? Here they are:  I would make this country more tougher, non of this BS.  If you are proved GUILTY in a murder case, you shall spend you WHOLE life in a jail cell, or if you wish, face the death penalty.  IF there is an immigrant in the country, and is taking part in fraud, he/she can **** off back ot their country.  Taxes will go UP. You cannot have good things, and then not expect to many much for them.  Congestion Charges - EXCELLENT idea, I would impose them in Manchester and Birmingham also.  Racists will face jail sentances.  Also, build a few new jails around the country that will be able to hold up to 5,000 more people. I don't want drug dealers, rapists, frauds, thugs on the lose getting let off with cautions or a fine.  I would also make 100% sure that parents ARE allowed to smack their children if needed.  Make sure women only work in kitchens! :P - lol just kidding.  Pretty nifty I reckon.  I have to make some shirts for some girls - one of them girls is cool, so I said I'll do one or two for her. It turns out im designing 10 shirts.   *Over and Out*  Currently Listenin 2: Outlandish - Walou

      Sup folks.  Well, as I type this, it is a ridulous 25.5 degrees celcium in my room, whats all that about?   For the past two days, I have been revising very hard.  I have a Maths (Pure 1) and two Design Technology exams, hopefully they'll go OK.  I've got two Chemistry exams on Thursday, Im dropping the subject after those exams, I don't need it, I don't like it, and I don't want to do it.  I start work next monday, which should be alright.  I spoke to my mum the other day about the possibillity of me going over to the USA around November/December time to go to Michael Jackson's Trial, I know he's innocent, but I want to be there to cheer for him when he comes and goes from the court room, and I want to boo when Tom Sneddon walks past. Hopefully my parents will allow me to go.  I need a hair cut, I haven't had one in like 7 weeks!!! I usually have one every 3/4 weeks, but some for some reason I aint had it cut for ages. I can get it to come down to the tip of my nose now. Might wear a hair band to school tomorrow - would be different.  I must go now, and do some more revision for my crappy exams. I'm probably going to end up re-sitting one or two of them, so I'm just not motivated to do the revision - sigh.  *Tibsy, has left the building*  Currently Listening 2: Michael Jackson - The Way You Make Me Feel.

      Today, I watched Harry Potter 3.  When we got there, there was a line waiting to go inside the cinema. I thought DAMN! I hadn't booked my tickets or anything,  so I was hoping there would be tickets for the time we were there.  Luckily, as I got closer to the line, I realised that the line was not actually that long, it seemed long because the  Cinema doors were locked. I had to wait around 10 seconds for the cinema top open, and YES! I got tickets for the showtime I needed :-D  It is an AWESOME film, really really good, better than the first two films I reckon. Can't wait for film four, and book six.  I gotta do more revision tonight, which is shit. I am certain of crap grades this year, so goign to have to work so hard next year, but I can do it.  Also, I hve got..wait for it..A JOB!  Its at Somerfields. I start there in around two weeks, I can't wait!  One final thing, why don't you people who read my blog leave comments? Let me feel my blog is being read, Ive got two comments - and thats it. Shamon people, I want comments!  Laters.  Currently Listening 2: NOTHING!

      Yesterday, on MJNI,&nbsp; a few people started their own blogs, won't go into who, nor will I give their blog address, but a shout out to them. &nbsp; My chat up lines (I don't have any really) have been compared to those that Victor from BB uses. Not sure whether to take it as a comliment.  &nbsp; Today is the first official day of my holidays, don't know what to do though. I have to cut the grass in&nbsp;a while (I'll do it after I've watched Neighbours) &nbsp; Also, does anybody have any idea of how you set your phone up so you can email a picture of yourself to your proper email address? If so, please tell. &nbsp; I'm going to start reading Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix again today, it'll be the fifth time of reading the book - its awesome. &nbsp; One has been trying to get in contact with a Manchester born artist, Chris Ofili, who know lives in London, so far, I haven't had much look. I want to speak to him though, I need to ask him some questions regarding my art project, he'll be part of my artist reference. &nbsp; Im off - going to cut the grass now actually, should finish it before Neighbours is on *hopefully* &nbsp; Bye. &nbsp; Currently Listening 2: The Streets - Dry Your Eyes

      Well ladies and gents, Im back. Its been ages sinc I last blogged, below are my reasons for not blogging: &nbsp; &nbsp;- Work &nbsp;- College &nbsp;- Big Brother &nbsp;- Chilling &nbsp; Work is going well, I got paid the other day, I recieved a wonderful £303 (I've just realised I've lost my wage slip :-) They underpaid me, I'm meant have got another 100 pound or so. I also realised I infact earn £4.60 in stead of the £4 I thought I was getting. &nbsp; On sunday, with work, there is this night out in a wannabe posh place in town. I don't really want to go,&nbsp; and one of the girls who is going really irritates me, so I'm not going to go, unless they let me bring some of my mates - which they won't. &nbsp; I broke up from college today, which is good. I get my AS Level results on the 19th of August, and I have a horrible feeling that I will get 4 straight E's, I can say honestly, that&nbsp; I am scared of getting my results. &nbsp; I found out yesterday and today that a girl is playing with me, I couldn't believe it. Some ofyou may know that I sometimes have more than one close lady ffriend if you get my drift. Anyway, now I've settled down, and I liked this girl right, I wasn't messing her around or anything, we were not official yet though, but anyway. Yesterday, another one of her "close" manfriends came to school, I was like what the ****! So she is a nothing now, when things get bad for her, and her other manfriend isn't around, or has split up with her, I will NOT be there to help her :-D &nbsp; Big Brother is kicking serious butt this year, I love it. Unfortunately, Nadia is still in the house. I don't like her, and want her to go, but yet I want her to stay so she can continue arguing with Jason. Soon, Jason, Ahmed and Victor will gang up on her - I can't wait. Ahmed was a hero this week. "Michelle, I need your jacket to take to the Diary Room" &nbsp; two minutse later, &nbsp; "Michelle, I am performing a Military Coup"  &nbsp; You go star. &nbsp; I'm going Pakistan for two weeks next Thursday, hopefully I'll find a decent diamond ring for myself thee, and a Jcaob and Co Watch. Both are sold here, but here in the UK there isn't any WOW factor with whats on sale. I want a Diamond ring for my little finger, and Imean a kick ass ring, with a face that is just smaller than a 5p coin. It'll be wicked if I ind one with Yellow diamonds as in, as they seriously sparkle. Over there, the economy is weak compared to this countries, things are so cheap over there. So its all good. &nbsp; I today realised that&nbsp; I may not be able to go to the MJ Trial, if it is around January, or if it isn't taking place during the Easter Holidays. There will be Modular Exam taking place in January which are important - as pointed out by my teacher today. &nbsp; This is one seriously long entry, so I best end it now, but before I do, I just want to say that our form tutor left school today, so we got him some presents and stuff - aawwww. &nbsp; I'll blog again soon, &nbsp; Currently Listening 2: R Kelly - You Saved Me
