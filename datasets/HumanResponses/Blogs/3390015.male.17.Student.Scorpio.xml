      The Silver Screen has always carried with it a sense of wonder.  This blog is devoted to one thing: movies.  I will review movies I have seen, giving each movie two scores that I will explain later...and will also comment on current and upcoming movies.  The first review will be: Troy  I saw this movie on opening weekend...and will post the review tomorrow...followed by the revelation of the next movie up for review.

      YAY!!!!!!! DOUBLE YAY!!!!!!!!  TRIPLE YAY!!!!!!!!    QUADRUPLE YAY!!!!!!    INFINITY YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!  The Timberwolves won, now all they have to do is win one in L.A., then come back and win Game 7 in Minneapolis, man I hope they can do it!!!  Update on my script:  I'm at 91 pages as of right now...I was going to finish it off tonight...but I figure I better sleep, anyway, all I have to do is write like ten more pages of the ending, which is already in my head, so IT WILL BE DONE TOMORROW!!!.....First rough rough rough rough draft of course, this will need serious revision, which is what week 2 is about, so...not bad to come up with a final draft of a movie in 2 weeks, I think that's pretty good, considering it took me like six months to get a final draft of my first one....sorry, now I'm just droning on and bragging....again, sorry....I guess the writing's been getting to me, 19,000 words will do that to a person.  OH!  Yesterday I saw The Day After Tomorrow, I'll post my review later, but despite some clunky dialogue, it was an awesome movie with uber-impressive graphics.

      My dad has been talking a lot to me about what personality type I am, and he's always trying to figure it out, and I've seen other people's blogs and buddy profiles having similar tests, so I figured it was time I took one:                     Introverted (I) 64.29% Extroverted (E) 35.71%  Realistic (S) 56.67% Imaginative (N) 43.33%  Intellectual (T) 65.63% Emotional (F) 34.38%  Organized (J) 58.82% Easygoing (P) 41.18%

      What a day!  The season finale of 24 is on tonight, the T-wolves play the Lake show tonight, and today was my last day of school!  Only one more year!  I've been planning this for awhile now...I'm going to lock myself in my room...if that's possible...and finish writing my screenplay...I've got all the ideas in my head and on paper, now I just need to type.  I'll only come out to eat, exercise, and go to the movies to watch The Day After Tomorrow...  I'm giving myself until this Monday to complete the bulk of the script, if I don't finish sooner...hopefully I'll finish sooner, much sooner.  Anyway, pray for me that I can get this done, because I want to send it out to a good Christian friend of ours in Hollywood, because I think it's a great script concept I have here, very clever...the plot of The Italian Job, The Score, and Mission: Impossible all wrapped into one, it basically takes the idea of Mission: Impossible one step further in terms of the plot, and has elements of The Score's cleverness, with a mix of The Italian Job's clever heists....

      I'm getting fed up with all the anti-Bush crap lately.  Bush is a good president and John Kerry is a pathetic at best candidate. I don't want to get into all the reasons why I like Bush, but I'm a firm supporter.  What's sad is people aren't "voting for Kerry," they're voting "against Bush."  And for those who think Kerry is a good candidate, check this out, he's done more flipping and flopping than a fish out of water...than a short order cook at 7 a.m...okay that's enough... Austin .   urlLink Kerry's Record   You know something else that makes me mad, I won't turn 18 until a few days after the election in November. Ahh!  I can't even vote for Bush!!

      Whoa...what a game Sunday night!  The Lake show was booed offstage by the likes of The Big Ticket & company.  Sprewell has been playing outstanding lately and Wally Sczerbiak can shoot lights out.  What an effort by the whole team, I applaud you T-Wolves.  Game 3 is Tuesday in L.A.  No one thinks the T-Wolves can win at the Staples Center...but I think they will definitely win!  It will be a fantastic game...one for the books...I cannot wait any longer, why can't it be Tuesday!!!!

      Hah! Random picture boy strikes again!  No, really...these are two shots from the movie "The Day After Tomorrow" which opens this Memorial Day weekend.  I strongly urge anyone who reads this to go see this movie simply because it looks visually stunning...and should be a pretty awesome movie with a stellar cast including Jake Gyllenhaal, Emmie Rossum, and Dennis Quaid.  For your enjoyment:        Sorry if the image quality isn't that great...I'm not too skilled at resizing and keeping image quality.  Please visit TheDayAfterTomorrow.com or Apple.com/trailers for quicktime versions of the trailers...they'll blow you away if you haven't already seen them.

      I just finished watching Jurassic Park on television, and I have to say, I really like this movie.   Not like I haven't seen this before.  First off, the original score is classic...I always find myself whistling that one song from the movie.  Second, it is based on the book by my favorite fiction author Michael Crichton.  Read the book folks, it is really awesome.  Oh!  Almost forgot, Wayne Knight is in this movie, he plays Dennis Nedry, the computer guy who tries to steal the dinosaur embryos.  And you know what other part Wayne Knight plays, NEWMAN FROM SEINFELD!!!!  One of the greatest sitcom characters ever on the single greatest sitcom ever!! Helloooooo  Newman !  P.S. Did you catch Cheaper by the Dozen, and see the new and improved Wayne Knight...he was the chandelier fixer dude and he has lost a ton of weight, no pun intended.

      It's really late...but I like to stay up, so it's no big deal.  And now, a late night poem:  The Walking Dead  Blind they walk, and bitter they talk. They are the walking dead.  False teachings they profess, and from the truth they digress. They are the walking dead.  The skeptics say they will believe when they see.  But, the truth they shall see, when they believe. They are the walking dead.  Lord please open their hearts. And let them see the truth and come to the father. So that they may no longer be the walking dead.  Elliott  [walking dead concept originated by my good friend David Stehlik] The walking dead are those who do not know Christ.

      Today was not the T-Wolves day...  Only one full day of rest and the Lakers had almost a week...this Game 1 loss was more than inevitable.  Come Sunday, it will be a whole different story. The Wolves were both mentally and physically drained from their emotional Game 7 victory less than two short days ago.  On Sunday, they will be rested and focused and the Lakers better watch out!  On a lighter note, only two half days and three exams away from freedom and the end of yet another school year.  Three down, one year to go.

      I was just thinking of some verses that I liked, and one in particular that suddenly made so much sense...here they are:  For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous. ~ Romans 5:19  ^I finally figured it out...when Adam sinned, death entered the world for all, and so did sin for all men who followed.  But, since Jesus died on the cross,  one man , many can enter the Kingdom of Heaven through Him. Amazing!  I could be off on my interpretation of that verse...but it makes sense to me.  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. ~ Psalms 23:4  ^another fantastic example of Scripture folks...

All I can think to say right now is that I want out of school...not in a couple days...now!  You know what else...something keeping my mind off of school tonight is Game 7 of the Timberwolves v. Kings series.  I am so pumped to watch it and I hope the T-wolves win huge.  The Big Ticket is going to have a big game...YOU BETTER WIN T-WOLVES OR I'LL MAKE FUR COATS OUT OF THE ENTIRE TEAM!!!!

      Have you ever thought about the deeper questions, such as the meaning of life [duh! I already know from the Bible], but those are the kind of questions that can hurt your head.  For example, we know that we do have a purpose, and there is more to our existence than this world...meaning God exists independent of us.  Then you get to the fact that God is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end...He is eternal...no beginning and no end...  ^That will boggle the mind.  Just think about it in succession:  1. We exist, we are conscious..."I think, therefore I am."  2. God brought us into existence supernaturally through his divine and everlasting power.  3. God is eternal, having no beginning nor end.  4. Wait...back up...no beginning nor end...eternal...let that sink in, and it will truly make your head hurt!  Our finite minds only know things to have a beginning and an end...so we seek to find what "caused" God or what is "beyond" God...and to our best knowledge, revealed to us in the Bible, we know that there is nothing but God, and that's where the bewilderment begins to set in.  I'll take something from the Matrix Revolutions: "Everything that has a beginning has an end."  That's all the world can understand, though there are few of us who can accept it [God is eternal] and understand it to a degree, but our minds are finite, and therefore we will never understand "eternity" without the help of God, hopefully this will be explained to our finite minds in Heaven!  There are lots of things that can easily boggle our finite minds, such as this simple example:  1. Our brain seeks to learn about itself, and succeeds - that's insane!   "Consciousness" is also mind boggling.  Some of these questions can really hurt your head if you think about them to hard!  *Disclaimer* I am not responsible for headaches, migraines, or any other ill related to reading and then thinking about these uber-complicated ideas.

      I'm back after a eventful two week vacation.  There is honestly too much to type out in one post, so I'll outline it and then maybe elaborate more in subsequent posts.  We drove to the airport, flew out of Tampa, landed in Chicago, shopped, saw homeless people...including the infamous "Buckets" [the guy on the bridge playing the bucket drums...He goes "ratta-tat-tat -spare change!-ratta-tat-tat {classic}], stayed at an awesome hotel, rented a car, drove to Iowa, stayed with grandparents, ate at the canteen which is located under a parking garage, went to some garage sales, grandma made bad eggs and I got sick, drove up to the Twin Cities, met cousins, played drums {didn't go too well, but I had some moments of brilliance}, played volleyball, had TONS of fun, drove to Grandma's, went to Half-Price books {the coolest bookstore on the planet} and bought a new Bible and some other books, ate like there was no tomorrow, went up to the North Shore, stayed in an awesome resort on Lake Superior, went sea-kayaking and hiking {kayaking is awesome!}, drove down to Duluth Minnesota, toured this giant ship that transported iron ore, saw an IMAX flick, drove back to the Twin Cities, went garage saleing there {didn't find a thing, people had lots of crap}, ate like there was no tomorrow again, drove to Chicago, flew back to Tampa, then drove home.  Whoa...  We drove around 2000 miles, flew around 2200 miles.  I also read a ton of books, reading approximately a page for every two miles we drove, just as reference. These are the books I read:  1.  Mere Christianity  - C.S. Lewis 2.  Reasons  {skeptics should consider christianity} - Josh McDowell 3.  The Screwtape Letters  - C.S. Lewis [only 33 pages] 4.  The Signature of God  - Grant Jeffrey [pretty good, some questionable material] 5.  Four Views on the Book of Revelation  - Various - [now I know all the angles, I would say I'm probably a "classical dispensationalist"] 6.  On the Seventh Day  - Various - [only 83 pages, good, but "In Six Days" the first one, was way better] 7.  Legacy  - Rich Lowry - [A great Clinton bashing! -- only 215 pages]  More later, and maybe pictures!

      Instead of discovering a new world, I have discovered a new show on MTV that rivals Punk'd and it's called "Boiling Points." Apparently it's been on for awhile, and I've never seen it until today, the commercials said it's on at 4 during the week I think.  But it's an awesome show!!  Sort of like Punk'd, but a little different premise, these improv actors rip people off in various situations and then the hidden cameras see how long people can keep their cool without leaving or swearing at the actor, once they do, they get nothing, but if the person can keep their cool, they win a Benjamin.

Which classic Nickelodeon show are you? - Wild and Crazy Kids 3. Which book of the Bible are you? - Romans 4.

      It has been forever since I've posted...I guess I just got caught up in the freedom & laziness of summer.  A lot has happened!  I finished the rough rough draft of my movie, and am now in the tedious, painful, and even harder than the writing the first draft of REVISION!  The Timberwolves lost of course...oh that makes me so mad, but there's always next year!!  I've been reading "Are We Living in the End Times?" by Tim Lahaye & Jerry Jenkins...it's pretty good, a little childish in writing style, but I guess that makes it sorta easy to understand.  I've always been fascinated with the book of Revelation, it's an awesome book that is underrated! And though we may NOT be living in the end times, our generation really does have more reason to believe so than any other previous one.  Since I find revision on my script pretty difficult, I am not wasting any time and moving full steam ahead on other projects...such as my feature length mockumentary, and a movie entitled "Narrow House" that I think will be my best to date, though rather difficult to write.  Next week, I head off to Chicago...one of the coolest cities in the world, and then on to Iowa to see my grandparents, then onto Minnesota to visit my grandma, cousins, other family, and to visit Bethel College because I'm thinking of possibly attending...for many reasons, mainly because it's Christian school and it's in Minnesota...and I was born in Minneapolis and love the twin cities and MN in general, so I hope it works out.  So, I'll be going away for almost two weeks, starting next week.  au revoir! adios! arrivederci!

      Hmmm...that stupid Garden State site isn't working again, I can't concentrate!  Anyway, picked up some great books for cheap at this new overstock remainder type bookstore downtown, it's a great place. Here's what I got:  1. Jurassic Park - now I already have this, but there is this special large paperback matte cover edition that I just had to have, because it doesn't wear out after multiple reads or rough handling -- I have one other like it, Sphere.  2. Schindler's List - it looked cool and it was a similar edition to the one above, so why not? It's the novel.  3. Poems by C.S. Lewis - these poems look awesome.  4. LOTR - Fellowship of the Ring - this is an interesting story, I have the hobbit, the two towers, and the return of the king all in this special edition with the same covers and everything, but I never had the first of the trilogy, and now I've completed the collection!!   Now back to typing, I'm halfway done...but I'll have to do extensive revising over the next few days or week. Oh well, it's part of the game...  I'm kind of zoned out right now, I don't know why...

      The script is going absolutely great...it's hilarious imo...a lot better than say Dodgeball which I just saw today...it was funny at times, but mostly sick humor that wasn't even funny. I'm out to show Hollywood you can make a hilarious movie without all the nasty stuff, mine is just straight up funny.  I'm trying to write and now I'm mad! It all started when I wanted to have some nice repeating music to listen to, so I vistited the Garden State website to have some surreal music to get my mind in the writing zone so to say, but NO! The site has been changed somehow in literally the span of one day. There were special features, pics, desktops, all kinds of crap last time, and the music, the music wasn't there this time, nor was any of that other stuff!  Oh the humanity!

      30 pages done on the new script, and it's pretty darn hilarious if I must say so myself...but then again I'm very bias.  Anyway, throughout the whole process, I listed to "In My Heart" by Moby a total of 80 times according to windows media player.  And all tonight...and early morning...I've probably listened to the same amount of music from the Garden State website, I just went there, and cool music started playing, and I didn't stop it...;)  Anyway, I listened to "Take Me Out" by Franz Ferdinand and was instantly hooked, it's an incredible song, I might have to buy the CD, it's only 8.99 at BestBuy!

      I've reverted back to taking extensive notes on my Narrow House Script, drama is just so hard to write!!  But I'll get it right soon.  Anyway, I've switched gears to where my talents seem to be, comedy, as evidence by my first ever screenplay, the every-funny "Racewalkers." And now, I'm cruising along on my new comedy, like 20 pages already, because comedy just flows for me for some reason...  Anyway, it's tentatively called "Murphy's Law" because that's what the movie is based on, but man! somebody already took that title, and Salma Hayek is in it, and it's in production right now!! Oh the humanity!!  So, I'm going to have to change the title, I'm open to suggestions, trust me, but I was thinking something like simply "Murphy" or "Murphy Was Right" or who cares, I can figure that out later, plus I don't even think the name Murphy should be in the title, now I'm just babbling, but the movie is about three groups of people, and everything instinctively goes wrong for them, and somehow their paths all cross and in the end, and then...well thats for me now isn't it....  Also:  For some reason, I wish I owned these songs, because I have to settle for repeatedly clicking on the 30 second preview for my useless iTunes [no iPod!]  1. Float On - Modest Mouse  2. Sic Transit Gloria - Brand New  Both not the greatest in terms of lyrics probably, but some of the most unique and original beats around.  3. Rest in Pieces - Saliva  Their only good one, just brilliant.

       urlLink The Way of the Master   This is a great site for learning to evangelize in your everyday life, which can sometimes be hard, it's hard for me, and it's hard for most people. Check out the video clips, which are actually entire shows [might have to enter the high speed site].  Kirk Cameron is the man in my opinion, and I love to see people who are or used to be in the public light that are men and women of God.  Let me tell you, Hollywood is the most liberal place on Earth, God doesn't factor in to 99% of these people [+-3%...jk], and they may fool you by saying they have faith, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out they aren't sincere. So, it's good to see a star [Growing Pains - duh!] that has true and real faith in God and has decided to share that faith and be vocal about it!

      I watched this movie awhile ago, and I was so intrigued by the music of this movie, particulary the main title sequence, in which a remarkable guitar song is heard.  The movie wasn't like the best of all time but it sure is an important film and pretty good, one of those deep character movies from the '60's which are so good. Plus, Paul Newman is a fantastic actor. Particularly, and this has happened in other movies, most notably in my mind "Of Mice and Men," where a montage of shots of a main character smiling, laughing, etc., is done at the end, and I find that very powerful in Cool Hand Luke in the ending and the aforementioned film, and I'm going to try and incorporate that into my screenplays because I find it very effective in evoking emotion and care for a character who has suffered some unfortunate end.  Here's the link to listen to a clip from the soundtrack, try tracks 1, 10, 12, and 18, it may be an acquired taste, but I find the music to be very enjoyable.

      I like the 4th...I'm very patriotic...and I'd like to show it through this quick slide show:     Just kidding...onto the real stuff...     I pledge allegiance...        Good ol' Dubya...gotta love him...[he gave a nice speech today!]              What's more American than fireworks, baseball, and apple pie?   ...BEAN?  My father and I rented "The Best Bits of Bean" today and I literally cried laughing so hard at the antics of the notoriously hilarious Mr. Bean.        Whoa...barely got this in on the actual day!  Oh...almost forgot...the greatest firework ever...the saturn missile battery...man this brings back good times...       [images hosted by imgspot.com - brilliant site]

      I have been waiting so long for these, and finally we went to this huge mall and got them! They're so awesome that I felt they needed to be a part of this blog.  And now, without futher adieu, I give you:  The Adidas a3 Ultraride!      These have been my previous kicks, and I can't even think of throwing them away, they've been so good to me, the best shoes I've ever had, and they were designed specifically for Kevin Garnett! Sort of space agey - and they're the most comfortable shoes ever made!

      Turn up the volume on your speakers and hopefully you have a cable modem!  DOH! Had a link up here, but it just wouldn't work!  Anyways, if anyone wants to follow these directions, and I STRONGLY suggest you do, here they are:  Plan B  1. Go to www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/theoffice/ 2. Click on the "clips" on the left 3. Scroll down, click on "David Brent: Renaissance Man" 4. Click on "dancer" 5. Enjoy dry humor  This is dry British humor at its best!  Fawlty Towers wasn't bad either...for a British show.  Hmm...been looking at some poetry for help with my new script...and this came to mind, one of my favorite poems, probably one of the best ever written:      Hmmm...there's something suspect about this photo...;)   The Road Not Taken     by Robert Frost   Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth;  Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same,  And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back.  I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-- I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.  *End*  On a side note...this is what some "clever" testmakes think tests kids on their intelligence...I say...give me a break:  If all Zips are Zoodles, and all Zoodles are Zonkers, then all Zips are definitely Zonkers.  True or False  Well?!

      It has recently come to my attention that Boy Meets World has begun airing on the ABC Family network. Yes, I loved that show, especially the Halloween episode with Jennifer Love Hewitt...dun, dun, dun...I'm done.  Here's another classic Eric line: Ouchi Mcgouchi bro!  Feeny!     You know what also just came to my mind...and I felt compelled to type...was the classic show "Get Smart." Brilliant show! "They shot the wrong dummy..." -- "The cone of silence" The cone of silence...LOLOLOLOL...so classic!           While on the topic of brilliant shows..."Welcome Back Kotter" is a definite classic.      On a side note, saw "el hombre de la araña 2." Also known as Spiderman 2, and it was really good...9/10...I like the spidey series, it's a hundred times better than Hulk or the pathetic Daredevil...but unfortunately it's no match for the ultimate comic book hero of mine [though I don't read comics]...Blade!      And now...*drum roll please*...  First there was "Blade"      Then there was "Blade II"      And come this December..."Blade: Trinity"     The trailer is up on the official site...bladetrinity.com...if anyone cares...it's in quicktime! :)  On a side side note...I think I'm going to accompany each idea in subsequent posts with a photo of some sort like above...I think it's cool and gives this blog more dimension.
