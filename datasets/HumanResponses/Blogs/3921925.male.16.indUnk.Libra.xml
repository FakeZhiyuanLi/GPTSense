      One thing I can't stand: lesbians.  one thing I REALLY can't stand: lesbians who hate the internet!  I think they only hate the internet because they find it hard to type through their lover's vaginal membrane. Maybe if they stopped FISTING the girl, and TYPED, they would have better luck!  that is, if they weren't all fat with sausage fingers incaipable of typing less than 3 letters at once..

         On one of the first days, there was light (or something).   Now there are giant isopods, and with them comes the end of human reign.  I wish it could be prevented, but not even Sean Connery in his Zardoz attire can stop this one.

      One might remember when everything in the world was black and white.  All you have to do it turn on the TV and switch to a channel showing old shows, and there's the proof.  This is my black and white tribute, getting rid of all that halabaloo about color.  Seems there's a bit of an octo fetish here too...     PS - the weird thing on the bottom is him spinning a plate on a stick.  FYI
