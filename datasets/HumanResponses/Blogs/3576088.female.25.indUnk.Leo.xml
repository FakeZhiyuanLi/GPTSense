      Just came home from my great-grandmother birthday dinner. Every time go to these kind of dinner, more than half the people you don't know from where one. Then you start to think how come ur relatives so many either is Ah Lian/ Ah Hua /Ah Beng/ Ah Seng or just cannot ' tah han ' the face. Heeehee!!! I got attitude lah, so see some people 'buay song'. But I not so bad, cos I still know a few aunties who are close to my mummy. Just think the younger generation sucks. Maybe I am really getting old liao. Haaahaaa!!!   How many young people these days know their relatives. When small that time, Chinese New Year still very 'on' go visit relative to collect Ang Pow. Now grow up liao, ask them to go,you wait long long. Everyone will still do it when there is still an elder in the family. When old one bye bye, that's the end. You won't get to see the other person again, unless got major event. I think funeral is the most major one cos wedding, not all will turn up but funeral most will go. Maybe they scared the dead will come look for them if they never pay their last respect. Sometimes, human relationship is just so sad. Sigh.........

      Don't think many people thought Portugal was going to win ( I didn't hold much hope too), but then they did. They were down by 1 goal in just 3 mins but they never gave up. They went fighting for the equaliser and got it. Bookies must be laughing all the way to the bank cos dun think many will bet on draw.   The match went all the way to penalty shoot out. Beckham missed, yet again. It wasn't his fault cos Portugal missed one too. Portugal keeper managed to block one and get one into the England net. They won!!!!!   Well, the moral of the story is never give up trying. You never know till you try and even if you did lose or fail in the end, you can still hold your head up high for putting in your best effort.   Time passes very quickly, even when you have nothing much to do. What have I done?Mmmm............. Mon: Dinner with friends (Tamp Mall) Long time never meet, just eat and chat nonsense. Well, ML as usual talk shop. RL found new job, something related to what she learnt. All the best to her. Hope she gets to meet nice colleagues and boss. As for LI, she has moved into her new house and getting ready for her wedding in Oct. She told us she took wedding picture liao.   Tue: Karaoke with friends Wah! Tell also no one will believe. Fang, wen and I went to karaoke on Tue. Meet at 9am eat breakfast then started singing from 11am until..................7pm. Are we siao or what? We went to K-box. The songs are new but then the price is a little more ex compared to some.   Wed: Cook dinner  Mum went out, so I cook dinner. Got chicken with chilli, fry vegetables and one toufu with minced meat gravy.   Thu: Cycling After tution, I bring my cousins go cycling. We cycle to Pasir Park, then they play there for a while. Went to bed at 9pm, then wake up watch the match. Now sleepy liao, going to sleep.    Still looking for job, newspaper sian sian one. Nothing interesting. More jobs on the net these days. Sent a few but not sure how. Not working, no $$$$ to use but think of working also.......@#@#^$$#&. Can don't work still got MONEY not?????

      Now is 4 plus in the morning. Watch 'live' telecast sports till now. First is the F1 racing and then Portugal v Spain match. The F1 very exciting, got a few accidents and challenges between cars. Nice! As for soccer, guess what? Portugal won, score is 1:0 exciting match cos both teams playing attack, many scoring chances. Very happy cos at last a team I support won. Maybe my luck starting to get better.   Today went to downtown east. Wah! So many people go to the water theme park like no need $$$$$ like that. Singaporeans really "kiasu", got new things, first to go see and try, like scared the theme park will run like that. Some more got the Barney show, so many children, scary man! But people selling things there very happy, got business. Anyone of you thinin of going? Better go after school holidays or wait till the craze die off a bit then go. If not need to queue a long time, no fun liao.   Think I better go to bed liao. Tomorrow, no lah should be today still got tution and then later having dinner with ML they all. Not sure I can 'tah han' not. Better leave after dinner not I too tired to go out on Tue, especially you all meet so early. Never spare some thought for the poor person who stay at Pasir Ris. Sigh...... Nite Nite!!!!!

      Well......nothing changed, television is my greatest companion for these few days. Other than that, its tution and copying recipe from books I borrowed from library. I've made the pineapple tarts I've always said I wanted to make. Not bad, give some for you all to try the if got chance(meeting you all before all eaten up).    My class starting next week and guess what. It is Sat class. SIAN......... But then it means that I have a free night on weekday. When we going to Karaoke again? Wen and I did not go to K-box on Mon. Pick a day, then we go enjoy the $5+++. Sometimes singing is good. Shout away all the troubles (boss and money). At least we don't have relationship problem. We are so lucky. LOL!!!! Or is anyone here having problems, but I wasn't told bout it?????  Feel free to share your problems and let me help you solve your problem with no charges. Just a free meal will do.   Yanhua called me today regarding of going on a short trip but then too bad I can't cos class starting next weekend. She also talked about going to Vancouver next year in July. Not bad, at least got something to look forward to. Long time never travel liao........sigh........miss.........  Think of taking language course after I complete my course. What is the best??? Learning Chinese rite? China big market. But kind of funny to learn Chinese. Maybe take business Chinese. Don't know lah. Just nothing better to do, so start to think about all this. Learn also must learn something useful. If not language then maybe cooking. Any suggestions on what to learn? Computer? Repairs?   I got look for job the past few days but never send anything out yet. Not that I am choosy or lazy hor. Just nothing catches my eye and so I never send anything. Promise to send out resume as soon as I find something I like, wish me luck.

      Support Portugal, Portugal lost, support Lakers, they also lost......damn suay! Next time you all just bet the other team and you'll sure win $$$$$. But remember to give me a treat when u win $$$$$.   Been watching TV the whole morning, before I went out. Switching between the NBA finals, Oprah show, re-run of X Files, 'xi(4) shuo(1) qian(2) long(2)','pu(1) shui(3) yuan(1)   jia(1)' and MTV (Chinese and English), see how interesting my life is. Jealous not???LOL!!!  Going out tomorrow, after that no more programs for the week, except tution......tution.....tutition and tution. Anyone got any interesting suggestion??? Remember to ask me along when you all got interesting activity. Don't like today, 'fang(4)fei(1) ji(1)', only left Victor. Although I very good player, u all also no need scared and run off mah.Heeeee......   Life can be very boring when u are not working and are poor (like me). Today never buy Straits times so cannot look for job, tomorrow must remember to buy papers. If drag and drag, end of the year also never find job, then will 'Kana' nagging and scolding from some of you. I know you all concern but then......sometimes I don't even know what I want. Should I get part-time and concentrate on my project and tution? Or should I get a perm job and at the same time do my project and tution (like in the past)? Sigh......sian ah...... Too much thinking give me headache. Time to go relax.

      Ysterday (Fri), went for lunch, cut hair and chit chat a bit, half day gone. At home a little boring, nothing much to do. Watch TV, bake things, surf and play games, find recipe.   So sad that Lakers lost the match yesterday. Hopefully they can win the next match and tie the series. If not, they might not win the championship. Now got soccer to watch also. The game already start liao. I want Portugal and Spain to win.   Never do anything much today(Sat). Read book, bake cheesecake and play mahjong. I long time(3-4 wks) never play mahjong liao but still lousy luck. Maybe du(2) too much shu(1) for the past 2 wks, that's why keep losing. Lost bout $15 this afternoon but just now managed to win back $1. Lousy rite???   Ok lah. Go to watch my soccer match liao.

      Don't know why my leg suddenly painful yesterday,now a little better but still pain when I walk. Become 'bai(1) ka(1)'(hokkien)liao. Hope my leg will be ok by 2morrow. If not, Sunday go out how to walk???   Nothing to do much yesterday to do yesterday. Just went to  NTUC buy ingredients to bake cake then go tution. Today will be a little better cos later got basketball match (I want Lakers to win)and then going to meet Adeline and the guys for lunch. Hopefully this time they won't make me wait so long and in the end go up to food court again but also never mind lah cos I long time no eat the food there liao.      REST......REST......RECOVER!!! REST......REST......RECOVER!!! REST......REST......RECOVER!!! REST......REST......RECOVER!!! REST......REST......RECOVER!!! REST......REST......RECOVER!!!  REST......REST......RECOVER!!!

      Haaa!!! Can't begin to say how happy and relief I am feeling with the exams over. Time for planning all the fun stuff. Rest for a week or so then got to settle down to start looking for job cos my reserves is getting thinner and thinner (sob...sob).    Don't know what to do leh. Why must people work? And worse of all get so little even though we work so hard. Sometimes it is just so sad to be human. How many ppl really enjoy what they do? Most ppl work for $$$ and that is so sad but then no $$$ also sad, so? Most people rather work for $$$ and be sad rather then to be sad cos no $$$. Any sense at all??? So what kind you would prefer to be?   If I have a choice, I would go for something I like but then..... when you see people enjoying ( dinner, travel, big house, car)cos they have $$$$, u start to feel sad. Humans are so contradicting. Maybe it is time for human to be extinct and let the dinosaurs roam earth again. I think I sound like the evil character in movies who wants to take over the world. But believe me that I am doing it, for the good of mankind. OR......maybe I siao liao. HEEEEEE!!!!!!HEEEEEE!!!!! (evil laugh)

      One year liao......... time passes very fast. Last year about this time, I was going through a sad time. However, I was lucky to have someone to talk to and help me through it. I believe none of my friends have seen me cry or sad cos I have this belief, not to burden friends with problems and sadness. However, this person has seen me cry for don't know how many times and helped me alot during that period of time. Adeline, thank you for being there for me, talking and making me feel better. Like I always say, you may be long-winded and nag at times but I know that's because you care. Also grateful to friends who have listened to my complaints and gave me valuable advice.  Soon, I will be living here for one year liao. Sometimes, I miss my own home. Not that I am not happy here, just that its still not my 'home'. At my house, I can just leave my cup lying around, put my legs on the coffee table, fight for TV channel.........etc. But here cannot and because I am the eldest among the children, I feel like I should take care of them and be 'nice'. Well, at least they are nice to me too, so not so bad. Think it was easier for my sis to be the elder sister to me cos she only has me and I am such a nice, cute, obedient younger sister, isn't she lucky??? lol  Well..... I am stuck here for the time being and may be for at least months to come.  Sigh...... It may be nice living in a big house but I think I rather have my freedom cos freedom is priceless.

      Portugal is in the finals. All 3 goals scored by them but one is own goal so the score is 2:1. Waiting for the press conference, so come here talk talk a bit. Stupid Paul keep wanting them out cos he know I like Figo but then ........... I got the last laugh (at least for now).  Fang, July liao, have u made a decision about ur resignation? I haven't read ur blog for the past few days so I don't have any updated news bout that. U leaving for Japan today is it? Take care and if got $$$$, remember our presents. Haa!!  Go to check my press conference liao.
