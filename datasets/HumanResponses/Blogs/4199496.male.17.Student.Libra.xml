      My first name is Benjamin. Maybe it's just me, but I think thats an awefully boring name. When you toss my middle name into the mix, Michael, it just is that much worse. My name sounds like I'm some constipated British accountant or something. Don't get me wrong, I don't have anything against the British. Frankly, they kick ass. But I just don't want to be named like one. Make sense?  Who knows. Haha more about me/my life/etc etc.  Well. I live in Erie, PA, which is a nice little town on the coast of Lake Erie. Most people in Erie think it sucks and is uber-boring, but then again most have never lived anywhere else, so their perspective is off. By a whole lot. In reality there's a lot to do in Erie, and it's within 90 miles of Cleveland, Buffalo, or Pittsburgh - all fairly big cities - so we're definitely not lacking a whole lot in terms of entertainment.  I live with both of my parents and my sister, although she's heading off to college in a couple weeks. I'm looking forward to that. I love her and all, but she's a huge distraction to me and my life...unintentionally, most of the time. Yeah. I also have two cats. They're super sweet, but the sad thing is they're getting old so they only have a couple more years with us. :(  What do I like to do with my life?! I'm REALLY into music. I love to perform, and I love to watch and listen to others perform as well. My favorite style of music? Anything. From classical to rock to blues to rap to techno to baroque, it doesn't matter. I feel it all. I also try my hand from time to time with writing my own stuff. I have a feeling it'd work out better if I actually knew how to write music though. Maybe I'll work on that some day.  I used to play the piano, but I gave that up when I started the trumpet. I've stuck with the trumpet and have become really pretty great at it, if I'm allowed to brag a bit. It wasn't until the ninth grade that I really began to understand how much I loved music.  For the record, I'm going to be a senior in high school this fall. But more on that later.  Back to music. I perform in wind ensembles, brass ensembles, symphony orchestras, concert bands, marching bands, a ska band, and this little, incredible thing known as drum corps. I didn't actually get to participate this summer though, which was a MAJOR blow to me...I'm still recovering from that, but moreso from the reasons that kept me from being in it. Maybe I'll elaborate on those reasons later on. But all in all, I love music and am certain I want to dedicate a sizeable portion of my life to it and/or those also involved in it.  Along with music, I love dance and theatre, movies, and art of all sorts. I suppose I'm just a real artsy type of guy - - you know, the type who wears black turtlenecks and frequents galleries and exhibitions and coffee houses...except that I don't own any black turtlenecks or anything like that at all. I wish I had a friend who enjoyed these same things. Unfortunately I don't. So I go back and forth between going solo and with people who are just pretending to have a good time.  Blah.  Friends.  I have some great friends!  I know A LOT of people, and luckily I'm versatile enough to maneuver between different circles and cliques.  But this is a huge stress sometimes too, making time for my friends and keeping up with everything and everyone.  I manage though.  As for really really close friends, I have not that many people.  Two or three maybe, which is all one really needs I suppose, but the problem is with these close friendships, there are certain....things/complexities/histories...that get in the way sometimes.  It's a complicated thing, one I want to work through really soon.  That's all I've got in me to write for now...I'm really tired.  Well, it is nearly 3:30am.  I've got to wake up in five hours to get things prepared for tomorrow:  my ska band is recording our album!  I' excited and a bit nervous about that.  Hmm, I'll see how it goes, I guess.

      I think it's time to start a brand-spankin' new online journal!  I've been writing in one pretty faithfully for the past three years, since the start of high school, but for some reason recently I've had this gut instinct to give it up and start a new one.  Maybe my subconscious is telling me it's ready to start a new chapter in life, and that it doesn't want the undercurrent from the past dragging me down.  Does that make any sense?  Is that weak of me?  Both are questions I hope to answer some day...  I'll continue to write, because I need to write.  It's helpful and I enjoy it.  So that's why I'm here.  My friend Thomas has a BlogSpot journal and it looked pretty, and I'm attracted to pretty things.  Yep.  Aesthetically pleasing is always a plus in my book.  So is being easy to use - which so far BlogSpot seems to be as well.  So, here we go.  I'm off on a new journey, recording it in a new journal, and standing at the threshold of a new portion of my life!  Stay tuned, this is about to get real exciting...
