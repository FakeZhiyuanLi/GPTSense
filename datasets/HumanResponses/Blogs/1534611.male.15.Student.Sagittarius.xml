      In the car My thoughts are shuffled I feel like the king of spades In a deck of cards Playing the card game of war Two players only The gunman and I  I remember The tears she shed First clear like water Then red like wine I draw a card The queen of hearts  I remember I gave her my heart So long ago The gunman draws a card  I remember Her freighted face As I watched her last tear Roll down her gentle cheek It hung on her chin But then started falling The gunman slams the card on the table The ace of spades  I remember She started to shed red tears As her body fell into his deck Anxiously the gunman pulls out another card The queen of spades  I remember He lifted me up Put the gun to my head It was still warm From her red tears He looked arround suspiciously He had the face of a cheater Hiding a card in his sleeve He looked towards the police His lips moved But I don't remember the words I was to focused on the next card I lift it up, Hoping  I remember When I turned arround Grabbed the gun Twisted it from his hand And ran towards the police I played the king of spades    ----------------------  Poem I wrote in grade 9... This is the original copy I wrote on paper, I wanna fix it up and make it even better :)  ...only poem i ever wrote, and I hope to keep it that way :p

The former are forever lashing out at each other in anger, furious and naked, tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth.

      Well roughly 3 hours ago my friend dropped his dog off at my house for 3 weeks. Automatically I saw a change in my dog and learned so much more about the new dog. To sum everything up, let's do a little introduction to each of the dogs.     My dog - Mika   urlLink    Here is my dog in all of it's glory. My dog is almost 3 years old and was adopted from the shelter by me when it was 4 months old. This is quite possibly one of the friendliest dogs ever. Heres a list of FACTS! wooo!  -Female (bitchin') -Labrador/Doberman mix -Yellow eyes dark/light brown fur -Lives for table scraps...Will eat anything she see's us eating -Also lives for greeting people at the door... and very friendly with guests... sometimes TOO friendly. -Hates when I grab her feet -Would never hurt anyone except for me. (aww the love!) -Loves to go swimming in creeks, lakes, and rivers. Not in the pool.     Coco   urlLink    Here is coco walking into the computer room for the first time. He is 5 years old (I think.) and is very strong and very loyal.  -Male(ewww genitalia) -Labrador/German Sheppard/Husky and other stuff! this dog is a giant mutt! but he has alot of labrador in him. -Very obedient and smart (it can play dead!) -Loves to be pet, SUCKS UP ALOT -Very protective of his food... it's scary. -Drools alot -Also loves greeting people at the door (but mika is more anxious about it!)     How They Interact.    THE BAD      Jealousy- Coco becomes extremely jealous when I start petting Mika, and automattically pushes in. Luckily Mika has no problem with sharing anything with other dogs, so it's okay. However, I notice Mika growled at Coco when he rand infront of her as she was greeting my Dad.  Protective- Mika is not very protective of anything, she actually shares everything with no problem, however Coco is very protective of his food. I put out two bowls with their own food in each one... at first both dogs went to Mika's bowl and there was no problem, then I called Coco over for his food... Mika of course followed him... and Coco snapped, automatically the fangs were out and the deep growl came. Coco bit Mika on the ear, Mika yelped and ran away from Coco (and avoided him for a few minutes). I have made a plan to feed them one by one in diffrent spots to avoid and problems.  Hormones- Coco keeps trying to score with my dog... It's hard to keep him off her, but so far I haven't let Coco do anything to her... but it doesn't matter, they're both spayed and neutered!      THE GOOD    Friendly- Aww, they're so friendly! they play and play and play! They were always happy to see eachother before, and now they get to spend all this time together!! *awww* . They're both energetic and love playing, it's fun too watch.  Leader- Coco is definatly the leader amongst the two. Mika follows Coco's lead all the time, infact, she sits and lays down alot faster then before, she just looks at Coco and does the exact same thing. It's a good thing.  Similiar Personalities - Except for some things, they are very similiar. They are both the same size and both are mainly labradors. They both react to things in general the same way and they both listen to me in the same manner.       In General  So basicly, except for a little more noise, responsibility and plastic bags with poop in them, nothing will really change. They're both really good friends and they seem to be having alot of fun. I'm glad Coco has learned to listen to my commands and Mika has been learning to listen to me faster, looking at Coco as an example. Also, Lilo and Stitch has taught me a nifty trick. Spraying water at a dogs face and yelling "No!" is a very effective way of getting your dog to listen to you. Well I'm sure I'll have stories to tell by the end of the 3 weeks about these two beasts.

       urlLink    Well I started to work on a layout and nothing came out of it yet, I've decided that I'm gonna keep this layout and eventually I'll just slowly add stuff onto it, seeing as I like the colours on this blog at the moment and It makes it easier and more convenient for me. Anyways, here's what I was gonna use instead of the text in the box at the top, BUT, decided not too. Maybe I should work on a top banner REALLY hard and then start a theme from there, I was thinking of creating some crazy retro cartoons in photoshop. But we'll see how that turns out :) As for now, I'm gonna add a radio blog and a friends list linking my friends blogs, journals, xangas and such.

       urlLink toothcake's Live journal... hah.  I've noticed that blogger doesn't have such a strong community such as LiveJournal... infact the blogger community is pretty crappy. I really wish blogger used friend lists such as LiveJournal and Xanga. However, after playing arround with livejournal for a good 30 minutes I quickly learned blogger's service is alot more capable and meets my needs.  Using a "blogspot.com" journal, my blog doesn't get much attention, but the friend lists in LiveJournal helps people keep updated, so since noone is being updated on my updates (whoa) noone reads anything here. I really dislike how blogger hasn't set up any "blogger community" options, but I am sure they will do it soon.  I wanna switch to LiveJournal for the community, however Blogger has some options that are of a valuable asset to me.  1.Fully customizable layouts (Yea I should be updating the layout soon) 2.Free image host, and it's great! 3.My google toolbar has a little button that allows me to write things down quick.  These are some great services that are brought to me by Blogger, but for god sakes, GET A COMMUNITY GOING! I wanna be able to interact more with other 'bloggers' and have my webblog open for people all the time. I didn't start posting stuff on the internet so noone reads it, theres a purpose to it.  I'd mention Xanga, but xanga just sucks in my opinion. So theres my rant, and blogger it is.   IN OTHER NEWS!  Today I officially finished watching Lilo and Stitch for the 3rd time, such a great movie, and I always laugh really hard at the part where Stitch yells "Happy Hanukah!"... what a character   And speaking about illegally downloading movies, I'm having great difficulties tracking down Requiem for a Dream, whenever I start downloading, the file ends up either corrupted or the download gets canceled, grrr... I'll just have to watch it at some friends house.  Last few days I haven't done anything special, trying to find a good .ca domain and a good host for the cheapest price (please comment if you know one) for my parents cosmetic company thing. I'm glad I get a new opportunity to do some web designing again, it excites me! and except for that the only thing I've been doing is talking to people on MSN (Maggie mostly).  Daina's still in Scotland, I'm sure she's having a good time checking out the hot accented scottish guy goth metal fingers which rip out their eyes with claws, come on, we all know its a huge turn on for the Dane. And speaking about vacations, Sebastian is going to spain on Monday, and I have to take care of his dog for 3 weeks... and this dog, is also the size of my dog... a fucking cow! I can barely handle my dog when it see's a squirrel, so when I'm walking these two beasts in a few days, and a squirrell decides to run by, I am basicly going to pull a superman flying through the air.  Oh well, it should be quite the experience. I'm looking forward to it... And as for Warped Tour updates, I still have no idea how I am going to get there, hopefully there are some buses that I can take there, but that would be quite the journey. I'm sure I'll have more stories to tell in the week to come!

       Alright, it's 11:00 pm! what the hell else do I have to do? I'm pissed tired but I cant stop thinking about stuff! I've been deep in thought about religion and after life the past few days. I think I've hit moments of mad depression thinking about these things a few days ago, but hopefully I'll be able to sort out all my thoughts, feelings and beliefs on the topic.  I'm not sure what triggered it, but whenever I goto bed I start to think about what happens after I die, do I just rot in the ground and have no capability to remember anything? I strongly believe in ghosts and spirits due to personal experiences with ghosts and what I believe to be my guardian angel, but still, I can't stop thinking "what if it's all just a crazy coincidence?" There have been times where someone with me at the time, experienced the same thing, but what if we just misunderstood what was going on or what was really there. Seems as if someone actually researched exactly what happened then theres always an explanation as to why we were lead to believe there was "something" there. Clearly if there are ghosts and spirits there is an after-life, and recently I've been questioning these memories of these "ghosts", I mean things happen all the time, but the second something odd happens, which could involve a ghost I automatically assume it's a spirit haunting me!  I was watching this show on CTV and I'm not sure what it was called, but it was about a woman (her name was beloma or something) that woke up from a coma after 16 years. She said there was an island where people in comas could talk to eachother. Beloma saw a picture of a lady and automatically noticed her as a friend from the island. Beloma spoke her name and talked about her, and the doctors were confused as to how she knew her, and a few of the doctors started questioning if such an island could exist. Beloma said this lady in the picture played tic-tac-toe with her in the sand and she drank beer alot, also learned details like how she had the state of texas tattoed on her ass. The doctors did some research on the woman in the picture and it turned out she had a daughter named Beloma a few years after the coma. OBVIOUSLY at this point everyone is starting believe that they actually did meet on this island. They met up with the lady in the picture and the lady said she didn't remember such an island, but there were a few odd things. She didn't know as to why she named her child Beloma, it just "stuck in her head" and she was from dallas, texas... and she had the state of texas tattoed on her buttocks, clearly Beloma had met her before, and this lady wanted to meet Beloma. When the woman met Beloma, Beloma recognized her immediatly, but the texas chick did not. After talking for a bit the texas chick remembered her, she remembered when Beloma was young she was lost on a beach and the texas chick went upto her and waited for Belomas older brother. The texas girl played tic tac toe in the sand with Beloma and talked to her about everything. Suddenly the possibility of this island existing faded away.  The entire purpose of me writing out what happened is because, even though there were so many obvious signs of there actually being an island where spirits went too when their bodies were in a coma. It was SO OBVIOUS that it existed, but there was an explanation for everything and this spirit world belief was destroyed. All that happened is Beloma's mind got mixed up and got the memories all wrong. I strongly believe I've had these "ghostly experiences" but what if my mind is just playing with me? My friends say they get de ja vu alot, but all it is, is when the brain is tired it processes things twice, so right after it happens you think about it again and it's blurry just like a dream, therefore you just assume it has happened before. It's all because of the brain mixing stuff up. If a person has brain damage, will the spirit also have brain damage? The only reason we exist and believe is because of our minds that allow us to think and function, without a brain how can we exist? how can we think? We can't.  I really hope there is some sort of after-life, but with alot of religions, the basis is that we have a soul that lives forever. But how can a soul think without a brain? If a soul is contained in a human body, what's the point of a brain if it can think of its own? This spirit thing seems way to perfect, unlike the human body. We can get hurt physically and our lives can be changed with a mallet to the head, but if we have a spirit why aren't we able to think as if we did before. It just doesn't make sense.  Religion in my mind is nothing but a nice story to make people less afraid of death. As I was thinking about this, I came to believe that thousands of years ago there were a few very smart people that made up religion to comfort other people. They must have known we all are afraid of death, so they made up stories about heaven and such things. As the years went by the story got more complex, to make people behave they created hell and then created God as the one who decides wether you're good or bad. Then one day some monk thought up a leader of hell, an angel that went evil and now tries to make people evil so they goto hell. And taa-daa! you have the basis of christianity. As the years went by it just got more complex, and then Jesus was born. As it happened long ago I cannot explain what happened to Jesus, maybe there might have been a group of people that tried to make God come alive, so since Jesus was a child they made him believe he was the mesiah. They got a few "actors" like the "blind man" to say he was blind, Jesus went to him and thought he cured him but in reality it was all staged. I also watched a documentary on the "ressurection" of Jesus that said there was a very popular drug/herb that made a person seem dead and that they would wake up several hours later. So they might have given Jesus the herb before he was crucified, and then Joseph quickly took him down from the cross before he woke up and put him in his "tomb". After Jesus' ressurection and death, too make things more easy these people which helped stage all of this created The Holy Bible which basicly writes down everything about god, heaven, hell, and the reason for all of this, Eternal-Life.  I'm not saying I believe this is exactly what happened to Jesus, infact I don't know what I believe. But the story which I said is an example of what could have happened. I truly want to be able to have a 100% belief of God, Jesus, Heaven, an after-life, but I simply can't, I've thought about it way too much and for me personally It just doesn't make sense. Religion is such a great escape from reality, Religion is NOT a bad thing. It makes people less afraid of death and the basis of alot of religions is basicly to Behave good and you'll be rewarded in the after-life. Essentially this seems perfect, if everyone in the world (I know I'm picking on christianity, I'm sorry) was christian, and followed all the commandments then the world would be perfect. The idea and morals of christianity are generally great, making the people which made christianity truly brilliant. If we all followed these rules, we would be in heaven as promised, a "heaven on earth".  Alot of people have their strong beliefs and sometimes I wonder to myself "How can they believe such a thing so strongly? There has to be a reason" and they sometimes rub off on me, sometimes I am certain there is a god, but there is never any proof. All I want is some proof of an after-life, some proof that one religion is true so I can follow the rules of whichever religion it is. I wanna be able to go face to face with a ghost and talked to him/her about it, maybe even get god himself to directly speak to me. I don't wanna pray and think he spoke to me, I know at that point it might be all mental. I wanna speak to a spirit and get a picture, some solid proof, a sign or anything. Maybe even just a drawing on my desk that ends up by my bed side. I strongly want to believe in an after-life, however I need proof, I want proof, otherwise I will never be able to swear I believe in something, I will always question things... It's a curse.  People have told me to pray for a sign, people tell me god talks to them and helps them in certain situations. The reason I don't believe in this is because, if we can believe in something so strongly, our minds will think of a "god-like answer" which we will follow. God in theory is perfect, therefore if we think of something god would say, we think of the best answer we can think of, the "perfect thing" to do. Our minds are a beautiful thing, they control everything in our body. People in Africa with AIDS were given Placebo's (sugar pills) and told it was medicine that will help with AIDS, Oddly enough, many of these people which took these sugar pills said they felt alot better after taking the pills, and they believed it helped. Clearly since the brain thought it will help, the brain helped the body battle the disease as if the drug would, so obviously this is proof that if we believe in something enough it can come true for them.  I really hope there is a heaven, It seems so perfect. But sometimes things that sound too perfect, are.  Heres a lyric from a song by Modest Mouse that stuck out when I listened to it, It sums up alot of my thoughts.

       urlLink    Ever since the movie Lilo and Stitch was released 2 years ago, I looked upon the blue creature and I fell in love. However, even though I've wanted to watch the movie for such a long time, tonight was the first time I got the opportunity to watch it. I downloaded it off of Limewire and I've got to say, I LOVED IT!  I know I will lose masculinity points saying this, but the movie was absolutely adorable. I felt my eyes water at the part where stitch starts to read "The Ugly Duckling". Stitch is awesome, best Disney character ever! So damn cute, I now have to go out and buy a stitch doll and the movie so I can see it in good quality and have it arround the house. God damnit, the entire movie put a smile on my face, a "HARDCORE PUNK" teenager turning 16 fought off tears watching a movie made for children, geez, did not see that happening.  I think I'm gonna go play some shoot-em-up games or go watch a Bruce Lee movie and suck up whatever masculinity I have left.  I

Shattered Galaxy ( urlLink www.sgalaxy.com ) It's a Mass Multiplayer Online Real Time Strategy game, completely fun and pretty addictive. My cousin Sebastian and I can't get enough of this game. Maybe someday someone will read this game and join us.  Oh and may I also inform you that this game is Free to download and play off of  urlLink www.sgalaxy.com

      It's been a while since i've posted in one of these. I'm about half way through summer and don't feel like i've accomplished much yet, except for going to a few shows and going to camp. Which was suprisingly fun, and I got in shape and saw abs, and already My abs are gone! *tear*. I'm seriously contimplating excersizing more, everyday do sets of sit ups and push ups and maybe go for a jog (But seriously, who the fuck with long curly hair goes for a jog?)   Also, VERY excited for warped tour! :D coheed and cambria, Thursday, woo! if they end up playing at the same time I'll be mad, maybe I'll end up cutting myself in half and going to both stages. Warped tour will be tons of fun, I just know it! Even though I am disapointed at the fact Brand New, taking back sunday and the starting line aren't playing, but as long as I see coheed I will be happy! Maybe I'll even see that really cute girl I met at the last show, haha man i'm excited :D   Heh I never thought I'd post in my blog ever again, but Mecha_Yoshi from CG reminded me of the blog and HEY why not! I mean, it's 3:30 am, what else do I have to do?   Gonna go open up another can of apple juice, can't get enough.
