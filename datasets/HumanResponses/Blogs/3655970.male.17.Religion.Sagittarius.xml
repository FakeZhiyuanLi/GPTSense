      Thank God! It's all over. Ermz, but thurs still got maths s which im going to heck i think. Going there to play play and relax. Wahah. Anyway, I din't quite seem to finish my all my papers on time?! Personally, I feel that it doesnt give u time to think. Once you look at the questions, you must have an idea how to start etc liaoz. Well maybe I'm just a slow turtle. hehe. This 1 month hol, I dint utilize it properly. I can only blame myself. But I'll still have faith in Him that I'll do well... :P   Whenever after playing the drums, I will somewhat feel disappointed?! Perhaps I already know the answers but just dunno how to move on from there?! Haha. Ermz, I will not elaborate it further. I guess I just need to seek Him more and pray more about it.  Felt abit ironic this evening. Haha. There's this person who came up with this idea/plan and wanted all of us to get involved. I felt that it was kinda weird and maybe ridiculous? Because that person should evaluate the whole situation properly first. -.-  I guess I'm not part of the 'team', so I don't feel a need to do what you have suggested. : The Lord is still the best because of His unfailing love and faithfulness. I want to keep that fire, love and zeal going for You Lord!

      Guess what? I just woke up!! HAha. It's 2.30pm already. SCary manz. Just wasted half a day sleeping. Had a great time with Yanda, Kenny, Engie, Shubert and Terrence at Megapool. After our usual mugging at the CC, Yanda suggested pool. So eventually, we contacted Kenny and yeah..He approached the rest too. However, we had to wait till about 12+ for Kenny's van, and so went to his house and watched some movie clips etc. Oh, I got to read the 'I Kissed Dating Goodbye'. I was so intrigued by it that I wanted to have it etc. Haha. You must be thinking 'Wah..This ben ar..keeps on talking about BGR and love etc..' :P I guess just for fun and more knowledge on such things?! Hehe. Oh ya..Before we went to Kenny's house, Grace phoned and told me that Priz had ran out of her house, crying etc. Therefore, Yanda and I decided to meet her and maybe try to help. But she did not want to tell us anything or let us pray for her. Nevertheless, Priz, if you got anything or need help etc, feel free to call us etc :)  Hmm...then after pool, went to Simpang Bedok to have prata and watch soccer. Germany vs Czech Republic. Wah. I never expected GErmany to lose man!!! Czech had such great defence!! There are a lot of black horses in the tournament manz. HAha. Amidst all these fun etc, as usual, my mum woke up EVERY hour to call me! You should know why. I really feel that sometimes I'm just being treated like a small kid who will encounter some danger etc. ARggghz. Of course, I can understand why she was doing all these - She was concerned about me. After I got home, she started scolding me and linking issues which are not related at all. I got so pissed off. -.- You know la, when parents scold, they will start a conference like that...talk and talk non-stop. Uncontrollably, I 'rebuked' =X Then as I was blogging, she came to explain and apologise. Ar!! :D Touched yet 'immune'? This is not the first time such things happened.  But honestly, I shouldn't take her for granted. She did all these because she loves me. I guess sometimes its akin to flying a kite. Too loose, the child feels empty and lonely. Too tight, the child will hate all the nagging and etc.  Dear Lord, I want to thank You for giving me such wonderful parents. Teach me to be more obedient to them and You. And also thank You for everything that You have done for me. Indeed, You are so great and faithful to me. :D  *Cheers*

      Today Yanda released me on an aeroplane! Haha. He said wanted to meet me for main service etc but when I called him at 910am, he's just awake. Ya..then I went alone. :| But it was really a great feeling!!! I felt so refreshed and reassured by Him. The sermon by pastor Rony was the answers to my doubts and questions. It was about patience and obedience. I realise that no matter what happen, we should continue to have the faith in Him and wait patiently, just like Noah waited 120 years and etc. Also, we need to do things which are within our capacity to improve our spiritual walk. He wants us to get going FIRST, then He will reveal to us more. Pastor Rony mentioned about Samson who was never forgotten by God. And this applies to us too. Hebrews 11:6.  Besides that, the speedlight's sermon also enlightened me. It checked what my focus was and is in the music ministry; whether I was playing for God or myself. Well, I learnt that we have to be humble and just serve Him whole-heartedly. As a drummer, it is very easy to play for self-glory and impress upon others. God doesn't want such people in the ministry! Like what Weixiong and Joel have said, we are the frontline people who are to minister to them, not to impress them with our skills. Therefore, it's imperative to keep our focus and motive right and pray more fervently. The strong bonds between each other in the ministtry are equally important too. I really thank God for these brothers. :) Oh ya Joel! Thanks for your concern and encouragement! You're such a great blessing from Him! :D  HAha. Today actually wanted to study after pract, but was just so tempted to go makan with the gang! Honestly, I had a great time with them, although I always kena suaned like siao!! :( They always bully me. Big size is a hinderance I guess. :P After the practice, the headaches Came back strong! I could feel somthing is pounding on my head! It has been like this for weeks! HOpefully it will be gone when school reopens. I just felt like stop what I was doing just now and take a rest. Even now as I'm typing, the pain is still there!   Celeste said, 'being humble is where u know that u are weak and nothing when u are before the Lord. That only thru Him u can overcome, and have the strength and wisdom. So now u are in the Lord.. meaning u should know ur identity in Christ.. that you can live life exceedingly....being humble to me is more like telling the Lord.. i can't do it without You. But low self esteem is where u say u just can't do it.' THanks cel. YEpx. Was kinda surprised also - something 'good' happened?! Hope it doesnt turn out to bad or whatsoever.  Lord, thank you for everything. Indeed, You are so faithful. Teach me to be patient and obedient to You.

      Wah today I was pissed manz! I lost my reading club card on way to the CC! Panic-stricken!! So I cycled around the path that I've taken and you know what?! The bicycle chain just BROKE OFF! 1 blessing after another! HAHA. DAmn pissed by then. I pushed the bike to the bicycle shop which is quite far and wasted $12 on a new chain. Finally managed to get into that cosy room with strong air-con! :) And it was already 3plus. Wasted 1 hr plus for all that rubbish things.  Then I began to ponder - was God trying to make fun of me or what? Of couse I know that I shouldn't blame or question Him. But arrgghz..just angry?! (Not of Him) Then I recalled the zhai verse, 1 THS 5:16-18. After saying a short prayer and etc, I started to 'fill the mug'. My mum accompanied me to the doctor because I was having headaches these few weeks. It just came on and off. Surprisingly, the chi doctor just said something's wrong with my lifestyle - sleep late wake up late. HAha! Of course, he did not charge me. But find that deduction abit funny?! Maybe he wasn't a zhai doctor?! haha.  Talked to Alvin Chia alittle bit on BGR again! Haha. and later Kenneth came along..and Hey Kenneth! I really envy you man! You already have the headstart and God has answered your prayers!! Cool manz. Just relaxed and let Him take charge... This prayer thing somewhat triggers my mind to think whether my prayers are being answered etc. Of course I'm not referring to the BGR etc, had enough of that. What I'm trying to say is that somehow my faith is being shaken at times and prayers are not answered?! I really don't know.Is it that I don't do what I ought to do enough? Did I seek earnestly and fervently?  Need to look for someone who is spiritually mature to answer my questions etc!!  Hmm, meanwhile I think I'll just continue to have the faith and not doubt his plans.  Lord, show me your ways as I can't survive on my own! Change me to be more obedient to You I pray.

      Went to the reading room to study at 3 plus. On my way there, I listened to class95 and as usual, it really ROCKS! All the old songs that they played were just so NICE! So people, start listening to class95!!! Haha. Yanda and Grace who came later, were there too. You know what? the person who was sitting near us, moved away to other tables...you should know why.   Oh manz!These few days the BGR issue has been preoccupying me...and I talked to people about whom they like and etc etc. I dunno why! But frankly speaking, what matters most now is to maintain a good relationship with God first. If I can't even love and commit myself to Him, not to mention the opposite sex. And I can't deny that I do admire girls. Sometimes I just want to get to know them better, that's all! NO other motives! But you know la, girls are always very paranoid and sensitive...so ya in the end you might even be shunned. Haha!  I think I really need to reflect. Some of you who know me should know that I'm quite negative when it comes to certain gatherings, outings and socializing. Well, I'm just afraid of being left out and Xtra. I had tasted such feelings before and it's NO FUN! Well, I guess I'll just wait patiently for Him to change me and pray more in this area.....  The night is always young and good to have fun! ^_^

      Well, I think some of you might be flabbergasted to see me blogging?! Ya, I also don't know where the urge came from! haha. I started this thing at 1am till 3pm, encountered lotsa problems manz! So frustrating!Ok looks like I have lotsa things to learn - how to decorate my blog etc?! :P But maybe I'll just keep it simple as it is now...  Anyway, I began the day by swimming(training) and was rather drained out at the end of it man! VJC swim team was there too and it's rather intimidating! Haha. Because they seem to be great in everything! Oh, I managed to get my tan too. Had a little bit of strawberry flavour..HEhe. At the end of the training, I was totally drained out. The team then went to have some cheap Jap food. Not so bad. ^_^   Met up with some of the music ministry members to watch The Best Bet. IT WAS SO HILARIOUS!!! =D Then at 7pm everyone except Wei Xiong turned up and went for dinner at Fish & Co. HAha...Imagine an army officer being late! Oh ya, I was like being forced to reveal my secrets on who I like and etc...Akin to last sunday when I was having dinner with the big gang. Those who were there should know...After dinner, we went to the coffee club at Hotel Rendevous.   And we moved on to our main agenda. All of us shared quite a lot on our camp experience and the music ministry. Ya..and I learnt quite a bit too. One of them is not to be afraid of making mistakes and constantly be focused on the purpose of playing our instrument - to serve God whole-heartedly and humbly. Yes, we have to be skilful but that should not compromise or affect our worship to God!!! Somtimes we might get too obsessed with the technical issues or our surroundings instead of focusing on God. Besides that, we should always be conscious of what we do, react and behave. Is it to please Him or others?! It's rather tough I would say, but we must be disciplined and give our very best for Him.  I hope there will be more of such gatherings or outings, so that we can strengthen our relationships with one another instead of just being a group of musicians. :) I really enjoyed the session! Thanks Joel! And of course, thank God for everything!!! :D

      Went running, cycling and swimming today I felt so refreshed after the whole thing. Well, though I was alone, still I was joyful and satisfied cos I know the Lord was and is with me. During my swim, I saw Douglas who is in NDU now. He told me all the 'sufferings' that he has gone through and wanted to get out asap.  All the people there are much more fit than the normal fit. Their 2.4 9+ mins and below...pull-ups literally 20 and above..Though it is prestigious but still xiong and terrifying~ Hehez.   Why do you call Me "Lord, Lord," and not do the things which I say? Luke 6:46 . This verse makes me soul-search and reflect on what I should and should not done, be it in my actions, behaviour and speech.  Now I'll be at the CC everyday to study, be it rain or shine. I'm trying to have an agreement with Yanda. Hahah. Pretty lame one - the person who doesnt turn up, will treat. Hehez. I guess that's the only way to force us to really study.   God is greater than our heart, and knows all things. 1 John 3:20

       Alright, just finished a bowl of honey stars. Gosh! It triggered my hunger already, but ok I'll control because Mr Fat is here...hahaz.! Im like very particular about this Mr Fat&nbsp;because he's&nbsp;soo obnoxious! Can't wait to kill him. =X   Ok...I'm pretty health-conscious. =P    &nbsp;  Our teachers treated the swim team to PIzzaHut. What else? Of course, whack ar!!! Hahaz. Tons of cheese...haha. One of the teachers talked about his days in NUS and career paths etc. And honestly, I don't know what course to take in future!!! Don't ask me what I like etc, because I like everything? Hahaz. Ermz..I was thinking of civil engineering since I like construction a lot! Being a construction worker rocks! =D Just imagine yourself plastering the wall, mixing the cement, laying bricks etc..Oh if can, I want to operate those mammoth&nbsp; and cool cranes...They simply rox man! Ok...all these sounds peculiar! Back to serious business, they say civil engine is like no future? *shrugss* God will show me His ways...so no fear I guess..hehe.    &nbsp;  Indeed, Time really flies manz! Today, I did a few things ONLY! Supposed to go to my cousin's 21st bday party, I went to study instead.    -.- I have tons of homework to complete. Shucks! And Sunday as usual la, is a long day. So&nbsp;Sat is my&nbsp;only day to do work?! Really no life manz! Everyone is counting down to prelims and etc etc...it's really terrifying manz! I guess this couple of months is all about eating books, what else? Ok..enough of dwelling.

       Arrrgghz...School...Classmates...Homework etc.. all these are indeed prosaic. I really can't wait to go army. Haha. Well, at least you don't need to kill that much brain cells and ya..Army takes care of everything - food, sleep, 'play' etc etc. =X Ok..I know those who are in army will rebut. Alright, enough of that whingeing.    &nbsp;  Anyway, I skipped my sch's sea carnival just to go study. Honestly, I wasn't involved in it in any ways and I dont have my clique at all. Therefore, no point wasting my time moseying around right?&nbsp;=P I know what you are going to say! But I'm just trying to catch up and put in more effort in my studies since I'm lousy and mediocre. Logical isn't it? Also, I'm not a nerd(like some of my friends)&nbsp;who only knows life is studies, right? I do play hard too. Don't you agree? Well as you know, All work makes Ben a dull boy. Whahaha. Come and join my club ' The Muggers' Club'. Free membership and an upsized kid at your service. ^_O    Had a short yet meaningful sharing with Cindy. Haha this amazing and funny girl. I got this peculiar notion in my head again. If I tell you about it, you'll be&nbsp;rather amused and find it absurd?! Nvm about that.    &nbsp;  Yet I am poor and needy;   may the Lord think of me.   You are my help and my deliverer;   O my God, do not delay.  Psalms 40:17

       What else can I say? Lord is indeed so good and faithful! Well, this week, I was thinking of ways to change and improve my QT with God. And guess what? Today, both the spdlight and main service's sermon were on quiet time! So surprised man. God really gave me the answers and solutions man!!! Oh Dr Tan mentioned about personal retreat. That sounds really cool manz, it's somewhat similar to camp?! Hmmz..I wonder where got such places...^_^ Anyway, back to QT, ya it's not about doing it to please Him or a routine, but it's the desire to BE WITH HIM and have THIS INTIMACY WITH HIM. I realised that sometimes many people including me, keep saying that God is the most important, yet it doesnt reflect on us as things like our work, studies or even sleep distract us and took away the priority. Sounds ironic isn't it? Well, it's never too late to change, right? So let us have more spiritual discipline, to really seek Him daily. =) Must always tell myself not to be a member of NATO (No actions, talk only) HEhe. =P     My father went to church with me today. =D After the service, I asked how everything was etc. The answer was the same as before - 'Aiya, I come for fun only...I know all these... All are the same, no difference...I know what I'm doing etc etc' I was really discouraged. Also, as my uncle and his family were at my house just now, we began to talk about religion. My uncle joined forces with my father to argue with me, saying how they felt towards Christianity and etc. Wah, I was really struck dumb by what they said and commented. I didn't know how to answer and rebut... Oh my uncle asked me a very simple question which totally threw me off!! Ask me if you wanna know. =X Wah..after all that, I felt so useless and lousy...Now it's even harder to convince my cousin who is my uncle's son! -.- My mum, another one la, keeps telling people that I've been spending too much time in church, which would affect my A lvls. She said that people in my church should encourage me to stop going to church. Nonsense from her always.&nbsp;WHahhaha. AR! Sick of all these liaoz! I know what I'm doing... so Pa and Ma...Shhhhhhhhh!!!! HAHA.     &nbsp;   Hmmz...looking back at my life, I think I have changed to a better person?! Well, at least I'm not so introverted and shy? Ermz although im still alittle bit.. =P And I have lotsa friends now?! Haha. Don't laugh ok! Help me to get out of that box if you can! Lolx. Oh yes, any1 wanna go somewhere tranquil, sip a cup of coffee and maybe chat + reading?! :P     &nbsp;   My faith will be strong because of You Lord.    I want to seek Your face always.   &nbsp;

        My beloved pen fell to its death yesterday. The tip kissed the floor twice, leaving 60% of life untouched. Haha. Ok I know it's lame and crappy.     &nbsp;   Today went to attend a bible conference by Bill Crowder, the director of Daily Bread. It was on Joseph: Overcoming Life's Challenges. Normally, my fridays always end at 5+, so I was abit worried whether I could make it on time etc. But thank God man! The teacher decided to end the lesson at 4+, therefore I had extra time to 'cool down' before I go for the thing. The speaker rocks. Like what Joanna said, he has kinda brought the passages to life. Somtimes you read the passage without understanding what the reasons are etc, but as he read it, you can really catch the implications etc. Hehe. We should always persevere no&nbsp;matter what happen. Bill said We are always in a hurry, but God is not!! Since you trust&nbsp;Him, why should you be impatient and yearn for immediate results etc?&nbsp;It's too soon to quit!!!&nbsp;Joseph&nbsp;became a ruler after 13 years of perseverance&nbsp;and moulding by God.  &nbsp;We are always in good hands&nbsp;of the Lord for&nbsp;He&nbsp;makes no mistakes...     &nbsp;   Oh after the 1st half of the session, they were giving out free copies of ODB. Then, 1 sms came from my classmate, asking me to lend him my copy. I don't think it's pure coincidence but God who was doing all this! So real indeed! Actually He was a Christian....ya so he saw my DB on my table and begun to browse through it. After a while, I noticed that he was deep in thoughts. Ya...I did not expect the sms to come at all and etc. I think God wants me to help him.&nbsp;Ya...Pray that&nbsp;he would come to know God again. That reminds me of my father. I hope this sunday he will go to chuch with me. He dislikes Christianity and keeps saying he knows what's happening in church&nbsp;(like how people brainwash etc etc..) Oh Give me a break!!! Nevertheless, this is the first step, Salvation is still a long way to come. But ya, maybe pray for my father if you can. Thanks. Also, recently my parents are badgering me to stop going to church because they&nbsp;are afraid&nbsp;it might affect my studies etc. Honestly, I think it's all crap! --.--&nbsp;They said I'm too obsessed with all this church stuff. It riled me man! I tried to explain to them, but seems like it's to no avail. If argue more, the whole situation will just get more uglier, so I&nbsp;think just leave it to God. Hehe.     &nbsp;   Walked home with Kenny. He enlightened me once again. This time, it was about my ministry and other stuff like showing concern etc. I wont elaborate on it. Ya, but I think this sunday will be the beginning.. =D     &nbsp;   A Christian life is indeed exciting! Don't you agree? As you dwell on Him more, He will reveal Himself to you more. Let us keep the zeal and first love going man! Love you always Lord!     &nbsp;     &nbsp;

      Should I say that I've screwed up my week(sleeping a lot! Lazing around..)? Oh man, this really sucks. Must put a cessation to it!  I really need to be more focused in my studies as it seems like I've become more playful this year? Last year was like hugging the mug all the time?! Hahaz. I'll just need to hang on for another 4 months and WAH LA!! =P Cannot wait to get out of that junky school! =X I dont like the environment, people, food which is horrendous. Oh, talking about ppl, You know what? I somewhat got shunned by people who r unhappy about me mugging hard? So absurd!!! Well, slacking in my sch is a norm. If you dont slack, you are an outcast. -.- Whatever.  Recently, Grace told me about how she felt about church, the speedlight and etc. It made me ponder too. And I began to ask people for their views and etc. Just some simple 'startup' for chat I guess? Haha. Anyway, I feel that everything's fine. But sometimes, I don't quite get the speedlight's sermons. Maybe it's because the age group ranges from p5 to 20+ which is rather large, so kind of difficult to cater to everyone. Kind of funny?! Hehe. In my opinion, we should not solely depend on church services for feeding, but it is our daily effort in reading His words and doing QT regularly. To put in layman's terms, I think it would sum everything up by saying 'practice makes perfect' or simply think of it as a BGR relationship. If you want to get intimate with Him and know Him better, should you not do something about it? And it should not be a weekly thing only. But because of our daily activities, be it work or studies, we inadvertently neglect Him. Yes, I'm guilty of it. Ok..Must really put all these into ACTIONS!!!  Oh and yesterday went to a Christian bookshop in Eastpoint with Yanda. Saw some great stuff eg like the daily devotional materials which are akin to daily bread. But I think it is more indept than the latter. Too bad its not free...1 year $23.20. Sounds cool right? Cheap and worthwhile. ^_^ Yepx..I bought this little book titled 'How to have A Quiet Time'. Im sure this would help me to enhance my learning of His words and having a much effective QT with the Lord! = )  Today met up with Cel to have dinner. Had a great time. Thanks for all the sharing manz. Ya..and it is all the downs that God wants to use to mould us to become better people. So I was wondering how come my life is like smooth? Wahah. Of course, I'm not implying that I want troubles in my life etc, ya..but..ah nvm.Haha. Nevertheless, He has changed me for the better and done a lot for me. =)     Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord. Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer. Share with God's people who are in need. Romans 12:11-13

      Had swimming competition on Thurs and Fri. This is my first time because I started swimming again when I was in yr 1! Before that, I was in NCC. So in a way, I'm like a newbie. Haha. It was really an eye-opener for me. Yepx. Cool People and those Pro swimmers were around, and of course, there were some cocky ppl, esp from those good schools. You know la, Swimming is always dominated by AC and Raffles people. They are really fast!! Oh Ang Peng Siong was there too. Wah He's really HUGE man! His calfs are the size of my arms! As for his arms, no need to say liaoz. I want his body!! :P I guess when u have a good body, you will be more confident of youself? =D   I did pray for everything to go smoothly. Well although sometimes things might not happen what we wanted, we should always thank Him for He has the best plans to prosper us!    Lead me Lord I pray  Take me, Mould me Use me, Fill me I give my life to You Hold me, Guide me Lead me, Walk beside me I give my life to You

      Got back my CT results. And only 1 word can describe it - CARELESS!. When I looked at all the errors, I was angry with myself. Anyway it's over. No point dwelling on it. Thank you Lord for the results and all that you have done for me.  Hmmz, my classmate who was on the same boat with me, reminded me of my impetuosity. Both of us were considered the consistent ones and we had the same problem - afraid of FM affecting other subjects etc. Teachers and friends persuaded us continuously. Even the HOD of FM reassured and had faith in us. Yet I did not heed their advice! I withdrew from it on the day of the registration. =  I realised that I succumb to small setbacks and failures easily. And this is not the 1st time. It's high time for me to change and seek fervently my identity and image in His words. Remember Breakthrough chapter 4 and 5?! Hehe. :P   Rest in the Lord and wait patiently for Him Psalm 37:7

      Today went for Cg dinner at Fisherman's village. When I reached there, Wah! It was so beautiful manz - referring to the beach and etc, although the clouds looked ominous. You might be thinking whether I'm a mountain turtle or whatever...like never been to the beach before.. haha! There are restaurants and cafes just next to the beach. The ambience was fantastic! Hehe. Perfect place for fellowship/gathering and also lovebirds. Pretty romantic too..HAha.. The restaurant that we went was a 'Zhi Cha' style. We were sitting in the open, and afraid of the rain coming, as dark clouds covered the skies. But hey you know what? God answered our prayer instantly! The rain did not come at all! Just a couple drops..God is indeed SO REAL when you have faith in Him! Well, it might seem trivial, but I feel that it's through all these small little things or situations, then we can learn and apply His words in our daily lives. Don't you agree? =)  Oh ya! the whole cell forced me to do a foolish act to Joanna. haha! Always trying to bully me :O Well, I shall not elaborate it. Must keep it as a secret. :D Wanted to stay longer to fellowship etc, but ya tmr got school!!! I'm still at slacking mode manz! This week, think going to get back all the papers?! Need to pray hard for miracles..Hehe.  No matter what happen, God is with us always.

      As usual, love Sundays always! The day where we can really focus on Him, with no distractions. Hey Grace, nice talking with ya. :P  After dinner with the gang(lesser people yest) at KR, all of us went to have pool and watch soccer at Simpang once again! Hahaz. Initially, I declined it because I wanted to do hw and slp?!? =X Ar! Well in the end, cant bear to forsake having fun with them! hehe. =D Sometimes I simply envy those people who are having REAL holidays. No hw or tests to worry. Can't wait for this A lvl year to pass!!! And then *Evil laughter* !!  Sometimes the things that you do might send some wrong signals or ideas to people who would then get irritated/angry/upset...So what's next? Leave it as it is? Or voice out? No point complaining this and that, as if all these would really help?! -.- Well, what I want to say here is being transparent and open. Human relations....What a headache!! Hmmz, pets wont give you such problems..haha.   Whatever it is, the Lord is still the only one whom we can truly rely on... *cheers*

      Just came back from pool and supper with Kenny, Engie, Shubert, AlvinChia, Meiling, Peter, Shufang, Yanda and Weixiong. As usual, had a great time! You know what? Actually I didn't want to go because I finished my swimming from 4pm to 8pm. I was drained out totally. Hahaz. Well, 4pm to 6pm was for bathing in the sun. Too bad Mr Sun didn't come out again!! Arrgghz. But I got an unexpected call from Alvin Chia, and he somewhat persuaded me to go etc. :P Er, I dozed off abit while watching soccer. Hehe =x  While I was playing pool, I received smses from someone who told me some bad news ( It's about me and some other people). Gave a call to her to find out more( Thanks a lot). And Wah! I was flabbergasted and dejected by the strong and hurting words that the person used. Everyone does get livid, but is there a need to vent your anger by saying such things?! Are you not aggravating the entire situation and causing more misunderstandings and hurt? If you thrash things out with the person 1 on 1, isn't it much better? Rather than going around telling people how bad the person is and etc? I'm not furious or whatsoever. I just want things to be talked out nicely instead of such things happening! Give me a chance to explain and apologise too.

      Today slacked at home the whole day. Gosh! I could have done something meaningful or interesting manz!! So sad. Couldn't swwim and tan because the sun kept hiding throughout the day! Arrrghz. Wanted to run too, but procrastinated it.Hahaz. By the time, I wanted to run, it was already 10pm!  Priz showed me some comments made by a guy in his blog. And it struck me! Was God trying to tell me something?  'Here's what my pastor said just now. You who serve God but never pray, you should consider your resignation.  Simple yet powerful, made me think what I have done so far. Have I prayed in my service to God? Don't be surprised when you go to heaven later, the wages for those who prayed for others are bigger than those who seem to serve in the eye of human but never prayed. By the way, today's passage was taken from Matthew 13:31-50. What do you think?'   During my QT, I felt a strong sense of guilt and c. Immediately, I asked for His forgiveness and mercy. Felt so good after the whole thing. Thank You Lord.  Besides that, that 'comments' made me ponder how I perform etc. And indeed, its egregious! Of course, I need to hone my skills etc, but if I play wrong during service which disrupts the worshippers, then yes, I must admit my mistakes and make sure that it won't happen again, and not keep dwelling on it and be upset or whatsoever. As a drummer, I would say it's abit difficult to worship while playing, because you have to think of the fills, tempos and etc. Anyway, the bottomline is pray to Him more and commit everything unto His hands. What's impossible with man is possible with God. Amen. Love you always Lord.

      Just came back from swimming which was so unproductive! Arrghz! After doing my kicking, I felt like sleeping as I lay down to somewhat tan. So didnt manage to kill Mr Fat. Haha.  Yesterday was Cheney's bday. Quite fun. When Isabel and I reached the chalet, we were shocked! haha. Cos not many people were there. It was 9 plus at that time. Well, the rest of the group would be late etc, thats why. So we waited for them to come and Isabel, poor thing...she has test today. And ya...she stayed till pretty late. I noticed something - Cheney and his family members are good-looking!! Hahaz...Good features etc. They are Peranakans..so I guess that makes the difference...?! Oh ya, the food there was nice...And his uncle keeps asking us to eat, too bad I wasnt on form! =P Also, the cake was pink in color!...Cheney = Cherry... Haha!  Planning to cut Armani and gel it up, but my previous 'ordeal' makes me ponder. Whatever. Should I go and sleep now or study?!  WOooO LaAalAaa...Rock it on Baby!! =D

      Everyone is going out to celebrate National Day, yet Bel, Cindy, Yanda and I actually went to study! Amazing. Well, to me, the NDP is still the same, nothing special. I think the most spectacular one would be year 2000's. It had lotsa events and etc. Yepx, so it was a holiday meant for studying.  Arrgghhz. I displayed my stupid golden silence once again! Felt bad about it. I just couldn't bring myself to chat or talk. My presence was no better than my absence. I simply don't know how to use the 'mixer' Haha. Well, I guess I'm still that  shy and introverted guy , as always, unlike those sociable guys who know how to entertain people. Sorry. Haha. I'm trying.  Went to play basketball this morning. Pretty cool. Too bad some of the people there didn't want to play 5 vs 5 which is like so exciting?! It will really make you run like a panting dog. ^_^ Well, 3 vs 3 wasnt that bad, but the opponents were on relax mode. Oh, and I hope that I won't grow any taller by playing basketball, if it does, thats it manz, bball-phobia....I'm not like those tall and BIG people. Imagine a bamboo walking around, eeeewww...haha! Thats why I need more bulk! Btw, is tall a merit? Or issit that I'm TOO tall?! Scary...Hahaz! Whatever.  I have this small bubble-like blood clot in my mouth. I poked it and tried to remove all the blood, but to no avail. I was thinking of simply adding salt on it! That would really hurt big time I think! Lazy to see the doc. Waste money. Alright folks, take great care, and enjoy yourselves. See you guys soon. ^_^  The song 'The Potter's hand' says it all for me... Love you Lord

      There's this foolish person who goes online and simply masters the art of stoning, cos he has nothing to do, unlike others who are having a great time online. =  I suddenly have the urge to play basketball, badminton, cycle and rollerblade! Wanna play bball tomorrow morning, but couldn't find anyone. Sad. Ar...Whatever.  Pardon me for being so simple-minded and childish, perhaps. I'm like that. A kid inside this big body. :-)  Are you hypocritical sometimes?  WHATEVER.

      Went to Bugis just to buy drumsticks. How dumb could I get. Hahaz. I was thinking of who to ask along and have dinner after buying. Just couldn't think of anyone 'suitable'? Cos I'm a weird guy. Hahaz. Oh, that place is like full of pretty and handsome faces?! Hehez.  Tomorrow is holiday (pon sch) cos my sch is celebrating National Day. So I'll have 5 days of holidays?! Cool~ I was telling yanda that maybe one of the nights, we could go pool and supper with Kenny and gang. Haha.  The triathlon is coming soon and I haven't gotten a helmet! Shucks! Need to get helmets for my fren, Xueli and Jac(maybe). Hey! If anyone has 'lobang' for helmets...borrow I mean...pls inform me. Think it would be foolish just to buy it for the event right? We are just going to have fun there, not trying to compete. So...ya..if interested, come on manz! Hehez.  -.- My mind is blank now....Anyway, take care folks! See you guys soon.

       What else can I say? Sundays rox man! The main service's  sermon was on powerful truths for effective living, which somewhat links to my previous entry. So amazing and coincidental. Hehe.  Oh and the cell teaching today was enligthening. Joanna talked about Luke 15 which is on the parables of the lost sheep, lost coin, and lost son. I had read it before and the basic inference, or should I say the only one, was we are precious in the eyes' of the Lord. I did not go into deeper thoughts and analyse the parables. But the last one was really zhai - It has more hidden truths and meanings. Indeed, God is the ultimate story-teller and magician.  Indeed, God plans everything perfectly and let them fall nicely into place. Today the practice was different from the normal ones. Normally, we would pray in the santuary and it's a short and rush one I would say. But this time, we gathered in the Jireh room. Alvin Chia and Joel started sharing. It was just so wonderful. Also, we have decided to start early and end early, so that we can share and pray together. Well, all of us somewhat knew that pract was pretty routine - you play, practise...and this cycle repeated itself. But not anymore! This time round, this change will definitely enable us to bond together spiritually and walk closer as a team to God. It's not about playing together and being in a ministry anymore!!! It's more than that man! *Cheers*  Ok I need to eat more in order to gain more weight. Haha! are you amused? Ok. Whatever. Alright, another exciting week ahead isn't it? Hehe.
