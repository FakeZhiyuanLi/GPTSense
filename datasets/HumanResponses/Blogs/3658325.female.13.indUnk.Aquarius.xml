      yesterday was awesomely awesome. i went to wal-mart for 3 hours to collect money for relay for life.. people were being mean and wouldnt give us money. did you know 1 in 3 people die of cancer? yep. Yeh Ashley and i were hungry so we bought fried chicken! it was yummy chicken too! Ha. yeh so i went home and then i went to famous daves with my daddy for Fathers day. it was nasty because i hate bbq. So yeh after that i went bowling with Laurel Laura and Alex. it was fun. Laura spent like all her money on food. i ate most of her nachos. they werent that good. lol. So we decided we were done bowling and we decided to walk to barnes and noble just to go. so we walked like a mile and we didnt even go in because her mom was going to pick us up at 8.30. So we just like walked in the door, looked around, and left. it was pretty funny. ew when we were walking there, we saw this truck and i think it ran over an animal or something because there was blood and weird fleshy stuff all over the wheel and it was dripping down the parking lot. nasty. Oh and then we went to krispy kreme!! i didnt get a doughbut though.. i wasnt in the mood. but i got a pimpin hat! yep. then we went to Lauras and we watched freaky friday. its such a good movie. we know all the lines because we're losers. Alex thinks we're weird. who cares! we are. so yeh then i went home and went to sleep. then i woke up at like 3.30 and i took a shower because i couldnt sleep. so yeh. i dont know what im doing today so yeh.
