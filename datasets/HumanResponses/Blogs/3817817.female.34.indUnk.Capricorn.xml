      I'm not sure when it started.  my memory isn't always the best that it could be.  in trying to forget certain trauma, i forgot too much of the good stuff.  you know...the kind of stories that keep small children mesmerized no matter how many times they have heard them.  the kind of stories that people will always remember you telling...even long after your voice is silenced.  every now and then i get a flash of one of those memories.  lately i have been getting those flashes more and more.  i suppose i am writing it all down just in case i forget it all again.     my memory works in mysterious ways.  sometimes i'm not sure if i am remembering everything correctly, but does it really matter?  the heart of the memory is there...and it's meaning to me remains the same regardless of the small details.  that's what i think anyway.  one of my earliest memories is very vague, but still very powerful to me.  i was very small...my mother and i were living in a small apartment above the milford tavern.  she was a nurse (still is) so she had to work strange shifts.  in this memory i am wrapped in a soft blue blanket and i am groggy from sleep.  i remember waking up ever so slightly, just enough to know that mom was carrying me and it was early in the morning.  i suppose she was carrying me from or to the car..depending on her shift at the time.  i just know that i closed my eyes tight so she would think i was still asleep, just so i could stay wrapped in her arms.  it was warm and safe...i felt loved...i didn't want the feeling to end.  i remember my grandmother...my gamma.  if i close my eyes i can still picture the position she slept in most often, the softness of her hair, and occasionally her scent.  she was a short, plump woman.  i think that of all my family members, i resemble her the most.  when i was going through my struggle with my marriage and self acceptance, i felt her prescence in my life more than i ever had before.  i found myself comparing our situations in life, and finding so many coincidences that it oft times unnerved me.  in some strange way i felt like she was there trying to keep me from making many of the mistakes she made.  i would see her in dreams, but she never spoke to me.  sometimes i would look at the clock for no reason, and it would be 12:27...her date of birth.  i knew then that she was with me, and it became a comfort to me to know she was there.  "i love you too, gamma" is what i would think in my head..sometimes having a silent, on-way conversation with her in my mind.  i still look at the clock for no reason sometimes...and i still tell her i love her too.    my aunt gloria is perfect.  i have always thought so.  when i was a little girl and she still lived with my grandparents, we fought like all family members sometimes do.  i think i was such a brat becasue i wanted to be just like her.  she was and still is beautiful.  she was cool, had great clothes, super cute boyfriends, and she was always so popular.  she shined.  with her curvy figure and infectious personality she was this incredible goddess to me.  someone i longed to be like, yet had no idea how to attain my goal.  as she grew up and got married, i can remember wanting to be her child.  not that i didn't love my mother, but aunt gloria & uncle larry were a family.  i had an instant mother and father that were always there and lived in the same place.  uncle larry was wonderful, and we all did things together.  i remember their first house, uncle larry's dune buggy, all day trips to the pool, and learning how to play solitare.  when i was sick with bronchitis and couldn't wash my hair for a week or more...aunt gloria bought spray in-no rinse shampoo and cleaned my hair for me.  when i was stung by a wasp and my hand swelled up like a baloon...aunt gloria took me back to her house and made me soak my hand in ice water until the swelling went down.  see?  perfect...just like i said.
