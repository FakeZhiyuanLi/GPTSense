      I watched Return of the King with Elizabeth last night.  She's such Lord of the Rings nut, she kept saying character's lines just before they said them.   I really wish she wouldn't do that!   Anyway, I had some thoughts on the movie.  It seems to me as though Frodo failed.  Not only did he end up defeated by Shelob because he picked the wrong companion, but in the end he chose to keep the ring instead of destroying it.  The ring was destroyed only because Gollum attacked him, beat him, then himself fell with the ring into the lava.  Since Frodo had also tried to kill Gollum before and failed at that, there's a whole bunch of failure going on there, and it is merely good fortune that saved Middle Earth.  To me, the real hero is Sam.  They gloss over it quickly in the movie, but he had been the Ringbearer for a time while Frodo was in the tower with the orcs.  He kind of sold himself short when he decided it was too difficult for him and instead rescued Frodo, kept Frodo motivated, carried him bodily for a time, then urged him to follow through with the destruction of the ring at Mount Doom - oh, that's way easier!  In fact, it's an interesting connection between Sam and Elrond.  Both had been at that point with someone considering destroying the ring - Sam with Frodo, Elrond with Isildor.  I couldn't help, though, but ask one question about the decisions made by the heroes of the story.  With giant eagles available, why didn't they fly the ring to Mount Doom?  When the Eye of Sauron was fixed on Minas Tirith or some other spot of interest, couldn't Gandalf and a Ringbearer climb on the eagles and go straight in?  The only airborne opposition was from the Nazgul, and Gandalf demonstrated in his covering of Faramir's retreat from the orcs that he was able to keep Nazgul at bay.  Granted, it would be a much shorter story, but I'd be interested to hear why that wasn't an option, not even one discussed and discarded by the Fellowship.

      I don't know how long it will before we have working teleportation for people, but it occurred to me as I went through airport security yesterday that the most common theory about how teleportation would work is already being demonstrated right there, albeit inefficiently and in slow motion.  As you enter airport security, you begin to be broken down into separate components.  Your shoes come off, your carry-on items are removed, belts, change, keys are all separated from your person.  Laptops get broken out further into their own area of categorization.  Then, all these separate parts get put through a machine that analyzes their contents and delivers the component parts to the far end.  Finally, all those pieces are reassembled at the far end as a complete traveler.  Viola!  Teleportation!  The only real difference is how much the traveler is broken down and how quickly the material is transferred.  At least, that's my theory.

      I'm in San Diego (still) and sitting in a bar called Mahoney's on F Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues.  I'm plugged into a wall socket for power, so I'm in no danger of running out of battery, which for some reason is the greatest concern I have at the moment.  (Very nice!)  There's a  Starbucks next door, and I can get a connection via T-Mobile, so I've bought a DayPass for my internet access.  I needed to get to my workstation and the corporate network back at Microsoft, but fortunately, I have a smart card reader and a smart card and thought ahead enough to get the remote access stuff installed.  So, what am I doing with that, besides adding to my blog?  Well, there were some updates I had to submit regarding projects at work that really needed to be in tonight.  And there was a bit of email to reply to, including one sent to me at 2:30pm requesting a 5pm the same day reply (what were they thinking?)  But you know, it didn't seem so bad doing the work, since I was able to have dinner and some drinks at the same time.  I'm now thinking that Ram and I should hold our weekly manager/direct report 1:1 meetings in the evenings at a local hotspot or something.  I've had no problem getting quite a bit of work done, and have enjoyed it a lot more.  I'm on to something here!  Maybe I should just stay in this bar indefinately, and attend meetings via phone.  I wonder how long it would take before anyone realized I never came in the office?  I should ask Robert - he's never in the office, for real.

      I went to see this movie today.  It was only so-so, and there were quite a few points where the deeply liberal slant, the global warming lecture, and the obvious symbolism of the casting was annoying.  The guy cast as the president had a look that was an interesting combination of Bush and Gore.  I think he looked more like Gore than Bush, but still I think his look had a lot to do with his casting.  The vice president casting was even more targeted, as that character is more important to the plot and had a lot more screen time.  Apparently, they held a Dick Cheney look-alike contest, and this guy won.  I can just imagine the glee that the writer and director felt putting a Cheney-like actor on the screen and have him act kind of like a jerk for quite some time.  In my opinion, he was making sensible choices and merely ended up being faced with unexpected results, unexpected even to the heroic climatologist protagonist, but I doubt that was there intention.  When later in the movie, the vice president gets on the TV and says the words, "I was wrong..." I could almost hear the cheering from the writer and director.  I have far less tolerance for these "agenda" movies than I used to when I was, how shall I say it, less politically aware?  I had a vague idea that there was an agenda planned for this one before I went in, so I had mentally prepared myself to ignore that aspect and just enjoy the disaster movie, special effects aspects instead.  Knowing ahead of time, it kind of worked, too.  Except perhaps this blog entry speaks to the contrary.

      Olympia (my wife, for those readers that may not yet be aware) has just been offered a job by the American Red Cross.  It turns out that she'll be getting more salary at this job than any she's previously had.  It's also a mix of work that's perfect for her - 25% research, 75% administrative.  I'm really happy for her and proud of her for getting a quality job so quickly.  I felt confident she would, and it's great that my confidence in her abilities was so right on target.  Obviously, her taking a job, especially this particular job for reasons I won't get into right now and after so many years at home focused on raising our children, will mean some significant changes to our lives.  I'm sure we'll work through them, but it's certainly true that even good changes cause stress.

       urlLink BoardGameGeek - Serving the Board Game Hobby Since 2000   I met Ted today, who is from the Massachussetts Medical Society.  We got onto the topic of how I know Roberto, my good friend who works at Microsoft as a technical strategist for the healthcare vertical.  Roberto and I know each other because we live two blocks from one another and share an interest in strategy board games.  So it occurred to me that my blog should reference this Board Game Geek site, as it is one of the best resources for information on strategy board games.  Playing these games, as a hobby, has taken over for my previous obsession with tabletop miniature war games.  The lower preparation time was the deciding factor.  I just haven't the time to assemble and paint miniatures, and unpainted miniatures are no fun to play with.  Miniature games are also notoriously difficult to coordinate with the casual gamer.

       urlLink KurzweilAI.net   I have not yet read the articles on this quoted page, but I did go to a presentation given by Ray Kurzweil, on whose site this appears.  In essence, advances in biotechnology and nanotechnology should mean that immortality is within the grasp of most of us alive today.  He said himself that at 58 years old, he's doing everything he can to make sure he's still around in the relatively short number of years remaining before the dream of no more natural death is made reality.  Since I'm 35, I should be able to make it if he even has a chance.  I have, since I was a child, had the affirmation (although not until recently expressed exactly this way) "I will live to a least 100 years old."  This has always been believable to me as a goal, as there's a history of longevity in my recent ancestry.  My great-grandmother lived to 99 years old.  Her daughter, my grandmother, is 96 and still going, although with certain health problems.  After Kurzweil's talk, however, I now have a new affirmation that has replaced the other.  Here it is: "I will live as long as I want."  Incredible as it may sound this is at least 50% believable to me.  It helps that I had already read some science fiction that suggested many of the same advances that Kurzweil now describes as either in the design phase or even further along.  Also, his arguments regarding the well-documented exponential growth in life expectancy and advances in technology strongly support his assertions.  What's also amazing is the mental benefits this has already given me.  I feel somehow more patient.  I feel I have time.  It doesnt mean I won't work hard or work quickly to accomplish things, it just means that for the bigger picture, changes don't seem so final.  For example, choices to not live near someone I love and would see all the time have always seemed tragic to me.  If I reduce my opportunities for interaction to twice a year, and we were to both have another fifty years to be alive and able to meet, that means that every visit is 1% of the total time we'll spend together.  1% a pop is a lot to me.  Now I can enjoy it more, relieved of the anxiety of thinking, "Oh, this time is so precious that I must get all I can from it!  Why I am not doing more, I'm wasting deeply valuable seconds!"  There's a feeling of "Ahhhh.... relax and enjoy."  It took this to realize that I was constantly nagged by the inevitability of death.  So, with that, I encourage any readers of my blog to also explore a rapidly coming world free of the fetters of time that Ray Kurzweil and his peers suggest is at hand.

      I've started adding POLITICS: to the titles of my posts where I talk about political stuff.  Since politics, like religion, is an area where people generally are not easily swayed from their position and can even get pretty angry, I figured I'd put a friendly warning to those who don't want to see posts about mine.  So, if you have no interest in my generally very conservative viewpoints, you should probably skip those posts.

      As I mentioned yesterday, I have something to say about this paper.  Talk about liberal media bias!  I am getting USA Today deposited at my room at the Sheraton every morning, and like driving by an auto accident, I can't help but look.  This paper is awful.  Monday, the front page above the fold was dedicated to a "human interest" story about Teresa Heinz.  To me, it looked like nothing other than a Kerry campaign ad, telling us how great it would be to have Heinz as our first lady.  Meanwhile, the lead-up to Bush's statements on our ongoing mission in Iraq was below the fold.  Yesterday, the majority of the front page above the fold was dedicated to catastrophizing about the state of assisted living.  You'd think that every senior in America was about to die, alone and unwanted, in profiteering, emotionless cell blocks only thinkly veiled as sensitive homes.  At the right was a sidebar laying out Bush's five part plan for Iraq.  Around it, an article included results of a Bush confidence poll, of course taken over the weekend, when it is a well established fact that weekend polls favor Democrats.  They also reported a 67% majority of Americans believe Bush has no clear plan for Iraq, a statistic displayed not even two column inches below Bush's clear plan for Iraq.  Today's paper, I only glanced at.  More assisted living catastrophizing.  How awful that it's such important news that it has to be on the front page above the fold for two days running.  Perhaps needless to say, this is a paper that will never get a dime of money if I can help it.

      Well, I lost my Monday afternoon post due to a network connection loss right after I hit the Publish button.  I guess as long as I'm on the spotty wireless network that's in at least some places at the San Diego Convention Center, I'll drop a copy of the post into Notepad until I've actually posted.  I'm sitting in on a session on using PayPal via web services.  It's a fairly interesting topic, although the presentation is a little slow.  I didn't actually care about most of the history of PayPal section, and frankly already knew most of it.  This is also being held in a "cabana", which means it's in a huge room with sound baffle walls on two sides.  The acoustics are terrible.  I went to a session on the Microsoft CRM SDK yesterday.  That one was very interesting and moved along just fine.  What's particularly interesting to me is that the stuff I had set up for Gryphon, my association management system I'd sold to a few customers in Maryland and DC, was structure very similarly, although of course not taken as far, as I had nowhere near the resources that Great Plains has.  That's twice I've been ahead of the game with an idea on how to build a technology solution, but was unable to be the one to cash in big on it.  Granted, I cashed in some, so it's not all bad, and there's plenty of time to have more good ideas.  Anyway, if I were to ever go back to developing solutions for small to medium size business, say a relaunch of Heatherstone Digital ("Building connections through technology"), I would probably rewrite Gryphon to use Microsoft CRM under the covers.  Hmmm....  I was going to attend another session today on CRM, but it was cancelled.  Instead, I just stayed in the same room where they had a presentation on Crystal Reports.  It's come a long way since the last time I looked at it, and incorporating such reports into an online solutions seems like a good way to do it.  We held our focus group on community strategy last night, and I think it went very well.  In fact, as I've been sitting in this session, one of the attendees from last night is also here, and as he passed by me, he shook my hand and told me it was a great session and he appreciated the opportunity to be a part of the discussion.  That's pretty gratifying, exactly what makes me tick.  The strategy as prepared and presented last night was very well received.  I think we're on the right track.  There were a couple points when a customer would bring up a point - for example, when one of them asked for us to take the ResKit and turn it into a community source or open source project - that exactly matched things that are currently proposed internally and merely await a go-ahead and funding.  I couldn't have coached them to say it better.  We have another focus group tonight, this time on the Zephyr project, which is all about methods of receiving feedback.  There's three pillars: verbatim product feedback (my area), feedback on content (also called documentation, although internally they for some reason insist on calling it content), and automated server feedback.  That last is a beefing up of the Watson channel with data beyond crashes and hangs, including things like server roles and instrumentation.  I'm interested to see how this goes.  I developed a new model last night of how customers go for help.  First, they do a search.  Almost always, this is via Google.  No one seems to trust Microsoft's search, and I can't blame them - I don't either.  Then, they go to loosely structured methods for getting help, such as posting to a newsgroup or web forum.  [As an aside, the presenter just said, "We have about ten minutes left, so let's talk about PayPal Web Services," which was the advertised point of this session.  Seems like poor planning.]  I call this loosely structured, because it's basically just a post into some kind of threaded discussion with a subject and a block of body text.  The information provided to the potential respondent is only whatever the person seeking help puts in without any particular prompting or guidance.  If, after some period of time and assuming such a place is available, the customer would go to structured help, where they are prompted for particular types of information to make sure the request is complete.  For example, a place like that would ask for things like OS, product, version, steps to reproduce, and so on.  Finally, at some point, if no answer is forthcoming, they'll go to a fee-based solution, such as calling Microsoft PSS, where they have a very structured and interactive process for gathering needed information and a well-established and committed service level agreement.  So again, that's search, loosely structured discussions, strongly structured discussions, and pay for help.  How customers submit ideas for improvement works the same way, except for the final step, as people don't pay to give suggestions.  It sure would be great if they did, but let's get real.  So, community is the second step and the usual source for the first (search.)  The verbatim product feedback pillar of Zephyr is an effort to provide the third step.  Today, I think there is no strongly structured opportunity that includes Microsoft participation, and that's a step that's sorely needed.  I had some comments on a totally different subject, that is, what I think of the last couple of days of USA Today, which is delivered to my hotel room daily.  I have a meeting shortly, though, so I'll save that one for later.

      Right at the moment, I'm at TechEd in San Diego.  I just saw Steve Ballmer's keynote, and now I'm in a session on advanced T-SQL in SQL Server 2005.  Already very interesting, as it will add functions for row numbering, ranks, dense ranks and ntiles.  Very cool, as this has been a sticky problem in SQL Server 2000 and prior, while ORACLE has at least row numbering built-in.  I continue to feel that SQL Server is the coolest product Microsoft makes, at least outside the games group.  Now the speaker is talking about pivots.  Another awesome thing.  This is taking normalized data and turning it to a denormalized table or the reverse (which is unpivot.)  [I hope I have that description right - if I don't, and you read this, please comment and correct me.]  What's nice, is that the speaker is showing how to do these things in SQL Server 2000, not just saying, "Hey, next year you'll be able to do this stuff, but until then you're out of luck."  One problem at TechEd I've already seen is that access to my email has been impossible.  Neither RPC over HTTP via Outlook 2003 nor Outlook Web Access has been available.  I was concerned that it was just me, as I only recently got this laptop and set up my remote access stuff just before heading out the door, leaving it untested as I arrived onsite, but then I saw another Microsoft employee struggling with the same problem.  This is broken, so I hope it will be fixed soon.  I was coming to a session, but my coworker was headed to the cabana area to see if he could get some help.  The "networking angels" in the wireless lounges apparently weren't trained for fixing that kind of problem.  I guess later I can always try calling the help desk.  This hasn't stopped me from getting to the internet, as you can see.  If nothing else, I guess I'll pay the $10 for hotel room internet access tonight.  Getting down here turned out to be some ordeal.  The plane was delayed 50 minutes in Seattle.  A half-hour after take off, they were looking for a doctor or nurse on the flight to help a passenger.  Another half-hour and we were headed to Reno, Nevada to take the ill passenger off the flight.  While in Reno, a couple of wealthy but obnoxious guys in first class apparently got "unruly" enough that the flight crew had them removed from the plane.  There's a lot of paperwork for removing passengers under any circumstances, plus there's the whole new flight plan to get filed, so we were in Reno for quite a while.  I ended up arriving in San Diego three hours later than planned.  While I was able to meet my friend Roberto and his family for dinner Saturday night, that was about all I was able to do while hoping for something more than that.  Sunday was interesting.  I started by trying to wander around and meet IT professionals I could recruit to come to our focus groups on Monday and Tuesday nights.  I manage to meet quite a few in the morning.  Later, I took a break and went with Roberto and family to the San Diego zoo.  That would have been better if I'd been wearing sneakers instead of new dress shoes.  By the end of the day, my dogs were barkin'!  In the evening, I met with a number of people from the San Francisco NT Users Group, including the user group president, Doug Spindler.  That was a good time and it was great to meet a bunch of our customers.  I think I recruited all of them to come to at least one of the focus groups, which is good since I got stuck with the dinner bill.  People have no problem asking for the Microsoft guy to pay, which I guess is to be expected.  Hopefully, "increasing customer satisfaction, one meal at a time" will be acceptable when I submit my expense report.  Some of the SQL topics are getting ever more interesting, so I'm going pay even more attention and stop blogging.  Surely more later, even today.

      There's a Paul Oakenfold mix called Ready Steady Go.  I think I'm going to make that my anthem.  As I get my stuff together for the trip to San Diego, I find myself also laying out a set of goals - things I want to do over the next week.  Some of them are TechEd related, such as recruiting more people to come to our focus groups.  Some of them are related to other work, like working with Chandana and Ram to come up with sample review goals people at Microsoft can use to guide their experiences in community participation over the next year.  Some are personal, like I want to take some time to reflect on what affirmations I should consider to make the most important changes I desire in my life.  I've not used goal setting so much until coming to Microsoft.  I did a little of it before, but I've really focused on this much more lately.  That's good, because it works.  Affirmations is a different thing, and is the favorite method of David Allen, author of Getting Things Done, for focusing on the future.  I still have to work on improving my ability to use affirmations.  I want to spend a little time setting up my list of affirmations this next week.  I'll probably share at least a few here on this blog.

      This is initial setup, so I'm not going to get into to much.  I'm traveling tomorrow to Microsoft's TechEd, and I want to talk some about my experiences while I'm there.  I also plan to spend a little private time in the evenings doing some hard thinking on purpose and plans, and I may post the results here, so it's good to have it set up.  I started a blog on LiveJournal, but haven't kept it up.  I'm very interested, but this ability to do it through a web page seems somehow more likely that I'll puruse it.  We shall see.  Now, some full disclosure.  It's important to note that I am currently an employee at Microsoft. This blog may or may not touch on much of anything to do with technology or my job there, but just in case, the Microsoft disclosure is very important.

      I've been playing this game (on the XBox) a lot lately, and spent about half this weekend on it.  It's so addictive, especially since you get to compare you scores against everyone else in the world and your friends in particular.  What I've noticed this weekend in particular, though, is that winning in the Kudos World Racing at the medium difficulty level (that is, getting the silver medal) is not really as good of an indication of how good you are as it could be.  The reason is that each time you get to a new class of cars, you probably buy the best car in the class to do your races.  You therefore make up extra time on straightaways versus the computer opponents just because you have a better car.  I can tell that medium difficulty is actually harder than that because I played a bunch of the street race and timed run levels in the game where the car you drive is picked for you and is usually not the best car.  Medium difficulty there was much harder.  The good side is that I've learned more about how to take turns for maximum speed much better, although not nearly like the guys who are the top scorers on those boards.  There's one cone challenge level, the one that uses a Morgan Aero something-or-another, that I have a gold medal and came very close to the platinum.  On that one, I'm placed something like 1292 in the world, which for that level is something like 30,000 people.  I feel pretty good about that one.  Of course, you go look at the ghost for the top guy on that board and you see him execute the whole race flawlessly (okay, I did that - every cone gate plus slides between got me the whole race in one chained combo) but he throws in a couple 360s and extra slides that make his score just dwarf mine.  I could go on, but I need to go get some breakfast!  (Oh, look - racing and blogging both came before breakfast.  How interesting.)

      My twelve year old daughter, Elizabeth, went with her sixth grade class to the movies last Friday.  They saw Dodgeball, with Ben Stiller.  Unfortunately, all they had to say about the movie afterward was what happens in the final moments.  The woman that's the primary love interest in the movie apparently greets some other woman with a deep, passionate kiss.  The guys that are there then go on about how they didn't know she was a lesbian.  She replies with something like, "I'm not a lesbian, I'm bisexual!" and continues the kissing with one of the guys.  Why?  This had nothing to do with the rest of the movie, but was merely an unnecessary, gratuitous sex joke that ruined the movie for my daughter and her friends.  I can only imagine how horrified the teacher was, as I'm almost 100% certain he didn't know that was in there.  I know he had to field at least one question of "What's bisexual?" from one of his students.  Frankly, this is just a shame and further evidence of the extremely liberal slant of Hollywood.  It's no wonder I don't watch as many movies as I used to, although it's hard to tell considering the number of movie related posts I've made in this blog.  Maybe it's really that I am more particular about my movie choices, not that I watch any less.

      I have a Treo 600 now as my phone and Palm organizer.  This little device is awesome, and it's already made a world of difference in my productivity.  Since I don't have to mess about with multiple devices, I'm using it a lot more and capturing some of those random thoughts that hit me, go away, hit me again, and so on.  Even better, I got the Pocket Tunes application for it, plus a 256Mb SD card.  Just this very moment, a double album by Paul Oakenfold that's one of my favorites is copying in WMA format directly from Windows Media Player onto the Treo.  I have headphones and the adapter I mentioned in a previous post about shopping at Radio Shack, so I can listen to music directly off my phone any time.  I think about what life was like before cell phones, and PDAs, and all this cool technology, and I wonder how we did it.  I actually know how: we didn't know any better.

       urlLink http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,122653,00.html   From the article:  Johnson apparently was abducted Sunday by militants who also claimed responsibility for gunning down another American from the same firm the day before. They threatened to treat the captive as U.S. troops treated Iraqi detainees, a reference to the month-old abuse controversy at Abu Ghraib prison.  This is really good news!  Johnson only has to worry about being posed naked or wearing panties on his head, and those that do it will then be courtmartialed by their leadership.  If he once attended college, especially if he was in a fraternity, he should be able to weather that easily.  Meanwhile, back in reality, I know I'm preaching to the choir when I say that the death of Nick Berg illustrates the absurdity of that statement.

      Blogger is a really great product.  The last post, on the WarEngine, was done via email.  I have a secret address that I set within the blog settings to which I can send an email.  The email is converted to a post.  For those of you that have already used Blogger, this isn't probably news, but I'm pretty thrilled with it.

      I had someone today contact me about getting a license to The WarEngine, which is the tabletop miniature wargaming system I wrote when I was running DemonBlade Games many years ago.  They want to produce a new miniatures game, but are thinking that writing their own system is too much when there's a perfectly good, licensable system that has a built in fan-base.  Very cool!   I hope that they have their act together with regard to their business proposition, but since I'm going to offer a one time fee for licensing, my income from such a thing will not be tied to their success. Unfortunately, too many ventures in the miniatures business are poorly planned, under-funded and doomed to failure.  There's just not much money in it without a considerable up-front investment that most who venture into the business don't have, me included.   Still, it's very exciting when I get approached about this. It's the fourth time, if I'm recalling correctly, although no one has actually followed through and published.  Perhaps this time will be the time!

      I really enjoyed the movie "Spanish Prisoner" when I saw it.  It's a movie about a never-quite-defined, extremely valuable "process" that's the intellectual property of a company, and the intrigue that surrounds attempts by various parties to gain access to it.  The "process" is so valuable that there's enormous secrecy at the company and painstaking measures to protect it.  The movie is often compared to the better-known movie, "The Usual Suspects," but I think the dialogue in "Spanish Prisoner" is far more entertaining, as it's all complicated and filled with little side sayings and such, like the woman that just throws into a conversation the phrase, "Dog my cats."  The real point of this post, though, is that we have some new security posters that have gone up around campus, encouraging us to be careful with our intellectual property and security measures.  Every time I see one, I think of "Spanish Prisoner," where they had posters on the walls of the company with much the same theme.  One that springs to mind is a poster with some guy drowning in front of a sinking ship and the slogan, "Someone Talked!" emblazoned across the header.  It is, of course, a reference to the phrase, "Loose lips sink ships."  I'm in no way downplaying the importance of security and the protection of intellectual property, although I'm a firm believer in more transparency being good for product development.  But this is definately a case of life imitating art.

      On Saturday, I went to the movies - twice.  First I went to see "The Chronicles of Riddick", which is the sequel to "Pitch Black".  As a big fan of the first one, I was very happy to see a new movie exploring the character of Riddick further.  It was very interesting in that we get a much wider view of the universe in which Riddick lives, including that there are different species of human-like creatures and that Riddick is from one of the powerful but rare due to persecution species.  I'm not giving away much of anything with that statement, as they make it clear pretty fast.  There's also an interesting parallel drawn between the biblical story of Herod having all the Hebrew boys killed because of a prophesy and that of the Lord Marshall of the Necromunga doing the same thing with the Furions for the same reason.  Later in the day, I went to see "Troy".  This is a movie that will have to join the collection of modern epics that have been made, including "Gladiator", "Braveheart", "The Patriot", and the "Lord of the Rings" movies.  I particularly liked the way they took a story that could have included a lot of supernatural elements and presented it as an entirely human story.  The characters were, of course, all mythological heroes and villians with ancestry among the gods in the original story, but this telling sidesteps that, and the resulting focus on the characters and their emotional interaction without Greek gods dominating the stage results in what I think is a better movie than it would have been otherwise.  The reason behind the title to this post, though, is because it occurred to me a couple days later that the character of Riddick and the character of Achilles were cut from almost precisely the same mold.  They are both incredibly strong outsiders, although Riddick is a criminal where Achilles is not.  Achilles fights for Agammemnon, not because he cares whether the king wins or loses, but because he'll be remembered for the battles he wins.  When it doesn't suit his purposes, he's ready to leave or sit out the battle.  This is a direct parallel to Riddick's statement, "This is not my fight."  Both of them are also rather gloomy about the fact that we all die (at least for now - see my  urlLink prior post  on Kurzweil.)  When faced with other people trying to get them to act because more people will die if they don't, they point to the inevitability of death as a counterargument as to why they should bother.  I think it would be particularly interesting to take the scripts of the two movies, pull out the lines for Riddick and the lines for Achilles, and do some comparisons.  If they don't have a least a couple lines that are almost verbatim the same, I'd be very surprised.  Perhaps a quiz giving lines with an "Is it Riddick or Achilles speaking?" question lined up with each would be entertaining?  Not directly related to this topic, I'll also add that the race against time and a hostile planet that was the central activity of "Pitch Black" has its parallel in "Chronicles of Riddick" as Riddick leads an ever-dwindling group across the face of Crematoria, a planet with such extremes of temperature between night side and day side that humans can only survive in the narrow band between them, and if outside better run like hell.  It's also kind of fun that in the Riddick universe, no matter how violent and dangerous a planet is, no matter how odd the environment, humans can breathe the air just fine.  I think both of these movies are well worth the price of admission, and when they come out on DVD, they will be added to my collection as movies I expect to watch quite a few times.

I have an affirmation relating to blogging: "I am relaxed and have greater clarity of thought when I regularly post to my blog."  The affirmation may be working!

      One thing I've noticed in the focus groups (not that it's the only place I've heard this, but it jumped out at me) is the Google has become a verb.  One of the guys in the group said both "I google it to make sure I've got everything" and "that would come out when I'm googling it."  Someday, I would love to create a product that becomes a verb.  I think at that point, you can say, "I have arrived."

      I'm changing what I'm doing at work.  A slightly edited version (basically, I don't refer to people with their last names in my blog unless I know in advance it's okay) of my announcement to that effect is below:  Things change, and now is one of those times.  It is with mixed emotions that I announce that I am transitioning out of my role in the Windows Server community engagement initiative, effective immediately.  I am now feature program manager in Chris ...’s newly formed Server Feedback Systems team.  The SFS team is building the new replacement for Betaplace, Windows Beta, and the JDP/TAP web portal under the code name Taranna.  This is a natural extension of the work I've done over the past several months on verbatim product feedback, a pillar of the Zephyr project many of you have heard me discuss in conversation and presentation.  It is work vital to the future of Windows Server in a time where customers expect the responsiveness that comes from a direct channel between them and our product teams.  I am excited to have an opportunity to contribute to enabling this connection, and I’m looking forward to using and refining product planning skills that have mostly sat idle during my eighteen months at Microsoft so far.  At the same time, it is with reluctance that I turn over our community engagement effort to other hands, although that reluctance is tempered by the knowledge that those hands are very capable.  I had reduced my time on community over the past six months in order to get Zephyr up and running.  During that time, the bulk of the work fell to Chandana ..., who has performed extremely well and made community at least as much hers as it has been mine.  I am passing the torch to her now, confident that she will carry it forward and will see to it that we continue to succeed in this space.   Chandana will now be in the newly reorganized Customer Connection team and will be reporting to Linda ..., whose work leading the TAP program will likely be well known to many of you.  I will be working with Linda and Chandana over the next few weeks to insure as painless a transition as possible.  I encourage those of you on our partner teams to find time to introduce yourselves and your community related activities to Linda as soon as possible.   It has been a great pleasure to work on community and bring a stronger sense of connection to the customer for Windows Server product teams, and I’m grateful to have had the opportunity.  This new challenge, though, promises to be a great opportunity as well and so, I must move on.

      I'm currently in New York.  As an aside, I love this city, and wish I was staying for a few extra days.  But the primary reason for the trip is that we're conducting focus groups around a project we're doing at work.  What I wanted to say here is that it's really impressive and exciting to participate in this activity for the first time.  They treat us very well as the people (via Microsoft) funding the focus group.  We have a room with three tiers of desks, very nice chairs, access to the internet, food and drink, and a mirror window plus microphone to be able to listen in on the focus group itself.  It's very comfortable.  Beyond the sheer physical niceties, the ability to get a very targeted group of people together to go through a carefully planned out discussion to either validate or refute our assumptions in our planning is just downright cool.  I wish such things had been attainable for my small business!

      I had the best shopping experience in Radio Shack the other day.  I just wanted an adapter that would allow me to use regular headphones with my Treo 600 to listen to music - I have an application that makes it an MP3 player on top of everything else.  The sales guy, Matt, was totally into what the phone did and unhesitantly opened up a couple adapters and a pair of headphones in the store so I could try them out.  When the best choice of adapters didn't quite fit, he suggested trimming down some superfluous plastic so it would.  I asked if that was okay to do, and he said, "Hey, it's all cool, man!  Let's get this thing working before you spend any money on it."  He was looking for an Xacto knife to trim it down, then thought of using a pencil sharpener.  So he opened one of those, and some batteries.  When the adapter wouldn't fit in the pencil sharpener, he just moved on to the next possible solution.  In the end, I walked out of there with the right adapater, modified to fit well on the phone, and pleased with having had a great experience buying something.  How often can you say that?

       urlLink Microsoft Goes on the Community Offensive   This article pertains directly to my role at Microsoft.  It is focused, however, on the things going on with CDDG, our Content Delivery (mumble) Group.  I can never remember what the second D stands for.  Anyway, the technologies they are describing there are what are being built from a platforms perspective, and all good stuff.  The article doesn't touch on what's going on within the product divisions themselves, where we actual use the work CDDG does to try to drive greater connection with our community.  Still, good to see it talked about without any obvious element of cynicism.  [After the fact edit: CDDG stands for Content Development & Delivery Group.  No wonder I couldn't remember what came after Delivery.]

       urlLink http://avantbrowser.com/   This link is for Avant Browser.  It basically builds on top of Internet Explorer to make a superior browser.  I've been trying it out for the last couple of days, but this morning I noticed a feature that now has me hooked.  The feature is that you can set multiple home pages.  So, when you launch your browser for the first time, instead of it coming up with just one page, it can come up with two, or three, or more.  For example, I have an internal SharePoint site relating to community that I go to all the time.  I also want the Blogger window to be as quick as possible to get to.  Google is another.  Lately, I'd settled on the Blogger page and moved a few other links to the very top of my Favorites, but it's not ideal.  It seems so simple: add more starter pages.  But like so many simple things, it's only obvious once it's pointed out to you.  I'm sure there's more in this browser that's cool that I haven't discovered yet, but don't wait for me to tell you.  Try it out for yourself.

      At the beginning of the (calendar) year, I set goals for me and my "team" (I use quotes here because a team consisting of me and Chandana seems almost laughable to call a team) around what we would achieve for the Windows Server community engagement effort.  This set of six-month goals was, in the words of my manager's manager, very aggressive.  After my 1:1 with Chandana today, I see that we are almost finished with hitting almost every goal and target on the list!  There are one or two that we have chosen to defer and a half dozen successes in areas we didn't anticipate.  Those deferred are acceptable as priorities change and things that seem feasible up front can turn out to require much greater resources or investment than their value warrants.  The areas where we've had unexpected success are just icing on the cake.  All-in-all, FY04, spanning from July to June, is shaping up to have been one with enormous value and success for our endeavors in these area, and I'm very pleased.  It is my hope that my management chain will both recognize those successes and perhaps even reward me richly for my efforts.  As the only cautious part of this posting, I am well aware that success and recognition of success are all too often disconnected.  But the optimist in me swears that I'll be seeing much favor from above come September.

      Peer co-mentoring is a phrase I came up with to describe what I do with Trevor when we get together for lunch.  Since work schedules can be crazy at times, and Trevor now works in a different building than I do with a pretty social group of people, a couple months went by where we didn't get together very often, and when we did it was always with a bunch of others.  While there was nothing wrong with going to lunch with others, doing so at the expense of the conversations I've had with Trevor was a cost that made me unhappy.  So what we did was set up a recurring weekly "meeting" entitled "Peer Co-mentoring" to make sure that we got together for lunch at least once a week.  [Trevor, since you read my blog, you might want to stop reading this entry now.  I'm going to say more good things about talking to you, and if you read about it, your head might get all big (or should I say "bigger"?) and you'll be unable to get out the door of your office.]  The last time we got together we talked about quite a few different things.  First we both aired current frustrations, most of which have to do with work, or what we now call "villifying our enemies" in reference to article Trevor once described to me.  But then we hit on a few particularly interesting  subjects: why write a blog and what should be in it to make it engaging to a wider audience; Peter Drucker and his views on management, the purpose of companies, and the role of profit; and the concept of a personal satisfaction score, which we commonly refer to as "TSAT" and "ASAT" for "Trevor Satisfaction" and "Aaron Satisfaction."  I am planning to post further entries to this blog over the next couple days on these subjects and perhaps a couple others I left out, as it's now Friday and the conversation from Wednesday is still one of the things foremost on my mind.  How many conversations (not including, say words exchanged in anger) do you actively think about and expand upon in your own thoughts days later?  I'd wager (hah, another Texas Hold'Em reference!) that it's not very many.

      Last night Adam invited me and a couple other people over to his house to try out his new hobby, playing poker, or more specifically, Texas Hold'Em.  Texas Hold'Em is a version of poker where you have two cards you keep to yourself and there are five community cards.  You use the seven cards to make the best five card hand you can.  There are four rounds of betting each hand, unless everyone but the winner folds.  First, after you see your two private cards, then after the first three community cards are shown, then after the fourth, and finally after the fifth.  I was a little skeptical about how I'd enjoy it, as I've never liked the idea of gambling, so I was pleasantly surprised.  We were playing with bets that were only twenty cents in size, so there was little real risk, but it was just enough to make it kind of fun.  I came out of it with just under $3 in winnings, which based on twenty cent bets is something like "seven big bets" as Adam explained, although today that isn't quite adding up - I'll have to ask him again.  He said that's very good, as when he and his friend Chris play, they are content with 1.5 big bets per hour.  If you do that consistently, which I guess they both do, you can then count on winnings at 1.5 times the big bet per table you play on per hour.  Chris (again, Adam's friend, a male, rather than his wife, a female) has apparently played often, on three tables at once online, for stakes that are high enough that he's made some $27,000 playing poker in the last couple months, effectively more than I make at my job at Microsoft.  He's now facing what is apparently a common problem for gamblers - should he just do it as his primary means of making an income, leaving his job as a university professor?  If so, his new role in society is to make money by taking it directly from others.  At some point, when it becomes interesting for others to watch you play, I guess you become an entertainer, which is more like acting or professional sports, but on the way up, there's little in teh way of socially redeeming aspects to the work.  I'm sure for some, this is no problem.  I know I'd have a difficult time with it, although I think I could actually become pretty good at poker if I were to focus on it.  One of my early professional positions, I was writing software that was used for an accounting purpose - tracking the bills and payments for the lawyers that were representing insurance companies that were involved in lawsuits with other insurance companies they had insured (called reinsurance) where the "reinsured" company had taken losses from asbestos and environmental pollution claims and wanted reimbursement.  That was far away from anything I could consider socially redeeming, and even in my early twenties, it bothered me.  Yet, it could perhaps be considered more socially redeeming than being a middle-tier gambler.  But back to the game aspect.  In general, my problem with gambling is that I know it's something where the casino takes your money.  Poker does seem different, though, as there's an element of calculating odds, deciding when to bet or fold, plus some bluffing and reading other's emotions over their hands.  If you are a better player than those you play with, you will win money over time.  Adam and Chris have already proved that - Chris started with something like $10, Adam with $100, and they both declared they would quit if they ever lost that starting "seed money."  Neither has done that, and Chris is probably in the hundreds of thousands of dollars of winnings and Adam, who started much more recently after hearing Chris' success, was up about $500 as of last night.  So, would I play it again?  You bet!

The goggles worn in the bugs film gave me a headache. We also visited the Science Fiction Museum, which was very cool. It's all right under the Space Needle, which I have yet to go up in.   It's been nice to see some uniquely Seattle sights, something I've done too little of since moving here. Of course, the coral reef film tells me I must visit the South Pacific. One more place to visit&nbsp;in a long list.

       urlLink http://www.biparks.org/parks/info/info_gazzamlake.html  &nbsp; Sunday night, Trevor and I went to Bainbridge Island and visited both the pier at Point White and Gazzam Lake.&nbsp; It was key that we go at night, as Bainbridge was the location for one of our roleplaying adventures in Call of Cthulhu.&nbsp; In the game, our intrepid investigators had met with an American Indian guy at the pier, then sited a huge winged creature off-shore that we believe may have been the Great Cthulhu himself - fortunately seen from a great distance, thus the continued survival of the characters.&nbsp; Later, we tracked down a cult that was using the seclusion of Gazzam Lake at night to sacrifice the occasional resident to Cthulhu, who in keeping with Lovecraftian horror, couldn't care less. &nbsp; So despite the link above that presents Gazzam Lake as a beautiful nature preserve of untouched splendor, Trevor and I see it as a place of terror, perfect for a little nighttime visitation to capture the mood of the game. &nbsp; The sun set as we took the ferry to Bainbridge and there was much fun had pointing out things like "Look how the returning ferry... is empty!" and "See that substance floating in the water?&nbsp; Ectoplasmic slime of cthonians?&nbsp; Oh, wait, they avoid water - perhaps it's Deep Ones?" &nbsp; The pier's most entertaining element was that as we were just reaching it, there was an elderly woman all in white limping down the road.&nbsp; I dubbed her "The Zombie" as she was walking exactly as I would picture a partially-rigored undead creature to walk.&nbsp; When we were out on the pier and she was walking by the only escape path except the dark water, it sure look like she stopped a moment.&nbsp; Scary!&nbsp; &nbsp; The pier itself, in Trevor's game, included mysterious writing scribed by unknown hands.&nbsp; The real pier is also covered with difficult to understand symbols, although I think they were all by graduated classes of Bainbridge High School. &nbsp; We had seen a sign for Gazzam Lake on the way to the pier, so we ignored our directions and followed the signs.&nbsp; This was probably both good and bad.&nbsp; Looking at the photos in the above link, I think we went into the park from a lesser used entrance.&nbsp; When I parked the Jeep by the gate and turned off all the lights, it was probably 10:30pm and it was absolutely pitch black.&nbsp; Fortunately, Trevor had brought a flashlight. &nbsp; We followed the narrow, curvy trails through the woods for what was probably two miles each way.&nbsp; Spider webs had been constructed across the trail, so I was constantly getting that weird feeling that comes when some invisible, sticky thread catches on your cheek.&nbsp; At one point, an animal of some sort moved in the bushes near us.&nbsp; We heard it again on the way back, but it was on the other side of the trail - which means it crossed it sometime while we closer to the lake.&nbsp; Even little things like this help to play upon your fears when you're actively seeking to be scared. &nbsp; We did make it to the lake, but from a side where you can't see much.&nbsp; There was water, then tall reeds.&nbsp; I stepped out on a fallen tree to about ten feet off the shore, but I'd had enough of that when I saw one of the biggest spiders I'd seen in a long time hanging of a reed inches from me.&nbsp; (An aside: The biggest I remember, excepting tarantulas in Arizona, was a huge spider hanging off the side of our house in Rockville, it's body about as big as one of those "shooter marbles" I had as a kid.&nbsp; I killed that one, as I could stand having it on, and therefore potential in, my house.&nbsp; As I recall, I used a weedwhacker.) &nbsp; Around the time we were heading back, we started hearing creatures flapping around in the trees overhead.&nbsp; One of these did it's flapping around directly overhead, and that really made me jump.&nbsp; Trevor was unconcerned with the flying things, but I think that's because he didn't realize that what we were hearing wasn't feathery, but leathery! &nbsp; While we were out there, I kept thinking about stuff like the Blair Witch Project movie and the time John and I discovered a woman that had frozen to death in Alaska near the university.&nbsp; All good stuff for getting yourself creeped out when in pretty isolated woods on a moonless night. &nbsp; All-in-all, this was a worthwhile trip, and one that Trevor and I had been putting off for far too long.&nbsp; I think next I want to look up reported haunted locations in the Northwest and see about visiting them.&nbsp; It'll have to be at night.

      I love it when this happens: I was in a store today and what I bought cost $1.42.  I had a dollar bill and some change in my pocket.  I'm staring at the change trying to figure out what combination of coins would be best.  Suddenly, I realized I had exactly 42 cents in change - perfect!  That, my friend, is the awesome.

          OK, so my bag didn't  come around again after all.&nbsp; I got up to get it and noticed that an  airline guy had pulled it and three other bags off the carousel and was about to  take it back to a baggage office.&nbsp; Oh, no!&nbsp; Disaster looms!&nbsp; I  might have to go buy it off unclaimedbaggage.com!         &nbsp;     But I did get it, so  everything's okay.&nbsp; Then I went outside to wait for my ride.&nbsp; That's  where I am now, sitting in a Spirit Airlines wheelchair, looking like a very  computer savvy guy who can't walk.&nbsp; I wonder what it will look like to  others who are just seeing me for the first time when I get up?&nbsp; Maybe as I  get up I'll yell something about Jesus and miracles.         &nbsp;     One thing I have to  say about Washington, DC - it's really damn hot here!&nbsp; After living in  Seattle the past 18 months, I've been very happy to have mostly milder  weather.&nbsp; It's not as hot in the summer (most of the time) and nowhere near  as cold in the winter.&nbsp; I prefer cool weather, unlike Olympia, who isn't  happy until the asphalt is melting.&nbsp; I'm fine with simply putting on a  jacket.&nbsp; Maybe that's just because I just look better in jackets.&nbsp; (A  guy just walked by wearing socks and sandals, which I insist just looks plain  stupid on anyone.&nbsp; I thought they only did that on the West Coast.&nbsp;  Maybe he's visiting, too.)         &nbsp;     Did I mention it's  really damn hot?       &nbsp;

          I've just arrived on  the plane from Seattle for a long weekend visit to Maryland, and the airport is  not what I expected.&nbsp; Apparently, Alaska Airlines has moved around where it  is in National from the last time I was here.&nbsp; Coming out of the airplane,  instead of getting on one of those huge "people movers," you just walk down a  fairly short hallway into a big room that has ticket counters and baggage claim  in the same room.&nbsp; The TSA luggage scanner is sitting right in the middle  of the room.&nbsp; (Oh, look, there goes my bag on the carousel... good thing  it'll come around again.)&nbsp; I couldn't even find where my baggage was going  to come in at first, as the Alaska Airlines flight was listed on the Northwest  (there's my bag again) display.&nbsp; Of course, with only two baggage  carousels, how far would I have to go?&nbsp; The flight arrived in record time,  45 minutes ahead of schedule, so I have a bit of waiting to do for my ride to  show up.&nbsp; I only wish (there's my bag again) that this huge room had a  wireless network, either free or T-Mobile.&nbsp; I now associate Starbucks with  wireless networking rather than coffee, since I have never like coffee, but like  wireless networking quite a bit.&nbsp; (There's my bag again.)&nbsp; I guess  I'll put the laptop away and go get my bag, which I figure will be coming around  in just a moment - you think?

          It occurred to me  today while driving in my car that something that adds to whether or not I like  a particular song is whether or not the singer is singing in a key I can  reach.&nbsp; Yes, I sing along in my car.&nbsp; To me, I'm not that bad - your  opinion may vary.&nbsp; So I like music by Live or Staind or David Lee Roth  better than I might otherwise because they sing in a key that's natural to  me.&nbsp; I have to wonder if that's why (or an additional reason why) women  like women singers more than men do, for  example.

      It's been a very busy week, except that when I've been home I've done little else this week except work on jigsaw puzzles.  I was anxious to complete one called "The Breath of Gaia" which I was working on as a gift for Roberto's daughter Gaia.  I had already finished the one intended for Giusseppe (I now realize I'm not precisely sure how to spell his name - ack!) that's of a fire wizard and glows under black light.  Roberto and Monica have been very good friends of mine for some time and I really love their kids, too.  Putting together a couple puzzles for the kids, then gluing them so they become artwork was something I got the idea to do awhile back, and I've finally had the opportunity.  I gave them to them yesterday, so it's okay to post here about it now.  I think Roberto reads my blog sometimes and I didn't want to spoil the surprise.  I haven't done puzzles for a long time, and I'm finding their still a lot of fun - more now that I am in the mode of thinking I'll glue them together so they are kept.  I have to decide if I'm up to the challenge of this huge puzzle I saw at Uncle's Games, a Ravensburger puzzle with 5000 pieces.  The largest I've completed that I remember is 1500, although I was close to finishing a 2500 piece puzzle once when Olympia and my parents tried to move it from the first floor to the basement of our house in Rockville and dropped it down the stairs.

      OK, I found where the "villifying enemies" came from - it was a British psychoanalyst named Wilfred Bion who wrote about social interaction in the mid-20th century. He broke down group interaction into three basic areas or topics:   Engaging in flirtatious sex talk amongst pairs  Identifying and villifying enemies  Nominate and venerate a hero beyond critique   The next time you find yourself in a social group setting, take a moment to analyze what it is you're really talking about and see if it shows up in that very short list.
