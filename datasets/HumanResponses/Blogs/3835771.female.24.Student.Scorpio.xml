      So The Boy and I flew up to the Gold Coast last Sunday morning for a few days of rest and relaxation. In hindsight we could have probably got the same quality of r & r some where else in NSW, but TB had not been up north before and I think the psychological effect of catching a flight and landing somewhere else must do something to the natural muscle relaxers (if you don't have any anxiety of flying).  The Gold Coast is an interesting place for the international tourist. There are theme parks, golf courses, beaches, designer shops, places to eat and be merry. For the average Australian tourist it can be abit of a dizzy spell in your own back yard. Strangely though I felt out of place when out amongst the crowd. It may have been the long dark hair, the brown skin and my winter hoodie. Everyone else who was Australian was blonde, bronzed and wearing a bikini. I just can't help but like the cold. Even though I complain, nothing says comfort to me than a pair of jeans, sneakers, a hoodie and a scarf. Hoodie and scarf taken off, I did enjoy the sun and warm temperature for some part of the day. However after a walk mid afternoon I was scrambling into the hotel for a nice fresh breeze of airconditioning.  The whole area which comes under the banner of the Gold Coast (Broadbeach, Surfers, Main Beach etc) has definitely been constructed for the sole purpose of tourism - which is why in the low season (now) the streets are not so crowded, the beaches scattered with a few avid surfers and sun worshipers (not me!) and tourists. I found it intriguing that there were so many tourists who were Muslim. Now Australia being such a multi-cultural country, they could have been fellow Aussies, but even in Bankstown or Auburn I do not see this many women dressed in the muslim head and body dress. I thought that their presence was fantastic. Purely because of my Orientalist and Post -Colonial sensibility. So that was one interesting observation. I asked The Boy why the Gold Coast would be such a magnet for people who travel from Dubai, Iran or other Muslim states. He wasn't sure and neither am I. The other type of tourist was the quintessential Japanese tourist, however I could also see the Korean and Chinese amongst them also. So the demographic is mostly made up of tourists and retirees (lots of golf courses and canals) and builders. According to both taxi drivers from and to the airport high risers are going up like the sun - daily.  Our days were mostly made up of sleeping in, breakfast at 10:30am, going for a walk, coffee, beach, interchanging window shopping, movies, walks, talks, food with each other, mid-day snoozes, dinner, walks, tv etc. I did however get caught watching the Democratic Convention a few times. Nothing better than American politics to ge the blood boiling - but the Democrats rock, especially Clinton. The hotel was nice, see  urlLink this blog  for a peek into B Grade Celebs at breakfast time.  We flew up and back with Virgin Blue which was a no brainer. Jet Star is crap, as locations which they land are usualy way off course and tickets are still overpriced. Virgin does the job. It was great coming home. Seeing the city lights of Sydney. I knew I was back. Whilst standing in the taxi line (great system they have at the domestic terminal) business travellers stood in their winter coats, mobiles glued to side of their head, fumbling for cab charges with dreary looks on their faces I definitely knew I was home. Along with the scarf and hoodie wrapped tight and zipped up.  LovePeaceRespectHumility

      Tonight I have three dvd's, smoked salmon dip (it was on sale), water crackers (home brand only 99c - how good is that!), wine ( abit of a splurge - life is too short to drink cheap wine) and The Boy.  We are watching Spirited Away, The Royal Tenenbaums & Delicatessen - all favourites of mine.  So nice night in. It's our committed effort at saving money, which is a must for me. I have to save at least a $1000 a month. Hopefully the tax man will also give some back when I put my return in next week. Maybe I might try that e-tax thingie.  However, I got my mobile bills today, and after a month of being super careful with my calls and texting I STILL got a extremely large bill of $160 bucks. I just do. not. understand!!?? The only time I ever made a $50 phone bill was in August 2001. I was in Thailand for the month of July. Also got the credit card bill - after the GC and the last two concerts we went to ... the balance is not looking good. : /  LovePeaceRespectHumility

      Back in Sydney (home) as of Wednesday night. It's nice to be back. I couldn't help but smile when I saw the city lights from the plane window. Sydney really is a marvelous city. I don't think I could be away from it for too long. Aside from the BS that some people put on, the city itself&nbsp;can be nice to its residents.   At work at the moment, so will write a wrap up blog of my trip to the Gold Coast and other stuff which are on my mind at the moment tonight or tomorrow. &nbsp;Goodness I'm at a stage of blogging where I need due dates.   North America Trip Update: I have a travel buddy now. My school buddy/ life long friend's sister is joining me. She is a professional traveller, so its great to have her on board. She is also hilariously funny, sarcastic, honest and intelligent - should make for a great trip. So now we are doing NYC, Toronto, Montreal, Quebec, Boston & Washington. I also realised that I'll be there for Thanksgiving. Should be interesting!   &nbsp;  LovePeaceRespectHumility

      So I know this is definitely geek behaviour ... to blog whilst on vacation. But I have time to kill and I needed to do some internet banking.   We ended up staying at this  urlLink classy joint  in the Gold Coast, and our fellow guests happen to be evictees from  urlLink Big Brother . At breakfast I have so far seen Elle, Terri, Igor, Catherine&nbsp;and Violeta. Whilst sitting at the Internet kiosk Ive sat next to Trevor's mum (she is so lovely) and Monica.. who in real life is quite attractive in a very conventional way. So I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing.   Last night The Boy and I had beer and pizza. Argh.   Krystal has just walked into the lobby. This resort is full of B Grade celebrities.   Anyway... I better go before I get in trouble with The Boy   LovePeaceRespectHumility

      It's  urlLink raining &nbsp;in Sydney. And its lovely. I love it. The only thing&nbsp;I don't like about rain is going outside when its dark and raining. I will need to do this tonight.   Usual Saturday morning with the kids at the computer lab. Met some of the girls for a coffee afterwards. Amazing what a year does to people's connections with one another. Or maybe I am more picky.   I am dying my hair   crimson   today... not dramatic, but after a year of doing it, my hair has a nice burgundy tone. I might also trim the fringe for j5.   Five things you should not do on the bus  1. Hold a conversation whilst on the mobile phone which the WHOLE bus can hear for the WHOLE trip  2. Fart  3. Snort and gargle your phlem&nbsp;for the whole trip  4. Eat smelly food in the bus  5. Put your wet umbrella on the seat next to you, which prevents the next passenger to have a ride in comfort.   All of the above took place on my bus ride back home this afternoon. Offences commited by others. I was not pleased.   Must go pack now. And get ready for tonight.    "I need a beat .... a beat!"      Listening to Track 17 from Power in Numbers, j5- really loud.   LovePeaceRespectHumility

      I feel a tad hopeless right about now. I should have gone to sleep 2 hours ago, so that I would not be up late on my own thinking. I am thinking about :   1. The silent treatment between my mother and I since early May. We haven't had a decent conversation. We have had a screaming fight three times and thats it. Mother's Day has passed and so has her birthday. I wonder how long it will last. I've had enough, so I think it may last until I leave for New York which is in November. At least I'll be able to finish my assignments off without being nagged and screamed at this semester.   2. I need to get out and start exercising again. I might start walking to work instead of catching the bus from the train station in the mornings. It is a good 20 - 25 minute walk. Three times a week should be good.   3. I need to take my nail polish off, buff, shape and re-apply before I got to GC.   4. I want an  urlLink OkayPlayer  hoodie. They have run out of stock online. Must remember to check in a few weeks. $62US. I should be saving for my trip instead.   5. I  miss  The Boy. I saw him last night, at dinner and drinks with the gang. But I was distracted (when I shouldn't have been). He is so   lovely  . I will see him tomorrow, so that makes me happy.   (BB: Ryan was evicted. Interesting. Bree needs to go - she is annoying me. GC girls scare me. I think its their blond hair and aura of confidence.)   LovePeaceRespect  Humility

      Well I had a day off today ... the aim was to sleep in late ... get up and clean my room & do my laundry. You think this would be possible. It doesn't require any major hard yakka. It doesn't require much organisation. Nor does it even cost me anything. But no ... here I am sitting at my computer, surrounded by a floor of clothes and books and mess. I tidied up last Friday ... so I don't even know how this happened. I don't even have any children to blame. My gorgeous sister walked in before she left for work and asked me how&nbsp;I live like this. I felt ashamed. For the first time at the state of my room. I must clean it before she is home and show her first thing.   So now that I have confessed .... Its Friday. I worked four days this week, so that I could have Wednesday off. The Boy and I are going to the Gold Coast. We leave on Sunday.What a coincidence that it is going to be the final BB Eviction. We might watch Sunday and Monday at the Hard Rock Cafe. There should be a good crowd. I don't think The Boy will be all too pleased, but I'm sure I could be nice to him before hand and work the magic. Eeeeerrr... no. I'll need to beg. He hates it when I beg... so it works.   Tomorrow I will do my volunteer work as usual. I look forward to seeing the kids. They make me smile and they aren't too judgmental. However they have been the toughest audience I've come across. Eventually they like you and want to know everything about you. Play with your hair and stuff. In between all that I try to show them stuff on the computer, internet. Mmmmm   J5 concert also on tomorrow. I've been listening to Quality Control for the best half of this month, so might need to pop Power in Number in the player tonight and tomorrow. Looking forward to their show. Always empowering and inspirational. I am especially digging Contribution. One article in Brag spoke about how J5 could equate to Islamic rap. I find this really interesting as a lot of the crowd (at least from last October Roots/j5 concert) were white home-boys and the even the brown ones looked "white". I wonder if their Australian fanbase realise this. It also makes me wonder which category I fit in. Always an identity crisis. I can hear my friends ask "Deb, Why must you do this to your self? ...Over analyse EVERTHING"   Today along with my cleaning procrastination I ate four slices of bread with nutella. How horrific. I will put today as a mistake as I also ate a piece of meat from a&nbsp;chinese stirfry. I felt ill. As I haven't had red meat for about 3 weeks now. I don't think I can do it to myself anymore. The "Vegetable Focused" diet makes me feel much better. I am going to try the Soup Diet when I get back from the G'S.   Well maybe I should go do some work or something. It's Friday Night at Home tonight. It's all about saving the big $$$. The Boy and I decided we should start our list of movies we have seen in the course of our relationship since its the most consistent thing we do on a weekly basis. That is 6 years of memories. It all started with&nbsp;ANTZ on the 1st of November 1998. :)   Maybe I'll start on that. David Stratton has kept a book of all the films he has seen since the age of 9. When  1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die  was published, his total was 21, 792. Amazing.   &nbsp;  LovePeaceRespectHumility

      Goodness I haven't posted for a few days ... Been busy with work and being cold in the evenings. I've done tons of research for my trip, and will probably book my accommodation in the next month or so. NYC may prove abit difficult to get decent accommodation ... but hey Im not too worried over it. I'm not going to one of &nbsp;the most amazing cities in the world to sleep in a room.   Also watched Fahrenheit 9/11 .... was very interesting. I think I need to formulate my thoughts on it for a separate post. I am a fan of Moore and I think with his wit, humour and passion for politics he is reaching an audience and moving people towards a more rational train of thought. All this and more in my next post, when I'm not so cold and tired.   Also started and finished reading&nbsp;The Da Vinci code... was very good and glad I finally got around to reading it. This also requires&nbsp; separate post as the things brought up in the book made so much sense to me, in terms of theology and the tradition of Christianity. Being educated and brought up in a Catholic environment I never quite bought into the stories, however found a lot of strength in Jesus' quest for equality amongst humans. I would like to learn so much more from a historical perspective about Jesus and his social and political agenda. Make me look at the Passion so much more differently and how Mary Magdalene was portrayed.   Have the J5 concert this Saturday and then flying up the Gold Coast with The Boy for a few days before uni starts. Got my results today ... was happy Distinction and Two Credits.   Sleep... but I want to watch the&nbsp;repeat of the &nbsp;Denton Clinton interview. He is one sexy dawg... Clinton that is. I read a few pages from his book... and you know oral sex aside I have much respect for the man. And who are we to judge a little night time nookie. Ok its bad... but.... all that aside. He was America's first " Black President ". The man chose Harlem as his location for his office when any Manhattan. I'm sure there's other stuff which is even more commendable. His words of Mandela also spoke to me. So I want to go watch again. Billy. Such a cute name.   Love  Peace   RespectHumility

      So as of yesterday I am booked and ready to make my first trip to the U.S of A. My e-ticket is in my draw with my passport, so all i have to do now is save $$$ and pack! Oh and organise everthing for when I get there How exciting!   Whilst their leader absolutely grates me... I have been silently and sometimes vocally obsessive of my desire to go to New York and see it for myself.   This trip is going to be of the shoe-string variety ... I am very excited and looking forward to it. It is 3 months away, I leave on the 7th of November for 4 weeks. I am planning on doing a train journey to and in Canada (another one on my places to visit). Looks like it will be 1 week in New York, 2 and 1/2 weeks split between Toronto & Quebec and then back to New York for my last week; I might finish it off with some work experience if I can organise it.  So my list of things to do in New York has started. Here it is so far: * Take a ferry to Staten Island and also get to see the beautiful Statue of Liberty * Central Park walks * Pizza, Pretzels and Motzo Ball Soup * Visit a soul kitchen * Basket Ball/ Baseball game * Museums * Magnolia Bakery or Billy's Bakery (or both!) * Empire State Building * Times Square * Visit the 5 boroughs - walk, shop & observe * New York Library * Grand Central Station * Greenwich Village * Catch a live show of one of my favourite artists ( Im dreaming Maxwell - *sigh*)  and its growing!  So next I am looking for youth hostels. Anyone in New York want a roomie for 7 days? I'll make you breakie every morning! hehehe  I'll probably use this blog as a sound bard for ideas for the trip.  So on another note... its Friday... meaning movie time  There are tons of movies I want to see ... hmmmmm       LovePeaceRespectHumility

      I woke up with the most crazy dizzy spell ever ... and now at work I can still feel it. I hope its not the new vege-fishetarian eating habit I have started. mmmm  The lady at the cafe annoyed me this morning. Because I pick up my school's  daily newspaper on my way in to the office and the Newsagency on campus is closed over uni break, I have to go to the cafe instead to pick up the paper. I work three days a week, and every time I go in their and ask for "The Behavioural School's Paper" she looks at me as if she has never heard me before. Don't people have a memory these days? "I'm sorry, what paper?" she asks. Or " How many papers are you collecting?" For christsake woman... I know the school I work for is the only school on the campus who gets the Sydney Morning Herald and The Australian ... use your brain!! Complacency I say! It's something Australians suffer from in all parts of our lives be it ... work, play, politics, culture!  I better get back to work ... hmmmphhh  LovePeaceRespectHumility

      I need to prioritise and get my self organised. I have been on uni break for a few weeks now and my room still looks like a bomb has hit,  my texts I used for essays are still on a pile near my door, my washed clothes have now migrated to a heap near my bookshelf, my dirty clothes hamper looks like its breeding, the scarves I wear are piled up on my tall boy when they should be folded and neatly stashed on the bottom draw, my shoe cupboard is in disarray and I have shoes all over my room, books are falling off from my shelf and my makeup/toileteries shelf looks like a demolished site.     Aim for today  1. Clean Room (books off the floor, clothes folded and put away, clothes washed, scarves folded, shoes organised, bookshelf organised, wardrobe organised)  2. Clean my bathroom  3. Cook food  4. Coffee with cousin Sonali  I am also 85% sure about my trip to NYC & Canada. How can I pass up $850 worth of United Airline credit points and live with myself. I say things happen for a reason and if someone gives you credit points to travel - TAKE THEM dammit! My ticket is only going to cost me about 1300 in the end. Fingers crossed everything will work out. If it so happens that I book my ticket this week... it will mean SAVING the BIG BUCKS, no buying food from out, entertainment sliced to a minimum and no more splurges. It will be worth it  Yesterday was super. I took some of my three younger cousins (16, 12, 7) to the  urlLink MCA  and we saw the Biennale. I was little unsure about taking the two younger ones, wondering if it would be too overwhelming. But I am happy I went with my instincts about showing them a different space and concepts, which they might not understand but will be able to place when the bigger picture becomes clearer for them. They all loved the Gordon Hookey exhibit - I think I was beaming after I asked them which was their favourite and why. Wow! They totally understood the political agenda and the Indigenous message. Even the 7 year old - in her own way. This experience confirmed that it is possible to instill a set of values with a social and or political element into kids which will make them understand the world much more when they are older. Thank you Mr. Hookey for giving us the opportunity to explore that as a family.   We also went to Pancakes on the Rocks where we feasted on Savoury dishes made from pancakes or crepes. And celebrated Chris's birthday. Was yummy! We went to the Nelson Mandela gallery at the rocks and finished the day off with gelato. I had apple and mango!  LovePeaceRespectHumility

      Listening to Koori Radio, this song came on just as I was about to log off the net. Love this song... the message is so true. And reminds me of the heated debates I have with some folk about rights of our Indigenous peoples of Australia. "We who believe in freedom cannot rest". If we want our Indigenous people to be equal, then their freedom needs to be respected and ensured. I will find a way to post my 'Taking Reconcilition Forward' essay as it basically sums up the message. I think this song does also.      Ella's Song     Lyrics and music by Bernice Johnson Reagon   Sung by Sweet Honey in the Rock    We who believe in freedom cannot rest  We who believe in freedom cannot rest until it comes   Until the killing of black men, black mothers' sons  Is as important as the killing of white men, white mothers' sons   That which touches me most is that I had a chance to work with people  Passing on to others that which was passed on to me   To me young people come first, they have the courage where we fail  And if I can but shed some light as they carry us through the gale   The older I get the better I know that the secret of my going on  Is when the reins are in the hands of the young, who dare to run against the storm   Not needing to clutch for power, not needing the light just to shine on me  I need to be one in the number as we stand against tyranny   Struggling myself don't mean a whole lot, I've come to realize  That teaching others to stand up and fight is the only way my struggle survives   I'm a woman who speaks in a voice and I must be heard  At times I can be quite difficult, I'll bow to no man's word   We who believe in freedom cannot rest  We who believe in freedom cannot rest until it comes   LovePeaceRespectHumility

      Good morning,  Well last night's eviction was predictable and suprising at the same time. Monica - expectable. Ashalea - I thought she would stay at least another week. I definitely though Catherine would go.   Glad to see Monica go though - seriously she is like 30 something and acts like a 15 year old who has been let out on a night without a curfew. Grow up woman and stop hiding behind victimhood. Men aren't to blame when it comes to women like her. They set themselves up to be treated like crap if they can't respect themselves.  Ashalea the little thing - she is so innocent its not funny... you really wonder if its an act or not. Glad she wasn't in the last 5, 4 or 3 to win the one mill... I'd be worried.  Bree & Cath need to leave asap! Ryan is starting to annoy me. Lets hope it goes to Trevor or Paul.  Had Masala Dosai & Vegie Kottharoti last night from the Sri Lankan Food Bar - Janani last night. Was yummy! I think I can do the vegetarian thing again. Lat time I lasted 18 months, until I became sick.   So today is my Dad and Mum's birthday, and also my cousin Christophers. I am taking Chris, Cara and Avanthi to the Art Gallery and then to Pancakes on the Rocks. It should be nice. :)  Da Vinci Code is getting better. It not raining so much today, so might try to get some laundry done too. It sux not having a dryer anymore.  Listening to Koori Radio 93.7 FM - The Stiff Gins  LovePeaceRespectHumility

      So JBT was good. The Boy & I managed to have 2 arguments on our way there, get stuck in traffic for 40 minutes, have an argument at the concert - but we kissed and made up 3 times too. I think I was seriously hormonal on Friday.   Overall the concert itself was great. Whilst I think TBoy enjoyed it much more - the jams were the best. Drummer Boy's always make me happy.  However one thing which pissed me off... we had found a nice little place to stand and enjoy the music and be lovers (hehe)... and mid-way through these stoooopid people came by and parked themselves next to us. They then proceeded to talk, yelp, scream and do other noisy things other than enjoy the music and vibe of the place. It really shits me and baffles me why people pay to go see a band and proceed to carry on a LOUD conversation and carry out "role plays" right then and there. GRRRRR!!!  I was starving on the way home so we stopped by at McDonalds. Not a fan but we were STARVING. After seeing Super Size me a few months ago... this was the last place I wanted to be at 11:30pm on Friday night, but as I said... we were STARVING. Had a vegie burger though... and whilst home-made is probably a better option... it was actually quite nice. They have supposedly improved the recipe so there ya go. Maccas seem to be making more of an effort to make their food more healthy and offer other healthier options. There is a difference between McDonalds America and McDonalds Australia I think - not that I'm an advocate, but I think finally they get the picture and are doing something about their track record.   So Saturday I did my volunteer thing - was good session and all. Had lunch with Sujin at a Korean restaurant - had  urlLink Bie Bim Bap  - was delish. After her staying with us for a month I have learnt even more about Korea and Korean food... which has creeped up as a favourite. Whilst Thai is certianly flavoursome... there is something about  urlLink Korean food  which I love. I think its all the side dishes and simple flavours. Afterwards did abit of grocery shopping for my weeks lunch etc and came home.  I started reading The Da Vinci Code on my way to Redfern yesterday - and already I am addicted. Can't wait to creep back into bed and continue reading.  Last night we went out with cousins and their partners and tag-a-longs... had a few drinks. Probably a few too many for me... as I woke up at 1pm today - shock horror! Was a good night, except had a few tag-a-longs who thought they were to good for chosen venue and decided to sulk. Silly people... need a certain kind of place when there are like 15 of us who just want to sit back chill. I can still taste the Frangelico with Lime ... mmmm yumm!  This weekend (so far) has prompted me to do a Whats Hots Whats Not every so often. Maybe its old age (aka maturity), but I seem to get grated even more so when I go out or even stay in. I hope this isnt the path to bitterness. *ponder*  Off to do some research now on hostels in NYC and Toronto - need to see if this trip is do'able with my financial situation!

      Oh am I am a happy girl this arvo... I got my Reconciliation Studies final essay back in the mail... and I got a Distinction. The comments from my lecturer were lovely too - bless! She said with more refinement... I can work the essay up to a HD. Wonderful!   This is very much wanted after I got my Comparative Social Change review back. ARGH. Gotta email the lecturer about that one - have left it for the last two days.   ANYWAY ....  Distinction! Gonna have to celebrate tonight and tomorrow. On my way to get ready for tonight, it cold and I want to play on the computer, not go out. But I am gonna see my sweetheart. Even though the two brief calls I've had with him today have been have been annoying! Anyway ... Positive ++++    LovePeaceRespectHumility

      So being a student working part-time and paying my own way can be a challenge. I am lucky that I still live at home (however that is debateable on a purely psychological well being point of view) that I dont pay rent. However I still pay board and buy my own food, pay for personal items, clothes, entertainment, uni stuff and the miscellaneous.  So after reading a blog by a chick in Adelaide,  urlLink Noranna  who is a self described budgeteer I have decided to follow suit and find the cheap side of  Sydney  - for a girl who still wants to feel like she alive without having it spend like its her last day on earth.  For me the most money I spend is on entertainment, books, music, food (dining and snacking) So for the moment ... i will try to find the cheap side of experiencing all of the above without really having to give up on the things which make life that much sweeter. Hopefully this will help my own saving plan (which has been successful this year - thank god!) It will also need to continue this way if a trip to the U.S. is on the books for November.   So... this week I will be researching the cheap side of  Entertainment  and shall report back. Entertainment will be classed as: Movies, Plays, Theatre, Concerts, Museums, Art Galleries etc. Some other new ones may pop up in the course of my research.  Speaking of entertainment, tonight we have JBT concert on at the Horden. Looking forward to it... his voice melts me, and the music... wow. I think I might wear my new blue scarf i bought yesterday from Sportsgirl.  Ill probably write later, being the net addict that I am. Now I have found an extra reason to stay online - to blog. Uni holidays are on... I will need structure when I get back to my final semester - yay!  Peace

      Had a lovely day ... A bit crazy with an 8 year old boy who is fun and hectic to handle at the same time. Movies, Thickshakes, Tiny Teddy Choc Biscuits, Shopping ... fun fun fun. :)  Wesley was correctly evicted tonight on BB... Why is that I start to like someone when they have been booted. I thought he was a conservative preppy sh**, but he was sweet in the end. I think this replicates into my own life. I can be very critical of someone up until they have to leave, or we share a special moment. I need to be a nicer person. Saying that... I don't know who I want to to win... Just sure it I don't want Ash (she is just silly) and Cath( not sure how honest she is even though she projects as if she is)   So I have new sheets on my bed (woohoo) and two new novels to read this week (The Davinci Code and The Girl in Time Square)... I have the BT whispers and for me... this is exciting. What would make it complete is if I has The Boy already asleep in bed so I could wrap my leg between his... do abit of reading and then fall asleep next to him. *blush blush*  I finished  last week and I haven't been able to  urlLink 'Drinking Coffee Elsewhere' get into another book this week, so my bus trips have been boring and only involving me looking out the window - thus making the transport to work or wherever longer than what it really is. Hopefully these two books will stop that. I find it hard to move on after a good book... I think about the characters non-stop. I need to find more ZZ Packer material - she rocks!  Tomorrow night The Boy and I are going to see the  urlLink John Butler Trio  ... exciting. Should be a good night out. However can the 24th of July come by any quicker ... Can't wait to boogie to J5. How exciting. :)  The whispers are now becoming yelps. Bonne Nuit.

      He is so patient. So wonderful. So caring. I love him. For 6 years now he has been a part of my life. The good thing which has kept me sane and made me stronger. We have had our tough times and I'm sure there is more to come. But he is my strength and every day I love him more. On Saturday I was just staring at him. Those dimples. Gorgeous. So special... I would have to be the luckiest girl.

      So its been a couple of days since my last post ... like anyone is reading this online(!) Ive decided I need to be less depressive in my posts ... some how you get caught in writing about angst... it becomes a sad state of affairs. I thought I'd try to write at least once a day, but this week its been a case of fending of the cold winter chill once I get home by sitting infront of the heater... cooking, eating, washing up and watching tv. Monday nights Im hopeless ... its Big Brother Post-Eviction/ Nominations Show (omg Bree was incorrectly evicted AND returned to the "zoo" - Prep Boy Wesley is definitely going Thurs (today)) and Queer Eye ... so i can hardly tear myself away from the lounge. Tuesday I had to go speak to solicitors as I have been called as a witness and Wednesday... too cold so sat infront of heater and rugged up... watching BB and other stuff.   So today (Thurs) is my day off from work... I have a 6 day break till I go back... and its pretty much going to be hectic over the next couple of days.  Ive decided to completely ignore the mess I am living in and am taking out my cousins son to the city to watch a movie. Probably Shrek 2, which I have already seen, but have no problem watching again - it should be fun!  Well I best be off - have to wash the mane and the little one doesnt like to be kept waiting.  Peace

      Back when I was a child, before life removed all the innocence My father would lift me high and dance with my mother and me and then Spin me around ‘til I fell asleep Then up the stairs he would carry me And I knew for sure I was loved If I could get another chance, another walk, another dance with him I’d play a song that would never, ever end How I’d love, love, love To dance with my father again When I and my mother would disagree To get my way, I would run from her to him He’d make me laugh just to comfort me Then finally make me do just what my mama said Later that night when I was asleep He left a dollar under my sheet Never dreamed that he would be gone from me If I could steal one final glance, one final step, one final dance with him I’d play a song that would never, ever end ‘Cause I’d love, love, love To dance with my father again Sometimes I’d listen outside her door And I’d hear how my mother cried for him I pray for her even more than me I pray for her even more than me I know I’m praying for much too much But could you send back the only man she loved I know you don’t do it usually But dear Lord she’s dying To dance with my father again Every night I fall asleep and this is all I ever dream

      So this is what happen to me when I've been lazy for most of the day and I've been thinking too much. I don't know where to start to make this "blogging journey" worthwhile. I guess I should layout what my life/weekly routine is currently at. You can already see I'm writing this with the idea that someone may be reading it ... So incase we have come to that point here it is... the specs...  I was born in Sri Lanka and came here when I was 4. I've left the country 3 times; back to Sri Lanka when I was 13 for my god fathers wedding, 2nd time when I was 21 went to Thailand with The Boy- we traveled around the country for 4 weeks. Had the best time! And the 3rd time last December - went to Sri Lanka again for a wedding - was there for 5 weeks. The Boy who I had just gotten back with after 8 months or so apart suprised me by turning up in Colombo airport 3 days after I arrived - bless! He is magnificent. So back to me... thats the traveling I have done thus far ... But my heart has done more. I am the kid of person who buys second hand travel guides and pours through them like a novel. The idea of travel and every continent on earth thrills me. There is no place I don't want to go - every country appeals to me. I hope to do some more travel at the end of the year ... I must or ill bust!  So back here in Sydney I am completing my Communications degree with a major in social inquiry. Totally love the degree, the philosophy behind it and the knowledge, experiences I have gained from it. I hit a wall mid way whilst being distracted by corporate Australia ( I talk like I was an executive - team co-ordinator was enough for this one!)m but I am back on track and will be finished at the end of the year - give or take 1 subject in summer school. So at the moment not quite sure where I will go to from here. I feel I still need to  and want to grow academically and hopefully find me bearings personally. After a year of volunteering with a community organisation I find that I really enjoy the teaching and learning experience... So I may try my hand at that. Without sounding like I was at a wine tasting night... I think the feeling I have now is less of dabbling in the idea, but exploring the idea of being in a learning environment and being someone's teacher... passing on knowledge and making it a enjoyable experience. I have had such different learning experiences, and the ones which have yielded the most successful results have been one where I have been inspired by my teacher ... Id like to be part of the same thing if I end up with a teaching career.  What else...  I live with my family ... my sis and mum. My father passed away suddenly when I was 6. He had a heart attack at the age of 36. Whilst I knew it was a young age for someone to die, I suppose its been more of a reality for me once I turned 18 and finished high school. I really missed him and having a father in those summer months. It was like I was grieving... for the first time since he died. Since then his death has always been part of daily thoughts. I would like to separate death from my father - it seems that's the only way I really remember him. I feel saddended by this, because from what people have told me, he was very much an "alive" type of person. Now that I am 24 ... I am closer to the age of 36, and realised that he only had the chance to live just a part of his life, and with a young family in a new country it was just coming together for him. I wish he had the opportunity - this is what saddens me the most. When I am down I seem to revert back to these feelings... and wonder what life would have been like with him in my life as a physical force. It would have been different. For me, for my sister and for my mother. I feel at this time in my life I have lost my connection to my family (for a multi-tude of reasons), and in my most darkest hour its when I wish he never left us - things would have been so much more different for us as a family.   It is late now ... so I will continue this tomorrow...

      These lyrics will always taken me back to 1998, sitting in my lounge room with a lump in my throat and an even bigger lump in my heart. The person knows who they are, but we have both moved to a different space in our lives. Without sounding too "soppy", because  god knows how I hate soppy ... this song basically sums up the whole experience. The whole experience was about words, our words, the words of talented wonderful artists the only way we could really share how we felt about one another. Sometimes I need to think as to whether the feelings were real... for me it was.   Sometimes I get tired of this me first attitude You are the one thing that keeps me smiling That’s why I’m always wishing hard for you  ’cause your life shines so bright I don’t feel no solitude You are my first star at night I’d be lost in space without you  And I’ll never lose my faith in you How will I ever get to heaven, if I do  Feels just so fine When we touch the sky me and you This is my idea of heaven Why can’t it always be so good  But it’s alright, I know you’re out there Doing what you’ve gotta do You are my soul satellite I’d be lost in space without you  And I’ll never lose my faith in you How will I ever get to heaven, if I do  And I’ll never lose my faith in you How will I ever get to heaven, if I do  And I’ll never lose my faith in you And I’ll never lose my faith in you

      So i wanted to join in this craze of blogging ... like many things i take up i wonder if i will stay interested. I guess for the moment this serves the purpose for me to put down my day to day thoughts... and have a way of looking back at what i have been up to.  Today - Sunday the 4th of July ... I've had a fairly lazy day. Woke up around 9'ish and lay in bed for a while figuring out what i needed to do so that i dont have a hetic week. Probably organise my room and get clothes ready for work. Im sick of running around like a crazy woman every morning trying to figure out what to wear and never being ready early enough to make the bus on time. Since forever I've always wanted to be the type of person who has their clothes washed, ironed and folded so that it would be easy of a morning to figure out what looks better or more so fits! its never been the case. put it down to wearing a school uniform for most of my life up until 5 years ago or pure laziness. the rational side of me picks the latter. So i lay in bed and realised i had better get that part of my life organised and also wash my hair and clean the rest of my room - its 3:45pm now and im still in my pj's... ive eaten 3 lcm's, on my second cup of coffee and really should have a shower and go out. i have however been in bed for some of the day reading  ... 'drinking coffee elsewhere' by zz packer. such a entertaining and heart warming book - wish i could write like that ... i have so many stories. to be honest i felt like i could be a character in her book. someone who isnt quite in the crowd and not quite out. someone with enough tragedy in her life to want to make things better or at least have reason to make things better. it would have been great to have books like that when i was 16 and 17 ... maybe cut the time wasting paths ive taken thus far. but i guess its not all doom and gloom. im about 4 subjects away from graduating - thank the lord. it will be good to finally be a graduate and have that part of my life over. yet i am not quite sure if im ready to work full time after my experience with pwc. we shall see... for now i am enjoying life as a student... as a part-time worker... someone who has enough time to sit and ponder... read and write. im not a fan of the rat race and the 9-5. i did it for 18 months in the most corporate of environments and it burnt a hole in my heart and tore a part of soul ... never again i have promised myself. the worth is not for its gain - for me anyway. when i worked at pwc i would often begin observing people... often management and wonder what drove them to want to be in that role... to have that lifestyle. was it their only way of having "fulfillment" in their life? was it their only way of having achieved something. a part of me despised the life they had, the people there were and the agenda they served and the other part admired them. most of the time they stopped being human for me and more like robots. they could make a decision, say something, behave in a way which showed no compassion - perhaps they saved the compassion for special occasions.  now im working part-time at a uni... i see people who still have had the same drive the same success and have achieved a level of success to have a good lifestyle - but there is a level of humanity there. people are still able to have the traits in order to remain human and less like robots.   the characters in zz packers books have every element of humanity... good and bad...  so i think i might continue searching the internet... figure out the workings of the blogger website and probably shower sooner or later.

       urlLink   I was watching ABC's  urlLink Critical Mass  this arvo and  urlLink John Safran  was on as one of the critics. This weeks episode was really good as they reviewd Woody Allen's film Hollywood Endings even though the other two critics totally dissed the film and Allen I still enjoyed the program. They were critising Allen's humour, something about it being not so current and his play on Hollywood also outdated. I think they were expecting some sort of change in his direction and methods in 2004. But that is the thing about Allen which I think escapes people when they watch his films, and that is  you know what you are going to get everytime. A stuttering man who loves self referals in his films, someone who draws realistic parallel to his own life, and at the same time the viewer is not sure if it is an accurate representation. For me, there is something about Allen which strikes a cord. Be it is his odd charm, his neurotic behaviour or his love for the city as a place where stories are acted out and lives intertwined - I love it. He has a way of taking the mundane, the annoying, the obliterating and turn it into a humourous satirical journey.  I have to get Hollywood Endings out on dvd one of these days. Speaking of which I have yet to watch my freebie dvds (Punch Drunk Love & Age of Innocence). I should do this tonight as I will need to post them back tomorrow to get a new set of dvd's for the week. So John Safran was on also. I am a big fan of his also.  He makes me giggle. I just love his ideas, his humour and presence on tv. I checked out his site and was reminded of all the loco stuff he has done over the years. If Australia has an iconic pop culture guru he certainly is it.  I have done heaps today. Finished a Photography Assignment. Did more research for my trip. Cleaned my room, however my laundry still seems to be everywhere. At least I can now see my floor. It is amazing how big my room is once I tidy it up. I should keep it more tidy. I also wrote up my list of To Do's and stuck them on my mirrors (built-in wardrobe ceiling to floor double mirrior). I have three catergories; Uni Assignments, Life Stuff (Tax, Banking, Bills etc) and North America Trip. I also opened my mail which I had left in a box for the last month and put bills, invoices, letters, into a folder with dividers (Credit Cards, Phone Bills, Uni, Travel, Work and Other). I also downloaded the E-Tax program to lodge my 04 tax return.  I want to do this BEFORE the cut off date because I either leave it to the last minute every year, or not bother at all. So that is what I'll do this week for sure! Next I have to get started on some uni readings for this week. Something I have been putting off all week. Maybe I'll make my trek to uni extra early tomorrow and find a lounge to settle in and read till my 10am lecture. Good thinking 99.  How was your Sunday?  LovePeaceRespectHumility

       urlLink    This morning I have started researching for my trip again. It is exciting and nerve wracking at the same time. I have always wanted to visit North America, especially Canada. New York and the East-Coast have also added to the list of places to visit over the last few years.  So the plan as it stands looks like including; New York, Boston, Washington, Connecticut, Toronto, Montreal and Quebec for a trip in November. A few posts ago I had a brief list of places I wanted to go to in New York and things I wanted to do. All the quintessential ‘New Yorker’ things to get up to whichc we see in films and read in books whilst growing up Down Under. Of course being a student will limit the amount of dosh I have to spend, but hey what’s one back packer holiday compared to all the lush ones I’ve had in the past traveling around Australia, Thailand, Singapore & Sri Lanka?  At first this trip was going to be a solo one, but after chatting to my friend D’s sister; J she has decided to go as well. We will be meeting up in NY and taking it from there. The trip has taken on a different twist now that she is coming, but I only see this as a bonus. My only concern is that she has done heaps of traveling thus far on a shoe string and now that she is older (only by a few years though) and well traveled she may have had enough of hostels and counting the pennies. I guess we will have to reach a compromise.  This will also be my first trip without The Boy. A part of me is really looking forward to it and another part of me knows how much I will miss him. And being the sook that I am I am not looking forward to our temporary good bye at the airport. However taking a completely selfish tangent I will be the one out there having heaps of fun so I just need to keep that in mind. Plus I have his blessings so it makes it all easier.  All in all its looking good. We just need to book internal travel (Flights and trains), accommodation and a little structure on what we are going to do every day – leaving tons of flexibility. J and I will also be in NYC for Thanksgiving, so very much looking forward to Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade.  Any tips from the blog readers in North America?

       urlLink   I realised today that I have posted on my blog numerous times this week. This is perfect evidence of my addictive personality. And all I can really do is laugh. I always do things obsessively. Not in a strange way... but in the way that a certain action, interest will suddenly take precendence over whatever part of my life it fits into. For example I go through food addictions where I will eat the same thing for weeks. At the moment its this yoghurt by Ski called Caramel Cheesecake. Sounds strange huh? But its delicious. I had 3 tubs of it yesterday. I mentioned my rapper stage and my NKOTB stage a few blogs ago ... that meant I bought every single music magazine which had a poster of these people and had them up in my room; ceiling to floor. Since I was 16 I have had the dream of going to Canada. This has meant I havepurchased all these second hand travel guides, printed off fare prices, researched the country, the indigenous culture etc. My other addictions, which I like to refer to as interests or passions are:  1.Books (new & second hand) 2.Photos 3.Stationary 4.Food (changes from phase to phase) 5.Teas (Packaged) 6.Trinkets 7.Bangles 8.Earings 9.CD's 10.Percusion instruments 11.Travel Guides 12.Shoes* 13.Fancy Stockings 14.Bags* 15.Manchester 16.Picture Frames 17.Internet 18.Blogging 19. Movies 20. Postcards  Is there a group for people like me?  *I couldn't call myself female otherwise  LovePeaceRespectHumility

       urlLink   Lauryn Hill has been keeping me company this Saturday morning. Been pottering around and had 'Miseducation of Lauryn Hill' in the player. Lauryn Hill is one talented artist. Her lyrics bring me down to earth and plant my feet firmly so that I can stand stronger. Just as I believe writers are angels, musicians share the same title. Her voice and her charm through lyrics is mesmerising. Every now and then I put down my reading notes and just listened to her music.  The Boy gave me the cd for out first christmas in '98. Wow so many years ago, with so much happening since. I love it when music takes you back to a time and place and you are able to smell, touch and feel exactly what was going on in that moment. I remember listening to the cd and knowing that he had been listening to what I had been saying about how I loved her voice and her music. He had been listening to the tunes I had been humming just days before. I remember thinking he checked my CD collection to make sure I didn't have the cd before buying it for me. We had been officially together for 10 days. And finally I remember feeling really lucky. Six years on my feeling of luck still suprises and amazes me. The Boy is something so special.

       urlLink    So the Olympics does something to me. With all the grand hoo ha aside it has the influence to inspire me - especially when we have stars like Cathy Freeman. Even though she is not running this time, her performances will never be forgotten by me. Sydney 2000 was memorable for me because it confirmed my sense of hope in Australia and the world. The world ofcourse is a different place now...  I was surfing the net for pictures of inspiration and the image I have chosen is perfect for my inspiration today. I had another one and that was when Cathy appeared with the Olympic flame at the Opening Ceremony in 2000. I was secretly praying and vocally saying that I desperately wanted her to be the one to light the flame. And I remember just sobbing when I saw her there in her silver track suit with the flame. Me being me I look into the symbolism of acts, images and words more so than the average person (so I have been told), and the choice to have Cathy light the flame instilled in me a sense of hope that on the world stage we are proud of her, her sport, her gender, and her indigenous heritage. From that moment I have worked hard in my professional and personal life to carry this message on.  This is why the Olympic Games inspires me. I was never really good at sport, except for a brief stint in the school swimming squad pre-puberty and netball ages 10 - 14... so because it is a time every 4 years that the world is meant to pull way from all that is wrong in the world and celebrate humanity it is an event which I believe is important and relevant. I hope this will also be the time when we take the time to remember those who cannot celebrate humanity because they are in detention camps (in my own backyard and yours), those who are experiencing famine and civil war, and those who have forgotten what it means to share the world equally.

       urlLink   My Friday… has been shall we say... Challenging! It probably doesn’t rate as my worst Friday ever… but midway through I was about ready to just zone out and not return. After what took close to 2 hours to get to work, when usually its about an 30-40 minute transit I was about ready to make a u-turn and come back. The day progressed well, with many a dumb arse student surprises. I thought well if I cant fight them I might as well join them. Along with practical advice about what to do with manuals, timetables, lectures etc I also gave some handy life lessons. Like being pro-active, taking advantage of the myriad of information and services available to them. Often this was done in my sarcastic tone, such as; “Wow did you know you could have saved me and yourself half an hour if you became acquainted with our website. Here it is. Give it a try next time *Smile*”. I also had run ins with our supplier for toner for photocopiers. Argh. I wont go into details, but I was given the scenic tour around the mulberry bush, and I even had time to plant my own, watch it grow and go around that a couple of times too. After which I realised it was Friday the 13th and left it to the gods somewhere to deal with.  So here I am 30 minutes before the bell goes (well not really!) and I am looking forward to this weekend. It’s a Me weekend again. Getting myself sorted, organised and on top of things (fingers crossed). There won’t be any late drunken nights I assure you. Just lots of spring cleaning, uni work, dvd’s &amp; tennis. Hey maybe I’ll be a chef and try out my Cinnamon Roll Bun. The Younger One (my sister) comes back on Sunday from the snow after celebrating her birthday there… so I plan to fill her room with white balloons and a bottle of champers.  Till then I have a Friday night to look forward to. Maybe a film with The Boy and some good food. Or just Rumble it. Whatever that means. He.

       urlLink   I have been playing with the my blog template for two reasons. To make the blog reflect more about me and whats going on and also to self learn html etc. I am taking a course this semester called Communicating the Social, which has a heavy website design element. I have to design both an individual and group website. Hopefully this blog will help me think of ways to convey messages, meaning and be accurate in my representation. ( urlLink See rationalisation of activity )  ANYWAY. I have added My Mood of the Day, which isn't that reflective of the complexity of people and all emotions and circumstances we face - but I love anything quirky. I have added a Flavour of the Week. This week I've had Pesto Pasta which is a dish I made and love. I am going to try the Cinnamon Roll recipe one of these days if I can get my head into gear. If a Flavour of the Week appeals to you, let me know if you try it and how it goes. Ive also added a few links to some websites I use frequently. The 'I Wish' link isn't meant to just about me. Its basically a place I keep on the web for when I am cruising Amazon for books and dvds I must have but my new budget aware side of does not allow to purchase right there and then. There is also a link for the growing amount of blogs I am finding interesting, entertaining and just plain ole good. If you see your blog on here and prefer not to have it linked, please let me know and I will remove it. I am sure there is some blogging etiquette out there I have yet to find. Hopefully this will counter me just linking automatically.  LovePeaceRespectHumility

       urlLink   Some wine or a long soak in the bath. Perhaps I could have both? What a day! Its hectic at work at the moment because semester has started up, and students can be hopeless with getting themselves organised. Even though I am a student myself outside of work I have never encountered such complacency myself in terms of finding out your class timetable and what is required of you. Some students are afraid to knock on a closed door, to see whether the lecturer they need to speak to is there or not. How else are they gonna know if a lecturer is in their office if they don't know? Instead they trek down to my office and bug me because my door is always open. "Do you know if Prof X is in their office, their door is closed" Student Dumbarse asks "Did you knock?" I ask. " Eeeerr no it was closed!" they reply. "Uh huh right - get out of my sight and figure it out on your own you little mofo pip squeek And hike your jeans up I can see your crack!". Well thats what I wish I could tell them. But I dont. I smile. I offer some advice. "Try email or leave them a note. Here's some paper. Oh you dont have a pen on you. That makes sense being a student and NOT HAVING A FREAKIN PEN TO WRITE DOWN YOUR NOTES". Ahem. Well you get my drift. It just that this happens all the bloody time. Not once. Not even just twice. It would be on average a occurance of say 15 - 20 times a day. All within degrees of each other. They probably aren't completely to blame. If the services and proceedures are up to scratch things should function seemlessly right? It can just be very difficult when you are caught in the maze. I shouldn't be grouchy.  On another note, I got another two free dvds in the mail today. Clap! Clap!  urlLink Fetchmemovies  sent me Punch Drunk Love and the Age of Innocence. The Boy also got his paws on a dvd called Ring 0. It is meant to follow the story pre Ring 1 &amp; 2. Not quite sure what we will watch tonight. I don't think I am up to anything from the horror genre though.  I should go have a bath and get myself relaxed before he comes over. We will have to figure out what to eat for dinner too. I am starving today. Argh!  Update: The Boy is also tierd after a shocking day at work, and is staying in tonight. Probably a good idea too. I might make vegetarian pasta for one.

       urlLink   I watched the dvd/film Beneath Clouds last Friday and wanted to write up a quick review.. so here goes. Hopefully it will help me nut out some ideas for my tutorial presentation and essay for Representing Aboriginal People History &amp; Place.  The film title is perfect reflection on the setting of the film. You see both characters meet, converse, argue, question and come to understand one another beneath the clouds of Australia. Essentially it is a coming of age film starting in a rural town and ends in the big smoke. Both main protagonists are young indigenous people searching for a sense of identity, hope, acceptance and self-worth. Whilst the acting is not Oscar winning, both characters of Lana and Vaughn reflect what it must be like to be young and indigenous growing up in Australia. Lana is Indigenous with Irish heritage, and you get the feeling she is not quite part of the crowd partly because she chooses not to be, and I can only suspect that she is viewed as a 'white girl' because of her fair features. I loved her character from the first moment I saw her because she seemed focused and tough and all the while afraid of what lay ahead. You meet Vaughn whilst he is juvenille detention. Vaughn was striking also, because of his reflection and teflon coated exterior. What was so compelling about this film was the emotions and relationship development the characters go through. The strength they posses and their determination to get to their destination - Sydney.  Another part of the film which really hit home for me was the relations young indigenous people have with police and authority figures. I felt my heart tighten every time a police officer pulled them over. These scenes were just a mere reflection of what must really go on. The other part was when Lana and the Indigenous elder both look at the rock, and the elder asks Lana "Where are your people from?". This is the first time you see Lana acknowledged as an Indigenous person. I was a little disappointed in her response however. I'd like to find out more as to why it was scripted that way.  The end of the film left me wanting to know what happens to them. Does Lana find her father? Does she begin to like Vaughn? Is Vaughn found by the police? Is he reuninted with his family? I highly recommend this film for anyone who is Australian, interesting in Indigenous or youth related issues.

      Today I attended a Priority Setting &amp; Time Management course for work. I have really good time management at work. I get all my tasks done under required time and often I am left wondering what to do next and picking up Ad-Hoc stuff. So I am not quite sure if my supervisor really wanted me to go on the course or if she was giving me something to do. Nevertheless I thought it might be a good opportunity to learn the theory behind it as well as how I could apply it to other parts of my life ... say.... uni! When it comes to uni I am my own worst enemy. I leave things for the last minute and stress out. It not that I don't understand or don't enjoy what I study - quite the opposite. I just don't know where to start half the time when I need to write a 5000 word essay. I hoping I will redeem myself for my last semester at this joint. I must have some quality time this weekend - or I shall bust. The course however was really good. We spoke about how you can establish goals (major goals, sub goals and tasks to achieve all - I used examples of saving $$$ for my trip), we also learnt how to plan well and effective time management. Identify time wasters - Place a value on tasks. My problem is that I can rationalise ANYTHING. A normal person would say, spending x amount of time blogging is a waste of time. Not me! I say it helps me clear my mind mentally. Helps me humourise or rant about something that happened to me during the day. It allows me to be creative and write - something I want to learn to be good at one day. Are there people out there like me. Put your hand up please so I can see you.  I am currently blogging from uni (see what I mean!), and soon I will be heading off to see The Boy. Really excited as we haven't caught up since my drunken debaurchery on Saturday night. I hope he forgives me for being such a pain in the proverbial. I know he will be because he is The Boy - and The Boy rocks!  Mental Note: Must buy large butcher paper/ large post it notes and put up Priorities for visual impact for self and family members who come into my room and think I am just a lazy arse student.

       urlLink    Ok, this is going to be a pet peeve rant. Even though I hate the overuse of the term pet peeve I have noticed that when I see a pair of thongs I quietly do a "HUH?" Why Huh? I am a thong/flip flop/slipper wearing person too. I wear them with jeans, skirts, pants, shorts, trackies ... but in the WARMER months like  Summer and Spring . Not freakin  WINTER . Over the last couple of days whilst going to and from work, uni, social event I have seen a myriad of people wearing thongs. Its been cold, blistery days in Sydney. Sure the sun is out, but it   FEREEEEZING   by Aussie standards, It seems that does not stop the girls and boys of Old Sydney Town from wearing thongs with their winter gear of jackets, scarves, gloves and scraves. I saw a girl all rugged up yesterday sitting outside, and I was thinking "mmmm I should wear my beanie tomorrow". Then I looked down and her toes were wiggling about cause she was so cold. Why? Cause she had her freakin Havaina's on in winter. I just dun get it!  Ok, so cold aside. How about when it is the only foot apparell people seem to own. Did anyone notice how Ryan (Big Brother Season 4) only wore his freakin MLS t and thongs to each comeback interviews and the final eviction night. Surely his Mother must have been tsk tsking. Surely there is a time and place or am I getting too old?  Its an impractical fashion statement - and its beyond me. If my feet are cold my whole body is cold. Put some socks on godnam it! I for one look forward to winter... where I can put on the boots - the black ankle ones, the chocolate brown mid calf suede ones, the black flat heeled ones and sneakers. I'll keep thongs for Summer and trips to Sri Lanka.  I'm on the look out for socks with thongs next. Should be a hoot.  Courtesy:  urlLink Havainas   urlLink

      I had a brief read of this  urlLink article   featured in the SMH. I don't feel it is my place to judge the woman who killed her boyfriend, or her actions. From what it sounds it wasn't a violent crime. But the gravity of it would be immense - having control of someones life and their death. It brings more questions surrounding mental illness, rehabiliation anf who the victims of crime really are?  This isn't part of my 'positive week' agenda, but if anyone is actually reading my blog I'd be interested in what people think.  LovePeaceRespectHumility

      I woke up this morning and felt great. I wish for a positive day, and a fabulous week.  This week three special people have birthdays.    (9th) Happy Birthday D   - 25 years and I wish for you true happiness    (10th) Happy Birthday Nana   - I love you and wish I could spend more time with you. You always welcome me with open arms.    (11th) Happy Birthday my Sister   - I love you with all my heart. You are my yang. You are my trust, my hope and my joy. 22 years of Joy. I wish you happiness in abundance   This morning I crave for a steaming cup of coffee and chunky toast with lashings of jam and butter.  I've posted my assignment for uni. And off I go for a day of learning. :)  LovePeaceRespectHumility

      What a hectic 24 hours this Baby has had. Last night The Boy and I went to my cousin and his wife's 30th birthday. We were super late, but quickly got into the swing of things, by grabbing a few drops of white wine (me) and bourbon &amp; coke (him). The crowd was a mix of friends and family - the younger generations of cousins. It was cool to catch up and chit chat. The bash was at a cute little bar, called the  urlLink Tank Stream Bar . They had hired it out, so we had the whole place to ourselves. Afterwards we rocked on at the  urlLink Establishment , where I then switched the wine for some bubbly. This is where the damage was done.  . Some people I had not seen since the big family holiday in Sri Lanka in December, and some new people that friends of friends or cousins friends of friends had brought along. I consumed way too much alcohol in the given time and dearly paid for it when I arrived home and all day today.  Of course by not being very responsible or planning ahead I had to wake up today to go to a brunch for D's birthday. Even though I brought the idea of a bday brunch up with M - I began to silently dread the whole event when I heard it wasn't going to be an intimate get together of 4 - 5 people who's company I actually enjoy, but the whole brood of girls with whom I went to high school with. The dread is due to the complex issues of people moving on and others remaining in the same place, state of mind since highschool - the only difference now is is that they think they are sophisticated enough to be where they are. *rroooow with claws*. I know I know, this is bitchy and I should get over it. I am over it - but I am usually right with the vibes I feel. The whole process today was painful - it was all about who was married, who is fucking who, who isn't fucking at all, who is pregnant, who is unemployed etc etc. I think the thing which REALLY grates me is that the whole group dynamic changes because of 2 certain people. Minus these two the events is usually enjoyable and lovely. The others are so cool - and are girls who I adore. ARGH! I was so glad to leave the bathroom to deal with my hangover.   The whole experience left me wondering if I was ever like that. The Gossip SophistiKat Wannabe I am a Princess Look At Me Wiggle My Arse Female. The answer very simply is No. S pointed this out the drive home. If she or I were ever like that we would still be like 'them' and not us. I think I also left baffled at the level of adult conversation. If the conversation was not on village gossip, it was about who had the biggest enegagement ring, or who was buying which house (this usually ties in wih suburb snobbery). We had one conversation which closely resembled an adult conversation - someone brought up the Da Vinci Code and the issues surrounding it - such as does the book make you question Christianity, is it a good thing or a bad thing? A few us understood that to truly understand faith and religion it needs to be looked at separately. Faith is something personal. Religion is something constructed by those in power at given time. History is part of religion and often history is written by men and more so by the winners/conquerors/powerful and or wealthy. What ensued was a confused and poorly thought out "argument" by 'them'. All they knew was that "Whatever we were taught in religion studies was right. The church is the house of God. We should not question religion ever" etc. The point was that it is ok to question the historical accuracy of what we read, hear and see. It should never get to the point of what you find to be spiritual. Christianity has confused the two meanings to say you can't have one without the other. Anyway, I shouldn't criticise being the good Catholic that I am (insert sarcasm here), and I consider myself to be a good person. I cannot however understnad, its not like they are simple minded hobos. These girls have had every opportunity given to them, but they make the choice to play   urlLink  plastic    and not ever develop their own brain, opinions, thoughts, ideas, concepts - nusink! Their primary concern is getting married, and to a rich guy, shopping, having children and eeerr that's it. It was tragic to watch. I should transcribe it for a scene in any future books I write. I knew it was time to leave and go throw up again.  *Enough of bitch rant*   I had great memories of last night. Of me being affectionate with those I love and who's company I cherish. I met some new people who I would love to party with in the future. One wanted to take me home. Mind you he was batting for the other side, so I am not quite sure for what purpose he had in mind. But it was fun. The Boy said my cousin had come up to him to make sure he knew that my new found friend was gay, and that I'm only a drunk flirt. He.  Lessons of the day: There is nothing quite like cleaning up the vomit from your room floor when you are hung over (TRAGIC I KNOW - I was in a bad place at 4:30am!) and strawberries coming back out of your mouth BECAUSE you are hung over do not have the offensive vomit smell.   They   smell   like   strawbs  .    LovePeaceRespectHumility

      My mother walked into my room to let me know that she can't continue this way. She wants to talk to me. We started arguing again - but not bad fighting.  Mum: "You can't live like this. Look at you... you aren't eating" **Saffron: "Mum I know. Im just working on an essay. Ill eat afterwards" Mum: "Not eating is not a diet you know" Saffron: HMMMMM!!!!!*inner grrrrr cause Saffron knows where this is heading* Mum: "And look at this room. Just because you are focusing on your uni work doesnt mean..." Saffron: "Mum!!! Stop it!" Mum: "I am just saying ..." * She always says that*  I think this mood has something to do with one of the stories/film in NY Stories I watched last night. Woody Allens Oedipus Wrecks. Allens character Sheldon has issues with his Mother. The issues seem to vanish once she mysteriously vanishes mid magic trick. She appears in the sky some weeks later, and the issues are back. Except now the whole of New York City knows about them - cause she is telling them. Things fall into place eventually.  So she then says she cant stand the silence. That it is hard for her to live like this. I agree with her. That was the first thing we have agreed on in ages. She then wanted to help me clean my room. She picked up my trash and I got up and did the same. I am glad she started talking to me. Even if it started with "Saffron come eat something".   ** Saffron is my blog alias  LovePeaceRespectHumility

      Today is just what I needed... a day just for me. After the sleep in and slight grumpiness at missing out on seeing the kids this morning due to my own stupidity ... I realise now that I needed today. To stay indoors, even though it is gorgeously sunny outside and just listen to some good music (Sweetback is still in the player), do some reading and writing for uni.  Disclaimer: The below post ended up being dreary. It wasn't meant to be.  I was able to chat to my dearest friend who lives in Portugal. S moved to Portugal after highschool and is now completing a degree in Architecture. She is coming to Australia with her beau for Christmas so it will be nice to meet her and her man. We both return to Sydney a few days from each other in December - should be nice. The only thing is that S can be too intoxicating. Over our chat I was reminded of a argument we had when we were 14. S has always been demanding - for everything. Friendship, attention, listening, dancing, and gifts. It isn't an evil thing - just in equal amounts she is generous and caring. And I totally love her. But even today I was reminded of this fact when she tapped away in our chat " I should take the time to remind you to bring me a gift from the States." She was probably 1/2 joking, no a 1/4 joking, but the insinuation was still there and reminded me of the time she badgered me about a birthday present weeks and weeks before the actual event. I always felt compelled at the age of 13 - 18 to buy her expensive presents - I don't know why. Looking back she would have remained my friend either way. It baffles me to be honest. So this one time I actually started saving - which was hard as I didn't have an after school job, and I came from a single parent house hold with a parent who was paying for private education for two kids, paying a mortgage and still trying to provide the absolute best for her kids. But still I tried to save and with her birthday looming her badgering started to pick up, until a few days later I totally blew up. We were in class, Commerce Studies. She was asking me questions about what I had bought her. I still hadn't purchased anything. There was a silver ring I thought she'd like, but the store didn't have lay-by and I hadn't saved enough. So after a million questions and me avoiding the questions - I blew up and told her off. I think I even threatended to hit her - thats how mad I was. I was asked to leave the room ("That kind of behaviour is not tolerated in this school"). Damage was done. We didn't speak and I never had to buy the present for her because of that. I think it set the tone for how I deal with stress. I blow up and then allow the matter to deteriorate... which brings me the other issue on my mind today ...  My mother. I may have mentioned a few blogs back that there has been a silent conversation going on between my mother and I. Kind of difficult some might think seeing as we live in the same house. But with our schedules we hardly see each other ... except for today. We have both been home. She downstairs. Me upstairs in my room. This made me along with other 'signs' think about what has been going on between us. My attitude towards her has been one of avoidance from May. It an accumulative thing. Years of arguing, tension, tears, pain - we both share for a multitude of reasons, but tend to target each other as the cause of it. After last years self rebirth I came to the realisation that I probably shouldn't keep my mother as my target of said suffering. And for a while that worked. I focused on the task at hand(uni, work, health, exercise, friends, relationship), and when our communication became too much to bear for me (her criticism, nagging and guilt-ridden comments) I would retreat. But the same old same old has resurfaced. Blame my Scorpion sensibility of never letting things die, as I like to refer to determination and ALWAYS being the one in the right in May of this year I did not want to retreat casually as I had done so in the last year - I wanted to fight! Tell my mother why I am in pain. What she did and didn't do to help me. And try to drum into her that I am now an adult, capable of so much more than what she sees. She probably still sees a baby, or young thing. I am not quite sure how to change this. I worked full-time for two years before I went back fulltime to uni and started part-time work, and she was still the same. Angry and Critical. The emotional side of me goes for "Why am I the victim in this" take. The logical side of me says its a clash of egos and an argument on two different playing field.  Today, I go with the latter - but on my down days I can help but feel like the victim. The daughter who was always there to listen to her mother's woes, to help with looking after a younger sister, being well behaved, doing well at school, getting into a good uni, working in respectable good companies and organisations, having good friends and a long stable relationship with a guy who respects my family and especially my mother, being responsible, diligent, respecting my elders - ALL THOSE THINGS! But when the claws are out I am attacked on a personal level for not being good enough. And then I blow up. And fall back down at being the victim.  So the question remains... What do I do? An Aunt gave me some advice late 2003 when my mother had another episode. She asked me if I had faith. She knows that I no longer go to church every Sunday, and that I question Christianity. I answered that I do have faith. I have faith that with great belief in humanity that we can have peace and love. She asked me to pray for myself for strength to love my mother as she is and not to ask for anymore. She said with that strength I will be able to show my mother what I am capable of. The faith was for me only - for my own strength. I ask my Dad who I know is my Guardian Angel to give me that strength ever day.  My Aunt also asked me to have faith in one hand and reality in the other. She said I had two options. One was to go my own way and not deal with my Mother and our problems. The other is to use my strength and face reality that because of so many issues, my mother sees me as her point of attack. After losing her husband, my father - and feeling let down by him she has had to carry on with life and raise two children on her own. I am used as her 'punching bag' sometimes. So the choice was walking away and limiting contact with her, or staying there with inner strength, having a relatively normal relationship and every so often deal with the crap. Back then I went for the inner strength advice. Today I am not so sure. I have come to realisation that I want the following:  to talk to my mother openly about everything - past, present, future not to be criticised share her struggles and listen to her stories be loved by my mother  Right now I need to work on that on my own. For now the silence is the easiest sound to hear.  LovePeaceRespectHumility

      I woke up too late to make it to my volunteer work this morning. I stayed up watching dvds (New York Stories, Beneath Clouds, Jungle Fever, Outkast music dvd, &amp; Chalte Chalte) till 4am. This is my fault. I have done this countless times, but this morning I woke up giddy and was tripping over everything. Then I realised it was 9:30am. It would take me half and hour to get dressed and another 40 minutes to get there. With the headache - it would have been self-harm. I should continue to waste my day online. Get no uni work done, not clean my room or do my laundry. I am my own worst enemy. LovePeaceRespectHumility

      So I got two films I've been wanting to see  urlLink Beneath the Clouds  and  urlLink New York Stories . Looking forward to some watchin the screen tonight - laundry will have to wait! And this could count as uni work because I am taking this subject called Representing Aboriginal People History & Place, and in the first class we all chose on lectures we have to present on and then write an essay. I chose the week where we view Beneath the Clouds - so yeah Ima gonna bee studyin' toooooo - nite! he. I think the   Budget Goddess   must be smiling down upon me because my bus ride home was free - didnt have to punch in my Metro Ten.  Question: Does Blogger have a word limit for posts. Cause I couldn't add the above paragraph in my  urlLink last post . I write too much perhaps... just as I speak too much in reality.

      Oh what joy - Today is Friday. Which means I wont have much of a weekend - as this one is going to be busy. No rest for the wicked I suppose. However tonight is probably going to be the low point of the weekend - laundry and Week 1 Assignments are on the menu. I might get a bottle of wine to dull the pain. Saturday is volunteering and 30th bday bash for cousin and his wife and Sunday is bday breakfast bash for D. Hopefully I'll be able to sneak some sleep, and uni work in between. Heres hoping!  Last night The Boy and I went to see Man on Fire. Verdict: Save your money! Whilst Denzel certainly puts bums on seats ( I have yet to understand why, other than for his aesthetically pleasing appearance) the film was just bleh for me. I did have a few little giggles at some of the scenes between the two main characters; Peta and Creasey, but I often found myself rolling my eyes and looking to The Boy giving him the 2.5 stars rating look he and I both understand ( Neck slightly cocked to the neck, one eye in winking position, slight shake of the head) The first half was probably the best, where you see Creasey go from drunk/guilty/bearded/non-religious/ non- smiling/ non-laughing/ tough talking ex assassin to shaved/friendly/smiling/swimcoach/mentor/cuddly bear/ St Jude praying child body guard. The grabs of Mexico city was great as is the main families house. I love the religious iconography, colours, glitz and honesty of the decor and house. The Boy suggested a rename of the film to Creasey Bear - hehehe  Last night was not a total sham ... I bought some lovely mid-calf zip up boots. The best thing about them was that were reduced from $180 to $120. After trying them on and finding that they fit well, felt super comfy I decided to pay for them and the sales lady said I was able to get another 50% off. Bring it on! So I ended up paying on $60! How good is that? They are flat heeled and are puuurrfect for winter and I can take them with on my trip in November. Yay!  It feels like my budgeting is coming together too - with the boot purchase, the guide purchase (Let's Go USA &amp; Canada reduced from $40 - $7.95, new  urlLink iSIM  card ($1 for SIM card and $20 credit for free, cheap ass calling rates, 15c sms) and my free trial with  urlLink fetch me movies  - I feel like I can still be entertained, be sociable, prepared and dressed well for less than what I was spending before. Cheers for me. He. Plus major savings possible this fortnight if I keep eating out/drinking out etc to a bare minimum. Time for lots of uni work me thinks!   Update:  How good is this ... I joined this 30 day free trial with  urlLink Fetch Me Movies . They act like a web based BlockBuster. You select from their MASSIVE collection of dvd's, rate them as High, Medium, Low - depending on how badly you want to see the film and they mail them to you. So you watch them, and return then asap so that they can send you more dvds. And all the postage is paid for. With a 30 day free trial - you cannot call that a bargain. I am impressed because I only joined on Wednesday night (LATE!) and today is Friday. LovePeaceRespectHumility

      I'm in a music rut. From being a neo soul afficiando ... then exploring house ... getting back into old school hip  hop and some newer less commerical stuff ... I feel like I need something new. I tried last night to listen to some old cd's - so put Sweetback on the player. It was soothing and brought my focus to do some light reading for uni. I might have to go see what new in neo soul. I hope I get to see a Maxwell show whilst in NYC in nov/dec - that would be a dream!  Watched Royal Tenennbaums last night till about 1am - what a great flick. I so get Margot - without falling in love with my half brother of course (if i had one) - but her secrecy element to life. I have learnt over the last 6 months that I am such a secretive person - not in a bad way though. Just little things, habits and ways where I value my own space and thoughts. Strange that I blog about it though. He  LoveRespectPeaceHumility

      So I'm still here since my first blog and I've been doing the blogging circuit by visiting other blogs ... reading them, providing feedback and getting some feedback either through my blog or email. Its been an interesting experience and one I will continue. Even The Boy has started up a new blog. I won't link his blog yet as I am not sure if he wants to be linked - I'll ask. It will be his second attempt at blogging - I look forward to reading his blogs because I consider him to be a very creative and intelligent person... and one of the most honourable human beings I have EVER had the pleasure of knowing. Wow! But so true.  One thing I have noticed whilst on the blogging circuit is the communities which have been formed through this communication process. And the whole process is one which can be seen in 'off-line' reality. And that is, the coming together of people of the same background, demographic, subculture, beliefs - call the force what you will. A few blogs which have caught my eye are a few New York based bloggers, A girl in Adelaide A girl from New York teaching English in Korea. A girl in Melbourne who is pursuing a career as a writer and many more. In this process I see that people either span out and read, see, understand different things and form a community or they reach out to those who they have in common and continue a vibe which they may have in 'real life'. Could it be  Bloxing?  Blogging in our box of comfort?  Another interesting element is how blogging is becoming a new study of communication. I am taking a subject this semester called Communicating the Social. After Mondays lecture and this afternoons read of the subject outline I have come to learn that we will have a whole lecture and tutorial devoted to Blogging. Interesting I hear myself say. Interesting because Blogging is being studied in an academic context and therefore viewed as a process of communication and exploring all those interconnected social elements of communication. I look forward to that lecture, and the subject as a whole.   After Spell Check:  Has anyone noticed how the spell check does not recognise the terms blog, blogging, blogger? Instead you get the alternatives; bloc, flogging, blockers - respectively. Blogger Team - shouldn't we update the Spell Check dictionary?  LovePeaceRespectHumility

      This W.G.P person who says  "The cheapest exericse for men and women is mind over platter"  definitely needs to be my friend. If only I read this quote before I had the chips, the snickers bar and slice of fruit flan. I've been on an eating rampage - i think primarily due to a tad bit of anxiety I'm feeling. Comfort eating is not. a. good. thing.   NB: W.G.P appears in my Collins Desk Calendar I have at work   LovePeaceRespectHumility

      I was shitty last night. I typed up a review of a film I saw on Sunday; The Boy Who Played on the Buddhas of Bamiyan. It was all typed up and I had published it. Blogger even said it was 100% published, but when I checked the update - no text, just a heading. I was an Angry Blogger last night. Now I can't be bothered typing up another review (the other one was detailed) as I need to attend to more pressing tasks like uni! Which started on Monday.  I already feel a little stressed out about the months ahead... I guess in anticipation of my last semester as an undergrad and also for my trip in November. I don't want this semester to be hectic like the last where mid-way through I totally freaked out and couldn't write a single word for any of my essays. Last semester taught me that if I am not organised and on track within the first - second week I am then lost for the rest of the semester.  I have set a few goals which will be challenging ...   To do well at uni, with a distinction average, Save $4000, get fit and organised in the process.   I guess its doable if I set my mind to it. Baby steps as they say.  Since I found the film inspiring and touching of the human spirit here is a link to a review by  urlLink Filmink   LovePeaceRespectHumility
