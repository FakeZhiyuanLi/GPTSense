          I am SOOOOOO mad! Somehow I just managed to screw up my entire blog and lose an hours worth of writing all because I was trying to change the template. Now it will not post anything I write even though it tells me "your blog has been published successfully" in a cheerful tone. Errgh! Leave it to me to entirely waste my time. I feel like alice in wonderland...nothing is familiar, I'm just trying to do one little thing, and everything is getting in my way!!! well, this is a test. let's see if this has posted.

      OKay, here are some crappy poems that I only half like. But I still think they're pretty good. People often say that they don't understand my poetry. It's called IMAGERY and IMAGINATION people! I am just trying to get across a feeling, even if it is sort of abstract. On the other hand, most of my poetry is confessional, which I am not proud of. I want to get away from that and write about larger themes but it seems that no matter what I write it all ends up being autobiographical and I think I'm just going to have to live with that for a while. I promise to put up some more poetry and prose and short stories soon, as soon as I dig them out from under my bed or wherever it is that they are hiding.    No Martyr   In spite of all this victimless martyrdom I remain the only one slain.  It has hurt me well enough but I never understood  before  how I let you spin me of my own cloth.  I was the warp to your woof; you were always running through me while I stood, alone, your ugly tapestry.  With my jute fists I let you weave me a ragged soul and never defended its enduring pain.  I bit the fibers and held them in my mouth and forever more will I chew to make them soft.   My gift to you.   My gift to you.   Yet you will consider me burlap as though it is undeserving of great love and glory.     Baby's Daddy   I will be finding the good in you for the rest of my life extracting it out like thick black oil. Your demands and your demands took place the of all of my young-sweet plans. How you posessed me  and I pretended to be pitiful-- I will spend the rest of my life explaining-- How I tried to be somebody else How I found its far too expensive to disown yourself How I spent one too many afternoons holding onto a yellow broom while staring at a doorknob.  Demands beget demands and now I cannot clean my hands so I will forever be finding the good in you looking as hard as I can.

      Forget Jamaica. Well, don't forget it, but put it aside for a while. Now I am in New York. How did I get there? I read the neighborhood section of the New York Times and suddenly I am on a sidewalk. There are tall brick houses on both sides of the street with stone steps crawling to every doorway. Wrought iron fences, waist-high, line flowered yards. Shops intermingle with homes. It is four o'clock on Friday. Black lamp-posts stand stout every twenty yards, like friends, and though they are not yet lit it is comforting to know that soon they will be. The trees are old and tall but look young, still missing most of their leaves. The first green growth on the branches is twittering in the wind. Vendors' tables decorate the street. A purple tablecloth grabs my eye. A handsome young poet is playing a guitar on the steps of a brownstone. His beard looks soft and delicious. He is, of course, taking collections. Children are playing hopscotch right in the middle of the street. The adults keep only one eye on them This is not the neighborhood I live in, but I have to walk through it to get to my less afluent apartment in Brooklyn. (I guess--it's hard to imagine NYC when you've never been there--but I assume that from Brooklyn, one can walk anywhere...hell, I don't know). I stop to look at a colorful knitted hat. The air is still cold and frosty but there is the taste of warmth that is just beginning. The air smells polluted if you breath too deeply but its not so bad once you get used to it. No matter how long I've been here I keep thinking to myself "I am in New York City" with a sense of awe. No matter how stalled my life might seem, I know that I am in NYC and therefore, by association, I am doing something great. I can see skyscrapers over the roofs of these houses. Just around the corner, I can hear horns honking and people shouting and shoes clickety clacking and bells ringing and dishes banging and lights flashing and love making. Just around the corner, the earth is moving. I look at my reflection in front of a bakery. I am still the same girl. But I feel different. I look at the people walking past--everyone has somewhere to go and it seems like where they are going is the only place there is. The barrio girls, the fancy women, the school children, people of all colors and cultures, the butchers and the bakers and the candlestick makers--all the people here--have one thing in common--they cannot aford the luxury of being afraid. Each place you turn there is something new to bump into, something to propel you into your inner resources, something to make you stand up for yourself. "What do you want?" is the question New York asks. "You shall have it," is its reply. Into the great wide open...the eternal abyss of what you desire...all questions can be answered here.   I am here to answer my own question. What am I made of? What am I made for? I am hoping to run into my destiny. Maybe it will run into me as I am walking on the crosswalk among hordes of people, come swirling down from heaven into my head. I am riding in the current of desire and dreams. I know I will be served. I am going to be able to say "I survived." My postcards home read "I am homesick only for the rolling green pastures but it really is not too bad...it is a short drive to the countryside (3 hours). My neighbor sometimes lets us borrow her car. We love the adirondacks. I am nervous about Issac starting school--some neighborhood kids walk to school on their own but I will be taking him myself... We adopted a dog from the animal shelter to keep us company. The furniture is sparse but Issac's art decorates the walls. Throw dinner parties for my new cool friends. Still haven't found a publisher. Have been writing a lot.  Start teaching soon. We've been to all the Yankees games so far but three. Issac implores you to write more often. Please come to visit soon. Love--Melissa"

      January 20, 2004, Tuesday  Imagination can be a dangerous thing. It takes us away from where we are and deposits us in an entirely new and different world, one that doesn't really exist. While imagination can help us to discover new things, for me, it seems to be only a temporary distraction from reality that is like a mind-fuck. It is my drug. I need it. If I don't daydream for a couple of hours each day I don't feel right. I get edgy. Grumpy. My daydreaming, while at times productive, consists mostly of imagining my life somewhere else doing some other thing, avoiding the real work that is in front of me. Lately I've been loving me and Issac living on the shores of Jamaica in a raised wooden shack, making sandcastles all day and I am gloriously tan with colorful silk cloths tied around around my waist blowing in the wind. The diet of melons and beans has done my figure wonders. I don't mind being poor. Our days are given over to nothing but swimming and walking along the beach, climbing mountainsides, and talking to the island people who are all as poor as we are. We stay away from the resorts. Issac develops the cutest Jamaican accent and at night we jam out with our neighbors because my prize possession is my guitar. Issac dances and shakes a marraca and runs around with the black girls. We go to the church full of crazy bright religion and we do our best to pray. I post gaudy pictures of mother maria on our wooden walls. I import clay and sculpt. I home-school Issac and several other Jamaican children. The people are thankful and send me food and chickens and goats. I am never lonely. I draw and I paint and I write. Creative energy oozes out of my body. I write letters to everyone in the states who ever doubted that it could happen, and tell them "our biggest fear is a hurricane. I dread tending the garden but we depend upon it so for our survival. I am becoming one with the earth. My fingers are brown from the clay."  God- why do I have to go to math class? Why am I too much of a wussy to actually DO this little dream of mine? It feels like I am too poor to even go live on a poor island with poor people. Isn't this silly? Utterly.

      January 14, 2004, Wednesday  I am blogging for the first time. School has been going for less than a week now and I am already absolutely exhuasted. I have early morning classes and I am realizing that was NOT a good idea. Next week I think I will try waking up at 6 am so that we can actually have time to eat breakfast and get dressed properly before we get in the car to drop Issac off at the babysitter and drive me to my bus. Yeah! I just love how the first impression I've made on my professors and fellow classmates this semester has been one of tangled hair and pillow marks on my cheeks, unlaundered clothes encrusted with baby food, stress zits, tardiness, unorganized folders flowing over with errant papers, and pleadings to please let me borrow a pen or pencil. I totally feel like I'm losing it, whatever "it" was that I once had.  Last semester went like a dream: I made two A's and a B, the work never seemed too overwhelming, and I was having fun. I think a lot of this is due to the fact that I lived with my Mom and Henry and they cooked dinner for me every night and cleaned the house, Issac was younger and did not so easily make such a mess, and it was the first time I was really back into the swing of things after separating completely from Mike. I was thrilled just to be one among a throng of people, happy just to be able to talk to people my own age. Also, I was entertaining the idea of dating again and every cute guy I saw was a potential date. Now, every cute guy I see is a reminder that I don't have time to date. This is vaguely depressing.  How do you date when you are a single mom? Thankfully I have some time to myself because Mike is with Issac every other weekend, but this is time that I have to use wisely. I use Issac as a screen to test potential dates.    Cute guy no. one: "So what did you do over the weekend?"  me :  "I was so busy. I hung out with my son Issac and had a blast. You know, he did the cutest thing the other day..."  Cute guy no. one: "Oh, you have a kid?" (Shocked look on his face, looks like he might be sick) me: "Yes he's one year old and we are best friends..."  Sometimes they ask if I like being a mom and I prattle on about how awesome and exciting it is, but I never forget to include how much hard work it is.   Cute guy no. two: "So, do you want to go get some drinks?" Me: "Sorry, I'd  love to but I can't. I have to leave right after this and go pick up my son from the babysitter's." Cute guy no. two: "You have a kid?" (looks shocked, jaw is hanging open. Looks very afraid.) Me: "Yes, he's one year old and he is soooo cool. Do you know what he did this morning. Ha ha it was so funny...." Cute guy no two is looking around for someone to rescue him. He is no longer interested. He wants out.   Cute guy no. three: " So what do you do?" Me: "Well, a lot. Let's see, I'm an English student minoring in Education, I'm going to be a teacher...I'm in school a lot, and also I'm a mom. So that's mostly what I do." Cute guy no. three: "Wow, you're a mom?" (Incredulous, seems kind of intrigued) Me: "Yep. You know, he did the cutest thing last night...." Cute guy no. three: "Can I ask you something personal? Was it an accident?" Me: "I hate it when people ask that question. What the hell do you think? My son was not an accident." (I frown somewhat angrily. I wonder why people are such assholes. What are people THINKING when they ask that question? I know exactly what they are thinking. They are storing up the evidence to talk themselves into actually using condoms and other forms of birth control more regularly. They are making a mental note: "see, it DOES HAPPEN. Yikes.") Cute guy no. three: "Sorry." (Looks somewhat sober.)   Occassionaly cute guy will say something like "right on!" or "cool!" when I quickly reveal my mommyhood status, and doesn't even separate the distance between us as we're talking, but even then dating still seems like such an impossibility. I just don't have the time. And even if I did, I'm not sure I'm ready to get back on that wagon, because I'm not sure what kind of a ride it's going to take me on. My history is one filled with dangerous curves and rocky cliffs, high speeds and hold-ups, wild horses with bits in their mouths. I'm ready to walk on my own for a bit.  So here I am-- finding myself stuck between wanting to spend time with others and enjoying any moment of solitude I can find, in the beginning of a busy spring semester at the University of Florida, and with the coolest little kid in the world.

      It's a nice feeling when you've been staring at a screen for three hours.  I just checked my email and in it was a letter from Fusion Literary Magazine offering a $100 prize for best short fiction. The due date is in 2 weeks. I have been feeling like a complete idiot for several reasons:  1) I want to be a writer and I don't have time to write. 2) This is a stupid reason to complain 3) I complain anyways. 4) My writing is unpracticed, undisciplined, uncreative. 5) I really  can't  force myself to do my homework. 6) The only thing that will make me feel better is if I run away to a tropical island all by myself with lots of food and art supplies.   I have been reduced to a sniveling 23 year old crybaby living in the lap of luxury with food in my belly and a roof over my head and money in my pocket and all the "possibilities" of the world at my doorstep. But here I am facing the disgusting diseases of a first-world country--melancholy, ennui, dissatisfaction, distaste, dreams.  I always thought the writer leads a romantic life. She retires into the mountains in a Sandburgesque house with a goat farm and a writing desk at a sunny window. Writing is given the respect it deserves--days to muse over an idea, hours in the morning, hours after lunch. Whenever the fancy strikes, she is free to rush to her desk and record the genius. She has time to empty her mind and wander through the woods gaining inspiration from spiders and ants and eagles. The writer is not disrespected by other responsibilities. Her sole frustration is lack of inspiration, upon which she packs up her bags and moves to Paris, Prague, Peru.   Writing is easy for the writer.  She doesn't ever write crap. Everything is publishable.  --------------  Okay, so I know THAT is not how it happens. But I don't even know where to begin anymore.    I don't have the energy to create.    I think this weekend I will be getting to know the beach again.  When is the last time I went on a walk? Probably just before this semester started. There was a scene that inspired me--little dewdrops hanging on a fence. I wanted to write a poem. I still remember what it looked like:    On a Fence   these little ornaments bells are crystal-dew they can shake and music make f  a    l     l   ing  to  the ground                       ou a regrettable s    nd like glass breaking

        Viva la revolucion!              The following is my weak attempt at philosophy and tends to ramble at times. May be found boring. Sorry.               "She has her own little stories running around in her head and forgets about reality," I said to my Dad, talking about a woman I know who has been getting on my nerves.             "Sounds like a Liberal." Dad laughed heartily at his own creativity with a joke. We weren't talking politics before, but now we were.              "Oh yeah? Well then a Conservative is someone who blindly believes whatever "reality" the authorities tell them to believe, without questioning anyone or anything." I am a liberal, and I have to defend myself.  It's a valid point my Dad has. Sometimes I wonder about myself--stuck in my own little realities, forcing the world to commit to my one little vision of peace and love for all of the earth. Of countries doing the right thing, of talking about morality and justice and then actually walking the walk. Of my country being a shining beacon of peace and love and liberty, of unity and strength and compassion and honesty, of hardwork and industry and intelligence--an example of how the similarities of human beings always outweigh the differences. Remember, the six most important words of our country's foundation were     United we Stand, Divided we Fall    .  But look at what we've been reduced to: Gays should/should not be married. Abortion should/should not be legal. Liberals are the most intelligent/most duped. Republicans will save our country/ruin our country.   It's hard being a liberal. As such, we are always facing criticism of "that's unrealistic."  Because a larger faction of liberals than Conservatives are atheist or agnostic or don't believe in hell, we face the opposition of the Bible-spouting religious and every person they frighten into adherence. Even when we make good, solid points. Even when it is realistic. Even when we are religious too.  I am a Christian. I cannot deny the story of my own making--it is absolutely beautiful. There is power in my Christian beliefs, and even though I have been attacked for being a heretic, for being a liberal, a Unitarian-Universalist, and for believing in a "loose" interpretation of the Bible I still believe that I am "holier than thou." I believe that humans miss a good deal of the religious point, and just because some men wrote it down in a book does not make it the "WORD" of God-- the way things are most certainly, without doubt.  It makes it a reflection of a society struggling to explain its existence and become more civilized.  The first gigantic religious revolution within the christian era was when the protestants separated from the catholics because they didn't want some stupid pope or confessor telling them what to believe and claiming the right to talk to God for them, ultimately telling them what to do.   Most right-wing religious are now protestants.  We may be on the cusp of the second religious revolution--when religious factions decide that we don't want some stupid book written 2000 years ago telling us what to do or telling us what God thinks. God is in each of us. We can talk to God ourselves. In each of us is a conscience that is God's voice. Judgement will come from the decisions we make. Maybe the Bible will be revised to reflect   this   society as it struggles to become more civilized.    Maybe I should write a liberal Bible. I'm sure I'd get asassinated. Heresy is a mighty powerful word.   Dad says the ultimate problem he has with same-sex marriages is that it is just "morally" wrong. I asked why why it is morally wrong--his answer pointed to the Bible. I asked him about who wrote the Bible and if he believed that the Bible is free from human interference, to which he replied he "has to believe in the Bible because we need  something  to believe in."     My Dad's ultimate problem with same-sex marriages is that it leads to people believing they can have whatever they want, going against old tradition, lacking restraint, fulfilling themselves with whatever wherever, lacking discipline, becoming too decadent. In short, the decay of the fabric that he believes has held civilization together for so long--the power of people being told what to do and listening to what they are told.  I say, how does making a few wrong things right change the entire moral fabric? If anything, it makes us MORE moral and just. And it does not follow that the whole entire structure of civilization as we know it will fall apart because a few things are changed.   People will always do as other people do. People will always follow the rules. It's okay to make new rules.    It happens.      If new rules hadn't been made, blacks would still be slaves. Millions of people in our country would be starving and living in slums. Women would have no rights. Trial would be held without jury.   Of course, I'm not really one to speak about this. I have trouble with morality issues all the time. Should I have sex with this person? Is it a sin? Do I judge others too much? Am I too lazy? Sometimes I think I DO need someone to tell me what to do. God is really pissing me off lately. Why does God have to make it so difficult for humans to know what we are really like? So much good, so much evil. Or maybe we're just giant ornamental eating-breeding tubes.      And just in case I am wrong and for absolution and for all the brainwashing I have faced over the years that may not have been brainwashing at all:   Please God don't smite me down for what I have wrote.

       Only in dreams...   I had a dream last night that I was getting married and I was actually excited and happy about it. The person I was getting married to in my dream was someone I know, and I will not divulge his name at this time. We were in a gigantic Catholic church (I'm not even Catholic) and I was in a huge rose colored dress and I just remember feeling so happy and serene and beautiful. And when he took my hands and looked into my eyes my heart started singing because I knew that he was the man I would love forever. When he kissed me I had an orgasm.  How am I supposed to  not  be interested in this friend of mine now? How can you fight a feeling like that? Man, if life could only be so simple.

        Feminists hate men...Right?    WRONG. Feminists do not hate men. To be a feminist means to believe in the intelligence, dignity, capability,  power, and worth of women. Nothing less, nothing more. I am mystified by the numbers of men and women I meet who think that feminism is a dirty word, a dirty thing. "Don't call me a feminist--I don't want men to hate me." It's true. Proudly proclaim yourself a feminist in a room full of people and watch men shirk away from you or roll their eyes or try to talk you out of it and watch women shift their hands and feet uncomfortably. They are thinking "What is wrong with that girl? She can vote, own property, run for president. Why is she complaining?" I am complaining. I am complaining and challenging. I am challenging people to believe in themselves. I am challenging people to believe in their sisters and their daughters and their mothers and their husbands and their sons and their brothers and the idea that each can honor the other in a beautiful way. When I call myself a Feminist, I am challenging you to believe that our similarities outweigh our differences. When I call myself a Feminist, I am challenging you to believe that a woman actually CAN be president because female presidents are (gasp) smart and capable like male presidents. When I call myself a Feminist, I am challenging you to  agree  that women are beautiful and serious and smart and capable, just as much as men. "Duh," people say. "We know that already...we see it everyday. Women are great. I love women. So what are you complaining about?"  If you love women so much, why are you comfortable living in a world that constantly enforces the idea their is a "proper" role for a woman when there is no "proper" role for a man? If you love women, how can you be okay with the fact that this country has yet to elect a female president? That at the present rate, it will take 955 years for the congress to hold and equal amount of women as men?  That the ERA did not pass?  That women constantly risk rape and death by those who feel that women are crossing the boundaries? That too often women are not taken seriously? That men laugh at rape victims? That everyday hundreds of women are raped? That nine million women were burned at the stake? That women are sexually harassed?  That almost every derisive word in the English language refers to a female? That women are afraid to call themselves feminists? That women are afraid to proclaim their worth and their right to hold positions of power and respect and authority and importance? That the rebuke for women is ten times as harsh as the rebuke for men?  Some women (I used to be one of them) don't believe me when I say that we live in a sexist world. "I'm treated alright," they say. Well, have more qualifications to be president than the twenty males and then run for president and see how you are treated. People will actually question your "femininity" as a potential weakness. It has happened to every female who has ran for president. "Women put up a serious campaign for president if they wanted to."  Are you sure? Are you sure that women would even stand a chance? Why can't you name five women who have run for president? YOu can't name them because nobody takes them seriously. Because they disappear before they've even begun. Because sexism is too strong. Because people don't think that women are "qualified."   To be a Feminist means to believe that femininity is a strength, not a weakness.   Men should be able to agree with this. If you don't, you are a sexist pig. Come on, men in my life, let me hear you chant, "I am a feminist! I am a feminist!" Would you believe that even the men in my life, who love me very much, want to talk me out of being a feminist? I can't figure out why they think it is such a bad thing to be. If I am a masculinist why can't they be a feminist? It's not too difficult.  The chinese ideogram for "woman" is similar to "slave."  It is a picture of a woman on her knees in a submissive position. I honor the nurturing abilities that women have, and being a mother myself I see the accuracy in this description. I am proud to serve those who I love, to be a "big mother" and meet the needs of those around me, to give with love, to sometimes put myself last. But to put men at one level, and women at another, is wrong. It creates disharmony. It is inaccurate. Language reflects belief. Men serve their families, their countries, their obligations just as women do-- so why isn't the ideogram for man "slave" as well? Because this world has a long history of wanting to place women in a position where everyone believes that women deserve abuse.  The ultimate question is why don't we live in a world where the ideogram for woman is "hero?"

        Three reasons to celebrate...   First, I got my cat Lucky back from Mike's house. Lucky is the adorable amazingly long orange tabby cat that Mike rescued from the Dames Point Bridge in Jacksonville four years ago. He was just a little kitten then, small, wet, and covered in oil when Mike brought him to me in a cardboard box. "You need a friend," Mike said. I nursed him back to health. He grew. We became friends. When I broke up with Mike, he pleaded with me to let him keep the cat. "No! No! You can't take Lucky! He is my best friend! I need him! I won't let you!"  I think he even cried. But he's   my   cat, I thought. I entertained ideas of a drive-by cat-napping. I knew, though, that Mike would probably just return the favor. I was pregnant. I was only mildly pissed off--I had more important things to think about than Cat War I. Besides, I was hoping that Lucky would help Mike to chill out. But now I have Lucky back. Mike is moving  and cannot bring the cat. Lucky is home again. It's been fun waching Issac's maniacal grin as he chases the cat up and down the hallway. It's been lovely having a warm purring cat sitting in my lap. (We won't discuss the problems of cat hair on this joyful occassion.)  Second, I got a valentine's letter in the mail yesterday from my cousin Catherine. It had a picture of her family. She has lived in Arizona, Texas, and Minnesota, so I have only met her a few times. She is 31, a lawyer,  and mother to two boys. When I was little I thought she was sooooo cool and grown up and beautiful. She is still very beautiful, and we have the same nose.   Third, I met with a pro-teach english education advisor yesterday, and discovered that the pro-teach graduate program at UF only admits entry every fall. Since I will not graduate until the end of fall 2004, this means that I will be forced to take 8 months off and wait until the fall of 2005 to begin work on my master's degree. This conveniently solves my "should I go straight to work and start earning some real money after getting my BA or should I continue straight into grad school?" question rather nicely, incorporating the best of both worlds. I will take a nice 8 month break. Now my question has transformed into "should I work nights as a waitress and miss putting Issac to bed or should I substitute-teach during the days but be able to maintain his bedtime schedule?"    I'm thinking I will waitress at nights...

       The muses aren't calling and I am desperately falling into the abyssmal dark...    Okay, what do you write about when your life is filled with so many banal everyday necessities that you, a person who has never had any problem with spelling, look at words on paper which was once your entire love affair with life and all you can do is think "I am becoming dyslexic." ???  Words used to simply flow to me when I called upon them. I was a priestess with sourceful abilities. My fingertips were magic mediums. My soul was a magnet for commanding language.   Now I am an empty vessel, with no stories to tell except how I fell asleep last night on the couch, with my jacket and clothes still on, freezing cold because the heater is recently broken, with a small throw wrapped tightly around my feet, and my head wresting on the pages of a great green lump of a shakespeare anthology. How I told myself I would close my eyes just for a second, and woke up at 3:30 am to Issac's cries from the bedroom and stumbled in to change his diaper and pajamas which had pee on them, and then fell asleep next to him but only after I had turned on the bathroom faucet to prevent the pipes from freezing because I had no idea how cold it might be outside. And how the faucet made weird noises all night that kept me in a restless state of sleep, dream-worrying about grammar and shakespeare and past participles and gerunds and indirect objects and heating bills and gigantic god-ordered floods designed to destroy those who are not pure.  Lucky, my old cat-friend, curled up next to my feet and purred in rythm with my distressed sleep. I'm glad to have him back.  Laundry  no hot water in this house we'll take what we can get rub away the rust and try to make it fit wash it without soap at least now it feels clean "turn the pants wrongside out so you can see the seams" in the Shady Woods it took all day for clothes to dry when I was five years old and  the line was six feet high today I have a dryer makes a lot of noise it keeps me warm in the winter, though--  God bless me and my boys.

      French Fries  Long and oily so promising tiny crystals of pleasure only disappear Golden skins contain dull white meat After, an ill feeling of defeat  resides only the red-stained cardboard  presides like a monument.   I love french fries.   Here is an excerpt from my digital journal about two weeks before I discovered that I was pregnant. Issac was probably conceived around this time period of my life. Scary. Read on:   "Friday night turned out ok.. it could have been better. We heard Elena driving by Mike’s parents’ house and went out to meet her, she couldn’t find it at first because we rode our bikes over instead of driving, so she didn’t see my car like I told her she would. At any rate, we drove over to Leo’s and made a pizza (which made my hands stink like onions) and drank a couple of pitchers of beer. It was cool to see everyone again, and chat for a while, but I was annoyed because Erin was preaching the whole time to Elena about how to be a strong woman, which is fine, but Erin is not really a strong woman, she’s just a bitch, because their really is a difference. If anyone disagrees with Erin, she deems them inferior and stupid and unworthy of existence. She is SO controlling of Chris, and I can tell that he is going to start to resent her if he hasn’t already. It seems like if I were a guy, I would not be able to take Erin seriously at all, because I don’t even take her seriously now. Everything is her way or the highway, she even says that. So, instead of letting us all chill together like I wanted to, like we WERE doing, she grabs Elena up and announces “Elena and I are going to go talk about girl stuff in L-7. Nobody else is allowed.” And I said, “you mean I’m not allowed to come talk in L-7?” And she said, “Well, you’re allowed, silly. But just only if you want to man-bash. Cause that’s what we’re doing.” And I was like, “no thanks” and every once in a while I’d go check on them and see if they were talking about anything interesting, but Elena was just telling the same old boring stories about what Kazra did to her, he did this, and that, and took back his microwave and asked her on a date with another girl, and Erin is half listening and smoking a cigarette getting off on saying what a loser he is. The funny thing was that they were on two totally different wavelengths. Elena doesn’t think Kazra is a loser, she thinks that he is great but just treats her bad because there is some innate quality about her that screams “Men! Treat me badly!” Because there IS. And Erin thinks that Elena thinks that he is a loser and doesn’t talk to him anymore, but really, Elena does talk to him still all the time, holding on to him like an injured fly. But Elena doesn’t mention this to Erin, and they both sit their and bash Kazra--they don’t bash Elena’s mock injured-fly imitation-- and then Elena gets brainwashed with all these crazy ideas in her head that Kazra is the biggest idiot loser jerk in the whole world (when she really doesn’t think that) and calls him up at three in the morning later that night and cusses him out for being an asshole and completely confuses the poor guy who probably is an asshole but just because he is so confused from the mixed messages that she sends out. So anyways, it’s a hopeless situation. I was just pissed that I was excluded from their conversation unless I was man-bashing, and that Mike was not “allowed” to come sit at their table, and that Erin managed to split up a completely comfortable everybody chill and happy atmosphere by insisting on seperation.  Well, the real trouble began when I learned that a Reggae band was playing at Eddie C’s. Everyone was going, and I really wanted to go too. Mike “had to work in the morning,” and didn’t feel like going. (Mike doesn’t have to even go to work until 3 in the afternoon). He told me that I could go by myself when I insisted that we go and reminded him of what time he really had to work, but I felt like he was just saying that and that he would really be pissed if I actually went and fight with me when I got home. So I think he got mad at me for insisting so much (he felt like I wasn’t listening to him) so he got up and left. And I ran after him begging him to quit being rash, and to try to get along with me and then I got frustrated and told him I was going by myself and now he wasn’t allowed to come because he was being such a jackass."    Man, what a life I led.  Here is some more of my thoughts about my life during this time:   "I really like this font. I wish I wasn’t at work. Right now, if I could, I would be somewhere outside strumming on a guitar, trying to get good at it. I was a little depressed today, but I’d rather not talk about it. It does not go with my new philosophy, which is Be happy, not un-happy. It works. So, if I could I would be dreaming away the day. It was weird, yesterday I came home from work and played the guitar for a while (the first time I took it out of its case for a long time) and then Mike came home and we went to bed. And I was thinking, where did that day go? Don’t let the days gooooo byyyyyyyy. That day just totally blew by and I didn’t touch anybody or do anything super and that’s what I want: to do super things and then you have to ask, what is a super thing? What does it feel like and taste like and do you know it is a super thing when you are doing it or does it just kind of sneak up on you? Or can you add up a bunch of little things and have them become a super thing and how do some people do so much and what is fame and why do I need it? Do I need to validate myself as a person by being this famous person who does good deeds? What drives people to want to do good deeds? is it God? Or is it themselves who need to feel important and whats wrong with feeling important? And why do I want to play the guitar so damn bad and be good at it and why do I want to be a jazz singer and why do I want to climb mountains and run triathalons and win at things? When was the last time I won something? Where did my competitive nature go and when did I stop caring? Have I stopped caring? When did I turn 21 and what did it mean?"   My be-happy philosophy is a good one. It really does work.  And some more:   "Why must I use big words and why are there ten words that mean the same thing? Why am I getting paid to work in this fucking office when there is no work to be done and I feel like I’m cheating the system and why does that make me feel bad? It’s like an animal that is injured and cannot reproduce. It’s like a cookie that knows it is completely fattening and sugary and excessive and there is really no need for it to be around. That’s how I feel: completely excessive. It really is exhausting being excessive. And why do I feel this way and what is it that I should be doing in order to not feel this way and how do I go about doing that? I want to be lean, unexcessive, efficient, strong and proud and tall and right and right and right and strong and proud and tall and effiecient and unexcessive and lean."   Well, getting pregnant didn't make me feel too lean but being a mom has made me feel essential and efficient and strong and proud and tall and right. And keeping up with Issac might one day make me lean.  I like the way I wrote then. It was perhaps...more lively?    Here is some more. Wow. Almost two years ago exactly:   "(2/22/02) My Aunt Lynn called me today and thanked me for the Valentine that I sent out. She said that everybody loved it and it made them feel very special and then she asked if I wanted to babysit and I told her no. No I do not feel like babysitting all your bratty kids. I am so exhausted after this week of work, and I wonder why I wonder why I even try sometimes. It’s really a stupid thing to wonder: why I even try. I even try because that’s all you can do, but sometimes it feels like I just don’t try hard enough, because if I tried harder, maybe things would work out better and I’d be happier, and things would be more perfect, and what does perfect even mean? Perfect means being smart and having friends and being loved and doing things that you love to do and perfect is things being easy and not being a pessimist like my Dad. My Dad hardly ever complains but you can see it on his face, how unsatisfied he is, and he doesn’t complain until you start trying to confide in him how frustrated you are with your life because things aren’t easy and are difficult and you are lonely and then he really lets you know that the world is a miserable awful place and all you can do is trudge through it knowing that the next day will probably be just as shitty as the last one. It really would drive one to drinking with that sort of attitude… It just makes me want to cry. It’s like, where did my dad go? I don’t even want to get into it except to say this: It could be worse right? Your Dad could be dead. Your Dad could never have been in your life but then I think, would it really be any different? Would I really be searching so much harder for love from my Dad if he weren’t ever in my life? Because I’m already searching now, looking for it, needing it, wanting it and it’s funny because when I really think about it, I don’t even like my Dad. He’s boring, mean, grumpy, and gloomy. And if he had never been in my life, would it be so bad? At least I could dream about how much my Daddy would have loved me if he had been around and how much fun we would have had together if he had been, instead of the opposite, wondering what it was that was missing and awful and boring about me that made him not want to spend time with me. "    In the last two years, my relationship with my Dad has improved dramatically. Then, we were both in shitty places in our lives--he, suffering from an impending divorce, and me with an abusive ass. But now our relationship is much better, probably because he has found a nice beautiful girlfriend , but mostly because I have made a commitment to make sure that my Dad knows me better.

      I've been at school making a crappy website for the last 4 hours. My eyes are blurry and my shoulders hurt. The address of said crappy website is http://plaza.ufl.edu/melferg/webpage1.html if you are curious.   In an effort to try to post something creative on a regular basis, and in an effort to expand my writing abilities, I WILL blog even on days like this. It might be scary, it might be ugly, but it will be here for your reading pleasure. On crappy days like this it will be in the form of a poem, which does not require me to think.  Birdbrain  Oh shit I thought when I saw the green stripe on your car I am so totally screwed I entertained thoughts of a high-speed chase and  there was a good chance I could slip down a dirt lane while you were turning around  never-to-see-you-again but I am a chicken and while I was fidgeting my fingers and pecking at myself you caught me and handed me a nasty yellow slip of paper. Bagock! bak bak bak bagok!   That's right. I got a speeding ticket yesterday morning. $137. 74 in a 55. On the way to the babysitter's. But the good part is that my driver's license is suspended and he didn't notice. So I guess I should be happy.  On the even upper side, I'm having Brian and my Mom and my friend Andrea over for dinner tonight, and dinner is already made, and it is so good: florentine stuffed shells. I love having people over! Come visit me! Please!

      How is everyone doing today?  I am just fine, thank you. I got an A on my math test! Oh yeah! I am incredibly excited about this since this is the same class I failed my freshman year. It reminds me that I have come a long way since then.  Do you ever come across something, a letter say, that you wrote years ago but thankfully never sent, read it once again, and realized that while it was perhaps poetic it was very overdramatic? And then do you wonder if this makes you an overly dramatic person? For example, a letter I found:  Your beacon strikes out in circles of rotation, steadily it will without you even trying with respect you are very noble I love you so much and that's why I don't understand some things  and I have to be okay with that thank you for touching my life and I'm sorry for ruining yours  I cannot wash the heat from my body and it burns my skin everything that I touch gets too hot  last night was the closest the earth was to the sun the closest the moon was to the earth the solstice and the full moon the first time in hundreds of years my mother told me so as I slobbered all over her dress  I had to say this outloud to you for resolution but certainly there is no closure in life resolution is only in death  goodbye  ps- I know the last part sounds suicidal but it's not. Everything I said is as true as I can be. I don't want to leave but I know I must.  Then, after you re-read it and muse about it and post it on your blog, do you wonder if perhaps you are divulging too much of your personal treasure? Do you wonder why you are such an exhibitionist? Do you really want people to know that you ever felt that way about a person? That you were ever so silly? Would the person you wrote it about-- who you still cherish-- appreciate being so exposed in your tangle of exhibition and your cheap sensational charade for attention?  This tidbit certainly captures a moment in my life, and I'm glad I have it with me still, because looking at it again makes me at once happy and sad. I really miss that person to this day...he was a great friend and it is hard to believe I let a certain jealous freak (BABY'S DADDY) force me to choose to lose contact with him. It's hard to believe I let a certain jerk control my life for so long a period of time. NEVER AGAIN will ANYBODY tell me who my friends can and cannot be.   I was such a whimp--and my previous whimpiness has affected my entire future--or at least it will for a while. As of right now, people meet me and think I'm a cool person and then I divulge the history of my past and they start to think twice, because a prerequisite to being a cool person is that you cannot be a pathetic masochistic whimp. I promise, I'm not anymore! I am a self-actualized person who harbors no intrigue with pain or suffereing or being told what to do! I just want to be happy...and now I actually believe I deserve it. I am happy now. Deep down in my core.  I love it. I allow it. And this has made all the difference.  I find myself internally pleading with people not to be afraid of my past. I have journeyed an incredible path and now I am on top of the mountain. Asshole Mike has gifted me-- I have become sure of myself out of my struggle for independence from him. I have become sure of myself in a way that is unshakeable, undoubtable, out of living through abuse and choosing to say "fuck you--I am worth more than this." I know I will never be abused again. And if Mike was able to be such an asshole that he could teach me this in three short years, instead of a long and depressing lifetime, then I am thankful for that gift he brought to my life. Because the truth about me is there was a time when I thought I wanted to be abused. And I'm glad I didn't waste my life discovering that I don't.   If it explains anything, my acupuncturist says that the gate to my heart chakra has a tendency to malfunction. In the past, it wouldn't close when it should. It would stay open far too long, enduring abuse, listening and compassioning with the pleas of the brokenhearted and pathetic. She poked needles in my feet and wrists to mitigate the effects of my defunctional gate. Though at the present moment my heart-gate is functioning well, it continues to run the risk of opening too wide or slamming shut prematurely and never opening again--though I doubt the latter will happen. Mine is the heart that remains too open.  Masochism is inherited in my family--it is the legacy that they have left us despite the many happy memories I am blessed to carry from my childhood. Despite all the goodness in my family's legacy,despite how subtle it is and how difficult to discover-- pain is the dominant emotion, the domineering theme of my family who is careful never to smile too wide or laugh too loud. You will be scorned if you are too happy, if you refuse to carry the ridiculous burden that they have each lugged and hauled on their backs for centuries.  FUCK THAT.  I'm leaving a different legacy for my son, for my family. One where my children will know that God most loves a happy heart. One where my children will not be able to recall a time that their mother was not singing. One where hearing the word "love" doesn't make my children cry but makes them giddy with laughter.       These Teeth  Your teeth are made of only truth and it has been reflected               I have found no other such jaws none like porcelain.  You ride me like a swan if I am Leda, I too am Agamemnon in the most dreadful of battles-                It is not even wartime and still I cannot whistle.  My bones are straight and upright too! Oh, the loss! I feel them grinding!                It is bitter pain, and I can only bite harder.  I have been hungry so long for white feathers                But birds have no real tongues,  they would only swell  And cry "Just One Drop!" So downy and pretty Such dreadful lies, and who could refuse?                  That's why birds are toothless with only gums.

      My morning routine involves finding a parking space at the University of Florida. There ARE no parking spaces at the University of Florida, so I am forced to fret and sweat and drive around frantically in endless loops looking for the best place to illegally park. I am tempted to try a different place each morning so that nobody will catch onto my ruse, but once you've found a good thing it's hard to let go. My latest good thing is the visitors' parking lot at Alachua General Hospital. There are seven separate lots in different locations, which provides just the right kind of variety so that the nurses and doctors and other people who think it is a moral travesty to take up visitor parking don't get suspicious. I must admit that my car is very conspicious-- it is covered with dust from limerock roads, contains a gigantic carseat and a cheap sunshade sporting a patriotic flag on the back window, is filled with toys and clothes and coffee cups and papers strewn will-nill around the floorboards and seats, and has non-tinted windows so that all are priviliged to see its slovenly innards. It is the kind of car that people can't help noticing when it is parked among newer, cleaner models. Though I have crossed paths with hospital employees, I have parked in lot 7 exactly nine times with no problems or visible raised eyebrows.  This morning, however, I became nervous. I varied from my usual routine and ventured into lot 2, which is farther from my destination (UF) but therefore substantially less obvious. Also, its thick trees and roughage provide more cover than the other lots. The first stage--crossing the actual parking lot to get to the sidewalk--is the most risky. It is during this time that people can most easily identify you as an impostor if you fail to continue across the street into the hospital. It wouldn't be so nerve-racking if I didn't carry a backpack.   This morning I was stalked by a security guard. I am certain of it. Shortly after phase 1 of my dangerous mission was completed and I was on the sidewalk walking AWAY from the hospital, a white SUV with blue lettering "Shands Security" slowly began to trail me. Then it did a u-turn and went the other way. After I took a right (which sort of keeps my cover by redirecting me toward a second potential hospital entrance) I saw him again. He pulled into a side entrance and waited. He was distracted by a woman asking a question. I slipped out of sight as quickly as possible by running and jumping over hedges, dodging around corners and making a succession of left turns, right turns, left turns. He never saw me again. Maybe he thinks I actually went to visit my poor old grandma in the hospital, and I'll never see him again.  Maybe it's time to buy a parking decal.

      Yeah! Everything is up now! I KNEW it would work out just fine (sure I did).  I wasn't even worried, not even for a second.   So I've been thinking about dating and men and love again. I have just one question--do you believe in soulmates? Where the hell is my soulmate? The concept of a soulmate creates my entire demise--it breeds nothing but hesitation on my part and turns me into a gigantic commitment-phobe. (Yeah, sure, I'll date you, you're nice and cute and fun...but chances are 6billion to one that you are not my soulmate so I'll be moving on soon...oh wow, I am really getting to like you BUT WHAT IF THERE IS SOMEONE BETTER OUT THERE? AHHHHH! Go away! Leave me alone! I'm waiting for my soulmate!) Unless you come with a sign on your forehead that says "Melissa Ferguson's Soulmate" I don't even want to bother.  Then there is the concept of how superficial I am. I base more of my romantic interest in the way someone looks and how big their muscles are, not who they are or what they believe. This has not gotten me far in my life and I have vowed to change it, but this vow is doing little for me. I can' t help but stare at biceps and shoulders and think yummy thoughts. However, there is hope. I thought a short chubby guy was really sexy the other day--it was something about his eyes and his general look--it was very soulful. He could look deep into my soul. (Okay, maybe he couldn't--he knew absolutely nothing about me-- but it felt that way and that is so very sexy). It helps that he was hispanic. I guess the chemistry between people can never be forced. I just know that it absolutely HAS to be there for me above all else and this makes me feel superficial. I wonder to myself, "Why don't I fall deeply madly in love with the nice guy who rides my bus and who likes to speak Chinese and who plays guitar and who reads Tennyson and loves kids and has a close relationship with his sister?" All the qualifications of the type of person I am looking for but missing that one essential element. Sigh.  Truthfully, I don't believe in soulmates. The idea that out of all the people in the world, I will find my soulmate in Gainesville Florida is highly unlikely. Therefore I must convince myself that there are multitudes of soulmates for every one person on this earth. I have loved many people in many ways. Which way is the right way? I haven't experienced it yet, I suppose. It is unfortunate that I believe that different people can be right for you at different times in your life--I don't think I fall into ranks with people who believe in one lifetime love. I think I am too faint of heart, too weak, too afraid... afraid that no-one could ever love me forever and ever. Maybe I'm afraid that I couldn't love just one person for ever and ever. I'm not entirely sure. Maybe my fear of commitment comes from the fact that I don't want to make the wrong decision (so I won't make any at all). They say nothing ventured, nothing gained. At this moment, I feel sort of desperate, like I am on pause. I hope I'm getting some sort of higher wisdom from this patient waiting experience, because its sometimes boring, often times lonely, and altogether frustrating.   Soulmate Wanted: Must be considerate, supportive, adventurous, wise, friendly, and fun. Must inspire me and make me smile. Must not let me get too bored. Bringing out my creative juices a plus. Making sure I don't lose myself in you is essential. Those without intense chemistry need not apply. Must inspire in me a promise and a will to love you forever.

          Bodies...       Do you ever see girls walking along the street pulling and tugging at their revealing clothes, trying to get the fabric to cover a half an inch more of flesh?  What seems comfortable in the privacy of a dressing-room mirror becomes self-conscious in the public of a busy roadway. It's really not a difficult concept--you shouldn't wear clothes that make you feel uncomfortable.  But they are in style  they will say. Screw style. One problem for me regarding clothes is that my legs are so long it is difficult to find a pair of shorts that suit me-- either I feel like they show way too much thigh or else I look like a golfer. I like to wear shorts too, but there are some times when I think to myself, "This is utterly ridiculous. I don't have the body for this. I don't feel particularly comfortable letting 3/4 of the population stare at the skin right below my fat ass." I can feel them doing it, and it pisses me off.   Men do not have to go through this. I was behind a guy today, walking to class, and his baggy and comfortable pants looked fashionably cool while covering all of  his legs except for half of his hairy calf.  I laughed to myself as I imagined the world where we are all equal--where men struggle in a sea of too-tight, too-short clothing, a world where men are faced with choices that make them feel only fat or fatter.   I also entertain myself with thoughts of how the world would be if we were all nudists. I think that would be a healthy dose of reality. I envision a warm tropical climate, everyone has a healthy tan, are bodies are all glowing and radiant. Okay, wait, I've seen too many bacardi commercials. Still, even with our pale obese bodies flapping around in the wind, I think it would be a great dose of health to  see  that. To know what bodies really look like underneath the clothes. To know that  only .00145 percent of the population have that "perfect" body. To be aware of ourselves in a way that we don't have to be right now. Maybe we'd get over out weird sexual obsessions while we were at it--a breast would no longer be a contraband item, a penis no longer an obscenity. We would be like the tribesmen on PBS specials, who don't stop to stare at boobs or balls. Maybe we'd even become healthier because we'd get sick of looking at our bodies being less than what they were made to be. And most importantly, clothes would stop defining us, and we wouldn't be able to hide from ourselves any longer.   Sometimes my laziness regarding my body scares me. I treat it like I treat my car--get me here, take me there--I don't care how it looks or if it's nice and shiny with a new tan paint job or freshly waxed. Give it good fuel and an ocassional check-up. My body is a good and reliable vehicle--but in regard to classes of vehicles, it's not much else. Perhaps at one point it had the potential to be a top-of-the-line offroad SUV with amazing horsepower and 4-wheel drive, but now it's just an outdated model that is not worth sporting up. It is what it is. I am what I am. I am trying to be okay with that.   I remember when I was unaware of my body. Legs and arms were just there, for playing, for running, for jumping and hanging. It was much easier to do these things before I grew and developed another 70 lbs that seem to have distributed unproportionally. I can barely hang from a bar these days. Monkey bars are truly a challenge. I feal weak. I feel disappointed.  When I was unaware of my body, I did not judge it.  I still try not to, because it will only make me upset no matter how close to perfect I become. See--I just said "how close to perfect I become " instead of "how close to perfect it becomes." If I don't pay attention, my body becomes a reflection of my inner self, when really it is not so much that. I could be in anybody's body. What's disturbing about this thought is that the more I think about it, the more I realize my life  would  be different if I were in a different body.   If I were the most beautiful woman on earth, would I be so wrapped up in maintaining that title that I forget more important things? Would I be utterly lonely among people who only cared about my outer beauty? Would I be a snob who only surrounded myself with similarly beautiful people? Would I be rich? Would I own my own tropical island and yacht? Would my secret desire to be an actress be easily fulfilled because everyone would want me in their films? Would I win an oscar? Would the mundane concerns of the world sit under my feet as I stand on my pedestal of success and security?  If I were the ugliest woman on earth, would I have more compassion?  Would I absolve myself of all vanity and material things, devoting my life to helping others? Would I not own a mirror? Would I commit suicide? Would I be a virgin and choose to marry God instead of a man? Would I find that true love has nothing to do with outward appearances? Would I cry at night because people are so mean to me and treat me like an animal?   I drove past the gym late last night. The lights were on and skinny, tanned, beautiful people were running on treadmills and sweating out their devotion to the rythm of their headphones. For a second, I wanted to be there too, making myself more perfect.   Then I decided that I don't have time for that, and me and my beat-up car made it home where I picked up Issac from the babysitter and tucked him into bed. I inspected and rubbed my body and then I hugged it and thanked it for staying healthy. My body and I have a good relationship--I try to let it know how I feel on a regular basis. I told my body that it was okay that it is not perfect, that it doesn't have to be. My body will be perfect for me and for someone else someday, and that's all that matters. It was perfect when it held Issac and it was perfect when it kicked the winning goal for the 3-A district Soccer championship in 1998. It is perfect when it feels like dancing and stretching and laughing and crying. It will be perfect when it is covered in wrinkles and my skin is paper-thin. My body sighed and said "Thank you for understanding." And I slept well last night.

          Short Fiction... (I warned you)      I am sitting at a restaraunt in Manhattan. My hands are sweaty and nervous, folded neatly in my lap over a linen napkin. I am willing them to stay there so that I will not be biting my nails when my mother arrives. Any minute now a porter will open the glass gold-gilded doors for her and the maitre'd will take her perfectly manicured hand into his own gloved one and he will kiss it, speaking something in french into her ear which will make her laugh, and then she will glide over to the table and her chair will be pulled out for her and a napkin will be spread into her lap and she will sit down and smile at me as though it hasn't been three months since we've last spoken.  She sent me a whopping six letters--two of them obviously transcribed by her secretary because they were typed. "I'm so sorry you're upset with me, darling."  "It really is the best decision for you, dear." Each letter was two paragraphs or less, and not one of them addressed what I wrote to her or how miserable I am or what a jerk Sister Luisa is or the lame curriculum.  My mother does not have time to raise a daughter or write a real letter. She's not possibly human.  When she sits down at the table, after she smiles at me, she will look me up and down and find something bad to say. She will tell me that my hair is too short and that I shouldn't wear bangs. I won't care because I'm going to dye it purple as soon as I get back to Florida.  I am also getting a fake ID and a tattoo. Maybe when the stupid nuns put me on probation she will take me out of   St. Theresa's School for the Wicked  . Maybe it will be fun to hang out with Niki and Theona cleaning the cafeteria after class and winking at the dishwashers, later bumming smokes from them for smoking in the bathrooms at night.  Maybe I'll have sex with all of them and then she'll be sorry she ever sent me away. Maybe tonight I'll tell her that my lonliness has made me a lesbian and me and my room-mate get it on every night--that would really piss her off.  And there she is, being kissed on her hands. She is so beautiful, like Grace Kelley.  She ages so well--her legs still look like a young woman's, but her face has the coldness of a woman in her 50's.  She hasn't many wrinkles at all. My heart is beating faster as she glides over toward me. I don't stand up. "Liz, darling. It's so good to see you dear," she says as she stands behind me and puts her hands on my shoulders and leans down to kiss my cheek, which she then cups with her tastefully jeweled hands and tilts so that she can look into my eyes. "You look more like my daughter every day," she says and I just stare at her without saying a word and then she lets go and slides around the table where a waitress pulls out her chair for her and settles her in.  She sips her wine and even asks the waitress to pour a glass for me, which is done without question. It is gross and bitter but I don't make a face as I chug the whole thing. I stare right into her eyes, which are unflinching, showing no surprise. She is on point tonight.  "You'd look much better without bangs, dear. Who gave you that awful haircut anyways? I hope you didn't tip them well. We can get that fix tomor--"  "I like it," I say.   "Well, then. I guess it suits you," she says. Her therapist must have briefed her on control, letting-go, moving with the flow, in the past few weeks. "It's...chic."  "Yep."  The menus are in french. I'm getting a B+ in french. I don't know what everything is, but I know how to pronounce it.   Chevre  is goat,   lapin   is rabbit,   boeuf   is the safest--beef. I order ...  ----------------------------------------- stay tuned for more. I have to figure out something defiant that she orders and what the whole point of this story is and where its going and why its important. Why did her mom send her to boarding school? Why does she hate it so much? Why does she want to be closer to her mom even when she disdains her? Why does she want to see her mother be vulnerable? These mother-daughter things are so worn out, what can I do that is new and different in this story? That is special? How long is it going to have to be? At what point will I end it? What do I want people to think about after they read it? I have a history of making anti-heroes--people always die in my stories for no real reason and then the living character feels like a dweeb for being so mean and wasteful during the time they shared together. How can I end this story without a death (the easy way out)? How can I give dimension to the characters in five to ten pages?

        Just Another Thursday...      Amazingly enough, the bus driver took her 5 minute break at my stop, which gave me just the opportunity to chase frantically after the bus banging on the door. I was able to catch a ride to school on time.   The whole reason I was late--in addition to just being late in general-- was because I cashed a check at Publix, which is becoming more of a bank to me than the bank that actually gives me my checks and monthly statements. This is sad, I know. I never take out enough money at a time--I seem to think keeping it in a vault in the bank will prevent me from spending it.  That bus driver is cool, though. I like her because she tries to read the newspaper everytime she stops at a red light.  So it's just another Thursday at the University of Florida. I am in lab learning about Photoshop 7.0 and nothing on my computer is working properly. I keep thinking that there are just four more weeks of this semester, which makes me momentarily happy until I realize that this only means I will soon be facing a hellish innundation of end-of-the-semester projects, a short break, and then a whole new schedule of the same old sh*&.  I can't...seem...to get to work. There is so much else I'd rather be doing. Like playing with Issac (I miss him so much--he's growing and changing so fast), laying in the sun or swimming in the springs or even watering my garden. Writing, drawing a picture, going on a walk. Talking to a friend. Curling up on the couch with my cat and listening to Paul Simon. Taking a nap. Will I ever grow up and force myself to do the things that must be done? I operate better in the middle of the night when there is nothing chirping outside calling my attention away. But even then there are cheesey infomercials on tv and books to read and a couch to curl on and sleep to be had.  Sometimes I think that if I'm ever going to get through school I need to be locked up in a white room with nothing but a list of assignments and a pencil. And electric shocks that stop me from doodling, which I would still be doing even if I was getting shocked.  Okay, I'm scaring myself. I don't really need that. I just need a kick in the butt. I feel like an old junker car that is just barely chugging along, not getting a good spark, about to heave and sigh and then just completely give up. Those cars always amaze me--they keep on going and going and going like that forever.   Maybe I just need a good lube. I think I'm going to go crazy. You married friends can't possibly understand the concept of sexual frustration. I know it will soon pass, but it still makes me feel sorry for myself.  Anyways, I have major writer's block (probably due to mild depression from my severe sexual frustration). Expect some short fiction in the near future. My short fiction is always ugly and crude, but it's what I resort to when I can't write anything else.  Chiao.

         The Wisteria Fairy and the Lonley Queen    Wisteria. It is in the air and on the vines, climbing over the trees and defying the dusty limerock roads. It's fragrance is like a bird's song, flittering here and then there, never certain of its own location. This time of year there is more purple than green in the trees. This flower hangs and drips like bunches of grapes and spanish moss. I think the thick dark vines might grow arms and reach out to take me in.     Queen Wisteria   How many arms you have but I've yet to see your fingers maybe they're hidden under the tangle of your limbs which hug the trees in deep embrace and grace their crowns with flowers you looked so lonely in winter time so desperate, so empty hanging there limply by yourself waiting for your lover to return with nothing to fill the interim but now spring is here and your lover has returned with wreaths of green to kiss your branches and stroke your vine tickle the bark with tendrils of new growth you do not begrudge his absence and once again you hold him close the fragrant pinnacle of your season loving only with your tender, purple heart  loving without reason.  I love wisteria. Or is it wysteria? When we were little my cousin Mariah swore she was going to name her daughter Wisteria and I asked if we could call her "Wisty." If you wrote it "Wysty" it would look Welsh. It sounds so mystical. All things Welsh are mystical. Wist, wish, wishteria. Wisteria-- the fanciful purple spellbound fairy that simultaneously grants your wishes and gives you the proper wisdom to use them. One glance upon her delicate beauty and men can never be the same. They write songs about her--she is a secret and a muse and a legend. The fairy that seems to have it all wants only to fall in love with these handsome men but cannot because she is spellbound to the fairy realm--she is not ready to sacrifice her beauty and live in the treacherous realm of mortal men. She is jealous of the women who come to her, the women who have known love, who can know love, who are loved. Her secret desire to wade in matters of the mortal is her torment. She will never tell anyone. She wonders at the people who find her in the forest, begging to be united with a loved one, pleading with her to help them find their passion. She wonders what it feels like. She will never know. She imagines...what would it feel like if she stepped off her plateau? If she shed her fairy robes? If her heart were unprotected? She swims in the lake at night under the fog, wondering.

          Love triangles...       It's all so helpless. Florida has been besieged by another cold spell and I am miserable in the early morning 50 degree weather. I just can't stand it when my nose is cold.   On the up side, I've been getting a lot of compliments on my blog and it's even been inspiring more people to enter the blogosphere. That's good.  On the down side, I am worrying about unrequited love and beginning to realize how tragic it could be. What if this totally smart hillarious handsome thoughtful intriguing beautifully perfect guy I am smitten with is smitten with somebody else? I always thought unrequited love was just a joke--if someone doesn't love you back you get up and find another. Now I understand what Cyrano meant when he said love is like an eternal bell ringing in your head. I just can't seem to get this certain person out of my mind and I envy all of my married friends who know that they can kiss the person who they think is the greatest without worrying if that person will actually want to kiss them back. They don't have to worry about hearing "Thanks, I'm flattered, but I think of you as just a friend."   I hate dating. It's too freaking stressful. Being single is becoming more of a burden than a freedom--the love triangles, rejecting people who you are not interested in, defending yourself from perverts, coming up with creative excuses, planning your nights out so that you can see all the guys you are only mildly interested in without laying a claim to one over another, going out even when you don't really feel like it because you might meet someone special, seeing happy people smooching and being disgusted and then realizing that you miss that, meeting a guy who you really really like and then becoming shy for once in your life, losing confidence in all of your magnificent beautiful qualities and living in constant terror from fear of rejection, constantly weighing the virtues of friendship against the virtues of romance, wondering what would happen if you just grabbed his hand and kissed him like you want to do everytime you are around him.  Being so vulnerable.  Actually caring what someone thinks about you.   Yeah, I truly envy my married friends. They must lie together some nights and pity me while they gloat about how they have it so good:   Alexis:    Poor Melissa. I talked to her today and she's been telling me about her love life. It's so hillarious listening to her exploits and misadventures.  It makes me realize that I am so lucky to have you, baby. (Kiss). You rock my world. (Kiss).    Ryan:   Yeah, Melissa really deserves a great guy. Her dating disasters are definitely entertaining. I remember when I was going through all that crap--I thought I would never meet anyone and then I met you. (Kiss). Now I never have to worry about it again. (Kiss.)       I envy my  married friends. But I can still go out and party all night long without having to explain... and I don't have to shave my legs if I don't feel like it and I can eat whatever I feel like eating whenever I feel like it and I can dance around the house like a goon singing into my karaoke machine at the top of my lungs and nobody but me has to be embarrassed about riding in my messy car and I can spend my money however I want to and I can make plans at the very last minute without consulting anyone and I can take up the whole bed and have as much or as little covers as I like and I always get the good pillows...   Who am I kidding? It doesn't even compare. Being single is starting to suck.

      Hmmm. I am facing a managerial decision.  I have started giving my blog out to people--lots of people--six people this week. Previously, only my closest girlfriends and strangers read my blog. It makes me sort of shy--these tangles of my private innerworkings are becoming public to more of my personal friends and family members. What if I want to give my blog to a guy I like? Will it scare him away? Am I willing to sacrifice writing about him and how beautiful he is until I am his official girlfriend? Am I so vulnerable that I need to?  Attempting to keep things mysterious on my blog is lame.  Last night my teenage cousin Matt came over and I helped him write an application essay for dual-enrollment at the local community college. He was asked to describe his career goals and interests and experiences. It was the first time in a long time that I have helped someone with English--and it was difficult for me not to write it all out for him. I had so much to say about how awesome he is.  I made him do it. It was so much fun--there I was actually  teaching  again.  Helping someone to express themselves. To determine what it is that they want to say, helping someone  to be heard .  We brainstormed ideas about him and what he's done in his life and what he enjoys and   why    and what he imagines himself doing someday and his personal philosophy and then we put it all together.   And he wrote it himself  . I am so proud of him. I am proud of myself too. I can't wait to be a teacher.   This morning my aunt read it and said that it was so good and it almost made her cry and she thanked me for being present in her family's life. (Aunt Lynn, I'm sorry for ever calling your kids brats. I didn't mean it and I am sure I have deserved the label many times myself). I am so glad I know them all. I even gave Matt my blogsite so he can read my writing if he wants to.  Which reminds me of Sonoita: the evil half-sister of a city that I never knew I had--the place in Arizona to which my parents were all packed up and ready to move before the deal fell through when I was an infant--the desert place full of cacti and mobile homes that would have taken me away from all of my wonderful family in Florida that has shaped so much of who I am-- the place that is intriguing and mysterious yet dangerous and mean.  I had a very stong internal reaction when we were in the Ford Escape passing the road leading to Sonoita and my Dad casually mentioned how close they were to raising me there. How they had rented the U-haul and were all packed up when the deal fell through. He didn't see the lump growing in my stomach or how my hands became nervously sweaty as I looked out over the acres and acres of barren red dirt and prickly-pine and then up to the redeeming gorgeous purple mountains. He didn't see the lump that I choked back in my throat as I thought of what it might feel like not knowing Mariah and Kyle and Hannah and Quinn and Matt and Sam and Lynn and Neal and Grandmamma Simmons and Grandma Pat and Grandpa Alto and Grandaddy and Tommy and Lois-- but especially Mariah and Kyle. They are like my siblings.  Would I have visited them every year? Would I be the same person I am today? Would Mariah and I have instantly liked each other at the family reunions and promised to write to each other all the time and would we have traded our most valuable toys? Would we have still been inseparable? Would we have cried to our parents and insisted that we must be allowed to visit each other at least four times a year? Would I have known about all her boyfriends and poetry and would we have been there for each other through all of the miscellaneous frightening adventures of growing up and becoming women? Would Kyle have teased me about wearing polka-dots? Would he have threatened to beat up my boyfriends that he didn't like? Would he have taught me how to ride my bike and make friends and give me good advice? Would he have been there to take refuge in and laugh hillariously with when Mariah and I were fighting?  Would I have felt utterly alone in the desert in the middle of nowhere? Would I have partied in Tucson? Would I have truly been the older sister without Mariah there? Would that have forced me to be stronger and bigger and tougher? Would I have sought refuge in horses like my mom once did and be a champion barrel-racer? Would I dress in western clothes and have big silver belt-buckles? Would I have gotten out of there the first chance I got? Would I have known that only a scholarship could save me and would I have gone to Georgetown or Oxford or Berkely? Would UF be a new and exciting place to be? Would I still be single, not a mom, free to roam and adventure and pack up my bags to any part of the world?

         The Miller Lite Girls and the Middle East     Brian is camping with the boys in the middle of the woods. They are roasting the 20-inch trout they caught in the river earlier in the day. The crickets are chirping and the woods smell allive.  "It can't get any better than this, guys," he says as he pops a top and takes a cool refreshing sip of Miller Light. But he is wrong-- the woosh-woosh-woosh of helicopter blades suddenly come into range.  The boys look up at the black sky as the chopper roars into view and hovers overhead. An entire squad of super-smart busty beautiful bikin-clad women climb down a rope ladder, led by Melissa and Monica. More women are parachuting from the sky. They have brought coolers of beer. And steak. It's party time. All is right with the world.   On the other side of the world Iraqi families are being compensated as much as $5,000 for "civilian damage."  Such damage includes burned-dead wives and dead children, cluster-bomb faces and severed limbs, blinded eyes but open memories of watching your family burn to death and bleed to death and plead with death, having no way to stop the killing. They stand in long lines waiting to talk to someone. No young nervous military captains will be coming to their homes to apologize--they don't have homes after this war. They must come to a white room with florescent lights and listen to the pale captain choke back the lump in his throat and struggle to say "I'm sorry," in poor Iraqi language and then hold out his hand to give them some green paper bills. The military does not keep a list of the civilian wounded because (quote) "it's just not policy." They have no idea how many people they have killed until the Iraqis come to tell them--"look, look what you have done! Look at my grief! My life will never be the same. Don't you see? I've lost all that I have loved."   I hate war.  Dr. New says that war is inevitable--created or avoided only because of the will of man. He say's it's about preserving manhood and honor. I think it's about power and greed. An ego trip. Being the best. Ruling the world. "If we didn't do it, somebody else would, and they'd do a much worse job," seems to be the prevailing argument. I can't say I disagree, but I have to have a little faith that constant war is not inevitable. Everyone seems to think they would be a better world-ruler than all the rest. They all think that they deserve the throne. We are still having the divine fight over kings. The war of the roses hasn't ended--the kingdom has expanded to include the territory of all the earth.   Why? Oh why can't all the world be happy and have nice things? Kiss each other when unfortune strikes and find love inside security?   Why do we seem to be nothing more than over-evolved animals slugging it out with our claws and our jaws, fighting over food?   Witness this army of such mass and charge Led by a delicate and tender prince, Whose spirit with divine ambition puffed Makes mouths at the invisible event, Exposing what is mortal and unsure To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,  Even for an eggshell.    --from  Hamlet     I think I will go party with the Miller girls while I still have the chance.

        My totem animal...    Oh Crane! Is there anything more beautiful than your slender body gliding overhead? Your silver tint of feathers brushed with rose smooth against your body and the fingers of your wings spread against the sunset? You are good luck, a sign of love, made into oragami by billions. Your totem heals the sick and brings faith into the hearts of the desperate. Oh, strong bird with thin fragile legs, you stand in water and you grace the sky! You make the small into largess, the diminuitive into the great!  Crane, you are not afraid to stick out your neck and fly. Beautiful Crane, your heart beats strong in your chest. You bring hope to those with no joy and peace to those in fear. When you pass in front of me like a secret I know I am special.

          The ghosts of creditors past...      I am an idiot. A person should have just one password and stick with it. I live in a password mecca. I have a different one for each place (just in case the russian spies are on to me, I guess).   I think my friend Marcy and I need to take a trip to New York City. We could get side jobs and vow to use all the money on plane fare and theatre tickets. Not one dollar or quarter filtered out of the jar to be spent on gas or milk! In a few months we would have the money. Hard work but worth the saving and scrimping, the selling of blueberries and the watching of children, the staring at the money-filled jar and thinking of all the delicious books and paper supplies, furniture and thrift-store browsing it could buy   if only if we just slipped out a bill or two .   We could attend a writer's workshop. Ride the subway and go to the village, to new Brooklyn. We would be filled with inspiration. We would read the  Times   before we go and while we were there,  The New Yorker  and and E.B. White.   But I have bills to pay. I have finally decided to pay off my debt. The extra money I earn from my side job is going straight to Sprint PCS, magazine collection services, Bellsouth and Avon. It will feel nice to be debt free in seven years.   When I am debt-free I can start planning trips and spending money without extra guilt. I am tired of hearing the "I shoulds" and "needtas" that whisper over my head when I make a pleasurable purchase, pick up something nice for myself.  Sppprrrriiiinnnntttt will huuuaaaannnnttt you fooooorrr thiissssss   it tells me.  yyyyooou aaare aaaa veerrrrryyy baaaaad girrrrrlllllll.   This is the ghooooost of avooooon.   Repent! You have threeee dayys toooo repeennnnnt!   I'm getting really sick of them.

       Not another teenage mom...   I was 21 when I got pregnant--not exactly a teenage mom. But I was the only one of my friends who was going to have a baby, I had dropped out of college, I was still dependent on my parents, and I was not married. In many aspects, I still  felt   like a teenager--certainly not someone who was ready to be responsible for an innocent. I was barely able to be responsible for myself. Throw in an abusive relationship with the father and you'll understand why I stayed awake at night wondering what I was getting me and the baby into.  I remember breaking the news to my parents. The baby's father and I had gotten into a huge screaming fight and I retreated to my mother's house. I told her point-blank as I entered the door, crying, that I was pregnant and the father was a jerk and she held me and rocked me. She was more afraid than I was--still, her strength inspired me. It was one of the more supportive times we've shared in our relationship--I needed her and she was there for me. She did not chide me or tell me how stupid I was. She simply rocked me and hugged me.  My parents had just gotten divorced. I spent afternoons at my dad's house. One night when he was preparing dinner I told him that I had something I wanted to tell him. He was in a jovial mood, for once, and he laughed and said "Let me guess--you're pregnant? Ha, ha."  I was not expecting that. It threw me off guard. "Yeah, actually I am." I said. His face deflated as though all the air had left a balloon. I could virtually see his heart jumping as he looked into my eyes and saw that there was truth in them. He dropped the spoon he was holding and hugged me. "Oh honey, I'm so sorry," he kept saying. He cried. I told him not to be sorry, that it was good news and I was happy about it. I wanted him to be happy too.   Later I felt guilty for putting my dad through that. He worried about me. But I remember thinking from the very beginning that everyone in my life needed to know right away: my child was too important to keep a secret. My child deserved a well-prepared reception.  The next day I told my grandmother. I remember my aunt telling me that she knew I was serious about keeping the baby once I had told grandma. I cleaned my grandma's house once or twice a week. We were in the back bedroom and she was showing me some knick-knack she had bought at a garage sale. I said "Grandma, I have good news for you--you're going to be a great-grandmother." She cried and covered her mouth with her petite hands and then she hugged me. She giggled like a school-girl. Later that day she came to me and said she was happy for me but she just wished that the baby was being born under better circumstances. I had to agree--I had the same desire. I was happy that she had said this instead of giving me the speech about sex before marriage and how dissappointed she was. Whatever feelings she had in this regard, she was kind enough to keep to herself. Things went better than I had expected.  She told my grandfather the news that night, I am sure. The next day I saw him in the blueberry field and he stopped to talk to me. My grandfather is a man of few words. His truck crawled to a stop when he saw me in the rows and he rolled down his window--my cue to walk over and initiate a conversation. "Hi grandpa," I said cheerfully. It was a warm spring day, the bees were buzzing, the clinic had just called to tell me that I was STD-free, and I was in a good mood. Grandpa didn't say much. He talked about everything except my pregnancy. So I brought it up--"Grandma told you the news, didn't she?" I asked.  "Yeah," he said, and smiled.  "Good," I said.  And that was that. He asked how I was feeling. "Fine."  I remember telling him  that I was thinking as many happy thoughts as I could so that maybe I will have a happy baby. This made him laugh.  When I decided to tell everyone in my life--including the people I feared telling the most--the result was that I garnered more support than I could ever have imagined. It instantly threw me into the full pitch of motherhood. It became so very real. I had multitudes of people sharing my excitement and concerns. They made sure I always had the most comfortable seat and wouldn't even let me get up to wash the dishes or brew iced-tea.  Issac Graceson David was born December 9, 2002. He   was   a happy baby. I have wished that the circumstances regarding his womb-house could have be more delightful, more peaceful, more traditional. Issac's vessel was beseiged with screaming voices at 3 am, with wracking sobs and confusion and grief and sometimes pure hatred.   At times, for Issac, I have envied the fetus of the married couple, the ripe love growing between both parents as they bless the womb together, the circle of enchantment that the two cast together as they become three, the spirit of undeniable love which surrounds their child. The circle that was cast between Issac and myself and his father was a different kind of circle-a pleading with his father to behave, I covenant that I must become a stronger woman, a dissension and breaking of comfort and habit.  I'm not sure who grew more during the gestation period--Issac or myself.  It is strange how something so convoluted and terrifying at first has led to so many small miracles--my dad is not in the greatest health and gets to enjoy a grandson before he dies, my mom is able to reconnect with her inner child and has a new source of joy in her life to pull her out of her depression, my relationship with my entire family has improved dramatically as we rallied together, I have become more independent and driven than ever before, I am going to graduate from college this year, I left an abusive partner and learned about my own self-worth,  and I have learned how to put my best foot forward and have faith in the prevailing power of love.    Once I was weak, and now I am strong. So strong. Issac has awakened a primal force within me. I am instantaneously a tiger and a swan. I have found that fine line between protection and vulnerability. I am fierce and gentle. I demand respect and I receive it.   I have experienced raw true love.   I will never be the same. I am a mother, a protector, a healer, a guide. I am a statue, a monument, a rock, stability. I am a lover, a kisser, a hunter, a friend. I am direction, a vision, hope, and a home.

       Ah....a vacation    A vacation and a wedding are waiting for me over spring break. On saturday I will be a bridesmaid in my best friend Alexis's wedding. I hope my hair turns out okay as I have no definite plans for how to wear it, only one vague idea, which is "up." I am nervous about being in her wedding, hoping that somehow I don't screw it all up. You know, my period could start at any minute during the ceremony and come dripping down my leg, or I could trip and fall, or go out drinking with friends the night before and have huge black circles under my eyes, or get a nosebleed. Anything is possible.   After the wedding I am driving to Tampa where I will wake up at 4am with Issac and my Dad and Lori and her daughter Chelsea and we will eat breakfast and go to the airport for our 7am 4 hour flight to Tuscon, Arizona.  Issac and I will spend our vacation in and out of carseats as we drive around the state. We will stay in air-conditioned hotels but only those with swimming pools. I will recline in a white plastic lounge chair. We will go to the petrified forest and the Grand Canyon and swim in Reddington and hike around the desert mecca wearing lots of sunscreen and admiring the boldness of red clay and giant brown rocks. I will take one hundred pictures. I will imagine our life filled with mariachis and rancheros and purple cacti and horses and cattle and sexy lean cowboys and rodeos and the desert and the green valleys that cut through the mountains. The mogollon rim and the pine trees and train-tracks and caves and the clouds that make shadows on the side of the mountains. The fog and the floods and the feeling that it is still 1893.    Here is another poem:    Carnevale   classic americana is primary colors and a coke take your pick of burger king blue mcD's yellow or KFC red of gas stations on both sides of the road  if it has flashing lights we will buy it  my mardis gras feast of french fries was delicious served up hot on a big white plate I slapped the waiter's hand away twice.

        The Kingdom of God is Within You   I am a hopeless romantic. I find myself wanting to fall in love with every man I meet. I imagine our life together over the next five years, ten, twenty. The places we'll live and the romantic things we'll do and the fights we will endure run through my head in a happy manner. Then I wake up and realize that I don't even really   know   this person. I chide myself for walking a thin line between a lively imagination and blatant desperation. I'm not desperate.   I've met my first group of religious friends. They are not my first group of religious acquaintances, for I have known many of those. When I was in highschool I knew all the kids in Fellowship of Christian Athletes. They were all good kids. Very nice, usually. Driven, focused, successful, happy. They excuded a strength that came from knowing God was on their side, all the time, a friend to call on. They all seemed to have God's personal phone number. I was sick with envy.  I was not raised religiously. There was not a Bible in our house until I was seventeen and bought one for myself. These days, I am not envious of the happiness of my religious friends, because I have found that I, too, am very religious and through my relationship with God I have become very happy. The only problem is that I am "deviantly" religious, which traditional religious people say doesn't count. God isn't on my side, they tell me-- not daring to tell me I am going to hell because, let's face it, it's hard to tell someone they are going to hell and keep them as a friend. They are sure that if they subscribe entirely to an ancient thought system they will be saved, they will never die.  I've spent a lot of time convincing myself that God is not mad at me for choosing to believe in her a different way. This is the only part I envy--the assured blessing, the propaganda   for   my views instead of against them. I'm not particularly fond of always being on the outside.  I hope my new friends don't disdain my religious choice, being untraditional as it is. In past experiences, the reception of me and my beliefs is less well recieved than Judaism or Islam. Perhaps I am more threatening because I don't completely subscribe my beliefs to a single book.   It would break the hearts of the Iron River Pentacostals if they read this. My heart breaks with them.     Second-hand Faith    The one-eyed cyclops says we will believe every word the white walls quake and we shake and stomp our feet   we will   believe   every word  have no doubt and celebrate salvation Cyclops asks us questions demands our answers   Do we feel the spirit?  our hands reach into the air grasping desparately for some belief some relief our souls are in his hands. I think he wants to eat us. I am a wicked, wicked girl to make such bold suggestions but I can not bear the taste of acidic indigestion. I'll take my soul in my own hands, TYVM. This is what I say outside the church they click tongues at my mistake while men touch my back and women hover over me speaking different languages I am the center of attention as the pray and fret over my worthiness why can't she be saved? Why won't she be saved? concern is always powerful they conjure up spirits like the best the voodoo dancers and all the rest we're just inches away from snakes I want to tell them after, I hug them all they promise to keep on prayin' I hope they know that I ain't changin' though to tell the truth, I'm not sure I would last too long  they sing a mighty pretty song. When sister Julia suffers my burden for me I'm only mildly afraid and lonely the only "unbeliever" in the crowd FYI, I want to scream my second-hand faith stands up proud my second-hand faith my protective shroud.

      I really should be studying for the final I am supposed to be taking in thirty minutes, but it is a final for an education class and education is an art and a craft, not a skill that can be acquired, and since I possess this art already I don't think that studying will do much good.  So instead, I will sit here and indulge myself with some writing. How about a poem?      The Earth's Movement      Snot never felt so good as it did this morning when you kissed me seven times  to wake me up, your eager morning eyes were shining and you were playing peek-a-boo, rolling in the covers.  You, Issac, like my only rising sun, you are sometimes all I see when I haven't slept well when I am tempted to dwell in personal misery,  all of life's mystery.  I had three dreams last night, little one. In the first, a letter was delivered.  In the second, you and I were dancing in the snow. In the third, I read the letter, and it told me that love is the only magic.  And now you need to be dressed and fed, so I take myself out of bed, I stop worrying inside my head and put shoes on you instead.  You have been the greatest blessing to a woman who can't decide between a sandal or a shoe, a woman who lives in other worlds more than she inhabits  the earth.  I've learned about the earth's movements, my dear, you've brought this education to me-- how the earth continues spinning  and mouths continue eating how this woman is but a small figure on a larger map protected, sheltered by her love and by yours.     Bike Riding     What is the world to you, little one? What do you see, peeking out of your yellow plastic helmet, the one with the ladybugs on it,  the helmet that falls over your head and jostles you to sleep? Your alien resemblance in this piece of modern plastic with its apertures  humors me most deeply.  You, my little squeeze, are getting skinny and tall. A blueberry-muncher, a diaper avoider, a horse-lover, a miniature cowboy.  I ride with you under canopies of green. You go "ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh" over the bumps and rumps, touching your nose and saying "noh!" Holding on to your ears as though they are priceless, convinced of your uniqueness.  Your fingers explore everything. Nostrils, eyes, bellies, sticks and stones and sandy socks. Your open mouth is an excited squeal.  I will remember how we rode, you and I, in the early summertime,  under the trees, when you were still behind me, attached to my bike, my back, myself.  You are getting skinny.

         The Bluegrass Festival at Sertoma Youth Ranch...     I have never seen so many RV's in my life. Monica, Brian, Allan, and I were the only people under sixty at the entire event. A few scraggly, dirty, rambunctious eleven-year olds were running around the camp on Sunday, but they don't count. A couple of young looking bearded guys with a dog and leather motoring hats arrived on Saturday but we were there first. The bands played on a stage under an open pavilion. Behind the stage, a wall was painted red and strategic white lines were painted over the red to resemble a giant old-fashioned barn door. I was ready for a ho-down under the tin roof of the pavilion, but all of the dancing space was occupied by hundreds of motely fold-out chairs, with names like "Derrion" and "W.Zortehiemer" puff-painted on their backs. The gang and I were chair theifs--like mockingbirds, we would sit in these retiree's unoccupied nests until they returned. They never minded anyways--everyone was so nice. Lots of people wore blue T-shirts that said "IT AIN"T BLUEGRASS IF IT DON"T HAVE A BANJO." If I looked good in T-shirts I would have bought one. (I hate T-shirts).  Despite some tragic personal events that required Allan to drive me back to Gainesville on Saturday afternoon (one word--Baby'sdaddy) I had a great time.   The highlight of the event was Friday night when we loaded up on coke and whiskey and then went off looking for a jam session. They were everywhere. Monica and I brought our guitars, but we didn't play them. Monica was shy and kept hers in her softshell case across her back--I carried mine in my hands but just sat there with it, hugging it on my lap. Brian and Allan were afraid that they couldn't hang but before they knew it they were picking away on their mandolins. We didn't know it until afterwards, but they were playing with internationally renowned bluegrass superstars.   Then some old jerry-garcia looking man asked me " can you play that thang or do you just set thar and hold it? " and I told him I was just beginning and he said "hell, it don't matter" and before I knew what was happening I was sitting on a stool humoring him with my dorky bluegrass version of  the house of the rising sun.  Even more amazingly, I was actually singing too. And then someone picked up a string-bass and then another bearded man named "Herb" picked up his guitar and then Allan on the mandolin joined in and a banjo joined in and a crowd formed around to listen. And a nice old man named Jack was standing next to me and stomping his foot to the rythm and exclaiming "Damn! Look at that girl pick! Yeehaw!" Then Herb pulled a silver flask of whiskey out of his pocket and urged me to try some and I did and it was good and smooth. Jack had a swig too and we were all laughing.   Anyways, I never imagined in a million years that this would happen but I guess I deserve it because I have been practicing. Jack helped me out by calling out the chords for me and they gave me some advice on holding a pick better and we went around the circle starting songs and jamming out for about twenty minutes or so--it felt like forever-- and then it was my turn to lead a song and I didn't remember any more and so it all kind of ended. But it was awesome. And now I can say that I too, played with charismatic banjo legend Bobby Chris.  I decided that I really like bluegrass, it's pretty simple to do bluegrass guitar.  Even better, all the songs are spiritual and soul-felt and fun to sing. I didn't even feel bad about missing church on Sunday--a lot of the songs were about God and forgiveness and love.  So what do I think about Bluegrass? I highly recommend it. Go check out the group called "Swinging Bridges." That's MY banjo player there on the cover. Yeah, that's right, I know him.

          In Response to Inspiration and the Work of Being an Artist....      My friend, who is a really great writer and a word snob, has written an inspiring response to my growing apathy towards English as a profession. It is called "The Importance of English in a Technical Society." Check it out at her site,  urlLink Stellarpurpledaisy .  Also, if I have any readers lurking about that I don't know yet, email me and let me know who you are! Readers whom I do know, please feel free to drop me a line as well.  urlLink Email me!   I'm going camping this weekend at a bluegrass festival, so I won't be posting again until Monday. Let the good times roll.

        Inspiration and the Work of Being an Artist...    I work in short bursts of inspiration. Sometimes I feel I am nothing more than a sponge waiting for the Muse to enter me, to take control and direct my short bursts of genius.  I chase the Muse, attempting to catch its attention. I wave my hands wildly, shouting, "Hey Muse, over here! Come visit me for a while! I'll buy you dinner!"  I was walking on campus today trying to justify why I am a Liberal Arts major at one of the top universities in the country. I felt like an imposter, as though I should not be here walking among the palm trees and hundred-year-old buildings and the "academics."  Academians are physists and chemical engineers, botanists and doctors and dentists and veterinarians, graphic designers and computer programmers, archeologists and anthropologists and linguists and political scientists. They come to the university to learn a trade, a specific curriculum in a special field. I have come here to study English. I already know English, and so does everybody else-- so it leaves me feeling rather unsatisfied and doubtful that I have accomplished anything at all during my four year enrollment as a student of the English department.  Chemical engineers and scientists know chemical science AND they know how to read and write and speak. I am nothing special. There is no authority in the fact that I am an English major. It offers me nothing truly different or unique. I feel like I know nothing more useful than the average literate American.   Nobody will hire me because I am an English major. I didn't even study the  useful  aspects of English, such as grammar or editing. I studied literature and writing and rhetoric. And then, I didn't specialize in a field of literature. I am not a specialist in Medeival Literature or British Literature or Early American Literature, nor am I a top-notch Deconstructionist or specialist in literary theory. I am simply a person who has achieved only a simple understanding of a subject which I and every other literate person knew to begin with, before I ever came to college.  I am only slightly depressed about this. Somehow, somewhere, I feel like what I am doing is important. I feel this way because my heart tells me that this is what I am supposed to do. If this is what I am supposed to do, then maybe it will all make sense some day, but try telling that to an unemployable 23 year-old.  Our teachers spout all this cheap talk to us about how understanding literature is a powerful tool to understanding humanity and how understanding literature will help us develop tools to analyze our present culture and how understanding literature will develop us into demi-gods who know the elusive "truth" of the world. Well, that only makes me feel pompous and idiotic. Who am I to claim to know the "truth" of the world, and who even gives a damn if I do? Knowing the "truth" will not help me to solve the world's problems, it will not help me get elected U.S. President, it will not even get me a job as a secretary in a small company typing a balding sweaty man's dictation and memos.  It might get me a job as a teacher, but even this is not looking exciting as I face the hell of writing lesson plans actually objectifying what it is that I believe is important to teach people--because they make you do that, objectify everything. I prefer to live in an unobjectified world.   The truth is, I am still very confused about what I believe, and if I even believe that what I believe is important. The task of writing down and objectifying what I believe is daunting and formidable. I want to sit down and do it, but I don't even know where to begin. I have this haunting feeling, though, that if I don't do this I will continue to live in a muddy world of swirling half-developed ideas and false-starts.  There is so much to believe... so many crooks and ninnies to explore, to give life to, to animate.  I'm losing faith in the power of literature as a tool to discovering "the truth." Who the hell knows what the truth is, and who even cares? I don't want to be a haughty English professor who thinks I have more of a grip on the world because I study literature. Actually, I think these people have LESS of a grip on the world since they live in their offices and analyze imaginary people in imaginary lives. As the daily concerns of living my life overwhelm the faculties of my brain, the idea of attempting to find the elusive truth of the world becomes less serious, more mocking, and rather silly. Who cares? My view of the world has become rather flippant indeed.  The sad fact is that the study of Literature comes around to the study of Philosophy, and I got a D in the only philosophy class that I ever took. I was completely overwhelmed and confused. NONE of it made sense to me. We read Barthes and Plato and Locke and I was lost in a sea of 17th century odd spellings and weird words. The concepts were obscure and abstract and my brain really couldn't wrap itself completely around them.  Have you ever tried to have a discussion with a Philosophy major? They are just as lost as us English majors. They have no idea what they are really talking about, or else they are just repeating what someone else said, and mangling it up pretty badly in the process. Who can ever attempt to know the "truth?" It's so impossible, why should we even bother? This has been the struggle of humanity for all time--we seem to think there is just one "thing" out there, floating in the ephemeral, and if we can just get our hands on it we can answer every riddle, solve every problem, unite the world in peace. English and Philosophy majors are wasting their lives trying to figure out an unanswerable riddle.  I don't think the truth exists. The only truth I know is that while my attempt to discover this truth is admirable, it has been mostly a waste. I have been to the bounds of the human mind on a guided tour thanks to UF and I have returned, and all that I am able to say is "don't worry about it, there's not too much to see. It's too dark. Return to your normal lives."  Ah, but it is the mystery that intrigues us.  Anyways, while I am trying to discover what it is that I believe, and while I go finish some schoolwork, I will be certain of one thing--writing is a skill, an art, and a beauty. Studying english is pointless unless you write, kind if like studying paintings verse actually painting them.  And there IS truth in literature when it teaches us about what it means to be human and how to be better humans. Art, and writing, is a reflection of morality. Whether creating visions of morality is important or not is another question for another day. Perhaps it is the most important question of our day.  I just don't know how I'm going to teach literature if I'm not allowed to preach to my students about morality, if I have to be objective. In all honesty, I see my position as a teacher more as a position of a preacher, which is probably a horrible thing to say if I want to work in the secular public school system. Oh well. ______________ On a happy note, I talked to Dr. New about doing an independent study with him over summer on Milton, and he said that would be viable. He then added that he was very impressed with my answers in class, that they were always very intelligent and that he could always count on me to answer the tougher questions he put forth. I was pleased that he noticed.

        My Weekend in 100 Words...    Baby shower for Meggin. Slyvia has pretty curtains, made cheescake in paper flowers, so pretty. Yvonne is the french grandmother--many promises to visit her again.  Art Festival with Dre and Matt. At 7pm, Symphony Orchestra downtown on the lawn, the Hairstons, Issac likes to eat cigarette butts. Issac to bed on time, Shakespeare paper written and a few plays read, drink lots of coffee, up till 2 am. Cranky in  the morning, house a wreck. Long nap. Clipped roses, blew up plastic whale pool and almost passed out. Attempted bike seat assembly results in cursing. Allan teaches me how to use tools, saves the day. He eats blueberry for his labor. Issac looks adorably hillarious in huge yellow helmet, my tiny alien creature.

        I Miss Even Your Drool...    It is odd that I do not remember how Alley Cat first came into our household.  All I recall is that he arrived when I was young enough to think naming him after a brand of cat food conferred to him the greatest dignity.   In a house with a strong tradition against naming animals, it is a surprise that his name ever stuck at all.  For generations the cats in my family have been nothing more significant than barn cats and have been named one of three generic names: Tom (if male), Cat (insert appropriate color), or Kitty.  I can still see the lines of my mother’s mouth growing tight and the grip on her hand-purse growing stronger when, at the grocery store, I would insist she purchase Alley-Cat brand cat food instead of the plain brown bags of Publix brand or Winn-Dixie.  The special cat food brought a keen shine to Alley Cat’s fur, which was as soft and silky smooth as a rabbit’s.  The only nuisance in petting him was that his hairs would come off in your hand and float around the room in little flurries of fluff.  Because of this I bought him a blue plastic hairbrush.  One hundred strokes before bedtime became our routine.  As I stroked him, his long whiskers and broad cheekbones vibrated with the strength of his ardent purr, and beads of drool often pooled up under his chin and dripped into my lap.  His eyes and his head rolled back in deluxe pleasure, high exaltation, or pure luxury.  He was always thankful for attention.  He was like an old man who loves little girls: sweet, loving, smiling, appreciative and lonely.  Were Alley Cat human, I’m sure he would have had me sitting in his lap.  Instead, he consented to sit in mine.  He was always as close to me as I permitted.  Not since Alley Cat have I received so much joy in petting a feline.  The sheer amount of joy and love he received from my laying-of-hands on his fur was evident in the size of the drool puddle he left on the floor—a puddle that left my hands feeling magically powerful and strong.  Alley Cat’s under-footedness only occasionally caused confusion.  On cold winter mornings before I threw off the covers, over the noise of percolating coffee, I could hear my Dad stumbling over Alley Cat as he went about making breakfast.  I knew then that Alley Cat was rubbing against my Dad’s feet.   My Dad’s grumbles and swears at the cat soon disappeared and when I arrived from the hall Alley Cat would be purring in my Dad’s arms.  Holding Alley Cat was irresistible.  Eventually he could win anyone over.  Alley Cat himself turned out to be an excellent father. When Alley Cat was approaching his middle years an opportunity came to our family in the form of an orange kitten that allowed his paternal nature to blossom.  We baptized the new tabby “Tigger.”  A spunky spitfire, we rescued her from certain death in the tangles of a fishing net left in an abandoned garage.  We submitted ourselves to countless scratches and also to the oily black dirt on the floor to draw her out.  For this she has never seemed appropriately thankful.  “Alley Cat will be jealous and miserable,” was my Mother’s principal attempt to discourage Tigger’s homecoming. But home she came, and through the grace of Alley Cat’s gregarious nature she was received whole-heartedly.  He groomed her without cease, with long strokes of his course pink tongue, and was not deterred from his task even when she swatted at his face.  He patiently permitted her to have her kittenish tendencies—when he ate from his food dish and she attacked his tail, he seemed to sigh “kittens will be kittens,” and continue about his business with minimal perturbation.  He watched her adoringly while she ate.  He shared his own food dish with her.    Alley Cat spent most of his time ushering Tigger into adulthood.  Though Tigger has always maintained a sense of wildness and has never been completely tamed, her heart was soft toward her doting father.  He cleaned behind her ears, followed her and protected her on walks, fought off snakes before she stumbled on them, taught her how to wrestle and fight, saw that she gained mastery in the art of hunting, and chided her when she stayed out too late at night by biting her neck. Each evening they shared a ritual in which Alley Cat bathed Tigger with his tongue while she held absolutely still.  Then, in return, she gave him two or three cursory licks.  I admit I grew jealous of their relationship.  After all, I was the one who used to give and receive such affections.  Tigger seemed to meet my eye with a look that said, “see, I am a princess, and even my father knows this.”  The mild Florida winters set in and passed and Alley Cat and Tigger groomed each other and kept company.  One winter Alley Cat grew thin and then he altogether disappeared.  I think he politely wandered to the woods to pass away alone—to keep death and our bereavement distanced.  We have never found a body or bones.  Occasionally I will still remember the peace of sitting in front of a warm window in the yellow sunlight, ten years old, rocking in a chair with that soft cat on my lap and nothing else in the world to consider.  This morning, when I came down the stairs, Tigger was meowing to be fed.  She swatted at me and stuck a claw into my leg.  She treats me as though she were mistress and I her misbehaving servant.  She demands to be pet when it appeals to her, but if I am to pick her up and set her in my lap on my own accord she bites my thumbs and  grabs my wrists with her claws.  Outdoors she meows to be let in, and once inside the house she meows to be let out. After Alley Cat left us, I tried to convince Tigger into becoming my sleeping companion.  I would bring her to my bed and feed her kitty treats; she would nibble the treats and then leave.  After repeating this experiment multiple times with similar results I gave up.  I soon learned that I was not missing very much—she jumped onto my bed one night and lied right on top of my feet. I felt rather guilty when I kicked her off of the bed.  Tigger is an enigma.  She has grown fat and her stomach is soft and droopy, but she once was lithe and wiry.  She has a small frame, a short tail, and a miniature face with slanted green eyes, but she walks as though she is as large and fierce as a panther.  Her small teeth are sharp and she is quick to snap if displeased.  Her coat is course and her outer hairs do not fall out—intriguingly, under her coarser orange outer-coat is a thick layer of downy white fuzz.  Her white chest consists only of this fuzzy matter and is the softest part of her fur. She will not let me touch it.  She is a beautiful queen.  I would hold her more often, but I don’t like to be bitten.  She is the type of cat that you cannot seduce—she must come to you.  When she does sit on a lap she uses it as a sharpening instrument, repetitiously kneading left paw and right paw into your leg.  For fifteen years has Tigger  dragged birds and mice and moles to my doorstep.  For fifteen years she has followed me on walks, balancing the length of the board fence that borders the driveway to my house.  For fifteen years has she puzzled me with two very distinct modus operandi: one childlike, seeking affection and petting, that crawls into my lap and falls into a deep sleep—the other, wild and unpredictable, with a sinister and errant claw that draws blood regularly.  I have learned when to draw close to Tigger and when to keep a distance—mainly from trial and error.  If she scratches once during the day, she will strike again.  If Alley Cat was a welcoming and nurturing father, Tigger has not progressed beyond a spoiled and self-centered adolescent.  Before Alley Cat’s death, we welcomed another addition to the family.  Natasha was a lean black kitten who earned her name due to her resemblance to the conniving Russian woman of the Borris and Natasha duo from The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show.  Alley Cat welcomed Natasha as he had Tigger—adopting her as his own daughter—and Tigger could not accept this.  She threw temper tantrums in the form of hideous groaning meows, developed odd habits such as refusing to come off of the furniture (she also refused to allow Natasha on the furniture), and was openly nasty to the poor kitten in the form of hisses and evil glances.  Alley Cat plodded along at his even pace loving both girls equally.  Tigger gave him the silent treatment.  Alley Cat just seemed to sigh and say “teenagers will be teenagers.”  He did not take it personally, which infuriated Tigger.  After Alley Cat died, we were forced to give Natasha away due to Tiggers continual abuse.  Four nights ago, on Thursday, Tigger woke me at 3:37 in the morning in her usual way.  The first phase of this process consists of persistent meowing, which I routinely ignore.  This is my first mistake.  If ignored, she goes to the window and rattles the blinds by climbing and jumping on them. It makes an awful racket but I am an accomplished sleeper and simply put the pillow over my head.  The pillow-move was developed to avert the third stage of her design—climbing on top of my head, and sometimes lying on it.  The physiology of the human facial structure includes several painful pressure points, most of which Tigger manages to find with acute accuracy when standing on my cheekbones.  If applying pressure to my facial-cranial cavities or attempting to suffocate me with her furry stomach does not rouse me, she is forced to revert to phase four and pee on my bed.  Tigger is frequently an annoyance to me.  As I am walking out the door with my baby son on my hip and a diaper bag slung over my arm and my purse on my shoulder and my backpack on my back and coffee and appointment book and banana and green sippy-cup and keys in hand, Tigger bolts into the house and hides.  She is too old to stay in all day—I refuse to clean a litter-box, so I must laboriously set everything down and find her.  I am late to work.  I can’t count on both hands the number of times during a single day that she runs under my feet and trips me, causing me to spill something or inviting near death on the staircase.  I keep her for sentimental reasons and because I have had her for so long.  One might hear me talk about these animals and conclude that I am a “cat-person,” but I would not classify myself as such.  I much prefer the intelligence of dogs.  My family has encountered several cats in passing, but only these two, Tigger and Alley Cat, have aroused in me a loyal concern and curiosity.  Alley Cat was the first, his “daughter” the next, and after these I do not know if there will be another.  I suppose that after Tigger passes I will miss Alley Cat the most.  Tigger is a loving pain in a more hectic world.  Yet I am thankful foe the memories these two small animals have left me. If I never have another cat again, I will remember these two with fondness and it will be enough.  Ah, the days were long, the evenings cool, the scratches painful and insulting; the lap was warm, the purring strong, and the drool prolific.

         The Sky is Falling...Literally      A portentous morning. As I was walking to class, three branches fell out of trees just feet in front of my path.  It is very windy and rainy and wet outside and when I was dressing this morning I felt like wearing nothing but dark black wool. I don't have any black wool, but I did wear black. I couldn't find my umbrella...  It's kind of funny when you wake up two hours before your 8:30 class and you are still late. I bet my teacher thinks I'm just another lazy student rolling out of bed at 8:15. I just wink at him when I come in the back of the room, late, because he's frowning at me and I'm thinking "I was up before you were." Considering the way I've been feeling lately, I consider myself lucky to make it to class at all, even though it is disappointing to go through all the effort of getting out of the house just to sit in class for only twenty minutes. At least I made it in time for the quiz.  Issac update: temper tantrums are on the rise. I don't know what I'm going to do today--I've no idea how to tell a toddler that he can't play outside in the rain. Maybe I ought to buy some yellow macintoshes and galoshes for both of us and we can go on long walks in it and splash in the puddles and smell the wet earth and make mud-pies. But back to the temper tantrums. I find it hilarious that the only person he misbehaves for is me. Why is that? Why do other people besides the ones we love the most get the privilige of our best manners and most kind selves?   This morning, after piling kiss upon kiss on his sleepy mother, Issac was in a wonderful mood and I told him to go pick out a book thinking that this would buy me about 15 more seconds of precious eye-closing avoidance of the world. Of course he was very excited about this and it only took him about 5 seconds. He brought  Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What do you Hear?  which is his new favorite book. I roused myself into a sitting position and turned on the lamp and then reached down to lift his smiling little body onto the bed, at which point he threw the book at me and then continued by projecting himself violently backwards on the ground followed by even more violent kicking and screaming.   "Okay Issac, you don't have to get on the bed if you don't want to."   "waaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!"  "What's the matter?"  "WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !"  I reach down to lift him up anyways. He slaps my hands away and screams even louder, as though I've hurt him somehow. So I pull my hands back into my lap, and amazingly enough, this is even more upsetting to him. Tears are squirting out of his malicious mommy-hating eyes. If there was a court and judge and jury, certainly I would be found guilty of some crime. He is turning red and his kicking scoots him across the rug until he hits his head on the dresser.   "Do you want to read a book?"  "WAAAAA! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!"  I try talking to him in cave-man talk, like the newest book written by some doctor says to do.   "Issac mad. Issac no feel good. Ouchy Ouchy. Issac angry. Issac no like something. Issac no like mama."  He stops to look at me for second, a little puzzled, and then kicks his screaming into third gear. I think at this point he is crying because he has suddenly realized that I am going to utterly embarass him later on in his life. I give up and let him cry while I get dressed,  telling myself that it actually doesn't hurt my ears, convincing myself that it is possibly hillarious.   Yesterday at Marcy's house he did the same thing for 45 minutes.  At Easter dinner I had to get up and leave the table because he was screaming and throwing things.  Yet when I leave him with a babysitter, he is a perfect angel-doll. He cries when I leave sometimes, but never for more than 30 seconds or so. He is all smiles and laughs and tickles and giggles for  everyone else  .  It's funny how we meet our manipulative capabilities at an early age. It must be some sort of experiment or game--"I wonder what mommy will do if I just lay down and start screaming and being as obnoxious as possible? Maybe she will give me candy or do a funny goofy dance and song for me. I don't care what she does, really. I'm bored and this sounds like a lot of fun." It's his new favorite game.  Well, the song and dance stops here kid. Mom's not a number in Issac's stage show any longer. We can still do songs and dances together, but you're not running this ring and I don't work for free. We're re-working this contract, you see? Say ya do, kid, or their's gonna be trouble. Here's my lawyer. He'll tell you where to sign. And while you're at it, guys, work out a clause about potty-training.

         The Devil's in the Details...    Let me contrive to tell all my readers what a dork I am by telling you how I came to school tonight absolutely convinced that I had a test at 8:30 pm. It was written on the front of my folder in blue ink: TEST 3, MONDAY, 8:30 PM, NPB 1001.  I spent this Easter weekend slouched over my desk wondering what kind of immoral teacher assigns a test the day after Easter. Only after I went to the physics building and did not see masses of students frantically flipping through their notebooks I realized something was awry. I went back to my car to check the time of the test and noticed underneath the bold informative print of my own hand a little scribble that said "April 19," a little squeak of a message, a sickly looking cipher. I could have kicked myself. The sad (or funny) thing is that I did the same thing last semester in the SAME ROOM, but instead of being early I was an hour too late. I was less than 60 minutes away from an A in physics last semester.  I've never been a detail person. I have a planner, but it always stared at me reminding me of things to do and people to call and lessons to learn and I wanted desperately to throw it in the trash can or out of my car window when I am driving, and so now it rests in the pocket of my car's passenger door, untouched for the past two months. I was afraid of what I might do to it--funny how a brown leather binding can look so menacing, seem so alive. The odd thing is, when I follow my planner and enter things into it and make sure I do A, B, C, and D in   that   order, my life seems so much easier. Time has been spent wisely. I feel complete. In my bath at the end of the night, I pat myself on the back and take a deep smiling breath as I know I have pleased the insatiable demands of my daybook. I am happy because the planner is happy. I have made the appropriate ritualistic sacrifices and it will not eat me or send down a flood. All things are compartmentalized. God is in his heaven and all is right with the world--at first.  Everything is going well until the planner starts sneaking in essential tasks A, B, C, D,  E, F,  and  G  . It's just a few more errands, no big deal. But the planner is hungry. It wants more. The next thing I know, I am in a frenzy trying to complete the entire English alphabet. I become impatient, like my planner, secretly cursing the woman in front of me at Wal-Mart whose debit-card won't work, yelling at Quinn because he is so utterly slow, a sloth in a sack race.  I will traffic to clear and people to talk faster. My brain becomes a mess of demonic should'ves and could'ves swirling around in a frothy sea of panic. "I could've driven the other way and saved two whole minutes!" "Hey Stupid, you should've done task H after you did task W, you would have saved half an hour!"   At night, after completing the entire alphabet and five or six counting numbers, I fall alseep in my bath and wake up in cold water. I am not willing to live my life that way, falling asleep only to have alphabetic nightmares of numbers and letters eating me alive, pulling at my skin, stretching me tight across the belly of a drum and pounding as they dance around a fire chanting at me "She must, she must, she must increase or bust."  Yet I always take things to the opposite extreme. Since I went on strike, the disorder has been getting to me. Sure, it has been relaxing lying on the couch, picking wildflowers, singing happy songs in the car on the way to school, completely IGNORING my little planner. But the garbage hasn't gone to the dump in a few weeks and it's really growing into a worrisome mess, I still need to mail about ten letters including a traffic ticket and some bills, I need to balance my checkbook before I run out of money, and the laundry sea is overtaking the islands of living space that Issac and I have eked out of the chaos in the bedroom. I applied late for financial aid and have no real clue when some of my asssignments are due. I haven't collected payment from my boss and I haven't began planning for fall registration.  What is scary is that this doesn't really worry me too much. I've always made it by like this, like a car on ice slipping and spinning into its destination. I know I'll get there eventually. I just wish I could get there well manicured with my planner by my side. I wish I could arrive at the little town called Perfect. I wish me and my planner could be friends, pals, bride and bridegroom.   Maybe the problem is with the planner, not me. Maybe the planner needs to learn that it is not the master of my life, that it is more like a trusted friend. Maybe it needs to stop expecting so much.   I want to accomplish things in my life. I want to be the best at something. I want people to offer me an amazing salary and beg me to work for them. I want to have things to put on my resume--"what makes YOU special, Ms. Ferguson?"  I'm sure they won't care about how I had a bloody battle with my little brown planner and came out victorious. They are compatriots of the planner. Revolters like me are dangerous. The rebellion might spread. Before you know it, there will be three-day week-ends and extra holidays, two months of vacation time and children playing in the office.   Sometimes I want so badly to be an automaton, an accomplisher, a producer, a top out-put. The outlets I put my energy into seem to help none but myself and my closest friends and family--it is not marketable. It does not sell. It cannot go on my resume--"has risen to the top of her field. Best friend, daughter, mother, sister in the Southeast region 2003. Voted family member of the year 1999-2004." But these are the things that are important to me.  I'm not saying that these things are not extremely important to other people too. I'm just saying that I'm finding myself stuck in the lovely position where I have not had to deal with these real-world things yet. I don't have to worry about too many bills to pay. I don't have to work a 40 hour week to survive. In so many ways, my days are free to myself. And I've chosen to do things for myself. And nobody else is ever going to care about that. And sometimes it makes me feel like a total bum and loser, and my little planner laughs at me and tells me "ha ha ha! You will never know what it takes to be successful and support yourself if you continue to be so lazy!" To which I respond, "Shut up. Everything will work out fine. I can be 'lazy' if I want to." I'm okay with giving just what it takes to the world to stay alive and clean and well-fed. I am the kind of person who needs a lot of personal time. Call it lazy, call it genius, call it what you will.  I call it sanity.

          Mystery...       Mystery, what are you? A covert sensibility, a whisp, a barely-knowing  intoxicating thrill. You are the aspect  of lovers, entwined in one another's faults and glories. You are in their eyes, their arms.  It is you they long for most, after years have promised answers, a senseless vulnerability--What happens next? Even you yourself are unsure penning over your dark desk delicate endings. Fortune is your lover, but you are master over that wench. She rubs your feet with oil, whispers soft names into your ear, licks your lobes and tickles imagination, an utter distraction to your office. Still you are a womanizer-- a Tom for those naive girls who shed their robes, decloak to scorn the night and dance naked in the day.  You scoff at their glee.  You would have the day darken into night, everyone retreat to colder climes where knowledge is forbidden and wonder punished. Mystery is the Master! Mystery, I make love to your darkness!

          The Rivers of Hell...       I have emerged from the underworld of hell, and I am alive to tell the story. Hell is nothing like we think it is--the only burning flame of fire is the fever that licks an infant brow.  Hell is full of poop and diahrea, spilling out the backs of diapers, stinking, stenching, retchid, abundant rivers of poop. Volcanoes of vomit. There is no time to sit down or rest your feet. Days and nights are spent slaving in the hot, steamy laundry room, transferring endless piles of laundry from one machine into another. As a particularly cruel joke, you are forced to endure the shrill shrieking cries of your spawn who has been transformed into a miniature gargoyle creature, enraged for hours by something as simple as your refusal to let him eat the cat food. Your beautiful angel becomes a demonic creature only a mother could love. You are <> this close to losing it. You wonder what bond of love has you standing up to your elbows in a flood of bodily fluids rocking and hushing a kicking child into a state of calm. The power of love is great.   When Issac was sick these past few days, he took an extreme attachment to his sippy cup. Now he takes it with him everywhere. It has become an appendage, like Captain Hook's silver hand. At least the boy has enough sense to rehydrate himself.  When Issac was sick these past few days, I thought I was going to go crazy. I felt so bad for him--you can't explain to him that it's going to go away soon, that it's important for him to rest, that he needs to eat this rice and this bland oatmeal in order to get better, that milk is not good for his tummy, that he should just relax and watch this movie with mommy. He wanted to go outside and play in the sun and sweat out all his energy and health. He wanted to kick and scream and cry for 45 minutes when I decided that the cat food bowl officially goes out of his reach forever. He had a similar reaction when I decided that cheerios are for eating and not for taking out of the bag handful by handful to create a cheerio castle in his toybox. He had a fit for about thirty minutes when I couldn't tell that he wanted his sippy cup to be all the way full, not just 3/4 full. He went on an eating strike. He had fits about his shoes being on, then fits about them being off. He wanted to be held someplace in between "up" and "down." He wanted to play someplace between "outdoors" and "indoors."  In short, his temper tantrums increased by about 50% and he had toxic sopping wet diapers every twenty minutes in addition to this. He wouldn't give me kisses. It was hard. I have seen things you would never believe.  I'm not looking forward to next time.

      Softball  I went to Leo's for lunch the other day with Marcy. When I leaned over and said "Hey Charlie, can we get some more salad plates?," to CharLES, who HATES to be called CharLIE, it was kind of funny because it took me a second to figure out why he was giving me such a mean look. I was blameless--I was in Marcy mode--her husband is named Charlie. Once I figured it out I forgave Charles and I think he forgave me.  Then he asked me if I wanted to be on the Softball team this year. Yes. Of course I do.   What do I not love about Softball? About nerve-racking suspense as every one stares at you, just you, with the heavy metal bat and knees over the dusty plate? With your elbow tilted just up at that perfect most comfortable angle? With your hands touching each other just right? Staring the pitcher down as you remember how Ty Cobb said batting is a breeze if you can just scare the pitcher? "Clink"-- contact. Running, racing, watching, judging, sliding, cheering, stealing, scoring. Delicious red clay rings around your socks when you take off your shoes. Leather. Freshly cut green soft grass in the outfield. Dusky lights. Dugout banter. Pats on the back. High fives.  I was especially flattered because it is a Leonardo's team and I don't even work there anymore, which means they still love me even though I was fired for not showing up for a shift. And I will get a new team shirt.    So, in honor of softball, here is a spontaneous little poem:  I. Now  Clink. the sun is going down and I am on my way to first (I always barely make it) its like my life, a constant race, just ahead by a toe or behind by a foot. someone else's mistake, an error, can send me home to start all over again batting fifth. I'm not afraid of you  big fat pitcher.  II. Ten  when I was in little league the boys always walked me never sent me a good one, a hard one I think I would have cried, I was such a weany they didn't want to make me cry I always half-played and sometimes faked sick so I could just watch the team. Coach Vern asked me why I always looked so mad did I think it was cute or something? and I was embarassed because I thought so and practiced looking that way. I had a crush on his son. Dad called me snake-hips and I hated my grey pants but everyonceinawhile I would lean out over the plate and hit it between the shortstop and third and get an RBI  or a sacrifice and that is how baseball was for me: a sacrifice. I'd rather be reading. I wished I was in ballet.  I did perouettes in center field and was too tall and akward and skinny for baseball, big plays, ballet, or boys.  Baseball was free and we wore orange jerseys; the Orioles. I certainly felt like a bird. I liked helping in the concession stands the most, with jeremy, I haven't seen him in years I wonder what he's like now. he liked to read too  but we never talked about it. ketchup and mustard and pickles will always be delicious whenever I eat a hotdog I will be eleven again and think of jeremy and our dusty dirty dinky diamond in the middle of a yellow sweaty pasture behind the fire station and how I used to be afraid to hit the ball.   ------------------ This isn't part of the poem because I don't like it very much and it doesn't seem to fit and the ending sucks, but I included it anyways since I just sat  here and wrote it. For your reading pleasure, if you care about the sucky way that my softball career ended.  III. Sixteen  Fear is an indulgence that went away I'm not exactly sure when I decided to kick it, run it over, stomp on it, call it "out" I was mad when I didn't make it on varsity softball. I was too good for JV all those whiny girls afraid to catch the ball. I think that was the beginning, when I was angry that fear started its retreat. Softballs are bigger and easy--there is nothing hard about it nothing hard about staring down a girl and imagining wacking the ball right into her stomach nothing complicated about being tough nothing frightening about being the tallest, skinniest, weirdest, quietest  if it is who you are but I still only half-played. It just wasn't too much fun, singing silly songs about a rooster on a fence and how we want a rally and hey number whatever JV softball was a failure too. I was afraid of the coach,  a small lesbian dyke who was so mean and tough in little league, the star, the champion, trophy-winner the ball was afraid of   her  , she played with all boys too, in highschool she was on the varsity   baseball   team. I hated her when she talked over my head like I wasn't there when she told me I need a better throwing arm--softballs are stupid--not at all like tiny compact baseballs and you have to throw them like a sissy straight over your head I threw sidearm. I was mad because I was still afraid. I was mad because I wasn't good enough.  Sometimes she would compliment me and it would make me even angrier. I played first base one game and it was horrible. I hate first base. I didn't play the next season.

         Garden Poem     A delicious curiosity, that the snow pea is  sweeter than the sweet, and these vines that have lain limp all season, in defiance of growth, rubbery mocking artifices, an afterthought, too pale and yellow for health, in need of a better guide, have sprung waist-high-- overtaken their designed stakes to look for better props, developed hardy white buds-- a species of refusal through and through.  A pea, a piece, an afterthought indestructable, yet singularly delicate how delicacy is decadent, how the pea has no time for this, how seeming is more than seems, a sturdy structure, a healthy thing.   A single pea, a piece, a part a touch, a flavor of creation's art. I pile them high into my cart, not much begrudging their meagre start though in all honesty, it still bothers me an afterthought contains so much prosperity.

       The Sweet of the Bee...     My multi-cultural education teacher wore traditional scottish garb to class today. He had a scandu(sp?) in his sock and a purse with a chain and little leather tongs on it. He is a funny mand and made jokes about how the purse hides the "tilt in the kilt," since it is worn just over the groin area. Anyhow, someone asked him if he was scottish and he said not really, that he just enjoys scottish country dancing as one of his greatest loves in the world so he bought the outfit so that he could fit in with all of the dancers since it is something that he does so often. He added that his great-great-great-great grandfather's last name was Fergusson, and then he mentioned to the class that my last name is Ferguson too. He says the Fergusson's who spell their names with two s's are regarded as "sheep-stealers" in Scotland--some sort of ancient joke which he's told to our class time and time again.   But anyways, later he and I entered a discussion about the name Ferguson and I told him how I heard it comes from "farrier's son" he told me that the Ferguson sheild, a bee on a thistle, is very famous. He told me that when people ask him about his scottish ancestry and he tells them he is a Fergusson then they always nod their head and say, "Ah, yes, the sweet of the bee."   So why am I telling you this? Because I happen to think it is particularly cool that my first name, Melissa, is greek for honey-bee, and my last name also refers to a bee. My parents had no clue about any of this, so I feel rather special that something neat has come of my name just out of coincidence (if that's what you want to call it). I feel like a whole new person with a special story behind my existence...I mean, what are the chances of THAT? I feel like I personally represent all matters concerning honey or bees or thistles.     My name, translated, is  "Honey-Bee  Sweet-of-the-Thistle." You can call me this from now on:)

       Dancing...     Saturday night led me to my brother's house for the end of the season fiesta, hosted by the himself and the mexican workers. It involved a delicious cocktail of shrimp in a tomato base with noodles and cilantro, a huge round black-bellied barbequing  machine and pork and tortillas, and chilles cooked to perfection by Gorge. Also, there was blueberry wine ala my mom and a keg.   It was supposed to be a happy event, and it was, but there were only three women there and there were only three men who were dancing and the other twenty or so fellows sat on chairs or tree stumps looking slightly melancholy as they imagined their wives and families back in Mexico. Some of them will be returning soon, and some will be staying on in the states for another year or so, traveling to other places to harvest other crops.  Martin allowed himself to drink for the first time all month and got rather drunk, at which point he revealed to me how kind I've always been to him and how much he enjoys my company, someone smart to talk to, and then he revealed how his wife in Mexico is like a stranger to him and how they were so close to getting divorced last time he went home, and how it is a source of pain in his heart that they don't really know each other any more since he travels away for such long periods of time to find work, and he is absolutely miserable and so is she, but his ten year old daughter is ranked second in her entire school and she set a record on the phone last night talking for 45 minutes to him. Martin has a degree in Biology which he earned in Mexico--a very intelligent man, and my 20-year old brother who is still in college is his boss. But Martin is a good man, and helps my brother out a lot, and loves my brother.  My brother was lively and animated, speaking wildly in spanish and gesturing with his arms and hands and making the crowd of guys erupt into laughter. I had no clue what he was saying.  Sean was operating the barbeque, my brother's best friend and a farm worker, and all he can say in spanish is "Pinche ranchero," which means "f------ farm."    When Israel asked me to dance, I threw my hands up in the air and said "why not?" even though we would be the only ones dancing and all eyes would be on us.I was wearing a knee-length silk dress that flirted out at the ends, just right for dancing. He was wearing tight jeans, boots, and a white t-shirt tucked in nicely. He had big, strong arms.   I was amazed at what that man could do. To make things clear, let me explain that while I have sort of figured out how to dance by myself, my only dancing experience with another person was in sixth grade at the gym, where we did the side to side shuffle with stiff arms.  Any other attempt has been a catastrophe. But Israel knew what he was doing, and through him, I became a dancer for the first time in my life.   Marriachi music rocks. I was spinning and flying and my feet were moving in intricate little patterns, but the funny thing was that I had no control over it. This man really knew how to move. He moved so well that he even moved me. He held me just right, firmly and gently at the same time, and held my hand in such a way that I felt liberated and free, not cramped and confined. He kept just the right amount of space between us. For once, I didn't feel like my balance was disrupted and I was going to tip over, which is how I usually feel when I try to dance with someone else. I have a history of moving to the beat of my own drum, if you know what I mean. Dancing with someone else usually finds me going one way and my partner going another. But we moved together like magic. He told me que yo apprendo muy rapido y I told him "eres un mentioso."   This man has changed my life.   By the end of the night, when I left, I had made promises to return on Sunday afternoons to play in their weekly game of futbol.  Can't wait.

      7 Things to Do When Your Life is Falling Apart, Literally...     1) Scream in your car with all the windows up so no-one can hear you. They might see you, but with any luck they will think you are only singing with feeling. This is incredibly invigorating and refreshing if done properly, trust me. If you are feeling like a pathetic and miserable victim of this cruel joke called life, it is especially helpful to scream " I WANT MY POWER BACK!" at the top of your lungs while in the privacy of your car. Doing this has two pay-offs--instead of feeling sorry for yourself you feel like a looney-toon, and you also can't help but laugh hysterically, which relieves the tension somewhat.   2) Try to put things back together again. Like my car--which seems to be where 95% of my life takes place-- which is falling apart. On my trip to Pensacola the oil light came on, even though I had topped it off before driving up there. This means that in three days I lost four quarts of oil. Ummm, I guess it really IS time to suck it up and go take her to the shop. And today a nice friend of mine replaced my battery, which had been reminding me that it was three breaths away from dead each morning when I was forced to use psychic brain power to start my car because the battery obviously wasn't going to do it. Chug chug, chug chug, chug chug, chug chug. So while the battery problem is now fixed, he noticed that my radiator hose was bulging like a ballon and is likely to blow at any moment. Just to depart the frustration and desperation that I have been experiencing lately, I want to tell you how I arrived at the auto parts store tonight about three minutes after closing. They literally locked the doors and turned off the lights as I was parking. But I would not be turned away. I banged on the doors and they came to let me in and were nice about it but then I realized that my wallet was not in my purse and I only had 33 cents so I babbled a confused apology and went back to my car, rolled up the windows, and screamed.   3) Ignore all of your problems and do something fun. This actually isn't a really helpful thing to do, but sometimes it can buy you an hour of two of relief in return for the same measure of guilt.  4) Call a friend. Then you realize that you aren't the only one whose life seems out of control. Your friends are also debating serious problems--like which club or bar to go to, which movie to see, what to do with all of their free time. If you are really lucky you will get a friend who actually does have a problem more serious than your own, and then you feel like a jerk for being so stuck inside your own small world.  5) Curl up on the couch and watch a movie while demolishing boxes of mint-chocolate chip ice cream and cheez-its.   6) Count your blessings.  7) Go to the batting cages and whack about 90 balls. The next day, your body will be so sore that you will feel deliriously relieved and relaxed.   --- Okay, so I'm obviously not in the best state of mind lately. It's just that everything is coming on so quickly, and I'm not ready for it! Each week my car is diagnosed with a new disease, something important in my house breaks, and I'm getting sleepier and sleepier. It wouldn't be so bad if I wasn't the only adult in this family--it's not easy single-handedly fulfilling the insatiable needs of a toddler while working and going to school.  I want to make something of myself, but I just can't go that extra mile when I've run around in circles all day.  I feel like a bowl of cereal that is sitting in milk slowly turning to mush. ---  On the up side, I think am going to teach Quinn's spanish class at his private school in a sort of trial lesson. Wanda, his teacher, has invited one other prospect to do a trial lesson as well, and she will decide between the two of us who will teach spanish to the kids next year. The job only requires 2 days a week, and it pays well. If I can get my schedule MWF, then it will fit perfect. I can't wait to teach--this other girl may speak better spanish than me, but I know I am more fun and probably a better teacher. Besides, where my speaking skills lapse, I can bring in mexicanos que yo conosco.  On the up up side, I know that this is just a phase, and as soon as my car is fixed I'll be my normal self again. My car is like a part of my body--when it is not well, neither am I. Unfortunately, I abuse the hell out of the machine. I would trade my left arm for a resident mechanic--someone to change my oil, to fix and putter and gage and inspect, to change air filters and replace belts and hoses, to lovingly inspect each orifice of my car and restore her, and me, to health.

        I'll have a dish of life, no teen-age please...    I think my blogs are getting boring, but at least I'm still posting. My inner artist is on vacation--lately she would rather stare gently at a wall than do anything creative. Perhaps this is because my inner artist is in repression, as I am forcing her not to feel things that she is feeling. It is, I think, a gentle form of protest on her part to refuse to write if I won't let her write about the things that matter to her.  My energy is completely sapped. I chaperoned my cousin Hanna's 15th Birthday Sleepover at Grandma's Lake house this weeekend. The WHOLE ENTIRE weekend. Only after I was there for 24 hours did I begin to wonder what I had gotten myself into. All in all it was a success, but I realize that I can only handle so much 15-year-old girl talk and I realize that I am SO glad that I am not 15 years old anymore and I don't have to sit on the phone talking to boys about absolutely nothing for three hours and I don't have to have stupid conversations like  "Jennifer Lorway is sooooo stuck on herself." "No she's not." "Well, she acts like it." "No she doesn't. She's just prettier than everyone else so everyone hates her."    or...  "What about Travis Chapman?" (Chorus) "No way, he has about a hundred extra teeth."  It's so difficult for me being around teenagers lately because it really bothers me how they think the whole world should revolve around them. I just want to hit them on the head and grow them up.  Friday night I made them lasagna for dinner, and it took forever to cook because Grandma's oven is all high-tech and weird. You have to press "bake", then "temperature", then the "up" or "down" arrow, then "time", then the "hour" and "minute" arrows, then you have to press "start." I forgot to press "start," so it took forever.  Anyways, I made the girls dinner and brought it downstairs and set the table and made a huge salad and made sure they got fed. I washed all the dishes. I did all of this with grumpy Issac having meltdowns because it was WAY past his bedtime. I received no real thanks for this, and to compound the problem, I got blamed for getting grandma's oven dirty and spent Issac's entire naptime the next day scrubbing her oven rack.  The lake is beautiful, but still, it was a difficult weekend. Altough we had fun on the lake, and in the lake breeze, most of the day was occupied either keeping Issac off of Grandma's nice furniture or keeping him from running off the edge of the dock.    You should have seen the girls when I suggested that they start cleaning up after themselves. It wasn't the girls, per se, it was just Hanna. She rolled her eyes and gave me this disgusted look, like I'm some adult ruining her life. I'm not sure she even realized that she did it, because I told her it really makes me angry when she does that since I am sacrificing time in MY life to help her out, and then she said defensively, "I didn't roll my eyes at you! geeze!" and then proceeded to roll them again and scrunch up her mouth in an even uglier, more angry glare.  To be fair, I think Hanna was just as exasperated as I was. I remember what it was like when I was fifteen, and invited a bunch of girls over--it was fun for the first 12 hours, and then we all started pissing each other off, breaking off into cliques, gossiping about each other, getting on each other's nerves. We didn't want to do this, it just happened. I remember wanting to be the center of attention at my birthday party and being upset and disappointed when I wasn't.  I was so glad to see Lynn and Windy. They came to rescue me, and brought a bottle of wine, and after Issac finally fell asleep we left him in the room next to the girls' and we walked out to the dock with a blanket and we talked and let the stars and the moon sparkle off the water and the wind wash our faces.  I was happy to learn that Issac had woken up a few times while I was gone and Hanna had to put him back to sleep for me, as though we were somehow getting closer to even in helping each other out.

        Love    Like a shroud that covers your face and confuses your reason, love is blind. Love makes obstacles seem trivial, hurdles like mere humps. Love makes you fall in love with impracticalities. Love grabs hold of your collar and throws you into impossible situations. Love beats you up and then asks you to get up and face it again. Love sings a song in your heart so that you can never be angry with it. Love blows a wind that makes you feel large. Love expands. Love moves. If you cannot move with it, you will surely be left behind.

         Ferry-man, Sing Me a Song      Somewhere in the salty city of St.Marys, Georgia, there is a tall old black man named Jerome. He has big hands, graying hair, a quick smile, and a good job. He is the deck-man for the  Cumberland Queen , making three 45-minute trips each day to the island, wearing his blue hat with the gold rope across the bridge, catching the ropes at the docks with a long metal pole, helping passengers to stow items, and returning to the mainland. He wears the same sensible sweater every day. He brings leftovers from dinner for breakfast and eats them in the engine room. He goes home between trips for lunch in his little red pick-up.   When I lugged my guitar in its big broken guitar case onto the boat, he smiled and asked if we were "going to get a concert?" and I just grinned at him. I took it in and set it on the seat in the inner cabin, and went back to the dock to get more things--when I returned it was stowed away in a safe place that I couldn't see. Jerome came in and told me so. I thanked him, softly regretting that it was gone because I did in fact want to play it. But I went and sat outside on the bow for the beginning of my adventure so that the sea-spray could mist my face, and didn't think twice about it.  Jerome unloaded my guitar for me when we reached our dock, and came to tell me so. "Child, that is a beautiful guitar," he said. "You ought to get a better case for something so nice as that."   I asked him if he plays.   "Oh, yeah," he said, nodding his head emphatically, closing his eyes as though remembering a feeling. "Was jamming out last night, as a matter of fact, with a couple of fellas downtown. 'Twas the first time in a looong time. It felt goooood. Oh yeah. " I could tell that he was back in the memory of the night before. "Yes, that is a beautiful guitar you got there. You need to take better care of it and get a good case, you know?"  "Yeah, yeah. I know." We went about the business of unloading.  Before the ferry took off I ran back to it, up the long loading dock, and up the steps. I found Jerome eating breakfast. "Hey--if you can get a ride back to the island tonight, you should come jam. We'll be up late. Campsite 11."  "Alright, alright," he said, with a big grin. He stuck out his hand. "Name's Jerome."  "Melissa," I said.  He never came for our jam-out session, which consisted of me playing the seven or eight songs that I know, the three or four songs that I only half know and can remember only half the words to, a lot of acapella by the five of us, and making up a few new songs about the island. Stephen and I made a pretty good duo as he made up ridiculous words and beat on a chair with a stick for some good back-up rythm. It was fun. I had my doubts about bringing my baby to play for the crew, since it's borderline whether I'm ready for such a thing or not. Truthfully, I brought it to play for myself, and I'm just happy that I'm not too shy to play for other people anymore.  On the return trip to the mainland, I brought the guitar on board last, and took it out of its case and started playing around. Jerome came and sat with me, and so did the young girl who runs the snack bar (she gave me some fresh grapes). Jerome sat back and listened and laughed and we goofed around together. He played my guitar and he was   good . He showed me some suspended chords and picking styles and he played Jazz and he played the blues. He started playing the guitar when he was 13, he said, after he heard the Beatles. We laughed about the Beatles and how old he was, and then we thanked God for the Beatles. And then we talked about the blues and the  strangers who have influenced us musically by bringing us out of our shells, by questioning us and by insisting that we play something for them, by listeing to us fumble around and then showing us a thing or two. And then he started talking about California where he was raised and about his kids and how they never were struck by the music bug even though he had plenty of instuments laying around the house all the time. We talked of a lot of things and we laughed.  He was  good . He played and closed his eyes and let his fingers fly back and forth and all around, quick. His fingers were long and black and he had  gold rings over two big knuckles, and he spread his fingers all over that guitar, leaning down close to the belly so he could hear over the loud engine.  And he had faith in me. He just kept leaning back and grinning, and telling me that I have discipline, and he knows it, and that if I keep practicing the day will come when my fingers will separate from my body and just start doing a dance that I can't control, and it will be beautiful. And he said "Girl, it is just a  feeling  , that's all it is. You just get that   feeling  in your soul and that comes  out  and that's all it is. Yeaaaah, man."  So, I'm writing a song about Jerome the ferry-man and the feeling that comes from deep down in your soul. The feeling that you can share with other people, the feeling that comes out in music, the feeling that, as Jerome says,  just "sets your spirit right."   Before it's all said and done, I'm going to jam out with Jerome one night when my fingers can fly, and it will be out of this world.

        Ahhhh, A Computer...    So it's only been five days since I've been to a computer, but it feels like eternity.  I've been missing my regular blogging since school has been out.   Now, I am in Pensacola at Issac's Grammy's house, and in just a few short hours I will be driving across Florida again to Jacksonville and then to St. Marys, Georgia. Why all of this insane driving in the middle of the night? Because at  8:56 am eastern time I will board a ferry and ride to a beatiful, exotic island for three days of nothing but reading, sleeping, and swimming. Did I mention that there will be a full moon? Did I mention that I will be virtually ALONE on this seventeen mile-long island with white beaches and wind-formed trees? Did I tell you that there is a band of wild horses there? And old abandoned mansions? Expect to see me in a few days, refreshed, glowing, vibrant. I will come home with the wind in my hair and sand in my toes. Nobody will have the power to upset me or make me angry. I will be a Goddess from the ocean, covered with pearls and foam. My patience will be more eternal than the waves. If someone makes me angry I will simply crash over them like a gentle wave. I will engulf obstacles.

        A Good Read...    The War Prayer  by Mark Twain  It was a time of great and exalting excitement. The country was up in arms, the war was on, in every breast burned the holy fire of patriotism; the drums were beating, the bands playing, the toy pistols popping, the bunched firecrackers hissing and sputtering; on every hand and far down the receding and fading spreads of roofs and balconies a fluttering wilderness of flags flashed in the sun; daily the young volunteers marched down the wide avenue gay and fine in their new uniforms, the proud fathers and mothers and sisters and sweethearts cheering them with voices choked with happy emotion as they swung by; nightly the packed mass meetings listened, panting, to patriot oratory which stirred the deepest deeps of their hearts and which they interrupted at briefest intervals with cyclones of applause, the tears running down their cheeks the while; in the churches the pastors preached devotion to flag and country and invoked the God of Battles, beseeching His aid in our good cause in outpouring of fervid eloquence which moved every listener.  It was indeed a glad and gracious time, and the half dozen rash spirits that ventured to disapprove of the war and cast a doubt upon its righteousness straightway got such a stern and angry warning that for their personal safety's sake they quickly shrank out of sight and offended no more in that way.  Sunday morning came-next day the battalions would leave for the front; the church was filled; the volunteers were there, their faces alight with material dreams-visions of a stern advance, the gathering momentum, the rushing charge, the flashing sabers, the flight of the foe, the tumult, the enveloping smoke, the fierce pursuit, the surrender!-then home from the war, bronzed heros, welcomed, adored, submerged in golden seas of glory! With the volunteers sat their dear ones, proud, happy, and envied by the neighbors and friends who had no sons and brothers to send forth to the field of honor, there to win for the flag or, failing, die the noblest of noble deaths. The service proceeded; a war chapter from the Old Testament was read; the first prayer was said; it was followed by an organ burst that shook the building, and with one impulse the house rose, with glowing eyes and beating hearts, and poured out that tremendous invocation -- "God the all-terrible! Thou who ordainest, Thunder thy clarion and lightning thy sword!"  Then came the "long" prayer. None could remember the like of it for passionate pleading and moving and beautiful language. The burden of its supplication was that an ever--merciful and benignant Father of us all would watch over our noble young soldiers and aid, comfort, and encourage them in their patriotic work; bless them, shield them in His mighty hand, make them strong and confident, invincible in the bloody onset; help them to crush the foe, grant to them and to their flag and country imperishable honor and glory.  An aged stranger entered and moved with slow and noiseless step up the main aisle, his eyes fixed upon the minister, his long body clothed in a robe that reached to his feet, his head bare, his white hair descending in a frothy cataract to his shoulders, his seamy face unnaturally pale, pale even to ghastliness. With all eyes following him and wondering, he made his silent way; without pausing, he ascended to the preacher's side and stood there, waiting.  With shut lids the preacher, unconscious of his presence, continued his moving prayer, and at last finished it with the words, uttered in fervent appeal, "Bless our arms, grant us the victory, O Lord our God, Father and Protector of our land and flag!"  The stranger touched his arm, motioned him to step aside -- which the startled minister did -- and took his place. During some moments he surveyed the spellbound audience with solemn eyes in which burned an uncanny light; then in a deep voice he said "I come from the Throne-bearing a message from Almighty God!" The words smote the house with a shock; if the stranger perceived it he gave no attention. "He has heard the prayer of His servant your shepherd and grant it if such shall be your desire after I, His messenger, shall have explained to you its import-that is to say, its full import. For it is like unto many of the prayers of men, in that it asks for more than he who utters it is aware of-except he pause and think.  "God's servant and yours has prayed his prayer. Has he paused and taken thought? Is it one prayer? No, it is two- one uttered, the other not. Both have reached the ear of His Who hearth all supplications, the spoken and the unspoken. Ponder this-keep it in mind. If you beseech a blessing upon yourself, beware! lest without intent you invoke a curse upon a neighbor at the same time. If you pray for the blessing of rain upon your crop which needs it, by that act you are possibly praying for a curse upon some neighbor's crop which may not need rain and can be injured by it.  "You have heard your servant's prayer-the uttered part of it. I am commissioned by God to put into words the other part of it-that part which the pastor, and also you in your hearts, fervently prayed silently. And ignorantly and unthinkingly? God grant that it was so! You heard these words: 'Grant us the victory, O Lord our God!' That is sufficient. The whole of the uttered prayer is compact into those pregnant words. Elaborations were not necessary. When you have prayed for victory you have prayed for many unmentioned results which follow victory-must follow it, cannot help but follow it. Upon the listening spirit of God the Father fell also the unspoken part of the prayer. He commandeth me to put it into words. Listen!  "O Lord our Father, our young patriots, idols of our hearts, go forth to battle-be Thou near them! With them, in spirit, we also go forth from the sweet peace of our beloved firesides to smite the foe. O Lord our God, help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreds with our shells; help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of their patriot dead; help us to drown the thunder of the guns with the shrieks of their wounded, writhing in pain; help us to lay waste their humble homes with a hurricane of fire; help us to wring the hearts of their unoffending widows with unavailing grief; help us to turn them out roofless with their little children to wander unfriended the wastes of their desolated land in rags and hunger and thirst, sports of the sun flames of summer and the icy winds of winter, broken in spirit, worn with travail, imploring Thee for the refuge of the grave and denied it-for our sakes who adore Thee, Lord, blast their hopes, blight their lives, protract their bitter pilgrimage, make heavy their steps, water their way with their tears, stain the white snow with the blood of their wounded feet! We ask it, in the spirit of love, of Him Who is the Source of Love, and Who is ever-faithful refuge and friend of all that are sore beset and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts. Amen.  (After a pause)  "Ye have prayed it; if ye still desire it, speak! The messenger of the Most High waits."  It was believed afterward that the man was a lunatic, because there was no sense in what he said.

        Already Occupied    Less than a dark night and already you’ve built a home Here in a chair that is already occupied,  reserved for a little boy already in overalls.  You are a weaver of time, perhaps? Already weaving before you’ve checked your facts, Already expecting the arch of the stick that will wipe you down.  Still, you seem surprised, like you didn’t think I’d really do it, Believing I’d have pity on an arachnid-- Your little yellow body bobs along the web in a state of panic, Bewildered disillusionment for an insect used to living in The tangled webs that we weave, Aware or unaware that mothers open car windows And overnight down sometimes leave.  And from last night...   Today is my 5th day as the program director of the un-named camp down in archer that the kids are calling the “free YMCA.”  I’m sitting here, having finished a honeybrown beer, feeling slightly better about camp. I’ve brainstormed all of these great ideas that get my mind going so fast that it can’t stop for me to go to sleep—ideas like a leadership program for the older kids where they learn mediation techniques and listen to inspirational speakers, and field trips, and publicity for our program, and a big buddy program to help out the little kids, and the list goes on and on. I want to take these kids who people pity, and turn their “free charity camp” into the coolest thing that they will remember for ever and ever. Sounds simple, huh? Too bad that  I’m practically famous for my day-dreams that almost never turn into reality. But I can do it, huh? I really want to.  Trying to institute some control down there is absolutely chaotic. I feel like a broken record—“Everybody listen up! Listen! Shhh! I need your attention! Hey hey! Sit down! NOW!” or “This is unacceptable! There is no reason for you to act like a bunch of five year olds! I know you are capable of doing what I am asking!”   The first step is to establish a sense of order. I’m not taking ANY kids on a field trip until they can exhibit to me that they are capable of behaving at camp, following directions, keeping focused for more than just a few minutes, being able to be kind to each other for a sustainable period of time.  So tomorrow I will bribe them with the prospect of field trips.

        Let the summer fun begin...    It's official. The vision is coming full-circle. On Friday, I filled out my W-4 forms and signed the loyalty oath on front of a notary--I am now among the ranks of other proud, dedicated, (and loyal) employees of the city of Archer.   That's right, I am the Recreation Director for the un-named camp of kids that congregates each morning on the hot, dry, barren field outside of the old firestation in downtown Archer.  I am the only employee.  But if there were others, I'd be the boss. I am in charge of the volunteers. I make the decisions. I decide what activities we do and how we run things. The success or failure of this program rests solely upon my shoulders.  I answer to no stupid idiots, no incompetent, unprepared, incapable ones.   No, that person is me now.  I am the one who can't get it together, who can't foresee all of the problems that will arise from my schemes, who can't decide which approach to stick with, who is constantly adjusting and readjusting the order and driving my volunteers crazy, changing my mind, running around like a chicken with my head cut off, acting incredibly inefficent and half crazy.  I thought I would like being the boss, but there is no one else to blame when things go wrong.   Which they do.

        Missing a friend...     Alan left this morning. Saying goodbye stinks.     The Quarter That You Gave to Me    The day before your leaving grew warm in my hand when we sat on the swings,  creating our own motions with our feet in the sand.  A little movement is a good remedy for the stagnant, for stationary souls resisting forward progress.  I tried to laugh out loud, twisting myself under knots and releasing the tension in the chain, letting centrifugal force push out my heart’s pain.  I rubbed George’s head clean with my thumb. My own head felt numb, and I was glad that you were talking so that I could listen and watch the quarter glisten.

         New Underwear and a Poem           Ah.... Nothing like sitting in front of the computer listening to Brown-eyed Girl on sattelite radio in your favorite t-shirt and a new pair of underwear. (Thanks mom.) I really should be working on the report that I'm supposed to be writing for the city on what happened with the camp this summer. But I don't feel like it.       Sha la la la la la la la la la la ti da la ti da     So hard to find my way, now that I'm all on my own...         I had a great night. I went to a barbeque at my mom's house, and her cool friends Stewart and Bethany were there. We laughed over dinner, sharing hillarious travel stories. Stewart and Bethany seem like they've been almost everywhere and done almost everything. The kids played in the pool.         After dinner we watched "Blue Crush," which really made me want to run out and start surfing--an impossibility because 1) it was the middle of the night 2) I don't have a surfboard 3) I live roughly 75 miles from the beach 4) my gas tank is on "E", 5) I have the ab muscles of a jar of jelly, and 6) I don't even know how to surf.       But hey, I'm an impromptu kind of girl. I'll put it on my list of things to do. It's a shame to live in Florida and not surf, even if surfing in Florida typically means chasing down a hurricane so that the waves are higher than 2 or 3 ft.    I tried surfing once a few years ago. I got up once for half a second, then lost the wave and sank. Then it started to rain hard so we went bowling instead.      Below you will find today's poem. Please remember that I'm writing these poems as a personal excercise. The forms you see here are the very first versions of the poems. Plus, I am usually forcing myself to write, so there isn't even the aid of inspiration to make them a little more interesting. The idea is that forcing myself to write, even when I really really don't want to, will somehow stretch my brain, and out of the process something workable might appear.       FYI, what really wants to come out of my mind at times like these looks more like this:         Poop        Poop poop poop   poop poopy poop poo-poo   poop poop poop poopy poop poop.         Instead, I force myself to write something slightly more intelligent, such as today's poem:           Arbeitskur        Ich bin eine arbeiter   The arbeiter who smokes two packs a day.   Grisly fingers on drink machines.   I like to look at the cold beads of sweat and imagine    how five tablespoons of sugar and some soda water    are gonna cool me off.      I like to take two aspirin every morning to ease the swell   of my arthritis, and a packet of BC powder before coming home   so that my kids don't give me a headache.

        Skate-ramps and Mysterious Acts of God    &nbsp;  Sometimes I get these surges of energy where I am absolutely unstoppable--nothing can stand in my way. If it were possible, I would see a project through completion in one day without stopping. Unfortunately, other people are required to participate in the process, and business hours operate only eight hours a day.     &nbsp;  Only three kids came to leadership training today, but it was a great meeting. We planned our field trip, we're going to have $50 left over, and we came up with a bunch of great ideas for service projects. The biggest one is that the kids want to go ahead and raise money for a half-pipe skateboard ramp--and then they want to build it. Can it be done? Sure.&nbsp; If it were up to me I'd go ahead and do it. But the city is planning on building one in the next&nbsp;three years or so, and they are going to want to decide where it goes and what it looks like and micro-manage every detail.     &nbsp;  My program is a slave to the city.&nbsp; When did this happen?&nbsp;I heard through a reliable source that the city manager is in love with the program and thinks it's the greatest thing since soapbox speeches. This is good news, but I'm afraid he's going to somehow "steal" it from me. In his attempt to get a glorified piece of the pie that I created, he might mangle the whole thing and ruin the entire recipe.     &nbsp;  Is it a&nbsp;good thing to be associated with the city or a bad thing?     &nbsp;  The only relationship that leadership training has with the city--as far as I can tell--&nbsp;is that we use the city hall to meet in on a weekly basis. But suddenly, the city officials are poking their noses into all of our business. They want me to deposit the money we earned from the car wash into a fund controlled by the city. They told me so today with suspicious and accusing looks on their faces:    &nbsp;   "Melissa, where is the money that you earned? You need to bring it down here and give it to K----- so she can put it in a city fund."     &nbsp;  " Oh, good idea. I didn't even think that you guys could do&nbsp;that for me."       &nbsp;   "So you'll bring it tomorrow?"       &nbsp;   "Yeah. It sounds like a better idea&nbsp;than keeping it in my sock drawer," I joked.        &nbsp;   Nobody laughed.       &nbsp;  Then C----, a city&nbsp;secretary whose children came to a few sessions of leadership training and participated in the car wash, started telling me what I need to do with the money we earned and how I had to take all the kids who participated in the car-wash on the field-trip. I told her that some of the kids had become disqualified because of behavior problems, but we appreciated their help (one of these kids was her son). Then she made a snooty comment that I need to get off my chest--she said "Well, some people know how to control children, and other people don't." And I told her that I am trying my best and learning more everyday, and that in a few months perhaps those kids who are disqualified could re-apply and try again, at which point she informed&nbsp;me that it would really be unfair if her kids weren't allowed to come since they worked so hard all day at the car wash. At this point I felt bad for my obvious lack of planning and procedure in this regard, and&nbsp;I told her that her son can come if she comes, and that her daughters are welcome to come, but they failed to attend today's meeting and they knew about it, which is discouraging to me, and that in the future the program will have criteria that must be met such as good attendance, yadda yadda yadda. And then I was overwhelmed by a sense of failure from a sense that I did not&nbsp;deal with her in the right way, and a larger sense of failure from my lack of planning and anticipation of&nbsp;these kinds of situations.    &nbsp;  And I became more suspicious of the city since it seems like she is a force from within the city hall building, and she was obviously displeased with me. I also happen to know that her son has a reputation for being a terror, that she has little control over him, and that she is active in the area boy scout troop. All these factors set her up to be a potential advocate for our program, or to see our program as a threat and become an active enemy. As soon as I got home I called her, but she had already left the office.    I don't mind being closely related with the city, as long as they don't interfere with what I'm doing.&nbsp; At the camp, everything I did had to be approved by the city manager first. Consequently, I was paralyzed in action, because he never approved the things that needed to be approved in order to run the camp. In the end, he sort of shut us down because we could never really get our ideas off the ground.    &nbsp;  Some benefits of being related to the city is that it might be easier to apply for non-profit, we could use some of the city's funds, and we could use the city's lawyer and insurance coverage.    &nbsp;  On the down side, they could completely undermine everything I am trying to do with all their bureacracy &*%*@#.     &nbsp;  Maybe I'm just being pessimistic. Maybe the city will be overjoyed that we want to take over&nbsp;and pay for this project. Maybe they will give me the reins&nbsp;I need and support me in all the ways I want to be supported. But for the record, I'm a tad suspicious.    What is my fear of the city? As I think about it more, it seems silly. What it&nbsp;ultimately comes down to is that I am afraid that my people skills are not as great as I think that they are. All these years, I've thought I had good people skills because I look people in the eye and people seem to like me, smile at me, and talk to me. But I am beginning to learn that people frequently smile at people they hate, talk to people they can't stand, and act like they like people they don't. When you need something from someone, people skills take on a whole new meaning. I'm afraid that these people are more powerful than me and are going to try to tell me what to do.&nbsp;I'm afraid that I might succumb to them in an attempt to be agreeable, and then I'll wake up one day to realize that the entire program is jeapordized.&nbsp;    &nbsp;  If my program becomes incorporated with the city, I'm going to have to work with them a lot more than I would like to.     &nbsp;  Heck, even if the program doesn't become incorporated with the city, I'm going to have to work with them a lot more than I would like to.    &nbsp;  Or...&nbsp;the kids and I&nbsp;could go ahead and construct a skate-ramp in the middle of the park in the cover of the night, and explain it away as a mysterious act of God.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  And now, because I promised one with every entry, a poem in the form of haiku:      &nbsp;     &nbsp;   Fear, like an oil     brightens and expands, fire     for the&nbsp;coward's soul.  &nbsp;   &nbsp;

         The Dimly Lit Darkness of her Mind      She contains a force she can't control; namely   the thoughts that swirl through her mind like colors   flashing ephemerally, vanishing   into the lower realms of her cerebrum.    &nbsp;  The thoughts that swirl through her mind like colors   wrap themselves around her spinal cortex   and&nbsp;sieze her body. She mutely protests    the paralysis but finds she enjoys surrender.&nbsp;    &nbsp;  Flashing ephemerally, vanishing   colors disappear like&nbsp;the unblinking eyes of Argos.   She is Io,   wrapped   in a disguise that suits her not,&nbsp;   the clumsy heifer running from a gad-fly.    &nbsp;  Into the lower realms of her cerebrum   she sometimes dips a spoon, shocked   at all that she&nbsp;finds, and does not find,    in the place&nbsp;of dimly lit darkness.&nbsp;

         Ode to Oil...           &nbsp;        &nbsp;    &nbsp;     Ode to Oil           &nbsp;   A viscuous virtuoso,    greasy larder! You have what it takes    to&nbsp;crisp eggplant and green tomatoes,    hush-puppies, fish, and french-fried potatoes!    Borrowing flavor, yourself being bland,    like Midas turning all that you touch into something grand!    The taste, the flavor of salt and oil!    You are a golden sea, the american dream!    Browning yourself with age like a woman in the sun!   You belong in the pan. After,    you pout   as you drip through the towel,    plump plump,    back   into   your   bottle    on the shelf.     &nbsp;    &nbsp;

         A Month of Poetry...          &nbsp;       &nbsp;       &nbsp;  Since I am trying to get into William Logan's Poetry Workshop, and since he wants to look at three of my poems, and since I am&nbsp; inspired by the prospect of studying under the "most hated man in American poetry," I will dedicate the next month to poetry entries. That's right, nothing but meter and rhyme from now until the end of August. Who cares if they are bad or meaningless?     &nbsp;  BTW, I read some of Logan's poetry yesterday, and I like him a lot. He's up there in my book with the likes of &nbsp;Charles Simic and Theodore&nbsp;Roethke. I've heard that he can tear you to pieces in an instant. A very smart man, I've heard he is. He will probably pick on me. I'm not as witty as I'd like to be.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;    Logan      &nbsp;  Exceptionalities are stars that glitter    over blankets of banalities,    yesterday's litter.    &nbsp;  I'm not as witty as I'd like to be,   I think that he might pick on me,   like a nit in a comb    &nbsp;  examining&nbsp;my undeveloped form   with his fingers.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

         A Sad Day in the Annals of Archer...           &nbsp;        &nbsp;   We decided to close down the summer camp. I feel like a failure. Because it hurts too bad to talk about it, I will put it off until tomorrow. All I have to say is that my only volunteer was moving to Costa Rica on Friday and it would be me, alone, with over 20 kids. And that yesterday I had to grab a kid who is twice my size by the collar and throw him backwards to prevent him from pummeling a ten-year old to pieces. And that he rushed the door again and I had to stop him a second time--while holding Issac in my arms. Meanwhile the different gangs were running around&nbsp;talking about busting each&nbsp;other up while Hank was scrambling to shut the doors and get everyone out. &nbsp;It was our second riot and it was&nbsp;scary. Obviously, we were not prepared to deal with  these  kinds of problems. Preparation is not one of my best qualities. I'm a much better improviser. There lies the problem.     &nbsp;   But how does  anyone  begin to know how to prepare for these kids?&nbsp; I'm realizing that the slacker sounding position of "camp director" requires volumes of skill and knowledge. I think I was underqualified. Though to be fair to myself, my hands were tied involving any planning of the camp until the day I was hired, which was four days after the camp had already begun. Not the best administrative techinque on the city's part either. I guess I shouldn't beat myself up.     &nbsp;   My boss told me to "hang on" until the end of the week and that he would get me more help on Monday. What  kind  of help?&nbsp;&nbsp;Will he&nbsp; finally  deliver the&nbsp;volunteers that I've been asking for all summer? They&nbsp;need to be trained--I need to know I can count on them. So often, the volunteers have been nothing more than a sophisticated, different group of "kids" needing my constant attention--almost more of a hindrance than a help. I told him I thought it would be negligent on his part to continue this program without the foundation of a more organized structure, more qualified staff, and better preparation. I told him the situation was simply unsafe and beyond our control at this point. He sighed and said "fine."     &nbsp;   I don't like being a quitter. I've felt sort of sick and uneasy all day.     &nbsp;   Then I watched  Spirit of the Cimarron,  which is about this wild horse with an unconquerable&nbsp;spirit who refuses to give up, and it brought me to tears.     &nbsp;   I keep wondering if I made the right choice, if I should have continued to "hang on" and "ride it out." But then I remember R--, the boy who has been getting beat up lately at camp, and the pain in his&nbsp;eyes when he shouted at me, pleading for protection: "You're a bad teacher Ms. Melissa! You need to watch what they are doing to me!" and the realization I had that I can't.&nbsp;We're simply stretched too thin.&nbsp;And we don't have a plan other than to deal with what gets thrown at us each day. We are like baby seaturtles who had this&nbsp;simple, beautiful vision to&nbsp;crawl toward the light, and on our way we were run over by trucks and pecked apart by seagulls--we did not expect it,&nbsp;but that did not prevent it from happening.     &nbsp;   I once heard that when you are faced with a difficult decision, you usually have two choices. The best choice is&nbsp;often the one that feels the most difficult. Ending this camp is so difficult. It was my personal reflection, my vision. Worst of all, I feel like I am letting the kids down and I feel like a sissy.     &nbsp;   I suppose, in a meagre attempt to&nbsp;salvage some self-esteem, &nbsp;I can eek out a small feeling of responsibility&nbsp;from ending the camp. Sometimes you just have to do the right thing and admit your irresponsibility, hard as it may be. Funny how&nbsp;admitting irresponsibility&nbsp;can be a responsible thing to do. I refuse to let something bad happen to&nbsp;a kid&nbsp;simply because I had too much pride to know&nbsp;when to admit defeat. &nbsp;   Sigh.    My other&nbsp;work with the leadership&nbsp;training continues on indefinitely.    &nbsp;    "A successful teacher needs: the education of a college president, the executive ability of a financier, the humility of a deacon, the adaptability of a chameleon, the hope of an optimist, the courage of a hero, the wisdom of a serpent, the gentleness of a dove, the patience of Job, the grace of God, and the persistence of the devil."--Anonymous        &nbsp;    "A teacher's day is half bureaucracy, half crisis, half monotony, and 1/80th epiphany. Nevermind the arithmetic."--Susan Ohanian      &nbsp;    "The things which hurt, instruct." --Benjamin Franklin      &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;

         This is just to say...          &nbsp;  I love paint. The rich, thick pigments. Stirring the paint with the paint stick. The goopy noise it makes when you pour it into the pan.&nbsp; The sloppy, uncontrollable feeling of it. The irresistable urge to get it all over me. And just for the record, there is nothing more meditiative and relaxing than listening to Mary Black and Sarah Mclachlan while painting walls.    &nbsp;  I painted the inside of my front door "indigo streamer,", a deep rich midnight blue color. It looks awesome. The only problem is that at night when I walk into the living room, I get a startling feeling that the door is standing wide open. For Issac's room &nbsp;I selected "autumn red," a deep&nbsp;rusty hue,&nbsp;and "quaking grass," a delicious sage green. I was going to combine the green with "silver blueberry," but felt like it would look to babyish. He is, after all, a growing boy who might use that room far into his middle years. Plus, I need more red in the house, and it matches the rug in the hallway and the quilt that he got for christmas last year.&nbsp; I like the idea of doing his room in&nbsp;rich forest&nbsp;colors--I've gotten a lot of ideas for decorating his room from Olympic Paint's  Natural Splendors  pallete, which includes the colors&nbsp;"mountain trail," "tree bark," "emerald forest," "hidden spring," "holly green," "shining star" and "dancing light."&nbsp; Who gets the job of naming colors, anyways? Sounds like fun.    &nbsp;  I also bought a stenciling book. I promise not to go crazy with stencils. I'm going to paint the bathroom in the hall light green with the left-over paint from Issac's room&nbsp;and stencil a border around the mirror. If I really get crafty, I want to lay tile over the linoleum in the kitchen and the bathrooms--but I heard that can be difficult to do in a trailer. You have to get some sort of leveling agent because the joints under the floor often shift and move, making the floor slightly unlevel, which will crack the tile or cause the grout to break. The leveling agent sounds cool--it's this expensive goo that you spread over the floor and then it automatically finds a level and dries. It's kind of rubbery so it will adjust with any movement of the floor in a way that is good for the tile. Weird.    &nbsp;  Issac is with my Dad this weekend, and I slept in until 9:47. Since the summer&nbsp;choir started in 13 minutes, I decided not to go, and so now I am going to go paint some more. Quinn came over last night and mowed my yard, so Issac and I can actually play outside again. Before Quinn mowed, the grass was four feet high. It's nice to take care of my house this weekend while Issac is gone.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

         It Don't Stop...          &nbsp;  Meaning me, of course. Right now, it is 1:27 am. Tonight began with a little babysitting for&nbsp;Charlie and Marcy so they could get out for a little while to celebrate Charlie's birthday.&nbsp;Afterwards, I drove to Wal-Mart, where I braved the artificially bright and obnoxious flourescent lights that seem so out of place at&nbsp;midnight. I carried around a sleeping lump of Issac as I gathered posterboard and sponges for the carwash which I have organized&nbsp;with my leadership kids from the camp. We are trying to earn money for some service projects and&nbsp;for their end of the summer fieldtrip. Right now, it's looking like it might rain all day tomorrow, so it might get cancelled  again . Makes me feel like I can't possibly get anything right, even though I know it's not my fault if it rains--I'm still taking it personally.     &nbsp;  Last night, I didn't go to bed until about 12:30 am because Mariah and Shane and I went to the Spindrifter bar to see my Dad's band, The Blues Cruisers, play. They&nbsp;were awesome as usual&nbsp;and we had a great time dancing.     &nbsp;  Tomorrow I am dropping Issac off with my Dad and Lori to spend the night, and I was looking forward to some down time by myself. But how can I say no to a karoake night on Saturday? And Saturday afternoon I've been invited to a pool party... Sunday is already filled with various church functions&nbsp;and other social commitments.    &nbsp;  &nbsp;I'm the kind of person who needs a lot of time, period. A lot of time with people, and a lot of time alone. If I don't get my alone time, I start to feel nervous and strung-out, irritated. I get snappy.    &nbsp;  I guess this is why I&nbsp;stay up into the wee hours of the morning--to get my alone time--&nbsp;although there is really no point in it. I can't concentrate or write coherently when I do. Last week I tried writing a blog about "what is love?" and it ended with an analogy about plastic-coated high-heeled hiking boots. Even  I  didn't understand it the next day, so I deleted it.    &nbsp;  So forgive me, readers, while I try to get my nocturnal schedule adjusted to give me the optimal amount of relaxing down-time blended with just the right amount of coherence and restful slumber.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

        Personality Profile...    Last year I was messing around on the computer and decided to check out eharmony--the match-making company that claims to have united over one million happy couples in successful marriages or something ridiculous like that. I wanted a free personality profile. It took about 40 minutes to answer all of their questions. I think they did a pretty good job--I agree that I am a happy optimistic person who tries to share my joy with others. What was interesting to notice about myself is that I  do  crave an audience to perform to. I think sometimes my friends might get annoyed with my antics. But mostly they love them, (I'm sure that they do). Also, it said I have the ultimate salesman personality, which is funny because I worked for a car dealership and absoultely detested it. Salespeople are weasely. I think I could make a good case for selling my beliefs, but I don't think I'll ever be able to sell a product in my life. Oh yeah, it was also funny when it said that strengths are sometimes weaknesses, and therefore it may be possible that I talk too much. Ha! Here is some more of what they said about me, if anyone else is as interested in me as I am:   By analyzing your answers to the Relationship Questionnaire we have created the following Personality Profile. Everyone has a set of subconscious wants and desires that drive their choices and attitudes. By asking you questions about a wide range of emotional issues, this report has established general patterns in your values.     Some of the following information may seem inaccurate or incomplete. Remember, that this profile is a snapshot of your personality at a specific moment. It is not intended as an in-depth analysis of your complete being, but as a tool to aid in self-discovery.       You have a strong sense of humor. You usually know when to lighten a difficult situation, amuse and entertain people.   You have a high trust level for others. Occasionally you may have trusted too much and was "stung" in the process. Your natural optimism, however, tends to pull you out of such slumps.   You have to be with people. This extends into the need to gain popularity, achieve social recognition and influence those people around you. The "bottom-line" is a strong people orientation.   You have a strong feeling of optimism, considered favorably by most people around you. Your perception is that the bottle is half-full rather than half-empty.   You may be rather emotional; that is, one will generally know how you are feeling, whether good or bad, because you let others know your moods easily.      Each person has a unique way of communicating. We use a combination of body language, facial expression, verbal tone and word choice to share ourselves with others. The following statements offer a look at the natural behavior you bring to an interpersonal relationship.       You are a natural communicator. You love to talk, offer jokes and make sure that everyone is having a good time. This trait is especially evident at functions and outings.    You show sympathy to the feelings and needs of others. Your natural empathy style may draw others to you.    One of your great strengths is your ability to communicate and talk readily. Since all strengths may be overused at times, you may sometimes talk too much.    Poised, confident, persuasive and impressive are descriptors for you. You are usually capable of speaking in a comfortable manner.    You can generate enthusiasm in yourself and in other people. Your enthusiasm, often contagious, involves many people in a social activity who might not ordinarily become involved.    You have a natural, outgoing style that some have labeled as the "natural salesperson." You are generally likable, talkative and socially assertive. Your primary intent is convincing or persuading people.      Many different factors determine the communication styles with which you are most comfortable. Some individuals thrive on the challenge of pointed criticism, while others are at their best in a nurturing environment where criticism is offered as a suggestion for improvement. Each of us has a unique set of requirements and preferences. Below is a list of communication styles that will mesh well with your own. Having a partner who understands and practices these traits is important to your long-term happiness.        Move casually, informally.    Plan interactions which support dreams and goals.    Offer opinions and ideas that are stimulating.    Share specific ideas to carry out an action.    Talk about expectations.    Be stimulating, fun-loving, and fast-moving.    Provide personal support and assurance.    Start with a personal comment to "break the ice."    Present ideas softly, nonthreateningly.    Listen sincerely.    Show sincere interest as a person.    Leave plenty of time for socializing and relating.    " In general, human beings are defined by their needs and individuals by their wants. Your emotional wants are especially important when establishing with whom you are compatible. While answering the Relationship Questionnaire you established a pattern of basic, subconscious wants. This section of the report was produced by analyzing those patterns. Our wants change as we mature and obtain our life goals. You may find it valuable to revisit this section periodically to see how your wants have changed.       You may want:     A support system to help you get things done.   An audience to perform to and entertain.   To be measured by the results obtained, not by the manner in which those results were accomplished.   Acceptance in a variety of groups.   Activities involving contact with many people.   Popularity.   A friendly, favorable social environment.   Support of your ideas and dreams.   An outlet to vent your emotions frequently.   No close supervision--you don't want people to hang over your shoulder.   Equal relations with others.   Social recognition of your accomplishments.      Must Haves:   Chemistry...   I must feel deeply in love with and attracted to my partner.  Communicator...   I must have someone who is good at talking and listening.  Sense of Humor...

Emotionally Healthy...   I must have a partner who is emotionally healthy, and able to share a stable life with someone else.  Strong Character...   I must have a partner who is honest and strong enough to do the right thing.  Kindness...   I must have a partner who is gentle and kind.  Conflict Resolver...   I must have a partner who will work to resolve rather than win arguments or conflicts within our relationship.  Loyal...   I must have someone I can count on to always support me.  Family Life...   I must have a partner who is committed to marriage, home, and family.        Can't Stands:   Depressed...   I can't stand someone who is constantly unhappy about their life.  Lying...   I can't stand someone who lies to anyone-especially to me.  Cynicism...   I can't stand someone who generally sees the world from a cynical perspective.  Anger...   I can't stand someone who can't manage their anger, who yells, or bottles it up inside.  Rude...   I can't stand someone who is belittling, impatient or hateful to people in any situation.  Materialistic...   I can't stand someone who sees material items as a measure of success.  Denial...   I can't stand someone who is unable to accept blame or see fault in their own actions.  Boorishness...   I can't stand someone who is inclined to rowdy, vulgar or disrespectful behavior when "having fun."  Sexually Obsessed...   I can't stand someone who is sexually obsessive.  Infidelity...   I can't stand someone who engages in sex outside a committed relationship.

       Saturday     A Sonnet...    Love is being true to that which you are, listening to God, and going so far as asked or commanded. So what think I if you can't hold my hand but can look in my eye? The eye is far the more immortal thing that it holds hopes and fears and even dreams, and in doing so speaks much of pleasure. No, by hands I shall not dare to measure the circumfrence of love. But don't be fooled-- my skin still craves the touch of your hand's mold.

        Another world, Another Time..     Today began as any normal day-- Issac woke me up at 6:30 and I pulled the sheets over my head for more sleep. At 8:00, it was already roughly 80 degrees and we were both miserable. I decided to relieve the drudgery by putting the expensive bike seat I bought a few months ago to good use. This time Issac was eager to get in it, and we enjoyed a nice morning ride. I rode all the way to my aunt's house and up into her yard, but started to turn away as I realized that she might still be out of town at Quinn's baseball tournament. But thirst got the best of me, so I decided to let myself in and get a glass of ice water. To my surprise, I was greeted by my two regular "babysitters"--Sam and Quinn. Sam played with Issac while Quinn taught me how to knit. He's making a red wool scarf for this winter, and I got pretty good at it and finished eight or nine rows for him. While my needles were clacking away, Quinn got all dreamy-eyed and revealed to me his money-making schemes for the next year. He is going to borrow $900 from his Dad and invest it into chicken manure. With this manure, he is going to fertilize several acres of land that he will plow with Grandad's borrowed tractor. He will then plant corn, tomatoes, eggplant, pumpkin, and sugar snap peas. He will homeschool so that he can tend his garden. He will sell the produce at road corners and at the farmer's market. He expects to earn $3,000 and then plant it again in the spring. I asked him about fallow fields and he spouted off several knowledgeable figures. I was impressed. I didn't know the farmer was so deep in his blood. For a moment, as my needles were moving rythmically and this young child was eagerly discussing the state of the fields, I felt like I was in another time. Quinn's entrepenerial visions don't end with produce, though. He watched me knit and decided that we should start knitting scarves to sell during winter! I suggested that tiny baby booties and hats would be much more economical on our part. Then Issac came over and ripped the yarn out of my lap and we struggled over who would remain in control of the needles and in the struggle he pulled out a whole row of my stitches. Typical.   Then Quinn asked "So, whatcha doin' today?"   I said "Nothing, except for worrying about how broke I am."   And Quinn said, "Good."   And I said, "Good?"   And he calculated a grin and said, "Yeah, good! Do you want to sell watermelons today and split the profits down the middle?"   So that is how I found myself in another world, another time, a place that I have been removed from for far too long. I found myself in a timeless world, jouncing in the cab of a pick-up with a comfortable baby in my lap, rocking down small, bumpy, dirt lanes, through sandy pastures bedecked with cattle and more gates than you would care to stop and open. I found myself sweating in sandy fields, up to my knees in swirling vines, with a straw hat on my head, thumping on melons, with an ache in my back from bending. Years since I've done that. It took me right back to twelve years old, sitting on a tailgate and dragging designs in the dirt with my feet as we drove to these same fields in a similar truck, the long trips to Okechobee, the incredible wealth in knowing and feeling that all the land around you that you can see belongs to an Uncle or a cousin or a grandfather, someone who will take care of it forever and ever. When the world feels like it is closing in on you, it is good to go to a piece of land that belongs to you and remember the vast opportunity that is always present--the opportunity of brush pressing fence and tree blocking sun and weed choking plant and plant making fruit. Somehow, standing in my grandfather's field, I know that I am cared for. Land ownership is a powerful thing. I felt supported by the fruits bursting forth from the ground, knowing for certain that I can never go hungry.  I busted open a tiny melon for Issac by raising it over my head and slamming it on the ground. While he stuck his chubby hands into the red fleshy meat I&nbsp;carried melons to the side of the row. Later, holding Issac in one arm and scooping up melons in the other, I followed the slow-moving truck filling up the bed. Sweat was trickling down my back and off of my forehead--under any other circumstances I might have complained of the heat, but since I don't have air-conditioning, it is actually hotter in my house. It was fun, but I couldn't do a whole day of it.   Riding on the top of the stacked bed with the wind in my face, jumping off to race Quinn to the gates, was so much fun. We unloaded the melons into a cull-bin set on top of a pallet, and then Matt lifted the pallet with the tractor and drove down the road to the gas station. I pulled out a quilt, chairs, and beach umbrellas from my car, Jen picked up Issac for a couple of hours, and I sat in the shade reading Harper's magazines for 3 glorious and restful hours. We made $43. Doesn't sound like much, but to a girl who woke up in the morning with 66 cents worth of pennies in her possession and no gas in her car, $21.50 was a miracle.   I took my little farmer boys to see a movie and we had a blast. Dinner was on Quinn. Plus, I still have 1/2 a tank of gas! What an awesome day! Thank God for Farmers.

        The hardest part of camp...    So what is the hardest part about working at this camp? Is it quickly using my judgement and investigational skills to determine which kid started it when two people start to fight? Or is it constantly "reminding" the kids to throw their trash away? Is it trying to "talk it out" with each kid who is having a problem so that they can discover a new and different way of handling their problems, while the rest of the camp falls apart and turns to chaos around me? Is it the pain of having to send a misbehaving kid home, a kid who is utterly lost and who will remain so if some adult does not soon intervene, if they do not soon consciously decide to change? Is it hearing everyone around  me telling me that it is a lost cause, to just let them go? Is it the pain of losing my volunteers one by one? Is it the frustration of finally getting camp running the way it should, only to be besieged by a new group of faces eager to test my limits and eager to start territorial battles with the kids who have already been there? Is it the racism that nobody wants to talk about?  Is it the attempt to find a happy balance of how 2 people can simultaneously entertain 15 year olds and 4 year olds in a place where each kid's only concern is to look out for themself? Is it the fear, everyday, that someone is going to get hurt? Is it the shock of how quickly these kids are willing to throw away any sense of self-control and pummel each other to pieces? Is it the discouragement from their lack of regard for the facilties and equipment that we use? Is it dealing with the abuse that I suspect is occurring in some of these kids' homes? Is it the fight between two adults that I had to break up in the parking lot one day before camp, the two adult PARENTS of these kids acting like five year olds, raising hell and arms and screaming at each other like a cockfight? Is it the blank, closed-off look I get from K-----'s eyes when I call him out and ask him why he's such a bully? Is it the sparkle and laughter I saw in the same boy's eyes when he was mixing the banana bread batter after he had rode his bike home to get 1/2 cup of sugar because I forgot to bring it? Is it the pain of not being able to reach those who most desperately want to be reached?   Most of these kids have blatant disregard for the facility that we use, for our equipment, for our games. It exists, they think, simply for the fun of destroying it. And I see their point. Why bother to care about something else when nobody really seems to care about you?  I began the summer with an enduring patience that I thought would never reach its end. But after just one month, I have reached my limit. We are grossly under-staffed, the city manager is not giving us the necessary supports, and the program and vision I held is turning to pieces.   I am trying not to take it personally. I suppose I've learned a great deal already-- Don't necessarily trust your supervisor to support you, find ways to work around him if necessary. Be so assertive about what you need that they won't be able to ignore you--the entire program is at stake.  Make demands. Don't leave until they are met.   The entire point of this camp was to not turn kids away. The kids with the most problems are the kids who need the most help, the kids who need to be there, the kids who are the most hungry for adult contact. But I'm realizing that it is just not possible, especially with only two volunteers, to adopt this kind of a philosophy. Who the hell did I think I was? Some kind of redeeming superwoman who could handle it all? I had a fit and sent half the camp home today after a semi-fight broke out. I banned the pool table for a week after the kids were playing wild handball on the table and sparring with the pool sticks and arguing incessantly about whose turn it was. I sent one of my favorite problem kids, K-----, home for the rest of the summer. I think half of my heart broke at his sheer stubbornness and refusal to leave. For whatever reason, he did not want to go.  Only one kid came to leadership training today, so I called and canceled the guest speaker. Part of me wanted to be angry with my kids, and the other half just felt like laying down and crying. But I am an adult, so I did neither.  I guess part of the camp melt-down occured because I let up on my highly structured approach, where every minute of the day was accounted for. There were several reasons for abandoning this approach--1) More teenagers were coming than younger kids, and teenagers refuse to do things like "gardening" and  "singing" or "kickball" or "fruity games."   2)We lost a volunteer, so we could no longer maintain the group rotation. Plus, none of the kids were really listening to the volunteers, I'm the only one they seem to listen to, so it was kind of not working well anyways. 3)The kids were doing well at "free-play," and it took fifteen minutes to herd each group into the forced activities that they dreaded, so I decided to give their idea a chance.  Big mistake.  I love these kids, despite it all, I just wish I could deal with one of them at a time. At the moment, I feel like an ocean ship being overrun by a gigantic herd of rats.

        Crossroads    Unclasping bracelets and slipping off rings, nothing could occupy more careful importance-- no quarrel, no eye, no feelings, no footsteps-- she is the mute, the statue, the stone, shocking in her coldness.  And footsteps? What footsteps? That which is in her chest, trying to escape her skin, blurs all vision and mutes all sound. She turns, hopeful, but he is already gone, a ghost, a glimmer, a flickering pale reflection.

      I'm not Superstitious but I Do Get Suspicious...   of Archer city hall, that is. Sometimes it feels good to get proven right, even if it means that the really nasty thing you thought was happening was really happening. It feels good, while simultaneously feeling bad,  because it proves that you are not crazy. And the verdict is....(drum roll)... that I am  not  crazy. I knew those %&^$#s were out to get me. Last Friday, the city tried to hold my paycheck until I put the money from my Leadership Training kids' car wash into the general city account. I told them no way! Are they nuts? This money doesn't belong to them! It belongs to my kids and my program! What are they thinking?  When I told them that Leadership Training Program thanks the city for being supportive, but is not officially affiliated with the city in any way, they tried to scare me by saying that if that was the case then I was going to have to pay back-rent for using the meeting room. And, once again, I told them no! Then they shuffled me into a meeting to see the manager, who I  thought  I was friends with, and I told him no too! Then he reminded me to just make sure that I keep receipts for everything (duh) and account for every dime (duh) because I could get into a lot of trouble over poor money managment (duh). Then he gave me the check and winked at me.  The ladies at the office were super nice to me today, and tried to pretend like they were never minions in a city-inspired attempt to snatch up control of my program.  I will never understand politics.  What I do understand is that somehow, close observation of Issac gave me the courage to stand up and say "NO," while firmly believeing that nobody could stop me from doing what I wanted.  This one goes out to all the two-year olds!

        1)Mini-epiphany.  I just figured out how blogger is able to provide this service for free. They get free advertising on the banners. The amazing thing is that they are able to identify what you are writing about and base the advertisement on that. For instance, if I write about God, there is sure to be some Godly advertisement. And if I write about cowboys, there is sure to be some dude ranch advertisement. But what on earth led to the "'Hey, I'm with Stupid' and other hillarious T-shirts Store" advertisement on my banner yesterday?         2) First comment posted!  Yesterday someone posted the very first comment on my lonely little blog. Thanks Patrick! The rest of you don't need to be shy. I want to know who all three of my readers are and what they're thinking.         3)Poem           Lies of a Confessional Poet            In June you forsook (insert city) in favor of me   and we strolled through the fields picking blackberries.   The dark juices stained our fingers purple.      Purple fingers on piano keys made   purple fingered melodies,    then, those same purple fingers fell    over our sun-pinkened bodies.      There was no lost religion,   but a new and stronger vision   of love, and only lovers.        The green vein of misunderstanding,   of different time and different place, the lines,   the map on the wall meant nothing.

         Multiple Thoughts...        1)  General Education Classes are Stupid.  Why do I have to take so many Gen-Ed classes at the university in order to get my degree? If I am smart enough to gain admission to the university in the first place, then shouldn't they assume that I already have a decent, well-rounded education in areas other than my major? There  was  a math and science section on the SATs and ACTs, you know. They  did  teach us this stuff in highschool, and they did a better job than you guys. I already know how to do all the math and science that I'll ever care to do, and some of the classes they offer to fill these Gen-Ed requirements are so stupid that I think they are actually taking away from my intelligence. For example,  Man's Food,  the course I am currently enrolled in, has taught me only that Dr. Marshall's frequent karaoke debacles are offensive to my ears. The other things, like the fact that spinach contains oxalic acid which prevents the absorption of calcium, will soon be forgotten after the test on Friday. What really bothers me is that I could have taken about six or seven more English classes if I wasn't required to take these useless physics and biology requirements.      2)  Grammar Mistakes  in the aformentioned class are killing me! If I take anything of value with me from this tedious class it will be the realization that there  is  a need for English majors because some people really have no clue what they're doing. For example, the lecture notes read "Too types of diseases," and "A List of Parasite's." Disgusting.      3)  Funny English Snobbery.  I found this tirade on my daily definition email from dictionary.com. The following is H. L. Mencken's description of President Harding's tiresome and banal use of language-- reminding us that not only grammar, but style, can also be atrocious.        "He writes the worst English that I have ever encountered. It reminds me of a string of wet sponges; it reminds me of tattered washing on the line; it reminds me of stale bean soup, of college yells, of dogs barking idiotically through endless nights. It is so bad that a sort of grandeur creeps into it. It drags itself out of the dark abysm of pish, and crawls insanely up the topmost pinnacle of posh. It is rumble and bumble. It is flap and doodle. It is balder and dash."        The string of wet sponges is my favorite part.      4)  Successful, Fun Field-Trip.  I'm proud to report that the field-trip was a smashing success. The morning started out a little doubtful, as we had a mild fight between emerging friends and some early attitude outbreaks. On the way to the park, this weird woman rolled down her window and started talking to us. She said "Well, you wanna hear some music or what?" and we were all stumped trying to figure out what she was talking about, half-afraid that she was going to start pumping up her bass and blasting us with some crazy old-lady music. It didn't help that there was a big truck to our other side, so we could barely hear her. We looked confused, I'm sure, so she said it again a few times and then gestured to the mini-van in front of her, which had about eight giant antennae all over the roof, including one that was square-shaped. Normally, we would not have thought that this was too unusual or even that funny, but the fact that this woman went entirely out of her way to point this out, confusing us in the process, was especially hysterical. We laughed about it for a couple miles, and W---'s imitation of the looks on our faces was great. M---- even laughed, and he was trying to pretend being mad at me, so that was good.    Once we got to the park, it was so humid that none of us felt like moving. The kids were supposed to play for a few hours before the pool opened, but it was too hot so they sat around and complained about how hungry they were.   Then they discovered the merry-go-round thing and forgot all about the heat as they tried to spin it so fast that they made everyone sick, which they achieved. So then the kids all sat around feeling like they were going to puke, and weren't even that hungry when the pizza arrived. I forgot to bring plates, so we ate it off of the tops of the boxes.      Once we got to the pool, it took everything I had to keep the kids in line and keep them from rushing the door like a group of wild animals. After convincing them that we really would get inside faster if they lined up, and that the rest of the public would stop butting them once they formed an intelligible line, I payed and we were in. I taught two teenage kids how to swim (they did great) and we all had a blast in the pool. It was the most smiles I've seen all summer. No one wanted to leave. They were sharing the goggles, they were laughing with each other. It was great. Kid checks every fifteen minutes, no lost kids, no fights. A success.      5)  Archer Baptist Church.  Because the kids have been heckling me to come with them to their church, and because they were having a free chicken dinner, and because it's the church that most of my distant southern relatives attend, and because it's less than five minutes from my house, and because I was curious, I went to the Archer Baptist Church last night, ate dinner, and attended prayer meeting and Bible study. I could write for an entire hour on the experience, but I will condense it. I have to admit, I thought it was funny that one of the concerns on the prayer list was to keep the Bush administration in the White House. Not because it's funny that a conservative church would pray for an administration that is pro-life (that's to be expected), but for the fact that that's not what the prayer was for. The prayer was specifically for  Bush . It struck me as odd, as though it precluded the conception that another pro-lifer could be a better candidate than Bush. I didn't realize churches prayed over such things. My prayers are generally more broad in scope, and less specific. Also the fact that I am NOT voting for Bush, and that there are probably equal numbers of churches praying for some other providential presidential candidate, was kind of ironic, and I had to supress giggles. I think the air coming out of my nose was enough to give myself away.      The second weird thing that happened is this very well-dressed, shiny-shoed, clean-cut guy with OZZY tatooed across his knuckles was hitting on me throughout dinner and the bible study. I don't like to prematurely judge people, but there is a gut-feeling that this guy is not someone I want to get to know as more than an aquaintance. Apparently, he didn't have the same gut-feeling as I did. To his credit, he did share his favorite bible verses with me, which was a nice gesture. But still. Why can't some people read other people's cues? I was giving him all the signs that I was listening only because I wanted to be polite, but I wasn't really that interested in what he was saying. He followed me around the whole night. I was somewhat greatful for his company, because he was really nice, but there is always a discomfort when you know that someone is seeing you in a way that you don't want to be seen. I still haven't discovered a graceful way out of such situations, short of saying "look! the building's on fire!" and running away, or some other lame excuse. I suppose I would like to hear more about his religious story, since I love to hear people's stories. Really, the main aversion I have to him is that he obviously really likes me and this makes me uncomfortable since the feeling is not returned. Sometimes it is hard to be a nice person, because things like this happen to you. One day he will ask me for my phone number and I will have to say, "Oh, hold on, I forgot my purse inside," and then run away. It makes me feel so dishonest, but what else are you going to do? Say, "look, it's obvious that you are very interested in me, but it's not really returned in the same way. So I think it's best that we don't exchange phone numbers, and just see each other as friends around the church." Or say, "Ummmm. No." I don't know. I'm afraid of what is going to pop out of my mouth.      6)  Shut-In.  I went to visit my great-grandmother before our field-trip. She keeps the little cartons of milk that they send her from her meals-on-wheels deal in her freezer for me and Issac, and we were out of milk at home, so I went to grab a few before we left. It was still early in the morning, and she was asleep on her bed in the livingroom. The lights were off, but there was enough morning light to see. I watched her sleeping peacefully for a few moments. She is so beatiful at 95 years. I love going to my great-grandmama's house. When you open the heavy screen breezeway door, you instantly smell plants and the fresh smell of soil and water in tin cans in her greenhouse and the smell of newspapers that she never throws away, the smell of her laundry and her polyester pants and houndstooth jackets hanging on the inside line. That house is so old, and hasn't changed a lick since 1930 except for the kitchen appliances which were redone in the sixties. The knob on the door to the house is the old kind, real heavy metal that rotates loose in its carriage, soft and smooth and polished with touch. It is never locked.       I decided not to wake her up, even though she gets mad when I don't. As I left the house, with my hand on that doorknob, pulling the door shut behind me, I noticed grandaddy's white cowboy hat was still on its peg, as though he had taken it off the night before upon entering the house.      That morning, I didn't realize that later in the same evening I would meet the pastor who presided over grandaddy's funeral last year, and that I would see grandmama's name on the prayer list under "shut-ins."

            Arbeitskur        II         The toil never ends; tanning-beds and nail salons   finishing school and Senior proms--   make-up and magazines,   breast-implants and cold-cremes!      One day, I'm gonna flip-out. Like, totally lose it!   With a flip of my cell-phone I will call all the men of this world   and tell them to take these god-damned tweezers and shove them up their ass!   I'll take a picture of my razor-burn and fax it to the fucking president! Hey mister!   Why don't you form a Committee on the Principle Abuses Women Suffer Due to Computer Imaging in the 21st Century?      Not that I'd want to be any less beautiful.    But what if mascara causes breast cancer?   Huh? The committee doesn't know?    That's not good enough! I want an answer!

         I've Got Non-Profit Written All Over My Face           I'm going to become a corporation. I will soon be granted eternal life and a never dying body--I can taste it already. (Insert maniacal laugh).  In one of my unstoppable "steamroller" moments I decided not to succumb to the pathetic bureaucracy of the city-- deciding instead, to create my own-- as I become the Executive Director and Board of  Leadership Training Programs, USA. (I know, I know, the name stinks but it's explanatory and I haven't thought of anything better yet. I'm at an all-time poetic low).       I've wrote three articles and 10 sections of the by-laws tonight, and I am feeling goo-ooood.      Much better than I did last week, yesterday, and today. You see, I've been walking around with this nasty taste of bitterness in my soul. I didn't know exactly where it came from, and it was really bothering me. I felt like a gigantic rubber-band stretched far and ready to snap at any moment. I was upset with my leadership abilities, and couldn't distract myself from that upset. Even reading Tolstoy with a giant spoon and a box of chocolate ice-cream couldn't quell my distaste or release me from my turmoil. Like a monkey on my back, these thoughts just wouldn't leave me alone:       "You're a  failure . One big walking, talking  disappointment . You couldn't even stick it out for eight full weeks of summer camp, and you call yourself a  teacher ?"          "You suck. Ha ha ha! Nanny nanny boo boo!"        "You couldn't doooooooo it. You couldn't dooooooooo it."          "You should just give up and quit. What are you even trying for? It's no use. You'll never be a successful teacher. You thought you had what it takes but then you  woke up ! Ha ha ha ha ha ha !"         Continuing my work with some of the kids this summer through the leadership training program (LTP) made it especially difficult to confront these voices, because even LTP is a stressful, huge, pain in my @$$. I'm never thoroughly enough prepared, the kids are fighting amongst themselves, I feel like it's taking all of my energy to push these kids along, and I'm so poorly organized that I sometimes wonder if I'm doing more harm than good. I kind of haphazardly threw LTP together with a huge vision, but forgot to check in about all the little details. And I'm not just talking about details like planning our field trip, or the car wash, but details like who gets to participate and what I expect from them and membership requirements and procedure for throwing someone out of the program. I'm such a softie that I need to have these guidelines in place, or else I will let the kids plea with me and sway me off-course from my original intentions.      Anyways, I spent the majority of last week feeling like a failure and trying to tame the voices in my head and heart and soul. It was like David and Goliath--all those huge, looming voices berating me and this one little quite voice that squeaked (rather unconvincingly):       "You can do it. You can do it. Believe in yourself."         Big breath.....hold it...... AND EXHALE.  I decided to believe in myself. I never took my money to those creeps at city hall--I kept it in my sock drawer-- and it's going to be just as safe in my possession. The city is not in charge of me or this program. I can make it on my own without them.      I decided to apply for non-profit status so that by being incorporated, I can't get sued so easily. Also, incorporation as a non-profit will allow the program to apply for several  really  awesome grants that seem specifically tailored for programs like LTP.  When I came home from LTP, I sat down and wrote a vision statement, mission statement, and by-laws for the program. It was something I should have done a long time ago--now I have a detailed and specific modus operandi for every forseeable event or process that should occur. I've been in contact with several agencies about purchasing a leadership training curriculum for the kids, and I had an email in my inbox from an retailer of a reputable product who says he thinks it's great what I'm doing and he might be able to somehow get some charitable donations and free supplies for us. Plus, his going rates are better than all the others ($150/kit instead of $245). I decided that I need to participate in an adult leadership training seminar. Also, I got notice from my mom's friend saying that Micanopy had similar problems with their free summer camp and had to shut down early too, and as a result a committee has been formed to address the issues of such camps and would I participate?        I am finally able to breath again. The bitterness in my soul is gone.      When I was working at the camp this summer, I often told people that I wasn't sure if I loved it or if I hated it. I think teaching is going to be the same way--but I also think that there is a possibility as I gain experience that I will be able to turn a corner and say that I love it. What it comes down to is that I hate failure, and love success.      Don't get me wrong. There is still a great deal of anxiety associated with my job. On Wednesday I'm taking three chaperones and 13 unruly kids to the public pool for a fieldtrip. Yikes. So many disasters could strike, it makes my stomach flop.      I also think that some of the stress comes from the beef-up-your-resume factor.  To get a job teaching English in this city, you have to be pretty competitive.  I recognize that I have done nothing extraordinary yet and want to get hired within the next two years--so LTP is a way to gain recognition in my field. Not that that is the reason I started it--but it is one more  very  compelling reason not to @^&$  it up.          "The tragedy of life doesn't lie in not reaching your goal. The tragedy lies in having no goal to reach."  Benjamin Mays
