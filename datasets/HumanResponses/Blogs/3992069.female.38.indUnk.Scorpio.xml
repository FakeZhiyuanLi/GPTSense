						   So yesterday, did I do anything constructive? No. I read a book,  Odd Thomas   by Dean Koontz, played games on Pogo.com, watched tv, watched the Butterfly Effect and oh yes exercised for about 15 minutes. It sounds like a lot doesn't it? But do you notice I didn't actually get anything real done. I didn't even go for a walk, although I kept telling myself I needed to. Oh well.  Today I went to work from 1000 to 1730. It was easy money, not really busy. I read my magazine from start to finish. But I feel as if summer's passing and I'm not really doing anything REAL. I have a lot of goals, but I don't seem to be getting anywhere with them.  Goals: 1. lose weight 2. get rid of scars and moles 3. whiten teeth 4. start and stick with an exercise program&nbsp;5.&nbsp;do some volunteer work 6. organize my house 7. straighten out my finances- and streamline them 8.&nbsp;rebuild my spirituality 9. meet more&nbsp;people&nbsp;to do something with 10. meet someone&nbsp;romanticly.  Are those self centered goals or what. They aren't in&nbsp;any real order but its interesting that they came to my mind in that order huh? I really do want to do some volunteer work but why didn't it&nbsp;show up until&nbsp;#5 and spirituality&nbsp;isn't until #8. Hmm, maybe that's the problem. Man, they make me sound like I'm really a mess don't they. That's probably one reason I haven't done much- denial is a powerful&nbsp;and lovely thing.  I've only made half-hearted progress in&nbsp;4 or 5&nbsp;of them. I started on a&nbsp;different way of eating- the word diet makes me cringe. But&nbsp;it evidently wasn't the right way because in 5 weeks I lost exactly 1 lb. I started&nbsp;walking but I've hurt my heel and any time I walk more than a few minutes I'm in agony. I even joined an exericse class at the YMCA but that's where I actually hurt my heel so I went to one class and didn't return. I started whitening my teeth but the over the counter remedies seem to be slow- of course I keep forgetting to&nbsp;actually use them. I started to organize my house but&nbsp;&nbsp;its such a big job that I didn't know where to start. Ditto for the finances.  I think the only thing I really excel at is excuses. I'm a champion at&nbsp;those. What I need is someone to give me a kick&nbsp;in the&nbsp;ass.&nbsp;So maybe I need to work harder on #9&nbsp;to meet people who will give me that kick. LOL. God knows I need something. Of course I started this summer in a haze of depression- failing will do that and I'm slowly digging myself out. It doesn't hurt so much now.  Hey if anyone has ANY ideas, please speak up.   My soon to be niece in law just called me and asked me to take care of her 5 year old tommorrow. Don't get me wrong, I love Halla and don't mind watching&nbsp;her, but&nbsp;she absolutely wears me out. Plus I was going to attack the computer room and&nbsp;try to begin organizing it and having her here will limit me. Oh well, maybe we'll go swimming in the afternoon. I told Kendra to pack her&nbsp;swim suit just in case.  It's scary that my nephew is marrying&nbsp;into a ready made family. Kendra has 3 kids,&nbsp;all under the age of&nbsp;8. Its a second marriage for both of them. Both of them had lousy first marriages so I hope this turns out better. Their wedding is next Saturday, July 31. I'm making my turtle cheese cakes for the reception.&nbsp;If I can find the recipe.  Its 10 pm now, and about time to go to bed. Tommorrow sounds like a very long&nbsp;day.

						   Well, this is the year I turn 39. I always thought of 39 as the last fling year before you turn OLD. Of course, now that I'm here,&nbsp;I know that 40 can't possibly be old. But the date looming up did give me the impetus to "change my life" or at least try to. I decided to go back to school. I found out two things in going to school. One: that I pay attention more and work harder than when I was 18. Two: I've lost a lot of memory cells- probably WHEN I was 18. School was interesting, it stretched my mind and helped me to&nbsp;problem solve better. But I just wasn't cut out to do something that I should have done 20 years ago. I went back for physical therapist assistant. Surprisingly I wasn't the oldest or the worst in my class. The school work was not exactly easy but I got A's and B's ( with LOTS of work). However the clinic part was something else. I think I've become single minded and less flexible. I just couldn't keep all the steps of everything in my head. If the steps had been exactly the same every time, it wouldn't have been difficult. This was not a cut and dried profession, however. So.......I failed. I mean that literally. Passed the classes, failed the clinic, out of the program. Oh well. So&nbsp;I failed my mid life&nbsp;change. Well not exactly, I mean I have lots of other ways in which I need to change my life. LOTS! The whole situation did make me change my job- I think for the better, so one good thing came out of it. But on with the crisis!&nbsp;
