      Ok, this was a good holiday, and despite of the city been almost a "ghost city", I had fun, and a few things happened and I'm still in shock!  But anyway, I found another diamond:   Something Good from The Sund of Music   Perhaps I had a wicked childhood Perhaps I had a miserable youth But somwhere in my wicked, miserable past There must have been a moment of truth  For here you are, standing there, loving me Whether or not you should So somewhere in my youth or childhood I must have done something good  Nothing comes from nothing Nothing ever could So somewhere in my youth or childhood I must have done something good  For here you are, standing there, loving me Whether or not you should  So somewhere in my youth or childhood I must have done something good  Nothing comes from nothing Nothing ever could  So somewhere in my youth Or childhood I must have done something . . .

      This is a very beautiful song!  Check it out!   Nature Boy    There was a boy A very strange Enchanted boy They say he wandered Very far, very far Over land and sea A little shy and sad of eye But very wise was he  And then one day One magic day He passed my way While we spoke Of many things Fools and kings This he said to me "The greatest thing You'll ever learn Is just to love and Be loved in return"

      Ok, I know people usually make new year's resolution but I decided to make a Birthday resolution!!!!!!!!I DECIDED TO SUCK IT UP AND FROM NOW ON I'M GONE BE REALLY REALLY HAPPY!!!!!!!!! Yes, no more winning around, chasing after those losers, wondering what the hell I did wrong.... Cause I didn't.  I'm way too good for this, I'm smart, pretty, sexy and successfully women. I have my priorities, and a whole life ahead..So I'm done with these games, it's waste of my time and a waste of energy, it's just not worth it. I'm tired of being such a pain in the ass, always complaining, and felling down and bringing people down with all this crap. I'm moving on!

      Ok, it seems pretty silly, but this is my fist time doing this sort of things... I don't even know hoe this works, but I'll get it eventually. The whole idea here is just to let myself free, say what's on my mind, no concerns... You see, life is so full of crap. We have so much in our mind that we end up losing ourselves in all kinds of things like work, money, school, and this things became our whole life. There's so much more out there... I mean we forgot about what really makes us human. We are all to busy to enjoy the simples things like the rainbow, or the flower, of the smell of rain... The ocean breeze when we are in our cars driving, our favorite song playing on the radio, our friends smiling when we arrive, dancing....   Just live, and enjoy life. I not saying to forget about work and all, but make sometime for pleasure too, it won't hurt, and I'm sure everything will work out just fine!
