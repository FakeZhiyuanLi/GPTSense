      As I prepare for the move of a lifetime, I can't help but wonder what life experiences and past decisions have led me to this particular moment and chapter of my life.  If we are nothing but a culmination of our past experiences, then how are we to reshape our future.  Over the past six months, I've been on an existential journey trying to find and add meaning to a somewhat benign existence.....the conclusion that I've come to.....the meaning of life is just that....TO LIVE.

      Somebody put an end to the madness...this boy needs to stop!!!!!  OK, so here's the deal...I seem to be going through a nesting phase in my life....I can't enter a mall, or gorcery store without buying something for a home or apartment.  Bowls, cutting boards, knives, plates and even a garlic press....you name it, I've bought it!!!!!  Someone please stop me before I buy a food processor and start saying demonic phrases like "And that's a good thing".  Next think you know it'll be insider trading and a four month stay in a women's minimum security prison.  Things have been relatively uneventful here over the past few days.....Last friday, I attended a Jack and Jill for my cousin....Saturday I went out for coffee with Steph and went shopping....and Sunday, I spent some much needed time with my bed!!!!!   Conclusion.....I really need to get a hobby....or a JOB (yeah right.....like that's going to happen)

      Forgive me Blogger, for I have sinned....It has been 4 weeks since my last blog entry.  OK, so...for those of you that know me well, my lack of blog entries will come as no surprise (I'm not exactly the most dedicated person when it comes to things like this).  HOWEVER, I have made a conscious decision to be more faithful to the wonderful world of blogging.  So, here's the update on what's been happening in my life over the past month:  1. A trip to Ottawa for a family reunion of sorts......the trip there wasn't that great, but the party did involve Karaoke and        Dancing!!!!  2. 3 fun filled days and 2 exciting nights at Sibbald's Point Provincial Park.... bugs (YUCK)....nature walk (exhausting).....almost tipping over a tent trailor (funny).......a 6 year old cousin (priceless)  3.  IKEA......3 trips in the past 4 weeks (I think I should join a support group)  4. Suit shopping for a wedding with all you can eat ribs to follow (I'm still the champ!!!!)  5.  Packing (I know its a little early, but as many of you know, I can be a bit ANAL sometimes)  That's basically my month in a nutshell......I'm counting down the days to Vancouver, and I'm putting in my time until our departure date arrives.  To conclude, I'll leave you with these words of wisdom  CUCUMBERS ARE EVIL....THIS IS NO JOKE
