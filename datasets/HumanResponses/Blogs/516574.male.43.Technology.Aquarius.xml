      I actually concocted this idea for myself to do (despite still battling the Migraine from Heck That Wouldn't Go Away for the last couple of days), but then I thought:  Why not try to start a meme with it, instead?

So here is  urlLink your mission (should you decide to accept it) :  Write a blog post including all of the following 20 words [extra credit if it makes any form of narrative and/or logical sense (and for these porpoises, 'dream logic' counts as a form of logic...)]:  ruble, Gus, braces, singly, potty, metaphysical, airs, poaching, estuaries, Burlington, levy, sandwiches, inquest, recruited, dragon, ivory, Coleman, sore, meter, commissioners  Please leave me a comment if you decide to take a stab at this -- I'd be interested in what yawl come up with...

        If you had your choice between this and that, what would you do?     1. Skipping and Running  Since the  urlLink fibromyalgia  took over, I can't say I've missed running (which I think I haven't really done since a touch football game in 1981), but now that I've thought about it, I *do* rather miss skipping...   2. Coke or Pepsi  I spent the first 29-or-so years of my life drinking Pepsi, but I'd have to say I've fully converted to Coke over the last 15 years of marriage...   3. Rock or Hip Hop  Rock, easily -- for me, at least 98% of all rap (or products containing rap, such as hip hop, etc.) is crap... [see also  urlLink Sturgeon's Law ]   4. Laptop or Desktop  I've not had much experience with laptops, but I can't see where I'd be much into them (of course, I am fully prepared to eat those words if and when I ever decide to enter the current millennium and  get  one...)   5. Cold Weather or Hot Weather  Hot weather -- I have not been referred to as " urlLink a cold-hearted snake " *entirely* without reason...   6. Swimming or Bicycling  Since I never learned how to swim, this answer seems relatively obvious...   7. Chocolate or Vanilla  ...gee,  everything  has to be one or the other? Milk, ice cream, power drinks...? (sigh) Fine, then -- chocolate (under protest)...   8. Day or Night  Night -- what *is* that  urlLink mass of incandescent gas  in the sky?...   9. Looks or Brains  For me or in a partner or both? Well, in the spirit of #7, I'll say brains for both, but it's another awfully wobbly decision that could fall the other way in the morrow...   10. Cable, DSL, or Dial-Up  Never had DSL (unless it's at work, which I  urlLink know nothing  about), so between cable and dial-up... well, I'd like to know who picks dial-up, so I know who to keep a safe distance from...

      My wife J has been talking about getting a puppy since at least when our (then 6) cats were all confirmed as carrying the antibodies for FIP (Feline Infectious Peritonitus) and (mistakenly) all given six months to live. It's been about 18 months now (if memory serves me correctly), and while we did lose 2, the remaining 4 cats have all been doing pretty good, all things considered: Climate is okay for a 15-year-old, Smokie for an overweight 5-year-old with asthma and a heart murmur, Cutesie for a mildly 'autistic' 2-year-old... and then there's Angel, a 5-year-old who was certainly the runt of his litter to start with, and is currently the only one of the 4 who shows any obvious signs of FIP whatever (mostly cloudiness in the eyes, although he still runs and jumps at 80% or more of his original capacity).  Anyhoo, since one of the two we lost was Cutesie's primary playmate, our discussions about puppies had tended to center around finding her a suitable 'replacement', along the lines of a dachshund or such.  Fast forward to last Thursday afternoon.  I come home from work to find J has brought home from the pound -- not a puppy, and not a dachshund, but a 3-year-old collie-beagle mix named Daisy.  Now Daisy is *extremely* well-behaved (her previous foster home was apparently a mix of cats and dogs, so she's used to that), and shows some evidence of having some obedience training: she understands some basic standard commands when on a leash, and is fairly well house-trained.  But you know there's adjustments ongoing.  The only one of our cats who's hissed at Daisy has been Cutesie (which was surprising, since Angel has always been the most ill-mannered of the lot -- actually, Angel is the only cat currently brave enough to stand nose-to-nose with Daisy) -- well, that's not counting the only near-dustup to date, when Daisy and Angel lunged for the same food bowl at the exact same instant, but that confrontation lasted about 1.5 seconds and, in the playground vernacular: "No blood, no harm, no foul." So now we're trying to re-educate the cats into eating and drinking from dishes on top of the kitchen table out of Daisy's reach (which, as one might imagine, is currently going over like an osmium dirigible...)  Nonetheless, we signed the papers for Daisy a couple of hours ago, so she's family now. So if I seem a bit more discombobulated than usual for a while, well, as that country song put it: "That's my story and I'm stickin' to it..."

      [ this dangerous (well, fer that Lil Ole Married Man *me*, anyhoo) memeage found via  urlLink mikerzz  (yeah, that's right -- so it's all *his* fault [place grin here]...) ]   INSTRUCTIONS:   You have seven days of dream-dates (all of which, of course, end in mind-blowing sex, hence the title of the game). You are allowed to choose one celebrity date for each night of the week and one alternate for each night, in case your first choice dream date is, say, arrested or is away on location. The remainder of the rules are as follows:    1) The definition of "celebrity" varies according to the group with whom you're playing. Basically, everyone in the group needs to be able to pick your choices out of a police line-up.  2) No time-traveling. [You might] like to date Paul Newman, circa  Cat on a Hot Tin Roof , but that's against the rules. Everyone you date, you date  right now .  3) It doesn't matter if you and your friends all have George Clooney as your Saturday night. This is bound to happen and it's fair within the rules of the game: having to cross check your schedule with your friends will add a level of difficulty to this game that you don't need. It's hard enough to decide whether So and So is a Tuesday or a Wednesday without having to make an Excel spreadsheet to make sure you're not stepping on your officemate's toes. You'll see.   4) You can't use, say, "the cast of  Band of Brothers " as one night.  One man or woman per night. Nice try, though.   AND NOW, MY CHOICES:    SUNDAY  First choice:  urlLink Lindsay Lohan  Alternate:  urlLink Jennifer   urlLink Love   urlLink Hewitt    MONDAY  First choice:  urlLink Michelle   urlLink Branch  Alternate:  urlLink Chelsea Clinton    TUESDAY  First choice:  urlLink Melissa Etheridge  Alternate:  urlLink Portia de Rossi    WEDNESDAY  First choice:  urlLink Katie Couric  Alternate:  urlLink Kelly Ripa    THURSDAY  First choice:  urlLink Reba McEntire   Alternate:  urlLink Ashley Judd    FRIDAY  First choice: the WWE's own  urlLink Stephanie McMahon  Alternate:  urlLink Carmen Electra    SATURDAY  First choice:  Survivor 's  urlLink Jerri Manthey  Alternate: 80's pop princess  urlLink Tiffany  (still have that  Playboy  issue, yes I do...)  THE BULLPEN:  urlLink Catherine Zeta-Jones ,  urlLink Madonna ,  urlLink Kelly Osbourne ,  urlLink Sharon Osbourne  (most every *other* TV mother-daughter tag-team [now *there's* another list idea...]that came to mind for inclusion here would've also required some time travel [usually in addition to some interdimensional shifting, but let's save that for the fanfic, shall we?...]),  urlLink Misty Mundae  (link probably NSFW),  urlLink Emma Watson  (which would probably be a lot less creepy if for the purposes of this list I could consider time-traveling a 20-years-younger self 5 years into the future, but oh well...), a host of additional country singers left off mostly due to consideration of rule #1 -- and of course there were a number of others who were considered that, given slightly different constraints (or a different week, or a different breakfast...), might have made this list as well...

      [ this new version of an old favorite meme found by way of  urlLink Kristín's Weird Existence  ]   1. What color ink pen do you like best?  I'm very attached to my medium point black pens, thank you very much...   2. Do you prefer plain paper or paper with lines (notebook paper)?  Of late, I've mostly been writing on the back sides of things I run off the printer at work. When I do use lined notebook paper, I much prefer wide rule, as I can get a hand cramp by just  looking  at college-ruled paper...  (I suppose all that is at least in part a function of the fact that I ranked 3rd in my high school graduation class for worst handwriting: there was once a rumor that after graduation the guy at #2 got a job in encryption for the CIA; and as for the guy at #1 -- well, the first time I ever saw a JPEG of the  urlLink Voynich Manuscript , the thought crossed my mind that it bore a significant resemblence to his usual inscrutable chicken-scratchings...)   3. What's better: books from the library, or reading online?  Real books are undoubtedly better for the eyes (unless, like me, you make the mistake of looking back and forth between the book and the TV), but, due to accumulated inertia, I've been sticking mostly to on-line reading of late...   4. Which would you rather get, e-mail or snail mail?  I suppose I prefer e-mail, only because a snail mail carries the potential pressure of responding in kind, and my average creation time for your basic old-school letter is about 6 monthes...    5. Do you have a paper weight on your desk?  A couple of things on my work desk that *could* be paperweights:  a beer stein with the logo of the community college I got my Associate's degree at a Magic 8-Ball that I got at my Uniface training a while back (which has a Uniface logo on it) a foam coaster with my current employer's logo ...hmm, seems to be lotsa  urlLink logos  here (there may be a good reason for that, but I haven't a clue what meaning there might be behind it, and so I have no more words...)

       1. Do you prefer to be out in the sun or in the shade?  I'm a shade person -- any more fair-skinned and I'd be an honorary Goth...   2. Regarding the walls in your house, do you prefer neutral colors or bright colors?  My personal preference would be bright colors (with the exception of the bedroom and bathrooms) -- as with many projects around this house, the status of painting the south wall of the 'studio' purple is officially PENDING...   3. When hanging pictures on your walls, do you like things symmetric or asymmetric?  I tend to start with a goal of symmetry and eventually settle for something along the lines of a Zen-like asymmetrical 'symmetry' (if that makes any sense this time of the night...)   4. How about where you'd like to live; country or city?  I kinda like living on the fuzzy DMZ betwixt the two, meself: handy access to late-night Taco Bell without the worst of the rush hour congestion...   5. Your blog; Blogger, Blogdrive, Blog-City, or another one altogether?  Been on Blogger since Day One of my blogging career -- not so much out of brand loyalty as sheer laziness and cheepnez, but still...   6. Email; Yahoo, Hotmail, Gmail, or other?  2 Yahoos, 1 Gmail and 1 other -- my first Yahoo email is more and more just a repository for spammage these days, but I still use that one whenever I'm required to give an address for comments or such...   7. Air conditioning or just a fan when it's hot at night?  I  *loathe*  having fans on at night, particularly if they're pointed anywhere near me (tends to fire up the nasal passages rather fiercely) -- if  absolutely  necessary, I leave the AC on, but it's rarely for my benefit (usually because She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed decrees it...)   8. Dinner; seafood or steak?  Out of those options: 1st choice, breaded shrimp; 2nd choice, chopped steak; 3rd choice, breaded fish patty square thingamajigs -- given J's aversion to all forms of seafood (and most non-poultry meats), not standard options at home...   9. Your all-time favorite music media; CD's, cassette tapes, or vinyl (or 8-tracks)?  I think I've finally come to like CD's best for the flexibility of programming the CD player around songs-I-can't-stand (although I still miss the interesting effect when an 8-track would start to break down and simultaneously play two sequences of songs at the same time; or the ability to manipulate the playback speed of a turntable so that a Beatles album could be slowed down into something sounding like The Jesus and Mary Chain on barbituates, or a Stevie Wonder ballad sped up into a hyperkinetic Chipmunk...)    10. When learning a new software program, do you find it easier to follow a book or an online tutorial?  This old man, he reads the book (often again and again and again...)

Add to all of the above a new jazz tune that I (literally) dreamed up the algorithmic composition programming logic for a couple of days ago, another jazz tune (this one in 7/4) that I've been tinkering with (both in my head and in fragmentary MIDI form) since sometime in   1993   (!!!), and the long-deferred goals of cutting a CD of original music and forming a new band -- and still procrastination continues to have its strange and oddly compelling, almost hypnotic, inertial appeal...

      Last night (after staying home from work with the kind of headache that makes you wish you could puke for a couple of hours until whatever is making you hurt is expelled, but that never happens, of course, of course...), I dreamed I was on an on-site tech support call.  In an automobile repair shop [note to newer readers: I work for a computer software company that specializes in county court systems].  With Michael Moore (no, I'm not using cute pseudonyms here, I'm talking the real deal here...).  As the dream begins, I'm sitting with my face in my hands. Looking up, I find I am in the middle (physically and chronologically) of a discussion between Moore, a male and female employee of the repair shop, and one of my female co-workers (I can't tell who because I never see them clearly in the dream, and they barely get a word in edgewise with the others doing a perfect version of vintage Robert Altman dialogue). The female repair shop employee is talking in the kind of right-brain manner that lowers the life expectancy of support personnel: instead of discussing her actual *problem*, she's talking on and on about how the problem makes her  feel  and how it's affecting her ability to do her job. Simultaneously, the male repair shop employee (apparently her supervisor) is apologizing to us for this woman's inability to stick to answering our questions: he says he knows we don't support the machine under discussion (something that, despite the paper feed, looks most like an EKG machine gene-spliced with a toolbox); he knows they don't even have a *support* contract with our company; he  knows  it's all her fault -- it's something she's doing wrong but he can't watch her every minute of the workday... yadda yadda, etc.,  ad infinitum .  Finally, to my relief and surprise, Moore seizes control of the conversation by making the seemingly-sensible suggestion that they put the machine in self-diagnostic mode, and then we'll read the printout. I decide to use this break as an opportunity to extract myself from the midst of a conversation I wasn't really following anyway, but as I'm circumnavigating around Mr. Moore, at roughly the same spot Magellan died, my right knee gives out (and when I say  gives out , I mean it in the sense of a dry tree limb breaking under baseball-sized hail -- it's loud, it's ugly, and it hurts like hell...).  I manage to crawl the rest of the way around Moore and prop myself up against the wall of the shop, everyone around oblivious to my situation. Moore, apparently killing time while the machine is self-testing, is now recounting all the things he says he left off his job application: that he was born in Germany, the journalism awards he won in junior high, and so on. I briefly consider fabricating a story about winning some college science competition in Connecticut while still in grade school, but decide I'm neither in the mood nor the physical condition to play either side of the 60 Minutes Interview Game (home version).  I look over my shoulder at the shop's break room (which more resembles a bus station) and see an upright piano in its midst. My brief glimpse of sunlight at the possibility of playing it is quickly darkened when I notice two adjacent white keys about a third of the way up the keyboard appear to be permanently stuck in the depressed position (ooh, there's something Freudian right there, eh?...).

       True or False?:    1. I like my job.  True -- I'd phrase it more like "I'm  comfortable  with my job" (Lord knows it's not like I'm back working on the sewage system of a church-based wilderness camp or anything), but I'd *love* to be working on something that combined computer programming, music, poetry, aesthetics, psychology, chaos theory, string theory, fuzzy logic, the properties of concrete...   2. I find time to 'smell the flowers' so to speak.  False -- I don't *like* the flowers, I'm *allergic* to the flowers, and I can't smell  anything  anyhoo with my current set of sinuses...   3. I have no problem thinking of things to write about in my blog.  False -- check the past week for evidence...   4. 'Organization' is my middle name!  True -- although 'overly-endlessly-organizing-to-the-point-of- urlLink OCD ' might be more apropos...   5. If 'Plan A' doesn't work, there's always a 'Plan B.'  True -- but when you're down to 'Plan Z', it might be time to reconsider your goals...   6. I adjust easily to new surroundings.  False -- I  adjust  to where an outside observer would *think* it was easy, but internally, it rarely is...   7. I'd rather work 'behind the scenes' than 'in the spotlight.'  The terminology used in this question incline me to want to answer False: in the contexts of 'performance' (concerts, theatre, etc.), I tend to gravitate towards the spot -- in an everyday-life context, though, I'd tend to answer True (in the words of Adam West's Batman, " urlLink I shouldn't wish to attract attention "...)   8. I'm happy where I am, at this point in my life.  False -- I can relate a little too well to  urlLink Woody Allen 's  urlLink oft-proclaimed sense  of self-suspected  urlLink anhedonia ...   9. I can wake up in the morning without an alarm clock.  True (I *can*, but no bets on if I *would*) -- I don't typically use an alarm clock myself now, but J does, then  she  makes sure I get up -- in her absence, if I want to get up  on time , then the alarm clock becomes a necessary evil...   10.

      [ via the similarly-Kermit-like  urlLink Maximum Verbosity  ]    urlLink    What Color is Your Brain?    brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     At work or in school:  I work best by myself. I like to focus on my ideas until my desire for understanding is satisfied. I am easily bored if the subject holds no interest to me. Sometimes, it is hard for me to set priorities because so many things are of interest.   With friends:  I may seem reserved. Although my thoughts and feelings run deep, I am uneasy with frequent displays of emotion. I enjoy people who are interesting and of high integrity.   With family:  I am probably seen as a loner because I like a lot of private time to think. Sometimes, I find family activities boring and have difficulty following family rules that don't make sense to me. I show love by spending time with my family and sharing ideas and interests.

      Here's the rules:   1. Take five books off your bookshelf. 2. Book No. 1 -- first sentence. 3. Book No. 2 -- last sentence on page fifty. 4. Book No. 3 -- second sentence on page one hundred. 5. Book No. 4 -- next to the last sentence on page one hundred fifty. 6. Book No. 5 -- final sentence of the book. 7. Make the five sentences into a paragraph.   Here's my result:   The position of the arts in the scale of human knowledge is, perhaps, the most eloquent symptom of the gulf between man's progress in the physical sciences and his stagnation (or, today, his retrogression) in the humanities. A complex problem like portraying the production of hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest called for a dozen different solutions -- until one evolved which told the story with greater clarity and drama.

       If you had to choose:    1. Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly?  Gene Kelly, because I once stole as much of my freestyle dance moves from him as I was once physically capable of...  2. The Great Gatsby or The Sun Also Rises?  Never read either, sorry...  3. Count Basie or Duke Ellington?  Gotta pick Duke for the intricacy of some of his arrangements, although it's a close call in terms of piano technique...  4. Cats or dogs?  Was a dog guy pre-marriage, cat guy since, and my spouse J is still pushing for a new puppy...  5. Matisse or Picasso?  Picasso (although Matisse ain't chopped liver...)  6. Yeats or Eliot?  Eliot by a hair; I do like the more apocalyptic bits of Yeats...  7. Buster Keaton or Charlie Chaplin?  I gotta go with Keaton for sheer balls-to-the-wall physical comedy, but  The Dictator  and  Modern Times  have their moments...  8. Flannery O'Connor or John Updike?  Since I know I've read O'Connor (and can't place anything I've read by Updike), that gets the nod...  9. To Have and Have Not or Casablanca?  Casablanca by the same logic as #8...  10. Jackson Pollock or Willem de Kooning?  Oh hell, this is a close call -- Pollock by a paint droplet...  11. The Who or the Stones?  early Who over early Stones, but for total career (and my final answer): Stones...  12. Philip Larkin or Sylvia Plath?  (aarrgghh!) Split decision...  13. Trollope or Dickens?  Dickens, because I have no idea who Trollope is...  14. Billie Holiday or Ella Fitzgerald?  Neither, I'm afraid -- I respect their respective skills, but I don't feel any visceral connection to their recordings...  15. Dostoyevsky or Tolstoy?  My Russian Lit skills aren't refined enough to distinguish the two...  16. The Moviegoer or The End of the Affair?  I saw a few minutes of the latter film, but not enough to give an informed answer...  17. George Balanchine or Martha Graham?  You know, if it isn't Fosse, I generally can't tell...  18. Hot dogs or hamburgers?  Tend to prefer hot dogs...  19. Letterman or Leno?  Letterman by a margin wider than the gap in his teeth...  20. Wilco or Cat Power?  More acquainted with Cat Power, so there's my choice...  21. Verdi or Wagner?  Even though I'm nigh unto pathologically averse to opera, I'll go with Wagner here...  22. Grace Kelly or Marilyn Monroe?  Marilyn...  23. Bill Monroe or Johnny Cash?  Johnny (but I like Bill too...)  24. Kingsley or Martin Amis?  Who?...  25. Robert Mitchum or Marlon Brando?  Mitchum...   26. Mark Morris or Twyla Tharp?  Despite what I said in #17, I know and like most of what I've seen of Tharp...  27. Vermeer or Rembrandt?  Calling this a tie, since I can't mentally pull up a single picture from memory that I *know* is by one or the other...  28. Tchaikovsky or Chopin?  Chopin easily (Did I tell you I think Thelonious Monk was the reincarnation of Chopin? Did I? Huh?...)  29. Red wine or white?  Prefer red (but white works sometimes too...)  30. Noël Coward or Oscar Wilde?  Wilde (but only just...)  31. Grosse Pointe Blank or High Fidelity?  I watched Grosse Point all the way through; I couldn't do the same with Fidelity...  32. Shostakovich or Prokofiev?  I tend to lean toward Shostakovich...  33. Mikhail Baryshnikov or Rudolf Nureyev?  Baryshnikov...  34. Constable or Turner?  ?...  35. The Searchers or Rio Bravo?  Rio Bravo...  36. Comedy or tragedy?  Comedy...  37. Fall or spring?  Summer...  38. Manet or Monet?  Minnie Mouse...  39. The Sopranos or The Simpsons?  Simpsons...  40. Rodgers and Hart or Gershwin and Gershwin?  The Gershwin boys...  41. Joseph Conrad or Henry James?  Neither, actually...  42. Sunset or sunrise?  Sunset (if I'm up at sunrise, I'm not a happy camper...)  43. Johnny Mercer or Cole Porter?  Johnny Mercer (close, though...)  44. Mac or PC?  PC...  45. New York or Los Angeles?  Only barely been to either, but I think LA is more my speed...  46. Partisan Review or Horizon?  No clue...  47. Stax or Motown?  I can almost certainly name more Motown tunes, but I also know I love the Stax sound, so Stax gets the vote here...  48. Van Gogh or Gauguin?  Very close call to Van Gogh...  49. Steely Dan or Elvis Costello?  I imagine that if I reached for a random recording of one or the other, I would be more likely satisfied by something from the Steely Dan stack than the Costello stack, but I also think if I had to choose between my favorite recording of each, I'd go with Elvis, which is what I'm doing here...  50. Reading a blog or reading a magazine?  Well, I do both pretty dernded frequently...  51. John Gielgud or Laurence Olivier?  Gielgud, entirely on the strength of  Arthur ...  52. Only the Lonely or Songs for Swingin' Lovers?  No preference...  53. Chinatown or Bonnie and Clyde?  Chinatown...  54. Ghost World or Election?  Only seen a few minutes of each, but Election looks like the kind of movie I hate, and Ghost World like the kind I don't...  55. Minimalism or conceptual art?  Dead heat...  56. Daffy Duck or Bugs Bunny?  Bugs...  57. Modernism or postmodernism?  Postmod...  58. Batman or Spider-Man?  Batman...  59. Emmylou Harris or Lucinda Williams?  Close call to Emmylou...  60. Johnson or Boswell?  Not a fan of either...  61. Jane Austen or Virginia Woolf?  Woolf, but only just...  62. The Honeymooners or The Dick Van Dyke Show?  Slight edge to Van Dyke...  63. An Eames chair or a Noguchi table?  No clue again...  64. Out of the Past or Double Indemnity?  I know Double Indemnity and not the other, so there you go...  65. The Marriage of Figaro or Don Giovanni?  Didn't I already say I was *pathologically* averse to opera?...  66. Blue or green?  I once spray-painted my tennis shoes green. That answer yer question?...  67. A Midsummer Night's Dream or As You Like It?  Not inclined one way or the other...  68. Ballet or opera?  (gak!) My two least favorite art forms tangentially related to music (yes, I said opera is *tangentially* related to music -- I'm in a bad mood now, okay?...) -- given the forced choice, I'd rather go to a ballet; I could then close my eyes and pretend it's a concert...  69. Film or live theater?  I'm inclined to go with film; the only advantage that immediately comes to mind with live theater is that the audience generally doesn't talk all the way through it (at least in my experience...)  70. Acoustic or electric?  Sorry, my ideal is mixing the two...  71. North by Northwest or Vertigo?  Vertigo...  72. Sargent or Whistler?  Not enough background to say...  73. V.S. Naipaul or Milan Kundera?  (see above...)  74. The Music Man or Oklahoma?  Music Man  75. Sushi, yes or no?   *HELL*  no...  76. The New Yorker under Ross or Shawn?  Not a consumer of the New Yorker...  77. Tennessee Williams or Edward Albee?  Williams...  78. The Portrait of a Lady or The Wings of the Dove?  Portrait of a Lady (by the thinnest of margins...)  79. Paul Taylor or Merce Cunningham?  Merce (because of the John Cage connection...)  80. Frank Lloyd Wright or Mies van der Rohe?  Wright...  81. Diana Krall or Norah Jones?  Krall by a landslide...  82. Watercolor or pastel?  Watercolor...  83. Bus or subway?  Bus (being mildly claustrophobic...)  84. Stravinsky or Schoenberg?  (hate forced choice, hate forced choice, hate, hate, hate...) Can't choose...  85. Crunchy or smooth peanut butter?  Smooth...  86. Willa Cather or Theodore Dreiser?  Cather (only just...)  87. Schubert or Mozart?  Mozart (no question...)  88. The Fifties or the Twenties?  Gotta pick  Happy Days  over  The Untouchables ...  89. Huckleberry Finn or Moby-Dick?  Finn (that whale story is one tough read, dude!...)  90. Thomas Mann or James Joyce?  Joyce (of course, so is  Ulysses ...)  91. Lester Young or Coleman Hawkins?  Hawkins by a hemi-demi-semi quaver...  92. Emily Dickinson or Walt Whitman?  Whitman...  93. Abraham Lincoln or Winston Churchill?  Lincoln (we share a birthdate, you see...)  94. Liz Phair or Aimee Mann?  Liz (but I like Aimee too...)  95. Italian or French cooking?  Italian (but not by much...)  96. Bach on piano or harpsichord?  Hate to commit apostasy, but I prefer piano...  97. Anchovies, yes or no?  Prefer no (but I will eat them, nonetheless...)  98. Short novels or long ones?  Short (I have the attention span of a... ooh, look, shiny!...)  99. Swing or bebop?  Bebop (although most swing is good, too...)  100. "The Last Judgment" or "The Last Supper"?  I'd rather have supper than judgment, thank you...

      [ via  urlLink The Other Side  ]  I scored a  40  on  urlLink The Type A Test :   You seem to be in the middle between the Type A and Type B personality. In this case, the middle ground is good. You know how and when to cut loose, forget your daily pressures and simply relax. Nonetheless, you realize that taking on challenges and being competitive is necessary to reach your goals...but you don't want to take it to any extreme. Generally, you are easy to be around, and people tend to feel relaxed and comfortable in your presence - with the exception of the occasional stress attack or highly charged day. The equilibrium you have achieved is healthy; so don't let your hostile, aggressive, and competitive alter ego take over too often...or things could get ugly.

       [the questions are in bold; my answers are not -- most of you already know the drill...]    1. I usually clean my house on _________, or about every ____ days.  I'm a married guy, and even when I was single, it was like, *housecleaning*?... okay, now that I've probably offended most of my remaining readership, we really don't tend to follow any sort of strict schedule on that sort of thing (principally because my wife J tends toward the right-brain end of the behavioral spectrum...)   2. My favorite Sunday night program to watch on television is __________.  Historically, my main Sunday-night must-sees were  Good Eats ,  Iron Chef  and/or  WWE Sunday Night Heat , but I've been working on weaning myself from the TV (with some, albeit limited, success), so I don't have any current "gotta"s. A few hours ago, I was watching mostly the BET Jazz network (with the typical cliched male remote control flipping through the premium channels during the commercial breaks...)   3. Monday morning I usually waking up thinking, "__________."  "F&$%, I gotta go to work  again ?..."   4. To wind down at the end of a busy day, I like to ___________.  Achieve a state of catatonia via TV-channel-surfing, web-surfing and legally-prescribed medication...   5. I try not to call anyone on the phone until after ______ a.m.  I generally *can't* call anyone before 9, mostly because I'm seldom together (in terms of mental capacity and/or morning hygiene) before then...   6. And I NEVER call anyone after ________.  If we exclude the hours of the day when I'm at the office, that sentence would end "I breathe"...   7. When I don't have to get up to go to work or school, I sleep in until _____.  On average, between 11 am and 1 pm (although 2 or 3 is not unheard of...)   8. I have ____ telephones in my house.  3 functioning ones (that I'm aware of) -- I'm pretty certain that, if we have any cell phones about, they're not much more than paperweights at the moment...   9. I usually answer the phone on the ____ ring.  At work, one -- at home, I generally let it ring four times, then the voice mail picks up; if it's really something  important  (or someone who knows me well enough), then it'll ring again right away, and *then* I'll answer it...   10. When I know I should be sleeping, but am having a hard time falling asleep, I usually _________.  Zone out on the Web (gee, will you look at the time), or the soft-core pr0n on Showtime...

No (although I did wish Paula Jones had trained more seriously for her Celebrity Boxing match with Tonya Harding...)   4. I voted for President Bush in 2000.  No, didn't vote -- period...   5. I am a gun owner.  Not at present (unless J's hiding one from me); used to have a BB gun when I was younger, though...   6. I support school voucher programs.  No (but then, I don't actively oppose them as a whole, either -- this topic would probably fall under the heading of evaluating the particulars on a case-by-case basis for me: some yea, some nay...)   7. I oppose condom distribution in public schools.  No (but I do think  urlLink taste tests  are a little outside the acceptable norm...)   8. I oppose bilingual education.  No (but mastery of English should be considered a primary goal of the American educational system; any bilingual curriculum that subverts that goal, I would not favor...)   9. I oppose gay marriage.  Wrong -- I have yet to hear a non-faith-based argument against gay marriage that passes for anything approaching logical...   10. I want Social Security privatized.  Nope -- I could see partial privatization as a possibility, but doing it 100% that way always sounds to me like throwing the 'Security' portion out with the bathwater...   11. I believe racial profiling at airports is common sense.  Yes, within reason (and  urlLink there's the rub  -- finding and defining an objective criteria that most of us would agree is 'reasonable'...)   12. I shop at Wal-Mart.  On occasion...   13. I enjoy talk radio.  Yeccchhh, @#$& no! Gimme some  tunes , man!...   14. I am annoyed when news editors substitute the phrase "undocumented person" for "illegal alien."  Almost *all* forms of  PC  annoy me...   15. I do not believe the phrase "a chink in the armor" is offensive.  Agreed, and 'a  urlLink niggardly  amount' is likewise a perfectly acceptable term (to anyone who reads beyond a fifth-grade level...)   16. I eat meat.  Yes (mostly poultry, bacon and bologna, with a burger or chopped steak every once in an odd while; with adapting myself more toward the  urlLink Zone Diet  being on my ever-growing 'to-do' list, that should be increasing...)   17. I believe O.J. Simpson was guilty.  Certainly by the ' urlLink preponderance of the evidence ' (which is how the civil trial ruled), and for me personally, ' urlLink beyond a reasonable doubt ' as well...   18. I cheered when I learned that Saddam Hussein had been captured.  I don't cheer over much o' nothing -- I suspect I pointed my index finger in the air, drew a couple of small circles, and that was that...   19. I cry when I hear "Proud to be an American" (God Bless the USA) by Lee Greenwood.  Only when I'm forced to listen to the whole thing (which would require duct-taping me to the chair and/or nailing my kneecaps to the floor...)   20. I don't believe the New York Times.  I don't believe much of anything or anybody, actually (yes, I may have some issues with  urlLink faith ...Faith Hill, not so much [other than that whole married-to-Tim-McGraw business, but whatev...])   [...gee, did I cover enough controversial topics to get some flamethrowers?...]

      Are really even (or uneven) rules to overcome our lot such selfless obstacles, pouring histamine into size twelve isolinear cutoffs and tying ethical dilemmas effectively (not often) under great heights, to overcome complete osmosis meant precisely like elfin totems, especially before each fawn or reindeer eats custard-haired rhizomes in semblance to massive atomic structures?

       1. I always exercise my right to vote. (If you are under 18, 'I will always exercise my right to vote as soon as I am old enough to.')    False  -- from 1980 to the present, I've gone to the voting booths twice: Carter/Reagan and Clinton/Bush (and the only one of *those* four I voted for was Bill...)   2. I pay little or no attention to the campaign ads aired on television prior to a presidential election.   As  True  as is humanly possible, given the saturation rate and the amount of TV I watch...   3. I can see myself running for some type of political office someday.  Oh,  *hell*  no, definitely  False  -- too g@&$@#* many skeletons in  this  closet, yawl...   4. I believe we will see a woman become president in my lifetime.   True  (although the optimism of that answer is still buried under a few layers of skeptical cynicism...)   5. I try to keep an open mind regarding all political issues.   True , if we define 'an open mind' as being "I ain't deciding who I think's right until at least *one* of you makes an  attempt  to give me an intelligent answer!"...   6. I believe the drinking age should be raised.  Kinda  True  (yes, now that I'm officially  Old , I can say that -- if I was still in the college dorms, I'd naturally argue the other direction...)   7. I think the legal age to vote should be raised.  I kinda like the idea that guy in California had about letting  urlLink 14-to-17-year-olds vote , so I guess that's a  False ...   8. I thought these questions were interesting.   Well, certainly not in  urlLink the Chinese sense , so:  False ...   9. I will be back to play again!  Oh, so  True ...   [and I'm skipping the Bonus Question this week because  urlLink I have nothing interesting to say, and no way to say it ...]

      [ courtesy of  urlLink All Things Jen(nifer)  ]      You're an  Audi TT ! You're not the fastest, nor the most nimble, but you're cute and you have style. You're not intensely competitive, but when you pass by, everyone turns to look.  Take the  urlLink Which Sports Car Are You?  quiz.
