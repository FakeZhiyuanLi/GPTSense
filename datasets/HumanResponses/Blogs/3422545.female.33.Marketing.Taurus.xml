       What a whirlwind! My first trip since I've decided to try travel writing. I got a few articles started: one on dogs in Paris and another on a single woman's trip to paris (that would be me). You can see pictures from my trip and about the people I met at  urlLink www.lisabanks.com/Paris/Paris1.htm .  I'm still recovering. I caught a cold on the way back. The worst kind of souvenir. But this week I've had 3 new inquiries from my website, so work is still clipping along...

       My Japanese friends just got back from a visit to Toronto. They found the people there much more patient and easy to communicate with than here in Gainesville, FL. And Toronto is probably the most "Americanized" city in Canada. Another proof that Canadians are a more considerate breed.   But why is that all Canadians envy you when they find out you're in Florida? Most of them haven't lived here, that's why. Sure, 3x the sunshine is nice. No snow is good, too. But if you ask me, the most important thing about a place is the culture of the people. Eager Canadians who head south for the warm weather will gradually come to realize there's no place like home.

       It's been 2 weeks, and still I long to be kissed on both cheeks when I meet someone! I want to turn around and go straight back to Paris.   But the ad agency where I work (www.adbiz.com) suddenly has more work coming in, and I've got two new projects on the go for freelance this week. One is search engine writing for a cosmetic surgeon's website. Another, an ad for building insurance. A lot more like this, and I'll be back in France in no time.  I've started on a couple more articles, about onsens and enkais in Japan and the glories of NS in the summer. But I have yet to finish one, since the paid stuff is taking up my time. That, and badminton! We started a club here in Gainesville, and we played for the first time two nights ago. It was fun. Some competitive people there, but for the most part, we just blissed out getting all sweaty (no a/c) and hitting the bird around.  Although it threw me for a loop when my French friend went to kiss me on the cheek instead of shaking hands after our first game. I got a little shy and forgot to do the second cheek. So we just resorted to the regular hand-shaking after that.
