      I'm really packing now *sigh*  I don't want to go anywhere, but I don't have much of a choice.  At least I'll get caught up on my summer reading and such.  Speaking of reading, I broke down and bought  The Code Book  by Simon Singh, the guy who wrote  Fermat's Enigma .  It looks interesting, and I'll probably read it in the car.  I also bought a really cool journal/notebook thing with graph paper inside.  Mom laughed about that... why would I want to think about mathematics, she says.  I said mathematics is elegant, and boy did she get a chuckle out of that.  Guess I better get busy.

      I just realized a short while ago that I was going to be the only person at the D.C. CYCL conference that had not yet seen Michael Moore's film Fahrenheit 9/11... so I downloaded a bootleg copy and watched it on my computer.  I found the documentary to be very touching and effective.  It's clear that he stretches the truth in places to make his points, but every good documentary has to take a point of view.  He said nothing surprising about Bush... I've been thoroughly disgusted with him for some time now. The interviews with the parents of soldiers in Iraq were very moving, as was the footage of the low-income citizens about enlisting.  It was good to see the 2000 election footage.  Unfortunately I didn't follow current events four years ago... I was only in 7th grade.  Looking back at the outcry that followed the Supreme Court ruling is shocking.  I had no idea that there were  riots  at his inauguration parade.  Where was I?  Uninformed people, as I used to be, might as well be dead.  My favorite part was the George Orwell quotes at the end.  I recently read Orwell's two most famous books and I'm pretty sure this quote from the F911 is composed from snippets of 1984: It's not a matter of whether the war is not real... or if it is.  Victory is not possible.  The war is not meant to be won; it is meant to be continuous.  A hierarchical society is only possible on the basis of poverty and ignorance.  This new version is the past, and no different past can ever have existed.  In principle, the war effort is designed to keep society on the brink of starvation.  The war is raged by the ruling group against its own subjects, and it's object is not the victory over Eurasia or East Asia but to keep the very structure of society... intact.

      My parents have hijacked my remaining summer.  We leave on June 30 for West Virginia,  buttcrack of the world , to visit Dad's relatives there... they don't have computers, or internet, or cell-phone reception there.  I swear I'm going to die.  I just hope we avoid my Uncle John's shack on the river because he doesn't have anything in his shell of a house: no electricity, no real furniture, no bedroom/bathroom doors, no airconditioning, no telephone, no tv, no running water (except in the bathroom)... it's primitive, really.  The only good thing about driving up there is that I might get to swing over to Princeton, NJ and take a look at the campus and town.  We're staying through July 11 or 12th (which means I'm going to miss all my friends' July 4th parties) before turning around to come home.  I need to pack, but I don't want to.  I hate laundry and clothing.  I'd wear the same clothes every day this summer if it weren't for hygienic concerns.  I can only hope they'll let me bring my computer along for the ride.   Free AOL trial , here I come... heh.  Even without internet there's a lot of stuff I can do... I've been meaning to play around with  urlLink Mathematica  and  urlLink PARI  for a while now.  I'll be a lot more helpful in next spring on the interschool test if I can get some background with these programs.  Anyway, I still don't get to come home after my stay in WV.  They're dropping me off at my aunt's house near Atlanta, GA so I can catch my flight out of Atlanta International Airport to Dullus, which is near Washington D.C.  You see, mom thought it would be a great idea for me to attend the  urlLink Congressional Youth Leadership Council ... what a waste of 10 days.  I have to dress up all the time and be on my best behavior and talk about politics and such with other academic stars like myself.  Most people would think this quite an honor, but I take no pleasure in touring D.C. in heels or rubbing noses with other elites.  I'm content right here in my little room with my books and PC and calculator... and silence.   Call me an introvert , I guess.  I should be flying back to Atlanta by July 22, and probably home a few days later.  All in all, I count it as a month wasted.  I'll be home just in time to pick out my school supplies for the fall semester.  *sigh*

             Currently Reading   Count Down : Six Kids Vie for Glory at the World's Toughest Math Competition  By  Steve Olson     The kids Steve Olson discusses in this book are absolutely amazing.  I used to think being on the US International Mathematics Olypiad team would be the coolest thing ever, but know I realize that they're wayyyyy out of my league.  I didn't even understand what one of the example questions in the book was asking, let alone how to go about answering them.  That's okay, though... studies have shown that "child prodigies" usually aren't any more successful in their adult life than other resonably intelligent people.  Since my major goals are long term I don't need to get hung up on the abilities these kids have developed at such an early age.  On a lighter note, check out the  urlLink Clay Mathematics Institute Millennium Problems .  Maybe I'll make one of these my life project.  Andrew Wiles, the Princeton professor who proved Fermat's Last Theorem, said he began thinking about the problem when he was only 10 years old.  If I get started soon maybe I'll have a chance.

      I spent some time this afternoon designing a spreadsheet in  Excel    to automatically calculate my grade point average as I rearranged courses and tweaked things to meet all graduation requirements while maxing out my GPA potential. Of course I could do this by hand, but it would take several hours to re-calculate my entire GPA to weigh each different possibility.    The verdict: despite being royaly screwed by my freshman guidance couselor (she forced me to take a non-required unweighted course that I wasn't interested in at all while allowing my competitors to go ahead and take their required courses) I can still come out as first in my class of 450 by   0.00043   of a point. Seriously. I accomplish this by taking my required foreign language classes at the local community college at night for an additional 0.5 weight (not offered at the high school) and then taking on an AP course (for another 1 point weight) in the day schedule slots freed up by this. More work? Yes, but I get to triumph over injustice while setting a new record GPA for my school,  4.602941176 .

      I just stumbled across Upromise.com, and the more I read about that program the more I like it.  I wish my parents had had the foresight to start a 529 college savings plan back when I was young.... it's really too late now, for me, but I signed them up to start saving for my youngest brother's college expenses.  Basically you just register your credit cards and grocery cards and then a percentage of everything you buy from participating companies, brands, and stores goes into your savings.  It's a small percentage, but over the course of 15 years it comes to a lot of money, especially if you invest the money you save for higher returns.  No hassle.  No risk.  I wish I was old enough (18) to apply for their Citi Upromise credit card.... they give you cash back into your savings on  everything  you buy.  Can't beat that.    Fortunately for me I've got the Florida Bright Future Scholarship to cover the brunt of my college expenses but it's still not clear how my two younger sisters will finance their college education.  Mom and Dad sure can't afford it, even though they'd love to.  One of them is thinking about joining the Army and paying for education that way, but in a lot of ways I'd almost rather her not go to college.  In my opinion, scholarship money is the wrong reason for anybody to join the service, especially somebody coming from an anti-Bush anti-war family like ours.

       Yes, I survived my trip to the  Armpit of the World  (a.k.a. West Virginia) and 10 days at the National Young Leaders Conference ( urlLink NYLC ) in Washington D.C. We had to wear these NYLC namebadges around and a bunch of people thought NYLC stood for "New York Lesbian Club" or something, lmao.   Even though I wasn't excited about going beforehand, I have to admit that Washington was awesome. I got to do lots of cool things including having breakfast while listening to a panel of journalists at the exclusive National Press Club. And we were addressed by Representative McCarthy (D-NY) while sitting in the seats on the House of Representatives floor. Library of Congress and the National Archive were cool. I saw original copies of the Constitution, Bill of Rights, and Declaration of Independence at the National Archive. And a Gutenburg Bible worth 6 million dollars at the Library of Congress. We did normal touristy things too, like visiting several of the monuments, including the new WWII memorial. I was surprised by the FDR memorial... the quotes carved into the wall were very touching and significant, but not the ones that are normally associated with him like the "a day which will live in infamy" bit. All in all, one of the best trips ever.    While in Washington I had the opprotunity to see a comedy called the  urlLink Capitol Steps .  They were  hilarious !! I ended up buying three of their CDs afterwards, which are also available on amazon if you're interested. Right now I'm listening to  Between Iraq and a Hard Place.    The people I met were the best part. There were some annoying rich kids there, but for the most part the people that came were there because they were interested in politics and leadership. I discovered that there are actually other intelligent liberal-minded youth in the nation, which was very refreshing. Probably the most interesting person I met was a speed-reading liberal; he was an atheist, but loved studying religion and the philosophy of Frederick Nietzsche. I first bumped into him while pouring myself some diet coke at dinner. He commented on my choice of beverage and then I remarked that John Edwards has a diet coke addiction as well (he normally opens 4 cans before noon.) Then this guy, Austin Mobley, replied, "Time Magazine, right?" ...I'd read it in Time during the airplane ride from Atlanta. I also met this guy named Kevin from Miami who is just like me, except for being male (all the same clubs, all the same interests, same bedroom motif... we even looked kind of similar). Now I have lots of new contacts, although now that I'm back home I'd feel kind of weird emailing them... we all have several traits in common but nothing to say important enough to warrant a personal email.     By the way, I know you all got your AP scores!  I wanna know what you guys got so leave me comments.   (As for me---Euro: 4, Stat: 5)      More than an end to war, we want an end to the beginning of all wars - yes, an end to this brutal, inhuman and thoroughly impractical method of settling the differences between governments.            urlLink Franklin D.

      A lot of people at school are buying them; I still don't know why.  A friend of mine just paid  $150  for the TI-84+SE at OfficeMax, the same price as the TI-89 (actually, the 89s have probably come down some since the new release).  I couldn't believe it.  I mean, don't these people realize that they're paying 50% more for a different color faceplate and some extra RAM they don't need?  The whole situation reeks of ignorance.  The freshman in geometry and algebra II are especially annoying about it... they're just buying their first graphing calculators so most of them have gotten 84s.  They try to act superior because their calculators are "better" than mine and the other oldschool math teamers.  Too bad they don't know how to do anything except add and subtract on them.  Heh.  I don't see the attraction.  They're not even visually appealing... in my opinion, the old look was much more esthetic than the new whored-out version with shiny plastic parts and smooth flowing lines.  Unless you're planning to have sex with your calculator, the changes seem completely unnecessary.

      Finally, somebody organized a Florida Mu Alpha Theta forum for students to come together and discuss things. So far it looks like there are only 50 members or so, but I reconize several of them and many of us are club presidents. Most of the people on the board right now are really passionate about what they do or else a) they wouldn't have discovered the board and b) they would not be in team leadership positions.  Just because there are only 40-some members doesn't mean its not active... every time I go back there have been updates and new posts. It's really cool to be in touch with these people. In the past you go to competitions and you recognize the same people you compete against but you never really have an the time or the opprotunity to actually get to know them.  This one guy named Norm emailed me already. He seems like a really cool person that I'd like to get to know. He's read the Singh books that I recently finished, which means he has an honest interest in the same kinds of topics as me.  I'll probably email him later or maybe get on line, but right now I really have to get to work on my homefun (work).

      I guess it's been a while since I've updated this thing, but it's not for a lack of interest. School started back up, and I've been really busy ever since. Homework is killer: 3 AP Classes at an hour of homework each, and Dual Enrolled Plane Trig that usually sucks up another hour a night or so. So far I'm loving Trig... due to some unusual goings-on in the guidance office I somehow ended up in Mr. Durden's only trig class with 15 other people, including Chad--my second--and Sallah. (That makes my 4th period trig the smallest class in the school following the SPED class and AP Chemistry, which only 10 people are brave enough to take. There are 5 other trig classes with 30 people each in them, which only makes my class even stranger.) Accident? I think not. Durden wanted me in his class again so he could give me some more interesting problems to sink my teeth into.  I need to finish typing up the Math Team and Mu Alpha Theta flyers for Club Day on Tuesday or Mrs. Doo will eat me. "Math Research" (better known as "Math Team Administration Period") has been kind of a drag so far, but I guess it comes along with being President of Mu Alpha Theta. Things should pick up as soon as competition season starts and we start planning the calendar girl competition/fundraiser to raise travel money.  Speaking of money, the School Advisory Council is cutting Math Team's funding this year so I have to come up with some new fundraising ideas. We're still planning on selling advertisments to go in the school calendar, but we need supplemental income or else the trips are going to cost the students a lot more this year than they have in the past. Choir and band have candy sales covered year round. Car washes are ineffective and time consuming. I was thinking about maybe getting Sweet Temptations to donate some candy and have kids pay to guess the amount of candy in jars, or something to that effect. I might also look into a sponsorship from FES or Buffalo Rock... they've helped us out some in the past.  In other news, I recently started selling on eBay. I've always wanted to try it before but until recently I couldn't create an account (no CC number). I sold a few textbooks I paid $3 for at Goodwill... they went for ~$30 each, so I made a handsome profit while they got an awesome deal. It can be a lot of hassle, but it's a nice source of extra income; I'm doing at least as well as my friends working stupid jobs for $5-something an hour, but I have flexible hours (or no hours at all, if I don't feel like it.) It's mostly a weekend thing. I make 7-day listings starting on Sunday... they end the following weekend and I drop the items off at the post office on the way home from school Monday.  I mentioned making a good profit on those books, but that won't last. The only reason those books went for a lot is because the fall college semester is starting up soon and people need cheap books. So now I'm trying to think of other things I could sell that doesn't require a lot of hassle (taking pictures of unique items.) I'm thinking I might try to sell some DVDs or CDs next, perhaps some FAR items. Who knows.
