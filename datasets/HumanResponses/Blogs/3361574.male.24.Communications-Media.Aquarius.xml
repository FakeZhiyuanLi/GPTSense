       Yes, I had a severe case of the Mondays all day. I couldn't sleep to save my life last night. I ended up tossing and turning until 2 am and I swear it felt like 10 seconds between the time I fell asleep and my alarm went off at 6.   So I went to work and waded through like 5 million pages of news and feature copy for the paper and actually got quite a bit of writing done (which is rare for a Monday - normally I do it all Monday night). Then I found out the superintendent at the local school had a mild stroke this weekend, so I had to get on that story. Unfortunately, he's the only person that has the court documents I need for the uber-story that will define my career, and I don't exactly want to call him on his hospital bed and say, "Hey, I know the story I'm working on could be a major blow to the school's reputation and you're recovering from a stroke, but I need my Pulitzer, dammit."  So The Story will have to wait at least another week. I just hope none of those fuckers at the Dispatch grab onto it. They don't have my incredible sources, so I'm sure they won't...yet.  I shall attempt to sleep now.

       I'm a dangerous man when I'm bored. I do crazy, weird, destructive things, like the following:  I bought a new filter for my Brita on-tap filter for the kitchen sink. I bought the original hoo-dickey at WalMart awhile ago because, frankly, I'm a complete germophobe, and my water comes out of a well. I'm usually not comfortable with a glass of water unless it's been boiled, filtered and run a series of pH and e.coli tests. But this thing seemed to work - no taste to the water, at least.  Anyway, a few days ago the dreaded red light of bacterial doom came on, and I went ot WalMart to buy a replacement. And the grand total for this little faux-chrome dome filter thingamajig? Twenty freakin bucks!  Being the dutiful consumer advocate that I am, I had to find out what could possibly cause this thing to cost $20. So after putting the new one on, I took the old one to the bandsaw and cut it open. I was expecting beakers, microcomputers and a miniature Japanese scientist living inside it with a pH test strip going, "It rooks good to me." What I found was a heavy, black cylindrical...rock. Seriously. It feels like slate.   I'm assuming it actually does something. The taste of the water is vastly improved â€“ meaning removed. But...it's a stone. How does it do its magical water-filtering thing?  Some things are too complicated even for me.

       So I'm sitting here in my La-Z-Boy, watching a tape of the Bison-Sioux women's basketball game held like 6 months ago (I finally borrowed it from a friend) and I start thinking, "Damn I'm bored. I think I should start yet another new online journal."  The other blogs I've done in the past have just faded into the darkness when I don't have time to update them. Hopefully with this one I'll actually find time to write in it. But that's what downtime at work is for, right?  I'm in central Minnesota. By choice, actually. When I graduated from college 2 years ago, I didn't have a job lined up, so I came here to my parents' lakehome to stay until I found a job. Six months of fruitless job searches later, I hooked up with a local newspaper as a freelance writer/photographer. After a month or two of that, and after impressing the hell out of them with my coverage of the Sen. Wellstone plane crash (I heard about it on CNN, hopped in my car and was the third journalist to get to that remote airport), they created a part-time position for me. That PT position blossomed into a full-time position and when the editor left, they offered me the job. It's been quite a ride.  I enjoy my job for the most part, but the money is shit, the hours aren't exactly becoming to a social life, and this area has little to none when it comes to women my age.  I suppose that's why I put this old basketball game in. I wanted some kind of reminder of college life. If I can't bar-hop until closing and have casual sex anymore, I might as well cheer for my alma mater's team, right?
