       Wow...  Haven't bothered with this for a few days...  Not to much to say though, I guess...  I have slept almost the entire weekend. Just been uncontrollably tired. I got up around 11 on Saturday whent to see my brother then came home and fell asleep again. And that is what I have been like for the past few days.  My poor friend. His heart is broken and I can't help. I can say sorry and offer comfort, but I have been in his place and I know that it is all useless. I know that none of my words will heal the hole that he feels right now. I wish so badly that I could help, that I could change what happend for him. He is such a nice guy and he deserves so much. I don't know what to do... Except pray for him. Which I will continue to do because God must have some sort of plan for him.  Ugh... I was fired from my babysitting job. They said i didn't take her to the park and swimming enough. But it has been to cold for that stuff. ahhh. and I couldn't take her bike riding because I have a heart problem and that could kill me. O well. I'll start looking for a job again.  This weekend. This weekend! It is so close and I get to be with my love.  I just need to make it through my psych appointment tomorrow and everything will be fine.  lalalalala....  I have more to write, but I also have to do some other stuff so TTFN.... TAH TAH FOR NOW.

       O geez.  I have my big semester test for summer school tomorrow and I still haven't done my homework. Well I did part of it earlier, but not the part i am getting a grade for. Lol. The only really bad thing is I couldn't really careless. Because I will pass with or with out passing the test, so what the heck I have more important things to think about.  Like....  Next Saturday.  I totally can not wait for next saturday.  I had to go shopping today for clothes that actually fit me and... umm.... yeah. I bought thess two cute outfits. Well I didn't by them my mother bought them, but yeah okay back to the cute outfits. One is specially saved for next saturday for when my fiance comes to town. And then one is for tomorrow night.  Tomorrow night will be interesting. I have a dinner thing with my mother and older sister. Lol. We never get along and the three of us are going to dinner. This ought to be very interesting. It took us forever to decide where to go because I am a vegan vegitarian and so places where I can eat are very limited. We are going for Chinese though so yummy yum yum yum.  Geez I have been so depressed I just slept the evening away, and had to force myself to get up so I could get my shower and then sit here for the last two hours and make excuses not to do my homework. I'm like really happy and all, but extremely depressed. Lol...   Wow. so I really figured out why they say you should strtch before you work out, and then work ito things slowly. Hint hint: when starting a new exercise for the first time never ever ever ever ever go into it with out stretching and doing an excessive amount at once. Lol... I am like so incredibely sore right now, but I find it very funny. O well, I'm not allowed to work out anyways. Guess  this is Gods way of telling me that I need to shut the Freak up and learn to listen. But I am not sure, I wasn't listening.  Okay, so this is all abunch of blah blah blah blah blah because I am like so bored and I don't want to do my homework and I just really really feel like just talking for no aparrent reason or about anything significant. I am just happy. Thinking about bill and just extremely anxious to see him.   Okay so here is the only important part of today....  I had this dream....  About my fiance....  and we were together....  and *censored censored censored*............................................................................................................................ etc. *Sings: I know I fell in love with the 8th world wonder oooohhh*.  *hehe* Lol... *smiles innocently* Honestly now, do you think I would ever type anything like that? And shame on you for assuming that I even meant anything like. My goodness, the jaded minds of some people. Always assuming such outragous things. *tsk tsk*. For all you know we could be reading the bible together. Lol... *hehe*.  Okay, so I have procrastinated long enough. I really do have to start my home work.

       I don't believe this.  I am just sitting here as memories flood through my head. My breath was completely knocked out of me.   But why? That was then and this is now. It shouldn't do this, not anymore.   But there is a difference that is also a similarity and that is I know the truth. I know the words suposedly unsaid and the thoughts that were sworn never to be thought.   I can't help but get cold and shakey when it comes back to the surface. But there again it is my own fault. I created a distance for protection, but even I know that no distance could supress it forever. No matter ho deep the ocean nor its width there is always a bridge that you can't destroy.  They say that ignorance is bliss, but I found it tiring. Seeing as it was full of unrestful sleep and tear filled days.  So which is worse? The knowing or the not knowing?  Both are sharper than any blade created, and both do more damage than any physical weapon imagined.  What filled my days then was wonderence and confusion and, of course, false hope. And what now? Complete humiliation, embarrasement, dibelief, and pain.  There is such a painful price to pay for being untrusting and questionable. But deeper is the price we pay for trusting, loving, and being honest at heart. And I have learned this lesson well I fear.  Even with the pain of the deeper lesson, though, it was all worth it.  Through all that which has killed me brought the one thing that has given me life.  My angel, my prince, and the love of my life.  So it arose again. So what! I won't let it destroy the future I am planning with my love.  Then it never had to do anything to destroy me. And now it didn't have to do anything to knock the wind from inside me. But now it won't win! Now, for once, I have the final say.  For my life and my love, bill you are all that matters.  And on this note I go to bed.  P.S. Nope I never did study.

       Okay so I just made this blog.  I am extremely happy right now. I get to see my fiance in in one week and two days and I can't wait. We just got off the phone and the mere sound of his voice makes everything feel perfect. I swear just thinking about him makes me so high an apocolypse couldn't bring me down.  I have been extremely depressed all day. But right now i don't feel a single thing except for complete contentment.  I am in love with the most wonderful man on earth. My life couldn't be better.   I should be studying right now for my test in Government tomorrow, but all my cares are currently gone. Right now everything just seems perfect and extremely distant.  *hehe* I sound like I am high, that is okay I feel like I am high (in reality I have no clue what that would actually feel like because I have never done anything in the such). But I can't help it he makes me so happy.  I wish I had enough words to describe how much I love him and how much he means to me. But there aren't enough words in the world to describe it, and even if there were there wouldn't be enough air in the universe for me to say even half of them.  Okay, so we have been engaged for 3 months (in two hours well will have been) and I love hime dearly (obviously). I haven't seen him since April because we live in two different states. But next weekend he is coming to see me and I couldn't be happier.  Oh, how I can't wait to wrap my arms around him. When I am with him it feels like the warmth of the sun is forever around me, inside me. Heaven must be very dim because has given his brightest angel.  geez. I better get to homework or else I will be screwed tomorrow, and my friend is online.

      ED ED ED ED ED ED ED..... ahhhhhhhh...  I swear that is all I ever hear about anymore. So what I may have an eating disorder. It isn't like anyone around me really cares. They all use it as a way to get attention for themselves. Except for Bill of course. He cares, he loves me, and he loves the way I look. I have never felt comfortable with myself in anyway, but Bill changes all of that. For once in my life I don't feel like  total reject. I love him so much.  Everyone can yell at me about what to eat. SCREW ALL OF THEM! They have no clue what this is like or how hard this is for me. All they do is pass judgement, but they have no clue what it feels like to be judged. It makes me so angry at them. They don't care what happens to me. All they care about is how I make them look.  I am so begining to hate seeing my psychologist. I have so much I need to talk about, but I don't know how to with anyone. So much that I need help with, advice on. And she won't discuss any of it. All she wants to do is talk about my having ED, which she won't even classify me with until I am under weight and in the hospital. Which I am very close to. But all the other things I need advice on she won't even consider. I'm so locked inside myself I'm clausterphobic, and she won't help me. But maybe that is just my own fault. Maybe I am just to damaged to ever be helped.  Bill is coming in two days. He will be here on Saturday. I can't wait. I love him so much.  Ugh... I swear my family needs to grow up.  Everyone is throwing a fit over one thing or another and no one is getting along. Now no one is getting together for The Fourth of July, and I know it is all my fault. If I didn't exist my family would be so much happier.  But you know what?  None of them matter!  They can throw what ever fit they want. Bill is the only thing I care about.  Surprisingly my mom is still arranging a picnic for that day. She wants to try and get to Bill a bit more. So I am hoping for the best.  I was so bored I cleaned my house today. What would have taken my mother all day took me less than 2 hours.  But I think i have overdone it a bit. I am so out of breath and my chest has been hurting pretty badly all day.  I don't get it. If the doctors are really so afraid that my heart will stop and so concerned about all the other things going wrong with me why is no one doing anything!  My legs are going numb, my heart is slowing down, now my saliva glands are begining to shut down, and so much more. I am taking a really disgusting medicine to help my glands. The taste of that stuff oughta kill me! Providing everything else doesn't first.
