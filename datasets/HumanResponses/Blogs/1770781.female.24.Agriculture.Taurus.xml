      GAMEDAY!!!   Just got back from walking around campus through the tailgaters.  Saw some Californians that looked mightly hot.  Actually, its a pretty nice day today, for Auburn weather.  Theres a slight breeze, and its cool in the shade.  Sometimes that is not the case.  Game starts at 5 pm, less than four hours.  Woohoo!!!  Drumline exhibition should be around 3:30, and I'm not missing that, at least not for the first game.  Go AU Drumline, yo!     Ran into my cousin tailgating, too.  He's lookin' for tickets, but I don't know if he's gonna find some at a decent price.  Popular game, this one.  My jerryrigged camera case is all ready to go.  Made it Thursday night, and I am quite pleased with myself.  Easy to carry, foam custom cut to hold my camera, three rolls of film, and extra batteries.  Hot damn!  Gameday, gameday, gameday!  I'm ready for the game to start, gameday!     War Damn Eagle!!!  Let the game begin!  (and Lord, let us win. . .)

      The days are good.  I'm in Auburn, finishing off a nice Italian wine, digesting a lovely dinner of samon steak and asparagus that we cooked ourselves, and my back is being rubbed; gameday is tomorrow, war damn eagle.  The days are good.

      Damn near Game Day!!!   In 30 minutes, I'm gettin ready to head down to Auburn, Renton in tow.  Football, football, football!  Woohoo, it's been a long time since January 1st.  Football, football, football!  FOO'BALL!!!  I am not excited. . . (foo'ball!)   What's better than football?  Why a three-day Football weekend, of course!  Any extra day in Auburn is a happy day for me, unless there be Gator fans.  Which there won't be this year; we're not playing them!  Thank God for small favors.   I've been playing volley-phone with assorted plant nursery companies in the area.  I hate talking on the phone to people I don't know (though some of these people should be beginning to know me quite well by now).  I know I sound stupid on the phone, but at least these people have Southern accents, too, so it's not too bad.  But talk to some yankee, though, and boy do they think you're stupid.     Oh yeah, funny thing of the day (so far)!  I had a duck-fart this morning!  Gettin' out of the shower, towelin' off, go to blow my nose, butt's not dry yet but that don't matter, begin to blow nose, concentrate muscle use in diaphram area, muscles relax in other areas. . .QUACK!!!  For a second, in my half-asleep state, I truly thought there was a duck in my midsts, before I realized it was just my own, still-wet ass.  Man, I laughed so hard. . .   quack!

      Almost GameDay.   I went to Wal-Mart today.  Whoppie.  I hate wal-mart.  Man, if it wern't for the decent prices, the close proximity to my apartment, or the mass quantities of different kinds of the same stuff, I would never go there.  What could be worse than wal-mart?  Making a fool out of yourself in wal-mart.  We've all done it.  Me more than once.  All my friends know "The Wal-Mart story," involving me, some bad chinese food, a wal-mart toliet that doesnt flush, and a butch lady that vows she can fix it.  Its a great story, except for the embarassing parts.     Today wasn't nearly as bad as "The Wal-Mart Story,"  but still dumb.  Everyone's done this, too.  Saying hey to someone you know, then right after you say it, realizing you dont know them from Madam's housecat.  That's what I did.  I saw this lady that I thought was the lady that comes by and cleans the office once a week.  Nice lady.  Figured I'd try to step away from my normal anti-social self and acknoledge her.  'Course, once I did, I realized it wasn't her at all.  I think I'll just stick with being anti-social from now on.  That way I won't do stupid stuff like that.  So if you see me in passing, and you wonder why I don't say anything, it's not that I'm mad at you.  I'm just not sure if you're the real you that I see, and I'm not taking any chances.   I saw the worst thing today.  Ever been to www.freakhole.com?  Don't.  And don't click on the Gross pictures.  And especially don't click on the one about the organ donation one.  Right before lunch.  Don't.  DONT.   And with that, I gotta run.  I gotta wash clothes, wash Renton, and jerryrig a camera case for the game on Saturday.  Yee-ha.

      Hahaha, I'm back to using a template that someobody else wrote.  Changed back in less than 24 hours, too.  Why, do you ask?  I figured out that, though my profession is in the field of design, I gotta know a hell of a lot more HTML stuff before I can make a template that I'll be satisfied with.  I wanna customize, and have neat, odd add-ons, and I am not knoledgeable enough right now to do that solo.  So here's to open-source! {eats some crow}   Now, on to the life at hand.  I got Renton back this morning!  I was so glad to see him, but he was even more glad to see me.  He wouldn't let the nurses get him out of the cage, so they got me to come get him.  Once he heard my voice he perked up gave an excited meow.  I felt so loved!  The nurses said he had been pretty good, and he stayed close to his Otter at all times.  They were amused.  Maybe the Otter has forgiven Renton for all the sexual abuse.  Maybe Renton forgave the Otter for just looking so damn sexy all the time.   Close to Game Day!  I'm going to try to find Renton a kitty Auburn t-shirt while I'm there.  Too bad he can't come to the game with me.  He'd be confiscated for being a potentially Terrorist object.     And now if you'll excuse me.  I need to learn an assload of HTML and related goodies, so I don't gotta use nobody's nothings.

      Bitchin'!  I made my very-own-one-of-a-kind weblog template!  True, a bit boring, and the HTML is certainly messy, but I made it, dammit!  Mine mine mine!  Now, I just gotta learn how to make the cool ones. . .  I'm on my very own tonight.  My Renton is still at the vet; he got neutered today.  They keep him overnight, and I can get him tomorrow morning.  I got to visit him this afternoon after the surgery; he looked extremely groggy.  I do miss him, even though he was able to drive me completely bonkers in the few hours this morning before I took him to the vet's.    Last night he figured out that he could jump up onto the kitchen bar area, it seems.  I came out of my room this morning, and right in front of my door was a single packet of Splenda.  Oh no. . .  As I stumble down the hall, I notice bits of things on the floor that should be in my purse.  A receipt here, lip gloss (without the top) there, checkbook splayed open with all the deposit slips surrounding it like so many innards.  Took me about 30 minutes to gather it all back up.  He knocked a plethora of things into the sink, including the TV Duck, still recovering from its' wounds with the last gato-a-ducko battle with Renton.  Half the stuff was under the couch, along with my cell phone, and my salt shaker that I had been missing since Friday.  Maybe he knew that I was about to take away all his fun hormones, and felt I needed dully punished.    Between the time I left for work and came back to gather him for the vet, Renton also felt it was in his best interest to knock down the coffee pot.  Of course, I didn't notice this until I was home for lunch, lamenting about my poor baby being away from his mommy.  After seeing the coffee pot, I wasn't lamenting quite so much.

      BellSouth still, unfortunately, sucketh.  I went and opened up a tripod account, and it actually load up the site in a decent amount of time.  BellSouth was taking about 5 minutes per page.  I'm not kidding, folks.  Amazing:  the free tripod is actually better than the BellSouth that comes with the DSL service that I pay out the wazoo for, 'cause I gotta have a phone line to go with it.  I'm looking into a wireless internet company that's in this area.  It's what we use at work, and they're really nice guys.  Better than Your-Call-Wait-Is-Estimated-At-Eight-Minutes BellSouth.  A pox upon them!

      Ahhh, I finally got rid of those evil frames on the work website.  Now I can breathe easier; they were haunting me all weekend.  So let's see, today I totally redid the work website and designed, inked out, and copied a design, too.  Very productive day for a Monday.  All right, now I just gotta figure out how to better organize my work web stuff so I won't have to go through that whole overhaul thing.  Maybe use some CSS sheets or something.  'Course, making it a bunch of CSS sheets requires, you guessed it, overhauling the entire site.  Maybe when Ive got some down time.  Less than a week till foo'ball!!!  Woohoo!  Less than 24 hours and Renton will be nutsless.  Woohoo again, cause I dont know if the otter can take much more abuse.

      Okay, quick post, while it's still the date that it is, so it all works out.  My sister's engaged, finally!  Cool bloody boogers!  She's very excited.  I've known her new fiance for about 11 years, and its weird to think that he is going to be my brother in law now.  Cool beans.  I need to get a counter for her wedding now, too.  Yeah.  And I've gotta go see Mars.  It's very bright tonight, and 25 degrees above the horizon, to the southeast.  Can't see it from where I am now cause there's a few stragecially placed trees and a McDonalds in the way.  Chianti is good.

      Finally got Bellsouth's webpage thing to work.  Only took two weeks.  And, suprisingly, it wasn't their fault; has something to do with the router I was using the last two weeks.  Wasn't BellSouth's fault; it was mine.  Insert sheepish apologetic grin here.  So anyway, now I've got a webpage up.  Two things:  I've got the basic layout up, but no content yet, I just wanted to test it and make sure it worked; second thing, it is, for some nutty reason, a slow upload for the splash page.  Not my fault, they're low-size gifs, BellSouth's just got their hands on a slow server.  Get what you pay for. . . (or less, considering how much a month I'm paying for DSL and all that).  I'm gonna work on actually getting some actual stuff on the website this next week.  Right now I'm in Auburn and therefore seperated from all that is my computer.    I'm pissed at the work website.  I've decided I dont like frames, and I'm gonna get rid of 'em (and all the advanced guru web designers reading this, if any, think "'bout time, ganstabitch!  the late 90's called; they want their website back)  That's also on the agenda for next week.  Man I'm tired.  It's 23:43 (after 11 pm, yo), past my normal bedtime; yet I've had two caffienated diet cokes right in a row, and Steven and Ken are wrecking cars for points.  It shall not stop me, I will suceed in my quest for sleep.  I shall call him Squishy and he shall be mine.  Can you tell that it's late, no really can you?  And I just handed over my great grandmama's ring today to get it resized and oh god I hope they dont do anything bad with it cause half the family will come and personally kill me and I cant believe I gotta wait till the ninth of September and what if. . .awetrzryh  [BAM! falls asleep on keyboard]

      Since most of y'all know (and for the ones that don't know, here is a chance for enlightenment) that I'm an alumni of Auburn University (War Damn Eagle, mind you) I am looking forward to the football game versus The University of Southern California on Saturday week.  I like the Southern California fans, they were real cool last year, but my football-fanatic friend Willis sent me this article/post/musing and I had to post it.  Cheers, man.  Advice to USC fans coming to Auburn ...... --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Do not wear Gucci or Prada to the game. Wear your Cardinal and Gold paraphenalia like God intended. Make fun of our orange shirts and painted faces and we'll kick your A$$.   Do not bring calamari and champagne to the tailgate. Down in these parts we eat barbecue ribs, pork, hamburgers, hotdogs, fried chicken and tater salad. Make fun of our tailgate food and we'll kick your A$$.   Do not make fun of the way we talk. We do that on purpose so you can't understand what we are saying. We understand and that is all that matters. Make fun of the way we talk and we'll kick your A$$.  Yes we know we have beautiful girls. And their parts are REAL. Do not dare make fun of our women. Women are the backbone of Southern society. Our women can fish, pop a tent, landscape a yard(  Do not dare drive if it rains. We know it doesn't rain in LA. Drive in the rain and stop traffic and we'll kick your A$$.   Do not make fun of our small town. We like it. We saw the slums in LA last year. This is God's country. Make fun of our small town and we'll kick your A$$.   Do not curse in front of our Bible believing blue-haired grandmothers or they'll kick some manners into your A$$ just like they did ours.   Do not make fun of Aubie. He's won 5 National Championships. Make fun of our mascot, and we'll kick your A$$.   Do not order cous-cous, tilapia, or a Greek Salad at the Cracker Barrell in Opelika. Stick to something they know. Confuse them and they'll kick your A$$.   Do not call us backwards. We are not deprived of technology. Have we ever run out of electricity? You did. Make fun of our technology and we'll kick your A$$.   Do not call us stupid. Do Faulkner, Grisham, and Tennessee Williams ring a bell? We're very smart. We WANT you to think we're stupid so we can laugh at you behind your back. Call us stupid and we'll kick your A$$.   Yes we know "Eye of the Tiger " WAS from Rocky and frankly we don't care. Make fun of our songs and we'll kick your A$$.   Yes we have flags, magnets, tiger tails, and other paraphernalia on our cars. And yes, we shake our shakers so hard and so long that our arms are about to fall off. But so what? We saw that dead pit you call a stadium in LA. Make fun of our school spirit and we'll kick your A$$.   And last but not least, do not DARE say anything bad about Bo Jackson, Pat Sullivan, Pat Dye, or Shug Jordan. Make fun of those four people and you will be sent home in a pine box minus your A$$.   And since this is all in good fun....MAKE SURE you come to Auburn and have a darn good time. Come to Auburn and NOT have a good time, and we'll kick your A$$!   ---posted by oldtiger60, says Willis

      I got to see my great great great great grandfather's grave last weekend.  Pretty neat.  We had an impromptu family reunion last Saturday, so I got to go to Ozark, Alabama.  I also found out that Bill Clinton is my 4th cousin, once removed.  Neat stuff.  I was tromping through old graveyards with my dad and his cousins.  So if you were in Ozark on Saturday, you would have seen a sight:  a Carrie, Jerry, Terry, and Kerry walking about, one of them in a dress and high heels.  There's a Larry, too, but he's in Alaska.  Renton gets neutered next Tuesday; he was having too much fun with his stuffed otter last night.  That poor otter; it's been through so much.  I should wash him, he has been chewed on to no end.  I feel tired.  I need coffee. . .  Whoa, today is the 20th.  Just four months, yo

      Thing that made me do my laugh-so-hard-could-not-breathe-for-five-minutes routine:  With Mom and my fiance (visitin the homeland) in a car in Winn-Dixie parking lot, and Mom sees a guy walking by, and goes, "Man, he's hot."  Steven and I are speechless until we realize she meant heat-hot, cause the back of his shirt was wet (eww) So I go into peals of laughter.  You probably would have had to been there, and you probably also would have to have been wired crazy like me.    The thing before that that made me do my laugh_so-hard-could-not-breathe-for-five-minutes routine?  It was from a movie, and I quote:  "He's nuttier than squirrel turds"   That laugh really hurt.  Time to go to bed.  Have to get up at four-something in the morning, butt-crack of dawn, even.

      Changed my background again.  No more Renton.  I know, I know, I can't help it.  I'm indecisive.  I'll just quit mentioning when I change it now, since I seem to change it daily.  Hey, that's an idea:  set one up that changes daily to some random picture.  Yee-ha!  Speaking of Renton the Vicious, guess who was messing with the blinds again?  I thought I had drilled it into him how incredibly wrong that is.  (Renton=cat, cat=vicious, vicious=Satan, so therefore Renton=Satan, unless he's being nice)

      BellSouth still makes me mad.  I just want to get my free-with-our-DSL-service website set up, that's all I ask.  It keeps tripping up at the last step for some crazy reason.    So, my fiance graciously offers me use of his webspace (also on BellSouth) that he set up months ago, back when BellSouth worked.  Allright, cool beans, here we go.  So I've got everything in order, get his FTP info, and begin to upload.    Yay, the little bar is moving, here we go.    Then, halfway though, it loses contact with BellSouth!  Nooooooooo!  I gesticulate wildly and give the computer the finger.  I try going to their webpage and it's down too.  BellSouth just had a huge, massive cyberfart.  Or maybe,  maybe , I caused the host to crash while uploading.  Thats my one thought that I cherish from this whole website fiasco.  I hacked BellSouth and caused it to crash.  The best kind of hacking:  inadvertent hacking.  Evil laugh:  mwahahahahha!  It's a very pleasing thought.

      Ha, look what I did!  I borrowed (plagarised) a blogger skin!  Mwhahahahaha!  Maybe someday I will be able to create my very own!  Steven helped me figure things out too, so yay for Steven, because he understands code!  In my defense, I didn't really plagarise, this person created it for the intent that other people might use it.  See, I'm not an all-bad person, just semi-bad.  And it's not like I'm not creative, I just gotta learn me some HTML, or more of it, anyway.  Just messing around with this stuff is a much better teacher than reading from a book (wow, I cant believe I just said that, me, the book-nut, claiming a book did not serve it's intended purpose!  I guess computer stuff is different. . . though I dont know where I'd be without my Macromedia Dreamweaver book. . .)

      Almost time to go home from work, in between project stuff, so to kill 10 minutes, an errant thought:  Ever get confused as to what season it is?  Winter instead of summer, and that sort.  It is barely 80 degrees here, and it feels like 70.  In August?  In Alabama??  It's like October outside!  Someone has signed a pact with the devil.  Glad it was somebody else, and not me.    And maybe later on I'll give a background of myself, a my-life-in-one-paragraph sort of thing, just so I can say I introduced myself and all.  But not here, I'm working. . .

      Dance dance dance!  Auburn won last week, 48 to 7.  (I'm just gonna type out the score lazy-like from now on; I'm tired of drawing up the score all cool and making a link, yada yada).  Anyhoo, yay!!! And yes, I know it was just western Kentucky, but us Auburn fans are hard-up for victories.     I really don't like spiders.  Apparently Renton doesn't, either.  I came out of my room one morning to find no less than three huge half-eaten spider carcasses in the dining room.   Eww, I don't know what's worse, knowing those kind of spiders are in my apartment, or knowing my cat kills and ingests them for fun.     That's one thing I've noticed about Fort Payne; they have a bunch of interesting, different bugs.  Nope, not your normal houseflies and mosquitoes for this town.  It is like Entomology 101 outside my apartment door.  As I type, outside my door there lies a dead walking stick, cicada, grasshopper, beetle, various gnats, and a dead bird that the neighbor's cat contributed, but that doesn't count.  At least they're dead.  The spiders in my apartment are alive and kicking, until they meet up with Renton the Spider Killer.

      Damn near GameDay!  Woohoo, it's about time.  Last week was an off-week, so I had to make do with watching the Tennessee/Florida game and the LSU/Georgia game.  Speaking of which, stupid Georgia!  It was hard to pick which one I wanted to lose in that game.  At first I was pulling for LSU (cause Georgia needed to lose), until Cathy pointed out that it would be better for Auburn if LSU lost, since they are in SEC West w/ us, whereas Georgia is in SEC East.  Alright, pulling for Georgia.  I figured they'd win anyway.  Stupid Georgia lost!  The one time we needed them to win something, they lost!  They probably did it on purpose, too.  I bet they thought, "Now, what would be the worst thing for Auburn?  Us losing?  Okay, let's do that.  Anything to piss Auburn off."  Thanks a lot Georgia; see ya in November.   So this old acquaintance of mine showed up the other day, out of the blue.  Haven't seen him for four and a half years; I had figured he would never show up again.  How wrong I was.  He used to show up more often, usually around holidays, birthdays, or times when I had to go somewhere.  Quite annoying, really.  He'd just come on in, say hey how ya doing haven't seen you in a while, and proceed to move right on in.  But, like I said, I haven't seen him in quite a while, and had hoped I'd seen the end of him.  That's what I told everybody who asked; he wasn't coming back.     I have almost completely forgotten what it's like with him here, and I regret to say that sometimes, back when I thought he wouldn't show up again, I had slightly wished he would, just to remind myself how it was.  I truly couldn't remember what it was like; I thought surely it wasn't that bad.  Couldn't have been that bad.  Now I'm suffering the consequences of 'be careful what you wish for, it might come true,' and it sucks, and I just want to get to Auburn, and then I'll worry about him.  I can tolerate him 'till I get to Auburn, just let me get there.     Anyway, like it or lump it, he's here again, and I can't wait to get rid of him.  Until then, I might as well be nice. . . so welcome back, Asthma, long time no see, and would you please get the f*** outta my life.   Thank you.   And now, off to Auburn I go I go.  Haven't been to the stadium since the ill-fated USC game.  GameDay makes everything better; always remember that.  And I will feel good and we will win and it will not rain; always the optomist am I.

      My phone rang this afternoon.  I go to look at the Caller ID, and don't recognize them; it's a local number.  I figure I'll just let ye olde answering machine get it.  The answering machine picks up, and before my recorded voice even has a chance to utter one syllable, the person on the other line goes, "Is Tina there?" then hangs up.  "Hmmph," I think, "she didn't even get to hear my really great message."     Well, not two minutes later, the phone rings again.  Same person.  This time, they do hear the message, which says, "Hi, you've reached Carrie's apartment.  Tina does not live here anymore.  I do not even know who Tina is.  If you want to leave a message for Carrie Paulk, please leave a tone after the message."   In case you didn't notice, I get calls for Tina a lot.  Mostly bill collectors.  Anyway, the person on the other line hangs up again, leaving no message.  "Hahaha, I finally got to hear my message in action," I muse.   Two more minutes, and the phone rings again.  Surely not the same person, though, right?  Yep, one and the same.  Message plays again all the way to the end, then the prompt beep is emitted, and she says, "Wrong number," and hangs up.  Wrong number?? It took her three times to figure that out?  I worry about some people.     So what's the story about this Tina character?  She's obviously popular, and not just with the bill collectors.  This latest lady sounded like a friend.  Where did Tina go, and why did she not tell anybody?  There's the usual guesses:  she eloped with her cousin, she went into debt and is now on the run, she was attacked by rabid raccoons.  All equally plausible.  However, they're not colorful enough.  Here's what I think happened.     Tina, mother of eight children and wife of some guy wearing a wifebeater, was living a typical normal redneck life, and quite happy, thank you very much.  Well, mostly happy; she wished her husband didn't stink so much.  Sorta happy.  A little happy.  Oh, let's face it, she was downright miserable; come on, she had eight brats and a stinky husband!  So, after watching an episode of Matlock, which is a very educational show if you want to learn how to  almost  get away with it all, she whacked her husband on the head with a bunch of socks from the local mill that were starched together to create a vicious sock-bat, which killed him dead right then and there.  Then, one by one as they came back inside from playing in the storm sewer, she whacked all of her kids as well.  In the dead of night, she buried them all in shallow graves in the chert pit north of town.  She knew they wouldn't be missed, as her husband was unemployed, and she wouldn't let her kids near that new fangled thing they call a school.  The perfect crime.   The next day, she cancelled her power bill, newspaper subscription, and paid off the rest of her trailer, and took the rest of the money and headed north.  Way north.  She hitchhiked all the way to New York City, where she caught a plane to France; she read about their really nice beaches.  Once in France, Tina adopts a new name (she is now Teena), buys a hat, chair, and suntan lotion, and headed for the Riviera.  Now Teena, a widow, single and loving it, is sunning in the south of France, and is quite happy, thank you very much.  Well, mostly happy; nobody told her how much these French stank. . .   That's what I think happened to Tina.

      I figured I'd be creative with my dessert tonight.  But you know, I don't think apricots and cream work as good as peaches and cream.  It's like apricots. . . with these cold bits of stuff on 'em.  Well. . .I'll eat it anyway.  What the heck.  At least I didn't put chocolate syrup on it too.   Lately Renton has been chewing on everything.   Everything .  There are teeth marks in my lamp shade.  I'm thinkin, if I wanted an animal that chews on stuff and poops in the tub, I'd've gotten a nasty ol' dog.  Yesterday, when he started going after my great grandmother's quilt (I daresay I made mention of it in the last post), I thought enough's enough; time to investigate!  So after putting the quilt into the closet with all the other potential chew toys, I look up the prob on the internet.  On all the sources I found (and I found quite a few), they started out with statements like, ". . .it's a phase. . .they grow out of it. . . no worries".  Good, keep reading. . . then at the end of these oh so helpful paragraphs were phrases like, ". . . except for the Siamese breed. . . unless it's a Siamese. . . .Siamese have a tendency to. . ."  Yeah.  Siamese cats are known to have this penchant for chewing fabric stuff for  their entire life .  Oh.  Bloody.  Boogers.  I'll be hiding sweaters and pillows for twenty years.

      Whew, I'm worn out.  Not physically, just mentally.  I've actually been working on my home website these past couple of days; finally got a few more things done with it.  I got some stuff up for  urlLink Renton's section , and even a few pictures, though they're just haphazardly slapped on there.  I'll beautify it later.  I also got some stuff up in the  urlLink Thoughts  section.  For all you Thompson band peeps, good news!   urlLink Bubbettisms  are online there!  Bubbett quotes have gone digital.  Good lord.   Renton has given up on red sweaters.  He's graduated to my great-grandmother's quilt now.  Good thing I caught him early.  He had to satisfy himself with paper towels.  What is with this cat?  Steven thinks he doesn't get enough fiber.  I think I need to give him some Trident and see what happens.

      I just gave Renton the Cat a bath.  He's off sulking and cleaning himself the old-fashioned way, apalled I would do such a thing to his fine fur coat.  At least he tolerates baths; I am lucky in that.     Long before I even got Renton, I had a vision of how my cat (I knew someday I was gonna get another cat) was going to be.  There was a list of things it was going to do, or not do.  Let's see how Young Renton compares:  Going to be Siamese -- bingo on that, I did manage to find a Siamese  Going to be named Splat -- I was nixed on this by my whole set of family, friends, and aquaintances; they said he'd be hit by a car or a steamroller, or fall out of a really tall window  Going to take a shower with me every morning, love water in general -- that's a no on the shower, and I don't think he likes water in general, but he does tolerate his weekly bath, so I give myself half credit on that one  Going to use the toliet, no litterbox for me -- Uhh, we're working on that. . . (half-credit)  Going to love everybody -- That's usually true, he hasn't met a stranger.  He does hiss at Willis, but I think he does that for kicks  Going to have his own little kitty room -- Kitty room??  He's taken over the whole house!  Going to travel well -- Yes, he does travel quite well; I'm always carting him off to Birmingham or Auburn   So that's a four out of seven, all total.  He didn't do too bad.  Of course, I didn't think about all the little pasttimes he would aquire, like eating red sweaters, knocking contents of my purse under the couch, and wreaking havoc on the kitchen counters.  Maybe that's just the price I'll pay for him to be toliet trained (come on, Renton, it's a simple concept. . .)   And now I must go.  Carrie the Counselor's job is never done. . .

      I forgot to include this with my weekend sum-up.  Oops.  I randomly remembered it while coloring a wax myrtle a lovely dark green this afternoon.   We're watching the game last Saturday, Auburn vs. Vanderbilt, eatin' pizza (with newspaper under us, so Mom doesn't throw us into the wall), and they go to a commercial break.  And on comes this commercial for Auburn as a university, a we're-part-of-the-future inspiration sort of thing.  And as it's going, here is how the conversation went (more or less):   Me:  Hey, that's the inside of Comer Hall!   Steven:  Band people!   Me:  Ahhh!  That's Dr. Hitchcock, my old English professor!   Both Me and Steven:  Hey that's Asian Brad!!!   Steven:  I know that girl, she's in one of my computer classes!   Mom:  So that's what Asian Brad looks like.   It was weird; every scene we knew somebody or something like that.  I was greatly amused.  Even more amused to see Asian Brad look all nice-kid and say something serious.  Wonder if they paid him anything.  Wonder if he was drunk.     At least we know they used real Auburn people, and not actors portraying Auburn people.  You gotta have the real thing, man.  And this commercial did.  Yay, and kudos.

       urlLink War Damn Eagle!   I never thought I'd be so excited over beating Vanderbilt, but I am, I am.  I'm so estatic that we did not lose!  Not only did we not lose, we creamed them.  Just ignore the mess that was the first quarter, and that was the team I knew from last year, penalties included.  We do like to seem to get quite a collection of those.  But who cares, we won!  Evil laugh:  Mwahahahahaha!  Football season has finally begun!  Can't believe I've gotta wait two weeks for another game.  I get to go to that one at least; it's at home.     And what did I do with my weekend?  Steven came up here to Forted Pain, and we went down to Birmingham on Saturday, so we could get some things done in the Big City.  Renton was left here, as his toliet training is still going frighteningly slowly.  We mostly had wedding errands to do.  Steven picked out his tuxes for himself and the groomsman (Willis, I'm sorry, you've gotta wear a Florida-orange tux), and I got the underthings for my dress (i.e. sexy lingerie, ha) and some shoes (I hope they work; shoe shopping sucks when you have a foot shaped as weird as mine, and all you want to do is be barefoot.  Or wear flip flops).  And we watched the first half of the game, and listened to the third quarter on the radio on the way to the mall.  War eagle, man.  And we ate, a lot.  Pizza for lunch and wings for dinner, and fried cheesecake for dessert.  Boy was that good; never woulda thought it.  All in all, a fun-filled Saturday.   Is thirty cents really all that much money?  I mean that won't even buy you a coke.  Thirty cents is something you find as you're cleaning underneath your bed, and (unless it involves a quarter) you just throw it away with the rest of the trash cause it's easier than finding a way to spend it.  Thirty cents is not much money.  Nevertheless, at the grocery store, Steven and I got behind some lady who thought otherwise.  She was buying some corn meal, a box of cereal, and something else that I cannot recall.  We only had a few things ourselves, and were ready to just go home.  As the lady in front of us is being ringed up, she notices a discrepancy on the visual computer-screen recipt.  "That rang up as $2.89," she says, "There's a sign by the cereal that said it was $2.59."  Oh no.  So the bag boy goes to check, while we wait.  He soon comes back, saying he didn't see a sign.  "Oh, I"ll show ya" says the lady, and goes off, taking the bag boy with her.  Maybe she is only carrying cash, and she truly doesn't have thirty cents.  I look at Steven and whisper, "Thirty cents?  I'd give her thirty cents."  But of course I don't have thirty cents; who carries money around anymore?  Not I, says the debit-card user.  Finally the lady and bag boy are back, having confirmed her thirty cent claim.  So now they gotta get the manager to stick her key in the register, type in some voiding code, and start over.  So they ring up everything just right this time, thank goodness.  "That'll be $4.85," says the check-out girl, and the lady hands over $5.85.  In cash.  So she can get a dollar.  It wasn't a matter of her having thirty cents at all.  Six minutes of running around looking for price statements and holding up lines for thirty cents that she already had.  Wow.  Somebody make her the Secretary of the Treasury; that'll solve the budget crap.  Save us thirty cents on a new aircraft carrier, just don't hold up the line to tour the Capitol while you're at it.

      Here's an interesting side note from the whole "RIAA Sues The World" saga (surely you heard they sued a 12 year old girl):   "Meanwhile, several internet music services have offered to pay the $2,000 (£1,255) fine paid by the mother of 12-year-old Brianna LaHara to settle the lawsuit the RIAA had filed against the girl.    Grokster president Wayne Rosso, a member of the peer-to-peer services trade group P2P United, said he felt the RIAA were acting like "bullies" by targeting a young girl, which is why it was offering to pay the money. " (source:  BBC)   This whole mess does make for interesting reading in the news.  Every day there's some new blurb someone said that either justifies or condemns the sharing of files, or a new lawsuit served out, protested, or settled.  And then there's that whole amnesty thing. . . please.    It seems to me that the RIAA might be hurting itself more than the people they're out to get, though.  They're suing these people in hope that they will become their customers again.  And man, the analogies are abound on this subject like RIAA subpoenas in courts.  The more I read them the more I figure you can make any analogy to suit your purpose.  RIAA says "you wouldn't steal a BMW because you thought the price was too high," and the file sharers spit back "yeah but you get to test-drive a BMW, and there are cheaper cars on the market."  Both sides make it a question of ethics, right and wrong, wwjd? and that sort of thing.  Well, wtfwjd?    I think the bare truth of it is it's just incredibly  easy  to get a music file for free off the internet.  Why get dressed and go out to hunt up some obscure CD when you can do a quick search for the file in your jammies?  Easy easy easy.  And cheap, which is always good for the college students.  More money for beer.  Simple as that man, not a matter of ethics, matter of convenience.  Just recently have there been some legitimate music services out there where you can listen to all the music you want.  You do pay money, yes, but it's cheaper than going the CD route.  For Mac users, there's Apple's I Tunes.  Well, that covers about 8% of the computer population.  Well done.  Right now I'm using a service called  urlLink Rhapsody .  Nine bucks a month or 25 bucks for three, listen to whatever you want (that they have, and might I add that their selection of film scores is lacking), and you can download for under a buck a song.  Best that I know of for Windows people right now.  However, the free stuff is still out there.  Why pay nine bucks a month when you can get it for free?  Where does it all end?  (Stop the internet please, I'd like to get off. . .)   The internet has instituted a whole new way of doing things, and there is no precedent.  It's changing the way we exchange information (for the better, I think), and we will have to change some ourselves to keep up.  Copyright laws included in that statement.  Now it's not only information we're exchanging now, its things like movies, music, computer programs, and pictures.  In other words, intellectual property, which can be very vague in definition anyway.  How in the world can you control use of this intellectual property when it's so easy to copy and distribute among the masses?  There is no clear answer as of yet, but one surefire way of not doing things is to go around like Big Brother, watching every move you do, waiting for you to do something 'against the rules.'  Read 1984.  It's just not right.   Not only can you partake of other people's intellectual property, now you can just as easily create your own.  With the internet, anybody, and boy do I mean anybody, can write songs, create art, write fiction, nonfiction, poetry, journals, whatever man, and publish it in the internet.  It's cheap, instantaneous, and anybody can do it.  It rules out the middle man entirely.  No publishers, managers, distributors, or (unfortunately) proofreaders.  The creator of all this stuff becomes all of these things, and therefore, they get more control.  Granted, there is a lot of absolute shit on the internet, and something like over half of it is porn, but those few shining stars do make their way out of the sludge.  Weird crazy stuff that you'd  never  see in mainstream.  There's the hilarious  urlLink All Your Base Are Belong To Us video thing , and  urlLink explodingdog.com , to name a few popular things in the internet culture.  I doubt this stuff could have come to the forefront of our culture through the snail-media (smedia, hahaha).   What it comes down to, is no middle man equals no RIAA and similar organizations, and I believe they know it.  I think this lawsuit crackdown is done out of desperation and fear, and possibly a little loathing.  A how-come-they-didnt-see-this-coming sort of thing.  I don't think anybody did.  The internet was originally just a group of researcher's computers, networked so they could more easily exchange stale, academia-style information.  And now, just look what has happened.  In just a short amount of time, too.  I don't believe it's the end of the world as we know it, like the RIAA would have us to believe.  They thought similar things with the advent of recordable cassette tapes.  This little snag will work itself out in the next three years, and some new revolutionary event will explode again.  Who knows what would happen next?  I can't even begin to imagine.

      On this day in 2001, it was a clear, crisp, sunny morning in New York City. Students were in their second week of school. People were getting to work in cars, buses, and trains. Alessandra Fremura had planned on leaving for work at 8:00, but her babysitter was 20 minutes late. Virginia DiChiara couldn't get her golden retrievers to come in from the backyard, so she decided to have another cup of coffee. Kenneth Merlo was supposed to go in the office, but he decided to spend the morning helping a friend hook up her computer instead of going to his office. Michael Lomonaco stopped in the lobby of the World Trade Center to order some reading glasses from the one-hour eyeglass store. Michael Jacobs was running late when he reached the Trade Center lobby. He rushed to make the elevator, but the doors slid shut in his face. A musician named Michelle Wiley was at home in her apartment. She sat down at her piano in her nightgown and shower shoes, and stared out her window at the Twin Towers before beginning to play.   This was in the Writer's Almanac for today.  I get the Writer's Almanac every day in my email; it's a nice thing to wake up to.  I like how they broached the subject of  today .  Doesn't say what happened, but we all know it.  It literally goes without saying.   I had the weirdest, most vivid dream last night, and I must write it down before I forget it.  In my dream, Crazy Governor Bush got this splendid idea to have every citizen in America carry these identification badges, called, oddly enough, muffins; he said it was for head-counting purposes in case of a terror attack.  They were black with a yellow star on them.  Yeah, like the star the Nazis had the Jews wear.  I didn't notice the connection 'till I woke up.  Anyway, we were required to have these 'muffins' with us wherever we went.  I thought it was a stupid idea, and so did my dad.  He didn't wear his at all, and so he was kicked off the beach, and also kicked out of an Auburn game.  My sister and mom wore theirs, and I had mine, but I had cut it so it was smaller and put it in my back pocket. Wonder what that means.  Maybe that dad is corageous, mom and my sister follow the rules, and I am a coward.  I dunno.  Anyway, the whole time I was thinking how stupid this is, and it doesn't make the public feel any safer knowing that our president was worried so much about a terrorist attack that he'd be thinking about head-counts in the case of one.  Besides, what if there not really for that at all, but for tracking purposes, like Big Brother.  At about that point, the badges turned into real muffins, strawberry ones, and I thought again what an idiot this man is, to think that no one would be able to resist eating their muffin!  They were warm and looked delicious.  Then I woke up.   Now where the heck did all that come from?  Wonder if it means anything?  Maybe it does, or maybe it was just the Melatonin I took the night before, which promises sleep but has a side effects of vivid dreams.  If it was the Melatonin, that is some good shit; give me some more.  Interesting dreams interest me to no end.  How interesting.

      Sorry about the link-fest I had going on those last few posts.  Every once in a while I find a link and post it up; these just happened to come in clusters.  They are neat links, though.  You should visit them, yo.   I was bad yesterday; I bought a DVD.  But I had to, this wasn't just any DVD, it was Disney's Sleeping Beauty Special Edition DVD.  Not only was this the first Disney movie our family owned (in VHS form; got it in 1985 or '86), this is one of  those  movies, one of the ones my sister and I know by heart, word for word.  This is her movie more than mine; I suppose mine is Disney's Robin Hood, which we also can recite.  But Sleeping Beauty, this was the first.  And watching it last night, hearing the words in my head the moment before they were spoken, recognizing the music note for note (I liked Tchaikovsky before I knew what 'Russian' meant), memories came flying through my head, if you could really call them memories.  It was more like feelings, sensing a different point of time.  I was back in first grade, in the living room in Alabaster, laughing with my sister as we skated across the carpet, using the torn-in-two Sleeping Beauty VHS case for skates.  I was behind the Brown Chair, too creeped out to watch the part where Mileficent comes out of the fireplace, only her eyes showing.  We were playing with the remote, rewinding 'that scene' over and over again, just to watch Merriwether take the peanut  out  of her mouth instead.  It was a bit fuzzy, and would have those lines running through the picture as you rewound it, but we saw through those lines to the humor of it.     Of course, with this newer DVD technology, not only can you go backwards, frame by frame crystally clear, you can take still pictures of a frame and save it on your computer for later photoshop fun, or even record bits of the movie, just those funniest scenes, to watch again and again.  Record sounds for your computer, so "Good gracious!  Who left the mop running?" blares out of your speakers when Windows has that inevitable error.  It's amusing, and you laugh, but its not quite the same as when you were six, with your sister laughing beside you, watching the film for the fourth time that day.

      Just would like to say a quick hey there and hello (how redundant) to my parents; I just found out that my dad, who must have been bored one day, Googled my name, and came up on my blog thing.  So hi; welcome to my place on the web where I talk a lot, cuss more, and bitch about Fort Payne drivers (see previous post, ha).  And I would like to take this time to confess that, yes, I am. . .a crackwhore.  And yes, I was. . .just kidding.  And Renton ate my fantasticly cheap wal-mart red sweater; he might find himself wearing red himself soon, once I beat him.  Yes, I am just kidding again.     And a side announcement, I have pictures up of  urlLink people I know !  And now, the people I know are either amused (Steven, Jason) or have had their feelings hurt because they take everything so personally (Willis).  And I know he'll be hurt by that statement, too.  And that one.  And it just goes on and on and on . . .

      I was on the hunt today.  All week for the work website, I was planning this week's Tip of the Week to be about soil testing, 'cause more of you crazies should do one before you go sticking plants willy-nilly into the ground.  Didn't write it up last Friday, 'cause hey, I already knew what the subject was gonna be, and that's the hardest thing for me to do, sometimes.  Of course, this Monday morning (just like last Monday morning, actually), the internet service was down at work.  Wasn't back up 'till after lunch, when I was finally able to fish out the information I needed.  I wound up going downtown to the DeKalb County Extension Agent's office near the courthouse, walking down the street in my high heels.  I got about fifty testing kits and assorted literature from them, for free.  The Government worked for me today!  I'm walking back past the courthouse, arms loaded with papers and insta-fold boxes, and I think, "I sure do put in a lot of work for the Tip of the Week."  But it's fun; I like the research, and the writing, too, oddly enough.  That's why you should go  urlLink read it , dammit.  Don't let my work be in vain.  I walked two blocks in high heels for this free tip I'm givin' you!   For a smaller town in Alabama, one would think Fort Payne wouldn't crash and burn if the power went out city-wide.  Yep, one would think.  Power went out here at the office at about lunchtime.  That, plus the continued absense of the internet, was making me think someone did not want me to work today.  So I head home for lunch, and realize, when I get to the light, that the power must be out everywhere; the light isn't working.  Now, according to Alabama law, in times of power outages, all intersections w/ lights become four-way stops.  And, also according to Alabama law, the vehicle that gets to go first is always the horse and cairrage.  No joke here; this is true.  However, since there were no horse and cairrages to be found in the vicinity, I suppose everyone else thought, all at once, "No horse and cairrage?  Then it's  MY  turn!"  Cars were going through the intersections, not even slowing down, assuming they had the right of way, because if the lights were on, surely  they  would have the green signal.  Four-way stops apparently mean nothing to these people.  I almost got hit twice, while trying to left turn onto a four way highway full of idiots.   I had another idiot behind me on my way back from lunch.  The city had calmed down, now that the power was back on (thank God).  However, there was this one person who seemed to still harbour some anger leftover from that lunch hour fiasco, and they were behind me, irritated that I would dare go only five miles over the speed limit, and there was nowhere that they could pass.  How dare I commit such an atrocity towards them?  She (I think it was a she) was riding my ass all the way to the office.  That unnerves me, and I let her know it.  Knowing my office was coming up, I waited 'till the last second to suddenly slow down, and put on my signal, and turn.  Woohoohoo, she did not like that.  Honked at me and gave me the finger, she did.  I showed her mine (though I don't think she saw it), and laughed all the way to my desk.  God forbid she gets to where she's going five minutes later than she would have had I not been in her way.  Bitch.   Now the cat poop thing that I so briefly mentioned in my last post.  I don't know if I've mentioned this, but I am in the process (long, messy, drawn-out process) of toliet-training Renton, the Litter-Flinger Extrordinaire.  For a while, his litter box has been on the toliet, and at the beginning of last weekend, we got to the part where you remove the litter box completely and cover the toliet bowl (under the seat) with cling wrap and add a bit of litter to it.  Big step, probably most strategic step of the entire nasty process.  After doing this on Friday morning, Renton did not pee or poop until Saturday night.  Got a bladder of steel, he has.  He was probably irritated at me.  But he finally did pee, in the litter that was on the plastic wrap that was covering the bowl.  Hey, that reminds me of that song, "Leaf of the twig, and the twig on the branch, and the branch on the tree, and the tree in the hole, and the hole in the ground, and the green grass grew all around all around, and the green grass grew all around"  except it goes "Pee in the cat and the cat on the seat and the seat on the litter and the litter on the plastic wrap and the plastic wrap on the water and the water in the toliet and the hot pee swished all around all around and the hot pee swished all around!"  Ha ha.  Anyway, Steven and I were so happy that he peed on the toliet that we didn't even care that he had figured out how to open up the cabinet doors, and was in one.  Those doors are taped now. . .   And the booby-trap comment that I made yesterday.  This one also concerns Renton.  I think Steven and I should patent this idea.  See, Renton has decided it's great fun to get on the counters and see what he can knock off.  Cat food, coke cans, antique bird pepper shakers. . .and I'm thinking that's gotta stop.  But he's clever enough to know not to get on the counters when I'm there, but he can do it when I'm nowhere to be found, no problem.  So on Friday night Steven and I are lamenting over this problem.  After using some clear packaging tape (the good stuff) to secure that plastic wrap to the toliet, we think that the tape might have more uses.  We try laying a long piece of tape along the edge of the counter, folded over on itself, so maybe the stickiness would deter Renton.  Nope, he hopped right over it.  Damn.  Then we start making jokes about how funny it would be to leave huge pieces of tape sticky end up and he'd get tape all over his little self, head to toe, like a mummy.  We crack up laughing, then stop, and go "hmmm. . ."  We change the 'huge pieces of tape' to smaller, 1" square versions, which we painstakingly scatter on the bathroom and kitchen counters.  We then leave Renton be, and go to get ready for bed.   It didn't take five minutes.  We hear a kitty collar bell ring with the effort of Renton jumping up, then, at the tacky sounds of tape attacking a cat, the bell rings again as Renton scrambles down and settles outside my door; tape-like sounds again as Renton struggles to get these little invisible attackers off of his fur.  Laughing, Steven and I remove the rest of the tape off of him, and set up new tape where the previous ones had served their purpose (he had attracted all but four of the little wonders).  I've had the tape bits up for four days now, and sometimes there will be a place where the tape is missing, but Renton sure hasn't wanted to stay on the counters long enough to do any damage.  I figure maybe another week of tape everywhere, and he should have the idea.  My antique bird salt shaker is singing for joy.

       urlLink Bloody hell!   What is wrong with my team?  My poor Auburn people!  Why do we always fall so hard when we get so high, get a little bit of confidence and people begin to think hey, we may be good, then BAM!  we fall so flat on our faces we're picking chunks of grass outta our pores for weeks.  WTF   I'm tired and I wanna go to bed, but I've had more than one person say, dude, you need to update your blog, so here I am.  I'm proud of myself; I've been working on that website of mine.  I put a few pictures on the  urlLink Art  section, and got a bunch of stuff up at the  urlLink People I Know  section.  Been a lotta work, and I'm gonna reorganize the People section so's the links are easier to find.   I did have an interesting weekend, filled with cat poop, booby-traps on the kitchen counter, and cool picture developments, but I am oh so tired.  You can wait 'till tomorrow, I know y'all can.  I know my life is grand and wonderful *cough*bullshit*cough*, and everybody wants to hear about it*cough*conceited*cough*, but the anticipation until tomorrow will be fun.  Trust me.

      Damn near Gameday!!!   Auburn plays Georgia Tech tomorrow at 2:30 pm.  I'm guessing that's eastern time, I need to check that.  I'll be listening to the radio; cancelled my cable last week ($45 a month when I watch TV maybe an hour a day is too much friggin' money).  Hope we win this one, or we will be the laughing stock of the NCAA.  We almost already are. . .   Cold front pushed through yesterday; highs in the low 80's today.   It felt nice this morning, a bit cool even.  That's the only good thing about today so far.  That and it's Friday, and it's damn near gameday.  Renton deprived me of my last ten minutes of sleep this morning.  Then the guy upstairs was blasting country music.  Renton, not to be upstaged (and who refuses to take the next step in toliet-training), knocked over his litterbox.  Thank you for that, cat.  After that lovely bit of moning, I came to work, and made some coffee.  Coffee fixes all.  Unless you take a swig, feel something in your mouth, think, "Dang, that's a big coffee ground. . ." and spit it out, only to find it's some grey bug thing.  So even my coffee was ruined this morning.  I shoulda stayed in bed, me thinks.

      Yesterday was a good day.  It was the first day this season that it felt like autumn.  You always remember that first day it felt like autumn, don't ya?  I usually tend to notice that moment.  I was sitting on the front porch of Phyllis, my client, and she was telling me about how her father taught her and her siblings how to dance.  I mean really dance, like ballroom dancing, fun stuff like that.  Phyllis always tells great stories.  Gorgeous day, wind was blowing, high cottonball clouds in the sky, and I get a whiff of the air, and thought, "Fall!"  There, right there, at that moment, it felt like autumn.  Fantastic, I think, soon I can wear a jacket.  I always look forward to when I can wear a jacket.     I think I have a jacket fetish.  Or something.  I don't like shopping for clothes, I don't really care what kind of clothes I wear as long as they're comfortable and are reasonably decent, but nevertheless, I think I could own every jacket in the world and still not be content.  It's like how some people are with shoes.  No shoes, just jackets for me, thanks.  It is a rather odd thing; here it is, barely September (and in Alabama, where it is normal to have hot days into late October, early November) and I'm looking at jackets.  Saw this great curdoroy jacket at the Gap today (which is a store I do not usually buy things in, except their perfume, and one bottle of that has lasted me almost four years, and still going strong).  I wanted that jacket.  Nevermind that I've got ten others in my closet.  Nevermind that it was $68.  They also had a jean jacket I want.  Nevermind I already own a jean jacket; I want that one!  That's why I should live in England; jacket-season 10 months out of the year.  I was there in July once;  wore a jacket.  I loved that jacket, the green one that had a real soft feel and a detachable inner liner.  It's too big for me now; I shrunk in the wash.  I bought that jacket with the first newly-designed $100 bill that I had seen.  I got that thing in high school.  Great jacket.       I wish it would get cold soon.

      Allright, except for the game, I did have a decent weekend.  Just erase that horrible Saturday from my mind, and it was cool.  Except for Sunday, too, when I wasn't feeling good.  But other than that, weekend was great!  I did have Monday off, after all.     War Eagle, dammit.  I ain't no fairweather fan.  War Damn Eagle, yo.   Woohoo, it's September!  Now I can look forward to the days slowly, ever so slowly, getting cooler.  Gonna be in the 70's here on Saturday, yessir!  I'm ready to bring my jean jacket back into the world, and to be  urlLink cold  at football games.

      I have an apology to make.  It's quite shocking, but I feel that once it's out in the open, it will be better for all of us in the long run.  Okay, deep breath, here we go . . . wait for it. . .  It's Steven's and my fault that Auburn lost to LSU on Saturday.  Yes, yes, I confess, we are to blame!  I feel so ashamed.  We didn't mean for it to happen, honest.  We would never want our Auburn to lose, yet it is our fault for the 40-something to 7 fiasco.  What did we do, exactly?  I remembered to wear my Aubie pin, but Steven  forgot to wear his orange gameday shirt .  Ohhh, the shame; I feel so guilty.  Steven's worn his shirt every game this season (to the best of my knowledge), and since the first two game horrors, I've worn my Aubie pin.  But on this crucial gameday, our minds apparently wandered, most likely because we were drawn into the Pillowfight Grudge Match that was Alabama versus Tennessee.  We forsaked our team for five overtimes and a green shirt.  We're both going to Auburn Hell (otherwise known as Tuscaloosa).  Because of our actions, Steven and I both apologize profusely for our behavior last Saturday, and for causing all Auburn Tiger fans so much grief and shock.  Believe us when we say we are truly sorry.  We would also like to send our apologies and condolences to Tommy Tuberville, the whole football team and staff, and the guy that sent out all those postcards promoting Cadillac for Heisman.  Sorry for the wasted postage.  Please forgive us.  We'll do better next week.

      GAMEDAY!!!  An away game, though, so I shall have to watch it courtesy of ESPN.  We're playing LSU; very important game this year.  We're the underdogs in this one, so that works out good for us.  Man, it is going to be some game!  But I cannot be at Baton Rouge, and I don't think I'd wanna go if I had the chance.  I heard the stories from the veteran band members of what happened in 1997.  Nothing doing.  So instead, we're headed down to Birmingham for the day, gonna get some weddin' stuff done.  Yee-ha, road trip!  I've been on so many road trips this week. . .  But I did come across something very interesting in Fort Payne this week.  A used book store has opened up on the north end of town, right near my office!  Ohh, the book gods are singing it's praises.  I found this great old book from 1920 about public speaking that I just had to get.  In danger of sounding like an old fart, they sure don't make books like they used to.  The binding is still holding up well, the size and shape is perfect, and it opens up all the way, so you can hold it in one hand and it is perfectly willing to just lay prone and let you absorb the information.  It sits in your hand just like those old pictures you see of the posed academic looking up from a book, like he had been suprised by the painter.  That's my kind of book.

      I came across this on the internet today, and I was amused.  It's Fourty Things Never Said By Southerners.  However, there's quite a few of these I disagree with.  I think they should change the word 'Southerners' to 'Rednecks' or 'White Trash.'   I've posted it below, and I added some of my own comments.     40 Things Never Said By Southerners   40.

I wouldn't be suprised to hear some toothless guy wearing overalls say this nowadays. 26. I'll have grapefruit and grapes instead of biscuits and gravy.               *See above. 25. Honey, we don't need another dog.                *Dogs drool.  Cats rule. 24. Who's Richard Petty?                 *Uhh, racecar driver?  Or is he that singer, Richard Petty and the Heartbreakers?

I've got two cases of Zima for the Super Bowl.                      *I don't watch the Super Bowl.  Pro football is for boring cities with no cool college teams.   10.

      I've been either one or the other this week.  Sunday through this morning, I was a malfunctioning Carrie, having woken up sick in the middle of the night Monday (dude, I actually puked!  I don't puke. . .I messed up my record. . .), then most of the day Tuesday I had a bitch of a headache, because I didn't want to take my medicine for fear of reignighting my queasy stomach.  I slept from 3:30 that afternoon to 6:10 this morning, with a few brief moments of conciousness.  Then off to work, drove from here to Geraldine, to Crossville, then back the slow way through Geraldine to Rainsville with two big trees and a shrub in the back of my truck back to Fort Payne.  I got home a little after five, and I've been writing thank you notes ever since, cause w/ my not feeling good and all, I've fallen a bit behind.  I'm on a roll now though.  Go me go me go me.  But I'm gonna have to go to sleep early cause I'm going to McMinnville, Tennessee early tomorrow morning, and I gotta get up at the butt-crack of dawn.  So sorry folks, no amusing stories of little things in my life, for I am a Busy Carrie.  Later, this Busy Carrie will relate the story of Renton vs. Callie, Part Deux.  (Renton is a mean little scardey-cat, but an  interesting  mean little scardey-cat).  I'll also tell about the Cat Tree.  Good stuff, but for another day.    P.S.  WAR EAGLE we beat Miss State 40-something to 13ish.  Yee-ha.

      WOOHOO, IT'S GAMEDAY!  I'm down in Auburn, and gettin' ready to walk the campus.  We're gonna go by the bookstore and get some books (duh), and then we're gonna go by the alumni tent, because I have access, and I've forgotten every time this year so far that I've got the privledge to take part of cheap hot dogs, watered down drinks, and some horrible music entertainment.  But by graduating, I've gained the right.  So I'll try it out.  Renton had his first run-in with another cat last night.  Our friends Katie and Lisa recently acquired a calico cat, a cute little six month old named Callie.  So last night we all decide they should meet, they can play together and it'll be so nice and cute.  Uh huh.  Well, at least one side wanted to be nice and cute.  Callie seemed very willing to make friends.  Renton, however, seemed very willing to kill each and every one of us.  Except Callie; he seemed very threatened by this cute little ball of splotched fur that was half his size.  He tried to attack us humans, though, who are seven times his size.  Dude, this cat  growled .  He sounded like a Rottweiler.  Yep, that's my Renton:  the anti-cat.  He was one pissed off feline.  After thirty minutes of hissing, growling, biting, and sulking, we took him back to Steven's.    Granted, Renton was in unfamiliar territory, which gets him edgy anyway.  After the game we just might try it again, but this time in Steven's abode.  Maybe Renton will be nicer.  Renton!  Nice!  Hahahahahahahaha!!!  No, really, we can have hope. . .  After we took Renton back last night, we had dinner and watched a movie.  Callie was just jumping around from lap to lap, being all sweet.  Steven played with her for a long time.  Then he says, "This cat is much more fun than Renton!"  What?!  He later said he didn't mean it, but I'll never let him live it down.  Renton is fun, you just have to wear leatherhide gloves.  Hey, they're fashionable.  And now, 'tis time to dry my hair, always a fun daily ritual.  War Damn Eagle, let's kill us some dawgs.

      Over the weekend, my sister and I came up with, I think, an ingenious theory.  Now, probably many of you have heard the oft-repeated theory about The Smurfs Are Communist.  Well, this sort of resides along those lines, but we go after a different childhood cartoon, and in a slightly different fashion.  Ready for it?  Would you like to hear our hypothesis; let our facts, thoughts, and conclusions shatter yet another seemingly innocent children's tale?  Of course you are.  And here it is. . .brace yourself. . .  The Whos down in Whoville, the tall and the small, were  stoned . . . which is why they didn't care they had no presents at all.   And how could they have been stoned?  Where's the proof, you ask.  Well, the proof is shown by a simple fact, stated clearly in both the book and cartoon movie (which is practically word for word, and it would have to be; Dr. Seuss doesn't work in prose).  The simple fact is, kids, is the Whos were in possession of  Who Hash .  We all know the line ". . .he even took the last can of Who Hash," as The Grinch looks at the camera with a knowing smile and wiggles his eyebrows.  Yep, he knows what he's doing later:  bakin' special brownies.   To add to this amazing revelation, we even have concluded that there is evidence of the Whos being stoned that very night The Grinch came to steal Christmas.  Evidence #1:  None of the Whos (sans one, which I'll discuss in a minute), woke up while the Grinch was trashing their places, stealing all their goodies.  Surely there was one light sleeper in the bunch, some adult Who person who had had too much Who Egg Nog and really had to use the facilities, but no.  Not a one was awake, and why?  They were stoned off of Who Hash, and they all had collapsed into slumber a few hours before the Grinch made his little stop.  Now there was that one exception, little Cindy Lou Who (no more than two), who needed some water.  Now, with Cindy being no more than two, and even stoned Who parents have some sense, she didn't get to have as much Hash as everyone else, but she did get a little.  Just enough to make her thirsty, and to be totally nonplussed when she finds some weird green Santa Claus (wearing no pants, mind you), in their Who living room that doesn't have a stick of furniture, stuffing their tree up the chimney, and obviously having a hard time of it.  She was just stoned enough to buy the green man's lame excuse of fixing a light bulb.  Yep, hash'll do that to you.  Now, Evidence #2:  they wake up, no presents, no  furniture  even, and what do they do?  They go out into the Common Green, hold hands, and start singing!  "Fa-who-la is Fa-do-la sing welcome Christmas Christmas time!"  The story goes that they're still happy and singing because Christmas came, just the same, without any presents at all.  Uh huh, sure thing, man.  If you woke up and found everything in your house to be MIA, wouldn't you flip?  I know the advertised point of the story is that material possessions don't matter, but most of us would be upset on some level.  It's sad but true; I bow down to the person who can truly say they would not be miffed.  But every Who in Whoville (the tall and the small), don't even care?  It's a cover-up for the fact that they were all stoned out of their minds, so of course they wouldn't care; they probably didn't even notice.  They just knew that they were feeling good, their houses seemed nice and spacious, hey y'all let's sing.  And what singing, too.  Fa-who-what?  Of course, if the Grinch hadn't been fooled into feeling remorse for his actions and therefore had not brought back the goodies, those Whos would have been right mad once they realized that the last can of Who Hash had been lifted from their little druggie town.  Green heads would have rolled all the way down Mount Crumpet.  And for the final evidence, I give you Evidence #3:  they all had the major munchies.  At the end of the cartoon movie, where the Grinch is carving the Roast Beast, everyone's happy and gnoshing away.  As the (cartoon) camera pans back, we see all the Whos going at their food like ravenous wolfhounds.  Look at that Who with the corn-on-the-cob!  You couldn't tear him away from that thing.  And that Who eating what looks to be mashed potatoes.  That one never comes up for air.  I guess after all the Who Hash, any normal Who would have the munchies.  Even the Grinch, the Grinch himself (who carved the Roast Beast, don't forget), probably had sampled some of the Who Hash as well; he goes at his roast with gusto.  In fact, every Who man, woman, and child are munching away, the druggies.  So there you go; the truth behind How The Grinch Stole Christmas, as discussed by my sister and I.  After thinking about all this, and having the realizations, it will make Thanksgiving Day a much more interesting event when they show the cartoon movie continuously for twenty-four hours, as is their custom.  Maybe I will even find more evidence, either for or against our argument.  I'll have to remember to write it down, or at least mentally file it away, and I'll post it here first.  Unless I'm stoned.  Then I just won't care.  (two notes:  I hate using the phrase 'cartoon movie,' but ever since Ron Howard tackled the Dr. Seuss classic, I have to make the distinction.  The cartoon movie is much, much more than a mere cartoon.  Second note, I hope y'all don't think I'm a stoner.  All of my knowledge on marijuana comes from popular culture, one testimonial from a weird acquaintance, and a story about a dumb cop from a fellow horticultural student.  This, of course, makes me an expert.)

      It seems that people are waiting, just absolutely dying for me to post something (probably about the game), so I shall do a quick post to whet your appetite.   Auburn won, woohoo, war damn eagle, 10 to 3, eat that Arkansas, we rule, just don't vote for us in the polls.  We  are so GOOD as underdogs!  woof

      I do enjoy my favorite cereal now and then; it's tasty, sugary, and makes me forget I'm slowly turning into an adult.  That is, until Renton spills it all over the floor.  Then I miraculously change swiftly back into an adult, scolding Renton while throwing him out, and then bending over to clean up the now wasted rainbow of flakes.  Never eat dry cereal with a spoon while having a cat in your lap, who is infamous for curiosity.  It was really stupid of me, actually.  Did I really think that I would be able to repeatedly hoist a spoonful of dry bits of cooked corn and sugar to my mouth with Renton not letting his curiosity getting the best of him?  I guess it's been a long day.  It only took a few spoonfuls before he put his paw on the spoon handle, pulled back, and FLIP!  The cereal was catapulted all around us, like so much colorful confetti.  Sticky confetti.  That crunches under your feet.  From now on, I think I'll kick Renton out while I'm eating my Fruity Pebbles.

      There are three basic maxims to follow when you're cooking chili.  Number one:  make sure it is not hot outside.  Number two:  make sure you have all the ingredients.  And Number three:  make sure you've got a pot big enough to hold all of it.  Well, I am proud to say that I am sitting here, typing, and enjoying a delicious homemade bowl of chili that  I  made, and I failed to follow all three of the above rules.     But why would you do such a stupid, dumbass thing, Carrie?  Well, I'll tell ya. Last week was a cold week here in Fort Payne.  When it gets cold, I crave chili.  One needs three things in Fall:  cold, chili, and football.  So, I had the cold, I had the football, I needed chili.  Alas, due to my procrastination of other things, I didn't have time to make it 'till this week.  And this week, it has been warm.  Just my luck.  But I'm not gonna let ten degrees' difference of heat stop me from makin' my chili.  To solve the problem, I just turned the thermostat down about five degrees, a simple action.  First maxim solved.   Second problem wasn't quite so easy; some ingredients missing from the pot can mean life or death for any chili, no matter what oddball recipe you're using.  Mine wasn't that dire of an ingredient (or else I would not be eating yummy chili right now), but I've never made chili without it before.  I was lacking tomato paste.  I realized this before I left work, so it was my intention to swing by the Foodland (I don't like to brave Wal-Mart after 5 pm), and pick up a can or two.  Soon after walking into Foodland, however, I soon realized why it is that I shop at Wal-Mart, and not at this store.  They had no freakin' tomato paste!  Not a single can.  They didn't even have any tomato sauce, which can be used in a pinch.   Then, just 'cause I needed something to come out of my visit to this store, I try to find some of the canned cat food that Renton likes.  Would you believe they didn't have that either?  Foodland.  They should call it FoodDesert.  Or Foods R Not Us.  Or something like We Only Sell Batteries And Depends.  Boogers upon them.  So, still not wanting to go to Wal-Mart (it was Hell there yesterday, absolute Hell), I decide to wing it without the paste.  I scrounged the pantry, looking for something tomatoey that thickens.  Tomato soup?  Why not, better than nothing.  Better than a trip to Wal-Mart.  Tomato soup it is.  Now, I possessed all the ingredients I needed, more or less.   Breaking the third maxim was a bitch.  Especially 'cause it jumped out from the empty cabinets and bit me on the ass; I was not expecting it to be a factor at all.  I had a stockpot, once.  I know I did, 'cause I have memories of cooking a chicken in it at Auburn, and storing all the paper birthday napkins that I collected over the years.  I had a stockpot.  Apparently it ran away and took my napkins with it; didn't leave me a note or anything.  Just imagine this picture:  I'm in the kitchen, on the phone with my mom (using my cell phone, which doesn't like to cradle all that well between my ear and shoulder), Renton is at my feet having a fit because I'm not paying attention to him 100%, I've got ground beef browning in a skillet, and I'm just finishing cutting up an onion into little tiny pieces.  A multitasking Carrie; it is possible.  I'm ready to mix up all the ingredients, everything's coming together, I just need my huge pot.  It's at this point that I realize my pot is MIA.  Oh bugger.  "Oh, don't worry, you'll rig up something,"  Mom says.  I'm so irritated at myself, but I am not giving up.  I want my chili.  Let's see, skillets hold stuff, boilers hold stuff, let's try using both!  So now I was cooking two batches of chili, one in a skillet, and another in a boiler type pot thing.  Double the fun.  Double the stirring, the seasoning, the tasting, the reseasoning, the temperature adjusting, and even the mess cleaning.  You name it, I doubled it.  But I didn't use a stockpot.  I be a crafty Carrie.   So an hour and half a bottle of chili powder later, my creation of chili was ready, jerryrigged all the way.  And it tasted fantastic.   Probably not as good as I can usually make, and certainly not as good as my mom's, but I made it, despite the obstacles in my path.  Huzzah!   Now, a quick thought.  Why in the world would I write so much about a stupid bowl of chili?  'Cause, sadly enough, this was the most interesting part of my day.  I suspects I need a bit more of a life.

      Yay to the Auburn University Fire Department, who swiftly hosed out the fire on The Trees at Toomer's Corner after the game.  I sincerely hope that the idiots who lit the toliet paper ablaze were sore-losing Tennessee fans; surely Auburn people wouldn't do such a thing.  One would hope.     Don't believe the trees were set on fire?  Go to www.theplainsman.com and see the video then.     I know those trees only have maybe another ten to twenty years left, but let's not hasten the process, k?  K.

      WOOHOO, WAR DAMN EAGLE!!!  28 to 21 man!  That was the most nerve-wracking game; all of Auburn's games have been boring one way or the other until last night.  That was the team that was supposed to show up at the USC game; that was our Auburn.  Tiger attack!!!  Now, where's Arkansas?  We're ready (Joannaaa. . .did you know. . .there was a razorback in my truck?  Huh?  Didya?  There was a  RAZORBACK  in my truck!!!)   Too bad I wasn't physically there in Auburn; I had to watch it on TV 'cause I had no ticket.  I don't get a Bama ticket either.  I felt so homesick seeing Auburn on TV; they showed Samford Hall, and the band, and my Aubie, and the section I sit in. . . I wanted to BE there.  'Course, if I had been, we probably woulda lost, so every little bit I can do to help. . .   And I wore my Aubie pin, too.  I forgot to wear it the first two games and look what happened; I've worn it since Vanderbilt.  Us Auburn fans are very superstitioius people.  At the last game Ken's mom wouldn't let Jeff sit in the same place he sat for the USC game.  It worked, too; that and my Aubie pin.  War damn superstitious fans!  Take that, Corso.  Who's a pigeon now?   Ka-bong!

      Today is once again Damn Near Game Day, the last one of the regular football season.  So sad, so sad.  Tomorrow is not only Game Day,  it's THE Game Day to beat all Game Days -- the Alabama game, also known as the Iron Bowl.  However, with the way both teams have been playing this year, it's more like the Balsa Wood Bowl.  But as disappointing as Auburn's season has been, Bama's has been much worse.  Forgive me a small "Ha!"  Now, we cross every crossable parts of our bodies in hopes that we break the away-game-advantage streak that's been going on for quite a few years.  _____________________  Renton the Moth Cat is doing much better.  There has been no puking since Wednesday, and he is getting back to his stinky-poop ways.  I've never been so glad to smell cat shit as I was on Wednesday night.  That little lump saved me five hundred bucks in vet tests!  _____________________  Today I finally cleared off the top of my dresser, which was overflowing in assorted pocket stuff.  Much to the irritation of Steven, I tend to dump all the stuff I get in my pockets through the course of a day on top of the dresser.  Not the best of habits, but it could be worse, like a booger collection.  Most of this pocket collection was recipts, grocery lists, and pocket lint.  Some of the recipts dated back to May.    I would like to say that I decided to clean for the sake of a less cluttered life, but that's not the case.  In actuality I was on the hunt for a Kinko's recipt and a friend's phone number.  Alas, I found neither.  On the upside, I did come across some major pocket change in the form of a hundred dollar check from my mom, dated July 14th of this year.  Yeah.  Jackpot!  I can't remember what in the world it was for, but no matter.  While preparing it for desposit, I decided to try my luck and search through my wallet for any other potential goodies.  And wouldn't ya know, I came across another check, this one for twenty dollars, also from my mom.  It was more recently dated at October 30th, and I distinctly remember that this one was for a DVD.  I do love finding pocket change.  _____________________  T minus thirty days and counting until Operation: Wedding gets underway.

      Well, Renton has finally done it.  He's met his match in palatable fabric.  This most recent bit of cloth that he's consumed is fighting back.  It seems that Renton, on a late Thursday night, decided to have a bit of my Auburn afghan blanket as a midnight snack.  On Friday morning I found the evidence in the form of an orange and blue hairball.  Lovely.  On Saturday, he left us two more of these little wonders of nature.  Then the puking began.  I don't delve into the details too deeply; no need to make anyone nautious.  Suffice it to say that by Sunday he was beginning to worry me.  Everything was coming out the front end, but not the back.  I would like to think that Renton was learning a life lesson from this, but I doubt his little destructive brain will ever connect the blanket-eating with the blanket-barfing.  So yesterday, after dodging tornadoes, I took him by the vet, with the mothcat-eaten blanket in tow.  After filling in the sign-in sheet with my name, his name, and reason for visit ("he ate an afghan . . . blanket, not person"), we got to see the doctor, who was pretty impressed with the job Renton did on the blanket.  "Guess he's not an Auburn fan," he said.  Renton has been put on a regimen of mineral oil, 2 cc's, once a day, to see if he can clear out the rest of my blanket.  If he's not better tomorrow, though, the doctor wants him back in for x-rays.  And as of Wednesday night, nothing much seems to have changed with this cat, except for that he just stepped into some epoxy glue (no, I'm not kidding).  I suppose he figured one crisis just isn't enough pizazz around here.    Well, we'll see how it goes.  Renton just might be headed for intestinal dye and x-rays tomorrow.  Either that or he'll pinch a really big, multicolored loaf.  As for me, I'm rooting for the loaf.  It might be sore on his end, but it'll be cheaper on mine.  ______________________  In other news, I'm slowly getting my newly brainwashed computer back to how I like it.  This process can be tough, though, when you don't remember what it was that you like, you only know that this current situation isn't it.  I've yet to fix my away messages, and my old e-mails are gone forever.    I've gotten back a few of the links, though.  It took a while, but I eventually was able to find my  urlLink photographry idol's website of Italian wonder .  This is how I would ideally take pictures, but I seem to lack the talent.  Or maybe it's the experience that is lacking.  Or maybe I just lack the guts to take pictures of the most ordinary things in extraordinary places, things that at the time you would not consider to be memorable, yet looking back ten years later you treasure those pictures more than any British Parliament building, Eiffel Tower, or Castel Sant Angelo photos that you ever dared to put in the crosshairs of your lens.  Then again, it could just be the talent.

      And on a side note . . . it's looking like we are going to be in for some tornadoes and wild, wild weather tomorrow.  Hot damn, it's about time for something interesting to happen in the weather world!  Hmm, what should I do about Renton?  Man, this isn't as fun when you've got a cat to worry about while you're at work, dodging twisters . . .  Boogers.

      Yesterday, my Renton reached a new milestone in his self-serving kitty life.  He ventured into the world of the outside.  Well, he has been outside before, but that was only while being confined in a carrier or his mamma's arms, which he categorizes as 'the usual place; different scenery.'  Yesterday was new.  He went outside on his very own . . . on a leash, of course.  Hey, don't laugh -- Siamese cats are very dog-like.  They even drool and poop in the tub.  His daddy, Steven, and I were working on sealing the doors to the apartment.  I have seen one too many lizards and way too many spiders during my time here.  Renton didn't bolt out while we had the doors open, but he was curious.  His little nose twitched with the beguiling scents that a rainy Sunday can bring.  He looked so cute for once (as opposed to Satan's Housepet), that we decided to let him have a go at the world.  Not only was it his first time outside, it was his first sucessful time with the leash, too.  We had tried it before, but we were inside when we did so.  This cat is known to chase his tail.  You can imagine what he wanted to do with a nylon string four times as long than any tail he'd ever chased before.  But yesterday the smell of the cement patio was much more alluring than any prostectic tail.  It was very humbling to watch him.  He stopped to sniff and investigate every inch that was around him.  Each piece of dirt or spot of water was the ultimate fascination for this cat.  And here we are just bustling to and from work every day, and none of us ever take the time to smell the dead leaves.  Not only did Renton smell the dead leaves, he investigated the dead bugs and the live holly bush.  Thankfully, he didn't eat any of it.  His palette is more geared toward Auburn afghans.  I am also glad to report that I got many a picture of Renton investigating this new world.  How could I not take pictures of such a nice, non-violent point in his life?  Steven remarked to me that I take so many pictures of Renton that I'm going to be worn out by the time we have kids.  Grandma please!  (To quote Willis . . .).  When we have children, I'm going to have so many pictures of that kid, you could put them together in a flip book and make a moving picture with it.  There are no worries on the wearing out of my picture-taking desire here.  Speaking of which, I need to find a place where I can buy good camera film in bulk.  Steven and I did some calculating, and the wedding is in some odd 33 days or so.  When you start counting in days, it's time to start buying film.

      I am having the weirdest time with my recent toothpaste selections.  Man, I never thought I'd have toothpaste on my mind so much that I'd want to write about it.  Maybe I'm getting old.  That's probably it.  I've been having this problem with my back, too . . .  In the past, I've usually gone for something like Aquafresh or Rembrandt, as long as it's extra-super-duper-will-make-you-go-blind whitening.  That's the good stuff.  But it was beginning to irritate me that they don't seem to make these kinds of toothpaste in the bigger tubes; the kind that would last you for six months.  Having to remember to buy toothpaste once a month or face stinky, yellow teeth can be weighty on the memory.    So last month I went out on a limb, and bought a new kind.  In a big, baseball-bat sized tube.  Perhaps you've seen the commercials for this one.  These commercials almost made me not even try the toothpaste in the first place.  In the commercial, these two overly happy people come upon this overly happy cartoon beaver in the woods.  "Hey, it's Mr. Beaver!" exclaims one.  This is the cue for all college-age students to snicker drunkenly.  "How do you get your teeth so white,"  says the other dude.  And of course Mr. Beaver keeps his teeth so white because he uses this herbal toothpaste that is oh so fine, and it has natural herbs.  Yee ha.  Horrible commercial.  But I bought this stuff anyway.  One, it was in a big tube just like what I was looking for.  Two, I like herbs.  It can't be that bad.  Sure.  This stuff is like brushing your teeth with puree'ed grass.  The taste in my mouth is worse after using this glop.  But I didn't give up.  At first.  After all, it is a huge tube and I paid for it, so dammit, I'm gonna use it all.    I gave up on it last week.  I just couldn't take it anymore.  So back to the toothpaste row in Wal-Mart I went.  I still wanted a big tube for some reason.  It escapes me now, though.  I settled this time on something more normal:  Colgate Total with a Mint Fresh Stripe.  Woohoo, mint!  An herb, yes, but a minty herb!  I first tried it out last night.  It was pretty good.  A whole lot better than that grass paste, to be sure.  Soon after I was done with it, though, my tongue began to feel numb.  And I began to feel a little nervous -- I had been cleaning the bathroom earlier.  What if I got clorox in my mouth?  No Clorox, it was just Colgate Total with a suspicious Mint Fresh Stripe.  Methinks they slipped some Ambesol into this concoction.  I hate that Ambesol feeling, especially on my tongue.    So here I sit, numb-tongued, typing up my toothpaste woes with a calm Renton in my lap.  I wonder what I should do with all this toothpaste.  Maybe I could throw it away.  But no, it's a big tube that I paid quasi-good money for.  Maybe I can tough it out.  I'll try for a bit, anyway.  Maybe my tongue will get used to it.    If you're talking to me, and I sound a little slurred, dont worry, I'm not drunk.  It's just the toothpaste.  __________________________  And now for an update on the Renton + blinds situation.  I had previously thought that he had only destroyed one of the two sets.  I was mistaken.  Last night I made to raise the blinds by the string (there was a lizard amongst us, uggg).  The string came easily, but the blinds themselves did not follow.  Another one bites the dust.  It was rather comical, actually.  Renton probably set that up on purpose.  He discreetly chewed through the string on the bottom, knowing he'd get a kick out of it once I attempted to raise them.  One of the most essential traits of a practical joker is patience.

      At last!  Finally, I seem to be keeping Renton amused this week.  For cheap, too.  For one thing, he's finally gotten old enough to where it seems catnip has an effect on him (he's gonna be nine months Friday week).  I've sprinkled some dry catnip on the middle shelf of his cat tree thing.  So now, whenever Renton feels the need for kitty weed, he just pops up there, sniffs around and takes a few bites, make some hilarious low meowmeowmeow sound, hops off, shakes his head, and hops right back up again for some more.  Ha, he's getting high, figuratively and literally.  Another thing I've done is I've built him a little tunnel.  I had a plethora of boxes from my wedding tea just stacked up in my living room (YES, we unpacked the stuff outta the boxes, Dad; everything is easier to store that way).  Renton has been slowly knocking down the boxes, one by one.  I could tell he was just dying to have a play with them, but did not want to incur my wrath -- which is suprising, because he obviously doesn't seem to mind being on the receiving end of my frustration and anger when it comes to the blinds, which is another story altogether.  Uhh, back to the boxes.  Last night I took all the boxes and stacked them in such a way that it creates a little tunnel for him to run through, and run through he does.  Back and forth, back and forth.  I think it amuses him that he can go into something and come out at a totally different place.  Hey, if I was small enough to crawl through the tunnel, I'd be amused, too.    Back to the blinds now, since it is amusing, in an irritating, stinky way.  Renton, ever since I first got him, has been fascinated with the blinds on all the windows.  No matter where we go, he would be desperate to whack and paw at these things.  Cute at first, until you realize he's bending them out of shape, and almost chewing through the strings.  It's something he gets in trouble for every single time he does it, which I think is part of the kick for him.  "Rattle blinds 'till a human comes, act surprised, then dash away and see if they can catch me," is on his daily to-do list.  I've tried several things.  There was that kitty boundary spray that didn't work, the discipline, many other things to play with . . . nothing would distract this cat.  So one night a few weeks ago I decide to try hot sauce.  It works with deer, why not cats?  But I go to the fridge and alas, no hot sauce.  Time for improvisation, I'm good at that.  I get a few things out of the pantry and let Renton sniff them.  He didn't seem to like the garlic salt at all, so I thought, "Great!  I'll make a paste and smear it on the blinds."  So I go about the steps to do that, and it seems to work.  Renton stayed away from the blinds the whole evening.   When I woke up the next morning, I realized why.  My whole apartment smelled like a giant onion farted.  It was pretty strong.  I immediately decided I needed to hone my improv skills.  But I had to get to work, I couldn't do anything about it now.  I apologized profusely to Renton and left.  Came back for lunch, and guess what I found.  Not only had Renton attacked the blinds, he had finally broken the thing!  Garlic salt and all.  I was so irritated.  Those aren't my blinds; they belong to the apartment complex!  And my apartment still smelled like onion fart.  Uggg, that was some day.

      Auburn University has the   urlLink coolest mascot ever  .  I just got done giving three of my four daily votes for Aubie at CapitolOne Bowl's website.  They do a yearly mascot contest, and this year, Aubie is in it.  It only let's you vote once a day; somehow it KNOWS, and the only way we've found of getting around that is using more than one browser.  At work, I've got ye olde Internet Explorer, Mozilla, and Opera (personally, I'm starting to think that Opera is the best of the three. . . Mozilla's the worst).  At home I haven't had a chance to download Mozilla and Opera.  Maybe I'll do that tonight while I prepare my computer for the brainwashing this weekend.  But anyway, back to Aubie.  He's just so. . . cool.  And not just cool as in 'hey, look at the color of this booger' cool, I mean cool as in Samuel L. Jackson cool.  BMF, man.  But as cool as he is, he's nice, too.  You see too many creepy mascots with a permanent scowl on their face, like they'd rather eat that kid up than have a picture taken with it while the parents smile and clap.  Hairy Dawg and that ill-formed Razorback (alas, I know not the name) comes to mind.  Aubie kicks their polyester butts big-time.  He can ride a bike, he's certainly not afraid to roll around in the mud during a rainy game, he can conduct the band, he walks with a swagger while swinging his tail,  and  he's got fingers, unlike the majority of college football mascots.  Even Big Al, who is admittedly nicer than most mascots, can't claim fingers.    Once, Steven asked me if Aubie came up to me and proposed, right then and there, would I leave him for the furry tiger.  I told him that it's not fair to ask me such a question.  I don't want to have to choose between the love of my life and  Steven , uhh, Aubie.  I don't care for those kinds of choices.  Hmm, now what about Steven . . . in an Aubie costume?  There's an idea . . .   One might think I'm crazy, babbling on about college mascots, and why ours is the absolute shiznit.  I'm not quite sure myself.  Maybe it's because I'm easily amused, and Aubie definitely amuses me easily by the amusement he finds in others . . . easily.  I think it also comes from me being in Auburn's band for three years, and the band loves Aubie just as much as Aubie loves the band.  We'd get to hang out with him a lot on the sidelines while pulling out our stuff, pulling in our stuff, waiting to get into the stands, waiting to get out of the stands, waiting to do the pre-game banner, and so on and so forth.  Somewhere there's a picture of me and Aubie, but it wasn't taken with my camera, and I never got the picture.  How sad.  My mom and I talked to a lady once at an invitation shop in Homewood.  She was telling us about how her son got to be Aubie back in the late 80's; being Aubie was this kid's goal, the sole reason why he went to Auburn.  What a fantastic calling!  This lady told us a story of some friends or relatives (I forget which) of her son's were getting married, and Aubie showed up at the wedding!  I bet Aubie looks positively smashing in a hat and tails, though I'm not sure if that's what he wore.  Too bad I don't know anybody that is Aubie.  My rooommate was going to try out in college, but she forgot to attend the meetings.  Now that you know why Aubie is so cool, why don't you go  urlLink vote  for him?  He is da pimp.  Literally.  He  urlLink pimps himself out  for events!  Yeah, Aubie!  You da tiger!  Don't forget now . . . vote for Aubie.  Daily.  With every internet browser you can find.

      After avoiding it for over a week (which is probably a new record for me), I went to the local Wal-Mart today.  Uggg, Wal-Mart:  can't live with it, can't live without it (because then you'd have to go to the FoodLand instead, and we know how  urlLink that  goes).    Our local Wal-Mart, obviously thinking more of it's customers than they deserve, has recently installed these 'self-checkout' isles.  Ohhh yeah.  They actually did this about a month ago, but nobody wanted to use them at first, so everything was going relatively smoothly.  You could zip in, grab your powdered sugar and loose razors and zip right back out.  I'd used a similar system in a Winn-Dixie for a few years, so I've sorta got the gist of these things.    Today, however, it appears that the normal Wal-Mart clientele are beginning to brave the machines, and so far, the machines are winning.  If you've got one person in front of you, you're looking at a ten-minute wait.  If you've got two people in front of you, find another line.    You can't blame the user, though.  These self-checkout machines are more onery than a bull having his balls pinched.  Here's how it goes:   Computer:  (magically sensing someone is there)  Welcome to Wal-Mart!  Please select your language, and start scanning. . . NOW.  Me:  (scans item)  Computer:  "One. . . fifty-nine.  Put.  Your.  POTATOES.  In the bag."  Me:  (puts potatoes in the bag)  Computer:  "The weight in the bag is not the same as the item scanned.  Put.  Your. Item.  In the bag."  Me:  (slams potatoes in the bag and jiggles the metal bag holder thingy)  Computer:  "Thank.  You."  Me:  (scans item)  Computer:  "Ninety-nine.  Cents.  To protect this item, do not put it in a bag.  Please place the item in the shopping cart."  Me:  "What if I wanna put my bread in a bag?!  I've got potato chips next, and they can be in a bag together.  You know, save plastic. . ." (grumbles, and scans item)  Computer:  "One. . .seventy-nine.  Put.  Your.  POTATO CHIPS.  In the bag."  Me:  (puts potato chips in the bag, thinking it would make it more sense to put it in the bag with the bread, but NO, the Computer Nazi won't let me.  Tries to scan item)  Computer:  "The weight in the bag is not the same as the item scanned.  Put.  Your. Item.  In the bag."  Me:  "They're potato chips!  They weigh less, and are more fragile than, the bread that you wouldn't let me 'Put.  In.  The bag!'  Fuh-Q!"  (slams potato chips into the bag, no doubt breaking half of them).  Computer:  (satisfied that it's making my Wal-Mart shopping experience more hellish than usual)  "Thank.  You."    Well, you get the jist of it.  I finished up my scanning, then waited for the Wal-Mart Guy with a Key to check and see that I am actually not stealing my potato chips, ponied up my cash, and stormed outta there, with the Computer saying, "Thank.  You.  For shopping at.  Wal-Mart.  Have.  A.  Nice day," behind me as I went.  And I know how to use these bloody things!  I think Wal-Mart's ultimate goal with these things is to make you look stupid on purpose.   On a totally different note, Auburn won last Saturday.  It was a struggle, though.  73-7.  Intense game, man.  Intense.  And in parting, I hoist a glass of Diet Coke to Uncle Willis.  Teach him/her/it bad things, and teach them well.  Like. . . "Ahh, that's the Good Stuff."

      It's Christmastime, and the mistletoe is lurking about.  A lot of us have fond memories of  kisses under the mistletoe.  Whether by a friend, a lover, a perfect stranger, or even your cat, you remember that moment.  They're different, they're special.  The kiss that I remember most was, in fact, one that I didn't give.  And it's the one I most regret.  When I was ten, our teacher had the bright idea of hanging some mistletoe underneath the doorway into the classroom.  We all avoided it like the noxious weed it was, staying away from the center of the doorway, just as you would expect typical cootie-infested children to behave.  Then the last day of class came before we were to go home for the holidays, and all of us students were lined up inside the door to leave for the buses, just waiting for the bell to ring.  I was at the front of the line, near the doorway, with some of my friends.  We were being silly, daring each other to get under the door where the mistletoe dangled overhead.  Then, contrary to typical 'Carrie' fashion, I grew a pair of balls all of a sudden and moved to stand underneath it.  "Oooooh," go the other 5th graders.  Then Scott, who I had a slight crush on at the time, proceeds to come up and stand under the mistletoe as well.  I still can see the image in my mind plain as day:  he's a bit taller than me, all grins, arching back his neck to make sure he was right under the plant.      I almost did it.  I just about leaned over to give a peck on that neck of his.  Almost, almost, almost.  But I hesitated, just one moment.    Then the bell rang, and we all forgot about that stupid green weed as we rushed to the buses.  Even I was glad to be let off the hook.    A month later, Scott was dead.  Killed in a plane crash.  I was away for the weekend, and didn't even know about it until after the funeral took place.  I was back in class, there was an empty seat beside me, and I was one kiss short of a happy memory.  And now it's thirteen years later, and I still find myself thinking about that moment, one of the few regrets in my life.  But what can I do, that moment can't rewrite itself.  It can, however, remind me that moments like those are fleeting, you never know how such a small little thing can become so important later.  At least I learned something out of it.  Sneak all the little kisses you can get.

      I think this'll be the last chance I get to write something before the Milestone Weekend commences, so here I am.  I have found a sliver of free time in between the music compiation task and laundry.  Eureka!  Oh, if you could only see Renton right now.  He is all stretched out on the Elf Bed, eyes shut and looking incredibly peaceful.  At first glance you'd think he was dead, the way he is laying.  Another oddity about him is his choice of sitting and sleeping positions.  It makes for amusing photos.  I've no idea why, but I feel so . . . peaceful.  One would think I was running around into walls for all the anxiety that should be on my shoulders, but no, I'm sitting calmly, listening to the reception music CDs for potential mistakes and musing over a sleeping Renton.  Where are the nerves, the last-minute glitches, the lack of appetite??  Not that I'm complaining, mind.  Well, it would be nice not to have an appetite for a while, but other than that, all is well.  Which can make one nervous in and of itself, cause it could very well mean that I'm missing something; I'm not properly nervous enough.  But then I remember the immortal words from the Matrix, who took it from some other philosopher before that:  ignorance is bliss.    But why would I think that, that's crazy, don't I want to make sure every little insignificant detail is all worked out three times over, so I can be happy and "my day" won't be ruined?  Hmm, yeah, I don't wanna worry about all that stuff.  As long as I'm there, Steven's there, I'm clothed, and there's a dude there to marry us, I'm content.  Flabbergasted, but content.    Aaaack, now how come this blue wrapping paper doesn't exactly match the bridesmaid's dresses?!?!  *I did set up an entry to post on the 23rd, though I should still be in Charleston.  Oh, I am such a crafty Carrie!  Don't freak out, I was a bit melancholy when I wrote it.

      I've mentioned it before, but Renton is an odd cat, weird beyond all reason.  Where does one start with this cat?  He's just nuts.  Last weekend, we discovered a new layer to his nuttiness.  Renton (get ready for this one) loves oranges.  Oranges!  Acidic, oddly-textured, squirt-in-your-eye oranges, and he can't get enough of them.    Cathy, who likes the juice but not the rest of the orange, sucked on one like a vampire this weekend, then offered the pulpy remnants to Renton the Curious, who immediately took a liking to them.  He chewed and he chomped, licked and nuzzled; he was in orange heaven.  I think he ate three oranges that weekend, and he had another last night.    The best thing about this is it keeps him busy for hours.  Just lay an orange half on the floor, and he is quietly immersed for a long time.  It keeps him from bouncing all over every stick of furniture in the apartment at least.    ________________________  I had a weird dream last night.  I was at my parents' house in Alabaster, getting ready for the wedding, and my grandfather, Papa, comes in.  Well, we're all a-flutter because we thought he was dead.  So happy to see him.  I asked him if he'll be able to come to my wedding, and he said, "No, baby, I've got to tend to my lady friend.  But I know you will be gorgeous, and you're going to have a lot of fun."  And he gave me a hug and a greeting card, then he left.  I wanted to read the card, but I woke up before I could.  Damn that alarm clock.  I've had wedding dreams before, but that was one of the more interesting.  Hopefully after Saturday, those dreams will stop, and I can quit worrying about Halloween-themed weddings, forgetting to memorize my vows, and leaving the rings up in Fort Payne.  Glad to say I've taken care of all of that.  Hard to think that in just a short week from now, Steven and I will be in Charleston, walking amongst the old buildings and smelling the sea air of the Atlantic, which I've never been in before.  Flown over, yes, but never have run my hands through it.  Excitement!  I've got a lot to do before that next Tuesday rolls around, though.  Graduations, weddings, putting young Renton in a kennel.  He is going to be so mad at me.  Yeah, that Atlantic seems far off.

      As I was driving down to Birmingham today, I passed by some interesting roadkill.  Not to say that roadkill in and of itself is unusual in Alabama; in fact, first I passed by a roadkilled deer, which is quite the norm.  The interesting roadkill I saw was a chicken.  Now I don't know about other parts of the world, but down here, we've no Chickens of the Wild Forests roaming about the South.  I've no idea how it got to the interstate in the first place.  So the question is, why did the chicken cross the road?  I don't know, but he only made if halfway.

      Ahhh, nothing like a warm cup of spiced chai on a cold Fort Payne night.  And speaking of cold Fort Payne nights, guess what's on the weather agenda for this area on Friday night and Saturday?  SNOW ! ! !  Only a mix turning to flurries, but hot damn, I knew there was a reason why I moved all the way to the northeast corner of Alabama.  However, like most other forecasted snowy days in Alabama, this Friday it will probably be near 60 degrees, and we'll have tornadoes instead.  _________________  About a week ago, Steven and I made our way down to ye olde DeKalb County Courthouse to do whatever it is you do to obtain a marriage license.  It was an easy and amusing experience.  The best part was when they dragged out this huge tome of a book that was dark red in color, and was about the size and weight of three cement blocks.    "Cool," I said.  The Book Lady replied, "What, the book?  Ha ha, it's not so cool when you've gotta pick it up."  Then she proceeded to write some stuff in it, but I couldn't see what, because I was more preoccupied with trying to recall all my most vital information that the government just has to know.  The best question was, "Are the bride and groom related?"  After checking with Steven, I proudly marked "No."  I wonder if that's a minority in this county.  Anyway, soon after we were able to leave the courthouse with the almost-official license, complete with misspellings that I will have to get corrected later.  And, true to my style, I embarrassed myself with my lack of common sense in front of the security guard.  Another day, another stupid.  _______________  And after writing so many horrible things about what Renton the Devil Cat has done, I must give him some praise.  He was astonishingly angelic throughout the entire Thanksgiving holiday at my parents.  Renton even was calm during the house-exploding time of putting up the Christmas doo-dads.    So unlike before, when it was, "You punish him too much; you're too hard on him," now it's, "You don't punish him enough.  Follow through; give him a few hard whacks."  Whack whack whack.  It's pretty hard to whack the little nutter when you're at work, and he's in the kitchen eating your oven mitts.  I still like Steven's idea of a cat straightjacket, but last time we hunted for one of those, we ended up on some creepy BDSM supply website.  Something tells me they're not into the business of cat discipline, at least not of the feline kind.  _________________  Google amuses me.  Especially when I go through my site statistics and see how people came to this oddity of a diary/journal/entertainment/communication type thing.  The more stuff I write on this thing, the more potential there is for someone to randomly trip over it via a Google search.  The search phrase winner for this week?  Why, it's gotta be, "squirrel pee on computer!"  It's true, it's true, search that phrase and you'll find me.  And honorable mentions go out to "hot sauce on tongue discipline," THE CASTEL OF DOCTOR BRAIN," and "ambesol," which apparently I have been misspelling.  It's "Anbesol."  Ohhhh.  And I'll leave ya with a hearty WAR DAMN EAGLE!  Tuberville rules; Housel, Walker, and especially Lowder drools.  All over our image.  Pissants.

      Ahhh, as I sit here and sip on my ginger peach tea, I am finally starting to warm back up.  I was outside for a little over two hours this morning in Chattanooga, tromping through mud to take measurements of all sorts.  It was that nasty kind of mud that cakes onto your shoe in layers, so when you come out of the muck, you feel like you're wearing a pair of very tall, very squishy platform shoes.    However, despite the cold and muddy conditions, I am pleased to report that I saw my first snowflake of the season!  I was in the midst of a blizzard of ten flurries for about a minute.  Of course, that is nothing compared to what Jason got in Columbia, or what Willis is getting in Nashvile.  Grumble, grumble.  Steven and I finally got bored enough to go visit a little place up the road called Little River Canyon on Friday.  I am so ashamed that I have lived here close to ten months and have waited so long to go see it.  The canyon is amazing; so much more so than DeSoto Falls, which has always amused me greatly.    At the Canyon, there were more places to go and walk about.  We followed a path along the side of the cliff for a while until we found a place to climb down into the canyon itself.  So much stuff to see, and I didn't have my camera!  I would have gone bonkers if it had not been for Steven's new camera phone, which he just got that very day.  It does pretty good for a device where the camera is just the added feature instead of the main event.    For example, here I am in the canyon, selecting really good rocks:     The plan was for us to go back on Sunday, more expensive camera in hand, and get a bunch more shots, climb around, and generally have a blast.  Of course, it rained for most of that day, and when we finally went (we were  that  bored), everywhere was wet and gloomy.  There was a lot of water in the river though.   On Saturady we finally went to Nashville to visit the Willis.  The city itself isn't much to talk about except for the evil looking BellSouth skyscraper.  I shot some pictures of it for editing later.  It shall be spiffy.  And now I must be off, for I have been up since 5:30 am and I must read some intriguing books on database creation and administration.  All landscape designers must know database creation and administration.

      My rodent friend thought he could get away with another sneak around my office, but my now-empty trash can got the better of him.  When I was in my office this morning, I heard what sounded like papers rattling, which is normal; I usually have papers stuck on the wall and they tend to end up on the floor.  This morning, however, there was a noise without moving papers.  Creepy.  My mind immediately went to "RAT" because of the previous day's evidence on my desk.  I walk over to investigate.  Alas, I was wrong,  T'was not a rat:  t'was a mouse.  A crazed-up mouse running and pooping everywhere.    He stayed with me in my office for half of the day.  I began to have thoughts of keeping him and naming him Rufus.  That is, until my nose started going haywire.  Once the snot came, the mouse went.    I don't know exactly what they did to Rufus, but I think I'd rather not find out.  I'm sure he was dealt with severely.  And now I'm home and doped up on a drowsiness-inducing antihistamine, and am wondering if I am typing nonsense.  It's quite hard to tell.  I'll probably read it tomorrow and bust out into laughing fits or tears.  Cause I do want to make sense, and be amusing.  I do try.  I'm obviously not that good at it, 'cause none of y'all ever give me any nifty comments at the bottom.  Yeah, you know who you are.  Nobody loves me; that's sad.  I think I'm gonna go to bed now; the medicine wills it so.

      I realized something this morning:  I left Renton's favorite yellow mouse fetch toy at his Daddy's this weekend.  Oh, agony, agony!  How could I have been so careless?  It would be one thing to forget some balls, his cat condo, or yes, even his Otter.  Actually, I'm sure the Otter would enjoy the break from constant molestation.  But you can't leave the  favorite yellow mouse fetch toy!   What else is there for him to go crazy over, careening though the house with that banana-like mouse clutched in his teeth?  How else can I wear him out right before it's time to go to bed?  What in the world did we  do  before Renton got that thing in his Christmas stocking?  This week was going to be a long week . . . until I went to Wal-Mart this afternoon.  Yes, today I bow down to the idol that is WallyWorld, for they had  twenty  of those little yellow mousies lining the shelves of the cat toy section.  Brand new toys, sparkling clean, fresh, and ready to go.  They even had their tails attached.  I point this out because Renton's poor mouse had the appearance of being run through Renton's own personal kitty Enron shredder and hole puncher deluxe.  I had already re-stitched it once.  I bought two packages of the suckers.  One for now, one for later, and hopefully by the time Renton shreds through those, I'll have enough money saved up to buy every goofy yellow Wal-Mart mouse I can find.    Best $1.76 I've ever spent.  ________________________  Speaking of mice, I believe quite a few of them had a party on my office desk while I was away at Auburn.  They forgot to clean up their mess, those party-reveling fools.  Nothing wakes your ass up better on a Monday than the sight of rodent shit trailing around your office.    Not to worry, though.  I do believe that they will be caught and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.    _______________________  And finally, after a week of aggravation and despair, the company website is back online.  Huzzah! goes the webmaster.  I was also asked if I would be interested in doing some contract work in web design for other clients of our new hosting server.  Huzzah! goes the webmaster again.  Lord knows I've got the time, or else I wouldn't be writing on this thing as much as I do.  I don't know if anything will ever come of it, but I surely appreciate just the compliment and confidence in my work, especially since I haven't the slightest idea what I'm doing.  Ha ha ha, I could have a website design company called WTF, Ltd.  Motto:  "When you see our designs, you say, 'WTF!' "  Yesssss, the marketing capabilities are endless . . .

      Well, I have had an enjoyable last two days at work; I feel like I have watched cartoons all day, the old Warner Brothers cartoons, to be more specific.  To be even more specific, Mel Blanc has been singing in my ear, much to my amusement.  Now you think I'm crazy, right?  Uhh, well I am sorta crazy, but not that crazy.  Hark, I feel an explanation coming on.  I use an internet-based music subscription service, both at home and work, and this week I have been listening to musicals.  Cats, Chicago, Les Miserables, My Fair Lady, Urinetown, Moulin Rouge, just a whole mix.  When I was putting together this playlist, I came upon a set of songs called Bugs on Broadway.  Interesting . . .   It turns out that it is the full soundtrack, both music and vocals, of those Bugs Bunny cartoons where ol' Bugs was singing.  All we need is four words here, people:    The.  Rabbit.  Of.  Seville.  ! ! !  My second-favorite Warner Brothers cartoon of all time, following closely behind Duck Amuck, but that's another story.  So let me set the scene for you . . .  I'm sitting at work, hunched over some irrigation plan doing more math than is necessary, and Bugs is singing in rhymes while butchering Fudd's hair.  I have seen this cartoon so much, mostly due to my intense absorption of all Merrie Melodies cartoons in my childhood, that I am actually seeing these cartoons play in my mind's eye, just as if I was back at home watching the animation on that old cabinet T.V. we had.    I don't work.  I listen to music, watch cartoons, draw, and color all day, and I get paid for it.    Wowzers.  Now if I could only engineer how to instantly teleport myself down to Auburn every afternoon . . . that would be AWESOME!

      Dear Mr. and Mrs. Goofy-Present-Buyer,           Thank you so very much for the absolutely goofy gift that you sent to us for our wedding.  We are absolutely speechless over it; we're really not quite sure what it is yet, but once we figure it out, we'll be sure to use it for it's intentended purpose and love it.  It absolutely does not match with anything else that we own or would ever would think to own.  It is so nice to know how much you were thinking of us.       We are sorry that you couldn't make it to our wedding, but since we have not seen you in such an absolutely long time, we probably wouldn't have recognized you in the first place.  However, we truly missed having you there.  Once again, thank you very much for the useless, ugly gift; we hope to see you soon!  Love,     Carrie and Steven

      I'm back again to continue on my long-winded rendition of an action-packed week Steven and I had a few weeks ago.  So today, kids, I'll tell a story of Charleston, complete with horse pee, really bad eggs, decorated palm trees (just like that Corona commercial), and Williston.    We left on Sunday morning from the Tutweiler Hotel in Birmingham (ha ha ha, our friends didn't know where we were staying at, but it wouldnt've mattered if they did, 'cause there was no car there anyway).  Our parents brought us some food, clothes we left (I have never been so happy to see my hiking boots), and the car.  So off we went on a nice, sunny day, while I was snapping pictures as we drove by interesting stuff (interesting being a trolley, a gingko tree, and a building in the reflection of another building . . . cool).  The drive wasn't all that bad, but it wasn't terribly interesting, either.  Georgia should think about building less around Atlanta and start working on filling up that dead space between Atlanta and Augusta.    In South Carolina we went through a town called Williston.   I got some pictures for Willis.  We found his town!  We got to Charleston about seven in the evening, eastern time.  Time to find the hotel and eat!  It had been a long time since that Arby's in Augusta.  After a wrong turn and a very creepy drive around Battery Park, we found the Harborview Inn, our abode during our stay in town.  They parked our car for us, so I was amused.  There was also a cool, old map on the wall, so I was twice amused.  I was thrice amused when the dude at the front desk said they could make recommendations and get reservations for us, so we took him up on his offer and asked if there was a place close by where we could get something "light."  He recommended a place that served a whole bunch of appetizer that you can nibble off of.    It felt good to walk.  Probably one of the things I miss most about college is the walking.  That was my only form of exercise, and now I don't even get that.  Not a block from our hotel, we came upon a Subway.  I made a mental note to get a picture of that later.  The restaurant, Meritage, was about four blocks up the street.  It was very good, too.  We had a crab cake, something with filet mignon, and some roasted peppers and onions with cheese.  I was amused yet again.  Then we were off back to the hotel; we were full and tired.  I think I burped peppers that night.  Tasty!  The next day we had no specific itinerary; there was a whole town to see without required tours and excursions getting in the way.  It turns out they named our inn 'Harborview' for a reason; we were right on the water.  There was even a nifty pier we could walk down on.  By the smell, we reasoned it was at low tide.  We decided it smelled like really bad eggs.  I think we quote Pirates of the Caribbean too much.    I took an inventory of my film, and rationed out four rolls for that day (Monday), another four for Tuesday, and one for Christmas.  Fifteen minutes later, when we were halfway down the Battery and on the third roll of film, I quickly amended the film ration to eight rolls for that day and more film would be bought later.    Most of the morning I walked around with the camera constantly attached to my face; I'm amazed I didn't walk off the pier.  Most of our walk was dotted with my exclamations of "Oooooh, look at the trees!" *snap* "Ooooh, neat statue!" *snap* "Neat!  A boot scraper!" *snap*  "Wow!" *snap*  "Oh, my God, a camellia!" *snap*.  I'm so glad Steven tolerates me.  We also met some interesting people.  We met an old man at Waterfront Park when I was getting some pictures of this fantastic pineapple fountain.  He asked if we would like him to take our picture in front of said fountain.  We said, "Okay!"  I know what you're thinking; that was pretty dumb to hand over my $300 camera to some stranger.  Yeah, it usually is.  I talked to Steven about it later, and we had the same thought going through our head:  "If he took off . . . we could catch him."  This dude was no spring chicken, mind.  It turned out he was okay.    "This isn't your normal $39.95 K-mart camera," he jovially remarked.  We even talked about football, once he realized we were from Alabama.  Auburn versus Alabama, Clemson versus South Carolina, that sort of thing.  I'm mad at South Carolina, though.  See previous comment about dumb Cocky.  We met another interesting couple later that evening while enjoying some wine and cheese courtesy of the Inn.  They were an older couple from North Carolina, originally from New Jersey.  They were on their own honeymoon of sorts because they had finally completed some annulment paperwork so their marriage was valid in the eyes of the Catholic Church.  It was a very pleasant conversation, no doubt encouraged by the generous helping of wine.  We talked about traveling, golf, cultural differences between North and South, Auburn (they had been there and loved it), dancing lessons, and even more subjects I can't remember right now.  Very interesting people.  For lunch that day we ate at Hyman's (yeah, I know) Seafood.  It was fantastic; well worth the wait.  I sat where Timothy Dalton had sat, and Steven was sitting where Anthony Hopkins had once dined.  I think I amused the waiter with my excitement.  For dinner that evening we ate at a place called Slightly North of Broad, or S.N.O.B. for short.  It was a very nice, elegant place.  Steven had duck, I believe.  I had something to do with beef.  Probably one of the best salads I've had in a while.  After dinner, we made it back to the Inn in time for fresh-baked cookies and milk.  Steven was very excited over that.  The next day we took an hour and a half horse carriage ride around the town.  If you ever go to Charleston, I highly recommend one.  After Steven and I had walked around, taking in these neat, beautiful buildings, we finally got to hear tidbits of information about them.  Our tour man was named Walt who had a friend in Birmingham that sold Land Rovers and loved it, and our horse was Big Jim.  There was a couple from Hoover on the ride with us, and some people from Florida and California, too.    In front of the Powder Magazine building (oldest public building in Charleston), Big Jim had a Big Pee.  All I can think to say is, "Wow."  When in Charleston, avoid the bubbly puddles, for they are warm and smell of ammonia.  I was very impressed, and was even more impressed by Walt, who was able to tell all about the Powder Magazine with a straight face while Big Jim watered the weeds.  For lunch that day, we ate at a restaurant called 82 Queen, which was highly recommended by a number of people.  After eating there, I can see why.  It was a warm day, even for December, so we ate outside in the courtyard area.  There were sparrows hopping about, hoping you would drop some of your crab cake, and trees surrounded us, partially blocking us off from the other patrons.  I was, yet again, amused, and my many photographs from that lunch are proof of my amusement.  We tried some of their specialty she-crab soup, which was absolutely spectacular.  It is worth the seven hour drive, twelve dollars to park, and the six bucks for just that soup.  Drive to Charleston and get yours today, yo.  We got dessert there as well:  I had my first creme brulee and Steven had something very, very chocolatey.  We ate it all, but don't worry, I've got pictures.    For dinner, we came across an Irish pub called O'Reilly's.  It was very fun as well, totally opposite from where we had dined the previous evening.  We got there during their appetizer happy hour, so we got a humongous plate of calamari for only three bucks.  It filled us up so much we could barely eat our actual dinner.  We just sat back, relaxed, and talked while I took pictures and the T.V. screamed about Mad Cow Disease.  I remember thinking I was glad I had ordered pasta.  Ah, and I got a picture of the calamari, too.  No worries.  After dinner and a regroup at the hotel, we were back out again, this time for a tour called The Dark Side of Charleston.  We were promised stories of murder, scandal, and intrigue, along with a trip inside the old Jail.  It was very amusing.  We saw where someone was shot, and the killer's building where he opened up a store later.  We also learned about the old prostitute house and some other stories.  The jail was really creepy.  You could see where the prisoners stayed, and there were a bunch of various marks on the wall, ranging from tallies of days, a sailor's drawing of his ship, and even some porn.  Woo-hoo!  The next morning, it was already time to leave.  We were able to skirt by an antique store on King Street real quick so we could get a nice souvenir, which we eventually acquired in the shape of a cut glass crystal pitcher.  Then off we went to get on the interstate and head back home for Christmastime.  I hated to go (Steven and I have decided we're gonna buy one of those houses someday), but I was also looking forward to getting home to my Renton, who I hadn't seen since the Thursday before the wedding.    Here are some of the things I noticed about Charleston in general.  First off, most Charlestonians drive either Jaguars or Porches.  My kind of people.  Secondly, they decorate perfectly for Christmas.  Most of their garland was the real stuff, be it cedar branches, magnolia leaves, or pine needles.  Fantastic.  Their accent is a bit heavier than the Alabamian one I'm used to.  Theirs is more like what one hears in the movies.  One could make a great living doing landscaping for these people.  I was amazed by how much landscape they could fit into their little alleys between the houses.  Hire me now!  Lastly, they keep a very clean city.  I was amused.  All in all, I think I took about ten rolls of pictures in Charleston.  Everywhere you looked, there was something cool.  Once again, I give praise to Steven who is so tolerant of me and my eccentricities.    If you know if a particular building, street, or other thing in Charleston that you need a picture of, call me.  Odds are I probably have a shot of it.

      I'm back!  Boo!  And to start off, I give you a rant . . .  Cocky?!  Best mascot of the year?!  WTF!  Crock-a-doo-doo.  That bugger of a bird cheated, we all saw it.  The last week of voting, his numbers shot way way up, getting 98% of the vote all of a sudden.  Nuh-uh, that's not nice.  He ended up third in the online part anyway, which counts for only 50%.  So supposedly this bird had to have been voted number one by the judges big-time to counter-act that third place finish with the people's choice section.  But it's just some goofy looking bird that grabs it's beak and twists it for the crowd's amusement.  Stupid bird.  Aubie absolutely RULES, and his true fans know it.  Stupid CapitolOne Bowl.    ________________________  Okay, no more rant.  I guess now it's time for my official take on the last couple of weeks, seeing as how Steven and I finally got married and all.  Hmm, where do we start?  I guess with the Wednesday that I left Fort Payne.  Normally this wouldn't be anything to hoot about, except that all of a sudden, I wasn't feeling good that afternoon.  As the afternoon wore on, and the sinus shit got worse and worse, I began to chant the F word in my head.  Repeatedly.  Leave it to me to get a sinus infection on my wedding.  Go me, I am the High Priestess of Getting Sick At Events.  Next day was Auburn day to celebrate my sister's graduating from college.  We ate out at Provino's that night with Jason's family.  All of us irresponsible children embarrassed everybody with bad jokes about salty garlic balls and dingleberries.  Fantastic night.  Blew my nose a lot.  Ate a lot of M & M's, too.  Friday was graduation day.  We all met up at Samford Hall, which is THE place to get your picture taken in your cap and gown.  We took pictures of Cathy in her cap and gown, of course.  Steven and I ran by Tiger Rags to pick up a ceramic tiger with it's butt in the air for Willis, then headed to the coliseum for graduation.  I got some great pictures of a japanese maple in fall color on the way.    Graduation was long, of course.  It wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the horrible bits of wood that Auburn calls seats.  Oh my aching ass.  On the plus side, Dr. Thornburg, my dentist, called me in some drugs for the nose.  He was my God of the Weekend.    After Cathy and the other 1,200 people were declared Done With College, we quickly headed toward Columbiana for the Rehearsal Dinner Sans Rehearsal.  I got some good sunset pictures while driving on Wire Road, and Steven and I practiced our vows.  I think I slept a bit as well.  In Columbiana, we went by my aunt and uncle's house first to freshen up and change, then off to Bernie's (formerly Bernie and Charlie's  . . . we don't know what happened to Charlie).  On the way, I saw Santa on the front porch, and he waved at me!  What a nice Country Santa.  The dinner was very nice.  All our people were there, the food was good, and the walls looked really cool.  I've got a picture of it somewhere.  Come to think if it, I've got a picture of  everything  somewhere.  After the dinner, t'was time for bed.  Thanks to the cocktail of drugs, I slept quite well.  We didn't have to be anywhere until ten, so that was nice and non-stressful.  I don't remember too much of that morning, but that's probably because not much of it is very interesting.  I do remember being pretty calm and laid-back.  Or maybe that's just my take on it.  We had to be at the Manor at four p.m.  The first person I saw was Willis, on his cell phone.  Then I saw Steven and the rest of the guys, and Caitlin and Holly were there, and my aunt and uncle, too.    We rehearsed first.  It was pretty quick, it was also loud because the heaters were on.  More about the heaters later.  I met the photographer, talked to some other people, then we all went to get ready, which really didn't take that long.    Steven and I decided that we were going to do pictures before the wedding, which is a bit of a faux pas, but it is so much better.  To make a bit more of the moment, our photographer arranged it so that once I was ready, I'd be positioned all nice and pretty in the bride's room, and Steven would come, knock on the door, I'd say, "Come in," and he'd come in, see me, *snap* goes the photographers, then they'd give us a minute to take in the moment and exchange gifts.  It worked out pretty well.  I remember when Steven came in, he saw me and made this endearing, slightly comical groan sound.  I think I said hi.  Don't remember.  For his gift, I got him a nifty, wood-carved kaleidoscope (the kind that you look through and there's colors), and he got me a Swarkivsokoi (HOW do you spell it?) crystal figure of a dozen rose-colored tulips.  Then off to take numerous pictures.  Mostly what I remember about the pictures is a lot of our guests arrived early, so they were milling about.  It didn't bother me much, but I think our parents didn't like it.  Then we headed back upstairs to let everybody settle in so the shin-dig could start.  Steven and I were talking when all of a sudden we heard the music and recognized it as the Sibelius piece.  Whoops, time to go downstairs.    Second funniest moment of the wedding:  I was waiting to go out with my bridesmaids and groomsmen, and I hear Willis whisper, "Carrie . . . Carrie . . ."  I look at him and say, "What?"  and he goes, "Carrie . . . I'm nervous,"  in his most Willis-like voice.  It was all I could do to not totally bust out laughing.  Ahhhh hahahahahahaha!  The ceremony itself comes and goes in bursts of my memory.  I remember the tent had a very yellow glow to it, I was thinking, "Don't fall down, don't fall down," then, due to miscommunication with my Uncle, everybody stood up when I came down the isle, despite the note in the program that read, "Please stay seated."  "They stood up," I whispered to my dad.  Then I was up there, there was some talking, then I got to hold Steven's hands.  More talking, I don't remember much of what was said.  It was good, though.  Steven and I said our vows to each other.  We had worked hard to memorize them, and amazingly enough, we remembered them.  I flip-flopped some of mine, though.  Oops.  More talking, then "Now you may kiss the bride."  "Oh yeah," I thought.  Later, Steven told me he had the same thought.  We kissed, and there was some chuckling.  We wondered why, and later Steven's mom said it was because it was "a sweet kiss," but I still wonder if we did something stupid.  Then "husband and wife," yay, walk back down the isle, don't fall down, photographer asks us to stop and kiss, we do, more walking, make it to the door, here to the cake to cut it before the people come in.    It was only then how much I realized Steven was shaking.  He was all grins, though.  We both probably looked pretty silly.  We cut the cake, drank some milk in pewter goblets (that was the best milk), and we cut the groom's cake as well.  Then upstairs to where there was a bit of food for us so we'd be able to get in some bites.  Best stuffed mushrooms ever, but I could barely eat.  Back down to talk with all the people.  Lot of talking, lot of hugging, lot of laughing with our friends.  Willis gave us pens and pencils (yes!), and Rhapsody in Blue was blasting.  Before I know it they're telling us we need to throw the bouquet and stuff cause it's time to leave.  But I just got here!  I was bound and determined to get that bouquet to Cathy.  At first I was going to do what Mom did, and just throw it to her face forward, so I could aim.  The photographer suggested I just fake throw it then turn around and hand it to her, and I said, "Great!"  So that's what I did.  Sorry girls, I'm weird.  Funniest moment of the wedding:  I didn't have a garter belt, so I suggested to Steven to throw his boutenniere (sp?) for the guys.  Ken made a comment about he better throw it or he'll kick his ass.  So Steven threw it, all the guys jumped up and sailed toward it, and next thing I know, Jason is in front of everybody, everybody's falling, WHAM!  At least four people are down on the floor, then Jason emerges victorious.  I laughed as hard as my dress would allow.  Poor little Taylor was at the bottom of that pile, but I saw him walking later, so I think he's okay.  I cannot wait to see that picture.  Then time to go, we run out and everyone throws rose petals at us as we head toward the car.  I remember getting a rose petal out from my bosom, hahahah.  In the car, off we go, dress everywhere.    _______________________  I'll leave y'all with that for right now.  Tomorrow:  Charleston.  (I still think it looks better as 'Charlestown.')

      I miss the smell of diesel fuel at the buttcrack of dawn.  This realization came upon me yesterday morning as I was coming into work an hour early for a road trip to Chattanooga, where my boss had his diesel truck running in idle.  It was a surprisingly good smell, and memories of band trips of the past came into my mind. . .   Get up, no time for shower, grab your stuff and go go go to the band hall, wait for the buses so you can get a good seat, talking through your chattering teeth to your teeth-chattering friends.  Hey, they're passing out the per diem, money money money, how much did you get?  Dude, they better stop us at someplace cheap.    Oooh, the buses are here, rush rush rush to  The Drum Bus  Bus #2, claim your seat with your jacket and backpack full of amusing stuff.  Find the Pit people, gather the instruments, make sure it's packed, ReadY?  One, two, lift!  Into the belly of the bus, now do that five more times, is it all in?  Fantabulous, I'm gonna go get some cheap coffee from the Sunshine Room, want some?    Hey, the sun's coming up, think it might rain?  So freezing cold, get on the bus and wait, wait, wait for 350 other people to situatie themselves, are we readY?  Yeah, there goes JV, we're ready, start up the bus, moving out.  Road Trip!

      And now it is the morning.  And there is no snow save for a two by three inch patch in the woods.  I am going to go cry now.

      Ahh, new updates.  Huntsville finally woke up this afternoon and placed us northeast Alabama counties in a Winter Storm Warning, so the excitment is still building here.  I've half a mind to set my alarm clock to 3 a.m. to see if the predictions were oh so true.  And, knowing myself, if I see this blanket of white I'd be quite likely to see how far I can get out there with my camera.  Or I could go back to sleep.  It will be 3 a.m. after all.  And I'm also assuming that it will snow.  One can never be absolutely sure around here.  Thankfully my food situation is good enough so that I didn't have to hit the local Wal-Mart this evening.  In this small town, Wal-Mart is the local hangout, so you don't want to be needing bread and milk on a normal afternoon, much less one that is threatening snow.  I'd rather starve, or go to K-Mart, even though they don't have the jelly I like.    _______________________  I've discovered recently that Renton likes rubber bands, but they don't like him back.  Today the bathroom looked as though it got stuck on the way out, so he rubbed his butt up against the bath tub to help it along.  Thanks for that, baby.  I needed to clean the bathroom anyway.  _______________________  My feet are cold.  Where are my Muppet Socks?

      Last week I was complimenting the nice change to warm, sunny weather.  This week I shall compliment the return back to cold, cloudy weather.  Usualy I would not, but today, there is talk of snow in the air.  Snow snow snow snow snow!  Supposedly two to four inches here in the valley.  Right now I am sitting on my butt waiting for Huntsville to get off theirs and issue the warning already.  Counties south of here have theirs, yet it's Jackson and DeKalb that are forecasted to get the most.  As Steven pointed out, people in Huntsville are engineers, not weathermen.  No kidding.  I could go on and on about their on-camera weathermen, but I'm feeling nice today.  However, I will say that I miss James Spann something terrible.   Maybe I will update later about the potential for snow, and if I can think of anything interesting going on, I'll do that too.  But for now . . . database.

      Well, I've got stuff to do and a cat to deal with, so I'll do the map thing that everybody else has done.  When in Rome and all that stuff.  Enjoy.     Here are all the states that I've ever been to.  Arkansas and Kentucky were both wrong turns, I believe.           Here are states that I would like to visit.  Notice I've highlighted states that I've already visited; it just means that there's places in those states that I'd like to see.  Also notice my lack of desire to visit Texas.       States I've lived in.  It is sort of sad.  I would like to see my dad's version of this map; he's lived everywhere.       Where I've been to in this old world.  Another sad map.  I plan to paint the world red with my travels someday.      urlLink So now go give it a whirl yourself

      Yesterday was a very special day at my apartment:  it was Renton's birthday!  He actually made it to one year of age without me killing him; we are all proud.  He got a nifty toy for his birthday, too.  Let's see how I can describe this thing.  It's a round thingy with a ball in it that rolls around on a track of sorts so he can bat at it, and in the middle is a replaceable pad made of cardboard for him to sharpen his claws on.  I call it his Ball Thingy, and thank goodness he likes it.   Based on past experience, it seems the cheaper the toy is, the more he likes it.  He likes it even more when it's not supposed to be a toy at all, like the pictures hanging over the sofa.    There is also good news to report on Mission:  Toliet Cat.  The last two times I've been able to catch him while he was peeing, he had three feet on the toliet rim!  Yay, just one more foot to go, then we can work on weaning him from the litter totally.  Thank god for Tuna, the only cat-persuasion device you could ever need.  ___________________  I would like to take this moment to welcome back the Sun, which we have not seen here in Fort Payne for the past two weeks or so.  Walking out of my office this afternoon was like entering another dimension; one with color and bright things to amuse the eye.  I do still wish for snow, though.  I moved up here specifically for snow, dammit.    ___________________  Oh, and if anybody is the least bit interested, if you want a website done, I'll do it for you.  All I ask in return is money.  Hey, it's a great deal!  You know you need one . . .

      Woohoo, look at me!  I'm posting on a Wednesday; I'm being . . .spontaneous!  It is all about the spontanaiety.  Spontenaeity?  Damn, I still can't spell.  As I've mentioned before, I've been having some trouble with Renton constantly getting onto the top of the refrigerator.  I believe his motive is to get his daily fabric fix by munching on the dishtowels that I keep up there; which, by the by, I put  up  there so he could not get them from the magnetic hook on the frige door.  Apparently all this has done is given him a challenge that he had to accept.  Yesterday, after finding my oven mitts on the floor with a munching Renton attached to them, I went back to  Tape Deflection Mode .  I guessed that he got to the top of the fridge via the adjacent counterspace, so I covered the entire area with packaging tape, sticky side up.  "Try it now, cat!  You just might get into a sticky situation indeed."  I laughed my evil laugh.  Alas, it seems that Renton does not use the counter to get up there.  I've come to two conclusions.  Either he has a ridiculous amount of gadgets that he uses to raise himself up then levitate across to the fridge like a furry Tom Cruise out of Mission:  Impossible . . . or he is able to jump from the kitchen floor clear up to the top of the fridge, which I am guessing is about six feet high.  It's taller than me, for sure, because I had to grasp up there blindly this morning until I got him by his tail and dragged him down to reality.  While he was still in the bathroom serving 'Punishment Time' afterwards, I rigged up a bunch of boxes to put on top of the fridge to add another foot and a half, and I then covered  those  boxes with more packaging tape, sticky side up.  If he is desperate enough to get up there, he better be able to clear seven feet easily while covered in oil.    So far, I do not think he has made an attempt.  Either that or he got up there, laughed at my stupidity, then reset everything, including the packaging tape, exactly like he found it.  And if he can do that, then why can't he learn to keep his toys from the crack under the laundry door that leads to the Black Hole of All Kitty Toys?  Such a strange cat.

      Yes, I am back once again, on a Tuesday no doubt.  As it was pointed out to me earlier this week that I tend to do my postings on Tuesdays, I wanted to avoid this predictable occurence, but alas.  I meant to write yesterday, but the broccoli thought otherwise.  Last weekend, I was helping Steven go though his huge batch of mail that he receives every month and a half or so.  Apparently mail is not a daily thing in the little of corner of Auburn in which he abides, but that is another matter.  He had some junk mail, a check (a check!!!), various offers from BellSouth to please oh please come back, a card from me (that I sent the second week of January), and what looked to be an invitation-greetinglike card, all done up in a translucent envelope.  You know, that new style of paper that is oh so 21st century.  Y'all know BellSouth, right?  Oh come on, sure you do.  If you're from around here anyway.  We had the privledge of seeing their big building up in Nashville.  It sure scared the boogers outta me.  I did get a picture, though.  Wanna see it?  Sure ya do.      Ready?      Ohhh, you're gonna love it . . .      Here it comes . . .         Mordor was inspired by Nashville; just had to be.  So anyway, where was I?  Oh yeah, BellSouth mail stuff.  Soon after last Christmas, Steven and I decided that paying for two phone lines along with two high-speed DSL connections was just a bit more money than we wanted to fork over to BellSouth, so we cancelled the service for the Auburn apartment.  Ever since, they have seemed awful desperate to get their 95 dollars a month back.  Uh huh.  Okay, back to the invitation-greetinglike card.  I open it up and begin to read.  "Okay, we admit it, we let the romance slip away . . . "  And I am thinking, "Umm, this isn't the card I sent him . . . "  "Maybe we didn't say 'we care' as much as we should have . . . "  Now I'm thinking, "Maybe they got the wrong 'Steven' "  "Maybe you were right about everything . . ."  I'm starting to think, "Steven, do you need to tell me something?"  "Please come back; we promise to be really, really good to you from now on . . ."  My thoughts digress to, "What?!"  ". . .starting with a phone plan you're gonna love!"    Huh?  "Come back to BellSouth for local service and enjoy extra flexibility with the BellSouth Complete choice Plan . . ."  What a card!  Literally!  Well I began laughing so hard I almost fell to the ground (which is not all that unusual for me). "Maybe we didn't say 'we care' as much as we should have"?  Too right.  Well, at least they did say "Thank you" in small lettering under the 'amount paid' section of the bill.  Sending out cards like this makes me worry for their sanity more than anything.  Still, you gotta admit it's a good marketing campaign.  It certainly got my attention and emblazoned their name into my brain.  However, I'm still not giving them 95 clams a month.

      Hmm, 'tis a Thursday.  For all of you who are gravely concerned about my health (and sanity) by fault of the last post, I am much better now.  It's a weird, weird week when I fight a cold and actually end up winning.  Much thanks to the Nyquil company and Vick's nose spray.    I'm really straining to think of something to talk about, but my week has been quite mundane.  I've either worked, slept, peed, pooped, blew my nose with little sucess, called on Renton, played with Renton, warned Renton, punished Renton, put Renton to bed, woke Renton up, read a book, or scratched my ass.  As you can see, there's not much to talk about.    I hope to have some good stories after my trip to Auburn.    Here's hoping for some excitement.

      "Hell yes, I'm for debatting anything; Rhode Island says 'Yay!'"  I'm hopped up on Nyquil, can you tell?  I've come to the conclusion that . . .  . . . if Renton wants to get on top of the refrigerator, he will do so no matter what reservations I have of it.  . . . Wal-Mart puts way too much frosting on their cupcakes, yet I eat it anyway while wishing for more actual cake below to balance out the sugary Mt. Everest on top.  . . . Nyquil is good, Nyquil is grand, Nyquil is the best unregulated alcohol in the land.  . . . I forgot.  . . . I need more time than I have.  . . . I'm out of conclusions.  I think I'll stop now.  Wheeeee!

      I would be the first one to admit that, as far as looks go, I am average.  Of course, my husband would disagree with me (I think the term 'babe-alicious' would creep into his mind), but in the eyes of most of society, I am just another chick goin' to Wal-Mart on a Thursday afternoon.  Therefore I was much surprised today when I was treated to cat-calls and other general hooplah . . . by a five year old.  "Hey, come here and give me a kissy-kissy," he hollered at me repeatedly.  "I just want a kissy!"  What do you say to such advances from a gangly backwoods kindergartner?   Should you feel honored or just immensely creeped out?  I go for the latter.  I mean, that kid could grow up to be the next Pee Wee Herman.  He certainly looked the part.  This situation also could be sad as well, since I'm only hit on by pre-adolescent guys.  No guys my age oogle at me, except that one dude from Steven's apartment, and I wonder if he was slightly drunk, or stoned, or both.  Nevertheless, it makes for a good story.    _______________________  I'm slowly gettin ready for the trip.  My clothes are a-washin now, and then I shall pack.  I better not forget Renton's food, toys, his otter bitch, and his leash.  I need the Plexiglas and paint, the camera, DVD's for Cathy, phone charger, blender, uhhh, toothbrush, and surely I'll remember the normal clothes and my entourage of self-grooming items.  And if I do forget any of this stuff, certain people can ride my ass about it all week, because how can someone post a list of 'stuff to get' on their blog and then forget it?  Surely I am above that.    Ha ha ha.  Oh yeah, swimsuit!  And flip flops that I intend to mod this weekend.    I won't forget a thing.   _______________________  And one last note, did you know that the word 'blog' is not in Blogger's dictionary?  Me either, until just a second ago.  Oddsfish.

      What is it now, a Tuesday?  Yeah, a Tuesday.  Let's see, amusing things presented in an amusing manner . . . I'm stumped.  Guess I'll fall back on the old staple of rambling.  I was talking with Steven the other day, and I remarked, "I'm creative.  I'm so creative I make no sense . . . at least I make sorta pseudo-sense to you"  "Say what?" Steven replied.  I guess I just don't make sense at all.  ___________________  Renton is bouncing off the walls tonight.  I caught him on the counter earlier, bad kitty.  I put him in the bathroom to punish him, and while in there Renton fussed up quite a stink.  It hit my nostrils the moment I let him out for dinner.  Well, at least I know he's getting a meaty diet.    One would think that I'd write at least one more once before we leave, but if not, be aware that a bunch of us are goin' to the beach next week, so I won't be writin' nothin'.  Yo.  I'm digressing into gansta-speak.  Yes yes, trip trip, fun fun, bye bye.

      It's always a nice, quiet evening around here when I have given Renton a bath.  He seems to think it unseemly that he should be so clean, so he licks himself for hours until his coat is glazed with a new sheen of cat spit.  It is three hours gone since his bath and he is still in his chair, preening away at a paw.  Renton's chair.  He confiscated it from me, you know.  He tries to take his dad's and his Aunt Cathy's office chair as well when he is visiting them.  My chair, I'm afraid, he has stolen for good.  It is half my fault, however.  I've sat in that chair so much that there is no butt padding left, so a few weeks ago I dragged the recliner chair, otherwise known as the Blue Chair, from the living room into the computer room, where most of my time, sadly, is spent.  I now sit quite low to the desk, and my hands fall asleep rapidly, but my butt is comfy, and Renton gets his own chair.    Sometimes, if he is feeling paticuarly oppressive, he will perch on top of the back of the Blue Chair and gawk at me like a vulture.  It's like Snoopy, but with a devil-eyed cat instead.    And speaking of the devil, I now have photographic proof of Renton's evilness.  This is the animal that I share my abode with:       Yep, that's my baby.  The WolfDevil.

      Well, it  has  been a while, hasn't it?  Terribly sorry.  I'm afraid I've been a bit busy recently, and I did get to have an adventure as well, so at least I've got stuff to comment on now.  Not that anyone pays attention to any of this.  On Wednesday, I got to have a bonifide trip in an ambulance.  Looking back on it now, it was quite amusing, especially the sign above the back doors that read "Providing You With Quality Care" or something thereof.  Wouldn't that be oh so comforting if that was the last thing you saw before you died?  Lovely.  At the time, of course, I was a bit too freaked to notice the amusement.  I'm still not quite sure what happened, actually.  I don't care to go into too much detail, as it is boring, but I was alone at work and my heartbeat reacted oddly when I had to use my asthma inhaler.  So I do the 911 thing, they come and collect me, monitor me, and drive me over to ye olde DeKalb hospital, where I then wait two hours to see a doctor and one more hour to finally be let home.  By that time, Steven had said "Fuq school," and was one hour in to the three hour trip up here from Auburn. I was so glad he drove all that way just for me.  I am also eternally grateful to my boss and his family, who kept me company while I was sitting there contemplating what looked to be a booger on the curtain (hey, it's an improvement over the last time I was in an ER (Brookwood), where I saw blood on the ceiling).  After all, I don't know anybody in this town except them and my Renton, who as yet has not learned how to drive.  Heck, we're still working on the  toliet thing  with him.  ________________________  Speaking of Renton, there seem to be no stories about him recently.  He is being too good, too sweet, too unlike himself lately for there to be any interesting stories.  Not that I'm complaining.  It's nice to know that I can trust him in the computer/guest/extra room while I run to the bathroom for two minutes.  It's been quite a wonderful luxury; I wonder where my karma is gonna make me pay.  ________________________  Random fact:  87 days 'till Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.  And, of course, that leads into . . .   88 days until Howard Shore himself conducts the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra in the music from Lord of the Rings.  I've got my tickets in the chifferobe; where are yours?

      The clothes are in the washer, Renton has been bathed and is now sulking in a corner . . . it must be Thursday!  Thursdays have become chore days around here recently since two out of three Fridays I'm bookin' it to Auburn or Alabaster for the weekend.  I'd rather get stuff done now so I don't come home late on Sunday and think, 'Oh my God, I've no clean clothes to wear!  And what  is  that funky smell coming from the garbage?!"  I speak from experience here.  Today was a rather amusing day.  Mid-morning I got to visit a residential construction site in one of the nicer neighborhoods in town.  The first story framing was up along with the floor for the second level, which we were able to walk upon.  I felt like King of the Mountain; we were very high up and had a wide view.  I tell ya, it's not every job that you get the chance to walk to the edge of a level three stories up, look over, and have your stomach do a few gymnastic moves just to remind you that, yes, you will go 'splat!' if you fall off.  It'll wake you up in the morning, just like a double-shot of espresso.    Ooooh, I need coffee now.  Later on that day, I was surprised by my co-workers, who threw a surprise birthday lunch for me, complete with homemade barbecue and cake!  It was tremendously cool for them to do that for me; I didn't even think they knew my birthday was coming up.  I feel so loved.  ____________________________  I've only been surprised for my birthday once before; for my 19th back in college.  Wow, that's been almost five years now -- I feel so old.  It was near the end of my freshmen year when Jennifer Frank was my roommate and I was dating that other guy, M-something.  I was going to M-something's apartment for dinner that night and  Jennifer was going to watch movies w/ some sax buddies, but when we get to M-something's place and he opens the door, all these people jump out and yell, "Surprise!"    I truly wish I had seen the look on my face then.  No one had ever done anything like that for me before.  Sure, I'd had birthday parties and get-togethers, but no one had ever gone to so much  trouble  before.  All the friends that I had made over that first year in school were there, mostly a mix of band and Prattville people.  We had an absolute blast that night; dinner and movies for everybody; lots of fun.    And yeah, later on that month M-something and I broke up, and a year later Jennifer and I could barely stand each other, but I certainly don't regret any of my friendships with them all.  How could I?  M-something was the first guy that liked me more than a friend-like; the first guy I kissed (not counting that guy in kindergarten), and Jennifer was the best girl friend outside my family that I ever had.  After that first year, though, we all changed, as teenagers are wont to do.  It sorta sucks that we all could not stay the same, but oh well, shit happens, especially in college.  Thankfully, most of my memories are of the 'good shit' kind.  _________________________________

      Stupid Foodland strikes again; they ruined my salad!  I ran by there earlier today to pick up some vittles and they had their fresh chef salads out, which I had tried once before and was pleasantly satisfied.  On today's batch, the composition was much shoddier.  First, they forgot my cheese, that good, squishier white cheese that melts in your mouth like M&M's, just cheesier.  Second, they used the nasty, cheap onions that leave a horrendous aftertaste in your mouth no matter how many gallons of Listerine you swish with later on.  Last time they had the little round, green onion things which are actually pretty good.  On this go they had used the decidedly stinkier, purple onions, chopped so small that I couldn't snag them all to be hoisted outta my salad.  Third, and what really sucks, is I didn't notice the absence of cheese and low quality onions until I got home and began gnoshing away.    What a barfy two bucks to waste; I could've gone to the Peking Gourmet and gotten some white rice and an egg roll instead.  Even Renton didn't want any.  ______________________________  On a happier note, I get to go to two parties this weekend, woohoo!  First, on the first, is my sister's wedding tea.  Second, on the second, is my birthday, so let the cake-eating commence!  But not too much cake, I wanna fit into all those dresses I get to wear over the coming two months.    My Lord, who'd've ever thought there'd be a day when Carrie would say, "Ooooh, not too much cake for me, I'm watching my figure; I wanna fit into all my girly dresses and be frilly!"    Not frilly, just older and a bit more sexier, or at least I try to be.  The guy at J.C. Penney thought I was 16.  That's an eight year difference! (ratio = 1 : 1.5)   On my 18th birthday, the waiter at Olive Garden guessed that I was 13.  (ratio = 1 : 1.38)  So, it seems that the older I get, the ratio of my age verses how old people think I am gets bigger.  Every year adds 0.02 to the ratio.  Therefore, at age 40, the ratio will be 1 : 1.98, and people will guess that I am almost 27.  Oh, the gods are good.  Unless I have the despairingly bad luck of going prematurely grey.  So far, so good, though.  Ohh, the fun with numbers, as long as it's not a required practice.  In algebra class, it's much different.

      Well, folks, I finally broke down and got a web domain and server space.  I couldn't do all that I wanted with freebie ad-encrusted web space, so I figured it was worth the eight bucks.  Now I can bombard you with pictures, video, and crazy thoughts nonstop and ad-free!  Long live the internet, and all that.  The new web site is at  http://crunchythoughts.com .  If you want, you can type in the 'www,' but it's not necessary.  It's a work in progress, like most websites, so poke around and you might find new stuff every once in a while.  The main thing on it right now are the  urlLink image galleries  that were actually quite easy to set up.  That is most definitely a work in progress; I'm always getting new pictures.  That old Tripod site is still up, though I'll probably get rid of it after a while.  It's pretty nasty.  I'm keeping this blog here for right now as well, though later I just might move it.  That would require a bit of an overhaul, but I'm sure I'll do it eventually.    Anyhoo, visit and enjoy.

      Lookie, lookie, I just made my first  urlLink video edit extravaganza .  Hope you like burping.  (give it a second to load, it's about 12 MB . . . I'm working on that.  That's a whole lot better than the 154 MB that it was earlier, so ha.)  [EDIT:  for those of you that saw the first one, this one is slightly different, and much better.  Bit longer, too.]

      Yesterday afternoon, with temperatures at a near-balmy 72 degrees, I was lamenting the end of my precious  urlLink jacket weather.  Nothing left for me but short sleeved shirts and sad times.  This afternoon, it was 39 degrees . . . and falling. Gotta love the spring yo-yo weather here in Alabama.  I proudly donned my long coat as I left work, cold and happy. They're even mentioning snow showers for tonight.  Oh, it would be so lovely.  __________________________  I saw my parents and sister this afternoon; they were coming through Fort Payne on their way back from New York City and surrounding Yankee burgs. They brought me back my favorite present, too:  rocks.    No, seriously.  They brought me rocks, and I'm the happier for it.  Rocks are another slight obsession of mine, along with books, jackets, and people named Hans . . . . . Anyway, I got a rock from Central Park, two from Little Round Top, one from Seminary Ridge, and one other, but I've forgotten and I don't want to get up to go look; I'd rather explain my laziness.    I need to figure out what to do with all my rocks, especially the ones from neat places.  I got a bunch from Europe when I went in 1999.  I even have a piece of a brick from the hotel we stayed at in Florence.  Ken pulled it out of the wall for me.    My most favorite rock from the Europe trip, though, is the one I pulled out of one of the foundations of an ancient Roman building.  About the size of a finger, it was mixed with other bits of rock and stuff in a Roman cement that supported the weight of people like Cesar, Marcus Aurelius, and those lesser-famed Romans.  For 2000 years it stayed there and watched the world go by, until I came along and picked it up that hot July day while our group rested in the shade, hearing about how a pagan temple still exists today because it was converted into a Christian church, thus saving it from destruction.    How cool is that rock?  It sure beats any cheap naked Roman statuette that you could get at any kiosk in the city.  Besides, I have a Roman God of a husband now that I can see at my leisure.    Yeah, baby.  I wonder what I should do with my menagerie of worldly rocks.  My first thought is to get a nifty shadowbox-type thing and arrange them all specimen-like, with labels.  That's the scientist in me talking.  The artist in me wonders if I should try something more elaborate, like carve the rocks into the shape of the place they came from and make a rocky map.  But that sounds sorta hard.  I'll figure out something else.  Until then, I'll stay on the lookout for more neat rocks, like that concave one I took from Little River Canyon even though that's sorta not allowed.  I'll do something spectacular with them someday; maybe when I get a yard.    If you see a cool rock, bring it to me.

      Well, if it's not one thing, it's another. The great state of Alabama now has an  urlLink official state 'spirit.'   'Spirit' meaning 'whiskey.'  Yes, that's right, folks.  The Alabama legislature overrode the governor's veto this week to name Conecuh Ridge Fine Alabama Whiskey the official state spirit.  Pause for dumbfounded speechlessness.  Now let me get this straight.  Alabama, which I've always known as a conservative state, is in effect endorsing an alcoholic beverage?  And we're not talking about some light beer here, this is hard liquor.  A hard liquor product that was initially created by moonshiners, which last I checked was an illegal practice.  Since I have been of voting age, my Alabama politicians have decided that lottery is immoral, higher taxes to pay for education is a waste of money, and liquor is an important, burning issue across the land.  Now, I'm not saying that liquor is all-evil and from the Devil.  I do drink on occasion; not whiskey, though, but I'm getting off-track.  No matter what one's stand on alcohol is, doesn't it seem rather odd to attach the name of the Alabama government to a commercial product?  That's the problem I'm having with the issue.  One could also mention the potential for children to think, "Well, if the government says it's good, I should go try some," but we all hear the "Won't somebody please think of the children!" mantra too much already.  However, it does not bode well for what should be a non-biased institution.  Another amazing thing is the fact that the Senate used their power to overrule Governor Riley's veto of the bill.  Is having a state spirit that important?   Did the legislature think that  Riley was absolutely out of his gourd to think that some constituents might find this silly, uncalled for, or even offensive?  Apparently not.  "I thought the resolution was harmless and humorous," said Senator Pat Lindsey, who (sadly) is a Democrat.  Harmless and humorous.    Harmless and humorous.  Then why was it an issue?  The government's objective is the collective welfare of the people.  We do not pay them tax dollars to keep us amused, nor do we pay them to pass harmless little bills that are of no consequence.  Isn't there more important issues to handle?  Don't we have a budget to balance, bureaucratic loopholes to fix, or schools to fund?  If not, then y'all quit convening and go home.     That  will humor me.  ____________________________  Ugg, all this soapbox preaching has worn me out.  Anybody got a drink?

      I am always incredibly amazed at how fast wonderful days skim by, and last week was no exception.  In fact, the only slow part of last week was the Friday, Saturday, and Sunday before we all headed down to sunny Florida.  Steven and I amused ourselves with repeated trips to Wal-Mart.  I believe we set a new personal record for ourselves:  four trips in three days.  Quite scary, not to mention tortureous . . . except for the last trip when we went with our friends and I got a kooky straw hat.    The seven of us stayed at a wonderful beachhouse courtesy of Ande Like the Mint and her parents.  I was extremely amused as I have always stayed at a condo for previous beachy trips.  I'm afraid I'm ruined for life and will stay at beachhouses forevermore.  This house was especially cool as there was an elevator installed.  We mostly used it as an oversized dumb waiter for all our luggage.  Below is Steven preparing to safeguard our loot for the long vertical trek.      _______________________________  The house was across the street from the beach side (with the house itself located on the 'bay side'), but the walk to the beach wasn't bad at all as long as you were wearing shoes.  I know this from experience.  My feet took quite a beating on this trip, starting with my lack to lather the tops of my feet with suntan lotion.  It was an interesting experience to walk around after that.  Another morning, in my rush to get a picture of the sunrise, I walked out to the beach barefooted.  The driveway to the house is defined by semi-crushed oyster shells, mind you.  Walking back over that with ice-cold feet is a bit piercing.  There also was an encounter with a rouge sand spur, of which I think there is still a little bit in my heel.  Now I bet I could walk over hot coals or a bed of nails and not even flinch.  Yeah.    I'm afraid to say that we all committed the terrible crime of trespassing while we were down there.  The guy who has a house on beach side apparently does not want indentations of footprints to mar his sandy drive.  We bit our thumb at him (who was out of town anyway) and walked on through.  Eat our footprints.     ______________________________  All the previous times I've vacationed at the beach, I did so with my immediate family.  On this go I was quite amused by all the activities we did.  Frisbees, flying kites, skimboarding, chasing after dolphins, all this was fascinating.  All the pictures I took attest to this.  If somebody moved, I snapped their picture.  I was a triggerhappy Carrie with a new digital camera.  I was probably the most annoying person on the trip in that respect, but I just couldn't help myself.  It was a great liberty to take picture after picture with no worries of film and development costs; knowing I could just run inside and scoot the picture over to the (rented) laptop and start anew.  To be able to immediately look over my work to delete unfocused shots, check for under or overexposure, or just laugh until my sides hurt at the endearing goofiness of everyone . . . it's just perfect.  Ohhhh, the humor of it all.    And now to end this section with a totally inadequate picture of a game of frisbee.     __________________________________  On the coldest day of the week (Wednesday) we all went into town to eat lunch and play putt-putt golf.  I do enjoy the putt-putt, even though I suck horribly at it.  I mostly amused myself by taking pictures of others.  Here is Ande Like the Mint kicking ass with her kiddie putter.     __________________________________  We went on quite a few beachwalks while we were down there.  That was very refreshing; Lord knows I need the exercise.  During these walks, I was surprised at all of the naturalness that was still around on the island.  There were always at least a few dolphins just beyond the sand bar; there were sandpipers, seagulls (Mine?), and pelicans in land, sea, and air; and my Lord, there were so many seashells.  A former marine biologist major's heaven.  I even saw a dead sea cucumber washed up on the beach.  We found something new on every walk we embarked on.     ______________________________________  I mentioned earlier that I went out to get sunrise pictures, forgetting my shoes in the process.  Remember?  Well of course I had to include at least one of my hard-earned sunrise pictures.  I got quite a few, of course, but this one amuses me because of the unknown individual with his hands in his pockets in the foreground.  It was fascinating how fast the sun came up over the water and before you knew it, it was daytime and you were out of disk space.  Click, click, click.     _______________________________________  I think that every trip needs that one specific moment that defines the entire experience.  It is even better if this moment is captured in picture form.  Even though not everyone that was there is in this picture, it still, I think, defines the whole week for everybody.  It's a fantastic picture, but goddamn it, Ken snapped it with my camera, not me.     _______________________________________  Skimboarding, though it looked amusing, was not something I was willing to try.  I know I would have just fallen down and busted my ass on the hard, wet sand.  So instead, I got pictures of other people doing exactly what I feared would happen.     _______________________________________  To a continue a tradition from last year, we created another Mer-Willis, except this time it was more gender-correct with Katie as the sandy creature.  We were all rushing to create the sculpture and snap pictures before her boobs cracked.     _______________________________________  We laughed.  We danced.  We burned.  We jumped for joy.     _______________________________________  Proof I was there.  Proof that not only did I wear a swimsuit, it was of the bikini kind.  Proof I probably shouldn't.  Proof that maybe in reality I don't think I look that bad or else I would not feel the need to prove anything.     _______________________________________  The week went by incredibly fast, and before we knew it we were thinking, "we're going back day after tomorrow."    "Boogers upon heaps of boogers!" thought I.  As we watched the clock seem to gain speed before our very eyes, Willis expresses his intense dissatisfaction.     _______________________________________  Before it seemed possible, we were to Saturday, the day before leaving.  After a last hurrah at the beach and a scrumptious dinner with a parrot, we were inside eating the rest of the food, playing games, and avoiding the ardurous task of packing.  Ken, Lisa, Steven and I sat down to a game of Scrabble.  After Steven and I made the play that sealed the game for us, Ken and Lisa played this word.       _______________________________________  And then it was Sunday.  Sunday on an island that barely sits in the Eastern Time Zone that has just switched to Daylight Savings Time.  Us Central Time Zoners struggled endlessly with the concept.  "When do you want to leave?  Uhh, 9 am?  Do you mean Central or Eastern time?  Our time.  Our time now, or our time in Central, or our time in yesterday's Eastern, or the time that is Central now?  No, no, our time."    Though I don't think we ever got it quite right, we ended up leaving at 9:30 Eastern, 8:30 Central.  That's in Daylight Savings Time for those of y'all who are still confused.  And thus began my 12 hour journey across the great state of Alabama, with stops in Dothan, Auburn, and Birmingham until I reached Fort Payne with a sandy suitcase and a confused Renton wondering where his salmon went.  Sorry, Renton.  Here in cold North Alabama all we serve is regular ol' cat food.

      Things are slowly beginning to settle into place now.  My sister is getting married in just four weeks, her fiancé just got a new job ("So now they don't have to live at the Jimmy Hale Mission," Mom says), and Steven will be a college graduate in a little over two months.  It's been a crazy-ass year, and I'm ready for it to be August.  _________________________  Earlier I was doing some exploratory research shopping online for my boss' daughter, who will celebrate her first birthday in a few weeks.  In my quest to find something normal, and yet unique, I came across the cutest baby blanket.    "Man, Cathy needs to hurry up and have a baby, so I can get her this blanket!" I mused.  It's definitely right up her alley, but I won't go into too much detail on account of her faithful reading of this site.  So come on, Cathy, pop me out a niece or nephew so I can get you this blanket.  Better yet, I'll make it myself if I ever learn to sew.  It can't be too terrible hard, and now I have incentive to learn.  _________________________  If you ever contract someone to do some creative work for you, whether it be design, decoration, remodling ideas, or other things of that nature, do 'em a favor and answer the questions they ask you.  If they want to know if you like or abhor a certain element,  tell them so .  Don't wait until they bring the finished product to you to exclaim, "It's nice, but just one thing:  I  hate  azaleas."    Uhhh, not that this has ever happened to me, of course.

      Ooh, I'm a bad, bad Carrie.  I haven't written anything in over a week!  I've got a good excuse, though; a few good excuses, actually.    Steven was in between semesters at Auburn, so I got to experience what it's like to have your husband with you every evening instead of just weekends.  I quite enjoyed the experience, though it makes me wonder what will happen to this blog once Steven's outta school full-time.  I just might fall off the face of the earth.  Okay, second reason why I ain't been writing.  Well, in a nutshell, we saw this kitty.  Come on, you know how the story goes from here:  find  kitty, bring him home, watch Renton kill us all . . . Well, not that bad; Renton has taken the situation quite well, actually.  We followed the rules and introduced them slowly.  Pretty decent experience.  And now to introduce the new baby.  She's an eight-month-old pastel calico whom we decided to name Hermione.  Her intelligent-looking green eyes drew us to the name, which comes from a smart, sorta goody-goody character from the Harry Potter books.  She's a very loving cat and wants to rub her face all over every inch of everything.  If rubbing doesn't do the job, she might take a little nibble from your chin as well, so watch out.    She's half the size of Renton, but right now she's chasing him more than him chasing her.  Renton has always been wary of things smaller than himself.  Come to think of it, that's beginning to be quite a lot of things; we have just realized he is absolutely huge!  He weighs in at almost 13 pounds; need to tell his grandparents to stop giving him salmon.  And, true to my household, Hermione is already starting to gether a few middle names of her own (with Renton being 'Renton Sid Vicious James Peter Bucky Williams).  So far, her full name is 'Hermione Nermel Fidget Itty Winking Puffs Williams -- 'Nermel' from the annoyingly cute cat from 'Garfield and Friends,' 'Fidget' because she lays down and gets up and lays down again about twenty times before she's comfortable, and 'Itty Winking Puffs' after a stuffed tiger accidentally named that by Seven.  Uhh, long story.  She's a skittish cat, too.  I learned this firsthand, so to speak.  There was an ill-fated event involving her, a blender, my hand, and $60 in antibiotics and a tetanus shot.  My left hand is not happy.  That reminds me; I must go take that horsepill again.  I'll post some lovely pictures for later, but for right now, I'm pooped.

      I don't have cable.  I used to about a year ago, but I decided that fifty bucks a month on top of my phone/DSL bill was a shitload of money, and something had to go.  Naturally, internet was my top priority, then cable, then the landline phone.  Unfortunately, the DSL needs a landline to work, so the cable got the boot.  My BellSouth bill was still nuts (about one hundred smackers a month, and that's without long distance), but I saw no other way around it; cable internet doesn't come down this road.  Thankfully, I was only hooked on two shows:  Six Feet Under and Friends.  Ken usually gets me copies of SFU and my mom keeps me up to date with Friends, plus I'm able to catch reruns when I visit home.  With the very last episode of Friends coming up this Thursday, my plan was to watch it over at my office; a practice usually reserved for Auburn away games during the fall.  However, I got to thinking about cable again; after all, I've only got three more months of middle class poverty.    I humored my wild idea with some quick research, and lo and behold, cable internet is now offered in my area.   "Hmmm," I thought.  Granted, DSL is probably faster and more reliable, but cable sure is cheaper!  I do some quick calling and find that I can get digital basic cable plus cable internet for, get this, thirty bucks cheaper than my current phone/internet bill!  Hell yes, sign me up!  It will all be installed tomorrow afternoon, just in time for the Friends finale.  I had to call BellSouth to arrange to get my service cancelled.  There was a lot of joy in that action, let me tell you.   Annoyingly happy customer service rep guy:   "Hi, this is [annoyingly happy customer service rep guy], thank you for calling, how can I help make your BellSouth experience more incredibly stupendous today?"  (I'm serious, he really said this).   Me:   (stifling laughter) "Uhh, yeah, I'd like to cancel my services."   Annoyingly happy customer service rep guy:   "Awwww . . ."  I love how at the end of cancelling all of your services with BellSouth, they still say, "Thank you for using BellSouth."  It reminds me of a time when my dad was on the phone with those people trying to work out some nutty phone problem.  By the end of the conversation, Dad was pretty annoyed, and when the rep said, "Thank you for using BellSouth!," Dad shot back, "I  have  to use BellSouth!," and hung up.  So, summing up, for those of you that really know me, you'll only be able to reach me by my cell phone, which is all I've been using lately, anyway.  I am free of the BellSouth Nazguls, or at least I will be come Tuesday.  ____________________________  Heehee, I bet after this post, anyone that googles the word 'BellSouth' will get this blog at the very tip-top.  BellSouth, BellSouth, BellSouth.  There.  And if you're really easily amused,  urlLink this  is what my friends and I think of the mighty, mighty BellSouth.

      Last weekend was very amusing; we had a lot of parties.  First was my sister's wedding tea in Columbiana.  It went very well, plus they had those tasty little cucumber open-face sandwiches like at my tea, so I was happy.  I am partial to cucumbers.  We had my birthday dinner on the same night at Steak & Ale.  I am also partial to filet mignon.  'Twas a lovely dinner, and it had a great surprise at the end.  My parents earlier had asked me the annual question, "What kind of cake do you want?" to which I had replied, "Uhhhh, a dinosaur one." No reason, really; just wanted something different, something 'not normal.'  I once had a dinosaur cake when I was at that age where inviting all the kids in your class (whether you knew them or not) to your birthday party was the cool thing to do, and it was quite a nifty cake.  Oh, to be seven again.  Okay, back to dinner.  "Okay, Carrie, close your eyes . . . . Carrie, put that camera down and close your eyes!"  So I do, then I hear some rustling, and Steven exclaims, "Oh, my God!"  Then it's "Open your eyes, Carrie," and this is what I see:         It was truly a bonifide dinosaur cake, 3-D even!  It could have been a scene from Steel Magnolias, except with extinct reptiles.  Waiters from other areas of the restaurant came by to take a gander.  Steven then pulls out some candles he found that burn colored flames, like blue, pink, purple, you get the idea. It's a continuation of a lighter gag joke.  They sure did have a high flame; we made my mom extremely nervous.       As hard as it was, I eventually had to cut the cake.  Steven chowed down on some snout, while I nibbled on some eye.  Jason wanted a piece of tail, but after a few bad jokes, we didn't cut that end.  However, half the ass is presently in my fridge.       'Bone' appetit.

      Just wanted to write something so I can go back later and think, "Woohoo, look, that's what I wrote on my birthday!"  So that's what I'm doing.  And this past weekend was very amusing, but it's way too damn late for me to use any mental capacity to write it all down.  I'll consult the muses tomorrow.  But for a vague preview, just know that it involves dinosaurs.  Good night, y'all.

      Yes, I'm a horrible, horrible person for not writing at all recently.  I'm going to Blogger-Hell.  It's turned out to be an extremely busy month and it ain't over yet.  Heading to Auburn tomorrow; 'tis my sister's wedding on Saturday.  Steven's birthday is today (dance, dance!), and so there are many parties to be had this weekend.    I do have some interesting stories and an amusing development, but I've not the time nor the liberty to write about them at this point.  Hopefully I'll be able to sit down and give a full update next week.  Once I get over this weekend, the ride to August will be wonderfully downhill from here.    And so without further ado, let the Hectic Weekend of the Year commence!

      Last weekend turned out rather swimmingly, methinks.  You don't get to drive around downtown Atlanta every day.  That is, if you don't live in downtown Atlanta . . . and if you do, please accept my sincere deriding laughter.  "Ha ha!"  We arrived in Atlanta for the symphony a little after one o'clock despite our initial confusement between Peachtree Street and West Peachtree Street, which were posted on  really  small road signs.  While waiting to be seated, I observed the menagerie of people about us.  Some, like us, were rather well dressed.  Others were slightly more casual, then some were  really  casual . . . as in nasty blue jeans and tattoos.  Still others were dressed up in the latest of elvish fashion, complete with garland of sparkly twigs in hair and flowing robes.  Always interesting to see how music can pull such a group together.  The music itself was incredible, of course.  Howard Shore was quite entertaining to watch; very bouncy for an older gentleman.  Steven and I also had fantastic seats; we were very close to the cellos.  Someday, when I'm a bit richer and in a bigger city, I'd like to take violin lessons.  I've already got the violin; might as well not let it go to waste.  It does look like fun.  After the symphony it was off to dinner, which turned out to be mighty fine indeed.  Now we all want a fondue pot to create our own (much less expensive) fondue experience.  We also had a lovely bottle of wine, which was amusing to me since I've never ordered wine by the bottle before.  Only two of us at the table drank any, though.  Steven took over driving duties on the way home.  __________________________  Unfortunately, my trips between here and Auburn on the weekend were not so pleasant.  I was headed down to Auburn on Friday with Renton and Hermione when a foul smell hit my nostrils.    "Hermione, did you fart?"  She's well-known for her global killers.  "Meow," said Hermione.  It was reeking.  I was hoping against hope that I had just driven by a cow pasture exactly when fifty bovines had a colon-cleaning orgy.  That was a better thought than the possibility of cat poop in my car.  I was wrong, though.  Hermione, who had been crying for over an hour, had released her spoils.  When I got a chance to pull into a gas station to clean 'er up, it got worse:  my poor baby had tapeworms!  Lord, no wonder she hasn't been gaining any weight.  When we reached Auburn I went by a vet first thing.  Thankfully, all she needed was one pill and some time for all the critters to vacate her colon.  Apparently she felt better after that poop in Piedmont:  she slept peacefully for the rest of the trip.  Heading back home after the weekend, however, her bowels struck again; this time in Roanoke.  Sadly, she didn't go to sleep afterward that time and wailed all the way to Fort Payne.  At one point we came upon a thunderstorm, which had Renton crying along with her as I hydroplaned onto the interstate.    I told Hermione she's banned from the car for life, though that remains to be seen.  Places to go, people to marry.    However, I'm debating whether I should board them both at the vet's this weekend to maintain my sanity and my nasal passages.

      Five years ago, I was dreading a chemistry final.  Only a few days left of my freshmen year of college, and I was looking forward to the chemistry-free summer.  I wouldn't have thought it that morning, but by the evening I would be someone's girlfriend again.    Oh, to go visit that Carrie of five years ago.  She probably wouldn't know me from Madam's housecat at first.  And what would I say to this nutter who has no idea what's in store for her?    Perhaps I'd start with, "Oh boogers, the next five years are gonna be the best of your life."  She's retort with something like, "Dude, you can't be me.  You're skinny and wearing too much makeup.  Crazy butt."  Then I'd have to prove my identity by naming off old passwords, embarrassing stories, and that time when Tracy Bohannon got out the w--   BAM!   Old Carrie then would hit Future Carrie over the head with one of those Big Bertha cement blocks and go stuff her down in the basement of the dorm where the chapter room was, thus changing the best five years of her life to the last five years.  She would then nonchalantly sit in front of the computer, where Steven will sign on AIM later.  Wow, that meeting did not go well at all.  Remind me never, ever to step foot inside a time machine.  My past self is vicious.   Happy anniversary, Steven!  I think you'll be able to remember our wedding anniversary better than this one.

      Renton and Hermione are slowly getting used to each other.  For two nights in a row now, I have been on the couch with one cat, then the other cat comes and gets on my side and falls asleep, only to slide down right beside the other kitty without knowing it.  At one point they had their arms around each other!    And there I was, covered in kitties and out of reach of my camera.  So sad.  ____________________________  I woke up this morning to the thump, thump of kitties in the second bathtub.  It's a morning ritual around here; Renton started it and has now taught Hermione the joys of (dare I say it?) tubthumping.  (Laugh at my lame joke!)    When I came out of my bedroom, freshly showered, I found that they somehow closed the bathroom door on themselves.  I have no idea how long they were in there, but they seemed to be on good terms as they trotted out for their morning vittles.  Renton even let Hermione rub on him for a half a second before jumping away.    Progress!  _____________________________  This weekend shall be spiffy.  We start off with a Friday evening at the theatre to watch Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.  And if that isn't enough to dance about, the next day we're off to Atlanta with Ken and Lisa to listen to the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra playing the Lord of the Rings soundtrack with Howard Shore himself conducting.  And to top this weekend extravaganza off, we will be off to dinner at The Melting Pot, a high-dollar, no hassle fondue experience.    Mmmmmm, may the cheese be drippy and warm for all.

      Amazing what all can change in a week. Last week I was worrying; this week I am packing . . . to go to Auburn, for good. Yes, that's right -- Steven decided on the job in Auburn! It was a hard decision that had to be made quite fast, but we were thankful to be in such a dilemma. There are much worse quandaries to be in than 'Agg, which fantastic job offer do I take?!?' We're still in shock over such incredible luck.  Now I'm preparing to move from Fort Payne, this city that has been my home for the last year and a half. I broke the news to my office yesterday. It was taken very well -- it was expected, after all. Though I am moving in less than two weeks, I'm going to still officially be working here for a few months afterwards. All that involves is just a trip up here once a week or so to finish up some lurking projects and get through the fall. It's a good scenario for everybody: they get more time to find a replacement and I get more time to figure out if I'm going job hunting or starting graduate school. Hmm, can I do both?  I don't think we're disappointing too many people by moving back to Auburn. My sister is especially ecstatic. I think all the other Auburn peeps are amused, too (probably because the  good  blender will be back in town). We'll be settling in just in time for football season, too. Dance, dance, dance! The first game is in less than six weeks!  Don't expect me to be writing as often for a bit. I have a new mission in life to put all my worldly possessions into little cardboard boxes. It is an ambitious undertaking, but I am up to the challenge. This task will be even more fun with the cats circling me like sharks, waiting for me to slip up and drop some hazardous object so they can immediately play with and/or eat it, as they are wont to do.  Don't worry though, if Renton chomps down on an ink pen or something, I'll be sure to write about it and take many pictures.

      "I have an interview with that company in Auburn this afternoon at three," Steven informed me yesterday morning.      "Fantastic," I replied. Steven had sent that company a resumé last week, but he hadn't heard from them. It turned out they never received it. A quick phone call by Steven turned into an afternoon interview. "Maybe this will help create a huge shift in the universe toward our favor," I continued, referring to a job in Birmingham he interviewed for but had not heard from yet. It would be a cool job.    Fast forward to lunchtime. I had gone out with a friend to lunch at the Cracker Barrell. It had been a long time since I enjoyed their tasty chicken tenderloins. We were discussing my anxiety over all this non-job business when my cell phone rang.     "Speak of the devil," I said when I saw that it was Steven.    "Hey," he said, "remember how we said arranging that job interview would shift the universe?"    "Yeah . . ."     "Well, it worked.  I got the job in Birmingham!"    ! ! ! ! !    From here I'm not sure exactly what I said except, "Oh, my God, I'm in a public place and I'm about to cry." Steven read off all the details about the job but it went in one ear and right out the other. All I was thinking was, "Steven got a job! We're all going to be okay! Wait a second, I've got to move . . ."    It's all good, though. I feel ten million times better than I did yesterday morning. It's a wonderful feeling, like that first gasp of air after being under the water for longer than you meant to be. The air feels so good, and I'm ready to dry off now.    Steven went on to that Auburn interview later that afternoon with the intentions of explaining his situation: he needs an answer ASAP. The interview went quite well and quite long -- over two hours. Steven got the impression that they are very interested in him and are willing to speed up their process to give him an answer. They will hopefully call today.    Yesterday we had no idea where we would end up or what was going to happen. Today is an absolutely different story, armed with a Birmingham job offer and the potential for an Auburn offer in the plot. Either way, I feel we will be very happy. We will be secure and in places we know.     I have not talked to my boss yet; he is out of town so that conversation will come Monday. Like I said before, I love my job but I love my husband more. We're ready to be in the same town again.     My biggest worry now?  The kitties are going to  hate  moving.      __________________________     UPDATE:   Steven was just offered the job in Auburn, too!   Now what do we do?!?   -14:06

      Two weeks from today, my husband will graduate from college. I'm not sure if the true meaning of this has hit me yet. We've been married for a little over seven months and yet we've never really had the experience of living together; Auburn is three long hours away from my job in Fort Payne. In fourteen days there will be just one home for us. We just don't know where that will be.    I love my job. The only thing better would be the unrealistic fantasy of designing landscapes for the rich and famous at the rate of hundreds of dollars an hour. The location of my job, however, does not lend itself well to budding software engineers such as my husband. Though he interviewed for a job here in town, it is more likely that we could end up in Birmingham, Atlanta, or even back in Auburn. Even so, right now we are just wafting in the breeze of fluttering resumés and interviews.     I feel so emotionally unsettled. Torn between the joy of Steven's impending graduation and uncertainty of where we could end up, I haven't been able to concentrate on practically anything, including work. I'm thankful that the summer heat deters people from their landscaping desires.     At the very least, Steven will be able to move up here after graduation and concentrate soley on his job-hunting while I work. Getting rid of his Auburn rent, power, and other financial necessities will be a great relief on ye olde checking account. We would still be living day-to-day, though, until someone comes through with a job offer. What if nothing comes through at all? Are we destined to live in this day-to-day manner for the rest of our carzy little lives?     This is the moment when I realize I worry like my grandmother.    I have to remind myself that everything will be so much better once Steven and I are actually living together. I have to remember how he always makes me feel more confident and sure of myself. He supports me as I do him. Sometimes, (especially on Wednesday nights), I tend to forget that. Just two more weeks until he comes home for good.    In two weeks, I'll be okay.

      Hmm, I feel I must post about my fun-filled weekend in order to get away from the current unpleasantness.  Here I go.  This past weekend Steven and I went to Willis' lake house on Lay Lake with Ken, Lisa, Ande,  Paul ( who came on Sunday), and Willis, of course.  We were planning on leaving Saturday morning, but after a late-night run to Wal-Mart on Friday, we decided to go ahead and hit the road as none of us were really tired.  Due to a vet meeting, Lisa and Ande couldn't make it till midday Saturday.  It was quite a blast.  We all were mostly relaxing by sleeping late, lounging around, and eating.  We even had a hammock, which I ever so gracefully fell out of.  Everyone even swam in the lake, including me (after a little bit of coaxing and a promise of a float).    There were some fireworks left from the Fourth of July which we shot on Saturday night.  They were the spectacular mortar shell kind and some Roman candles.  We made the shots from the candles skip across the slew.  That was beyond amusing to me.    One of us got the Bright Idea(tm) of sticking sparklers in leftover slices of watermelon and launching them in the slew (I think it was me).  We soon discovered that watermelon prefers to float rind-side-up; we lost a few sparklers that way.  At the end, we finally got one launched, but with one ill-advised push, it did a barrel-roll like the others.  The next day, the ants were quite appreciative of all the free watermelon.  The next afternoon at lunch, Willis' dad said, "Now I know there's got to be a reason behind this . . .what is the deal with the watermelon by the dock?"  He was met with peals of laughter.  I also got to have a few rides in a boat.  I like boats (simple minds, simple pleasures . . .).  We tried to find our friend the Thornburg's house, but I don't think we went north enough.  On Sunday, however, we did run out of gas.  Thanks to the kindness of strangers, it turned out to be a very amusing experience, mostly because of what Willis said.  Can't repeat it, though.  The original plan was for Steven and I to leave about 3 p.m., head to Auburn, pick up the kitties from Cathy, and I'd get back in Fort Payne about 9 p.m.  Ha, ha, ha.  I ended up staying 'till 8 p.m., heading immediately back to Fort Payne, and Steven is keeping the kitties for a week.  I miss my babies, but I believe Steven is enjoying their company.  They're being quite good for him.  There you have it, folks; my amusing weekend.  Let's do that again!

      Since the posts of this morning, PK has either deleted all of her previous posts back into May or she has hidden them away from everybody who is not her 'friend.'  What a way to argue.  I opened up a LiveJournal account so I do not have to post anonymously anymore; a few of my friends have one of these accounts.  You can go  urlLink here  to see my latest reply to PK.  I had to put in a first post, so I posted that.  Feel free to comment, whoever you are.  Here in my online nation, I do not censor anybody, even if they are mental.

      An aquaintance of both my sister and I posted an attack on my sister for not inviting her to her wedding of last month.  It upset us all, and we both replied to her posts with my reply at 1:30 this morning.  An hour later I was censored by her removal of my post.  Oh my, but she has awoken the beast.  What follows is my original reply that was written between midnight and 1:30 this morning, the 12th of July.  It has not been edited since then.  I am not posting this to try to appeal to Katie (PK), it is an effort on my part to clear my sister and her husband's name of any supposed wrongdoing.    _______________________________  To clarify, this is Carrie Paulk Williams, sister of Cathy.  To start, I understand the First Amendment; you have a right to say what you want to say to whomever you want to say it.  I am not mad at you because you ranted.  What I am, however, is absolutely disgusted, saddened, and infuriated at your reasoning behind these posts.  So I shall use my First Amendment right to counterpoint you.  First, to clarify parts where I am mentioned.  You state in your reply to Cathy's post that you "didn't expect to be invited to Carrie's [wedding]."  And yet, in the second sentence of your first post, you complain that being left out of a wedding invite is the "second time this happened in the same freaking family," referring to my wedding of six months past.  If you didn't expect to be invited to mine, why are you upset that this is the "second time" this has happened?  How contradictory.  Any information you received about our wedding was most likely given in response to your questions.  I cannot vouch for Sharon, Willis, and the others, but I know all the information you received from Steven was in response to your repeated questions.  He disliked giving you the details, but he felt it rude to say, "We're not telling you that."  Neither of us ever came up to you to tell you all about the wedding plans.    That takes care of the direct references to me.  Now on to your attack on my sister.  Indeed, it was an attack.  You meant for it to be heard.  If you did not, you would not have a link to your weblog from your buddy profile.  Cathy is not nor has ever been a spiteful, mean person, yet you talk as if she did not send you an invitation as a personal affront to you.  How dare you suggest such a thing of my sister.  You speak as if you were the best of friends and she stabbed you in the back.  Oh, I know you state later that you were never "super close friends with" Cathy and Jason, but you sure give a different impression in your first post.  You list these ridiculous vague ties with Cathy and Jason, such as "former roommate's [Jason's] girlfriend (now ex)," you "were there the night they got engaged," and the groom wanted to sign your cast, among others.  Whether you thought you were "super close friends" or not, it reads as if you felt like you were a shoe-in for an invitation.  Now, to counterpoint your vague references mentioned above.  "[F]ormer roommate's girlfriend (now ex)" -- Yes, Jason and Paul were once roommates.  Yes, you and Paul used to date.  Later, you two broke up.   If I remember correctly, this was about three years ago.  You moved on.  Later you make a reference to Sharon's ex-boyfriend being invited, so therefore you should have been, too.  Cathy is friends with that boy; it had nothing to do with him once dating Sharon.    You were "there the night they got engaged."  Um, that reads to me like you were actually there the moment when Jason proposed.  That is certainly not true: they were by themselves on campus. Immediately afterwards they came to me and Steven to tell us the news, where they also called their respective parents.  Then they went to tell their best friend, Sharon.  You just happened to be visiting Sharon when Cathy and Jason showed up.  They had no intention of hunting you out to give you the news.  Now about the Jason wanted to sign your cast comment -- he wanted to sign it because he had never signed a cast before.  That had nothing to do with you specifically, it is just one of those simple pleasures in life that Jason has not yet gotten to experience.  It's a petty little thing, but you made it even pettier by presenting it as an argument for a wedding invitation.  It is a similar situation with the argument of Jason sending you links to their registry and wedding website.  He was so excited about the entire thing, he wanted to share his joy with everybody.  It did not insinuate that he wanted you to buy them something or wanted you to come.  I believe you read too much into these little actions.   ________________________  You state in your second post that you found Cathy's apology "more upsetting" than if she had just lied to you and said, " '[O]ops, we forgot.' "  Terribly sorry, but it is not Cathy, Jason's, or anyone else's job to placate you so you can feel better about yourself.  That is your own job.  I am flabberghasted that you would suggest it is others' responsibility to make you feel good.  That whole idea goes too deep for this conversation.  It is a problem.  You also state in your second post that what you find "paticularly stinging is the fact that some of the people that were invited they [Cathy and Jason] rarely talk to and yet the groom talked to [you] a good number of times and they are deemed 'important enough' and [you were] not."  Who exactly are you referring to?  I have already gone over Sharon's ex-boyfriend's friendship with Cathy and Jason; the only other person I can think of is Paul. If you think that Jason and Paul have not talked in three years, you are mistaken.  They talk reguarly; they have stayed friends.  Cathy has also known Paul since high school.  If you are referring to any other people than these two, please put them forth.     _____________________________  You used your weblog to vent your grievances; that is what they can be used for, among other things.  I do not have a problem with this fact.  You spoke your mind so that others, including Cathy and Jason, could know.  This weekend, they read your post, and they knew.  They were understandably upset, but they did not reply right away.  In fact, they waited a few hours to cool down before they replied.  They chose to give an apology.  It may not have explained themselves fully or gone over your issues point by point, but they apologized, out in the open for everyone to see.    What did you do with it?  You threw it back in their face as soon as you read it.  You did this out in the open as well, for everyone to see.  You gave yourself no chance to collect your thoughts; it was posted in the height of very misplaced hurt and anger.  What do you want from them?  What can they say to make you happy?  I do know one thing:  they will not say they made a mistake in not inviting you.  This whole debacle of the weblog justifies their decision, in my opinion.  You state that Cathy and Jason's apology can be summed up as "you're not important" to them.  I'm afraid you've hit the nail on the head:  you're not important.  That is the facts and you need to accept it.  You cannot be best friends with everybody.  You can, however, be annoying to everybody.  Amazing how that works.  ____________________________  As I said before, you have your First Amendment rights.  But you must use those rights with a degree of respect.  By these posts that you have sent online, you have disrespected my sister, her husband, their friends, and their family, including Steven and me.  Cathy and Jason were under ABSOLUTELY NO OBLIGATION to invite you to anything.  Even if they had so much as told you to your face that you were going to be sent an invitation, they would not have been obligated to send you one.  No matter what signals from Cathy and Jason that you express you received, you were not guaranteed anything.    The fact that you expected anything from Cathy and Jason is revolting.  Yes, the First Baptist Church of Auburn is "big enough" and one more person would not have "cramped [their] style."  However, your specific presence would have 'cramped their style,' as you put it.  To put it extremely bluntly, you were not wanted, just as you were not wanted at my wedding.  For you to expect to be wanted is sadly optimistic.  You should not lash out at others because you think they cause you unhappiness.  Truly happy people do not let the actions of others cause such grief and distress as you express has happened to you due to the lack of a wedding invitation.  All you end up doing is hurting yourself and others.  I am one of those 'others,' notice it is one o'clock in the morning while I am sending this message to you.    If you have anything more to say, you do it through private e-mail or by phone.  My e-mail address is hissineedyou@gmail.com and my phone  number is 256-996-9890.  Do not mess with the Paulk girls.

      There is a little town in Alabama by the name of Steele, which I had the unexpected pleasure of visiting a few weeks ago.  I veered into it when my little Ford Contour (yeah, I know) decided it's true call in life was horse impersonation and began bucking back and forth.  Here's an interesting fact I learned about Steele:  in Steele, it is apparently customary for the boss of the car repair shop to take the (only) car computer mind-reader with them when they go to a doctor's appointment.  Surprising, yes?  I was surprised, too.  The only diagnosis my car received while I was there was a noticeable separating of the left back tire, which was a totally different problem.  Dad rescued me and the two kitties from the small town of Steele where my car sat until the next day when she was diagnosed and repaired; all without my permission.  It was ~$182.00, which wouldn't have been so bad if she had actually been fixed.  On the way home, as the car bucked and tried with all her might to neigh, Steven uttered the magic words to me:  "Let's get rid of this car."    Ask and you shall receive, baby.    That afternoon I was on a Saturn lot, where my mother had just gotten a new car the week before.  The next day we stopped by a Honda lot; I wanted to see those Elements I had been eyeing since their first commercial.  The next evening, after a rousing session of over-the-phone haggling, I was at a Honda dealership in Chattanooga signing papers.  It was a very 'grown-up' moment for me, if that makes any sense.  Even the negotiating process was amusing; I was conducting an orchestra of dealerships across the tri-state area, all straining their calculators to be heard.  It was a lovely counterpoint.  And now, the car.  We got a Galapagos Green 2004 Honda Element EX, auto transmission and two-wheel drive.  The 'EX' translates into things like cruise control, ABS brakes, keyless entry, power everything, yada yada.  Oh, and his name is Elliott, after the composer.  And last but not least, we got a damn good price.  Back to the Ford (who's official name is Raspberry Beret, by the by), the total bill that weekend came to a little over three hundred dollars once we replaced the two back wheels.  We didn't trade her in; we're going to try to sell her ourselves.  She was looked over by a mechanic in Alabaster who cannot re-create the horse-bucking, so we've just got to get the title and she's on the market.  I haven't told her any of this yet.  She's still in Alabaster (never made it back to Fort Payne), so she hasn't seen Elliott yet.  I've had her eight long years; I'm gonna cry.  Hey, anybody want a 1996 Ford Contour?  She's got auto transmission, ABS brakes, power everything, midnight red color (read: dark purple), 81,000 miles.  I am going to cry, though.  _________________________________  And to those of you who think the Elements are ugly, get this:  I don't care; we love it!  _________________________________  I know this is an awful long post already, but there's just been so many life-changing events!  Life-changing event #2:  Cathy and Jason got married, yay!  Though the wedding weekend was packed full, everything went off without a hitch, much to the happiness of Cathy's nervous system.  I mostly remember all of the food.  Food, food, and yet more food was piled upon us from Thursday to Sunday.  It was all so good, too; we had to eat it all!  There was also a lot of coming and going to a plethora of meetings, appointments, practices, and parties.  The bridesmaid's luncheon, especially, was very nice.  I want to live in that old house that they turned into a restaurant.  Maybe someday it'll turn back into a house . . . and relocate a few more blocks away from the campus area.  The ceremony itself was lovely.  Nobody tripped, nobody forgot where to go or what to do, and nobody flubbed their lines . . . except a small slip-up by Jason, who was quite eager to say 'I do.'  Maybe he was thinking about that smiley-face groom's cake.    ___________________________  We are now looking at four weeks until Steven officially graduates.  What will I do without all the long-distance weekend trips in my life?  I guess we'll just have to drive down to the beach a lot to satisfy our traveling urges.  Man, I can't wait.

      Slowly, slowly things are starting to come together here in our new place. Boy, that sounds nice: 'our' new place. I think it'll be a while before I'm used to seeing Steven on weekdays. It's very enjoyable so far.  You know what's more fun than moving from one place to another? Why, moving from two places to one other, of course! We got to experience this little gem over the last week. First, we moved Steven from his college apartment to our new one. Northcutt Realty is one of Satan's own, so he had to be out the day before actual graduation. The stifling weather was more proof of Northcutt's connections with Hades: 95-100 degrees with ~70% humidity. People were breaking out in a hard sweat at six in the morning. The deed was done on time (yay!) with many thanks to Ken and Willis, who helped move that huge entertainment center though it turns out we're not gonna need it anyway.  Graduation day itself was the most relaxing day of the week -- there was no moving involved. The only sucky part was my new pair of shoes. They fit oh so perfect in the store, of course, but once we were heading toward the coliseum for the ceremony it was like my feet were strapped to a burning, pinching string of broken glass. They're getting donated.  Friday was the long-dreaded Fort Payne move, which actually went better than I had anticipated. Thank goodness for strong parents. Thank even more goodness for rare summer cold fronts that swoosh by on Thursday nights. With temperatures in the low 80's and practically no humidity, we all thought we had died and gone to Alaska.  Saturday was the last day of the Moving Extravaganza. Now all of our stuff is in this apartment in Opelika . . . it's just not all put away yet. In fact, I am sitting on the floor as I write this update. We put my desk in the dumpster in hopes of finding a more utilitarian concoctive for our computer room. With me working long distance and Steven being the software guy he is, we know we need our separate computers. I don't like his miniscule screen resolution and he hates my nifty trackball mouse. You say tomato . . .  _________________________  I never thought it would be so hard to give away stuff. Now that Steven and I are in the same place, we don't need that extra set of dishes and flatware or those ratty old towels. Between us, we had leftover kitchen stuff, extra sheets, a coffee pot, express machine, pillows . . . man, you name it, we've got an extra supply of it. We started off throwing it away as we'd come across it. Ken got great pleasure from busting up that coffee carafe.  The more we threw away, though, the more guilty we felt.  People could  use  that stuff! We'd try to pawn it off to friends and family, but everyone's answer was the same: "I've got no room." Yeah, same with us, that's why we're trying to give it away; free,  free , FREE!!!  We finally made a pile that we'd try to donate somewhere once we figured out where that 'somewhere' is.  Yesterday, I found it. Right outside the Thrift Store are these donating bin areas. Yes, place to drop off the junk! I had Elliott full of the stuff, so I opened up the back tailgate and started dragging it out.  Not two seconds after I set down that box of towels, a lady comes over to me and says, "Wow, you're just giving away all those towels?!"  "Yes,' I reply, "you want them?"  "Absolutely!" the exclaims, then proceeds to haul off the box with the help of her son.  I set down another box of kitcheny stuff and immediately another woman comes up to me and asks, "Do you know if we've gotta pay for that stuff or can we just take it?"  "Uhh, I just dropped off those two boxes there, and you're welcome to root through it," I say.  By the time I left there was a swarm of people around that stuff. It wasn't all mine, though. There was also a decent couch and some old college textbooks lying around. It was a weird feeling. I was happy to know people were gonna get some use out of that stuff, yet I felt guilty because I had no use for it myself; I felt even more guilty for the other stuff we had already busted up and thrown away. The crash of that coffee carafe will haunt me for years, I think.  _________________________  So now I'm here on the floor, slowly unpacking these masses of boxes while waiting for Steven to get back from his second day of work. So far, the new job is going well. It will be going better once he receives his first paycheck. Then maybe I won't have to sit on the floor.  Oh, amusing side note: it was one year ago today I posted my first post on this weblog. Woohoo, one year of blogging and I'm just as amused as when I started. My spelling still sucks, though.
