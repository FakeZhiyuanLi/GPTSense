      Remember that scene in "Bridget Jones's Diary" where she's thinking about being alone, and imagining that one day she'll be eaten by dogs and nobody will notice?  I can relate to that after this weekend.  It was one of those quiet times (which are so rare, I work with college students and weekends are normally no different from regular days) and I basically holed up in my apartment and slept.  It was nice not to be bothered, but kind of depressing in a way.  It's actually possible to go forty-eight hours without speaking to anyone.  Living alone can be a blessing--you can walk around naked when you get out of the shower;  nobody notices when you don't take the trash out for a day or two; drinking straight out of the orange juice carton is perfectly acceptable.  But it sucks in its own way.  When you feel like shit, nobody's there to bring you soup.  Grocery shopping is a major pain;  nothing is made for one, and then when you get home you have to cart everything inside by yourself.  Cooking feels pointless.    I guess I'm just still moody from The Boy's departure.  He used to fill a void.  Now there's an empty hole.  Granted, he was a lousy boyfriend.  But crappy companionship sometimes seems favorable to no companionship at all.  My girlfriends are terrific, but they can't take the place of intimacy.  I'm good at relationships.  At least I think so.  My tragic flaw is my inability to pick the right guys to have them with.  Nothing unusual about that.  Nothing unusual about feeling sorry for yourself, either.  I know nobody reads these rambles, but it makes me feel a little better to send them out into the universe.  I'm sure thousands can relate.  We single people need to form a vast network.  To remind each other that we're really not alone, and to share our common miserable thoughts.  In a world that moves in twos, singlehood is almost a disability.  Maybe we need an amendmant to the constitution that protects us.  From things like stares when you arrive at the movies dateless, or  from meddling friends who set you up with lousy guys because they can't stand to see you alone.  Anybody else think that's a good idea? Peace out... Peacegrrl

      This is my first post, so I'll share a little about what's going on in my life right now.  I've been dumped.  The quasi-relationship that I've been entrapped in for months is now, officially and irrevocably, over.  I suppose I should be happy.  When I knew that the inevitable was coming, that The Boy was going to cut and run pretty soon, I started making lists.  You know, kind of like a pro- and con- type thing.    Cons:  He drinks too much.  Sometimes he doesn't wash his hair.  He breaks promises.  I don't like his driving.  He's always broke.   He's scatterbrained.  He's a procrastinator.  The list went on and on, and I started thinking, what the hell was I doing with this guy in the first place?  So I moved on to the pros:  He's sexy, in his own sort of rugged way.  He's smart.  He makes me laugh. And that was all I could come up with.  I started wondering about love.  My friend A. is so practical--the guy she's with is financially stable, smart, and he cooks.  She says there's no amazing passion, but that's okay.  She wants to be safe and happy.  She went through a number of guys just like The Boy, guys with little or no ambition, who were great to roll around with but really didn't have much of a future.  And she simply cast them aside and continued on her quest for something better.  I can't seem to do that.  I always get this urge to rehabilitate, thinking that maybe I see something in these guys that nobody else sees. That if I stick it out, the great person they're destined to be will come out.  That my dedication and loyalty will pay off and I'll be truly loved.  Plus I get caught up in the good sex, too.  And where has it left me?  "I can't commit.  I just want to go out there and find out who I am."  "I'm just not sure how I feel about you."  "Yes, I said that you were all I'd ever need, and I really meant it at the time."  The lame-ass excuses, the crafted bullshit that really comes down to one thing:  I'm not the one.  I'm still in the "anger" phase of my grieving process over this relationship.  I mean, I know The Boy was bad news, but I spent so damn much time with him that he became part of my daily life--and now he's gone.  It's awful how, when I'm left behind, I try to cut that person out of my life in every way I can think of--deleting his cell phone number, throwing out pictures of him, avoiding the smell of his cologne--and yet reminders of him are absolutely everywhere, in every song on the radio, in places we used to go, restaurants where we ate (where I picked up the tab, of course).  I can't get away from the guy!  I'm moving away in two months, to a new city, a new state, and maybe, FINALLY, I'll get some peace.  My question is this, and it's not a new one:  Why do men have to be such assholes?  If you don't have feelings for us, why aren't you just honest up front?  Why do you string us along?  Don't you understand that we're always holding out hope?  I wonder, is it because you don't have the guts to tell us how you really feel, or is it because the sex is THAT good?  I just don't get it.  A quarter of a century on this planet, a zillion relationships, and I am no closer to understanding the opposite sex than I was on the day I was born.  I feel like time has been wasted.    Worst of all: I've forgotten how to navigate the dating minefield.    I don't remember the rules, my "i'm being hit on" radar is shot to hell, and I don't even know how to flirt anymore!  Shit.  Are the men in Ohio as clueless as the men in Texas?  I hope not.  I'll cheer myself, momentarily, with the thought that I'm moving on to greener pastures. -Peacegrrl

      So tonight Michael Moore's much-discussed "documentary" comes out.  I will be among those in line to see it.  I'm more than a little interested to see if it lives up to the hype--both good and bad.  I'm definitely a fan of Moore's', and I tend to agree with him more than I disagree with him.  But I'm worried.  I've heard a few disturbing things about the way this film is structured--that it leaves out a lot, that it takes things out of context, etc.  I'm certainly not upset that it's one-sided.  That's the whole damn point!  As Moore himself has said, enough people have reported about the evils of Sadaam Hussein, the evils of terrorism, the evils of the Middle East in general.  He's trying to show something else, something the media isn't terribly inclined to show--a critical view of a man who too many people take for granted as the Messiah of Judeo-Christian society.  What I'm a bit concerned about is Moore's tendency to take too many sides, as long as it's a side against Bush.  I'm worried that by making attacks that are based on actions and comments taken out of context or twisted around, we're going to end up undermining ourselves.  I don't want to see the liberal-progressive movement damaged by someone whose intentions are good, but whose methods might not have been the best. Christopher Hitchens' article on  urlLink Slate  makes a decent case.  I'm planning to go see it with an open mind--not accepting everything Moore says as the gospel truth (after all, if we do that, are we any better than the legions of Bush-worshippers?) but rather watching and listening, and maybe doing a little amateur fact-checking when I get home.  As for the other, non-political areas of my life:  friends are good, family is good, guy-i'm-talking-to-but-haven't-really-met-yet is still a mystery, The Boy continues to fade out of my conscious mind but make surprise appearances in my dreams just to remind me that he's NOT really gone yet, and work is still quiet and boring and, in its own way, exhausting.  I have an idea for a new blog, not yet sure if I'm going to go ahead with it.  One of my favorite books in the world is "Pride and Prejudice" by Jane Austen.  A social comedy that is sort of like the "Sex and the City" for early 19th century England, it begins with the line "It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in posession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife."  I started thinking about the "universally acknowledged truths" that rule our lives every day--as women, as SINGLE women, as students, as Americans, as quasi-intellectuals, as people sharing the planet.  So many of these UAT's are absolute bullshit.  I thought, wouldn't it be fun to sit down and pick a few of them apart?  Wouldn't that make a good book?  Well, the book idea is a bit epic for me, I can't even finish an essay or come to a logical conclusion on some of these blog entries.  But maybe a blog might be fun.  If I thought anybody would actually read it, I'd try it out.  This post is getting long, so it's time to go.  The weekend promises to be anti-climactic, but I'm sure I will have plenty to say after I've seen the movie.  Tootles... -pg

      It's hard to describe exactly how I'm feeling these days.  I guess "stuck in a waiting room" is the best phrase I can think of.  I'm in between leaving behind an old job and starting a new one. I'm saying goodbye to a number of things in my life--old relationships, old habits, and getting ready for a future that at this point is extremely blurry.  I'm second-guessing the decisions that I've made.  It's a very, very weird place to be.  I saw The Boy two days ago.  He made a surprise appearance at my doorstep.  And I guess now I can see things a little more clearly than I could before.  I said before that he dumped me, and that's not altogether true.  The truth is he sort of left me behind.  But I realize that it had to end the way it did--he doesn't know where on earth he's going, so how can I expect him to take me with him?  Seeing him was bittersweet.  It gave me closure that I've needed for a long time, gave me a longing for something that I got so close to.  I mourn for what we didn't have and what we almost were.  But I have faith that there was a reason for all of it.  If I didn't believe that, I don't think I could live.  I've met someone new, okay, not really "met" yet, just pseudo-talking to him, one of the miracles of the informational age.  The funny thing about all of that is that I'm more worried that he'll like me than I am that he won't.  I'm about to move, so what's the point of starting something?  Meeting someone new is so damned scary, anyway.  Will he live up to the hype?  Is he anything like the person he says he is?  Am I anything like the person I say I am?  Will I be good enough?  There were times when marriages were arranged, when you didn't meet the person you were meant to spend the rest of your life with until the morning before you exchanged vows.  I'm not saying that was a good system, but in some ways it seems to beat the amount of time wasted blindly searching for someone to complete us.  It's all such a damned headache and I just wish it would be over.    There really isn't much to say tonight.  The wait goes on, I have a long list of unpleasant tasks to attend to (packing, for one), and the day I start an entirely new life is coming closer and closer.  What the hell am I thinking, running off in the world like this, leaving everyone behind?  I know, it's not like I'm off to Venezuela or anything, but still, it's the first big move of my life. Some people never venture more than a few hours away from their hometowns.  I don't even have a hometown.  I'm ready to move and terrified to move at the same time.  So much is going on, and at the same time it feels like my world is at a complete and total standstill.  What an oxymoron my life is becoming... -Peacegrrl

      So it's time to stop talking about The Boy!  I know it, you know it, we all know it.  There is so much more to life, and looking back on my entries I can see how one-dimensional I seem to be.  So now for something completely different...  Okay, the reality is that my life is rather lame and lonely just at the moment.  I live in a dinky little town, so my time is spent between Austin and San Antonio visiting friends.  And all and all, I think their lives are a lot more interesting than mine.  There's Alicia, who lives in San Antonio and has a fantastic guy in her life.  She's kind of the "voice of reason" in my life--where I'm scatterbrained and overemotional, she is mature and logical.  I used to work with her, and she was a great mentor--I probably owe any professional growth I've managed to achieve in the past three years to her calming influence.  Then there's Jenny, who lives just outside of San Antonio with two male roommates.  I love hearing stories of the latest news in the house, what the boys are up to lately, from J.'s older-sister perspective.  And there's my boy K-dog, who lives up in Austin.  We discuss politics and I listen to him puzzle out his girlfriend issues, while he listens to my insecurities and yells at me.    And there are lots of other buddies spread all over the place, Lisa and Sarah from college, James from high school, Kristina over in San Marcos.  I have this terrific support network, and it's ridiculous how rarely I reach out to them.  When I have a problem, I totally withdraw into myself and refuse to contact the people who would help if I'd just ask for it.  What is it about our twenties that makes us feel so isolated?  Is it because we're done with college and we're not running into each other in class every day?  Are we just too damned tired after our forty-hour workweeks and the stress of figuring out the next career move?  How can we be too tired to have friends?  It's completely ridiculous.  I'm more than likely going to be leaving the state in a month, and I'm suddenly spending all of this time with the people close to me.  Why did it take an impending move for me to reach out?    These are all questions that nobody has the answers to, and this post really has no point.  I suppose the bottom line is that I'm blessed and I'm quick to forget it.  If I'm isolated, it's because I choose to be.  The people are there--I just have to make the effort to support them as much as they support me. -pg

      I haven't posted in a few weeks, mainly because I was convinced I didn't have anything interesting to say.  But nobody's reading this thing anyway, so why should I self-edit?    The truth is that I'm in an "absence makes the heart grow fonder" phase.  Instead of steadily getting over The Boy, I'm missing him more every day.  It really is pathetic.  The number of cigarettes I smoke every day is directly proportional to how lousy I'm feeling about the demise of our quasi-relationship, and I'm sorry to say that the number continues to creep up.  I hate being this way, really, I do.  I'm sad and grumpy and generally feeling sorry for myself.  People have different theories on how to cope with this sort of ordeal.  Some say that rebound sex is the way to go.  But there's no one around here for that, and besides, I don't really know if it's my thing.  I've sent some not-too-subtle signals to a friend of a friend, and we'll see if anything comes of it, but I'm not optimistic.  Besides, I have no doubt that it would be disappointing even if it did happen.  Another theory is that you should throw yourself into work.  Work, it is assumed, will make you forget all about the tragedies of your personal life.  Unfortunately, I work in college student affairs, and it's summer.  There aren't any student affairs in summer.  So work is boring, non-challenging, and sadly not anything to throw myself into at the moment.  I've been down this road before, and I guess my coping strategy is to just take it a day at a time.  I'm moving soon, and I know that the adjustment of a new home, new responsibilities, and an entirely new social circle will probably distract me enough that I won't be sulking all the time.  I can't wait to get the hell out of here.  In the meantime, the limbo continues.  The Boy will fade away into the recesses of my mind once enough time has gone by.  I just wish there was a way to hurry the process up a little. -Peacegrrl

      So much crap has happened in the two weeks since I actually updated this thing that I barely know where to start! It seems forever ago that I was anxious and bored at work and bitching and moaning about needing sex. Although everything seems to work in cycles...in two weeks from now, I could very well be bored at work and bitching and moaning about needing sex yet again. Let's hope that the change of scenery will lead to a change in the mindlessly boring cycles of my life!  So, first off, Guy update. Yeah, so we got together a lot before I left, we had some seriously good times, and now I'm 1500 miles away. Shit. Not that we didn't know this was coming. And I have absolutely no regrets. I may be missing the mark, and he may not agree, but I thought we had a pretty good connection. We had fun together, we laughed, we got drunk, we had good times. I really, really liked this guy. Being a typical, overanalyzing female, I find myself wondering about the purpose of our truncated relationship. Was it a just another fling? Was he a rebound guy, to help me recover from The Boy? Or did I totally find this perfect guy for me and blow my big chance with bad timing? Something was definitely blooming. I suppose I could be pessimistic and say "it's better this way, he would eventually have gotten sick of me, or I would have gotten sick of him, and it would have ended badly." But that's bullshit rationalization. I miss him and I wish he was here. When I left I didn't say anything about trying the long-distance thing, even though part of me really wanted to--we had barely met, after all, and I didn't want to freak him out or be unfair to him. But now I'm here and he's there and I just wish it didn't have to be over. Of course, let's not rule out the possibility that I'm being overdramatic and he just saw me as a temporary diversion (and I certainly wouldn't blame him; I told him once that I was the perfect girl for any guy with committment issues--two weeks and I'm gone!). But if not I guess I just have to believe that if things are supposed to come together for us, they will. I told him that I miss him, and I guess that if he misses me too, that's a start.  And that's enough melodrama for tonight. On to other exciting topics! Leaving TLU, for example. It was a good thing. There was a sort of insincere party thing to send me off, obviously thrown together at the last minute and piggybacked with another staff member who happened to be leaving at the same time. But it was still kind of fun. There was the cool "last night out" thing at Dave and Buster's with all of my best friends, followed by a great night with The Guy. When I left the office for the last time, I sure as hell wasn't sad about it. Something interesting that I discoverd, though, is how easy it was to tell who my real friends were. J, for example, pulled her usual antisocial bullshit and ditched out on my D&B party, which pissed me off royally. And then there's Rita, the office secretary, who didn't even bother to say goodbye to me! What the hell? I was always nice to Rita! Hell, when she took her annual three-week vacation where she leaves us high and dry with no idea of what she's in the middle of, I ALWAYS make it a point to clean her desk and organize her messages before she gets back. Guess I shouldn't have bothered! My overemotional former coworker must have told her something nasty about me. Screw it. Why dwell on the negative? I have more good friends than lousy ones. Like Kendall and Alicia, who helped me pack the evil U-haul late into Friday night, and Kyle who showed up unexpectedly and helped out. And Kristina and Ann, who gave me a kick-ass Austin night out and a terrific going-away gift. And of course Toi, my office buddy. I miss all of these people so damn much that it's crazy! And I hope we keep in touch. I suppose only time will tell.  Well, I have lots of things to say about the state of affairs in the world, the Democratic National Convention, etc., etc., and I'm sure I'll have plenty of humorous observations about the differences between Ohioans and Texans to share, but right now my hands are cold because it's freezing in this fucking office. So stay tuned. In the meantime, go to  urlLink Obama's website  and check out one cool dude who, with any luck, might just be running for president in a decade or two. -pg

      For those of you faithful readers wondering where the hell I've been, I'm up north!  The drive to Ohio came to a conclusion late Monday night.  Most of the week has been frantic, but now that the weekend's here, I plan to do some serious sitting around on my ass, and I'll update this blog with all of the interesting tidbits from the last week or two.  Just wanted to let everyone know I'm still alive! -pg

      Holy crap, Blogger has made the posting application all fancy;&nbsp; we can change fonts and center text without having to put on our HTML secret-decoder ring.&nbsp; I don't know if I can handle all the excitement!&nbsp; I'm distracted by the fancy buttons above the text window...  &nbsp;  I do have a point today.&nbsp; Don't I always?&nbsp; Found a funny website:&nbsp;  urlLink WTF is it now? &nbsp; Pretty cool, anti-Bush, of course, with lots of funny pictures and quotes.&nbsp; It's a little flashy--animated graphics are irritating, and some of the image links don't work.&nbsp; But worth a look.  &nbsp;  So I'm psyched,  urlLink Murphy  has linked to my blog.&nbsp; I feel so&nbsp;validated!&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I haven't heard from The Guy since Tuesday.&nbsp; This is not a big deal.&nbsp; I guess not.&nbsp; I suppose I'm only tempted to obsess because The Big Move is only a week away.&nbsp; I will defer further comment until more time has passed and I've convinced myself that I somehow blew my latest quasi-relationship.&nbsp; Stay tuned.  &nbsp;  Work sucks, there is nothing for me to do but sit here and tell you about it.&nbsp; Exactly three years ago today, I reported to TLU for work for the first time.&nbsp; And now there's only a week left.&nbsp; I suppose that warrants some reflection, but for the time being I just want to get the hell out of here.&nbsp; Truth be told, I would have quit a month ago, but for the fact that I needed all the paycheck I could get!&nbsp; And I've stashed enough vacation time away that my last check will be pretty flush.&nbsp; Good thing, because I'm pulling out the plastic to pay for the trailer, the gas, and the cheap hotels.&nbsp; Three days on the road with no access to my blog!&nbsp; How the hell will I survive?&nbsp; I'm worried, too, because it sounds like I'll be the last of the new people to arrive.&nbsp; Maybe I'll be known as "the mysterious girl from Texas" and everyone will want to be my friend.&nbsp; Who knows.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  There are so&nbsp;many things to be worried about, it's hard to choose just one to focus on.&nbsp; Last night I tried Tequiza and a&nbsp;bubble bath to distract myself.&nbsp; I think it was a bad call.&nbsp; I drank too much and ended up depressed and hot.&nbsp; In both the literal and figurative senses.&nbsp; The blog is probably not the most appropriate place to share it, but I really need some action.&nbsp; Sex is the best tension-breaker that I can think of.&nbsp; It's relaxing, provides an excellent workout, relases excess emotion, and nearly always leads to a good night's sleep.&nbsp; And it's ever so much better with a nice, smart guy to share it with.&nbsp; Sigh.  &nbsp;  Well, now that the reader knows more than they wanted to, I will shut up and get back to non-work.&nbsp; I'll be out of here by 3 today, I know it.&nbsp; I'll use packing as an excuse, and then I'll go home and read O magazine and watch Sex and the City and worry about whether or not The Guy will want to get together this weekend.&nbsp; Sounds like fun!  -Peacegrrl

      Must-read for today:  Jim Wallis's commentary about Jerry Falwell and the religious right on  urlLink Sojo.   It's incredibly refreshing to have someone criticize the fact that conservative Christians seem to catagorize "morals" only in terms of who gets an abortion and whether or not it's okay for two people who love each other to get married.  Never mind corruption, poverty, and unjustified war.  This article really blew me away.  Thank God for people like Jim Wallis, who fight the psycho far-righters who give Christians a bad name.    As for the anxious title of my blog, well, that word seems appropriate for the way I've been feeling (and acting) lately.  My friend A and I went out to dinner last night and she said that I was so jumpy she was starting to think I was in a hurry to get away from her.  I guess it's all about this damn move.  I'm a nervous wreck because it's so close and I feel like there are too many loose ends that aren't going to be tied off.  Time is ticking away, and I feel like I'm standing on the edge of a cliff.  The Guy adds a new dimension of impatience.  Why couldn't I have met him a year ago?  I'm actually seeing someone who I'm not afraid to be myself with, and who seems okay with that, emotional baggage and all.  And--BAM!  It will practically be over before it begins.  I work, he works, and we both have social lives, so that amounts to us maybe getting together one or two more times before I'm out of here.  And what happens after that?  I have no idea, if anything.  So I'm fidgety over that, wondering when we'll meet up again, while simultaneously  doing the early relationship thing:  agonizing and overanalyzing over whether or not he really likes me (which ALL women do, no matter how comfortable with ourselves we profess to be).  There is WAY too much going on right now and I feel like I'm about to explode!  So what's a girl to do?  Perservere, I guess.  What else is there?  Take it one minute at a time.  I'll be fine, I know, and I'll be glad I decided to move, once I get there.  Everything will work out for the best.  I have to keep telling myself that or I'll go nuts!  In the meantime it's my job to keep the hysteria at bay. -peacegrrl

      So I think I should make them shorter.  My babbling habit must be curbed.  I've actually discovered that technically, a blog is a place to comment on what you see on the web, while an online journal is where you're supposed to go on and on about your life. So maybe I'm misusing my blogging powers.  Too bad.  This is easy and I'm lazy!  Speaking of babbling, I went on the third date with The Guy (notice he's a GUY, not just a BOY!  I'm growing up!  It's so exciting!) and I was my usual nervous self.  And those of you who know me are well aware that nervousness, with me, leads to babbling.  And off I went.  That's why it's a good thing I read a lot and stay well-informed about the world.  It lends a sort of pseudo-intelligence to my babbling, and, I suppose, makes it bearable.  He seemed cool with it.  He obviously must be, because he continues to want to see me.  I'm starting to get bummed about the whole thing.  I mean, I can see that this really might be the beginning of something--that is, if I were sticking around.  Since I'm not, I'm not sure where it's going, if anywhere, and the abbreviation is sad.  But it's good to remember what it's like to date.  And it's REALLY good to actually date, not just use eating and watching movies as the precursor to sex.  I'd almost forgotten that people actually do that!  How refreshing.  Now for the real "blog" part of this entry.  Check out  urlLink Beliefnet.   There are so many groovy things about this site.  The "Belief-o-matic" will tell you where you stand, spiritually (you may be very surprised with the results).  There are communities for practically every religion imaginable, information on meditation, news, stuff on natural medicine, and even "SoulMatch," a new matchmaking tool (haven't checked it out yet, though).  And there's a whole section on faith and politics.  I'm discovering how incredibly important it is for spiritual progressives and liberals to speak the hell up.  The only voice for faith right now is coming from the right, and that's bullshit!  Contrary to popular belief, Dubya is NOT the Jesus of the 21st century!  Anyway, back to the subject at hand, Beliefnet is cool, check it out.  And that's all for today, folks!  Two more weeks until the big trip, and I'm sure they will be eventful, so check back often, you five faithful readers! -pg

      What can I share today?  Well, first off, I want my blog to be as cool as  urlLink this one.   Funny, insightful, and very, very twentysomething.  Plus I linked to this hilarious blog about people who deserve a  urlLink beatdown.   Read it and you'll laugh your ass off.  It's friday, and who knows what the weekend will bring?  My sister is allegedly coming to visit, but I haven't heard from her in over 24 hours so I have the feeling she's going to cancel.  I'm hoping to hang out with K-dog at some point, and the former-mystery-guy.  I think I like this guy, which is both very cool and rather depressing!  I leave town in two weeks.  Sometimes timing just absolutely sucks.  And I've decided that I'm terrible at dating.  It's all such a damn game, when you think about it.  When you realize that you like someone, you're not supposed to be obvious about it because that means you're easy.  If you don't like them, you can't be obvious about that either, because that's rude.  There's nervousness, and distress over what to wear (which I think is absolute bullshit and I don't know why I buy into it).  There's the whole "will-he-call-should-i-call-him-what-if-he-doesn't-really-like-me-after-all-damn-and-i-thought-he-was-nice-i-guess-i'll-die-alone-after-all" female melodrama thing.  And don't get me started on the whole sex thing.  Don't you just love hormones and the dance that goes along with them--will we have sex?  How soon is too soon?  Three dates?  Four?  Am I a slut if I do it earlier than that?  Will the relationship be doomed?  Can we talk about sex?  And of course when you get further along, it gets worse:  how much sex have you had?  Protected sex?  When was your last HIV test?  Modern times are a PAIN IN THE ASS.  Why can't it be like the sixties when everybody was screwing everybody else and nobody cared?  I take that back, that's kind of gross.  But anyway, getting to the point of this ramble, what frustrates me about dating and the whole American social ritual is how artificial it seems to be.  We are so afraid to just be who we are.  At least I am.  I have a tendency to tell people EVERYTHING way too soon, and that always leads to me getting fucked over in some way.  So I try to hold back, and I end up sounding like an asshole.  Enough of that.  I saw a good movie last night, "House of Sand And Fog."  Don't watch it if you're into that fairy-tale-ending thing, though--it's depressing.  I went to bed depressed, and then woke up to Senator Rockefeller reporting on the Senate Intelligence Committee's report on pre-Iraq intelligence.  Turns out that it should be called pre-Iraq BULLSHIT.  "A massive intelligence failure."  He said that if Congress had known then what we know now about how fucked up our information was, they never would have voted to authorize the use of force in Iraq.  Well, NO SHIT.  I'm sure the Republicans will put a lovely spin on the issue, "at least we got Sadaam out, everyone is happier now."  Right.  They're thrilled.  So are the hundreds of Americans grieving for their sons and daughters who died for faulty intelligence.  Whoo-hoo for America!  I love my country, but I hate it when we blindly follow and refuse to THINK.  Okay, as I've mentioned, I'm not smart enough to do the political commentary thing so I'd better stop.  It's Friday, time to be happy!  And I've gone on long enough, so goodbye for now... -peacegrrl

      In response to the overwhelming demand (okay, not really, only two people that I know of actually read this thing), I've decided to add a new feature to Peacegrrl's World: PolitiBlogs.  See, I'm a liberal, but I'm not always particularly well-spoken (or written, as the case may be).  There are legions of progressives out there who are smarter than I am. There's no need for me to compete.  And besides, this blog is supposed to be a whine about my life, not a political commentary (I'm not nearly intelligent enough to take on the task).  So I'm going to create a list of blogs that I've seen that say it a lot better than I ever could.  I've looked at all of these blogs, and they're smart (no stupid grammatical errors), well-written (meaning they back up what they say), and, in some cases, pretty damn funny.  I'm not going to agree 100% with all of them, but let's face it, they're going to be fairly one-sided.  Hey, I'm not a reporter, and I have no obligation to be fair and balanced!  So look for this new feature to be added soon...as soon as I get back from lunch.  Anybody want some of the latest Peacegrrl News?  Well, I spent a record-breaking four full days with my family this weekend, which was fun, refreshing, and about one day too long.  I love my family, I truly do.  But let's face it:  going home when you have PMS is NEVER a good idea.  The best thing about the weekend (besides the food, of course) was the bonding time with my mom and sister.  And I spent some quality time with Mimi the Wonderdog.  Weird to think that I probably won't be back again until Thanksgiving or Christmas.  Let's see, other headlines of note:  I reserved a U-Haul and packed two more boxes.  The move is inching closer.  I also met the mystery guy, who is very nice, and unfortunately I will probably begin forging a meaningful friendship with him just as I'm getting ready to take off.  Other noteworthy events:  my friend Lisa has started a blog!  So far it only has one entry, but I'm looking forward to a regular dose of Lisa wisdom.  I'm a firm believer that everyone should have a blog.  Most of them are crappy, and nobody really reads them, but it is highly cathartic to send your deep thoughts out there.  It's the modern-day message in a bottle.  And that's all for now, folks... -Peacegrrl

      Well, I'm sure that the whopping three people who read this blog are waiting to read what I thought of Fahrenheit 9/11.  And I've hesitated to say anything...because I don't think I'm smart enough to put into words even HALF of the things this film made me think and feel.    Conservatives and the Fox News Network are practically on fire, pointing out any inconsistency, "inaccuracy," and ambiguous statement they can find.  Rumors abound that the conservatives are actually funding a movie to be titled "Michael Moore Hates America."  Ultra-conservative groups are lobbying theatres to revoke the first amendment and refuse to show this movies--and in many cases, they have been successful.  Did the King Ranger Cinema in Seguin show F 9/11 last week?  How about the Cinema 10 in Huntsville?  Don't think so.  Dubya spokespersons have denounced the film as false (even though they haven't seen it, of course).  But thousands of us decided to keep our mouths shut, line up at the theatres, and see it for ourselves.  What we saw was footage we'll never see on CNN.  Questions we'd never thought to ask.  Crowds of like-minded individuals trying to get a handle on what's going wrong in this country.  And when the movie was over, we applauded.  I'll leave it to the experts to write the reviews:   urlLink military and 9/11 families,   urlLink the New York Daily News,  and  urlLink Roger Ebert.   Was the movie factual?  Check out  urlLink The Ithaca Times  for a fact-check that's a little less biased than that Bill O'Reilly asshole.  Go see the movie, and when you leave the theatre so angry and overwhelmed that you're shaking, come home and log onto  urlLink Stop Bush in 2004.com  to find out what you can do.    The movie isn't perfect;  there are a few bones I'd like to pick with Mr. Moore (what was with the stereotyping of countries like The Netherlands during the "Coalition of the Willing" segment?).  But the bottom line is that it makes you think, and that's the point.  This country that's supposed to be "for the people" really has nothing to do with us, and it's time to change that.  As long as people like Michael Moore ask the hard questions and tell us the things we didn't really think we wanted to hear, maybe there's still some hope for us. -pg

      "A vote for change is a vote for a stronger, safer, healthier America.  A vote for Bush is a vote for a divided, unstable, paranoid America.  It is our duty to this beautiful land to let our voices be heard."  -Dave Matthews  that's the right on, man, you said it all. -pg

      It's sunday night, and of course I'm back in the no sleep zone. I think homesickness is settling in. I miss alicia, I miss k-dog, I miss my tx state buddies. It's freakin' 50 degrees outside and I think I'm actually starting to miss the godawful Texas heat. I DON'T miss the office politics, but I'm sure there are new ones to be had up here once I've settled in a little more. I miss The Guy, and even The Boy (but only a little and don't tell anybody). I miss smoking in the middle of the night, sitting outside on my steps in the humidity and hanging out with the lightening bugs. Bleh.  Really it's not so bad, so don't anybody go feeling sorry for me. This is the shit that happens when I stay up too late and think too much. I'm actually having fun up here and glad I made the move. I'm just having a pessimistic moment.  Go  urlLink here , it's funny shit.  That's all for tonight. -pg

      They are indeed. Just sitting there taunting me from inside of their tupperwear house. Hopefully some staffmates will come by and make them disappear, before I do!  Enough about that. Let's take a moment to sigh at the cute coworker who decided to wear a tight white t-shirt for Casual Friday. [insert wistful sigh here] At least it's something to look at during training sessions... Seriously, I'm going to do my damnedest to avoid an office crush--we all know that these are never a good idea, fun diversions though they may be. Of course it happens that the only two straight, nonmarried guys happen to be on my particular staff. One is not well-liked by everybody else, and okay, he is a little funny-looking, but everyone knows I tend to be attracted to wierdos... and the other, white t-shirt-wearing dude is actually a nice guy. Cute and not an asshole...that puts him out of my league! The last time I started to land one of those I moved away two weeks later! :-) I'm really starting to sound like a freak to my friends, what with this preoccupation towards men. I'm actually getting on my own nerves! Is this some kind of biological clock bullshit? Who knows. Maybe I just physiologically need more sex than most women. Hmmm....  I've been babbling to everyone about how much I love  urlLink Modest Mouse  so I figured I'd spread the obsession to my blog. "Float On" will definitely win you over, even if you're not a modern rock fan. Definitely beats some of the other meaningless pseudo-punk-rock-clones I've been hearing lately.  Since we're on the subject, let me just say how much I HATE the fact that you have to look so damned hard to find decent music these days. You can't depend on the radio anymore (although there's a nice independant station out of Akron that I'm liking), and MTV is a string of shitty reality shows. If you want to fill your head with good sounds and good lyrics, you have to make a deliberate effort in this pop-fluff-dominated world. Anything that follows the "make a quick buck" formula gets thrust into heavy rotation until you can't go anywhere without hearing it.  And when a good band DOES make it, they're called a sellout, so the real artists stay right below the surface and they're easy to overlook. Just want to give a public shoutout to National Public Radio and The Guy for exposing me to such fanatastic stuff as  urlLink Wilco ,  urlLink Ben Kweller , and the above mentioned MM.  Don't let the damn corporate slutbags who run the media tell you who you should be listening to!   End of rant.  Wow, I spent an entire paragraph bitching about something besides politics and men.  Go me.  I guess now I need to be productive.  This will unfortuantely be a working weekend, but I'm going to go out and get my swerve on tonight.  Let's hope I'm good and hung over tommorow morning!  Happy friday to all... -peacegrrl

      ...as my sister would say. I just have to take a moment to say something nice and judgmental about that awful "Redneck Girls" song that I inadvertantly heard one of the custodians blaring a minute ago...hmm, "hell yeah" to a legacy of stupidity, poverty, sexism, and racism. Country music...i can only sigh and scratch my head...  Big woo-hoo for Alicia and her acceptance into the PhD program....yeah man, that's "Dr. Alicia" to you...  okay, back to training now, and i left my milkshake in my apartment so I MUST retrieve it...i need the chocolatey goodness to help me survive another hour of "how to be an effective supervisor." -pg

      It's too damn cold in here. Although I think I'm liking it up north; I drove all around town the other day without turning on the air conditioning in my car, which is virtually UNHEARD of where I come from. We'll see how happy I am when everything turns into ice and I go sliding down the hill on my ass, though.  So Alicia says that I don't talk about her enough on the blog! I was going to ramble on and on about her to make her feel better, but then it occured to me that I use this blog primarily as a place to bitch, so Alicia, do you really WANT me to talk about you in excess? Let's leave it here: You are the Supreme Shoe Goddess, my sister-in-crime, and if I could get you to move up here, I would! I hope you feel better now... :-)  So in typical peacegrrl fashion, I have been scoping out the Ohio guy selection, and it's not half bad. Lots of nice little undergrads running around shirtless. I'll have plenty to entertain me here when I've once and for all let go of The Guy. Wouldn't you know it, I've got nookie on the brain again, what else is new? Am I reaching my sexual peak or something? I suppose there's nothing to be done. I'll go pretty far for a bootie call, especially with a guy I actually  like  who really knows what he's doing, but Austin is probably outside the logistical parameters. Suckage. I guess I'll just need to avoid Dave Matthews and that Pavement cd The Guy gave me, limit my alcohol intake around certain people, and hope it passes. Grrr.  So it's after ten here, I haven't slept worth a damn in several days, and of course I've got eight hours of training to look forward to tommorow. Guess it's time to go. Anybody got any advice for me in my randy single-grrl state? Feel free to share. Oh, and check  urlLink this  out if you're feeling poor;  it lends some nice perspective.  Later, taters... -peacegrrl
