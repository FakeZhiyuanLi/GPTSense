      I got stung by a hornet today. I cried. If I can't handle that kind of pain, how on Earth would&nbsp;I be able to do it?

      I ache for freedom yet I refuse to do it, I am not brave. I have the means to do it, but do I have the guts? No, I don't. That may be a good thing, it may not, but what can I do? mc, I blame you.

      It was a cold kind of day. The kind of cold kind of day that makes you chilly if you happen to be out side without warm clothes on. That is how cold it was. And, it just so happens that a character in this story happened to be out side on this cold day without any warm clothes on. In fact, he was not wearing any clothes at all. For that reason, and other reasons too, it was imperative that he find shelter immediately. Or soon there after. He had never experienced a day like this before. Ever before. Never in his lifetime before. He hopes to never experience anything like this again. but is what he hopes for really what is best for him? Only time will tell. This is the story of a man. Of a boy. Of a legend that no has heard of. Of a hero that no one knows. It will make you laugh. It will make you cry. You will read it from start to finish. You will not be able to put it down. You just wait. You will think you are just reading a book. You should know better. You will soon realize, the book is reading you.  He was running through the snow like a blind man. All he could see was white. Endless white. Everywhere he turned. Everywhere he fell. No matter where he looked. All there was, was white. The poor boy. He went flying as he tripped over a particularly bumpy patch of white. Over the cliff he went. Into the void. He fell for what seemed like only seconds, but really days passed as he fell. What could he do though, besides fall? Well really quite a lot, but how was he to know? If he had read the instructional manual before he took the plunge he would have known that in order to stop falling, all he had to do was simply to stop.
