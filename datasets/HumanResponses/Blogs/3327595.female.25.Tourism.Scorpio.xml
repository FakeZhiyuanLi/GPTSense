      	I work in Guest Relations at Walt Disney World and an important part of my job is to deal with guest concerns (the nice word that Disney uses to describe complaints). The most difficult part o this job is figuring out who is telling the truth and who is simply trying to get comp tickets, or as we call it ‘scamming.’ When I first began working in Guest Relations I had this wonderful view of helping people who have had poor experiences and turning their vacation around by wowing them with all I could do. I kept this sense until about my third day of work when I ran into my first scammer who outright lied to me about her ticket situation just so that she could get into the park for free. Another situation that we deal with in the Guest Relations department is services for guests with disabilities. Although we have won many awards as a company for the services that we offer (everything from sign language interpretation seven days a week to Braille guide maps), we have taken a decidedly different approach to this subject than other theme parks around the world. At most theme parks you merely need to rent a wheelchair for a sprained ankle and you can skip every line in the park. At Disney however, we have decided to take the American’s with Disabilities Act at its’ most basic point and treat everyone equally. This means that we have made almost all of our line accessible to wheelchairs, so most of our guests with mobility impairments wait through our regular lines. While many guests with permanent disabilities appreciate this equal treatment we receive concerns from many guests who believe their sprained ankle or child with ADD should not have to wait in line. We do understand that for some guests waiting in line would not be something that they are able to do, for instance children with autism, and have created special passes that allow people with these needs to bypass the lines. The amount of lying, begging, and yelling that goes on to get this pass is nearing epic proportions. Apparently there are web sites out there that actually advise future guests to come to guest relations and tell us that their child has autism so that their family will not have to wait in line. 	In the four years that I have worked in guest relations the number of guests that I have caught in outright lies so that they could get tickets or services that they don’t deserve has made me begin to question all guests more severely. I feel very bad for many of the people that I deal with who are really honest individuals but are put through the ringer before they receive whatever recovery items that they deserve by myself and other guest relations cast members. I cannot understand what makes people lie at a place like Walt Disney World. I have seen parents instruct their children to lie to us about their age, stand on their tip-toes so that they can get around a safety height requirement, and in the worst case have a child lie to me about having cancer. It is absolutely sad that we live in a society where this has become so acceptable. Moreover, for myself I find that the growing bitterness and skepticism over truth-telling by guests is inhibiting me from doing my job, so much so that I no longer enjoy the work that I used to love, and am currently looking to leave the company as soon as possible. I wish that people would just tell the truth; I know that it is costly to visit the Disney theme parks, but it does not justify lying.

      Two weeks ago the assigned reading in the Perry booked discussed the withholding of information about a medical error to a patient. I myself have been the unfortunate recipient of a medical error. When I was in college I had my appendix removed at the University of Kentucky Medical Center. I was actually really lucky to have it removed in that particular hospital because it was the only hospital in town using the new laproscopic procedure and I have no scar, whereas if it had been removed only a few weeks earlier at any other hospital I would have had the traditional procedure and would have ended up with a rather large scar. After surgery I was given morphine for pain and immediately I began showing signs of an allergic reaction. I began to get very itchy and my face started to swell up and turn sort of a purplish red color. The nurse on duty made a note of it in my chart and contacted the doctor on call. Later that evening, after the shift changed, the new nurse followed the original doctor’s orders and gave me a second dose of morphine which sent me into anaphylactic shock and landed me in the ICU for about 16 hours. Obviously this was a horrible experience but the way that the doctors and nurses handled it, as well as their openness and honesty in the situation made me feel a lot better. Unlike the hospital in the example the University of Kentucky Medical Center has a strict disclosure policy outlining how medical errors must be handled.  	The truth about my medical error is that because of the way that it was handled I never even thought about taking any type of action against the hospital. (Statistics gurus would probably say that my decision also has a lot to do with my education level, gender, age, and financial standing, but still for me the fact that no tried to hide anything was important.) The nurse who made the error came and visited me after I was out of ICU and apologized, which wasn’t necessary, but her sincerity made me feel even better. I honestly think that in an average hospital the type of thing that went on with the hospital in the reading would be more common than what I experienced at UK Hospital. I don’t know what administrator or ethics committee chair decided the policy of disclosing all errors to the patients affected, but I am glad that they made the decision. If I am ever in a position in a hospital where I am in charge of this type of decision-making I think that the books arguments and my experience will certainly convince me to have a more open policy about medical errors.  	Another thing about the reading that surprised me was how seemingly clear the policy was about disclosing medical errors to patients. If the policy is this clear than why is it that so many hospitals still try to cover-up errors. I can understand the fear of litigation (I work for The Disney Company, the most litigated against organization in the world), but it seems that if medical errors were revealed and explained to the patients that possibly lawsuits would be avoided, not increased. Also, open discussion of medical errors has long been considered the best way to prevent them in the future, and if future consequences are an important factor in determining the ethics of the situation, than this should be taken into consideration. Just my opinion but I think that openness is always better than lies.

      Reflections on the ethics of prescription drug costs for seniors.  	Yesterday the issues that face seniors when they are required to take multiple prescription drugs really hit home for me. Although I have heard many discussions on this topic during the classes that I have taken as a part of this program I don’t know if I fully understood how significant this issue is for people until the situation I experienced yesterday. 	My husband was a groomsman in a wedding for a college friend and as the bystander wife, I knew that I would be very bored during the pre-ceremony photography session, so one of his friend’s wives asked me to go with her to get ready for the wedding. The friend took me to her grandmother’s house where her dress was so that we could dress and help her grandmother to the ceremony. When I entered the house I noticed that this woman ‘Grandma’ lived in one of the poorest neighborhoods in Orlando in a small duplex with bars on the windows. Her home reminded me of the cliché senior citizen’s home with potted plants and knick-knacks everywhere. After making polite conversation about the weather and the wedding, she began talking to her granddaughter about her medications. Apparently a few months ago she had been hospitalized for a short period of time for high blood pressure, and for the first time in her life the 86 year-old was placed on maintenance medications. She had just been delivered a package of medicine through the mail from CanadaMeds.com and was talking about how much money she had saved. For instance, one medication, which she takes weekly, in an American pharmacy costs her $130 for four pills (one month supply), but from Canada the entire order of three medications for three months was $260, only twice what two months of the four pills would have cost her here. I asked ‘Grandma’ if she had a Medicare supplement and she told me that she had Humana, but that these three medications were not covered by the supplement. This especially surprised me since one of the medications was for Synthroid, one of the most commonly prescribed medications in the U.S.  	As a sat there in this woman’s house, for which money is obviously a constant battle, I wondered how American drug companies, who make billions of dollars a year (and whose executives will never face the issues like what ‘Grandma’ faces) could ethically allow this to happen. And if we don’t want to blame this on the drug companies, since we are a capitalist society and supposed to strive for big profits in every industry, then how can we as a society put this kind of burden on people like ‘Grandma.’ I will admit that when I entered into this master’s program I was highly skeptical and even slightly against the concept of nationalized medicine. But with every course I take and through experiences like this one, I have come to the realization that this may be the only way that we can solve the problems that we have with our healthcare system. When ‘Grandma’ discovered that I was doing my master’s in healthcare administration she questioned me thoroughly about the new Medicare drug bill, and as much as I wanted to give her good news, I found it very difficult to explain to this very hopeful and nice woman that the drug bill would most likely not help her pay for her medications. I hope that through what I learn in this program, and through what other people in this program and ones like it will do in the future, that we will someday be able to look ‘Grandma’ in the face and tell her that she won’t have to worry about how she will pay for medicine or other healthcare needs in the future.

      	Recently my father-in-law came home from work to find his Doberman, Tasha, unable to walk or even move her back legs. He and my mother-in-law rushed the dog to the veterinary hospital who initially recommended that they put the dog down. After a second opinion it was discovered that Tahsa had a slipped disc in her neck, probably the result of a fall on the hardwood floors in their house, and required surgery. The resulting operation cost almost four thousand dollars. It seems strange to me that people are willing to pay this kind of money to have their dog walk again but find it ridiculous when they are asked to pay a ninety dollar co-pay for an emergency room visit. It seems to me that if people are now willing to buy HMOs for their dogs and cats that we should not have any uninsured people in this country. And why are people so willing to shell out so much money for a veterinary visit but scoff at the fact that the co-pay for their regular office visits went from five dollars to fifteen dollars. Maybe if people better understood what healthcare actually costs, like the way that they understand and accept a veterinary bill, then we would actually be able to get something accomplished in healthcare reform in this country. Also doesn’t it seem odd that the same four thousand dollars that was used to treat this dog could also probably cover the insurance premiums for at least two or three of those uninsured people each year, and yet employers cry all the time that it would just be too costly.  My husband would probably tell you that I feel this way because I just don’t like dogs, which isn’t entirely true, but maybe somewhat, but I think that it is just more that the further that I get into the crazy, messed up world of healthcare the more odd things like this seem to me. It is true that some people are just blessed enough to be able to afford things like this for their animals, and my in-laws work hard so why shouldn’t they be allowed to splurge a little on their dog, after all she is an important member of the family, and very well loved. But some people aren’t even blessed enough to afford healthcare for their children much less their dogs, so it makes it difficult to understand.  Maybe someday when my husband forces me to get a dog, and I love it as much as his family loves Tasha I will understand, but somehow I think that as long as I am in healthcare, this will always confuse me. I guess it is all about personal prioritizing, so you can’t really globalize it. Anyway, as of today the dog is out of the hospital and trying to stand up, so I guess it worked out, at least for Tasha.

      	Both my husband and my mother are fifth grade teachers. And, if there is one thing that I have learned, besides the fact that I never want to teach, it’s that teachers love to talk about education. So, I often find myself involved in conversations about education around my house and whenever we go out with my husband’s teacher friends. Sometimes I find that I have a different opinion than my husband on many issues with the education system, and he often discredits these opinions saying that I don’t know because I am not a teacher. While I’m sure that it is true that I don’t have the same perspective as he does because I am not a teacher, I think that my opinions should still be valid. For instance one issue that he often talks about is how some children will never have as much success in school because of the families that they were raised in. And, teaching at a school that draws about 20% of its population from the Paramore area of Orlando, I’m sure that he feels this quite often. However, is it not the very role of public education to educate everyone, regardless of background? And yet, I know from spending the time with his class that I do and from hearing the stories that he tells that this is not always true. There are children in his class that have been sent to live with grandparents, aunts, uncles, or friends because they have actually been told by their parents that they do not want them and do not love them, and I know that it must be nearly impossible to convince a child like that the importance of understanding long division. But that is still a teacher’s responsibility, and thanks to FCAT and school grades they are held accountable for that. I don’t think that there is any easy solution to this, but I think that what they do at my husband’s school is the way to at least start, they teach to those students. In other words, they don’t just give up on those kids; they actually adjust the curriculum to better serve children who come from families like that.  	There are two elementary schools in the area of Orlando that my husband teaches in, College Park, and while his school has chosen to do things this way the other school has taken a much different approach. Because the other school was tired of its “best” (nice way of saying wealthiest) students going to private school, they decided to begin a math academy. Each grade level would have one class of neighborhood students, part of the math academy, and the other classes would have the students who were bused in. This idea was actually hatched in a meeting of Buddy Dyer (mayor of Orlando, whose children attend the elementary school in question), Ron Blocker (superintendent of Orange County Public Schools), and the principal of the elementary school. This idea is what I like to call the new discrimination. Basically there would be two schools within the school, one for the so-called neighborhood kids (mostly affluent and white), and then the bused in children (mostly African-American and Hispanic children). Personally, I think that this is a terrible idea because of the fact that in the end the needs of the children who are not in the math academy will probably suffer even more. Also, the fact that this decision was politically motivated should raise huge ethical flags to question the motives of all of the people involved. From listening to this issue and many others that my husband talks about one nice thing that I have realized is that it isn’t just health care that is so messed up.

      For me in particular changing jobs, no matter how needed, is a very difficult task due to the enormous loyalty for the organization that I am presently working for. Since high school I have in some way been employed for the Disney Company. I started as a summer cast member in attractions (Space Mountain) for the Walt Disney World Company, continued in college as a cast member and assistant manager for The Disney Store Incorporated, and then returned after graduation to work once again for the Walt Disney World Corporation as a guest relations hostess and tour guide. I have loved almost all of the aspects of my jobs at Disney, but I have always been aware of the fact that I was not meant to work in the tourism industry as a career. It is difficult to explain how I have reached this conclusion, especially since I don’t feel any particular career direction in my life at this time (I still don’t really know what I want to be when I grow up), but I suppose that it is simply an evaluation of my gifts and talents, as well as my desire to use those things to their fullest extent that leaves me unfulfilled in my current role. Even so, as I begin a new career in the next year I feel great regret and disappointment in the fact that I will not be returning to work at the place “where magic lives” in the future.  	I have accepted a new job as the school health assistant for a local elementary school for the upcoming school year and have a mere 6 days of work at the Magic Kingdom ahead of me before I will leave Disney. The position that I accepted was largely due to two things, first the distance that the job is from my house (15 miles round trip instead of the 70 that I am currently driving five days a week), and the ease of the job so that I will be able to finish this Master’s program in a timely manner. Another reason that I have accepted this job is because of the possibility of upward mobility. Orange County Public Schools, my new employer, regularly promotes individual school health assistants into administration roles within their sector as well as the potential for a whole county administrator position as well. Although this position seems to be something that I will enjoy, especially considering that I will get to work with children, and a great opportunity, I know that I am already feeling great sadness and even guilt about leaving Disney, and that these feelings will only increase as I get farther away from my current role.  	I don’t think that my actions are in anyway unethical, I gave two weeks notice, but I do wonder if perhaps I should not have ended my relationship with the Disney Company altogether instead of doing what I did. At Disney they offer every capable exiting employee the possibility of taking seasonal status. Typically this would mean that you would work during peak seasons, but in my case it will mean that I will continue to work as a VIP tour guide whenever I have a day off or if any of my return tours come back. At Disney if you are a VIP tour guide for a family or celebrity than each time that individual comes again, they will again have you, if you are available. I really love the VIP tours that I have been involved with and have been blessed to have many high profile celebrities including athletes, musicians, and actors, and I would really like to be able to spend more time with these people. But I am left wondering if it wouldn’t be best for me, especially given my great loyalty to institutions, to have just quit Disney outright rather than to have this hybrid relationship. Many friends that have left Disney have commented that you will never again work anywhere like Disney, where else can you come to work everyday with a single goal to ensure that people have the happiest time of their lives, and I know that I will feel the same way. And yet, I also feel strongly that it is time for me to move on and that I will find greater purpose and fulfillment elsewhere. My cheese has moved and I need to follow it. I can only hope that when I do find that purpose and fulfillment, and hopefully what I want to be when I grow up, that I will be content with the decision that I made and be happy myself.

      Currently my family is looking for a way to deal with my 86 year old grandfather in a tactful way to help him ease into an assisted living facility. He currently lives out of state and has begun to show signs of senility that have caused great worry among many of our family members, to the point that the family feels that he can no longer live alone. However, my grandfather in no way feels the same about the situation and believes that he is perfectly capable of living on his own. He points out that he still drives his own car, and still mows his own lawn with a regular very old and very heavy push mower. However in the eyes of my family and the rest of the world he drives the car at about ten miles per hour less than the speed limit, and is worn out for about a week after he mows the lawn. We even believe that he may have begun hallucinating in that he claims that a few months ago an intruder broke into his house and woke him up. However, nothing was taken from the house, all of the doors were locked, and his spare set of keys were in their usual hiding place. All of these things have led my family to believe that he is no longer capable of living on his own.  	How to get him out of the house that he has loved for many years is a difficult issue. I think that America is starting to do a much better job handling end-of-life issues with the advent of advance directives and living wills but the burden of handling an elderly member of the family who clearly is not capable of being independent but refuses to give up that freedom is still a very daunting task. I wish that people were more receptive to the idea of understanding that there will come a point in everyone’s life when they will again, like when they were a child, need someone to look after them. Perhaps the sad state of nursing homes in this country is part of the problem. I know that my grandfather remembers his father being put in a nursing home and suffering with bed sores and other problems. And I know that he remembers even more the recent time that my grandmother spent in one before she passed away, and so I completely understand his hesitation to have to go to one of those places himself. I wouldn’t want to live there either and I really hope that they are much different when I am his age. But the fact remains that he is no longer safe living on his own, and needs more assistance than our family is able to give him. I know that many places now have a long term care insurance option to help with financing these needs but maybe someone should come up with a way to help older people ease into those situations. Improving the living conditions and quality of nursing homes would be one place to start, I know that some are nicer, but overall much needs to be done to make them all nice. And maybe awareness could be raised about more active assistive living faculties that help to transition people into full nursing care facilities. I also would like for there to be mandatory drivers license testing for older people, not only for my grandfather’s situation but also to help with all of the people out there who are no longer able to be safe drivers on the roadways. Perhaps when I become a healthcare administrator I will be able to use my experience in this situation to help change some of these things so that my family and others will not have to continue to make these difficult choices.

      When we were first assigned to create reflective writings as apart of our ethics class assignments, I knew immediately what I wanted to reflect on, but I also knew that I was not ready to share my feelings about an event that happened in late April to some close friends. The events of this weekend however, have brought me back to this topic and have decided to at least attempt to work out some of what I am feeling by using this reflective writing technique.  My husband and I attend College Park Baptist Church just north of Downtown Orlando. I would describe our church as moderate Baptist, but most Baptists would describe us as liberal (we are NOT apart of the extremely conservative Southern Baptist Convention). I was married in December and had been attending a Sunday school class for young married couples as an engaged person for nearly a year. One of the anchor couples in our class, Tammy and Galen, had become a mentor couple for Brant and I, and we spent a lot of time going out to lunch and socializing with Tammy and Galen and their one year old son Ethan. When we returned home from our honeymoon in early January we were distressed to hear that Ethan had stopped eating and was seemingly in great pain and had been visiting his pediatrician several times a week to try and discover what was wrong. We continued to pray for Ethan, and even babysat for him several times during this period so that his parents could have a little bit of a break. In late February, after over fifteen visits to the pediatrician who continued to insist that Ethan was just colicky, Tammy and Galen demanded a referral to a gastroenterologist. It took about another week, and an initial incorrect diagnosis of pediatric pancreatic cancer, to discover that Ethan had a stem cell tumor engulfing nearly every organ in his abdomen. Although the tumor was inoperable, the doctors were extremely optimistic that they could shrink the tumor in four rounds of chemo and then remove the tumor, thus curing Ethan and having a nearly zero percent chance of remission. Survival rates from stem cell cancers are nearly 90% and everyone was happy to know that Ethan would be fine.  During Ethan’s first three rounds of chemo everything went incredibly well. He maintained an appetite, even gaining a few pounds, was more active than ever, and celebrated his second birthday. Brant and I visited Tammy, Galen, and Ethan several  times in the hospital and at home during this month and a half long process, and were  always encouraged to see Ethan healthier and happier than before. On Tuesday April 27,  2004 Ethan went into the hospital for his fourth and final round of chemo. Tammy had  told me that in her last doctor’s visit with the pediatric oncologist he had told her that he sees terminal cases all day long, but that in no way was Ethan terminal. Ethan was scheduled to leave the hospital on Monday May 3rd and it was even thought that he may not have to have surgery to remove the tumor because it had shrunken so much that it was no longer visible on CT scans. On Thursday morning April 29th I got a page with my husband’s cell phone number while I was at work. I called him immediately, since he normally doesn’t call at work and he told me that Ethan had passed away. I was in absolute shock. I immediately called my best friend, Jennifer, who is the children’s minister at my church, and asked for the details. She told me that he had died sometime between three and four in the morning and that no one knew what had happened. I left work and drove to church to see what I could do to help and spent the rest of the day calling people who knew Ethan to let them know what had happened. Needless to say, that will probably always be one of the most difficult days of my life. Everyone in our church family was shocked and rallied around Tammy and Galen to help them as best we could. The Saturday night after Ethan’s death there was a viewing in the Fellowship Hall at our church. Jennifer’s husband and my husband Brant waited in the over an hour line to talk to Tammy and Galen while we watched Jennifer’s children and then we joined them at the front of the line when our turn came. It was difficult to know what to say. I was also surprised to see that the viewing was open casket, I have always hated that aspect of funerals, but after this one I know that I will never do that if I had the choice. The sight of that little boy laying there is an image that I saw every time I closed my eyes for weeks and is still with me when I think about him today. 	I think about Ethan everyday. Sometimes I see children that look a little like him  in my job at Disney and I have a hard time not crying. His funeral, while beautiful and   very well led by our pastor, was something that I defiantly never want to experience again, however just this weekend our church lost another child. Jordan was 21 years old and although I am only a few years older than him, I know that he was very much still just a kid. The circumstances that Jordan died under where very different than with Ethan (the car that he was riding in was being driven by a drunk driver who was drag racing, ran a red light and caused a six car accident in which Jordan was ejected from the car and killed instantly). But the pain is very similar. Jordan had two younger sisters and a younger brother, who my husband and I have worked with extensively in our church’s youth and children’s ministry. (His little sister, Shannon, was the flower girl in my wedding less than six months ago.) My husband was at his mother’s house with the family until 2am on the night that the accident occurred, and we have both spent time with Jordan’s siblings and mother in the now just over 48 hours since Jordan died. I am a person of great faith and I believe strongly that both Ethan and Jordan are now in a better place. I know that somehow that knowledge is supposed to bring comfort to those who knew these two boys, but for me it still brings very little. The foundations of my faith, while not altogether laid aside, have defiantly been tested, and I find myself with far more questions than I can answer. Sometimes I feel that I don’t have a right to be as concerned and touched by their deaths as I am, especially when I look at their parents and can only imagine the horrible pain they are feeling, but I know my grief is also real and something that I too must deal with. The anger that I feel towards God, the doctors and nurses who let us down with Ethan (the theory is that he died from an accidental overdose of morphine while in the hospital), and the kid that Jordan was in the car with is enormous. I know that I must let go of this anger and forgive these people to move on, but I am finding that a lot more difficult than I ever imagined. Jordan’s funeral will be this week and when it takes place it will be the second funeral for someone younger than me that I have experienced in just a little more than a month’s time. I’ve heard it said that as you grow older you become wiser because you have experienced more, if this is what they are talking about than I am wise enough and do not wish to become any wiser.
