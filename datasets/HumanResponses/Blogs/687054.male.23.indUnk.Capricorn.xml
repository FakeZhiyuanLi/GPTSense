      Tired of living a lie. It was great while it lasted. Gotta accept the fact that some things can't be changed. Some things can't be fixed. Some choices cant have options. Some mistakes can't be made up for. You may or may not have slipped, but in my mind you did a thousand times. Coming home drunk at 7 am didnt help at all. This ends here and now, I won't come crawling back no more.. I crawled back too many times before. This is where it ends, this is where it should have ended a long time ago. Goodbye blogger.

      What doesn't kill me will make me stronger. We'll be unstoppable if we make it through this one babe. I don't have faith yet but each new day with  you will make me believe. Let me lift you up and help you reach your stars. Let me share every waking moment and every dying hour with you. Let us uproot our past differences and plant a new seed of love, nurture it with kisses and hugs day by day, and reap the sweet fruits of our labor after each passing sunset. Yo te amo mi amor. Let me be your world, coz u are already mine.

      It took me 16 cigarettes to realize that I can't force you to love me, that I can't help loving you, that I can't be happy without you. 16 cigarettes to realize i bitch too much, I complain too much, but I'm willing to give everything up for you. 16 cigarettes to tell me that no matter where I run, memories of you will always be a step behind. 16 cigarettes to finally give up and hope that you somehow find a place for me in your life. I hope those are the last 16 cigarettes I have. Coz i wanna make sure I never leave your side before you leave mine. Face it, I'm hopelessly, deeply, undeniably in love with you. And it doesnt matter if I'm not in your heart or your mind. It doesnt matter if you don't see yourself by my side in the happy ever after. What matters is 16 cigarettes told me im only happy when i'm loving you. Let me see you happy until the end of my days. Let me give you whatever love I have left. Just be true to me, coz the last thing I need is another 16 cigarettes. Be honest with me, that's all I have left to ask. DOn't ask me to stay if all I have to stay for is a lie. I want to share your memories with you, I wanna be part of your life. I wanna be there for every new experience, be part of all your pictures. Please tell me to go if all I have to stay for is another walk with 16 more cigarettes.

      If i had money would u have stayed  If I had friends would u have stayed   If I took you out would u have stayed    If I made you miss me would u have stayed     I love drivin, makes me think. Im askin myself questions. Women are such strange creatures. I found out women dont wanna be independent. Im sure I heard it before, i just failed to realize it. They wanna be taken cared of. If you sacrifice everything for a woman ,u wont have anything left to offer her. You know why the century plant is so beautiful, the aroma so mesmerizing. It blooms every 100 years. Do you know why random msgs are so uplifting? u dont get them everyday. We celebrate birthdays once a year. Holidays once a year. Anything loses the property of being special if its readily available. Why is sex with strangers so exciting? u dont sleep or see that same person every day.   Facing facts. Eventually, the world will stop changing. It's inevitable that sometimes u can't find new ways of doing certain things. Eventually, u will tire of variety, of ever recycling visions. You will see people come and go, never stay. You will long for only one season, one hand to hold. You will realize that as ur memory blurs, what ull be longing for is a sense of permanence to anchor urself to. When everyone leaves, as they eventually will, u will be glad someone decided to stay with u thru thick and thin. Why do I love u so much. Why do i make myself miserable. Why can't I jus let you go. Why do I have to run so far away to make myself believe that i can live without you. Coz honestly, I dont anymore. I dont.

      What did I do to deserve this? People have been punished for way worse things. Was I that bad that every day in my life feels like hell. Was I that bad that I'm no longer even there? I wish i could lock away my feelings and live life as a shell. I dunno where to find happiness no more.

      I'm hurting coz i love you more than i hate you. I try to hate you most but everytime i see you I fall in love all over again. I can't control you, or dissuade you from anything. All i can do is point and hope u follow. I'm sorry you're all I have in mind. Losing you made me lose myself.

         Your " I love you" Is half meant, I hear the tremble on your voice. You're " I don't wanna do this " is just something you want to say to save yourself. I hope someone makes you happy where I failed. Have fun. No need to hide, no need for lies. Sure it'll kill me more, but I'll try to live through it. I'll leave a tear in my pillow every night for you. A tear from the heart you broke and step on every day after.

         I love you. I always will. It's sad you can't love me too. I will always have fond memories of you; of the memories we shared, the dreams we cherished, the little times we were together and happy. Struggling to find the words for what I feel, being at loss for the right ones. Missing you, having missed you, longing for your sincere touch. Wondering if I can ever find someone to fill the break in my heart you leave. It was a mistake taking  you in... A mistake I have paid for, a mistake I have to live through. And the ironic part is its a mistake I can't regret making. Thank you for letting me love  you.

      I know you've been playing me, don't think im blind. I can read your mind, your soul. I can tell when you're hiding something. I've always known, I just turned a blind eye. No more. It ends here and now. I want you out of my heart, my life once and for all. You are selfish, inconsiderate. You say you can lie but I can feel sincerety. I'm doing this for me now, for me. I feel sorry for the next person to fall to your trap, Your "infatuation phase". You can't just use people like that. I've been there. Done that. But i don't play with people's emotions like you do. You are purposely hurtful.   I can remember how it was when it started out. I know how you tick, I see your routine. Remember beauty will fade. Try to be as beautiful inside as you are out. You will go far in this material world, of material people. You will use many more for your purposes. You will break many more hearts. New lesson, never be to good to anyone. In the end you will be taken for granted. I am not something you amuse yourself with. I am not a toy. I am not a slave. I am a man. A man who once loved you so much he built his world around you.

      Tunnel vision. All you see is the goal you set for yourself. You are selfish, disrespectful, arrogant, naive, insensitive. Why can't I do to you what you do to me? oh yeah... I forgot... It's a matter of principle. Damn me and what I believe in. Damn me for being a nice guy. Why couldnt I have found someone who deserves all I have to give.

      You look your best when you're asleep. You ask why I love you? I love you coz you're delicate when your eyes are closed. Innocent when your lips smile. You look child-like when you breath easy. I love you coz I know you dream of big things. I know you'll wake to reality, make the best of the day, and make someone else's day more livable. I love you coz I know you are interesting, full of wonder. I love you coz you have principle and character. You take risks and you do what you set your heart to. I love you coz I want to love you.   I just don't understand what i did to be shut out of your world. I love you but sooner or later, I won't be anyone but that someone who loves you. I wont be the person you laugh with. The person you get in trouble with. I won't be the person you see when you think back and remember. I love you, but I dunno if you really love me too.

      Oh to love unconditionally. To give and expect nothing in return. For god so loved the world he gave his only son to die on the cross for the sins of the very beings he created called men. I had no idea how difficult loving someone could be. I'm not just saying liking someone's company. Enjoying meaningful conversations on trivial issues. Sharing dinner and a movie. Not the typical stereotype "we have an understanding" love. But to be truly madly deeply in love with someone to the point that your whole world revolves around them.   It's sad how the very person you gave your world to could tear your world apart. It's the usual yin yang. The capacity to be the total opposite of anything. That one person who can make you smile can leave you in tears. Whoever can brighten your day can rain on your parade. You finally find someone to give your life meaning only to end up right where you started... Alone, confused, broken, unloved.
