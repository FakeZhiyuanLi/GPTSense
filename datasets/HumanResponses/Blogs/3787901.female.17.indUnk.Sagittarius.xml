      I'm angry, I really am!!! My supposed to be best friend is such an stupid bitch sometimes!!! I feel like I could kill her right now. O I know, things aren't going fine between us right now. If your asking me, things aren't going well between us for months right now. Maybe we've seen eachother too much or something...I don't know...  Look, I'm not going explain the howabouts and all, that would take way to long... But today, o crap, it's chaos in my head or something.... *tries to focus herself on what she's trying to tell* We both have a TM (That's me) That is a page where you can make a profile and others can place an message on that profile. And I changed my background today and after she discovered that she did the same... That's when the today's issue started. I hate it when she does things like that!! I hate it!!!  She's such an mimic and I totally hate it but can't say anything about it to her. That's the whole f*cking problem. I can't say what's on my heart!!! Strange friendship we've got ain't it?  Sometimes it really pisses me off... (And I'm still mad at her and blocked her on msn... I don't want to talk to her anymore...for now.)  Maybe it'll help when I make an agressive painting or play loud music....

      I'm boring me!!!  Very very badly. And my vacation just started!!! What the hell am I supposed to do in those nearly two months? I could write on my stories.... Yeah, well, the only problem is that my inspiration is totally gona at the moment... My muse left me I'm afraid.  You know, I'm wondering where I can find the blogs from others here...

      Uhm....do you write that this way actually? Or is it wheater?  Anyhow, lets talk about the weather... (Rain and all that shit ^-^)  This summer is SHIT. But, that's old news when you live in the Netherlands.... The weather is always crappy here. It's too cold when it should not. It's not cold when it should (in winter for example) It's always too rainy or else too dry Or it's too warm...  Like today.  O, I know...it's summer after all. But two days ago it was like autumn. It's so strange...  *And now I'll stop with that shit*  *Ahum*  I still don't know what to do... And right now i'm hoping I can get (uhm...how do you say that?) as much as sun as possible on my legs so they'll become browner so you'll not be able to see my scars anymore.(or something like that) But I don't think that'll work out because I get burned easy by the sun... And not get browned...  So, if it's still way to visible on next, uuh, let's say thursday, I'll tell them. *I think*  But I don't know or I have the guts to tell them...and how can you tell someone something like that in the best way?

      What should I do?  What should I do? Telling my parents about S.I and stuff before we go on holiday? Or wait and pray they will not see on holiday?  I dunno... What's the most wise thing to do?     I mean, if I do not tell them and they find out...I'll be in a lot of trouble I think But if I do tell them...Then what? I don't know how they'll react. The only thing I can think of is that they'll send me to a psychatrist....  I hate this... I've cried myself to sleep for a whole week now. And i'm tired...so tired...

Your method of suicide is Mutilation.  Take the quiz:  urlLink "What KInd Of Cutter Are You?"    True Cutter  You are a true cutter, you know what you like  Take the quiz:  urlLink "What self-mutilation emotion sequence are you?"    Worthlessness, Exhilaration, Shame  That's what you feel....  Take the quiz:  urlLink "Are you really suicidal??"     your not sure  you can't decide if your life is bad enough that you really want to end it. your family and friends mean a lot to you and you dont want to cause them pain. just hang in there, the bad times will pass, and the good times are in your future. get rid of any pills or sharp objects in your room in case you happen to make up you mind...

      Yesterday I had a row with my parents My father said he saw my sketchbook and looked in it, and called my mother to see it too!!! And now they're worried about me even more. Because they saw the pictures I made. And my mother said she thgought I was thinking a lot about death and maybe even about suicide and I was like "Huh? How does she know after seeing a couple of paintings?" And I feel betrayed because my father wasn't alowed to look in my sketychbook!!! If I wanted them to see what I draw, I'll show them, but I don't want them to see it!!!! My pictures belong to me and to no-one else!!! I know all the reasons behind and I'll not explain them to anyone else!!!  He didn't had the right to do that!!! And my mother said it was maybe the best for me to go to a shrink or something because I wasn't there yet. Ofcourse I'm not!!!! And maybe I was to "old" for Youthcare.  Why the fuck does she think that? I mean, Inge is 19 already and still there. 2 Years older then me!! (Not that she's done or something)  And after they left me crying I took something sharp and now I have another wound/scar thing on my wrist.... Not good. Absolutely not good.  And at night I cried nearly an hour befor I fell to sleep and it's going like that for already a whole week!!!  My mother said I should talk more about what's playing in my head. But I simply CAN'T do that!!! That's what I told her too, but she said "If you can't say it, maybe you should write a letter"   No way!!!  On the other side, it's likely they'll find out soon anyway, even when I don't tell them. And if they find out accidentely, it'll be worse?? I don't know.  And now I'm wondering what I should do, and how I could have let this happen. And why I've been so stupid....

Bordeline or no bordeline?  It looks like it.... But maybe slightly then? I dunno....  And this is not the only thing/test whatever where this conclusion comes out....  Now what?

      Talked with her briefly today.... She seid she did read the letter...and Cynth too.  Then why the fok didn't they say a thing about it god dammit!!!!! She said: "Cynth said it was sweet" Oh yeah? Then why didn't cynth say a damn about it when I talked with her on msn? Hm?  In fact, after a while she didn't say anything at all anymore. (Cynth I mean)  I really don't get all this shit.  It's confusing me.  And I wrote in my letter to her that we should talk soon maybe. And she din't mentioned anyting!!! Like she thinks it doesn't matter!!!  What the hell is going on??!!!

      That's what's written on my left upper leg right now.... &nbsp; Have been stupid again. Scratched that word in my leg at night because I was so angry at evertything and everyone.... Still am to be fair. &nbsp; Hope it will fade away on time... &nbsp; Liars... There's some truth in it you know? Everyone is a liar We all are liars.  They always say children are innocent, but from the age of 4 they are liars too. "No, I didn't ate that cookie mom"  &nbsp; LIARS!!!!! &nbsp; Worked today...Was prettie boring. Didn't hade a thing to do. Hehe, Sandor bounded some Creme Brulee thing on Stefans car the day before.... And Stefan didn't notice.... The whole back of his trunk is now splatterd with that stuff... &nbsp; Sometimes those guys are so funny, just as with the eggs throught the whole kitchen... I laughed my ass off then... &nbsp; O, and Johan has to go to hospital tomorrow...There's something wrong with the bloodvessels in his legs or something. I dunno. &nbsp; Prr, she's on-line now too on msn...but still didn't talk to me.... And I'll not start talking to her!!! Stupid morron. You know...It feels like she betrayed me. O I know, I don't tell her everything as well. But This is something else. This ain't a secret about SI, this is something most friends talk about with eachother and some of them go along with eachother to the tatoo/piercing shop. But she didn't even tell me she would get a piercing!!!! &nbsp; Like she doesn't trust me or something. It hurts inside. It really does. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Current music: Evenescence, Lies  &nbsp;  Prr, she left a message on my tm yesterday that she would call tomorrow (today) to that tatoo shop in Den-Helder.  That's ok, but she DID NOT tell me she would get her tatoo the same day along with a lip piercing!!!!  &nbsp;  Why didn't she tell me that?  &nbsp;  Why the fuck didn't she told me???  &nbsp;  O, and besides, she stole a quizz I placed on my own TM and put it on hers....  &nbsp;  Sometimes I just fucking hate her!!!!!  &nbsp;  DAMN!!!!

      I don't want to go to work today....  I'm afraid you know. Afraid that the word will come out. O, I knew already it will happen one day, but I simply don't want anyone to know my secret. Not even my best friends...I mean, sometimes I wish I coul tell her. But she has some problems of her own and I can not make it to throw mine on her shoulders too. It's all so difficult. Especially when you have to pretend nothing's wrong for the outside... My whole life is a facade...  God damn!!! We're gonna go on holyday way to fast!!! I'm desperate!!! What if the wheaters just as the year before? I would have a big bad problem then...  I HATE IT!!!!!  How could I have sunken that low? How could I've been so stupid!!!?? Now what? Now what?  The worst thing is, I stil feel the urge to do it...And sometimes it takes over me, although I know I should not do it...Like Friday, I made all my scars bleed again. All of them...And the past two weeks I'm walking araound like a zombie. This is no good...  I feel lost, and alone, and cold, and dead...  And I made a couple of quizzes on the net. The answers I got...well, let's say it worries me... Come to think of it, I bet that she didn't read the letter, she didn't even talk about it!!! And I so said this wasn't meant for over ten years!!!! Why doesn't she ever listen to me!!!  Really, I'm sick of everything...

Hehe, I just have had to say that :P  Anyway, I think I'm gonna buy it today befor I'll go to work. And I still have to find shoes somewhere...and shirts too. Grrr. Why's it always so difficult for me to find something I like? It's unfair!!!  O, and for the graduationparty, I wrote 3 letters to my friends. One to her as wel. And I wrote to her that we have to talk soon maybe. Don't know or she already read it? O well, maybe when we go to the market tuesday. Come to think about it...She's stealing my pictures from TM!!! She didn't even ask it... :S *Sigh*  Our Tm's look very alike now...And I don't like that... But who am I?

      My younger brother is so annoying... I don't have words for it.  So anyway, about yesterday, I was to Parlan for the last time. Only Stefan came too. We were the only ones and if your asking me I completely wasted my time there... Therapy, yeah right... Glad I don't have to come back again. Went to the city after it, I need new shoes but can't find anything I like. Went to the ZV too. Ordered Legal Drug vol. 1, Fushighi Yughi vol. 4 and that's it I believe. I listened to a couple of records too. 'Touch in the dark' from Asrai and a record from Autumn. And I searched for the record of Leaves' Eyes but couldn't find it anywhere... Strange...  But so be it...I don't have enough money anyway right now...O, well, It's not that I don't have it...It's more that I may not spend it. Maybe when I gain some money for my graduation ^^ Who knows...  O, and I'm still angry at my friend... She really hurted me..

      I told them... And I was scared to death... And They were shocked ofcourse.  And now I have to go to RIAGG But I don't want too...  O well, I know it would be the best for me so I'll go anyway.  It's just, I'm so tired of all this stupid shit!! I'm going to "some-one who can help me" for about 2 years now, and I'm not even an inch further!!!  I'm sick of it!!  I can not talk about myself and all, and I don't want to do it either. it'll only make me cry...  Well, firts things firts. The holiday. Tonight we'll leave, so though it is just 9 o'clock, I'll have to go to bed right now.  I'll be back over 2 weeks.  Still don't know what to expect for that holiday... We'll see

      That's my name on TM right now  http://www.thats-me.nl/show.php?id=25152 If you want to take a look ;)  Its the name of a island announced in the book Mists of Avalon writen by Marion Bradley. I guess it's Celtic but it means "Island of Glass"  And I liked that name and meaning so much I've written a sort poem about it (You van find it on my TM as well)          Ynis Witrin ...My own island of glass...  ...With my fields of paper flowers...  ...Where all that'll never be and was...  ...Can be real forever not just hours...   ...My world full of lies...  ...I collect them all in a tree...  ...With everblue sky's...  ...They all belong to me...   This just appeared out of nothing when I tried to sleep last night. ^-^  I'm bored...I really am...  And I'm still trying to download that song of Seether with Amy Lee (She is so fucking beautiful!!!) But in all the songs appears a sort beep and I hate that!!!  O, come to think of it...She and I still haven't talked...Maybe we never will. Cause I'm waiting for a reaction from her about it. And I think she'll never mention it again... Stuborn bitch.      *Sigh* I wish I could look more like her...

      I can't do it!! I simply can't!! If I tell my parents about injuring myself I'll destroy them!! Ok, maybe not literary, but close enough...  I mean, they're already worried to death about me, and when I come with something like this...They'll break down... Or something like that... But, when I do not tell them, it's very likely the'll find out on holiday. So then I think it's better to tell them before they see it themselfs...  But I can't do this to them!!! It'll hurt them to much and that would be all my fault!!

      Since a couple of days I'm msn-ing with a guy. His name is Tom. What about it would you say.... Well, he's nice...very very nice. I still don't know him very well, but I can say he's someone I could fell in love with if I knew him better...  Unfortunately, he got a girlfriend....  Damn. Why do I always have bad luck?  Anyway, I got one of my horrible periods again I'm afraid. Scratched myself yesterday with the back of an earring... Not deep...but you'll see it...
