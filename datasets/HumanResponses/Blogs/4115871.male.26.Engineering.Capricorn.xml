      I am officially a member of World Financial Group.  I guess it's time to let the hard work begin.  I hope that my friends will support me through these times.  I'm going to the golf range in the afternoon, sounds like a lot of fun.  The BBQ last night at Greg's house was a blast.  Thanks Greg for the wonderful BBQ, the cakes were very good.  Back to a lot of Cardio starting Monday.

      It's another Monday. I get my physical tomorrow, I hope everything is fine. Atleast tomorrow will be a short day at work. My search for that perfect new job is not really happening for me. There isn't any new DVD's to download either. Oh well, it's almost time to go home :)

      As you have guessed, we ended up watching The Bourne Supremacy.  It was a very action packed movie with great visual effects.  The first movie was slightly better, although this one was also quite entertaining.  Back to work tomorrow, totally sucks.  I still have today to look forward to.  It's almost time for some dim sum.  What's after that you say ?  C.H.I.P or P.M.S ?

      Another pretty boring day at work.  I was actually somewhat busy today, lot of phone calls with telco companies and there was some mail problems as well.  Doom 3 sucks, I'm going back to playing Farcry.  Actually, I have so many DVD's to burn, I really don't have time to play games.  Hey Jay, I think I will take you up on your offer and borrow your DVD burner, thanks man :)  What movie should we watch tomorrow, The Bourne Supremacy, I Robot, or Catwoman...hehe !  You will find out when I write in here tomorrow !

      It seems to be another slow day at work. But thanks to Liz, the day just goes by a bit faster. Thank's for chatting with me. My computer crashed when I was playing Doom 3 last night, I was just about to pass level 1 too, crap. The stock market is having another one of those bad days where a lot of stocks are down. The QQQ is positive though, which is a good sign. Since I didn't have too much to do, I went to do some shopping at the Eaton Centre. I found some nice stuff at Mexx, pants and t-shirts :) So far, Jersey Girl have been an extremely boring movie, I hope it gets better in the second half of the movie. It's almost time to go home anyways, yah !!!

      It's another one of those days at work. The highlight of the day is probably the KFC I had early this morning. I was suppose to have a webconference for some job that I didn't even apply for. In the back of my mind, it probably seem like another pyramid scam where I'm selling stuff. When it came time to log in and see what kind of a scam it was, the login that they provided for me didn't even work. Well, I will be counting down my week...thank god it's a short one this week :)

      Another long weekend is almost over. Time sure flies when there is no work. It was a great BBQ on Sunday, thanks again Jerry. I just receieved those wacky pictures from the BBQ and they are just way too funny. I think I will post some of those pictures up on my site soon. On a game note, Doom 3 is finally out, but can only play it at resolution of 800x600 on my ATI Radeon 9800 Pro, which kind of sucks. I really got to finish playing Farcry first !
