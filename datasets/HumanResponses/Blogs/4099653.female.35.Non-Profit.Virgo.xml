						   I have been reading a lot lately. Mostly news online from many countries and from independent sources in the US. I am ashamed to live here anymore. I love the  urlLink Constitution  and believe it is one of the most brilliant documents of government written but I have come to realize that it has been gutted in the last 100 years or so. The  urlLink Patriot Act  is only the most recent atrocity.  Our government strips us of our freedoms and dignities and makes us wage slaves so that a few individuals can live obscene life styles. It uses the media to dazzle and dull us so we don't notice what is really going on. It has made our cell mostly comfortable with TV, fast food, disposable everything and plenty of " urlLink bread and circuses " so that a majority of the people ensnared don't want to take any risks for something as intangible as Freedom.  I am not free in a country where I can't protect myself from government thugs. I am not free in a country where  urlLink elections are rigged . I am not free in a country where the government tells me what I can and cannot do with my property. I am not free in a country where my privacy can be invaded on a rumor. I am not free in a country where the government can arrest me, lock me up and deny me access to my family or a lawyer. I am not free in a country where I have little say in how my tax dollars are spent. I am not free. We are not free.  It makes me so angry I can hardly see that the DEA felt free to come interrogate me and my house members because my business bought a solvent that was on their  urlLink watch list  from an independent vendor. It made my lightly unbalanced cousin-in-law go completely unstable and he can no longer work. I can not get this solvent anymore because I need special permission and would have to purchase huge quantities when I only need a few gallons a year. My business was shut down. I am not free.  It makes me almost foam at the mouth to hear the garbage that is spewed from the mouth of our "leaders" everyday to try to cover the fact that they are a lot of lying, stealing, murderous sons-of-bitches, and the American public buys it. I have never missed a chance to vote but I am beginning to believe that it doesn't matter because (like a horse race) it is  urlLink rigged  anyway. I am not free.  It makes me see red everytime someone is accused of being a terrorist (commie), unpatriotic, or incompetent when they speak out against government actions or policies. And the US public buys the media line and does nothing. I am not free.  It makes me want to vomit everytime I see the face of "our glorious leader", coup de tat King George. Can't you see Cheney's hand up his ass  urlLink making him speak . I am not free.  It makes we want to move someplace far away whenever I look at the current face of American and realize that most people are willing slaves that put the chains on themselves. But where on this planet is far enough away to escape the long arm of "Big Brother?" When can we start colonizing the moon or Mars? I am not free.  I am not angry about the  urlLink pictures  from Iraq. I expected it. I am only surprised that it took this long to get out.I have no anger left to spend on the predictable actions of our government to try to blame everyone but themselves. This is a government that does not understand freedom because it doesn't understand responsibility. To quote a favorite book of mine "Freedom is the right to take responsibility for yourself." I am not free.  My government tells me what I can drink, eat, medicate myself with, where I can live, and what work I can do. If you don't believe me, try to be a gunsmith without a federal permit, or a therapist without a license. Try to start a business with paying the appropriate government bribes (permits and licenses] and see how long before some government thug comes to steal your belongings and shut you down. They always say it is to protect us but what if I don't want protection? What if I want freedom? What if I want to be able to shoot the mother f$#*@% that just poisoned my water? What if I want to try some unapproved medicine because it may save my life? What if I want to damage my body with something because I like the effect? You don't even have the right to kill yourself in this country. The government reserves the right to tell you if you can live or die, unless nature takes that power away from them. If they could prevent nature from causing death they would surely do it. Think of all the tax payers and wage slaves they could have if you could never die.  Our government butts in where there is no real justification and mostly fails to act when there is a question of the common good. The common good dictates that our water and air not be poisoned. Have you read the " urlLink Clear Skies " manifesto? The common good dictates that our food supply not be contaminated. Do you know how they raise  urlLink livestock , and process food? Do you read ingredient labels and understand what is  urlLink actually  in the food you are eating? The common good has nothing to do with some poor sot smoking crack to ease the pain of living or to hurry death. The common good does not have to do with who sleeps with whom and what they do. The common good does not have to with decisions a woman makes when she finds out she is pregnant. The common good does not have anything to do with what people chose to do inside their homes. The common good has even less to do with what a person does with or to themselves. WE ARE NOT FREE!  What will it take to make most Americans wake up and see through the media spun illusion? I would have thought that  urlLink 9/11  would have done it. It was so blatant that I figured it out in the first hour. If not that, how about 2 unprovoked wars fought for corporate greed? All the information is out there. All people need to do is look at who benefited from all three events. Following so closely on the heels of a clearly crooked election, how can people not see? This is especially maddening as the bastards wrote up and published  urlLink their plan  before they even got elected. It is commonly available but no one seems to know. How can people not see all the signs of blatant manipulation and corruption. Our government is rotted and black to its core but people seem more concerned with making sure they get the best price on gas for their f$#@*%&^ SUV's. [another sore point of mine]  It makes me want to stand on street corners screaming " urlLink WAKE UP PEOPLE ! QUIT THE  urlLink MERCANTILE MASTURBATION  AND SMELL  urlLink THE COFFEE !" We are being driven to hell in a carriage with purple cushions and no one seems to notice. These crazy mother f$%#@* want the world to end but not before they have stolen as much as they can. They do not care about the common good. They do not care about anyone or anything but themselves.  Read the writing on the wall!   WE ARE NOT FREE!

						   Some may think that the title of my page is just to antagonize, this is not so.  It is to provoke, hopefully thought as well as anger.  The American Heritage Dictionary (1983 edition) defined fascism as :"A system of government that exercises a dictatorship of the extreme right, typically through the merging of state and business leadership, together with belligerent nationalism."  Can anyone really deny that The United States fails to display all the listed traits.  We could also add an additional trait that has been associated with fascism, the persecution of a minority group.  At what time in the history of the United States has there not been a persecuted minority?  As we sit here, there are several you could chose from but it seems to me that persons of middle eastern descent are the chosen bugaboo of the government.  The United States Government is owned by corporations and rich individuals, lock, stock and barrel.  As an average individual, just try to speak to your Senator or Representative during a visit to DC or their offices in your town.  Yet lobbyist and big dollar donors go to lunch, are invited to dinners and can get space made for them in even the most busy schedule.  With the current unlawful administration, energy company representatives wrote the proposed energy policy, pharmaceutical company representatives wrote the Medicare prescription bill, big time polluters put pressure on the EPA, voting machine company representatives are given positions of authority on election boards and it has been proposed that the FDA should protect companies from lawsuits instead of protecting the public from dangerous drugs.  Contrary to the dictates of the Bill of Rights, free speech can only be practiced in "Free Speech Zones" that look like prison camps.  If you disagree with the government, you are labeled "unpatriotic" or a "terrorist".  Major news networks toady to the military and parrot the party line.  When was the last time that an average person was able to petition the government to redress a grievance?  The government regularly passes laws that limit the second amendment and police state thugs regular violate the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th amendments.  The 10th amendment seems to have forgotten entirely by a power mad federal government.  How long to you think that the charred of an open and free democratic process will be maintained?  The current administration has been making inquiries into the process to cancel or postpone elections.  They say it is just to prepare if there is a "terrorist" attack.  How many people are willing to bet against there being a major attack of some sort on U.S. soil between now and November?  Can you honestly say that the current administration would never actually declare martial law?  Are you angry yet?  Probably not as angry as you should be.
