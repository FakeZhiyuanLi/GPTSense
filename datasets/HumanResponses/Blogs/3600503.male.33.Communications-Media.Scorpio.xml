      I went to law school at Vanderbilt University, in Nashville.  Vandy Law overlooks the fringe of Music Row, the Hollywood of country music.  Well, when you get to LA, you discover that "Hollywood" isn't "Hollywood" at all.  It's actually a bunch of hulking sound stages, unprepossessing offices and crappy trailers orbiting around Johnny Carson's "beautiful downtown Burbank."  Something similar is true of Music Row.  You'll never find the recording studios--they're so low-profile as to be nearly invisible.  Record labels have demolished the cute converted bungalows where they spent their first sixty years, in favor of pompous new office blocks just like those in any suburb anywhere.  The stars commute from gated estates in exclusive towns; Music Row's actual residences are a strange mix of a luxury condo tower, low-rent apartments, restored Victorian homes and houses that would be condemned in other cities.  United Methodist Church headquarters sprawls one block from a whorehouse; both are thriving.  I lived on Music Row.  Now, the fact that "Hollywood" and "Music Row" don't really exist doesn't stop millions of tourists from coming to either place.  And you've gotta have something for the tourists.  Oh, there's a good museum, and Elvis' recording studio has been preserved.  The Grand Ol' Opry still stands downtown, and there's actually a decent "Opryland" amusement park.  But there's a limit to just how much money these can extract from tourists.  Souvenir stands, on the other hand, will rake it in.  That's why, to the north of Music Row, there's block after block of them.  Like evergreen shrubs left untrimmed, they've grown and mutated into other things entirely--ersatz "museums" and the like.  It's reached the point where there actually are postcards picturing the places that sell the postcards.  I bought one of them, and it triggered these thoughts:   Not shown: The block behind you, featuring the "Hound Dog Hot Dog" stand (Elvis on the billboard); the car museum; and Barbara Mandrell Country, where I bought this card.  (Barbara's is the biggest shop on the tourist side of Music Row; on a giant TV screen, she gushes to her patrons how she "totally enjoyed every second...every minute...every hour of the days and weeks I spent planning this shop for you.")  Also not shown: The other side of the street, which is just as tawdry.  And: The sounds.  Blaring from the bullhorns mounted on Conway Twitty's (and every other shop) are hollow recordings of Conway, or Billy Ray, or Hank, Jr.  They lend a far more desolate feel to the place than the neon or fluorescent tubes could have done alone.  It feels like a carny midway--you feel stupid to be there, even on a lark.  Even worse, in a way, is the live performance across the street.  In a cheap plywood shelter in a parking lot, some knicknack shop owner who wants to attract traffic gives very marginal acts a gig.  The songs of these people, virtually none of whom will ever "make it," are depressing.  You stroll by, watching them try to smile...and you can smell their desperation.  Still worse: The fat tourists with four kids sense nothing at all.  The ultimate irony is that more postcards show this wasteland than show the real Music Row just beyond.  Several times bigger, it is actually a burgeoning, clean-swept district of office buildings and low-profile recording studios.  Tourists don't waste much time on the real Row.  You can't buy anything there.   Nashville produces unique characters.  Take the "songwriter" down the hall from me.  On his doorbell is pasted an address label, on which he's typed:   	FRONT BURNER MUSIC 	 HOME OF THE HIT  The Songwriter seemes to consider himself on the make.  When he walks anywhere, it's with a vigorous stride, as if he's going someplace important.  (He may be going to the mailbox, but he goes there full-speed.)  And speaking of speed, he seems to have a small pharmacy in the "Home of the Hit."  When his band visits (a very scary, greasy bunch of people), the smell of funny cigars drifts up the hall.  And then he takes something else, which has no smell, that induces him to call the elevator so that he can stand motionless in it for minutes at a time, resting his greying head on the wall.  Then there was the woman who started talking to me in the record store.  Her life had been shot by booze and drugs, until she discovered Christ.  And Christ told her to take her teenaged son and form a country music band.  The son smiled as the woman recited some of her lyrics from memory.  They were here in Nashville to make their fortune; she hoped that Warner would give them a contract.  As I left, I saw their "road bus" in the parking lot--a battered van, hand-painted with the name of their group.  And I wondered what happens to you when you bet it all on a dream--and fail.  Even the homeless here have a sense of country chic.  They may have only one outfit (after a while, you start to recognize them), but often it includes boots and a belt with a bulletproof buckle.  I don't know why I'm writing in this melancholy mode.  I think I might have lived on Music Row for too long.  At least if you work there, you can go home to the real world at night.

      The mind--well, my mind, at any rate--is an undisciplined thing.  It's a bundle of impulses, drives and multitasked reasoning, barely coordinated by what we call "consciousness."  So, it makes sense that thoughts are evanescent.  They're lost to forces as powerful as death or as puny as the distraction of the bozo who cuts you off in traffic.  You can spin out an argument in your head as powerful as any you've ever heard, and then lose it by the time you actually need it.  That is, if you can articulate it in the first place.  Sometimes, reasoning plays second fiddle to emotion.  Sometimes, reasoning fails us entirely.  Sometimes, not even the people who come up with a thought can follow what they've done.  We call that "intuition," or "instinct," or "the Internal Revenue Code."  Blogs are a snapshot of the mind in action.  They're first-draft journalism...published diaries...cafe chats with a microphone.  You know the nut cases who actually xerox what they mumble and hand it out as pamphlets?  Well, bloggers skip the trip to Kinko's.  And now I'm one of them.  I really don't know who will read these musings, or whether they will care.  So, I'll just throw my ideas out into the void, like a pebble into a lake, and see where the ripples go.  If you have a few minutes, you're invited to take a look at my pebble collection.  Toss in a few of your own, if you're so inclined.  Have fun.  I know I will.
