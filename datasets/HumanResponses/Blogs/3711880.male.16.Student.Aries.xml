            											Naruto, episode 88. Naruto learning a new kick-ass technique. ... Why am I doing this? I don't even watch the show anymore. Anyway, the blog is open to public. I sure do hope I get visitors. Not that I expect it, anyways.

             I love Tenjyou Tenge. Over every manga that I've read, and believe me, I've read quite a few hundreds. But the anime SUCKS. It hurts my heart to state this. The first fights were awesome, but now they've turned ugly. And we have the seiyuu's... they suck. Really bad. Aya's voice is creepy, Shin's sounds like a pig, and Bunchichi... let's not talkt about his seiyuu. ANYWAY, the opening really rocks, and I still haven't found the full-version of it.  											I'm going south and then to germany in a week, together with my family. I'm not really in the mood for this, so lets just call it a day. 											 Oh! Great 's the best!

             This anime seems to be a good mecha-anime. It's one of the best times of the year, when animes ends and new begins. Anyway, I liked the promo-song. *cough*gundamseedripoff*cough*  So, Midsummer's over (swedish-special-day-thingie), and I'm back home. It's really warm outside, but luckliy, I've got my basement. :) The mIRC-X site was changed a couple of weeks back, and now you can find it at:  urlLink MIRKX.com .

      I received the GameCube today. Can't wait to see it's beautiful shape. *cough* Right now, I don't doubt at all that I am the happiest man on earth. Right... The only thing that's missing is a memorycard (damn, I've already said that? or? my memory's, like, the worst ;)  But you don't really care, now do you? Some "news": Tenjyou Tenge has been licensed by DarkHorse (yesh, bebby) and they've also licensed the great seinen Madara. DarkHorse holds a very high quality when they print their books, so I'm more than happy to hear that it wasn't Viz that licensed the books (god, forbid). And for you shoujo-fanns out there: a new anime from CLAMP has been announced, and will air on August 1st. (source:  urlLink animenewsnetwork.com ) It's old news, but I haven't been able to survey them.

      So. Back home again.        I've been buying some neat stuffs, in the past two weeks I've been gone. Two issues of NewType USA, 4 mangas and a german anime-magazine (haha). And two cds, a South Park-CD and the music from Star Wars:... uh, the last movie *ashamed to have forgot the name, being a big fan of it and all*        I also ordered a GameCube yesterday, and pre-booked Tales of Symphonia. It'll most probably be here in the end of the week. All that's left's a memorycard...

      I didn't think they were so... you know... so... the...  I'll confess. I fell for it. Completely. God, it's so CUTE! Almost died there. For the GameCube, that is. God's gift to mankind.   Enough talking. (feels as if 99.9% (approximately) of the posts here are more or less unnecessary. but hell, it's fun to write)

       urlLink    urlLink     Just a few images coloured by me. Yeah, I know that I'm not the greatest colourartist in the world... *drowning in selfpity* The first one is a page from Naruto, scanned and translated by Inane, and I can't remember where I got the second. I really suck at art, especially at Photoshop, but hell, it's fun (have I said these words before? hmm)

                 Cartman, our little f√ºhrer. This episode is awesome, watched it again today, together with half 2nd season. People doesn't seem to like the 8th season of South Park; why, I don't know. But I think it's pretty good. *blahblahnaggingblah*  Solitude [source:  urlLink dictionary.reference.com ] 1: a state of social isolation 2: a solitary place 3: a disposition toward being alone  One of my favourite words. Not because of the meaning (well, part of it), but I think  that it's beautiful. BTW, I've added some  codes . So scroll down now. On the right side. :)

      Poor sheep, hiding over there... *pushes forward*  I've been playing Super Monkey Ball non-stop since... I dunno, lost track of time.  Nipponsei have released a new single from Asian Kung-Fu Generation, the 4th opening theme to the show FullMetal Alchemist. I'm one of their greatest fans out there (they've done great songs). The name of the song is Rewrite.  Well, I really should be going to bed. So, until then, take care and good night (dark continent!).

      Three of my favourite-mangas has/will be made this year. Monster is already airing, and Yakitate!! Japan and Bleach will both air on the 5th of October. Something to look forward to! I greatly recommend to view these shows.  I'm now out of space, totally. ~600mb respectively ~9gb. And I'm out of candy. Good thing I still have popcorn left. Phew. Couldn't live without it.

      Explorer doesn't work again (w2k), and it's pissing me off. Can't even recall how I did to fix it last time.  I've started another project; a Tsukino-fanlisting (Yakitate!! Japan). It'll be up when  I've bought a webhost and a domain (tsukino.ensngre.net - to come), and it'll be listed at  urlLink thefanlistings.org  when it's been approved of.
