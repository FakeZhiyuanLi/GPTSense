      Tonite was bad too. i was talking to my friend alex whos friends with scott, and scott was going over to his house to hang out, and i called his house and told his lil brother to tell him i called when he got off of work. and he never called me.but i went shopping w/ my mom and grandma(they buy me shit, so i said why not lol) and so i put my away message up when i left and i guess my dad clicked out of my away message and so scott though i was online you know, and he was like oh are we not talking to me now, so i asked my friend alex what was up with him, and he was like yeah i guess scott is mad at you cuz you didnt talk to him and you were ignoring him. and so if hes mad at me for that, hes got another thing coming to him, he hasnt called me in like 4 days. after messing around w/ me, what kind of message do you think that sends out?..exactly a one nite stand, and i know he wouldnt do that to me. so i dunno. i just really hope this isnt a big joke that hes playing. you know whats its like to have no one like you? and at the same time thinking someone is playing a joke on you, think of it as if someone were dumping you but at the same time you were getting stabed. yeah the fix of the 2 sux's! and scott, if your reading this call me. im not mad at you and i really wish you would let me know whats going on between us!    ~good nite~ i hope my day is great tomorrow! *wish me tons of luck*

      Tonite was the worst nite ever.I was so scared! but it is my own fault. I called this guy who i have never met to hang out, i was bored and my mom was getting home at like 11 ish, so i wanted to go out as my last nite of freedom, so called this guy up who lived in west chicago, omg what was i thinking! and we went to his work place and he liked me and i just wanted to hang out cuz i like scott, but i was bored cuz scott couldnt go out tonite. so when we got to his work(he owned the place) i felt so uncomfortable. I honestly thought that i was gunna get raped, and i just anted to get outta ther SO bad! i wanted Scott SOOO bad! and i never went near him, and he kept getting mad at me for me not hitting on him, and i wouldnt! and so i asked him to drive me to my friends house who lived like a block away form me, so the only way i could get him to take me there was to sit by him. and i did but then he was like your being rude and shit and i was so scared. when he droped me off at my friends house there was some of my other friends like carolyn,ellie,astra and christine(her house) and 2 guys wich carolyn and christine worked with and we were just hangin out and having fun, i had to be home at 11....yeah, didnt make it. lol i got home at 12:10 ish and my mom was like why didnt you call, and its kewl i talked my way out of it! and when i got home i was so scared, cuz some other person was smoking and i didnt want my mom to think i was. but its all gravy baby! cuz i used her tooth brush cuz i had taken a puff, cuz i had never tried it b4 and so my breath smelt. And one of the guys asked for my number and i was like uhh, sure why? i was like i like someone though and he was all like thats ok and used my phone. but hey its kewl im home now. darn! but ill never talk to that kid i never met again! Plus he was ugly as fuck, and fat and smelly. lol thats why i like scott, hes ABSOLUTLY none of those, hes HOTT!, with 2 t's lol, nice ass body! and always smells good! but bad news i didnt get to see scot at all today, and he probably wont call me tonite. I know why too probably. cuz when he droped me off, he didnt get home till like 11:20, meaning he was 20 min late, i feel SOO bad! but its kewl, once he gets over to his dads house i can come over whenever i want, cuz his dad likes me!! ~goodnite~

      Tonite was probably the best nite of the week.Today was ok, i cleaned the pool and then went out to dinner with my g-ma, ken(her friend) and ken's daughter(shes like 40) and then i was gunna go hang out w/ Scott(this is where my nite got good) and he called me when we were at dinner saying that he didnt have a baseball game anymore so we could hang ou tat his house. So he picked me up at like 8:30, so we got to his house at 9 ish, but you see there is a down side, he had to be home at 11, meaning we had to leave at 10:15. And i didnt care how long i got to see him for, all that mattered is that i got to see him, and boy was he HOTT! with 2 t's lol and i asked him if i was cute, he gave me a 15 out of 10 lol i thought that was cute... im no to one to kiss and tell, so i wont!(thats all im saying hehe) i kinda mat his stepdad, i sw him for like a split second when i was leaving, cuz we were in the basement, and his stepdad was upstairs when we came in. And i was like i dont want tonite to be the only nite i see you and then have you get mad at me cuz all you wanted was action or whatever, and he said i know, thats why im having you over tomorrow during the day to go swimming! i was like awwww lol but thats about it. DAM i just realized that my mom gets back tomorrow. damit! i LOVE not having my parents around, thats why i liked being in Vegas w/ out them and also why i wanted to stay longer. Who honestly wants to be around their parents everyday, not me thats for sure, its nice to take a break away from them, try it!! but anywho! lol im gunna go upstairs and try to sneak out and go do something, its so boaring here and my g-ma is in bed and its only like 11:30 so ill ttyl ~good nite~

      Today is just like yesterday. You know how i was hoping to see Scott today..guess what? uh uh didnt happen. he got in a lot of trouble with his mom and he cant do anything, so the latest i would get to see him would be the weekend. Which sucks b/c i want to hang out when my parents arent home. I like having freedom. So i have done nothing all day i went to bed at 8 am and woke up at 3pm and since then done nothing! and i miss britt so much! right now we'd be out and having fun with hot guys lol well so far i was right about glen ellyn, its boaring and i knew once i got back from Vegas i wouldnt have any fun at all, if only i could predict when i could see Scott again. That would be tyte! So last night i was talking to my "friend" jamie and he was telling me how he was mad at me for what happened between me and my ex. And he was just making me so mad that i wanted to kill myself, and i tried to last night, but it didnt work cuz i loved my sister too much! and i wanted to see scott, and all this stuff. i cnt wait till im 18, im moving out after my senior year to cali! and im living with Britt, my best friend in the world! were like sisters, and shes the only one i have felt that close to. Shes like family to me, ive known her since i was 2. and when i left her saturday the 20th, it was honestly very hard for me. i cnt get over it, i miss her so much, and just being around her has made me want to be more like her, shes my idol, that may sound wierd, but i have changed since i got back form Vegas, ive become a better person, someone more like...Britt! well ill write more later but for now i think im gunna go find something to do!                         <3  always ~Jen~

      Well today is starting off good, i woke up at 3 though, but its all good. Well the reason its starting off good, is b/c im talking to Scott, to start your day off talking to the one you like is the best feeling in the world! The only reason he didnt call me was b/c he got in trouble, and i believe him completly, things are starting to turn around. But i still miss hanging out with him, and all im hoping for is that things between me and him will happen. Do you know what its like to have liked someone for a long time and not have them like you back? maybe you do, but for me its happened too many times and im just hoping and wishing that it never happens again! My grandma just got here! woohoo, time for the party to never start! im so mad that shes staying, im happy to see her but like at the same time im not, only b/c i want to be on my own, who doesnt! but im glade shes here, b/c she prob. wont be living much longer, because she has parkinsins disease. So if i lost her i dont know what id do. and if things didnt work between me and scott, i dont know what i'll do. Well i dont have much to say anymore, so ill wrote more tonight. and ill let you know if me and scott hang out, we betta lol                  <3 always   ~Jen~

      today was ok, not as i would have wanted it to be, but me and my sister hung out and that was hella kewl, cuz me and my sister get along sometimes, but i barly see her, so we just went out to her friend pats house and watched movies. my sister fell asleep and so did pat, so i was just kinda up by myself watching gladiator and music video's.sounds fun huh? well then i woke my sister up at like 4:30, and we didnt get home till like 5 ish and ive been up ever since and its now...7:30 am and im actually not that tired, just really bored. So im so confused right now, part of the reason i havent been sleeping much. its manly b/c of this dilema with this guy Scott. I like him a lot, but you see he kinda screwed up a lot! and now i kinda cant trust him that much. were friends again and all, abd he says he likes me a lot too, and that im beautiful and all this stuff, but i dont know if i should believe him anymore. he could be just playing another joke on me, like hes done a lot in the past, and i hope hes not, cuz i dont want to have to go threw all that emotion again. and im just waiting for him to really show that he cares about me like he says he does. so i realy dont know what to believe. Ive liked this kid for 2 years and not once, until now does he say he likes me, so i hope it turns out for the best!

      Wow i havent writtin in a looong time... but a lot has happened! well i went to oklahoma for a church retreat, just like every year. but this year was more emotional and changing for me and it really made me thing about who i want to be and why i am the way i am. Basicly, ive realized that i have to start my whole life over, finding a new group of friends and change how i am. its hard ive lost all of my friends basicly they all have there own little groups and they never want to include me. i call them leave them a million messages but no one ever wants to do anything with me. and all the guys out here, dont like me or there just using me. i dunno when i went to oklahoma i met these 2 guys that live in sullivan, and they both like me but sullivan is 3 hours away so its kinda hard to have a relationship. you know what i mean. but i really hate my life, like i dunno it just sucks to know that you have to start your life over. but i dunno, i just cant wait to move to cali. and live with Britt, i love you britt! your like a sister to me. me and my friend sarah got close though. and shes so easy to talk to, and me and her are going threw the same thing. were both trying to find ourselves and be happy with ourselves and out lives. and i know some ppl that are pretty fake and shady. i wont name names, but heres the story... i liked this guy named eric for a while and my friend tells me to make moves on him all the time. and rite b4 i went to vegas i sent him a letter telling him how i felt, he never told me, and when we were in oklahoma i talked to him and he said he didnt want a gf. now my friend said she doesnt like him. but on the way home tell me why she was laying on him for like an hour. she says its cuz there was no where else to lay, why not lay the other way DUH! so whatever i hate fake ppl. especially when there your best friend. but then i went to cheer camp and i made a lot of new friends, and i saw better different sides of ppl that i never knew before. but i just wish i was pretty and i wish guys i liked didnt live so far away or werent attracted to me. i just wish my life was over. its caused me nothing but depression and unhappiness. i just want to feel good about myself.
