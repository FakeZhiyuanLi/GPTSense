As today got basketball match , i wake up late! lolz...lucky i dress up to my school uniform and then i rush to school.. as i reach school, all my friend thought i never come..and they worried alot..after the assembly, is our match i quickly dress my basketball pants and then dress into my school house T-Shirt.       The first match is vs the ultimate team,xaiver that team..we have no confident as never play as good as we have last time.. propably is that we even dun have a finger to lay on them.. Second, we vs junjie that team by a rematch..still we loss another 3 point by Joshua's tyco 3-pointer shot..hAiX we felt as we lose against junjie that team..i hate that..

      YaWn... WOw...6.30 already...getting excited as the basketball inter-house is going to start today..my team got Jacob,Desmond,Russell,Jiajie and me.. at first i go to school to discuss formation then started off playing..               Matches going to start the first team is Stingray(which is my class  group but not mine )vs Darkness(junjie group) They started off playing first so my team have to wait lolz :(.. but at last, the match have ended... the score is 2:2 that a draw..then secondly..my team(which is Snowflakes) vs darkness and we lose by Junjie's 3-pointer shot..while we only got 2 point for that..the 3rd match is my team(also!)vs stingray.   Unfortunaly,we win then 16:3... that was pretty good lolz.. haiX...then in the end becoz we trash stingray by 13point, we went into final. I feel sorry for my class team..which they tried very hard...
