						   Well, today is going okay. I have applied for a few jobs, done the bills and balanced the check book. I am currently a house spouse. I think I could get used to this. It's too bad I can't take this on as a full time occupation!  Cocoa, the cat, is in heat and won't shut up! She is normally a recluse but is now very affectionate. The poor thing doesn't feel good at all. the other two cats are nowhere to be found. I gues they are avoiding her. Soon they will be in heat, too.   The back yard needs mowed. I plan to get on that after I get a haircut this afternoon. My hair is so long I can comb it straight back like a gangster. It will feel so much better soon.  Sis called me to let me know the counselors at school think she will be one of the top ten juniors for grades this year. Go sis! The girl works like a demon to maintain grades while swimming and while working. She works harder than most adults. It should be fun to watch her grow up.

						   This is my first entry. I have long wanted to a place write down my thoughts but have never gone through with the process. Today I saw an article on Yahoo that talked about this web site and decided this would suit my needs just fine.  Today is my last Monday working for this company. I am a production planner. The company is closing operations in Mexico and our office, located in San Antonio, is no longer needed. I have worked for this company for twelve years, initially in Laredo Texas, and, for the last 10 years in San Antonio.  Losing my job has me filled with anxiety. I have two children, a nine year old son and a seventeen year old daughter. Although my wife has a good job, I am unsure of what our future will be. My daughter will be a senior in high school next year and will go to college the year after. How we'll pay for that I do not know.  My dad worked as a lithographer and lost his job when I was the same age my daughter is now. We moved to a little town in Illinois where I finished school. My senior year of high school was six weeks long. I had enough accumulated credit from the district I was in to graduate in Illinois and only had to wait through a probationary period to receive a degree. Knowing money was tight, I never asked about going to college but rather started working. My first job was with a company in Merriam Kansas near where I grew up. Finding myself in the same position now as dad was then is really scary. We kids never knew how difficult it was for him.  On one hand I am sure all will turn out well and on the other I am consumed with guilt for failing my family. I worry about how we will survive financially and how we will give to our children the things we want to give them. I look at mom and dad today and see two people that have survived the years still waking each day happy and with a bright outlook. I know, I hope, I will be the same when I am their age.  One of my brothers is currently searching for a job and it worries mom and dad so much I am reluctant to tell them about me. I feel so alone not sharing this but don't want to add the stress to their lives. They will probably be upset when they do learn of this but I'll accept that when it comes.  Luckily, the company is giving me a generous severance package which will keep us afloat until Christmas. I have started searching for jobs here in San Antonio. I will probably have to take a job outside my experience at much less money. Finding work would be easier if I looked outside the city, or better, outside the state. I won't do that as I have promised my daughter I would not move the family before she graduated from high school.

						   My son and I are visiting Mom and Dad. I have not been to their house in about a year and am overdue for a visit. It took 13 hours to drive here. Mom had dinner ready when we walked through the door. Spaghetti red, she calls it. It's pasta, hamburger, onion, and tomato sauce seasoned with chili powder. A staple from my childhood.  I came here to tell them about losing my job but find I cannot do it. My brother is still searching for work and I do not want to add to their worries.   Dad's breathing is worse. He and I went to the Walmart today and after walking from the parking lot to the store he had to sit on a bench to catch his breath. He has emphysema. His death looms just over the horizon. All the years of smoking have exacted a terrible toll and he knows it. It tragic to talk with him about the disease.  My son spent most of the day with Mom sorting quarters and filing them in albums. She is trying to get complete sets of the new state quarters for each grandchild. He was thrilled to be helping Gram. She was thrilled too.  We will be here one more day and will return home Friday. I plan to leave early so I can get home and clean the air conditioner that is having trouble keeping up with the Texas heat. The girls are home with all the windows open and the air turned off. Poor things must really be suffering.  It's eleven o'clock at night. I have sorted through e-mail and checked my lottery numbers(dang! Missed again!). I am going to read the news and go to bed. Tomorrow will be another day spent with the folks talking about old stories and old friends.
