      I've been trying to post this comment below for a couple of days...i think that there was a problem with the host site.  If you have been trying to post thoughts or comments and have been unsuccessful i'd give it another go.

      Hey everyone, I was thinking, "Let's kinda keep with the this theme a bit longer and explore those in our lives that may have been "heroes" to us (not the loaded definition of hero we've been talking about but more along the lines of spiritual mentor or example".  Many of us have, from time to time, been challenged by the lifestyle, passion, articulation, and faith of many (or few) people over the years.  What made these individuals so significant in your life?  What insight or change in you did they encourage or help express?  Where these people directly influential in your life or were they more on the periphery (i.e. professor, author, dude you talked with on the bus)?  These people who have challenged us do not have to necessarily come from a Christian perspective...just those who have had the most influence on your character, though, faith, or whatever formation.  I'm hoping that as we share the stories of these life-altering encounters and relationships we may see, in part, "What makes some relationships more transformational than others?" and how can we as individuals share this same signifcance with those around us?

      I don't have anything too profound to start with.  I think it would be best to just share the intention of this blog, why i felt it worthwhile to create and why i've welcomed you to join together for this conversation.  Over the past few months i've been frequenting emerging church websites (i.e. theooze.com, emergentvillage.org, and to some degree relevantmagazine.com) and have found that though their forum discussions are valueable they are at times quite out of context in regards to Canada (with our unique religious and social climate) and at times out of touch with the reality of serving, attending, and valuing the evangelical local church.  Basically, for every positive thought-provoking post there is typically 7-10 negative or out of context posts to navigate through.  In addition to this, the conversation always remains in the abstract.  I thought if we can have this same conversation with people we know, spend time with, worship and serve with their would be far greater benefits and possibly some awesome thoughts that reflect where Skyview Community Church is now, who we are, and where God may be calling us to move to.  That is the primary intention of this blog.  Secondarily though is this thought i recently heard from a pastor of Solomon's Porch in Minneapolis.  One of their priorities is to create things that are unique to their faith community.  Whether it is as simple as the language they use or the style of architecture or even the worship songs they share on a Sunday morning...everything is unique to their church.  When i heard this my heart resonated strongly.  I've often felt the same way about Skyview...let's use our combined experiences, faith, thoughts, and abilities to make "Made in Skyview Solutions" and to ask Skyview questions, and more importantly to truly develop our character and personality as a community.  I think this blog will move us a few steps closer in order to do this.  The final reason for this blog is a personal one.  For a few year now i've been challenged by the idea of who are the people who influence me...and who should influence me.  I heard the pastor of First Assembly casually mention one day about discussing a major decision with his "men of Issachar".  I had never heard of these guys but after looking for some biblical references i found that they served a unique role as advisors to King David.  David's leadership style was to surround himself with the best men(and maybe women) in their respective fields in order to lead more effectively.  For his armed forces he choose leaders who were the best generals and soliders to lead the men by example.  This is all described in 1 Chronicles.  The Men of Issachar served as advisors and counsel to David, the phrase,"understanding the signs of the times" is important because they need to have insight that is both spiritual and cultural.  I've invited all of you to become these men and women of Issachar for me.  Some of you I know quite well, others not so much, but as we've spend some time together i've seen spiritual insight and intregity in your words, actions, and ideas.  I would like to have you, if you are willing, be a sounding board for me (and perhaps each other as well).  As mentioned in the invitation email, i am toying with the idea of writing something (on the advice of a friend)in order to put my thoughts down on paper...for posterity.  The more insights, perspectives and challenging ideas that are shared the better.  I guess in order to move forward i'd like to facilitate the discussion a bit.  I'll offer up a question that has been on my mind and I welcome everyone's input.   "Is is more important to be a "Spiritual Hero" or to be a "Spiritual Human"?   The context of this question is the common held challenge for Christians to "step-up" and be a faith hero...as many of those who have gone before us.  It is often shared that by raising our personal bar we serve as a great example to younger generations...an example of the power of God to transform and to become a more faithful servant.  Part of the counter perspective is that by aspiring to be a hero we not only overlooking the spiritual growth and significance of "being human/normal" and in fact set ourselves up for disappointment, failure, and in minimizing our humanity to the point that we are ashamed of how God made us.  Is being human more "authenitic"?  Do we place unreal expectations on Christians or spiritual directors to be more than human...to be heroes?  Is that fair or a misapplication of Paul's call to be "all things to all men" and the role of faith "heroes" found in Hebrews?  Anyway...that's good start to chew on.
