      I don't know if i mentioned it or not, but recently my computer went belly up.  A 5 year old laptop...  The power supply started having shorts and the hard drive died (i don't mean crashed, i mean DIED). The cost to fix it would have been just as much as a new Wal-Mart special, so i am going to go with the special.  It's just not worth it. So now I am sharing a computer with my parents.  Joy...

       urlLink    This is me...  It&#39;s actually a recent pic, surprisingly enough.  I figured, since i can&#39;t get it hosted anywhere else, i might as well put it here so i can put it in my profile.

      Well, I am up and not sure what's going on this morning...  Parentals are freakng out over the cats.  Seems my cat won't let their cat use the litter box or something ike that.  I don't know.  All i know is that my legs are killing me once again.  I really wish this whole getting strength back from being bedridden for 3 months thing would hurry up.  If it weren't for the pain in my legs and feet i would more than likely still be asleep.

      Well, here I am...&nbsp; my life is now literally an open book.&nbsp; At least, what I decide to publish is.&nbsp; There is so much that has happened in the past three months that I really don't know where to begin.&nbsp; I guess the beginning is the best.&nbsp;   For the past year I have been back home.&nbsp; Good ole Georgia.&nbsp; I had a great job in the Mortgage industry, and was pretty happy.&nbsp; My hobbies included work, school, and traveling GA.&nbsp; I believe&nbsp; I became a regular at every sex club, bathhouse, and gay resort in GA.&nbsp; (Didn't expect that did you?&nbsp; You'll find I am pretty blunt and open with stuff like that.&nbsp; Yes, I am a slut and love it.)&nbsp; Things were going good until October of last year, when I began to lose weight at a rapid pace.&nbsp; With my favorite hobby, the first thing that came to mind was HIV.&nbsp; I got tested, and came up negative.&nbsp; Then came the tests from my doctors.&nbsp; Specialists were called in, and after drinking more barium that one person should, I was diagnosed with Crohnes disease.&nbsp;&nbsp; Great, a disease that they really can't control, don't know what causes it, and affects my favorite areas, namely the ass.&nbsp;   I lived with it for a while.&nbsp; Still was having sex, still was having fun, and was still working.&nbsp; Then came May of this year.&nbsp; For about two weeks my breathing became lighter and lighter.&nbsp; At first I thought it was just too many cigs, too much pot, and too many poppers.&nbsp; Boy was I wrong.&nbsp; Eventually I could barely sustain myself after even walking a small distance.&nbsp; To the doctor I went.&nbsp; Again.&nbsp; This time it was pneumonia.&nbsp; It eventually landed me in the hospital, and guess what.&nbsp; It was the killer.&nbsp; The kind that generally only HIV patients get.&nbsp; Well, the test came back positive this time.&nbsp; I spent three weeks in that damn hospital.&nbsp; My parents by my side and no time to deal.&nbsp; When they finally let me out (an event postponed many times because the stress was causing me blood pressure problems) I was just beginning to come to terms with my now permanent illnesses.&nbsp; What was I going to do?   Enter once again the Crohne.&nbsp; After two weeks of being at home I was forced back into the hospital for some minor, but extremely necessary surgery to correct the newest effect of the Crones disease.&nbsp; It was a grand success, but they kept me for observation anyway.&nbsp; Good thing they did.&nbsp; Stress seizures started gripping me, until my psyche finally cracked and I let everything out that had been building since I found out I was poz.&nbsp;   I'm home now, and recovering quite nicely.&nbsp; I feel great, and have for a few weeks.&nbsp; Heck, I can even sit down now that the surgery area is almost healed.&nbsp; The have only been a few problems: 1)&nbsp; Over concerned parents that I live with, who have driven me near the point of insanity out of pure love and concern.  2)&nbsp; I am stir crazy as hell...&nbsp; haven't left the house in weeks.&nbsp; See number 1.  3)&nbsp; Fantasies are beginning to stir, dark desires and things I had only scratched the surface of are beginning to rear their ugly head.&nbsp; Being horny as hell is starting to wear on my resistance.

      Haven't written in a few days. Been kinda busy designing my new computer. :-) This thing is going to be sweet. It's great having a best friend who designs systems for people like Freddie Mac.  I want to thank everyone for their comments so far. I'll try to get some of the requests answered soon. As for the general stuff, life has been good. Visited some friends today while i was out of the house. Had a Dr. appointment. For once the news was good, all my counts (CBC counts) are up, and actually only .1 or .2 below normal. I thought my doctor was going to do cartwheels when she saw it considering only a month or so ago they were just above dead. I'll find out my CD4 and Load later this month. Meds are going well too, only real side effect I am having is joint and muscle pain, which because of burcitus, i have lived with my whole life. No big deal.  As for the parentals, they are starting to relax. I no longer hear "Are you OK?" every time i make a sound, strange or otherwise. We are all starting to get on each other's nerves again, always a good sign. I am extremely greatful for them. If not for their love and support, I would not be alive to write this blog. Hopefully they will let me out of the house on my own soon. LOL  Also went today and registered for the GA regents test. I figure, if they won't let me work, I might as well go back to school and get my degree. I have to take that blasted test before Georgia Southern will let me take anymore classes though. Something about me being technically a Junior and having not taken the test yet.  Nothing I can't handle though. My major, which surprisingly has stayed the same recently, will be Public Relations. Please, no comments on the irony of a slut like me being in the Public Relations field. My friends have already supplied me with plenty. :-)
