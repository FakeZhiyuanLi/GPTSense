      So... I haven't updated in a while. Sry about that! Anyway, this week was really stressful I must say.  Seems everything was due because senior trip is tomorrow and they wanted to fit everything in before then! Wednesday was pretty boring.  School, training (hung with Miss C cause softball actually had a day off!!), came home.  The usual... Yesterday was a long day though.  School, training for softball's practice then right to the basketball banquet.  BLAH! can you say long day? it's ok.  I love training and wouldn't want to be anywhere else anyway.  The banquet was alright too.  I guess I just feel a little out of place since I don't play.  We get invited as all but... I dunno I don't really want to go into much more detail about it in here.... anyway. Today was alright.  School, then training all day/night.  Softball had another night game! wahoo 10-0 against Burlington Twp! this is really exciting because this is the team we beat in 19 innings 2  years ago and lost to in states last year.  It started to rain which wasn't fun, but it's ok. Again good times with Miss C.  We leave for senior trip tomorrow am at 4! yay! 4 days in Florida! It couldn't have come at a better time either! I feel like I should be opening up more in here, using it as a way to vent my inner feelings because that's why I started this, however, quite frankly, I don't know that I can trust everyone who reads this. I have a hard time trusting a lot of people.  I used to trust some people and lost it... oh well... we'll see. Im off to bed so I can wake up tomorrow morning! I'll update next time on both florida trips!!

      Yet another long day.  I forgot to post yesterday. Actually, I didn't forget I just didn't have time, I wanted to sleep.  Nothing too exciting happened yesterday so it's ok.  Just went to school and then practice.  Well actually, I trained for the lax game and some of baseball- just bounced back and forth, because... well... that's a long story I won't get into.  Whatever, it was fun.  I always have fun there, for the most part.  Sometimes I get frustrated or pissed, but for the most part I always enjoy myself.  I usually find something to laugh about... chances are I'll just do something stupid and that'll start it off.  Then last night I went home and did homework.  Then I went to bed.  That's usually my life.... shcool training homework sleep.  Today was a good day too though.  Went to school... blah! I really don't like school that much anymore.  Aside from the occational few good moments, I don't really like it.  Strange since I live there- but I really like it after classes (does that make any sense).  Anyway, then did the whole training thing.  There was a track meet today and since softball had a night game I hung out with Miss C. for a while there.  Today was one of those days where I was frustrated and pissed but something happened, I can't even remember what, and it made it all better.  Weird how that can happen.  After that it was a pretty good night.  Went and got Wendy's for dinner. YUM. Ate it at the field watching our softball game.  Good times in the training room afterwards when we were cleaning up.  :-) hahahaha Now.... I'm home... avoiding studying for my english test.  THat's about it... Maybe i'll study a lil and go to bed early! GASP! haha ok... Im done babbling now.  maybe I'll update tomorrow.

      Well... today was gorgeous!! I woke up early cause I had to help out around the house with my Grandma since no one else was home and she broke her ankle.  I hung out, outside most of the day by the pool, even though it's not open yet.  I got even more burnt but that's ok. It'll be tan soon.  I also did a ton of laundry, but whatever it needed to be done.  Then I showered up, attempted some physics and went to family dinner at Matt's Nan's.  Good times, I love his little cousins, they're so cute.  Now here I am again, trying to do physics. It sucks and no one understands it! blah! I'm going to bed... maybe I'll update more tomorrow! later

      Ok. So here goes another attempt at starting this thing up again.  We'll see how it goes.  Anywho... today was a long day I must say.  Woke up early to go to the softball tournament all the way in Jersey City- we won wahoo! I was there alll day!! then came home, showered and went to the bowling alley to see Matt for a while.  Nothing to exciting but Im kinda tired.  I just got back from Florida on Thursday night with the softball team! What an awesome time!! SOooo many funny moments!! haha Gotta love the NBC softball girls! Then, what's even crazier, is this time next week I'll be in Florida again with senior trip! Im so excited!! I got some color so Im no longer clear! I can't wait to get even darker.  There's been a lot going on in my head lately though.  I suppose I will share it in here since most people won't read it anyway.  Let's see, where to start.    Things have been getting crazier and crazier.  Im almost out of highschool and its so exciting yet so scarey.  In about four months, I'll be in college! California University of Pennsylvania here I come! yet- Im not sure I'm totally ready.  I am going to miss so many things about Northern and the relationships there.  I don't have many friends in the senior class- which is ok when it comes time to graduate because we're all going our seperate ways. Yet, I am pretty close with underclassmen and even a lot of teachers that Im going to miss.  It's going to be so weird not seeing them like I do now.  I know I can still keep in touch through email and I know I'll be back, but I guess it's just not the same.  Maybe Im scared I won't make any friends in college.  I think that's it.  I honestly don't think I have many friends in highschool.  I used to, but I guess I'm not good enough for them anymore. I don't really know honestly.  I grew apart from everyone.  As weird as it is... Im not really sure it is a bad thing.  I have come to realize who I am and what makes me happy but I honestly miss them. ALL.  I miss going out with the girls.  I don't have any girl friends that I hang out with outside of school.  It sucks.  I think that's making me fear that I won't have any friends in college- because I lost all mine in highschool.  It was weird, I roomed with Danni for the Florida trip.  We used to be best friends, then we stopped talking- long story.  Anyway, Danni and I hung out almost the whole trip.  It was like old times- which I guess is good and bad.  I miss what we had.  I honestly do.  I think Im a better person because I was able to find who I am since we stopped talking, yet... I still miss her.  She was my best friend... I don't even know what you could call us now honestly.  Oh well... I dunno anymore.  I can't wait to get away though, because I can't stand being in my house anymore.  It seems when Im here, I just get in trouble.  That's why I spend so much time at school- in the training room.  I fit in there. Im good at something, Im needed, the people understand me, I have fun.  I dunno... I want to be part of a group. I know Im part of groups now... like softball and the training crew and all, but I want a group that I see outside school.  I want that group of friends that you can hang out with, invite over- party with.  Im a senior in highschool and I've never been to a party.  I've never even been invited to one. It's rediculous.  I dunno... maybe I have too many regrets from highschool... maybe I'm just a dork. I dunno...   I think that's all Im going to post right now.. Maybe later I'll post on the Florida trip. I don't feel like it right now though.  Later!!

      so I haven't updated in a while.  That's cause I've been super busy.  With what, Im not really sure, I guess just school, softball and everything in general.  Softball's still going well.  They're 24-4.  Lost to RV again, damnit.  Don't really want to talk about that right now though.  School's ok. Less than a month till Im out! thank God! Not too much else going on.  Not in the mood to spill my guts... later

      So.. I had an ok week.  Softball's going well.  Hard to believe states start on Thursday.  Love athletic training.  Had some awesome times.  Gonna miss it.  AP Bio test is officially over! wahoo!! Yea, I def got a negative score on it, but that's ok.  at least its over.  Dad had his promotion ceremony on Thursday.  It was nice.  I can't believe I'm almost done high school.  I'm ready to go.  I'm tired of all the freaking drama.  I can't take it.  Going to miss some things though.  I dunno.  I have a lot of regrets.  Well... I dunno.  Today was at school for the baseball game and lax practice.  Softball had off, it's amazing.  Anyway, I trained for them then went out to the car show cause Matt was in it.  Well, not Matt but his car was :-P.  anyway was out there for a while.  He didn't win but that's ok.  Then went back to his house and hung out for a while.  It was nice.  Came home and took a 3 hour nap.  Weird.... anyway... I don't know what else to say so later!

      so, yea... last night was the prom.  It really made me think.  I guess that's how you could put it.  Not just last night, but the entire prom in general, everything like planning it to making arrangements and everything else... I read Brian's Journal and I guess in a way I can totally relate to him, except, I don't have friends.  I have Matt.  And I have athletic training.  I only seem to be happy, temporarily, when Im either with matt or training.  It's really sad.  I dunno. I dunno what I did that made me loose the people I cared about so much.  I guess I just wasn't good enough.  That wouldn't suprise me because it always seems to be the case.  I try, I really do.  But I get nothing in return. Ever.  Maybe that's why all I have is Matt and training.  I'm good enough there.  Matt loves me, I know he does.  I get frustrated sometimes cause it's not always as clear as I need it to be but that's just because Im so damn insecure.  We've been dating for over a year and a half- I should be secure enough, but I'm not.  I just don't want to loose him.  Im afraid one day Im not going to be good enough for him either.  It just seems like its going to be a matter of time because that's how it has been with everyone else.  I can't loose him.  He means too much.  I love that guy with all my heart.  He's my best friend (more like my only friend but thats ok because he's more than I could ask for)  Im good in the athletic training room too.  People depend on me.  I like that.  I have fun.  But it's strange- people depend on me so much in there, but in the hallways I don't even exist to them.  I guess Im just not good enough to get a "hi" in the hallway.  Im never good enough at home.  I always do something wrong.  From the minute I walk in- which is usually late because the later I come home and the less time I spend there, the less time I can get yelled at, be littled, ignored, and in trouble.  I try to fill my time with the 2 things that make me happy, but there's always this gap.  This never ending ache.  There's always a peice of me missing.  Friends.  Like girlfriends.  I don't have any.  I don't get it.  I used to, but again, Im not good enough.  I don't understand really.  I walk down the hallways alone.  Stand at my locker alone.  Go to class, surrounded by people I may  once have concidered friends, but feel completely alone.  Nothing would matter if I wasn't there to them.  It may matter to teachers, they're the only ones that seem to notice I exist anymore.  Unless someone needs something from me.  I hate this feeling, when I get this way.  Usually I can hide it.  Im a good actress.  I've done it a lot...   Prom last night was ok.  I wouldn't have gone if it weren't for Matt.  It was on a boat which was really pretty and it was a gorgeous night so we were outside the whole time which was great.  If he weren't there I probably would have thrown myself overboard though.  The whole thing about lack of friends and all really hit me last night with prom and all.  Between planning the dance and me not having anyfriends to plan anything with, to during the dance.... to after when I had to friends to do anything afterwards with... I just felt like an ass.  Even though it wasn't Matt's prom I feel like a made him have a bad time.  I loved being outside and him holding me.  It was the best feeling in the world.  but, like I said, there was something missing.  There wasn't that group.  I liked it just the two of us sometimes but I dunno.  It was different too because there were 2 dance floors.  That was good and bad.  I didn't have to see half the people, mostly those I didnt want to see.  I was able to say hello and never see them again for the rest of the night. I also feel like I missed half of what was going on.  It was just different.  If someone were to ask me if I would do it again, I probably would as long as Matt came.  This is better than senior trip which I said I would never do over again.    I think there's something wrong with me.  I can't be happy for an extended period of time.  Im happy in the training room and with Matt. Thats it.  The best night (senior prom) and best 4 days (senior trip) of my highschool career didn't even bring that much happyness.  It's like I don't know how to have fun anymore, or what fun is.  The senior prom pretty much means your senior year and highschool career is over.  My senior year has pretty much sucked. As much as I gained, there's still a void.  I feel like a peice of me is missing.  I found one peice but lost an even bigger one.  Im about to graduate highschool and have never been to a party, never drank, like never go out... I feel like I missed so much in highschool.  I tryed to be a good kid and get the most out of it. I got involved, got good grades, played sports then athletic training, developed some great relationships with teachers but Im still not happy.  Why? why can't I just be happy for what I do have.  I dunno.... I can't... Im empty.  I want to go out and have a good time, laugh till my sides hurt with people who love me, be myself and have them love me for it, to have girlfriends to have sleepovers with, freinds that call to see how your day was just because they care, that call you to see what your doing and want to know if you want to hang out, friends that smile when they see you because they're genuenly happy to see you-not becuase it's polite, friends that call at midnight because they need someone to talk to and that 10 minute venting session that we needed turns into a 2 hour long conversation that ends with both of us laughing and smiling forgetting what our problems were, friends that let me know, no matter what happens in the future we'll make it because we'll always have eachother.  more so, I want to be happy- more than temporarily.  Matt- if you read this, don't take it personally. you're more than I could ask for.  you make me happy and I hope you know that, there's just a place for you in my heart and another place that's empty, a place you cant fill.  I love you. I always will.  Thank  you for all you've done because its more than you realize and more than I could ask for.    I just realized I don't know why I write in here because Im sure no one really even reads it.  Oh well, it helps me get it off my chest at least......... later to anyone who cares

      Yea... so I've been TOTALLY busy lately... school, training, prom blah blah blah... yea... school's going... I just want to be done, seriously now.  Been preparing for the AP Bio test on monday! ahh shoot me in the face.  Oh well.. Training, well that's been great as normal.  Seems to be the only thing keeping me going to school day to day for the most part.  I always have tons of laughs in there and Im finally good at something.  That's really something Im going to miss next year... I'll still be doing it just not at northern and that saddens me.  Prom is tomorrow.  Been stressing a lil, ok a lot, over it all.  Its just so much work. I want it to be over, ok maybe not over but at least get started... then I won't have to stress... :-) I can't believe senior year's almost over.  It's crazy. Im so excited. Im tired of all the highschool bullshit and dealing with certain people.  I want to make friends (true friends- Im not sure if I can concider anyone a true friend right now- except Matt- but I want true girlfriends, that might be hard though now, since I have trouble trusting them) I want to learn new things, practice new things... grow as a person. I want to only have to talk to people from northern that I want to keep in contact with (probably very few and probably mostly teachers- and the training crew) I want to get away from home and prove I can make it.... Its just hard to believe its over.  I got some great news about a possible summer job(s)... will share more once all is official... k... time for bed... later!!

      Hey... so here's my update.  Got back from senior trip Tuesday night.  It was ok... yes, just ok. I must say, I had SOoOoO much more fun on the florida trip with softball.  There was so much fucking drama during the senior trip.  Rumors and people being bitches and all... it just all got on my nerves.  Maybe I didn't have so much fun because I am not actually part of a group as far as friends go, I don't really have many.  I always felt like an outsider, no matter where I was or who I hung out with.  It wasn't cool.  Softball trip was awesome though! OMG i don't think I've laughed or had so much fun in four days then I did then.  Oh well.  Im glad to be home though.  That's really all I wanted during most of the senior trip.  To go home and get away from some people and shit going on.  I don't really feel like going into too much detail about the trip.  If you want more details  you'll just have to ask and I'll probably tell you.  Wednesday we got to go in late to school. That was nice.  I didn't sleep in, but the break was still nice. Did my usual training after school.  We did like nothing in classes.  It was quite nice I must say.  Thursday was another day in school but again we did like nothing.  We had a game on Thursday at Willingboro.  That was alright, we killed them, practiced and still made it back to school in time for me to see the last few innings of the baseball game.  That was cool too cause the guys won in extra innings! During the softball game some girl from 'boro got hit and was like i hurt my uturus.  It was funny.  Friday was the physics trip to great adventure.  That was fun for the most part.  I was kinda tired of amusement parks but it was ok.  Whit tried to force me on Nitro and I almost cryed.  Funniest part was her getting the RV physics shirt! haha Oh good times.  Then back to school for training (like normal).  That was fun.  Spent some time with Jill and Miss C.  Then they all left me and we had a night game against RV.  We won't talk about that though.  >:-/ Got home around 9:30. Was back at school this morning for lax practice and a frosh baseball game.  I couldn't stay that long though because I had to go work a birthday party for the 2 little girls I babysit for.  There was 32 kids there! It wasn't that bad though.  Then I picked up my prom dress from being altered.  I can't believe it's in less than a week!! I can't believe it's May already no less!! Just a few more months! wahoo!! Now Im sitting here bored as hell.  I might actually do some homework in a little while.  Probably not though! oh well I don't feel like typing anymore so yea... later

       ...::One Day Left of High School!::...   So my last full week of high school is over.  Overall it was pretty good.  Took my finals and all.  Most of them were made so easy that a preschooler could pass them.  I liked that.  I guess the teachers don't want to end up with us next year again.  Friday I worked an LPGA event instead of going to school because I had no finals and it would ahve been stupid to sit there for hours doing nothing.  The event was alright.  Then i went to class night... after I found it of course.  Class night was alright too.  People started to cry, which I don't understand because most are crying because they think they'll never see people again.  First of all, if you're that upset over never seeing someone again, you're going to take the time to see them outside of highschool I guarantee it.  You will keep in touch with those you want to. And second- Murphy's Law- there is no getting away from these people because those that you ABSOLUTLY HATE will find someway of seeing you, you'll run into them somewhere it's bound to happen! Just deal with it!! you may not see them everyday but that's alright. That's better than alright in most cases it's great! I for one am very excited to graduate.  I'll admit there are some things I will miss however I'm ready to move on. I've experienced high school, I've delt with the drama, I've done it, I have regrets but most people do.  I'm ready to move on and start over.  Over these past 4 years I've changed and become close to the person I want to be.  High school's done that for me but there isn't much else I can take from it.  I need something new to learn from.  I'm ready for bigger and better things with new challenges that will help me really become the person I want to be. I will miss a lot of things about NBC- mostly the teachers beause of what I said about your classmates before.  And I have regrets, I admit that, but really who doesn't.  ANd all my regrets, have only made me a better person. They've made me want to better for college and that's what I'm focusing on now.  I can't wait to go.  anyway.... aside from that... the rest of my weekend.... Bill's party was last night and that was TONS of fun!! I had such a good time!! Today was father's day so I did a lot of running around then had family dinner.  that was about it... I graduate tomorrow!! wahoo... ok that's it bye

I want to go see it when it comes out... now i just need someone to go with me... hm...

      ...::Less than two weeks!::...  Holy shit, I can't believe my high school career will be over in less than 2 weeks. It's crazy!!! I think it's starting to hit me.  Yesterday was the athletic training end of the year party.  I must say it was a good time.  I had a few suprises up my sleeve ;) caught most off guard which was always fun.  The best was seeing them smile though.  Didn't end up leaving until ten of 8.  We watched a Leauge of Their Own. I love that movie. Then we cleaned up and stuff.  Was the last time I'll clean that training room in highschool so I had to do my "normal" routine.  They, of course, made fun of me.  I guess it's not normal to ASK to clean certain things, but... I dunno... Miss C gave her speech to the seniors and I didn't cry, I was proud of myself.  It could have been because Mark was nudging me the making jokes to me the whole time just so I didn't cry. But either way I was proud.  Then... the hardest part came.  I had to say good-bye when we were leaving. I cried.  Yes, I know Im a sissy.  I can't help it.  I was sad.  weird.... anyway... that was my day yesterday. It kinda sucked- but it was good. I dunno.  Im just going to miss it.  I have so many memories from there and what's what Im going to think of when I think of my senior year in highschool and when it had to end... it just upset me.  None of the other seniors were upset but I guess that's because none of them really had a connection like I did.  Hell some of them barely showed up.  I lived in there. I "found myself" there.  I grew as a person and made some awesome friends.  It's just sad for me. Oh well, that's life and there's nothing I can do about it.  To anyone who reads this from the Athletic Training room- Thanks for making my senior year so great.  You guys have been like a second family to me.     Today was the senior awards assembly.  That was nice just for the simple fact that I missed half of my double lab in Honors Physics and all of Calc! wahoo.  I also got a $1000 scholarship so that was even nicer. Other than that, the assebly was long as hell and it made my butt numb from sitting so long.  Then was the rest of school.  School right now seems pretty dumb to me. We really don't do much in any of the classes.  Teachers have gotten as much senioritis as we have.  I must say, I have it pretty bad, but I can still do work if asked to. So far, I really haven't been.  Afterschool was the NHS pizza party.  We were supposed to get it in the winter because we raised the most toys in the Toy's for Tots Drive but everyone's so busy during the school year after school that this was the first time we could arrange it.  Mr. Roman didn't really like the idea of pizza during homeroom, I dont understand why.  Then I came home and fell asleep for a while.  I was so tired! then... I woke up and went to babysit. I needed the money otherwise my mother was either going to sell me to gypsies or put me in a debtor's prison.  I have paid my debts off however and things are all good now.  Other than that, nothing's really going on.  I'll talk to yens later.  (like how Im starting to talk like a Pittsburger- I think that's really funny, just a few more things I learned in the training room! haha) later!

      ...::And senior year continues::...  Well, I haven't writtin in a while... I should really be more consistant with this whole posting thing.  School's wrapping up. There's only like 2 more weeks!  Im majorly slacking. All the sports teams are done (yes- even softball which finished shortly after my last post) so that means that athletic training for me in highschool is just about over.  It sucks.  Im going to miss it.  Even though I'm doing it in college, its just not going to be the same.  Im going to miss all the people and the jokes, the friends, the bonds, the late nights, early saturday mornings (weird yes, I know), the good times and the bad (man were there some frustrating times, but I think it just brought a lot of us closer together as a group).  Those people are like my family- I spend so much time with them.  It's really very sad.  It seems like now though, that schools wrapping up and sports are done, I have a lot more to do.  Yesterday I worked the 6th grade field day (as a student athletic trainer! :-D ), yesterday was also the NHS blood drive that I helped organize (so I had to be in at 6:30 to set up).  I missed all my classes yesterday, it was quite nice.  Tomorrow I'm missing class again because Miss C set up something so we could all get certified (or recertified in my case and many others) in first aide and CPR.  That should be quite fun.  This means I'll only be in class 2 days this week! wahoo.  Monday night is the Burlington County Student Athletic Training Senior Recognition banquet that we're going to.  That means I have to get dressed up... great!! Then Tuesday afterschool we're having a party for athletic training.  Wednesday night Im babysitting! Yea... pretty busy.  Aside from just these things, they bring more challenges because I have things to do to get ready for them, expecially the athletic training party.  It'll all be worth it though.  Other than that nothing else really has been going on.  I keep myself pretty well occupied although I must say it is weird comming home before 5:30/6.  Im gonna peace out of here... later

      ...::And so it continues.....::...  yea... summer is still rolling on.&nbsp; I can't belive it's already the middle of June. Its kinda crazy to me.&nbsp; So what have I been up to since the last time I updated this thing... hm...&nbsp; The basketball camp ended Friday.&nbsp; That was.. hm.. how can I put this, Hell.&nbsp; There were so many boys and they didn't listen it was all just nuts.&nbsp; I'm glad I got my wistle because I lost my voice.&nbsp; It was fun though because of the other people that worked it.&nbsp; I liked spending time there with Miss C too, even if she did get mad at me for "beating my kids".&nbsp; I didn't really beat them, it just seemed it was all my kids getting hurt.&nbsp; Oh well... Now I'm working the North Hanover summer rec camp.&nbsp; It's alright. It's def not as much fun as it has been in the past years.&nbsp; I miss Brooks there.&nbsp; And now that Tawny's not there it's boring.&nbsp; yes, Matts there but we don't really talk during camp, its weird.&nbsp; There's a new guy in charge with Mr. Strons and well I just dunno if I like him yet.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; We've already gone skating and today we're going golfing... we shall see.&nbsp; I've also been working.&nbsp; I'm begining to not really like kids that much.&nbsp; This is like perfect birth control.&nbsp; Yesterday after camp I met Mark, Andrea, (Andrea's sister) April, and Miss C at Tooties for icecream.&nbsp; That was fun.&nbsp; It always is a good time when we all get together.&nbsp; I'm gonna miss those guys.&nbsp; I'm not going to get into that though because it's another post all in itself.&nbsp; I saw the Notebook on Monday.&nbsp; It was really good.&nbsp; I didn't cry but everyone else did.&nbsp; We went to the 10:35 show because it was the only one I could make because of work.&nbsp; I didn't get home until 1:15.&nbsp; It was crazy, I was so tired for camp but it was worth it.&nbsp; I have to get going to camp now so......... later

      haven't updated in a long time... I'm sry for that... so here I go....   High school for me is officially over. First 2 weeks of summer I basically did nothing.  Went to the beach twice that was it.  Then I started working.  I work at Lucille Roberts babysitting.  It's not bad.  I also started working a basketball camp for Coach Johnson.  That's interesting.  Last week was little girls (35 of them, not too bad- I had the youngest and I swear my team was special ed or something... it was horrible) Now this week is boys.  (80 of them! it's nuts- I have the lil ones again... it's ok... we'll see how this goes) that runs 8:30-3 so then I go home have a little break and go right to work monday-thursday. Just got back last night from orientation.  That was a lot of fun.  Met some really cool people. I'm ready to go!! Mom and I also drove around and saw a lot of the area... that was cool.  Also got my official schedule.  :-) I have Friday's off- oh yes, be jealous... be very jealous... other than that nothing's going on... IM me if you want to talk..... later
