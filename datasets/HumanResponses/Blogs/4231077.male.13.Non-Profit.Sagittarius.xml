      After picking up Tabors presents this morning ( I call them presents because he saves them up to give to me when its my turn to scoop -my dog loves me!), I had a very good idea...  I need a Cam, right?. Well Mom won't give our old one back (I dont think she has it anymore -we looked) and this atari-crap camera that I got from a friend of Erics is useless (way too old). I worked on it all day agin... freeze and crash city. Since Im not 100% sure that my mom isn't still reading my blog-here's the idea: I take  HER CC #  and I just order a Cam via internet from Fry's and pick it up @ will call. If she reads this, then I got no new cam anyway (and for life, Im sure), but I  bust her  for sneaking again (into my dirty underworld) were moms ought-not go. If she doesn't read this I'm secure in my privacy  AND  I get a new Eye for my Boob Patrol. Looks like a win-win to me!! :)      ...good idea, right? Just one little problem though...  I CAN'T DO THAT TO MY MOM!!!!  The only bad thing about a good idea is that they sometimes work. Shit!Shit!Shit!Shit!Shit! (btw-the weenie wag today, was really only a wiener..I sould be  that  proud!)  Come visit My Cam: urlLink Boob Patrolers  My Website:  urlLink Arby's Favorite Website!

      I need my cam back! NOW!! -I can't help that your son is a perv..er...the other son, of course (hehe). What happened to all that crap about "greatness in communication"?? This is an important part of my connection to the world-my system to a means (thank you mr. thesaurus). You could be stifling something great here. Do ya want that on your head, well, do ya?!! -I feel a whine coming on, so let's be adults about this...give it back!!Please.  Now .. a little privacy please -don't come back here any more. I luv you.

I have this one                                                                                   ----------->  It not out just yet but it will be called  HALO 2   -I'll remind you :-) (btw, did you notice no 'potty-mouth' words!! -huh, da-ya!?)

I still have a lot of shopping to do. Got some stuff -but nothing very good. well one good shirt I like. Some lame boxers, nothing soxs...stuff like that. I need a cell phone, or at least an IPOD. Im really nervous- im chopp'n my nails again so my hand look like hell and I got this rash thing on my forhead. I'll be starting El Camino Real Senior High School and theres something flying around in here! ...moth, okay(do they carry West Nile??). Thats 'Real' as in  not fake ..I guess.

      Full of chicken and rice, that is. a personal favorite. Remembered what I was thinking of earlier: We might go Barge fishing this weekend with my Dad and his friend from work -not real sure if its a plan, though. Didnt play hockey-but did board a little at the mall in the parking garage across from Nortrums. Cracked my knee on a pole but it feels better now. Gonna go and shower, then watch some TV -later

I really love those mcflurrys-yummers! Going to grab the blade and kart over to Erics house. We might play hockey later if its not too hot. Air Conditioning is finally fixed-woooh! Not too soon either. Gave Tabor a bath earlier. He ate the hose and we had a tugAwar. My dog is so cool. Oh well things to do. Ill probably remember after Im out the door now -later.
