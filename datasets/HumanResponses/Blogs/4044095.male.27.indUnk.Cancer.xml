      so here i am at my parents house, waiting for the terrible twosome to arrive by giant metal bird. i have no idea what airline they are using, so i'm sending a psychic message to them on the plane, er... bird, to call and let me know. otherwise, i stand just inside the terminal, not a good word in an airport by the way, randomly screaming thier names. one step closer to arrest. ah well, soon they'll be here with a story&nbsp;to tell, and then i'll be there with a limited amount of money and no job. if you could see inside my head right now, i'd be laughing maniacally. and bleeding.

      this will ,sadly, be my last movie night in yon midwest. we just watched the birdcage, and will soon comence on the divine road through BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA. one of the best films ever... that is not a lie. we were having an arguement about the best lines throughout the movie. it's between "sonnuvah bitch must pay!", "that big oaf slams your favorite head up against a brick wall, and asks you, 'have you paid your dues, jack?'"&nbsp; and, "we really shook the pillars of heaven didn't we, wang?". i prefer the latter, peet is a freak for the first. you never know... do you?

      strange things are afoot. with the insurgence of society on my quiet little world, i've come to know new things, meet new people. some large and imposing but quite jovial. others smaller, quiet natured, with random outbursts of amazing absurdity. of the former, i'm pleased as punch to associate with. the reigndeer games offer a wonderful acceptance to me. but the latter, oh my little darlings, the latter has me flabbergasted. i spend a lot of time here staring off. down unknown streets and dark alleys. up impossible hills, trying to slice through fog to what can only be utopia beyond my line of sight. but now i find myself staring at a more terrestrial being. watching with strangled eyes, squinting for fear of loosing one of these precious orbs. i babble in bursts of history, personal and world, and fidget. "am i sweating?" i ask myself constantly. i still wear the same pair of pants for three days straight, i still sleep close to the wall, i still wake up like a bear, grubling and growling at the first people i see as i walk to the bathroom in my invader zim boxers, and i still chew my nails incessantly. and yet, everything feels... odd. good odd. delightfully odd. standing on my desk and making fun of the teacher odd.  like i'm winning odd . anyway, the universe is returning to my calloused fingertips, and it has bright blue hair...

      oh dear friends, the lexicon show was a BLAST! everything i wanted it to be and more. so fun. great time, lots of cool people, and good, good music. i'll be helping out at the show next month, doing door, or something, so i'll get to enjoy it again, immensely... on a stranger note, ren and i got dragged out to a BEAR street fair. for those of you not in the know, bears are guys who are and dig other hairy big guys. interesting times for a small dago such as myself. ah well, life is something that must be experienced. or at least watched from afar, like a zoo... noodge.

      yes thats right, a 30 foot long giant squid was caught or dragged up off the coast of the canary island in spain. will the sunken city of r'lyeh be next discovered? hurricane charley? friday the 13th? are these the signs? only nyarlithotep and the fist of azathoth can be sure... okay, back to reality... got up and helped gib, my roommate, put up the stage for the lexicon show tonight. good to learn the ins and outs of the club a bit more. since i seem to have been dropped into the ensign position around there. pretty much my "job" is running random small errands like getting shots for the doormen and finding so-and-so for some other so-and-so to talk to... you know, like gopher on the love boat. whatever, anyway i can't wait for the show, its going to be really friggen cool, and ren says he's gonna jump up on stage in a green bunny suit for the magical mr. lexicon song "shit tunnel". sorry mom... still waiting for the call from the kitchen spot, but i'm patient... smootches to all, -dom

      ...but it sure is handy in a knife fight. yuppers, it looks like the kid really does stay in the picture. cut my hair today. it was buzzed around the sides and back, as per the usual, and today i got a bug up my butt and cut all the stragglers on top in half. clean and ready for action. looks like a bit of video news for vox machina, in the next three weeks we'll be shooting around the frisky, and cameoing the crap out of it. just a bunch of the locals, some celebrity like lexicon, and the kids from the neighborhood. pre-production right now, more when it happens... look for me when it comes out. i'll be there. mr. lexicon show on saturday. gonna be GOOD... hopefully i won't be stuck in the kitchen at the Pound till after saturday... pray for me. boggely boo, -dom

      it is wednesday. where are you right now? on a bus in mpls? on the bart? san frisky is strange and new and wonderful and still strange. no doubledecker bicycles, no winter coats, no peet or o-draws or daniel or keegs. i see everything like an anthropologist/quantum physicist/new born. it's all new and bright, different. not scary different... wild, fascinating different. mad scientist, controlling the world thanks to the power of steam, different. i feel clear. clean. awake and alert. i'm soaking up all of the information like some sort of monstrous behemoth sponge or hard drive. sifting, constantly sifting through it all. adapting. being aware feels really good. thank you.

      so here's the deal. it looks like i might get hooked up with a job at one of the local watering holes/nightclubs, but it will be in the kitchen. i desperately don't want to cook, but it'll be a really good chance to get in the door. working at some of these places would be rad, and there are a few of them. i would really like to get in at the door somewhere. just i.d. people and chill out, but if cooking is gonna get me there, i'll do it. i'm also gonna go to borders. i got an application from them, and will send shortly. i don't really want to work there, but it'll pay the bills. and i got the skills, sorta... other than that, i had my first meeting with the other gentlemen of PARAPHAN, and it went very nicely. i knew two of the three already, and had met the other guy briefly, but never sat down with all of them. we're promoting a show at KEMO'S for Vox Machina and  urlLink Mr. Lexicon  next month, it should be friggen cool. small company, small times. other than that, i have been having a great time out partying with the roommates, scaring the women folk, and generally causing a bit of havoc upon this fine california city. i love my life. noodge.

      well, here i am, and now i need a job. i still got a bit of scratch left, but i think it would be a good idea to get started soon. i think i have an interim thing working the door at a local bar, one of the notorios three roomies tends there, but it will be random and in between, and under the radar if you know what i'm sayin'... i gotta get the cash flowing, ramen does not agree with me for very long. flyered on haight for the label today, gonna sell cd's on market tomarrow, keep the blood pumping, and the legs moving. yup, even without a j o b things are definately looking up. for you kids in mpls, i miss you, love you, and i hope to see you soon. everybody else gotta wait in line...

      so when i got here i have to admit, the idea was starting to scare me. you know, the same old, "i'm here in a strange place, i only know like three people, and i have no idea where i am." thing. but as of last night, i met a crapload of really cool kats. its insane how quickly all that anxiety flips over on itself. i am a happy little dago.

      so there was this boy, and this boy wanted to move to San Franciso. he mailed away all of his little life in a series of 37 little boxes, and got on a plane. the plane was supposed to go to Phoenix,but the airline, in thier infinite wisdom decided not to got there. instead, they sent the boy on a much worse flight to Las Vegas. this flight was supposed to get to the airport so the boy could get on another plane, a creation that struck deadly fear in the heart of the boy, and finish the trail to San Francisco. but alas, Odin, Shiva and the almighty Jesus seemed against the boy from the beginning. he was delayed in Vegas and forced to spend the night in a plush, posh downtown hotel meeting a white guy bhuddist, an army soldier just back from Iraq, and a Pot head real estate agent from Utah. when morning came, and much fun was forgot, the boy got on another deathtrap, er, plane and flew off towards the western state to spend the rest of the day opening presents, and sleeping, which would soon become the rest of his life. the end.
