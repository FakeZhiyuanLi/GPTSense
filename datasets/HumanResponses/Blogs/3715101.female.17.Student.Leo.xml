      Her blue eyes would watch As people passed her by. She could read their emotions, But they were unaware that this beautiful girl Should have a problem of her own. For years she was abused, And her mind was at war. Through her eyes you could see her soul, Tormented.  Sitting on the broken wooden bench, She would contemplate for hours, The severity of her pain. One time, I remember, she lifted her sleeve, And gasped as she saw her arm, A mass of cuts and scars, A war zone.  People walked by, never stopping, Not even when she cried. Her best efforts went into silencing her sobs, She didnâ€™t succeed. She passed a window on her way home, And stared in at herself, The reflection was me.

      This is how you have left me. I have no reason anymore, No reason to remove myself From this darkened pit.  You had chances, and many, But I just don't have the patience To sit, sit and wait for nothing, Nothing at all.  Contrary to belief, I am not happy, Nor am I lament with greif. Beneath such facades I feel... Like an emotionless void.

      Im not romantic.  romance is like as different from me as anything opposite could be.  Maybe they do romance courses at college.  *ponders* I should be romantic and thoughtful and all roses and love and hearts and shiney things, but I must have missed obtaining that gene, take after mother then.  "Loaded, I've loaded up this gun, there's a killer in me, hoping you're the one, but you always run away when I come around, I dont mind the day, I'll track you down, and TERRIFY"  Liking that song at the moment, a lot.  Suave voice, for a guy that is.  Seeta has a suave voice, she has a gig on saturday however Im not going.  My plans for this weekend so far: Friday - nothing Saturday - nothing Sunday - KD come here (no choice) and stay over Monday - "period pains" No school.  Apart from that I have work, but not too much, so Im worried about the amount I will get next year when we have to rush through the course, not that I am complaining!  Holiday in 2 weeks and 3 days!  whooo. JD

      Wow.  Two posts in one day.  This will never happen again.  Isn't it amazing how things can change totally the other way round and when a day starts of bad it can end up good.  I made friends with them (elephant juice), I'm allowed to go to Leeds fest.  No news on the house, and Joss is going as of tomorrow (fingers crossed).  And Im happy.  I finished my work.  I played a game today hah yea im sad, where you have to name all the things you love.  I love my friends who tell me what is right instead of what I want to hear.  I love potential adventures and I love people who demand me to be my best because they know I can do better things than what I am doing.  Mainly, I love my friends... in a friendship way :P:P:P

      Well, probably not the BEST day ever to start a blog.  I feel down.  Like really down.  Although my problems are not even significant in comparrison to those of the rest of the world, and although I have a lot going for me, everything seems wrong.  I dont like the constant invasion of privacy.  I dont want secrets, I want confidentiality.  I want to be able to say something without it all backfiring.  I want to go to Leeds fest, I want to move house and I want Joss to go.  Basically for the last 3 points, I want my mother to stop taking the easy option.  But then again, its not all bad, it can't be.  I'm going to Paris on Tuesday with the people who dont understand not to shout how Im feeling to the world.  Then I'm going to an interview at Oxford on the Thursday, and I dont know what to do.  All good.  All shiney.  All smiles.  All the time.  JD

      I'll just run through:  Monday - school, Joe, Ben n Seeta came here, was fun.  Food *mmm*.  Slept at Seet'as, late night, early morning, but again fun :)  Tuesday - Paris.  Was quite good, made me want to go back so I can look round my way.  5th wheel - in a non conventional way, which wasnt so good but proved some things to me.  Wednesday - School, SACRE - which was quite good, some good contacts from there  Thursday - Oxford.  Very good, I'm impressed.  I love the city and the university and Im definately going to apply!  I was on my own most of the day but it was still very good, I managed to saunter sufficiently, get lost and go to bed at  9 - just what I needed.  The other theology candidtaes are so well informed, well read and clever - *decides to read more* - where can I find the time?  Friday - Home.  Yay.  No plans!  I need a day off LOL.  Got caught in the terrential rain and my feet are wet but all else is shiney.  Madam Wolfie shall be adjoining me at the hip on Tuesday, which shall be good also, fun and she drinks the same drink as me from starbucks, which, considering the range is relatively spooky.  Anyway - bored now :P JD
