          NEW JUGGLIN RELEASES!    Out now:  Artist: Linn Title: Available (+ Rasmus Faber & Hearin’ Aid Remixes) Cat#: JUGG002 Format: 12inch  Believe it or not but for the last years there’s been a rising soul movement emerging in Stockholm. With high quality artists, songwriters and producers like Salem, Melo, Freddie Cruger, André and Linn Stockholm finally have music that can match the beats from the US or UK. One of the strongest voices from Stockholm is singer and songwriter Linn. Even though she haven’t got any of her own material officially released so far she’s already recorded tracks with big name soul producers like James Poyser, Steve Harvey, Don E and Freddie Cruger.  On her single debut she’s coming down with a smooth boogie stepper produced by UK soul head Don-E. If you were down with the sounds of Loose Ends in the late 80s this will surely catch your ears. On remix duties we find a jazzy &amp; soulful house mix by man of the moment Rasmus Faber which is already played by some of the main US and UK house heads. But for those of you that dig your beats dirtier we also got a deep hip hop/soul remix by upcoming Stockholm crew Hearin’ Aid. Be on the lookout for a Hearin’ Aid 12” right here on Jugglin’ Records later this year. These cats got some seriously f***** up beats in their baggage. Believe that!  Tracklisting: A1. Available (Original) A2. Available (Hearin’ Aid Remix) B1. Available (Rasmus Faber Remix)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Out in August:  Artist: Freddie Cruger Feat. Rapadon Title: Bap You Head (+ Up Hygh Remix) / Boogie Down Stureby Cat#: JUGG003 Format: 12inch Release Date: July / August 2004  Wohaaaa…the new Freddie Cruger joint his finally here and its supa hot! After the success with his first 12” on Jugglin’ (Running From Love / The Hustle) he’s now back together with Brooklyn MC Rapadon for a mega funky hip hop score which will blow up your DJ set. To spice it up a little extra there’s also a baaad (!) remix by Stockholm wonder kids Up Hygh that will please fans of the Pete Rock, J-Dilla and Madlib sounds. Yes, it’s that hot!!  But it’s on the flip where we’ll find the true winner. Boogie Down Stureby is nothing less but a 100% dancefloor mash-up! Imagine a slice of Lalo Schiffrin themes, mix it up with some fierce jazz-funk rhythms plus add some b-boy mentality and your almost there. Good peeps like Danny Krivit, Bobbito and Patrik Forge are just a few of the cats that have been spinning the hot in demand promos. Nuff heads was turning when this got dropped at Bobbitos weekly party at the Apartment in NYC a couple of weeks ago.  Tracklisting: A1. Bap Yo Head (Orig) A2. Bap Yo Head (Up Hygh Remix) B1. Boogie Down Stureby B2. Bap Yo Head (Instr)          NEW RAW FUSION RELEASES    A BOSSA ELÉTRICA - ELETRIFICAÇÃO CD/LP (RAFCD/LP002) On May 17th we are finally releasing the debut album by A Bossa Elétrica (2xLP). The CD release will be out on June 1st. Expect everything from fierce sambas, swinging bossa burners but also a some more melodic compositions from this truly electric 6 piece orchestra from southern Sweden. Btw, they are bangin live as well!  A BOSSA ELÉTRICA – VEJA O SOL, SPIRITUAL SOUTH REMIX 12” (RAF012) After their world-renowned samba smash ”Tombo In 7/4” this south Swedish Brazilian outfit is yet again ready to burn up dance-floors across the globe. Their first single is a self written composition which initially heads into deep MPB territory but gradually picks up pace and later explodes when the mighty chorus drops. But to insure maximum floor action we let the south London Brazil nuts Spiritual South go loose on the track. The result is a devastating mash up of funky samba, uplifting house rhythms and rough wobble bass action. Peak time pressure guaranteed!  12th FLOOR - DONT THIS BLOW YOUR MIND, DMALICIAOUS DUB 12" (RAF013) Yep, 12th Floor is back again and this time we got a killer raregroove burner with a dirty Detroit feel that will do exactly what the title suggests...blow your mind! Theres also a cool DMalicious (Wave Rec) dub that goes even further on the elecctronic path...especially check the 4/4 break halfway in to the track. Should be hitting the shops sometime in mid June.  BEATFANATIC - ADVENTURES IN THE WORLD OF NO-FI BEATS 2xLP (RAFLP005) If you got hooked on the sounds of Jogando Capoeira or Electromagnetic Colours you wont be disspointed with his debut album. Not only do you get loads of brand new Beatfanatic tracks but also exclusive versions of some of the old jams which is only available on this double LP. Of the new tracks you should especially check out tunes like Deep Love and Mas Que Malandro wich is already played by some of the main DJ celebrities.  DAMN! - YOUTH STYLE CD + 2xLP (RAFCD/LP003) With the huge success of 12inches like Leaving This Planet and African Scanian selling around 3000 units each they are now ready to drop their debut album Youth Style. With a seriously diverse musical selection youll find everything from blue eyed soul, latin, afro-funk, rock and even electronic rhythms on the album. But even though it might sound shattered the album holds a strong identity which we think will convince any listeners. On the album you will also find the crossover Got To Go single which so far is only released as a CD single in Scandinavia. Its already cliimbing the pop charts and is getting both radio and video play all over Scnadinavia. Btw, damn! is an amazing live band as well! This was proven when they performed live at the Raw Fusion club in April where they almost blew the roof off the club.    urlLink  http://www.rawfusionrec.com/          elsewhere on the web:   urlLink  http://www.rawfusion.se/

      A journey through Joseph's musical kaleidoscope! 2002 was a great year for Joseph Malik, with his first album on Compost "Diverse" receiving worldwide acclaim and it´s been since then, that he´s enjoying the reputation of being one of the most foremost singer songwriters of his generation. After 10 months of being locked in the studio with his producer David Donnelly and co-producers Steven Christie & Grand Unified, Joseph has produced an incredible album that reflects more on his club side. Whereas "Diverse" focused on chill out, summer guitar chords & more melancholic tones,focuses more on uptempo songs, strong political ideologies (e.g. as heard on "Race Relations" - exclusive live recording!) & social awareness of the world around him, while still blending in the beautiful lush chords with the help of string orchestra & horn sections to produce the finest album of his career.Starting with the title track "Aquarius Song" where Malik goes "Big Band"! Along with the main producers, there are also some hugely talented people who guest on this album: Steven Christie's collaboration with Joseph - "Casualties of War" is a heartfelt anti war song blending the musical styles of Brian Wilson & Stevie Wonder. Grand Unified produced the track "Dream Dancer" - a perfect love song for the dancefloor and fellow Edinburgh DJ & producer Aqua Bassino to sing with him on the track "Believe & See", a homage to New York House with a touch of Blondie. The first single from the album is "Diablo" (the road to Seville) - a dark spanish tango breakbeat track dedicated to the journey of Malik´s football team, Glasgow Celtic, as they progressed through Europe to the UEFA Cup final in Seville. This is real. Can you get down with that?  01. AQUARIUS SONG 02. DIABLO 03. SILENT FOOLS 04. NEBULA 05. DREAM DANCER 06. BELIEVE & SEE 07. MISTRESS MOONLIGHT 08. CASUALTIES OF WAR 09. RACE RELATIONS (LIVE)      urlLink  http://www.www.compost-rec.com

      DKD are Dego (4hero), Kaidi Tatham (Bugz in the Attic) and Daz-I-Kue (Bugz in the Attic). ‘Future Rage’ was a project conceived by pure chance, Dego came round to the the Bugz studio, Daz had a beat running, Kaidi was fiddling with some keyboards, Dego jumped on laid down a bassline and within a few hours the single ‘Future Rage’ was recorded. From there a whole album was produced comprised of forward thinking soul music, dancefloor bullets, supreme musicianship and top-drawer production that all comes together to form the most anticipated record to come from the Bugz camp or Dego for a long time.   The album also features the sublime talents of Bembe Segue who needs no introduction, Lady Alma from ‘Hold It Down’, Face from 4hero, a young soul singer called Rasiyah whose name we’ll be hearing a lot more from soon, and Motet from London crew Uprock.   ‘Getaway’ re-unites the team behind 4hero’s anthem ‘Hold It Down’, Dego and Lady Alma. Written by Dego and Kaidi with another killer chorus hook, and delivered immaculately by Alma with her trademark flow and husky tones.   The first of Rasiyah’s two appearances on the album, ‘Brighter Day’ provides her with a lead vocal which she delivers wonderfully over a laid back downtempo soul track.   ‘You Know It’ has been the song that a lot of early listeners have been freaking out over. Vocals written and performed by Bembe Segue, this is simply a great song with an infectious chorus and a killer bridge underpinned by a brilliantly simple mid-tempo groove.   ‘No Time’ is Kaidi’s solo moment on the album and it’s a beautiful piece of musicianship and composition, all instruments live and played by Kaidi.   The 1st single from the album, ‘Future Rage’ should need no intro but for those that don’t know it this is the slice of 21st Century Boogie that’s been destroying dancefloors all over the place for over a year and still refuses to lie down. It features Face, Dego and Kaidi on vocals. 'Natty Head’ is an intense keyboard-led affair with Rasiyah providing backing vocals this time. Another durty electronic dancefloor bullet, ‘Super Amazing’ sees Face deliver an outrageously optimistic and memorable vocal over a distinctly different groove.   ‘Breakers Yard’ is predominantly a keyboard work-out with Kaidi and Dego going for it on all manner of synths and Rhodes over a brilliant percussive, broken rhythm. Also features flute from Kaidi.   ’Look Who’s Talking’ is a jerky, slightly awkward slice of bruk hip-hop featuring Motet, either love it or hate it.      urlLink  http://www.goyamusic.com

      Macaco/Mr President  The fourth release on Osunlade's Yoruba label is a serious bit of tribal business. Deep-as-you-like, multi-layered percussive house with some gorgeous synth washes and chord stabs. Flip for an equally deep, four-down cut with some provocative spoken word activity.

       "Included on Simply Good Music Vol. 1, is "Bandy Bandy," a recently released Giant Step Records single by Zap Mama. Lead by the talented siren Marie Daulne, the group teamed up with neo-soul singer Erykah Badu to create the cut and the whole track got a fierce dance hall reconstruction from Detroit legend Carl Craig. U.K. premiere hip-hop artist Roots Manuva delivers "The Haunting:" a never-before released track (until now), while Esthero's "O.G. Bitch" is culled from her long awaited yet-to-be-released sophomore record.Another gem on Simply Good Music Vol. 1 that is worth the cost of the compilation alone is "We Can Make It" by DKD featuring Giant Step favorite son and now Motown recording artist Donnie. Previously available as a Japan-only import, DKD is the broken beat supergroup consisting of Dego of 4 Hero, Daz I Kue, the elusive engineer of West London collective Bugz in the Attic along with Kaidi Tatham a.k.a. Giant Step Records artist Agent K, also a member of the Bugz crew." - giantstep.net       urlLink  http://www.giantstep.net/

      Theme for a Broken Soul: a hazy, funky collection of hip-hop inspired,  futuristic instrumentals from the mind of the reclusive desert-dwelling DJ  Rels. With this new album, executive produced by the one and only Madlib,  Rels is opening up new doors for a hip hop label with progressive dance  music that draws from both the jazzier and more visceral facets of the  Stones Throw tradition. A unique project that is pensive and reflective, yet  energetic and danceable at the same time.   THEME FOR A BROKEN SOUL  1. Don't U Know 5:13  2. Sunrise 5:57  3. Broken Soul/Dawn 9:07  4.

       Batacumbele - Yoruba language meaning "to kneel before the drum". Founded in 1980 in San Juan, Puerto Rico by Master percussionist Angel "Cachete" Maldonado, Batacumbele is one of the leading Afro Caribbean ensembles in the world. It is to contemporary Puerto Rican music what Irakere is to Cuba. Known as a progressively innovative ensemble that respects tradition, Batacumbele excites audiences by fusing genres such as Afro Cuban salsa & jazz with African and Caribbean (Puerto Rican) folkloric polyrhythms. The combination of world-class virtuoso musicians and superb vocalists along with great compositions and arrangements result in a unique package that has garnered a cult following in Japan, Europe, South America, the greater Antilles &amp; Caribbean and the United States. (Alumni of Batacumbele include: David Sanchez, Papo Vazquez, Charlie Sepulveda, William Cepeda, Nestor Torres, Cuban drummer Ignacio Berroa, John Benitez, Richie Flores, Eric Figueroa, et. al).   urlLink  http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FXV/is_10_13/ai_112020458

       Massive grooves from one of our favorite slices of Brazilian music -- the landmark work recorded by the EMI/Odeon label at the end of the 60s and start of the 70s! Some of the Odeon groove's been made famous in recent years by the excellent Blue Brazil series -- and this set follows in a similar mode -- taking strands of post-bossa culture and weaving it into a tremendous set of tracks that span the gamut through jazz, funk, soul, bossa, and baroque vocal pop! The package features 20 tracks in all, and is a wonderful introduction to the larger series of reissues mounted by EMI in Brazil in recent years -- which means that if you like the tracks on this set, you can hurry up and track down the full albums while they're still on the market! Titles include "Rua Maluca" by Eduardo Araujo, "Me Libertei" by Toni Tornado, "A Ra" by Joao Donato, "Na Baixa&nbsp;do Sapateiro" by Wilson Simonal, "Jungle" by Som Tres, "Vou Pular Neste Carnaval" by Eliana Pittman, "Madalena" by Tania Maria, "Brazzaville" by Wilson Das Neves, "Tudo Que Voce Podia Ser" by Quarteto Em Cy, and "Mentira" by Marcos Valle.        urlLink http://www.juno.co.uk/IP/IF151445-02.htm

       "The arrival of acid jazz and funky jam band music on the scene has renewed interest in some of Bartz’s 70s fusion work, and culturally aware hip-hop groups such as A Tribe Called Quest have sampled these albums quite a bit. For the jazz enthusiast, it is probably his early records as a leader and his work with Ntu Troop that will prove most interesting, and folks interested in hearing some vital, inventive music from an astute musical mind will derive a great deal of pleasure from them. Bartz should be one of the most recognizable figures in post-1960s jazz, but his interest in playing beyond the confines of what saxophonist Courtney Pine has called ‘the jazz room’ effectively derailed his career for a time—proof positive that rewriting jazz history to suit an ulterior agenda is dangerous business."&nbsp; - jazzitude.com    &nbsp;  urlLink  http://www.jazzitude.com/gary_bartz.htm    .   urlLink  http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:jsrb282c05ja~T1    .   urlLink  http://garybartz.com/

        Taken from The African-American Registry      &nbsp;  Born on October 31, 1922 in Boussard, Louisiana, Jean Baptiste Jacquet and grew up in Houston, Texas. There he played in a band with his older brother, Russell, and worked in several bands around town before moving to Los Angeles in 1941. In L.A., he joined Hampton's big band. Jacquet wrote his signature on jazz immortality in 1942. Then, as a 19-year-old member of Lionel Hampton's big band, he played an incredible solo on Hampton's "Flying Home."   He has virtually built a career on that solo, which he claims, came from divine inspiration; it ranks as one of the best improvisational performances in the 20th century. His raw-boned tenor sound combining R&amp;B boldness and jazz sophistication is his trademark. He performed in the Jazz At The Philharmonic series, appeared in the jazz documentary, Jammin' The Blues and in 1945 formed his own band. From the '50s to the present, Jacquet has recorded for many labels including Savoy, RCA, Mercury, Epic, and Atlantic.   Continuing performing on jazz recordings into the 1990s, he was a guest on the Modern Jazz Quartet's 1994 album A Celebration. As he explained in the closing statement of a 1988 Jazz Times interview, "With this kind of music you don't get old, because it takes 50 years to learn how to play it. I don't expect to retire."   Into the 21st century, Jacquet led one of the swingingest big bands on the scene and performed with the same intensity that marked his ascendancy more than 50 years ago. Illinois Jacquet died on July 21

       Barak/Capitol, 2004    &nbsp;  "Slum Village returns with their most rugged album ever! The Slum still hasn't duplicated the particularly groovy style of the classic Fantastic, Vol 2, and to be honest, the crew is really the same in name only. The line-up has changed little-by-little with each album, and the Detroit Deli Slum has the act paired down to the duo of T3 and Baatin. Against the odds, the album works -- with an overall stronger presentation than the previous Trinity album (one that we admired more than we actually enjoyed), with some grimy, crackly beats and production, more confrontational rhymes than you'd expect from Slum Village, plus a couple of strong collaborations with fellow Detroit native Dwele. Tracks include "Zoom", "Do You", "Dirty" featuring Dirt McGirt, "Selfish" with Kanye West, "Closer" featuring Dwele, "Old Girl/Shining Star", "Keep Holding Tight", "It's On", "The Hours", "Things We Know", "Counting The Ways" with Dwele and "Reunion" featuring Dilla." - dustygroove.com       urlLink http://www.slumvillage.com/

       Ultra Vybe (Japan)     &nbsp;   "A fantastic compilation of Japanese jazz tunes from the 70s - compiled by United Future Organization's Raphael Sebbag! This is another in the increasingly great Shibuya Jazz Classics series -- curated by the producers/performers/DJs from the modern scene -- and this could be the best one yet! Raphael collects some of the greatest Latin jazz-inspired tunes from the scene, most of which are astonishingly strong! The tunes all have Latin elements, but there's not a textbook style in any case. The groove is ever expansive, with dexterous playing throughout. The rhythm's are beautifully, frenetically percussive, and the spiritual soul jazz vibe is in full effect. Pure greatness! Tracks include "A Wind From Spain" by Carioca, "Spanish Flower" by Nasaru Imada Trio, "Soul Tomato", by Miyasaka Takashi Quintet, "Mystic Heart" by Marty Bracey, "Dragon Dance" by Makoto Terashita &amp; Harold Land, "Peace Of Ground" by Zenzile featuring Marion Brown, "Latino Suite" by McCoy Tyner and more." - dustygroove.com       urlLink  http://www.ultra-vybe.co.jp/

       "A collection of soul prodigy Alice Russell's best tracks to date, including cuts done with the Quantic Soul Orchestra, TM Duke and Natureboy. Gritty, funky blues-powered music that manages to be both modern and classic thanks to her exceptional voice and delivery." - tunes.co.uk     Alice Russell possesses a voice of such raw beauty and masterful control that she is instantly able to captivate her audience. Through collaborations with many of today’s brightest bands and producers she has earned herself a reputation as one of the UK’s most promising and engaging vocalists.Having grown up in a musical environment, Alice began singing in choirs from an early age. This classical background was enriched by her love of soul music from 1970’s Black America, which has consequently greatly inspired her songwriting and harmonic style. Despite her primary influence being the music of times past, Alice’s own music is very much of the present.Aside from her studio work, Miss Russell truly excels when she’s standing in front of a live band. She has performed to worldwide audiences with Bah Samba and captured the hearts and imaginations of many with The Quantic Soul Orchestra, an eleven-piece heavy funk band where Alice gets a chance to unleash her awesome talent and shine as one of the first ladies of contemporary UK soul. This title should be assured with her new outfit The Alice Russell Band. Backed by a group of accomplished musicians, Alice performs a collection of her favourite songs that draw from both her collaborative and solo work.In a similar way, the Tru Thoughts release “Under The Munka Moon” is a collection of Miss Russell’s finest recordings to date. To highlight a few tracks; “Hurry On Now” is an authentic slice of classic soul, impeccably produced by TM Juke where “Sweet Is The Air” is delightful acoustic outing with Nature Boy. The chanteuse’s work with Quantic and the Q.S.O is represented with a number of tunes which appear for the first time on CD, remixed by the likes of At Jazz (Mantis) and Digitek (Zebra Traffic), as well as a track specifically produced by Quantic for this album.        urlLink  http://www.tru-thoughts.co.uk/?page=records/release.html&amp;id=95

      This is the debut album from Troubleman AKA Mark Pritchard (Jedi Knights, Global Communication, Harmonic 33), and I reckon it's set to be a future nu-latin classic! He presents us with a selection of sweet home listening acoustic mellowness and 60s inspired easy-bossa ("Paz", Lonely Girl", "Toda Hora" etc) set against the tougher, upbeat dancefloor slayers ("Change Is What We Need" and CD only "Strikehard"). Guest vocals come from Da Lata's Nina Miranda, Eska and Steve Spacek.

        Ghana Soundz     &nbsp;  Ghana Soundz was an idea first hatched 3 years ago by compiler and DJ Miles Cleret. Since then he has painstakingly travelled the length and breadth of Ghana to assemble three collections of rare Afro-beat, Afro-funk and Afro-fusion, most of which has never been released outside of Africa and some of which is unreleased anywhere. The musicians and producers have been tracked down, licenses gained, and the information, notes and history pieced together. These albums form a unique window on a scene previously unknown outside of Ghana until Volume One was released. Pounding rhythms, blaring horns and pumping vocals – the music is a document of a time forgotten when flares and Cuban heels strutted the streets and night-spots of Accra, the sizzlingly hot and humid capital of Ghana. Influenced as much by traditional rhythms and local highlife as by the music of Fela Kuti, James Brown and Santana, these tunes had almost become extinct – until now!    &nbsp;   Ghana Soundz 2     &nbsp;  Following the success of last years Ghana Soundz Volume One, Soundway are happy to announce the long awaited Volume Two. The wait has been due to the fact that this is not simply any old compilation but one that has taken a lot of time, passion and energy to compile, plus another visit to Ghana to boot.       urlLink  http://www.soundwayrecords.com/

       From the Republic of Benin, West Africa, The Orchestre Poly-Rythmo are one of Africa’s least-known big-bands outside of their home country. Here we hope to redress the balance with a collection that reflects their many poly-rhythmic moods. A mixture of hard Afro-funk, driving Afro-beat, deep Afro-latin and Cuban grooves all with a unique flavour that ruled the dance-floors of 70’s urban Benin.   urlLink  http://www.soundwayrecords.com/

       While Quincy Jones and Bill Cosby are today considered two of the most accomplished entertainers in America, the 52-episodes of NBC’s “The Bill Cosby Show” (1969-1971) were among their first notable television credits. Jones, as musical director, assembled a crack team of prominent jazz and funk artists to create a soundtrack and essentially left the tape recorder running during numerous informal jams. The sessions, however, ended up in the vault and were forgotten until over 30 years later when the “lost tapes” were rediscovered during an office move. Quincy Jones Music and Concord Records now present those sessions on two separate, yet equally unique and ultra-cool, recordings.

       "Nigeria in the 1970's had one of the biggest recording industries on the continent as well as one of the most diverse. The fusion of African rhythms and culture with jazz, funk, soul and rock was an Africa-wide phenomenon but nowhere was it more prolific and active than the cities and dancefloors of Nigeria. The twelve rare tracks on this compilation highlight how the Afro-Sound influenced all areas of the music scene and how it progressed throughout a very creative and energetic decade. From funky afro-jazz, soul and afro-highlife to big, dancefloor afro-beat Nigeria led the way in West Africa at the time. Tracklisting: 01. The Sahara Allstars - Alikali Adajo 02.

Weighing in at almost thirteen minutes, 'The Voyage' sees the quartet from Osaka on top of their game as usual, and features the mighty saxophone of Pharoah Saunders on what is one electric piece of spiritual jazz music. 'Into The Sun' is no slouch of a tune either, and has the wonderful Bembe Segue providing the kind of vocal that has made her so often the chanteuse of choice for so many. Basically, if you like jazz, you need this!! " - Store Records Online   urlLink  https://www.storerecords.net/     &nbsp;     "An amazing single -- one that hearkens back to the best spiritual jazz years of the Impulse label! "The Voyage" is an incredibly moving cut -- one that starts out slow, with an evocative solo by Pharoah Sanders -- then kicks it up in a joyous groove that's pure jazz! The flipside's equally great!&nbsp;" - Dusty Groove    urlLink  http://www.dustygroove.com/images/products/s/sleepwalker_voyagefea_101b.jpg

       Masters At Work Present Latin Verve Sounds, is a new collection of some of the classic Latin-flavored songs in the The Verve Music Group's archives.&nbsp; The tracks were chosen by the popular DJ collective of "Little" Louie Vega and Kenny "Dope" Gonzalez, better known as Masters At Work.  The compilation features a wide range of artists, composers, sounds, and grooves.&nbsp; Kicking off with the classic tropical vibe of Dave Pike's "Sandunga," driving through the percussive "Boss Trés Bien" by Quartette Trés Bien, and sliding into Eugene Arango and Carlos "Patato" Valdés' gritty interpretation of Jorge Ben's "Mas Qué Nada," Masters At Work Present Latin Verve Sounds is a vibrant musical journey of Latin jazz rhythms.  "Kenny and I chose the tracks by looking through his vast collection - 30,000 pieces of vinyl," said "Little" Louie Vega.&nbsp; After they chose and sequenced the tunes, Masters At Work played them at some of their eclectic worldwide gigs. "Making sure the songs had a street edge, were dance friendly, and energetic was very important," continued Vega.  Some of selections that round out Masters At Work Present Latin Verve Sounds include a live version of flautist Herbie Mann's "Todos Locos," piano legend George Shearing's take on Duke Ellington's "Caravan," and two from the incomparable pairing of vibist Cal Tjader and Latin jazz king Eddie Palmieri - "Ritmo Uni" and "Picadillo."  One of the artists most highlighted on this set is the late, great Willie Bobo.&nbsp; Vega and Gonzalez picked two of the percussionist's tunes for the compilation - "Roots" and "La Descarga del Bobo."&nbsp; The latter is featured both in its original version and in a modern remix by Masters At Work. (The remix of "La Descarga del Bobo" will be available as a 12" promotional-only vinyl single.)  Says Louie Vega: "Remixing it was not hard because all the elements were already there - hot percussion, a very catchy guitar melody, and a nice build.&nbsp; I'm already shaking dance floors with the remix.&nbsp; Willie Bobo kicked some serious ass with this tune!"   Masters At Work - the appropriately titled team of "Little" Louie Vega and Kenny "Dope" Gonzalez - is one of the most successful producer/remix ensembles working today.&nbsp; For over a decade the duo's inventive production style and unique combination of Hip-House-Jazz style remixes have maintained their reputation as leaders in the world of dance music.&nbsp; Masters At Work continually blends diverse types of music - funk, disco, Latin, African, etc. - into one universal groove.  "Dave Pike, Eddie Palmieri, Cal Tjader, Herbie Mann, Patato, and the others are all our heroes," said Vega.&nbsp; "It was a pleasure being able to unite them all on this one hot disc.&nbsp; They are truly Masters At Work."&nbsp; - Verve Records        urlLink  http://www.vervemusicgroup.com/product.aspx?pid=10967&amp;ob=bf&amp;src=vmg

      bbe  Imagine if Black Thought could sing like D'Angelo and did an album produced by Ali Shaheed Muhammad and DJ Spinna.  That's the unlikely union that makes Foreign Exchange's Connected so special.  Little Brother's PHONTE and Dutch producer NICOLAY connected via the internet, and through a potent mix of battle-ready lyricism, falsetto crooning and European ambient grooves, they create Hip-Hop music from outside the box. Playing double duty as MC and singer, PHONTE transcends flaccid R&B while reconnecting Hip-Hop with exorcised soul. The poetic pendulum swings from the chest-thumping of "Raw Life" and "Let's Move" to the passonate confessions of "Sincere" and "Be Allright", where PHONTE laments: "I scream, 'Fuck the world', but Mother Nature is taking Ortho now/Tryin' to regulate her stress and pain also now." Unfortunately though, you'll probably have to fly to NICOLAY's home country to hear this inspired record on the radio.

       Discotheque (UK)      A massive 49 tracks overview of this legendary hub of Northern Soul.Ian Levine is recognised as the greatest DJ in the halcyon days of Northern Soul - this album features 60s and 70s cuts that would cost many thousands of pounds to buy as singles. Includes: GIL SCOTT-HERON, LAMONT DOZIER, OTIS SMITH, THE MOMENTS, CARRIE LUCAS, LARRY SAUNDERS, BESSIE BANKS and many more.      Ian Levine is the former resident DJ at Blackpool Mecca, a key club in the development of northern soul. Levine was primarily responsible - along with Colin Curtis of guiding northern soul from its oldies-only policy into modern soul and disco. Ian was also resident DJ at Heaven for many years.      "Way way way more than just a simple Northern Soul compilation -- a key document of the shift in sound in the British soul scene of the 70s! The 50-track, 2CD package features tracks broken big by DJ Ian Levine at the landmark Blackpool Mecca nightclub -- an important club in the 70s that helped to shift the sound away from the Motown-based modes of the 60s, into the smoother, tighter modern soul grooves of the 70s. The feel here is wonderful -- a host of upbeat, uptempo 70s soul tracks -- some of them familiar classics, but most of them lost singles that step out with a groove that's completely fresh, and which documents a whole side of 70s soul that still really needs to be brought back even more strongly today! Titles include "Reaching For The Best" by The Exciters, "It Really Hurts Me Today" by The Carstairs, "Cashing In" by Voices Of East Harlem, "I'm So Glad I Found You" by Linda Jones &amp; The Whatnauts, "Hung Up In Mid Air" by David Rhodes, "Your Magic Put A Spell On Me" by LJ Johnson, "I'm Gonna Pick Up My Toys" by The Devonnes, "Going Back To My Roots" by Lamont Dozier, "Don't You Worry Baby" by Bessie Banks, "Never Knew Love Before" by Felix Cavaliereie, "What You Gave Up" by The Continental Four, "Bet You If You Ask Around" by Perception String Orchestra, "It Takes Love" by Delilah Moore, and "Let Her Go" by Otis Smith." - dustygroove.com

       Nascente (UK),       There have been several Latin Jazz compilations in recent years, featuring everything from Brazilian jazz to latin tracks that just aren't based on true jazz at all.

You get seminal numbers by Ray Barretto, Willie Bobo, Bobby Matos and others on the old school 60s tip, tracks by Ella Fitzgerald, Cal Tjader, Cedar Walton and Dave Pike on the jazzier side, and numbers by NuYorican Soul, Snowboy and Roy Hargrove on the more recent side of things, just to name a few of each wave! You get an overall excellent sampler here -- with numbers from each important wave of Latin funk and soul of the past several decades!

       Norman Jay M.B.E. Original Soul Boy, Chopper Boss, Good Times avenger, an inspiration. 2004 sees the re-release of a classic which was sadly hidden from the buying public up until now. Two of the biggest forces in funk join once more in the re-release of an early harmless classic: Philadelphia - The Underground Anthems Of Philadelphia Soul from 1973 - 1981.  As Norman says in his sleeve notes, "The Sound Of Philadelphia (T.S.O.P.) was an integral part of my musical upbringing and still remains vital to me. It was through first hearing the likes of The o'Jays, Harold melvin &amp; The Blue Notes, The Three degrees (Prince Charles favourite group no less) and my favourites M.F.S.B. (Mother Father Sister Brother) that I was drawn to the exciting new sounds emanating from The City Of Brotherly Love, coutesy of the label's two founders and extradordinary gifted songwriters Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff".  This double album features killer cuts by all the greats from the Philadelphia label in its most prolific period. Pay close attention for special launch parties around the country and be sure to check Giant 45 on London Live 94.9FM every Sunday between 7pm and 10pm for Norman playing the real heart and soul of Philadelphia. Harmless ahead of the pack and packing punches....we got the real sound of Philly!       urlLink http://www.demonmusicgroup.co.uk/content/228.chtml

       Sunday 29 - Monday 30, August. 12pm - 7pm   The world's biggest street party celebrates it's 40th anniversary this year.       The theme for this year’s Notting Hill Carnival is Freedom and Justice, in line with its 40th anniversary. Carnivals in every part of the world from the UK to the West Indies and Brazil are united by their history – all were developed under oppression, with those who took part in the celebrations expressing themselves outside of the restraints put upon them and throwing off the dictates of society. Groups involved in the Carnival have taken this theme on board, particularly the London School of Samba, who celebrate their 20th birthday this year. Their costumes will explore the theme of duality between oppression and freedom as well as nodding to the joint anniversaries being celebrated by themselves and the Carnival. Once again, Notting Hill Carnival's focus will comprise of the five artistic arts arenas - Calypso, Mas (masquerade bands), Pan (steel bands), and the mobile and static sound systems. The Carnival is truly a London event despite it being seen as a Notting Hill Carnival, and is growing from its distinctive Trinidadian roots into a truly diverse festival representative of the multi-cultural and multi-racial society of the nation's capital.       Sound systems at Carnival 2004  These are the sounds systems from 2003, as we don't yet have final information on 2004.

      February 1, 1948 - August 6, 2004     Rick James passed away this morning at 9:20 AM in his sleep of natural causes at his Los Angeles home, per his spokesperson. He was 56 years old. He is survived by his 3 children (Ty, Rick Jr., Tazman) and 2 grandchildren (Jasmine and Charisma).   Last month, he performed his hit "Fire & Desire" with Teena Marie at the BET Awards. He had finished an album and was preparing for its release next year. He was also in discussion with various studios for a movie based on his life.   Born in Buffalo, NY, known as the King of Punk Funk, and the bad boy of Motown, Rick James blended the hard core funk of his predecessors James Brown, Sly Stone and George Clinton with the Rock and Roll theatrics of the Rolling Stones and Kiss. Rick James was the quintessential "Super Freak," a term he coined in the 1980's with the multi-platinum song he wrote, arranged, produced and performed sharing that same title. The single catapulted the album Street Songs to #1 on the R&B charts and #3 on the pop charts. This mega-talented, multi-Grammy and American Music Award winner played at least five different instruments and had not only sold millions himself, he wrote and produced songs for Eddie Murphy, Mary Jane Girls, The Temptations, Teena Marie and Smokey Robinson, all selling millions as well. He licensed his work for sampling by artists such as Mary J. Blige, Erykah Badu and MC Hammer, whose sample of "Super Freak" for the hit single "U Can't Touch This" made Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em the biggest selling rap album in history.   Details on the funeral will be announced shortly.   In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the  urlLink  American Cancer Society.

      Mark Robertson     Born in South London, Mark's exposure to music started at a very early age. Coming from a family of 5 and having 2 older sisters heavily into Jazz Fuision, Brit Funk and Soul, Mark soon began to acquire a taste for the jazzier side of dance music.  Due to his young age, Mark's frustration with his sisters club outings in the 80's led him to sneak out on his own to some of the clubs he knew about. His unique approach to getting into one particular club took the form of paying someone in the queue to open a door at the back of a club. Initially, more times than not, he would end up standing there for hours before despondently accepting that "it ain't gonna happen!" However, over time, Mark's persistence paid off and some of the older queuing clubbers could be persuaded to bump open the fire exit if he crossed their palm with silver.  "I remember having to stand in the darkest corner of this club so I wasn't spotted by anyone who wanted to give me a hard time for being there. It was really awkward, I couldn't go to the loo, get a drink or basically attract any attention otherwise I would be kicked out. I was paranoid as hell but at the same time totally getting off on everyone freakin' on the dancefloor around me. I remember buying a pair of those black and white spats that the jazz dancers wore... sad but true. I didn't have a clue how to jazz dance with my 2 left feet, but I felt cool all the same."  As a teenager, Mark continued his search for all things jazzy and soulful, now taking the role of buying as many records as he could with a limited amount of money.   "I used to bunk off school and go down to Bill Shannon's shop Timewarp in Croydon. I'd ring him up and tell him how much (or little) money I had to spend and he would sort some tunes out for me. I have to say; everything that I bought from him is still good to this day. He always picked out the choice records even though I knew jack about some of this stuff. He probably won't even remember me, but I really appreciate him steering me in the right direction where he could have so easily palmed off something a little more mediocre."   "Another poignant event for me was when I was walking past City Sounds in Holborn and heard Airto's Celebration Suite for the first time. I went mad and rushed into the shop like an idiot, lost all my decorum and just said I had to have that record. This was really the first time I had ever heard a full blown Batucada tune and it blew me away."   Now older and a bit savvier, Mark ventured out religiously to various clubs around South East England.  "In retrospect, I kick myself a bit because I think I missed out on the scene that revolved around the likes of Paul Murphy, Kev Beadle, Gilles and alike. I was going to other jazz and funk clubs in Kent, which seemed great at the time but now I've got to know more of the deejays from the other scene, I think it would have been great to have been there also. Saying that, some of the people I used to listen to on pirate radio all those years ago, I now know personally and I still get a bit of a thrill talking to them. They really helped shaped the sounds I am into now... I have great respect for them."  The beginning of Mark's deejay career started in 1992 when he moved to Sydney, Australia.   "I was at a barbecue and had some tapes on me. The guy who's barbecue it was told me to put one on. The first tune that came out of the speakers was Clarence Wheelers 'Right On'; another guy recognised the tune because it had been sampled recently. As it turned out he was one of the major club owners in Sydney and offered me a job there and then. I just happened to be in the right place at the right time."  From there, Mark held a residency at Kinselas, one of the main clubs in Sydney, with 3 floors, Mark played in the members bar for a year and a half before moving on, holding down residencies at other clubs in Sydney.  "I bumped into this guy called Paul Carroll, who is now a good friend of mine, I actually work with him here in the UK when we organise larger events in London. People were really starved of music that wasn't pop, rock or dodgy swing beat tunes that so many of the Australian deejays were spinning at that time. There were only a handful of Australians diggin' less obvious music and diggin' the crates for more interesting sounds. I found so many great records while I was there."  "Nowadays, I think the majority of it has been uncovered, much like the States. There are now a lot of great deejays and musicians in Australia. At that time though, I had all these records and limited places to play them. Paul decided to organise his own warehouse parties. He got it so right, I remember the crowd going bonkers to James Mason's 'Free' - they hadn't heard anything like it before. I began to be Paul's main deejay over the next 3 years."  "A great experience was when Paul flew over Roy Ayers and his entire band and we toured and deejayed around Australia. We used to attract 1500+ people to some of the most idyllic locations... it was a magical time."  Now back in London, Mark continues to explore his love affair with all things musical. As well as holding 3 residencies, he organises large 800+ music events with live international bands and deejays under the Spiritual South banner. He has also been studying Latin percussion for the past 4 years and has performed at Ronnie Scotts and deejayed at Glastonbury 2003 on the One World stage. Equally important, Mark's production skills are coming to the fore with a list of exciting record releases and remixes.

      Cadet, 1975  Monster funk from organist Reuben Wilson! Although Wilson cut pretty traditional organ jazz for Blue Note and Groove Merchant - this album has him working with the "Cost Of Living" group, in a funky soul mode that's just great! Brad Baker (of B Baker Chocolate Co fame) did the arrangements with Wilson - and the sound is a mix of War-type stepping funk numbers with other tracks that maintain more of an ensemble funk feel. Players on the record include Pee Wee Ellis, Richard Tee, Bernard Purdie, Houston Person, and Wilbur Bascomb - and many cuts have lead vocals by Sammy Turner or Kenny Williams. The title cut - "Got To Get Your Own" - is one of those rare groove classics that never gets old, and the record's filled with plenty of other excellent numbers, including "Tight Money", "In The Booth, In The Back, In The Corner, In The Dark", and "Back Rub".

      Smithsonian Folkways/Saba, 1963  A landmark album - and one of the best records you'll ever find by Mary Lou Williams! The record's a mixture of jazz and spiritual themes, and it features Mary Lou's piano set in some super-hip jazz arrangements that include players like Grant Green, Budd Johnson, Larry Gales, Melba Liston, Ben Tucker, and Percy Heath. The bass and piano work is amazing, and many tracks have a dark groove that's very subtle, but very compelling. About half the tunes feature hip choral vocalizing - in the mode of some of the Donald Byrd or Max Roach albums from the same time - mostly handled by the group of Howard Roberts. Includes the classic groover "A Grand Nite For Swinging", plus "A Fungus Amongus", "Anima Christi", "Miss DD", "The Devil", "It Ain't Necessarily So", and "My Blue Heaven". Great stuff all around - and even better than we're describing it! CD adds some extra tracks to the original recdording, too - with titles that include "Koolbonga", "Forty Five Degree Angle", "Nicole", "Chunka Lunka", and "Praise The Lord".      urlLink  Dusty Groove

      Music For Dreams  Marc-George, Steffen, Tchando and Alexandra are ready to meet the world with the latest international release, entitled Quiet Letters. This excellent new album includes some of the finest moments from Afterlife plus recordings from the past two years, which they just could not keep to themselves anymore. During those long sessions and recording time, they managed to get hold of one of their favourite voices: Sophie Barker from Zero 7. Kissing was compiled on more than 30 compilations and the two singles Dunia and The Suns of Afterlife as limited 10 inches were released internationally. Bliss has become one of the true chill-out undergrounds classics. From Mixmaster Morris to Budda Bar’s Ravin, from Chris Coco to Lenny Ibizzare, they have all enjoyed the blissful soundscapes of one of Denmark’s best acts. Lovers of the American TV series CSI will definitely remember the sound of this fantastic band.Today you will find a highly international album, which makes you think of Massive Attack meets Sade. With the vibes of Morricone, opening track Sleep will Come is an open space created with musical flair for tradition and a beautiful sense of ambience. Calm and quietly it folds into a dreamy and peaceful piece of music, that makes you think about a movie ones lost, now found.This is pop music that takes you far beyond the beaches of Ibiza, on a travel into African soul, Scandinavian coolness and love. Balearic, classical and mysterious. As often experienced in Scandinavian sound, Bliss as well owns this melancholic feeling underneath, deep down in the beats, as on the first vocal performance on the album, when you hear Sophie Barker’s voice on the track Breathe… it honestly, takes you away. In both Right here and Don’t Look Back you find two new classics with Sophie sounding stronger than ever.Evening Sun, Manvantara, and Quiet Letter are some of the other new compositions by Bliss made during the last year. Here Alexandra is the main vocal performer and sounding just as unique, blue and cool as ever. Do you remember Monica Zetterlunds performances with Bill Evans? Not that Bliss is making jazz, but Alexandra’s vocal performance has this same kind of honesty. Her interpretation of the Irish folk singer Gemma Hayes Evening Sun is truly a respectful contribution to a wonderful song. With Tchando alongside Alexandra in the vocal performances, they are making the sound of Bliss so personal and still approachable to many people. When Tchando sings Dunia you feel that tradition meets contemporary music, just like the eleven minute epic Manvantara.      urlLink  http://www.musicfordreams.dk/

       Blue Note/Water, 1969  reissue   "Incredible work from pianist Duke Pearson -- a darkly-tinged album of grooves that surpasses all his other gems for Blue Note! The record showcases some great work from Bobby Hutcherson -- slid into the mix in a really sly way, so that his jazzy vibes color all the tunes with an edgey feeling that's missing from most of Duke's other albums. The group's slightly largeish -- with Jerry Dodgion on flute and alto, Sam Brown and Al Gafa on guitar, plus added Latin percussion on a number of tracks -- but although the larger group format often made for softer edges on other Pearson sessions from the time, the mix here is quite different -- at a level that works in complicated rhythms, rich colors and tones, and warm harmonics that have a slightly unsettling undercurrent. The album's worth it alone for the mighty title cut "The Phantom" -- but the whole thing's great, and other tracks include "Bunda Amerela", "Say You're Mine" and "Blues for Alvina"." - dustygroove.com  "Duke Pearson was nicknamed by an uncle who admired Duke Ellington's music. As a youth he studied piano and several brass instruments, but dental problems prevented his becoming a professional trumpeter. He worked as a pianist in Florida and Georgia (1954-59), then moved to New York, where he played most often with Pepper Adams and Donald Byrd (Byrd recorded his best- known compositions, "Jeannine" and "Cristo Redentor"). He also joined the Jazztet briefly (1960) and toured internationally as the accompanist to Nancy Wilson (1961).  From 1963 to 1970 Pearson worked as a producer for Blue Note records. During this period he formed a big band, initially led also by Byrd; as the Duke Pearson Band (1967-70), it rivaled the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Orchestra, which also shared some of the same personnel. Its soloists included Adams, Frank Foster, Jerry Dodgion, Lew Tabackin, Randy Brecker, the trumpeter Joe Shepley, and Garnett Brown. The ensemble provided a forum for the performance of Pearson's lyrical, swing-oriented compositions. In 1971 Pearson taught at Clark College, and the following year re-formed his band with virtually the same musicians as before. He toured with Carmen McRae and Joe Williams from 1972 to 1973; in the late 1970s his ability to play was impaired by the onset of multiple sclerosis." -BARRY KERNFELD,The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz          urlLink  http://entertainment.msn.com/artist/?artist=106641
