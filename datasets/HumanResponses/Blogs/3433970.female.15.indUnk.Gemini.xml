It's an A!!" it was soo funny but then my mom decided she wanted 2 be funny so she started saying ari stop takin ur clothes off!!! go back in there and put ur bra back on!!!! omg i was soo embarassed..but it was soo funny!!!! i guess im a little better...my bday is coming up!! well i guess i like 2 guys now....but theyre soo completley different!! anyways...i have soo much 2 do and i just found out that i have a collesano test 2morro!!! shit!! lots of love!!

       so this is the second time im writing today because the first time it didnt publish for some reason. alot of shit has been going on lately, so i think that this is a good way to vent. its seems like my life is out of my control. the only thing that keeps me sane is dancing...but sometimes i think im not that good....so whats the point? i dunno i feel like my studdio is holding me back from being the best dancer i can be....but i guess if i keep loving to do it it will all be ok.   So i honestly have no idea what happened to my realtionship with my mom. we used to be so close and we used have such a good relationship? what the hell happened. ever since i started school it seems like she doesnt wanna let me grow or experience new things...and i want to have new friends. she doesnt trust me and she thinks im just gonna drink and smoke and have sex. but i wont. lately we cant be in  a room with each other for more than five minutes without yelling at each other or getting into a fight. i think she hates me, in fact i kno she does cuase shes told me enough times. it seems she'll do anything to make me miserable and i dont kno what i did, except not take her shit. i love her...i truly do..but our relationship is deteriorating before my eyes and it seems theres absolutley nothing i can do about it.   Don't get me wrong i still love all my friends from my old school: cara sarah courtney po ryan jacob and nikki. for a while me and cara were drifting but were cool now thank god, shes one of my bestest friends. i kno u guys care about me and ill always love you.    I just really like change...but sometimes its not a good thing.....today i read meryl's journal and i wasnt mentioned in it at all....i havent realized how long its been since we've hung out. i miss her..but things have been so different since our stupid "drama" and i dont know how to fix it....i love chs and the people there but sometimes i cant tell...i just wish people werent so fake.     lately ive been so annoyed with a particular person i cant take it anymore nad i dont know how long ill last before i just flip out. this person is just so god damn sensitive i have no idea how to say anything...and how can u tell someone to just buzz off when youve known them for so long and they consider you their best friend?     School has been insane. exams are coming up. there must be something wrong with me because i studied for so long for one geometry test and i still got a 69. fuck. a good number, yes, but not for a test. people have such high expectations of me. its just been really hard for me to pretend to be happy lately, and i think maybe people have started to notice.     Today i did nothing but homework and sleep. it seems like i could sleep for ten days and maybe no one would no the difference. maybe i could wake up and everything would be perfect again....but i doubt that could ever happen....and why do guys play games? i guess ill never kno      To all my close friends dont even worry bout me....i just really needed to vent...this is exactly what i needed.....its really hard for me to open up to people, and when i do im constantly worried about the fact that theyll say something or think differently of me....i really needed to just lay it all out.....i dont care anymore.....people knowing how i feel is important to me...

      so i haven't written in awhile....on tuesday i went to megs with cara and meryl for our little adam sandler party lol..i was excited because i had never seen happy gilmore or billy madison, which was really good...we had so much fun and made a gangster tape of us around meg's neighborhood..but some creepy guy in a hawaiian shirt was walking in front of us..he stopped and unbuttoned his shirt and started to walk toward us and he had on a bra that was stuffed it was soo sick! wtf! and then we started laughing and we turned around and he stopeed, exposing his full bra! what is that??  meryl left early wedsnesday morning but me meg and cara decided to see the stepford wives avec connor. i thought it was mad funny until the end, which was just bizar. and tell me why christopher walken looked like a cadaver!?? wtf lol  it was a fun little party, but i was so different. i feel like im transforming into this person i don't even know. i'm soo different, not wanting to like play games and everything and id rather just sleep all day....meg is leaving tuesday meryl is leaving soon...aof course when i got home from the sleepover i got bitched at...mer both my parents are starting to get to me...seriously get to me...theyre both so unhappy..maybe because of me?? its all starting to take its toll....im not as happy as i used to be and its getting realy hard to pretend like i am.  yah ,now what i read all my friends journals and the common denominator of their unhappiness seems to be parents...what the hell  bleh i need a shower

      i just got home from church-the fathers day mass which i went to with my dad....i guess it was ok..i got this award and it was kinda  embarassing....i am so glad that i only have one more exam. yesterday i went to kristen's dance recital..btw meryl i am sooooooooo sorry that i couldn't come to urs my parents wouldn't drive me....but im sure that u did amazing and i wouldve come to urs saturday but i promised kristen when i didnt go to hers last year i would come this year!! anyways the recital was really really good and i was impressed because it was prolly the best ive seen all year and there was foot and arm coordination!! omg kristen has so much presence!! at the recital there was this circle of life number which was my favorite cause it was really good technically but then they brought out this baby at the end which was the funniest thing ive ever seen because it was like wearing a leopard print loin cloth!! and kate peruzzini does the best impression...jesus i love that girl...we needed to leave for a lil while and we walked to cvs but it was closed! anywhoit was a really good recital! so shits has been kinda messed up lately..im scared meg to ask my mom about tuesday cause i think she is going to say no....i dunnoo but whats goin on is starting to make me a really miserable person....if u compare me now to me three or four months ago its sooo different...ive been like mad bitch to everyone lately..alot of the times to cara sorry and i love u....gtg today is the day of fathers so i suppose we are doing something with the fam!

      ok today was soo fun it was insane!!!! i dunno sometimes i think that half days are botty, but let me tell you this one was not one of those days. so after school me meg meryl nikki cara katie and emily all went to kosta's. of course we all left the table to visit with other people and the stupid kosta guy yelled at us!!!! anyways so after that we went to walgreens and i bought ouch gum....which i left on meg's kitchen table, and it suspiciously disappeared (im gonna find out who took it bitches!!) lol...and we decided to buy water balloons....now this did not seem like a good idea to me, but im glad we did. so then we went back to megs and filled them up. however, we decided that throwing them at each other just wouldn't be as fun as bombarding boys with them so we came up with a plan..lol!! we were gonna go to ronnie's house...we put the balloons in a cooler and the plan was to be like we got beer, but that didn't work out. we got there and jim bush was like locked out but then everyone else came outside, like greg ben o and of course campbell. they stole our whole cooler and took it inside with them!!! it was so unfair because they took em inside and ron's house has soo many windows its insane!! they opened like every window and started bombarding us with water balloons....but campbell was the only one who actually came outside and took it like a man..yeah campby!!..we all ended up geting really soaked and i oppushed cara into ron's infected pool...but a few of the boys were still dry..cough ben o cough...campbell threw our shoes on the roof...emily and katie are traitor bitches for going inside for a towel..lol jk!then we went back to meg's and chillaxed in the backyard...then we went back and campbell was completley locked out so he had to use meryl's phone to call cooper to come save him....o geez it was a good time.....what a good day!!!!!!!!!!1 and there is only two more days of school left!!!!!!!!! so not to ruin the mood but it all went down hill when i got home....ma mere was of course in a pissy mood and her and my dad got into this huge fight as usual and i am so sick of listneing to their god damn fights...i dunno...i wish sometimes i could just not live here but then where would i go??? eh i dunno but ive decided not to let it ruin my day......which was so fun!!!! lots of love-Ari

      omg today was the first day of ub.....man o man staring with ballet at nine in the morning.....gsus!! that was a really hard ballet class but i did really well....then on to modern i love the teacher and she knows my name which is good when ur in a class of 50 people and its the first day.....then jazz which was mad easy (as well as modern) and we learned this sweet ass combo that is mad hotness....we went on campus for lunch but it was a ghost town...real weird...the afternoon was fun i learned choreography from A Chorus Line-my least favorite musical but the opening number is the best. and another surprise....tara brown was there taking the beginner classes...it was sososososo good to see her i love her soo much!  i cannot tell u how much i love katie and justine...we had so much fun in the afternoon and we did well even tho we were screwing around...o man i am going to miss them so much next year when they graduate....ill obviously miss alysia 2...  i was so nervous this morning....even tho i took the classes last year u never know what to expect...when u get there u realize wow these are college kids.....everyone who did the full day was cool except these evil bitches from david d marie who sucked mad booty..haha too bad for them!!  friday nikki cara and kristen came over to do fireworks and make smores which was sooooo much fun!! we were waving them in the street and cara had a candle to light them off of when i cop car pulled up haha. Shit! we had quite an interesting conversation with the fuzz tho: coppers:what r u doing with that candle?     -ummmmmm- me:having a vigil.....     -muffled laughs- c:let us in it can't be that funny! ummmmmmmm c:u wouldn't have fireworks would u? all: no not us!! mom to the rescue: they r practicing for cheerleading and using the candle as their spirit stick!! (WTF?!) c:well then uu have to do a cheer for us!! thats the only way we will stop bothering u and questioning u.. me and nikki do retarded cheer replacing centaurs with police  little did we know that they were cheektowaga police so nothing would of hapened since we are in buffalo!!! o m g  o me and the fam went to the baseball game saturday...i love baseball...then on the 4th ugh we were forced to go to this cook out at our parents friends' house which was cruel and unusual punishment because ne1 who knows me knows how much i despise small children and my idea of fun isn't having little boys pulling on my skirt and throwing poppers at me...rar lol  i just saw shrek 2 avec cara and courtney....it was mad dunny i love puss in boots!  i miss meg...and meryl altho i just saw her thursday....but she's leaving for camp sunday and i have no free days at all this week!!  things r kinda better with my mom....i dunno  xoxo Ari

OMG!  sunday was booty...family day..yeah..but monday was fun because me and alysia went to mall and what not for some much needed bonding time.  o m g.......tuesday..wow some funny stuff happened on that day which i won't forget for awhile...so jul came over and we went to the corner store and then to her house and jumped on the tramp for awhile avec po. then we dedcided to go for another walk which led us to this playground kinda near my house in..duh duh dum-cheektowaga!! lol newyas so we wwere there just chillin on the tire swing when this creepy little  boy just came out of the shadows. it was evident that he was a litle slow so we decided to be nice to him...but then he like assaulted me and rubbed alysia's sandals on his penis!! he was like'i rubbed them on my penis" and like wouldn't get off of me...then he goes up to a dawg and is like will u marry me? and tries to take her class ring off of her finger....we decided that this was an opportune moment to depart...but the little bastard kung fu gripped jul's arm and was like "YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE-DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?" we were so scared so i went to jul's rescue and we ran home away from that scary little boy....we think that he escaped from this group home a few houses away from the park...but just imagine if he had been older!  wednesday i saw spiderman with cara...man i love her soooo much and i hope she knows it...it was pretty good.  today i went to darien lake with cara meryl and courtney who i hadn't seen in a really long time...i miss her alot and i looove her 2!!! we went kayaking haha meryl but had to leave early cause cara had a softball game and i had cheerleading which felt like it was 4 hours long even tho it was only a little over 2....me and tracy kept getting yelled at but alysia always yells at me lol  meg left tuesday.... i miss her lots but apparently shes coming home early cause ehr cousin is being a fool?...however i wouldn't know because that loser meg didn't call me....jkizzle meg i love u!  yah know what else? these past few days have been really good for me...yah know why?
