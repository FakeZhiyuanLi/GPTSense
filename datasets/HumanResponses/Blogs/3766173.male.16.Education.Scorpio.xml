      Yeah, I didn't update the last couple of nights. Why? Because I'm lazy, I couldn't be bothered, and 'today I slept all day' isn't exactly riveting for either of us.  Anyways, there's been some actual progress in my life, which shocks me greatly. Because of a lack of attendance (either because I ended up sleeping all day because I only got an hours sleep that night, or just because I couldn't be bothered turning up) and just plain having not handed in any quality work (I've been everso slack, accursed internet!) my year at school is pretty much on the verge of 'you fail!', and with little chance of recovering it. So, I'm signing out of school tomorrow, spending the rest of the year doing random crap, and doing my HSC equivalant at TAFE next year.  I'm not sure what I'm going to do in the six or so months off this gives me. But then, I wasn't really sure where my life was heading when I was in school, either. This will, at the very least, give me some time to think about what I want to do with myself.  The age-old question remains, though: Do I Nazi-salute my Fuhrer-like Software teacher once I am out of the school's jurisdiction?

      Very original and creative title, isn't it? Oh well, what else could I say? Anyway, today wasn't too eventful. I stayed at my mate Nathan's last night, woke up this morning and he was playing Pokemon Colosseum. We watched some DBZ AMV's and some Futurama, then went to play some Halo but it was time for me to head back to my place.   Last week I emailed this friend of mine, telling her how I feel about her. Yeah yeah, not the best or most personal way, but it needed to be done. Got a response back today, the usual 'just want to stay friends' thing. Didn't really worry me, that was the answer I was expecting, and I'm happy to be able to have our friendship intact.  That's all for today. Night.

      I really can't be bothered writing anything at the moment, and even if I could it'd just be "angst, angst, angst, feel like shit, hate myself, blah, blah, etc", so I'll write when I've got something to.

      Eh...missed a night or two again. No big deal.  My Wednesday began when the clock rolled to midnight, much like most of my days do. I went downtown shopping, bought some stuff, most noteable of which was Black Books series 1 DVD. I love that show, and Bernard reminds me (and others, they've told me) of myself.  But that has little relevance to the most important thing that happened, and what I themed this entry's title around. Last I wrote, I had decided to drop out of school. Wednesday night, I had a talk to my friend Dale, and a bit of a think, and came to the conclusion that I should try and salvage the year. So Thursday saw me being bored, sitting around my parents house, having decided to have the last two days of term off.   Then, for some reason or other, I decide to go to school this morning. A brief encounter with my I.T. teacher made me realise how much my year has gone down the crapper, and makes me decide that no, I won't bother with this year, I'll just do it at TAFE next year. After recess I had Ancient History, and seeings as we sit inside the room I have it in at recess and lunch, I might as well go. We have an assignment due, and because y'know, I'm leaving and all, I don't have it. I tould my teacher why I didn't have it, and why I was leaving, so he sent me down to have a chat with one of the deputy principals.  To cut a long story short, after much talking and deliberation, I've decided that I'll most likely be doing my HSC part-time, meaning I can drop Art, I.T., and Software, and re-do them another time. Sure, it'll take me a year or two extra, but I don't care. I'm only young, there's plenty of years ahead of me.
