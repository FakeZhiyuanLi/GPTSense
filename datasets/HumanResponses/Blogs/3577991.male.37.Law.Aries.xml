           One of the things that my Christian friends always seem to ask is, "How can you, being a Christian, own snakes?  Don't you realize they are, 'Of the devil,' and cursed by God?  It says so in Genesis."  It is usually from well-meaning, albeit ophidiophobic, people,who I believe just don't read the Bible enough to get their facts straight.  So I set off to rebut these people who want to blame their fear of snakes on God, and I found some interesting facts, let me show  them to you.        The first thing the well-meaning Christian will point out that the Bible says about snakes, is that they are of the devil.  Let's see if that is true, shall we?  Now, when someone says something is, "Of the devil," they mean the devil created it, right?  As far as I can see, and according to Genesis 1:24,25, the Lord said, "Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind,...everything that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that is was good." And in Genesis 1:31, the Bible restates what God had done, "And God saw every thing that HE had made, and, behold, it was VERY GOOD."  Now I know that there are many other Scriptures to buttress this point, John 1:3, Revelation 5:11, etc, etc, but, for the sake of space we will just use these two. When you read these scriptures, it states, very clearly, that God created EVERYTHING.  Not only that, but everything He created, He says is GOOD.  Snakes, created by God, are good, end of story.        "Okay, but snakes were cursed by God, so that makes them of the devil, so there."  You know, some people actually think this is a strong point, and that there is no way to attack it.  These people need to go to a critical thinking class!  Let's have a look at that bit of Scripture where the snakes were cursed, and we will find some interesting stuff.  Genesis 3:14-19, is the basic snake cursing episode in the Bible, read with me, "And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon the belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life."  That's it, right? The snake was cursed, that settles it, God hates snakes.  Slow down.  Read on with me, "Unto the WOMAN he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children..."  And read on still, "And unto ADAM he said,...in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground..."  Big problem, at the same time God cursed the snake, He cursed the Man and Woman.  So, if because of the curse God HATES the snake, he has to hate the man and woman at the same time.  Now, the only way I'll believe God hates only the snake, is if women quit having pain in child-birth, and weeds never show up in another garden again, (big fat chance of that ever happening.)         Now that I have whacked the two arguments of most snake-fearing Christians out of the proverbial ball park, let's look at some other neat things about snakes.  What was the first miracle Moses did before Pharaoh?  He turned Aaron's rod into a snake, imagine that, God using a snake in a miracle. By the way, that's found in Exodus 7:9,10.  Remember the story in Numbers 21:4-9? The people of Israel started whining about being taken out of Egypt to die in the wilderness.  So, God sends, "fiery serpents," to  straighten them out.  Now when the people figured out they were sinning, they went to Moses for a cure.  What was that cure?  A brass serpent.  Imagine that, a brass idol of a serpent healed God's people.  People that didn't look upon it died.  The ones that didn't look upon it probably thought that God hated snakes.  Another irresistable tidbit about this episode, in John 3:14, just two verses before the most pivotal scripture in all of the New Testament, Jesus is compared to this very same brass serpent!        So, what am I saying about snakes?  Am I saying that we should be handling vipers during church service?  Nope.  Am I saying that Christians should learn to love snakes? Nope.  What am I saying then?  THINK!  Don't just assume the Bible says things.  Let me illustrate.  How many times have you heard the phrase, "God helps those who help themselves?"  And after hearing that phrase, someone says that it is in the Bible, and people just accept that as fact.  Guess what, it's not in there anywhere. (Just as a side note, you could spend the rest of your life trying to find the phrase "separation of church and state" in the U.S. Constitution, and you'll never find it.)  If you have a belief in something, study it, don't go through your life assuming what people say is true, check it out, verify the facts.  If you heard someone say that snakes were of the devil because the Bible says so and believed it, you would be wrong.  People have been blaming God for things that are "In the Bible" for so long, and never once have they ever read it to find out if it's true or not.

           Was talking to a firefighter buddy o' mine the other day, we were discussion a new firestation that was being built in the area and he said, "Funny thing is, there's no money in the budget to staff this brand new firestation."         "What do you mean," all of us incredulously query nearly 'bout simultaneously, and he goes on to say that, as he understands it, the way the budget in this great state o' California, there can be enough money to build a certain structure, and not be enough to staff it.         We all agree that that is the height of insanity, and He says, "Guess you've never worked for a union."    "No," I say, "What does that have to do with this?"        "Well, when you work in a union job, you never give up money they give you."       "Oh, right," I say, "I remember when I worked for the school district.  They would always say at near the end of the year, 'We've got to spend this money, or we won't get it next year.'"       "Bingo!"      Conversation over, now comes my two cents +.       I am sure there was a time when large companies treated their employees with no respect, low wages, poor working conditions, etc., etc., and that unions were needed to insure that these kinds of things were not allowed to continue.  But today's unions are a different matter.  Today all I can see of the unions are big, fat, greasy political machines that use their membership to extract a pound of flesh from the companys that hire (graciously hire) the union members.        The argument for the unions, as far as I can tell is that they will stand up for the worker when the company is causing harm to the employee, maybe by having him or her work in an unsafe environment, or requiring them to work overtime without pay, something on that order.  But, there are numerous stories out there about that just not being the case.  My wife had a situation with an administrator in the school district she worked for, and she filed a grievance and then she and the union rep went to see the administrator, and the union rep backed-off of all the support she had "promised" my wife in their previous conversations.  Another story, guy working for a "large telecommunications company in California (who knows who that could be?) is asking him to violate OSHA laws on the job, to his physical detriment, and he has to pull teeth to get the union to come in and assist him (now, what exactly are those union dues for again?)         Unions, especially those that involve Public Employees are the worst.  You can't get a job in a school anywhere unless you become a union member, pay the dues, the whole deal.  You have no choice.  Land of the free?  Yeah, right.  The biggest problem with these unions is that they spend our money.  Tax dollars.  They want more money for programs, you open your wallet.  They don't have money for this or that, you gotta pay (they don't, however, ask if you can afford to pay it, they just take it).  It breaks my heart that schools can't afford to pay for music in elementary school, but, the fact is, we can't afford it.  Shoot, why don't they can a few overpaid administrators, they would have plenty of money for music.  Taxpayers are tapped out.  School folks scream, "it's only a few dollars!"  I say, "no, its only a few MORE dollars than I am already paying, and I just don't have it!"  When 30 to 50 percent of your income goes to taxes, that is too much.         One last story.  Mid 90s, UPS goes on strike.  "Health and Welfare!" is the cry from the drivers.  The shipping in this country is really affected 'cause their wetting their pants about unfairness.  Our UPS gal, Holly, is telling us every day prior to the strike, we're tired of it, we want more money, they're not treating us right, on and on and on.  Turns out, after the strike, the deal they got wasn't as good as the deal they had.  We ask her about it, she says, "It's the principle."  WHAT!?!  You just screwed yourself and you're talking about principle?  I thought you said they weren't paying you enough and you wanted better this and better that?  Well, we showed them!  Yeah, you sure did.       Makes no sense.

           It's not very often that people inspire me.  However, on the evening of Sunday, July 25, our church had a baptismal service, and I was witness to true courage.        A baptismal service, in my opinion is no mean thing.  It is the first step of obedience for the believer, it is the outward showing of an inward change.  On this particular evening, we had over twenty people to be baptized, several kids, several teenagers and several adults, and quite a few in the audience.  One of the adults in particular, and I don't know her name, is a lady we have seen several times in our adult Bible study on Wednesday nights.        She is an attractive woman, with rather long hair, dark brunette with some highlights.  Anyway, she got into the baptistry and began to tell of how her whole life had been ruled by fear and not by faith, but tonight, faith was going to win.  At this point, much to this disbelief of almost all in attendance, she removed her hair.  What we did not know, was that she was in reality, bald or suffering from some condition that caused hair not to grow on most of her head.  After a few seconds passed and the initial shock wore off, all in attendance realized what this truly courageous woman had done.  The applause was incredible.  We all have those fears, we all have things we don't dare let people know about us, and here this woman let go of the fears that we all have a hard time letting go of.       We live in a time and country, and state for that matter, that puts a premium on appearance.  If you don't look just so, you don't count.  This woman had for years hidden this secret for fear, fear that I don't know, could probably never know, but, because she wanted to be honest, to let everyone know how much she now trusted Jesus, she let go of the secret.  Wow!  That gives me a new reason, not that all the "old" reasons aren't good enough, to continue to be salt and light to those around me, not to hide my fears, cloud my shortcomings, or think that I am something that I am not.
