      Well, I started Weight Watchers on Wednesday. I have a great person (what are they called, teachers? leaders?, what?). She is the same one two of my friends have, both who have lost A LOT of weight. I am hoping they will be a wonderful influence on me. I am going to give it my all. I decided that I will stick with it come what may. I know there will be times I will gain a few ounces, maybe even pounds. Times when I stay the same for weeks at a time, but I am going to stick with it. Sure, it is 9.95 a week, but really, what is that, two lunches. Two lunches I should be bringing from home anyway. 5 gallons of gas, 4 gallons of milk, one package of diapers, I could go on and on.  So, I have begun counting. I have not done so much counting since 6th grade math. I am heading to the store shortly where I will take my little chart with me and pick some low points food. I want some good snacks around here for when I feel like I am not eating enough. Oh, I know I am not hungry, I have come to terms with that, but sometimes you know you just need something more, and more, and more, and more. YIKES!  Those flex points will be saved for Mexico, because I can tell you, I might rather go without eating to have a pina colada in la pina. The problem is I don't have just one, try four or five. Well, it is vacation. It is hot down there (okay not really) but it is vacation and I have FOUR KIDS! I need not say more.  So check back every Wednesday night, I will have an update after my meeting. I am hoping that having to post my losings and gains here just might help a little bit every time I choose something to eat.  Maybe, just maybe, the next time you see me, you will see less of me.

      Still waiting on the "yes" or "no" for the property we bid on in Baja. We are heading down next weekend to take a look at something else just in case this one (which is our dream) doesn't work out for some reason. Anyone want to go with us?

      Today we enrolled Siobhan in preschool. She will be starting the week I return to work. I am filled with mixed emotions. I am so happy because I know it is what she needs, friends to play with, learning with someone other then family, lots of different activities, and of course, snack time. But why does she have to be so big? She is two and a half now, and I wonder where the time has gone. Wasn't she just born? Didn't we have her first birthday only a few months ago?  I know she will do wonderfully. For the few moments we were there, she was already playing. She is ready to let go a little. She will do find without mom and dad for the day, but will we? I know there will come a day when she will not want to come home because she is having too much fun. Isn't that what we want? NO! We want her to have fun, fun, fun, but never so much she doesn't yell "Mommy", "Daddy". Yikes! I know who this whole preschool thing is going to be hard on, us! Siobhan will do great!

      Do I even need to say anything, or does the picture say it all? I can tell you, I will think twice before I ask her to get me some tissue.

      Yes, that is us, the Jasso's with two players of the LA Galaxy! Chris Aloisi, #28. Alejandro Moreno, #15, is holding Siobhan. When he went to pick her up I told him to be careful that she is heavy. He told us he needed the practice. There sitting on the couch in the luxury suite, was Moreno's very pregnant wife. She was really sweet when Siobhan went over and started talking to her.  Now, of course we are fans of the LA Galaxy! This is our second season having season tickets. Last night we attended a game that we did not orginally have tickets for. What  a bargin. These seats for $52.00 included four general admission seats, four hot dogs and four cokes. What a deal! Where else can you have fun with the whole family for that kind of price. The seats were pretty good too, behind the goal, and four sections to chose from.  Next season the Chivas USA will be playing at the Home Depot Center as well. We hope that this might add to the fans not take away. If you ever want to attend a game with us, let us know. We are always happy to include someone else in the fun we have there. Besides nothing is cuter then hearing Siobhan yell "Gal-x-ee, Gal-x-ee", "Cobi!"

      While driving in the car with her daddy, Siobhan told Eric, "green means go". He, of course, agreed with her. Then he asked her what does red mean, she said "stop". (Wow) Then he said what does yellow mean, she didn't know. Eric told her it means slow down. He said "you are a good driver", she said "I'm not driving, I'm good at the lights".   Today she remembered what yellow was for. She always asks which direction we are turning, and every now and then gets it right. (left, right, she has a 50/50 chance, really). Now it makes me wonder, is she really incredible, or just aware of EVERYTHING around her? She is 2 years old, 6 months, and 13 days. She can carry on a conversation about anything. She understands everything we say, repeats everything (even things she shouldn't), even when you think she isn't paying attention, out of her mouth will come the last thing we talked about.   I guess Eric was the same way when he was a kid, so maybe it isn't so amazing. It could be that she has four adults talking to her all the time, not to mention her grandma. Whatever it is, I am amazed everyday with what she knows. Sometimes forgetting that she is only 2.   We are currently working on potty training, I would like to have day time done before she goes to preschool late next month. She is doing just fine. She loves her new Dora pull-ups, but the princess one's make her happy too. I told her I will not buy her anymore diapers.

      Have you ever had a car that felt like an extention of yourself? As though the minute you sat in it, you were sitting inside yourself? I had that feeling for a short time. And to be perfectly honest, I never knew that I could feel that way about a car. A machine, something to get me from one place to another. I miss that car. A 1994 Land Rover Discovery. Red. Jump Seats. Moon roof. Sun roof. Leather. I loved that car. If one can love a car, I loved that car. I had never even heard of Land Rover until Eric said I should look into one so we could off-road. The minute I drove it, that was that. I didn't mind driving anywhere. I liked to look out the window and see it there in the drive, waiting to go on an outting. Begging to be driven. After work, it was as if a loved one was waiting there for me. I love the way it handled. The feel of it on the road. I felt safe. (Go ahead and hit me, I probably won't even feel it). An amazing car.  Now, don't get me wrong, I loved that car. But I saw it for what it was, a piece of shit. That car was in and out of the shop so many times. It never left me stranded anywhere (thankfully), the think leaked oil (so much George Bush would be proud), it got, if I was lucky, 10 miles to the gallon. It would overheat, so I never got to use the air. The jump seat were only good in a pinch because there really isn't a lot of leg room back there. Nothing was cheap to fix, no one had parts, it had to be someones speciality to work on that car. Still, I think about that car.  It has been gone 9 months now, and sometimes, just sometimes, I forget I no longer have it. I knew I had to get rid of it. We were expecting another baby and needed more room and more reliablity. Now I am driving a VW Eurovan,and I have no complaints. That van is great, especially for a van. It fills all the needs that my family has, but it is not my Disco.  Eric and I know so much more now. If we were going to buy another we would be able to make a wiser choice. I dream of having another, maybe when Krystal and Bradley are older and no longer go anywhere with us. I have to thank the Rover Dr. in Irvine for always taking care of me and my Disco.  Little red Disco, where ever you are, I miss you. I think about you. I love the way I felt when I was driving you. Thank you for letting me know that someone can actually love a car. I wouldn't have thought it was possible before you. No one will ever be able to fill your leather seats like me!

      I love Netflix. We have been members since December of 2000. It has been wonderful to rent DVD's online, pay no shipping or late fees and have them sent directly to your home. We wait for those lovely red envelopes to come, watch as soon as humanly possible so we can send it out and get another. We started with the 3 out at a time plan and we are now on the 5 out at a time. If you have never heard of Netflix, or would like to know more, check it out. http://www.netflix.com/  Now, Blockbuster started there mail program. Like Blockbuster doesn't already suck. They stick you every which way. They had that 2 day rental, then opened Hollywood Video which allowed 5 day rentals, what does Blockbuster do, change policy. Netflix opened (years ago) now Blockbuster wants part of that too. Hey Blockbuster, do something orginal would you? They have already closed most of the little video places on the corner, ya know, the one's where the guy would hold a movie for you because he knew you were coming in. Wal-Mart (don't EVEN get me started) wants a piece too. I guess it is easy to steal people's ideas. (Wal-mart seems to have "borrowed" something from iTunes too!). I don't get it. Leave the little guy alone. Isn't that what this country is all about, the American Dream. You can make it here. You can be and do anything you want if you work hard enough. Well, only if Wal-Mart or Blockbuster or some other monsterishly huge company doesn't want a piece of that action.  I can only hope that Netflix has built up enough devoted customers that don't mind paying a mere few dollars more for EXCELLENT service. Isn't that what a return customer is all about? Remember all the wonderful Mom and Pop stores? Me neither! We need to bring them back. Check it out, http://www.netflix.com/, and maybe you can see why we are so happy with it.

      Anaheim, California, 10:39pm. It is currently 70 degrees. My gosh! There is no wind blowing. It is hot! I had to turn the air on! All day I went with the windows open. How is it that it is now hotter then when the sun was shinning?! If I were in Baja right now, it is only 66 degrees. Of course even if it weren't cooler because of the ocean, I would still be in Baja. I could be here hot, or be in Baja hot. Hmmm, you decide which is better!!!

      What do people who are home all day, do all day? How many loads of laundry can one do before going nuts? Each day is no different then the next. I often have to check to find out what day it is. Now don't get me wrong, I love laying in bed every morning with Siobhan (who found her way there sometime in the night), laughing and talking, I treasure that time. I like being lazy in the morning, eating a real breakfast sometimes, cleaning a little before I dress. But really, have I come to be one of those people who values themselves because of the job they do? Am I only worth something when I go to work? I have no income so I am dependant on Eric for money. I actually had to ask for money to go shopping. (well not ask, but you know what I mean). And he is wonderful. He loves that I am home for an extended maturnity leave to be with all the kids this summer. He has not said anything about staying home all day and save money. So I know it is me. I think I blame the lack of complete happiness on my personality. I am not the type of person who enjoys being by herself. I need people. I need to talk. I need to laugh. I need contact. I need...adults. I am enjoying my time home because it is limited, but frankly if I was a stay at home mom, what would I do? Once the kids go back to school, what will that be like? What does one do with one's self all day at home? Are most stay at home moms expected to have dinner on the table when the husband comes home? (sorry Eric, you know that won't happen). I often don't even think of dinner until Eric is home. Should the house be spotless, Lord help us if we are waiting for me to do it. I realize my faults, I know I should do more. Thank goodness I usually have the excuse of work. I know that I am loved and accepted no matter my faults, by those around me. But what about me? Do I think it is okay that I, not only don't wish to stay at home full time, but don't become the best wife/mother that I can while I am here?  Maybe I am simply being. Auughhh, I feel as though I go on and on and don't get anywhere. I love my husband, I love my kids, and I love my dogs. I love my life, I know I have it a lot easier then most. I think, though, that I also love my job. I don't mean the job I do, I know I love that. I didn't spend all those years of college to do something I don't love, but I think I love who my job makes me. I love the person I am at work as well as at home. I would like more time at home, but I don't think I could ever give up my job. Does that make me a worse mom? A bad wife? Aren't I supposted to WANT to be home with them all the time? Isn't that what society tells us? That working mothers only work because they have to? Maybe  I don't have to, but I sure like to most of the time.   Well, I think Diego might have fallen back asleep. I think I will go climb in bed and hold Siobhan very close to me, smell her, and give her a million kisses.

      ..as Siobhan likes to call him. He is now 2 months old. He went to the Dr. today, he weighs 13 pounds and 5 oz. He is 24.5 inches long. The Dr. was quite surprised when I told her he was sleeping 5.5 to 7 hours at a time, eating and then heading back for at least another 3-5 hours. My kids like to sleep! He is as cute as can be, cooing at everything. Smiling when he sees something he likes, and we have even heard a laugh or two. Of course, three shots later, he is snoozing away. What a little joy that boy is!

      ... instant messenger? It is almost like being little again, back in Jackson, Tenn. When you knew what everyone was doing at just about any time of the day, like instant messenger. Because even when people are not there, they often leave a message so that I can know what they are up to at any time of the day. Michelle is at the beach (that's four days now, Michelle update that thing will ya?). It looks like Candace is going to the mall. My mom is available, so it says, but I know if I send her an IM, I will be waiting forever. And I can tell that my husband, who is only a few feet behind me at his computer, is not currently listening to any music. I am letting everyone know that Krystal turns 15 today! I mean, geez, how cool is that. The minute Natalie signs on I will swoop on her and tell her about my dream. No more bothering to call people, no letters and less e-mails. Some might say that all this is causing a down fall to relationships, I say no sir.  First off, in order to talk on the phone with any ONE person, I have to have time. First off, do I have 20 minutes to spend doing nothing else but chit chat? AND is that person going to be available at the same time? Assuming that both of us have the time, sometimes conversations drift and you forget what you called for anyway. Not to mention long distance fees as well as figuring out what time it is in Thailand. With e-mail (IM), I send what I want when I want and it sits until my e-mail has time to be read. At that point they write back when they have time, saying just what they want to say and send it along. How cool is that? No more being bothered while eating dinner, while watching a movie, or giving the kids a bath. Hell, I know it might sound weird to some but my husband and I send IM's to each other all the time, and we are in the same room!   We can send links back and forth, talk about the kids without them hearing, and just send an "I love you". Okay, so you might think we don't talk anymore, but I can tell you, Eric is happy for the quiet once in a while. I can talk like nobody's business.  I am waiting for my mother in law to get IM, we need to get her DSL first. I tell Eric that she would LOVE it. She will be able to keep in touch with everyone, especially the kids. Now, we are a Mac family, so I can easily voice or video chat. I can also send photos over my IM with ease.  I mean, wow!  Well, Krystal is trying to figure out where she wants to eat for her birthday dinner (what is it a special day or something?) she has changed her mind at least eight times already. We will watch the LA Galaxy on tv and then head to dinner, because frankly nothing comes before the Galaxy.

      We are waiting! Six days ago we put in a bid for ocean view property in Baja and still we wait. This is our dream. We NEED this property. It is where we will spend endless days on the beach, hosting parties, relaxing, and our retirement. Great, have I jinxed it now, does this mean they will say no? More money, okay okay okay, anything! Of course Eric and I kick ourselves for not getting in years ago when we first thought of it and it was MUCH cheaper. Well, hindsight right? So, we wait. Everyday we hope for an e-mail, a phone call, something. Nada! I feel as though life is on hold. Not quite as bad as when we bought our home, but close. Well, I am going to go wait some more. Wish us luck!

      Sometimes I feel as if I am going to go out of my head being at home with four kids. I count the hours until my husband is home, an adult, someone to help spread the madness. How can they be so dang cute and so annoying all at the same time? So, as I think, wow I need to run away, I think a I only have 55 days until I go back to work. Yikes! I love my job, don't get me wrong, I love my kids too. But too much of a good thing..... I try and remember that I probably (although I don't see how) get on their nerves as well. If we decide to go to the park, everyone is excited. If we go to the dog beach, woo hoo. If we go shopping, all right! But somewhere between the going and the being there, the outing loses some of its appeal and someone is complaining. So, easy enough to fix, hey you don't like it stay home and do chores. Ha! I showed them.
