      Bad sleep has been plaguing me, that's why I'm up right now.  Took the day off for work yesterday to celebrate a friend's birthday.  Much merriment was had by all, especially those covered in cake.  I just want something to be different for a change.  Maybe meet someone new in person.  It's easy for me to meet new people on the internet, but in actuality I'm as shy as a mouse, and not the modest kind.  Being more open in real life is something I need to work on, can't be so introverted as I currently am.  Anyway, I suggest the following albums for those who are into music of any sort or willing to push their unpushed boundaries:   Broken Social Scene - "You Forgot It In People"  The Postal Service - "Give Up"  These are probably for the people who don't post regularly on the Questionable Content forum, I doubt they'd read my blog anyway.  I bought my ticket for Modest Mouse, but the person I'm going with has to stave off walking for 6 weeks due to injury.  Not in time for the concert.  Current Music: BSS - cause = time

      Later today I have work.(actual time is 3:20 a.m. btw) I enjoy it, but I don't get to see my friends as often as I'd like to.  Saturday I got to hang out with a couple of them because they were closing up at a sandwich shoppe down the street.  Since I'm not going to Gen Con anymore I don't have much to look forward to this summer, except for maybe seeing Modest Mouse.  Need to get myself a ticket for that event.  Need to get myself back to Borders and go on a manga buying binge.  I realize this is the upside to having a job, buying whatever, whenever.  I miss people, places, and things.

      Super ultra tired I am.  Second day of being in the Italian salt mines.  Many pizzas were made, too many to count.  I also made fried calamari, veal parmigiana, grilled fish/chicken/vegetables, and bruschetta pomodoro.  I got off work at 10.  Apparently coffeeshops/everything else closes at 10.  I was going to get an iced coffee, but instead I got nothing.  Main reason why I'm super ultra tired.  In other news, UNDER17 has come to my attention.  They have the cutest vocals I have heard from any j-pop/rock band.  Thank you Kawaii-Radio.net for fulfilling the dreams of my ancestors!  I'ma go sleep. Keep on truckin'.

      Yesterday from 4:00 p.m to 9:00 p.m was my first day of work.  It went super well.  The first thing I did was cut vegetables.  I learned how to cut the vegetables their way, which is a good way.  About a half hour later I was making pizzas for the rest of the evening with Arturo.(chef who makes the pizza as well as entrees)  Making the pizza is a very easy task which requires little to no brainpower at all.  Really, I learned a lot and I think this is a great job.  Upon finishing work I walked to Borders and bought Trigun Maximum volume 1.  For over a year I've been waiting for it to come out.  I bought a poster of it at Anime Central last year and have been waiting for its arrival since then.  Luckily my local Borders finally restocked their manga section and actually organized everything.  This made me one happy camper.  I'ma play some text twist before going to sleep.  It's almost 4 in the morn, but I'm not tired at all.  Current Music: Volta Do Mar - breaking ribs for tom thayer

      The highlight of the day so far has been waking up at 1 in the afternoon and drinking a cup of coffee. Yeah, nothing interesting ever happens.  Things happen and that's about it.  I'd go back to sleep right now, but there's no point in even doing that.  Checking my quarter/semester/final grades and first day of work occur tomorrow.  Those are just things that happen.  There's no excitement to it, there's no Bob Costas coming out of the walls to give an interview pertaining to said events.   Being at home three days in a row pisses me off like none other.

      Text twist on Yahoo games is much fun.  Yeah, I'm bored, super bored.  So far today I sold my books back to the school, got crazy 88 dollars for them.  La Pucelle Tactics is a game I am in desperate need of.  Disgaea: Hour of Darkness was most awesome and it fulfilled my strategy/tactical turn-based RPG desires.  La Pucelle looks just as good, and from what I've heard, is even better.  I tip my hat to the good people at Nippon Ichi for lavishing their attention on the sRPG genre and giving them new dimensions of gameplay.  I haven't gotten decent sleep in days, and being super tired at 2 in the afternoon right now really shows it.  I need coffee.

      All I had was a math and US History + Lit final.  Both were a breeze.  The math final was mostly multiple choice and the US History/Lit final was an essay.  I managed to churn out a 3 page one.  Not my best work IMO, but I think it'll cut the mustard.  Tomorrow is the last day of finals for most people, but for me the storm is over.  Yesterday was good.  Ate lunch at Yummy Bowl (great thai/chinese restaurant) with my friend Agatha.  We left a mess on the table.  We are quite possibly two of the worst eaters.  At the end we just gave up and flung rice at each other.  Went minimal clothes shopping at H&M where I bought two striped short sleeve overshirts.  H&M is a great store that has good prices on clothing.  Keep on truckin'.  Current music: The Postal Service - such great heights   BTW, The Postal Service rocks.

      Woo, fun was had by all today, especially me.  I woke up at 9:30 A.M in shock because I was an hour and 30 minutes late for school.  Luckily today was just the final day for reviewing before finals so all was well and many-a-people rejoiced.  Upon arrival to school I was able to relax for a bit before 4th period started.  In chemistry class today as a fun end of the year activity we silvered bottles.  This meant we mixed dextrose, silver nitrate, potassium hydroxide, and NH3 (Ammonia), and put these liquids into glass bottles.  I brought a bottle of Bawls from home and used that.  So now I have a silvered blue bottle.  Now, I don't want to get off on a rant here,(like Dennis Miller) but glitter is something I cannot stand.  When I am given an invitation to a social gathering I do not want glitter pouring out from the envelope, all onto my pants and shirt.  The whole day I was at school, I was covered in glitter.  It's still there, and later I shall rid myself of whatever has remained.  As the last day of school came to a close, I pondered the great things which would come to pass next year.  Cooking class, Chicago urban history class, international relations class, all good stuff.  I am looking forward to being a senior.  It'll all go down well.  Adios Amoebas.

      Other than watching Jackie Brown, which was indeed a great movie, my weekend was blah.  Summer is just around the corner thoug, and once it comes, good times shall ensue.  This summer I will be working at an Italian restaurant called Bellavia.  I will have good hours that will enable me to stay up late and wake up late.  Hopefully by the end of the summer I will have made enough money to go to Gen Con and have some left over for Anime Reactor.  Gen Con is a great convention.  Lots of gaming goes on,and they have some of the best anime rooms.  Last year I went and had a mighty good time.  Sleep now takes place.

      First post baby, ohhh yeauhhh.  Finally found a blog that worked for me thanks to a fellow friend and poster on the prestigious Animenation forum.  Yesterday I purchased the latest issue of Newtype USA.  Lots of good stuff such as a Panyo Panyo Di Gi Charat poster and a Di Gi Charat DVD.  Can't wait for Ghost In The Shell 2 to hit theaters here in the U.S. this fall.  I am also looking forward to the Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex which looks very interesting.    On another note, Smarty Jones lost the Belmont Stakes today in a huge upset.  I'm not a big fan of horse racing, but I knew if Smarty Jones won, it would've been a big deal.  Blah...Not looking forward to Finals this coming week starting Tuesday.  Oh well, all I can do is try my best.  ..See you next time, space cowboy.

      Must buys for me this summer:  Gameboy Advance Final Fantasy Tactics Advance La Pucelle Tactics  Front Mission 4  I've been needing La Pucelle Tactics for a long time, and Front Mission 4 looks like an awesome mecha strat-rpg.  Been wanting a GBA for a long time as well.  Today I bought a case of Bawls (the best tasting energy drink IMO) and ate chinese food for dinner.    I'ma go sleep, got work from 11-3 today.
