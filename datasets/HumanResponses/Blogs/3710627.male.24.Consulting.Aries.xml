       Should I BLOG!!! Big decision to make I suppose!!!      I just saw some of my friends BLOGS and it quite impressed me. I never had a habit of maintaining a diary ever in my Life… Though I used to keep a backup of all mails I received in my life :) don’t know. Sometimes I am just a mad guy in that… I guess I still have my first email with me. As a guy who daily spends around 12 hours in front of an office system and come home and again spend another 5 hours in front of the system; A Blog wont do any harm :) But what should I BLOG about. Maybe I have lots of stories to tell most of them related to computers.   	Maybe I will tell about how it all started…… I was just a Mathematics buff till my 7th standard in school. I did my schooling in Loyola, Trivandrum. Probably I will tell you about my friends in another BLOG. It was in my 8th standard that I was first introduced to computers. We were given training in GW-Basic after school hours. The entire batches of 45 students were split into 2 batches, with weekly 3 hrs of class and 1 hr of practical. We had two 80186 Systems with a 5.25 inch 360 KB bootable system. If we had a bootable disc, we could boot up into DOS and work with GWBASIC. It was cool. Finally we ended up working in the Labs most of the evening and the mornings. We were the Kings of the computer lab. We learned up things which we were supposed to learn very quickly. Perhaps that was one subject were I ended up needing no studies to write an exam. I was so confident about what I knew. 	 	It was at that time I came across a DOS 5.0 Operating System Manual which was a thick book; it contained all I needed to know about DOS. I soon was playing with all sorts of commands including Debug; So many things!!! That was one period I learned real stuff.          By the time we passed out of school; out school had acquired a 286 system with 20 MB HDD (That was so huge a space at that time) with Win 3.1 and a couple of 386s… Anyway that was enough to get us started. The momentum I gained was enough I guess. It’s now around 10 years since that first time. I passed through lots of stages including some immature stages!!!!         Six yrs later I wrote my first Winsock program to Send and receive mails. I guess it had a great response from many parts of the world. So many people wrote to me regarding that program. But sometimes I feel I have made more damage than good by releasing those codes. Many people including me have misused the very code that I wrote for just the pleasure of doing it. All those are history; I got some pretty interesting offers during that period to continue with the kind of work I was doing; but somehow luckily or unluckily I got distracted from that.        Eight years later all that ended up in a search for a Job that was critical to my existence. Many unlucky companies didn’t take me in and finally I was into CTS; I now work with J2EE and Microsoft Technologies in Cognizant. And for some odd reason I love the work / culture that I found here. Don’t feel like jumping anywhere else. So that’s my short story. Now maybe I will start blogging something useful for the community. Here ends my First BLOG.
