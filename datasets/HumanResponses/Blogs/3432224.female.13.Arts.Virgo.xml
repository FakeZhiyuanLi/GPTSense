						   Hmm...  Well, grr, I keep forgetting to update this blog. Sure, I totally update my  xanga  a lot, with plenty of HUGE posts practically every day, but um, I just seem to forget about here. I guess it's because nobody ever sees this one. :D But I guess they will see it someday.  So, on that matter...should I start linking to it, from my Buddy Info? I've been doing pretty well at keeping my xanga a secret, although keeping it secret just makes everyone want to find out what it is, even more...you know? Exactly like that theme of those Tom Sawyer presentations we had to do last week - "In order to make a man or boy covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain..." Aaaah, it's scary when stuff you learn in school actually comes up in life. Not that I'd  need  school in order to recognize it, of course - but just, to show that *once in a while*, school isn't ABSOLUTELY uneducational....*shudder* quite creepy.  So...I must consider that, linking to this in my Buddy Info...Of course, if I did so, I'd have to update it a lot more...and with stuff that I wouldn't mind everyone seeing. SO it probably wouldn't be able to be as interesting as my xanga, haha...But then, as it is, my xanga is probably pretty boring. So is there a point to showing anyone my blog either? For some strange reason though, I think maybe so...  Hmmm...

						   Hmm...comparing this to xanga reminded me of the VERY long post that I put on xanga, last night. It was a post about the prom...*ahem*...since yesterday was mostly dominated by that event. (It was the night of the Poway High prom, and Neen went.)  Anyway, I just realized that loads of the kids at the prom last night must be going to church this morning...aaah! Wow though, I mean really - they must not have been able to get any sleep AT ALL! Because Neen didn't get home til 5 am...so...yeah. And then everyone else has to get up pretty early for church, right? Heheh, poor students...although I guess that all of them who take AP classes are probably used to not getting any sleep by now, anyway. :)

						   Ok then...hmm...  Comparing this to xanga...  I guess it could be better, perhaps, except for the fact that I actually know people on xanga, and I only know one person here. Oh well...I always tell people never to go to my xanga anyway, so does it matter?   Grr, not very colorful though! Nice and fawn - pug-colored, which is good...but...still. I guess I have to add pictures or something...hmm...

						     Ok....so I've sort of *forgotten* about this blog/site. Well, not  exactly  "forgotten"....but.....*shrugs*...  I guess I just don't like this site as much as xanga, for some strange reason...maybe it's because I'm not used to it....or because Tiffany & her youth-group friends all only use xanga, and are the active posters on mine....so....there's really more of a point to me posting there, than there is for me to post here. But oh well.  After all, Gary & Leg seem to post only on blogger....so I guess maybe I should get more used to this. But...I DO post those novel-sized entries on xanga each day 0:)...so....heh heh, never mind. For  some reason , I still uh, feel like linking to it from my AIM info...  But, anyway, today was our PUG PARTY!!! Woohoo! 13 wonderful friendly snorters....:D So PRECIOUS!! And, here's some pics (the group photos that we took at the end):         Ok, so the humans in this pic look really bad....particularly me, of course :P...well, although Kaitie Carter (the cute little blond girl in front) looks as adorable as ever....awww....but anyway, I posted this one because the pugs look pretty cute here. Although of course, not all the pugs at the party were in this pic - just some.... Ah yes, and you can't forget the Neen! There he is, lookin like a lil spy :P.         I like this one too, which is really similar....the main difference is that some of the humans look *slightly* better ( slightly  being the key word, totally), though the pugs generally don't....it's a bit disordered....but oh well.     Aaaaand....hmm, I don't feel like posting any more right now....so....later.
