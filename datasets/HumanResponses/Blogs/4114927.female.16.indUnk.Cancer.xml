        sick and tired of this world     there's no more air     tripping over myself, going nowhere     waiting, suffocating, no direction     i took a dive and     on the way down      i saw you, and you saved me from myself     and i won't forget the way you loved me     and on the way down      i almost fell right through     but i held on to you     been wondering why it's only me     have you always been inside waiting to breathe     it's alright, sunlight on my face     i wake up and yet, i'm alive 'cause     on the way down      i saw you, and you saved me from myself     and i won't forget the way you loved me     and on the way down     i almost fell right through      but i held on to you     i was so afraid of going under     but now, the weight of the world     feels like nothing, nothing     you're all i wanted     you're all i needed     .. and i won't forget the way you loved me.                 b r i t t a n i e
