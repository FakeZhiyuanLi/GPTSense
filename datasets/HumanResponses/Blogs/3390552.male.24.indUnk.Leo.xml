      Why do adults turn into complete morons when they become parents?  Do they forget the common principles of social etiquette?  Or do they just think their child is more disciplined than that?  Well let me clear things up for you new and soon-to-be parents, your toddler is no better than the next whiny, bratty kid that annoys the hell out of you while shopping at the grocery store. I will now go into details of why this second rant is being written.  I've decided to send in a proposal to the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America).  No children under the age of four are allowed in a PG-13 or R-rated film.  I don't care if they are accompanied by a parent or legal gaurdian.  An infant or young child is just not ready to be in a social setting of that level yet.  They don't understand that the movie is two hours long, there are no breaks and you have to be utterly silent the entire time. I went to see  The Day After Tomorrow  last night with my girlfriend.  The movie was okay; your typical end of the world, destroy it with some computer graphic special effects movie.  But could it have been better had my movie going experience not been tarnished by an 11-month-old baby crying the whole time?  It lasted from opening destruction sequence to end credits. Here is the reason this time was worse than usual.  The parents not only weren't embarrassed by the situation, they were laughing at it.  They thought it was funny.  And they sat in the middle of the section.  Could they not have chosen an aisle seat so that, if the child began to disturb the patrons around them, they could effortlessly leave their seat and tend to the weeping youngster?  No, instead it was a tag team effort of comforting the brat until it stopped crying.  Once this occurred, parent number one would begin his long and tedious trek across the row to his seat.  And all kidding aside, the moment he would sit down, the kid would start crying again.  So parent number two would get up, start side-stepping down the row, and hang out on the side with a crying baby.  Good use of sixteen bucks there.  Hope you enjoyed the show. The baby obviously didn't want to see this movie.  He had heard the reviews and felt it was not his type of movie.  He probably prefers light, romantic comedies with Kate Hudson or Reese Witherspoons.  Leave the child at home with a baby-sitter or MTV, this method worked for me. So my proposal is no person under the age of four will be allowed to see a PG-13 or R-rated movie.  If you can't get a baby-sitter, you can't go out.  It is that simple.  You won't enjoy the movie, your kid won't enjoy the movie and we, the paying audience, certainly won't enjoy the movie.  Tell me what you think about this idea.  I might really send it in.  I'm on a role with getting policies changed.

      Now that we all know what    Getting Kicked in the Junk by Vegas 2004    is, we can proceed with further details.  This trip has been in the works for about three months now.  It started out as a crazy idea and we ran with it.  As the days wind down to zero hour, the passengers are starting to wonder if it's really going to happen.  The reason I say this is because we have had a few scares.  They have been all types: marital, financial, even family strife has put this trip in jeopardy.  We are two weeks out and only one final problem remains.  It is the financial.  Not all of us are going to have the monster bankrolls we had imagined.  So I have come up with an idea. Churches and schools will always do a car wash fundraiser to produce extra money for a trip.  Well, that may work for them, but we have lives to attend to.  So here is my proposal.  We plead to you, our devoted readers.  Please let us know of anything that can be done to raise money for our trip.  However, don't tell us to get jobs.  Seventy-five percent of us already have one of those. Look at this as a pledge drive of sorts.  We will continue to keep you in hysterics with our humorous entries as long as you send the money in.  Just think of how many blogs we will have after we get back from Las Vegas.  It's the city that never sleeps...oh wait.  Windy, no that's not it.  City of Brotherly Love, definitely not.  Sin city, that's it.  The stories that we will retell to our fans will keep you going for at least six months. However, this will not be able to occur unless you help.  All we ask is for a dollar a day so little James over in Woodland West will be able to supersize his order of fries.  Is this too much to ask?  I think not.  So please send all referrals to me in the comments field or James, Clint or Chad at the following sites:  urlLink jamesu2.blogspot.com   urlLink imout.blogspot.com   urlLink giveittomelance.blogspot.com   We appreciate anything you can give, large or small.  We will be leaving on June 10, so please have all checks sent in before this date.  God bless and keep praying those pocket Aces hold up.

      Since my last entry was such a downer, I've decided to tell an uplifting, funny story about my day.  Some of you may have already heard about this from my roommate James (whose website is  urlLink jamesu2.blogspot.com ). As you may have read, Duff Elementary wronged me.  They took away my legacy.  I said I would do something about it and I have.  Although it wasn't exactly the public revolt I had in mind, I still got the job done. Here's what happened.  I took my thugs James and Chad, marched down to Duff and demanded something be done to rectify the situation. Okay, that's not exactly what happened.  James and Chad just went to watch, secretly believing I wouldn't go through with the outlandish affair, we drove in a Honda Accord and I played the pity card.  It got so bad, at one point I actually said, "You removed some of the children's handprints," wait for the small pause, "and I was one of those children."  By this time James and Chad were laughing as much as two people can laugh without having a serious medical problem occur.  James was bent over in his chair, holding his stomach because the situation was essentially so funny, it was gut-wrenching.  Chad had to leave the office and take a few seconds to compose himself in the hall.  He came back in the room with his sunglasses on to hide his puffy, tear-filled eyes. I explained in a very nice and pleading tone that I wished to replace my handprints and name.  Principal Owens, who was the vice-principal when I attended Duff, was very complacent with the circumstance and was more than happy to oblige. When the three of us left, we realized we were grown men, one of us married in fact, and we had spent fifteen minutes of our lives addressing something quite meaningless in the grand scheme of things, yet it was the principle of the thing.  We laughed all the way to the car about what had just gone down.  It was great.  Definetely one of the funniest moments of my life.  I wish more of you could have been there to see me take the man down.

      Coincidence.  Some believe in random acts of chance.  Others feel everything happens for a reason.  They truly feel each moment of our life is planned and controlled by God.  Where do you stand on this issue?  By definition, a coincidence is a sequence of events that, although accidental, seems to have been planned or arranged. Let me explain my opinion about this issue.  First thing first, I am open to reversals.  If someone can provoke doubt in my mind, I will contemplate a reversal.  However, on this particular topic I feel strongly that coincidences do occur.  I think I need to emphasize something before I go on though.  I believe God has created us with certain talents and abilities which are specific to each of us.  He also has a master plan for each of us.  Yet, we are the ones using these talents and abilities and making our own decisions.  He just points us in the right direction.  It is our free will which drives us toward our destiny.  Now back to the topic at hand. Here are a few examples of what I would consider falling into the catagory of coincidence:  1. Thomas Jefferson and John Adams died on the same day.  2. Pitcher Warren Spahn, of the Milwaukee Brewers, pitched a no-hitter on his 40th birthday.  3. Then there are the many coincidences between the assassinations of Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy.  So what of these "coincidences."  Are they just rare cases of an odd occurance that God decided to let take place because of his celestial sense of humor.  Many people die on the same day, yet two presidents of the United States who served back-to-back administrations.  Okay I'll buy that, but what about a pitcher throwing a no-hitter on his birthday.  It is such a rare act of excellence, that to throw a no-hitter on one particular day out of 365 is much to random to be planned.  What about the many coincidences surrounding the assinations of two of the most famous U.S. presidents.  Still all part of God's design.  What for?  What significance does this play in our daily walk with Christ that He should plan such an unsystematic act? Joanna doesn't believe in the percentages of a winning and losing hand in poker shown on World Poker Tour.  She is constantly reminding me of every certain hand that the long shot, the one card needed, wins.  Well, my response is we never remember when our pocket Aces hold up.  It is only when they are beaten by a Queen-Three off-suit or an Eight-Nine off-suit that we can remember it with such great detail. Is this the same with an instance of coincidence?  If it happened any other time, or any other way in fact, would it be remembered as clearly?  I don't know.  I honestly can't answer that.  Some can remember Nolan Ryan had seven no-hitters throughout his career, but can anyone recite the dates of those games without the assistance of the Internet or a baseball reference guide? Coincidences happen more than one might think, but are they really coincidences?  Does God plan all of this just to give us topics of conversation that can include his divine presence.  I would definetly like feedback on this one.  I want to hear where you are on the coincidence topic.  Please post your comments and I will try to respond to them.  You might even be able to get a reversal out of me if you try hard enough. Again, I am not saying I don't believe that God has a hand in our lives.  Although I do feel some things happen randomly and He has no particular interest in the outcome.  Say rolling seven dice seven times in a row and hitting seven each time.  Random act of coincidence or God?  I say coincidence, but who really knows.

      As I said from day one, this would be a form of venting for me.  I can release the stress in my life by explaining the things that bother me about society through my blog.  Well, here is my first rant.  My close friends will likely think this is directed towards Michael Eisner or George Lucas.  However it's not.  It is actually towards an unlikely target: Duff Elementary.  That's right.  My old alma mater of elementary schools. Friday night I was asked to babysit my little cousin Major.  After a quick ideo (that's video for those not in the know) we went to Duff.  I pulled him in his wagon and he played on the playground.  Well, I like to treat Major like a tutor of mine.  I teach him the finer things in life, like how to cheer, "Hey Nomar," correctly and the proper way to say Halle Berry.  So, I decided to take him to see the class project my sixth grade class left to the school to remember us by.  It is a sidewalk from the east side of the building around to the gym.  The students put their hand prints in the wet cement and wrote their names.  Major and I started at the gym side of the sidewalk and took our way towards my imprints.  At each section I would stop and tell Major something about the person whose hands we were looking at.  If I didn't remember the person, I would make up a ludicrous story that either made Major laugh or ask for the last two minutes of his childhood existence back. As we drew closer to the end of the sidewalk, which is where my slab of concrete was located, a feeling of excitement and remorse began to fall upon me.  I had thought about all the funny and regretful moments of K-6 grade.  However I noticed that I had passed where my block should have been.  In fact, there were three new blocks of cement.  Duff Elementary had replaced my hand prints with a new sidewalk section. Can you believe this?  My legacy, gone.  How will other grade school students know I was a part of the class of 1992?  What do I have to show for seven years of education at Duff Elementary.  Knowledge, I don't think so. Believe me, they will be seeing my face again on Monday.  It's going to be a reunion of reckoning.  I will demand my hand prints to be replaced along with a Matt Cook written right between the oversized palms.  You may ask, "What if they don't comply?"  Well, I haven't gotten that far yet, but I will come up with something.  Maybe we'll have an old-fashion sit in.  Yeah, that's it.  Let the days of Martin Luther King and the civil rights activists reign.  I will sit and pester them with my verbal protests until they cave.   Let freedom ring, let freedom ring, by God Almighty, let freedom ring . As I said in my first entry.  Some of my opinions don't always make sense.  However, they are important to people like myself and my mom, who shares my opinion about renaming the Woodland West Recreation Center after Dottie Lynn.  But that is another blog for another day. Until next time, may all your pocket pairs hold up.

      Today is a big day in the poker world.  It is the first day in a week long stint of high stakes, big action card playing.  Today begins the World Series of Poker.  Woo-hoo.  The World Series is the mother of all poker tournaments.  It's the only poker tournament in the world that could be shown year round on ESPN2 and would have the same ratings everytime.  Nobody wants to miss the hilarious verbal banter exchanged between Sam Grizzle and Phil Hellmuth Jr. (the crybaby of poker).  Grizzle even went into song last year to crack Hellmuth's playing abilitiy. Thanks to the World Series of Poker, hundreds, including my cousin Clint, now copy the Sam Farha look, which is an unlit cigarette dangling from the mouth during play.  Farha does this because, as of last year, the World Series became smoke free.  Farha would use the same cigarette until it seemed its luck had run out.  He would then dispose of the "unlucky cigarette," grab a new one and start over. The World Series is a dream.  It is my dream.  I will some day be at the World Sereis of Poker.  Now don't mistake what I just said.  I will BE at the World Series.  This doesn't necessarily mean I will be playing.  I think I'm good, but I'm probably not that good yet. I did however play in a 28 person tournament last Tuesday night and I finished in second place.  I was very proud of myself.  Though, I'm sure my friends are tired of hearing about it.  Said poker tournament is also where I obtained my new nickname: I AM.  Clint called me and asked if we were playing poker.  I responded in a completely unoffensive tone with the words, "I am."  Yet due to a communication break down among friends, these two words set off a chain reaction that could have potentially threatened the downfall of the Vegas trip, which will from now on be titled  Three Days of Getting Kicked in the Junk 2004 . So, to let you know, I am extremely excited about the next few days because I can feel the poker playing in the air.  Bluffs will be abundant, check raises will be feared and the theme of the week will be  Anyone Can Win .

      This is the beginning.  I have begun.  It's started. A few of my friends have their own blogs, so I decided to start my own.  Through my blog I will be dispensing lessons on life, posting film reviews and venting the dislikes of society I come across on a weekly (if not daily) basis.  I have many opinions that my friends think are funny, yet not practical.  I will not likely touch on anything too emotional because, basically, that's just not who I am.  So don't look for any life altering quotes.  I like to have fun and travel.  I am very childish and will probably not grow up anytime soon.  Life is short and I will enjoy it while I can. I hope you enjoy this and I will try to keep it updated with any news that might seem interesting or funny.

      We had finally made it.  A bedroom.  Who knew a hotel room could feel this good.  Yet, something was wrong with the room.  Maybe it was the fact there was only one queen bed and five of us.  Maybe it was the plaster board windows with the ongoing blinking of neon outside.  It could have been the fact that the room hadn't been refurnished since the World Series of Poker had been started thirty-five years before.  It was probably a combination of all of this along with five guys who were cranky and needed some serious sleep.  We ordered a rollaway and slept two on the bed, one on the rollaway and two on an air mattress.  We had to shift the bed mattress slightly over the air mattress to fit the rollaway. The feeling of noon woke us and we were ready to begin a full day in Las Vegas (Days don't begin until noon in Las Vegas anyway).  We decided that although having a room for $25 a night in the Horseshoe Casino would be super, it was probably best to just go to our hotel room that I had secured through the Hilton employee discount.  It would be more expensive, by about two dollars a person, but it was worth it.  Chad and I went to the registration desk to pay the bill and we were greeted by a wonderful surprise. The young man asked, "Was this a comped room?" Chad answered, "Yeah."  This wasn't a lie.  It was comped at half price.  We didn't know the kid was going to give it to us for free. "Well, then you are done.  Let me validate your parking," he said. Our first night in Vegas was comped.  How excellent was that.  You hear stories about people getting comped rooms, but you never expect to get one in your lifetime. The day was mostly uneventful, however we did play in a $60 tournament that night.  The tournament was at a casino called Sam's Town.  It is a place that probably was in the middle of nowhere about twenty years ago.  It has a casino, hotel, restaurant, lounge and bowling alley.  (By the way, Harrah's recently purchased Horseshoe Casino and in Shreveport, Harrah's has moved to the Horseshoe and Sam's Town is now where they used to be.) All five of us entered the tournament.  We ended up with about 48 people in the game.  Chad was the first to go out.  He didn't even make it to the big blind.  Bart was next.  Like the whole trip, no one really knows how he did during the game.  He just shows up and says how much money he either has won or lost.  Clint was looking the best out of all of us at the break.  He might have even been close to being chip leader.  However, in No-limit Texas Hold'em, things can change rather quickly.  In about three hands, Clint went from a lot of money to not much money.  He was third to go out of our group. I had a good chip lead at my table and the guy on my right went all in.  It was only another $200 to call (I had probably $5,000).  I was pot committed and called.  I had 4-5 off suit.  He had pocket 9's.  He had this one in the bag.  The flop came with 7-4-4.  The odds of him losing were not great and I actually felt bad for the guy when nothing else came for him.  I wasn't supposed to win and it wouldn't have hurt me financially.  Yet, luck plays a factor in this game and it was not on his side. The field was eventually dwindled to ten.  We moved to the final table and drew for seats again.  James and I were one seat away from each other.  James was on the short stack the whole time we were at the final table. The pay structure looked like this: 1st-$1,000; 2nd-$750; 3rd-$380; 4th-$220; 5th-$100. Before we started the final table, an older woman, who had a twin at the table with us, asked if we would like to chop it so that everyone got $100.  Seeing that I was the chip leader at the table, I was very against this.  However, I didn't want to say anything because I was new to all this and didn't know if it was common to chop it like that.  James approved the deal very quickly because he was worried he wasn't going to place in the money.  After a vote, we decided not to chop it thanks to the guy who was second in chips.  He didn't want to and I thanked him for it.  The old hag's sister then asked if we could change it to where everyone got at least $50.  I was okay with that.  They changed the pay structure to resemble this: 1st-$900; 2nd-$700; 3rd-$350; 4th-$170; 5th-$100; 6th-10th-$50. We began to play some more cards.  I was on fire.  I was hitting everything.  Making good calls.  Laying down monster hands.  It was wonderful.  Player by player, James and I were moving up the ranks.  However, James was clinging by just a few chips.  He ended up lasting until 5th place.  This left me with an older gentleman and the abominable twins.  We took a five minute break and I was sweating with anxiety.  I was so nervous, I was uncontrollably shaking.  When we sat back down, the double mint twins asked if I wanted to chop it a final time. "This is the last chance," she naggingly said. "I'm sorry but I don't want to," I replied with frustration.  It wasn't fair to make me the scapegoat for not chopping it.  I wanted to know how good I was.  After about ten minutes I started to wish I had chopped it.  I became low on chips from a few bad calls. I won a lot of them back though in a big hand that knocked out one of the sisters.  I had pocket J's.  She had 9-10 off suit.  I called her all-in bet after the flop, which was Q-4-J.  I had trip J's and she was on a straight draw.  The turn was a King.  She had her straight.  I needed a miracle card.  The river flipped over and it was a Queen.  I had hit a full house.  Needless to say, the ice maiden with frosty white hair was not happy.  She got up and whispered something to her sister.  I think she told her to tear me apart. It came down to me and her.  I was sweating profusely.  My shaking had gotten worse by this point.  The final hand came quickly after we began heads-up play.  Lady luck went all-in and started the stare down.  I looked at my cards and saw an A-8 off suit.  Not a hand I want to call for all my chips.  I asked her to count it down.  I would be left with very little.  I debated in my mind for what seemed like an eternity.  I finally said to myself, "You've made it this far.  You have proven that you are good.  Call." I moved my chips in and called her bet.  She flipped over Q-9 of clubs.  The flop gave me an 8 and nothing else came on the turn or river.  I had won my first tournament ever.  I was on a high.  I gave Clint, Chad and Bart $100 each (we had made a deal that if anyone won the tournament, the others got $100) and I tipped the dealer $60. We were living large.  I had won $900 and we decided to celebrate at Bellagio.  While there, we saw Jason Alexander (George on  Seinfeld ).  He was being very friendly with all the fans and generally seemed to care about what they were saying.  The day had been good and I was going to enjoy the greatest sleep of my life.

      We began gambling at a staple in Vegas.  No, it wasn't the Bellagio or Ceaser's Palace.  No, not Horseshoe either, although we did end up there.  It was a little place called The El Cortez.  The El Cortez is down the street from Downtown.  It's not even considered a downtown casino.  It is bad.  I mean really bad.  The only reason we started there was because they have three dollar blackjack, which also had the flush bonus bet option (which is when both of your cards are the same suit), and three dollar craps.  It is a place of cheap finance. Bart rolled into town about an hour after we arrived and met us at the El Cortez.  I did have an extremely scary conversation with an inebriated man about Texas Hold'em and seven card stud.  I wanted to watch a 1-2 stud game to see if it was worth my time in trying out.  The man stood next to me and proceeded to teach me how to play the game.  For the record, I've been playing seven card stud since I was seven.  He told me, with very stinky breath, that true poker players don't share their cards.  Hold'em is for youngens who don't know how to play real poker. "You never share your cards," he said.  "Hold'em is just young wanna be's.  You never share your cards." "Yeah, I got it.  Don't share your cards," is what I wanted to say.  Instead it was more like, "Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Yep.  Okay."  And of course, none of my friends are around to save me.  Instead, I had to slowly back away while he rambled on about not sharing your cards. We stayed and gambled for about another hour and then went to Binion's Horseshoe Casino to try out the poker room and see the picture of the winner from the 2004 World Series of Poker. Chad and I were at one table sitting next to each other.  James was at a table by himself.  Clint and Bart were at another table.  According to Clint, "Bart was down by the idiots and I was by the retards."  Clint sat next to a guy who actually vomited on himself at the table. After about an hour of gambling Clint and Bart had run out of money, Chad decided to quit while he was ahead and I was moved to James table.  I only had about $60 when I sat down.  Not too long after I got there, a very drunk and beligerent young man decided to grace us with his presence.  He was about 300 pounds of pure fat and flab.  Don't get me wrong, his arms were the size of tree trunks, but there wasn't much to it.  He could have crushed me, but only by actually falling on me.  He was immediately hated.  He wouldn't shut up, he was obnoxious and he kept saying how great he was.  You know, if you're so good, why are you sitting at the cheapest table in the house?  Because you suck, that's why.  James was the one that actually started the trash talking, but it really escalated when I was in a bad beat with the guy. Fatso would pre-flop rais everything, and I do mean everything.  He pre-flop raised 2-3 offsuit.  I flop top pair and he hits two pair.  Of course I lost, but it wasn't because I was the bad player.  When he flipped over two pair against my jacks with an ace kicker, I was astonished.  How could someone pre-flop raise with 2-3 offsuit.  I decided to say something. "You have got to be the worst player at the table to play that," I blurted. "Is that a fact," he responded. This was his phrase.  He would say this to every comment. I came back with, "Yes it is.  But I'll leave it up to a vote."  I chose to let the other players at the table back me up.  "By a show of hands, who thinks this guy is the worst player?"  I immediately sent my arm sky high. One guy near James said, "I don't know.  That's a bold statement."  I was thinking this moron was going to defend the 2-3 offsuit.  Then he said, "But I think you are right.  He is the worst player here." Then a little, old man said, "You haven't seen me play yet." I couldn't help but laugh.  "No sir," I said, "You are way better than this guy." During this humorous exchange, fattie had been messing with James and poking him.  After the third prod, James shouted, "Don't f*#%ing touch me again." The guy got defensive and asked what James was going to do about it.  James told him he would take him outside.  The guy told him he would tear James apart.  Then, in Bart's finest hour, he leaned in from behind both of them and said, "You're not going to do a thing."  I was more proud of him then than I have ever been. After the hand was over I only had about $25 left and I was on tilt (big surprise).  I told everyone the next big hand I get I am going all-in.  It just so happened it was the next hand.  Flabby raised pre-flop (of course) and about three people called, including me.  It ended up with James winning the pot, thank goodness.  Everyone was pissed at Stay-Puffed and I had lost all my money.  James began putting his chips up to leave so we could go to our room. During all of this Chad had gotten a room comped for half-price at the Horseshoe.  We had decided we couldn't stay up all night.  We were going to head up to the nice room and crash for the evening. I began to stand up and Fattie Fatterson said something about how I was out of chips.  I couldn't hold it in anymore.  There is only so much one man can take.  I looked at him with the darkest eyes I could muster and I firmly and deliberately spoke these words.  "I may be the smallest guy at this table, but I will still kick your ass."  I got up, left the table and heard his overstated question, "Is that a fact?"  James left to go cash in and Chad was helping him.  Bart, Chad, James and I were ready to rumble.  However, Clint was not completely on board with us.  He decided to do damage control.  He talked the guy down and met us by the exit.  We ended up not fighting, but we were ready to.  There is nothing like having a story about the first night in Vegas and getting into a brawl.  As we left to get the car, a guy called us a crew.  I've been waiting for that my whole life.  We were a crew.  How cool is that?  We then got the car and went to the room.  End of day one, or is it...

      Our story continues with four exhausted young men cruising down I-40 through Alburquerque.  We were running behind the schedule, so James said we could only have 23 minutes for lunch.  This was a huge cut from the hour lunch we had been promised three days earlier. We decided to stop at the evil empire of restaurants, better known as McDonald's.  I call McDonald's this because first of all they did away with the supersize deal.  That was a good deal.  What was wrong with it?  Because people are fat.  That's not McDonald's fault, now is it.  The second reason they are the evil empire is because they only care about money, like most big businesses.  Sure, they give money to charities, like that Ronald McDonald house (except has anyone ever actually seen where this guy lives, I don't think it exists).  They only give to charities to look good to the general public. Let me give an example of their wickedness.  While at this McD's, an old lady asked for an empty cup to make a rootbeer float out of.  She had ordered ice cream and was going to put it in the cup and fill it up with rootbeer.  The manager told her she couldn't do that.  She would have to pay for a cup.  Can you believe that?  It's a piece of cardboard that costs them seven cents to manufacture.  Give the lady a cup for goodness sakes. I was so astonished and disgusted at this display of poor customer service and greed that I decided to do something about it.  I stepped right into the men's room, did my business (number 1) and then proceeded to break the urinal by flushing it.  That's right.  I showed them.  It started overflowing and didn't stop.  That is street justice. Actually, I felt really bad when that happened because then Pedro had to come mop it up.  Sorry Pedro, my bad. I also might add Clint got a good view of all this from the stall.  He was trying to clean out the pipes, but he had plumbing problems for about three days straight. After lunch we decided to have another go at horse racing.  Chad was unstoppable.  I tried to bring myself luck when he was rolling by rubbing the Buddha.  That is what I call it when I start rubbing Chad's belly and willing him to lose.  It kind of creeps him out, but this time it wasn't doing anything.  Chad couldn't lose.  I at one time owed him five dollars (betting fifty cents a horse).  We had a double or nothing bet and when my single horse of seven only needed one more square to his two, six, eight, eleven, and twelve horse only needing one square, I decided to up the ante.  If one of his horses won, I owed him twelve.  If my horse pulled it off, he would owe me five dollars.  I was rolling the dice.  I threw them into the cardboard box.  Tensions were high.  Every eye (even the drivers) was on what would fall.  Then one of the dice didn't make it into the box.  I immediately erupted with, "no roll, no roll!"  So we rolled again.  It was a six, sad.  I lost again and that is when I gave up horse racing for a whole hour. During that hour Clint and I got into a discussion about Indians.  Clint is himself part Indian.  As we passed a small community of adobes, Clint made sure it was his job to inform us that his people are forced to live in the small clay cubicles. I felt it was necessary to point out that Indians lived in adobes before the white man even came to America.  Clint responded with, "Yeah, but now you force us to live in them and sell jewelry and fireworks." Since we were running behind the schedule, Chad opted to catch up to the clock.  However his method was not without flaws.  He would try and speed up to faster travelers by slamming down the gas peddle and power accelerating down the highway.  You could actually feel how fast the gas was being pumped into the engine.  Chad would find one way or another to stop every 45 minutes.  Either bathroom breaks or power accelerating the gas tank empty. We finally entered Las Vegas, right on time too.  Exactly 19 hours after leaving, we were worn out and in need of a good shower.  Yet, it was time to start gambling.  While traveling down the strip, a car full of young women were checking us out (Clint thinks they were only looking at him though).  They honked at us and wanted us to follow them, but Clint would have none of it.  Even despite James' nagging about how he needed this.  We were on a mission: to kick Vegas in the junk.  Our tale will continue here.

      Even before sunrise, I could hear James on the phone with Clint. "Is Chad there yet?" A short pause and then, "Well we got to get going, we have a schedule to keep." The schedule. It was a vicious, unforgiving thing. We lived by the schedule and we died by the schedule. James' schedule was down to the last detail. Eat lunch for an hour in Albuquerque and end up in Las Vegas 19 hours after we left. However, things didn't start off smoothly. While driving down 180 (Division), we were about to get onto 820 and Clint remembered something very important...our fifth passenger. Yes, this was a road trip for five going out and four coming back. We were going to take a small plastic test tube full of the ashes of Clint's dad. Clint wanted to spread the remains of his father out on the open road. This delayed the trip 20 minutes, but everyone was okay with it because of the circumstances. In Amarillo we saw a glimpse of the cadillac ranch. That was a big highlight considering there is nothing in west Texas. To pass the time during the depressing and bleak drive through flat nothingness, Chad brought along home-made horse racing. The rules of the game are simple. You roll two dice and whatever number comes up, that horse moves up one space. To win the race, a horse must move a certain number of times. For the number two and twelve, it is only two. For seven it is six times. We would bet fifty cents on a horse. The pot eventually got up to $20. Chad finally won that session. Afterward, we discussed where to spread the ashes that were sitting in the middle console like nothing more than a garage door opener or a lighter. We narrowed it down to two possible options. Either in the desert of New Mexico, which is where he lived, or over the side of Hoover Dam. After listing the pros and cons of each burial site, we still didn't know which location was more beneficial to the dearly departed. So, we let fate make the decision for us. We let the dice have the choice. If it was an even number, Hoover Dam. If it was an odd, New Mexico. I shook it up in my palm, gave Clint a last glance to make sure he was ready and I then let it fly. It spun around for what seemed like a mile (on a road trip, time is measured in distance traveled, not by a watch or clock). Finally, it stopped. The small cube revealed two white dots. An even number. Hoover Dam it was. Once this choice was over with, there was an abnormal and ackward silence in the car. No one knew what to say. So I decided to listen to a cd that was given to me by Joanna. The title was Viva Las Vegas 2004. I was on the first song and James asked me, "What are you listening to?" "A cd Joanna made for me," I answered. "What does it have on it?" "I'm only on the first song," I said. "Well, what is it?" "The Sopranos theme song." Immediately Clint and Chad sat up. "Oh yeah," they all said. "Let's listen to it." So we put the cd in. The following is the list of the songs: 1. Soprano's Theme Song, 2. Viva Las Vegas, 3. The Gambler, 4. a country song about chasing the wind and cowboys like us, 5. Danke Shoen, 6. Bare Naked Ladies poker song, 7. Pat Green song about Texas, 8. On the Road Again, 9. Everybody Loves Somebody, 10. My Way and 11. Come Away With Me. Everyone was getting into the music. In fact, by song seven, we thought it was the greatest cd ever arranged by a girlfriend. However, by the time Dean Martin came around, you could tell 3/4 of the audience were starting to lose interest. Once the cd was over, we all decided that they should have stopped listening at about track nine. I love the whole cd and I haven't taken it out of my cd player yet. By this time we rolled into Alburquerque and were ready to eat lunch. I will continue with day one in my next entry.

      We did it.  We drove to Las Vegas, stayed four days, and didn't pay for a single night in a hotel room.  This feat has been tried before and few, if any, have succeeded.  This is just one tale of what occurred at  Getting Kicked in the Junk by Vegas 2004 .  Over the next few days I will be telling many stories of what happened in Sin City.  I will be breaking the cardinal rule of Vegas though.  That rule is: what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.  Unless you need a prescription to get rid of it.  Oh, I don't want to divulge any more yet.  You will just have to wait.  Until next time...

      Has the status of applauding diminished so much that anything can deserve an applause and standing ovations mean nothing more than good job?  Is it just America that insults the applause or has all of society lowered the standards of the standing ovation?  I have observed this trend over the last few years and feel it must be stopped.  Let me remind you of what is and what is not deserving of praise by clapping. Let us begin with live performances.  This is very deserving of applause.  The people that perform before a live audience earn the glorification they recieve.  They train and practice for months to get one performance right.  Anything can go wrong and there are no corrections for mistakes.  The entertainers I am referring to are the following types: musicians (both vocal and instrumental), stage actors, dancers, athletes and public speakers.  They are to be applauded at the completion of a magnificent achievement, such as a complicated musical number or the setting of a record. However, these men and women are only worthy of standing ovations if what they have done can be considered truly spectacular.  If it is anything less, clapping is what should be given.  It can be clapping that lasts an hour and a half, but no one should stand.  The standing ovation is the apex of applause.  If it is given out like it is now, the meaning behind it will depreciate. I went to see Jerry Seinfeld perform a few months ago, and when the audience saw him step out on stage, they erupted and flew out of their seats.  The applause that ensued was tremendous.  He hadn't done anything yet.  Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of Seinfeld.  I love his show.  I own his book, DVD and CD.  He is a comic genius.  Yet, does he deserve a standing ovation for stepping on stage?  No.  Save it for the end of the performance because he will definetly deserve it then. Moving on to recorded performances.  What I mean by this is a movie.  What I have noticed lately is people are beginning to give rounds of applause at the rolling of the credits in a movie theater.  Why are you doing this?  Who are you clapping to?  The actors can't hear you.  The producers aren't there.  Are you applauding the AMC employees for switching the reels so well?  Way to flip that switch at the second cigarette burn (If you don't know what a cigarette burn is, watch  Fight Club ). Here is why you don't applaude a film.  Because they didn't get it right the first time.  The director says action for each scene at least four times.  The actor can correct any missed cue or forgotten line.  The editor takes the best footage out of eighteen takes and splices it together.  A movie is a collection of great scenes that were taken many times to get just right. The way to show you enjoy a movie is to buy another ticket and watch it again.  They rate the success of a film by money.  Cash is what fuels Hollywood.  It's all they think about.  They don't care if you are cheering at the end of the movie.  They want you to go to the local toy store and buy the new Tickle Me Spidey that has been made to coincide with Spiderman 2. Here is what I am saying.  Don't clap for a movie.  It is retarded.  No one can hear you except me.  And frankly, it pisses me off.  You're a moron if you applaude a movie.  So stop doing it.  Also, don't give everything a standing ovation.  This will just give people who aren't deserving bragging rights to something they shouldn't have earned.  They will pull a Reuben.  (James got that)

      It is only a week until we depart for Las Vegas.  Woo-hoo.  I am getting very excited.  This trip could end up being the greatest road trip since Joseph and Mary tried staying at an inn without a reservation and she ended up going through labor in the barn.  On the other hand, the four of us may never talk to each other after the 18-hour drive back to Arlington.  Who knows?  That's what makes it so thrilling. I am also looking forward to this trip because I get to see my brother.  He and I don't always get along, but I enjoy seeing him and I think we can be nice for the better of the trip. Well, we have endured all the hitches I think there are going to be.  The only snag I could see occurring would be Chad getting a job with Wells Fargo and not being able to go.  Wait, what am I saying.  Oh...that was good.  I needed a good laugh for the day. Even with the loss of Clint's dog, Boon, he will still be able to afford the trip.  Everything is in place.  All the wives and other legal guardians have given the okay and we are ready to hit the road.  If anyone has good road trip music suggestions, please let me know.  We get to take four cds each.  I haven't decided what music to bring.  I might put the boys through hell and make them listen to Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra the whole time.  James would enjoy it, but Clint and Chad would probably shoot themselves by disc two and leave their dead carcasses in the desert for the buzzards to devour. Best road trip ever!

      "We have to leave by 8:00 a.m.," was the last comment heard before I closed my eyes and fell into a deep sleep. At 8:34 a.m. I was pretending to be dead to the world so no one would wake up. I wanted to sleep a little longer. By 8:42 a.m., Chad was beginning to stir. We were on the road not a minute past 9:08 a.m. Not too bad if you ask me.  Our first stop was Hoover Dam. Chad, being the history buff that he is, gave us the dam tour. "The Hoover Dam was built in 1846 by the Comanche Indians." The rest of his tour was bogus.  We were all taken aback by the awesome sight that the Hoover Dam is. If you have not seen this amazing achievement I recommend you do. It is something that should not be passed up. We made our way to the middle of the dam. When we got to a nice spot, Clint began to open the vile that his father was resting in. James asked if anything should be said and Clint immediately rejected the idea.  "Well, here we go," Clint said as he dumped the tube over and let the ashes drift away with the wind. It only took a few seconds for the awkwardness to set in. None of us knew what to say. We never met the guy and Clint didn't want to talk about it. We stood there in silence for about fifteen seconds and then James attempted to get things moving by saying, "So, do you want any pictures?"  After sightseeing for another twenty minutes, we got in the car and started the long journey home. We didn't stop again for anything besides gas or a bathroom until lunch. We ate at an Indian Casino about ten miles outside of Albuquerque. "Did we gamble?" you might ask. Does Clint fold pocket aces? Yes.  Clint also won $20 off of Chad from proposition bets. One wager was Clint couldn't throw a pebble to the highway from about thirty yards away. Mark one for Clint. The second bet was even tougher. From fifteen yards away, Clint had to hit a speed limit sign with a rock. Clint nailed it right in the middle of the sign. Chad was at a loss for words. He was even quieter when a police officer pulled up two seconds later asking how we were doing. We gave him the sob story of just left Vegas and it's 2:00 in the morning. He left us alone and we were off again.  Not much else happened along the way; however there were a lot of great quotes. I will now list the top 10 quotes of the trip.  10. "I'll see your thousand and raise you your soul." - Chad  9. "He was down by the idiots and I was by the retards." - Clint  8. "If I'm sleepy, I'm not driving." - Chad  7. As we passed adobes Clint said, "You white people force us to live in those." I came back with, "Your people lived in those before we were here." "Yeah, but now you force us to live in them and sell fireworks and jewelry." - Clint  6. Clint asked, "Do you know how they told Kristyn Cade might have Down syndrome?" I responded with, "What'd they do, give her a book,  Down Syndrome and You ?"  5. "The Hoover Dam was built in 1846 by the Comanche Indians." - Chad  4. "I've got the best way to commit suicide. Fill your pockets with candy. Fill your shirt with candy. Fill your hat with candy. Then jump off a building so when you hit the ground it will look like a big pinata exploded. People will say, 'Someone committed suicide. Oh, a snickers.'" - Chad  3. 1:12 p.m. - "All black people steal. Either through affirmative action or just by bum rushing you and stealing your wallet." - Anonymous  1:14 p.m. - As a car with a confederate flag passes us on I-40, "Man, some people are ignorant." - Anonymous  2. "What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, unless you need a prescription to get rid of it." - Bart  And the winner of the funniest quote is...  1. "I may be the smallest guy at this table, but I will still kick your ass." - Me   This has been the summary of  Getting Kicked in the Junk by Vegas 2004 . I hope you enjoyed it and I will now return to my usual rants about ignorant people and our hopeless society.

      To keep these a bit shorter and not bore quite so many of you, I will stick to the basics of what happened on Saturday.  After waking up around 11:00, we decided to travel to the north end of the Strip.  This portion contains such greats like Treasure Island and The Mirage.  It is at The Mirage where we spent most of the day. Clint, Chad and Bart found a new game they think is glorious.  It's called Spanish 21.  I'm not quite sure how you lose money at this game.  It is an alternate version of blackjack.  However, this is where it gets crazy.  There are no tens in the deck (but face cards still count as ten) and if you don't like the looks of your double down odds, you can pull it back.  Clint fell in love with the game (until the second day he played it). James and I decided to try poker (the Mirage poker room is the center of the poker world according to the film  Rounders ).  We were put at the same table, right next to each other.  By the end of the first two hours, James had mucked a full house and I was on tilt.  James had 5's over J's and was called by a guy with the nut flush.  James didn't flip his hand over to show what he had.  He didn't realize he had the full house until I told him three hands later.  James now flips his cards every hand.  A tough lesson learned. I became angry at a hand where I was beat by three Q's and I had three J's.  Something you need to know about me is that I get very angry at bad beats and take it personally.  I went on tilt and couldn't shake it for the rest of the game.  I lost $100 at The Mirage. Luckily I had another poker tournament at Sam's Town that night.  Chad and I were the only two who played in it from our group.  The others went back to the hotel room and watched  The Girl Next Door .  The shameful twins and their mom were in the tournament again.  I was at the final table with two of them.  When I took one of them out, I leaned over to shake her hand and she would have none of it.  How rude is that.  She wouldn't even shake my hand. Chad did much better in the second tournament.  His goal was to make it through ten hands.  He finished 8th.  Good job Chad. I, however, did not do quite as well as the previous night.  I only finished 3rd and won $550.  I did prove all you need is a chip and a chair though.  I went all-in against a guy and lost.  It left we with $1,000 and the blinds were $1,000-2,000.  Unfortunately, I was also the small blind.  With six people in the game, I tripled up to $3,000, tripled up to $9,000 and then doubled up to $18,000.  I then worked my way to the chip leader, but a bad bet cost me a lot of chips.  I put $15,000 in the pot and put a guy all-in on a bluff.  If I had known that was all he had, I would have only bet about $5,000.  This cost me the chip lead and I then finished 3rd. Afterwards, Chad and I met up with the others at Bellagio and we had a good night wandering the town.  After a few hours, we went home and prepared for our last full day in Las Vegas.

      It had to happen some time. I wasn't going to be able to hold it in forever. George Lucas has finally pissed me off for the last time. Lucas has pushed me to the decision to e-mail Fox Home Theater and find out why we can't get a version of the  Star Wars  films that are exactly the same as when they came out in theaters in the 70s and 80s. Is it too much to ask for the original versions? I don't think so. Does George own the rights to the merchandising of his films? This is the only answer I can come up with. Why not release the originals? He could make even more money from all the geeks and movie idiots (like myself) on multiple purchases. What set this rant off was I heard some disparaging news from a frequently viewed website about the DVD trilogy of Episode IV-VI coming out on September 21. The following is an excerpt from the site:     But even more exciting (or depressing) information that came out of the convention were the copies of the Star Wars Trilogy DVD Collection (due September 21st, as if you weren't aware) that were making their way around the convention to those in the know, with connections, or sticky fingers. So for those fearing (or hoping) that Lucas would again make extensive changes to the classic first three movies in the saga, you will get your wish. Everything from less readily apparent changes - sound effects to the color of a lightsaber - to more substantive additions, including Ian McDiarmid (the evil Emperor) replacing Clive Revill in The Empire Strikes Back, to Anakin Hayden Christensen's face (badly) added to the body of Sebastian Shaw at the end of Return of the Jedi, or a chorus of cheering Gungians (or whatever those Jar Jar things are called) also tacked on to the finale of Jedi, will be found in the new DVDs. Sigh...but find out for yourself when the set reaches a galaxy near you this fall.     I just don't understand. Why is he ruining one of the greatest trilogies in celluloid history? He's already butchered the two newest films with such mistakes as Jar Jar Binks, Hayden Christensen and overuse of the green screen. Can this guy not go outside and scout a location? At least Peter Jackson used real fields of New Zealand in the  Lord of the Rings  films. A director should not be able to change his films permanently.  Once it has been shown on the big screen, there should always be an available copy of that particular version.  A director could change it for a special DVD release, but the original should also have its own disc.  Am I wrong to think this way? Mark August 5 as the day Matt Cook decided to say, "Damn the man."  I am going to take Lucas down and get what I want.  If Michael Moore can destroy a president, I can destroy a dork.  I don't care if he is Chairman of the Board of Lucasfilm Ltd., LucasArts Entertainment Company LLC, Lucas Digital Ltd. LLC., Lucas Licensing Ltd. and Lucas Learning Ltd.  He also owns Skywalker Ranch.  The guy is a flannel wearing, grey bearded loser who hasn't changed his look since 1975.  I will fight the system and win.  I'll call Johnny Cochran.  I'll call Erin Brockovich.  I'll call whoever can get the job done. I must stop the evil mongrel from destroying other great films like  Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade  and  Willow .  Please join me in the good fight against the dark side.
