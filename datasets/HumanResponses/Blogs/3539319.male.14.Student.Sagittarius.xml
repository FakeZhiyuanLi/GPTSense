Tehn they dropped me off at Aubry's house for the party. I forgot my bathing suit so i used josh's shorts lol. and it fit like a speedo. then we went back down in the basement and had a candy fight. we threw candy and shit at eachother for about a half hour. then we laid dwn until we had to go home. we walked all the way home with my guitar! and it was semi wet but nothing harmful. i got home and my cuzins were over so we watched the calgary game and played cardsand then thats it i went to sleep.

Damn you. Then went home and talked to Kristin. Then Me and Steve and some others went over Christina's and she had her friends over. We decided to squirt them with water guns..and Christina had white shorts on lol. Go figure. Then i almost broke my brothers neck my triping him and throwing him into the ground after he called my G/F and told her i was cheating on her. Which i have not and never will. But he deserved it. Then we shot some hockey balls around and i went in and went online like i always do. Well this was fun. Ill keep you posted. Later  Oh yea one more thing i forgot...Jon was a drama queen today. He thought josh liked chelsea and she liked him, and it didnt go over to well with jon. Jon got mad and were thinking they were gonna break up but no. jon realized he was a dumbass and came to the few senses he had. so yeah. What wonderful friends i have. lol Bye
