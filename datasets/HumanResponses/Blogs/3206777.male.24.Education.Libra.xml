      This may be esoteric or pointless but I got stuck in a trail of thought one night and ended up with an obvious but personally inspiring conclusion. This is long but writing it help settle a bit of silt in my mind. It is writing for me, not necessarily for anyone passing though. A new purpose for my swampy bogspot!  There is a line of thinking that says that there is such a thing as fate. That is, that there are quite strong elements of pre-determination in life, if not total pre-determination. For example, any decision you make is due to the experiences you have had and the circumstances beyond you. Are you not just doing what all the pre-conditions say you will do? You were always going to have the experiences you had because of the situations that preceded it. Even when you feel like you are making a random choice, the number might just be the number that your brain would choose if it had to. Last night, I did try to think of a random number and suddenly thought "132"... which after a moments thought realised was just a number that was raised earlier that night.   Why am I yapping on about this?   I just read in a book of apparent fiction:  "These people (Australian Aborigines) believe everything exists on this planet for a reason. Everything has a purpose. There are no freaks, misfits, or accidents. There are only misunderstandings and mysteries not yet revealed to mortal man."  I thought this was rather interesting and wanted to think about it but it was late and I was in need of sleep. When I tried to sleep, my mind returned to this discussion.   The section of the book contrasted with something James said to me in an e-mail:  "If everything is predetermined, then it gives me an empty feeling about life and existence.  How meaningful is anything you do, if you were predestined to do it anyway?"  Pre-determination hits upon all sorts of raw nerves. “Judge, I was always going to steal that car, circumstances meant that it was always ever going to be my only reasonable choice with respect to my state of mind, my past experiences, the air temperature and an a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil”  So, it damages faith in real freedom, meaning and other issues, as illuminated above, like justice.   The statement about aboriginal views of everything having a purpose and reason stirred me a little though. And is still stirring me a little. For me, I don't have a belief that everything has a purpose, in a fixed way i.e. this book was NOT always meant to be read by me personally, so that I will have a revelation that will lead me down the track to change the world. Sure, there was a purpose to the book, but it was not specific anyone except perhaps the author but not in a “fate” sense for me. It however can be used for “a” purpose. Recreation, enlightenment, paperweight etc. But “the” purpose is undefined.  “Everything happens for a reason.” This sentence could be taken in two ways. The aboriginal way is in the “fate” sense. This is to say, a meaning akin to “The Lord works in mysterious ways”, that all events are part of a master plan. There are some times when life does appear to be doing that. On my birthday 2002, I had a birthday party where I selected the girl to feed me my birthday cake out of a bag at random. There were the names of about 20 girls in that bag and I drew the name Xin, who was to become my girlfriend.  But then you could say that there could be an element of causation there. Did feeding me my birthday cake become a precondition for us becoming close? But soon as we suggest a master plan, there would be implication on something greater considering our getting together to be a “superior” outcome (Or else why?) Having no affiliation with a deistic religion, I can say that I can lay this argument to one side till I have one.  Everything has a reason. The less fate-based interpretation of this sentence is much easier on the brain. It is easy to see that any occurrence has a reason for happening because we already know what the occurrence is.   Everything has a reason. Any accident, intentional or does have a reason for occurring. When I crashed my car into the side of a Morris Minor, while attempting a U-turn on Khyber Pass, I was influenced by tiredness, distraction and the desire to take a suggestion of a friend to go back up the road the other way. The Morris Minor was logically there because the driver needed to go there, maybe circumstances. Two sets of circumstances added up to the collision of motor vehicles. It was no accident (in the sense of being something that shouldn't have happened), although quite unintentional. Accidents are often seen as aberrations. They do not seem to be if we have perfect knowledge.  So is this pre-determination? Was it always going to happen?  A few years ago I had the argument against fate as follows:   “The perspective of fate relies on a perspective that is all-knowing, and that is beyond time. You can only consider the future fixed if you have these two capacities. That is, to be a god. Only those who believe in God/ a god need to worry themselves about the implications of fate (I would suggest to Christian believers that the omniscience of God, if it is not just popular belief that he is, threatens the idea of salvation and damnation). The rest of us have no need to be concerned as it occupies a perspective that is impossible and irrelevant to our existence. Like worrying how we look to a fly. Our equal lack of knowledge is makes us equally ignorant of what all the implications of current actions are so fate is irrelevant to our human lives.”  That was a nice “fend-off” in my agnostic times. A lot of my arguments usually lead to the implication that I didn’t have to think about anything.  But as I said, something jumped into my mind. Our personal agency as one of my lecturers would name it. It is true that every event has reasons that led to it, although the mystery might be what the reasons are exactly. So all one can do is see how their own actions and processes lead to any particular action. We do actively participate in most of the things that affect us.  In the car crash, I know tiredness and distraction led to it. I can see exactly where I went wrong. But there were some things that I did that played an active role in causing it. My choices, attitudes and my subsequent actions, with the background of uncontrolled circumstances, led to the collision.   Between circumstances and fate, we should look at it from the perspective that we are active agents in fate. For any occurrence, we can see our responsibility for them, and if we consider the occurrence adversive, we can do something about it. To take ownership of all things that happen because of us.  It is quite an empowering conclusion, but obvious conclusion.  This loops into my existing values, of responsibility. And late at night where the relevance of any particular issue is hard to see, it was a nice revelation.  I also love the line: “There are no freaks, misfits, or accidents. There are only misunderstandings and mysteries not yet revealed to mortal man." That’s all. You can imagine that sleeping with that in mind, waiting idly to be forgotten is something of a sleep-inhibitor. Thanks for reading, if you are.  P.S. This almost item equals the word count in my recent essay which I struggled to write.

      I am a person who easily slips into comfortable routine.  But in that way, I also find joy when I find the switch that puts me into activity (different from the normal).  I wonder what would happen if I had always been switched on.

      I'm back only moments after my dream post to say:  I will be having Rooibus tea when I next go to the best tea cafe in Auckland. I have drunk it before, and unusually I also drank it in Singapore (served to me by a ethnically Chinese friend whom I had many interesting discussions). It is a South African tea with a 'different' taste. I didn't think of much of it when I first drank it but in Singapore it was a divine taste. Now, I hear it is apparently one of the healthiest teas around. I want to see what it tastes like loose leaf and of high quality.

      With my blog spot still in diapers, I suddenly find myself with ideas for posts seeping from my eyes and ears. Two nights ago, an idea or revelation kept me up. I wanted to write about it but found myself too tired. "Tomorrow!" And off to sleep I went. Yesterday came and while walking to pub quiz, I was again struck with a compelling daydream idea. "That would be a great post!", two to write about now. Regrettably time did not allow me to write either so I just scraped together notes on the Uni computers. Bussing to Xin's house, I suddenly remembered parts of my dreams. For now, that is what I will blog, "Fate" and "Leadership" will come later.  I dreamt last night about being in a boat. A shark, Jaws perhaps, burst headfirst from beneath the deck. The boat was damaged badly, some went into the water and pushed the boat, kicking in the water. There was no fear in that part of the dream. Later on, we got to an island, suddenly I found myself in a cave passage, and both the entrance and exit were guarded by snakes. I had no exit. I awoke.  I dream of vicious animals a lot. I can remember numerous dreams with sharks in them. Dream interpretation is not a hobby of mine. I just checked now, apparently sharks can mean "unpleasant emotions or difficult and painful materials coming up from the unconscious" or "dishonest friends" or "financial difficulties". None of those things seem a part of my life right now. Water is meant to indicate "subconsciousness". Maybe I should consider my own thought as to what "sharks" mean in my dreams. I am interested because I can't remember there being fear with such vicious animals in my dreams.

      My first post on BlogSpot.  Surrealism is an interesting concept.   Surrealism n. A 20th-century literary and artistic movement that attempts to express the workings of the subconscious and is characterized by fantastic imagery and incongruous juxtaposition of subject matter.   Here was my surrealistic day~  Life has no gravity, horizontal.. vertical.. horizontal... vertical. Day after day. Spinning through space time. Rotating.  So it was on this morning, my spine became perpendicular again (by most mathematical measures). The erection of my body from the depths of my sack of sheets was a laborious effort. Then it was down the chute. My head followed the same old watercourse, no control, none needed. I washed up at school. No splash. Just a stagger to my seat.  We learned of the blood and bones of language today. The dissecting of tongues and the discovery of the little bones in the ear sent some to bathroom in an awful hurry. Schwa. Schwa. We could see the sinews and tendons of the lecturer's words, not really listening to the meaning of his lesson.   He was just a pile of blood and bones anyway.   Higher I rose, climbing the walls. My company was stagnant, humming quitely. I talked endlessly.  He was filled with my silly ideas, taking note of my every point. A soulless friend. Higher again I rose. Till I came to a crossroads. A fairy danced up right next to me and took me by the hand. We talked of tales, till food came to our heads. Night came and I was whisked away by time.  I went down, and down, till there was only darkness, guided by a bright light. I went far away, and saw in the cosmos, a mad world had caught a small girl (5). Of milk, a man would drink yet still take. Of water, there seemed so much in a land so baked. Yet it was all the same. The curtain of night fell even further, and the girl was cloaked in the gloom. That was the last I saw of her.  Flying home in my seat. I could reflect on a day near complete. My body yearned for another turn, to meet with my mattrice in another horizontal slumber.

       Relfection after 5 days in my practicum:  It is Saturday morning and my feeling on Thursday afternoon has become reality, I have got a cold or flu. This week has been interesting but I really do need to think about the implications of my observations now and set a plan for the following week.  Observations:  # A week has gone by and I haven't much except thoughts to show for it. That means that I better get good mileage out of these thoughts for the time being, and planned to be more productive in the following weeks.  # Despite her experience and my limited experience, I think that my supervising teacher's teaching has a lot to be desired. Examples of poor classroom management abound. Two examples I will cite:   In order to do one-on-one maths and reading testing, she has repeatedly given the class loose instructions to play with some things while she works. Within 5 minutes naturally the class is doing all the things they shouldn't be doing. She yells at the top of her voice "HOW DARE YOU! MY HEART IS SORE!". In lectures, we learn that if you give poor instructions it is your mistake if the kids get diverted. I think this makes sense. Having useful activities available and prepared would be the best way to go. During planning for day of lessons, it is obvious that if you are doing 1-on-1 work then you need something to engage the other students. Getting them to play is not productive for them, and gets the kids all excited.  Another case during the one-on-one testing, was when she asked the child being tested "What number comes after 7?", quickly a student who "should" be playing with something else, comes running up and says "8!" before the child being tested can speak. Again, "HOW DARE YOU! GO AND SIT BY THE RUBBISH BIN!" So the child goes and sits by the rubbish bin and the teacher, who hasn't specified when the child will come back, forgets about him during the testing. After a while, I walked over to him and asked him whether he knew why he was being punished. He didn't. I explained it to him and asked him if he was ready to behave, to which he nodded his head. I let him join his classmates again. If someone doesn't know the reason for which they were being punished, it doesn't stand to reason that they will learn anything at all from it and will probably either resent the teacher or have a reduced self-image.  # Being that I am not impressed with the habits that have been drilled into them, I do have to bear in mind that I will need to be doing some assessments with them. So, I need to have a sense of control, otherwise when I am observed by people at the University it will not be a pretty demonstration. I read a book to them "The Story of the Gingerbread Man" but at the same time experimented with a few instructional techniques and I have some reason to think in that small, low-risk environment, I held the classes attention and controlled the less controllable students. But that is only a start, and I will need to build up for more challenging instructional tasks.  # Compared to the last school that I went to for practicum, this school has put little thought into how they will accommodate student learners. At the last school, students teachers had a guided tour by the school, a powhiri welcome and a proactive mentor who arranged times to meet with us (a requirement for which they get paid for by the University). The mentor at Avondale didn't seem to know that he had to meet with me, even though presumeably he gets paid to do so. And when we did set a time, Friday afternoon, he found that he was busy with the staff socialising event and cancelled it.  # The talented students are really talented. The behind students are very behind. We have several ESOL children, one from Russia also has some developmental problems. I had to find out the other ESOL students by observation. Two of the young polynesians were recent immigrants. It challenges a preconception of mine that Polynesians at the school would all be born here and hence have good English.  # I am not sure how well I will be by Monday, and I may have a sicky that day just so I have recovered sufficiently.  That's all for now. There are a few other thoughts that lie beneath the surface of my memory, so maybe I will append this later.

       Malcolm in the Middle  has been a favourite programme of mine for a few years. I once thought it was some stupid series copycat series, when I first heard of it and could never be bothered watching it. But one of my language students told me about how funny it was in one class, which eventually lead me to try watching it. I've been hooked since. It is a superior version of Wonder Years. Far more creative, diverse in direction techniques, yet centred enough to be endearing.  One of the hidden themes, I would say, is almost a Yin-Yang kind of reality, where under normal peaceful external conditions the family is chaotic, but when they resolve their issues, the world becomes chaotic. In the episode I just saw, the family came home early from their fifth regularly timed vacation to find the whole neighbour was holding the fifth annual Neighbourhood fair. It turns out everyone else covertly planned it at this time to exclude the most disliked family in the neighbourhood.   The parents didn't mind this, "Hey, there is always someone that everyone hates. If it wasn't us, it would be some minority group! Don't be so worried about what other people think, you're born, they hate you, you get worried about it, you die. Why do that?" "Mum, is this meant to make me feel happy?" "Why does everything need to make you happy?"  They took part in the fair with gusto, and suddenly all their neighbours found they weren't all that bad... but on finding out that their previous united object of hate was no longer realistic, a chain reaction of disagreements and accusations erupted amongst everyone else dividing them and causing everyone to leave the fair in mutual acrimony immediately (the fair was desolate in moments). It was only the neighbourbood's disliking of them that made them so united. And then the family could do what they want.  "I'm gonna put dogs on the ferris wheel!"  Gotta love it... Funnier than Simpsons (which is kinda dragging) and Whose Line is it? (which seems rather repetitive with the current host and not rotating guests). Scrubs is OK for light crazy humour too.

       Day Three review of my practicum:   On Monday afternoon, I felt energetic after my first day. I thought that was odd as I usually find myself drained upon leaving a teaching setting. Tuesday afternoon, 3:05pm and I felt as flat as the proverbial pancake. I had taken two guided reading groups, and saw my maths lesson turn the usually raucous class into a tremendously raucous class. I did try to maintain order, and I believe some learning was done, but once I had done all that I could, I quickly gave the reins back to the reliever teacher.  Wednesday, I had a more effective reliever teacher who was quite keen for me to learn from how she did things, and she was quite a proficient teacher in my estimation. I did more guided reading but otherwise just interacted with the kids. I felt less run down than Tuesday. Needless to say, I have been hitting the chocolate again to get me through.  Tomorrow, the regular teacher should be back. Hopefully I get to see her current methods of giving directions and getting attention and order. That is one thing that gives me some explanation for a lack of classroom control. Teachers must install some cues to get the classes attention or to bring them to the mat etc. In the schools I attended, the clapping "tah, tah, tah-teh-tah" was a signal for you to drop everything you are doing, copy the clap and then pay attention to the teacher. But each teacher has their own way. The Tuesday reliever did that ever-so-familiar clap yet the students didn't stop at all. They must have thought she was amusing herself. Once I get a hold of her cues, then I will have the commands to orchestrate the lessons I need to do for my assessments and then some.  This school doesn't have the spirit of my last practicum school, or a feeling of professionalism that I like. My last school felt so on to it yet collegial. Avondale however, is just a friendly staff, that is all you can say. There are advantages to it, in my last practicum school, it was hard to really mix with the people, they had their cliques but were experienced and could discuss issues with you. At Avondale, I don't feel left out, I can just start talking to someone about anything.   But their professionalism seems lacking, exemplified by my current supervising teacher (a huge contrast to my last supervising teacher). This supervising teacher, although sick, should have had at least prepared something. Instead we have muddled through two days of essential education for students at an important stage of their learning. That kind of neglect is abhorrant to me. I remember when I was sick at my language school, I still faxed in lesson plans and objectives, directions and all that I could to not leave the reliever in the lurch. In retrospect, that might be because I am possessive of my class, and desire control, and would hardly ever want some person to wander in and subvert my intended lessons.  In some ways, this leads me to thoughts of culture and values in schools, which is an awfully convenient pivot considering a presentation I will be doing soon for AIESEC.  So 3/24th of the way through my practicum, I march on.

      It has been a while since I last posted, with good reason too, I have been preoccupied with every sort of thing. I am rather preoccupied now too but rather centred on one-thing for now, which is rather pleasant.  I have been placed for my practicum at Avondale Primary School, a year one class. The teacher who is supervising me fell sick with the flu but dragged herself to work so not to leave her student (me) welcomeless. She gave up the fight and went home at midday but in tha time I was there, I could already see that she wasn't the best teacher to learn from. But her absence tomorrow will herald the beginning of my attempt to practice as much teaching as I can. I am in the zone.  I have had my first taste of teaching year one (those turning 6 in this calendar year), which was intriguing. They are undoubtedly adorable but missing some rather basic conceptions. They struggle to write numbers (3's backwards). They cannot guess words. Some don't seem to know their alphabet at all (the one's that don't just guess,  . One of the most fluent orally has little number or letter knowledge (he burst into life telling the whole class about what happens when a woman gives birth, rather vivid!). I also saw some of the potential trouble students did have a thirst to learn.  There is also one Ethiopian boy whose reading ability (and apparently his maths ability) are extraordinary, he read a reasonably advanced book for that age group and read it cover to cover aloud with very little prompting.  So anyway, with my supervising teacher ill, and a reliever who is fine with me taking control of some aspects, I have put a fair bit of effort in tonight so I have preparation to be experimenting tomorrow.   Maybe I am in a honeymoon period... Anyway, I will update with how my efforts go.

       It is cool to Koorero   Teenaa koutou katoa.  Ko Daniel ahau. Ko Ngati Pakeeha te iwi. Rua tekau maa whaa taku tau. Ko Susan raaua ko Warren aku maatua. Ko Brenda raaua ko Joanna aku tuaahine.    Noo reira, teenaa koutou, teenaa koutou, teenaa koutou katoa.  I am learning te reo Maaori, so I thought I had better see how much I can remember and actually produce a few sentences, the above being a self-introduction. I made a discovery that was obvious to many people. That is, I have access to the newly started Maaori channel. I had thought I needed a SKY aerial. So, on the advice of a classmate, I watched Koorero Mai, a programme designed to teach te reo Maaori. Boy, did it go fast! I think I learned a lot, and also got some listening practice as well as added to my stock of words.

      I want to change the world. I do. I want to be a lot active in the way I live out my life so I crystalised my current mental state as the following...    Books and changing oneself or the world   (this might be a little messy - I may have suffered a paradigm shift between the beginning and end of writing)   I have probably read more recently than any other time in the last 5 years. That being said, I have often had a rather negative view of books (for various reasons).   Right now, I just have negative thoughts about books that try to change your life or change the world. Books could outline how to do something, but in the end I think that it usually just results in a lot of head-nodding and no action. Reading is usually too passive for me. I think that knowledge comes from books, but wisdom (I think there is a distinction) comes from learning as you act in every action of your life (this has become a tenet of my recent life).   It is fine to read "Dance like no-one is watching" but to do this is actually a process that is done in action and developed, not just read and done. To dance like no-one is watching, you would need to address your self-confidence, your self-image, your self-consciousness, your dancing self-efficacy (a term from a social cognitive theory, meaning confidence in a particular skill, "Can I pull it off?" feeling), and find the real purpose for why you dance (perhaps one of the most important). These are not resolved by reading. By actively widening each of these aspects in every action you do is what is most important. Only then can you "Dance like no-one is watching".  There are many self-help/new-age save the world books out there. Some have a vital heart but malformed limbs. The intention is there but they do nothing, change nothing. I am starting to have the perhaps not completely unfounded opinion that self-help books are literary drugs, making those who read feel good. Chicken Soup for the Soul is typical. Empty platitudes that inspire good feelings.   Probably my perception of all art affects my view of books and writing. I see the process as more beneficial to the writer than the reader. I love writing, and sometimes entertain ideas of publishing, but it would probably be more as a personal attempt to develop my ideas. So reading someone else's enlightenment should be secondary to breaking down your barriers to greater wisdom.  There have been some books in history that have changed the world. Right now I can only think of one person who by writing a book changed anything (for good or bad):   Karl Marx's "Das Kapital". His ideas changed the world (better or worse). But in his life he was an activist too and he did have a good advocate in Engels. He was attempting some sort of leadership too. Hitler wrote a book too "Mein Kampf", but he backed that with very firm leadership (probably the greatest mover in his success). Most strong leaders don't necessarily leave books. I think most religions were only sustained by the actions of their figureheads and not the actual texts themselves.  A Chinese philosopher, Zhuang-zi, wrote a story to say how reading other people's thoughts might not get the "real message".  (http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/chuangtz.html) Translated by Patricia Ebrey: ------------- Duke Huan was reading a book in the hall. Wheelwright Pian, who had been chiseling a wheel in the courtyard below, set down his tools and climbed the stairs to ask Duke Huan, "may I ask what words are in the book Your Grace is reading?"  "The words of sages." the Duke responded. "Are these sages alive?" "They are already dead."  "That means you are reading the dregs of long gone men, doesn't it?"  Duke Huan said "How does a wheelwright get to have opinions on the books I read? If you can explain yourself I'll let it pass otherwise, it's death!"   Wheelwright Pian said ''In my case I see things in terms of my own work. When I chisel at a wheel, if I go slow the chisel slides and does not stay put; if I hurry, it jams and doesn't move properly. When it is neither too slow nor too fast I can feel it in my hand and respond to it from my heart. My mouth cannot describe it in words but there is something there 1 cannot teach it to my son and my son cannot learn it from me So I have gone on for seventy years, growing old chiseling wheels The men of old died in possession of what could not transmit. So it follows that what you are reading is their dregs." ------------  I agree with this. Except a writer whom you have no contact with is as good as dead. Guidance from someone is essential. Zhuang-zi is dead so I guess these are the dregs of dead men. Zhuang-zi didn't write it, his followers did.  To make people move, you don't need a book passively giving them the ideas.   So if books don't change the world, what does the world need? You need a person to lead.  So if books don't change people, what do people need? You need a person to guide and aid reflection.  These of course are more difficult but rather more profound for me.  Leadership is a way to change the world. History proves it. Napoleon and Gandhi didn't write books. The former just needed to be in power and that seemed to make armies strong. The latter was too busy doing things like fasting and leading. I have been inspired by recent observations and an event (NZWA) for what I personally think leadership requires but that is another message. That still needs a bit more time for me to ruminate on the verbal cellulose in the paddocks of my brain.  Mentorship seems logical for a person to develop. It seems that in the rather individualistic society in which I live that deaing with our personal life planning our by ourselves to be foolish. Planning could always benefit from a different perspective. Would your physical training do better with a personal trainer / running buddy or by your own solitary efforts? Are you more likely to adhere to your plan and goals if you have had a witness who will remind you of those promises, or those made to yourself? It seems obvious. Why am I only discovering this now...?  Wouldn't the real benefit of a book come from reflection with someone, some planning and goal setting based on your conclusions? If you did read "Dance like no-one was watching" and were inspired and thought that that was what you wanted to do, wouldn't it be better to think about it concretely and objectively?  The concept of being interactive with a book's text is mindblowing. Maybe the problem lies in my own mind that takes reading books was the purpose in itself.  Writing also suffers in that it is distant from those you are trying to move. Compare an e-mail, to a letter, a letter to a person encounter. What would move you heart, mind and body to act in a new way that someone advocated, would save the world? E-mail has words but sometimes seems to lack soul. Letters have soul but sometimes lack the face. In AIESEC, we were often told that when cold-calling we should not discuss things on the phone or elaborate too much. If we give them information on the phone, they could easily just say no and hang up. If there is a meeting, then it is harder to hang-up, and also you have a bond created in meeting the person.  To have a leader is to have someone with the message burst from their every word and action. You can see their vitality and passion and it brought people along. See old clips of Hitler, Martin Luther King Jr. and Churchill. Their demonstration and words changed history and changed people. Come to think of it, have all the compelling, strong orators gone, never to be seen again?  If a person has written a book that inspired you, and they are not leading a movement to actively go out and change anything, nothing may happen of it.   So, I think I need to re-evaluate my mode of constructing the process that define the course of my life and actions. I will do that this week.  Okay, that's all. Anyone who wants to offer any thoughts of what I am trying to express, tell me and we can have tea (on me). Later.

      Playing chess at a reasonable level has many facets that non-players might struggle to undestand (like any skill perhaps).   Before you get to that level, there are the fundamentals, which themselves are quite difficult; knowing the pieces and their moves and value, having awareness of the whole board so that if one of your pieces can be taken, you prevent it. Later more complicated "future" awareness develops so that tactical tricks can be avoided. After this, most players have a little plateau because you have the tools to play but how do you go about getting that end result: checkmate. Perhaps a few basic attacks were learnt in developing the basic skills but mostly these are futile against players who are beyond the basics.  So then, ideas of strategy come into it, how to start the game (opening, a chess players' serve) , techniques nearer the end of the game when pieces are few (endgame) are slowly absorbed so that the game starts to have structure and almost a sense of predictability.  Most of the above is knowledge-based. Then comes where the brain-power is really required. Calculation into the future is a skill that takes a long time to master. You need to organise your thoughts into a logical order, then use your imagination to move the pieces on the board  in your head .   Watching a good chess could be more engaging than looking at art (Xin will argue of course). Art tends to have one surface to admire and maybe some context or meaning embedded there. Just like a classical music symphony, there are themes on the surface and maybe a setting or feeling that it wishes to invoke. Chess, however, has invisible symphonies, and implicit ideas in every frame. Every move the chess player makes is just one of the many choices that were analysed, with multiple responses and possible counter-responses and so on and so forth. Each position has so many potentialities, only one of which is lived out, but all of the arrays of variations and possible lines contain drama, complexity, unbridled aggression and staunch, creative resolute defence.  When I was at the peak of my chess interest, I could stare at a position for days and find new ideas and complicated lines. I have done that again recently too. One such position I found so many interesting aspects that I was compelled to write them all down (in chess notation). I still missed the best line! (which was pointed out by my friend Paul). Again recently I have been playing another chess friend Aaron. One game, although a little dry at first livened up into a double-edged struggle, with the advantage see-sawing between white and black. The end position could have been forefully drawn by either white or black (boths sides could "perpetual check" or check the other king for enternity which is decided as a draw) but also both of us had a chance to win or lose. I didn't like my chances so sacrificed a rook to force the perpetual check.  Despite it being error-ridden (he should have won and perhaps so should have I), it was a delightful game with a lot of hidden variations.  That is the joy of chess.

      Ever since my return from Malaysia, I have only once had a decent night sleep (the first night back's record-breaking 10 hour sleep). Most of this sleep-deprivation hasn't been forced on me (except for one night's essay-writing). Today, I bought the Listener because of an article about sleep-deprivation and this has motivated me to shift my sleep-time closer to the 11pm mark. This means a cut-down on chess-related procrastination, maybe frequency on blogspot and more early afternoon essay writing.  In passing, I might buy the listener more often. It seems to be my kind of magazine. It has good topics and doesn't have dumbed down language. It also seems to have a more level-headed perspective (I dislike Time magazine for what felt like tabloid-journalism on it).  Anyway, with less than 50 minutes before bedtime (and I am quite tired), Oyasumi~

      Two themes have collided in my brain today.  I returned from Malaysia just a few weeks ago. One of the observations I made while there is how little involved the Malay population (indigenous people to Malaysia) and the immigrant Chinese and Indian population (their ancestors mostly immigrated there many hundred years ago) are. I stayed with mostly Chinese company and I noticed a slight prejudice against Malays in terms of their culture, intelligence and other aspects. This being said, the Malays are in power and noticing the disparity in quality of life, academic achievement and wealth, the Malaysian government has positive discrimination in favour of themselves. This is an interesting contrast to New Zealand, which also has some policies that favour the Maori, but whose government is mostly controlled by the "immigrants". I might do some research on the extent to this positive discrimination in Malaysia just for comparison sake.  Anyway, the one aspect I am focussing on is intelligence. We just had two lectures on Gifted Children and discussed intelligence and now we are talking about behavioural problems and then Maori academic achievement. A Malaysian Chinese girl in my class commented that Malays' intelligence is lower for genetic reasons, and that it was observable that Maoris also had dark skinned and were in a similar situation. I mentioned to her, that in NZ most people would consider this racist. I didn't think it being genetic was the case, or at least didn't think that it could be proven.  Instinctively, most liberal minded people in the western world freeze up at the implication that intelligence or achievement is decided by genetic factors. Of course, it is conceivable that it is this way. This mixes with the fate issue and self-determination issue of course. ("If your achievement doesn't come from your genes, where does it come from? If it comes from your environment, then you are just fortunate that external factors beyond you have made you be successful and intelligent etc.") But let's not get sidetracked.  I mentioned to her about the situation with the Maori people, that with their lower achievement and discipline problems (in comparison to other ethnic groups), it could be said by some that they "had lower intelligence". But this could be due to the effects of colonisation, being subjected to a few cycles of poverty, and a foreign education system that they had to adapt. It is hard to put a reason to the phenomenon.  However, Malays (in English that does have a horrible homophonic ring) did not suffer as much the brunt of colonial life like the Maori did. They would have experienced the same oppression from the Dutch and British that the Indians (often taken from their homeland as slaves) and the Chinese (who were used as manual workers) yet still they are quite behind their ethnically different compatriots.  The only thing I could really think for this is that there are cultural differences in terms of their attitude to education (which could be said for Maori too). Chinese have long put emphasis on education and I think Indians do too (although I am not as familiar with them as I am Chinese people). It is easy to consider that some cultures are more inclined toward education and working in professions. Some cultures could be more hardworking too (although the corollary of saying this is that perhaps some cultures are lazy, which is something I find hard to say). But then, soon as I emerge at this end of the discussion I thought that that assertion ("of other cultures being more education-minded or industrious") could be viewed as "racist" too.  I am a liberal-apologist at the best and worst of times. This is another issue that I think will crystalise better in my mind when I have more exposure to the lives of Maori and Pacific Islanders and maybe Malays too. It is too easy to think for a long time without actually having direct experience.  Passing view: What do you call an Indian living in the US? (you can answer that). Also, we saw a dated tape on aquatic education (swimming) where one game was "Cowboys and Indians". Our teacher-teacher commented that you have to call this something else now, of course.

      Another dream with menacing animals. There were huge, friendly, spindly spiders (though not as big as the Lord of the Ring spider, was Sheila its name?) and also a menacing lion. The lion offed a rather stupid lamb or goat that surrendered so meekly (to the slaughter!) which gave me and some other person a chance to run for it, behind a hedge. Not sure if we fooled the lion or not.

      A few months ago, GeoCities decided to dismantle my 5-year-old website. I hadn't been using it much or altered more than a few dozen words on it in the last few years so maybe I was asking for it. When friends who visit my site noticed and told me, and I found it was not a technical problem, I wasn't that sad. There were some things that were certainly gone forever but it wasn't a big loss to me personally. Now, I am starting a new ambitious project, a more complicated labyrinth of ideas.  Just last night, my girlfriend Xin told me she had saved some philosophy pages from my old website (back then when she was obviously "checking me out", she had even hacked into my directory and found files I didn't even have presented on my website, that were not complete) and she sent them to me today.  It is curious to look through because I had forgotten the things that I have written but suddenly think: "I agree with this guy a lot!"  Anyway, here is an excerpt of a story I started writing in 2000. I had written all my ideas in stories then. It is a discussion between an enthusiastic Christian (Devon) and an agnostic guy who masquerades as a homeless person (Davisun):  Devon enthusiasm picked up suddenly with a conception of a new idea, "OK well let me ask you another question then. You admit that you are, in terms of reality, a blindman. Why would you seek to tell people anything about the world. Like the phrase goes, it would be like the blind leading the blind. Why convince people of their blindness or maybe, to put it another way, pull them into a strange sort of voluntary mypoia?"  "Tis' true that I would probably admit that I am blind, and cannot necessary acknowledge much to be true. So what is there for one to do? Well I chose to philosophically sit down and not bother to think about the hard stuff unless the whim should come to mind. Running around willynilly, however, trying to get to a place that one has heard about, but has to charge into the darkness, following a scent, denying one's blindness, now what is that? They might step on a few people, trip over and hurt themselves, knock other people off their respective blind rushes to really GET THERE. Or maybe they don't, they might walk around in confidence. I dunno that is other people. I am thinking, why not sit, maybe flag a few people down to sit by the road side. Being low to the ground so there is no fear of falling. Being still and calm, so no risk of bumping into things. Do you not think that you are also blind to some degree?"  Devon turned his eyes toward the group that sat across the park from him to ponder for a moment. "Yes, I would say that I am. Which is why I would say we need guidance. I would regard the Bible as a map to find the only thing that can lead me, namely God and Jesus. I guess I should add the manditory joke saying, 'And then I saw the light'."  "But can you also say that despite the guidance you have fallen down or stood on people?"  "Of course, to be human is to err. We all will sin in our lives at some stage. Even if you metaphorically say that you are sitting down I don't see how you can claim to avoid such either though.", Devon questioned.  "If you think of it from my point of view, I don't need to. Give me an example of how I could fall? Give me an example of how I could stand on someone?"  "For you to fall... To fail in your studies."  "How is that to fall?"  "How is it not to fall, why is it that you study?"  "Because I enjoy to learn. Regardless of failing, I still learn. How is that any more a failure than not being able to eat all of what is on your plate. There is no requirement to it.. unless you consider what someone has chosen as a standard to be taken as your goal. As it is, because I enjoy to learn it is no problem to pass exams. I like to learn things not for the exams too. If I didn't it do well that would be just the same as my tennis game or my squash game. I love to run around whacking the ball although I might never beat my friends who in turn might not be the greatest players themselves. What is there to compare? There is nothing to fall from."   Just an excerpt. I liked it anyway.

      Another lateral rant. Indirectly linked to my idea of responsibility.  The following is something I noticed yesterday in class. We were learning about the legal implications of teaching. Things that seemed small but specific, some seemingly odd but with a potential reason. Anyway, here are three of the legal implications that we were told. Which do you think received the most surprise/annoyance by student teachers?  (a)  Being told we couldn't write student's full names on their art work (b)  Being told we couldn't show let any other student know the results of other students, or putting stars on the wall to show achievement of some. (c)  Being told we're not allowed to show videos in class or video more than 3% or 3 pages of a book. (d)  Being told, if we wanted to keep anyone in after 3pm we needed to give parents 1-2 days notice.  Chosen yet?   Well, even though all of the above seem to be rather odd, it was (c) that caused the most murmur and discussion. I don't know what made people particularly annoyed in particular but this is one rule that I am in favour of, or at least believed it was an obvious rule.  Even though we have all been raised in a capitalist society, I don't think people really understand the implications of being in it. People produce things for us to buy because of a desire to make money. The society as a whole will produce most of the multifarious things we want and need because they want to earn money. Movies, videos and books are all produced (and priced) with consideration for how many will be sold and how much profit will be produced.  The outrage of not being able to use videos seems to be the same desire that makes people buy illegally copied music, internet distributed music and CDs. People see this as a right, and actual prices are a "rip-off". The way companies fund the wonderful people who create music, write books and make movies is by selling it and licensing it out.   Maybe somewhere there lies a "honesty quotient" for a market. That is a number that reflects the degree of honest purchases and the the leakage through illegal actions and selling. The leakage quotient would be used in pricing legal copies. The ironic nature of the system is that the "rip-off" price is high because of the illegal leakage of profit that would otherwise go to the creators of the goods. People who take illegal copies are harming those that don't.  In the end it is more or less a "prisoner's dillema". If everyone bought and acted legally, prices would be lower. If some people cheat, the legal price needs to be higher harming those who are honest. If everyone cheated, then there would be a collapse and there would be no goods for anyone to use as the creator would not be making a profit.  Maybe we have an implicit understanding in society that there are understanding, obedient, moral people in society who will always buy legally so that means that we can allow illegal copies or illegal use of rented goods. That since there is someone who is doing the buying, then it is OK to buy illegal copies. Not many people would know any friends or acquaintances who have been fined hugely or put in prison for buying an illegal movie. The consequences as fierce as they might be, are not "real" in anyone's eyes.  Back to showing videos in school, movie companies specifically license out videos for personal use and outline the places that such can be shown. All of these things are built into the price structure of videos, books and DVDs. Even in our particular context, we are receiving money for educating and we are exploiting the creative works of someone else to do it without recompensating them. When we copy books for whatever reason, we are using what   The next time you complain about the cost of textbooks, software, music, maybe think about this. It is only your own personal interface with your values that you can come to the conclusion of whether you will or won't buy or not buy. I know I have bought and was thinking of buying things that were not legal copies (NZ$3 on a Coldplay album, $5 on a DVD) on my last overseas trip to Malaysia.   But I am not at all surprised by legal implications and I will have to do more thinking to see how this will change my actions in the future.

       Three   Sick with a cold again. Twice in a month. Thrice in three months. And three  months since I had a blood test which indicated a lowering in the number of  one kind of white blood cells (neutrophil)...  I am due for another blood test but I can't help but wonder whether that my  recent run of illness is a good predictor of my result in that blood test. I  might be off to the haemotologist, and earning a puncture in a  marrow-bearing bone. This is what would have last time if the doctor I saw  didn't mention that the decrease could have been explained by the cyclical  nature of the body.  Anyway, tomorrow the test shall be. And in three days, a result should come.

       Unadulterated   When do you start to feel like an adult? What does it mean to be an adult? Do you actually know? Or is it just something you realise? Or are we always the same inside, the same as the child that skinned its knee on concrete at primary school all those years ago?  I don't know. I don't feel like an adult at times, especially when I am in a new context. And when I become more familiar to a context, everyone else just seems like a "non-adult" like me. A knowledgeable experienced child. But not as dynamic as a child.  This is more apparent to me being around children. Although I can patently see that they are cognitively very different to present-day me, I still feel the same as them at times.

       Two steps forward, One step back   Oh, the vicissitudes of personal progress. Oh, how I remember consoling ESOL students with the nature of learning. I use to draw it on the whiteboard, graphically, the curve of ability over time, going rocketing up and then plateauing, maybe even inexplicably receding a little, before climbing once more to all new heights.  Students didn't get much relief from their frustrations of course. I think they recognised it as my scientific, complicatedly logical ploy to make them feel better when they failed to reach their own expectations.  Well, the tables have for have a year been turning and turning as I have become teacher and student, learning as I taught and teaching as I learnt. And with time, my frustration has grown. Today was when this was clearest to myself. I made several breakthroughs but at the same time tripped on unexpected hurdles, which have worn me thin.   With now just three days left in my practicum and almost all of my required teaching done, hitting hurdles is mentally taxing not because they are hurdles but because my brain recognises that the necessity to act is no longer there, and to do something requires a bigger push. But today, on several occasions, I reverted back to the most elementary, thoughtless kind of classroom management. And I was too tired to really care.  I could skeptically look at the graph, hoping to see it as a fallacy, in order to sustain my disappointment. But I know it is right, and that is my respite.  I DID make some breakthroughs. Three days to go, I could make this into something that I can really build in on my next placement. I can say that, but will I do it...

       Mental Stamina   I have survived the first three, rather busy, days of this week without much tiredness at all. Today, I took so many different roles in the class because of several incidental occurrences. I think I was in charge for 80% of the day. And still I feel fine...  Touch wood.  Two more days to go in this week, shouldn't count 'em chickens to early, no?

      5:00pm Oh, dear. . . . . . . . .  Mentions of teaching stamina seem so distant in the past. I am feeling flat as cat, stuck to a railway track. At about 12pm, my will crumbled and I was left just lurching around the classroom clueless. Fortunately, I wasn't alone and the class was not chaotic. After the lunch break I did a lesson which idea-wise was superb. The management-side of things was slightly lacking in forethought but another good class. Exhausting though. Most of my tiredness came from the late night that formulated that and other classes, so what goes around comes around.  The reliever had his last day today, back with my original supervising teacher from tomorrow. The reliever seems indefatigable. He controls the class, writes down copious notes for me and does so at a higher speed than most others. After class yesterday I commented that he should have a good rest now that the class is over. But no, he was off to tutor two Korean girls English for another 2 hours.  That is the sort of endurance I would love to have.   Now, I need to balance some time to recuperate, with some time to plan and some time to not do anything but go straight to bed.

      My current reliever is a great teacher, despite the fact that he has broken the law, asked me to break common teaching practice, and touches children in ways that would not be approved by lecturers at Auckland Uni (not "BAD" touching).  To say why he is great, he has not growled at anyone, he has contained the class, the class listen to him and enjoy him as a teacher (it makes me look bad, but it is great to watch, a child said to me yesterday "We want Mr Newman to read us a book". Sigh).   He is much better than my supervising teacher at giving feedback. He gave me copious observations about my teaching, all written up and explained after the lesson In two weeks, my supervising teacher only gave it to me once. Although both of their notes are similiarly coated in niceties not to hurt my confidence (I have to try hard to translate what I need to do!).  But this teacher tickles the children under their chins, which is technically not proper, he went through a boy's bag, which is a legal no-no, and he asked me to remain and teach a boy one on one in the class, which is a position that is not permitted.   Today had its share of highs and lows. One of my lessons was so difficult. Another went better beyond my wildest expectations! I returned energy sapped. Then the power went out, and I spent 2 hours without the necessities like hot tea. And then when I decided to take a nap, the power came on.  Now, after desperately thinking up more material for tomorrow, I neeeeed sleep. Oh dear. Night.

      Another important consideration for teaching is that of mental stamina. I think we all know that when you have a double lecture, or even a whole lecture straight, you can become pretty jaded.  Well, mental stamina is something that can be built up. Young children have next to no mental stamina and expecting them to sit attentively for more than 10-15 minutes is ridiculuous.  Now I know some of my lesson plans are ridiculuous.   Another reliever in today. My supervising teacher is going to be away for 3 days at a tangi (funeral). Soon, I will have seen more reliever lessons than her lessons. Typically she has set nothing much up. Fortunately we had a discussion about what things I can do this week on Friday last week. So I am set and planned.  Making lessons sometimes takes inspiration. It took me so long to think of anything decent for The Three Little Pigs. When I did think of a good order, then things ploughed through to a whole plan for the week. But it is not a brilliant idea, just a normal idea that you would expect. This sort of planning shouldn't be rocket science so hopefully in the future when I have a bit more experience I can produce a set of lessons (a unit), quickly without agonising over it. I had lesson one, and it went mostly according to plan. I am happy.  Talking of mental stamina, teaching stamina is another thing. After my first two weeks being exhausting, the comparatively intensive day today has not dented my energy levels much. Then again it is only the first day of the school week. I might be a mess by Friday 3pm.  Time to get my Wednesday together so I can enjoy a night out at the pub quiz.

       Trouble?   I think the class which I am doing my practicum has been described recently as "off the wall", many of the members responsible for what one teacher described as "the two worst duties in my life" (duty being when a teacher walks around children playing during morning tea and lunch breaks). Today, the reason was five of the boys in my class being involved in an all tit-for-tat punching war (out of the six involved).   Earlier in the morning, one of the "trouble" kids was particularly agitating but when told off, he started to cry. This my supervising teacher noticed as unusual for him, and asked him what really was up with him. After much persistence she found that his mother had hit him in the head that morning.   There seems to have been an escalation of these sorts of disruption since I arrived (although I can't see how I have had anything to do with it). These are only 5 year olds. Born in 1998. And the teacher, I don't see as having many productive techniques to restore order. But is it possible to do so anyway? Some of it seems so affected by external factors.  How do you regain control? Or don't you, just doing the best you can under the circumstances.  Next week, I do take a more administrative role over the class, and will be formally required to do some lessons. I will be thinking about this hard.  This two quotes, passed onto us by our lecturer John Hope, give me courage:  "The Myth of the Good Teacher" "This is the teacher who doesn't have behaviour problems, who is always in control, who never calls anyone for help. "The myth is nonsense. No teacher, no matter how skilled he is or how much experience she has, is capable of working successfully with each and every student without support. This myth is especially damaging today because of the increase in the students whose behaviour is so disruptive that a teacher must have help from the principal, the parent(s), and if possible, a counsellor, in order to deal effectively with unacceptable behaviour." Canter 1992  In other words, I really should let these current experiences pour some cold water on my idealistic expectations for myself. I will be hit with the worst case of disappointment if I let my expecations define an impossible goal. Plan for the best, prepare for the worst. And this one:  "The Frightening Conclusion" "I have come to a frightening conclusion. I am the decisive element in the classroom. It is my personal approach that creates the climate. It is my daily mood that makes the weather. As as teacher I possess trememdous power to make a child's life miserable or joyous. I can be a tool of torture or an instrument of inspiration. I can humiliate or humour, hurt or heal. In all situations, it is my response that decides whether a crisis will be escalated or de-escalated, a child humanised or de-humanised" Ginott 1972  A balance to the previous quote, because we must always remember we are the strongest agent in the classroom. We define so many of the factors. To always point to external factors (mums hitting children etc.) is to look for scapegoats and evade your own place of responsibility.  Anyway, to bed I go, to save my energy for the last day of the week.

      I had a sicky on Monday due to sickness, but soldiered through a busy Tuesday. More about that later.   While killing time prior to the pub quiz, I went to Borders where I found an interesting set of philosophical books. One of them, "Life, Sex and Ideas" by A. C. Grayling, had the following quote, explaining why people think mores of previous times were morally superior to today (and the hysteria in relation to new moral dilemmas):  "But a more important reason is that moral panics occur because the increased availability of information about what happens in society is not matched by a public capacity to reflect upon and make sense of it."  I think this is so pertinent. Things like the attempted change on laws regarding legal consensual sex caused an uproar here. Maybe this is why.  The author goes onto say, for whatever advances we have made in media technology, it has not been matched to any degree with an ability to understand the significance of the moral dilemmas that occur these days. We are still rather prehistoric in that regard.  Sleep time for me.

       New words in my block   The primacy affect is quite pronounced when it comes to learning words by Word Of the Day. The first few words are still quite clear. Flummery et al. are easily recalled, yet recent word acquisitions are not so salient in my mind. Anyhow, I am sure my story making is etching&nbsp;at least some of the&nbsp;words into my mind,&nbsp;like a&nbsp; lapidary  quote on a ancient stone wall. Here is my latest mnemonic story:    The princess sat in the courtyard of the castle twiddling her thumbs, when suddenly her  beau ideal  for a&nbsp;suitor strode in. Her&nbsp;knowledge of charm and seduction was restricted to a  sciolism  of such skills observable in&nbsp;nursery rhymes&nbsp;and the folk-tales her mother told her as a child.&nbsp;So with a  treacly   song, she tried to&nbsp; ensorcell  him.     &nbsp;  On hearing her voice, his feet appeared to stick to the floor, as if glued, preventing his progress. He looked around to see her. She was jaw-droppingly stunning, and while his guard and jaw were lowered, his gaping mouth dried rather quickly. So he pulled a small bottle from his pocket and swigged from it twice.  The drink acted as a  roborant ,  strengthening his machismo, and making his cheeks a bright  incarnadine .  Momentarily, his&nbsp;advance toward her was halted in order to release an  eructation   of some note (a note much higher than you would expect). Then he came to her side and in a well-practice manouevre, reaching for her hand and kissing her from her wrist to elbow.    &nbsp;  "What's a pretty princess like you..." "Where can we go?&nbsp;We need a&nbsp;place where no-one will find us!" she interrupted&nbsp;assertively. "To the  aerie !" He cried. Lifting her over his shoulder, caveman-style, and ascended the stairs.    (to not be continued)

       When&nbsp;good feet go bad   Or should that be when bad feet go worse? The day I was going to resume running, my foot&nbsp;almost failed my fitness test. The weather was terrible so I pushed my run day further back. I have worn my foot brace for most of today, and will do so tomorrow. If it passes the test Saturday morning, a run will be done.   Cryptic when we meet   It seems wherever I go, there are  crypticians about . Or at least people to be enticed into the fold. At my last practicum, I found a couple of teachers chomping at the bit to do cryptic crosswords together. It has become more apparent that I am far from alone, nor expert, compared to some of my classmates in my course too. One such classmate is Tiri is a case in point. She tells me she hardly had a chance to start the crossword, then reveals half of the gaps being filled with letters. Her knowledge is what is even more stunning, cracking the following two:    Where those for the ferry were always late   (4) ->  STYX  (which I can understand but wouldn't have a chance in Hades of getting)   Well, it's near a disturbance   (8) ->  ARTESIAN  (which is a well, apparently)  This is only a sample of what was an amazing demonstration of clue-cracking. I am training another classmate at solving clues but she may have surpassed me in two days penetrating the concise:    Outstanding Manager   (4) ->  BOSS  (as in outstanding is something that has been embossed).  My contribution was restricted to the more arcane ones:    Attractive perch on top of the world   (8,4) ->  MAGNETIC POLE   (to which I leaped in joy for getting)    Not an area of growing importance in Asia   (4) ->  GOBI  (which is hardly direct, but proved ARTESIAN, which Tiri intuitively remembered being a word)  On the bus, with only&nbsp;one go, I cracked the final really cryptic "cryptic clue".    Not a figure of speech!   (6) ->  STATUE  (like who could get that? I was lucky to have two "t"s so I could aimlessly fit words into it).  Mind you, the above might not be right (we'll see tomorrow morning), but it is complete. My newly learnt&nbsp;words from this single crossword are: Artesian, outre, unbred, mal-de-mer&nbsp;and&nbsp;sea fever. Quite extraordinary.   I am feeling I am bringing a nerdish element to the lunchroom at the School of Education. But everyone is convinced I am&nbsp;a genius. "If in doubt, ask Daniel."

       Coz' this is the aftermath   The first week back from practicum was a struggle but it is only in the second week that the smoke has really started to clear. Post-practicum trauma was a hidden epidemic that is only now coming to light. I was stricken but with the eventual meeting with the course co-ordinator allowed me to release my burden and by doing so I have&nbsp;prevented another person being stuck with such a pedagogically deficit practicum school. Yesterday (Monday) I bumped into another agrieved classmate who was quite determined to go to the student who was due to go to her school in the next practicum and tell him how terrible it will be. I calmed her down and said that we should go to the administrator first. But she didn't come today. Then, in the middle of a lecture another disgruntled student suddenly unleashed pent up frustration upon a lecturer mid-lesson. It was embarrassing and awkward for everyone. The lecturer, being put on the spot, politely asked to meet with this person but was spurned twice.   After class, I met with another few students and we discussed things and then other concerns and worries arose.  There is a right way and a wrong way to air such problems. I think it is interesting that people still struggle to air their worries in a proper forum.

       Das Experiment    The lab  rat  that I am, I am using myself again in an experimental way. People say that eating  fish  is good for the brain. Well that is fine, because my  brain    is really getting drunk on its own stupidity. It is&nbsp;scrapping&nbsp;the bottom of the cerebral barrel, at the moment. I have lost my umbrella again. I almost lost my second orange cap. I lost my bus card and now owe $9 in overdue fees for a library book.   If I were to start eating fish again for a period of time, would I noticeably remember more or&nbsp;think more clearly? Well, I am going to find out.     Fish   are back on the menu.

       Endless  Sunshine  on a  Spotless   Mind   ( ESoaSM  for short)    (this is long, first is a bit of theorising,&nbsp;which may&nbsp;be fiction but is my analysis based on my minimal knowledge of&nbsp;film-making&nbsp;history, but I like the writing which provokes thinking, and then after all that, there is a review of the movie itself)    The end of the 20th century might be noted for a change in the key players in&nbsp;movies. In "arty" movies of the past, the director was key. Looking at such movies, you might not note any star actor. Hollywood movies were the opposite, the director is just a hidden man behind the stars who are the ones you remember about the film. There were a few blips in the past of course.  Stanley Kubrick &nbsp;movies were clearly his.  George Lucas  also became a famous name&nbsp;Maybe they were the leaders.   But later, in&nbsp;the 1990s, "Hollywood" directors seemed to become more prominent. They seemed to want the movies to be identified as their own, and in that way reduce the&nbsp;importance of the stars.  Quentin Tarantino  and  Steven Spielberg  are directors that easily come to mind. Tarantino's style was clear but&nbsp;Spielberg's movies are varied in their style though, and the content still not particular to his (this is not to detract from the quality of his movies, but to say that they are not uniquely his in style).&nbsp; M. Night Shyamalan  began created movies with a particular distinct style. He was also brave enough to make his name bigger on the advertisements for Signs, than  Mel Gibson  (!). This&nbsp;seemed a big statement to me.&nbsp;Perhaps, there is now an trend towards bringing "Hollywood" and "arty" together. Or at least fill in the middle-ground. More arty movies are showing at Village Cinemas, which could be showing that they are becoming more financially rewarding.   I like this trend.&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;  Charlie Kaufman , like  M. Night , has created a genre of films that are virtually identifiable as his own. They usually are bound to an unlikely, unreal pretext. Take  Being John Malkovich  where there is a porthole to a particular person's mind.&nbsp;They often&nbsp;contain&nbsp;eccentric characters seemingly unrealistic characters, take  Adaptation 's lead brothers.&nbsp;His movies&nbsp;are all swathed in complex formats, with&nbsp;flashbacks, circular plots and voice-overs (which as one of his movies intones, is a movie-making sin!). But soon as these factors are set, he sets about making all the characters and the film as serious as possible.&nbsp;Any parody or irony is done with deadpan seriousness. All&nbsp;plot-tricks are done with pinpoint precision. All oddities are applied consistently.    (the following is the review section, there are spoilers in it)     ESoaSM  seems to be a distilled pure form of his previous movies. It is much more simplistic than  Adaptation  in format and concept, but still is delightfully complex (if you can understand that).&nbsp; The concept is flawlessly pulled off. The concept being:&nbsp;Joel's girlfriend impulsively gets her memory wiped of all her memories of you after a tiff, so he does likewise but in the middle of the procedure finds he wants to keep the memories and tries to fight the treatment, trying desperately hide his memories of her wherever he can.   The lead actors  Jim Carrey  (Joel) and  Kate Winslet  (Clementine) are wonderfully in with the spirit of the film.  Carrey  shows again that he can act very competently outside of the realm of facial and scatiological humour. Of course, he has his chance to show that experience in that form of humour can pay off in other movie types. When his childhood bully picks on him, it is just hilarious.  Kate &nbsp;is just awesome to watch. She&nbsp;has distinguished herself as a capable actor in all the films I have seen her in. But this might be her best. I might see  Iris  another day to see her act there.    Frodo  (read:  Elijah Wood ) also appears early, requiring a double-take, in the beginning and through the movie. And so does the technique that made Frodo look so small in the&nbsp; LOTR  trilogy. I just love the size of that  c  o  o  k  i  e  toddler Joel was holding!   The format is a jumping timeframe with flashbacks and the present time spliced, which at first is disorientating, but is easy to follow once you observe the cues. The dent in his car and their "second/first" courtship serve as signposts to align the timelines correctly. Of course, many of his memories are jumbled and the timeline&nbsp;can be&nbsp;filled in. And the movie wouldn't work without the jumping timeline, and it serves as part of the magic of the film.   Also interesting is the fact that there is a nice moral to the story. Memories, painful or not, are important. If you wipe them from your mind, you are almost bound to do the same mistakes. The ending is smooth too. It doesn't try to make things sweet and stick them back together. The reality of their past is too much to keep them together. Forgetting their differences doesn't make them any more compatible.   I got into the film for $7.50 because I am a poor beneficiary and got in before 5pm on a Friday. I would say this ranks equally  exceptional  with  Adaptation. Adaptation  had more variety and was more witty, but  ESoaSM  was clinically done and done with  simplicity  that I enjoy. (For the record, I only ranked  Being John Malkovich   good  but with aspirations for exceptional, while ranking&nbsp; Confessions of a Dangerous Mind &nbsp;as  mediocre  , with aspirations for craphood)     And that is the end of my film watching spree. I won't watch one till I use my free ticket sometime between now and mid-September. I must say that this has been an enjoyable set of movies.     MISTAKE: Sorry,  Charlie  Kaufman is the  scriptwriter  not the director, but is the scriptwriter for all the other movies too. I think my point in the theorising part is even more compelling if you think that even scriptwriters are being identified through their work!

       Sunrise, Sunset     &nbsp;  A now to be expected "unexpected" cancellation of a lecture allowed me the time to take advantage of $10 B-grade movie tickets on a Friday morning. I saw  Before  Sunset  , a sequel to the movie  Before  Sunrise  .   If you haven't seen the first movie (a recommended movie), it goes a little something like this:&nbsp;A young American and a young French woman meet by chance. They wander around Vienna incessantly chatting about philosophy, life and love. They irritate each other at times, but naturally and believeably fall in love. But the hook is that he has to leave on a flight early in the morning so their whole relationship is the night. They promise to meet&nbsp;9 years later. It is thought-provoking, humorous and touching.    Before&nbsp;Sunset &nbsp;is an incidental&nbsp;meeting between the two after&nbsp;circumstances prevented the promised meeting to come to fruition. It is in the same format, walking, sitting, sailing&nbsp;but all that time talking. He will be leaving back to America at  sunset  so,&nbsp;of course,&nbsp;they must do their catch-up within that time. The movie is quite different from its predecessor in terms of emotion. The first movie was primarily optimistic. The second film we can feel the pessimism, the bitterness that their experience earlier had prevented them truly bonding with their partners. It is a logical contrast of the enthusiasm of  youth  versus middle-age  dissatisfaction .   Both movies in the series are&nbsp;surely the complete opposite of  Goodbye, Dragon Inn  with any action in the movies&nbsp;being completely incidental, and&nbsp;the lengthy dialogue the heart and soul. The first movie was very likeable&nbsp;and also touching, but I always had a feeling of it being too fantastic. It reads like a story I would write (but not as cryptic) where philosophical points are illuminated in each turn of sentence. The endless fascinating conversations flow far too easily and it seems they both had saved them up just for this encounter.&nbsp;They are all the discussions you dream of having with someone.&nbsp;But if you can surpress that feeling of disbelief, these movies are wondrous.   In terms of the two movies, the second tends to trump the first in terms of feeling, but that is natural. It is more affecting and you can feel the frustration that exists between the two. But I don't think these two movies should be judged separately, as the second could not happen without the first. Both of them are  very good movies , but not exceptional in my estimation  (addendum)   But I would say together they make an   exceptional   movie experience.

       The  urlLink Corporation     Well, a 140 minute documentary, enthralling?  The Corporation  does what  Farenheit 9/11  could probably never do (although I have not seen it). It  captivates  you with brutal facts and the unambushed words of real people.    The Corporation  takes the words of CEOs, real life people and cases to both shock and give hope. There are plenty of voices including  Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein, Milton Friedman  and of course  Michael Moore.  In fact, it is mostly composed of voices of others rather than the manipulating voice of a narrator (a la Moore),   One of the interesting sticking points of the whole movie was that in America, through the unlikeliest of processes, an incorporated company has the same rights as an human individual. This is true in New Zealand too apparently. Therefore it is legal to hold property, sue, be sued etc. But, as the film would like to point out, if it is an individual, does it have morality? What is its personality? If we consider the actions of some corporations,&nbsp;they would fulfill&nbsp;all the requirements to be considered  psychopaths  as per the DSM-IV psychiatric assessment. Do we as a society have control of these undesireables? Yes we do, if we want to (the whole punchline of the film).   At some points, it made you cringe (Monsanto's sins take a lot to swallow). It is often ironically humorous ( Michael Moore  was comic relief but the words from actual people's mouths is perhaps the most startlingly humorous). Its production is excellent. At the end, you are certainly in a state of information overload, but you can't help but be affected.   The director  Mark Achbar  was there at the start and end willing to do Q&A and explain deeply some of the details of the "making of" and his thoughts on the current system. Interesting questions did come up although he had to give it to other people sometimes, "How much would our tickets cost without the sponsorship of Telecom?"   As a documentary, it MUST rate as an  exceptional  one. It was&nbsp;affective, and served for me as an antithesis to my musing on political liberalism.&nbsp;It didn't answer everything though. For example, it raised the example of  urlLink Cochabamba  (a city in Bolivia) of why water privatisation was flawed proposition. BUT, it didn't say how the necessity for water privatisation was controlled. Of course, I can research that.  The&nbsp;last&nbsp;phase of the movie was one thing that set it apart in that it made many suggestions for the forms change could take.&nbsp;I am glad I watched it.

       Another interesting   dream ...&nbsp;  This was quite interesting just because of the  negativity  of emotion (not that common for me).   For some reason, I was on a  trail , sometimes following a few people, sometimes on my own.&nbsp; On the trail there were numerous  obstacles , and sometimes I had to walk on along a&nbsp; precipice . Eventually I crashed or fell or maybe just got stuck in a room. And suddenly their were lots of people around&nbsp;me. It  annoyed  me a lot. One put his hand on me so I grabbed his hand and tried to  pierce  it with my thumb. Everyone joking said, "He's  annoyed , leave him alone."   Well there was more to it than that but my grip of the images was loose although I think this is the same as what remembered at 9am (it is now 4pm). Sometimes I wonder if my memory constructs some of the details to my remembered dreams.

      And now for another episode of WordCity:   "The   leadership   of the city was ineffectual in every extent of the word, leading the citizens into  debauchery  that&nbsp;is unheard of in the last few millenia.&nbsp;In a desperate &nbsp;attempt to stop the exigent threat of&nbsp;complete  chaos , the councillors implemented  draconian  laws to restrain the rioting. They obviously lacked the social acuity to notice one important&nbsp;salient detail: The rioting was for the purpose of overthrowing their&nbsp;foolish governance, of which their current measures were a symptom!  Pandemonium  ensued. Suddenly a  supernal force  flew down from the skies entreating them all to be silent. The   drunken   quit their  libations . The&nbsp;ringleaders halted their agitations.&nbsp;The anxiety-pandemic, that had since infected all other regions, ceased momentarily and   peace   prevailed ever so slightly. Everyone was so shocked that they wandered in a  hypnagogic  state not knowing if they were  dreaming  or otherwise. But the  aliens  really did want a quieter Universe so were quite unsure whether extermination or persuasion was necessary to cut down the noice pollution of this&nbsp;excessively raucous   planet  ."   Don't ask me what happens next~!

       Total   Eclipse   of the Timetable   &nbsp;    University   administration must be a  diabolical  job. At least, what I have seen today strongly evinces such.&nbsp;Most students (many of whom were rather stressed about impending   assignments   and the  thorn -in-the-side Thursday  test ) got up early to come to the timetabled 9am lecture...&nbsp;in a classroom, which in  radical  style had  OCCUPIED  by a group of DipEd( Secondary )... for their scheduled lecture. And the room timetable attested to the fact that we  were not  the rightful people to fill that lecture-room. OK. Most&nbsp;of us&nbsp;then  bull rushed their way up to the  computer  room to seize the scarce supply of  computers.  10am came. And again we clogged up the hallway to the lecture room (about 80 of us all in a small hallway), to find, no our class would not be here as another class was booked in. We held our printed timetables aloft and said  "No!"  in  solidarity .&nbsp;It was then that&nbsp;a  frazzled  looking replacement course co-ordinator jumped up the stairs like a  spring   rabbit , with apologies blazing, and explained a compromise, that we start our paper at 12pm and go until 3pm. "All-righty!" we called and swarmed our ways back to the  computer  room, which in our distraction, had been filled with the DipEd(Secondary)s! Agh.  &nbsp;  Anyway,  order  has come back to this  chaotic  campus  offshoot . In the meantime, I have probably given my assignments the biggest  growth  spurt since day one (when it burst from  nothingness , like the scientifically not 100% substantiated  Big Bang ).

       Blackout~  &nbsp; You know your holidays are over when you get home and  collapse  on the couch. Oh dear, not even the   invigorating   effects of  Lady Grey  could stir me.  &nbsp; Once I arose, however, in an unusual burst of  energy  I tidied the  decay  and  tartar  that had accumulated all over my desk and floor, increasing available space two-fold. I am still to  floss  the cupboard, but that can be done in time.  Strange  how this never really happened during the holiday. &nbsp; Two assignments handed in today, but they are not the ones to be  feared .

        Oops,&nbsp;it did it again~     &nbsp;  My morning fitness test (getting out of bed) revealed a still very sensitive, and not so kind inside ankle. Being a patient person, I am prepared to give it a bit more time to mature and refrain from being so temperamental. Till then, no run.    &nbsp;  Being at school again is quite a treat. I got up at the wrong time in that I set my alarm clock for the time I thought I usually set it, but&nbsp; that  time was actually&nbsp;the time I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;get up&nbsp;for my practicum school on time, rather than University. But I feel rather relaxed with so much time to spare. I will even hand in my assignments in the morning to get them off my mind immediately.

       The  Family   Thicket ~   &nbsp;  My latest review will be on&nbsp;the locally made movie headlining the film festival,  In my father's den . It is a story that was the portrayal of a story by a   NZ   author ( Maurice Gee ).  &nbsp;  Small town life is something that I was born into but left before things really got tricky. Some movies go into the depth of the hidden side to this quaint life, where the secrets are thicker than  water , and so is the  blood  of the families that form small communities. This is one such movie.  &nbsp;  To understand the characters, we all need to have some sense of   depth   perception. The protagonist,  Paul , is&nbsp;quite pained at the best of times. In fact, we can see pain in many of the characters. But the search for the root of the pain is the quest of the audience, as much of it is known to the characters.  &nbsp;  Simply put, it is a story of  homecoming,   alienation ,  friendship  and a  disappearance &nbsp;possibly due to&nbsp;  foul   play, or is it a run away? There are  hsalf 's and  flash forwards that are crucial to the story but often to the detriment of the orientation of the viewer.  &nbsp;  As a production, it is most impressive. The acting shows that   New Zealand   does have much depth.&nbsp;The cinematography and sets&nbsp;were stunningly  realistic . As it was a premiere we got to see those at the   heart   of bringing it together including most of the cast.  &nbsp;  One thing that came across quite coincidentally was the links between the very different film I reviewed before,  Old Boy . Both have strange hidden plots of  real ,  accidental &nbsp;and  imagined &nbsp;incestuous relationships. The hearts to both  puzzles  lie with the question that is not focussed on. And similarly, when the final pieces of   the  puzzle  is put in the story becomes credible. For me, I would rate it as a   good   movie, also possibly stretching into the  exceptional  category.

       Things that go.....    &nbsp; In the night, I had an interesting  dream . It was diverse with lots of different strands, with a dark  gothic  feel. Somehow the first dream was converted into a book I had written in the second dream. Apparently Ying read it in that dream and said it was good and I should publish it. And the third dream had a nasty supercreature in it. Anyway, in the morning I found one of my curtains had been pulled open and my pyjama top removed. Aside from the possibility that there is some  c  r   e   a  t i  v    e  burglar who doesn't take things,&nbsp;I assume that it was  I  who did these things. I have no memory of it whatsoever. Maybe it is the sleepwalking streak coming out again. It has been a while since I did something  completely  without awareness and memory in my sleep (of course sometimes I can't remember things well when awake...). When I was young I once let my eldest sister into my house without remembering.

       How do you  feel?    I have seemingly dropped in a pit of melancholy without the choly, from which my limbs can get no traction. I am not one to feel sad about much. In a recent "Bar News" described depression as anger without enthusiasm. Well I might be stricken with depression without sadness. Ennui, but without the exotic sounding charm.  I hate to say this but: The sooner this holiday is over the better. I can get start doing stuff with consistency. I will hand in substandard assignments and have to wait weeks before the "punishment" in receiving a grade.  Anyway, distracting myself for a moment, I was thinking about the depression of others.  Nuch of the modern music I listen to is often done by seemingly-depressed people. I cannot imagine Radiohead, Tricky, the Eels, Coldplay, Massive Attack, L'arc~en~ciel, Tool/Perfect Circle or TaoZhe producing a cheery song (David Bowie can though). There is real feeling there though. Not the unfortunately popular strains of pop you can hear to readily.  Looking through the blogs of others, it is easy to see that there is a self-tormenting, dare I say it "artistic" bunch that like to wallow in sadness. Perhaps it does make for affecting words, music and art. I have a theory for this of course, although it is hardly original. To have a desire for greatness, people need to suffer. I think that is something I have lacked in my life actually. In the past though, there was plenty to be vexed by. Poverty or war and the like.  But those who have some desire towards experiencing and producing exemplary art (regardless of its form) need to delve into those things that can cause suffering in life, bring them close to mind, taking themselves into the coldness of life, and its natural vicissitudes, a strain of existentialism perhaps. Even from the comfort of modern life, there is suffering without pain, or with pain if they want to self-administer.  And hopefully from this hurt emerges a truly feeling voice or a simple expression of real expression and not the saccharine pipe-tune of some life "charlatan". Like me.  Probably real genius doesn't depend on the tempering one's heart with fiery coals of despair. It can emerge with force and passion without. But such tapped talent is rare. I cannot think of such. Or maybe all geniuses are destined to suffer a little which triggers them. Or maybe those talented who are not subjected to despair or self-brutalised are those that don't find an emotion on which to hinge their ability onto.  Either way, I am not seeking to be an artist of the kind that is recognised as an artist. I simply want to get some direction to overcome the inertia.

       Interlooper~   I jogged around the greater block in 16:35. I should be able to shave 1-2 minutes off that should I actually press myself to run (provided I can make it to the end).   Movie news   Anyway, my movie review for today is "Goodbye, Dragon Inn", which I saw last night.   Before going to such a film, it is advisable to be familiar with the kind of movies the director makes.  Vive L'amour  was the first movie I saw of his. It was devoid of almost any dialogue or script. It made an art of understanding feelings and intention purely from the action observed.   Goodbye, Dragon Inn  is done by the director  Tsai Ming-Liang , a Taiwanese director who seems to enjoy this sort of movie. It takes some adaptation of the viewer to enjoy watching them. If someone were to inadvertently see this film without understanding that they might be somewhat confused.  The movie is set in a cinema, whose popularity has somewhat dwindled. That being said, there seems to be many people wandering through its cavernous architecture. There are few seeming real people there, but one is a young man who sneaked into the cinema, who we only find out later, is Japanese. He seems out of place in amongst the other denizens (much like someone who doesn't understand such films might feel). All he wants is someone to light his cigarette. So he tries languageless cues to get people's attention. He fails most of the time. All through the sounds and artificial dialogue of the movie being echoes throughout the place, emphasising the lack of speech from the "characters". There are some bizarre scenes. With a door shutting by itself. Another opening. Possible homoerotic themes. And then the endless people passing through the passageways the Japanese guy finds himself. In the first dialogue of the film, eliciting applause from one of my fellow theatre-goers, it is revealed: "This cinema is haunted," and then followed up by "It is haunted!" We never know if the Japanese man understands but he finally gets his light before saying in Japanese-accented Chinese "Wo shi ribenren" (I am Japanese). "Sayonara" comes back the reply. Regardless of whether he understands what was told to him, later, in probably the most comic moment he is scared witless and runs from the cinema.   All the time, the lady at the front desk (who has a whithered or prosthetic leg) struggles around the cinema on different quests.   On the whole, I enjoyed the movie (more than  Vive L'amour , but perhaps only because I had checked my expectations for the movie). I wouldn't rank it any higher than "Good", just because it doesn't have in a movie everything I look for, but it was a nice excursion into a completely different world. It is these kinds of movies that you can lose yourself in easily though. Another theatre-goer remarked the similarity of the screen flow and that of the movie. The movie on the screen in the movie was a martial arts movie. But often in such movies, it is just lurching from one fight scene to another with justification in between, before ending and fading without a trace.

       What was that you said?   In amongst my chronic short-term amnesia stories, comes the truly classic. This one precedes my morning run just reported. I already knew I had misplaced my watch the previous day so I knew that had to be found first to time my run. I then realised my ankle support (which I use for my running) had also wandered and needed a search party. The ankle support was in a conventional hiding-place (the laundry basket) but the watch came out in a truly bizarre fashion. I was hunting through the piles of Uni-related stuff for it when suddenly I saw a book I had on 3-day short loan that had to be back two days ago. Short-loan books sometimes are charged overdue by the hour, so I raced to my computer to check if I had received a notice etc. But just before I arrived at my computer I found that I had, in my hand, my watch...  I have no idea at what stage I picked it up. But there it was.  After the panir cheese experiment of 2 days ago with lemon juice (very successful, very yum!), I am now trying the alternative recipe using the yoghurt that I made a few days previously, it looks promising so far!

       Where is the asymptote?   I ran this morning and registered 9:10, a mere 7 seconds faster than last time. My ever-receding target time is now just to inch my way past the 9 minute mark. I think where any extra speed will come from is the beginning where I am usually sluggish and usually have the same doubts whether I will actually be able to do the whole circuit without stopping. I have two time markers to check my progress. The 2:48 intersection and the 6 minute roundabout.  So up steps plan B! I will shift to the greater block for a week before coming back to the lesser block. Practising the greater block will give me a bit of variety and stretch my endurance rather than speed.

       Use it or lose it   "In every rowdy party, where most of the revellers drink with gusto, congeries of teetotalers are to be found. Sometimes there is one in each corner of the room. Dry but controversial discussions are started and sometimes things get heated. Overweening self-righteousness amongst a group tends to lead to acrimony after all. The more rational would speak with impassioned polemics, which the more radical take as pure unctous flummery. Of course, there would also be the happy-go-lucky member whose ludic comments and mimicry would break the tension momentarily. Usually the discussion was something as irrelevant as how we should remunerate the politicians. This kind of subject would drive most to drink in short time."  Well, that was a week of "Word of the Day" words all incorporated into a vaguely sensible story. Don't ask me what happens next.

       Decreasing  MRI    Another run this morning, and my marginal rate of improvement has plummetted! Ah well: 9 minutes 17 seconds.  It was rather frosty this morning which almost made me unable to turn off my stopwatch due to numb, uncoordinated fingers. Instead of nausea after the run, I gained a cough. Maybe my respiratory system has noticed that in order to increase efficiency it has to clean up my airways.   I think so too, at the start of my run I was struggling and thought I wouldn't even get close to my last time. But as is usual when you are improving, speed gains just come from nowhere.

       Predetermination   To have disbelief in predetermination is a rational thing to do. That is, if you subscribe to the same logic as Pascal's wager.  If you believe in predetermination, and predetermination exists, you enjoy that things are secure and will work out. But if predetermination weren't true, you'd be left disappointed or confused.  However if you don't believe in predetermination, and predetermination is true, you will end up wherever you are meant to end up, and if predetermination were a false belief, you'd be right and thinking correctly.  So to disbelieve predetermination is a win/win situation, whereas there is a risk of disappointment in belief.  That being said, I have had lots of moments to think that something guides the coincidences in my life. But it is far more interesting to think they are pure coincidences.

      I will review movies I see from now on on my Blog.  I started my Auckland Film Festival campaign last night with the Korean film " Old Boy ".  The premise of the film is simply that one night, a quite drunk man, is abducted and kept in a makeshift prison hotel room for 15 years. Every now and then valium gas washes over him. Knocking him out for haircuts, new clothes and things like that. Food is given. He doesn't know that it will be 15 years that he is in for and doesn't know why. He verges on madness many times. And then... He is released, waking up on a rooftop, with nice clothes and eventually he is given a cellphone and a wad of money. At this point I could honestly say that I couldn't imagine a way that this would ever acquit itself logically.  If a film hinges itself on plot, then the plot must come through for it. I like movies that can come up with a unexpectedly decent end. I can say that was part of the reason I liked  Matchstick Men , it was well-crafted (although, apparently with a couple flaws) and it has a kicker of an ending.  I enjoyed  Old Boy  in a similar way, perhaps more so. It delivered a visceral, explicit tale of revenge (in more ways than one!). There was nothing concealed except the plot, which although I had my doubts at different points, clarified all of those doubts and more in the long end sequence. It is a story about revenge bur perhaps more importantly shame.  The acting is great. Some of the scenes are improbable, but entertaining all the same. If you cannot take scenes showing the excessive infliction of pain, or sex scenes (that become much more 'illicit" by then conclusion of the movie), then don't see it. It was a funny, enjoyable movie. Recommendable by me. In my ratings of films it easily makes it into the category of "Good film", while potentially challenging "Exceptional Film".  It won the Grand Prix award at Cannes.  One small side note is that the epilogue (the bit at the end, concluding the drama) was filmed in New Zealand.   Park Chan-wook  was the director, whose work includes  Joint Security Area  (an exceptional movie in its own right). So I think I will be looking out for his future efforts or his other work, the interestingly named  Sympathy For Mr Vengeance .

       "Don't you wonder sometimes 'Bout sound and vision?"    Sound:  In my classical music tastes, I don't particularly like Mozart (except for Symphony no. 40) to anything like the appreciation I have for Beethoven. And there are many composers I like better than Beethoven. Dvorak is one that I am interested in exploring. Serenade in E major is to die for.  Well, with the sound out of the way, now for the vision.   Vision:  For most of the year, actually since the disappointment of the way my previous birthday party logisitically went, I have been contemplating another kind of an event. This crystallised in to "Strange Night", a possibly regularly organisable event, which is constructed by people, rather than by a person.  Well, that was the idea. But ideas tend to just sit and observe as time goes by. Without the vision for the event, there is nothing to provide one with the drive to get it done~ Suddenly last night, I was inspired. It was not that what I thought and then proceeded to scribble down was anything revolutionarily great, but that suddenly I caught how I would like such an event to go. An idea of perfection, a goal, something to strive for. And so now all I need is to clarify a date, send out an e-mail and it will be done. Cool, eh.   "I will sit right down Waiting for the gift of sound and vision And I will sing Waiting for the gift of sound and vision. Drifting into my solitude Over my head  Don't you wonder sometimes 'Bout sound and vision?"

       Time and Change   I whipped around the lesser block in 9:33 removing 1:04 off my time, which was pleasing at first, but easily rationalised. What runner, when starting running again, does not get big gains? Also, I can remember that the first time I ran I was being gentle on my cobweb bound legs, and started at a conservative speed. This time at the start I automaticallk launched into what would have been a natural speed, which with my fitness was not going to be easy to maintain. I have to learn what my sustainable speed for a distance is, and then constantly push this. I felt a little nauseous after the run, meaning that my body was stretched. Either way, I hope to get within +/-5 of 9 minutes on my next run.

       Slow start   Holidays bring out the worst in me, I am sure. I am so lethargic and distractable and currently running at about 20% efficiency at everything.  Anyway, on a mildly different strand.  I, for the nth time, started running again. Getting back into running fitness is very much a new challenge for me, because ever since I was 8 I went running with my sister (she was a budding athlete) I had a good degree of latent fitness. When I went running at high school, it took only a few runs to get into "gear", find the "zone" and dash around.  Now, after the inactivity of university and teaching and the intervening foot problems, that foundation has been eroded. I struggled to keep running for 10 minutes 37 seconds for a run around the "lesser" block (there are two different "blocks", the lesser is naturally the smaller of the two). In my running days, I think I may have been able to whip around it in 6-7 minutes.  Remembering back to when I was at high school, I would almost have the fantastic motivation for running that I had to be fit and ready in the case of an imminent terrorist take-over of the high school (because you would need to be able to outrun etc.). Fortunately it was just the fitness that I saw as necessary, I didn't go to the firing range to practice using a firearm.  I need to get something to make me continue running. Maybe I should go back to competing against myself, trying to ground that 10:37 down to 8 minutes, while run walking, then running the "greater" block. Ah well, it is a plan.

       Fruitfall  (a.k.a Fruit F'all)  They covered the ground, Which was more orange than green Dewy grass wet my feet The wind blew again And no matter how many I pick up There always seems like so many on the ground  Is the neighbour watching? Don’t catch her eye, or else she may wave and come out Pick up the oranges And check for holes and slugs, Fungi and bugs. But still so many remain fallen down  The Foodtown plastic bag is near full, It might very well break Throw the little ones back And feed the tree and birds I have too many to eat Does anyone want any?  Honestly! I have lots, come and get them

        What problem?    And so, despite my prognostications and mildly uneasy open thoughts on the subject, my blood test has returned without any cause to be alarmed. No need to even go in for a chat with the doctor apparently, or so said the message on my cellphone. I want the raw numbers to compare with those from my preceding tests but otherwise I am pleasantly relieved.  But then what of my run of illness?  Maybe I wear myself down too much.  Maybe there is something wrong with what I eat. Or perhaps, I should just remind myself that getting sick is all part of the rite of passage for a beginning teacher, and that is what I am becoming~  Maybe I have been thinking too much. A chronic illness perhaps.  I wonder whether I should go through with getting the health insurance I was getting. But I can wipe medical fees from my budget for now, and that has to be good for my liquidity until October the 1st.   Any~ways...

       Language exchange   After a hiatus of 2 years, I have restarted doing language exchange. This time it is with my newly acquired language te reo Maaori. My exchange partner worked in China for a brief time and had tried to pick up Chinese at that time but had forgotten a lot, so I used my Chinese knowledge to trade for Maaori practice. She was quite shocked that I had quite substantial Maaori accumulated in my memory banks and was making sentences quite readily and even asked questions about how to say sentences that she struggled to know how to say.  It was productive though, it was so nice to hear sentence structures and be able to get an explanation. Sometimes the meaning just flowed into my mind, other times my brain froze under the intensity of a string of words which it declared as familiar but didn't want the further commitment of identifying.

        The Finest Cryptic    For a cryptic crossword fan like myself, crosswords bring pleasure and frustration. The biggest frustration known to crossword solvers would probably be a clue that you have many of the letters (provided by intersecting answers) yet still cannot crack the clue or fit a likely word.  Two such clues have a risen in the last week:  1.  Time-worn tea ceremony  (5)  letters supplied: T _ I _ E  This clue was impregnable to both me and the cryptic magician previously mentioned in this blog. We concluded that it must be a specific technical or archaic word that neither of us knew. It was only when we got the following day's paper that we discovered we were wrong. The answer is a logical and reasonable answer indeed yet we could not crack it.  Just yesterday, there was another:  2.  With which the Orientals show agreement  (4), letters supplied: E _ E _  This clue I was contemplating many times during an eight hour period where I also got the intersecting letters. The answer, which is actually reasonably obvious in retrospect, came to me intuitively rather than logically when I was tired and frustrated. But getting it brought ecstacy.  These two reflect a fine distillation of crypticity. A real mystery waiting to be cracked. Often clues are far too illustrative of the method by which they are to be solved. These two with their utilitarianism and simplicity show that although frustrating they are the finest cryptic clues.  (the answers will be in the comments page later, clue, they are essentially the same mechanism)   This message is a reconstructed version of a previous D.O.A blog I wrote last night.

       The Return of the Fierce Creatures   Another assorted dream brought back the big cats to my subconscious.  I have had several dreams lately about being in my teaching course. The classes are nothing like mine but we are learning teaching. None of the people in the class are from my teaching class either (or perhaps one or two that I can only vaguely remember). Anyway, last night I had to collaborate on a lesson to show our class with an Indian classmate. We did it on   tea  , a good topic. We were preparing the lesson when the guy suddenly put two  eggs  in the cup we were using and I just said "Oh, that is not the kind of   tea   I make." Anyway, while he got the tea ready, I found some wonderful ornamental vessels from which to drink the   tea   from, really nice ones although the shape was a little odd. My memory gets a bit fuzzy, and I think my classmate had rather illicit relations with a teacher in the interlude before we presented...  Then suddenly I was in a wall-less zoo, where the   lions   and the antelope are in one big field with me. Apart from being mildly apprehensive about the proximity of such carnivores nothing happened.   Fanciful things dreams are.

       Another new column   Haha, well I have found a category for myself. The Listener has a new column too called "Words Worth" which introduces readers to "new" words. Some of them seem a joke but maybe people use them somewhere..  Anyway, one of the words today was "Generation C", which means:    "Obsessive content generators. Often to be found snapping photos - of themselves - on their mobile phones for instant distribution to friends and family. Or constantly updating personal blogs with boring personal trivia."    Yeah that's me. But he/she makes it seem so narcissistic... Hmmmm maybe I am.....

       Today's Thought   Today's Thought is a little column in the New Zealand Herald daily. It is usually a little Biblical excerpt but with the facelift of the Herald there was an interesting change. The Weekend Herald now carries one Bible excerpt and one from a different religion. This is the one from last weekend:   Blessed is the man who fears the Lord, who   delights greately in his commandments.    - Psalm 112:1    I have been insulted! I have been hurt! I    have been beaten! I have been robbed!   Anger ceases in those who do not harbour   this sort of thought.   (Buddhism, Dhammapada)   Interesting!
