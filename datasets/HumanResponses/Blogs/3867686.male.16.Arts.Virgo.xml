      So here I am hanging out with Micklewhite at my place of residence. It's a cool time for the both of us because skies are made out of pudding. Man that would be cool. That way, if the sky ever fell, you could eat it. And eating the sky is how you can get into the Mickey Mouse Club, because that club is friggin' exclusive. Yep. Absolutely friggin' exclusive.

      Sorry I haven't updated in a while. I've been in a coma (a very SEXY coma ;) ) and then I woke up and found out that I had lost my pancreas. So that was a fun adventure to Calcutta to retrieve Lullabelle (my pancreas) and having a squabble with the FFFF (Forty Fighting F*R*I*E*N*D*S Fans). But luckily, I hugica and that's the only thing that matters. &nbsp; Aaaaaaaaanyway, life is good. I saw a film about a man who anchors the other day (I think it was called "Throw the ANCHOR: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Become a MAN" or something) and that was all grand. I think Ferrell is probably the best uncheeseburger working in the business today. He's kind of like Eddie Murphy....only.....you know.....funny. &nbsp; And John Kerry chose John Edwards as his running mate. To that I say, HOLD BACK ON THE JOHNS! Jesus Christ, there are only so many Johns we can take in a day. My quota is .5 so just meeting one John is too much. That explains the epilepsy I suffered at the They Might Be Giants concert.  &nbsp; And now I have to conclude this entry by saying: Be nerp.

      Yooooooooooo. It's meica again. And why have I decided to spend two valuable minutes which I could use to plant an invisible tree or fashion the world's largest eye brow in the world? (really, I could do it. Just give me enough muskrats and their coats will be tied together and then it will be long. I will find a man with a face that is 70ft. wide and put it above his eyes. Technically, this will be an eyebrow.) Well, the problem is that there still is absolutely nothing to do where I live. You see, I live in a town that has been RAVAGED by the apocalypse (an apocalypse that, for some reason, only affected one spot on the globe) wherein I am the only living being alive (if you don't count about 7000 others but....they never come into my field of vision) and I am on a quest. A quest for food and shelter. For you see, the human body enjoys placing food through its digestive system. It's like an adrenaline rush for it. I, particularly, do not enjoy food which I find too demanding. You must eat it every day, not once but THREE FUCKING TIMES! BERGH! And then there is the issue of shelter. You see, if you sleep outside and it is raining, you run the risk of getting pancreatic cancer (which is, we all know by now, a cancer for squares) and nobody wants THAT, do they? DO THEY?!?  Well, I don't believe I am doing anything today so be on the lookout for a few more blog entries later. Now I must find a chicken, skin its hide, and drink the sweet juice inside!   NOTE: The last sentence was meant to be a haiku. The fact that it wasn't illustrates how much ignorance has ravaged my brain stem.

            Yes, my friends, it is the 11th minute of the 20th hour of the 7th day of the 7th month. (Yeah, numbers are koo...) So I'm still incredibly bored. There truly is absolutely nothing to do, very few people to talk to, and nothing to tell them. Nothing is going on tomorrow and nothing happened yesterday. Truly, isn't that our lives as a whole? Just a bunch of nothing? I mean do our lives truly add up to absolutely nothing?                 Everyone would like to think that they made a difference somehow. Everyone wants to think that they are the ones that caused the world to be a better place. But, in the grand scheme of things, nothing seperates you from the 3rd Y that occurs on page 11 of the book One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish. And that is a comforting thought. How is it comforting, you ask? I shall provide suspense by putting all of my ideas into....the next paragraph and.......by.........using........a.......lot.........of...........these..........dots.................dots...............dots..........suspense..........is........being.........caused.......ica.............        Anyway...(dots)...if the goal of life was to be important, that means that we would have a hierarchy. That is what it seems like we have but, that is based on a society of money. One man may be richer than a poorer man but, in the grand scheme of things, they are both equal. That is the clincher. We are all equal. You are not seperated in any way from Mr. Bob Fallopian Tube of Wilmington, Delaware. We are in this together and we will die together. Death may frighten you but...we all die with hand clasped over the hand of another.       But yeah, Gangs of New York ***.

              Well, it seems that everyone and their Portugese vase makers has a blog now because, as a great poet (who must have not been THAT great to not have people remember his friggin name) once wrote, "The unexamined life is not worth living". People want others to look at them through a glass cage. The world, by now, is not a bunch of Starbucks and people eating food every day. No, instead it's a bunch of glass cages containing people. If someone is not watching you, you are not satisfied with you life.       I hesitated for a while against making a blog because, to put it bluntly, my life really is not that interesting. If someone decided to make JerTV (Like EdTV **1/2) one day, they would have to murder me just to bring up ratings. No I'm not complaining, I'm merely pointing out how little I do on a day to day basis. However, I realized that nearly EVERYONE has a blog now and, because I am deathly afraid of individualism, I decided to create my own blog. I mean, when even MICHAEL MOORE is cranking out entries in his blog, you can sense that having a blog has gone right past conformity and right into necessity.        So what did I do today? Well, I didn't do much. This summer thing is really grating on my nerves. There are only so many Ebert reviews you can read and re-read in one day. My eyes are about to fall out, they're so damn bleary. Plus with all of the rain we've had lately (or as I like to call it, unflammable non-solid drops), going to the pool and making fun of the lifeguards from afar while they whine about having two minutes shaved off of their break. And I think "Hey, man, at least you have a friggin job. Something that will occupy your time every day AND reward you with money (or as I like to call it, pocketsized earth mounds with no circumference). I've been trying to hunt down this job at this gym where I would film professional athletes working out. That way they can watch the videos for research. "Research".       So yes that is basically where I stand in the universe. It is a happy happy day for a happy happy ghey. Closing things and finishing things have never really been my forte (which is why I still, at 7:16 PM, have no pants on) so I'll just end it with a call to arms: AHH MEH MEH!
