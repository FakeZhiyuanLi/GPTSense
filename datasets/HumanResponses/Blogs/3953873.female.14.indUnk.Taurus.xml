       wow! what a day! we practiced our intermission number today. we needed 5 tricycles to get to Kring's house. lets say there're 6 persons on a tricycle (excluding the driver). we're almost 25 plus the 2 teachers who rode 5th tricycle, that means we're 27 there. we're so noisy. the house was like rumbling. we visited mrs. perez and her new borne baby. the baby was really cute. after our practice we went to jocel's house to record the sound effects. and then julie, jeff, pao and i went to eleo's house. as usual we chatted. we're laughing hard because we're reminiscing I-MATTHEW's kakulitan and all, especially berANGEL'S kakulitan. grabe! the way he teases bettina, ginaya rin namin. we talked about what would happen to us after years. kung lawyer na si ganyan, watch out for jeff, keith, jordle, jom, miggy sa uaap or even pba, tas buong klase andon to support them, nagiba ang araneta, kung isa na ba samin yung may ari ng pinakaCLASS na hotel s philippines, yung budbod nina jaime budburan na ng pilipinas, pag naging doctor isa samin libre paOPERA. we don't really want to go to college kasi alam namin na mamimiss namin isa't isa. nuhx!! ang drama!! but we know that we need to go to college kaya nga what if magtayo kami ng sariling boarding house e. si sir james magdedesign para libre, kami na lng mgpupupukpok. ganun e,noh?! 2nd year pa lang kami pero sobra na yung bonding. halos lahat close sa isa't isa, kahit lalaki at babae close. walang malisya pero may asaran. hindi kasi mawawala yun e. Ge dito na lang muna.

        yesterday afternoon, it was raining so we&nbsp;decided to go to Eleo's house,&nbsp;i mean in our lola's house. Syempre welcome kami dun!! Kami nina  Tarra, Jocel, Dianne, Jeffrey, Paolo, Kervin, Gerrele &nbsp;and syempre si  Eleo . We&nbsp;did the usual thing, which is our favorite,  KWENTUHAN !!! It&nbsp;all started with&nbsp;the game  truth or consequence (should be called truth or truth ;> ). Nobody accepted the answer consequence. At syempre wala ring gustong gumawa nun pano b naman ang consequence&nbsp; "halikan mo yung paso", "pick all the leaves in the garden", the easiest was "spell your name using your lips"  pero hindi pa rin ginawa ni Jeff. I'd choose not to do it also kasi i don't want to ruin my reputation. hehehe!!! yung mga questions naman ganito:  the favorite question, who's your crush?, if you were left on an island, who do you want to be with you?, who do you want to dance with you on the prom night(first and last dance,ha?)  yung iba hindi ko na matandaan e.     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today naman, we played volleyball and badminton. Kami nina  Eleo  and  Gerrele . That wasn't on our schedule talaga. Dapat mangugulo kami sa basketball ng boys kaya lang nahiya na kaming bumalik kina  kuya Miggy . KAhit papano nagpaalam naman kami na manggulo kami,ha.. What we did was naglaro ng volleyball, then we went to  Dianne's house  kasi may sakit (dinalan namin ng BuKwEt of flowers, di,we brought her 2 gumamelas na ninakaw namin sa kapitbahay, syempre we want to make her feel better, and isa pa that was on our assignment, o di ba helpful kami!!!), after that we went to  Jocel's house  ta's nanood kami ng  HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN&nbsp;10 DAYS . Balak ko ngang gayahin e. Parang may papatol e,noH?! Yeah i know, sasabihin niyo buti alam ko!!&nbsp;;>&nbsp;          &nbsp;    &nbsp;

          August 11 to nangyari. After school, we went to Eleo's house to polish our play. I know that others hate me for my being so strict to them. and im really sorry. then after that, other classmates hurried home. Eleo, Paolo, Jocel, Jeff, Jordle, Tarra, Anthony, Julie and I were left 'cause we had to finish the props. we made the props while chatting. yeah, bonding time e! we we're also eating. Nagdala si Jeff ng gotcha e. It's delicious! maybe it's because masarap kasabay kumain mga classmates ko! Nuhx naman!! then eleo and tarra brought back 10 barbeques. umalis kasi sila. we prayed together as if we're a family. Our parents are jocel and jordle. what aperfect match! we asked dear God to help us in everything. We added, if it's his will, let us win and it came true. Thanks to him. Sarap kumain kasabay classmates. Naglabas si eleo ng rice. syempre share-share. saya!!!

       This is the big day,  the competion in english. When  my classmates were performing I was so tense and didn't know what to do. I want to say sorry to my classmates because I doubted them. James really proved me wrong. He was really great although there were some mistakes. It's just fine 'cause his nervous. Julie also proved me wrong. She acted with feelings. She's really. All my classmates are really good. We won! We're first place. I admit. Jeremiah and Daniel's performance were really superb. That's why Im thankful to God that he let us win. When Mrs. Mazo was about to announce the 3rd placer, I was really waiting the words "two isaiah" from her mouth. But it's Daniel that came out. When she said " and the 2nd placer is", I was so nervous and at the same time expecting our section from her mouth. Then finally she said Jeremiah!  Nagtilian lahat ng Isaiah!!   All my hardships,   pati pagod at puyat ,  all of them suddenly vanished.  Sobrang happy ko.  We had our victory party at Eleo's house. Ang saya!         i'll probably miss the times when we're doing the costumes. Ang saya kasi e! Grabe!

       i met a girl from the other section.  secret na lang kung anong  section.  i heard comments about her.  they said she's not that nice. nakakainis! the fact that she's so nice to me, sa iba hindi. i also know new acquaintances na mababait sakin sa iba hindi. why don't they show me their real colors? ako naman i show others the real me. matigas ang ulo ko, masamang kaaway, i believe that im nice sa mga kaibigan ko, frank ako, tactless din,  basta sa mga friends mabait ako, lalo na sa mga bestfriends ko, pag galit ako malalaman mo hindi katulad ng iba na masyadong mgpretend, pag malungkot malalaman mo kasi hindi ako madaldal. ganyan. wala lang... iniisip ko nga baka nasakin yung problem e...   : >

       its saturday,isn't it? we had classes! err.. well, there's nothing to be angry about. everything was fine even though we didn't get to watch the tryout of basketball. we promised to support our classmates but as ussual there was an order. Baloca ordered the guard not to let other students in. just the ones who will tryout. he's pretty bad, isn't he? we decided to stay in eleo's house and just wait for the result. well, they won pero nagkalat daw sila. they're ahead by two points. i said tambakan nila e. jeff said it's hard to do that.    a classmate cried because of..... i really don't know why. and i really don't care. well, who cares? i mean who cared? hey don't judge me that soon. im not that bad, just a bit.    another topic, a source told me that somebody hates me. she said that i did something that she didn't like and her friend also noticed that. well, you know who you are. i want you to confront me. i dare you. talk to me in a way you want and ill talk to you in the same way. i promise! ill give little pointers for you. yeah, i admit i did something wrong. do i really need to think about whether you will be pleased or not before i do anything? before you answer that, answer this first, did you think of us when you did those irritating things,huh? please be true to yourself. you can't blame me for being irritated by your existence like i can't blame for hating me. i once showed you that i could be your true friend. think of what you did. if you want to fix this mess then confront me. oh, i almost forgot! don't cry on me. i hate that!

       i found out that a classmate, specifically the one that everybody hates, is currently irritated with me. that's just fine. i dont really care. i tried to be patient with her for such a long time but now it already ended. sabihan ka ba naman ng bwisit,noh??? yeah i know... i am being sensitive and shallow. i thought we're really friends 'cause we share secrets and i think we're able to keep it well. i think in our classroom i'm the only one who's true to her. i always forgive her. i always tried to ride on with her crazy jokes and hurtful comments. i'm a criticizer too but i can say that she's worse than me. let's just see what i will do. bwisit pala, ha? wait and see what a bwisit can do. don't worry i'll try not to be very very very very very bad,ok? love my actions and embrace them as well! i dont know if we can still fix this up. there's a possibility and that's a secret!! find out for yourself.      don't worry, i still have conscience and merciful heart. ok? ; >
