       You are the love of my life.You are the hope that I cling to.You mean more than this world to me. I wouldn't trade You for silver or gold. I wouldn't trade You for riches untold. You are, You are my everything.  I couldn't take one step without You. I can never go on. I couldn't live one day without You. I don't have the strength to make it on my own.  You are the love of my life. You are the hope that I cling to. You mean more than this world to me.  I wouldn't trade You for silver or gold. I wouldn't trade You for riches untold. You are, You are my everything.  Until the world stops turning, Until the stars fade from the sky, Until the sun stops rising, I need You in my life. And here's the reason why.  You are the love of my life. You are the hope that I cling to. You mean more than this world to me.  I wouldn't trade You for silver or gold. I wouldn't trade You for riches untold. You are, You are my everything.  I couldn't live one day without You Lord. You are, You are my everything. Jesus, You are, You are my everything..

       Hello bloggy. Below is an email from Mr Chin to all of us. =D   Hi all       Thank you very much for the effort put in for this year's Senior Bible Quiz. God is good to us - the 3rd place in West District is a pleasant surprise, and a reward from God for all the hard work. Thanks especially to Jeffrey who stood up to get the team together.       To the team members - Xin Mao, Lek Wei, Jun Rong and Sean, thank you too. Hope you all had fun. And to Jun Rong who initially didn't want to take part, hope you will be the first to sign up next year.       And to Big Madam, captain, Justin and Dennis - thank you for standing in when I was not available for the training sessions. And to Wen Wei, and the rest of the Sec 2 and above Boys, thank you for joining us in the training sessions as well. And to everyone to supported us with your prayers - thank you too.       It has been fun. May this be the start of a collection of Bible Quiz prizes for the 28th from now on.     Who says studying the Bible is boring and unrewarding? Come join the BB cells every Sunday - we will make it fun!  Thanks be to God.       Can Jun Rong's squad leader show him this email - he doesn't have an email account.

        Hello bloggy.   Below is a mail I sent to the bB guys. Tomorrow, Shuqun will be proud of me.    Hello Wenwei and everyone,  I followed through the entire National Day Rally last night. It was an extremely proud moment for Shuqun Secondary when PM Lee mentioned the school.  If I am not wrong, PM Lee quoted Shuqun as one of the schools that is able to to think out of the box and come out with creative ideas. He said some of our students approached Mrs Chua to have a playstation and xbox in school. Their reason was because students go to the nearby arcade to play. And often, this results in comming contact with bad company. So they suggested to have a mini arcade in school instead. Parents volunteered to tend the area.  What an honour to be mentioned by the PM! The school's PSLE aggregate score has grown from 188 to 202 for the express stream.  Btw, I saw in the newspaper that Ms Tan won a presidential award. But it's in chinese, so I had difficulty reading it. =P Mrs Chua will be on channel 8 news tonight too.  To end of, I saw this quote that I like very much in Henderson last Saturday. I encourage everyone to give our best for the school and for God.  "Today, I proud of Shuqun. Tomorrow, Shuqun will be proud of me."  Dennis =D
