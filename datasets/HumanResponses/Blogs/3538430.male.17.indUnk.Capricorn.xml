      I'm very very very very sorry, Justain has been so busy with income taxes and the circus that he really hasn't had much time to answer the mail he receives from his loyal fans!!! This vivid revelation came to me yesterday evening after I was eating a small bowl of postachio ice cream. I was right in the middle of my delicious frozen treat when a bear just rang my door bell, broke down the door and started mauling me. In the midst of this peril I managed to remain calm, cool and collected (Justain is never nervous) so I found the nearest massive oboject to bludgeon the poor beast with...it just so happened to be my overstuffed fan mail bag...   Letter #1   Hey Justain,   I'm just curious is it true that you vaulted over a football goal using only a rock, a match, your keen MaCgyver sense of environment and your boyish good looks?!!! Cuz' i mean i'm currently doing that very vault as i am drafting this letter so please save your bragging for third world countries with low amounts of bragging i'm sure they'll appreciate it.   Well let me safely say that unless you didn't train under the master vaulting prowess of a Mr. Vaultemort then i think you really gotta recognize and do a little more L I T T L E  B I T C H   G R O V E L L I N G because I am 'this (*presses hands as hard together as he possibly can signifying that he is actually going to do this right now!!!!) close to seriously vaulting over you and maybe messing up on purpose but you won't know that because I actually studied acting at Juliard making me so much better than that loser actor Kevin Costner who I know you love (amateur vaulters fucking love The Postman and WaterWorld, those films actually motivate them to be little bitchy amateur vaulters), meaning I would fault my vault and land on your tiny purple gnads exploding blue goop all over your pants...  I think that's enough for today.  Justain GoodBye

      For those of you reading this be warned...you have now entered the world of Justain where not everything is as it seems...Justain controls the maximum...the minimum...the horizontal...and the vertical...be prepared to be awestruck...seemingly perplexed...dumbfounded...flabbergasted...      intrigued and maybe even happy...so it begins my friends...Justain has means of communication...I suggest you buckle your seat belt and brace yourself.

      I have taken a significantly long holiday from blogging to conduct horendous research into the life of one Charles Brisebois, you may also know him as Chucky Chucky Cuatro Corneros; the legendary blogger/photographer. After many hours spent in the respected archives of each corner of the globe....I came across nothing...not a single scrap of information...it's as if he never even existed. I soon realized that this mysterious lacking of factual information truly was the greatest proof that Charles truly is a God among men. How you may ask??? Look at the similarities between Charles and Jesus and you will see what I mean.   Jesus:      Has Wavy Long Brown Hair    Has An Instantly Recognizable Look That Sends Chills Down Mens Spines    Is the Son of God    No Record of his Existence in the Archives of the four corners of the globe     Charles     Has Wavy Long Brown Hair     Has An Instantly Recognizable Look That Sends Chills Down Mens Spines  (That pic o his site with teh Indiana Jones Hat)   Is the Song of another God  (Charles dad is not only like a semi-pro Ninja but he can fucking do wicked gymnastics, if any man over 40 can do that, he's gotta be some type of higher power guy)  NO RECORD OF HIS EXISTENCE IN THE ARCHIVES OF THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE GLOBE!!! (THE DEAD GIVE AWAY!!!!)   Now that I have proven what no one wanted to believe, let me take you into a world of mischief, beatboxing and sing alongs...fasten your seat belts...this is only the beginning!!!!!
