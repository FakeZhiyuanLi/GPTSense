      The Bush Administration used Janet Jackson's Superbowl, um, indiscretion, to detract from the war in Iraq, at least according to Miss Jackson-if-you're-nasty.  A significant part of me feels that I shouldn't even justify this with a response, so I'll make this short. The war in Iraq was nearly a year old by the time Janet exposed her nipple ring to the world. In fact, if you count "Mission Accomplished" as the end of the war, then the war had been over for six months before Janet's breast graced us with its presence.  I don't see how something that Janet and Justin, of their own free-will, chose to do can possibly be construed as a distraction by Bush.  Unless, of course, John Ashcroft used his big-brother-jedi-mind-trick skills to make Justin rip off her clothes. Because we all know Ashcroft spends his downtime honing "the force".

      The general governance structure of Maryland municipalities has always confused me, I will admit. Why bother having local communities if all the normal functions of government--schools, police and fire services, snow removal, planning and zoning, trash collection, street tree maintenance, public libraries, etc.--are performed by the county? (Except, of course, in the three incorporated municipalities.)  I see few options.  (1) Nothing will change. The Columbia Association website seems to indicate that the Columbia Council (aka the association's board of directors) has final authority over the day-to-day operations (read: minutiae) of Columbia. I find no mention, in my quick read, of decisions being subject to veto by executives of RSE. The association appears to be a legally separate entity with only an historical tie to the company.  (2) The decisions formerly made by RSE executives will now be made by middle managers employed by GGP. These may indeed be the same individuals currently resolving critical issues, like authorized colors for house doors.  (3) Columbia will dissolve into the ether. The amenities maintained by the association will be sold off to for-profit entities and other private organizations. Some of the land may be converted from its current entertainment purposes to residential and commercial development.  (4) Columbia will become the state's fourth incorporated municipality and attempt an experiment with democracy. After Iraq has conducted its first peaceful transfer of power from one elected government to another, Columbia will move toward free, open elections (supervised, of course, by POTUS-39).  Yes, yes, the final two options are just wishful thinking. At least option four gives the peanut-farmer-cum-Nobel-laureate something to do, other than planting "peace sticks" in every weed patch in America.

      You weren't actually planning on  watching  the Olympics tonight, were you?  Well now that I've ruined it for you, why don't you come out to the Metrodome to watch the Twins clobber the Indians? We're meeting around 5 at Sgt Preston's at Seven Corners for a few drinks and then taking the short bus to the Dome. If you're lucky, you might even witness Miller getting hit in the head with a t-shirt again (no promises though--that might be a once-in-a-lifetime thing).

      The reporter left out a critical part of the story: Who will own  urlLink Slumbia  now? Who will make the asinine rules such as "you can't fly a flag without getting approval from the village board" and "no street shall intersect another street at a 90 degree angle"? WaPo seems to forget that this isn't just a corporation,  these are people's lives .  (I can already see Mr. Pig's response: "That's an unfortunate consequence of not incorporating your municipalities.")

      I am sure that others in this community will have more to say about the  urlLink sale  of the Rouse Company ( urlLink RSE ). I take issue with one statement:   In addition to Columbia and Harborplace, the company built...the first indoor shopping mall....    I think not!    urlLink Southdale  was the first indoor shopping center, thank you very much. (Or as they put it, the first "fully-enclosed, climate-controlled" mall. These things are critically important in the Frost Belt. I would argue that only in the Upper Midwest could the idea emerge, as a necessary invention.) The original "dale" opened in 1956. Harundale (what kind of name is  that ?) opened in 1958. Perhaps it can lay claim to being the first indoor shopping mall on the Eastern Seaboard, but not even RSE's  urlLink website  makes that claim. The center is merely listed as the company's first venture into the indoor shopping center category of development.  Middle America is not uncivilized. It invented the shopping mall. About seven miles away is the nation's largest enclosed shopping center. Fly over this, Fred Barbash!

      A few of us were discussing this the other day: while I am usually stoked about watching the Olympics, this time around I am feeling a little less-than-excited.  During the SLC games in 2002, you couldn't pry me away from the TV (well, except to go to class, which was more something I  had  to do than something I wanted to do). They were on all over campus. Even at the bar on Friday nights.  I feel like there's no real point in watching them this time around. Mostly because NBC keeps updating their page as the events actually happen. So we'll be sitting around the office and someone will yell out "Michael Phelps won the gold" and it sort of defeats the purpose of watching it at night. It's worse than watching a taped episode of the West Wing after someone tells you the big twist.  Also, it is really obnoxious to run coverage until midnight. I watched the men's gymnastics competition last night and went to bed at 10PM, right after Hamm flipped off the vault. I woke up this morning and the STrib on my doorstep said something like "Hamm wins Gold". I thought it was a "Dewey wins Election" moment, but no, apparently all the drama happens after 10PM, CDT. (I know this contradicts my earlier assertion that I already know who wins but I was out of the the office yesterday afternoon so I missed the play-by-plays from my coworkers.)  And yet the IOC wants to expand the scope of the games. More sports means more needed coverage means I might as well take a two-week vacation in February, 2006 to stay up on it.

      Prior to this year, I had never been to a campaign rally. Well, except that one with CR, but that doesn't really count because it was for Bob Taft. I'd been to fundraisers and inaugural balls and campaign offices but "campaign rally attendee" was missing from my CV. Having been to three in the past two months (not counting the numerous conventions, which may as well just be an omnibus rally for local and national republicans), I can honestly say I never missed anything. Granted, there are exciting moments at a rally, but generally speaking they are a pain in the ass (I will grant an exception to the Cheney rally, as circumstances were different). Usually they are held on a weekday, which means attendees must take time off work to go (you'd think this would instantly boost the caliber of people showing up--it doesn't). You get downtown and discover that parking is $25 and it is all taken by the people who showed up at 9AM for a 5:45PM speech (keep in mind that this is the middle of the business day so a lot of the parking ramps are "contract parking only"). Then, no matter how VIP your ticket is, you must wait in a line of a million people, enduring the retarded taunting of John Kerry supporters for at least an hour (hey guys--"Four more wars" is not the most intelligent protest chant--this Republican is perfectly fine with as many more wars as it takes. Even if you're chanting "For more wars", it still doesn't make sense. I know there are intelligent Kerry supporters out there, I just have yet to see one on the street corner). Once inside and through the screening process you'd expect in order to see the president, you find a place in the masses and stand there...and stand there...and stand there...for at least two hours. Yes, you could talk to your fellow attendees but these are the same people who show up to every event the party has--I believe we call them "hacks". And just because you know said hacks (in fact, you find yourself asking "could I be one of them?") doesn't mean you like them. There are some (many, in fact) you downright loathe. Eventually, some local-celebrity MC comes on and tries to evoke laughter with her best John Kerry joke. One-by-one she introduces the opening acts, including every single Republican congressman the state has; the Republican senator; the Democrat-but-supporting-Bush mayor of the second-largest city in the state; a few veterans; a few FoxNews personalities; the disadvantaged-teenager choir; the boy scouts; some ROTC cadets; Miss Otter Tail County and the chairman of the Dairy Farmers for Bush, Holstein Division steering committee. They all make their individual speeches, including their best John Kerry jokes and an attempt to start a crowd chant of "Four more years". They all talk about their relationship with God and how we should love--I mean really love--the troops and how George Bush "will never ask permission to defend this country". If you attend multiple rallies, you'll notice the same speeches given over and over again. Then, after you've been standing there for just short of an eternity, the lights go down and the video montage of the President and Company on the campaign trail begins. If you are especially crabby, you start to see striking similarities between this video and the final episode of "The Simple Life 2". This is usually set to music, although I must say all the good options have been eliminated in light of the recent indiscretions of such greats as Bruce Springsteen and John Mellencamp (and since unfortunately "Hey Ya" has pretty much been adopted as the unofficial Democratic campaign song, we can't really use that either). Finally, as you're looking down to see if your feet are still there, the President comes out. The crowd suddenly rushes forward, pushing and shoving as if he is going to activate his "Go go gadget arms" and shake the hands of people standing 25 people deep in the crowd. He makes his speech. A good speech, although no one in the arena really expects him to be a bumbling idiot (those people are all standing outside, across the street from the building, still yelling). Inevitably the people standing towards the front, but not in the front, have picked up their small children and put them on their shoulders, essentially blocking the view of anyone else on the floor. The speech ends and the crowd rushes forward again, apparently not discouraged by the lack of gadget arms the first time. This is countered by the people who have turned around and are pushing their way to the exit, in an attempt to wave good-bye to the motorcade as it leaves the arena. No one goes anywhere. Mass hysteria ensues. When the President is safely ten miles out of the city and even the obliviots have given up on touching his hand, the secret service opens the doors and the stampede begins. You walk the mile-and-a-half back to the parking garage, feet completely numb, head pounding and while waiting in line to get out of the parking garage, call all your friends: "I just met the President. Today was the best day of my life."

      While I'm generally opposed to exclamation points and short posts, both tendencies had to be broken for this little tidbit.  Currently on the CNN.com, there is a political story entitled "All Eyes on Ohio." The link to this pulitzer of a piece reads "Ohio Emerges as Key Battleground."  Gee, CNN, you don't say.  Besides the fact that a court could take judicial notice of the fact that a republican has never won "The" big white house without winning Ohio, OR that it is well-documented that the state is ideologically split north and south of I-270, OR that Ohio has suffered unbelievable job-loss since Election 2000, it seems as though the network that Ted built has not been paying attention to the innumerable other sources that have already saturated the "newswaves" with the exact same story since circa 2003.  Sad, really.  Message to the Cable News Network: You're a better outlet than Fox. Act like it.  Cheers.

      The last time I objectively reviewed a theater production, I caused quit a stir on the editorial board of  urlLink  The Denisonian   .  (Unfortunately, the archives do not go back far enough for you to actually read the scathing review, so you're going to have to trust me that it was quite controversial for a small college weekly.) It's been awhile since I've caused much of a stir about anything. In an effort to remedy that:   A few informal, unofficial thoughts on last night's performance of  Thoroughly Modern Millie  (as seen at the Ordway Theater, St Paul, MN)       I hate body mics on ensemble players. There's no reason why 16 "professional" performers cannot project loudly enough to fill a moderately-sized venue such as the Ordway. Epecially considering that the Ordway is pretty much brand-new and thus was built with acoustics in mind. Body mics always produce this somewhat-muffled, yet loud sound that, while I can explain it, is like nails on a chalk board. Additionally, in a "high-energy" (read: lots of dancing) production like Millie, the body mics have a tendancy to pick up a huffing and puffing that drives certain audience members insane. And there's the volume issue, as they never adjust in time to prevent your ears being blasted out when a singer decides to crescendo rapidly--but I can deal with ringing ears.  I am sick and tired of big-name, tony-award winning musicals casting a non-dancer in a lead role. As I've already said, there's a lot of dancing in this production. As it is set in the Twenties, it is a lot of stylized dancing that needs to be technically perfect to get the desired effect. Someone who took a crash course in tap the week before her audition is not going to be able to fake it. This person, regardless of how powerful her pipes are, should not be cast as the lead. Additionally, what ever happened to ballet technique being at the root of all dance. I sat there last night and identified less than a handful of dancers who have really studied classical technique. These were the dancers who had grace and placement and were generally aware of the kinetics of their body. Everyone else looked like they were members of the Dance Company at Wilde Lake. (That's not fair, there were some gifted dancers who were members of the WLDC, they were just few, far between, and supplemented by a whole bunch of girls whose dance experience was limited to shaking it like a polaroid picture at a certain winter semi-formal called, I kid you not, "Da Snow Bomb".) There are plenty of hard-working triple threats out there--find them! This may mean doing away with those inane rules about only hiring within the union.   One more gripe and then I will find something pleasant to discuss: perhaps it has always been this way, but more and more I've noticed the actresses cast in productions tend to be a little on the flabby side. This sort of goes back to the dancer thing, but you'd think if your job was to appear in a flapper dress on stage every night you would at least try to hit the gym to tone up your arms and shoulders. The women weren't fat, per se, but a few push-ups or maybe some dance training would have worked wonders for them.  Okay, I lied, this is somewhat neutral though: does anyone else notice that the recent trend is a much longer (like 35 percent longer) first act, followed by a speedy second act? The break doesn't have to be after the first act (I think R&amp;J breaks after the second). The past several productions I've been to have followed this trend. Is it the director's liberties, the writer's intent (although I've recently seen things penned centuries ago), or is it just Minnesota?  I liked the costuming. And the staging was actually very good. It was well-written too. Overall, it is recommended. I am just very nit-picky and expect East Coast-level performances in the midwest. That really shouldn't be too much to ask.   This has nothing to do with the show, but I highly recommend Kincaid's for anyone looking for an excellent dining experience in downtown Saint Paul. I might even like it more than Pazzaluna, but that's a tough call. (Although, nothing will replace Perkins as my favorite restaurant.)

      There is much discussion these days of the myriad 527s that have amassed on the other side of the aisle and of their formidable strength. Some news analysts even claim that, but for the 527s, KE04 would already be relegated to the ashcan of history. Others are seeing in the 527s the revitalization of the Democratic Party.  I agree, to an extent. If not for the 527s, or the narrow interests they represent, Democrats would undoubtedly be disheartened and unorganized. (Or at least, more disorganized than they are. I don't know if a party can really be organized when its nominal leader isn't clear on...well, anything.)  I disagree, though, on whether the 527s are good for the long-term health of the Democratic Party. Because of their tax status, these groups cannot coordinate with the Democratic National Committee, Democratic campaign committees (like the DCCC) or Democratic candidates. Instead, many, like America Coming Together, must focus on defeating Republicans (specifically BC04) and electing Democrats as the only alternative:   It will take all of us – millions of concerned Americans – to put an end to the Republican extremism. To stop the Bush-Cheney-Delay agenda before it wreaks even more damage, we must work to defeat them and their ultra-conservative allies.  ACT  urlLink website , accessed as this post was written.  (Interestingly, they carelessly misspell the House Majority Leader's name. It is DeLay, not Delay. The politics of delay, as it were, can be found in the actions of Senators Daschle, Levin, Clinton, et al. who seek to put off votes on qualified candidates for the federal bench.)  Others are more issue-oriented. MoveOn.org started on two fronts: (1) to censure POTUS-42 and move on to "pressing issues" (though WJC himself would not have ranked the fight against al-Qaeda as pressing) and (2) to call for a multi-lateral approach to the war on terror. (As I have said elsewhere, I am unclear on our supposed current unilaterality. Are Britain, Australia, Japan, Italy, Spain, Poland, Denmark, Hungary, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Romania, the Netherlands, Norway, El Salvador and  urlLink others  chopped liver?)  Of course, the candidate MoveOn supports echoes their call for a multilateralist approach, but will not pull the nation out of Iraq, even though many of MoveOn's supporters would likely prefer that cut-and-run strategy.  In the end, these narrowly focused groups, required to work outside the party appartus, will deny the party any ability to grow. It will also disenchant active members of these groups from continued involvement in the party. If JFK(2) fails to withdraw from Iraq and Afghanistan, or fails to create new jobs (liberals don't really understand free market job creation, only manufactured incentives that end up costing more), where are these supporters going to turn? The DNC isn't going to deny an incumbent president the endorsement and risk a bloody internal fight while Republicans watch on the sidelines (happily munching away on burgers with  urlLink W ketchup  and drinking  urlLink Coors  beer). The Green Party is unlikely to be able to get on the ballot in most states in 2008. There will be no bogeyman to defeat, to rail against.   Thankfully, the Republican party got organized before McCain-Feingold and its activists have remained commitment to advancing conservative causes through the party. After Bush 43 retires to Crawford (hopefully in '08), Republicans will seek a new leader. Conservative principles will still be championed by think tanks and special interest groups, but conservatives will retain their primary loyalty to the party that represents those interests best. (We accept that compromise is often part of politics.) We learned, through three bitter years, that strength is not be found in fixating on the opposition. Only a return to clearly enunciated, and deeply held, primary values builds a party's strength. Boston and KE04 reveal a house built on sandy soil.

      Here you have it, the first "official" post of Hyde Park Corner West. I want to jump right into the news, but I feel as though I should probably offer a little background on this project first:  We all have opinions. It's one of the distinguishing characteristics of  homo sapiens . I don't think Apes have opinions, apart from "I like bananas" and "I want to mate." Maybe I am wrong. After all, I was a Political Science major; we didn't discuss apes too much (note to self: look into recruiting a vet--or at least a bio major--to serve as my point person on animals).  It also seems that lately, we all have blogs too. I am a big fan of blogs. I don't see them taking over traditional news sources, as some predict, but I think they are moderately important to both press and politicos. My biggest problem with blogs, however, is there's generally no liability. Yes, there is sometimes a "comments" section, but they are generally written by one person, presenting one side of an issue (hmm, this sounds a lot like the  urlLink Star Tribune , actually). I am perfectly capable of presenting only my side of the issue (the right side, of course), but where's the fun in that?  So I decided I was going to start a blog with various people of various backgrounds with various opinions, hoping that sometimes we can back each other up and sometimes we can shoot each other down (all in good fun, of course).  Last week I invited ten of the sharpest people I know to participate in friendly commentary and debate about current events, politics, philosophy, pop culture, etc. Thus far, five have responded (and one was forced). You'll meet them soon. This number may grow over the next few weeks--we're going to play it by ear.  A profile page is forthcoming, just give me some time to get all the administrative stuff taken care of (and I need to actually do my job in the meantime as well). We will also set up a way for the reader to comment, either through e-mail or perhaps through a "comments" page. In the meantime, enjoy some unabridged, uncensored brilliance--and check out my favorite sites along the sidebar.  And finally, just a little absurdity to jump-start everyone's Monday (courtesy of FoxNews): You know your  urlLink proposal  is crazy when even Bob Jones University opposes it. My favorite part is that these people don't want to be a part of the US but still want to rely on its infrastructure. Make up your mind--is the US good or evil? You can't have it both ways. (I realize this is a softball--I don't want to make enemies on the first day.)
