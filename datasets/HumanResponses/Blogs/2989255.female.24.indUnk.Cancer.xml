      today i talked to mon. and i mean, i actually really spoke to her. i listened actively, i felt her words, and meant every ounce of mine. it was good. we have known eachother for 12 years, and she is a heroin addict. in recovery. she dies and ressurrects herself to me over and over again. i almost don't know her at all, even though i know her best of all. it's weird to hear someone's perception of your relationship with them. it makes me feel lonely to hear what she thinks our friendship is. cos she assumes i feel the same way. and i don't. i'm a stranger, to everyone, everything, to my own self. it's a secret i keep. but it's eating away at me.   i had to tell her today that i think the man she is shacking up with is a simple creature. i watch her dumb herself down to be safe within a domestic prairie. i watch the minutes of her life get sucked down like a fast food soft drink. i think i made her want to die... i should let her be, at least she isn't on the streets, or whoring, or dying. she is doing well. i just wish that my bestest friend in the world wasn't dedicated to doing her best impression of a 40 year old blue collar, domesticated, suburbanite. really, that man is so low brow, so dull, such a fucking twit. she never goes out dancing, or to the museum, or to see music. she doen't read or write or challenge herself in any way. she has "her" shows on tv, that she will actually schedule her evenings around. i want to bust her out of it, like do a jail break, but how do you rescue someone from a self-imposed lock-down?

      billie holiday is the most perfect morning music. hearing her at 6:23am makes it all feel like it's perfectly sad, and beautiful. i feel really human and really womanly. i have been sweet to my lover this weekend. really genuine and kind. no bullshit, no wishing or waiting or lying, and i feel happy. i have these strange moments, when i feel like i could be content and thrilled, actually, to see him everyday, and raise a puppy. my dav. he's too gorgeous and grossly flawed. it's just right, though. for now. i'm a cyclical honey, though, so i gotta let it ride, and make sure i'm not pretending, or phasing, or passing through. i just want to feel settled and sentimental.

      why o why do i troll lezzy personals? i like girls. i went to a strip bar three weeks ago. one of the strippers played me like a fiddle. i mean, i was total puddy in her hands. she crawled up to me and i could smell her hair. it was sweet and smokey. her skin was really broken out up close. i didn't at all care...  i felt guilty and guyish and charged.   i don't know what to do next.  i know that i am really late on the joy division bandwagon, but i'm so glad to finally be on it. i can't imagine how i lived more than twenty three years without those sweet hell pit songs. they make me think of machines and sweaty clubs and drugs and blood and intimate kisses between utter strangers.

      i'm sitting at work. i'm the odd queenie out. i'm not talking to anyone, except for this pne craaaazy kid who is wiping his face down, like slathering on ten gallons of stridex. he is my favorite though, a quirky smartass with vulnerability. oo, i just got caught blogging on the job.

      well today i don't even know why i write or think. fried eggs and wet cement today. it all went awry when eL brought home "school of rock" DREAD. i don't know. i needed to decorate the house today. actually, i really passionately desired two things equally: to watch pornography and to shop for martha stewart home collection houseware at the "big" K-mart sale. dust turns to glittery ash in all corners of my rectangle mind. it feels so stuffy inside my head. a sauna ruminating with thoughts of sex, food, sleep, apocolypse, magic, tarot, and gambling.  i don't feel like doing anything much. i never really have, if i'm totally honest with myself. i wish there would be a new blog posting on magnetic kid liv soon. i feel a budding obsession. i am scummy with fascination and lust for soul mate exchanges of whispers and love love love.

      when i drive with dav- i can't explain it- it feels like i'm sailing. the road feels so smoothe, like marble, and my hands are free to roam about. i like to mess with the radio or hold his hand, or pick at my face. the picking has been a real problem lately. i should just clear up now that i am not a drug addict, i just can't seem to leave myself alone, though. i like to pick dav's skin too. he has these marvelous little bumps on his arms. i say to him, "can i piiick?" and he groans into submission. i think he likes it. we feel like eachothers little monkeys.   his lips are too soft. after six years of kissing, they are like the birkenstock sandals that shape to your feet. i wish they didn't fit so perfectly. it's confusing, cos i'm supposedly his ex-girlfreind, but i can't stop kissing him like a fiend... everything i learned about love was from 80's movies. this makes life very grim. it paints me alternating shades of fire red and then granite grey.   and then my mind wanders to her. that moment goes crackly and i find myself staring at my hands, or talking just to hear my own voice, and trying to make all the parts of me fit in a way that is rational. but the pieces all fight. they are like tequila and rasberry sherbet and barbequed chips all contrary and ultimately sickening... i wish dav was really my friend so i could cry it out to him, but i know his eyes will fall, he'll go so far away if he knows. he is simple. and i don't mean that in a shitty way, i mean he makes sense. he's not a warbled Dr. Katz animation, he is solid lines and pure colors. i envy him and i want to smash him up sometimes. then i wimper away from such sadistic and shameful sentiments. back to my high  high cave above communication. out of touch. really cold.

      Dear Midge, i'm reeling. fifty million things to do at once. best friend since 8th grade: married. married! married in LAKE TAHOE to a THIRTY-SIX year old man. ugh. and more ugh. there she stood in a black wedding dress, her sailor tatooes of hearts with names on banners draped across covered by a shawl. she wore a plastic and rhinestone tiara, a dress from new things west and a girdle under it all. she is twenty-four years old. twenty-four. over two-hundred pounds, with a little mushroom cap haircut and two sad old eyes. they played a goddamn country song mid-ceremony, her brother, dav and me all exchanging telepathic gag gestures as she and mel exchanged fluffy vows, swaying to the twangy cliches of randy fucking travis. she used to be a rocker. oh who am i kidding, she never listened to anything good unless i introduced her to it. i defy anyone to prove me wrong about that. those vows were pastel, cheap pink ribbon, fake teddy bear lashes. the minister, i swear to his god, was like a bad soap actor; quivering voice, eyes gripped in false concern, pretending to know and love every herd that came through the chapel's revolving door. i think he is a criminal. or a recovering alcoholic. or a fetishist.  i have been so unable to write or speak, or communicate in any substantial way for the past few weeks. i have a solid start on a letter, though, but i'm afraid the overall package i had in mind for you may take a little longer to put together.  how have you been? what are you up to? while driving to crappyass lake tahoe, (ok, ok i get it, lake tahoens, it's a goddamn lake, let's all freak out about it.) i saw a freeway sign that went to L.A. and was like, for a good long minute, really tempted to escape to l.a. ...like kurt russel. eew. that was so uncalled for. i'm totally giggling. maybe it was escape from l.a. oh, fuck it.  i wish we could have met like in a class, or puking in a bathroom stall, at least you'd be local. we could ride bikes drunk, look for sea shells, talk shit about people we both know... it would ROCK. P.S. can you believe that in my last scrabble match, the highest scoring word was 'junk'?! 45 points in the triple word spot. fucking JUNK!  anyway, all of my warmest fuzzies, vanesa

      school is refreshing... and i hate it too. but i'm reading some beatiful poetry, and good writing gets me ignited. it makes me want to live so that i can read it over and over again and feel that warm wash that it gives me, that glowing crystal, that fresh bathrobe, and bright sunshine on kitchen table feeling that i get from good writing. it's the only thing that will save me at this point. it is my last bit of religious faith. why am i writing this blog?? really, wht in the hell is the point? i'm impatient while i write, i generalize and skip points, no one reads it... i think i will stop.

        so. i'm learning&nbsp;a new language. gay, gay, lesbian, more gay. i'm so excited, my skin has become impermanent.     &nbsp;   six o'clock is the worst time. that and 10am. i'm never quite sure where to take her or what to do. besides kiss and touch. it's all i ache for in the world. she's still a stranger, i know, and so am i. how has anyone ever gotten close? it's so hard. i keep thinking about that dream i had before the first time she came out to see me, the dream where we were having sex under my covers while my aunt pounded on my bedroom window. i'm hoping it wasn't a prophecy. gay prophecies. i need a set of queer parables to guide me through- a lezzy bible.     &nbsp;

      when i think of her skin i get chilly. sweetest, slowest, most urgent kissing. like we would die from freezing if we didn't lock lips. i don't know what to do next at all. i am not smart like she thinks i am. i'm a fraud. FRAUD! my vocabulary is in the shitter, and i have no schnazzy references. my routine will unravel.   what do i really want? dav is still around. around in my head and in my heart, and i felt as if i were being unfaithful while i was sliding my hands all over her lovely body. what am i? when did i wake up this person? i'm only noticing now how many situations i have lured myself into, only to wonder how i ever got "there" in the first place.
