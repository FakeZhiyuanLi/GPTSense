      In a state of too many thoughts broiling through my brain.. chatted nonstop to my aunt and a good friend while waiting for the flight.. Reflecting on the kind of person I am.... What direction I want to go... am I nuts?... Chatting nonstop about the week... Missing my Hubby Missing my Kitties.. Flew home with a High School basketball crew... Interesting..  Got home, shoes off, bags dropped.. Wine poured.. (rubiat-Cakebread cellers yum) Couch, cats, laptop... I'm home.. Ahh

         What a day!       &nbsp;   Our day started off with  importing our videos.. an exercise in mechanical frustration.. Trying to get the video downloaded and distributed took up a chunk of our time.&nbsp; Not only finding the 'right' firewire, but, getting the 'correct' spot on the video camera.. so working with unfamiliar hardware.. arghhhhhhh... We sort of kept going back discussing it during the day to figure out how best to manage splicing together the video, so it's something that is still bothering the team. We're not frustrated with each othibut rather.. but how to best approach the project & overcoming technical difficulties and a sense of losing time.     &nbsp;  The Lego project-   This one definately fit the serious fun, but also 'challanging'.&nbsp; We all talked about how to 'create' a good rover. Charleen had a great idea to go out to the hallway for a quieter space.. So we spread out on the comfy chairs and tried out different ideas & pieces on how to best make a the solar panel cleaner. Everyone had suggestions and we were all picking up pieces and trying out different ideas.&nbsp; Everyone 'saw' where the other was going.. and modified or contributed to 'well.. how can we make this work.. will it work?&nbsp; Some questions definately need to be answered like.. Just what is the range.. etc.. on the sensor.. so not having all the information in terms of what the 'material could do' was sort of frustrating in the 'planning' dept.&nbsp; Tommorrow will be a lot of trial and error and we're expecting that.     &nbsp;  Dreamweaver-   Blogger-    &nbsp;

      ARP's.. changes... etc.......  Well.. informal chatting with coworkers.-they seem to like my digit photography/Website building ideas..  I do have a pretty good tech savvy staff I work with.  I swear everyone is ending up with the statement, hey, take a survey tho! Baldridge in Education seems to be establishing roots. (lol) With that thought in mind, for one of my 'adjunct' duties, I signed up to be one of the data/survey coordinators.. which is taking parent, student & teachers surveys 2-3 times a year and collaborting the data.. It seemed to be a good match for this year.   COOL thing today was asking my 21 first graders-"Who has a computer" instead of the 4 to 6 I usually see, about 3/4ths of the students raised their hands.. (YES!) and since I only have 2 out of 4 computers set up so far, two of my youngsters wandered over to the one computer I had turned on and was creating some paperwork for the class... and started clicking away to see what was there...  (good thing I saved) There was no hesitation whatsoever in their movements either.. WAY too comfy..  I knew one of them was tech savvy when I went.. "ACK, I was working on a paper." He got that look of 'GULP' his eyes went wide and he told me, "I'm so sorry teacher."  yep.. he's worked on a computer before.. I told him I saved, so should be okay.. but.. LET me log you onto the student account..   Hmm.. I definately think my 6 & 7 year old students will be changing the world... afterall.. born.. around 97... The Tech BOOM babies...  One of the parents was asking another teacher about computer use.. (that other teacher has FOUR computers in her room.. you only have one.... and who is the computer for, you or the students?)  Signals of good things...  That kinder/first grade combo class looks like it may be a real possibility, very.. very soon.. spent about an hour talking about logistics and possibibilties today.. look, another gray hair..

      Now that I have the hobbit's attention...  I think I've spent more time away from home than not this summer.  Flew down to Laguna beach to see the Pagent of the Masters for the first time this weekend.. and I've been working 10 hour days setting up the classroom..  Today, was the first day of school.  A good friend was my sub today. I had a very pleasent shock, walking into a quiet classroom.. (hey, I still showed up at lunch after all, no pay, but ya gotta be there.. )  I do have one autistic/ADD student from Mexico who speaks no English... I have a smattering of Spanish.. After having a full blown panic attack last Thursday, My very kind, patient and listener of a principal set up aide time to help out in the classroom. My major concern is simply if something upsetting happening.. I don't have the language to help the student out! He does like visuals tho, tv, computer, photo's.. (hmm... something in common I see... that could be usful)  When I walked in, they seemed to be doing a pretty good job.   wheee.. I'm inviting my friend every year I think to go over rules & regs I think-she did such a fantastic job.   After the training Wednesday and realizing that I am such a visual learner.. I was thinking of having new fellow up front take the occasional digital picture with the inexpensive camera the teachers got at the Science Institute early in July. (little point and shoot)  Hopefully, if he has a picture with some 'ownership' to it.. hopefully, that will encourage him to write about it.  And so that things are fair, perhaps 'sharing' the camera with classmates.. to spur their writing. (I do have a goodly number of eld students-so if I can push the visual learning/language develop/ownership/fun factor..... may be interesting....  and after all this thought.. I may even end up with a kinder/first grade combo in a week or two....  That curse of 'may your life be interesting...' till holds true today..  and since it's is soo bedtime right now... gnight all and happy blogging..
