       Today is very special. This is the first time to share with all of you from Hong Kong. I heard the term "weblog" from Bill Gate.   The concept of risk plays a central role in the investment process. Yet risk is an elusive concept-difficult to define, quantify and integrate.  Let's consider two senses of the term risk. The first is what is mainstream in finance circles: you can measure risk by seeing how much a stock bounces around versus "the market". You can quantify this measure of risk through variance. The higher the variance-the larger the swings in relative price- the riskier the stock.  The second sense is the  "margin of safety" , or  a discount to expected value . The idea here is that for every stock there is an intrinsic value, and that the deeper the discount the stock price is to intrinsic value, the lower the risk.  We quoted this report by noting Warren Buffett's attack on the first risk definition.(We suggest that he believes in, and acts according to, the second definition.) Unfortunately, Buffett attacks an idea that does not follow from finance theory. Without defending the traditional theory, we note that Buffett's comments better reflect the second risk definition.  The conclusion from the report are as follows: 1. Volatility remains a reasonable measure of risk for the short-term. Long-term investors are better off considering the concept of margin of safety. There is evidence that sugguests that volatility understates risk for up to four years, but overstates risk for holding periods four years.  2. Margin of safety can be restated as a discount to expected value. Expected value is a function of the weighted probability of potential outcomes. Judgements on both outcomes and probabilities are tricky, but essential to the investment process.  3. Investors should base the magnitude of their investments on the size of margin of safety. For companies with variable outcomes, the consensus can be the most likely outcome and the stock may still be attractive or unattractive. Companies with narrow outcomes require a non-consensus point of view for a but or sell.  Hereunder is an extracted words from Warren Buffett. "Finance departments teach that volatility equals risk. Now they want to measure risk. And they don't know any other way-they don't know how to do it, basically. So they say that volatility measures risk. I've often used the example of the Washington Post stock when we first bought it: In 1973, it had gone down almost 50%-from a valuation of the whole company of close to say $180 or $175 million down to maybe &80 million or $90 million. And because it happened very fast, the beta of the stock had actually increased. A professor would have told you that the stock of the company was more risky if you bought it for $80 million than if you bought it for $170 million-which is something that I've thought about ever since they told me that 25 years ago. And I still haven't figured it out."  Often, when Buffett needs a lead-in to slam finance theory, he tells the above-quoted story as prima facie evidence of his case. In early 1970s, Washington Post stock got walloped, the beta went up (suggesting the stock was more risky) while any rightminded investor should see that the stock was actually less risky (because the price dropped more than the value).  Buffett's argument has two problems. The first is that the beta didn't go up: we have the empirical data to back that one. The seconf is that in saying the stock is less ricky. Buffett assumed that the price to value gap had widened- the stock's "margin of safety" grew. But value could be logically distinct from price only if Buffett believed something different than what the market believed. Buffett's judgment proved to be correct, but that is not necessarily a statement about the shortcomings of finance theory.  The classic definition of risk is the possibility of suffering harm or loss. So an asset that has a wide distribution of potential returns presents a greater probability of "suffering harm" (or sizable gains) than an asset with a narrow distribution of probabilities. We note that "volatility, or variance, has an intuitive appeal as a proxy for risk." He adds, "If you were asked to rank the riskiness of shares of the Brazil Fund, shares of General Electric, a U.S. Treasury bond due in thirty years, and a U.S. treasury bill due in ninety days, the ranking would be obvious. So would the relative volatility of the securities."  The critical catch is volatility's temporal dimension. More directly, there is some evidence that variance understates risk over the first four years of a holding period, but overstates risk over four years or more. This evidence implies that long-term holders assumes less risk than short-term holders. We might even make the statement that the long term investor welcomes volatility if it helps present investment opportunities.  We likes to think on at least two levels. Over the short term, volatility is a pretty reasonable measure of risk. Indeed, volatility plays an overwhelming important role in the design and valuation of derivative-most notably options.  But for investors with long-term horizon, we think the best way to maximize the risk/reward tradeoff is to buy stocks that offer a margin of safety. We think this is what Buffett refers to when he thinks about risk. A margin of safety- a concept attributable to Ben Graham-exists when an investor can purchase a stock well below its intrinsic value. Bufferr defines intrinsic value in no uncertain terms.: "It is the discounted value of the cash that can be taken out of business during its remaining life."  We believe the best and most practical way to restate the margin of safety concept is to think about discounts to expected value. The combination of probabilities and potential outcomes determine expected value. Says Buffett, "Take the probability of loss times the amount of possible loss from the probability of gain times the amount of possible gain. That is what we're tryint to do. It's imperfect, but that's what it's all about.  Take the simple example of a coin toss that pays $3 for heads and $1 for tails. What's the expected value? You calculate it as (50%x$3)+(50%x$1)=$2. Now for investing, both the probabilities and the potential outcomes are much more difficult to estimate, but the idea is the same. Let's take a closer look at both probability abd potential outcomes.  We can specify two types of probabilities: objective (or frequency) and subjective. Objective, or frequency, probabilities arise when there are specified outcomes. Coin tosses are a good example. In these cases, the probabilities is based on the law of averages as it assumes that the event is repeated countless times. While we still can't make definitive statements about any specific outcome, the frequency of outcomes will reflect the probability of each outcome over time.  The circumstances are totally different for events that only happen once-a valid assumption for stock investing. Here, we must reply on subjective probabilities. Subjective probabilities describe an investor's "degree of belief" about an outcome. These probabilities are rarely static and generally change as evidence comes along. Bayes's Theorem is a means to contunually update conditional probabilities based on new information. Bayesian analysis is a valuable means to weigh multiple possible outcomes when only one outcome will occur.
