      Woke up at 9:30am today.  Read for a bit and then showered, put on the new faded pair of blue jeans I bought the other day.  Drove to work.  Traffic was heavy and it took a long time to get to work today, at least an hour and a half.  Got here just in time for a Bug Triage meeting.  Then we had an engineering meeting.  Finally got in my book claim in for a few books I bought a couple of weeks ago.  We still aren't sure exactly what needs to be done in what order, but we do have a good picture of what our platform needs to look like in a years time.  So now we just have to have a few meetings to hammer out the details.

      Missed putting out my garbage this morning.  I forgot it was middle of the week already.  I stopped by the store on the way home last night and got a lot of stuff.  For me to eat, and for my party on the 12th of June.  Not very far away at all now.  I finally got a couple pairs of bargan jeans, was down to just 2 pairs, now I have 4 again.  I have gotten about $1000 together for buying the new deck materials, but I do not think that is going to be enough.  Might only be enough to frame it up.  Oh well, that is better than nothing.  Working on selling my van, if I can sell it than I will have enough to finish the deck and get a new case to get one of my broken computers running again.  After I got home I chatted, watched a few movies, and worked on a program to break apart URL's.  I watched Something about mary, office space and fight club.  Fight club was a strange movie... if he was the other guy too, who was he fighting when he started up fight club?  This morning I woke up late again.

      Got up late again.  Showered, dressed, sipped a cup of tea while I posted a pro Linux article on a linux web site.

      I woke up late.  For some reason I really couldn't get a start on the day.  When I finally got up and got out, I almost fell asleep twice on the drive in to work.  That could be bad.  I think I am going to take a nap before I drive home tonight.  I am dissappointed because I had wanted to mow my lawn this morning before work.  Oh well, maybe I can get motivated tomorrow morning.  Tonight I'll do my dishes and wash my pants so I have some to wear for tomorrow.  I got to work and fixed a few bugs in our product, then did a release build.  Not much else happened at work today, talked to a few people about code stuff. Oh, and some one brought in these little round sour chews. Yummy.

      Well, I just found this link to blogger.com from google.  A friend had been asking if I had a blog and so when I saw the link I decided to try this out.  We will see how good I am about keeping up with this.

      I was on vacation with no access to the internet.   I left seattle on Friday, Jun 18th and got back Sunday, Jun 27th.  Saturday, June 19th was the family reunion.  Saw nearly everyone, but my little brother didn't make it.  My brother has 2 horses now with dreams to raise horses.  Mom and my step dad are both retired now and are doing well.   I hung out around the home town for a few days, spent a lot of time with mom.  Wednesday I went upto newark to stay with my friend.  We went over to his brothers house on Thursday and we played like 8 hours of D&D.  Then we tried to sleep there, 4 kids, 3 grownups in a small apartment.  I could have slept fine, but one of the kids has a Jimmy leg and didn't stop moving on the air matress all night, then at 3am I got too cold and just stopped pretending to sleep and got up.  Friday we made it to origins and then spent the day walking around.  That night we went back to my friends house and killed a red dragon.   My 5th level thief actually hit 2 out of 3 times and did 14 points of damage. :D  Saturday my feet hurt, so I bought my "Yes, it is rocket science" T-shirt, got a free t-shirt with spider man on it and bought a game called Truth or Fib.  I went over to the free board game area and got a game called "I'm the Boss"  About investment banking.  Fun game.  Then we went home and stopped by another friends house and had hambergers and hotdogs before finally going to sleep early.   Got up Sunday and I showered, got my clothes into the laundry and then we headed over to get TIVO for my friend.    We mostly got it setup and then I headed out to the air port.  Got my plane and the connecting flight good, and got a ride from the air port home with another friend.   I always sleep so well on the aircraft.

      Went and got a lot of new boards for the top of my deck.  Unloaded them.  I found out my neighbor didn't want to buy the van,  oh well, have to sell it to someone when I get back from vacation.   Sunday   I didn't do much today.  I read a book on open source.  I went and saw the movie, "Van Helsing"  It was ok, lots of good action and exploding green goo. Didn't scare me though.  And the 'Q' like friar with all his inventions was so stollen from XXX and James Bond.

      I woke up at 11:00am today.  Wolfpack ran from 11:30am until 12:50pm.  It took so long today because we went over the employee survey we took a few months ago.  I then jumped in my car, drove over to the bank and cashed my travel expense check.  I got home, went over to the dump in my van, got rid of a bunch of stuff.  Then I drove over to the hardware store and got 10 2"x10"x12' boards.  The cash register where I was checking out took forever, and then I had to wait for the two people before me to load their vehical up.  I finally got home at 3:45pm.  Almost 3 hours to just get a few boards.   Good Times.   It is hot here today.  I am just sitting back drinking colas, wine coolers and gatorade. Thinking about programming.  I checked my electric bill and found out that I didn't have to pay this month :D Oh well, put the payments down to just $50 a month now, that should keep them happy until it gets cold again.  I went wild with the new paper binder I have.  Got a lot of stuff hole punched last night.  Going to keep going tonight with that.  Have a lot of loose papers to get organized.

      I got to work around 1:15 today, made good time, despite heavy traffic.  I am drinking water from my little water cooler that is on my desk.  It is so nice to have fresh cool water so readily available.  Continuing to work on the new tcp port.  I need to add in code to handle binary verse text, append mode, text mode handling and code to turn on callbacks to report Errors, Progress, Tx Data, Rx Data and Messages.  Car pool day today, so I will be out of here a few minutes before 8pm.  I have to check out the code to do a build again on the mac side, so I don't mess up the work I am in the process of doing.  Tomorrow I work at home. I will continue to work on tcpport until it is finished, then merge all my changes in at the same time.

      Got to work around 2.  Parked on the street so I had to run outside and feed the meter a few times.  For work I am in the process of rewriting the TCP Port Widget in terms of the new TCP Object.  This is interesting because I am having to expand the TCP Object and the underlying Dynbuff to "do the right thing" :D   Left work a couple of minutes before 9pm to go have dinner with Posh.  She has been my friend for a couple of years and is moving to Phoenix, AZ.   I'm gonna miss her.  I have an old friend down in AZ that has been bugging me to visit her.  I will have to take her up on that and stop down so I can visit all my friends that have moved down there.  Went home after that around 10:20pm. Traffic was bad around the eye sore that is the stadium.  Got gas and then when I went for my car wash the car wash was blocked.  Good times.  Have to get my car washed next week.

      It is June now.  I bought tickets over the weekend to go home for my family reunion and to goto a game convention with my friends.  I am glad I live a couple thousand miles away from my relatives, but I still love them and like to see them once a year.  The family reunion is when they are on their best behavior.    I couldn't sleep last night.  Ate too late and had bad heart burn.   So I was afraid if I fell asleep I would breath in some vomit again.  I hate when I do that.  I really need to not eat or drink anything after like 8pm.  I put a small personal water cooler in at my desk.  It will give out 8 cups and keeps the water pretty cold.  It will only cool a cup of water every 30 minutes, but that is all I can drink anyway.  I hope that if I drink more water then I will drink less soda pop and that seems to be working so far.  With any luck I will drop a few pounds and feel better if I drink water instead of just pop all the time.  I woke up late and was fuzzy, by the time I goto work it was almost 3pm, the QA guy wasn't happy.  Skipped out on another meeting, they didn't need me at that meeting anyway.

      I drove the van to the cash machine and got out some money and then headed over to the dump.  As soon as I got up on the highway my left front tire began shaking wildly.  So I pulled off the side of the road and drove home at 30mph.   I notice that as I brake the van shakes a lot too. I had plans to goto the dump and empty out the van and then goto the hardware store and buy lumber to frame the back porch, but that isn't gonna happen at this point.  I got home safe and sound and the left front wheel was noticibly hot.  I am thinking I have a busted rotor or something, but can't really see anything under there.  Instead I jump in the car and head over to my friends house and help him put a tree in.  2 times up and down his back yard with a load of sod in a wheelbarrow and some digging and I am whiped out.    We had pizza and then I went home.

      Went to the auto store and got a battery and new windshield wipers for my van.  I removed skin off the side of my left hand, next to my thumb.  Didn't hurt at the time, but it did hurt later.     I also had bought a can of fix a flat for my white prizm car and it half inflated my tire, I drove the car around the neighborhood and felt the tire going down, so I went back home.  Will have to fix that later.   Went home and put a bandaid on my hand, then put the windshield wiper blades into the van.  I managed to stab my thumb with a wood chisel and it bleed a lot, finally got that washed off and a tiny little bandage on it that stopped the blood flow instantly.   Drove the Van around the neighborhood and back home.  I also found a good deal on a paper binding system with those plastic rolls with fingers on them for like half price.  So I bound up a bunch of documents, it looks good.  I am going to make use of that a lot as I try to organize a lot of documentation about vnos, the program I work on.  I also copy a lot of magazine articles that I find useful and those can be binded too.

      I got up and dialed in for the Wolfpack meeting.  That took a while. Lots of changes at work, but they don't seem to affect me much.  After the meeting I worked for a couple of hours on making the headless linux port link and load on os x.  Then I headed over, got license tabs for my Van, and decided to finally fix the 12 volt battery in my Prius.  It had gone dead last year and nothing at the auto store fit, so I put one that was too big in it and hooked it up with jumper cables.  Toyota wanted $320 for a new battery.  Yeah, I thought that too.  So I went to the store and got more stuff for my party.  While I was there I picked up some battery terminals and a few little supplies to try to rig up a perminant solution for the battery in the trunk.  That is on hold for a while.  Looked for a van battery at the store, but they didn't have one the right size.  Took all my winnings and went home.    Worked until like 4am that night, finally got a widget to load in headless mac.

      I went out to Peaches place yesterday and helped her clean up her fiances burnt out house.      Kinda sad and tragic.  She really misses her fiance.  She was just moving in, so luckily most of her stuff was in her trailer still.  She just lost a DVD player, a VHS player and some tapes and DVD's.    I am going out there next weekend and put in some screen doors and screen windows onto her trailer.  The mosquitos were really eating everyone up.    At work I am trying to stir up some action on getting the feature requirements on the current project done.

      Where did the weekend go?    I spent the weekend debunking a lot of fake claims against F911.  Sad that people will just manufacture little jabs at it like this.     I am only about halfway done breaking apart their point by point criticism of the movie.      I figure out that if you take the number of people who approve of the president and minus the number of people that disaprove of the president that this gives you a value between 100 and -100 that pretty much shows what people think of the president at that time.    This week sometime I am going to make a pretty web page with graphs of the presidents since kennedy.  And one graph that overlays everything.    Going home now to fix a computer for a friend.
