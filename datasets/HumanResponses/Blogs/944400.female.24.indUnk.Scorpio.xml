      i had a shitload of dreams last night. i finally fell asleep around 5:30 am and unfortunately kept waking up until about 2 pm.  with that said, here goes...  i dreamt that i was on a mission to find walmart.  why?  because i got a gift certificate to the place for christmas...i don't go there much, and i couldn't find the place in my dream.  i ended up in a really shitty mall and wandered over to the business/industrial side of it (i pretty much created the layout since i have never seen an industrial loop in a mall).  i walk into a meeting that is taking place and overhear the boss say, "i know we can all come up with an idea since we have all bartended before."  i perk up and ask if that's true.  they look at me like i am a jackass and i tell them i am a bartender and i love advertising. i then ask if it was hard for them to get their jobs, because i can't find one at all. i end up mooching on the group and use their computer.  some one else wanders in and gets evil stares from the guys in the room.  i tell them to leave him alone, i used to get lost every semester every year of my life.  (not really, but it was in the dream) ok, moving on, i found walmart. and had all this random stuff in my arms to buy, but it was all crap, and i didn't get anything.  all of a sudden i was sleeping and kept hearing drilling and i reached over to get my phone and couldn't make any calls because it wouldn't work. turns out the drilling was a phone guy doing repairs. i could see him out of the crack in my bedroom door. i got all freaked out cause i was in bed sleeping and didn't want him to come in. don't know the conclusion.  then i was hanging out with my brothers and my stepmom.  we were at a basketball game my brother was in.  my dad didn't show up and that pissed me off. i asked where he was and apparently lisa and this woman they knew growing up had to be on a jury for a high profile case about terrorists and they couldn't talk about it.  and my dad was where? no answer.  next phase i was at this lake and this huge ugly boat was leaving our dock.  i was on the shore with friends, i think sheila was there actually, and i freaked out cause my dad wasn't in the boat or on the dock and there was some equipment still on the dock.  i panicked and jumped off the dock into the water and started swimming after the boat.  my friends started yelling at me to come back and i jumped out of the way of a huge hook that ripped across the water back to the boat.  i almost got snagged.  my dad was on another boat i guess...?  with all the dreams about my dad i never met up with him.    there were more, but i am done with my ranting.  i have to shower and actually do something with my day.

      last night i had some whacked dreams that don't really make much sense...   i was staying with my family (although i only remember my mom and dad being there) in a hotel/motel. it wasn't nice enough to really be considered a hotel and had outdoor entrances to the rooms, etc. well i remember we were packing up to leave and i ran outside first to meet my family. it seems like it took forever to get there. i had to run into this weird lobby and i remember getting into this fight with this old man that looked at me funny. i ran in front of him when he was in line to get coffee and he said something under his breath. i looked at him all pissed off and asked him if we had a problem? i think i kicked his ass and probably poored his coffee on him. i fled the scene. it turns out that we moved to a different room and when i got there i was last to arrive.   so i went swimming. there was a huge pool outside. i was swimming laps and kept kicking this kid underwater. i kicked him pretty hard and had to rescue him. in the process i saw nicole kidman and some girl hiding in the vent of the pool, that was huge enough for people to hide out...kidman kidnapped this kid and i saved her. i brought the girl up to the patio area and everyone got all freaked out and rene zellweger came and got her...?...i was a hero i guess.   dream 2: i was driving my explorer around with a friend and we were trying to escape a really bad situation, but couldn't seem to go fast enough...and we ended up at a million red lights and in shopping malls. it sucked...a true nightmare.   dream 3: in real life i applied to this new bar opening up in old town and their website makes the place seem hoity toity. in the dream i ended up "transported" to the magical fairy land greatness of their bar/restaurant. there was this voice over that was describing the area around the bar. there was a pond, horses, stables, and the typical rich person's white fence that goes around the stable area, there was their huge house, and the bar. and it was kinda like i took a shuttle to their plantation because i was there with a bunch of kids and we were all kind of in awe, but sorta laughing at the situation. so, i may end up working for a rich asshole from the look of the weird dream.   conclusion: last night's dreams actually had a weird sort of substance. i like it a little bit better when i can describe the dream in 1 sentence. i bored myself typing this, but i can't delete it. i like to rant.  and i can. because it's my blog dammit. and it's all about me! and my greatness! and with that said, i am going to take a shower. i smell like a bar.

      alright. so some people know about one of my biggest fears...  my car getting towed. it's happened. it's happened to my beautiful, well, once beautiful, mitsubishi and i have no clue where it is, but someone is enjoying a mighty fine stereo and cd player while i have to hook up a portable one through a tape deck in my soccer mom's vehicle...with this now made public...   i have this really odd habit of running to the window to see if my car is still there at random points of the day. and when i hear a loud, big vehicle i assume it's a tow truck and check to make sure my car is safe. the big noise tends to be UPS, or huge trucks realizing like jackasses they ended up in the shortest culdesac known to man...but i have my reasons for being senile.   this morning i woke up to this god aweful scraping sound. i look outside my window and see a tow truck! i freak the fuck out get up and look harder and realize they are towing a car next to me, but not mine. sigh of relief. i was about to run down stairs and raise some hell.    ok, now on to my actual dream. my family was in it. my brothers, my father, my step mom, and my really mean grandmother. there were some other random people there from the past too.   there was this dude that i carpooled with when working a really shit job. my ex and i would ride to work in his truck that looked like a fucking cow. it was tiny, and it was all white with one black door and a black bed, so it looked like a cow...well he was in my dream and i spilled water on his leather jacket and he got pissed. but the jacket had little cartoon cows on it so i realized he deserved to have it ruinned. it was a gay jacket.   the worst part of the dream was i was putzing in the bathroom and combing my hair when all of a sudden two chunks (huge chunks) fell out. oh my god. i started testing the rest of it, but didn't want to pull at it for fear that i would loose it all. fuckina i have really thin hair already. it was scary. ok. enough for now until i remember anything else. my roommate says i rant...but i just tell it like it is dammit.

      so...it's hard to sleep in this house. it started affecting jason, but at the moment he is inhaling massive amounts of fumes when he goes near his room since he emptied 2+ bottles of tilex to clean his bathroom.  it smells like we have a swimming pool hidden somewhere in the basement.    omar doesn't have insomnia at our residence mainly because he doesn't live here.  it's all on paper, but that's about it. : )  and when he is here he falls asleep like a baby cause he forgot what it feels like to sleep on a bed.  me on the other hand. i have no excuse.  so i go on the computer. and now i am blogging. but i was surfing and found awesome bumper stickers to share with my huge fan base. you all ready?  "The only bush i trust is my own" "gas, grass, or ass, no one rides for free" "always remember you're unique, just like everyone else" "virginity can be cured" "jenna bush stole my id" "remember, pillage first then burn" "we're in big trouble when our bombs are smarter than our president" "abcdfucku"  alright. with that said i am going to try to cure my insomnia while multitasking.  at the moment i am: listening to headphones, text messaging, chatting online, blogging, and surfing the web.  i am tangled in wires, but can do everything in bed like a true lazy ass now that i have a laptop.  i even get a workout since it's on my legs at the moment and i am lifting it up and down to get comfortable since it weighs about 10 pounds.

      alright. so just to let everyone who cares that doesn't already know. i am now officially bozo the clown, or as omar likes to point out, a female carrot top.  i "beattied" my hair last night and i am orange like a crayola crayon.  what to do with this situation...i'm thinking i will streak it some other color and keep up with the motif.  for the record:  this is the first time that i fucked up my hair...this color anyway.  for the record again: i can't believe that i woke up, turned on my computer and am blogging.  i could just talk to myself. i think that would be a shitload easier and take a lot less effort.  from one viewpoint at least i am doing something productive with my unemployed day.  but one can say that i am being a tekkie nerd jackass that goes one step beyond senile and types to talk to herself. anyway...let's get on to the topic at hand shall we... before my add gets carried away, dreams. last night, or anywhere from 6:30 am to oh about 1 pm...:) i dreamt:  that i went back to this place i have been interviewing at to get a job bartending.  the people have been wasting my valuable time btw...and i was all dressed up and talking to a manager i haven't talked to before.  i don't know what i was filling out, but i think it was the equivalent of a performance eval. even though i didn't work there at all, but was trying to. ok. so i talk and write a lot and at the bottom of the application i ran out of room and had to hurry up, well the bottom of the application was a towel and my ink from the pen came out all white and funny and i had to draw arrows up to the paper again to sign my name and put some other stuff... yeah...and the dude i was talking to started talking to the employees and i was one of the gang! only better cause i wasn't wearing the uniform.  i was wearing a black skirt, a burgundy top that looked suspiciously like the uniform everyone was wearing, and a black leather jacket.  my "boss" told me to go grab 3 coffees, 2 milks, in to go cups, the huge ones, and like the bitch i am i run off. keep in mind i was there for an interview.   so...i hunt down the coffee area, and the coffee is in a huge barrel, like a barrel drum seen in breweries. heh, and i couldn't find huge cups. finally i spotted them, but they were up high and i started jumping like a midget trying to reach them.  two chicks tha worked there came around and i asked if they liked working there. they said yeah, but getting coffee sucked.  we bonded.  then one of them told me i was dressed down for coming in to an interview and they probably wouldn't hire me.  i was thinking, "bitch i'm all dressed up and getting the asshole coffee, he better hire me." i looked down and i'm in a sweatshirt, jeans, and a leather jacket. hmmm. suspicious.  anyway. got the coffee into huge styrafoam cups and the fucking lids wouldnt close down. what to do. i have no idea, no closure...what does this mean?  how can i apply this to my life...  moving on.  so all of a sudden i'm outside and running with this pack of kids. freaky.  then sheila is there and this old lady who appears to be a teacher.  she's like, "we need to give the kids a chance to be one with the cheetah.  they need to know what it's like to give chase and be hunted. only then with they know about the cheetah."  um. and i guess the lady is the cheetah cause she is running like an ass at everybody who is running everywhere else around her.  cut, end of scene.  i had more. i know it, but i was forced out of my slumber at 12 pm by my first phone call. then at 1ish by my second.  don't people realize i sleep all day. fuckin-a. and it's for that reason that my blog isn't longer. blame the phone calls.  with that, i am going to post.

      Ok. So I am deciding to take part in all the hooplah and see what blogging is truly about. Let's see...my last entry was...in October...2002. I am truly dedicated to daily entries. It's cool as I am probably the only one viewing my site as no one commented on my personal and exciting October entry.  Let's see if I can outdo my prior blogging experience and give the world a little more excitement.  What did I do today:  I shoveled.  What am I doing now:  I am dying my hair.  According to Clairol it is going to be an "intense copper." Hmm. But now it is bright orange and shit, I forgot to time it. It has been my backup hair dye and I am too big of a chickenshit to brave the snow and go buy a new color, so this may end up a catastrophe as I have no clue how old the dye is. But then again, this is my element of mystery and intrigue. I may end up like Bozo.   I haven't written this much since I was forced to comply with George Mason University professors in order to succeed and successfuly enter the workforce. Coincidentally, I am unemployed and am a graduate.

      i had a lot of cool dreams last night and i woke up earlier than normal, which is weird (12:30).  in one of them, i was in the old family van with my sister, and my mom and dad.  we were going on a trip to get parts for a car, which turned out to be my explorer.  and we were towing a trailer! haha. i hate camping, but apparently that's what we were in the process of doing.  i remember i had to rearrange some stuff in the back seat and i was so proud of myself when i was done.  i moved the cooler and some other stuff so the sun wouldn't get it, etc. i was so pleased with my efforts i asked dad to take a look.  so he gets out of the driver's seat (i think we were still driving too) and he said it looked good, and we could watch tv while he was gone since we did a good job.   next phase, all of a sudden dad's gone to get a part and we are in the middle of hicksville.  mom is in the front seat and my sister and i are in the back.  then we see this weird lady trying to get into this tiny convenience store.  and all around us are hispanic day laborers...we were in the ghetto of whatever town we were in.  i teleported myself into the store with my mom and sister and we are looking around and everything was pretty much looted.  it was like we were watching a news story or i could see the past too, because i was able to see that the lady was trying to get food cause she was starving, but the store kept giving her spoiled food that the bees were getting into...and the lady kept saying that the bees were sick and smelled funny.  i asked mom if we should give the lady some food. she said no.   so we went outside.  and i was going to go back to the car, but there was this hispanic guy leaning on our trailer! fucker!  and he was on his phone, right by our door and i freaked out. i told mom and my sister to get into the car and i was going to go in the trailer. so, i went into the trailer and my dog, Chip, was there!  how cool. so we hung out in the trailer and i locked the door so the dude couldn't get in.  all of a sudden there was banging at the door, and my sister was there trying to get in, yelling at me to get my attention.  she was completely different than real life, she was older, blonde, and was wearing a skanky outfit =), but it was her just the same. she was freaking out and was holding out her hands to me, telling me to smell her because that was what sick bees smelled like.  ??? so Chip, my sister, and i went back to my mom and got in the car.  the day laborer gave me a dirty look as he walked away from the trailer.  we called my dad and told him to come back because we were in a freaky ghetto with weird people and sick smelly bees.  all of a sudden we see this huge ghetto cemetery, right next to us on the other side of the street.  it's blocked by a big ghetto chain fence.  and there are groups of mexicans riding over graves down the huge hill on makeshift sleds with wheels.  and all of a sudden our family (with our dog) is one of the groups on the sleds....it was so weird. and that is all i remember.  my consensus of the dream:  there were killer bees in the ghetto town. maybe the only people that were immune to the smelly killer bees were the mexicans...because they were really the only people there.  the lady in the store was sick because the bees were getting her and she was eating food tainted by the bees...and the huge ghetto grave yard took up half the town...i smell an awesome plot for a new horror movie.   Killer Smelly Bees  no?  alright, a break in the whole dream sequence thing.  i am IMing my sister, which is a rare occurence since she has a life. and i told her that i dreamed about her last night and would give her my site address when i am done typing and her response, "geeze joy, you're a nerd."  i promptly told her to fuck off and then said that blogging is...normal. and she retorted,   " loser. send me the link when you're done. im gonna watch tv."   she's just jealous.  my other dream was really detailed too, but i'll save anyone that is reading this the horror of reading through another long dream sequence:  i was running away from something and was into aliases.  i kept changing my look to get away and was in a seedy motel for most of the dream.  it was really long and try as i might i couldn't escape this weird guy that was chasing me. but at least he didn't smell and wasn't a sick bee.  i'm out.

      the dreams are back...  i dreamed that i was having dinner with some friends at a weird asian restaurant.  we were there because one of the guys i was with was interested in the waitress. she sucked.  i asked for pho (noodle soup) and was given a tiny pile of noodles instead.  i asked her wear the soup was...and she walked away.  i asked her when she came back and she said it wasn't on the menu. hmmm...then i asked for hoison sauce and was given a container of sour cream instead. so we were pretty pissed.  that part of the meal segued to one of the girls behind the counter.  she was giving an interview (it was like i was behind the scenes for a tv interview) and was spinning (riding a stationary bike) on the beach.  it turned out to be a girl i didn't like in high school. so it was weird.  the interview implied that the girl in high school i knew was a big success.    the next one was a rich woman who lived in a huge house, but was in rehab because she took too many drugs.  she was learning how to read in the dream and the chick turned out to be ally sheedy...from the breakfast club...heh.  so all the girls in the dream were aparently picked to run the asian restaurant for a new tv show and that's probably why the blond chick didn't know about anything on the menu...add in a washup that can't read and you have yourself a knockout show.  next...i was flying.  i was out with my father in this dream, but other people there were friends and stuff, it was kind of confusing.  so we were back at the lake we used to go to in the summer, but it was way more glamorous and really pretty.  it was a completely different lake/area.  we were water skiing, but ended up flying. hah, it was totally weird.  but really cool. and i don't remember the rest, except we started and landed in water and it freaked me out when i woke up.  there were more, but i only remember fragments.  i was at home again and my sister was with me, we were living in a totally different house and had roommates, but were hanging out without them.  it was dark, and there were candles lit in rooms that were empty, which freaked me out (someone else was in the house)...dun dun dun...  and in another one, one of my roommates was perry ferrell, or a guy just like him.  he was in some kind of trouble and was moving out and i didn't want him to leave.  that and some of the other people there were guys i went to high school with.    all of last night's dreams had old friends and people i don't see much anymore...it was pretty cool.

      o put dog shit on my jeans yesterday.  and then he sniffled and sheila stood up for him because he was sick.  but that doesn't take away from the fact that he took his foot and rubbed shit on me.  this is not southpark.  you may be hallucinating due to your impaired health, but we live in arlington and we were not painting walls with cartman.  dammit.  just wait till i find a nice cozy place to stash some dog crap. : ) oh and i retract the comment made yesterday in which i stated that i was upset that someone stole my internet connection...which wasn't really mine to begin with.  that certain somebody gave me back the wonder of the world wide web and things are swell.  i worked so hard at work today and only spent roughly $16 to do it.  i can't wait till i get paid.    so, here is my dilema.  i sleep the same amount that i used to, but i can't remember the dreams because i can't lounge and "re-sleep" anymore now that i have a job.  Resleeping is falling back to sleep because i have nothing else to do, like work and such.  so i have no dreams to reveal.    "about last night"  last night i saw a bunch of friends from different circles, which is really cool.  after hanging out i got a call from one of my roommates cause they needed a jump.  turns out aaa stood him up and i had jumper cables and set out on my journey to help him.  long story short, we could have died, because we were jumping the batt in the dark without any light source except my headlights, which couldn't face his car based on how it was parked.  through trial and error, nothing worked...and then i drove to cvs and bought a flashlight.  we rejumped and gave his car newfound life.  it only took about an hour in the freezing cold.  so...i learned that trial and error doesn't always work...and always have a flashlight in your car.  i'm going to go write my book now, so adios.

      someone (not mentioning names, but it's one of the 3 of you that actually read this site...) took back the internet connection from my room...and now all i have is a 10 year old lap top to use as dumb bells...and i haven't been able to update. so much has happened!  1) i had my first day at work in a long time...and it was in an office.  i felt like it was my first day of school.  so..what happened to me at work. **yours truly made the mistake of ordering a large sumatra from starbucks before working and had to pee like a race horse, or has sheila likes to call it, "tinkle."  i had to "tinkle" real bad.  but i felt like i was in school and couldn't ask to go...do you ask when it's the first day and you don't know who your boss is because the office is ultra casual?  is there a big wooden pass?  i finally got to go after 5 hours.  wow. i was so happy when i finally took the tour and realized there was an office bathroom 20 feet from my desk. (it was in the back and through a weird looking closet, so i didn't miss a huge door marked "bathroom" or anything)  ok...so i wanted to leave so bad...i felt so accomplished, but so ready to go home.  AND i left the office and it was daylight out.  just last week i was waking up around this time...so i think i am moving up in the world.    with all the positive things mentioned, let me go ahead and say that the office is in a mall...and with my beginner's salary i feel like i am back in high school!  i am amidst kids, and drop outs, and mall walkers in their suits and tennies...i am sure glad i finished college. but i can't wait to learn and climb that corporate ladder and succeed.  ok..moving on. i fogot my money and my atm password...because i usually had cash on hand, when i actually worked behind the bar that is, so...i need money to get out of the mall.  and it was 7 bucks...and i had dos dollares.  i found a whopping 5 bucks in change in my car and finally made it out.  but i think i severely pissed off the parking lady. but it's not like she has anything else to do but count money...  and with that said, it was my first day.  counting the coffee...i spent about $9 to work my first day.

      well, it's happened...work has officially screwed up my sleeping schedule.  i used to sleep the day away and now i wake up at normal hours on the weekends when i should be sleeping until 2 or 3 in the afternoon...i  am a  little ashamed that my body is taking to a normal routine.  i get tired around 2 or 3 am now, instead of 4 or 5 in the morning...i'm not good with change. i have been waking up a bunch of times in my sleep, however, which means i have more dreams to ramble about.  most of the dreams last  night were about my family. it was weird because there would be certain objects in the dream that belong to my family or me in the past, but all the settings were new.  in the first dream i remember, i was trying to drive home (virginia) from some unknown location, i can only assume it's wisconsin.  i was with my father, stepmom, and brothers and at one point i was leaving home and at another they were in my tiny mitsubishi eclipse with me.  i remember i never drove that far alone before and didn't have a map, but all of a sudden i saw a sign for I95 and i got all excited because i had to be going the right way.  then the road stopped and there were mud hills everywhere and what appeared to be a road carved out of mud and a pretty big dropoff. i tried to drive on the curved mud "road" but fell off part of the way.  my father yelled at me and i told him the road disappeared, there was nothing i could do about it.  the car behind me was pissed cause he couldn't get around and he kept  beeping.  then all of a sudden this plow that was moving dirt came up to us and plowed me back on the dirt road.  i was all excited, but then my car wouldn't turn, the wheel was stuck.  i told my dad and he explained that my car wouldn't turn because the tow truck pushed   me by my wheel and messed up the axle...he told me to remember when i was in my car accident and my car wouldn't move afterwards so i couldn't move it off the street, and that this was the same thing, essentially.  so we were screwed and i was so upset because my car was pretty much dead.  the only other part of the dream i remember is sleeping over at my father's house again, but it was a different house than the one i went to growing up.  i remember sleeping on the tiniest bed alive (which i had when i visited) and that's it.  next dream, i remember shopping in the mall for my "boyfriend."  i remember smelling colognes, etc. it was weird.  then i am at the house with my family where i grew up. i remember feeling so happy being with everyone.  then all of a sudden doug and jenna had a riff with my parents and they decided they weren't going to celebrate christmas with them.  so i am in a different house with my brother and sister and i am trying to be a mediater and get them to hang out together, but doug was pretty adament about staying on his own.  and i remember the tree didn't have any ornaments on it, but there were a ton of presents.  i wrapped one for jenna and it had bubble wrap all over it...i thought it was the coolest thing,  but she didn't really care.  there were bums hanging out there too, because doug invited anyone to come over.  then all of a sudden mom and dad and the dogs come over.  no one is fighting at all and the living room all of a sudden changes.  i remember i couldn't breathe normally and was sniffing a lot.  one of our dogs was still a puppy and was really tiny so my dad kept yelling that we needed to be careful of him.  one of my toys was a gun that shot out little foam discs and i started shooting them off and the pup got all excited, but couldn't get any  of the discs. it was weird, my mom didn't say a word the whole time.  i woke up from that one and couldn't breathe, my  nose was all stuffed.  the dream before that my  mom and i were hanging out in  my bedroom.  i was getting ready in the bathroom and all of a sudden there was an extra floor mat and seat cover that didn't match my bathroom. i told her to give it to doug, since his bathroom was probably empty.  although the mats were totally girly. they were a weird teal with pink palm trees on it.   i came out of the bathroom and my mom was in her bathrobe lying on the floor doing a crossword puzzle.  there were candles all around the book and the wax was melting into the carpet.  i freaked out and moved the candles.   that's all i really remember... last night's from thursday were insane. i'll sumarize since i don't remember all of them and this is a long ass blog... my brother and i were trying to impress my father.  we were in minnesota where we used to go in the summers and were hanging out at the lake we went to as kids.  there were a bunch of outdoor pizza restaurants and people were making the pizzas on the ground.  my brother tried too and had all these crusts all over like a little assembly line.  he messed up from there.  he put the cheese on first and then the sauce, etc. so i tried to help him.  then we were all hanging out on the dock on our lake...and my brother was making a sandwhich for my father, but again he messed it up. he would smash the bread when he was done making the sandwhich, so it looked like ass.  we were getting ready for the superbowl.  all of a sudden we were in a car on the dock and this big projection screen came out of the sky and we watched the game while on the dock...it was really odd.  then i was on a beach at another lake and everyone was running away from the water.  it got really dark and started to rain and i had to rescue all of my stuff which was sitting at the bottom of the lake  apparently.  my phone, and some clothes, etc were all in the lake.  people told me i was crazy to go in the water, but i went and got all my stuff and hightailed it out of there.

      so, my sister had a good birthday as did v, at least it looked that way as i left the bar... first topic of the night...i talked to my sister today and she had to work on her birthday.  she turned 18 today and just got a job at a tanning salon. she better not start fake baking at the place...our family already looks weird, but we are fair skinned and were not meant to be orange.  She has to clean up after all the prisses who are tanning and that makes me mad.  I have had a lot of shit jobs since i turned 15, but i take it personally whenever my sister gets stuck doing a crap job for no money.  i told her she needed to quit her baby sitting job when she only made $5 an hour and had to clean the kid's diapers...that's a shitload of money compared to what i made...but still, that's nothing for what she's doing for those people.   i told her to quit her old navy job based on the premise that she worked at old navy.  i would go insane.  although it was kind of cute seeing a 4'11'' tiny girl (my sister) walking around with a headset directing traffic and folding clothes.   she got paid jack to wait tables at baker's square (where she still works).  this is a tiny bit more "upscale" than an IHOP...in wisconsin...where all the clientele is either too poor or too young to go to an establishment that serves liquor.  based on the fact that you have old loosers with no cash and kids who spend hours drinking coffee and making messes, it's a worthless place to make money. and now she is going to wipe down sweaty tanning booths for orange blonde freaks from wisconsin??? she's following in my footsteps of having gay jobs...  last night i dreamed that my friends were made of cheese. don't know what kind of cheese, but it was quite weird.   before i dreamed of cheese, i googled myself.  i put my full name and also "joy's world."  i am not on google, unless i am page 25 or over...but joy is a popular name for sluts...quite interesting.  and joy's world is used so frequently i am thinking i need to change the name of my site.  so...whoever reads this, if they can think of anything better, actually comment this time.  speaking of comments and web traffic on my spectacular site...i installed a web counter and am up to 37 people visiting my site! although...it's probably mainly from me checking to see if it's up and running...i'll take the number. that's pretty good. and the average length of time spent on the site is about 1 minute. given the length of my posts...they probably start reading and give up after 1 or 2 paragraphs. or are scanning for porn and don't see any and give up.  time to go, i have to bump up my visitors to about 50 or so and then go to bed, i am actually going to work early tomarrow...on the bright side of that, i'll have more time to visit my blog and increase the traffic flow.

      i work up this morning to a really disturbing dream that o and i were mermaids. i told him the dream today and he made a point of telling me that he was a merMAN...but it was my dream and he was a mermaid.  we were trying to stay underwater and away from some evil lady.  it was really weird because i remember struggling to breath, but if i was a mermaid, breathing underwater really wouldn't be a problem.  ?  it was weird, but made perfect sense at the time.  i also remember sheila was in one of my dreams, but can't remember what it was about.    it was Christmas in another one.  both sides of my family were together, which was weird since my parents split when i was 3...and they have never been in the same social setting since unless they are on complete opposite sides of whatever room, building, yard, football field, etc...anyway, in addition to that phenomena, we were celebrating with my stepmom's side of the family and i haven't seen them much in the past 6 years since i moved to the east coast.  the boys were grown up in the dream, but were still acting like little kids.  we were all playing on someone's living room floor and it felt very strange to be hanging out playing like we were 5 years old.  then i was in someone else's house, but it had a familiar feel to it, like it was mine, or someone close to me.  i was snooping through stuff in the bathroom.  it was so intriguing to me.  it turns out it was my cousin's (on my mom's side of the family) stuff.  we used to hang out all the time and sleep over at each other's houses after major holidays or birthday parties, so we were really close growing up...i thought their stuff was so cool. i woke up and remember wondering why my cousin used that smell of deodorant and that i wished i had some that was that cool. i think i need help.  with all the dream crap aside,  i got my business cards today!   i officially feel like a grownup.  i think i am going to go to work tomarrow and put together a media kid (with my business card enclosed) and send it to my parents.  =) Maybe they'll stick my card on their fridge.  I actually gave out my card to two people today, four counting o and sheila... i don't think they gave a shit, but i am pretty happy about it.  it's my sister's birthday tomarrow and also one of my best friend's.  i'll drink to them both. more on that tomarrow.

      dreaming is hard to do when you only have 3 hours to sleep before you wake up to go to work and keep looking at the alarm clock. i am now awake and ready to make "funny money" at my day job and am still seeing the red of my alarm clock. i hope today goes by fast so i can nap.  i don't think God made me to work, at least not during the day.  i need to find a sugar daddy to support me.  i do the sleep thing backwards...i finally get tired when i wake up.  i think i am starting to relive high school, what with my new job in the mall and the urge/need to start popping vivarin again. there may be a bright side to this...i may meet an older guy and start having sex in cars again...who knows where this new life may lead me!

      i had some weird ones... the first one i remember was in this huge house with an insane spiral staircase.  there were so many weird characters in it that were supposed to be my family and my friend's family.  the friend remained invisible through the part of the dream i remember.  we were running around the house, usually on the staircase, like we were trying to escape people, i assume it was the adults.  running on the stairs is dangerous apparently, because two of the guys fell down the stairs and died.  now what to do?  one of the girls running around was the chick in ghostworld, which was weird.  all of a sudden we were in the basement, which was an odd mausoleum.  the women were cutting the heads off the dead bodies.  they burned the bodies and kept the heads...that's all i really remember.    then i had a little bit of the dream where members of my family were all together in this tiny, strange kitchen.  it was up to me to find them something to eat. everything was expired or just weird...i remember weird juices and old Easter chocolate.  my grandfather was in the dream, my brothers and sister, one of my older cousins on my dad's side of the family, which is a weird mix...it was odd to say the least.  then i was in this school where all the kids were young ( i assume it was grade school or middle school) and everyone was black.  i don't know if my friend and i were invisible or accepted, because we were the only people there that weren't black.  we are in a gymnasium and the kids are going nuts.  there's a talent show going on and all the performers are adults.  the group that is performing is making the crowd insane and the pathetic band practicing was in for a surprise because i remember i was panicking about the outcome.  there was this huge guy in dreads playing the drums and he looked insane, then i look down and there's this sick looking white guy in a wheelchair with drum sticks in his hands.  i don't see any instrument in front of him.  i look into the crowd and fear for this dude's safety.  then i see all the kids throwing stuff and picking on this one row of white ladies with bandanas on their heads.  they looked like undercover nuns and were all freaked out; some were crying.  they eventually ran out.  my friend told me the guy on stage getting ready to "play" had cancer.  this was a completely random fact and i don't know if it was mentioned because we were at a benefit concert, or what, but the kids were ruthless.  i mentioned that we were not welcome and should high tail it out of there.  all of a sudden we are outside in a post apocalyptic looking desert.  there are military men everywhere and the school we just left was a deserted city.  we ran into another bad situation, because most of the military men looked severely pissed off and were looking for another group of military men who set one area of their makeshift camp on fire.  the fire was still going on and the men were no where to be found.  the leader told us to take the kids and go back to the deserted city, which was the last thing i wanted to do...but there was gunfire and chaos and a shitload of military men started grabbing kids and us and we ran back to the racist bastards.  then i woke up and was curling my hair in bed while reading magazines.  i was buried under my covers like it was a makeshift tent.  i was looking at anything within armlength of my bed so i wouldn't have to get out.  most of the mags were style mags and they were weird with coupons for odd makeup products.  i remember looking at them, but they were 2 years old...  and then my cell phone rang and woke up from my "stay in bed and avoid all movement" dream.  i wasted the morning and half of the afternoon, so i am going to get ready and get some pho ; )

      i had so many weird dreams last night... in one i was at my family's cabin on the lake we used to go to as kids.  i was sitting on the dock eating a sandwhich and it fell in the water.  all of a sudden this duck swam over and grabbed it and was fighting with it.  i was laying on the dock with my feet in the water and my uncle was like, "i wouldn't lay like that if i were you" and pointed at my feet. there was this really weird jelly like substance coming up out of the water by my toes.  it got bigger and bigger and jumped up on the dock. it was  a person all covered in goo.  my uncle told me they were the  new jelly fish and i should stay away from them.  i pushed it back in the water.  it was weird while the man/jelly fish was chasing me his life story was being told out loud like a tv program.  then he disappeared.  in another one i was hanging out with my family.  i was sharing a room with my sister again and she had some awesome flowers that were dying, so i cut the ends and put some wine in a vase and started rearranging them, but she walked in on me doing it.  all of a sudden i was in a  bathroom.  i don't know if i was showering, or what but i was half nekked and had to run back to my room without my family seeing me.  so i grabbed a hand towel and held it in front of my ass and ran out.  i think i made it.  there was all this stuff on my bed that someone put there from downstairs (like they were cleaning up my crap to get it out of the way). one of the things on my bed was a box of flava pops that weren't frozen.  i  never eat those...my sister had a box  of tootsie rolls.  i was a little jealous...and i heard my step grandma saying goodbye and congrats to my sister, who was jingling a set of keys (did she get a car???)  i didn't want to have to talk to my grandma, so i stayed upstairs.  next dream, i was hanging out with all my friends from high school.  i was driving a friend's car and we were trying to get out of a festival and couldn't seem to get away.  then i was in this house with all my family members from my mom's side, and some other random people were there, including this girl i used to bartend with.  my cousin was going to play a guitar she found behind this set of curtains, but it wasn't tuned and she didn't have a "tuner" so she asked me for one. i told her i didn't have one and she got all frustrated. a few minutes later, my friend the old bartender, came up with this box of new weird equipment that looked like it worked with a computer. she said it was for the guitar and plugged one part in to it, and put headphones on me and plugged it in too. apparently i was the middle man between the guitar and my cousin, and the rest of the family.  i was supposed to talk while she played. ? i said no, but they made me.  i remember speaking to my grandma about her computer.  she wanted a colored monitor for her computer. and then my other cousin was making shots for everyone.  my guitar playing cousin ordered a half jager half ambuca (doesn't exist) and i remember all of a sudden a full bar appeared and i helped him get his shit together. he made the shot, which i took as well, and i almost puked.  somehow baileys ended up in it as well.  it was so nice out yesterday so i opened my window. all morning the wind has been blowing my door open, and slaming it a second later. and it's fucking freezing in here. i thought someone was spying on me, and not being to slick about it as they were slamming the door...damn wind and windows and loose doors!  if it wasn't for the combination i'd be in bed until 2 or 3!!!

      I HATE WOODY ALLEN MOVIES  i fell asleep during his most recent flick, which drove home the fact that a) i should have read the back of the dvd before i rented it, b) that two binge drinkers should never go to happy hour and then rent three movies and expect to get through a 2 hour feature film and c) that two girls should never go rent movies together...one person at a time brings better results... i fell asleep to woody allen and wasted 2 hours i will never get back.

      ok i have to get ready for work, so i am going to try to be quick... in one dream i bought these cool, hard to find posters for o and i was so excited about it, because it was something he'd really like.  i told sheila about them and she agreed that he'd like them. he finally came home (we were still living together, but the house was different) and he was apathetic and it turned out he already had one of the posters...i was pissed.  end of scene.  next sheila and i were in a computer lab thing and teachers (who were really young) came in.  we were in a testing area apparently.  sheila was so nervous; she had to put a collection of photos together.  a friend of mine, shannon, was also in the dream. she let all of us stay at her house one night and gave us the pics.  then her fiance came home and was sorta pissed we were all there...weird. ok, so sheila finished her project and while she was working, i was taking my own test.  i was speedy about it too, i finished in seven minutes, when it should have taken 20...got a B, but have no clue what it was about.  then sheila and i are walking down a huge, empty street and it's really dark.  there's snow and slush everywhere and cars are parked on the street, but no one is around.  i told her that this is how i kept dreaming the end of the world would be, and it was very apoctalyptic.  she thought i was weird.  then this girl picked us up in a cab and said she'd drive us where we wanted to go.  all of a sudden bandit is with us.  the woman said she had errands to run so she wouldn't charge us the fare since we went along with her and they were far away from where we were going.  when she said this i was opening a pack of colored pencils i had when i was a kid.  we ended up driving down Arlington Ridge, but the street never ended.  sheila and i started playing this game: we'd take 3 houses right next to each other and pick the one we wanted to live in.  the houses were still huge, but different from what is really there.  and while we were driving, the cab driver was in the back seat with us and ended up  not driving the cab...?  all of us end up at a bar that looks a lot like the 4 Courts. we meet up and the group keeps getting bigger and bigger. i suggest that we should get a table because it's important that i talk to o about painting our place.    and it doesn't end there!  but it's too scrambled and i need to shower and need coffee for work, so i'm audi 5000.

      here is the long awaited post...i can't remember many dreams lately since i am constantly woken up by the damn alarm!  and it isn't mine!  a note to the mysterious alarm that magically goes off in the godforsaken hours before i need to get up: shut it off, dammit.  if it happens again i think i'll call you and wake  you   up and tell you to turn it off!  i do remember, however, one of the dreams last night...it goes a little something like this:  i was in a commune-like setting.  i was surrounded by people i knew, but i couldn't place them in my real life...except for sheila and her parents, who were there. and the place we were hanging out is somewhere i've been before.  in real life about 6 years ago, i stayed at a friend's house in boulder, co...and was only there for about a week.  the commune scenario takes place in the friend's apartment...anyway i remember sheila and i were in a huge rush; we were on our way to work.  we were getting dressed and i realized after i was supposedly all set to go, that i forgot to put on underwear.  problem.  everyone was leaving together (that was the general feeling at the time, leading up to my sense of panic!)  i didn't want to strip in front of everyone, so i tried to get to the bathroom.  i finally made it in, found my underwear, and tried to put it on. then people kept trying to get in the door. i remember sheila opened it and stuck her head in and i hid behind something and was acting like i was just hanging out...wearing underwear like everyone else. like she would have known just by looking at me...i was in the clear!  i was so weirded out by the situation. and there was no solution at the end of the dream! was i found out?    another reason why i have neglected my blog is that i've been coming home the last couple of nights sooooo drunk and tired that i go right to sleep.  it would be too much effort to type!  and i have sheila's parents to thank for that.  i couldn't keep up and can't imagine how they got by the days after our drinking binges...i love hanging out with them and am so glad they adopted me for the week.  end of blog...to my faithful 3 (?) readers...was it worth the wait???

      What is it about being an 18 year old girl that is so attractive to men?  Especially old men?  Is it that everyone is secretly a child molester and decides to get by the barely legal way?  Or if you reach an age where women your own age don't want you, you figure you'll fit in with the fresh meat and will be so much more attractive since you can buy them wine coolers?  And because you look rich because you are making more than minimum wage and can help out with homework?  If i knew i could get an older guy when i was 18 i would have promoted myself a little bit better...damn it.  Moving on....Angel got cancelled and my room mate was crying about it last night. i have no clue what he's going to tivo now, with angel and buffy finally dying. : ) sorry, O.  In other news, i was trying to work my charm on this guy at the bar the other night and another guy came up and started talking to me and farted in my personal space.  he lingered for awhile and finally left, making me look like the farter.  damn farting jackass...what do you do in a situation like that?  moving on to the dreams, and then i'm done. last night i actually don't remember a lot of them...but i do remember walking around an amusement park with sheila and looking at attractions.  they were building an egyptian one with lots of bridges over us that were really skinny and sorta dangerous, like in an indiana jones movie.  and then i was in the middle of jessica simpson and nick whatever's world and she was going to be in a new disney cartoon.  she was dressed up as a snake and was painted green and was part of the attraction we were all at. she was trying to swerve her head like a snake and kept fucking up. then we were in a nursery in their mansion and she sent nick some wall paper border with a cartoon scene with her in it.  what a self-centered bitch!  so i am predicting they are going to get pregnant and have a demon child.  the only dream from the other night that i remember and forgot to post is that i was in a city for another celebration and my dad was there. and all of a sudden milwaukee and washington dc merged, because there were landmarks from both in the same city.  it was deja vu all over again too, because i remember dreaming about the same type of thing, with the same scenery, etc. i'd pass when walking that doesn't really exist.  there were a lot of promotions going on too and instead of miller lite, there was budweiser everywhere!   that's it. i am off to shower and try to find work...

      At the top of my blog site, there is an advertisement that is custom made according to the info on my blog...this morning it was advertising information about sleep disorders...what are they trying to say about me???  the only dream i remember from last night is working in this podunk Irish pub.  I was cocktailing, but was bartending as well. Every booth had its own bar...it was a weird set-up.  The owner, who was a grumpy old man like the ASSHOLE i used to work for (Tommy C, btw) ordered a cocoa martini.  I was like, ok...i can DO this!  i grabbed vodka, white and dark creme de menthe, and baileys...for some reason, i made an awesome cocoa martini, and shook it up, looking for a martini glass, when the pint i was shaking it in shattered.  fuck. now what, i looked for another glass to make another drink in and there were none. there were no glasses at any table. i finally found one, then the liquors were gone.  i finally found them and made it again and set it down in front of him.  i had a little extra, which is taboo, and i slickly dumped it on the ground so if he asked if i had any left, i'd be like, "well no i don't, would you look at that?"  he spit the martini out and said it was too sweet. fucker. he only wanted me to use one cassis and the vodka...i told him that that drink wouldn't be a cocoa martini.  he just looked at me. it reminded me a lot of my old 'boss'...fucker.   oooh, i remember another one.  i was hanging out with heine and she found a guy (she was single btw in the dream) and the guy and her were getting pretty close, and our groups ended up splitting up for awhile.  then i ended up in this hotel/weird room where we were crashing and heine wanted to come in with the dude. well, her mom and dad wouldn't let them in because they could smell them from across the room.  hah.  and then i was in gym class again.  but i was watching it from a balcony with these people i used to go to school with.  there was a group of kids playing basketball, some were getting ready to swim, and some were tumbling.  it was a weird dream.  the tumblers had one tiny girl, one reg girl, and a big one.  the big one was pulling herself up by the arms and passing herself to the other ones.  the little chick was struggling to hold the big one up and barely made it. it was weird.  then i was at out summer cabin at the lake. i remember my crabby grandmother was there, as were some friends and family members...i think that's where heine's smelly dream began.

      i dreamed i was at my high school again, the school was different, but there were people there that i did go to school with.  i was looking for a parking spot in my eclipse and it was a really shitty day as far as snow was concerned.  it was everywhere and blocked the parking lot and made it hard to see which areas were legal to park in and which would land you a ticket.  i passed a primo spot, but had to turn around to get it, and some bitch got it before i could make it back.  in the time it took for her to get the spot, i saw a car full of my friends, dan, jimmy, and dave.  then a car with these dudes i was friends with from high school drove past, they also got a good spot. i ended up parking next to a school bus full of freshmen from another school that was there for a sporting event...and i was in my explorer this time.  then i backed up and was attempting to get a better spot, and all of a sudden i was on a bike...?...i ended up walking to the school, which had an outdoor cafeteria that was under constuction and ended up in the smallest "auditorium" ever.  we were watching the seniors walk in a weird procession.  they weren't wearing caps or gowns and were just walking around and half of us were watching, not participating...  then i was in my graduation, i was so excited and was looking for my mom in the crowd.  it was my turn to grab my diploma and smile for a pic and shake hands and stuff, but i unzipped my gown and didn't have my cap on.  so i was in a rush to get it all done and the guy giving us the diploma stopped me and helped me with my cap and it was all videotaped.  then i was walking around with sheila and omar and we were trying to get somewhere ( i don't know where)...but it was something for me and we had enough time to stop in a bar and grab a drink and i was going to be late. we were hanging out in this super tiny mountain town, it was really odd...  and i was in a weird gymnasium setting with a bar, i was talking to friends and these girls were jump roping lext to us a little ways away.  my friends were talking about one of the jumpers, who was a girl we went to high school with.  she used to be really pretty but got cancer and went on a weird treatment that deformed her face and made her hair permanently short.  my friends were saying that she shouldn't have gone on the meds and it was a shame she changed.  this older lady next to us said it was a good thing the jumping girl had friends like us...and the girl came up to the bar area and heard part of the conversation.  we were all embarrased as she found out what we were talking about. and she got really mad at the lady and said we were right and couldn't believe what it did to her.  it turns out the lady was her mom and made her go on the meds and she would have been fine without them...  and i was on a trip with my family.  my dad was there, and i remember my mom and brother were as well.  it was a long one, but i don't remember it clearly.  i just remember certain members leaving for the trip and coming back and that i really wanted to go on a road trip.  i remember driving down the highway with a guy i didn't know. i am assuming he was really hot and we were an awesome couple...anyway...we were on a great roadtrip i can't remember.  the end, i have to pee and get the bar smell off of me from last night and go to work.

      i dreamed that v and i were hanging out in my room and i was freaking out because i couldn't see my car.  she was like, it's right there, and pointed out the window.  then i pointed at this blanket on the floor and was all excited because it was "a winner."  this dude on the radio was calling out winning numbers and i was a second place winner.  i won a trip to anywhere in the US for 3 days and 4 nights.  i was so excited.  i told v i would take her and i couldn't decide where to go.  last night i dreamed that i was in a train with a bunch of friends and this couple i don't know, but supposedly knew in the dream.  they were getting married and we were on our way to where the wedding was being held.  the train was huge and felt more like a hotel room than a train car...and the bride to be had a huge shoe collection and one pair of bright red strappy shoes she was convinced someone was going to steal.  she kept her eyes on us.  we were also on our way for her to pick up her wedding shoes; i guess she had a thing for shoes.  so i was in the couple's bathroom.  oh and for all of you that were waiting for me to have a sex dream, here comes the warped joy version: i come out of the bathroom and the groom shows me how to put on a condom. it's more a description than anything else.  he doesn't demonstrate on himself, from what i remember.  but the girl is in her bed and the guy is about to get in and i'm just hanging out like an idiot.  no one else is there, yet i'm hanging out.  i wasn't spying on them and they didn't ask me to to stay or go, i was just there.  i wake up in the same bed alone, like they disappeared.  maybe they were pissed at me for staying in their room like an idiot and left, i don't know.    i go into another room to give them their space and meet up with my cousin that has been in my dreams the past few nights, and some friends.  we are hanging out in this room that looks a lot like the living room my grandmother used to have.  we are watching tv while sitting on the floor and i end up talking to my cousin in the bathroom and the kitchen.  what a thrilling experience.

      i got the best parking spot last night, it was pretty close to the  main strip we were going to be hanging out at, it was on a crowded street, the parallel parking was perfect.  walked out to the car hours later and there was a damn parking ticket on it. :(  the no parking sign was all bent up and at the front of the street, blocked by a tree, etc. beaten by the man again!  so, i went to bed having to pee and i was wondering if everyone does that at some point, or if i am just truly lazy.  i was so tired and my bed looked so warm, i jumped in and had to pee all night.  in the first dream i remembered i was at this festival that was help at cap city (this bar i used to work) and the bar was morphed into my old church...it was a combination of buildings.  i had to pee (go figure) and was in line for the bathroom.  there were dividers and roped off sections of the line, just like at amusement parks, which is a first for the bar...and when i got into the bathroom, it was so huge. the stalls had wooden doors and sides with blinds that could be opened, which was weird, and some of the stalls had 2 toilets in each...which grossed me out. at one point i was peeing and there were 4 ladies next to me in the same stall. they were all old and one of their heads was up over the divider in my stall, so i slapped her.  she got all pissed off and i told her her head shouldn't be in my stall. she said she wasn't watching me, it was crowded in her stall and i told her that i had an issue with people watching me pee.  then i went outside and my family was waiting in line for food.  my dad was wearing this courdoroy/velvet (i couldn't tell) striped suit. it was striped, but all one color...he looked like a pimp.  no one else was dressed up that i can remember. so my mom and dad got salmon sandwhiches (at a festival?!?) my mom took one bite and was grossed out, but didn't say anything to the fish-cookers...she kept eating it. aparently there was a contest going on at the end of the festival.  i had friends that kept coming up to me and hugging me and i was trying to show off for the guy that was announcing the singers on stage.  this one friend that hugged me (was hot) and he said someone stole the words to his song...so he was going to sing a recipe instead. i told him he was going to win! the chicken guy (the guy who was selling chicken sandwhiches) is the guy that stole the music, so my brother, sister, and i had nothing we wanted to eat.  we settled on hamburgers.  my cousin and aunt were serving them;  they have been in my last couple of dreams...  next dream:  i was raiding this school with two friends of mine. it was in the middle of no where and apparently one of the friends really wanted to go there.  we were running down a staircase, and all of a sudden, in the middle of two floors there was this piano set up, with glasses of wine, and food all over the landing.  this messed up our "running away" plan because we had to step over everything to avoid a huge noise and mess.  we made it, and ended up in a huge cafeteria.  i was trying to convince my friend that it was still a cool school...and then we are running out of it.  the school is in a huge field in the middle of no where and there is a dirt road perpendicular to it that goes on forever.  there is one more building that had a glass top floor.  the faculty were sitting around a huge table eating.  they were all dressed up and looked really evil.  this one lady that we knew, apparently, got up from the table and peered down at us.  then there was a fire or a tornado or something because it got all black outside and dark low clouds were everywhere and we ran the hell away from there.  it reminded me of "Return to Oz"  and then i woke up and peed.

      ok...so i have a lot to make up so i'll try to make it worthwhile...here's what i accomplished today: i got a bloody knee... i confirmed my brother is not gay... i got a new job...at an official dive bar...  before all that happened i had some whacked dreams...i haven't been able to sleep very well lately and wake up a bunch of times for the 3 hours before my alarm goes off...i finally fall asleep about a half hour before my alarm goes off...and end up "snoozing" and make it to work in time, but alas, don't blog the dreams before i forget them.  whacked dream: i was at church again...it was the psycho born again christian church i went to when growing up.  i was running into the church from the parking lot and couldn't figure out what sandals to wear.  they were really cute, and i had to choose between strappy red and strappy black sandals, but i didn't want to call attention to my toes, because the nails weren't painted...hmm...and i saw my mom, and some other family members that i know...and can't remember... i remember waking up a bunch and getting all pissed off, i was so fucking hot! and threw off the covers to wake up 20 minutes later all pissed off cause i couldn't find my blankets and i was cold...etc...etc and then my alarm went off. nice.

      so it's been awhile since i have posted...i have dreams still, by the way...i just have been forgetting them since it's either been hard for me to fall asleep, stay asleep, or wake up;  :) i have lost my touch. or i wake up and don't post right away and am screwed as i forget my dreams super fast... last night i had a bunch of dreams and slept really well, despite the fact that i kept resetting my alarm since i could go into work at 12:30, which was so awesome.  the dreams i remember had my family in them. in a bunch of them, one of my cousins was hanging  around my family and it was a weird situation because in real life she has turned into a real loser... but in the dream she was cool like she used to be...strange, but probably makes no sense to anyone outside of the family. moving on...i am still working at the dive bar...it still sucks. fun stuff that happened to me recently: *i met a convict in a bar after working last night (he just got out of prison) *he butted into my conversation in the same bar tonight, but i don't think he remembered me *my new guilty pleasure is tivoing my soap opera from the 5th grade.... *marlena keeps killing off characters that have been on or years!!! *my best friend has aweful taste in music :) unless you are wasted and deaf *ugly hick lesbians like Irish music  i think i am done with this post, i need to grab some sleep (hopefully) as i have 2 jobs tomorrow.  here's a weird, yet worthwile  urlLink link  to check out... hope this blog was worth the wait to anyone foolish enough to keep reading : )

      i want to burn down summers with all of its cheap squatting "guests" inside of it tomorrow. i'd seriously consider taking up smoking if it would mean i could ignite the place by dropping a match i just used to light my camel...or i'd become a camp counselor if i could roast a marshmellow over its burning massive waste of space.

      ahh there were a bunch of them again last night...but i don't have much time this morning, so i am going to be speedy.  i dreamed that i was living in a beach house.  at one point my old roommate was there and she just broke up with her boyfriend in real life, who was also in the dream.  they broke up in the dream as well, but were going out to dinner in the dream,  i remember running up to the house to get something and seeing the guy in the kitchen and i was freaking out about whether they were together or not (in my head, not showing it)  moving on, it was a really cool beach house with lots of cool stuff in it.  i remember lighting candles and stuff to make dinner. i lived alone, etc. it was neat.  then my mom, brother, and sister were in the dream.  my sister and i were trying to tan on the water.  she couldn't get tan no matter what she did, although she was super tan in the dream.  i, on the other hand, was all pasty and tan lined like i am in real life, but i was trying as well.  and all of a sudden i was swimming in the dream.  and then i was at my father's house, but the back yard was all water (as big as an ocean) and a friend of mine was in the dream and we were swimming away from some big, menacing men.  and then i was in an auditorium of some sort and it was like a lecture hall.  there was a class going on, but they were giving out free stuff and the audience was going crazy.  and my phone was ringing, but i couldn't find it and the ring was weird, so i didn't recognize it.  and then i was at a mall...i was on a break from work and went to get lunch...it was much cooler than the mall i am in now, and i remember i was talking to these little kids (middle school age)...i asked them how old i looked to them and they said i looked like i was in 12th grade. i was thinking, "bitch, i'm so old!  i work here! i can drink, you can't...etc." but i don't think i said anything.  there were a lot more, cause i kept waking up in the middle of the night, but most of them had my family in them and occured on the water by my awesome beach house...but i have to get ready for both jobs that i have today, fuckina...  so i am officially updated beyotches. happy now?

      i had my last training shift today at ella's...my first paid day of tending is tomorrow and i'm excited! but it's a long day, so i am warning everone i know that i'll probably be bitchy when i come home. so stay back beyotches.  the other night when i was training this dude asked the bartender bill for a to go cup. ??? is he a retard?  the dude wasn't even a friend of the bartender...if he new bill, maybe then he may give him one, which is totally illegal, but, that takes balls  AND  stupidity to ask that question, and it inspired this blog  Taboo bar practices: 1) Flirt with the bartender unless you are hot (why do old men and nasty/greasy guys think they can get away with it?) 2) Stalk bartenders (it's just not cool to bump into the same creepy person that is always just a little too interested) 3) Ask for to go containers (for anything, especially booze, we are not a quikee booze mart, suck it down buddy!!!) 4) Ash all over the place (use a fucking ashtray or don't smoke at all) 5) Tip in change (unless it's in addition to a bill of some denomination) 6) Ask for change to the penny (bartenders are too busy to give back 87 cents back in change...if they are cool, they will give you back a dollar, and then you leave it as a tip, cause they gave you extra money...if it's 12 cents change back...it's lost money, don't expect it) 7) harrassing customers (it's annoying and if you scare the girls, etc. they leave and then we have to deal with the creepy customers) 8) mooching bitches (think they can use their ts and as to get drinks, and make their way around the bar drinking for free) 9) calling bartenders "barkeep" or ceaselessly call out bartenders' actual names (i only like hearing my name in bed, beyotch) 10) hanging around until we kick you out after last call (if you aren't sleeping with the bartender, leave) 11) saying you'll leave a big tip...(usually impies you won't) 12) implying the drink is weak, or expecting a double for free (won't work unless i know you...otherwise i'll give you "the look" and tell you to buy a double) 13) being pretentious - "no, no, no!  a martini comes with vodka, a twist of lemon, AND an olive, on the rocks, with no vermouth" (WTF??? Sure buddy) 14) asking for condiments one at a time (i just ran my ass away from the bar and got the damn hamburger...NOW you want mayo??? ok here's the mayo. NOW you want another pickle???) 15) sitting at the bar for HOURS and ordering a soda...start paying rent  i think that's it. i liked the guy replies for the last one, i want to hear taboos on your end from the customer's perspective. what do WE do that piss you off? i want to know so i can keep it up =)

      why is it that it's possible to have a runny nose and a stuffed nose at the same time?  i have major drippage and i go to blow it and i am fucking stuffed and end up blowing out my ears and now i can't hear anything and feel like i'm stuck in a tunnel.  i took too much cold medicine/headache stuff today and my head never got better, but i got the groggy effects of too much medicine and had cotton mouth really bad the 2nd day on the bar job. that's really great...me coming up to customers asking if they are ok, while being all chalky.  i was forcing back images of "me, myself and irene" when jim carrey was at the cop shop all cottony.  i got hit on  by a big black metro man today.  i thought it'd be safe to talk to the metro guy and he ended up asking me where i was from, what my name was, etc. and gave me two passes to a night club in dc. apparently he moonlights as a bouncer. i hope this isn't the mystery man that i predicted i'd meet this week. if so i am so screwed...and not in a good way.  when i was all wasted with heine ho during the st. pats shamrock fest i came up with a list of questions i wanted to ask the boys that i never got around to, cause i have ADD and was wasted at the time....so i am going to post them on the blog and when the boys read them *if they spend more than 2 seconds on the site, that is* they should use the nifty comment button and answer...  1)  As a guy, when you are in a porta potty, do you pee in the plastic urinal sticking out of the wall, or do you go in the toilet?  2) Are their really newspapers on the wall in the bathrooms above the urinals in most guy's bathrooms?  Do you actually read the newspapers that are posted in the bathrooms?  there's probably more to come, but i just blew my nose and developed the annoying tunnel feeling and am giving up the blog.  The ADD has taken over.

      summers is still afloat. but not for long.  i had a ton of weird psycho dreams last night/this morning...so many that i shut my alarm off twice and overslept.  in one of them i had a kid with my freaky ex and the kid was asian...and she was the girl in the ADD PSA on television that says you need to be a healthy mom to have a healthy child...in the commercial the kid can't sing the itsy bitsy spider song because she is retarded (just stupid, but she looks retarded). the commercial implies that she is dumb because her mom didn't take care of herself during the pregnancy.  hmm...and if this is foreshadowing, i'm going to have some retard children.  after that enlightenment the dream continued that my ex and i were fighting to get custody of the kid.  his current girlfriend was there and they wanted to take her from me.  i left her in the car while fighting with them and we were fighting in my grandmother's house in wisconsin, which was weird.  when i went outside to get the kid, she was gone.  so not only is my kid retarded, but i lost her.  then i was on this trip with people i know in real life (from my past) but i couldn't place them.  we were walking all over campus and it was a setting that has been repeated in past dreams, which was weird.  we were sort of on a relay and i was so close to getting to the "winning" position, but i have a weird feeling i didn't make it.  and then i had one of the sooooo horrible dreams that i was bartending and couldn't make the drinks fast enough.  ones where i wake up in a sweat thinking, "did i give that guy silverware???  shit, i forgot to give him mustard....does she need another Miller Lite???"  I HATE MY JOB.  i honestly think i am going to quit tomorrow, which is horrible considering i've only worked there about 3 weeks.  i don't ever want to be in that place again.  i spit on you, summers!!!  i'd write more about my dreams, but i can't remember them. i had a bunch, but they were lost in today's episodes of excitement and i'm frankly surprised that i remember as much as i did, and with that i am going to bed in hopes that i have sweet dreams of torching the hell hole i call summers.

      BLOODY KNEES   does anyone else have problems co-existing with gravity?  i find that i am in a constant battle against the forces that be.  i am forcing my body to stand perpendicular to the ground at all times and i lost this evening.  not only do i fight the urge to fall, but drinks just make me a sloppy looser.  well tonight i was walking down the street, minding my own business and i missed the side walk and bit it.  i happened to be walking with my sister (WOOHOO, i am so excited she is visiting!) and she busted out laughing.  i didn't completely bite it. actually i didn't fall at all. my knee slipped.  my knee is the only thing that hit the pavement...so...is that technically a fall?  hmmm. so i proceeded to hobble to the restaurant where i went upstairs to the bathroom and tried to wipe off my bloody knee.  i felt like a little kid.  my sister is 6 years younger than me and asked old ladies for a bandaid (FOR ME).  there is something wrong in this picture.  the whole fucking knee is bloody, and looks horrid, and i get handed the smallest bandaid in the world.  it was sweet she got it; i wonder what the old lady that gave it to her was thinking.  it was the size of the bandaid that nelly always wears on the side of his face.  so i didn't put it on.  i could feel the blood dripping down my leg as we walked around the restaurant. and then my jeans stuck to the blood hole during dinner.  fun stuff. i just got done cleaning it by the way. my knees are permanently scarred from all the falls i randomly take.  and now you all know about my struggle with standing upright.    ha. another funny thing that happened. my sister has more money than i do. :) we had an awesome dinner and everything tasted great and she proceeded to come home and puke. :) fun stuff. i'm now going to take my bloody knees and go to bed.

      does anyone else have weird runins in public bathrooms?  i have had more weird experiences than i care to repeat...most friends have heard the "joy got creeped out in the bathroom today" stories i have, but here's a new one: i was in the public bathroom in the mall the other day and the cleaning people were out in the hall...so i figured it was cool if i peed.  i went inside the bathrooms and a lady was just finishing cleaning all the toilets...so i pick a stall and start doing my thing when all of a sudden one of the people from outside comes in and starts mopping.  this mop comes at me from all different angles while i'm sitting on the toilet. it's a little bit unnerving.  i couldn't perform in such a stressful situation.  i freaked out.  i thought the cleaning person would get the hint that i was trying to go when they saw my FEET, but no.....they continued to mop.  i held my jaw open in disbelief and tried to be fast.  as i reached for the tp i noticed that the tp holder is connected to the other stall and you could see through to the next stall because the divider was broken....there were 2 huge windows for the cleaning person to peep on me!!! this further increased my freaked attitude and i hurried up and hauled ass out of there.   my other not so pleasant bathroom moment was at one of my favorite bars. i just finished up lunch with some co-workers and went to use the head.  as i was finishing up i saw what appeared to be a duster that moved quickly from the bottom of my stall to the next stall.  i freaked out, cause it was freakily quiet in the bathroom and what the hell was that??? who dusts in bathroom stalls? i got out of my stall and saw the other door was closed and there were no feet.  i yelled, "what the fuck are you doing?" and there was no answer. then all of a sudden i hear, "i'm fixing toilet..." then a bunch of slams, bangs, etc.  the asshole was SPYING on me.  eew. i am freaked out. so i am waiting for him to get out of the stall...he doesn't come out and isn't moving.  i then decide it's probably not a good idea for me to be in the bathroom alone when he gets out, so i leave the bathroom and wait for him in the hallway and tell my friend what happened.  she gets all embarrased for me, but doesn't look like she believes me when all of a sudden, this mangy old busboy dude comes out with a bright red face mumbling something about cleaning the toilet....WHAT?  if anyone is cleaning/fixing a public restroom they leave the main door open, leave the stall door open, put up a sign, SOMETHING....when he was just spying on me, what a douchebag.  i have too many weird bathroom stories. i check the shower to see if anyone is in my bathroom when i am peeing.  i now have an exceptional case of BOCD *bathroom obsessive compulisve disorder* which makes me take longer in bathrooms of all types because i have to make sure no one is spying on me.

      so. i think i am drunk. but i am not sure as i haven't drank what i am capable of and don't want to pussy out and say that i am falling back...  with that said...i think a girl may have hit on me tonight. but to be honest i am so rusty, i could have imagined it. however, the guys heard her and aparently she has a really good sense of smell...  i gave myself a manicure and pedicure tonight!  i kick ass. i have the cleanest feet in the world!!!!  i feel like an asshole though, cause i wanted to wear something other than jeans tonight and wore a skirt...but had to put a bandaid over my "i fall down a lot" knee.  it seemed to work out well, except for the fact that the skirt brought out a lesbian and no men.... =)   but i came home in one piece and one of my favorite songs is on (Elton John - I guess that's why they call it the blues)  it brings me back to a memory of my father. and to be honest...it's one of the only nice memories i have of my dad.  we were driving in a car together...and he was picking raspberries because he makes homemade jelly and gives it away to friends and stuff...and we pull over to the side of the road and he gets some roadside raspberries off of a HUGE bush and this song is playing in the car. and that' s a memory about my dad. and no matter what i feel about the actual song, i have to listen to it all the way through when it's on,  so all is well  sounds weird i know...but you all know where i am from.  i am off to dream of hot guys and clean knees.

      after talking to my best friend, i have revised the order of my hate list:  Sine Bob at Subway Clydes Carpool Coyote Ugly   the list will be updated as people/places/things piss me off.  until then, here are the mind boggling things that happened to me today:  i got a dollar raise...  i made about $5 when it's all said and done with my taxes...and i am SOOOOO happy i don't owe money....phew!  i took my first shit at the office today. i normally run far far away where hopefully no one with notice me...i used 4 different sprays afterwards to mask my scent. i hope it worked.  i made some awesome margaritas tonight and got trashed on 2 of them...so did heine. i used cuervo, fresh lime, lime juice, sour mix, and half of a real orange.  mmmmm good.  you know the story that you should never go to the grocery store hungry because you'll end up buying lots of unhealthy stuff to eat?  well...what about when you really want to drink?  i came home with coke, sprite, oj, limes, lemon, lime juice, and sour mix.   i have half the mixers i need for a full bar...

      things i learned this weekend at ella's  *i have been putting napkins in their holders wrong!!!! oh no, what have people been thinking of me whenever they reach over to grasp hold onto this little 4x4 inch, 4 ply piece of perfection?  i was restocking beer for my $3 an hour job when the manager calls me over to the other side of the bar and tells me i put the napkins in wrong.  i am SO glad he didn't fire me.  *i put too many stir sticks in the caddies. we need more big straws.  (and fyi, did you ever think about how many hands touch an unwrapped straw???)   the only cool thing about "being put in my place" by the manager is that he literally blew coffee through his nose and mouth when trying to do a wine tasting in front of us and the entire bar.  i was smiling from ear to ear on the inside. after drenching the whole bar in coffee he proceeds to look at me and one of the servers and ask what WE did to his coffee.   i think i am going to quit soon...i hate being told what to do...especially if i am not making any money and it comes down to paper products.  this is becoming a bad habit of mine.  i either bring bad luck to all forms of employment i take on or i only land shitty jobs...i am so glad i went to college.  with that said i am going to head out to school and talk to a career counselor...oooh what fun.

      so...i kinda feel like the joy of all trades lately. in the past week, i've bartended, been a sales bitch, been a sales rep, a member of the paparazzi, and a beer-giver-outer at a "posh" grocery store.  with all of these jobs, you'd think i'd have a bunch of lovely blogworthy stories...but alas, i lead a boring life.  there are a lot of snobby bastards that shop at whole foods.  this one old asshole had the gall to ask for beer, etc. so i poured a sample and was nice, even though i would get paid to be an ass right back.  and after asking what he thought 2 different ways, he walked away and was like, hmmmph.  FUCK YOU, buddy, i brewed it myself. i hope all the germs from my fingers got all over your tiny plastic solo cup and into your nasty, decrepid body.  see guys?  you don't need to hear my bitter stories of nothingness....not all that important.   one guy, the manager that helped me set up, was cool.  he cracked open a porter for his friend to sample and put it in my bucket o' ice and we sampled it.  it was damn good.  so i spent 3 hours watching people walk around the store eating samples and eating food as they shopped, it was like a friggen buffet...and i drank beer in my little plastic solo cup watchin the masses horde around the salad bar.  there are A LOT of employees at that store.  the dude that helped me was cool.  he got hit by a car the day before and wrecked his $4000.00 road bike.  :(  he had a fake front tooth.  i can't believe a bitch took him out on his bike!  i hope he doesn't get screwed by the system: he was going 30 miles an hour when he got hit!  he worked with a snobby 40+ year old blond soccer mom whore that thought she was the cat's meow.  she walked around asking people if they needed anything, and they gave her the look (leave ME ALONE) unless they didn't know anything about wine.  people ask some stupid questions..."i was at this restaurant the other night....and really liked the wine...."  um...and? did ya get the name on the BOTTLE?  i had so many people ask me where stuff was. and i actually helped em out, when i only set foot in the store 3 times before.  maybe i'm grocery store material. so, the cyclist/manager/porter drinker gave me chex mix and kept the open beer stashed (so he could drink it, i suspect) and he kept talking about the annoying soccer mom perfectionist being a bitch.  there was another lady giving away booze (but she got the wine!!! if only i was so lucky) and she said under her breath to the manager dude that she wished the soccer mom took a nasty fall in the parking lot with her face. :)  and the wine lady was the same age...i can't wait to grow up and be just like her.  what else....i am supposed to be doing work for on tap. but i am sick of that place. i drove around for hours today and yesterday taking pictures of patios full of happy people drinking/eating...while i drove around with my heart in my throat thinking i'd get a ticket at some point in the day, or that my car would get jacked while i left it open, running, with my stuff in it, as i took pictures...:) i got yelled at by an old mary in dc.  i didn't notice him at all until i was done taking pictures of the bar and he actually got out of his seat, came running up to my car and told me i had to stop taking pictures of customers.  um. ok. i have no loyalties to you. i thought he was going to take the stupid camera.  he was like, "what's your name?" and i was all, "i'm not telling you!" and he was all, "i've got your tags!" and i was all, "so?"  i hope he's not connected to the dc gay mafia.  and i looked at the pictures later and he's in 2 of them waving his arm at me all pissed off...heh. i hope one of those gets in the next issue.  so...heard any good michael jackson jokes lately?  knock, knock. who's there? little boy blue. little boy blue who? michael jackson.  that's my favorite...but here's some more q: what do michael jackson and santa have in common? a: they both leave little boys' rooms with empty sacks.  wait a minute...interuption. i am watching days of our lives...and it makes no sense. i think half of the people that are fucking...are related in some way. i need to get a book to see if there's a family tree somewhere. it's too complicated.  hahaha. the new burger at McDonald's is called the McJackson.  It consists of matured beef between two fresh white buns.  how can you tell if michael jackson has company?   there's a big wheel parked outside his house.  what's the difference between michael jackson and casper? one is pale and scares kids and the other is a friendly ghost.

      ahhhh. so i woke up a bunch of times in a panic that i was late for something.  and i woke up an hour before my alarm was going to go off and set it....phew! and then i turned it off when it actually went off and woke up late. and now i'm blogging, so i will really be late.  but i am rationalizing it because i stayed like 3 hours late at work yesterday.  and called and got "permission" from my teacher to stay home from school today a little longer than usual.  so i am still in bed. :)  so i had a lot of whack dreams last night.  in one i was trying to shower and this dude i worked with was showering in another bathroom and the water kept changing, and the shower SUCKED.  and the door to the bathroom kept opening a little bit and i kept reaching my arm out to close it, but it wouldn't latch or lock and kept opening.  and the water kept turning off. i think i started the shower like 8 times.  and there were buckets and travel kits and boxes all filled with shower stuff and i couldn't figure out what shampoo or soap i wanted to use. it was a stressful showering experience.  and then i was outside going through a huge box filled with little boxes that were supposed to get sent out somewhere.  there were more on the side of the house.  the mail man was leaving and i was freaking out, cause i didn't know if anything in the huge box outside was meant to go via mail or ups.  turns out everything in the huge box said ups on it in HUGE letters.  even the big box had ups on it.  so...after i figured that out, it was ok.  the stuff in the box was from some dead relative i had never meant (who had just died).  she was an aunt from my step dad's side in the dream.  all of a sudden neighbors and people walking down the street kept coming up talking to me. and then i was in the passenger side of a car counting money. i had my money in little wads everywhere and was putting it in order and this weird guy, who was supposed to be my roommate was all of a sudden in the back seat of the car, and i whipped around really quick cause he freaked me out and the piles of money got all messed up.  where did he come from?!?!?  he was just walking down the street in a group of people. wtf?  and as soon as he was there, he was off into the house and i was left with my money, but i  swear  it wasn't as much as before.    and in part of the dream, before i went outside to get the boxes of crap figured out, i was going through pictures of my dog.  in one, the dog was all cuddled up with my gerbil.  (which in real life is a helluva lot smaller than a dog) granted, the dog was a puppy in the pictures, but still. it was weird.    i had some more, but i think that's it for today, i am going to go shower and battle all the assholes on the beltway just so i can go to one of 4 locations (super small bank) to drop off the  massive  amount of money i've been making from on tap.

      How is it possible to feel hungry and have your stomach growl constantly and then all of a sudden upchuck the 4 beers you had the night before?  I don't get it. AND I've been up randomly for like 3 hours.  I showered...called in after and told Ella's I had food poisoning...and got out of the shift. Went back to bed and got 2 phone calls from people that actually called to talk to me. Damnit. So after geting off the phone with my Mom I had the incredible urge to ralph.  But I'm not a puker by nature, and found it weird since my stomach was growling at the same time. But the smart girl I am, I got up and went to the bathroom and exploded my Coronas into the flusher. EEEEEWWWWWW. I don't want to drink Corona ANYTIME soon.  I guess I learned my lesson on that one. And my stomach is still growling.  What gives?

      So....I think I just quit Ella's...I woke up late (after turning off my alarm twice) and freaked out and jumped in the shower anyway cause I hate going through the whole day all smelly and gross.  I jumped out of the shower and had ten minutes to get my shit together and haul ass to the metro and realized it just wasn't worth it.  I am killing myself for  20-30 bucks. So I grabbed the phone and called work all ready to leave a sniveling "I'm sick!!!" message since it's so fucking early.  No dice.  The owner picks up the phone and I make up something about picking up food poisoning late last night and went to the hospital (!) and they couldn't do anything about it and that I was going to have to stay home today.  His response you ask?   "OKIE DOKIE"   Um. Okay. So I am back in bed, smelling good and ready for some more zzzzzz's. But now that I took the effort to post my good fortune, I'll probably not be able to sleep. This is an entirely fitting situation to be in as I dreamed that I quit as I was turning off my stupid alarm twice this morning. I told this girl I work with that I was quitting.  She was all concerned and started freaking out about how it would suck if I quit.  We were hanging out in a high school, by the way.  I told her I wasn't making any money and it was a waste of my time and she said that it's a shame cause she liked me and could see me as  a manager there.  I was like, "DAMN straight. I kick ass. I could be a manager" But no thanks.  And this other girl I work with was in the high school with  me too. I was driving a sedan in the hallways.  I don't remember the rest, but it is making me really want to go back to sleep. I'm out

      I actually got some sleep. I am amazed, no alarm...buys you about 4 extra hours!  And man, were my dreams psychotic.  I think about everyone I know were in them, for starters.  And they were soooooo random.  I can try to piece them together, but it's going to be a weird ride.  In one of them I was hanging out with my mom, dad, and I assume my brothers and sister.  We were at a college campus for something and there were students everywhere.  At one point we were in a music hall practice room thing and people were playing instuments.  We just took some seats around the performers and watched and gabbed like we owned the place. It was weird.  And I took off and was walking all around the campus...segue to another weird dream. I'm hanging out with my crazy Grandma on my dad's side.  She is a bitter, funny old lady and we are walking to this car right.  She has her hands completely full and has trouble moving around anyway, so the load is holding her back.  She won't let me help her. I'm a little taken aback, are you thinking I am going to STEAL whatever crap you are holding?!?!?!?  Am I not good enough to help you??? I think I say this to her and she finally gives me a piece of paper or something to hold. WOOHOO. So, all the crap, my Grandma and I end up getting into the car somehow. And that's all I remember on that one.  Ok...what else. They are fading as I explain them, cause there are a LOT more.  In one scene I am hanging out with my ex. :( We are in a kitchen eating some weird wrapped chocolate.  We're waiting for something to happen too and the weather is insane outside.  Um...I feel like I'm leaving out a major one...not like it would affect anything.  So, then I dreamed I was at a zoo, and this pink elephant was chasing me. It kept spitting peanuts at me and I was like, "LOOK, will you STOP spitting peanuts at me, you ass?" And he was like..."ok" and moved on to someone else.  That one didn't happen. I made it up. You know you are getting old when you realize you slept too late and have to get up and get stuff done so you don't waste the day. :( I really don't like the feeling.  FYI, The Old Ebbitt hasn't called me...I am probably not wanted, but I fit in better with loosers anyway, so maybe the mag and Ella's are more appropriate. I'll update with the news, if it happens.

      I feel like so much has happened that I need to blog about...yet at the same time I feel like nothing notable needs to be published.  I have been SO tired lately.  Every time I have an extra 5 minutes, I want to sleep.  My eyes are fluttering shut at this very moment.  If I take my hands off the keys for 3 seconds, I find it very difficult to key my next thought.   I have yet to quit Ella's.  Even though I make little to no money when I work there.  I was tempted to say "work" there, like it's a joke that I lift a finger, yet, I work my ass off for the Italian wannabe pizza joint.   Just this past Saturday, I: came in early...who'd have thought I could do such a thing! I made Sangria, which consisted of bringing buckets and buckets of stuff from the back to the bar and measuring out rail booze, juice, and boxed wine.  OOOOOH what fun.  I then cut sangria fruit.  I proceeded to do inventory.  Then I restocked and cleaned the bar...ie reorganized it.  I then cleaned everything and began to add important information to the bar log.  Like a conversation between an honest to goodness stripper, pics from the City Paper.  This weekend it was a bunch of cicadas doing each other.  I am nodding off my side of the bed.  I will write more about my boss leaving Ella's, getting felt up by my "straight" boss, trying to get ghettofied, meeting up with a hick Cure follower at the 9:30 club, the rest is to follow when I wake up.

      So many dreams, so little time. I dreamed that I was bartending outdoors. There were two outdoor bars right next to each other and I was at one of them, which was much like the evil bar I used to work at...which will remain nameless, because if I named it, I would in a sense, be promoting it. So, I worked there, but was called to perform at the outdoor amphitheater, which was right next to the bar.  I had to sit in seat and bleed.  I was one of three people that did.  I don't remember any cuts, but the blood came from our knees and we sang at the same time. And in front of us was this huge waterfall.  No one could see us singing. It was obviously very strange.  When it was over I was trying to find my friends and stuff to hang out.  Everyone was very impressed I was part of the entertainment.  V was there and Blaine. V had to go early, she left her stuff in the seat she was sitting in.  Blaine was in  a hot tub with a lot of ladies...heh. Then I dreamed that I was in a culdesac with my father and brothers.  We were riding bikes and giving car washes.  I was fixing the neighbors' bikes, which were all messed up and this one guy ordered a pizza from us and paid in singles and change cause he said he was jobless and it's all he had.  I was fixing bikes at the time.  My brother and Father were playing basketball at the time and wanted me to do something I said no to, cause I was busy with the bikes and car wash, etc. Then I dreamed that my bike was getting fixed.  I walked into a bikeshop and was talking to people there and cleaning up the store even though I didn't work there and was watching this guy ride my bike down the street, fixing it and riding on cars with it, etc. And at one point I was on the bike, riding around a huge parking lot that was full of asshole people that were in my way.  I remember driving and yelling at this guy who had his kid with him, to walk on the fucking crosswalk.  He yelled back that he was, and I realized I was driving on the crosswalk. Heh... And then I was on the road on a really weird trip/race and it involved 2 semi trucks and a shitload of cars...but I don't remember much else about it.  And then I was interviewing (damn...I didn't write the interview story about the bartenders...and it's due today.) a bunch of different people that were supposedly artists.  I got confused because I had a list of people that all looked alike with weird names.  I got confused on one interview and called one huge black guy by the wrong name.  He corrected me and when I said my name he was like, "I don't want to know your name!!!"  So I said, "oh...I mean, my name is Julie" or something like that.  He said being in the industry was confusing and he didn't know what to do about his hair.  Should he grow a goatee/beard/or what? And what about his man boobs?  And he jiggled them. And he had a gay lisp. And he was supposedly a rapper. And I dreamed I was at my grandfather's house (he has alzeimers pretty bad right now in real life) and my grandma was there too (but they divorced a while ago in real life).  And my mom and dad were there. Well my mom gave me the phone and said my grandpa's girlfriend wanted to talk to me. Why? She has been calling and yelling at everyone apparently for being at his house.  She yelled at me and asked me why I was there.  I totally kicked her ass on the phone and yelled right back.  It was awesome.  And my grandma was all of a sudden my father's mom (a different lady) and she was sweeping the kitchen. I tried to help, but accidently bumped into her and she got all hurt and told me to find a liquid bandaid, when there was nothing wrong with her.  The cupboard on the bottom level was all full of bandaids, but none liquid. I felt soooo bad. And in one I was back at home and my dad and mom were there and I was in the driveway and my sister just left somewhere in her car...And I was watching after her and my cousin (who is my age, and got pregnant early and has a 6 or 7 year old kid now and is having another one this June in real life) was in the driveway with me, but I didn't know what to say to her. And that's all I can remember, but there were more, if you can believe it. I have to go shower and get ready to sell a Coffee man into our patio guide...hopefuly he'll bite.

      I am sick of working. I am not built for it.  I need to find a rich, HOT, man to take care of me.  Speaking of hot, there were a surprising number of cute men at cap city tonight.  They were probably all gay, with my luck, but I was surprised at the turn out.  This rant isn't going anywhere, by the way, I am still as single as I was when I left the house.   I am sick of the banner profiling via Blogger.  I love Blogger...but, c'mon!  At the top of my blog, it advertises for heart burn and flatulence deodorizer.  Just because I talked on two posts about me ralphing all over the place and having a stomach ache doesn't mean that I qualify for gas-prone banners. But it secretly makes me want to post about herpes and disabilities and alcoholism and gambling and random shit just to see what the banners will turn out to be.  So don't be surprised if I am telling a story and all of a sudden "POPCORN" sits in the middle of a perfectly normal sentence.  Or when talking about my lovely day I blurt out like terrets (which I know is spelled wrong...) "BICYCLES" or "VIAGRA" to see if the banner changes appropriately. I had a lot to post originally...but I am in bed and friggen tired. I could be sleeping and could talk to myself without typing. I think I'll give that a shot for awhile, if it doesn't work so well, I'll come back and talk to mysef with a keyboard as the middleman.

      So much has happened since I ralphed all day on Saturday...A little update on the puking thing.  I threw up all day on Saturday and came to the realization that while I had more than 4 beers...I probably had a good case of food poisoning from my ghetto mall food court.  No matter how happy I want to make the Bourbon Chicken ladies by giving them a paying customer, I will NOT eat the damn bourbon chicken ever, ever again.  It is evil stuff. So, Saturday night I did jack shit.  Sunday I got lots of stuff done!  The worst part of the day was Walmart...but we got a grill out of the experience.   David Bowie kicked ass. I was unbelievably happy to see him live; I never thought I'd actually get to say that I saw him in concert.  It was pretty amazing, although his newer stuff kinda put a lull in the energy.  It was all good, but man does Fairfax bring out an ecclectic crowd.  There were a shitload of honkies that came out of the woodwork for the show.  For a little while I thought I was at a Jimmy Buffet show, with the getup.   I finally returned the big ass patio chairs that were taking up space in our LIVING room, as opposed to the deck.  It took a lot outta me, "un-building" the only chair that actually fit together and loading my car with the mess. I got all these pathetic looks from shoppers as I took trip after trip of the pieces to the return desk (the box was demolished so I broke it down and brought the set in 2 pieces at a time...=)   Don't EVER buy patio furniture at Target!  I am thinking about adding them to my "hate list."  Not the store itself (that would be Walmart), but the patio furniture could be added.  We cleaned the stye tonight too.  Our veggies...at least I think that's whay they were...turned into liquid in the fridge.  There was bandit hair everywhere.  Something in the house (besides the garage) smelled and we had no clue what.  I predict that the clean place will last about 2 days.  Excluding the kitchen, which will go down hill as soon as the wheat meat comes out of its container. Maybe just like the talking and dancing poo in South Park comes to life and causes a ruckus, Jason's wheat meat comes to life in the kitchen.  It's dancing all over the counter and in the sink, and in the toaster oven.  "Ha Ha! Clean me up bitch!"   The new addition to the Jason diet is Naked Meat. I don't know what it's made of but it apparently tastes like turkey. mmmmmmmmm

      Omar's friend,  urlLink Mike,  is a liar and a shady individual that likes to IM me random stories.  He thinks he is funny and likes to slander my good and gracious image.  I am filling all of you in on what REALLY happened. So, I fly into New Orleans last weekend after my 2 double shifts at Ella's and before my 5 day work week at the magazine and I am fucking LOADED.  Through my drunk haze I see Mike, chilling in the airport with two bottles of beer! Sweet.  He is standing there jabbering about some jibber-jabber. I wasn't listening as I was concentrating on keeping my "Free wine as long as you fly with us" buzz going and all I could look at were the two bottles.  Mike said some crap about how I was going to get laid, and I was all, "OK. Just hand over the booze pal." And he was all, "OK. Drink up, cause I told all my friends you'd be, oh I mean, WE'D be at the corner of 7th and H St every hour from 8-4, so hurry up. And I was all, "Can I have a beer now, please?"  He kept talking and talking and I tried my best to ignore him, but it was damn hard with all the other weird people hanging out it sketchville.  We finally made it past all the weird airport freaks, including the Bible thumpers, security guards, and the Hare Krishnas that wouldn't take a slug of beer instead of money (the bastards!).  We got into his lump of a car and man was it hot.  It was so fricken hot, we could have been riding along in hell with the devil.  Luckily the beer helped a little.  And man was I thirsty, Mike stole my beer in the airport, what a tease!  Luckily he had a packed cooler full of the stuff. He had so many stuffed animals in his car I thought for sure he was either a girl or a fag, we finally made it to the corner.  I was up $1000 after the trip and don't remember much else...musta had fun.

      This whole night has been out of control.   Bandit peed right in front of me and I caught her in the act! I got pissed (hah) at her and yelled at her, etc. She ended up with pee on her so I had to give her a bath.  She was NOT happy about the bath, but I didn't want piss all over the house...After I finished washing her, not even 2 minutes after, she SHITS right in front of Jason and me. WTF.  What do I do in that situation?  Dogs don't understand if you put them in the corner.  I put her in the downstairs bath room. What a whore dog!  And this is in the middle of the "what's going on in our house?" moment when we were trying to figure out why our ceiling is leaking.  Oh boy, Oh boy. Peake is coming to fix the mess in the morning.  We'll see if they come before 10...So, in the end we took Bandit home to the Heine Ho and the car royaly smelled like shit.  I thought she did it again, ony this time in MY car...but if she shat, she hid it somewhere.   This goes out to Rich: So one day there was this persnickety, discombobulated, flibbertigibbit with a callipygian driving down the street causing a kerfuffle with a plethora of juxtaposed assholes in her beautiful Explorer (when all she wanted was pho)and then she she got fed up and defenestrated them.  Translation: This fussy bitch with a nice ass got pissed off cause she was stuck in a car with two loudmouths and the pho place was closed, so she threw them out the window of her toad-mobile.   I'm dead tired...going to bed now....to the smell of the 3 am broccoli that Jason just made...It's whafting up to my room! Ahhhh :(

      I woke up vaguely remembering my dreams, but here goes.  I was hanging out with my brother and sister and it was Christmas or something like that and we were waiting for our mom and dad to come home from some trip.  I was sitting in the living room of this weird ass apartment (it was small and modern and really futuristic) and were watching a really gay movie. It was the cheap kind that isn't even a B quality that you can probably buy for like 6 bucks....It was cheap. I kept making fun of him about his shitty taste in EVERYTHING.  He was wrapping presents and the movie we were watching was one of the gifts.  I was wearing a really ugly sweater, which was also one of the gifts.  I opened up one present that said it was for all of us and we heard a car in the driveway, we looked outside the little futuristic window and saw a huge monster truck thingie pull up.  It was Mom and Dad...weird. So we panic cause I am wearing the sweater, we are watching the movie, the other gifts are hanging out unwrapped, and I just tried to open one for the whole family. We scramble to get everything straightened out and I don't know if we made it or not, I just remember my Mom being pissed off cause someone was in our driveway outside.  Then I was driving around a weird ass city with my sister, Jenna. It was a weird city, like out of the last couple shitty Batman movies.  The city was huge, but small at the same time since the streets were all narrow and the buildings loomed over us.  There was NO parking anywhere, which really sucked.  I eventually started driving cars inside buildings and we got an awesome spot in a building that housed casinos and 5 ritzy hotels and we could see Ella's out the window...=( I can't escape my shitty jobs.    And then I was on a college campus, all the students were running around in a frenzy. I ran down one of our hills and it was a giant cake.  It had huge piles of white frosting with sprinkles and people were eating chunks out of the hill and stuff.  And they didn't find the cake until I started running down it. I was a cake-eating-hill trend setter.  My buddy Jimmy was there and he was all excited about the cake. I was too, but it was old, man. I remember the cake  being there LAST year.  Doesn't that shit go bad?  So I tried to just eat the frosting.  And then we got up and kept running around like idiots.  The end. I have to get ready for the wonderful world of On Tap.

      I love my family. Everything about coming home has been great.  Except for the showers. And the bed (which is fine, but I wake up in a panic cause I don't know where I am...). And the not having a car. But it's more than liveable. It's home!  Flying in was pretty funny. I know the landmarks of Milwaukee and as soon as you cross over from Lake Michigan, you are at the airport. Well, our pilot kept going. He kept going and going...and I saw fields and shit. I had NO clue where we were. We just crossed a huge span of water, it had to be Lake Michigan, so what IS the deal? I began to worry that I got on the wrong plane. I thought maybe the ticket said I was flying into a different airport...but WHAT airport? Then the plane did a 180 and we ended up back at the waterfront and the airport I actually know. We were ahead of schedule and he flew straight out and back again to the airport, as opposed to flying in circles over the airport. Phew!  Our dog Jake has transformed himself from a cute little hairball to a HUGE, ackward, adorable furball. His tail is like a fountain - it just spurts out hair. He still has the cute baby face, but he is so damn big. And goofy. Chip, my baby, is older. I love her to death and we all call her a pup, but she is getting slower, and quieter, and it's sad to see, but she is still in really good shape and great looking. My sister is the same from when she visited in DC, but she is a CRAZY driver. Good God, and you all thought I was bad...get beside her when she is behind the wheel...makes me want a drink, or change seats to the driver's side or the back, where  I can close my eyes. Doug is cool as ever. He wants to open a bar here and I told him if he did that I would move back here to help him out. We'll see. Donny is hilarious as ever. I don't know where he wound up so funny, as my father and stepmom never seemed all that cool and hip, like Doug and I are...go figure. =) His graduation was awesome. We yelled at him, and it was weird going to a town where everyone knows "Beattie" and the name is yelled frequently (and on good terms, not, "Kiss my ass, Beattie."  Although I am sure he gets that a lot too. I got sunburned sitting outside, which is good, as I am a pasty white girl. My grandma is still bitter as hell and fiesty. I saw a ton of people I haven't seen anywhere from 1-6 years and I have only been here 1.5 days. I feel like I got a lot accomplished even though I haven't really done anything. My mom and dad look great and are awesome. They have yet again converted the house, and it looks great. Mom got a treadmill and I almost keeled over on it the other night. I was goofing around with Jenna and she set the speed really high and I lost my sandal and almost fell off backwards into the closet, which has mirrors for doors. Boy did she feel bad after that! Damn sister...trying to kill me on my first night =) It felt like the National Lampoons go to graduation today as my crabby grandma, aunt, dad, and Lisa, were all freaking out about how/when we were going to get there, etc. I drove with my brothers in Donny's hoopdee and sat in the back while the boys both eyed all the tail in the SMALL ASS town of Oconomowoc. I learned a new sexual term from my brothers to my dismay, which I quickly forgot, but still have the lasting impression of Doug going, "You know, 2 in the pink, 1 in the stink."  I am still traumatized. Gross. I can handle a lot of stuff, but I swear I blushed hearing them talk about that. We ate dinner, watched my brother's football DVD - He got 8th in state! My family brags that he's the second fastest white kid in WI. When we gasp at the possible racist comment we just heard, we are given the, "What? It's a compliment. White kids can't jump. Or run." Oh-Kay.  Played pounce. My ass came in second. I was winning most of the way. Damnit. Went over to my Dad's neighbor's house to have a beer at someone's graduation party. They threatened to take him out by his ears if he didn't come. So we came over. No one knew who the fuck Doug and I were. My Dad was like, "These are my kids! From my first marriage." Donny introduced me as the sister that was not made up. I do exist. They all called Donny and my dad "Beattie" and were pretty damn funny, but it was weird watching them all co-exist in a world I totally didn't belong in. Regardless, it felt good to say I didn't live there and leave after drinking their beer.  Donny proceeded to tell dad that he was going to go drink some pepsi at the rest of the grad parties and that he was really good at drinking half barrels of pepsi, but it's tricky to do the head stands due to the carbonation. He denied my offer to prove his mad pepsi drinking skills by shotgunning a pepsi on the spot. The end of my long WI-updating ramblings. There will be more.

      My foot hurts so bad. I think I broke it. Or I fractured it. Is that the same thing? According to this website I went on, it is...and according to the site I have a broken toe. It turned all black and blue and 7 hours after it happened, it still fucking HURTS. I already had messed up feet to begin with, but now it's even uglier. And I can't walk without wincing/dragging my foot behind me like quassi moto (someone tell me how to spell that fucker's name please).  So...V and I went to go be flight attendants tonight. We went to an open conference interview process in Crystal City. The lobby was full of people who either looked the part, or was as far from it as possible. After being herded into the smallest conference room alive we all were given the run down on how much money we'd be making.   It's SHIT. It's so shitty, looking at my career at On Tap seems like an awesome opportunity. I think that all flight attendants MUST live at home with their parents. How the fuck can anyone afford to live off of roughly 15K a year?  According to the recruiters, flight attendants can only work a set amount of hours too, it's not like you could work a lot and get paid a ton. It's so shitty.  Well with that said, we stayed to hear them out and were informed that we'd have to come up in front of the audience and recruiters and read a short selection of "we get paid jack shit to man the plane" aka please read the safety bulletin located in the brochure in the seat pocket..blah blah blah..everyone in row 9 has to save the rest of the plane in case of emergency landing, blah blah blah. Some of the participants were really freaked out and SUCKED. We then had to tell everyone about a time when we had to deal with a disgrunted customer. Hmm. Do you REALLY want to know what I have said/done to people that have pissed me off? I told my old boss/friend that lives in Cali about it and he laughed without me telling him the rest and reminded me of my master plan to keep credit card numbers of people I hated so I can order mail order tvs and shit. (There's an idea for your flat screen, Rich) I totally forgot about that scheme! Retribution in the form of a credit card number/expiration date/mailing address. Why yes, I am John Asshole and I'd like that TV mailed to P.O. Box... So I let my mind wander during 6 presentations and racked my brain for inspiration as to a customer service issue that didn't end up with me hanging up the phone/glaring at the asshole that is wasting my time/bitch slapping the whining pricks...and came up with something they liked, cause my name was on the door after the break! Oh boy...I am finally good enough to be  considered  for the 6-8 week unpaid training in AZ. Thanks! While I'd like to rack up frequent flyer miles in the form of hotel stays...wink...or mile high miles with hot single men, the gig just hasn't sold me yet. But I WOULD like to find out if I pass the criminal background check they do. I'll find out in 2-3 weeks if my name on the door served a purpose. If it wasn't for the damn airline I would have two normal toes, btw.

      What kind of daughter stumbles into a 24 hour grocery store looking for a Father's Day card at 1 am, technically the day after Father's Day? Me. I suck. I am the lowest of the low. I "went out of my way" to go to this 24 hour grocery store, thinking they would have the cards left...cause hey! It's Sunday!   I wander aimlessly and finally find the card section. What the hell! There are no Father's Day cards. Um. Do I buy a blank card? No...they'll know something is up. And blank cards are always mushy on the cover, or suspiciously...well. Blank. Or how about a "missing you" card?  No. They were all tacky or romantic. One even had a missheveled bed on the cover. That won't work. Um. Ok. So I bought two shitty duck cards that were a combo of "Missing you" and "Thanks" and well, the ducks are supposed to be funny. My addition to the wonderful one liner is going to be, "HA! If this sorry loser can make money writing for Hallmark, or American Greeting, or whatever the fuck company they are writing for, then there's no WAY I should be unemployed. I could make MAD cash writing stupid cards! Love, Your twit of an semi-unemployed, lazy-assed, procrastinating, sot of a daughter."  I am going to send them soon. (But I have been thinking of both my dads all day and called them too, so I'm not all that bad).  I finally "quit" Ella's.  Events: I was pissed off all weekend, cause they are over staffing and I am walking away bitter and broker than I should be. I hand in my drawer to the manager on duty who has told me in the past 4 weeks (each time he sees me) that he will fix my schedule so I stay with the bar...etc. He'll do whatever it takes, give me night shifts, etc. In reality, nothing has changed obviously. I ask as I hand in my drawer, "So. If I were to hand in my notice, would you need something in writing, or can I just tell you that I am giving you my two weeks?" He's all like, "you can just tell me..." I'm all like, "Ok. I am giving my two weeks." Silence, he goes on working and shit like I didn't just open my mouth and say, "Ok. I am giving my two weeks." "I'll work out the next week's schedule for you, but you obviously don't need me to work the entire two weeks. There are people here that eagerly want to get behind the bar." No emotion other than the fake ass corporate attitude I've gotten for the past 4 weeks... "Yeah, there are." "Ok. So I will work for you next week and then I'm done." Then some bullshit about how it's nothing personal, but I'm not getting enough to pay my bills, etc. (Why can't I just stop when it's appropriate?) He winds up the session by acting like he always does. Does nothing phase him? How can he be so callous? They'll miss me! Oh, will they miss me. FUCKERS. So, I was like, "See you next week!" And I took off. So. It remains to be seen if I'll actually go in for the last week of my stay at Ella's. But I am  this  close to being done.

      So...just got back from a good show at the 9:30 club. Aimee Mann played and she did the Til Tuesday cover that I play over and over again when I have the track available. According to Heine Ho, it was easier for her to handle than David Bowie...!?! Um. It's better than all that Irish crap like Mary Black, dip! =) After which I was told I owe her a drink for insulting the Irish. I have a beef to pick with couples that feel the need to make out in front of everyone on the fucking planet. This for once, is not directed at O and S...rather at everyone else at the show tonight. Waiting in line I am confronted with O and S, along with a couple in front of us making out. As I'm watching the show this bitch starts stroking her man's head and neck in front of me. Hello? I am right here and you are 2 inches in front of me. And she hit my drink, while I was drinking from it, to PDA his ass. So I put my drink on her seat when she stood up and Heine took it from me. Damnit. And then there was this old couple directly in front of me making out (in front of the bitch giving head [rubs])which was totally inappropriate amongst all of us that wanted to keep our drinks in our livers and blood streams. At one point they leaned their heads together and blocked the whole damn stage. What's up with that? If you are going to make out, make it worthwhile and have sex in the bathroom, but let me see the show. The couple next to me/behind me is leaning against each other while the guy (next to me/behind me) is so close his breathing moves my hair and he touches my ass every 5 seconds. I got more action tonight than I've gotten in a long time, do people not get out much? Is it that much better to make out in front of everyone and their mothers? If so, I need to jump on that train. I hereby make a solemn promise to make everyone I know (and everyone else) SICK TO THEIR STOMACHS if I ever get a guy that will make out with me. We will do it everywhere. Church, banks, bars, gas stations, fucking concerts, EVERYWHERE. I will get even with everyone that has made me ill, or taken up my personal space with their kissy face antics. I promise.  With that said, I had a helluva time driving out to fucking Gaithersburg yesterday for the "awesome" job offer, that was, of course, to good to be true. 50-70K my ass. I got stuck on the Dulles Toll Road (not the local traffic side either...the "to the airport" side). I proceeded to drive the 20 minute commute to the fucking airport and passed about 8 cop U-turn areas that I had to go avoid because with my luck, I would have gotten pulled over. I was bitter. I got stuck on it because I was behind a huge bus that splattered rain and backwash on me while I was sandwiched into traffic. I missed the sign that told me I was an idiot and exiting onto the Dulles Toll Road. The detour took 40 minutes out of my commute and royally pissed me off. I then haul ass and follow my mapquest directions to be told to get off on exit 5A on 270 and drive 2.7 miles until 270N, which I should get on. Um...Didn't I just battle through traffic on 270N and get off for 5A? What the hell is going on? I get back on 270N. Whoever is in charge of Mapquest needs to fucking lay down the law on their bitches doing the directions. Are they fucking with us on purpose? I just drove around buttfucking Maryland and past the Booze-Allen golf course, toured the Greeneries and produce stands, for NOTHING. I finally get to where I need to be (exit 13A) and my destination ends up in an apartment complex. Who the hell sends a potential employee to an apartment complex without telling them, "Hey, when you get to 20000 Frederick Avenue, SUITE 32, it's really apartment 32 in the Oakwood apartment complex"? I drove past the complex twice, drove in parking lots in front of and behind the complex, double checked directions, and called the number to make sure I had the right place. Cornell (?!?) didn't pick up the phone, so I had to leave a message. I didn't know if I should have waited or what...he called back. Apparently he DOES run his 15 year old business in his house...ok...I figure I'll give him the benefit of the doubt...I just want to hear him out, but I know already with the commute and his crazy business/living situation I am out. I go in, it's bare, like serial killer bare. There's a dining room table full of mail and crap, there's a dark hallway, there's a computer desk with a computer and lots of crap on it. There's the little island/window ledge leading to his kitchen. On the ledge is a 1/3 bottle of WHITE ZINFINDEL. Who the fuck drinks that? And if you were an avid white zin drinker, it needs to be in the fridge. C'mon! That immediately took him down a couple notches, not to mention the fact that he locked the door when I came in. About 15 minutes later I decide, hey...this isn't the job for me. The reason? The commute. "If you don't want to drive in traffic you could come in around 7 (pm)"...um...but you just said you want someone here to answer the phones so you don't miss out on business. Who calls a business writer after 7pm? Sketchy. After the "interview" is over, I leave and he says he'll call me in about a week after he talks to other candidates. Sure, buddy. And I will eagerly jump at the offer to work out of your shady pad. Fuck off. Anyone out there with a valid job offer? Please share. I need all the help I can get, or I should keep going to the crap offers and write a book about how shitty the job offers/market is. Maybe that'll please my parents. (I told my dad about the shady place and his first response was that the guy was using his "business" as a drug front.) =) And I thought he was just trying to lure women to his place! Fear not, father, I will not become a drug mule unless I get the money up front.  Update: I'm giving my notice to Ella's tomorrow. Yay.

      So I decided to be useful this afternoon and de-weed our "back yard." Oh what fun, but I have my mind made up that I am on a mission. I head downstairs to go out through the back door to find that our careful to the point of paranoid roommate (Jason) has quadruple-locked the door and literally thrown away the key. The ONLY key to open the back door. Now I don't know if he literally threw it away, but it's dead bolted, bar locked on the top and bottom, and locked on the knob itself. Hmmmm. I never got the key to the deadbolt. So...I decide to walk around the house to do my dirty work.  I cross land minds of weeds and grass clumps and spiderwebs and start mowing my way through with the hedge clippers. i got like 3 inches and desided my efforts were futile. Then I started doing a sweeping motion with the clippers like a machete, while teetering on the planter wood thingie and almost cut off my toe. I was wearing sandals, which Omar would later shake his head at and say I should never do any kind of labor with bare toes. To which I think, pish posh, I like being bare toed. So...with the narrow escape on the toe front, I decide, "Fuck it, I am buying a weed wacker." So, I decide to cut the dead vine hanging on our fence, and am kinda walking around with a huge set of clippers looking all weird and kind of shady as I am walking around the common area of our back yards, as opposed to walking INTO my fucking house like a normal person. I decide that I'll cut off a part of the neighbor's vine that is growing on the outside of his fence (The house is vacant and totally a jungle, ours is shameful beside it.) and grow roots on it and plant it somewhere. Well I freak out cause the part I cut had a bug on it and I think I semi-screamed like a little bitch and saw something move in the next yard over. Someone was WATCHING me through the cracks. That really made me freak out and I tried to run away, but tripped on a root and semi-falled, semi-gimped AROUND my house with the clippers in one hand, and half a branch in the other. Fucking nosy neighbors.

      Who would have thought quitting would be so hard? Yesterday was my final shift at Ella's and it was a great feeling. Yet I was secretly disappointed that no one cried about me leaving. No one begged me to stay. But everyone had questions and I owed it to myself to give everyone a better answer than the truth. While it's great that I am taking a management position, the title kinda seems like a let down. California Tortilla. I even fucked up the first time around and called it California Burrito. To save face when I was called out on the name, I replied that the owners were thinking of "trying something new in VA"...a little play on words, if you will. But between you and me, I think they will decide to keep the name the way it is. There is such a nice ring to California Tortilla...No need to mess it up by throwing the word Burrito in there. Friday was the day to be me. I enjoyed letting my boss know I wouldn't stay past the week. That was fun, although it would have been nicer if she fucking looked me in the eye. While some people think it may be a compliment for another woman to stare only at your chest, I feel violated. Completely violated. I feel like I am back at the hell hole bar with the mullet-warrior manager sizing me up whenever I stepped in the closet-office to get yelled at. And instead of thinking, "man...I must have a nice rack..." I am instead wondering what the fuck is wrong with them? Is one sticking out further than the other? Is she trying to figure out if they are both pierced? She seems to favor my left breast...why is that? WTF, is there something wrong with the bra? My shirt? What is the deal? I should have said something to her, it would have been a nice finale. Oh, and by the way, weeble, I have TWO eyes and they are situated in my fucking head above by chest. Weebly Wobbly putz. Go get your daddy to pay to get your eyes fixed.  I went out like a true champ today. I am ditching my "Welcome on board as a sales rep" lunch where all of our new territories are divied up and am selling instead. I think I'll run up to the office while everyone is out so I can avoid seeing everyone. I talked to my other boss who is upset I am leaving and made a point to tell me that I could have made things better by talking to her before I made my decision. Well...what can I say, some people were just bread to make tacos. The beans and rice have been calling out my name and I can no longer ignore the "OY!" that will fit right in at the burrito stand.  With that said, I am going to get ready to sneak into my office for the last week of cubicle worthy work. Next time you all see me I will be reaking of pico de gallo and bring home guac. Cheers.

      I am starting to hate chicken...and beef...and rice...and fucking beans...and jalepenos...and onions...and salsa. Fuckin-A. Mexican food used to be one of my favorite foods ever. Dude...I feel like a burrito. Not any more. I hate em. I don't ever want to look at sour cream, tortillas, or taco beef again. And this is my first week. Good God, what am I going to do? Working alongside food all day truly makes you not care about it. A steak doesn't look good when you have to cut up about 50 pounds of it and cook it all. And visualize your fingers getting chopped in the process. Rice doesn't have the same appeal when you make a vat of it that is half your size. This could be a great diet. Want to learn how to hate food? Fucking work in the kitchen of a restaurant. It's just a matter of time before you look at all of your favorite foods with a painful grimace.  Today I got to work the grill. I fucked up on some of the meat, but successfuly came home with ten fingers. I spilled a shitload of oil all over the back of the kitchen (ha) and cut open like 3 huge bags of veggies (only needed one) and started mixing chopped veggies instead of shredded fajita veggies (OOPS). I felt bad at first and then was like, what the hell. Not my money, I'm not getting paid by the hour, so fuck it. Yesterday I drove one of the managers to the hospital after he sliced through his finger (to the bone). Keep in mind that this is the same guy that always jumps to my aide whenever I look like I am fucking up on anything. And to him, I am fucking up with EVERYTHING. It was dark humor-odd that he'd be the guy to dice too far and I was so sick to my stomach watching his finger bleed. I think I'd be the one to pass out if anyone hurt themselves on my watch. Anyway...I drove the dude to the hospital, he got all fixed up, and is still trying to help me in everything I do, despite his huge finger cast and bandages. I feel like I am an adult now, with a shitty work schedule as I get up at 6 and work all day until 6. But then I feel like a fucking reject for the fact that I am in a restaurant. And a half assed one at that, due to the semi-fast/semi-sit down existance.  Every once in a blue moon I see a hot guy walk in...not going to meet anyone cool working at the burrito shack.  My future flame's friend: "Who's that swell girl you've met that you are going out with next week?"  Flame: "Oh...she's so cool! I met her at the Burrito Burrow. She works there every day. I guess the jeans and Tortilla hat are what really did it for me. That and she smells like my favorite food! I was smitten." I am so screwed. It's kinda hard to smile at the hot guy next to you when driving home, when you are covered in sour cream and wearing a black Taco hat. I think I am going to pretend that I don't know English during my stint in the back of the house for my training. It works for all the Mexicans, they TOTALLY know what I'm talking about, but they act like I am a bumbling idiot. Even when I say, "Me GUSTA frijoles y quessssssoooooo." They look at me all funny. Fuckers know what I'm talking about. Whenever I pop out of the back it is quite odd to see who comes in to eat. And they always give me looks of pity. I wonder what they are thinking.  Taco Eater: "Wow...look at that, a 20+ white girl scrubbing dishes and scooping out beans and rice...what is she doing back there?" Burrito Eater: "I wonder if she has a criminal? Can't speak English? Can't read? Failed out of school? Has a crack problem?" I don't really know how long this is going to pan out, but I can pretend that I am 15 and hope for the best. If I get a shitload of acne like all the stereotypical meat flippers then I am high tailing it out of there. ahahhaha. I am watching a weird movie, Die Mommy Die!  This dude just told his mom that he was kicked out of school for starting a homosexual orgy...etc. The mom (guy in drag) is like..."Be honest. I'll be there for you 100% of the way...Are you a cocksucker?"  =)

      Day 2 in taco heaven, I smell like burritos already and in the 2 days I've worked I leave covered in EVERY thing that I touched in the kitchen. Sour cream and salsa both seeped into my shoes and I had my first fajita nightmare the other night. Well, by night I mean during the three hours of sleep I got from 2:30-5:30am this morning.  With that said, I semi-like being in the kitchen instead of the front of the house. However, I also like feeling my fingers and having the piece of mind that I will always have ten. (Sidenote - I am watching this movie, Wonderland, and despite a lot of criticism, the soundtrack is awesome.) It's painfully obvious that I never worked in a kitchen before, from hosing myself while washing dishes, to spilling everything I hold. I almost wiped out carrying two huge buckets of some dressing-esque stuff that I spent about 30 minutes making and 40 minutes cleaning up. (The floor was slippery and I am a klutz). I caught myself, but all I can visualize when walking in the kitchen is my ass on the ground in an embarrasing attempt to walk. With that aside, I have like 4 people telling me what to do, or mostly, what I'm doing wrong. Rightly so in some aspects, as I look like I just had my first encounter with a knife, even though I bonded with it for the 10 hours I worked yesterday. Apparently I have been cutting wrong all my life and people were scared that I was going to cut something off. Eh. So I've picked up some skills since my wobbly knife show. I NOW know how to cut 8 quarts of jalepeno peppers, onions, garlic, etc. I now know what a tomato corer looks like. I know how to make salsa for an army. (Today I made enough to fit in a container bigger than a full keg.) I did a whole lot more, but I will refrain from boring with details. I have come to the conclusion that my new place of employment borders between fast food and a sit down restaurant. Hmmmm. Great. Everyone seems cool, but I have a beef with the second crew of kitchen ladies. They don't seem to like me very much, but I can't tell what they really think, because they talk so damn fast and my Spanish skills are about as good as my chopping abilities. But I DID grasp the fact that they thought it was funny I was in the kitchen with them, and my goofy Spanglish wasn't helping. Eh, the morning crew are cool enough.  And there it is. I am now a fiend in the kitchen and the sky is the limit.

      One of my biggest pet peeves is being told to smile. I wish I had a gun (and a bullet) for everyone that fucking told me to smile. It blows. If I feel the urge to crack a wide grin I do it, I don't hold back and wait for someone to remind me. This ass at work keeps telling me to smile and asking me why I don't smile and I have been blowing him off, but today I had it. I cracked and finally gave up with the smart answers, "I'm smiling on the inside," "I am missing that muscle in my fucking face," "I had a stroke and now have a perma-frown." Instead, I told him to fuck off...:) That put a smile on my face. Assholes.  For all of you that have the itch to learn how to bartend, but don't want to fork out the money for a retard class and don't want to get a job slinging the booze,  urlLink  this   is worth checking out.  I thought this dude was hot that came in today, I have seen him in before. He is a tall white dude with scruff that is always wearing scrubs and comes in with a bunch of older ladies (co-workers). I think he works at the hospital down the street. I was talking with the ladies behind the line about how hot he was and one of the chicks, Mucha, (hah) said he is really nice, and comes in every day (this however, kind of makes him a looser, but then again HE doesn't work there. He works at a hospital and I am going to pretend he does something really great there...like surgery or something.  HOLY SHIT...Days of our Lives is getting intense!  Bo Brady is gonna DIE. So cool...he's been turning into a really pompous asshole.  Ok, back to the hot guy. So we were all watching him eat his taco salad and he came over to the line and one of girls started talking him up. She asked if he had a girlfriend and he sighed and said there was a long story behind that one, but that he's single (OOOOH baggage), she didn't want to pry, so she pointed at me and said that someone here has a crush on him... *oooooh* and HE said, "Well, then I guess I'm going to have to start going to her store!" And I was all, "kkkheeeeheee heee." But we never talked....We'll see, if he truly loves me, he'll make the commute. He can stuff my burrito any day.

      I am realllly getting sick of driving. I drive every day. And not only do I drive every day, but I drive about 70 miles every day to butt fucking OLNEY, MD and back. I am really starting to hate Maryland. At least I am not training in the ghetto, but good lord, this commute is turning me into an evil and bitter person. And I find that I am SCREWED either way. If I take the map quest directions to 270, I hit traffic. If I take Conneticut all the way to 495, I hit traffic. If I merge onto 495 at 10pm, they are doing construction, and if it's at 6pm, there's plain old traffic. When I finally get onto the GW parkway or drive through DC to avoid the mess, I get behind idiots that go under the speed limit, or don't know where the fuck they are. When the clouds open and I see a little bit of sun shining on Rt. 50, I get a speeding ticket. And this is after driving 29/30 of the way. I am such a fucking idiot as to speed during my final stretch home.  This is my life. So I am now a bitter driver that is lazy and doesn't go out once I step foot inside my door.   With that said, I am *this* close to doing management stuff. Officially, that is. I think i am going to quit after a few months of the opening (gag), unless they severely cut my hours, or give me a big raise. I am a dipshit to take an offer while assuming my hours will be normal.   And I have discovered this job has made me lazy. If I have to cook anything I freak out, as I am around food all day and just want to avoid it. I hate doing laundry, although I try to do my clothes as soon as I get home so they don't permanently smell like the Mexican sweat hut. But this hampers on me doing any other kind of laundry. I have a load of whites up to the ceiling and therefore have no clean towels. I have been finishing up my showers with a hand towel the last three days. What are the odds that I am wiping my face with the same part I just used to wipe my ass?   So this is where the new job has come to. Not only do I have no life, but I am still broke. I guess God is trying to tell me that I am not cut out for a job and someone is just going to have to start paying me.   &nbsp;

      Oh my god. So I was just checking out my blog and the blogger banners up top advertise Mexican restaurants and an ad for Taco Bell. Fuckers. I think it's grand that we all get marketed to in every aspect of our living, but fucking-a, this one is just wrong. I'd rather get the gas ex ads delivered my way, than the fucking Mexican patrol.  With that said, everything else in my life can be summed up to one word: monotony. I work too much and settled for too little, eating one free burrito a day has lost its appeal to me. I want bigger and better things.  I met a guy last week. He was hot. He asked me if we could have lunch and never showed. I find that my professional life is cramping my personal life. =) Maybe he couldn't handle the fact that I am truly devoted to my craft.  My parents are living by the double standard and proving that raising kids and making decisions is a pain in the ass, further helping me realize that my decision to not have any is definitely a good one.   I finally got the brakes fixed in my car. WOOOHOO. I feel like I stepped into another world as I got them done in Annandale, of all places. I am definitely old, since I waltzed in the shop at 11 AM. (AM!!!) On my day off! I sat on my ass watching Jerry Springer and then Maury, reading the Penny Saver ads as I am a dumb ass and didn't bring my own reading material. It's amazing how many hos sleep around and then accuse men that they are their babies' daddies. This lady and I got into one part of the show and were comparing noses and ears with the babies and their fathers only to be let down when it was announced that the mom was a whore and the kid would remain a bastard. All of this hooplah for a free trip to the studios where they can humiliate themselves. And I thought I was pathetic. I have moved up the ranks from prep person, to grill master, to quesadilla champ, to professional hot putter-onner, to cold stuffer, to expo perfectionist, and this week I will amaze the crowds with my skills as a cashier (if I learn to count by Wed). I have 2 weeks, officially in my training, but will most likely remain in butt-munching Olney until the store in Arlington is complete. They are molesting the ass out of the parking lot behind the Four Courts, by the way. There are more pot holes in the ground than ever and it's a psuedo offroading experience I recommend.  That is all. I have been out of commission drinking wise for about 3 weeks. I can't hold my booze any more and it's a little bit humiliating. I have&nbsp;a 3 drink max at this point, even though I never go out. I am bored with updating. Anything big going on this week? I need some excitement that doesn't involve tacos and burritos.
