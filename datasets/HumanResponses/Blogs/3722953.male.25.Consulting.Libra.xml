       Feels a bit weird knowing that this will be read.  I have been called an introvert for so long, but this is a step to break through somethings.    Quick intro, tizeu, the name what does it mean?  Tizeu (or Tizio the spelling was never made clear) is a very small and swift black bird from Brazil.  It was given to me by my Mestre from my capoeira days in accordance to the capoeira tradition.  My capoeirista days are over, but I did earn the name.  I love capoeira because it challenges your body in ways you can not imagine and it is an art.  There are few moves that I would use in real life, but they are very affective.  Capoeira is a game of deceit, rhythm and dialogue.  I love it.  I do not want to blab everything like I'm coming back from my first date, but I am not sure what to expect.  I guess it is to share some things that are happening in my life and maybe learn how to see the bigger picture of those actions, like Wovoka.  I will get to him later.  Muito Obrigado

       I have to start adding more.  Digitally documenting my life events.  I had my 27 yr old friend Tim come to visit.  I friendship started out being on based on laughing, drinking, having a good time, and over 7 yrs it shifted.  Still a tie through drinking, but not as much and we refer to ourselves as hotboys.  Even though I live less and less hot as time progresses and me living in the US, but Tim has a latin look that he totally exploits to his advatage, as he should.  So after countless times of me visiting Chicago, my friend finally decides to drive out to New York.  The catch is, as usual he has to bring someone.  For he wasn't coming to spend time with me, he was coming to bring his automatic couple to see New York, I was just a hotel.  Which I have no problem with anyway, because I can go to a club dance and drink and have a good time.  He can not. He is social butterfly and there is nothing wrong with that.  The other difference is out taste in men.  Where as he likes kids highschool or barely 21, I look for around my age now (now being that I used to go for older people). Anyway, it was a terrible visit. I was cool, I was cordial, but I don't think he'll be back, or if he does he will not stay with me or even tell me he is coming. It's ok, because he doesn't know but I have no intentions of returning to Chicago.  I'm mentally free of Julio, Marty and I don't talk anymore, and I have no intentions of playing guess my sexuality with Tim.  He cruises the straight places now, which works for him, but never has for me.  OK finish venting.
