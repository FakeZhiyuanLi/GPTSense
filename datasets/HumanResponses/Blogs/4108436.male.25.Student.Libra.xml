      It's 11:30 at night, and I'm finally home and about ready for bed.  My medicine team was on call tonight, but thankfully I get to go home at 10:00 as a student.  I'd been in the hospital from 7:00 am until shortly after 10 when I finally left, after spending the day working on my patients, and spending my evening in the ER seeing new ones.  One of my new patients is interesting ... she presented a few times to the ER before for bronchitis, and first was discharged with no medications.  Then they gave her some antibiotics on a later visit.  And  now  she presents with a  bad  case of pneumonia.  So bad, in fact, that if you listen to her right lung, you can hear what's known in medicine as a "rub" where the lung rubs up against the parietal pleura during breaths (which is, by the way, very painful to the patient).   The ER overall seemed a bit quieter, however.  Usually it's a crazy sort of place, with people there for everything from motor vehicle accidents to drug overdoses to finger lacerations to drug seekers.  I think it might be because last night, around 2 am, a mentally ill man went on a rampage with an assault rifle and shot five police officers.  Three came to this particular hospital, and one died.  Although no one spoke about it during the evening I was there, it just seemed  a little quieter.  My resident entered the hospital this morning and saw the mayor of our city standing in the ER talking on his cell phone, so it was pretty obvious that  something  wasn't right from the get-go.  Not a good day, but not the worst either.  Tomorrow should be another one, since it's the night I moonlight.  Good night.

      Hey everyone!  OK, so I've decided to start a Blog.  Some of you who know me well probably think this is long overdue.  Well, you're probably right, but I've been kinda busy lately.  Sorry.  For those of you new here (which, considering this is my first post is all of you) I'll give you a brief introduction.  My name is Dr. Smooth (although apparently that was already taken as a Blog name, so my online name here is Dr. Smooothe).  I actually did not give myself this nickname, no sir-ree bob.  This was blessed upon me by some people I know.  I could explain why, but I don't feel like embarassing myself.  Let's tell you a little about myself.  I'm a third-year medical student at a medical school in the midwestern USA.  I'm not going to say which one to protect the privacy of those who might be mentioned on here.  I've just started my third-year rotations about two months ago, and oh do I have some stories!  Especially the psych ward at the county hospital here.  For example, there's the bipolar/borderline personality lady, who at 31 years of age has already had three children by three different fathers, all while spending at least half of her adult life committed to mental hospitals.  Oh yeah, she also has delusional fantasies about the Judge who committed her, and sends him love notes and erotic phone calls.  And she refuses to take medications, claiming God healed her ... to the extent that she punched a nurse after she tried to get her to take her pills.  Never a dull moment in psychiatry.  Right now, though, I'm doing inpatient internal medicine at the same place.  I have two patients who are just about impossible to communicate with.  Patient one (we'll call her Judith) is so hard of hearing that you have to scream into one of her ears just to get her to understand you.  Well, either that or write it down on paper.  My second patient (known as Alex) had squamous cell cancer on his vocal cords in 1996, following decades of tobacco use.  He subsequently had his vocal cords removed which renders him unable to speak and be the grouchy old man I'm sure he longs to be.  He's got pneumonia, kidney insufficiency, and breathes through a trach hole, but other than that, he's happy as a clam.   Hope you all have a restful and happy evening.  I'll catch ya on the flipside.  ciao, -Smooothe
