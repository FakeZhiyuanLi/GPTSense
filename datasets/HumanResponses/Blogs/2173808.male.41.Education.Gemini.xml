      Andrew Sullivan has a great quote today from Orwell on biases of intellectual leftists.  The quote comes from Orwell's 1945 "Notes on Nationalism."  The essay also includes the following gem on pacificism:  "The majority of pacifists either belong to obscure religious sects or are simply humanitarians who object to the taking of life and prefer not to follow their thoughts beyond that point. But there is a minority of intellectual pacifists whose real though unadmitted motive appears to be hatred of western democracy and admiration of totalitarianism. Pacifist propaganda usually boils down to saying that one side is as bad as the other, but if one looks closely at the writings of younger intellectual pacifists, one finds that they do not by any means express impartial disapproval but are directed almost entirely against Britain and the United States. Moreover they do not as a rule condemn violence as such, but only violence used in defense of western countries. The Russians, unlike the British, are not blamed for defending themselves by warlike means, and indeed all pacifist propaganda of this type avoids mention of Russia or China. It is not claimed, again, that the Indians should abjure violence in their struggle against the British.  Pacifist literature abounds with equivocal remarks  which, if they mean anything, appear to mean that statesmen of the type of Hitler are preferable to those of the type of Churchill, and that violence is perhaps excusable if it is violent enough. After the fall of France, the French pacifists, faced by a real choice which their English colleagues have not had to make, mostly went over to the Nazis, and in England there appears to have been some small overlap of membership between the Peace Pledge Union and the Blackshirts. Pacifist writers have written in praise of Carlyle, one of the intellectual fathers of Fascism. All in all it is difficult not to feel that pacifism, as it appears among a section of the intelligentsia, is secretly inspired by an admiration for power and successful cruelty. The mistake was made of pinning this emotion to Hitler, but it could easily be retransfered."  I won't go so far to say that opponents of the war, if it came to that, would prefer bin Laden or Saddam Hussein to Bush, but their unwillingness to offer anything more than the most pro forma criticisms of the former suggests a very large moral blindspot.

      Following up on my earlier post about the tendency toward conspiracy theories among supporters of political Islam, according to the BBC, Islamic clerics in Nigeria are opposing a WHO polio vaccination campaign.  This is based on rumors that "have been circulating in northern Nigeria  that the vaccine is part of a US plot to limit the country's population by spreading Aids and rendering people infertile.

      Today's NYT Week in Review has a page 1 story about the rise of political Islam.  This movement casts itself as the primary alternative to Western liberal democracy and capitalism.  Furthermore, as the story points out, even its most moderate adherents are prone to accept the most outrageous anti-American and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.  On the follow page, there is also a story about the recent report from Arab social scientists claiming that the Arab world is "failing to educate its  people, offer them basic freedoms, encourage individual enterprise or support women's rights."  Indeed, they quote from the report that "Knowledge in Arab countries today appears to be on the retreat."    It seems to me that these two stories are really one.  The lack of education, economic opportunity, and democratic values (especially for women) seems to be the real cause for the rise of political Islam.  Yet the Times story suggest that it US actions regarding Afghanistan, Iraq, and Israel are the most important factors behind its recent spread.  I don't deny that US policies have surely provoked political Islams adherents, but this seems unavoidable, given that they oppose not just to specific American policies, but the basic human values that the US and other Western nations espouse.

      I just watched some of the D.C. anti-war demonstration on C-SPAN.  Just how big was that crowd?  Some media accounts put it at tens of thousands, but I'd guess maybe 4-5000, tops.  Also, I didn't catch her whole speech, but I was struck by the mother of the Marine who wanted to get out because he was opposed to war.  If so, then why in God's name did he join the Marines?

      The NYT reports today that Charles Murray, the Josiah Nott of contemporary social science, is back at it.  It seems that Murray has set out to prove empirically that the West, especially Euro-Americans, are more accomplished than any other civilization.  I'm not a cultural relativist, but this seems a silly excercise.  First, judging civilizations on the basis of standards of accomplishment that are in large part a product of one civilization seems to tilt the playing field.  Also, Murray himself points to the biggest flaw in such a comparison.  According to the article:  "As for the near total absence of women — they represent a mere 2 percent of     the inventories — the reason is clear, Mr. Murray writes. Until the 19th century, laws and social convention severely restricted their vocational pursuits."  But why shouldn't the same logic be applied to non-western peoples?  Colonialism and other forms of domination surely limited the attainments of many.  Perhaps the demise of colonialism is the reason why Murray believes that the West is losing its superiority in the areas he catalogs.

      Well, I've decided to take the leap and start a blog.  I suppose that this is the pinnacle of hubris and ego--thinking that anyone might care about my thoughts and observations on things.  On the other hand, what makes the Safires, Krugmans, Wills, and Dowds of this world so important?    --Did anyone see the story about lightning striking the set of Mel Gibson's move about the passion of Christ?  For the second time!!??  I'm an empirical social scientist, so I'll let one strike slide as coincidence, but not two.  What are the odds of this happening?  This movie must be really bad in order to get God that upset.  Remember, Hollywood gave Roman Polanski an Oscar, and yet God did nothing--unless you count Arnold's election as governor of CA as some form of divine punishment.  --Since I study American politics, people are always asking me about the upcoming presidential election.  I haven't really focused on it, but my sense is that the Democrats are likely headed for a drubbing.  Not only is it more likely than not that the economy will improve over the coming year, but for all the worries about current situation in Iraq, I just don't see the Democrats being able to beat Bush on the foreign policy issue.  I also think Howard Dean would probably do the worst of any of the major contenders.  In 1972, Republicans tarred George McGovern as the AAA candidate--acid, amnesty, and abortion.  I have the strong feeling that next year, Republicans will do everything they can to make Dean into the SSS candidate--socialism, sodomy, and surrender.

      An interesting article in today's WaPo about the grassroots machine being developed by the Bush campaign.  According to article:  "Bush's campaign has an e-mail list totaling 6 million people, 10 times the number that Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean has, and the Bush operation is in the middle of an unprecedented drive to register 3 million new Republican voters. The campaign has set county vote targets in some states and has begun training thousands of volunteers who will recruit an army of door-to-door canvassers for the final days of the election next November."  The article goes on to point out that this program has been made possible by Bush's huge campaign war chest.    Whether you like Bush or not, this is exactly the sort of grassroots engagement that good government types have been advocating for years.  The irony is that Bush's refusal to work under the federal campaign spending guidelines makes this possible.  There's a lesson here: if you want a strong and vibrant democracy, you need to spend more, not less money in politics.

      Ruy Teixeira is one of the best analysts of American politics today.  But in his recent web piece on the LA Times Poll he errs in his analysis of moderate voters.  According to Teixeira:  "DR has commented a number of times recently on how disaffected independent voters seem to be with Bush and his policies.  The breakouts provided by The Los Angeles Times from their most recent poll provide a window on another electoral group that’s disaffected—really disaffected—with Bush and his policies.  This one’s a moose of a group, moderate voters, who constituted 50 percent of the voters in the 2000 election."  Moderate voters are, to be sure, a big part of the electorate, but according to the LA Times polling people (I called them on the phone), moderates only made up 32 percent of the poll respondents.  Liberals were 25 percent and conservatives were 40 percent (the other three percent didn't give their ideology).  As a result, the shift in moderates Teixeira comments on has less of an impact than he suggests.  Furthermore, he's right that on a number of important issues, such as right track/wrong track, Bush "understands people like me," and approval of Bush's handling of Iraq, moderates are heavily against Bush.  But on a number of other important questions, moderates are split or lean in a Bush/Republican direction.  For example, on Bush' job approval, moderates approve by a 49-45 margin.  On whether they like or dislike Bush as a person, moderates like him by  a 67-26 margin.  On approval of Bush's handling of the war on terrorism, moderates approve by a margin of 56-35.  Moderates agree that Bush is a strong leader 62-30, and consider him "honest and trustworthy," 52-34.  Whether these questions are more or less important than the ones cited by Teixeira is open to debate.  The point is that Bush is in a much stronger position than many analysts, including Teixeira, suggest.

      David Horowitz has come out in opposition to the Federal Marriage Amendment.  Good for him, but I think he misunderstands the nature of the amendment process.  Here's Horowitz:  "They [conservatives] should not be politicizing the constitutional process by encouraging the radical idea that rewriting the Constitution is a handy alternative to winning American hearts and minds and resolving these conflicts in the legislative process. If conservatives seek a constitutional change to achieve culture war victories that could have been won through legislative means, the Left will only escalate its own efforts to do the same and the last protective membrane of our polity will have been torn to shreds."  But the amendment process IS the legislative process.  You need 2/3 of both house of Congress and 3/4 of the state legislatures to amend the Constitution.  That seems to require "winning American hearts and minds," to say the least.    The problem with the amendment is two-fold.  First, the majority of American don't support it.  Some polls even show a majority of gay marriage opponents don't want the amendment.  Second, amending the Constitution to formally discriminate against a particular group of people is odious in the extreme, regardless of whether the process is "legislative" or not.  Rather than arguing over procedures, I wish Horowitz had addressed the issue directly.  Gays and lesbians are full and equal citizens, and the state cannot deny them the rights, privileges, and benefits that it provides to other citizens as a matter of course.  To do otherwise is prejudice, plain and simple.

      In Saturday's NYT, historian Sean Wilentz plays the great counterfactual of our time, "What if Kennedy Had Lived?"  According to Wilentz:  "There's no question that Johnson  was able to carry forward Kennedy's domestic agenda  because of the 37 House seats gained by the Democrats in the 1964 elections, a landslide that  produced a working majority for progressive legislation for the first time in a quarter century. But Kennedy  was a more popular figure than Johnson.  Had Kennedy lived to run against Barry Goldwater, the Democrats probably would have picked up 50 more liberal legislators."  Is there even the slightest bit of evidence for this?  LBJ won in 1964 with 61% of the vote.  This is the highest for any presidential candidate, before or since, so it seems unlikely that JFK would have improved on this by enough to carry an additional 13 seats.

      In today’s WaPo, Harold Meyerson is again running different electoral strategies.  As he sees it, the Democrats need to hold all the states won by Gore and win Ohio.  Meyerson also points out, correctly that Democratic lead among Ohio’s registered voters has increased by 1 point since 9/11.  That’s correct as far as it goes, but Meyerson doesn’t really discuss just how difficult it will be for Democrats to hold the states won by Gore.  The Pew survey cited by Meyerson shows that in 6 states won by Gore, the Republicans have surged into lead among registered voters.  These states (Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Washington, and Vermont) constitute 79 Electoral College votes.  In contrast, only Mississippi and Maine with 10 Electoral College votes have seen the Democrats take the lead in party registration from Republicans.  Of course, having a lead in registered voters doesn’t translate into winning the state, but it does show how much the Democrats have slipped since 9/11.    Furthermore, all of this talk of ground game, GOTV efforts, and targeting crucial states is for naught if the Democrats can’t at least get to within spitting distance of 50 percent of the vote.  And the Pew survey, along with most others, suggests that such a prospect is looking unlikely.  Bush’s approval ratings have fallen substantially from their post-9/11 highs, but he’s still in the mid to high 50s.  That’s a pretty good position to be in.  This means that for the Democrats things have to get worse for them to have a chance at knocking off Bush.  That’s looking less and less likely with the economy. On social issues, if anything, the recent ruling on gay marriage will further add to the Republican advantage here.  That leaves Iraq, and here the Democrats not only have to hope for decreased support for Bush, but (and most crucially) the majority of voters has to see the Democratic nominee as a credible alternative to Bush on this issue.  And there’s no evidence of that happening yet.

      I ran a regression with change in the Democratic vote from Landrieu to Blanco as the dependent variable.  As independent variables I used % white in the county, % for Bush in '00, and % for Duke in '91.  Both the % white and the % for Bush are statistically insignificant, but the Duke variable is highly significant (p

      Yesterday's Louisiana governor's race was closely watched if for no other reason than the Republicans nominated a non-white candidate, Indian-American Bobby Jindal.  Despite running somewhat better among blacks than most Republicans, Jindal still lost the election mostly because his Democratic opponent, Kathleen Blanco, ran particularly well among whites, even in some of the most rural and conservative parts of the state.  How much of a role did white racism play in white voting behavior?  In counties where David Duke ran below his statewide average (39%) in the 1991 governor's race, Blanco only averaged 2 percentage points better than Democrat Mary Landrieu in last year's US Senate run-off.  In counties where Duke did better than average, Blanco ran 7 points better than Landrieu.  Finally, in counties won by Duke, Blanco did 11 points better than Landrieu.

      Here's Gore Vidal interviewed in LA Weekly:  "The USA PATRIOT Act is as despotic as anything Hitler came up with — even using much of the same language. In one of my earlier books, Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace, I show how the language used by the Clinton people to frighten Americans into going after terrorists like Timothy McVeigh — how their rights were going to be suspended only for a brief time — was precisely the language used by Hitler after the Reichstag fire."  I'm not a big fan of the USA PATRIOT Act, but "as despotic as anything Hitler came up with"?  Anything?  Remember, Hitler came up with lots of things.    Also, what exactly did Hitler say after the Reichstag fire.  According to one witness, Hitler shouted:  "There will be no mercy now.  Anyone who stands in our way will be cut down.  The German people will  not tolerate leniency.  The communist deputies must be hanged this very night.  Everybody in league with them must be arrested.  There will no longer be any leniency for Social Democrats either."  Say what you will about the Bush administration, but these facile comparisons to the Nazis only trivialize the true horrors of that regime.

      In today's WaPo, Harold Meyerson analyzes the results of the recent Philly mayor's race.  He claims that John Street's victory resulted, in part, from a massive voter registration drive among Philly's minority community.  Among other claims, Meyerson states that Congressman Chaka Fattah registered 86,000 new voters in the last 3 months and that efforts are underway to register another 85,000 by next November.  I looked into this a bit more and I think Meyerson is grasping at straws.  First, there's no way that Fattah registered 86,000 new voters in the last three months.  In May 2003, there were about 912,000 registered voters in Philly.  By November, that had only risen to 958,000, an increase of only 46,000 voters.  Of those 46,000, only about 34,000 were registered Dems.  This is an increase over May, but the number of registered Democrats in the city is the lowest since 1998 and 40,000 fewer than in November 2000.  As for registering an additional 85,000 voters in the coming year, well, that's a tall order.  Right now, about 86% of the city's voting age population is registered.  Adding another 85,000 voters would raise that to 93%.  Given that some portion of the voting age population population either can't register (because of non-citizen status, criminal convictions, mental incompetence, etc.) or won't register, I'd guess that 93% would represent about 100% (perhaps more) of those willing and eligible to register.  Today, even with these voter registration efforts, Philadelphia's Democrats make up 9.4% of Pennsylvania's voters.  That's down from 9.8% in 2000.  Even if they can add an additional 85,000 voters, and all of them are Democrats (both dubious propositions), that would only make Philadelphia's Democrat's 10.5% of the electorate.  That would help the Democrats, but it's nothing that fundamentally changes either Pennsylvania or national politics.  Finally, let's say the Democrat's sweep Pennsylvania in 2004 as a result of these efforts.  So what?  Gore won the state in 2000 and he still lost the election.  What are Democrats doing in states that Gore lost, such as Kentucky, to bring them into the D column?  Furthermore, due to population changes Pennsylvania lost 2 electoral votes and overall, Gore's 267 electoral votes in 2000 will only be 260 electoral votes in 2004.  Where does Meyerson propose getting those extra states?

      I've just had a chance to look over the Center for Public Integrity's recent report on the campaign contributions of contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The report claims to be a damning expose of political cronyism and kickbacks.  Maybe I'm missing something, but I just don't see the relationship.  First, as others have pointed out, there's no clear relationship between the size of contracts and the amounts contributed.  Second, as a recent WaPo op-ed by the Clinton administration official in charge of federal procurement pointed out, there's no evidence of political influence in the contracting process.  Third, as the CPI report shows, these were contributions to Democrats AND Republicans.  I quote:  "According to the Center's analysis, the companies, their political action committees and their employees contributed a total of nearly $49 million to national political campaigns and parties since 1990. Donations to Republican Party committees—the Republican National Committee, the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee—outpaced those to Democratic committees, $12.7 million to $7.1 million. Among individual candidates, President George Bush received more money from these companies than any other, a little over $500,000."  They don't include a breakdown of contributions for each company by party, so for all we know, the top contractors might have given as much of more of their contributions to Democrats rather than Republicans.  Also, not the "since 1990" formulation.  Looking just at party contributions, that amounts to contributions of about $1.5 million a year total, with about $0.98 million for the GOP and $0.55 million for the Dems.  Also, this is spread out over about 70 companies, leaving an average contribution of about $21,000 per company.  Again, maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see much smoke here and certainly no evidence of a fire.

      Today's Washington Post has some interesting poll numbers.  Perhaps most striking, there is no gender gap in either Bush's job approval numbers or in whether or not people think the war in Iraq was worth fighting.  To see if this was a one-poll fluke, I went back and looked at these questions for 2003.  These are the results:  "All in all, considering the costs to the United States versus the benefits to the United States, do you think the war with Iraq was worth fighting, or not?"  Date               Men              Women           Difference 10/26-29         55                54                  +1 10/9-13           58                50                  +8 9/10-13           63                59                  +4 8/7-11             61                62                  -1 7/9-10             60                55                  +5 4/27-30           71                68                  +3  The margin of error (MOE) in each poll was +/- 3 percentage points.  The only time the difference between men and women fell outside the MOE was in the 10/9-13 survey.  In all other polls, the difference between men and women was statistically insignificant.    Where did the gender gap go?  I don't know, but so much for the idea of women being more pacifistic than men or more sensitive to losses of life.  Here's the breakdown of Bush's approval rating:  Date	     Men	     Women	   Difference	MOE 10/26-29	57	      55	          2	            3	 10/9-13	56	      49	          7	            3*	 9/30	      57	      51	          6	            5	 9/10-13	60	      56	          4	            3	 8/7-11	      61	      55	          6	            3	 7/9-10	      60	      58	          2	            3	 4/27-30	72	      70	          2	            3	 4/16	      75	      72	          3	            5	 4/9	           78	      76	          2	            5	 4/3	           74	      68	          6	            4.5	 3/23	     74	      64	         10	            4*Approve/Disapprove Only 3/20	      72	      63	           9	            5 Approve/Disapprove Only 2/19-23	64	      56	           8	            3*Approve/Disapprove Only 2/6-9         59        59             0                3  Differences outside the margin of error (MOE) are marked with an asterisk.  The 3/23, 3/20, and 2/19-23 polls asked only approve or disapprove of the president's job performance.  All other surveys asked whether respondents strongly approve/disapprove or just approve/disapprove.  Again, there's no gender difference to speak of.

      Victor Davis Hanson has an excellent piece in the National Review online analyzing the rising tide of anti-semitism.  This development is one of the most depressing and worrisome things I've ever seen.  Mark Strauss had an excellent piece (Anti-Globalization's Jewish Problem") in the most recent Foreign Policy magazine.  In it, he analyzed the union of "brown, green, and red" with anti-semitism as the common thread.  Just more evidence that underlying all of this is fascism--the revolt against modernity, the infatuation with nihilism and death, the idealization of identity and volk, the rejection of reason, and, of course, hatred of Jews.  An how ironic that it's coming from the left rather than the right.  On the other hand, it was national "socialism" after all, wasn't it?

      Here's Eric Alterman on critics of Paul Krugman:  "It's no accident that it is mostly liberals who tend to inspire this bit of illogic, and nobody does it better than Krugman. The so-called Krugman Truth Squad, led by wannabe Ayatollah Andy Sullivan, succeeds in nothing so much as embarrassing itself with its small-minded obsessiveness about matters that the Princeton by way of Yale, MIT and Stanford economist clearly understands better than they do."  Whether you love or hate Krugman, what an astounding display of elitism.  Krugman is clearly an intelligent and well-educated man, but the two are not the same thing.  One of the worst aspect of the current left is its often sneering disdain for those without Ivied credentials.

      In today's WaPo, E.J. Dionne states, "The conventional wisdom, fed by shrewd Republican operatives and commentators, is that Democrats, so out there in their antipathy for Bush, will push their party into an extremist wonderland and lose white men, security moms and anybody else who does not share their desire for revenge.  The opposite is true. Democrats will not have to spend inordinate amounts of time or money in this election year "uniting their base." Opposition to Bush has already done that. . . .  This time the Democrats will have most of the election year to appeal to swing voters. Democrats are so hungry to beat Bush that they will let their nominee do just about anything, even be pragmatic and shrewd."  I'm not so sure.  According to the most recent WaPo poll, in a race between Bush and a generic Democrat, the Democrat gets the support of 77% of self-identified Democrats.  That's pretty good, but nothing like the 91% support Bush gets from self-identified Republicans.    In a match-up between Dean and Bush, Dean gets the votes of 70% of Democrats, while Bush gets the votes of 93% of Republicans.  To me, that sounds like the Republicans have done a better job of lining up their partisans than have the Democrats and thus will have an easier time during the campaign of appealing to swing voters, especially if Dean in the Democratic nominee.

      Here's a new ARG poll from 12/26-28:  Dean 37 Kerry 19 Clark 12 Undecided 18  Here's their poll from 12/15-17 Dean 41 Kerry 17 Clark 13 Undecided 12   The undecideds are clearly up and Dean seems to be down a bit.  This has to be good news for Kerry and Clark.  If Kerry can manage a strong third in Iowa, he might just make a run at Dean in NH.  If Dean wins Iowa, however, he'll get a good bounce going into NH.

      More on the NYT economic approval numbers.  The percentage of respondents rating the economy very good or fairly good jumped to 55 percent from 50 percent in November and 43 percent in September/October.  And this isn't just an artifact of the post-Saddam capture bounce.  Prior to the capture, the number was 56 percent.  It's a similiar story on the question of whether the economy is getting better or worse.  By a 20 point margin (39-19), people think the economy is getting better.  Before the capture, the margin was only 10 points, but even that is a big improvement over the margins of 1 point in October and -5 points in September/October.  On the tax cuts, people think they were good for the economy by a margin of 27-16.  Before Saddam's capture, that was 27-20.  But in April the difference was only 21-19.  Overall, this news is probably more worrisome to the Democrats than the capture of Saddam.

      I was just looking over the latest NYT poll on Bush's job approval rating.  The most obvious development is the bounce he's gotten from the Saddam capture.  That's to be expected and probably will be somewhat transitory unless things in Iraq improve rapidly and significantly.    What didn't get much attention are the numbers on Bush's handling of the economy.  They also bounced, from 44-51 approve/disapprove before the capture to 49-43 afterwards.  The latter numbers obviously reflects some spillover from the Saddam capture into other, non-foreign policy areas.  On the other hand, even if you use the earlier 44-51 split as the baseline, this is the best showing for Bush since April, in the immediate aftermath of Baghdad's fall.  If you discount the polls taken during the war, these are the best numbers since last February.  Overall, Bush's economic approval numbers have risen 8 points since August.

      I was deeply saddened to see Paul Simon pass away.  He was genuinely decent and kind man and my proudest political moment was when I worked on his 1988 campaign.    I keep coming back to his campaign slogan, "We Can Do Better" and how it compares to so much of the angry and divisive rhetoric of this year's campaign.  Paul Simon had no love for Reaganism, but his slogan reflected a belief that all Americans could and should unite around shared purposes and values.  Like another great man from downstate Illinois, he appealed to the "better angels of our nature."  Let's hope that his vision prevails.

      Some interesting data on hate crimes in the US vs. France.  In all of 2002, the FBI reports 155 incidents of anti-Islamic hate crimes.  In just the first 10 months of 2002, France experienced 184 incidents of anti-Semitic violence.  Also remember that the US has 288,000,000 million people vs. less than 60 million for France.

       More on NH GOP Primary   USA Today by way of  urlLink Mickey Kaus  notes that one reason for the number of Democratic write-ins in the NH Republican primary was that Democrats who registered Republican to vote for John McCain in 2000 are still there and still unhappy with George W. Bush.

      Following up my earlier post about the New Hampshire Republican primary results,  urlLink John Nichols  in The Nation suggests that they offer evidence of rising Republican dissatisfaction with President Bush.  According to Nichols:   "Many New Hampshire primary participants decided to skip the formalities and  simply vote against the president in Tuesday's Republican primary. Thousands  of these Bush-bashing Republicans went so far as to write in the names of  Democratic presidential contenders."   As I mentioned previously, Bush took 87 percent in the Republican primary, topping even Ronald Reagan in 1984 and Richard Nixon in 1972.  Nichols points out however that Democratic write-ins did particularly well:   "Few of the anti-Bush votes went to the 13 unknown Republicans whose names  appeared on GOP ballots along with the president's. Instead, top Democratic  contenders reaped write-in votes. . . .  In all, 8,279 primary voters wrote in the names of Democratic challengers to  Bush on their Republican ballots."   True enough, but a historical comparison puts this into perspective.  In 1984, Democratic write-ins were 11 percent of Ronald Reagan's total vote.  In 2004, Democratic write-ins were 13 percent of George W. Bush's total vote.  Since Reagan went on to win 69 percent of the vote in the general election, I hardly think this constitutes evidence of a Republican backlash against Bush.

       urlLink Mickey Kaus  points out that Bush got 87 percent in the New Hampshire Republican primary.  Kaus asks, "Isn't that not so good?"  In 1984,  urlLink Ronald Reagan  received 86 percent and in 1972,  urlLink Richard Nixon  got 68 percent, so I'd say it's good enough.

      Back in March,  urlLink Harold Meyerson  claimed that John Kerry was the ideal candidate.  Why?:   besides his positioning and his bankroll, Kerry brings one further asset to his run for president. To call it "campaigning ability" is to trivialize it, but whatever we choose to term it, Kerry's current capacity to take what Democrats -- what Americans -- are feeling, and to voice it in the clarified, dramatized and elevated form that gifted political leaders can sometimes achieve, is far beyond anything his fellow candidates (much less the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.) are capable of.   But then, despite being a "gifted political leader," Kerry began to tank and in September Meyerson began singing the praises of   Wesley Clark .  According to Meyerson, Clark was the only candidate with "support from all quadrants" of the Democratic party.    In November, however, Clark was in a dead heat with Dick Gephardt in the Meyerson primary.  According to Meyerson, Clark and Gephardt were the two Democrats most likely to win in key battleground states like  Ohio .  As things turned out, however, Ohio didn't loom as large in the general election as did the  urlLink existential margins .  And what candidate could sweep the electoral college votes of the "existential margins"?  Howard Dean!  Why did Meyerson think Dean appealed to the "existential margins"?  Because Dean was like  urlLink John Wayne :   Alone among the Democratic candidates, Dean understood that the law hadn't come yet to Dodge, that the party needed a tough guy who could unleash its long-suppressed animal instincts.   But unleashing the "animal instincts" of the "existential margins," got Dean only 18 percent in Iowa.  And that despite the fact that John Wayne was born in Iowa.  Now it turns out that, according to Meyerson, Dean was a  urlLink bad candidate  after all.    And who is Meyerson supporting now?  He's back to singing the  praises of John Kerry .  Why?  Because Kerry is a "powerhouse" and "real men support John Kerry."    Why does the WaPo print this guy?

      In the social sciences (and in medicine and other fields that use statistical analysis), students are taught about Type I and Type II errors.  In Type I errors, the results offer a false positive--something that seems to be, really isn't.  In Type II errors, something that doesn't seem to be, really is.  Imagine a test for cancer.  A Type I error on the test would indicate that you have cancer, when you really didn't.  This, of course, would cause all sorts of anxiety and worry, but further tests and procedures would ultimately show that you did not have cancer.  In contrast, Type II errors are far more worrisome, since they would indicate that you did not cancer when you really did.  Patients would remain ignorant of their peril until, perhaps, it was too late.  As such, when devising any sort of test like this, you usually want to err on the side of caution by having Type I rather than Type II errors.  Better a false positive than a false negative.  Why this primer on statistics?  It seems to me that the concept of Type I and Type II errors is highly relevant to current discussions about the absence of WMD in Iraq.  Any intelligence estimate regarding WMD is susceptible to Type I and Type II errors.  In a Type I error, we would predict that a country has WMD when in fact they do not.  A Type II error would predict no WMD when in fact a country did have them.  From all accounts, the Bush administration (and the Blair government, and the French, and the Germans, and the UN, etc.) committed Type I errors in their assesment of Iraq's WMD capability.  They thought something was there that really was not.  As with the cancer tests, Type I errors cause problems, but they are far better than Type II errors.  The Bush administration decided to err on the side of caution in assessing Iraq's WMD capacity.  Better to run the risk of finding out there was no Iraqi WMD threat, than to find out too late that such a threat really did exist.  In the aftermath of 9/11 I can't fault the Bush adminstration for this.  9/11 showed that the prospect of a Type II error in intelligence assessment was potentially catastrophic.  Yes, Type I errors are not to be dismissed as irrelevant.  Going to war has real costs and risks, but in this case, the predicted risk of going to war was far less than the risk of not going to war.  Add to that the nature of Saddam's regime and the cost of not going to war becomes intolerable.  As  urlLink Tony Blair  put it in his speech to Congress this summer:   Can we be sure that terrorism and weapons of mass destruction will join together? Let us say one thing: If we are wrong, we will have destroyed a threat that at its least is responsible for inhuman carnage and suffering. That is something I am confident history will forgive.   But if our critics are wrong, if we are right, as I believe with every fiber of instinct and conviction I have that we are, and we do not act, then we will have hesitated in the face of this menace when we should have given leadership. That is something history will not forgive.

      Quick thoughts on NH:  1. 14 points is a big win for Kerry.  2. Has a Massachusetts Dem ever lost the NH primary?  Kerry, Tsongas, Dukakis, and JFK all won.  Ted Kennedy lost in 1980, but he was running against an incumbent president.  3.  This, on the heels of Iowa, is a big loss for Dean.  I'm having a hard time thinking of two states (other than VT) more favorable to Dean's campaign than Iowa and New Hampshire.  If he can't win either of them, where does he win?  Plus, he had plenty of money in both states and now that will be in short supply.  4. Edwards was below expectations, but he will claim (assuming he actually beats Clark) that he did the best of any candidate from a non-contiguous state.  5. Even if he ends up beating Edwards, Clark took a real hit.  He had the state to himself for the last month, he had money, and high polls until last week.  He blew it all.  6. SC will be the Thunderdome for Clark and Edwards--"Two men enter--one man leave."

      The  BBC  is reporting that French politicians received bribes from Saddam Hussein.  One of those accused responded by saying:   "I have never received any gifts from the Iraqi government  and I am not in the habit of making my decisions on the basis of any remuneration I might receive."   In other words, I didn't get a bribe, and if I did, it wouldn't have influenced me, at least most of the time.

       urlLink Human Rights Watch  has a new report out on the Iraq War.  According to HRW's director, Kenneth Roth:   ". . . removing Saddam Hussein from power brought about the end of one of the world’s most abusive governments. But intervening militarily on the territory of a sovereign state, without its permission, is inherently dangerous and must be undertaken for humanitarian purposes in only the most extreme cases. While Saddam Hussein had an atrocious human rights record, his worst atrocities were committed long before the intervention. At the time coalition forces invaded Iraq, there was no ongoing or imminent mass killing of the sort that would require the kind of preventive military action that should characterize true humanitarian interventions."   Roth adds:   “The Bush administration cannot justify the war in Iraq as a humanitarian intervention, and neither can Tony Blair.  Saddam Hussein’s atrocities should certainly be punished, and his worst atrocities, such as the 1988 genocide against the Kurds, would have justified humanitarian intervention then. But such interventions should be reserved for stopping an imminent or ongoing slaughter. They shouldn’t be used belatedly to address atrocities that were ignored in the past.”    So let me get this straight, genocide is only a crime if you get caught in the act?  Also, Roth agrees that Saddam should be punished, but how would that be possible without toppling the Iraqi regime?    Furthermore, even if Saddam was to never again commit atrocities on the scale of 1988, he clearly was going to keep on killing Iraqis.  Putting aside the tens of thousands of children killed every year by his abuse of the sanctions, Saddam was killing thousands of Iraqis every year as a matter of course.  Just how many dead Iraqis would Roth like to see before he justifies intervention.  1000?  5000?  10,000?  100,000?  More?  Roth's defense of state sovereignty makes him sound like the head of Treaty of Westphalia Watch, not Human Rights Watch.  This deference to state sovereignty made sense at a time when wars usually entailed massive civilian casualties and when there were no agreed upon norms of democratic governance.  But today, technological changes have raised the possibility of relativelys short and bloodless wars, such as what we saw last year in Iraq.  Furthermore, there is a global norm of democratic and humanitarian values.  Therefore, I would argue that regimes, like Saddams, that ruthlessly and continually brutalize their own people abdicate the normal rights accorded to sovereign states, and deposing them is justified if the cost in civilian casualties is proportionate to the ends.  Contrary to Roth, the Iraq War was a humanitarian war.

       urlLink Chrisishardcore  defends his estimates of the one-day results fromt the ARG tracking poll:   ARG's numbers are ultimately probably going to be wrong, so are Zogby's and so are everyone's.  With two days left until the primary these 3 day tracking polls won't be able to accurately show late surges -- and that's what I'm trying to do.   But as I said in my earlier posts, even if you see a surge in the last day of a 3-day tracking poll, this could just be a routine blip in the margin of error--and blip are quite common with a margin of error of approximately +/- 7 percentage points.  In other words, that late surge might turn out to be nothing.  I'm not saying that Dean, or any other candidate, is or isn't surging.  What I am saying is that absent some surveys with large samples, we just don't know.  If Chrisishardcore's analysis turns out to be correct, it's more from luck than anything else.

       urlLink Mickey Kaus  is touting blogger  urlLink Chrisishardcore's  estimates of the one day ARG tracking poll results.  As I mentioned in an earlier post, these one day numbers are meaningless.  Furthermore, Chrisishardcore's estimates don't match up with what ARG is reporting.  According to  urlLink ARG   "Howard                                                                  Dean is up 10 percentage points from his low on January 22, but he still trails John Kerry                                                                  by 17 percentage points in the latest daily numbers.   But Chrisishardcore estimates that on 1/24, ARG had Kerry with 42 and Dean with 20, a 22 point difference, not 17.  Furthermore, Chrisishardcore estimates that on 1/22, Dean had 15 percent, so if his support increased 10 points, he'd have to be at 25, not 20.  Finally, Chrisishardcore has Dean's lowest day as 1/23 when he was at 13 percent, not 1/22.  So to my warning about relying on one day tracking poll results, add a caveat about never ever relying on  estimates  of one day tracking poll results.  If, as some said, the Zogby polls before the Iowa caucuses were "crack for the weak", then these estimates are "crank for wimps."

      Not content with all of the tracking polls (five by my count: CNN/USA Today, ARG, Suffolk U., Zogby/Reuters/MSNBC, and Boston Globe), the media is now beginning to look at the one day results of the tracking polls.  Usually, a tracking poll surveys 200 people a day and then combines the results for three days.  This gives a sample of about 600 people--a decent sample size and a margin of error (MOE) of about +/- 4 percentage points.  A one-day sample of 200 people, however, gives a MOE of +/-7 percentages.  That's a very wide margin, so wide that if Kerry were at 28, Dean 18, Clark 17, Edwards 15, and Lieberman 14, the correct headline would be "Five-Way Tie for New Hampshire Lead!."  To show how the one day results can jump around,  urlLink Suffolk U.  is giving the daily results of their tracking poll.  Here are Friday's results:  Kerry  35 Dean  18 Clark  11  But on Thursday, it was:  Kerry 23 Dean 22 Clark 18  The point is, don't trust one day results.

       urlLink Andrew Sullivan  takes Al Sharpton to task for his flailing comments about the Federal Reserve.  I'm no Sharpton supporter but his comments, whether you agree or disagree with them, did make a substantative point--we need a Fed that supports full employment and economic growth.  On the other hand, John Edwards completely whiffed on a question about the Defense of Marriage Act.  When asked about it,  urlLink Edwards said:    "what happened with the Defense of Marriage Act is it took away the power of states, like Vermont, to be able to do what they chose to do about civil unions, about these kinds of marriage issues."   Later, Brit Hume pressed him on this response and Edwards said:   No, the Defense of Marriage -- first of all, I wasn't in the Congress, I don't claim to be an expert on this. But as I understand the Defense of Marriage Act, it would take away the power of some states to choose whether they would recognize or not recognize gay marriages. That's my understanding of it.   That's completely wrong.  The Defense of Marriage Act says that one state does not have to recognize the marriage between two homosexuals granted by another state.    Why not go after Edwards on this?

      Harold Meyerson has an astounding track record of poor predictions.  He's constantly claiming that a labor/minority/populist/whatever coalition is remaking American politics in a more progressive tradition.  As events of the last decade show (and Meyerson's been making this claim for at least that long), this hasn't happened.   urlLink Just last month , Meyerson breathlessly sang the praises of Howard Dean and his insurgent campaign.  According to him:   Howard Dean's initial appeal has been to those Americans who always knew they were on the margins of George Bush's America. Not the socioeconomic margins, not the African American and Latino communities, but the political, cultural and existential margins -- the young, urban, white middle class in particular. Dean's are the people who were bowling alone -- not churchgoers, not union members. They shared a set of beliefs on which they'd never before had an opportunity to act collectively.    The secret of Dean's success has been twofold. Alone among the serious Democratic candidates he understood that the party was shirking its obligation to oppose -- indeed, that the grass roots was furious at the failure of its leaders to realize this. Second, his campaign became the real Meetup for millions of Americans who'd had no place to go to affect politics in the age of Bush. Dean's edge is that his campaign has provided thousands of young Deaniacs with a dimension of meaning that their hitherto disaggregated lives may have lacked. No other candidate is within light-years of offering that.   But wait, how does he square that with the Iowa results?  Unfortunately, the Iowa entrance polls didn't survey those on "existential margins," but Meyerson has an  urlLink answer  nonetheless:    Iowa voters see the candidates up close -- a level of scrutiny that neither Dean nor Gephardt was able to withstand. The lesson of the past half-decade is that the more adept union political programs can still move votes when they have an attractive candidate. When saddled with a Gray Davis or the Gephardt and Dean who assailed Iowan ears and sensibilities for the past month, there isn't a lot they can do.   There you have it, despite Meyerson's earlier praise, it's Dean's fault.  It can't possibly be that there just aren't that many people on the existential margins or that campaigns that tap into the anger and cyncism of those that are end up alienating more moderate and sensible voters.

Crowley adds that many of the comments suggest that support for Dean might have been a mile wide and an inch deep.  A must read.

       urlLink Andrew Sullivan  has a good take on that NYT/CBS poll that had Bush down to a 50 percent approval rating.  It seems that 47 percent of the sample were Democratic identifiers, much too high to be representative.  Contrast that with the most recent WaPo poll which has Bush's approval at 58 percent, essential unchanged from last month.

      So where was the vaunted Dean “hard count”?  According to  urlLink ABC's The Note , Dean's "campaign believes they turned out all of their "ones"  —  their hard count voters  —  but that the caucus became a primary based on momentum, and they were ill-suited to win a primary."  Before the caucuses, Dean’s people were tossing around hard count numbers of 35,000 to 50,000 people, saying that if turnout was around 125,000 they would have enough to win.    But turnout was only 122,000 of which Dean got only 18 percent (delegate count) to 21 percent (entrance poll figures).  That means Dean turned out only 22,000 to 26,000 people.  Not bad, but nowhere near what they claimed.  Two things might have happened.  First, many people ended up switching, despite their earlier commitment to Dean.  In that respect, Dean’s organization might have ended up giving lots of rides to people who went for Kerry or Edwards.  Second, the Dean organization might have just been blowing smoke about their organizational ability, hoping that with enough spin they could create something out of nothing.  But at the end, it was mostly nothing.

      Some thoughts on the Iowa results:  1. What a big win for Kerry.  He got 38 percent--better than Gephardt's 31 percent in 1988 and nearly as good as Mondale's 49 percent in 1984, even though Mondale was a former VP, from a neighboring state, and running against arguably weaker competition (George McGovern came in third that year).    2. Edward also did extremely well.  32 percent is a very strong showing.  Until I heard the results, I would have assumed 32 percent would have been enough to win.    3. Not only did Dean lose, but he seems to be coming unhinged.  First, shades of Bob Doles snarling "stop lying about my record" to George Bush in 1988, he blames attacks by the other candidates for his losing.  Second, looking like a Vermont Willie Stark, he gives a  urlLink wild speech  to his supporters.  Is this man angry?  I don't know, but he sure looks mad.    4. I wouldn't underestimate the impact of Dean's nasty response to the questioner last week.  5. I feel very bad for Dick Gephardt.  He's a decent man who has consistently fought for working families.  He deserved better than this, not only as a presidential candidate, but he also should have become Speaker of the House.  6. The rise of Edwards is explicable.  He got the DM Register endorsement and that sparked his move by giving people a reason to look at him again.  But Kerry's rise isn't nearly as clear.  There was no real change in his campaign message, no defining character moment in a debate ("I paid for this microphone!), no external event.  Yes, he had good organization his surge in support was much more than just getting their people out to vote.  If you have thoughts on this, let me know because I really don't have much of a clue.  7. Susan Estrich was on Fox News.  Was she drunk or what?

      Iowa predictions?  That's a fool's bet, but I'll be foolish and say Kerry 33, followed by Dean 27, Edwards 22, and then Gephardt 18.  That's the delegate count.

       urlLink Mickey Kaus  has a good article in Slate about the various intricacies of the Iowa caucuses.  There are essentially four measures of the outcome:   1. The entrace poll:  A sample of people's preferences when they walk into the caucus sites.   2. The first round preferences: People's initial choices prior to some candidates being eliminated as not viable.   3. The second round preferences:  The breakdown after the supporters of non-viable candidates have shifted to viable ones.   4. The delegate count: The pecentage breakdown of delegates awarded in each caucus.   The upshot is that in a close race between multiple candidates, we could get winners at each level.  I'd add two points to Kaus's.  First, since not every caucus has the same number of delegates, a candidate could have the most caucus-goers and still end up with fewer delegates.  For example, in Caucus #1, all 500 attendees go for Dean, giving Dean all 10 of the delegates in that caucus.  In Caucus #2, there are also 10 delegates, but only 250 people show up, all of whom go for Kerry.  In terms of attendees, Dean wins 2:1 (500 to 250), but in delegates it's an even split (10-10).     Second, that's only tonight.  The delegates selected will go on to county caucus in upcoming weeks where the process begins again when they select delegates to the state convention, where the process again works its way through.  So tonight's outcome might be very different from the results in coming weeks and months.   Third, I'm not as critical of the process as is Kaus.  Economists and rational choice theorists tell us that any method of aggregating preferences can lead to different outcomes.  Look at Florida in 2000.  Gore won the popular vote, but Bush won the election in the Electoral College.  But did he?  Depends on what method of recount you use in Florida?  Or what judicial body you rely on to determine what type of recount or whether there will be a recount at all.  Plus, just about everyone acknowledges that more people walked in to the booth intending to vote for Gore.  Finally, what about the people who didn't vote, for whatever the reason?  Shouldn't their preferences count for something?  In short, no process is perfect, especially in tight races.   Also, caucuses are not general elections.  The only substantive meaning to the caucus is to begin the process by which Iowa Democrats will determine the allocation of their national convention delegates.  But the media wants to make more of this, so they demand to make it into a primary.  But it's not.   Finally, I don't mind giving parties a bit more independence and autonomy.  Parties should have some discretion over how the conduct their own affairs.  Yes, they serve a public function but unless it's something as bad as a white primary, I say cut them some slack.  Besides, if you are looking for undemocratic and non-transparent aspects of American politics, the Senate and the Supreme Court offer much bigger targets.

      Of the Democratic candidates, my choice would be Dick Gephardt.  He's been in the trenches for the party for the last 20 years, plus his views on foreign and domestic politics fit pretty closely with mine.  But I just read in the  urlLink Washington Post  that he's been endorsed by singer Michael Bolton.  Yes, that Michael Bolton, forever immortalized in the movie "Office Space" as a "no-talent ass-clown."  I might just have to find a new candidate.

      The DM Register Iowa poll is out with these results:  Kerry 26% Edwards 23% Dean 20% Gephardt 18%  This seems to confirm the Zogby tracking polls showing surges for Kerry and Edwards.  With the candidates so close, the race will probably come down to second choices.  As I mentioned in my earlier post, in many caucuses, some candidates won't make the 15% viability threshold and their supporters will be forced to switch to other candidates.  The DM Register poll doesn't ask about second choices, but it does have favorable/unfavorable ratings.  Presumably the candidates with the lowest favorability will have fewer second choice voters.  And that's bad new for Dean since his unfavorables are significantly higher than the other candidates: 35% versus 22 for Gephardt, 15 for Kerry, and 14 for Edwards.

      I'm sure everyone has seen those  urlLink MSNBC/Zogby polls  from Iowa, but there's one aspect that hasn't been reported--the second choice preferences.  Unfortunately, they don't give second choices broken down by first choices, but they do have Kerry leading second choices with 25 percent of the vote, Edwards with 18, Dean at 17, and Gephardt with 14.  That could be good news for Kerry since the 15% viability threshold means that some caucusgoers will be forced to vote for their second choice.

      The new  urlLink NYT/CBS poll  shows some slippage in support for Bush.  Some of this is due to the fading of the surge he saw after the capture of Saddam Hussein, but there also seems to be a turn toward more pessimistic assessments of the economy and Bush's handling of it.  For example, only 39 percent has confidence in Bush's ability to make the right decisions on the economy--the lowest level of his presidency.  Also, only 23 percent think Bush cares a lot about people like them, again the lowest ever.  Not only has Bush slipped but assessments of the Democratic candidates, particularly Dean have jumped.  Since December, Dean's approval rating has jumped 10 points in the last month.  All of this should concern the Bush people since, if anything, things in Iraq have gotten a bit better.  If things take a turn for the worse there, Bush's public support could really go south.  Bush does retain some significant strengths, particularly in approval of his handling of terrorism, evaluations of him as a strong leader.  Furthermore, and perhaps most interesting, Bush continues to bridge the gender gap by drawing equal support from men and women.

      Check out the  urlLink "liberal hawks" debate  in Slate.  Since I include myself in this category, let me say that I still think it was the right decision.  Back in March I decided that while I wouldn't have gone to war at the same time and in the same manner as the Bush administration, the status quo in Iraq was no longer tolerable.  Yes, I was wrong about WMD, but I still don't think that the Bush administration engaged in deliberate deception.  At worst, they went with worse case scenarios without acknowledging that they were doing so and without discussing less pessimistic interpretations.  But in the aftermath of 9/11, I think the margin of error for such assessment was vastly narrowed.  Furthermore, the WMD argument was never the clincher for me.  I was always far more persuaded by the humanitarian arguments.  The combination of Saddam Hussein's brutality and UN sanctions had made Iraq into Hell on earth.  I have little doubt that this war saved Iraqi lives.  In addition to the 3000-5000 people Saddam killed in any given year, urlLink the sanctions were increasing the mortality rate of children under 5 by upwards of 50,000 a year .  That's 50,000 dead children every year vs. a high end estimate of 10,000 civil casualties in the war.  I know this some this kind of calculus morbid, but I find 50,000 dead children even worse.  In addition and despite all of the post-war chaos, I remain optimistic about the prospects for Iraq and the region.  Many problems remain, but the economic and security situations are improving.  The same is true politically.  What country in the Arab world has the freest press?  Iraq and . . ., well Iraq.  What country in the Arab world plans on holding free elections in the next 12 to 18 months?  Iraq and . . ., well Iraq.  Finally, for all the Bush administration predictions that didn't come true, I have to say that the critics of the war did even worse.  Even if you include all of the post-war casualties, the cost to the US and the Iraqi civilians was very low.  There have been no humanitarian or ecological disasters.  Very few from the "Arab street" have streamed into Iraq to fight the US invaders or launched terrorist attacks against the US.  Indeed the Arab street has been very quiet since April 9.  Yes the costs have been higher than I predicted, but the benefits still outweigh them by far.

      The new Zogby poll out of Iowa shows what is essentially a 4-way tie.  Kerry, Dean, and Gephardt are all at about 21 percent, while Edwards is at 17 percent, but still in the margin of error.  The race is obviously very fluid, but keep an eye on Edwards.  He got the DM Register endorsement last Sunday and this has a big impact.  In 1988, the Register endorsed Paul Simon, fueling a last minute surge by his campaign.  Yes, he lost, but my recollection is that he picked up around 10 points in a week.  Also, did he really lose?  VNS dropped the ball so  urlLink  we don't know the real results .  I still get mad thinking about it (see my earlier post eulogizing Paul Simon).  Anyway, Edwards not only has the Register endorsement, but the other candidates seem to be intent on cutting each other to pieces, particularly Gephardt vs. Dean, and Dean vs. everybody, including some poor guy from Olewein.    This last point shouldn't be discounted.  Iowans take their caucuses and civility very seriously, and by lashing out at a man who admonished Dean to "love they neighbor" by criticizing Bush less, Dean might have done some real damage to himself.  In fact, I don't think his drop in the polls over the last few days is unrelated to this event.  (As an aside, Dean responded, "Bush isn't my neighbor."  Talk about Biblical literalism!)  Then there's the "sickness" factor.  I grew up in Iowa and my parents still live there, so believe me when I tell you that potential caucus-goers get sick of all the ads, phone calls, surveys, canvassers, etc.  Dean, Gephardt, and Kerry are nearly omnipresent in the state.  Yes, they have to do this, but at some point the return on their efforts diminish to zero or less.  Since Edwards hasn't been quite as visible, he might benefit from any backlash against the other candidates.  Finally, there's the old adage about how to win the caucuses--organize, organize, organize, and then get hot at the end.  Edwards (and perhaps Kerry) are the only candidates who seem to be getting the least bit hot.

      The latest ARG New Hampshire tracking poll has Dean 35, Clark 20, and Kerry 11.  Perhaps more interesting is the fine print.  According to ARG:   Clark is also gaining among undeclared (independent) voters planning to vote in the Democratic primary. As is the case with Democrats, Clark's strength is among older (age 45 and older) voters, while Dean continues to do well among younger voters. Over the past 2 days of calling, a number of older respondents registered as undeclared voters have reported that they have received telephone calls from a campaign informing them that they will not be allowed to vote in the Democratic primary because they missed the deadline to switch parties. A respondent discovered, however, that when she told the caller that she was thinking about voting for Howard Dean, the caller told her that she would be eligible to vote.   Isn't this the type of campaign shenanigans story that reporters love to cover?  Remember the flap about the Bush campaign push-polling against McCain in the 2000 campaign?  I'll be interested to see if this goes further.

      Don't tell my wife, but I got an email yesterday from Madonna.  "Yeah, sure", you say, but it's addressed to me.  Kind of like the time I had a date with Cindy Crawford.  Well, just dinner and a movie.  And then the plane landed.  Anyway, I thought I'd share the email with you (my comments in parentheses):   Dear Philip,  (See, I told you it was addressed to me!)   I've never done this before.   (Coming from Madonna, that's a very short list of things, mostly involving taste and humility)   But life is about taking risks is it not?  (Is emailing me that risky?  Worse than marrying Sean Penn or dating Dennis Rodman?  Riskier than remaking  Swept Away ?)   I know that people seem to pay attention to everything I do. Big or Small.  Ridiculous or Sublime.   ("Seem"??  She thinks we've only been pretending to notice her? And notice the humility, like she's spent the last 20 years trying to stay our of the limelight.  Finally, I'll grant her the ridiculous, but sublime?  That's clearly something she's never done before)   So I am hoping they pay attention to this:  I am supporting General Wesley Clark for President.  Not only as a "celebrity," but as an American citizen and as a mother.    (Why the quotes around celebrity?  Does she intend to signify that she's not really a celebrity?  That it's all somehow a perception and not reality?  Then there's her devotion to American citizenship, which she never expressed better than with her Rock the Vote video wearing a red underwear with the flag draped over her.)    I want my children to grow up with the same opportunities that I had -- to know and understand what's going on in the world and to travel that world safely and with pride. I fear the future I wish for my children is at risk, so I'm taking action.  Please join me.  Our greatest risk is not terrorism, and it's not Iraq or the “Axis of Evil.”  Our greatest risk is a lack of leadership, a lack of honesty and a complete lack of consciousness.   (I'll admit Bush is no genius, but unlike Reagan and except during that pretzel incident, I've never known him to lose consciousness.)   Unfortunately our current government cannot see the big picture.  They think too small. They suffer from the “what's in it for me?” syndrome.   (She obviously wants to people think about what really matters, and ask, like she does, "What's in it for Madonna?")   The simple truth is that the current administration has squandered incredible opportunities to bring the world together, to promote peace in regions that have only known war, to encourage health in places that are ravaged with disease, to make us more secure by living up to our principles at home and abroad.  The simple truth is that the policies of our current administration do not reflect what is great about America.   (Yes, Madonna the great humanitarian.  I remember all those pictures of her visiting Mother Theresa, comforting starving children in her arms.  Oh, wait a minute.  I just lost consciousness.)  Anyway, I could go on, but you get the point.  Why do candidates debase themselves by associating with celebrities?  Wes Clark is a decent and thoughtful man,  but trumpeting this kind of endorsement just makes him seem silly.

      If you needed evidence of Bush's ability to move to the middle early in campaign, Bush's announcement yesterday on illegal aliens provided it.  It was clearly intended to bolster support among Hispanics and he did it despite the complaints of many conservatives.  The Democrats have yet to show up at the Iowa caucuses and Bush is already starting to troll for swing voters.

      There seems to be some confusion in the polls regarding a Dean v. Bush race.  Today's USA Today/CNN poll has Bush ahead 59-37, but a TIME/CNN poll from earlier this week has Bush up by only 5 points, 51-46.  What's going on here?  The USA Today poll has a larger sample size, but not enough to make for that kind of difference.  My guess is that something is amiss in the timing and methodology of the TIME poll.  It was done by Harris Interactive so I'm not sure about the methodology.  Also, the poll was conducted from December 30 to January 1, probably not the best time to reach people at home.  Finally, the TIME poll seems the an outlier when you look at polls over the last month:  CNN/USA Today 1/2-5: Bush 59 Dean 37  TIME/CNN 12/30-1/1: Bush 51 Dean 46  CBS 12/21-22: Bush 55 Dean 35  ABC 12/18-21:  Bush 56 Dean 38  Newsweek 12/18-19: Bush 53 Dean 40  CNN/USA Today 12/15-16: Bush 60 Dean 37  The average Bush margin across each poll, except for the TIME/CNN poll in question is about 15 points.  Also, there seems to have been very little movement over the last month.  I'll need to see more polls before I believe that Dean is competitive with Bush at this point.

      Following up on the claims of E.J. Dionne and others that the Democratic base is unified and that Dean will have enough time to move to the center, here's some info from the latest USA Today poll.  Respondents were asked if they were certain to vote for their candidate or if they might change their mind.  Here are the results for likely voters in a Bush vs. a generic Democrat matchup:  Certain for Bush: 44 Bush, but might change mind: 12 Democrat, but might change mind: 13 Certain for Democrat: 27  This means that going into the election year, Bush has a 17 point advantage among certain voters and his 44 percent puts him in striking distance of the 50 percent needed for victory.  Now here are the numbers for a Bush vs. Dean race:  Certain for Bush: 47 Bush, but might change mind: 12 Dean, but might change mind: 17 Certain for Dean: 20  Bush has better than a 2:1 advantage among certain voters and is nearly at a majority.  That gives him a much better base from which to go after leaning and undecided voters.  Yes, all of this can change, but it indicates the struggle ahead for the Democratic nominee, particularly if it is Howard Dean.

      I've been getting some nasty responses to my suggestion that we follow the examples of the Afghans by amending the Constitution to reserve 25% of the seats in Congress for women.  A couple of points:  First, Afghanistan, a nation hardly known for its commitment to gender equality, still sees fit to think that 25% is the minimum level of adequate representation for women.  But in the US, women only make up 14% of Congress.  Shouldn't we strive to do at least as well as the Afghans?    Second, merely living in Wyoming, Alaska, North Dakota, or several other states guarantees representation in Congress.  Why should we have quotas for arbitrary entities like states, but not for legitimate and recognized groups of citizens?  Third, if gender quotas are such an affront to American values, what about the gender quota at the Republican National Committee?  They currently have a national committeeman and a national committeewoman from each state.  That's a 50% quota.  I'm only asking for half that.  Hey, if it's good enough for the RNC, why isn't it good enough for America?

      According to the NYT, in the new Afghan constitution, "women were given recognition as equal citizens, and 25 percent of the seats of the lower house of Parliament were set aside for them."  Given that there still is no Equal Rights Amendment to the US Constitution and that women only make up about 14 percent of the UA Senate and the House of Representatives, perhaps our own loya jirga is in order, no?

      I'm no fan of Howard Dean, but I must admit that he's getting an unfair rap for his recent comments about race.  Conservative news sites and bloggers, and even some not so conservative ones, are in an uproar about Dean's statement that "dealing with race is about educating white folks."  Mickey Kaus goes off on Dean for not talking about blacks' "culture of poverty and dependence."  But here's the full quote from Dean:  "Dealing with race is about educating white folks," Dean said in an interview Tuesday on a campaign swing through the first primary state where African-American voters will have a major impact. "Not because white people are worse than black people about race but because whites are in the majority, and therefore the behavior of whites has a much bigger influence on hiring practices and so forth and so on than the behavior of African-Americans."  Dean clearly states that whites are not "worse than black people about race."  He is merely stating the obvious.  Since whites make up the vast majority of Americans, racist behavior on their part, even if limited to a small minority, is still going to have a huge effect.  Moreover, I'd go further than Dean and say that the problem of racism in American IS a white problem.  Even if you grant Kaus and others the point that certain behaviors among individual blacks are detrimental or destructive, what is the genesis of those behaviors?  Conservatives and neo-liberals like Kaus seem to assume that blacks came down from Mars the day after the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965.  In their thinking, slavery, Jim Crow, and other manifestations of racism have nothing to do with the current status of black Americans.  Everything comes down the individual choices of blacks, with little or no responsibilty for white individuals or institutions.  This thinking is morally obtuse at best, and racist at worst.

       urlLink James Taranto  makes a good point in today's WSJ--those who argue against the FMA by claiming that it interferes with states' rights are on dangerous ground.  Even if the FMA fails, few states will enact gay marriage.  In order to overcome that hurdle, the only argument is that, despite states' rights in this area, bans on gay marriage violate the equal protection clause of the Constitution.  The better position is that the FMA is discriminatory, not that it violates states' rights.

      Many of those who support the FMA claim that they are doing so only to prevent unelected judges from foisting unpopular decisions on democratic majorities.  "It's not that we oppose gay marriage," amendment proponents seem to be saying, "it's just that we don't like this particular method of achieving them."  I've written elsewhere about the problems associated with judicial activism ("Dwarfing the Political Capacity of the People?: The Relationship Between Judicial Activism and Voter Turnout," 1840-1988.  Polity  25 (Summer 1993): 633-646), so I would have much less of a complaint if they were offering an amendment to scale back the power that courts have to excercise judicial review.  But that's not what's going on here.  The FMA seeks to limit the judicial activism in only one instance--when courts interpret constitutional equal protection provisions in favor of gay and lesbian couples.  That's not principle, that's prejudice.

      Bush's support for an amendment to ban gay marriages is truly appalling.  I've generally been a strong supporter of Bush's foreign policy, but you can't fight oppression abroad when you endorse it at home.  It's as if FDR in 1944 had come out for amending the Constitution to prohibit racial integration at the same time that we were fighting the Nazis.

      Looking for an example of a distinction without a difference?  Check out  urlLink Josh Marshall's  comments on gay marriage.  He says that while he doesn't oppose gay marriage, he doesn't support them.  Huh?  Here's the full quote:   My reason for not supporting gay marriage -- and I think there's a difference between opposing and not supporting, in this case -- is that it seems like a step that would trigger a backlash that would a) quite possibly prevent the adoption even of civil unions and b) provide a tool for conservatives to win elections and thus prevent or turn back various other progressive reforms that are no less important than this one.  (Of course, this hybrid reasoning has all manner of uncomfortable echoes from the middle decades of the 20th century.)   And what exactly are those uncomfortable echoes?  Civil rights, perhaps?  In fact, Marshall sounds exactly like the supposed "pragmatic" liberals, north and south, who opposed civil rights, arguing that they didn't oppose black rights, it's just that they thought the timing was bad and that by pushing too fast on the issue, they were inviting a reaction that might put previous and future gains at risk.    Such reasoning, then and now, strikes me as utterly condescending.  Marshall is putting his own interests ahead of others, even though he's not the one being denied his rights.  Moreover, the earlier example of this reasoning proved utterly wrong.  And in many cases, it was not just wrong--in many cases it was merely a cover for bigots who lacked the courage of their convictions.    Perhaps Marshall should read Martin Luther King's  urlLink  Letter from Birmingham Jail , in which King responds to those earlier voices of pragmatism.  In particular, this passage comes to mind:   We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct-action campaign that was "well timed" in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now I have heard the word "Wait!" It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This "Wait" has almost always meant 'Never." We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that "justice too long delayed is justice denied."

      The sky seems to be falling over the issue of gay marriages at  urlLink NRO's The Corner .  I particularly like this comment by John Derbyshire:   "Can't someone do a citizen's arrest of these law-breaking registrars in San Francisco?  Where on earth are the state authorities?  Where is the Governor?"   Quick Derb, let loose the police dogs and turn on the firehoses before another pair of lesbians in a 50-year relationship gets a civil marriage!  If we let this happen, what's next?  Blacks sitting in at lunch counters?  If the Derb and other NRO'ers would stop hyperventilating for a moment and listen to the stories of those couples getting married in SF, they would realize that these people aren't trying to destroy marriage.  In fact, they hold marriage in great regard, so great that they want what every heterosexual couple can have--legal recognition of their love and commitment to one another.  I was particularly struck by one recently married man intereviewed on NPR who said, "This is what my parents  did."  It didn't sound to me like he wanted to destroy what his parents did, but rather that he wanted to be just as equal and just as normal as his parents.  If people can't see this, then they are blinded by their own bigotry.

       urlLink Mickey Kaus  has this to say about John Edwards:   "And am I the only one who finds Edwards' award-winning spiel--about unemployed workers with "that vacant look, 'What do I do now?'" because "this is what they have done their entire lives and they know nothing else"--a bit condescending? Are these people or sheep? I mean, most Americans these days know there is a risk of unemployment and recession as the economy stumbles forward and that they need to be prepared to switch jobs. This isn't 1955.   Well, that's easy for Kaus to say.  Imagine if suddenly he were out of a job.  Moreover, that all of the jobs for neo-liberal writers were being outsourced to Mexico or India for a fraction of the cost.  Finally, the only available jobs were dismal, low-paying McJobs, or those requiring specialized skills or capabilities, such as the ability to run a machine tool or a strong back and callused hands, that Kaus had little hope of acquiring at his age.    I'd guess he'd have a bit of a vacant look in his eyes.

       Amendment Politics    urlLink Andrew Sullivan  , citing a recent  urlLink Annenberg Center  poll claims that there is limited support for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution banning gay marriage.  I agree with him that such an amendment is an abomination, but I'm not as sanguine about it not passing.  First, he's right that when asked "Would you favor/oppose an amendment to the U.S. Constitution saying that NO state can allow two men to marry each other or two women to marry each other?", the split is only 42 percent in favor and 49 percent opposed.  But that's a very long and convoluted question.  Notice the double negative--oppose an amendment saying no state can allow.  My guess is that a fair number of people were confused by the question.  You can see some evidence for this in the age breakdown of support and opposition:  18-29 Years:  35% favor, 58% oppose 30-44 Years: 48% favor, 42% oppose 45-64 Years: 44% favor, 47% oppose 65+ Years:    38% favor, 53% oppose  I just can't believe that people over the age of 65 are that opposed to this amendment, almost as much as those under the age of 30.  In every other poll I've seen on this issue, the 65+ age group is consistently the most conservative towards gay rights issues.  Indeed, in the same poll they asked people "Do you favor/oppose a law in your state that would allow gays and lesbians to marry a partner of the same sex?"  Here's the age breakdown on that question:  18-29 Years:  50% favor, 43% oppose 30-44 Years: 34% favor, 57% oppose 45-64 Years: 25% favor, 67% oppose 65+ Years:    12% favor, 75% oppose  I doubt very much that people over the age of 65 are that likely to such a constitutionally nuanced position of wanting to ban gay marriage in their state, but not wanting to amend the U.S. Constitution to do likewise.  My guess is that since this group tends to have the lowest education levels, they were the ones most confused by the wording of the first question.    Furthermore, in January, Annenberg asked a much simpler version of the question, "Would you favor or oppose an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would allow marriage ONLY between a man and a woman?"  With that simpler wording, 59 percent approved and 33 percent opposed--quite a different result from the more complicated wording of the first question.  Second, Sullivan also seems to think that you need an overwhelming majority to pass an amendment to the Constitution, but he's overlooking two factors.  The first is intensity of support.  It seems to me that those who want to amend the Constitution are motivated, at least at this point, with an intensity far outstripping the anti-amendment forces.  Elected officials always pay more attention to those who are intensely committed to an issue.    Finally, when it comes to the amendment process, popular support is not equally weighted.  For example, while you need a two-thirds vote to pass an amendment in the Senate, the 68 Senators from the 34 smallest states make up just over 31 percent of the population.  Once past Congress, you need the approval of three-fourths--38-- of the state legislatures.  The 38 smallest states only constitute 40 percent of the population.  Furthermore, Republicans and conservatives are disproportionately represented in these smaller states, making them more likely to favor such an amendment.  But what about the House of Representatives?  Yes, the House is apportioned by population, but given the incredible discipline of the Republican majority, the intensity of those supporting the amendment, and the divisions among Democrats on this issue, it's not inconceivable that you could get a two-thirds of the House in favor of such an amendment.  Needless to say, I don't think passing such an amendment with say 60 percent popular support would be easy or even likely, but it is possible and those who oppose such an amendment will need to organize to stop it.

       NH GOP Primary Again    urlLink Mickey Kaus  points out that the revised figures for the NH GOP primary show Bush with 79% of the vote, not 87%.  Actually, by my math, he got 80%.  (Check for yourself  urlLink here .)  I'm still not convinced that this shows a serious weakness for Bush.  80% is pretty good even if it's lower than Reagan, who sets the gold standard for measuring Republican support.    More worrisome for Bush is that in SC, he's only leading a generic Democrat by a margin of  urlLink 45 to 43 .  I'm skeptical about the exact numbers--Bush won the state by 16 points (57-41)--but it is clearly well below where you would expect him to be.  Furthermore, this is on top of several polls showing his approval rating in the low 50s or below and running behind John Kerry.    Why the lagging polls?  Several things come to mind.  First, the focus on the Democratic nomination has given the Democrats a clear field for the last month--lots of Democratic criticisms and very little Republican response.  I'd be interested to see Reagan's approval and reelect numbers in the first few months of 1984 and Clinton's in 1996.  Second, despite some relatively good GDP numbers, the economy, and jobs in particular, don't seem to be improving very rapidly.  Third, the revelations about no WMDs in Iraq clearly have to be hurting Bush's credibility.

      The  urlLink NYT  has a great article on Florida's felon disenfranchisement laws, describing how ex-felons appear before Governor Jeb Bush to have their voting rights restored.  The story ends as follows:   Things turned out better for Cecil Taylor, who had been convicted of driving drunk and whose college art teacher came to speak of his potential. After the board asked Mr. Taylor if he had drunk alcohol since his conviction, and Mr. Taylor said he had not, Mr. Bush restored his rights — with a caveat.   "I'm praying that you're not going to start drinking again," Mr. Bush told him. "When we make these decisions, sometimes it puts us in a little bit of a precarious position in that you could let us down."   So Jeb is worried about this guy  voting  for president, when his brother, also a convicted drunk driver and self-described alcoholic,  is  the president?        urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      In a speech on Friday,  urlLink Tony Blair  set out to defend the Iraq War and, more importantly, to put forward a new vision of the international community. In doing so, he rejects the principle, going back to the Treaty of Westphalia, that states are sovereign within their own borders.  Instead, he argues that regimes that brutalize their own people forfeit such sovereign rights, not only for human rights reasons, but also because such regimes ultimately threaten the rest of the world.  Here's the key point:   It may well be that under international law as presently constituted, a regime can systematically brutalise and oppress its people  and there is nothing anyone can do, when dialogue, diplomacy and even sanctions fail, unless it comes within the definition of a humanitarian catastrophe (though the 300,000 remains in mass graves already found in Iraq might be thought by some to be something of a catastrophe).  This may be the law, but should it be?  We know now, if we didn't before, that our own self interest is ultimately bound up with the fate of other nations.  The doctrine of international community is no longer a vision of idealism.  It is a practical recognition that just as within a country, citizens who are free, well educated and prosperous tend to be responsible, to feel solidarity with a society in which they have a stake; so do nations that are free, democratic and benefiting from economic progress, tend to be stable and solid partners in the advance of humankind.  The best defence of our security lies in the spread of our values.    But we cannot advance these values except within a framework that recognises their universality.  If it is a global threat, it needs a global response, based on global rules.  The essence of a community is common rights and responsibilities.  We have obligations in relation to each other.  If we are threatened, we have a right to act. And we do not accept in a community that others have a right to oppress and brutalise their people.   We value the freedom and dignity of the human race and each individual in it.   I'll flatter myself by pointing out that I made a  urlLink similar argument  back in January, but  urlLink Blair's speech  is far more thorough and eloquent.  Please read it.

      The editors at the  urlLink National Review  have come out in favor of the following constitutional amendment on gay marriage being sponsored by Orrin Hatch:   "Civil marriage shall be defined in each state by the legislature or the citizens thereof. Nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to require that marriage or its benefits be extended to any union other than that of a man and a woman."   Am I wrong in thinking that such an amendment would overrule  urlLink  Loving v. Virginia  , the 1967 Supreme Court case that overturned state bans on interracial marriage?  The second sentence ( "Nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to require that marriage or its benefits be extended to any union other than that of a man and a woman." ) is clearly intended to prevent courts from using the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to strike down gay marriage bans.  But the first sentence ( "Civil marriage shall be defined in each state by the legislature or the citizens thereof." ) is much broader.  Say, for example that the state legislature in Alabama decides to reimpose its ban on interracial marriage.  Under this amendment, courts would have not constitutional basis for striking down such a ban since state legislatures are given unlimited power in this area.  I can think of two objections to this reasoning.  Some would say that the second sentence, in addition to the first, shows that the authors of the amendment intended only to allow legislatures to bar gay marriage.  But that seems a thin reed since, as conservatives have long pointed out, courts have a habit of reading things in or out of the Constitution.  Other would say that in this day and age, it's impossible that a state legislature or the people of a state would ban interracial marriage.  Perhaps, but in 2000, Alabama held a statewide referendum to remove the ban on interracial marriage in their state constitution.  This ban was, of course, null and void because of  Loving  but the referendum carried only by a margin of 60%-40% and 50% of white Alabamans still voted against the repeal (the data for this conclusion are forthcoming in a paper I'm writing).  Given these figures, I'm not so sanguine about the impossibility of a state banning interracial marriage.

      A wonderful  urlLink Hitchens  piece on the value of gay marriage:   When I become bored or irritated by the gay marriage battle--and I do, I sometimes do--I like to picture the writhing faces and hoarse yells of the mullahs and the fanatics. Godless hedonistic America, not content with allowing divorce and pornography, has taken from us our holy Taliban and our upright Saddam. It sends Jews and unveiled female soldiers to our lands, and soon unnatural brotherhood will be in the armed forces of the infidels. And now the godless have an election where all they discuss is the weddings of men to men and women to women! And then I relax, and smile, and ask my neighbors over, to repay the many drinks and kind gestures that I owe them.   Perhaps a bumper sticker is in order.  Something like, "Gay Marriage:  It's Our Patriotic Duty!"

      Fascinating factoid from tonight's exit polls:  among Democratic primary voters under the age of 30, 61% support gay marriage.  The fight over the FMA is a race against time.  Conservatives want to lock in their opposition to gay marriage before the demographic tide overwhelms them.  Given that the FMA appears to be going nowhere in Congress, it looks like the Republicans have lost the race.

       urlLink Johann Hari  makes a great point about Iraq:   But what are the facts? The Human Rights Centre (HRC) in Kadhimiya has been set up by Iraqis themselves from the ashes of Baathism. They have been going methodically through the massive - and previously unexplored - archives left by the regime, which document every killing in cold bureaucracy-speak. The HRC have found that if the invasion had not happened, Saddam would have killed 70,000 people in the past year. Not sanctions: Saddam's tyranny alone.    "Even once you factor in the war and everybody who has died since, it's not as many people as that," Sama explains. "So this war has indisputably saved lives over the past year. Saddam's victims might not have been appearing on your TV screens, but they would be just as dead."

      The most recent  urlLink WaPo-ABC News poll  has to be encouraging news for the Bush campaign.  The last month has to be one of the worst for Bush since he came into office--gas prices are at historic highs, the 9/11 commission and Richard Clarke raked his administration over the coals, and all Hell broke loose in Iraq.  Nonetheless, Bush actually went up in the poll.  Last month he trailed Kerry 42 to 47, but this month he's back on top 47 to 42.  That's a net swing of 10 points.  Plus, he's now leading Kerry in just about every issue area. On handling the economy, last month he trailed, 53-41, now it's tied 47-47. On Iraq, last month it was Kerry 48-47, now it is Bush 52-41.

       urlLink John Maginnis  of the New Orleans Times-Picayune takes exception to the results of my recent co-authored  urlLink study  on the Duke vote in last year's Louisiana gubernatorial election.      Yet comparative vote totals don't tell the whole story. The study discounts ideology as a factor, especially in the Duke parishes, because Jindal and Terrell were both conservative Republicans. But that view overlooks the other side of the equation. It is reasonable to suggest that more rural conservatives voted for Blanco and not Landrieu because Blanco is more conservative than Landrieu. Terrell and the Republicans beat up on Landrieu for her tax votes and her abortion-rights stand. By contrast, Jindal did not lay a glove on Blanco, who protected her right flank on abortion, gun control and taxes while blasting Jindal on health care. Also, Blanco ran a better organized, more aggressive campaign in rural areas than did Jindal, Terrell or Landrieu.    Had a more liberal Democrat made the runoff, say, Buddy Leach, more conservatives, even in north Louisiana, could have gotten past Jindal's hue and voted for him, or just stayed home.   These criticisms seem misplaced.  First, we did control for ideology.  Our study looked at income levels to see if the Duke vote might have, in fact, been a economic populist vote.  But even when you control for income, the Duke vote still went for Blanco over Jindal.  And second, of course it helped that Blanco was a conservative Dem.  Not all Duke voters went for Blanco and fewer would have  if she were more liberal, but many of them did.  But what's more interesting is why they did when other conservative and Republican voters didn't.  Jindal did very well among Republicans in the New Orleans suburbs, but not in the northern parishes were Duke ran best.  What possible reason, other than race, might explain this difference in voting patterns?  Maginnis goes on to add:   What makes people sensitive to the conclusions of the New York professors is the implication that the 671,000 people who voted for David Duke were racists. Surely, many were, but many others were adamantly anti-Edwards, and antipathy toward him ran deepest in rural north Louisiana. The message on the famous bumper sticker notwithstanding, it was more important for them to vote against "the crook."   Louisianans surely faced a Hobson's choice between Duke and Edwards, but just how many voters said, "I know Duke is a racist and a Nazi, and I find that repellent, but he's still the better of the two candidates?"  Does this mean that every last one of Duke's 671,000 voters was a racist?  I don't know, but if a vote for David Duke isn't an expression of racism, then what is?       urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      This from the  urlLink LA Times    Abizaid, who is directing the war in Iraq, ordered commanders this week to craft plans in case conditions worsened and he called for more troops. As of Wednesday, he had not made that request of Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, Pentagon spokesman Lawrence Di Rita said.     There are now 135,000 U.S. troops in Iraq, 20,000 more than called for under the current Pentagon plan because new units have arrived before those they are replacing have left.     But some soldiers who planned to depart soon have been ordered to remain on duty, Di Rita said. "At this moment, they're being used in combat activities," he said.     Asked if their yearlong tours of duty had been extended, he said, "Not yet."     In a briefing to Pentagon reporters Wednesday, however, Rumsfeld signaled that extensions were likely.     "We're taking advantage of that [temporary troop] increase, and we will likely be managing the pace of the redeployments to allow those seasoned troops with experience and relationships with the local populations to see the current situation through," he said.

        Tet Redux?   I am obviously surprised, depressed, and concerned over the upsurge in violence.  Ironically, just days before the Fallouja attacks, I noticed that the number of soldiers killed over the last two months had dropped significantly and thought that perhaps we had turned a corner.  Well, so much for that.  I have no knowledge beyond what I read in the papers, so I have no idea of the severity of the situation.  Let's hope that the violence is limited to Sadr and his followers and this isn't or doesn't develop into a general revolt by the majority of Sunnis.  If that is the case, this may be a good thing in the long run since it will eliminate an extremist element in advance of the transition to Iraqi sovereignty.  If this isn't the case, then it's hard to see how things won't spiral out of control.  Regarding the domestic impact of all of this, I can't help but to draw comparisons to the Tet Offensive of 1968.  By mounting numerous and well-coordinated attacks throughout South Vietnam, the North Vietnamese and their Viet Cong allies put the lie to the Johnson administration claims that we were winning the war.  Yes, I know that we eventually prevailed, that Tet was an unmitigated military disaster for the communists, and that these attacks are very small in comparison, but Tet destroyed what remained of the Johnson administration's credibility and turned U.S. public opinion against the war.    I'd guess that these attacks will likely have a similar impact.  They will clearly cause a big hit to Bush's already low approval ratings, especially on his handling of the Iraq situation.  We will also see sizeable drops in the percentage of people who think invading Iraq was the right thing and a corresponding increase in those who would like us to withdraw our troops as soon as possible.    In this situation, a hasty retreat from Iraq would be a disaster.  After we pulled out of Somalia, bin Laden and other terrorists were emboldened by their belief that the U.S. lacked the will to fight after only a few casualties.  Furthermore, if we were to leave Iraq too soon, the country would obviously slip into the worst sort of chaos and become a breeding ground for terrorist organizations.    In the short run, we need more troops in Iraq.  It's been clear since the invasion that we've had too few troops on the ground.  Yes, we won a quick and clear victory, but the margin of error was much too small.  Even more importantly, trying to control 25 million people in a country the size of California with only 130,000 troops is an obviously impossible task.  With so few troops we had limited ability to stop the looting immediately after the war and limited ability to crush the Baathist die-hards before that grew into a full-fledged insurgency. Donald Rumsfeld seems to have resisted the extra troops just to prove a point about how he could transform the military and thus, more than anyone else in the administration, he's responsible for the current mess.  It's time for him to go.  In the long run, we need to stick things out.  We've made a commitment to build a stable and democratic Iraq, and we should do that.  Failing in that mission means that we'll just have to fight that battle again and at greater cost.    My fear is that if elected, Kerry and the Democrats will look for exits as quickly as possible, arguing that Bush, in Kerry's words, has f*cked things up so badly that they had no other option.  I'd be interested to hear what Democrats like Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and Carl Levin have to say about what should be done.       urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      Many thanks to Adam Nossiter of the AP for running a  urlLink story  based on the  urlLink article  I co-authored on last year's Lousiana gubernatorial election.  Of course, some people took a less charitable view of our study.  Here's one response that was forwarded to me:   You ever notice these "studies" are only used against whites. Where are these studies showing the racial bigotry of black voters? Let us have butt-kissing, liberal political scientists do studies on how it is that crackhead Marion Barry got elected or Al Sharpton pulled in black votes or various racist "Black Caucus" members who are elected officials of the Democrat or rather The Anti-White Party. These studies are another fraud to derail whites and make a mockery of them. These cowards who conduct such studies NEVER seem to come around to studying voting habits of hispanics or blacks. As usual, of course, you can bet the RANCH these white cowards NEVER live in black or hispanic neighborhoods in 99% of cases.  As far as the "Duke" voters go, it shows they are a force and that they vote. Personally, I would not ALWAYS vote for the white candidate. Many white candidates are the reason we are in the mess we are in. However, most non-white politicians are anti-white, anti-American, money sucking, police hating dogs. However, once in a blue moon, that is not the case.  I laugh at the GOP though. They have to play this game with David Duke where they wag the finger at him but LOVE his voters. They know quite well he has huge support in a place like Lousiana. They LOVE the fact he registered so many new Republican voters. But the Stupid Party loves to embrace minority voters who give them 10% of their vote. Maybe this is done so one day the New York Times will actually pat them on their head. They are not called the Stupid Party for nothing        urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      In today's WSJ  urlLink "Best of the Web"  section, James Taranto comments that Mel Gibson's  The Passion  is a hit among Palestinians for its negative portrayal of Jews.  No surprise there, but Taranto then adds:   Still, even if the complaints are valid, we can't help but wonder if Jewish groups were imprudent to air them so vigorously. Absent the controversy that ensued, the Arabs might never have had any interest in "The Passion."   So when a major Hollywood star makes a multi-million dollar film that traffics in anti-semitic stereotypes, and said film is popular among Palestinians, who's to blame?  The Jews, of course.         urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I was just looking over the state by state polls at  urlLink DC Political Report .  Of course, these need to be taken with a grain of salt this early in the race, but the results are intriguing nonetheless.  Right now, most states are leaning in the same direction that they went in 2000.  But there are exceptions.  One state for Gore, Wisconsin, now has a Bush lead beyond the margin of error.  No Bush 2000 states show a lead for Kerry.  Four Bush states (AR, FL, NH, and OH) with 57 electoral votes are too close to call.  Seven Gore states (CA, OR, WA, NM, IA, MI, and PA) with 123 electoral votes are too close to call.  These state polls are often dicey and events on the ground can change things quickly, but it's interesting that with Bush and Kerry neck and neck in the popular vote nationally, the state polls suggest a shift toward Bush.

      I'm finding the recent flap over whether or not John Kerry should receive communion in the Catholic Church rather interesting and ironic.  As a lapsed/alienated Catholic, I actually come down on the side of Catholic conservatives on this one.  It seems to me that a central aspect of any religion is to decide what are its central tenets and who is or isn't a believer, based on those tenets.  Don't get me wrong--I wish the Church would rethink some of those tenets, but it's not my place to tell the Catholic Church what it can and can't do regarding its own rituals and observances.  If John Kerry or any other Catholic politician differs significantly with the Church's teachings, why don't they just honestly say so and then find a different church?    It seems that both sides in this debate want to avoid a massive self-inflicted wound.  If the Church started to deny communion to pro-choice adherents, politicians and otherwise, they would risk a schism.  Likewise, if pro-choice politicians fessed up that they no longer believed in some of the central beliefs of the Church and were therefore leaving, they would risk alienating Catholic voters.  Unfortunately, the result is hypocrisy all around with both sides pretending to believe in something they don't.

      In today's  urlLink column  David Brooks buys into the idea that the U.S. is rapidly segregating into political islands:   "The political result is that Republican places become more Republican and Democratic places become more Democratic.   Between 1948 and 1976, most counties in the U.S. became more closely divided between Republicans and Democrats. In 1976, Gerald Ford, a Republican, could win most of New England and the entire Pacific coast, and he almost won New York.   But since then we've been segregating politically. As Bill Bishop of The Austin American-Statesman has found, the number of counties where one party or another has a landslide majority has doubled over the past quarter-century. Whole regions are now solidly Democratic or Republican. Nearly three-quarters of us, according to Bishop, live in counties that are becoming less competitive, and many of us find ourselves living in places that are overwhelmingly liberal or overwhelmingly conservative.   But as I show in my article,  urlLink  "Red and Blue Scare"  , there's not much evidence to back up these claims.  First, it's true that the number of landslide counties has doubled, but this is only if you look at the two-party vote. By excluding the votes of third-party candidates, you artificially raise the number of landslide counties. Looking only at the absolute percentage of the vote, only about 36 percent of the voters in the 2000 election lived in these counties. To be sure, this percent is higher than in 1976, another close election when only 27 percent of voters lived in landslide counties, but the difference is not huge. Furthermore, other measures of political segregation show that most Americans live in relatively diverse areas where they have a great deal of interaction with  members of the opposite political party.  Finally, there's no evidence for Brooks's claim that the trend toward greater political segregation (such as it is) is self-reinforcing.  If this were true, the Solid South would be more solid than ever.  Indeed, the United States would have long ago divided permanently into the two separate and exclusive political camps that Brooks prophesizes.

      Following up on my recent claim that recent reports of increasing polarization are greatly overstated, Rhodes Cook has a terrific  urlLink piece  in yesterday's Washington Post pointing out that the portion of voters not registering with either political party has increased significantly in recent years:   "In the 27 states (plus the District of Columbia) that have been registering voters by party since 1987, the Democratic share has plummeted 8 percentage points, declining from an aggregate total of 51 percent to 43 percent. The Republican share has stayed steady at 33 percent. But the proportion of voters who have not identified themselves with either of the major parties has jumped 8 percentage points, from 16 to 24 percent."   Of course, party registration is not the same as party identification (what party people identify with as opposed to the party they are registered with) and various surveys show that party identification has become a stronger predictor or voting behavior.  Still, Cook is on to something here.

      Christopher Hitchens strikes the first  urlLink blow  against Michael Moore.  Here's just a sample:   "If Michael Moore had had his way, Slobodan Milosevic would still be the big man in a starved and tyrannical Serbia. Bosnia and Kosovo would have been cleansed and annexed. If Michael Moore had been listened to, Afghanistan would still be under Taliban rule, and Kuwait would have remained part of Iraq. And Iraq itself would still be the personal property of a psychopathic crime family, bargaining covertly with the slave state of North Korea for WMD. You might hope that a retrospective awareness of this kind would induce a little modesty. To the contrary, it is employed to pump air into one of the great sagging blimps of our sorry, mediocre, celeb-rotten culture. Rock the vote, indeed."   Will Moore respond?  If so, will it involve lawyers?  Stay tuned!

      According to  urlLink ABC News , the kidnappers of Paul Johnson:   "had help from sympathizers within the Saudi security forces, according to an account of the operation posted by the al-Qaida cell on an Islamic extremist Web site Sunday. The sympathizers gave police uniforms to the militants, who then snatched the American engineer at a fake checkpoint in the city, the posting said."   If this is true (you can't believe everything you read on Islamic extremist Web site), then it raises several possibilities:  1. The Saudi security forces are riddled with Islamic sympathizers.  2. The Saudi security forces infiltrated the Al Qaeda cell that kidnapped Johnson, perhaps even using Johnson as bait to capture or eliminate the cell.  That explains why they managed to kill the cell leaders only hours after Johnson was beheaded.  3. All of the above.

      Juan Williams must have been sipping the Kool-Aid over at Fox News.  He's got an  urlLink op-ed  in today's NYT arguing that  "President Bush could win at least 20 percent  of the black vote and the White House."   In the immortal words of Wayne Campbell, "Yeah, and monkeys might fly out of my butt."  Twenty percent would be double the 10 percent Bush got in 2000 and more than any Republican presidential candidate since Richard Nixon in 1960.  Williams points to a 2002 survey showing a decrease in Democratic party identification among black voters.  But 2002 was the high tide of Bush's popularity.  9/11 was still a strong memory and the controversies over Iraq had yet to assert themselves.  More recent polls show that black voters are strongly critical of the Bush administration.  According to the latest Washington Post  urlLink poll , only  12 percent  of black approve of Bush's overall job as president, only  11 percent  approve of his handling of the economy, only  6(!) percent  approve of his handling of Iraq.  Overall, only  6(!!) percent  of blacks say that they would vote for Bush for president this fall.  This number is even lower than the abysmal 10 percent of the black vote that Bush received in 2000.  In fact, this number is so low that it is statistically indistinguishable from zero!  Of course, Williams claims that this could all change if Bush were to start visiting black churches.  But that's like saying that if Kerry were to visit Bob Jones University he could double his support among white evangelicals.    Since at least the 1970s, and probably before, commentators have been expounding on how the GOP could gain a larger share of the black vote, but it's never happened.  Remember how people thought their 2000 convention would boost Republicans among black voters?  Didn't quite work out that way, did it?  The real issue is not how the GOP can get black votes, but why pundits keep making these predictions despite all the evidence to the contrary.

      The LA Times has an excellent  urlLink electoral vote tracker.   Unlike most, they actually plug in the latest state polling data.  Based on these polls and previous voting history, Bush would carry every state that he won in 2000, except OH and WV.  Kerry would win all of the Gore states except for NM and WI.  NH is tied between the two.  Even without NH, that gives Kerry 270 electoral votes--the minimum necessary to win.

      I hate to jump on the Brooks bashing  urlLink bandwagon , but in today's  urlLink column  he makes this claim:   "Republicans still have an advantage the higher you go up the income scale, but the correlation between income and voting patterns is weaker."   Well, not quite.  Here are the correlations between income and Democratic vote for president from 1948 to 2000 (strongly negative numbers mean that higher income groups were less likely to vote Democratic than lower income groups):  1948: -.21 1952: -.06 1956: -.06 1960: -.02 1964: -.13 1968: -.03 1972: -.11 1976: -.19 1980: -.19 1984: -.23 1988: -.16 1992: -.17 1996: -.19 2000: -.14  First, it should be noted that the even the strongest correlation (-.23) is pretty weak, given that correlations can run from -1.0 to +1.0.  Furthermore, the correlation has weakened since 1984 (Reagan v. Mondale), but the results for 2000 are still stronger than for any election from 1952 to 1972.  These numbers, however, are a bit skewed by the fact that blacks (who disproportionately reside at the lower income levels) vote so heavily Democratic.  Here are the numbers for whites:  1948: -.22 1952: -.05 1956: -.06 1960: -.01 1964: -.11 1968: +.01 1972: -.05 1976: -.14 1980: -.13 1984: -.17 1988: -.07 1992: -.13 1996: -.13 2000: -.09  As this shows, among whites, class had more influence on white voting in 2000 than in 1988.  Note: All data are from the National Election Study.

      The  urlLink NYT  has a story on the emerging feud between the Reagans and the Bushes.  The story quotes Ron Jr.'s criticism of GWB in an interview with Salon magazine last year:   "The Bush people have no right to speak for my father, particularly because of the position he's in now," Mr. Reagan said then. "Yes, some of the current policies are an extension of the 80's. But the overall thrust of this administration is not my father's - these people are overly reaching, overly aggressive, overly secretive and just plain corrupt. I don't trust these people."   Unfortunately, as a family newspaper, the  Times  discretely chose not to include the following quote from the same interview:   But my father was a man -- that's the difference between him and Bush. To paraphrase Jack Palance, my father crapped bigger ones than George Bush."

      Heres a link to an  urlLink article  I just published on the Red v. Blue divide.  In it, I argue that despite often breathless claims in the media, there is little evidence to suggest that the United States is becoming increasingly segregated along political lines. Most Americans continue to live in electorally competitive areas and where they have a great deal of exposure to members of the other party.  In particular, I take apart many of the claims set out in the recent  urlLink Austin  American-Statesman   report on political segregation.

       "Dad was also a deeply, unabashedly religious man," Ron Reagan Jr. said before the final homily. "But he never made the fatal mistake of so many politicians - wearing his faith on his sleeve to gain political advantage. True, after he was shot and nearly killed early in his presidency he came to believe that God had spared him in order that he might do good. But he accepted that as a responsibility, not a mandate. And there is a profound difference."   Hmmm, I wonder whom he could be thinking of?

      Today's  urlLink Washington Post  has a great story about the Republican's latest plan to turn out the vote of religious conservatives:   The American Jobs Creation Act, introduced Friday by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Thomas (R-Calif.), is scheduled for markup Thursday and a vote on the House floor next week. The bill's main purpose is to cut the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 32 percent and provide other tax relief to businesses, in return for repealing subsidies that have triggered European sanctions on U.S. farmers and manufacturers.    But on page 378 of the bill is a provision entitled "Safe Harbor for Churches." It would allow clergy members to engage in political activity, including endorsing candidates, as long as they make clear that they are acting as private citizens and not on behalf of their religious organizations. They could not make partisan political statements in church publications, at church functions or using church funds.   Sounds like the bill sort of sums up the GOP's domestic policy.  The bill also includes a provision that  "would allow clergy members to commit three "unintentional violations" of the tax rules on political activity each year without risking the loss of tax-exempt status."   Three violations?  One for the primary election, one for the general election, and one to spare.

      The LA Times has a new  urlLink poll  tonight and, overall, it's pretty bad news for Bush.  He's trailing Kerry 51-44, the first time I've seen Kerry over 50 percent since just after he captured the Democratic nomination.  Even with Nader in the race, Kerry leads by 6 points, 48-42.  Both results are outside of the margin of error (+/- 3)  Kerry is also starting to catch up to Bush on questions like whether he'd be a strong leader and nearly 60 percent in the poll thought the country was on the wrong track, the highest ever since Bush become president.  The poll was conducted from Saturday to Tuesday, a time that should have been pretty good for Bush--he was visiting Normandy, the Iraq transition was going well, and the country was awash in Reagan nostalgia.  The only silver linings for Bush are that his overall approval rating is 50 percent and he's running well against Kerry in the swing states of Missouri, Ohio, and Wisconsin.  Unfortunately, the LA Times didn't include a detailed breakdown of the questions.

      In yesterday's  urlLink WSJ  James Taranto provides the following analysis of black voting behavior:   What's fascinating about this is that in the century between the abolition of slavery and the establishment of civil rights, changes in black political behavior more or less tracked changes in the political behavior of the country as a whole. As blacks voted Republican in the postbellum period, so did the country; FDR was the first Democrat in 80 years to win the presidency with a majority of the popular vote. Blacks became more Democratic with FDR's ascendancy, and so did the country. And when blacks voted overwhelmingly against Goldwater, the country did too. Black voting patterns differed from those of whites, but they generally moved in the same directions.  Since 1964, by contrast, the country has become more Republican. The GOP has won six of nine presidential elections starting in 1968. After the 1964 elections, Democrats held a 68-32 majority in the Senate and 295-140 in the House. Today    Republicans hold majorities of 51-49 and 227-208 (counting two left-leaning Vermont independents as Democrats). Yet while the Republican Party has been ascendant, it has gotten virtually no black support.  The result is a sort of political segregation. To judge by voting patterns, blacks perceive their political interests and identities in a way vastly different than other Americans do. And, curiously, this trend dates almost precisely to the extension of full political rights to blacks (Congress passed the Voting Rights Act in 1965). The reasons why this may be the case are a topic for another time, but it shouldn't be considered racist or insensitive to talk about it.   Where to begin?  First, black voting has tracked with national voting patterns in only the most superficial ways.  Yes, blacks did vote Republican from the 1870s to the 1930s and, yes, Republicans won most of those elections, but most of them were very close while blacks were voting overwhelmingly for the GOP.  Second, and relatedly, blacks have almost always been politically segregated.  Until the 1930s, not only did the Democratic party not want black votes, but it constructed itself in large part around white supremacy.  And after 1890, the Republicans gave only the most superficial support to black interests.  This all changed with FDR as blacks move en masse from the GOP to the Democrats.  From 1936 to 1960, the Democrats never did worse than 60 percent of the black vote.  Since 1964, they've never dropped below 80 percent.  I'd even argue that, like the post-bellum Democrats, racial conservatism is an integral part of the Republican coalition.  The more interesting conclusion to draw from this analysis is that except for two brief periods (1864-1872 and 1964), the parties have often paid an electoral penalty for strongly advocating black rights.

       urlLink Andrew Sullivan  has a lengthy quote from Ronald Reagan from his debate with Robert Kennedy in 1967.  Here's a short extract:   I happen to believe that the greatest part of the problem lies in the hearts of men. I think that bigotry and prejudice is probably the worst of all man's ills the hardest to correct... Now we've found it necessary to legislate, to make it more possible for government to exert its responsibility to guarantee those constitutional rights. At the same time, we have much more that can be done in the area of just human relationships. I happen to bridge a time span in which I was a radio sports announcer for major league sports in our country, in athletics, many years ago. At that time the great American game of baseball had a rulebook whose opening line was: "Baseball is a game for Caucasian gentlemen." And up until that time, up until World War II, there'd never been a Negro play in organized major league or minor league baseball in America. And one man defied that rule--a man named Branch Rickey of one of the major league teams, and today baseball is far better off and our country is far better off because he destroyed that by handpicking one man and putting him on his baseball team, and the rule disappeared. Now I don't say this is the only answer, but we must use both, and I think the people in positions like ourselves like the Senator and myself, like the President of the United States, can do a great deal of good, perhaps almost as much as proper legislation, if we take the lead in saying those who operate their businesses or their lives on a basis of practicing discrimination and prejudice are practicing what is an evil sickness. And that we would not knowingly patronize a business that did such a thing, and we urge all right-thinking people to join us and not patronize that business. Soon we will make those who live by prejudice learn that they stand alone ..."   Sullivan claims that the quote proves Reagan was not a racist.  But le'ts put Reagan's words into context.    --Reagan said this 3 years after he opposed passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the law that barred segregation in public facilities and discrimination in education and hiring.    --When Reagan spoke these words, he actively opposed passage of the Open Housing Act, a measure that would bar discrimination in the sale and rental of housing.  Indeed, his role in helping defeat a similar statewide measure in California in 1964 helped to launch him into politics.    --In 1980, he kicked off his presidential campaign in Philadelphia, Mississippi, where in 1964 the local Klan killed three civil rights workers.  Not only did Reagan not mention this event, he told his audience, "I believe in states' rights."  --As President, Reagan cut funding for civil rights enforcement and opposed a Martin Luther King holiday.    I don't know if Reagan was a racist in his heart, but by his actions he did little or nothing to help remove the stain of racism.  Finally, praising Branch Rickey is all well and good, but it seems to me that he might have found a way to mention Jackie Robinson--I seem to remember that he had something to do with integrating baseball.

      The latest  urlLink Gallup  poll has some interesting results from its state-by-state breakdowns.  Gallup breaks them down into Blue, Red, and Purple states, corresponding to the margin of victory in 2000.  The results are in the table below:       Blue  (Gore>5%)  Red  (Bush>5%)  Purple  (Bush or Gore    w/o Nader  +20  -4  +5    w/Nader  +15  -6  +2              2000 Results  +15  -16  0     As the table shows, Kerry is running as well as Gore did in the Blue states and a bit ahead of him in the Purple states.  Bush, however, is running significantly behind his 2000 numbers in the Red states.   This seems a bit odd, since Kerry seems to be doing better in the Red states than in the Purple states.  Perhaps this is a result of the Bush campaign focusing their attacks in the Purple states and thereby holding down Kerry's margin there.  It might also suggest that many Red state voters will eventually come home to Bush, thereby picking up his national margins.

      The Annenberge National Election Survey has just released the  urlLink results  from their poll.  In it, they did a very large national survey (n=8314) with a sub-sample of battleground states (n=3418) and of "persuadable" voters in those battleground states (n=832).  Samples this large allow them to analyze that last category--persuadable voters in the battleground states.  Such an effort is all to the good, since, as they point out, this is where the campaign is currently focused.   urlLink Ruy Teixeira  and  urlLink Andrew Sullivan  argue that the data show trouble for Bush.    That's true, but only to an extent.  First, the diffence in Bush's approval rating between the persuadables and all battleground state voters (44% vs. 47%) is not statistically significant.  Second, these persuadables are a notoriously ficke and disengaged bunch.  They have lower levels of education (54% with a HS diploma or less vs. 49% of all battleground voters), they are less likely to be registered to vote (68% vs. 79%), less likely to follow the campaign closely (54% vs. 69%), and less likely to have voted in 2000 (59% vs. 70%).    Given this, I'm not sure what sorts of conclusions we can draw about what these persuadables will do in November or what impact it will have on the election.

      Ronald Reagan's death has set off a deluge of praise for the man and his presidency. Much of this revolves around his role in ending the Cold War.  Reagan was surely right that the Soviet Union was an "evil empire" and he was prescient in his prediction that it would end up on the "dustbin of history" when most "experts" (myself included) thought it impossible.  Nonetheless, his bellicose rhetoric and policies were risky in the extreme, so just to keep things in perspective, here's a  urlLink report  on how the U.S. and the Soviet Union almost went to nuclear war in the fall of 1983.     It was just past midnight as Stanislav Petrov settled into the commander's chair inside the secret bunker at Serpukhov-15, the installation where the Soviet Union monitored its early-warning satellites over the United States.      Then the alarms went off. On the panel in front him was a red pulsating button. One word flashed: "Start."    It was Sept. 26, 1983, and Petrov was playing a principal role in one of the most harrowing incidents of the nuclear age, a false alarm signaling a U.S. missile attack. . . .  As Petrov described it in an interview, one of the Soviet satellites sent a signal to the bunker that a nuclear missile attack was underway. The warning system's computer, weighing the signal against static, concluded that a missile had been launched from a base in the United States.      The responsibility fell to Petrov, then a 44-year-old lieutenant colonel, to make a decision: Was it for real?      Petrov was situated at a critical point in the chain of command, overseeing a staff that monitored incoming signals from the satellites. He reported to superiors at warning-system headquarters; they, in turn, reported to the general staff, which would consult with Soviet leader Yuri Andropov on the possibility of launching a retaliatory attack.      Petrov's role was to evaluate the incoming data. At first, the satellite reported that one missile had been launched – then another, and another. Soon, the system was "roaring," he recalled – five Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles had been launched, it reported.      Despite the electronic evidence, Petrov decided – and advised the others – that the satellite alert was a false alarm, a call that may have averted a nuclear holocaust.    The story goes on to add:   It is not known what happened at the highest levels of the Kremlin on the night of the alarm, but it came at a climactic stage in U.S.-Soviet relations that is now regarded as a Soviet "war scare." According to former CIA analyst Peter Pry, and a separate study by the agency, Andropov was obsessed with the possibility of a surprise nuclear attack by the West and sent instructions to Soviet spies around the world to look for evidence of preparations.      One reason for Soviet jitters at the time was that the West had unleashed a series of psychological warfare exercises aimed at Moscow, including naval maneuvers into forward areas near Soviet strategic bastions, such as the submarine bases in the Barents Sea.    The 1983 alarm also came just weeks after Soviet pilots had shot down Korean Air Lines Flight 007 and just before the start of a NATO military exercise, known as Able Archer, that involved raising alert levels of U.S. nuclear forces in Europe to simulate preparations for an attack. Pry has described this exercise as "probably the single most dangerous incident of the early 1980s."

      Is  urlLink this  the liberal?   During the interview, he eschewed the soaring rhetoric on freedom and democracy . . . . At one point, he stumbled over the words when he tried to emphasize his interest in promoting American values: "The idea of America is, I think proudly and chauvinistically, the best idea that we've developed in this world."   Or is it  urlLink this ?   "We believe that societies find their greatness by encouraging the creative gifts of their people, not in controlling their lives and feeding their resentments.  And we have confidence that people share this vision of dignity and freedom in every culture because liberty is not the invention of Western culture, liberty is the deepest need and hope of all humanity.  The vast majority of men and women in Muslim societies reject the domination of extremists like Osama bin Laden.  They're looking to the world's free nations to support them in their struggle against the violent minority who want to impose a future of darkness across the Middle East.  We will not abandon them to the designs of evil men.  We will stand with the people of that region as they seek their future in freedom."

      Listening to the Democratic convention and Kerry's speech in particular made me realize how much Ronald Reagan and his ideas continue to shape the American political landscape.  Sure, the differences are there, but the key themes in Kerry's speech were patriotism, military strength, families, values, faith, and tax cuts.  Sounds like Reagan to me.

       Newsday  has my  urlLink take  on the legacy of the 9/11 commission.  Here's the gist of it:   "Why do these commissions usually fail in their task to bring consensus? One reason is that any commission, no matter how thorough and comprehensive, can't examine every piece of evidence. Indeed, new evidence often comes to light only long after these commissions complete their work. In other cases, the evidence will never be known. Oswald and the 9/11 hijackers took their thoughts to the grave. And into this vacuum of ignorance steps what historian Richard Hofstadter called "the paranoid style" of U.S. politics.   Many have always seen conspiracies lurking beneath the surface of American politics, but such thoughts are particularly evident in the wake of tragic events, as though something as horrible as 9/11 can only be the result of dark forces. Given this, the 9/11 report will not mark the end of, but just another stage in what will surely be an enduring controversy."

      Alan Wolfe is the  urlLink Chance the Gardener  of the contemporary academic/pundit class.  Though moving from left to center over the last few decades, Wolfe has remained consistent in the superficiality of his analysis.  (Here's my take on his book,  urlLink  One Nation After All  .)  His op-ed in today's  urlLink LA Times  is typical.  Here it is with my comments in italics:  American politics are more partisan than ever. The American people distrust partisanship more than ever. The conflict between these two forces is as important to the election of 2004 as the contest between Republicans and Democrats.   One of the clearest measures of partisanship is the dollars that candidates can raise. By that measure, the big surprise of the current election is that Democrats can be as partisan as Republicans, since John Kerry has surprised those who thought that he would run out of cash long before the Democratic convention. Instead, his party, much like its opponent, is getting its wealthy supporters to put their money where their mouths are.    Why is fundraising a measure of partisanship?  Howard Dean raised lots of money by attacking the Democratic party establishment.  Also, plenty of less "partisan" candidates have done fine with fundraising.  What about Bill Clinton?  He never lacked for money, but he consciously triangulated between the parties.  Also, is Kerry getting his money from wealthy supporters or is the increase coming from small donors?    Party unity is a second indication of partisanship, and here as well the two parties are geared for battle. Republicans have a reputation for discipline, but no Republican has been as single-minded about making his colleagues toe the line as George W. Bush; he even has John McCain appearing in his ads.    I hardly think John McCain has been coerced into supporting Bush's reelection bid.  I don't have a very high opinion of Karl Rove, but I'd guess that when it comes to making McCain talk, he can't succeed where the North Vietnamese failed.  The real and obvious reason for McCain's support of Bush is that like the President, he is a staunch and consistent advocate of the war on terror and the Iraq invasion.  If you look at the ads, you can see that McCain's praise of Bush is specifically about his wartime leadership.  Plus, if McCain has been forced to "toe the line," why did he vote against the FMA in the Senate last week?   Yet it is the Democrats who are more unified than ever. Liberal activists by the score are disdaining independent candidate Ralph Nader.    Nader is polling around 2-5% of the vote. That's better than he did in the 2000 election and about where he polled in July of that year.   The left and right factions within the party are suppressing their differences over gay rights or Iraq to present a common front.  Unlike in the days of comedian Will Rogers, a person can now say, "I belong to an organized party; I'm a Democrat."    Since when did the Democrats not try to present a common front on controversial issues?  They haven't exactly been tripping over themselves in recent years to advance a pro-gay rights agenda.    In addition, the parties have stopped treating each other by Marquis of Queensbury rules. The majority in many state legislatures draws district lines to ensure seats for itself.     Again, is this something new?   Time-honored traditions in Congress — such as bipartisan membership on conference committees — have been set aside. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Republican leader Tom DeLay do not just dislike each other; each thinks the other a danger to the Republic.   And of course partisanship can be found in the fact that Republicans and Democrats hold different positions on many issues of the day. If you want a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, you're a Republican partisan; if you want to prevent the Supreme Court from overturning Roe vs. Wade, you're with the other guys. True, Kerry has been careful not to distance himself too much from Bush on Iraq. But this is not Tweedledum and Tweedledee's election.    Hold the presses!  Democrats and Republicans "hold different positions on many issues of the day"!  Thanks for that brilliant insight, Professor Wolfe.  Isn't one of the things that separates Democrats from Republicans the fact that they disagree on certain issues?  Also, support or opposition to an amendment barring gay marriage is hardly an exact predictor of partisanship.  According to a Washington Post poll in March, 54% of Republican supported such an amendment compared to 36% of Democrats and 40% of independents.  That's not a huge partisan difference.   Yet while the partisans are in full fury, a lot of other Americans do not like politics, and they like partisan politics even less. This is especially true when it comes to the famed wedge issues. The Republicans and the Democrats may disagree zealously over whether the Constitution should be amended to ban gay marriage, but most Americans simply do not think the issue is that important. Sept. 11 and the war in Iraq have changed the people's mood far more than Washington's. Wedge issues now seem tawdry and divisive, one reason why none of them, including affirmative action and abortion, are all that prominent.   This must be news to Republicans, who pushed the gay marriage amendment in the Senate and who are doing everything they can to round up the votes of evangelical Christians.  Also, where's the evidence that "Sept. 11 and the war in Iraq have changed the people's mood far more than Washington's"?  In the latest Washington Post poll of the most important issues, 19% of respondents said the war on Iraq and another 19% said the war on terror.  But 29% said jobs and the economy, 12% said education, and 12% said health care.  So while Iraq and terrorism are clearly important issues, a majority of Americans don't think they are the most important issues.  Also, there is no evidence that Washington insiders places more or less emphasis on these issues than do ordinary Americans.    Nor do Americans appreciate the negative campaigning that partisanship fuels.    Is there any evidence that partisanship fuels negative campaigns?  During the 1970s and 1980s, analysts pointed to a decline in partisanship as the driving force behind negative campaigns.   Incumbents, who have a record to run on, usually run on it; it is a sign of our partisan times that the sitting president is attacking his opponent as if the opponent were the one in the White House. Time will tell whether Bush's attempts to define Kerry negatively — or Kerry's efforts to respond — will work. But polls and voting patterns in the past show that Americans want their candidates upbeat and positive, not mean-spirited and divisive.   Again, is there any evidence for this?  Since when did incumbents, especially those in tight races, not try to paint a negative picture of their challengers?  What polls and voting patterns "show that Americans want their candidates upbeat and positive, not mean-spirited and divisive"?  Sure, winning candidates tend to be upbeat and positive, but which way do the causal arrows run?  I'd argue that it's easy to be upbeat and positive when you are coasting to an easy victory.  Wolfe seems to be confusing a close race with a highly partisan race.   Then there is all that money. As they proved when they put sufficient pressure on Congress to pass the McCain-Feingold law, Americans find it unseemly when those with access to money can simply buy access to government. Given that both candidates opted out of public financing in the primaries, and that Kerry is considering spurning the $75 million in public money available for the general election, pressure could build again for new rules, ones that would not only limit spending but also cut down on those annoying TV ads the money buys.   From the standpoint of the contest between the parties, the key question is which one will get more votes.    No shit?   In the struggle between partisanship and nonpartisanship, by contrast, the key question is how many will vote. Americans already go to the polls in far lower percentages than they did a century ago, particularly younger Americans. It may well be that the intense partisanship we are witnessing will energize each party's base and that it will turn around this decline. Or partisanship could sour the independents and centrists and keep them from voting at all, lowering once again the percentage of those who show up. Partisan myself, I hope for the former outcome. But I would not surprised if the latter one happened instead.   It's pretty clear that if anything, declining partisanship pushes down turnout.  Beyond that, Wolfe is saying, "I have no idea what has happened or why.  Nor do I have any idea about what will happen or why.  But I won't let that stop me from writing an op-ed."

      I'm beginning to think that President Bush is in the same position as Wylie Coyote when he runs off a cliff--he hangs in the air for a moment before plummeting to earth.  Look at these poll numbers from the  urlLink Washington Post :     May  June  July   Difference    Reelect  46  44  46  0    Reelect Difference  0  -4  0  0    Trust-Economy  -5  -5  -8  -3    Trust-Iraq  6  5  0  -6    Trust-Terrorism  13  -1  9  -4    Understands People Like You  -10  -10  -13  -3    Strong Leader  12  10  4  -8    Trust in a Crisis    14  4  -10     Over the last two months, the percent of people saying they would vote for Bush over Kerry has remained flat (46) and the race between the two has remained a tie.  But when you look at the difference between Bush and Kerry on other measures, Bush has lost ground.  For example, when asked who they trust more to handle the economy, Bush went from 5 points down to 8 points down, a decline of 3 points.  On who voters trust more on the economy, Bush has lost 3 points to Kerry.  On who they trust to handle Iraq, he's down 6 points, on terrorism he's down 4.  On whether he understands people like you, Bush has dropped 3 points and on whether he's a strong leader, he's down 8 points.  And in just the last month, Bush has lost 10 points to Kerry on whether he can be trusted in a crisis.  The question is how long Bush can stay competitive with Kerry while his underlying support drops?

      The  Boston Review  has a new  urlLink forum  on the future of the Democratic party.  The lead essay is by Rick Perlstein and it includes a variety of responses, including one from me.  If you want to understand the current thinking of Democrats and liberals about the party, this is a great source since the responses range from Bill Galston to Adolph Reed.  The purpose of Rick's essay is to spur Democrats to think seriously about the party's current state and its prospects for the future.  According to Rick, the Democrats are guilty of short term thinking and a consistent pattern of downplaying economic populism.  He goes on to argue that the Democrats need to rethink themselves and their long term goals.  For my money, the best responses are from Adolph Reed and Larry Bartels.  Here's Reed on the role of consultants in the Democratic party and the perverse effects they have on campaigns:   Consultants don’t much care, of course: they get paid win or lose, and they have a product to sell—which in this case is partly the idea that their services are a better alternative to political mobilization. To that extent the apt medical analogy may be iatrogenic disease. Not only does pursuit of a technicist, consultant-driven strategy beget electoral failure; each failure becomes evidence for the need to depend even more on the presumptions of the failed strategy.   In some ways Adolph underplays the importance of consultants.  They are the Democratic party.  They are the ones who run the campaigns, the ones who signal what the party stands for, the ones who decide what candidates and elected officials are worthy of support.  Yes, elected officials need votes, but these days to get votes the also need the help of consultants.  In fact, one of the first things candidates do is try to line up the big name consultants.  Once a candidate has a consultant, it signals to others that this is a serious candidate, worthy of money, press attention, etc.  Larry Bartels is also very good, but in a different sort of way.  He argues that the idea that the Democrats can refashion consciously refashion themselves as a dominant party is fanciful:   [T]he idea that any policy platform concocted by pundits and public intellectuals can provide the blueprint for a “dominant political party” is far-fetched. Dominant parties are, as it happens, quite a rare thing in American political history. Since the 1830s there has been only one instance of a party winning three consecutive presidential elections by as much as ten percentage points. (That party was the Republicans in the 1920s.) FDR’s New Deal coalition, which Perlstein takes as his model of what a dominant political party can be, was a product of voters’ responses to New Deal policies in action--certainly not a prospective endorsement of anyone’s long-term plan. (FDR ran on a balanced budget platform in 1932, precisely the sort of political trimming Perlstein is at pains to castigate in today’s Democrats.) And Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980 in spite of the principled conservatism he inherited from Goldwater, not because of it.   My essay falls along the same lines as Bartels.  I argue that the Democrats aren't in that bad of shape and that much of the change in party politics over the last 25 years is the result of the ideological sorting of the parties:  [Since the late 1970s]  conservatives have shifted heavily toward the Republicans, more than offsetting Democratic gains among liberals.  Thus, despite Perlstein’s analysis, recent Republican gains have had little if anything to do with the Democrats abandoning their economic liberalism. Instead, the American public has become more conservative and those new conservatives were more likely to affiliate with the Republican Party.   I also argue that any effort to rethink the Democrat party is probably futile:   Elections tend to turn on such unpredictable and uncontrollable events as wars, recessions, and scandals. Indeed, but for a semen-stained dress and confusing ballots in Palm Beach County, it would be the Republicans and not the Democrats who would be undergoing this bout of introspection, self-criticism, and self-flagellation.                 Furthermore, if elections are hard to influence, party identification is even worse. As Perlstein                  mentions not once but twice in his article, party identification is a stable and long-lasting aspect of social identity. As such, it is difficult if not impossible for a party to influence party identification absent some major event—such as the Great Depression, the Cold War, or the civil-rights movement—that causes voters to reassess their partisanship.

      Ken Baer has a nice piece in the  urlLink American Prospect  that cites my  urlLink work  on the Red vs. Blue divide.  He makes what I think is an important point about Kerry's selection of Edwards:   The brilliance of the Edwards selection is not that he will enable Kerry to win states in the South (short of a landslide, they are still completely out of reach), but that he will help Kerry remain competitive in “Southern” areas of non-Southern states. While huge turnouts in Chicago, Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Milwaukee are critical, Kerry can’t win their respective states without also racking up votes in downstate Illinois, western and central Ohio, central Pennsylvania, and non-urban Wisconsin. It’s in these areas that a Southerner’s drawl, humble roots, and regular church attendance can make a difference.

      Of course, everyone is claiming that John Kerry picked John Edwards because of his youth, charisma, and southern roots,  but the NYT lets slip the REAL  urlLink story :   Several people pointed to the secretive and exclusive Bilderberg conference of some 120 people that this year drew the likes of Henry A. Kissinger, Melinda Gates and Richard A. Perle to Stresa, Italy, in early June, as helping win Mr. Kerry's heart. Mr. Edwards spoke so well in a debate on American politics with the Republican Ralph Reed that participants broke Bilderberg rules to clap before the end of the session. Beforehand, Mr. Edwards traveled to Brussels to meet with NATO officials, brandishing his foreign-policy credentials.   "His performance at Bilderberg was important," said a friend of Mr. Kerry who was there. "He reported back directly to Kerry. There were other reports on his performance. Whether they reported directly or indirectly, I have no doubt the word got back to Mr. Kerry about how well he did."   So the  urlLink Bilderberg Conference  plays a key role in  urlLink Skull and Bones  member John Kerry's VP choice in his race against fellow Bonesman George W. Bush.  All we need are connections to the  urlLink Freemasons ,  urlLink Jesuits ,  urlLink Fletcher Prouty , and the  urlLink Queen of England  for a grand unified conspiracy theory of American politics.  The  urlLink LaRouchites  must be having a field day.

      David Shribman of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette has an  urlLink op-ed  citing my  urlLink "Red and Blue Scare"  article:   Potentially Specious Truth No. 1: This is one of the most politically polarized periods in history. This highly alliterative phrase has been peddled so often that it's become part of the wallpaper of the election. I'm quite sure I've written it myself, very likely more than once. It's one of the baseline assumptions of Campaign 2004, but it may turn out to be the phrase that launched a thousand shibboleths.    Philip A. Klinkner, a political scientist at New York's Hamilton College, has looked at the contemporary period closely and warns there is little evidence to support this popular idea. Writing in the online political journal The Forum, he argues that there is "little evidence to support the notion that we are rapidly dividing into two Americas," adding that the average American, whether he resides in a Blue (Democratic) or a Red (Republican) area, has "a great degree of exposure to members of the opposing political party."    Professor Klinkner suggests that commentators aren't attentive to the nuances of political choice in various parts of the country. He's probably right, but what may be closer to the truth is that commentators are confusing a nation that is closely divided politically with one that is polarized politically. They're different.    "There are some places that are polarized," says L. Sandy Maisel, the Colby College political scientist. "There are many more places that are no more polarized than before."   Thanks to Shribman for adding a well needed corrective to the media's usual hyperventilating about political polarization.  Now if only  urlLink David Brooks  would calm down.

      There was a time when I was convinced that Sen. Joe Biden was an empty suit. Part of this was, no doubt, a reflection on the fact that he couldn't distinguish between his own family history and that of Neil Kinnock back in 1988. But every time I hear Biden on television talking about the War on Terror, I start to wonder what happened between 1988 and today. As Peter Beinart points out in the most recent TNR, Biden seems to really understand, in his gut, what this war is really about, in a way that Kerry does not. Kerry seems to think that "multilateralism" is a means unto itself, or a way of getting others to take burdens off of our shoulders--rather than what it should be, which is to add additional firepower to our arsenal. Biden, on the other hand, gets it. Kerry has the fetish for diplomacy that comes from being a diplomat's son, whereas Biden seems to recognize that diplomacy is a matter of getting the most from our ideological, economic and military assets--not substituting for them.  This raises a question that political scientists rarely discuss, but ought to: how do Congressmen grow in office? That is, what explains why some members of Congress develop into statesmen, while others turn into showboats (which is what Biden seemed on his way toward back in 1988) or never get beyond a single-minded focus on re-election and constituency service. It can't be as simple as the absence of competition--it's been a long time since Ted Stevens of Alaska has seen a competitive election, and he's still a hack. Some Senators come into office with statesmanlike qualities already ingrained in their nature, such as Pat Moynihan. But how do we account for those, like Biden, who seem to mature?

      From CNN:   Unsolicited toe-licking would be banned in the Netherlands under a law sought by the Dutch Labor party after police were unable to prosecute a would-be Casanova with a taste for female toes because he had committed no crime.  A police spokesman said Friday a man had been detained after women sunning themselves in Rotterdam's parks and beaches claimed he had snuck up on them and begun to lick their toes.  "The officers had to let him go. Licking a stranger's toes is rather unusual but there is really nothing criminal about it," the spokesman said.  Dutch press reports said the man, who is about 35, had been licking the toes of strangers for about three years but was only recently caught by police.  Peter van Heemst, a Labor member of parliament, asked Christian Democrat Justice Minister Piet Hein Donner Friday to explain why Dutch laws forbid littering but not uninvited toe-licking. Van Heemst demanded an amendment prohibiting it.  "It is a violation of one's privacy and one's physical integrity," he told a local news agency. "The norm... is that no one should touch your body if you haven't asked them first."  A spokesman for Donner said the minister could not immediately comment.

      Steve is probably right that Keyes will run, but I still think there is something fishy.  First, why didn't Keyes say yes when offered the job?  The official answer is that he wants to have time to organize a announcement "rally" on Sunday.  By "rally" we're talking 100 people in the Prairie Lounge at the O'Hare Airport Marriott.  You don't need 5 days to organize that.  Second, why does Keyes keep insisting on getting support from Hastert?  Again, it's probably the money.  But do Hastert and other Illinois GOP bigwigs really want Keyes to run?  The same Sun-Times columnists points out that the Keyes selection fits into the moderate-conservative split in the Illinois GOP and that the latter see Keyes as a chance to pick up state legislative seats downstate.  I'm not sure Hastert wants to come down on the side of the conservatives or that he (along with any sane person) thinks Keyes will actually help the GOP ticket.  On the other hand, he does want to have a candidate if only to end the circus.    My guess is that Keyes wanted a couple of days to haggle with Hastert and others in the Illinois GOP over just how much support he'll get.  Keyes might be crazy, but he's no fool.  In the end, he'll probably get enough for him to run, but that's not 100% certain.  Hasterts comments thus far have been pretty ambivalent.  BTW, yes, Keyes does have a Harvard Ph.D., but when you have to use the title of your talk show to aver that you are, in fact, "making sense," it doesn't say good things about your mental state.

      As predicted yesterday, there is now substantial evidence that Keyes is, in fact, running. The Sun-Times reports that he was just putting things off so he could have a big announcement on Sunday (note: I would have had it on Saturday so that he could sweep through the Sunday talk shows--he's already made his first mistake). I think I'll collect on that bourbon now...

      Marshall is a very smart guy, but I think he somewhat misses the point. On the one hand, there is a great criticism of Keyes to be made in this context--despite the fact that Obama is quite liberal, he may end up looking like the very soul of moderation next to Keyes. But the real point is that Keyes is a powerful, destructive force, one who (as Marshall rightly points out) as often as not gets his force directed back at himself--but Keyes doesn't need to "win" the debates, or even come off looking better than Obama in a comparative sense, to serve his purpose. All he needs to do is to force Obama to be sufficiently explicit about his actual (liberal) positions to prevent him from seeming all things to all people.

      Josh Marshall at  urlLink Talking Points Memo  does a good takedown of Keye's debating style:   "I've had a number of people -- both Republicans and Democrats -- write in today and suggest that the real reason for running Keyes is not to win the race (which I think goes without saying) but to rough up Obama and break his political stride with an eye toward his apparently limitless political future.    What'll make this possible, the argument goes, is submitting Obama to Keyes' rhetorical firepower and word wizardry at the debates that will surely happen between now and November.  Frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if the 'wingers who seem to have taken over the Illinois GOP think this is going to happen. But this is the really the stupidest idea in the world.    Keyes is something else to watch on the hustings or in a debate.  But calling him a master debater is rather like saying Dolly Parton has a dynamite bod or Lou Ferrigno is toned -- or, perhaps mostly aptly, that the Tasmanian Devil from the Bugs Bunny cartoons is quick on his feet.  In other words, impressive in his own way, but also a bit cartoonish and rather less than subtle.    If and when these two guys debate what we're going to hear are rants from Keyes -- both spellbinding and inane -- about how tort reform is necessary to bring America back into compliance with natural law, how drug reimportation is incompatible with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Independence and how gun control has been outlawed by God.    I don't see how any of that is going to set Obama back much."   Here's a question--did Keye's debate Sarbanes or Mikulski in his Maryland Senate races?  If he did, it doesn't seem to have helped him much.

      As gleeful as we might be that someone with the proven inability to attract voters to support him is on the verge of the Republican party Senate nomination, it is worth remembering that Keyes is no dummy. He's a PhD in political science from Harvard, and a skillful (if frequently over-the-top) debater. He is also possessed of a genuine (if, again, strident) moral sense. I recommend all our readers to go the link above--one of the most intelligent explanations of what is really at issue in the Iraqi prisoner abuse scandals.

      I am henceforth betting one large bourbon (no ice) against Mr. Polysigh that Keyes will run. He'll be able to get enough money from the conservative hard-core (who at the least want to avoid the embarassment of having Obama run unopposed) to run a semi-serious race. He'll get enormous media attention if he actually stands on the same stage as Obama, especially if he is able to draw blood. The issue of whether he wins (in the sense of getting 50.01% of the vote) is almost completely irrelevant where Keyes is concerned. This is about a combination of: a) getting a platform for his ideas, which, as far out as Mr. P believes they may be, he does sincerely hold and; b) Keyes' desire to get himself back in the conservative movement limelight, where he has been steadily dimming. If Keyes is able to get Obama to debate him, there is little doubt that he will do well. He will not win, but that's not the point. He wins by being put in the middle of what will no doubt be a nationally followed Senate campaign, and where, precisely is he now? This seems like a no-brainer.

      The  urlLink Chicago Tribune  has a great story on the politics behind the decision by the Illinois GOP to pick Alan Keyes as their U.S. Senate candidate:   "Inside the meeting, the battle to pick the candidate mirrored the skirmishes that have divided the Republican Party for years. Longtime conservatives who want to see the party lean more to the right debated with moderates who feel their way is the party's only chance to regain its strength and broaden its appeal.     Keyes took about 90 minutes to speak with committee members, while Barthwell, who was interviewed a day earlier, spoke for about 50 minutes.     As the debate waged behind closed doors among the committee members, the conservative wing backed Keyes and moderates supported Barthwell. The issue of abortion came to the fore, according to Republican sources close to the talks.     Conservatives pushed hard for Keyes because of his strong stance opposing abortion rights, a position they think would draw the support of core Republicans. Barthwell is considered a candidate who generally supports abortion rights.     State Sen. Kirk Dillard of Hinsdale, a member of the committee, said it appeared from early in the day that Keyes had enough of the committee's vote to secure the nomination.     Committee members, both conservative and moderate, were impressed by Keyes' firm grasp of the issues and his ability to eloquently express views that contrast sharply with Obama's.     But members also became aware that Keyes might not take the nomination if the committee voted for him. The 53-year-old insisted that before accepting the nomination he must have the full support of House Speaker Dennis Hastert and U.S. Sen. George Allen of Virginia, who heads the National Republican Senatorial Committee, several Republican sources said.     Keyes also wanted assurances of financial backing for the race.     Some high-ranking Republicans said they feared he was only seizing on the high-profile vacancy as a way to resurrect his talk-show career and book sales.     Even before the meeting, Keyes was coy about whether he would take the nomination if it were offered, saying that he was there to "consult with (the state Republican Party) about the best way to go about making" the nomination. "I'm here to chat with them about how best to pursue it," he said.     Earlier, Hastert verbally backed Keyes, but it remained unclear how much financial support he would lend him.     "I think he'd make a good candidate," Hastert said in Washington. "He has name recognition in Illinois and would come into the race with a lot of credibility with our base."     But even Hastert said it was about time for the state party to make a decision.     "We're getting down to the point where we need to have a candidate," he said. "We don't have a lot of time to be choosy."   I wouldn't be surprised if Keye's doesn't run.  I suspect that one major reason he was picked is that Illinois GOPers thought Keyes would have enough name recognition, free media appeal, and access to conservative donor lists that they wouldn't have to put up much money.  They know he's going to lose and therefore want to pour as little money down that drain as possible.  Once Keyes realizes this, I'll bet he ends up not running.  Of course, he'll argue that his decision was based on unvarying interpretation of natural law and federalist ideals, but in the end, it's about the money.

      I hear murmurings that some folks close to the Bush campaign want the president to make Social Security a major issue in the campaign, pushing hard for "voluntary" private accounts. While he may do so at a high rhetorical level, I can almost guarantee that he will not put forward a clear, comprehensive, costed-out proposal, just as he has not during the almost four years of his presidency. Why? The reasons are simple. First, with a half-trillion dollar deficit, it would be very hard to get the public to swallow the huge, present-day transition costs associated with ANY privatization plan. Second, the idea of "voluntary" accounts doesn't make sense. You either create universal, mandatory accounts paid for by carving out a percentage of present FICA taxes, or you do nothing. If you allow for voluntary accounts, you create almost insurmountable problems about what you do with people who try to go back and forth between private accounts and Social Security. (for a nice discussion of why this is problematic, see this short piece by Kent Weaver of Georgetown:  urlLink http://www.brookings.org/dybdocroot/Views/Op-Ed/Weaver/20010824.htm . What this basically means is that any privatization scheme only makes sense if everybody is in--and obviously the Bush people realize that, as a political matter, it is vital that privatization be seen as "voluntary" if it's going to fly. The problem is, once they try to make this work as policy, it falls apart.  The politics here are obvious--Bush may be able to get political points, possibly with younger voters, by pushing social security privatization. And he clearly needs to support it to keep the backing of the more libertarian wing of his party, which is already pissed off with him about the Patriot Act, ag subsidies, steel tariffs, etc. But the political advantage of the idea only holds so long as he avoids the numerous, specific policy questions that privatization entails. It is important to note that I believe that these questions can be answered (and have been, by more honest supporters of privatization), but many of the answers aren't pretty, if you do the accounting seriously. This suggests a political strategy for Kerry--if the debates allow the candidates to ask questions of each other (and Kerry's people should push for this, hard), he should ask Bush how he intends to make his Social Security plan work (acting as if he's already announced one, which is fair game--if Bush won't tell people what privatization entails, Kerry can reasonably tag the president with the content of the plans that are floating around in the conservative policy world), especially how he will avoid making it blow a huge hole in the deficit. This is precisely the sort of policy-content-heavy question Bush is terrible at answering, and it will serve the good government interest in keeping the president from having his Social Security cake and eating it too.

      Just got this comment:   Here, here!  Iowans are nice people. I know quite a few. But the only reason I know them is becasue they are all exiles. New York, DC and even Clinton NY are peppered with former farm hands. They all say they love the place, well then why the hell did you all leave?  Plus - this is one east coast elitest who is horrified that following September 11th 180 Billion dollars was doled out to mid-western farmers while New York City had to beg to get a third of that amount.  Look if you can't make money farming then DON'T KEEP FARMING. I don't expect the government to subsidize my career in marketing. Only someone who is incredibly arrogant would think they deserve to be paid to keep a failing business running.  Some one like a smug Mid-western farming elite...   We left because there were no jobs.  And it isn't just Iowa farmers (though there aren't many of them left and those that remain don't get most of the subsidies) who feed at the trough of public subsidies.  Where would higher education be without public subsidies?  For that matter, where would any of us be?  And of course Iowans are not perfect,  but who do you trust to make decisions in a democracy?  Iowans or reporters from the Washington Post?

      Given that I am on this blog only at the sufferance of Mr. Polysigh, I have to take exception to his rousing defense of Iowa against the coastal elites. Some day, I'd like to grow up to be one of those coastal elites, so---watch it! Seriously, I do think that there is a point here--Iowans ARE smug about their role in the national political process (as are New Hampshire residents, but at least New Hampshire has places to ski). And that role does have serious effects on national policy outcomes, in particular skewing agricultural policy toward continued, irrational, regressive (in the sense of keeping prices up when the poor spend a disproportionate percentage of their income on food) subsidization. If Iowa is going to continue to hold the rest of the country hostage to their policy preferences through the presidential nomination process, they should at least feel guilty about it.  And as to "give me Davenport any day"...as someone who grew up and went to college in the DC area, I say, "better dead than white bread!"

      This from the WaPo's  urlLink Ann Gerhart  on yesterday's adjoining Kerry and Bush rallies in Davenport, Iowa:   These are Iowans, after all, smug and secure in their disproportionate political power.   In other words, "Get me the Hell out of this dump and back to the people that really matter--those that live in my corner of DC."  Full disclosure notice:  I grew up about 40 miles north of Davenport in Clinton, IA.  To me, Davenport was the nearest thing to a big city.  They actually had a mall!  And having lived in DC, I'll take Davenport anytime.

      This comment just came in about the Keye's selection:   BTW, I am sure that somehow this is all the fault of the Chicago Cubs. I just haven't figured out how to prove the connection yet, but when I do....   Perhaps when the Bartman ball was blown up, the curse of the Cubs escaped into the air and transferred itself onto a passing Illinois Republican (you know, kinda like that creepy Denzel Washington movie a few years back).  That would mean a Cubs World Series victory AND the political wilderness for the Illinois GOP.  Let's hope so.

      I did a quick Google search of Alan Keyes and came across this  urlLink analysis  of his handwriting.  This insight into his personality just sort of jumped out:   Although endowed with a moderate degree of initiative, Alan doesn't take the first step without considering the possible consequences. He wants to be sure that what he is about to do will not make him look foolish.   Alan Keye's look foolish?

      There's an interesting story in the Guardian today, to the effect that Britain's third party, the Liberal Democrats, who have been making steady gains of late (largely on the back of their opposition to the Iraq war, which both Labour government and the Tories supported), are moving in a substantially more libertarian direction--scaling back regulation, introducing more competition into the welfare state, coming out firmly against the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. From a strategic point of view, this is interesting--basically a signal that the party thinks it has milked all the available support from Labour-leaning voters, and focusing their fire on the Tories. This at the same time that the Conservatives seem to be increasing their support, vis a vis Labour. While this might make sense, it is risky--I doubt that much of this appeals strongly to the party's base, who are as likely to be to the left of Labour as to its right. Presumably the party has decided that a more clearly "liberal" (libertarian) message--more pacific on foreign policy, tolerant on social issues, anti-public-service-monopoly on domestic policy--will give voters a clear sense of what they're for, as opposed to the votes they've collected up until now on the basis of what they're not (Labour or Conservative, and against the war). In a way, this is simply taking the LibDems back to where they started--the old Liberal party positions of the early 20th century combined with the reformist liberalism of the Social Democratic Party of the mid-80s. This could promise an interesting shake-up in the next British general election, where Tony Blair will almost certainly not be leading the Labour party, and where Gordon Brown will.

      This from the  urlLink Chicago Tribune  on the Illinois Republican Committee's search for a U.S. Senate candidate:   Tuesday's decision capped a strange day at the Union League Club of Chicago in which the committee took three hours to interview 14 potential candidates and then debated what to do for another three hours. At times, the process took on the atmosphere of a three-ring circus as wannabe senators came out of the woodwork to plead their cases.  Three men who showed up unannounced were allowed to speak to the committee as was a 32-year-old Florida man wearing an 18th Century powdered wig. The only person who said he wanted to speak to the committee but wasn't allowed to enter was a protester standing on the sidewalk outside the club wearing lederhosen. One of the rejected candidates, Gen. John Borling, applauded the interview process for its "inclusiveness."   Inclusive?  Not with such a shocking display of bias against lederhosen wearers.  They might as well put up a "No Germans Need Apply" sign.

      It now seems that the Illinois GOP has narrowed its choice for U.S. Senate candidate down to either Alan Keyes or Bush administration deputy drug czar Andrea Grubb Barthwell.  In earlier post, I suggested that Keyes represented the bottom of the barrel as a potential candidate, but Barthwell may well be even worse.  Here's what  urlLink USA Today  had to say about her:   Barthwell, who interviewed with the committee on Tuesday and was expected to talk to them again on Wednesday, still has to contend with allegations that she engaged in "lewd and abusive behavior" while serving as a top official in the White House drug policy office.   An internal inquiry found last year that she made repeated comments about the sexual orientation of a staff member and used a kaleidoscope to make sexually offensive gestures. Barthwell said last month that the inquiry memorandum overstated what happened, but she said she was wrong for participating in "inappropriate banter" at a staff birthday party.

      I think Phil and I have some difference here on the impact of the debates. I don't think we'll see a repeat of 1980, because my guess is both candidates play it safe, unless for some reason the polls are cutting against them near the end. What is more, if it is Bush who is behind, my guess is that he doesn't have the skills to use the debates to move the voters, and knows it. And Kerry is so deep into risk aversion that I doubt he'll take the chance. So my prediction of little durable shift (as opposed to a temporary bump from the NYC convention) in the polls holds.

      A couple of thoughts:  The Kerry bounce/bump or lack thereof:  I think a couple of things are going on here.  First, it depends on the poll you look at.  Newsweek had it at about 8-10 points, ABC/WaPo a bit less than that, and CNN/USAToday/Gallup nothing.  My guess is that Kerry probably helped himself a bit, both in picking up a few points and firming up some people who were leaning his way, but not solid.  Second, the historical comparisons with other candidates are problematic.  The "averages" for bumps cited in the news reports include Clinton in 1992.  That year he had a bump of anywhere from 16 to 30 points, largely because Perot's dropping from the race created a big pool of voters who needed to find a new home.  When you take Clinton out of the mix, the average bump is much more modest, about 5-8 points, and that about what Kerry did if you look average the three polls mentioned above.  Third, Steve's right that given the lack of network coverage, the early announcement of the Edwards pick, and the small pool of undecided voters, the potential for a bump this year was lower than in past years.  Fourth and finally, so what?  There's no relationship between the bump you get out of a convention and how you do in the election.  Hell, Mondale got a pretty good boost after his convention, but that didn't help him much.  On the other hand, some candidates have gotten about what Kerry got and still went on to win.  Perhaps there's a potential political science law here, something like the amount of media attention is inversely proportional to actual electoral impact.  So if the media chatter on ceaselessly about something, go ahead and safely ignore it.  That leads into Steve's point about knowing more about the ground game and less about the polls.  That's probably right, but  the polls do tell us some things about the ground game.  Right now Kerry is doing pretty well in the battleground states and this gives him more choices about where to deploy his resources.  Also, Steve's leaving out the candidate debates.  They could potentially change the race dynamic.  Here I'm thinking about 1980, when Reagan and Carter ran pretty even until they debated.  When Reagan showed that he was a reasonably safe alternative to Carter, the election broke his way and he won pretty handily.  I don't know if that will happen this year, but they are the one event on the horizon could shake things up.

      My eyes are glazed over having just spent an hour looking at the state-by-state polls. A number of them have moved quite marginally, but few seem to have shifted dramatically. That doesn't surprise me--while the overall viewership of the conventions doesn't look to have dropped that much, my sense is that fewer curious voters watched it. That is, the really engaged partisans (whose votes we wouldn't expect to shift) watched the conventions on the cable networks, but there was only 3 hours of the convention for the more casual, network-oriented viewer (Phil--correct me if my sense of the situation is wrong). Thus there is probably less of a stimulus here than in the past, and thus less of a response.  There has also been less of an impact from the Edwards nomination than some may have thought. But then again, we don't know about the counterfactual--how would Kerry have done in the period running up to the convention if he hadn't appointed Edwards? Perhaps the vacuum would have been filled by negative news on Kerry.  Frankly, I seriously doubt that there will be any significant event (short of a terrorist attack) that will influence the election from here on in. The voters have already absorbed and shaped their opinions on what's going on in Iraq--now that an interim government has been appointed, there's not going to be too much more to change people's minds there. Voters respond to the economy, but most research suggests that they do so based on where it was earlier in the year. The debates may have some effect on the voters who are still holding out near the end, and if one of the candidates was to really screw up, that might have some effect. But my guess is both candidates play defense in the debates, leaving it a wash. So, my best guess is that while there will be noise in the polls for the next three months, it should be recognized as that--noise.  What that means is that the real thing we ought to be tracking in turnout, and thus party and quasi-party GOTV activities. If a state is basically a statistical dead heat now, it'll probably remain so until the end (with perhaps some advantage for the challenger, so maybe we should adjust all of Kerry's numbers up one or two percentage points, which is enough to cancel out the Nader effect). So what we want to know is, in the dead-heat states, how many people does each party have on the ground? How much money is it spending? If I was trying to predict the outcome, THIS is what I'd be paying attention to, and what somebody ought to start tracking (if the numbers are available).  The final thing I'd want to see is, to the degree it is possible, some estimate of the probable Nader vote better than what we have now. There are two possible interpretations of Nader's numbers, and I can't choose between them. Interpretation One is that, with the drumbeat of punditry about how stupid it is to vote Nader, that some percentage of those actually planning to vote for Nader have just given up admitting it to anyone, thus suppressing his numbes. Interpretation Two is that Nader's numbers are inflated--when it comes down to sitting in the voting booth and pulling the lever, voters in swing states just won't be willing to risk another four years of Bush.  I'd like to think that Interpretation Two is right, but I don't. My sense of the Nader voters is that these are people who are just so alienated by the political process that they have ceased processing information contrary to their prejudices. So no matter how often they are told that a vote for Nader is a vote for Bush, and that the parties really are quite different in the policies they are likely to produce when given executive power, they've just stopped listening. So I really doubt that the Nader numbers will disappear, and there's some chance that they may actually be a little low.   Bottom line--no big, durable shifts in public attitudes from here until November. Nader voters handing Bush a couple of points in swing states.  Ground game over air game. Bottom line--we need fewer polls and more sources of other kinds of information.

      A number of talking heads addressing the subject of Obama's remarkable (knock on wood) and sudden political success have put substantial weight on the fact that he is an African. And in America's racial hierarchy, most white voters are likely to place him the the "immigrant" category rather than the "black" category. From the work of Paul Sniderman and others, we know that part of what makes it hard for blacks to win in state-wide races is the perception (and often the reality) that they are substantially more liberal than the median voter. This is based on the assumption that voters want to choose the candidate who is closer to their ideological preferences, but have to do so in the absence of ample, high-quality information for determining this within the time they are willing to invest in political decision-making. So they seek cues that will, with a high degree of certainty, allow them to match their preferences with that of the right candidate, with the least search costs. Race is one of these cues. This is why black state-wide candidates try to conflate these cues by throwing out seemingly confounding cues, such as military service or support for the death penalty. They have to do this because they are inevitably tagged with being at the median of publicly-known black officials, even before advertising by their opponents.  Obama has the advantage of being judged by what voters seem to think is the median ideological position of most immigrants, who voters (rightly or not) imagine are more entrepreneurial, less "race-conscious," etc. than blacks. In short, they imagine that he is to the right of the median of the black political class. The irony is that, while Obama clearly has a very different political style than most of the Congressional Black Caucus, all the evidence is that he will be one of the Senate's most liberal members. That is, he is benefitting from the stereotyping that Americans engage in when they think of immigrants (at least those with college degrees). We often think about stereotyping as something that is negative, and it is--if as an individual, your objective qualities are superior to the median perceived group average that constitutes the stereotype.  But what if the shoe is on the other foot? If your objective qualities are below the perceived group median, then you actually benefit by being stereotyped. Imagine that I am a low performing member of a high performing immigrant group (such as Japanese). In the absence of additional information, employers will assume that I am very hard working, quantitatively skilled, and unlikely to complain to my bosses. If I am in fact below the perceived Japanese median in all of these qualities, the presence of a "model minority stereotype" is an enormously beneficial group asset, one that it will be in my interest to play up at every opportunity. So this raises the question--what exactly is behind some Asians dislike of the "model minority stereotype?" Might we hypothesize that those who find it most distasteful are those whose objective characteristics are above the group median, and that these are the persons most likely to write and comment on such subjects?

      Following up on Steve's post about a possible Keye's v. Obama race, I think this shows just how desperate Illinois Republicans have become.  Here it is, the Land of Lincoln, and the best the party of Lincoln can do is to import a Marylander with a dismal track record as a campaigner and a reputation as a right-wing kook.  Down-ticket Republican candidates must be getting very worried.  With Kerry likely to win handily and with Obama looking at a blowout, they have to be thinking that they might just get swept away in dual landslides.    Also, what happened to the idea of running a sports figure?  Just because Mike Ditka and Dave Duerson turned them down doesn't mean they can't find someone else?  What are Minnie Minoso and William "Refrigerator" Perrry up to these days?  Here's another thought--two cast members of the movie "Predator" have already been elected to statewide office (Arnold and Jesse Ventura).  I say try going 3 for 3 by nominating Carl Weathers.

      This is truly beyond my capacity for satire. First a guy into threesomes (note: I wish we had a legal system that would prevent me from knowing this). Now a man best known for losing miserably in a Senate race in Maryland and stage diving during his preposterous run for the Republican presidential nomination. That said, I would certainly skip watching The Simple Life to see an Obama-Keyes debate...

      To help get some more ideas going, I've asked my friend Steve Teles to join me as a contributor to PolySigh.  Steve is an Assistant Professor of Politics at Brandeis University.  He has previous taught at having held previous positions at Hamilton College (where he was in my job for a one-year visiting stint), Harvard, the University of London, Holy Cross College and Boston University. He is the author of  urlLink  Whose Welfare: AFDC and Elite Politics  (1996, rev. ed. 1998)  and numerous articles on such topics as the logic of policy analysis, US-China relations, the politics of affirmative action in Britain, and the social mobility of British ethnic minorities. As you can see he's very narrow in his approach to politics!  He is currently at work on a book entitled  Parallel Paths:The Evolution of the Conservative Legal Movement , which is under contract with Princeton University Press. He is an avid skiier and hopes to drop ten pounds by the times the lifts open in November.

      Hi...first post on this site. Just for full disclosure purposes, I should provide a bit of background on who I am. I'm a political scientist--that is, I probably qualify as a "discrete, insular minority" in the legal sense of the term. I'm a Democrat. Broken down further, I'm: a) quite hawkish on foreign policy; b) relatively liberal on redistributive issues; c) quite rabidly free trade and suspicious of other policy tools that distort markets (such as most tax deductions, agricultural subsidies, and command and control regulation); d) generally suspicious of the role of courts in policy disputes and; e) relatively conservative on "social control" issues (like crime and welfare reform) but fairly liberal on lifestyle issues (like gay marriage, which I'm for--if it's passed by a legislature, opposed if imposed by judicial diktat). So that's enough for you to figure out where I'm coming from.

      As you can see, I've posted a running tally of electoral votes based on the most recent state polls.  The counter comes courtesy of  urlLink electoral-vote.com .
