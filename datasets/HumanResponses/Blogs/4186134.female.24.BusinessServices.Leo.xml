        You know, it's sad when you have all the time in the world (such as summer vacation), but you lack the discipline to keep up with all the general upkeep of thinks. For example, I've had a lot of free time, and I am so behind in things. That is the creed of the true procrastinator. I get mad at myself, then get over it, then wish I had gotten things done earlier. Oh well, I guess that is my curse in life. I find I'm more productive once I have a schedule to stick through. Maybe that's why I'm looking forward to school. I'll have more of a schedule than in the summer, even though I'm not a student.   
  Life has been going generally well. I've been doing really good at finding things to do that are not productive. Like sitting here on a Saturday posting a blog when I should be cleaning my room.  I hope all is doing well.  
  Chow!

        Hello! It's such a beautiful day, however the wind is blowing (which is totally normal here in Wyoming). Actually, yesterday was calm, which is absolutely amazing. Summer's almost over. The university here starts in about 3 weeks, and that means most of my friends will be back in town (even though I'm not in school , I have a lot of friends that age), and all my roommates will be back. I've been rambling all over my house a lot, and it's been kinda lonely, but lets just say I've been watching lot's of movies lately.   
   Movies....i've seen lots of those lately.  I really liked the  Bourne Supremacy ,  Spiderman 2 , &  Troy , which I saw all this last weekend.  And I went to my very first drive-in movie theatre.  That's quite the experience.  It was a little chilly, but I enjoyed it overall.  I really like good action flicks.  It keeps my heart pumping &amp; action flicks with plot impress me.

       So, I was just wandering around on the internet, and decided, "Hey, I should start a blog!"  That way I can ramble with out getting in trouble at work.   Also, it'll help me cure my "I've been in a cubicle all day, and I need to get out!!"  Go figure.  Anyways....I hope you don't mind.
