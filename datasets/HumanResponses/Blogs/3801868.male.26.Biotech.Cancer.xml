      Well it seems to have worked.  Doubts now occur as to the depth of thought to reveal - some secrecy is necessary in a polite society.  I will add some photos when I figure out how to work that bit of the program.  Working late tomorrow regrettably and Saturday and possibly Friday night too. This is the penance I pay for living in a cosmopolital metropolis, and sound mental health. I have no regrets  Love to you all,  Peter

      Welcome all, since I find it unlikely anyone not actually related or in close acquaintance with me will ever view this, I can safely say you all know me and what I do.  I've created this because I really suck at keeping up with friends and family and I wanted a way to do so. I've also always wanted to be a diarist but have always sucked at that too. C'est la vie.  Apologies to T for stealing his word as a title. Zetetist means seeker after rare knowledge, FYI.  I took today off as my ankle was still sore from spraining it Saturday morning. I was a little (a lot) intoxicated and attempting to dance to some very fine dance music at PHD (Pure Hard Dance) Bar in Melbourne, where I was taking my holidays. I had a fantastic time there and hope to return soon.  I reduced my tongue tie a little today in a minor surgical procedure. I am dangerous when bored.  B and I will no longer be quite so close as we have been. She and I have always understood  that she is seeking more commitment than I am able to give. She has found someone who can offer that and I am very happy, and hope it proceeds very well. On the other hand, I just found out at the gym that someone I have been keen on since meeting several years ago is newly single. Coincidence? Well yes, but convenient nonetheless.  Mood today 9/10.  Love to you all,  Peter

      The results for the Australian Postal Bench Press Cup were posted a few days ago, I was 2nd in my weight division and about 7th overall, with which I'm very pleased. I think I will try a bench only competition next, all those squats beforehand can't be good for my bench. I benched 150kg weighing in at 74.9 (in jockeys only - that was very close). Oh and I got drug tested afterwards! They said it was random, but you know I think it had something to do with how well I was lifting. Now hold on while I let a little air out of my overinflated ego.    Happy.

      The doctor is a powerful entity which is created by society and given special   privileges. With these come responsibilities, again determined by society. A   doctor's personal opinions should not enter their actions as a doctor, because   they have a duty to repay the privileges of doctordom by behaving as society   determines. In a similar fashion, society has not decided that every person   should have free medical care. If that were the case, all medical care would be   free. Even if a specific person (and here I include myself) disagrees with that   decision, they by continuing to live in Australia have implicitly agreed to   abide by the decisions of society.    Furthermore, some people expect doctors to be charitable in cases of hardship,   however, they are not recompensed for this. They receive no special tax breaks,   no charity allowance to perform this work. Some may say that doctors (and we   should include here all health care workers, professional and non-professional)   are paid well enough already. Yet compared to professionals with similar   training they are paid much less, so this argument is false. In fact, society   continues to treat doctors as a commercial trade, prosecuting for so-called   anti-competitive behavior, when doctors try to behave as a professional and   self-regulate, and maintain standards by sharing expertise and guaranteeing any   one doctor is as good as any other, for the benefit of the community.  For this reason I make no extraordinary efforts for my patients beyond that for   which I am recompensed. I accept no appeals to my charity. I am charitable, but   not in my work. I, unlike so many of those who insist I must be charitable, am   involved in efforts to change the rules that govern me so that there is no need   for anyone to ask of my charity.    It is high time for government to recognize that healthcare is the pre-eminent   amongst those investments where user-pays is to the detriment of all. No notions   of charity or morality need motivate universal health-care which is outside the   field of personal success or failure in financial matters. It is simply more   efficient to provide a reasonable level of healthcare to all than a lot to some   and none to some. Simple evidence of this is the U.S.A. which has the most   expensive health care system in the world providing some of the worst outcomes   for the population. Some European countries have simply decided that your health   should not be related to how much money you have. By enabling better control of   communicable diseases and investment in preventative program health care becomes   more efficient and effective. Indeed some of the large H.M.O. of the U.S.A. are   beginning to understand this and invest in such research and programs. Another   clear example of the efficiency of universal health care is in administrative   costs- far from being cheaper by competition's mythical effects, average   administrative costs for private health care funds are about 14%, medicare, 8%.

      The true secrets of health and longevity  1. The first secret is that there are no secrets. These are all things that all adults know.  2. The second secret overlies all the others - moderation in all things, including moderation. This means that while generally you should take or do not too much or too little of most things, there are a few things where you need to be extreme and either always or never do ar take things.  3. Enjoy your life. What is the point of longevity and health if you are miserable during it? If you are unhappy change your life so that you are happy. Consider that your unhappiness may be a treatable illness, depression, and consult your doctor.  4. Eat a balanced diet with a little of everything, not too much of any one thing. A vegetarian diet is probably healthier for you.  5. Sleep enough that you feel refreshed when you awake. This is probably more than you do now.  6. Enjoy your work. If you don't find another job, spend less time at work or change your attitude so that you do enjoy it. You spend more time working than doing any other single awake thing in your life, so if you don't enjoy it it means you are not enjoying most of your life, and you are probably unhappy.  7. Never smoke.  8. Drink alcohol moderately, and that means no more than 3 drinks in any one session for males, 2 for females, and usualy less than that, with at least 2 alcohol free days per week.  9. Exercise at least every second day. During exercise you should at a minimum be out of breth so that you cannot finish a sentence, having to sop in between words to take a breath. Don't go to the extreme and exercise so much that you suffer injuries.  10. Always use a condom during sex unless you are SURE that that person is HIV negative and in the three months prior to their last test (and since) has not had unprotected sex or used iv drugs with anyone else.  11. Finally, the only thing which has been proven to prolong the life of every animal it has ever been tried upon is eating less. The less calories you consume (above starvation levels) the longer you live. This has been proven true in starfish to rats, and the benefit seems to be roughly in proportion to the level of calorie reduction, ie if you eat one quarter less calories you live one quarter longer. You must maintain adequate levels of nutrition of essential vitamins and minerals for this to be effective. This is called CRAN (Caloric Reduction with Adequate [some say advanced] nutrition).    If you're curious, I personally follow 9 secrets, because quality can be more important than quantity.

      I was wondering what it would be like to date, or to be in a relationship with me. It seems staggeringly obvious, embarrasing that I have never considered the question before.  I'm a physically attractive man well resourced etcetera so physically and in terms of means I would be pretty good.  I'm generally known as really really good in the sack so that would be good - I acknowledge that this is if you like what I like doing. Happily most seem to.  I'm very focussed on my work and my career and will brook no interruption or interference with either.  I don't shout, I'm not at all violent, the most that comes out of me is a cold, controlled anger if an arguement is really bad. This would happen maybe a few times a year?  I'm very cuddly and like to be touching, holding hands, sleep spooning etcetera etcetera. In fact I am at heart a true romantic, I like picnics, holidays away with one's beloved, flowers, blah blah blah. I'm just good at separating the important stuff from this.  You would have to like dogs, and in particular, my dogs. We are a package not to be sold separately. You would have to like dogs sleeping on the bed, and when you aren't around and it's really cold, in the bed. On your side.  I'm fairly witty with a sense of humour, tending to awful, awful puns, but I like to make my partners laugh.  I'm honest to a fault. This blog is part of that, it would be, no is required reading for any potential mate. There are of course things here many would probably prefer not to know.  Most mates would be put off by my total lack of fidelity and my absolute honesty about it. This is a topic I will explore later but I don't think I for one and people in general can realistically continue a monogamous relationship long-term, and thus I do not want the strain. I believe this will strengthen a relationship.  My least functional (in a relationship)  characteristic would be my absolute unwillingness to play games, to be manipulated and such. Regrettably I don't explain this well. Put it this way - offer an ultimatum to me, and even if I would actually like to take the alternative, I will take the split first because I will not be forced into anything. Test whether I really like you by expressing interest in someone else, expecting jealousy, and I will encourage you to pursue him/her. I'm obstinate, stubborn, inflexible and have a tendency to repeat myself.  In summary then as I see it, a few superficial pros but some very significant cons.    What then do I want from a partner? Mutual respect, mutual tolerance, get along, have fun, good sex. That's it. No love, no wedding, no children, no demands for support physical nor  (especially) emotional.  I am coming to believe that these are things that I will most likely get from several people in my life.    Oh yes it was Spiderman 2 which I saw tonight with my mother which brought this on. Lots of fun, great escapism, I ask for no more from film.

      I was recently considering writing a eulogy for myself, on the basis that if those surviving me were aware that I had no fear of death and that I had accepted the inevitable, they might be less distressed at my passing. My brother argued that this was not the case, using the example of his experience where friends had indeed wanted to die, which only worsened the grief upon their death. I feel though that this is a false comparison, for the following reasons;    I don't want to die, but I don't not want to die. This is a neutral point, zero compared to one and negative one.    In the experiences my brother referred to, those people in the opinion of those regarding their death held an irrational belief that they wanted to die. Therefore perhaps in their right mind they would not have wanted to. Also, part of the grief on their death arises from the knowledge that it may have been entirely preventable, and guilt that one might have done something to prevent it.    My experiences of death, in contrast to my brother's, have largely been the accidental deaths of young people, and the expected deaths of the elderly. In the first,  grief also results from the belief that one's relative suffered prior to death, especially with the fear and knowledge that they were about to die. I believe that if they knew that their loved one did not find this so distressing would lessen the anguish. Certainly loved one's prefer to know that the deceased was not aware of imminent death and did not suffer so.    On the other hand, when one can prepare for death the opportunity is provided to make peace with oneself, settle matters, consider what might happen after to oneself and one's loved ones etcetera etcetera. When this is completed and the person feels that there is no more to do, and that they are ready to die, their passing is regarded as less distressing to their loved ones. It is that which I wish to communicate to those I love in the event of my death.    I have no fear of death, while I do not wish to die indeed wish to live I realise that it is inevitable and this is my way of preparing for death, so that I have no regrets.    Love    Pete

       For background to this one, you need to know that the corpora cavernosa are two of the erectile tissue parts of the penis, and the corpus callosum the interconnection between the two hemispheres of the brain.  It should be asked of a particularly arrogant male medical practitioner in the following manner:  "What's the difference between your corpora cavernosa and your corpus callosum?"  They will no doubt proceed to give a most erudite answer, to which you reply: "No, that's not right. There's none, because you're a dickhead."    I thought it was funny.

       My beloved Poopsie is at the vet's tonight. My other two dogs, about 7 years older, Staffordshire Bull Terriers, fought with her today and really hurt her. She had no individually serious wounds but was very battered and bruised and worse shocked. I think they got into a small area of the yard whose gate then swung shut, trapping them all. One of my older dogs had an abscess in his ear which was very tender whose careless, playful puncturing by poopsie may have preciptitated the events. I am concerned most for her mental health - who knows how long she was locked in a small pen with two dogs vehement on terrorising her. The area is horrifying, with blood spattered everywhere. Now, when someone you love is hurt, is the most difficult time to be buddhist.

      It continues - I have yet to find a young partner with any sexual talent. My experiences with younger women are very poor, I find them quite boring, inhibited, lacking in skills and generally really bad lovers. I recognise that at their age I was pretty bloody awful too, but presumably my lovers found other aspects enough to keep their interest active. Regrettably, I have not found those other aspects in my young lovers. Worse still, my most recent turned out to be a golddigger. That was very repellent to me. I am arrogant enough to think I should be valued for what I am rather than what I can provide, so it was very offensive. I felt dirty, and for once not in a good way. Give me a MILF over a teeny any day. Mood however is generally good and I have been productive this weekend.

      I went to the opera with a maiden "aunt" this evening, to Don Pasquale.  It's the tale of an old bachelor who decides to get married to teach  his nephew a lesson, but is instead fooled himself. I enjoyed it.   The performances were excellent, and the crew wafted appropriate scents  across the audience with each act, which was an impressive touch. I  shall endeavour to see more.

       It comes to that time of year again when our  hospital administrators realise how short of doctors they will be next  year and attempt to recruit for next year with a mix of threats and  promises, neither particularly realistic.      The problem stems from the 1990's when the federal government in a  tremendously short sighted effort to cut costs reduced the number of  medical school places. The result is that now we are 800 doctors short  in this state. Since it is a supplier's market, doctors can charge what  they like, medicine becomes less affordable to those who need it most  and health of our society declines. I noted with great amusement last  year the feds realised their mistake (a decade too late) and raised  medical school numbers. This will go some way to correcting the  problem, in about 8 years time.      Not helping matters is the state health department (who runs the public  hospitals). They, despite the obvious evidence otherwise, treat you as  an expendable and almost superfluous cog. You get no holidays except at  their convenience, forget study leave to pass your exams (despite the  shortage of senior doctors too!) and if something goes wrong you can be  sure in which direction the blame will flow - to the lowest point, you.      Personally I can't wait to get out and enter private practice, where I  am my own boss, I set my hours, my charges, my holidays. While that  continues amongst my colleagues your health and that of those you know  will suffer.

      I am always surprised when people describe me as outspoken and confident. Growing up I never was that way and don't feel it now.  One pattern of behaviour I have adopted that explains much of this is a psychological defense mechanism called counterphobia. Basically when you get scared, you go out and do whatever it is that scares you to prove that it doesn't.  It's a very powerful technique and it has done a lot for me, but I need to beware biting off more than I can chew. Sometimes one is scared for good reason. For example, I find it very difficult to back away from physical confrontation. Just last weekend I nearly got into a fight in the midst of a concert, and on reflection I was probably in the wrong on that occasion.  Tonight as I sit here alone having completed my alloted study I wonder if I have made the right choice. Will my occupation reward me as it does now in the years to come? Will I find making lots of people's lives a little better as rewarding as making one person's life a lot better? Would my partner even have their life made even better by me? Presumably there are many men who could devote more time and energy to my hypothetical partner then myself, perhaps they are better off without me.  Mood is certainly low tonight. I shall have to go and do something I'm afraid of.

      I've just been browsing other blogger's blogs, and I have two disturbing but not surprising conclusions 1) I am older than the average blogger. 2) I am a damn sight more serious than the average blogger.  Bugger. My youth slips away and I don't even know it. I mean who really writes blog about industrial accidents.  Also I found this to which I say you've got to be shitting me http://www.thebricktestament.com/  Now I'm going to go and study for me exam. 18 months away.

      Here's an interesting thought - all the money cost by industrial action, every year, comes nowhere near the money cost by industrial accidents every MONTH. Most of these accidents are preventable with simple safety measures, this I can confirm from my work as a doctor. The cost of these injuries to the employer, employee and society in general far outweighs the small cost safety measures to prevent them would, however the costs are hidden from general perception where the safety measures are not. What is needed is a change of attitude, simple summarised " There are no accidents " An accident has no cause, all of these events do.

      One of my partners L asked me a tremendous question a few days ago - what happens if I fall in love again?  The idea truely horrified me. I have things to do, I have plans, I like my life the way it is. I like my freedom to do what and whomever I want. Poopsie and I get along just fine, she doesn't argue, in words anyway, she doesn't mind if I bring another bitch back (so long as she can sleep on the couch opposite the bed and watch). Falling in love would just seem like a giant pain in the ass. Of course if it actually happened I wold not think that way, affected by the altered state of cognition we call love. Buddha said not to seek one special person for that is false but to love everyone. It's working for me. I've been much happier, calmer, easy going and downright pleasant since studying buddhism. I like it that you are encouraged to critically examine and question all aspects of the teaching. There is no such thing as faith, just thought. Still I am only human and perhaps that special someone is waiting to blind my senses, strangle my logic, blecht.

      I posted this on another blogger's journal in response to an entry where she had been criticised for her appearance prior to a bodybuilding contest by an ex.  "I'm sorry generally for the nature of men. There is a bizarre expectation of many men that they are entitled to the best woman the Earth can provide, and if you aren't then you can be disposed of without guilt and that you are to blame for not being perfect. Of course, some women have this attitude too (Sex in the City popularised it). It reflects a view of a partner as an object to enhance one's own life, rather than a companion to share one's life with. I'm sure you can find someone better. Peter"

      A patient passed away unexpectedly this evening. Well, actually he was still alive when I left work and nothing in medicine is absolute, but this was pretty good bet.  Thoughts naturally tend to your own mortality. I wish my death to be first and foremost with dignity, preserving as much as possible my mental capacity at whatever expense. For example, I would take the gamble of cerecral metastases over prophylactic cranial irradiation with almost guaranteed cognitive deficit.  I am frustrated by one of my senior doctors, who is mercenary, out of date and lacking in empathy. I have learnt from him though - despite gross incompetence, he is loved by his patients for his excellent bedside manner. It is the nature of medicine that I can effectively do nothing without jeopardising my own career, so I will wait and take slow, careful and well prepared action at the appropriate time. Thou shalt not tolerate a dodgy doctor to practice. Eventually.  Love, Peter

      The aforementioned patient passed away today in the presence of her family and friends, in comfort, with her dignity preserved. I think that's about as good as death can possibly be, and I was proud to facilitate those circumstances.

      Today, at the expense of her health, I preserved a patient's dignity today. I explained to her that her prognosis was very, very poor, and asked her what she felt was most important; long life, quality of life, comfort or dignity. She opted for the latter. She spoke with her immediate family and informed them of her decision, they were sad but proud of their mother. We will cease active treatment of her condition and use non-invasive and less effective alternatives that will keep her comfortable and with the dignity she desires.  I believe that conversation is held too rarely with patients. We (doctors) tend, naturally, to assume that treatment is best and once set in a path tend to continue, but sometimes there is a need to reflect and make sure the patient and all involved have a clear understanding of the direction of treatment. Indeed sometimes patients have never wanted treatment at all, only the knowledge to plan their last days. We are the translators between their bodies and themselves.  I believe death rides on the shoulder of every doctor. As much as life, he is our friend and colleague, for we only ever delay the inevitable.

      Last night's ward call was certainly interested, the medical registrar and I faced a run of ill patients to manage. I think we succeeded.  Today I visited M my son and his mothers, who I found all well but for two sore throats and several growing teeth. He is learning the art of the tantrum distressingly early, however I think this will not carry on long with his mothers who are too strong minded to put up with that rot. Not yet walking as he can crawl far faster, I'm sure in his own time  he will elect to take to two legs. Soon we are to embark on the conception of a sibling, something I regard with eagerness and trepidation, as it requires 6 days abstinence a month, curtailing my favourite pastime. He or she had better appreciate my sacrifice...  Love,  Peter

      I believe that BDSM represents in humans the perversion of sex in order to promote social cohesion amongst the species. Sexual arousal is a well established reward system. When pre-humans began to gather together into groups as a new tool to promote survival of the species, those with established dominance heirarchies had a survival advantage. BDSM arose because those who became aroused by displays of dominance/submission did so more, and had a survival advantage through better group cohesion than those who didn't. So BDSM is in fact, perfectly natural.  I do like evolutionary psychology because it is completely untestable, and therefore one can endlessly theorise upon any aspect of behaviour it's origins.

      Today was not good. None of my colleagues were willing to work for me tonight in spite of my sprained ankle. Therefore I spent the five hours after my usual day had finished limping about the hospital. In accordance with the law of murphy, there were two serious codes tonight. There were also several less serious calls, some routine and some very dodgy ones. The first rule of arrests at the house of god is, first take your own pulse. Mine never raised itself over sixty. Cool and calm or just apathetic?  Love Peter

      I had a date this evening that turned out mostly to be a discussion on the meaning of life. WHy are we here? I believe (though  know  seems more appropriate)  that there is no meaning. We are a tool of our dna designed to enhance the chance of more dna being produced. This is no more than a self-catalysing chemical reaction, of no more consequence than the fusion reaction occuring at the core of our sun. There is no god. The idea is just ridiculous. There is no meaning and no god, therefore there is no right nor wrong, for there is nothing to judge these things by. Meaning and value then depends on what you give these to. I have decided that what feels good is right, therefore I am what is called a hedonist. I do what feels good for me. This is different to the usual concept of hedonism because I take into account fully the long term consequences. So, to me what feels good is right and should be done, what doesn't, ought not to be. Other people are the same, so what feels good to them is right, what doesn't isn't. Since hurting other people makes them feel bad, this is wrong. There can be some conflict if this makes me feel good, but since it doesn't this is not the case. Therefore I do what I want which is to make others feel good, within reason.

      I started today on the Respiratory unit of my hospital. Joyous occasion. I did enjoy general medicine but too often it became predictably thus; 87 year old admitted for some recuperation after tripping and falling. Subsequently becomes clear fell because their prostatism has resulted in incontinence and they were rushing to the bathroom, which made their cerebellar ataxia from multiple strokes more likely to make them fall so they did. In hospital it is noted they are disorientated to time, place and person and are unsafe by themselves at home (strangely no one has noticed this before). We arrange placement and are forced to remind the patient of this daily, which always comes as a unfortunate surprise. The patient, every day, asks why we are torturing him like this. We arrange a suitable place for him to stay. The day before he has a massive stroke which we find is due to metastatic cancer, he dies slowly a week later. I mean, its not all like that but that is it distilled. At least on the respiratory unit its all smoking related lung disease or cancer. I have a rather relaxed attitude to smoking, especially once people have developed complications - I mean, they now know how bad it is for them. If they keep smoking they can hardly claim not to have been warned, now have they? In some way it is the right decision for them, and its another nail in their coffin, not mine. Indeed it keeps me in business, so smoke your life away.

      One of my friends has split with his wife and is engaged in a custody battle now over his son, only a little older than mine. In a quick mental survey of my friends, none with children are in the relationship which bore those children. My heart goes out to them, poor bastards. Men have many advantages in this life but the ability to bear children is not one. I can see a hollow look in their eyes, where a role they treasured, found truely rewarding, fulfilling perhaps for the first time in their lives is gone. As for me, why risk it? Sure I'd love to father many children, if that's all I ever did (I mean really father not procreate) I'd be happy, but to bet that happiness on as poor a risk as a relationship? Not a good one IMHO. Of course, love changes everything, even one's perfectly soundly based opinions, that's why I consider it a mental illness. One wonders if a vaccine is possible? Perhaps my string of failures has given me some resistance? One can only hope.

      I've always wondered if I wasn't cyclothymic rather than just depressed. I certainly qualify for the diagnosis of the latter, the former is a condition like bipolar disorder (aka manic depression) but the highs are far more gentle. Sometimes an unusually elevated mood takes over and I tend to do and say stupid things. On the other hand perhaps I'm just happy since what happened Tuesday (see naughty stuff).

       I went to my semi-regular yoga class again. I find it rewarding in many ways. I am usually stiff from doing legs so the stretch is great, its a little like martial arts in the assumption of various poses and focusing on energy etcetera etcetera. Also the class is mainly female and the various poses assumed inevitably divert my mind from what one would strictly regard as yoga. Except for certain very special types of yoga.

       Well, unsurprisingly, it has happened. A woman I am interested in is not interested in me for precisely the reasons I am interested in her. To put it a little more plainly, I like strength in woman, strength of character. I on the other hand am a demanding, independent man fiercely protective of my beliefs and way of life. Part of this is my conviction that monogamy is unnecessary, perhaps detrimental to a relationship. Of course any strong woman is going to tell me to shove it with regard to that. So, three options - try and change myself, someone else, or just wait until someone strong and who agrees with me comes along. None of which are particularly inviting options, but such is life.

      I have to get a picture of this and post it - I have found a great new way to play with poopsie. We like playing the rope tug of war game, but I thought arms were probably an unfair advantage, so I stuck the rope in my mouth and she held the other and we played that way. It seemed appropriate to bark and growl through the rope, so I did. She is a strong, strong, dog, one of my teeth still hurts. Actually now that I think about it I gave up so she won that one, although Anna was trying to get in on the action. I was doing it in the front yard, probably sending property prices crashing.

       Bah! Work is lousy at the moment! It is really sucking my enthusiasm. I've got a next-of-kin who believes we are conspiring against her mother, more cancer and more death. I seem to have a knack for both these days. Oh and my 100% hit rate continues - any time I've been asked to see someone who's fallen and has a sore hip, its been fractured. Cardiology, save me now. Working with stroke is not making it much better, I had to tell a man he couldn't return home just for a visit because his mobility is so poor he would need an ambulance to transport him to and fro, and they are too busy to do that. That sucks ass, I have to say.  In other news, I have taken the plunge again and I am internet dating. This time I have written a profile which is totally honest and as a result damn near offensive. The site is irritating me because they keep rejecting my photo on the basis of their code.

       My mate Paul is a very good mate. He's loyal and honest to a fault, funny, reliable, interesting to talk to. For two people who really don't have all that much in common we get along tremendously well. I like to think I have taught him one or two things and I know the reverse is true. He's simply one of the genuinely nicest men I have ever met. There's nought I wouldn't do for him, including putting up with his girlfriend who hates me. C'est la vie.

      I don't know why, but I've always wanted to play with a very muscular woman. I find it intriguing, the contrast on a woman. I would also love to wrestle with someone who can give me a decent match. It's one of the few fantasies that I haven't done yet. I'm not quite sure of the appeal, or if having been there once I will want to go again. It's certainly not an urge to be dominated, indeed I want to dominate such a woman more than usual! Perhaps it's the challenge, and the recognition of obsession in another. Perhaps I'm just a pervert. Happily I have a total absence of guilt over the same.

       I really, really like anal sex. I mean really. I don't know quite why, but I love putting my cock where the sun don't shine, and putting it hard, fast and rough. In fact I was recently flattered when an exlover told me she thought the reason I had difficulty with some of my lovers is because perhaps they don't like being fucked so hard they thought they were going to faint. Ah, flattery.  I mean part of it certainly that I am a top, Dom, Master, sadist, whatever you like to call it I like doing to other people. "I'm gonna make you my bitch" has fallen from my lips once or twice, and so naturally too. There is more to my love of the most distal of the alimentary canal than that though.  Part is of course that it's taboo. Indeed it's a rejection of biology and religion. It's sex for sex's sake, with no element of reproduction intervening. Some women take it personally, feeling that it is a rejection of their femininity, reducing them. That's fine, because usually if my partners do that they get off on the base subjugation.  I used to ponder more heavily on the topic, but now, I just do it and enjoy it. Any future partners ought to beware though that this is my staple sexual diet, and like so many things about me, not subject to negotiation. Happily this is usually clear by the say second or third date.

      The girls came over to my place again last night. We drank vodka, consumed amyl, I poured honey on their pussies and licked it all clean (lots of fun, do try!). One of the girls has like DD+ tits, I was going nuts on them, grunting and trying vainly to jam even a small fraction in my mouth while she rode me and her girlfriend watched. Mmmmmm, breasts. Only lactation could have made it better. Of note I didn't cum. This is not unusual, it takes a lot of friction to make me cum and sometimes when I've had a really good time and the moment passes, well I just let it pass. Still great, great fucking. Is this how many women feel about sex and orgasms?

      Just another kink I want to try. There's a certain type of girl who can carry it off, I'm thinking of the monster-cum-girl in  The Fifth Element . I don't know it just makes me horny. I guess anal with a shaven headed bodybuilding older women while watching scat and bestiality would be my ultimate sexual experience, but only at the moment. Who knows what tomorrow will bring?

      I've decided there is another category of sexual interests - things I'd like to see in real life but not be involved in. Here fits things such as scat and bestiality. Now these are nasty, filthy things and I wouldn't want to be directly involved nor in fact have anything to do with anyone who had, but I wouldn't mind watching it happen. It's the combined fascination and repulsion that does it. You would want to look away yet couldn't. There's another category of things in my mind called would be kinky but just aren't ever going to happen and I'm not going to tell anyone what's in there.

      Aunty flo is an american euphemism for menses. One of the girls I shagged in the threesome was on her rags. I have no problem with that. In fact I have been thinking about it since and regretting that I didn't eat her out. Mmmmm kinky. I mean, when you've seen the things coming out of a pussy that I have, a little blood is nothing.

      It just goes to show you never know. I was relaxing at home Tuesday evening, expecting an evening of study, when I got an invitation to join two young women whose acquaintance I had recently made for a threesome. So, as you might expect, I did. It was good. Interestingly neither liked direct clitoral stimulation, finding it too intense. Both were sore the next the next day, as was I in fact. That has to be a sign of good things, right? Most importantly, there were no guilt-trips, hang-ups, jealousy or freak-outs afterwards. So I have to retract my earlier comments about younger women making lousy lovers. I hope to report further shenanigans soon.

      Now I don't want to seem to be harping on about a topic, but I'm not finished with anal sex. It's very common. I haven't met a girl sexually active for a few years who hasn't tried it. Now of course, thats a very biased sample, but every single one of them! Generally it has been a lousy experience, many men don't realise that it's not the same as a vagina, you can't just whack it in and expect them not to scream in severe pain as their rectum and anus spasms uncontrollably. Many women once given a more gentle introduction find it a very satisfying experience. Any men, well, gay men i needn't comment upon, but I make the point that strap-ons are a very popular item but often not purchased for use upon the distaff gender. As are transexual prostitutes. My lesbians friends were always playing in the back garden. So that covers just about everyone. Why's that? Why does it feel good? I am a fan of evolutionary psychology as regular readers will know. I think it again stems from the human species use of sex as a social tool for cohesion. It seems a remarkable coincidence that the prostate gland is situated just so, now don't you think? It is of course tremendous taboo and I know girls who admit to me they love it but not to their best friends, from whom they are supposed to withhold nothing. It's not much discussed amongst straight men, so I intend to undertake a survey of my mates. I publish the results when available.
