         Whew! What a hot day...God, it's still April! The fourth month of the year! How hot is it going to be in July? With an attribution to favor winter...I'd better start thinking about the strategies to endure the upcoming (Japanese) summer. Winter is the most wonderful season and I'll write all about it...hmm...maybe when the real summer arrives, as a part of my complaints against the summer.      Different topic. There's this phrase, which I have been shouting over and over in my mind, (occasionally, out loud) every time my weight went on my heels for the past three days. "  OW!!!  " for the right and "  OW!!!!!  " for my left. It all started on Friday afternoon. The training menu for my group in the tennis club for the day was,       Appetizer - 1 lap around the Inner Loop (  gaishu  )     Entr√©e - 4 laps around the Outer Loop (  daigaishu  ) (that is about 12 km in distance)     Dessert - stretching       This was my first running since the 6th year started and as being an addict to the comedy "Friends" during the spring break, this was tough for me. I mean   REALLY TOUGH  . (No offense) But I couldn't give up without a try, so I ran though the full 4 laps around the Outer Loop. I didn't notice any change during that day. The pain came the next day. I've run 12 km in the past and this has never happened before. Also, being healthy for all of my lifetime so far, these symptoms usually went away by the next morning, which gave me the judgment of passing the visit to the orthopedist on Saturday.     Unfortunately, thing were a little different this time. The pain was still there.      "I've gotta go see the doctor right now!"       This was what I thought up inside my head the moment I woke up on Sunday. But...problems.       Un - I didn't know where the insurance thingy was placed inside our house.     Deux - My dad was in Amsterdam, my mom was in this tennis tournament in Fujisawa. No means of asking the location.     Trois - Most of the hospitals are closed on Sundays.       Another postponement. Damn! Then, without any measures against the symptom, the sun came up again as it did for the past gazillion years. There came Monday, the school day. The condition did not change at all. In fact, it became worse. I believe that the pain I had on Monday had about 25 exclamation points after "OW". Successfully living through the day bearing the pain, I dragged my feet into the local orthopedist. After couple of questions, a snap on the x-ray and a few minute wait, ta-da! The diagnosis was told.       The symptom is called "  plantar fasciitis  " and the doctor told me that the pain was coming from inflammations on some nerves inside my feet. He prescribed me some poultice. Currently, in the stage of cure, I am looking forward to see the number of those exclamation points decrease, taking the "O" and "W" out with them. But, uh-oh. Darn it! I'm going to have to run the 1500 m endurance run, do the ball throw measurement and make a 50 m dash...alone. I guess I'll just have to call this "side effect"...bummer...

         I'm not going to say anything specific and I can't describe it well enough in words, but this "thing" which I thought was really nice and heartwarming happened today, which helped me get out of the quicksand of melancholy in a great amount. If you're looking at this by any chance...thank you very much.

         Today, was the "tanabata" festival! I've never enjoyed this event in the past 2 years, but this year, it was quite enjoyable, due to the enthusiasm I was able to bring along with me to the event.       The quiz rally...my team did quite well on the first round; we moved onto the second round without going through any of the "loser-revival" rounds. Google helped us out greatly, although I believe the teamwork was the main element that gave us the strength necessary for this achievement! :-) Second round on the other hand, even though we were close enough to advancement, all of the uncontrolled, disordered "kiddies" cooled down my team and I, which made us conclude that we went far enough to meet our desires. What if we continued on? Maybe we would've been the memorable champions of the 1st annual quiz rally...wait a minute! The team name was too embarassing to be engraved on the winning trophy. lol But I had fun! Thanks for the "surprise" registration!      After I retired the quiz rally, I went along with this group of "2 Rui" guys to this famous ramen place. Although the temperature today was around 35C, all of us ordered normal ramens, and finished the every last bit of it. Yes, I was close to evaporation, but as everyone says, the ramen there was delicious!       Then, after fulfilling our stomaches, we all went back to school, and watched the stage lives from 1 p.m. Nevertheless in different groups, couple of my classmates went on the stage, and performed band songs and a ca pellas. I thought they did well, despite the harshness of the environment of the gymnasium. Subsequently, I continued on hanging out with these guys, by going on seeing the acting club's performance. Due to my misunderstanding, I was only able to see the last 5 min. or so...but from my observation, I think they did well. I hope they will be able to receive high evaluation on the prefectural tournaments.      Lastly, we went back to the gymnasium and saw the last two performances written on the program. In spite of the heat and exaustion, I was able to enjoy my final "tanabatasai" without regrets. Another page of my high school life has turned today...

         Even though I don't remember going forward for participation, it seems like I am going to participate in the quiz rally kinda thing, which is planned as the main event tomorrow at the "tanabata" festival in my school. I will do my best with my unidentified team members...I wonder who I am registered with. Curious.      In fact, today is the actual "tanabata". Air pollution in the recent years have made the "amanogawa" or the milky way, more difficult to observe than ever before. I don't know how "tanabata" became a holiday, or the derivation of the story. Actually, I'm not confident on whether I will be able to tell the story behing "tanabata" completely. If anyone knows, please explain these facts to me on this chance! :-)      All of the finals came back into my hands. The results...so far, so good! :-) I'm eager to find out what my teachers are going to give me this semester. My goal is an average of 8.0, and the current calculation based on my test scores is giving out 8.2 as my average for this semester. I hope this calculation is going to become a reality!

         The Rolling Stones - (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction       I can't get no satisfaction,     I can't get no satisfaction.     'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try.     I can't get no, I can't get no.       Classical, isn't it? This is the state I believe I'm in now, and the problem is...I don't understand why. Surprisingly, I'm in despair, and is in the most negative condition I've ever experienced. My grades are not revealed, so I'm not sure yet, but from the test scores, I am quite sure I did well this semester. Therefore, I should be, and I probably am satisfied academically. The problem, I think lies in another area. What is this feeling I have, continuously saying that I'm "missing" or "slipping" an important factor? Why do I think I have a huge hole in my heart, just like the Hydrogen Ion, missing an electron?       When I think I'm just about to grab something, the hesitation slips them all out of my hand. I believe I have done it again. My life recently is definately not fulfilling.       Economically, I assume I am able to place my desires within my hands.     Academically, it's highly likely I will achieve my goals.     Health? No problem. Environment? I believe I'm surrounded by irreplacable friends of both sexes.       THEN WHAT IS IT?     Is it just my over expectation?     Is it possible to be completely satisfied in the present day world?     What is it I lack?     What are the ways to obtain that? Jealousy...?       I would not want to live, carrying around regrets in the future. As a positive person, this state is really exhausting, disgusting, tiring, contaminating, unpleasant...please add on more negative words for more realism. There is another semester left in high school. My objective...find out and cure this "hollowness" lying within my heart. I hope I will become truly, happy as soon as possible.

         Nothing special happened today. I just stayed home, slept, took a nap, dozed off, and snoozed. lol      There was the Upper House election today, and the Democratic Party is making a good fight against the Liberal Democratic Party. It's not that I support the Democratic Party, but I assume that the current political balance of power is unbeneficial for Japan, since the ruling parties are having too much power in the Diet, making them too oppressive when making new policies or laws. An ideal balance, I believe is for ruling coalition to have close to, but less than half of the seats. This system would prevent the ruling parties to force the bills through the parliament, like in the cases of the pention bills last year.       Japanese politic is moving torwards two-party system. This would balance the power distribution, bringing on more logical, beneficial debates in the parliament, and a possible cabinet change. What will the new admininstration do for us? This question is answered only from the ballots the voters place in these elections. The current poll rate is too low in this country. Election is a major factor of your life. It's decision will effect your life from various directions, and I can't understand why people are giving away their votes on a matter this large...gradually, the results are coming out. These new lawmakers are going to shoulder one factor of this nation's future...good luck to them all!

                Before I head off to my grandparents, I would like to write down this...thought.    Night, is the most peculiar time period of the day...its unique environment with the silence, and its lack of luminosity makes me think of such irrelavant and unimportant matters to a degree, where it keeps on going deeper and deeper like a quicksand or a blackhole, which as a result, ripens another issue...although in most cases, these issues are exaggerated in term of desperateness, within my mind. The conclusions gained from these unpractical thoughts are often false and depressing. The time period in which this "phenomenon" often occurs, is around midnight.    ..is there any "psychological force" that is generated during the nighttime? If so, I would love to remove whatever matter that is causing this melancholy...a pill, an ointment, a shot, a vaccine...whatever! Its making me negative, and insane, simultaneously making me lose my confidence, which is insufficient in the first place. chagrin...pressure...dissatisfaction...distrust....oh, bullshit!!!

         Summer vacation has begun. My first day...nothing! I was asleep up till 1 or 2 in the afternoon, and my scheduled plan for today, which was to go off to the beach, to do some reading/examination on my graduation thesis, was ruined from the gradual appearance of clouds. As a matter of fact, it did rain a bit in the afternoon, so it was a clever choice, although I wasn't able to accomplish anything today. I'll make this attempt again tomorrow, since the forecast seems fine for now. Another thing. In case my classmates come over to see the fireworks on the 30th, I'd better prepare for their arrival, by making a research on matters such as the location for the sighting. So far, I've been able to fill in plans for 22-25 of July. Hopefully, this habit will continue on, until the "back to school".     I've seen that many of my classmates have actually begun their graduation thesis...unbelievable. In my case, I haven't even read the minimal amount of resources I've gathered...I presume the road is rough ahead. I'm not sure whether I'll actually be able to "construct" proper Japanese, especially with the "kanjis" I must exercise in order for completion. Maybe I'm in a bind...better be more easy going, but not too much.     Other than the theses, I'll have to write a report on Japanese history, home economics, and work on the project I've planned on doing for Mathmatics. Some vague ideas are in my mind already for all of these assignments, but I must add them on with more specific and accurate information for realization. If possible, I would really like to finish them off before my visit to Bali. I'd better head off to libraries to collect resources on "Narita Airport", "Tokaido", and "New York"...see you there.    One last thing, my grades. I was not able to reach the goal I've set for this semester, and I'm pretty disappointed about it. My first steps toward my new goal set for the 2nd semester are these assignments given over the summer. I'll make an 120% effort into all of them, and will not repeat the regret I've had this semester...again.

         The aftermath of last night's fireworks haven't burnt out yet...I can't type it into words, but it was just GREAT! From what I see in everyone's blogs, the project seemed favorble. I even found 2 similarities in everyone's blogs. lol My schedule today was turned though; I was "free" most of the day, and went to dinner at night. The reason for quotes is because I'm not supposed to be free...I should be working on the thesis. lol The food was delicious.     I was watching the Asia Cup soccer with my family after we came home. The game was sooooo irritating!!! I'm not really a soccer fan, therefore I probably lack the right to criticize the players, but it was like..."Why can't you just score on a chance like that!?". The game ended with a score of 1-1, and it was given additional 30 min. for extension. By nature, the Japanese team should've finished off the game by scoreing during the extension, but they were not able to make a decisive move, which brought the game to penalty kicks.     The Japanese team missed the first 2 kicks...they actually SLIPPED physically. I thought they ran too much prior to the kick. Why couldn't they just kicked normally into the goal, with some fainting perhaps? The kick would've been much more accurate. The Jordanian team on the other hand, goaled the first two, and the Japanese team was on the edge. Luckily, we were able to score 3 in a row, and the keeper Kawaguchi blocked all of the Jordanian attempts. Then, both teams missed the first sudden death kick, and on the 2nd attempt, Japan scored, Jordan missed, and as a result, Japan was somehow able to move on.     The lack of decisive moves has been the main target of criticizms against the Japanese team. Although the director has changed, it hasn't yet improved. Is it our nationality...very likely. Let's call it "Okunigara", in Japanese....perfect word, eh?

                   As the pic above shows you, the fireworks display did take place today. The weather forecast was a bit unstable, but it didn't rain at all. The fireworks were fabulous, and I had a wonderful time with it and everyone who came. This year was the 50th anniversary of my city, and the amount of fireworks launch was about 1.5 times more than an average year, plus the donated finale. Well, the naming of the starmines were a bit lame, but the contents of them were fantastic. Especially, the donated finale, supposedly costing 5 million yen, was eye-popping. This pic is showing the finalest part of the finale. We promised we are going again last year, with some seaside fun prior to the fireworks.    Whats more, I was able to think positive about the weather, and indeed the weather stayed relatively stable thoughout the day. I'm hoping today will be the turning point. Thank you guys, and all the personnels who made this great show a reality!  Oh yeah. I will never trust the forecast made by the Meteorlogical Agency again, ever. Although the turnout was good, their forecast was sooooo off!w

         I've been observing the clouds for the past...6 hours, and the weather seems to be well enough for the fireworks. I guess the fate isn't as ironic as I thought. This can be a turning point for my negativenesss...positive thinking works! Furthermore, the city's determination was felt through the radio broadcasts, telling the citizens that the fireworks are going to be carryed out as planned..for 4 times! Now, with all the "dishes" set on the table, all I have to do now is...enjoy!!! Ciao! :-)

              Really, can things get any worse? We are having a typhoon approaching, when I don't want it the most. It's supposed to be a rare, west-heading typhoon, which is only the 3rd one in the past 30 year...but who give the SHIT!? I mean come on...I'm already pissed enough about a lot of things, and yet another addition comes along.  This is INSANE!

        Recently, it seems that I'm thinking    very negatively   on issues and complexes, which is like the complete opposite of my normal self. It's true that I was an "over positive" thinker before, making beliefs at everything. But now things are quite different; I'm having doubts on everything...I also have this feeling , which is making me think I have failed and am failing on everything that are going on around me. For some reason, I conjecture I've done it again: slipped, finished, done, over...chances are going down the drain. I'm aware that a temporaral negativeness is an effective presciption to my "over positiveness", but it just isn't like me. Along with this, I'm beginning to think I'm losing myself, being flown by other individuals. Where are my opinions and ideas, which used to spurt out naturally from myself? Drought? Hope not... This is a chorus part extracted from   a song by Jason Mraz. I anticipate that this song is going to be "The Remedy" for me.       Jason Mraz - "The Remedy (I Won't Worry)"   I                  won't worry my life away.   I                  won't worry my life away.      p.s. The aftermath of Japanese blog trend has finally arrived here. Whenever I could afford to time to, I'll try writing my entrees bilingually and today will be my first attempt...the topic is a bit heavy though.

         My class's so called "culture festival people" gathered together for our first time at Mikito's house today, to discuss the culture festival project planning for the summer. Unfortunately, there were too many gizmos and entertainments in his house, which did a great job in making us play and chat around for the most of the period, instead of discussing on the details about the project.        Our rendezvous was planned at 10:30am. Most of us arrived on time, and we walked over to his house. There, we       1. hanged around in his house for a while, talking and chattering about various, unrelated to the culture festival subjects.     2. while some of us were playing on the Playstation, others created a mailing list, which we plan on using for communication.     3. invented and cooked ourselve lunch, from the ingredients we gather around in the supermarket.     4. began making specific plans and date for the shootout of two of our projects.     5. continued on chit-chatting after Mina left, and Reeko came.     6. left his house at 17:00pm.       At least, we were able to make our plans for our first shootout, as seen here in number 4. Also, I hope the mailing list will act out as a connector between us and the other classmates...we are always looking forward for your participation, class! lol       One last thing. It is final that these guys are going to come over on the 30th for the fireworks. Their visit is titled, "Culture Festival Meeting 1' ", which is mainly for an entertaining purpose. I hope these meetings will increase our solidarity and friendship...of course, it will! :)

             Today was our first editing day. Could it be anymore exciting...well, it was, until I found out that those marvelous PCs mankind has invented is not as nice as we've thought. It took us the whole morning to just capture the movie data from the tape. What can you expect, it took us the whole afternoon to chop those captured data into convinient pieces.     This is our first project we plan on editing. A lot more still awaits on the "ToDo" list. I wish the experience gained from today will be useful in the future editing related projects, such as the ethics video. lol    From today's work, we were able to cut off the needed part from the other useless footages. The total data size was about 1.5GB...wow, isn't it? We booked the machine again on the 17th to actually start making the clip we plan on airing. The content? Please look forward to it. lol    Last, but not least...today's MIP(Most Impressive Person) was either "the girl who was clicking her tongue, whenever the PC didn't meet up with her desire", or was "the girl who was making an appearance in the CM from the 4th grade". If you're seeing this by any chance, yes it's you.

         Today was our filming for one of our culture festival projects. The project is still confidential among us, so I will not write anything specific, but Tatsuro...what a wonderful job. You're the best! lol Well, not just him...everyone. Thank you for your participation on a hot day like today! I think we were able to take the footages     necessary for the editing.  We were planning on editing in the Fujisawa City Library. But there was this large, analog, and boxy machine in the editing room there, and we weren't able use the tape we used to take our footages. One of the books placed in that room was dated '89. It seems like we are about the same age. lol Because of this incident, we went back to school, and reserved the editing machine in our school. From this, we are meeting again on the 6th to start editing in earnest.  I usually never "go back to school" in a case like this, meaning that I normally don't pay for anything wasteful like this. But today, I actually went back to school after we found out. Although these expenses may be     apparently wasteful, they weren't...at least for today. After we reserved the editing PC, we chatted in the library lobby until it's closure.     It was entertaining, and it definately was worth the bus fee. Oh yeah, throughout the day, the "lively girl" with the scooter was impressive...it' s quite a rare existiance in our world of 2004. lol  p.s. Tomorrow is the quiz rally! We'll do our best. lol

         My teammates for the "High School Quiz Rally" came over today, to make up plans for the upcoming event. Well, the outcome was quite clear. We didn't do anything related to the quiz; studying, researching and tactics kinda stuff. Oh yeah, like we didn't know that that was going to happen.     All we did was...please don't ask. lol  It was fun at least. That's the part that counts the most! The quiz? We'll do, we'll do.     :-)

                  Okay folks, listen to this. After I woke up today, I took my bike to the city library. The weather was not too hot, and was bearable with the breeze. It takes about 10 min. on bike to the library. Upon arrival, I noticed something that was different from my last visit...bikes that were parked there last time were not there.

             Finally! Today, I actually started writing my rough draft;     about 1,000 letters out of the necessary 12,000 for now...the dreadful graduation thesis may not be that tough after all. jk     Who cares about others? I'll just begin and finish with my pace. :-)  Along with the "project"'s beginnning, I talked about my     selection of the desired     faculty with my parents. They seemed to understand my will and goal well, and from their reactions and comments, I think I was able to get their acknowledge.  A week more till our vacation. I just can't wait!
