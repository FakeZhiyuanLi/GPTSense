      Libra is a good friend and helper to Leo. The two girls, Leo and Libra, get along very well.This girl's going to be the next read horoscope.  Plus Side:You are excellent in friendships and partnerships, meaning you play well with a team. Your charm and cooperative nature makes you a great person to smooth over rough spots when friends have a disagreement. You are an honest friend and they trust you with their deepest secrets. You are also very artistic and love drawing, painting, singing or anything else creative.  Flip Side:You have a hard time making decisions. Sometimes you are afraid of making the wrong choice, so you mope around and worry about it much longer than you should. You also get cranky when you are forced to make up your mind before you are ready!

      I will now do the Leo sign: HEY,THAT'S MY SIGN!!!! *Smiles*  Plus Side:Your sunny disposition is always a happy sight! You are fun and playful and enjoy being around people who are exciting. You always liven up a party and you make a great cheerleader for your friends! You are the first to say, "You can do it!" or "Wow! You did a great job!" You are also ambitious and know you must work hard so you can play hard!  Flip Side:You like to be noticed! While it's often a good thing to stand out in a crowd, you sometimes get pouty if you feel that others don't appreciate what you have done. You give a lot of praise to others, and you expect it back in return! Don't get your feelings hurt if they don't gush over how wonderful you are... inside they know you are terrific!  Yep,that's my sign..........Leo- The Magnificent Lion, she who rules all in the Horoscope Kingdom.........Oblivious to the evil plottings of Pisces.........Which are yet to be discovered soon.............

      Well, I worked at PetSmart for two days in a row,now. I thought my senior school photo was going to suck, but it didn't. Instead, it was one of my good ones, just like my junior one from last year- but they should have not used the yellow filter, that made my skin look weird in my school senior photo. I got jobs that I like this time,unlike yesterday. My job coach also gave me a lot of praise, and said I was working independently. I cleaned the outside of fish tanks and cleaned shelves.Maybe work isn't so bad after all.  *Happily Smiles*

         Nothing really exciting happened today. It was my dog JayJay's birthday,though.........which is real nice. I took a shower, ate lunch, talked to my online boyfriend and that was pretty much it. My dad's home now, which is great.     Just another ordinary day-Nothing much going on............

      I had to deal with people who TREAT ME LIKE SHIT lately. And I had a sucky day,because my coworker treated me like shit, arguing all the gloves were the same when there were only left-handed ones. She commented real snottily this: "FINE,BELIEVE WHATEVER YOU WANT TO BELIEVE!!!!!". And of course, there was a Yahoo user named Marial, saying complete bullshit on how IGN's official Harvest Moon board thread is not full(OH,SO, THIRTEEN THOUSANDS POSTS ON ONE THREAD BOARD ISN'T FULL??????? WRONG!!!!!!!). Geez, I'm getting real sick of people from IGN saying that same bullshit. It pisses me off. YES,IT PISSES ME OFF!!!!!!  At least I got my chicken fajita. It was the best. At least I got something good out of a sucky day like this.

      At work, one of my co-workers farted without saying "Excuse me". I don't think she knew any better,though. Dolan, my job coach said that she gives up too easily, which I agree. Plus, I had to listen to sucky Phil Collins in the car because my mom liked him. I had a pretty decent,pretty good day despite all that.Before work, at JVS(The program where I get to try all these different jobs) had a bathroom with plenty of toilets, one of them in which SOMEONE(Not my co-worker) left POOP AND URINE IN WITHOUT FLUSHING- EXTREMELY GROSS!!!!!!!! I had to flush using my shoe-covered foot, and it was a successful flush- but a little bit was still left in there. And one person went to the bathroom next to me, urined in the toilet and FARTED WITHOUT SAYING EXCUSE ME!!!!!! Jeez, when you fart, you say "Excuse me." WHAT'S SO HARD ABOUT THAT?!?!?! I'm glad my coach said I did a good job at work. I get to pat myself on the back now- YAY!!!!!!!

      Well, I'm tired from work today. It can do it to you! Since my job coach accidentaly forgot my order,so my meal wasn't ordered and made- so I was starving all through work. Oh well,lesson learned. I went to McDonald's with my mom after work, they screwed up my order, and got it right after a few times(STUPID!). And I took a shower, played Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life(which is, by the way, THE BEST GAME EVER.......). The Internet was down,until now.I'm glad the Internet's back..........Don't know what I'd do without it............Signing Off,Your Friend Rachel H.
