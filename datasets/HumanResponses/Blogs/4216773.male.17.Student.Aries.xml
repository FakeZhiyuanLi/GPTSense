      last night i set every alarm clock i know exists within ten feet of my room to go off at 10:00, because i had to work at 11 :) (not that work is good.. but.. okay, nothing good came from that. i felt like i'd been hit by a truck. 3 advil keep the big trucks away..) anyways.. work from 11-5, caitlin bothers me, but.. i guess i'll buckle down. i love my job way too much to complain. i'm working on saving up enough money to buy linkin park's "reanimation" cd. (ask me about what i mean by saving up) it's pretty good, for being 100% remixed material. anyways.. got home from work, signed on to messenger, this pops up:  Tessa - (add some crazy lil sister shit here):     when r u coming to pick me up? mortimerjones: (add some crazy geek shit here):     oh shit.. when did you want me to do that??  so yeah.. i forgot that i had to go get my sister after work. went to olivia, made my car go fast again (add r-ckl-s- e-dang-rm-nt to my record, please, officer.) and got back in time to see laura in her natural habitat -- work! no, i'm j/k. although she does work a lot, i do too.. :( laura leaves on sunday. it's sad. i think i might cry. i hope mom makes that appointment. anyways. i'm really hyper, so i think i'll go make fun of chat room people. nite

       Music:  Jon Secada - Just Another Day  Food:  Getting there.  Today was awesome. Today rocked the "hizouse." Okay.. wasn't THAT great. Rolled out of bed.. drove to Olivia. Made my car go really fast on the road back. (Don't tell my mom. She'd hurt me.) Called Laura. Excerpt from the conversation here:   Laura:  would you get your butt over here?  Me:  what's over there?  Laura:  me!  Me:  sounds like a good reason to me..  Anyways.. it's moments like that when i wonder if there's something more to our relationship, or if it's just siblingly love. Laura confuses me sometimes, but i just buckle down and make a bad joke that she laughs at.  Anyways.. in reference to the food issue, i'm going to walmart, and i'll post later. bye now.

       music:  evanescence and linkin park, with a twist of REM  food:  shoulda, coulda, didn't. oh well.  My soul feels cold. Not really.. cold, like... low temperature.. cold like.. numb. I can't feel it. I don't know if I've ever really 'felt' my soul. It's presence.. I can't remember it. Maybe I don't have a soul. Maybe I'm the one soulless being on this planet. If I am.. well, i guess that makes me unique, doesn't it? I just wish i could feel.....something. Love, happiness.. something. I don't like this at all. Mom says she's going to call the clinic monday for medicine, and for the first time in my life, I'm actually looking forwawrd to it. Music has been the only thing keeping me going lately. Music, Steve and Beth, that's all you need, right? wrong.. because eventually your depression spreads and it just makes you feel worse.  nip it in the bud, isn't that what they say? anyways.. i'm gonna go kick some ass at trivia to work off the frustrations. later.
