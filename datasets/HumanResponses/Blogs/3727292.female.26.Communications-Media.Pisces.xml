      So who's surprised that Mary Kate is anorexic? But it's funny - well, not funny, but odd or strange - that just Mary Kate is anorexic. Because look at both of them. They are both twigs! How can we say that Mary Kate is anorexic but Ashley is in tip top shape, the picture of health! They both need some help in my opinion. This skinny thing has gone on way too long. Everyone I know thought that Renee Zellweger looked better with the Bridget Jones' Diary weight. Didn't you?

      The Moviefone snafu I referred to at the movie theater: a couple of people half-jokingly suggested that someone affiliated with the right, the neocons, the Republicans, the Bushies, the Saudis, might have hacked into the technology just to affect the overall box office take for Fahrenheit 9/11. Hm...

      ...nor do I have terribly good short-term memory especially when dealing with a lot of details. So a few of my descriptions may be slightly off, such as I use Arbusto when I really mean the company that swallowed up Arbusto, Harken Energy.  For an authoritative, accurate, analytical look at the Bush-Saud relationship, read Craig Unger, either his book House of Bush-House of Saud, or his writings on salon.com. He is also interviewed in Michael Moore's documentary.

      Well last night was the big night, the opening of Fahrenheit 9/11. I had spent the previous 36 or so hours pulling strings to make it a group event. It went off pretty much without a hitch, although I was disappointed because my group of eight ended up having to buy tickets for "The Mother" instead of Fahrenheit, thereby taking away $72 from the total weekend box office take for the movie.  Hearing that the Wednesday night shows in New York were selling out, I purchased eight tickets on Moviefone.com the day before for the 9:20 p.m. show at the Clearview Clairidge Cinema in Montclair, NJ. Anyone in the area knows that this theater is the local arthouse for the Essex County area in New Jersey, and that Montclair and its surrounds (West Orange, Newark, South Orange, Maplewood, Livingston) are full of liberals - limousine liberals, academic liberals, Wall Street liberals, fine arts liberals, writer and journalists liberals.  I told my group to be inside the theater at 9 p.m. sharp, so that we could ensure a block of eight seats inside the theater. Taking the parking situation into account, they had to be in Montclair about 15 or 20 minutes beforehand. My plan was to arrive a bit earlier just to make sure that I was one of the first people to pick up our tickets.  I thought about picking up the tickets on my way home from work around 7 p.m. but by the time I got to Essex County I was so hungry and tired from sitting in traffic on the Garden State Parkway that I just went home. I figured if I get to the theater an hour before the movie started I'd be fine. I walked into the theater and there was a line already. I'm thrilled and daunted at the same time. Happy that people are so eager, worried that all my planning might not go off without a hitch.  The most disastrous part of the night came when I went to pick up my tickets from the box office. I told the young woman behind the glass (why is there glass at some movie theaters, do they get robbed a lot? I guess so, when I was a police reporter, I wrote about a couple of small movie theater robberies) that I ordered tickets from Moviefone and she rolled her eyes. Apparently the Moviefone apparatus wasn't working, perhaps because of the volume of orders (this is a small art cinema, they aren't used to crowds like this). She told me that I would have to buy another set of tickets and contact Moviefone for a refund. I'm thinking, "Eight more tickets is a lot of money." I hate waiting for refunds. I gave my debit card to her and she rang up eight tickets for "The Mother." What is this movie about? No idea.  Because of the volume, it took about five minutes for my transaction to work. People began to line up behind me and I heard a movie theater staffer tell them what the problem was. We commented on the growing line and I said, "This is what The Passion of the Christ must have been like." The movie theater worker said that this was worse. I pumped my fist and "Yes!" The woman behind me said, "We're winning!!"  At least in Montclair we are.  I'm telling this story in such detail because I feel it is a news story, its a newsworthy event and I want to tell a first-person story. I am tired of reading accounts of the movie disputing its accuracy, saying that part of the crowd just wanted to see the movie to confirm their enemy. I didn't see any of those people. But then again, I'm in Montclair.  I got on line, and my friends began to trickle in. They couldn't believe the crowds. We were worried not everyone would fit into the theater. But we found seats. We sat through previews for a movie about a young Latina who resorts to drug smuggling to make money, a flick about a hippie turned soldier who dates crazy girls (we didn't get that one), and a trailer for the movie "Garden State" which of course is a must see for me and my friends when it comes out. It looks pretty good, and the preview was complete with McMansions, gas pumps, and diners.  I'm going to see the movie again and this time bring a notebook. I didn't want to look like a nerd, so I'll go to a Sunday matinee or something. The early show. I want to recount every segment of the movie accurately and give my reaction to it. Basically, it started out with some clips of the beloved George W. Bush, who my boyfriend and I later agreed comes out looking dumb but somewhat innocuous compared to the rest of the clan, and we even concede that he might be the kind of guy it'd be fun to have a beer with. The opening clips and the entire movie gave me the impression that he really is just a puppet president and there are some very rich, twisted, evil men pulling his strings.  There's the clip of him on vacation and some reporters were questioning when he was going to get any work done. He said, "You'd be amazed at how much can get done with telephones and fax machines." Then he went on about how he would be working some "things." His tongue stumbling over itself, he finally got out the important-sounding word "initiatives," and he looked very proud of himself and expected that would satisfy the press (sadly, it does).  A few minutes into the movie they run the opening credits, and play a melange of all the movie's stars - Colin Powell, Condi Rice, Paul Wolfowitz, Rummy, John Ass-crack, and G. Dub. - prepping to go on camera. W. begins practicing his facial expressions, Wolfowitz gels his hair down with his own spit, and Attorney General Ass-crack looks somewhat human. These guys look like fun!!  Just when the audience is loving laughing at these goons, the screen goes to black and you can hear 9/11 in the background. It's unmistakable. And it's haunting. You feel bad for laughing just a second before. When the picture comes back, you see people looking on in horror, see people watching other humans hurtle from a thousand feet in the sky, millions and billions of awful dust particles swirling around...you know the whole deal, I don't even have to recount it here. Tears started welling up in my eyes.  Then the infamous classroom scene. A lot of people are making a big deal out of this, but when I came out of the movie I was convinced: he never had to leave that classroom. Planning was going on without him. He was not necessary. He just sat there, looking like, "Oh shit." Michael Moore does a voice over speculating what the president could be thinking - "maybe I'm hanging out with the wrong crowd." How true!  My review is that its a four-star movie needless to say for bringing to light plenty of goodies:  -George H. W. Bush (the one from Maine, not from Texas. That always strikes me as funny) receives daily CIA briefings. Moore says that all former presidents are entitled to such briefings but few choose to receive them. Daddy Bush does.  -The Saudi connection: This is one of the most criticized aspects of the movie because it is the most damaging. Any reporter or policy wanker who calls it a tenuous connection probably just doesn't get it. It is confusing. You're dealing with big companies, boards, takeovers, bailouts. It's a businessman's game.  (I just deleted a large section of text by accident. I'm pretty pissed.)  Basically, I had spent about five paragraphs detailing the long reach of the Saudis. Okay - they own about 6 or 7 percent of the United States, with holdings in various companies and crucial government regulated industries. They have about $1 trillion in our banks. If they were to pull out, it would mean some serious shit for our economy. Think depression.  Many years ago, a small oil company called Arbusto was doing very badly. It was on the verge of going bankrupt. It had pretty much been set up by Daddy Bush for his son, Baby Shrub. Things didn't work out so well. But who comes to the rescue? The Bin Laden family. They back Arbusto, knowing that the more they invest the more they stand to gain, helped along with favorable government regulations. The Bin Laden family invests in a lot of different American companies - with names like, oh, Carlyle Group, Halliburton, Enron, and others. Many of the company CEOs would go on to subscribe to the Project for a New American Century, which is basically for American superiority and domination, NOT for world peace and globalization that would benefit a majority. These are people like Cheney, Wolfowitz, I. Lewis Libby, Jeb Bush, Zalmay Khalilzad, etc.  Another interesting fact that Moore revealed on Howard Stern Friday was that the Saudi Royal Family bailed out EuroDisney in France when it was tanking. As a result, the theme park is 23 percent Saudi owned. No wonder Disney had no interest in distributing this movie! It WILL hurt their bottom line. Fortunately the Weinstein brothers are rich and heroic. This is why evil people hate the Jews. I happen to love Jewish people. Everyone is different, but all of the Jews I've met have been very compassionate and tolerant people.  What's even MORE scary about that juicy EuroDisney nugget is that Disney owns ABC! Think about that for a minute. ABC could affect Disney's bottom line, so it's in their interest to discredit this movie, to cheer on the war in Iraq, and to back the crooked administration. It's chilling (let's not even talk about NBC being owned by one of the biggest defense contractors in the country - maybe another post).  Okay - so now it is easy to see why this clan has been planning from the beginning to invade Iraq. Saddam and the Royal Family were not friends. The Royal Family lead a religious country, a fundamentalist country really, the kind of fundamentalism that bred Osama bin Laden, Mohammad Atta, and all their buddies. Saddam was a secularist. He would beat people for reading the Koran (reportedly). He was also sitting on top of the world's second largest reserve of oil, second only to Saudi Arabia. Plus, we know he's no pussy. Saddam's for real, shooting rifles off of balconies. Why do they do that anyway?  It's in the Saudi's interest - and in turn, ours, since they prop up our economy and more importantly, the enterprises of Bush and friends - to get rid of Saddam and control that oil wealth, or at least get another ruthless fundamentalist but money hungry and Bush-friendly regime in there. It had ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with terrorism, to any weapons threat that Saddam posed. It had to do with the threat he posed to the Saudis and to the rich Americans financially.  I say two things: I would have had more respect if they had come out and said that. I'm ashamed that a lot of Americans fell for the lies. I have to admit, because I love this country so much, I fell for the lies too, but it only lasted for 12 hours or a day, tops. Then the patriotism rush would subside and I'd be like, wait, these are some evil dudes. I knew about the Project for a New American Century a long time ago, I'm no fool.  Secondly, I don't care if they remove Saddam, since he was such a bastard. But leave it to the CIA, leave it to sanctions, like I believe Clinton was trying to do. Don't send in poor, young Americans to die. Don't bomb Iraqi houses and pretend like we have the precision bombs that go straight for the Republican Guard.  That was another thing that was revolutionary about the movie: it showed all of what the media here will not. I absolutely hate and resent the media for that. I'm ashamed to have ever been a part of the whole media matrix. We tell lies, we cover things up, we exaggerate things, we make tons of mistakes and if we don't have to correct them, we won't. It's all crap. Well, a lot of it. The best advice I can give someone is to read many different sources, from around the world, and try to meet as many different people as you can, who can tell you the real stories.  Anyway, they showed awful pictures of women burned up, scarred for life, covered in salve and immobilized by pain, pickup trucks full of dead kids, mothers screaming in front of piles of rubble that were once houses, men looking for the other half of their friends, the burned bodies of the American contractors strung up for all the angry Iraqis to see. Iraqis who are pissed. American soldiers, 18, 19, breaking into homes, throwing the men on the ground. Putting hoods on men and taking pictures of them. American soldiers whose legs have been blown apart, they're screaming in agony as their fellow soldiers carry them away on a makeshift gurney. Later, at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, you see several soldiers with amputations, a guy with no arms, guys with no legs, guys with nervous tics and nerve damage, traumatized men. It's awful. It's horrible. All so the Bushes can line their pockets and stabilize the oil market. I don't understand. We don't have to do this. This is the opposite direction.  We don't want to foment governments like the Saudi Royal Family. We don't want public beheadings. Western society had that not so long ago, and we really don't want to go back there. In the last century, we had public lynchings. I'm sure most white people don't want to go back to that. They know it was brutal. Society is evolving, and these people are willing to throw us back just to get richer and more powerful.  As far as bin Laden...that's a bad, messy situation. He's not mad at our freedom, like Bush would have you believe. If he was, he would just come here and shop at the Banana Republic and eat at Outback (beef ribs, not pork). He's mad at his government and the Bushes and the oil companies. I mean, I'm not sure EXACTLY what he is mad at. But it's not simple.  As far as war profiteering, its very clear that there are many companies jockeying to get in on all the money to be made from the war. Of course, we all know about Halliburton and how they get all the contracts, but let's not neglect the other side of the story - there are HUNDREDS of companies that want to and stand to get a piece of the action. Meanwhile, you have our soldiers lamenting that they are getting paid $3000 a month to get shot at and bombed, and you have contractors paid with the same government money getting paid $10,000 a month to drive a truck through the mideast. I'd be pissed too!  I'll write more - believe it or not I have a lot more to say. I want to comment on some of the funny things about the movie. But maybe I'll use a different post.

      This blogging thing is a little lonely and disenchanting. Here I am in this virtual community, potentially connected to hundreds of MILLIONS of people across the globe, and no one has read my blog. It's the equivalent of talking out loud to myself in an empty room. So does this make me crazy?  I was feeling alienated and disconnected because of the Information Age. Everyone predicted it. Well, a lot of sociologists whose names I can't remember because although I was a sociology minor in college I did really badly in the classes and that was many years ago. Feeling isolated, I said let me create a blog, that way I can air my opinions and people in this virtual community can respond. We can have conversations. Bounce ideas of one another. I am just bouncing back and forth from my keyboard to the bed, from my keyboard to Hotmail, from my keyboard to my car.  I had this crazy notion that as soon as I got my blog started up I was going to turn into Jeff Jarvis or Elizabeth Spiers, or one of those very successful bloggers, who are famous just because they blog. I think Elizabeth Spiers actually got a job at New York magazine because of her blog. I wish someone would throw opportunities like that my way!  Maybe it's because I'm not a New Yorker. I guess people move to New York because there are opportunities unlike any other place there. There are also a lot of really snotty people who grew up very far from New York. I've made a commitment to New Jersey, I'm making it official. I spent 18 years in Yonkers, just five minutes north of the Bronx, which is in fact New York City even though it's not "the city," and then I ended up in New Jersey. I had hatred for New Jersey. I mocked all of my classmates and roommates in college. I pretended I was so cool, fronted in an effort to put down New Jersey and elevate New Yorker. After a few years, when I grew up and became part of reality, I started noticing some slight but significant things. Like my taxes. Like the price of cigarettes. And groceries. And gas. And mixed drinks. And just about everything else.  For a few years I spent every single weekend in "the city." Wasted lots of money on gin and tonics and $25 and $30 cover charges to get into smelly clubs. Met a lot of very shallow guys. Met a few people with STDs. After a certain point (I think it was when the Port Authority boosted the Lincoln Tunnel toll from $4 to $6), I got tired of it and screw New York. I'd go to Westchester to visit my parents and that's about it. I'd go for an anti-war protest, or if a friend was having a birthday party. Otherwise, I became content to live my little humdrum life in New Jersey, where people from "the city" assume that we don't have Century 21 and H&M (we have both), we don't know a thing about art and culture (ever heard of William Carlos Williams? I didn't think so), and we're surrounded by ugly strip malls and chain pharmacies (well, that's true but what the hell is Duane Reade?).  Personally, I like having the city right across the river but not having to deal with the aggravation of the hot swarms. I can hop over whenever I want for whatever I want. Sure, I can't stroll to Bryant Park or Chelsea Pier when there's something cool going on. But I can read the New Yorker just like anyone else and go see a show. What's better, I can go to Montclair Day or the NJPAC or the Newark Museum and be in the company of mostly native New Jerseyans, and New Yorkers, and everyone is generally down to earth. I don't have to be paranoid that every man I meet is trying to get in my pants, and I don't have to wrack (rack?) my brain to think of something really impressive and cool that I've done in the past week. I can just be me. If I want to go to the Clairidge Cinema in Montclair and take in an art flick, that's fine. If I want to go to the Eagle Rock Lanes, that's cool too. And if I want to stay home and watch the Sopranos, well, that's one thing that New Jerseyans and people who live in "the city" have in common.  So my point is...doesn't some chic magazine need a New Jersey correspondent????? Oh yeah -- and how do I get my blog to hit big on a Google search? Any bored aimless person who finds their way to this site and has a clue, please let me know.

       urlLink Yahoo! News - Group Asks FEC About 'Fahrenheit' Ads   Let's salute Harvey and Bob Weinstein for finding a way to get "Fahrenheit 9/11" distributed. Those are two rich motherf'ers from Hollywood who are putting their money to good use. I am so excited about Friday night and this movie. A group of eight of my friends are going to see it. I could have just seen it alone, or with me and my boyfriend, but I wanted to do my part to boost the opening weekend numbers. We know it's going to be number on anyway, but I want it to be record-breaking, the kind of record no one is going to touch for a long time. This is such an important film and although I know most people seeing it will be liberals and anti-Bushites and so on, I'm hoping a large contingent of the so-called "swing voters" will go see this movie and come out persuaded to throw Shrub out of office. GO SEE THIS FILM.

      What exactly am I supposed to do on a blog? Cause I'm reading some and it's like people just want to tell you every damn thing about their lives. I just read something about how someone slipped on a stair. I'm sorry - I don't give a damn!  So I know no one is going to give a damn about anything I write, but who cares? I left journalism about a month ago. A little more than a month. I left to go to a university, my alma mater, and work on internal communications. Essentially, writing and editing the campus newspaper for faculty and staff. Considering the size of the university, the circulation's not bad - 13,000. I left a 180,000 circ. paper, so at first I had a bit of anxiety that not a lot of people were going to be reading my stuff. But then I figured that the intelligence of the people reading my stories now would outweigh the number of unwashed philistines reading my useless drivel.  I'm just kidding of course, all of us journalists are elitist to a degree. I just choose to joke about it and not hide it. We need to stop pretending in this country, we need to talk about our flaws and our perversions and get it all out. Just like a man who bottles up his anger, one day he will explode. We don't want that to happen, so I'm all about being open and honest.  Too bad the rest of the media aren't! That's why I had to leave.

      Ryan is one of my best friends and a former roommate of mine. We used to sit in our sparsely furnished apartment in New Brunswick and have political conversations for hours and hours. He is one of the main reasons I strive to be aware now and seek information from many sources. He would always read the Times on Sunday, and I was always very intimidated by the Times, such volume, so much information on a Sunday, when all I wanted to do was nothing.  Well, I still don't read the Sunday Times - it's so daunting - but I remember the conversations Ryan and I used to have around the Times laid out all over the floor. Many of them were about Bill Clinton. We used to say that the Constitution should be suspended for the duration of Clinton's life, that he should be made King, and only after his death would we consider going back to a democracy, unless of course Chelsea proved to be a worthy and willing successor (I think she would be, she's fab). I'm shilling Bill Clinton's book, not that it needs anymore hype or press, but it's important to stamp his legacy on the minds of the American people. Life under Bill Clinton was wonderful, and if the man needed blow jobs to get by, to relieve the stresses of the presidency and that damn Republican congress, well let him have it! I don't care what's going on  under  his desk, I care what's going on on  top  of his desk!

      The creation of this blog was inspired by the movie "Control Room," so many thanks to director Jehane Noujaim, a very courageous woman for putting this movie out in a hostile country run by gangsters, criminals, and ne'er-do-wells. Yes, I mean the current administration!  It's on the people to seek out information. Don't just take the evening news at face value, whether you're watching Faux News or Al-Jazeera (the subject of Noujaim's documentary). Take it from me, a former journalist. I know how trends are invented, how press releases are rewritten as news, how some stories make the front page and others never make it at all. I'm not disparaging the entire profession, there are still some noble practitioners out there. But the number within the mainstream media are dwindling.  Go see Control Room instead of Shrek 2. Or in addition to. Sneak into Control Room after Shrek 2 is over. I don't care how you do it, just do it. You need to see the footage of dead soldiers and bloody Iraqis, the footage you'll never find on Fox or CNN. You need to see the Arab TV journalists, laughing, smoking, cracking jokes, like human beings. They are actually human beings, not some machines pumping out lies like Rumsfeld refers to them. I think he must have been looking in the mirror when he made that claim.  Then watch the human Arab TV people die when "coalition" forces bomb their Baghdad headquarters. Mistake? Think not, because Al-Jazeera gave the U.S. military their coordinates so that kind of thing wouldn't happen...  I could go on and on but I am at work. I'll be back though. The point is, we have to up the ante in these months running up to the war for the White House. You, me, and we.

      So this past week was the first time I attended a journalism convention without being a journalist. Quite interesting, especially since the UNITY 2004 convention was historic in other ways: it was the largest meeting of journalists ever (reportedly more than 8,000 people registered), and we graciously hosted presidential candidate John Kerry and President George W. Bush.  Well, the "graciously hosted" part is in dispute. I may have been one of the biggest offenders of journalistic decorum at this year's convention in Washington D.C., where we so warmly received John Kerry and snickered, rolled our eyes, laughed and heckled George W. Bush.  I was loving it. See, this is the freedom I was looking for when I left the journalism business not even three months ago. The freedom to support any political candidate of my choosing, the freedom to use my very limited funds to influence some policy, the freedom to volunteer for a political or advocacy group. The freedom to not just document abuses, but fight against them. Not just to report injustice, but to join forces with people to ensure justice. And most importantly, the freedom to decorate my car with the bumper stickers of my choosing and stake signs in my lawn without fear of being castigated!  I've read dozens of articles questioning the political bias of the journalists at the convention, whether the convention attendees should have cheered when John Kerry said he would have left that Florida classroom immediately or laughed at George W. Bush as he stumbled over a non-answer. But I have to reveal one very important fact: we were not all journalists.  A working journalist just three months before, I left the business and now work for a very prestigious public university. So I felt no guilt when I raised my hands above my head to applaud Kerry's denouncement of media consolidation. I felt no guilt when I screamed at the top of my lungs at the end of his speech. Likewise, I felt no guilt when I rolled my eyes at Bush's recounting of his alleged successes with the unfunded No Child Left Behind act.  I was free.  I hate to break it to the people looking to use the convention as evidence of a clearly partisan, liberal media, but I'm not a journalist and I wasn't the only one. There were public relations practitioners in attendance. There were advertisers, television talent agents, marketing professionals, volunteers, Democratic Party officials, exhibitors, merchants, partisan columnists and reporters.  I would like to offer some insight into why I left the business and why that is so closely linked with the events at Unity last week. It's very personal and by no means am I preaching. I applaud most individual journalists; I can't applaud the industry as it stands now, but that's another topic.  For me, after some time, my "journalist" identity became an obstacle to my development as a full participant in society. I had concerns as a journalist; I just found my concerns as a woman came first. My concerns as a taxpayer. As a black woman. As a Puerto Rican woman, and as a multicultural woman. As a friend of gays and lesbians, as a registered voter, as a believer in justice and American goodwill.  All of those identities have been offended by President Bush and the rest of his clan. I'm going to evoke a bit of Barack Obama now, but when Bush props up a constitutional amendment discriminating against gay marriage, I take it personally. When he wins an election at the cost of 1 million African Americans having their voting rights squelched, I'm offended. When those in his administration seek the medical records of women who have gone to Planned Parenthood for abortions, I'm offended. When innocent Arab and Muslim men are locked up for more than a year, I am extremely offended. When we're paying for a war using a government credit card and the rich get to keep more and more of their money, I'm offended.  And as a former journalist, I would venture to say that many of those reporters, editors, producers, broadcasters, publishers, researchers, writers, whatever, were offended as journalists by the Bush administration. Offended by the lies they told in order to lead us into an awful, questionable war. Offended by the limited information coming out of daily press briefings. Offended by the president and vice president testifying about one of the worst disasters in history behind closed doors. Did you all forget that? Maybe they are offended by a White House clan that questions the ethnicity of a photographer before allowing the women to take photos. As a former journalist, I am very offended.  So to all you holier-than-thou journalists who think my behavior and that of others was embarrassing and shameful, do your job and take the time to analyze a complex issue instead of staking out a position and not hearing out the other side. I happen to know more than a few people in the industry who believe that newspeople should be more forthcoming about their true ideological leanings instead of feigning an unattainable level of objectivity. It's like the guy who makes Black and Puerto Rican jokes at home and then smiles in my face at work. I'd rather he tell the jokes to my face. At least I know where he's coming from.  Maybe the journalists and other communications professionals at the convention were making a statement. In laughing off President Bush, maybe we were saying we are sick of him misleading us - lying to us - as journalists, women, people of color, defenders of civil liberties and human rights. In cheering John Kerry, maybe we were sending a message to him that we're looking for an administration that does not hide behind lies and use the media to promote wedge issues and divide Americans when we are most vulnerable.  It's obvious minority journalists are mad at Bush for something. Do your job and ask why.  Ashanti M. Alvarez is a former newspaper reporter and a communications professional based in New Jersey.

      I'm POd. CNN lies. ABC lies. CBS lies. NBC lies. Do I even have to say it - FOX lies.  I live in West Orange, New Jersey, about five miles outside of Newark, where there was supposed to be a major terrorist attack at the Prudential building yesterday. Or three years ago. Or three years from now. Who knows?  But pasty pawn Tom Ridge of the Homeland Security department forced the city of Newark as well as NYC and DC to spend countless dollars, from local, county, and state tax money, on overtime and extra personnel to secure the buildings threatened by terrorists.  One problem: The information about the intended attacks was obtained two to three years ago. Pre-9/11. What's more, Tom Ridge himself admitted that he had no idea about the timing of the attacks.  So why now? Why whip us into a frenzy right now? Why didn't someone tell us before 9/11? I'm even willing to cut them some slack, but the minute 9/11 happened, all of this information should have been used to put a security plan into action. If the Prudential building is really a target, shouldn't it have been secured from the moment they found out, if they have no idea of when these attacks would be carried out? Where would the money come from? Maybe from the federal government, maybe from the $700 billion or so that we used to have before Bush cut checks to the richest Americans. WE NEED THAT MONEY.  Do you think that because Bush gave you one or two $300 checks that he can buy your complacency? Think again. Think about how much money the really rich folk are getting back. I don't know about you, but I used my tax cut money to go to Amsterdam. That's about all it was good for. I didn't really need it. Why are we cutting taxes in a time of war?  Oh my God. It's just scary.

      For the 1.32 people out there who have been reading my blog, I thank you and I'm back! It's hard to blog with a boyfriend in the house who is designing a web site. He is on this machine all night, every night.  The real reason is - I've been lazy.  I'm reading The Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Against the United States - the 9/11 report. Even though it is an Amazon bestseller, it's only sold about 1 million copies. I imagine many thousands of those have been purchased by policy wonks, think tanks, and other government types. I kind of wish 160 million copies had been sold, one for every household. The 9/11 commission report cannot be covered in any news story or broadcast. You need to read it yourself, if you care about America.  If you are a true patriot, you need to read this report.  It is not lacking in excitement, history, education. It's written in an engaging manner, and how can a 500 page publication about spies and terrorists be boring? For anyone who has enjoyed Die Hard, 24, Spy Games, etc., this book should be enjoyable as well.  I'm only about 100 pages into it - very small text. But so far, the best parts have been the chapter explaining al-Qaeda, putting it into historical context. It takes you from the end of the Afghan-Soviet war up until around 1998, when Bin Ladin issued his second fatwa commanding all Muslims to kill Americans and Westerners. It does not reduce the rebel group to the terrorist rhetoric meant to scare Americans. The report manages to remain apolitical and, depending on how you read it, whichever prism you're gazing through, actually makes the President look quite ineffectual.  Also fascinating is the confused description of the timeline of events on Sept. 11. From the recounting of events on each plane to Vice President Dick Cheney making the call to shootdown aircraft gone astray (that call is the President's to make), it's amazing. It takes some strong brain power to follow the minute-by-minute accounts, and hopefully reading this book will help me ward off Alzheimer's disease in the future. Mental exercise is the key, some think.  At any rate, please do your duty as an American. Sept. 11 was a major turning point. I would argue that nothing is more important now than our security and our actions as a country will undoubtedly have ramifications for everyone across the globe in the years to come. What happened that day was a national trauma. Millions of dollars have been spent investigating this crime and the actors, on either side. Don't you want to know what happened?
