						   Diego A. Odchimar, III   ABSTRACT: The problem of justification of the existence of god forces believers in god to abandon faith in favor of humanism.  We are living today at a moment where there is a growing tendency to abhor “arguments from authority” and the disenchantment of the world caused by the logic of science is widespread. The project of this essay is to reconcile religion with secular moralities.   KEY WORDS: god, devil, religion, anthropocentrism, enlightenment, disenchantment, materialism, Aquinas, Feuerbach, Nietzsche, Marx, Freud, Dostoyevsky, Voltaire, Kant, Pascal, James   	GOD and the devil could merely be phantasms, the projections of unconscious conflicts. Sigmund Freud, author of The Future of an Illusion, argues that monotheistic religions are giant obsessional neurosis that has affected every dimension of humanity. Freud’s psychoanalytic theory claims that the devil is made up of everything that belongs to us but we dare not live -- the sum of our repressed desires and of that deeper-lying life we repress.1 It follows that what holds for the devil, that he is only a projection of our unconscious, should also hold for god.  	Ludwig Feuerbach, author of The Essence of Christianity, anticipated the views of Nietzsche, Marx and Freud when he claimed that god is an idealized image of man projected into the heavens and that religion is an instrument of established power to perpetuate its influence by permanently incapacitating those who fight against it.2 Feuerbach argues that the idea of God had alienated man from his own nature by positing an impossible perfection over against human frailty. Thus, God was infinite, man finite, God almighty, man weak; God holy, man sinful. The idea of God created a negative conception of human nature.   AQUINAS’ PROOFS  	“Unless you have faith, you will not understand.” This is Anselm’s often quoted credo ut intellegam taken from the words of Isaiah.  	As it were, believers do not seek to understand in order to have faith but they have faith in order to understand. Nevertheless, some Christian scholars believe that God could be an object of thought. This implies that God can be comprehended by human mind and argued rationally. They devised their own proofs of God’s existence to their satisfaction. Among them is Thomas Aquinas, author of Summa Theologica, the Doctor of the Catholic church. Aquinas lists five proofs for the existence of God that would become immensely important in the Catholic world and would also be used by Protestants:   1.	Aristotle’s arguments for a Prime Mover. 2.	The argument for a First Cause, that there cannot be an infinite series of causes: there must have been a beginning. 3.	The argument from contingency, propounded by Ibn Sina, which demands the existence of a “Necessary Being.” 4.	Aristotle’s argument that the hierarchy of excellence implies a Perfection that is the best of all. 5.	The argument from design, which maintains that the order and purpose that we see in the universe cannot simply be the result of chance.  But these proofs are suspect today. They are dubious because they reduce the nature of God, if there is such a being, into something accessible to human mind like another existing corporeal being. Karen Armstrong, A History of God: The 4,000-Year Quest of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, these attempts to prove the existence of God makes God an idol, created in man’s image and easily turned into a celestial super ego.3 If it is any consolation, Aristotle, as well as Abu Ali ibn Sina (Avecina), concludes that God is far too exalted to descend to the knowledge of such ignoble, particular beings as men and their ways.    ABRAHAM’S DILEMMA  	Abraham believed that it was God talking to him. God told him to sacrifice his son. It was an appalling demand. Abraham had decided to trust his god and must sacrifice his only son to him.  Karen Armstrong comments that this is a horrible story that depicts God as a despotic and capricious sadist. Even children will reject such a deity. Worse, the well known story of the Exodus from Egypt, probably a mythical rendering of a successful peasant revolt against the suzerainty of Egypt, betrays a brutal, savage god who is passionately partial and exclusive, has little compassion for anyone except his own favorites.4 Obviously, this vengeful god of war known as Yahweh Sabaoth (god of the armies), is merely a tribal deity who promised to participate in the history of his people and demanded a violent repression of other gods and faiths.5  	Perhaps, this is why monotheists kill each other. All too often, up to this day, conventional believers use the idea of a partisan God to prop up their own loves and hates. Jews, Christians and Muslims punctiliously attend divine services and decorous liturgy yet denigrate people who belong to different faith. All three of these monotheistic religions have become so conspicuously cruel and intolerant.6  	It is in this manner that the God of monotheists is an idol, an exterior reality out there, a projection of man’s fears and desires. They conceived God as someone who responds to them in a personal way: God is offended by sin, God can love them, God can be angry. It follows that rituals must be performed to thank and praise him for creating the world, fertility, etc. This is also why, as if one’s destiny is not determined by one’s own actions, some believers blame God for the irresponsible behavior of human beings (e.g. suffering is a punishment by God for sins).   EUTHYPHRO’S DILEMMA  	In Plato’s dialogue Euthyphro, Socrates asked Euthyphro, “Is what is holy holy because the gods approve it, or do they approve it because it is holy?”7 Arguments from authority are grounded on the belief that what is holy is holy because the gods approve it. There is no independent basis according to which the holiness of what is holy may be evaluated apart from the approval or disapproval of the gods.  Holy is differently understood. As regards the religious experience of the Jews, Christians and Muslims, holy means separation of God from man. All we can be sure of in the experience of Moses is that Yahweeh is a God who inspires terror and insists on distance. When Moses went closer to the bush that burned without being consumed, Yahweh told him, “Come no nearer. Take off your shoes for the place on which you stand is holy ground.” This is graphically clear in the story of Mount Sinai. Moses warned the Israelites, “Take care not to go up the mountain or touch the foot of it. Whoever touches the mountain will be out to death.”8 Holiness demands that believers are filled with mortal terror and instill in them the self-abnegating feeling of inadequacy and ritual impurity. This is the danger of idolatrous religiosity.   	The Greeks, on the other hand are more interested in the good life and the question of justice in society. Thus, for Aristotle and Plato, holy means moral excellence. Like the young man Siddhartha Gautama, who abandoned all social ties and responsibilities to seek enlightenment, the Greeks believe that man can be holy by living a life of compassion for all living beings, acquiring the habit of speaking and behaving gently, kindly and accurately and refraining from anything like drugs or intoxicants that cloud the mind. This was a symptom of a cultural change that was characteristic of the newly civilized world.9    COPERNICUS’ SCIENCE  	Straightforward scientific facts have warranted the conviction that God does not exist.   In 1530, the book De revolutionibus of Nicolaus Copernicus, which claimed that the sun is the center of the universe, was placed by the Catholic church on the index of Proscribed Books because it contradicted the word of God in scripture. The church was so obsessed with imposing intellectual conformity that scientific study was inhibited and challenges against it are summoned before the Inquisition.  During the enlightenment, by the end of the sixteenth century, the West had embarked on a process of technicalization that would produce an entirely different kind of society and a new ideal of humanity.10 The gods were no longer very important. It was the time when man left his self-caused immaturity. Kant explains that immaturity is the incapacity to use one’s own intelligence without the guidance of another. Such immaturity is self-caused if it is not caused by lack of intelligence, but by lack of determination and courage to use one’s intelligence without being guided by another. He exhorted humanity: “Have the courage to use your own intelligence!”11 All that is required for this enlightenment is freedom. On this view, there can be morality without God. Rape is wrong not because God condemns it. If rape would not be wrong because God did not condemn it, then right or wrong is based on God’s arbitrary condemnation. Thus, the enlightened moral opinion suggests that there is an objective ground for morality. For Kant, therefore, the idea of God was merely a convenience. God was merely tacked on to the ethical system as an afterthought. God has become a strategy which enables us to function more efficiently and morally. Voltaire concludes that, "If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent Him."12    PASCAL’S WAGER  What have you to lose if you believe that God exists? If he is to wager, Blaise Pascal, author of Pensees, argues that it is worthwhile to take the risk of belief.   Pascal’s pragmatic argument is not an appeal to the truth of the existence of God but to the self-interest that is best served by believing in God. Begging the theological assumption that believers go to heaven and unbelievers go to hell, Pascal argues that believers have more payoffs than unbelievers. In crude terms, the pragmatic thing to do is to bet on God because this bet has the singular return of salvation and not damnation.13  Like Pascal before him, William James, author of Will to Believe, is unimpressed by the empty rhetoric of all the attempts to prove the existence of God. From the point of view of practical religion, James argues that any belief is morally justified even if it is on insufficient evidence if having it has practical consequences. This is the basis of James’ pragmatic definition of truth. By willing it to be true, the man of faith makes it true to him. An idea is true so long as to believe it is profitable to our lives.14 The true is only expedient in the way of our thinking. Faith beforehand in an uncertified result is the only thing that makes the result come true. A belief can verify itself. By the same token, it follows that religious belief may be deemed a true belief. Thus, a person has a right to believe according to his passions on issues that cannot, by its nature, be decided on intellectual grounds.   Daniel Kolak, author of In Search of God, argues that If there is a God, the conviction is not warranted. It is not even a justified belief. Thus far all we have, at best, is belief by emotional persuasion, without evidence. All we have is make-believe.15   NIETZSCHE’S SUPERMAN  	God is dead. In the early nineteenth century, Ludwig Feuerbach, Karl Marx, Charles Darwin, Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud announced the death of God.16 The enlightenment, age of reason, seemed to have triumphed over centuries of superstition and bigotry that the idea of God appears inadequate. By the end of the century, a significant number of people were beginning to feel that if God is not yet dead, it is the duty of rational emancipated beings to kill him.17  	Nietzsche argues that the death of God will bring about a newer and higher phase of human history. It is an affirmative view that exhorts human beings to be gods themselves. In his book Thus Spake Zarathustra, Nietzsche insists that the death of God is the birth of Superman, the new enlightened man who would trample upon the feeble Christian virtues of love and pity.18 Compassion had made us weak. The vengeful Christian God, who threatened mankind of eternal damnation, had encouraged people to fear their bodies and their sexuality. The Church’s record of intolerance burdened the faithful with doctrines that are contradictory and pernicious to mankind.  	The death of God is not a gloomy view. In fact, it is good news. Thomas Altizer, author of The Gospel of Christian Atheism, claims that God’s death has freed us from slavery to a tyrannical transcendent deity. In this manner, the absence of God is a positive liberation. In Existentialism as a Humanism, Jean Paul Sartre argues that even if God existed, it was still necessary to reject him, since the idea of God negates our freedom.19 Traditional religion tells us that we must conform to God’s idea of humanity to make us fully human. Instead, we must see human beings as the creator of their own essence.   CONCLUSION  	The idea of God, which has as many conceptions as there are religions in the world, could be merely a convenience which could be misused. It could fill the gaps of our limited knowledge regarding the ultimate questions. It could also be a source of unnecessary mystification and perpetual immaturity.  	If there is a God, he is not an object of thought. There is no way that we could understand this out by reason as if God were any other objective fact. He is not a scientific fact who can be discovered by any human being. Thus, it is inappropriate to insist to argue the existence of God on entirely rational grounds.  Of course, there can be morality even without God. Historically, arguments that appeal to authority in matters of morality have been the root cause of domination and oppression. There is an objective way of adjudicating conflicting claims of moral value. In Kantian terms, it is the appeal to duty, or the principle of humanity. That is, the duty to treat every human being, including oneself,   in every case, as an end in himself and never merely as a means to an end.  For our own pragmatic purposes, more dramatic than ever, we need the idea of God to promote the ideal of compassion which should challenge our prejudices. Compassion is a difficult virtue because it is inclusive. It demands that we go beyond our egotism, insecurity and inherited prejudice. The idea of God still has a significant religious value. That is, to fill many people with hope and compassion rather than with fear and prejudice.

						   Diego A. Odchimar, III   ABSTRACT: The meaning of life is the most urgent of questions. But there are those who think that any answer to the question of the meaning of life is begging the question. According to them, the question “What is the meaning of life?” is ambiguous, at least, a meaningless one. In fact, it is a non-question, a pseudo-problem, because it makes an assumption that life has any meaning, in any objective or subjective sense. It is my view that death makes the question of the meaning of life the fundamental question of philosophy.  KEY WORDS: death, suicide, absurd, meaning of life, immortality, finitude, existentialism, Buddha, Solomon, Dalai Lama, Aquinas, Tolstoy, Schopenhauer, Camus, Sartre, Popper, Frankl, Nielsen, Nagel    DEATH makes life meaningful. The Dalai Lama preaches, “In reflecting on death and impermanence, you will begin to give meaning to your life.”1   Viktor Frankl once wrote: “Man’s concern about a meaning of life is the truest expression of the state of being human.” However, there is a doctrine of despair that accompanies the question “Is human life ever worthwhile?” It is the fact that each individual human life ends in death that men suspect every affirmative answer to the question of the meaning of life. If all our striving is without final consequence, then life is meaningless and it scarcely matters how we live if all will end in the dust of death. Pessimists, like Arthur Schopenhauer, argue that everything in life, earthly happiness, is destined to be frustrated or recognized as an illusion because man will eventually die.  SUICIDE  	In his work Myth of Sisyphus, Albert Camus concludes that, “There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy. All the rest -- whether the world has three dimensions, whether the mind has nine or twelve categories – come afterward.”2   	Human life must be some kind of a mistake.        Camus observed that many people die because they judge that life is not worth living. Others paradoxically get killed for the ideas or illusions that give them a reason for living. Boredom is the direct proof of the vanity of human existence. Arthur Schopenhauer, author of The Word as Will and Idea, argues that “man is a compound of needs which are hard to satisfy; that their satisfaction achieves nothing but a painless condition in which he is only given over to boredom . . . boredom is nothing other than the sensation of the emptiness of existence.” Schopenhauer is the gloomiest of pessimist. He wrote that the world ought not to exist: “We have not to rejoice but rather to mourn at the existence of the world; that its non-existence would be preferable to its existence. . . It is absurd to speak of life as a gift, as so many philosophers and thoughtless people have done. It is evident that everyone would have declined such a gift if he could have seen it and tested it beforehand. . . all man’s wishing is a perversity and that nothing at all is worth our striving, our efforts and struggles. . . All the good things are vanity, the world in all its ends bankrupt, and life a business which does not cover its expenses.”3          Paul Edwards comments that Schopenhauer’s arguments could be dismissed as “the fantasies of a lonely and embittered man who was filled with contempt for mankind and who was singularly incapable of either love or friendship.” To conclude that death is better than life is plainly subject to personal preference.   ABSURD  How can life have any meaning or worth or value if it must come to an end? What is it for if it leads to nothing?  Human existence resembles the fate of Sisyphus, a perfect image of meaninglessness. In the ancient myth, Sisyphus, it will be remembered, betrayed divine secrets to mortals, and for this he was condemned by the gods to roll a stone to the top of a hill, the stone then immediately roll back down, again to be pushed to the top by Sisyphus, to roll down once more, and so on again and again, forever. Obviously, this is a picture of meaningless, pointless toil, where nothing comes out of it all.   Richard Taylor, author of Good and Evil, explains that like Sisyphus, “men do achieve things -- they scale their towers and raise their stones to their hilltops – but every  such accomplishment fades, providing only an occasion for renewed labors of the same kind.”4 King Solomon, son of David, profoundly felt such meaningless existence that he elaborated his frustrations in the book of Ecclesiastes. Solomon was so dejected at the obvious meaninglessness of life that he confessed, “Everything is meaningless. . . Everything is chasing after the wind. The more you know, the more worries you have. The more you know, the more it hurts.”5 In his essay My Confession, Leo Tolstoy told of the same predicament. He was persistently bothered by the questions: “Why? Well, and then?” Everything seemed meaningless and useless. Tolstoy confessed that, “when I thought of the education of my children, I said to myself: ‘Why?’. . .‘What is it to me?’ Or, thinking of fame which works my would get me, I said to myself: ‘All right, you will be more famous than Gogol, Pushkin, Shakespeare, Moliere, and all the writers in the world, -- what of it?”6 In the end, both King Solomon, son of David, and Leo Tolstoy adapted the Christian view that there are two conditions necessary for a meaningful, valuable and purposeful life for man: God and immortality.  William Lane Craig, author of Reasonable Faith: Christian Truth and Apologies, writes about the absurdity of life without a god and immortality. That is, if there is no God, if man dies and be no more, sooner or later, then man’s life becomes absurd.7 Craig is saddened by the thought that it makes no difference whether or not a person ever existed because he will eventually cease to exist and there is no God to give it meaning.   The problem becomes even worse because if life ends at the grave, then it makes no difference whether one has lived as a sinner or as a saint. One may as well live as one pleases. No one holds anybody accountable. But more than that, even if life does not end in death, if there is no God, there can be no objective standards of right and wrong. The question “Why should I be moral?” would then be absurd because these values could not exist without God. As Fyodor Dostoyevsky, in his last novel The Brothers Karamazov, puts it: “If there is no god (and immortality), then all things are permitted.”8  	There are several ways to approach the absurdity of life. According to the Christian worldview, God does exist, and man’s life does not end at the grave. In the resurrection of the body, man may enjoy eternal life and fellowship with God. This is what David Swenson, author of Kierkegaardian Philosophy in the Faith of a Scholar, calls the transforming power of otherworldliness.9 It reinforces the hope of common men that when the storms of life overwhelm them, their problems become light and momentary afflictions because of the promise of external happiness in the life to come.   	But as the natural sciences developed, when more and more things in the universe came to be explained without the assumption of a supernatural creator, such appeals to god and immortality to answer the question of the meaning of life become disheartening and implausible. The atheist solution would be to face the absurdity of life and live bravely. Albert Camus, author of Myth of Sisyphus, argues that “life is all the better because it has no meaning.”10  Obviously, the point of any living thing’s life is nothing but life itself. The meaning of life is from within us, it is not bestowed from without, and it far exceeds in both its beauty and permanence any heaven of which men have ever dreamed or yearned for.  	The picture of Sisyphus is precisely the picture of boredom. We toil after goals, all of them of transitory significance, after gaining one of them we immediately set forth for other goals with the next one being essentially the same. All our achievements, even though they are so beautiful, do not last. Like the sand pyramids, soon they will become mere curiosities while around them the rest of mankind continues its perpetual toting of rocks, only to see them roll down. But this is not something to be depressed about. By analogy, Taylor argues that it was the will to build of the builders of great and flourishing ancient civilizations, not what was finally built, that gave meaning to their lives. We may find trivial what they had once accomplished – the fragments of pots and vase, broken statues, and such tokens of another age – the meaning of their lives was in the day and moment that they lived.11 It does not really matter whether or not the castles I build today will wither away tomorrow. Building castles matters because it is there to be done and I have the will to do it.   The point of living is simply to be living because we are alive. The question “What for?” or “Why should I live?” is simply irrelevant. I agree with Kurt Baier that the question “What is the meaning of life?” actually proves that life has no meaning. What matters is not that life should have a guaranteed meaning, but that a person should make the most of his life. Thus, I propose that the question be reformulated into “How should I live my life?”12   IMMORTALITY  Whether it comes sooner or later, the prospect of death is a terrible horror because it brings to an end all the goods that life contains. If death is an evil, it is the loss of life that is objectionable.  Thomas Nagel, author of Mortal Questions, comments that “If death is the unequivocal and permanent end of our existence, the question arises whether it is a bad thing to die. . . If death is an evil at all, it cannot be because of its positive features, but only because of what it deprives us of.”13 Perhaps this is a good reason why belief in some form of an after life is found in every community known to us, from the evidence of ceremonial burial places that dates back to remote pre-historic times. John Beloff, in his essay “Is There Anything Beyond Death?” A Parapsychologist’s Summation,” argues that “we are the only species that understands that we are doomed to die and the idea of life beyond the grave is our way of compensating for the menace of our mortality.”14   While I remain open to the persuasion that there is life after death,	I do not feel threatened by the prospect of death. In fact, death makes us feel the urgency to make our lives meaningful. Sir Karl Popper “There are those who think that life is valueless because it comes to an end. They fail to see that the opposite argument might also be proposed: that if there were no end to life, life would have no value; that it is, in part, the ever-present danger of losing it which helps to bring home to use the value of life.”15 Voltaire writes, in a short poem addressed to Mme. Du Chatelet, “Death is nothing at all. The idea alone is sad. To cease to love and be lovable is a death unbearable. To cease to live is nothing.”16   EXISTENTIALISM  	Merleau Ponty, an existentialist, has remarked: “Life makes no sense, but it is ours to make sense of.” Jean Paul Sartre, author of Existentialism Is a Humanism, expressed the same idea: “To say that we invent values means nothing except this: life has no meaning a priori. Before you live it, life is nothing, but it is for you to give it a meaning. Value is nothing other than this meaning which you choose.”17  	Existentialism is a movement that rejects the proposition that life is meaningful only if there is a God. In short, it is man’s recognition that he stood alone in an irrational world without God. Existentialists believe that rather than accept this fate with resignation, we will live life – in our own way.   	The appeal to religious meaning to life has its own problems. Nagel argues that the idea that our lives fulfill God’s purpose is suspect. What is the point of God? If God is supposed to give our lives a meaning that we can’t understand, it’s not much of a consolation. Nagel proposes that if ever you’ll be asked the question, “But what’s the point of being alive at all?” answer it by saying, “There is no point. It wouldn’t matter if I didn’t exist at all, or if I didn’t care about anything. But I do. That’s all there is to it.”18 Nagel concludes that part of the problem is that some of us have an incurable tendency to take ourselves seriously. We can approach our absurd lives with irony instead of heroism and despair.   	Bertrand Russell said, “I believe that when I die I shall rot, and nothing of my ego will survive . . . I should scorn to shiver with terror at the thought of annihilation. Happiness is nonetheless happiness because it must come to an end, nor do thought and love lose their value because they are not everlasting.”19   CONCLUSION  Death is not a menace. Our own mortality reminds us that we do not have forever. Thus, death makes us feel the urgency to live a full life.  Human life can have meaning quite independently of whether there is a God or whether we shall live forever. Meaning is a personal preference. Value is nothing other than the meaning which you choose.  Suicide is cowardly and escapist. It is based on an embittered value judgment of life. Life is absurd only if we become spectators of our own life. That is, if we evaluate life from the detached viewpoint of some objective reality from which human life seems arbitrary and trivial.   Like Sisyphus, let us continue to live in spite of it. Life is meaningful from our own subjective viewpoint because it is when we are on our subjective best that we live the life that we choose to value.

						   Diego A. Odchimar, III   ABSTRACT: Justice is about political ideals on how to accommodate differences. In many ways, it is remarkably complicated because of the alleged conflict between the demands of equality and the concern that people should have liberty. I shall argue in this essay that the ideal of equality and liberty can be reconciled into the welfare liberal ideal of fairness. This compromise view accounts a justification for coercive institutions and obligations.  KEY WORDS: basic heterogeneity, coercive institutions, rights, duty, equality, liberty, fairness, community, socialism, libertarianism, liberalism, communitarianism, Marx, Hospers, Rawls, Walzer, Sandel   	HUMAN BEINGS are basically heterogeneous. We are thoroughly diverse that we differ from each other not only in external characteristics and circumstances (e.g. in inherited fortunes, in the natural and social environment in which we live). We begin life with different endowments if inherited wealth and liabilities. We live in different environments – some more hostile than others. The societies and the communities to which we belong offer very different opportunities as to what we can or cannot do. The epidemiological factors in the region in which we live can profoundly affect our health and well-being. We also differ in our personal characteristics (e.g. age, sex, proneness to illness, physical and mental abilities).1   	Amartya Sen, author of Inequality Reexamined, argues regarding the evaluation of the demands of substantive equality and effective freedom should seriously take into account the fact of human diversity.   BASIC HETEROGENEITY  	Why should others refrain me from doing what I wish? Isaiah Berlin, author of Four Essays on Liberty, argues that the lack of harmony in men’s prospects implies that sometimes liberty should be coerced, and legitimately so.2  	This is the issue of plurality. Despite their basal heterogeneity, mutual respect and community comes naturally to human beings. But from time to time, it degenerates into domination and oppression when individuals throw off the value of community for the pursuit of their own narrow self-interests.  	Iris Marion Young, author of Justice and the Politics of Difference, argues that domination and oppression happens against women, children and youth, persons with disabilities, the mentally challenged, older persons, indigenous peoples, the urban and rural poor, farmers, fisher folks, workers – local and overseas, public or private, whether formally employed or not, displaced families and communities and other valuable sectors because rights and duties are defined according to the ends of privileged groups that discriminate and prejudice them.3  	Self-interest could easily transform community into conflict and turn individuals into factious and fanatical slaves of their intolerant passions. If no one will stop them, if they could not find a way to calm themselves, then there is nothing less than the chains of despotism can restrain them from killing one another. This is the perverse, sometimes inhuman, fact of political life.      It has been the project of philosophers to find reasonable principles of justice to guide politics. Steven Kautz, author of Liberalism and Community, argues that “political life depends upon shared opinions about justice. In the absence of such agreement, human beings will quarrel, sometime violently about first principles.”4   AUTHORITY  	James Sterba, author of Contemporary Social and Political Philosophy, argues that “the central task of social and political philosophy is to provide a justification for coercive institutions.”5 These institutions are those which essentially, at least sometimes, employ force or threat of force to control the behavior of their members to achieve either minimal or wide ranging goals. Sterba claims that to justify such coercive institutions, we need to show that authorities within these institutions have a right to be obeyed and their members have a corresponding duty to obey them. In other words, we need to show that these institutions have legitimate authority over their members.  Ironically, while an individual, as far as possible, seeks above all to free himself from every sort of authority, in order for him to be free from the dominion of others, he must submit himself in some measure to an authority. As John Locke, author of Two Treatises of Government, argues that “where there is no law, there is no freedom.”6  	Socialists, libertarians, liberals and communitarians defend the legitimate authority of coercive institutions as a means to best promote their social and political ideals.7 For example, welfare liberals, like John Rawls contend that the ultimate moral reason for acknowledging someone as a legitimate authority is justified in terms of fairness while libertarians, like John Jospers, contend that it is justified in terms of liberty. By contrast, socialists, like Karl Marx, contend that the ultimate justification for submitting to someone as a legitimate authority is provided by equality while communitarians, like Michael Sandel and Michael Walzer, contend that it is provided by the common good. In fact, it is when these coercive institutions fail to realize these ideals that they lose their legitimate authority.   EQUALITY  	“From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs,” as expressed by Karl Marx in his Critique of the Gotha Program, sums up the socialist political ideal of equality in terms of need-fulfillment.8  	Obviously, this is the urgent response of socialists to the widespread exploitation of workers by capitalists who extract unfair advantages from them for the pursuit of profit. In fact, capitalists threaten their workers to replace them with other workers if they disrupt the good return on their investment. Socialists claim that such exploitation is carried out because of the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few.  By appealing to the moral incentive to provide for the basic needs of all its members by redistributing wealth and power, socialists hope to be able to motivate people to do their best contribution to society.	As Marx pointed out, this can be done by restricting ownership of capital and other means of production. In other words, by socializing the means of production that would lead to the abolition of capitalism.  	Socialists propose a strong government that would guarantee that workers have significant control over the features of their working conditions as job descriptions; working hours; and, hiring, firing, and promotion policies. Such control extends not only to firms and factories.     In order to achieve substantial equality, it is legitimate for a socialist government to interfere with the positive freedom of individuals to do what one wants with his income. Thus, in a socialist community, a member loses his negative freedom not to be interfered with.   	At the very least, the redistribution of wealth and power necessary to achieve a guaranteed social minimum justifies the socialist coercive institutions as legitimate authorities. But this end has been highly criticized because of the failure of socialist constructions,     which is largely attributed to abuse of authority.   LIBERTY  	Liberty is a universally accepted ideal. But it is differently understood. Libertarians, like Henry Spencer and John Locke, take liberty as the core requirement of justice. Some libertarians, following Herbert Spencer, have   (1) taken the right to liberty as basic; and, (2) derived all other rights from this right to liberty. Other libertarians, following John Locke, have (1) taken a set of rights, including typically the right to life and the right to property, as basic and (2) defined liberty as the absence of constraints in the exercise of these rights.9  	Libertarians reject any coercively supported social minimum as a violation of liberty. They argue that liberty always has priority over other social and political ideals. James Sterba explains that for libertarians, “the right to life is not a right to receive from others the goods and resources necessary for preserving one’s life. It is not a right to a social minimum. It is simply a right not to be killed unjustly. Correspondingly, the libertarian’s right to property is not a right to secure a social minimum. Rather, it is a right to acquire goods and resources either by initial acquisitions or by voluntary agreements.”10      In conflict situations between the rich and the poor, the poor might argue that they have the freedom to not to be interfered with in taking from the surplus possessions of the rich what is necessary to satisfy their basic needs.11 Libertarians argue that there is no duty to provide for such needs. A duty, such as the provision of welfare to the needy, interferes with the freedom of the rich in using their resources to satisfy their luxury needs if they so wish. For this reason, libertarians are opposed to any coercively supported social minimum. Re-distributive schemes, such as the provision of welfare to the needy, are requirements of charity rather than justice.    FAIRNESS  	Justice draws the limit of the good. Liberals argue that justice, as fairness, is about the priority of right over the good. It means that the principles of justice impose limits on permissible ways of life.12  Libertarians and liberals believe that human beings possess rights by nature. But they have conflicting rights claims. While libertarians speak of right to property, liberals appeal to economic welfare rights. Libertarians condemn affirmative action as an infringement of individual rights, while the liberals praise affirmative action for vindicating the collective rights of disadvantaged minority groups.  Justice as fairness, as a compromised view, is an idea of a mixed regime. The liberal community enables its members to lead a reasonable way of life, one that allows them the freedom to pursue their self-interests and requires them at the same time to respect the equal freedom of others. Liberalism opposes authoritarianism because it is basically a doctrine of consent. Liberals have defended their ideal in basically two ways. Some liberals, following Immanuel Kant, propose that human beings have all the freedoms possible to frame, revise and pursue their own conception of the good, without imposing a preferred way of life, consistent with the equal freedom of others as persons, not things. Other liberals, following John Stuart Mill, value freedom as a means to maximize utility or aggregate happiness.13 Contemporary liberals, like Joseph Raz, author of The Morality of Freedom, argues that while a liberal government is not entitled to approve or suppress a style of life, it should help them live the life that they value by making available a range of valuable options.14   COMMUNITY  	According to Stephen Holmes, “communitarians are above all ‘anti-liberals’ who seek to establish a politics of the common good and thereby to tame the prevailing liberal politics of rights.”15  Michael Sandel, author of Liberalism and Its Critics, argues that persons are constituted by their obligations to communities.16 Thus, the principles of right and so of justice is limited by the communities’ conception of the good. Furthermore, there is a diversity of views regarding the nature of community that the conception of community is notoriously vague and indefinite. Michael Walzer, author of Spheres of Justice, argues that different communities have different understandings of social goods, which requires different procedures of distribution. Walzer claims that social goods such as welfare, security, money, education, political power, welfare, and honor should be distributed according to the community tradition or shared understanding of people’s needs, which vary over time and between communities.17 Thus, any social ideal could stand against criticism by appealing to the authority of tradition.   The politics of community, in any case, has not offered a principled way to end the disagreements regarding justice. The fact of irreducible pluralism of cultures implies that there are no judges between them, but the members of the community themselves. This is problematic because it invites local prejudices. Steven Kautz, author of Liberalism and Community, argues that a definitive way to settle the disagreements on justice is to recognize the fact that although communities have different ways of life, they are constituted by the participation of right-bearing persons.18    CONCLUSION  Theories of justice maybe classified into three models: goal-based theory of justice; right-based theory of justice; and, duty-based theory of justice.  	Socialism, whose fundamental social ideal is equality, is a goal-based theory of justice. Communitarianism is also goal-based because they teach us that identification with one’s own community is the foundation of any truly moral way of life.   	Libertarianism is a right-based theory of justice because liberty, being its fundamental social ideal, is the basis of all other rights. Liberty should not be constrained by positive acts (that is, acts of commission).  	As a compromise view of justice as fairness, liberalism is a duty-based theory of justice because it favors socialization of the means of production along with the expansion of social services in order for liberty not to be constrained by negative acts (that is, acts of omission) that prevent people from doing what they are otherwise able to do.  	The traditional exclusive conception of community, as common identity, gives rise to blind patriotism, or to ethnocentrism, an intolerance of strangers at home and away from home. It deprives one of the freedom to re-evaluate the values, existing institutions and prevailing practices of his own community and whether or not to endorse or repudiate its authoritative prejudices.  	Justice demands an inclusive conception of community, as common humanity, which is a product of reasonable choices of free and equal individuals. It is a community that accommodates the fact of reasonable pluralism as the inevitable outcome of free institutions where individual members remain profoundly divided by reasonable religious, political, and moral doctrines.

						   Diego A. Odchimar, III   ABSTRACT: A human being is a person, not merely a thing, because he is conscious that he is the origin of the will. That is, that he is an end in himself because he can set an end for itself. Thus, to be human is to be free from becoming a mere thing, or a means to an end. But there are wrong uses of freedom, like when a human being treats other human beings, including oneself, in some cases, merely as means to an end. I propose that being human presupposes a sense of community, or common humanity.  KEY WORDS: end in himself, being for others, positive freedom, negative freedom, common good, common humanity, war, social contract, community, Aristotle, Hobbes, Rousseau, Mill, Kant, Sartre, Arendt    EXISTENTIALISM maintains that in man, and in man alone, existence preceded essence. Jean Paul Sartre, author of Being and Nothingness, explains that man first is, and only subsequently is this or that. In a word, man must create his own essence. It is in throwing himself into the world, suffering there, struggling there, that he gradually defines himself. Man’s definition always remains open ended like an unfinished project until his own death. We cannot say what this man is before he dies, or what mankind is before it has disappeared. Man, as a rational being, was forced to define who he was through living, while a thing is what it is until destroyed. Sartre argues that with our ability to think, grow, and change, mankind is in the unique position of defining itself. We are each in charge of defining our own lives.1  WAR  	Freedom implies conflict. This is so because every human being has the capacity to decide for himself. In a given situation, his capacity to decide what is good, desirable or reasonable comes into fundamental conflict with another person’s identical capacity.   	Thomas Hobbes, the author of Leviathan, argues that “if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies; and in the way to their end, which is principally their own conservation, and sometimes their delectation only, endeavor to destroy, or subdue one another.”2 Thus, for Hobbes, man is in a condition of war with all men because by nature he has the freedom to use his own power, as he will himself, for the preservation of his own nature. Consequently, Hobbes believe that it is the law of nature that “every man, ought to endeavor peace, as far as he has hope of obtaining it; and when he cannot obtain it, that he may seek, and use, all helps, and advantages of war. The first branch of which rule contains the first, and fundamental law of nature; which is, to seek peace, and follow it. The second, the sum of the right of nature; which is, by all means we can, to defend ourselves.”3  	Hobbes argues that if man has right to everything because he is free, then no action can be unjust. This is the reason why Hobbes called the state of nature as the state of war. The right of men to all things in nature puts men in the condition of war.4	If man does not give up his right to everything in nature and enter a contract with other men to form a community, then every man is enemy to every man. In such a condition, man live without security. There is no place for industry, culture, no arts, no letters, no society. Consequent to a time of war, man is in “continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.5   POSITIVE FREEDOM  	There is a common tendency among human beings to define freedom as a capacity to attain a private good. In other words, according to Sir Robert Filmer, “a liberty for everyone to do what he lists, to live as he pleases, and not to be tied by any laws.” This is positive freedom.6  	This might not be a problem until someone does something that we think is wrong. Worse, that person might think that what he is doing is not wrong and he does not care about other people. Thomas Nagel, author of        What Does It All Mean?, illustrates the problem,          “if someone just does not care about other people, what reason does he have to refrain from doing any of the things usually thought to be wrong, if he can get away with it: what reason does he have not to kill, steal, lie, or hurt others? If he can get what he wants by doing such things, why shouldn’t he? And if there’s no reason why he shouldn’t, in what sense is it wrong?”7 	This puts man in a war of all against all. Hobbes proposes that men could escape from this bleak human condition by agreeing to transfer their positive freedom to a single sovereign power of Leviathan (absolute authority). Obviously, Hobbes’ argument is a justification of the existence of authoritarian regimes and the legitimacy of their control over the positive freedom of its subjects. The trade-off in losing one’s positive freedom by conferring it to the Leviathan is peace at home, and mutual aid against their enemies abroad. The Leviathan “defends them from the invasion of foreigners, and the injuries of one another, and thereby to secure them from in such sort, as that by their own industry, and by the fruits of the earth, they may nourish themselves and live contentedly.”8 This appears to be an important and compelling argument. But the absolute power of the Leviathan could ensue absolute corruption. Giving up positive freedom to an absolute authority could leave them worse off than they would have been in the state of nature.   NEGATIVE FREEDOM  	The negative sense of freedom is non-interference.   It is the freedom from being determined by others, not to be under their will. That the freedom of men may be restrained from invading other’s capacity to set ends for themselves.   	This sense of freedom is viewed from a more general point of view, which every thinking person can understand. Every person has a reason to consider not merely his own private good, but the good of others as well in deciding what to do.9 This view of freedom is public. It allows time to appeal to a common judge, or the decision of the law, for remedy in cases when a person’s conception of the good, desirable or reasonable comes into fundamental conflict with another person’s identical capacity.   Thus, negative freedom is what John Locke, author of Two Treatises of Government, defines as a liberty common to everyone in a given community and made by the legislative power erected in it. That is, “a liberty to follow my own will in all things, where the rule prescribes not; and not to be subject to the inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man.”10  	Jean Jacques Rousseau, author of The Social Contract, proposes that to solve the problem of adjudicating conflicts and arbitrary relations brought about by man’s natural right to freedom of action, it is necessary that human beings transform themselves from a group of isolated individuals with many different wills into a community with common will or interest.11 Unlike Hobbes, for Rousseau, there was to be no trade-off. He believes that human beings could have both liberty and law if they were able to construct a community where they ruled themselves.   COMMON GOOD  	Aristotle, author of The Politics, argues that man is a political animal.12 Human beings do not fully realize their ends until they have become members of a community.  	Men, by nature, can indeed do as they want. They can pursue their private good. But what they want is necessarily very different from what it would be were they are members of a community. They have to recognize the public good that incorporates the private goods of other members.  Thus, the interests of members of a community will be quite different from those of men who are not part of a community. No doubt, private and public good will diverge at some points. But the over-riding good of a member of a community will be for the community to be maintained. Aristotle argues that without the community, man will not have the freedom to pursue the good life. Therefore, in order for man to achieve his private good, man must belong in a community and recognize the public good. In Aristotle’s ideal community, the public good is the common good to pursue the good life.  	Of course, whether he likes it or not, man is already born in a community. Unfortunately, not all communities have the same conception of the common good. Often, some human beings use their community as a means to pursue their private good and manipulate the laws so they could do as they list and live as they please. Thus, even in a community, man is in a condition of war. Still, in several communities, man does not have the liberty to follow his own will, and he is subject to the inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of other men because the prevailing laws prescribe that he be subservient to them. This is domination and oppression. It is rampant in communities where the common good is defined by the will of some of its members who want to reclaim their positive freedom to pursue their own private good. Consequently, most members of these communities are marginalized (e.g., women, children, poor, old, homosexuals, etc.). They do not have the freedom to participate in most decision-making procedures, organize groups and live the life that they value.   COMMON HUMANITY  	Rousseau’s problem is “how to find a form of association which will defend the person and the goods of each member with the collective force of all and under which each individual, while uniting himself with the others, obeys no one but himself and remains as free as before.”13 Rousseau’s ideal community is a communion of man with the rest of humanity. That is, a community, not as a means for the pursuit of the good life as a common good, but a community, as common humanity where man can be human.  	“Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains.”14 These are Rousseau‘s famous words aimed at critiquing the traditional conceptions of community. He argues that a community should ensure freedom rather than destroy it.   He proposes that, whereas individual men are physically unequal in there nature, each of them becomes equal to all others when they enter into a community under the law.   	Inequality is natural. In the state of nature, it is might that defines right. Right to anything is ensured merely by personal strength. Since men, by nature, are not physically equal, they are not really free because they do not have security over the things that they possess. As it were, Hobbes’ Leviathan does not solve this problem because the laws that emanate from an absolute authority, most often than not, only legitimizes the private good of some men. Such a community is problematic because its sovereign power is merely the apparatus of some men to dominate and oppress others.  	Influenced by Rousseau, Immanuel Kant argues that there should be equality before the law. Law should not be the will of any person, but should be something that everyone can assent to. The law should be universal in this sense. This could be possible if, and only if, we construct our laws from a more general point of view.15   ETERNAL PEACE 	 	Immanuel Kant’s dream is to achieve a just political order of eternal peace.16 This political ideal is cosmopolitan in that it requires extending the ideals of politics to the international. That is, that the best possibility for this ideal is a peaceful confederation of republics.  	Kant proposes that laws should be universal principles that allow the greatest possible human freedom. Laws should ensure that the freedom of each could co-exist with the freedom of all others. Thus, all laws must be ones that members of a community, understood as common humanity, would agree to, and all laws must be made public.         In practical terms, laws are universal principles only if, and only if, it commands us to treat every human being, including ourselves, in every case, as ends in ourselves, who can set ends for ourselves. This is the basis of the Kantian duty.   	Laws are coercive. But this does not contradict freedom for as long as laws are hindrances to hindrances of freedom. It follows that laws could be justified only in terms of how they protect the freedom of all human beings. Laws that are against humanity are hindrances to the attainment of eternal peace. For example, the anti-Semitic laws that Hitler and his Nazi regime imposed on its occupied territories during World War II. In order to attain eternal peace, man should not be merely following orders made by others for them to follow. Hannah Arendt, author of Eichmann in Jerusalem, proposes that, man should always exercise his capacity of thinking, of having internal dialogue with himself, which will permit self-awareness of the nature of one’s deeds from the experiential standpoint of his victims.17    CONCLUSION  	Positive freedom to do as what one lists, to live as one pleases, should be understood within the context of the negative freedom of others not to be interfered with.     As one is free to pursue one’s own private good, others have the identical freedom from being hindered from living the life that they value.  	What really separates man from other animals is his capacity for humanity. That is, the capacity to treat every human being, including oneself, in every case, as an end in himself and never merely as a means to an end. While man, as a rational animal, is an end in himself because he has the capacity to set and end for himself, man is a political animal as well. He is not merely a being for itself, he is also a being for others.  Man can co-exist with other men in a condition of peace. He has the capacity to view his own conception of the good from a more general point of view, which every thinking person can understand, to consider not merely his own private good, but the good of others as well in deciding what to do. This way, he can live in a community with other men, not merely to pursue the good life as a common good, but to be human in a community understood as common humanity.  	It is unthinking that causes man to degenerate into a beast. If only every man has a habit of thinking from a more general point of view, we can transcend the condition of war and achieve the dream of eternal peace. If this can be done, even in darkest times, human freedom is possible.

						   Diego A. Odchimar, III   ABSTRACT: Rights are claims. But not all claims are rights.   Only legitimate claims are rights. There is an obvious problem in adjudicating which claims are legitimate. This is so because it is a common philosophical tendency to define rights according to goals. Thus, as there are different goals, there are different rights. This is the root cause of conflicting claims to rights. To correct this problem, I propose that rights should be grounded on duty.  KEY WORDS: ancient ethical thought, modern ethical thought,   happiness, duty, teleology, deontology, communitarianism, liberalism, Kant, Aristotle, goal-based rights, duty-based rights    	ANCIENT ETHICAL THOUGHT is sharply opposed to modern ethical thought because the ancients took as their starting point the idea of the good, particularly the human good, which they identified with eudemonia, or happiness.  Aristotle, in particular, argues that, “all actions aim at some good.”1 As a representative of ancient ethics, Aristotle insists that all action be done for the sake of eudemonia. The ancients believe that the good of any being is determined by its natural end (telos) or function and regard the capacities whose exercise enables a being to perform its function well as its characteristic excellences or virtues.2 Thus, a being is virtuous if he is able to perform the appropriate actions demanded by his pursuit of his natural ends. In other words, right action is determined by the virtuous agent’s perception of what is required by particular circumstances. In sum, the ancients are teleological (end-oriented) and particularist.   On the other hand, the moderns tend to be deontological (duty-bound) and universalist.              As a representative of the moderns, Immanuel Kant criticizes the ancients on the ground that they commit the general error of regarding eudemonia, or happiness, as the basis of morality. Morality should not be subordinate to one’s own happiness because feelings of pleasure and displeasure are indefinite. If morality is to be determined by one’s own happiness, then morality is heteronomous.3 To solve this problem, morality should be grounded on duties.  The moderns sought for duties based on universal laws that bind all agents absolutely, without regard to their private interests. The moderns inherited a moral code from medieval Christianity, which consisted roughly in a system of rules or commands grounded in divine law. But as a result of the religious disputes of the Reformation and the rise of modern science and secular society the content of this moral code could no longer be justified by appeal to revelation. Thus, the central project of modern ethics is to provide an alternative foundation.4   Kant, in particular, proposes that morality should be grounded on reason. An appeal to reason is universal because reason demands consistency and coherence.         If morality is to be determined by the duties that reason requires us to follow, then morality is homogenous.     This is so because, unlike those based on one’s own happiness, duties based on reason are public. We can know our duties by inquiring upon our reasons for acting. There are right and wrong reasons for acting. Kant suggests that we subject our reasons for acting to a test, “act only on a maxim through which you can at the same time will that it should be a universal law.” 5 In other words, our universal duty is “treat every human being, including oneself, in every case, as an end in himself and never merely as a means to an end.”6   HAPPINESS  	Kant insists that we can never determine whether an action is right or good by considering its bearing on happiness. In this sense, Kant’s ethics differs sharply from ancient ethics, and from the ethics of Aristotle in particular, in regard its attitude toward happiness.   	Aristotle’s ethics seems to involve an attractive feature that is not obviously present in Kant’s ethics. By identifying eudemonia, or happiness, as the end for the sake of which we all do what we do, Aristotle’s ethics gives unity to virtue in practical life and the natural end of man, which is his own happiness.7 Kant, on the other hand, seems to coerce us to swallow our often bitter duty than secure our own happiness. Kant seems to maintain that an action is not virtuous even if it is done to fulfill a duty if it is only by means of the prospect of happiness.  	Actions done for the prospect of happiness are conditional, or good because of something else.           If the virtue of actions lies in its instrumental value for securing happiness, then no actions have intrinsic value. Kant is especially concerned to reject this idea because to suppose that virtuous disposition is contingent upon its contribution to happiness would be to adopt a heteronomous conception of morality. Kant argues that not every end that we wish, or will, to pursue is good.  A will is not good merely because its fulfillment makes us happy.           Kant conceives of the good will as that which is consistent with our universal duty. In practical terms, grounding morality on duty rather than on happiness forces us to rethink our usual concept of freedom. We often formulate freedom in a positive sense (e.g. freedom to pursue our own happiness). People who conceive of freedom in this sense tend to treat other human beings merely as means to their ends. Whereas, if we conceive of freedom as something limited by our duty to treat every human being, including oneself, in every case, as an end in himself and never merely as a means to an end, then we think of freedom in a negative sense (e.g. freedom from being raped).   COMMUNITARIANISM  	In contemporary philosophy, the communitarians reject Kantian ethics and condemn it as an empty formalism. They argue that Kantian ethics is not a politically defensible basis for a theory of justice.  	Communitarians condemn the idea of abstract universal duty that we are used to find in Kant’s moral philosophy.      In particular, Michael Walzer, author of Spheres of Justice, holds a strong communitarian view that morality, in general, and justice, in particular, is a creation of a particular political community at a particular time according to the beliefs and understandings of ordinary people.  	Walzer’s position is that we must adopt the relativistic stand that morality and justice is internal to social meanings. The justification of rights, duties and obligations is determined by the local meaning of social goods. Walzer’s central argument is that “justice is relative to social meanings. . . There are an infinite number of possible lives, shaped by a n infinite number of possible cultures, religions, political arrangements, geographical conditions and so on. A given society is just if its substantive life is lived in a certain way – that is, in a way faithful to the shared understandings of the members.”8    GOAL-BASED RIGHTS  	It follows that communitarians are particularly against any idea of universal human rights. They argue that since justice is local, then the good is prior to the right. It is the concept of the good of an actual community that determines the rights of its citizens.   At issue is the United Nations’ universal declaration of human rights. Its universality is suspect because its claims are obviously institutionalized rights of the social order of the Western world.9   DUTY  In Kantian terms, justice is giving every one his due. What is due for a human being is that he be treated by every human being, including oneself, in every case,      as a human being.  A human being is such a being because he is free.    He is free because he is a rational being. That is, he has the capacity to set an end for himself. He is capable of deliberate action to secure a chosen end.10    For analytic clarity, freedom, in this sense, is negative. A human being is free, if, and only if, his will is free from being determined by his own desires and if his will is not hindered by the desires of others. Once his will is determined by his own desires, or hindered by the desires of others, a human being is not free anymore. When it happens, he is no longer an end in himself because he could no longer set an end for himself. He becomes a thing, or a mere means to an end.11   For example, rape is wrong because the victim’s freedom to pursue her own ends is hindered. The victim is treated merely as a means, or a thing, to fulfill the ends of the rapist. Consistent with the universal duty,      Kant argues that every human being has only one innate right. That is, the right to freedom of action.    Thus, we do not have the right to rape, murder, lie, cheat, among other positive freedoms that we wish, or will, we might rightfully claim against other human beings.   This is so because other human beings, like us, have the right not to be raped, murdered, lied upon, cheated on, etc. They have these rights, as we equally have them,     by virtue of our being human.   LIBERALISM  	In contemporary philosophy, some liberals support Kant’s ethics as a tenable foundation for a theory of justice.  	Liberals argue that every human being should have all the freedoms possible to frame, revise and pursue his own conception of the good consistent with the equal amount of freedoms possessed by other human beings. In sum,       what matters above all are not the ends that a person chooses but his capacity to choose them. This right to freedom of action is expressed in the negative form because it is based on the universal duty to treat every human being, including oneself, as an end in himself, or an autonomous being.12 A human being is an end in himself for as long as his freedom to frame, revise and pursue his own concept of the good is not hindered. In other words, one is free only to do what he wants to do for as long as he does not hinder another human being from his pursuit of his own concept of the good.   The right to freedom of action is a universal human right. Every human being possesses this right by virtue of his humanity. This right is innate, not ascribed. Thus, this human right is violated in cases when a human being hinders the freedom of another human being, or when his freedom is hindered by another human being.  	It should be noted that a human right is violated when a human being is treated merely as a means to an end. That is, when a human being is no longer treated as a person, but as a thing.   DUTY-BASED RIGHTS  A truly universal declaration of human rights is founded on the universal duty to treat every human being, including oneself, in every case, as an end in himself and never merely as a means to an end.  	Duty is obedience to a law. Such a law identifies the rights and duties of those who are bound by it. It states what is due to others from the duty-bearer, and what is due to the right-holder from others. For a duty to hold true to all rational beings, it should be based on a definite law that is an objective principle of morality, not merely from certain principles based on particular desires. Since a duty is a necessity of action, it should be based on a categorical imperative that is valid for all human wills.   	Eudemonia, or happiness, could only give us hypothetical imperatives because it can only produce subjective principles of morality. Thus, it could not be a ground for definite laws.   	Kant proposes that if there is to be an objective principle of morality, or a categorical imperative, that could command a universal duty to all human beings, it is the principle to treat every human being, including oneself, in every case, as an end in himself and never merely as a means to an end. This is necessarily the end of everyone because everyone is the origin of the will.14   This duty is universal because it presupposes the public use of reason. Reason does not dictate what may be done or believed. Rather, it proposes to us to be consistent in our actions by evaluating the reasons for acting on our desired ends. That is, by reflecting upon our own judgment from a universal standpoint or by shifting our ground to the standpoint of others. Onora O’Neill, author of Constructions of Reason, argues that “the task of the categorical imperative is not to dictate, but to constrain possibilities for acting and for cognition.”15   CONCLUSION  	Human beings are persons, not things. This is so because human beings are the origins of the will, they can set an end for themselves. Without them, nothing of absolute value could be found. Human beings have absolute value because they are the ones who confer value on the ends that they wish, or will, to secure. The ends that human beings set for themselves are conditional and contingent.   Kant argues that human beings have only one innate right. That is, the right to freedom of action. This right is grounded on the universal duty, the categorical imperative, to treat every human being, including oneself, in every case, as an end in himself and never merely as a means to an end. In other words, we have a universal duty not to hinder the freedom of another human being.  A law worthy to command us to act according to duty is a categorical imperative, not merely a hypothetical imperative. Else there is no law that could demand a duty. Such a law should be definite. Therefore, it must not be based on eudemonia, or happiness, which could only give us subjective principles. If there is to be an objective principle, or a categorical imperative, it is the principle to treat every human being, including oneself, in every case, as an end in himself.   	Rights are legitimate claims against other human beings. In Kantian terms, it is this universal duty that confers legitimacy on our claims against others. Only those claims against others that are consistent with this universal duty are legitimate. This right to freedom of action is derived from the universal duty not to hinder the freedom of another human being. In sum, only duty-based claims to rights are legitimate. Duty-based rights are those claims to freedom of action that are expressed in the negative form. The right to freedom of action is the right not to be hindered by others.

						   Diego A. Odchimar, III   ABSTRACT: Moral judgment is an ambiguous term. Roughly, it may refer to (1) the value of an outcome of an action; or it may mean (2) a standard for action. This ambiguity leads to ethical pluralism in the elucidation of moral concepts like “right,” “wrong,’ “good,” “evil” in particular situations.               An irreducible plurality of morally relevant considerations produces moral dilemmas. This can be remedied by correcting this common philosophical tendency. That is, by re-orienting morality as the evaluation of actions themselves, not the value of their outcomes. Thus, a moral dilemma is a pseudo-problem.       KEY WORDS: right action, good outcome, means, ends,          moral dilemma, happiness, rationality, utilitarianism, teleological approach, deontological approach, duty, right, freedom, Mill, Kant   	MORAL DILEMMA is a situation in which an agent S morally ought to do A and morally ought to do B but cannot do both, either because B is just not-doing-A or because some contingent feature of the world prevents doing both.1  	I shall argue in this essay that no moral dilemma is possible. A moral dilemma is a misunderstanding of the concern of ethics. Usually, ethics or moral philosophy is understood to imply the evaluation of two things: an end (outcome) and the means (action) to an end.  This is muddled thinking.   For purposes of analytic clarity, what we consider to be moral dilemmas are moral dilemmas only until we recognize that ethics is the evaluation of the means (actions) to ends, not the evaluation of ends (outcomes). In sum, ethics is about right actions, not good outcomes.   Moral dilemmas happen because we arbitrarily evaluate two actions to be both morally required because their outcomes are equally valuable. Obviously, this seems to reflect some kind of inconsistency in the principles of ethics from which we derive our evaluation. Moral dilemmas or supposed conflicts of values are actually products of principles of ethics based on ends (outcomes). These principles generate moral dilemmas because ends (e.g. happiness) are indefinite.  How does one know if an outcome is good? Is an outcome good if, and only if, it is of a right action? How does one know if an action is right? Is an action right if, and only if, it has good outcome?    GOOD OUTCOME  G. E. Moore, author of Principia Ethica, argues that what makes actions right is that they are productive of more good than could have been produced by any other action open to the agent.2 Moore bases the rightness of actions on the utility value of some sort of outcome. The value of actions is to be found in their consequences. The end justifies the means.  This is basically the principle of utilitarianism.   The emphasis is on the effects of a particular action on the total welfare. Thus, utilitarian morality may be classified as a consequentialist theory of morality.    John Stuart Mill, a utilitarian, argues that “all actions are for the sake of some end . . . pleasure, and freedom from pain, are the only things desirable as ends; and . . . all desirable things . . . are desirable either for the pleasure inherent in themselves, or as means to the promotion of pleasure and the prevention of pain.”3 Furthermore, Moore argues that  “duty . . . can only be defined as that action, which will cause more good to exist in the Universe than any other alternative.4   	This is the result-oriented (teleological) approach to ethics. I find this problematic because there have been significant criticism regarding calculating happiness. Which consequences? Whose happiness? Related problems include issues regarding the distribution of benefits    and discrimination of pleasures. How can a person tell that his suffering is greater than the next person’s happiness?  	Moral dilemmas arise from questions such as these. For example, there are government policies that protect the interests of the state at the expense of freedom, and vice versa. Often, utilitarian priorities might require the sacrifice of life in order to increase the sum of total happiness.    RIGHT ACTION  	Immanuel Kant, author of Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals, condemns popular moral philosophy because it is based on the utility value of outcomes that is so indefinite it is not suited to be the basis of universal moral laws and duties. Kant argues that “the concept of happiness is so indefinite that although each person wishes to attain it, he can never definitely and self-consistently state what it is that he really wills.”5  	Kant proposes that instead of grounding morality on the utility value of outcomes, in order for morality to have a definite basis, it should be grounded on the duty not to hinder man’s freedom of action. Every human being should have all the freedoms possible to frame, revise and pursue his own conception of the good for as long as he does not hinder the similar freedom of other human beings. What matters above all are not the ends (outcome) that we choose but our freedom to choose them.   	Kant argues that there is only one natural right: the right to freedom of action. Unlike other animals, man is free because he possesses reason or the capacity to set an end for himself. By definition, in Kantian terms, freedom is independence from being constrained by another’s choice.  	Freedom of action is a natural right because man,     by nature, is a rational being who has the capacity to set an end for himself.	In Kantian terms, it is by virtue of man’s nature that every human being is under duty to treat every human being in every case, including oneself, as an end in himself, and never merely as a means to an end.6 Man is treated as an end in himself if he is free to set an end for himself. Therefore, man is treated as a means to an end if he is forced to live a life that he does not value.    In other words, if his freedom to frame, revise and pursue his own conception of the good is hindered. In Kantian ethics, this duty is the basis of the moral law.   Contrary to utilitarianism, it is the means (action) that justifies itself. An action is right if it is according to duty. That is, if it does not hinder freedom. This is the act-oriented (deontological) approach to ethics.  	Critics argue that if man is free, how come he is under obligation to recognize a duty? An obligation is coercive. Coercion is a hindrance to freedom. In reply, Kant explains that if a certain use of freedom is itself a hindrance to freedom, then coercion that is opposed to this certain use of freedom is not a hindrance to freedom.7   MORAL DEVELOPMENT  Lawrence Kohlberg of Harvard University claims that there are three levels of moral reasoning (pre-conventional, conventional, and post-conventional). Each level has two stages.8 Accordingly, Kohlberg argues that we can see how far along someone has come and how far they still have to go. The reasons for acting are the indicators of the levels or stages of reasoning.  Firstly, at the pre-conventional level, good and evil is understood in terms of reward, punishment, and power. (Children from ages four to ten are usually at this level.) In Stage 1, all that counts is power. “Good” is what the person with the most power says is “good.” Stage 2 advances on this slightly. “Good” is being seen as something that will bring about some benefit to the individual.  Secondly, people at the conventional level take as their moral standard the expectations and rules of their family or society. At Stage 3, “good” behavior is seen as pleasing or helping others or at least trying to. At Stage 4, social order is most important. Doing one’s duty, respecting authority, and maintaining the status quo are seen as good ends.  	Thirdly, at the post-conventional level, people make moral decisions according to autonomous moral principles. Stage 5 has a social contract and utilitarian orientation. Good and evil depend on free agreement or standards adopted by the whole society. At Stage 6, good and evil are determined according to individually chosen universal ethical principles – justice, fairness, equality and the like, primarily justice.		  	Kohlberg describes the post-conventional, autonomous, or principled level as one where there is  “a clear effort to define moral values and principles which have validity and application apart from the authority of groups or persons holding these principles and apart from the individual’s own identification with these groups.”9 According to Kohlberg, the most fully developed or “advanced” way to behave is very Kantian. That is, when we are able to assess our behavior according to universal, abstract moral principles. This is deontological or “act-oriented.”   MORAL LOGIC  	Ethics is not about what we feel about an action and its outcome. Rather, it is about our reasons for doing something. What counts most in ethics is what we think.  	What we feel is private because we can’t argue about what we feel about something. Feelings just have to be accepted. Thomas White explains that “simply put, feeling statements describe our own internal, private, emotional, or physical states: ‘I feel happy,’ ‘I feel angry.’ ‘I feel depressed,’ ‘I feel like I’m in love,’ ‘I feel hot,’ ‘I feel cold.’ If you tell me that you feel unhappy or warm, I must accept that as your description of what if feels like from the inside. I can’t debate it. It would be ridiculous for me to say, ‘No, you don’t feel unhappy’ or ‘You shouldn’t feel unhappy.’ Our ethical convictions are arbitrary because we identify it with what we feel. Feelings are inconsistent. People’s emotions can change dramatically.10 White elaborates that “On Monday we’re in love with someone, on Tuesday we can’t stand them, and on Wednesday we’re back together.  The first time we lie, we feel terribly guilty; the fifth time the guilt isn’t so bad; and by the twentieth time we congratulate ourselves on how well we do it. How people feel about an action, particularly whether they feel guilty or not, doesn’t really contribute much to an ethical investigation.”11  	What we think is public because we can argue about the reasons we have for acting. There are right and wrong reasons for acting. Right reasons are consistent and universal. Wrong reasons are called fallacies or errors in reasoning because they are inconsistent and conditional to what we feel.12 In Ethics, the most commonly committed fallacies are argumentum ad populum, argumentum ad baculum and argumentum ad verecundiam.  Argumentum ad populum (appeal to popularity) is fallacy because it is an argument based on the premise that what is popular and traditionally accepted is right. Of course, it does not always follow that because a belief is widely accepted to be right that it is right. This is mob-mentality or bandwagon thinking. Bertrand Russell, author of Marriage and Morals, comments that “the fact that an opinion has been widely held is no evidence whatever that it is not utterly absurd; indeed, in view of the silliness of the majority of mankind, a widespread belief is more likely to be foolish than sensible.”13  	Argumentum ad baculum (appeal to force) asserts or denies something in the world by using threats or coercion. Force is usually the last resort when arguments fail to prove their rationality.  	Argumentum ad verecundiam (appeal to authority) is a vicious effort to suppress reasonable disagreements by demanding absolute obedience. Abraham’s supposed moral dilemma whether or not to obey god’s command to offer his son as a sacrifice is actually a misplaced guilt. There was no genuine moral dilemma in Abraham’s case because what was demanded of him to do was unreasonable. It is not always the case that obedience is right. In the same manner, all laws are legal but not all laws are just.  Obviously, appeal to popularity, force and authority are errors in reasoning because they are inconsistent    and conditioned by their desired ends (outcomes). Whereas, reason demands consistency in action.14  	For ethics to have existential relevance, it should be based on consistent and universal principles. Thus, the basis of right action is not popularity, force or authority. Rather, it is the obligation to perform the duty not to hinder man’s freedom of action.   CONCLUSION  Ethics is about the evaluation of actions, not outcomes. Right action is prior to good outcome. Only outcomes of right actions are good.   Right action is consistent and universal because     it is based on reason, not on feelings. Reason demands consistency in action. As it were, an action is right if   it is according to the duty not to hinder man’s freedom of action. Duty is coercive because it is a hindrance of a hindrance to freedom.   What matters above all are not the ends that we choose but our freedom to choose them. Thus, the only perversion is when a person is forced to live a life that he does not value. No one is wronged by what one consents to.  In this manner, an action is right whether or not its outcome is good, if, and only if, in doing so the agent treats every human being, including oneself, in every case, as an end in himself, and never merely as a means to an end. In Kantian terms, it follows that the outcome of an action is good, if, and only if, the action is done by forcing a human being to live a life that he does not value. In other words, if his freedom to frame, revise and pursue his own conception of the good is hindered.  As a teacher of ethics, I believe that the purpose of moral education, and education in general, is not merely to reproduce existing values and institutions. Rather, it is about the production of social critics and  re-evaluation of values.

						   Diego A. Odchimar, III   ABSTRACT: The problem of meaning is one of the most fundamental persistent problems in philosophy. Meaning has been a frustratingly obscure concept. The meaning of a word is said to in the text itself. There are no realities outside the text. Meaning is in the good order of signs and their relation to one another. But a distinction has to be made between the meaning of the author (speaker) and of the word. A word could be a signifier of unintended meanings.  KEY WORDS: meaning, truth, word, proposition, metaphors, signifier, signified object, rule, intention, speaker, hearer, author, reader, grammar, logic, rhetoric, structuralism, deconstruction, Plato, Aristotle, Rousseau, Wittgenstein, Derrida, Saussure, Barthes 	  NOBODY seems to know meaning or how to define it. There is a persistent inability of linguists, philosophers and hermeneutical and literary theorists to give a satisfactory definition of meaning. W. V. Quine comments that “pending a satisfactory explanation of the notion of meaning, linguists in the semantic fields are in a situation of not knowing what they are talking about.”1  It is useful to look at some of the problems that must be faced before we examine the theories of meaning. It is well known that the problem of meaning involves questions about author’s (speaker’s) intention, autonomy of the text, role of the reader, nature of language, source of meaning. Structuralists, like Ferdinand de Saussure, take meaning as a given, a center, a point of reference, then they identify the system of codes responsible for the accepted meaning. For Deconstructionists, like Jacques Derrida, rather than seeing meaning as a center that governs structure, meaning comes after, a product of structurality.   LITERARY MEANING  How do we know what a work of literature is supposed to mean? Does a work of literature mean what the author 'intended' it to mean, and if so, how can we tell? Does the meaning exist 'in' the text? Does the meaning exist in the reader's response, his processing or reception of the text?  John Lyle explains that there are several ways to approach the problem of meaning in literature.2 Firstly, meaning could be what is intended by the author. We can speculate on the intended meaning by reading other works by the same author, by knowing more and more about what sort of meanings seem to be common to works in that particular tradition, time and genre, by knowing how the author and other writers and readers of that time read texts, their interpretive practices were, and by knowing what the cultural values and symbols of the time were. The assumption is that any text can only 'mean' within a set of preexisting, socially supported ideas, symbols, images, ways of thinking and values. In a sense there is no such thing as a 'personal' meaning; although we have different experiences in our lives and different temperaments and interests, we will interpret the world according to social norms and cultural meanings.   Secondly, meaning could be 'in' the text itself independent of literary conventions or cultural perspectives. Structuralists argue that meaning exists in the text. The formal properties of the text (e.g. the grammar, the language, the uses of image and so forth) contain and produce the meaning, so that any educated reader will inevitably come to essentially the same interpretation as any other.  Thirdly, it could be that meaning exists in the reader's response. Roland Barthes argues that meaning is in how the reader processes the text. In a sense, meaning exists only insofar as it means to someone as art is composed in order to evoke sets of responses in the reader. Thus, “every text is eternally written here and now.”3   KNOWLEDGE-CLAIMS  	The hegemony of epistemology in philosophy is inherited from Descartes. The Cartesian tradition gave the highest priority to what we can know. Thus, even in philosophy of language the problem of meaning has been reduced into proving the truth value of propositions. In order for a proposition to be meaningful, its terms, or words, should have a relation to the world that would make them true.  	Does a proposition have to be true to be meaningful, or it has to be meaningful to be true? In sum, this is the master problem of philosophy of language. The problem is on how this controversy would play out, or how it should. Should philosophy of language move away from truth in favor of meaning, away from logic in favor of rhetoric?  Our words refer to reality. But it is problematic whether or not there is only one reality. Newton Garver and Seung-Chong Lee concede that as with so many problems in philosophy, it was Plato who first brought this dilemma to our attention.4 There is a view that there is just one sort of reality, the world of everyday fact, to which our language is related. This one reality to which our words refer must determine what our words mean, and its facts must also distinguish between truth and falsity. On this account, meaning is in the correspondence between propositions and facts. A term, or a word, is a sign of the object with which it is correlated. If the object of the term does not exist, then the term is false and meaningless.  	Critics of this view argue that false propositions are not necessarily meaningless. A proposition is false because one of its terms has not been assigned a correlate from among the objects. But it is meaningful because it accords with the rules of a language. Criterion of meaning is distinct from criterion of truth in that questions of truth are empirical questions and questions of meaning are questions of context. Truth is determined by facts. Meaning is determined by rules.   FALSE PROPOSITIONS  In Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein argues that “to understand a sentence means to understand a language.”5 A proposition is meaningful if it is made out to accord with the rule. That is, if it occupies a logical space in the whole structure of a language. You can know the meaning of a proposition only if you are familiar with the logic and grammar of the language.        Rules are not descriptions. They are prescriptions of use. They are inherent in certain customs or practices. In this manner, meaning is not about the description of physical reality which is either true or false. Rather, it is about whether or not a rule is obeyed or disobeyed. This is the element of structuralism found in Ludwig Wittgenstein’s philosophy of language and in the work of Ferdinand de Saussure.  	Saussure argues that “in language there are only differences.”6 No term, or word, can be described or identified individually, apart from the system of which it is part. For example, the word “yellow” is meaningful because there are other colors. If there are no other colors, we won’t have a concept, or picture, of what is yellow. Meaning must be conceived in terms of the differences or contrasts of a sign against other signs. In other words, the meaning of a proposition and its terms can be found in the comprehensive system to which it belongs.  A proposition, or term, would have a different meaning in a different system.  This is structuralism. In a generic sense, it is the view that it is possible for a proposition to be meaningful even without a reference to physical reality. As it were, a word, as a sign, is meaningful in relation to other signs not necessarily to any signified object. In sum, Wittgenstein pointed out: “Essence is expressed by grammar.”7   PRIVATE LANGUAGE  	Wittgenstein concludes that the meaning of signs cannot be determined privately.8 Of course, we have private experiences. But the meaning of signs cannot be personal. Language is a socially viable form, a game. As there are different rules for every game, when language games change, then there is a change in concepts, and with the concepts the meanings of words change.  	Iris Murdoch, author of Metaphysics as Guide to Morals, explains that this is so because a structuralist denies that there is anything outside of the language.9 In a famous comment, Jacques Derrida sums it up: “There is nothing outside the text.”10 There is no way to understand texts except as units of language, defined structurally.  	But the utterance “I am in pain” definitely has a different meaning if uttered by a person in pain from a person not in pain. Language may not always refer to the physical world in order for it to be meaningful. But it does not always refer to itself. Language is a means to convey thoughts about houses, pains, good and evil, or anything else we please. But it is the end, or intension, of the person that makes an utterance meaningful. For example, everyone says “I love you.” It is the same word “love” and the same proposition “I love you.” The same structural phenomena but they could be used to dignify one’s inner experience or to deceive others. In order for us to be certain about what this utterance means, rather than deny that there is any reality outside of the structures of language, we need to investigate on the validity of the truth-claim of the proposition by proving its correspondence with the intended signified object of the speaker. The same utterance could have different meanings in instances when the same signifiers have different signified objects. Thus, an error in signification is possible. On this ground I reject structuralism.   METAPHORS  	Like Cratylus, in Plato’s dialogue, structuralists won’t admit that we use language to tell lies. A lie is a proposition that signifies objects other than the intended signified object.  I am lying in the instance that I tell someone “I love you” when the ordinary use of the proposition is too strong to signify a less dignified feeling that I truly have for that person. In other instances, the same proposition could be insufficient to signify the intensity of my inner experience that I would summon the use of other signifiers which ordinarily have a different use. For example, instead of “I love you,” I would tell that person “You complete me.” The proposition “You complete me” is a metaphorical use of the term “complete” that is ordinarily used to signify a puzzle. This proposition might not make sense in a comprehensive system of signs. But it is meaningful nonetheless because it succeeds in signifying the intended object.   Aristotle, in his book Poetics, explains that “Metaphor consists in giving the thing a name that belongs to something else.”11 In this sense, propositions are metaphorical if they do not signify the intended signified object. “I love you” could mean “I want to have sex with you” or something else. To account for the meaning of an utterance, it is an imperative that we demand the speaker to define the terms he used in his utterance. Definition of terms is done neither by merely giving the contrasts or differences of the terms in a language, nor by stating the context of ordinary use. There are several metaphorical uses of any proposition because there are various ways a proposition might fail to express something true.         In practice, to define a term is to show the picture.     For this reason, in poetry, we are required to show rather than tell.   RHETORIC  The metaphorical nature of language requires us to acknowledge that meaning is also in other things other than words. Meaning is not always the fixed, canonic and binding truths of its ordinary use. Any word, any proposition, can essentially deviate from any supposed unity of meaning.   	During speech communication, there is an important sense in which there could be more than one thing going on between the speaker and the hearer because the semantic perspective of one differs from another. In some instances, words signify unintended meanings. This makes a dialogue difficult.  The problem is whether or not meaning can be fixed at all. To solve this problem, I propose that a distinction must be made between the meaning of the author and of the word. We do not simply mention the words. We intend the words to signify what we mean.12 Thus, meaning is in the intended signified object of a sign. The meaning of a text depends on the intentions of the author rather than on the timeless meaning of the component words.  In the game of chess, the players are well aware of the rules. The rules determine whether or not a move is legal. That is, if it obeys the rules. When a player makes his move, he opens up a plurality of possible meanings. Knowledge of the rules could help the opponent guess whether the move is a good move, a blunder or a gambit.  But it is not a guarantee that he could single out which among the multiple meanings is the right one unless he knows the intended meaning of the player who made the move.  With this, philosophy and rhetoric is reconciled.   Like Socrates, we should always demand for the analytic clarity of the words we use in our conversations to make sure that we are proceeding together. More than that, like the Sophists, let us pay attention to the metaphors of rhetoric because they are signs used to clarify the meaning of the author (speaker).   CONCLUSION  	There is a view that meaning is entirely determined by the play of differences and contrasts in language. That is, that the meaning of a proposition is in the good order of signs and their relation to one another. Thus, there are no realities outside the text. The inner experiences and intentions of language-users are irrelevant. Meaning is determined by the rules, or the logic and grammar,        of the language. 	  	However, if there is nothing outside the text then speaking and writing are merely acts of quoting ready-made propositions. Likewise, reading is merely an act of checking whether or not the use of a proposition obeys or disobeys the rule.  	Language does not always function in one way. It does not always serve the same purpose. There are multiple meanings available for each word. Usually, a context would disambiguate the meaning of a word. But contexts are not sufficiently determinate unless what is heard is the same thing as what the speaker said.  	Meaning is neither entirely determined by rules nor by contexts of ordinary use. Words have no meaning if isolated from the intended signified object of the speaker. Any articulated meaning is suspect if it excludes the relevant relation between signs and what they signify.   A sign is a completely different thing from what it signifies so that meaning changes according to the changes in the intended object of a sign. This is why we accord a priority to the speaker when we wish to understand what an utterance means. Meaning is what the speaker wishes to say.  In many instances, the meaning of the author (speaker) is different from that of the word. Meaning cannot be spoken in words. Rather, meaning is why words are spoken.

						   Diego A. Odchimar, III   ABSTRACT: Discourse on truth dominates the traditional philosophical theorizing in the fields of Metaphysics, Epistemology, Language, Logic, Ethics and Science. Traditional theories of truth have never really worked out a convincing repudiation of the general skepticism that none of our beliefs are objectively justified as any more likely true than its negation. Rather than formulate theories of truth to assuage this alarming intellectual worry, postmodern philosophers have abandoned the discourse. For the purposes of this essay, I shall argue that truth is merely a convenient fiction and that rationality does not presuppose the idea of truth.  KEY WORDS: truth, dualism, appearance, reality, knowledge, object, subject, skepticism, relativism, rationalism, empiricism, pragmatism, postmodernism, Plato, Kant, Frege, Austin,  Wittgenstein, Nietzsche, Pierce, James, Kuhn, Foucault, Feyerabend, Putnam, Rorty    	WE ARE SITUATED in the world. We look at the world from where we stand. One implication of this is that the world appears to us differently. We have different pictures of the world. A second implication is that anyone’s opinion about the world is as good as anyone else’s. Another implication is that the only criterion for what is a fact, and what it is rational to accept, is whether or not it is coherent to a belief system, or system of values.   	A being with no values would have no facts either.     Hilary Putnam, author of Reason, Truth and History, argues that ‘every fact is value loaded and every one of our values loads some fact.’ Every decision that a picture of the world is true, that an idea is rationally acceptable, reveals our total system of value commitments.1 There are no objective values. Even science is not value-neutral.   METAPHYSICS  	The common sense idea of truth is correspondence to physical reality. A belief is true if it is a statement that mirrors, or copies, the features of the world.       In other words, a statement is true if it accurately reflects objective reality. This is the correspondence theory of truth.           J.L. Austin explains that a statement, by definition, is a truth claim. By definition, statements are made with declarative sentences. Not all sentences express a statement. Only a declarative sentence is a statement because it makes a claim about the world that is either true or false.  Take, for example, the declarative sentence ‘The cat is on the mat.’ This statement describes a particular state of affairs, namely, that situation in which a cat is on the mat. Austin argues that this declarative sentence is true, if and only if, I use this declarative sentence to make the statement that a cat is on the mat.2   	Traditionally, the correspondence theory has been described as the claim that truth involves a correspondence relation between truth claims (statements) and physical reality. A true statement corresponds or agrees with the facts. Truth is a relational property. Thus, in these terms, a ‘fact’ is just another name for ‘true sentence.’ The Logical Positivist school of philosophy endorses the correspondence theory of truth. Logical Positivists disparage most abstract entities (e.g., ‘just’ and ‘good’) as useless postulations because they cannot be defined in terms of correspondence to facts.  	But this theory of truth is problematic because our conception of the world is necessarily incomplete.    Thomas Nagel, author of The View from Nowhere, argues that “the world is not dependent on our view of it, or any other view.”3    EPISTEMOLOGY  	Traditionally, knowledge is a true, justified belief. As it were, correspondence theory of truth is a realist theory because it holds that among the conditions individually necessary and jointly sufficient for the truth of a belief is a condition to the effect that a certain state of affairs must obtain. For a realist theory, the object of a belief in question must be mind-independent.   A fact must not be a thought or a mental entity.         For example, a belief that snow is white is true only if snow is white in the extra-mental world.  	But not all truth claims are about facts. Not all statements are declarative sentences about the physical world. Often, we make statements like ‘Abortion is immoral’ or ‘Angelica is beautiful.’ Ordinarily, we appraise the truth of these statements relative to some scale or conceptual paradigm. When we say “Abortion is immoral,’ we are saying that abortion is immoral because it fits the essential characteristic of what is repugnant and objectionable. Likewise, ‘Angelica is beautiful’ is true because it fits the profile of archetypal beauty. Thus, correspondence theory of truth, a realist theory, fails to justify everyday descriptive beliefs, in particular, evaluative statements about mental entities. On a realist theory of truth, none of our moral beliefs and aesthetic preferences would be justified as any more likely to be true than their denials.  Non-realist theories of truth, like the pragmatic criterion of truth, justify the truth of beliefs by appealing to meaning. For them, truth is not a matter of fact. Charles Sanders Pierce, consistent with the phenomenology of Kant, argues that truth is not something “overwhelmingly forced upon the mind in experience as an effect of an independent reality.”4 Real objects are determined by the mind. Reality is whatever is said to exist or to be the case in the statements to which everyone (with sufficient relevant experiences) would agree.     LANGUAGE  	The dictionary definition of a true belief or statement is one that “agrees with reality.” William James, author of The Meaning of Truth, a pragmatist, insists that this phrase is doubly ambiguous, it does not tell us what sort of relation could constitute agreement in this context, and it does not tell us what is meant by ‘reality.’5  	To understand a sentence is to know which circumstances would make it true. In pragmatic sense, it means that ideas become true just in so far as they help us into satisfactory relations with other parts of our experience. Any statement, which guide us to beneficial interaction with sensible particulars is true instrumentally.6 Thus, James’ famous answer to the question regarding the ways with which to know whether or not a truth claim (statement) agrees with physical reality:     “By proving useful to those who believe it.”7  	Ludwig Wittgenstein, author of Philosophical Investigations, argues that any judgment, even of sense impression, has to go beyond what is ‘given’ to be a judgment at all. There are implicit norms to which we appeal in ordinary judgments. Wittgenstein calls these implicit norms, or conventions, as rules of language games we play. What is true and what is rational is what is warranted by the institutionalized epistemological justifications (forms of life) of statements.8 For example, the statement ‘Love means not forcing anything on a beloved, not even love’ is true, if and only if,           a particular language game uses the word ‘love’ to mean that way. Wittgenstein insists that in order for us to have a concept at all, we need ‘agreement in our judgments.’   LOGIC  Truth is preserved in valid reasoning. The laws of logical inference preserve truth. As Gottlob Frege said, “logic is the science of truth.”9  Donald Davidson believes that the requirement for a sentence to be true is its truth condition.10 The truth value of a statement consists not only in its correspondence to reality (‘Snow is white’ is true, if and only if, snow is white), but whether or not they follow the laws of logic (e.g. law of non-contradiction, law of identity, law of excluded middle). This is the classical Aristotelian conception of truth. We could perhaps express this conception by means of a familiar formula: “To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false, while to say of what is that it is, or of what is not that it is not is true.”11   	Consequently, logicians dismiss evaluative statements, like expressions of moral beliefs, aesthetic preferences, and those that purport to assert truths, as merely expressions of feelings because the only intellectually respectable concepts can be defined ultimately and entirely in terms of the concepts of logic, mathematics, and physical science.    At issue are paradoxical statements. In particular, the Buddhist maxim “In every truth, the opposite is equally true”12 appears mistaken because it seems to contradict its own assertion. Of course, I personally believe that this is a meaningful statement. Obviously, laws of logic are formal and empty that they fail to accommodate the fact of the basic heterogeneity of human beings and the different situations they occupy in the world.    ETHICS  Hilary Putnam argues that ethics does not conflict with physics, as the term ‘unscientific’ suggests. It is simply that ‘just’ and ‘good’ and ‘sense of justice’ are concepts in a discourse which are not reducible to physical discourse. It does not necessarily follow that because ethics is about value judgments, not matters of fact, that it is not rational or intellectually respectable.  Putnam insists that a statement of fact is actually a value statement. Truth itself is defined by our criteria of rational acceptability.13 Contrary to traditional belief, it is not truth that confers rational acceptability on statements of facts. Rather, it is our criteria of rational acceptability that confers truth on our statements of value.   Thus, I argue that it does not really matter whether or not evaluative assertions, like expressions of our moral beliefs and aesthetic preferences, are true. What really matters is whether or not such statements are rationally acceptable.  Morally right action is a rationally acceptable action. The problem is not that we do not have a way to verify that evaluative statements agree with physical reality. The problem is whether or not we have a plausible criterion of finding out what is rationally acceptable. This is a philosophical problem.  	Immanuel Kant was well aware of this problem.        In Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals, Kant proposed that what is rationally acceptable is to treat every human being qua a human being. That is, man, should be treated as a person, not a thing. Every human being including oneself, in every case, should be free to set and end for himself because, by nature, as the origin of the will, he has the capacity to set and end for himself.14   SCIENCE  Truth is the aim of science. Of course, scientific truth is correspondence to physical reality. Obviously, this obsession to mirror, or copy, the features of the world is heavily influenced by the Platonic dualisms (appearance-reality, matter-mind, etc.) that dominate the history of Western philosophy.  	Richard Rorty, in Philosophy and Social Hope, argues that the vocabulary, which centers upon these Platonic dualisms, has become an obstacle to our social hopes.  Rorty suggests that science should be a quest for more means towards greater human happiness rather than a hopeless pursuit of the ‘truth.’15   	Thomas Kuhn, author of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, argues that science is arbitrary and value-laden.16 Prejudice aside, science is actually an ethical and political position that is of equal value with other cherished cultural values like the belief in the existence of a personal God, or the belief in the Divine Right of Kings. What was previously thought of to be objective has turned out to be subjective paradigm.  While James asserts that true and rational beliefs tend to facilitate the achievement of practical goals,  Paul Feyerabend, author of Against Method, and        Michel Foucault, author of The Archeology of Knowledge, argue that there is something political in our present institutionalized criteria of truth and rationality. They link it with capitalism, exploitation, and even sexual repression. Feyerabend, like Foucault, stressed the manner in which different cultures and historic epochs produce different paradigms of rationality. As Kuhn puts it, different paradigms inhabit different worlds. This is the thesis of incommensurability which helped dismantle the traditional hierarchy of disciplines that dates back to Plato’s image of the divided line.   CONCLUSION  	Truth is a convenient fiction traditionally employed to arbitrarily legitimize and artificially confer a privileged position to some epistemico-ontological hierarchy.  By rejecting the metaphysical correspondence theory of truth, rational acceptability could be rephrased as “mutual respect of the freedom of every human being to frame, revise and pursue one’s own conception of the good.” Thus, the only irrationality is when a person is forced to live a life that he does not value.  	Any conception of the world must include some acknowledgement of its own incompleteness. A view that what exists must be identified with what is thinkable by us  sense is an attempt to cut the universe down to size.  	The truth about the universe is something which we cannot describe or know fully because it lies beyond the reach of language, proof, evidence, or empirical understanding.

      I AM not yet a lawyer. But I can help my father's lawyer draft his petition to AFFIRM the Decision of the Deputy Ombudsman for Mindanao that was REVERSED by the Tanodbayan (Ombudsman).   In effect, this is my first case.Below please read the draft of the petition.   My father sent me the copy of the Order that REVERSED the Decision of the Deputy Ombudsmanfor Mindanao and other documents pertinent to his case.   The Deputy Ombudsman for Mindanao DISMISSED my father's case due toinsufficiency of evidence while some respondents were found guiltyonly for lesser offense of Insufficiency and Incompetence in thePerformance of official duties.   My father is not the principal among the respondents. In fact, thecase is entitled NBI vs. Efren U. Anggo, et. al. (OMB-M-A-02-208-H).   &nbsp;   DIEGO P. ODCHIMAR, JR.,  Collector of Customs II  Petitioner   Versus   Hon. SIMEON V. MARCELO  Respondent   For: GRAVE MISCONDUCT;  GROSS NEGLIGENCE   &nbsp;  PETITION   Assailed in this petition for review on certiorari is the &nbsp;6 June 2004 Order of Tanodbayan Hon. SIMEON V. MARCELO&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reversing the 11 December 2003 Decision of the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Mindanao on the case NBI vs. Efren U. Anggo, et. al. (OMB-M-A-02-208-H) finding all the respondents not guily of Grave and/or Gross Negligence &nbsp;&nbsp;due to insufficiency of evidence while some respondents were found guilty only for lesser offense of Insufficiency and Incompetence in the Performance of official duties.   The facts of the case are as follows:   On 11 July 2002, at around 7:50 in the evening (PM), a vessel named “M/V RODEO” docked at Masao Terminal Port&nbsp;&nbsp; (The Port) located at Lumbocan Government Wharf, Butuan City.1 The vessel entered the port without the pilot on board2 and was found to be carrying more or less 17,000 sacks of rice with an estimated value of P18,700,000.00.3 Shortly thereafter or at around 9:20 PM, laborers from CONCORD Arrastre and Stevedoring Corporation (CASCOR) started to unload the shipment (sacks of rice) from the vessel.4 The PPA officials at the port were fully aware of the arrival of “M/V RODEO” and its cargo.5   At around 9:40 PM, while the laborers were unloading the shipment, police officers headed by Insp. Zosimo L. Duarte, Jr., Chief Operation Officer of Task Force Regional Anti-Criminality emergency Response (PACER) arrived at the port. Insp. Duarte, using his mobile phone, called up respondent Efren U. Anggo who was then the Chief of Task Force RACER and confirmed to the latter about the arrival of “MV Rodeo”. It appears that respondent Anggo instructed Insp. Duarte to go to the port to confirm the information supplied by his (Anggo) “asset” about the arrival of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “M/V RODEO.”6 After 10 minutes, Insp. Duarte left the port.7 At around 10:00 PM, respondent Felix Gonzales and his men also arrived at the port.8 It also appears that respondent Gonzales went to the port upon the instruction of herein respondent Anggo.9 Since nobody could present documents supporting the shipment, respondent Gonzales stopped the unloading of the sacks of rice. However, there were about 1, 166 sacks of rice already discharged from the vessel and the same were already loaded into seven cargo trucks parked inside the port.10   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moments later, respondent Reynaldo Batoon with five policemen, arrived and reported to respondent Gonzales for instruction. The latter (Gonzales) instructed Batoon and his men “to stand by” since he (Gonzales) will be going to Butuan city to coordinate with the coast guard and the maritime command.11 Respondent Anggo together with the Provincial Director of Agusan del Norte and four other PNCO personnel also arrived. Respondent Anggo instructed respondent Gonzales to take over the investigation and to submit thereafter a report to the Regional headquarter.12 Thirty minutes after conversing with respondent Gonzales, the group of respondent Anggo left. Afterwards, respondent Gonzales also left the port at around 11:00 PM.13   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following day, on 12 July 2002, at around 1:30 in the morning (AM), respondent Gonzales returned to the port together with respondent Bustillo and PCG officials, namely: Adelardo Hernandez, Nestor Almeda and Colito Betarmos.14 Respondent PCG officials and two PNP personnel (The Boarding Team) boarded the vessel and they were able to talk to Mr. Fortunato Elemento, Chief mate of “MV RODEO”. The boarding team asked Mr. Elemento about certain documents relative to the vessel and its cargo but the latter failed to present the same. Allegedly, the said documents were taken by the Master of the vessel who went ashore to submit pertinent documents required for the vessel’s entrance formalities.15 Respondent Hernandez, Almeda, Gonzales and Bustillo left the port at around 3:00 AM and returned to their respective offices.16 meanwhile, respondents Bertarmos and four police offices were tasked to secure the vessel and its cargo.17   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At around 8:00 AM, respondent Anggo and his men arrived at the port “to take pictures of the sacks of rice.” He met respondent Hernandez who informed him that “no problem” so far was encountered.18 Respondent Batoon also arrived at the prot informing his men who were tasked to guard the vessel the whole night that they will be replaced by another group. Accordingly, at around 8:30 AM, a replacement arrived in the person of herein respondents Lucero, Jr., Espina and Doce.19   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time (8:30 AM), a certain Victoriano C. Tan, one of the rice millers of Butuan City went to the BOC office to inquire about the “M/V RODEO” incident.20 Initially, Mr. Tan was ableto talk to herein respondent Patriana, Sr and the latter decided that the matter be brought to the attention of respondent Odchimar, Jr.21 Upon being informed about the incident, respondent Odchimar, Jr. directed respondent Patriana, Sr. to conduct an investigation.22 The latter went immediately to the office of respondent Gonzales.23   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the Masao port, the boarding team at around 9:30 AM again boarded the vessel and conducted a re-inspection. Still, the personnel of “M/V RODEO” failed to submit the required documents.24 Thereupon, respondent Hernandez prepared and issued an Inspection and Apprehension Report (IAR) stating therein the following violations of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “M/V RODEO,” to wit: “1. Operating/Navigating without permit pertinent papers on board, 2. No Master on board and 3. carrying/unloading 15,000 bags of rice w/o pertinent papers/permit from NFA.”25 The said IAR was duly received by Messrs. Elemento and Yongod, Chief mate and Chief Engineer of “M/V RODEO,” respectively. Respondent Hernandez also requested the PPA to deny clearance for the departure of the vessel. The PPA approved the said request.26   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At around 10:00 AM, respondent Gonzales arrived at the BOC office and informed respondent BOC officials regarding their a[[rehesion of “M/V RODEO” and its cargo at Masao port. Respondent Gonzales further assured respondent BOC officials that the vessel and its cargo are properly secured under the custody of the PNP.27  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  At around 2:15&nbsp; PM, the vessel managed to escape at the port by cutting its mooring lines.28 Warning shots were fired by respondents Espina and Doce but were completely ignored by the vessel.29 The PCG conducted a “hot pursuit operation” but the same proved to be futile as the vessel was nowhere to be found.   On 1 August 2002, the National Bureau of Investigation, Caraga Regional Office XIII (NBI CARAGA) filed before the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Mindanao (OMB Mindanao) both criminal and administrative charges against the following officials, namely:   A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Philippine National Police (PNP)   1.&nbsp;&nbsp;S. Supt. Efren U. Anggo – PNP PPRO XII;  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Supt. Felix D. Gonzales – PNP BCPO;  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;S Insp. Reynaldo G. Batoon – PNP BCPO;  4.&nbsp;&nbsp;SPO4 Domingo Lucero, Jr. – PNP BCPO;  5.&nbsp;&nbsp;PO2 Ignacio C. Espina – PNP BCPO;  6.&nbsp;&nbsp;PO2 Jesse S. Doce – PNP BCPO;  7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Insp. Adrian B. Bustillo – PNP MarCom   B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Philippine Coast Guard (PCG)   8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Adelardo F. Hernandez – SCPO;  9.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeffry F. Jumawan – PO2;  10.&nbsp; Nestor F. Almeda – PO1   C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bureau of Customs (BOC)   11.&nbsp;&nbsp;Collector Diego P. Odchimar Jr.;  12.&nbsp;&nbsp;Customs Police Jose E. Patriana, Sr.; and   D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Philippine Ports Authority (PPA)   13.&nbsp;&nbsp;Edgardo H. Tidalgo – Terminal Manager   On 11 December 2003, the OMB-Mindanao dismissed the the case against respondent Diego P. Odchimar, Jr. for being duplicitous, a similar case having been filed already with the Bureau of Customs, Manila.30   On 11 March 2004,30 the said OMB-Mindanao Decision was referred to the Hon. ORLANDO C. CASIMIRO, Deputy Ombudsman for MOLEO31 and Hon. MANOLO MABINI, Graft Investigation and Prosecution Officer II for “study and recommendation.”   On 6 June 2004, Tanodbayan Hon. SIMEON V. MARCELO DISAPPROVED the Decision of the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Mindanao dated 11 December 2003 and meted the penalty of DISMISSAL from the service, with cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits and perpetual disqualification for re-employment in the government service.   After going over all the pleadings, Tanodbayan (Ombudsman) Hon. SIMEON V. MARCELO approved the findings of Hon. MANOLO M. MABINI, Graft Investigation and Prosecution Officer II, as recommended by Hon. ORLANDO C. CASIMIRO, Deputy Ombudsman for MOLEO, that there is sufficient basis to hold all the respondents administratively liable not merely for Inefficiency and Incompetence but for Grave Misconduct and Gross Negligence.32 The dispotive part of the said decision reads as follows:   “Thus, the fact that respondents Odchimar and Patriana failed to perform their duties as provided for under the law, they became willing parties to the said irregularity and therefore should be held administratively liable.”33   Hence, the present appeal by the respondent DIEGO P. ODCHIMAR, JR., Collector of Customs II, Customs District IX, Sub-Port of Nasipit, Agusan del Norte, to AFFIRM the &nbsp;11 December 2003 Decision of the Deputy Ombudsman of Mindanao on the case NBI vs. Efren U. Anggo, et. al.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (OMB-M-A-02-208-H) finding all the respondents not guilty of Grave and/or Gross Negligence due to insufficiency of evidence while some respondents were found guilty only for lesser offense of Insufficiency and Incompetence in the Performance of official duties.   &nbsp;&nbsp;  Criminal Law; Negligence; Exempting Circumstance   &nbsp;  Paragraphs 2 and 3, Article 3, Revised Penal Code  Definition.   “Felonies are committed not only by means of deceit (dolo) but also by means of fault (culpa).”   “There is deceit when the act is performed with deliberate intent; and there is fault when the act wrongful act results from imprudence, negligence, lack of foresight, or lack of skill.”   The escape of MV Rodeo and its cargo caused undue injury to the government.   &nbsp;  Paragraph 7, Article 12, Revised Penal Code  Circumstances which exempt from criminal liability.   “Any person who fails to perform an act required by law, when prevented by some lawful or insuperable cause.”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The haste departure or disappearance of “M/V RODEO” at Lumbocan Pier, Butuan City, is beyond the control of the petitioner DIEGO P. ODCHIMAR, JR., Collector of Customs II, and the Bureau of Customs (BOC) because the office has only one man in the Customs Police Division. Moreover, an earlier request was already made to the City Director, Butuan City Police Office to assign adequate PNP personnel to guard the vessel including cargoes on 24 hour basis pursuant to Sec. 2207 of the Customs Code of the Philippines.   &nbsp;  TARIFF AND Customs Code of the Philippines  Section 2207: Authority to require assistance.   “Any person exercising police authority under the customs and tariff laws may demand asistance of any police office when such assistance shall be necessary to effect any search, seizure or arrest which may be lawfully made or attempted by him. It shall be the duty pf any police officer upon whom such requisition is made to give such lawful assistance in the matter may be required.”    Same; Same; Same --   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Per reliable information received by his office that there were sacks of rice imported partly stored at Lumbocan Pier and the rest still in the vessel “M/V RODEO” docked at the said Pier, Butuan City, the petitioner &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DIEGO P. ODCHIMAR, JR., Collector of Customs II, Bureau of Customs, ordered Jose E. Patriana, Sr., Commander, Customs Police Division, Butuan City:   1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “In view of the foregoing, you are hereby directed to proceed to that place to verify the veracity of the said information and if possible, you may coordinate with the authorized representative of the National Food Authority. (See Annex “A”, letter dated 12 July 2002)   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simultaneously, the petitioner DIEGO P. ODCHIMAR, JR., Collector II, Bureau of Customs, coordinated with the Manager of National Food Authority, Butuan City (See Annex “C”); the Port Manager, Philippine Ports Authority, Butuan City (See Annex “D”); and, the City Director, Butuan City Police Office, Butuan City (See Annex “E”).   2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Per Customs Memorandum Order No. 20-2001 dated August 27, 2001 of the Commissioner of Customs the subject of which is the rules and regulations on the importation of rice and coastwise movement of rice shipment, you are hereby directed to demand from the consignee/carrier a duly issued Shipping Permit from NFA and a copy of the Import Authority for that particular shipment and a BOC official receipt showing that duties and taxes has been paid in connection with the alleged sacks of imported discharged ex “M/V RODEO”. (see Annex “B”, memorandum dated 12 July 2002)    Same; Same; Same --   The petitioner DIEGO P. ODCHIMAR, JR., Collector of Customs II, Bureau of Customs, coordinated with the Port Manager,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Philippine Ports Authority, Butuan City on the same day, 12 July 2002, to hold in abeyance issuance of clearance to “M/V RODEO”.   3.&nbsp;&nbsp; “Considering that the technical examination of the National Food Authority of the said sampled rice may take time, it is requested that clearance of the above-mentioned vessel be held in abeyance as it may violate Section 2530 of the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines, as amended.” (See Annex “C”, letter dated 12 July 2002)   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Port Manager of Philippine Ports Authority is charged under law with the implementation of the guidelines of Executive Order No. 493 per PPA Administrative Order No. 03-92 dated 15 Jue 1992. Pertinent provision of Paragrapgh 2.3 of section 2 thereof provides:   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The Entrance and Clearance Officer of the Bureau of Customs shall cease from issuing entry and departure clearance to all domestice vessels and from collecting the corresponding fees or charges relating thereto. However, they shall continue to issue permits or clearances for trans-shipment cargoes including the enforcement of anti-smuggling laws.”   Similarly, request was made to the City Director, Butuan City Police Office, Butuan City, requesting that adequate number of personnel be assigned to guard the vessel including its cargoes on a 24 hour basis.   3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Considering that the technical examination results of the National Food Authority,this city may take time and considering further that this Office has only one man under the Customs Police Division, it is requested that an adequate number of your personnel be assigned to underguard the above-named vessel including its cargoes on a 24-hour basis. (See Annex “E”, letter dated 12 July 2002)  In fact, Director Felix D. Gonzales of the Butuan City Police Office had made representation with the petitioner when he appeared in the office together with Mr. Jose E. Patriana, Sr., Commander, Customs Police Division, Butuan City, to effect the vessel and its cargoes are properly guarded.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, the vessel “M/V RODEO” without any clearance issued by the PPA, Butuan City, illegally departed from the Lumbucan Pier leaving at the said port its cargoes consisting of 595 sacks, more or less, of smuggled rice. Such that, Mr. Jose E. Patriana of the Customs Police Division, Butuan City, failed to implement the Memorandum dated July 12, 2002 (Annex “B”) because when he alleged/ arrived at the Lumbocan Pier, the vessel “M/V RODEO” had already left the port and he was only informed by Mr. Edgardo Tidalgo, PPA Terminal Supervisor designated clearance officer that “M/V RODEO” has no address and name of shipping linesx, no name of consignee of the cargo, no entrance & clearance when it docked and departed at Lumbocan Port, Butuan City.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike in Tenza vs. Espinelli (108 SCRA 157), there is no direct relation to and connected with the performance of official duties amounting either to the maladministration or willful, intentional neglect and failure to discharge the duties of the office.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike in Juan vs. Arias (72 SCRA 410), there is no negligence because there is no breach of duty, or failure to perform an obligation, and there is no gross negligence because there is no breach of duty that is flagrant and palpable.   Administrative oRDER; Jurisdiction; Functions and Duties   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The petitioner DIEGO P. ODCHIMAR, JR., Collector of Custom II, Bureau of Customs, had properly discharged his functions and duties in accordance with the Customs laws, rules and regulations in the efforts to protect the best interest of the Bureau and the governmetn relative to the alleged smuggled rice shipment on board “M/V RODEO”. These efforts were well demonstrated by the attached annexes from Annex “A” to Annex “CC” inclusive. Proper coordination with other government agencies were made to ensure proper implementation of the Customs Laws, PPA Administrative Order No. 03-92 and applicable laws and the memorandum of Agreement between the NFA and the Bureau of Customs.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fine, the petitioner had appropriately performed the duties and functions of his office in accordance with the law, rules and regulations and to the best interest of the Bureau of Customs and public service.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As mentioned above, the petitioner DIEGO P. ODCHIMAR, JR., Collector of Customs II, requested the Port Manager of Philippine Ports Authority, who under law, is charged with the implementation of the guidelines of Executive Order No. 493 per PPA Administrative Order No. 03-92 to hold in abeyance the clearance of “M/V RODEO” as it may violate Section 2530 of the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines. (See Annex “C”, letter dated 12 July 2002)   PPA Administrative Order No. 03-92 (25 June 1992)  Section 2.3   &nbsp;“The Entrance and Clearance Officers of the Bureau of Customs shall cease from issuing entry and departure clearances to all domestic vessels and from collecting the corresponding fees or charges relating thereto. However, they shall continue to issue permits or clearances for transhipment cargoes, including the enforcement of anti-smuggling laws.”   &nbsp;  Due Process; Warrant of Seizure and Detention   On 12 July 2002, the petitioner DIEGO P. ODCHIMAR, JR., Collector of Customs II, requested the Manager of the NFA, through Jose E. Patriana, Commander, Customs Police Division, Butuan City to do analysis and examination result/report on the alleged sacks of imported rice.   “In order that this Office can issue a Warrant of seizure and detention of the afore-mentioned articles, an analysis and examination result/report from your good office is needed as one of the bases in issuing it. (See Annex “D”, letter dated 12 July 2002)   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The petitioner DIEGO P. ODCHIMAR, JR., Collector II, Bureau of Customs, in accordance to the operational provisions of the Customs Memorandum Order No. 20-2001 &nbsp;&nbsp;did not have sufficient basis of issuing immediately a warrant of seizure without relevant material information at hand.

      “HINDI karuwagan ang pagsuko sa isang laban.”  &nbsp;  -- tugon ni Pilosopo Tasyo kay Crisostomo Ibarra  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sa Noli Me Tangere  &nbsp;   PRESIDENT GLORIA Macapagal-Arroyo rectified her past mistakes when she ordered the pull out of the 51-member Philippine humanitarian contingent in Iraq and effectively re-directed the priorities of our unconstitutional foreign policy.  &nbsp;  The withdrawal of Philippine troops from Iraq should not be dismissed as an act of cowardice on the part of the Filipinos. It takes a lot of courage to put the national interest of Filipinos as the paramount consideration over loyalty and subservience to the United States.  &nbsp;  The real issue in the decision is neither about honoring an international commitment nor about giving in to the demands of Iraqi terrorists. President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo’s decision is unprecedented among our leaders. It is clearly a political harassment to interpret it as a concession to popular sentiment. Rather, it is a principled&nbsp;re-affirmation of the legitimate political ends of our constitution.  &nbsp;  Article 7 of the 1987 Constitution declares that “The State shall pursue an independent foreign policy. In its relations with other states, the paramount consideration shall be national sovereignty, territorial integrity, national interest, and the right to self-determination.” Adherence to this policy is the principled basis of sovereignty of all self-respecting governments.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Our president is not weak and indecisive. Isolated and criticized by her closest allies for her decision to save the life of Filipino truck driver Angelo de la Cruz, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo has emerged as our legitimate and principled Filipino leader.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      THE COURT ERRED in its decision.  My father, DIEGO P. ODCHIMAR, JR., Collector of the Bureau of Customs, Department of Finance, is presently appealing the decision of the Sandiganbayan on an Administrative case dismissing him and some officers of the Philippine Ports Authority,  Coast Guard and Philippine National Police from service because they allegedly failed to perform an act required of them by the law. That is, they failed to stop a boat loaded with illegally imported sacks rice.  FACTS:  Upon notice that a boat loaded with illegally imported sacks of rice was in the port of Nasipit, Butuan City, Agusan del Norte, my father did order his Customs Police to go to the port and investigate the matter. His order was documented by a memo order he issued.  The Customs Police did not immediately proceed to the port for the investigation. He thought it necessary to report the case to the Philippine National Police. The Customs Police was then told to wait for instructions regarding the procedure on how to go about the said investigation. Thus, the delay. when the ordered Customs Police arrived at the port, the boat that they were supposed to hold had already left the port.  This failure to hold the boat prompted the National Bureau of Investigation to sue my father and others concerned.  HELD: my father is guilty of negligence for failure to perform an act required of him by the law.  If I am going to make a brief about the case, I shall argue that my father is exempted from criminal and civil liability. See Article 12, Par. 7 of the Revised Penal Code, "Exempting Circumstances"  Article 12, Paragraph 7 of RPC:  "a person who failed to perform an act required by the law, when prevented by a lawful or insuperable cause."  it was a lawful cause, the PNP procedure, that prevented the ordered Customs Police to go to the port to perform his duty.  Moreover, I am yet to do a legal research on this, there's a provision in the Administrative Code that separates the duty of the Bureau of Customs from the Philippine Coast Guard and the Philippine Ports Authorities.   Holding a boat loaded with illegally imported sacks of rice is no longer the obligation of the Bureau of Customs. Rather, its the obligation of the Philippine Coast Guard and the Philippine Ports Authority.  I am yet to verify whether or not among the allegations that caused the dimissal of my father from service is the allegation that he conspired with the Philippine National Police to let the boat loaded with illegally imported sacks of rice go.  These allegations are completely baseless.  I'm going to write an article about it and submit it to the UST Law Review, the law journal of UST Faculty of Civil Law.  Of course, I need to do a lot of scholarly legal research on this case.

      I SHOULD FEEL AWFUL, else I would be complacent.  I was caught off guard tonight in my Persons  class. I was praying the past few meetings for  Atty. Ragajo to call me up to recite in class because I was ready to answer all his Socratic  questions regarding the provisions and cases  related to Articles 3 to 14 of the Civil Code.  Sadly, the heavens did not heed my prayers. Well,  the gods must be making a fool out of justice.  Tonight, on the last minute of our class in  Persons, Atty. Ragajo called me up.  I let my guard down and did not prepare to read  the cases on Articles 15, 16 and 17 before I  attended today's class. I need to learn my lesson  the hard way: Law students should not relax  because being a lawyer is not a profession to be  trifled with.  Luckily, Atty. Ragajo is not a god. He is all too  human that he gave me a chance to make up and  make amends on class recitation on Monday.   OBITER DICTA:  Mistakes of decision made by the lower courts can be cured by an appeal. The decision of the Supreme Court is final.  Hehe.
