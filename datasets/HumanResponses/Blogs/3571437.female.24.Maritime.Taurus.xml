      will be going for my jabs today.  goodness it's going to be 5 of them at least! and i can't remember all of them.. know i am going to get Yellow Fever, Hep A, Tenatus, Malaria, and prob Rabies if the doctor has his way.  ouch!  mom was like 'u are getting more jabs now than when u left for india. so that place is not safer than india ah?' hmmm... sounds so logical! but maybe it's because i am leaving for 2 whole years at least, that's why i need more jabs.  but rabies? doc's argument is 'brazil has wild animals'.   i thot i am staying in the city?! or what animals is he talking about, i wonder... maybe i should get pepper spray or something (dumbaids, if you are reading this, this is the present u owe me!!!). think animals (or not) would be scared of it right?  hmm, being a vegetarian will put me in greater danger - the animals will not see me as a threat. so i should start eating meat and let the animals see how i slice the flesh and chew it slowly in my mouth as a warning to them. let them know i am a carnivore!  okok, talking crap. it's a beautiful day in SG, let me enjoy it before i wince in pain.

      L.O.V.E.  what did u think it was? ;op  it's one of the most difficult word to apply, i realise.   things appear so wonderful when u are falling in love with a guy whom u think is the best on earth. the birds sing (not chirping irritably), the flowers bloom (not attracting bees and scaring people) and food taste better (even those canteens in industrial areas).  your heart skips many a beat when you see HIM. your breath quickens and you start talking in a giggly voice. you tell HIM little things (there's a cockroach in the office today!) and you do little things for HIM (sending him inspiring quotes everyday).  then as u embark on a journey of discovery... clouds of doubt start hovering over. why doesn't HE do this or that? why does He do this or that? why does HE behaves like this or that? am i bothering HIM with all the silly things i have done? am i irritating? if not, why doesn't HE reciprocate or show some indication at all? does HE really like me, let alone LOVE me? is this a mistake? Maybe, just maybe, the relationship was never meant to be in the beginning.  birds wake u up early in the morning chirping irritatingly (don't u wish to just shoot them off the tree). bees buzz dangerously close to u as they fly around the flowers in the garden (insecticide pls). and food is just tasteless, if lucky. else it's shit on ur plate (will someone do everybody a favour and fire the chef).  perhaps it is time to let go when ur consciousness are all about the pain and tears start flowing. it was good while it lasted. but another question pop up: who should decide the time to end it? how 'long' is it 'good' enough?  my 1st lesson in love taught me not to think so much, what counts is the happiness at that present moment. I applied it and found out that it is not totally true; the bitter aftereffect that follows the end of the relationship can be just as intense, if not more.  so my 2nd lesson learnt: consequences of being in or not in love cannot be belittled. one can have the pleasurable experience while in love at that moment, and will also have the painful ordeal of surviving the lost of love. cos eventually u are the one who is going to live with ur decision made that time and its repercussion.     after these lessons, i am starting to think, maybe it's better to continue liking a person than to start something with HIM if the relationship was never meant to work out. the best impression of the person remains in memory.   of course, u are happy when u are with HIM, in a love relationship. all the things done together become the beautiful memories which are so precious. but it is these treasures tucked away at the back of the head that will make it harder to let go. cos u have put so much into it, that u just can't say goodbye.  not now, not yet.  maybe things will change for the better. maybe we can work something out. but when it doesn't, it turns ugly. what u will remember of the relationship will be the nasty stuff, not the good ones.   wise old saying: it's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved  my saying: it's an easier option to fall in love with someone you like than choosing to NOT fall in love with HIM. but the consequences are for u to bear, so u better think bloody 10x about that so u won't end up shooting birds early in the morning.

      another day in office. nothing much to do, but to wait for vendors to come back with quotations.   another 22 days left in SG before hopping onto a 30 hour flight to Brazil. feelings: frightened (50%), nervous (48%), anxious (1%), excited (0.8%), eager (0.2%) (yes, in this order)  never been away from home for so long. the longest was to my India expedition trip in 2002, and that was for 3 weeks. still remember the time i went for my 1st overseas trip without mommy and daddy - 1994. geography trip to perth in secondary 2. teared when i went pass the gates, and mommy's eyes were red too. and i was away for one week only.  sometimes it takes an event to happen to realise how much u are loved or would be missed, or otherwise. some have remained pretty much quiet over my posting, except with a few words of blessings. of cos many many good friends, jie meis, buddies have shown concern, care and love over this adventure i am about to embark. they made me feel that this life has not been wasted because of our friendship. you know who you are. =0) cheers to our friendship.

      that's the time i have left in SG excluding today.  i think i have settled my burning problem. at least with myself.  it was a painful thing to decide and execute. but not doing it will be more painful in the future.   I felt tired, but refreshed at the same time, cos i am at peace.

      have you ever felt so stupid sometimes that you wished the earth would just swallow you up? or that you feel you don't deserve to live cos you screw up exactly the same mistake the SECOND time? stupid right?  not only by being stupid makes you feel idiotic, it also hurts you.   been upset about some stuff happening in my life recently. this incident just made me rethink what kind of person i am: stupid, stupid and stupid.  this was meant for someone to read but i doubt he will. see, how stupid i am. writing all my thots and feelings and yet the person targetted will never bother to even click on this link to read.  i should be hung for believing in somethings so easily. hope i will survive in brazil, me being so naive and gullible.   i noe i am sinking into soft ground. yet i am hanging onto some weeds at the side, cos i don't wan to let go. Stupid huh. i noe the weeds are snapping any moment, or probably there weren't any to start with in the first place! it's all my imagination and wishful thinking! now i am more than stupid - i am blind and i hallucinate.  i am giving myself until this week to settle this issue with stupidity. it's about time i snap out of it and spend more of my energy and time on worthwhile things and people. Give me strength to get out of the trap. a trap which i can't decide it has been laid by the predator or by myself.

      Been meeting up people.  Quite a few categories: Good friends, Friends, Lost-touch, Buddies, Relatives, Don't-really-want-to-meet acquaintance.    Of course enjoyed the time out with people i love and those who love me very much. It's really these times that will be engraved onto the memory and be replayed when i am alone in Brazil.  Relatives - 2 sub-categories. Group A consists of very close relatives. Group B is, well, those you won't even want to hang out with to get Ang Pao for Chinese New Year. But due to the circumstances i am in, i have to meet both of them. like it or not.    As for the last category... it was rather paiseh to reject when people want to meet you. it's an honor to be desired! tho' sometimes may feel that it's a chore and a waste of precious time. but you never know when your paths will cross again, so better keep that connection open ;op  then there are also those whom you like to meet after losing touch for a long time but when you really catch up, you realise that you have nothing to say to each other. it's really sad when it happens, cos you will expect the dinner to go smoothly, filled with laughter and gossipy updates, only to be disappointed with silence over the meal.  Was rather heavy hearted, to realise that some ppl will really make time out to meet you up. even for a quick meal or so, while others, usually ones that you cherish, doesn't really bother about you or the fact that you are leaving in less than 3 weeks' time.   That's life for you. Time to wake up if you are still dreaming.

      17 more days to go.   been out with frens and spending as much time at home as possible. the jabs been making me feel very tired. i took a total of 4 jabs - 3 on thursday (tetanus, hep A, Typhoid) and 1 on friday (Rabies, 1st shot out of 3).  talked to the manager i will be reporting to in Brazil, he came back to endorse his visa. My queries have more or less been answered:  Internet Access - Will apply for me, so should not be a problem  Accomodation - Will stay with another girl temporary, until we have found the new location to move into. Yes, single. Me, Myself and I.  Telephone - Very expensive to call back. Looks like i have to rely on internet then. Company will provide a local mobile phone. hehe. You guys in SG can still con't sms-ing or calling me on my SG mobile since i have decided to apply autoroaming. but i will have to pay the bucks.   Food - Yes yes... trying to incorporate meat into my diet now. but if there are much veggie or grass to be grazed, i might just go back to being veggie! the servings usually go by kg, and for a simple lunch will cost abt SG$7-8. Good resturants will cost abt SG$30 ($1 Reais = $0.6 SG) or more. I will try cooking. probably will lose another 10 kg from the lack of nourishing and edible food (my cooking).  Clothes - Office wear similar to SG. so it's casual + smart. and during the weekends, dress shorts and t-shirt. no fancy orchard-road fashion show here...   Climate - Brazil is in the same latitude as in Aussie. so now it's winter. it won't get lower than 15Deg in the day, and 12Deg in the night. and i am staying near the coast, so it will not be that bad.   Safety - will be travelling together with my colleagues to and fro work as we have a car sharing system. no pepper spray needed.. apparently not that bad. but will be mindful.  Well, looks like it's pretty much on my own now... Pls give me strength. HIKES!

      best.  HR passed me the visa application form YESTERDAY, on 22 June, just 8 more days from my flight. and i always thot it has been settled.  that's not the only shocker. apparently if the application is not successful the 1st time, i can forget about sending up the 2nd time, cos apparently, they will reject it as well. so my question: "Then, I no need to go if my visa not approved is it?" The universal answer was given: "Don't know but try 1st lah"   hahhaha. i dunno to laugh or cry.   it's like i am so scared of leaving my family and friends, and slowly psychoing myself that it'll be ok. i will survive and it'll be a great experience in exchange for home-sickness blah blah. and now i may end up not going at all, let alone say leaving on time!  amazing how this big company works. simply astonishing.

      5 July 2004 Brazil RJ   Yo people!!!!  I just got internet access at my workplace!   it was a very tiring but fun weekend.  We reach Paris in the morning at abt 7am. checked into a day hotel (Euro 89 for that few hours!!!!) and went to Eiffel Tower. my 2 idiotic colleagues think they could just ask around in the sub way station while i thot they knew the way... so i went back and ask the receptionist. anyway french are snobbish assholes who think that French is the best language so if u speak english ' sorry i don't understand you' urgh! but we were lucky to bump into an old couple who were going in that direction and we figured out the way to get there altogether. after the effiel tower trip we went back to hotel in taxi (no train. won~t be able to make it for teh plane if we did!) i was napping and when i woke up, my legs were so jelly that i fell on the carpet and scratch myself!!!! my knee bled! hahahahhaaa.. was too tired on the 13 hour flight.   then another 12 uneventful hours and we reached Rio at 630, 2 of us stay at 2 different apt in Rio city while the other colleague went to our yard 3 hours away. went shopping with 3 uncles and at nite attended a party. the brazilian gals are BEAUTIFUL with GREAT bodies. now i am thinking, i won~t be able to achieve my goal: to find a boyfriend here... sob sob...  sunday went to another town, where our yard is based at. the aptments where one of the colleague is staying face the BLUE sea. oh my goodness. it~s really 'got money also can't buy'. really really beautiful but out of the way. it's almost a 3 hour drive to town  my apt is great too, facing the famous sugar loaf cliff and the jesus christ statue. really FACING. but next to us are slums... and last nite i heard gun shots for teh 1st time. the nite is lited up by the slums located in the hills... the city is so beautiful with the colourful stars. but it's ironic that the nite beauty of brazil is shone by the poorest.   today 1st day of work. already anticipating lots of things to come my way. will show u all the pics next time, i loaded into my laptop.   AND DID I MENTION THAT MY COLLEAGUES ARE SO CUTE! THERE' S THIS GUY I BE WORKING WITH ON A PROJECT WHO LOOKS LIKE THE CLARKE KEN SUPERMAN?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE BRAZIL!!! hahhahaha love you all. muaks  Greetings from RJ Brazil. PS: I still be accessing this email. but just in case this is my other working acc: DaChin@technip.com sounds stupid hor.

      Rio 12 Jul 04 Monday  Friday 9 July we had a farewell dinner for Larry at a Chinese restaurant. It was not too bad, and I had the good chance to talk to my colleagues. (and the owner’s cat is sooooooooo cute!)  The topic on Affairs of the heart came up. South Americans are known to be more passionate and possessive. Melissa, a local colleague said she thinks that passion can come and go, but not love. She believes that one can rekindle the passion that is gone. I argued: how would u know the passion will come back once it is gone. It’s the same issue as how would you know when to let go of a relationship when it’s stale? Guess… you just know it.  My input is that Asians tend to have passion only in courtship. Once family is set up, the passion is taken over by commitment to feed the family. Isn’t it true. Till now I have only seen a few cases where the passion is shown to each other, where love is for only each other and commitment is to stay with him/ her even with temptations around.   Gaffore said lust and love are inter-related. (somehow he always gives me the creeps. Especially now that he say this… yew!)  Melissa is with a guy for more than 3 years and they hardly see each other except during the weekend. So I asked what is passion? “it’s looking at that person and you go ‘WOW, she’s gorgeous’”.   I wonder, really, if anyone of my friends is that blissfully in love, in passion and in commitment. I will be truly happy (and envious, to be frank) for him/ her, and for myself too – because I will be convinced that such relationship exist not only in the Samba country. Maybe I will not be that lucky to have this kind of life… but hey, no one gets the best of everything! I am fortunate to know there is such thing. But till then I will keep hoping, and praying for my love ones to get such happiness.

      16 Jul 04 Friday  &nbsp;  Last nite we held a party for uncle larry, who is leaving for SG tonite.  &nbsp;  the place, which is a pub, is beautifully decorated with many antiques. 3 stories high and there is a live band playing local music (not samba, something milder). the things in the bar is for sale! but i guess it can get quite eery. i was frightened by this bronze statue HEAD of a man at the end of a corner.  &nbsp;  we headed to the place right after knocking off. the ppl here can just drink without eating dinner. there's finger food tho'. the beer here is quite nice, even i enjoyed it. have been forced by ppl here to take alcohol, like red wine and beer. hope my liver survives these 2 years.  &nbsp;  the music is addictive. there are dancers (or dancing students) who come here to dance to their music. the way they sway and move is so well coordinated. the old, young, sexy, pretty and ugly all got to the dance floor. there's this old couple... the woman looked so happy to be dancing! then i was (again) forced to dance. a male colleague invited me to it, and guided me along. simple lah, but also seem quite stupid "2 steps left 2 steps rite". then there's another way to dance, which he said 'hope you dont mind but usually the ladies here dance more closely to the guy... and so i can lead you'. i said no, not knowing how close he meant. and yah, he is rite, I BLOODY HELL MIND! hahhaa. ok lah, it's just uncomfy to be so close to a guy. (and he is not good looking - this is THE point. haha)  &nbsp;  left the place abt 1030. really tired. but again i had fun. would love to go there again.  &nbsp;  this morning woke up to cook breakfast for uncle larry. hope he is not suffering from stomachache. he is so kind to deliver some letters and few boxes of chocolates for my family. i am so going to miss him. sob sob.  &nbsp;  the ppl here love to talk loudly. i am suffering from headaches for the past few days. and they slang very strongly. wah lau. the only time i have some peace is during lunch. urgh.  &nbsp;

      14 Jul 04 Wednesday bom deer (its pronounced as bong jeer - good morning) enjoying... i guess so. i mean try to find out as much and have as much fun as possible. yesterday miss home alot, prob becos its getting v stressed at work. think my boss is expecting quite alot from us (the SG ppl) cos he say he is very disappointed with the way the brazilians work here. slow, and not up to standard. but i see them stay back everyday after office hours, prob to clock OT time for the extra money. i feel so bad to be leaving on the dot at 6am with my boss and colleague. no choice, have to follow them cos they drive... until i find the way home using the Ferry. (yes in sampan to go home. hahah)  yesterday made a HUGE mistake at work. i printed out a wrong set of documents and put it into a contract. thank goodness it was discovered before the vendor hope onto the plane back SG. else... i dunno what will happen. suffered many paper cuts, and i think i killed many more trees than i think i should. hikes! then boss ask me: so have you tried to negotiate with them (there's some issue i am supposed to trash out with the supplier)and get them to agree to our terms. i really tried. i think my weakness is i have a soft ear... instead of them agreeing to us, i helped them to look for the stuff! haiyo, must be hard. boss say "this is how it is like. Who has the buying power? If (whoever has it) say jump off a bridge, the other must oblige. if he say kneel you must kneel. IF U WANT THE CONTRACT. else u can just walk off.   that's how business goes is it?  For the less than 14 days i am here, i have been having dinners and lunches with suppliers. They pay the bill of cos. it's so different working here. in SG, i can't even be allowed to be seen with supplier outside. here.. well, guess it's much lax here. much much more. really unused to the fact i am eating for free most of the time.   one of the SG uncles going home soon. then my boss going back to collect his work permit (meaning no need to renew his visa every one month kind. its a semi perm, for 6 months to 2 years). then i will be alone here. the uncle is so nice, he cook breakfast for me everyday, and yup, i have definitely put on weight. theres a gym at my block. will visit it when free. but these days been so tired and always reached home at nite. dunno where to find the time to lost weight. i think i will join the advance club. not bui bui but FAT FAT.   i am using ICQgo! at work, meaning i can chat online as long as i have internet but i dun have the contacts. i need to add again. if u girls have, then add me: 82702332 (Suzzie). i will turn it on everyday at work from 8am to 6pm. hope to see u all soon.

       Rio 12 July 2004   Stuck in jam today again. really sickening to be in a car for so damn long 1-1/2 hours. my butt is getting flabbier and bigger. yucks.  its really interesting to be staying alone. i bought this can of tuna (supposed to make sandwich for a SG gathering but i didnt) and i dont have a opener. i used the swiss knife to open it... only manage to poke a big hole.. tehn i use a scissors to cut it open.. hahahaha so funny.  then this morning, blur blur never check properly i put SALT into my tea. and i thot 'wat the hell, ppl drink mint SALTY tea here?!' hahahhaaa...  The bathroom drain is clogged. hope to get someone in to fix it soon.   10 Jul Sat evening we had a dinner together at Sam's plc, a gal here till Sept from Fels. The guys here smoke like chimney. Lost abt SG$15 from gambling. never have luck in these kind of money. I cooked this thing taught by Larry, the E&A guy who is gg back SG soon- Dumpling with Banana (and some jello like sweets). NOT BAD!!! my virgin dish received good comments! hahahha. i made some ham sandwich too,  just in case the dumplings sucked.   Got to know this Brazilian Born Taiwanese at the gathering.. she is working in Fels Setal (Keppel Fels in Brazil). Pretty lady, and she was commenting how brave I am to come to brazil to work.   To me, its really an opportunity idiotic to miss. Maybe even if sent to middle east I will seriously consider. The world is getting so much smaller. I will only be a frog in bottom of the well if I stay in SG. No offence to those who beg to differ. I mean its individual preferences, especially if one already has a direction and a goal in mind. No point diverting and get lost. Maybe I am just adventurous.   Sun was a rainy day here, 17Deg. Who on earth say Brazil is a sunny place!!! hehe, no lah, its just the winter.  Found a shopping plaza near my place. Goodness, it is huge. the clothes are much cheaper than in SG. haha. now i noe where to go on weekends.  Will be learning to drive once i have some basic portuguese. here no car is so inconvenient! but boss say he is scared i go out alone.. that i may get into trouble. think he meant with the police or so.. heard horror story that they demanded US4000 from our guy when he and his family didnt bring passport with him. but later bargain to R100 (abt SG60 or so).   thats the update for now... have asked Fels to give me internet connection. dont care. i am getting so BORED in my apt.

      9 July 04  It’s really a privilege to be a female sometimes. In fact most of the times.  I get the new laptop. I get the best room in this secondment to brazil. I get most of the attention from my boss. I do feel that if I am Graffore, I would be jealous and maybe angry at the differences in the treatment.  But hey, life’s unfair isn’t it?  1st day in brazil, where I will be spending most of my 2 years here.   The nite scene is so beautiful. The hills occupied by shanty towns (squatters) are lighted up like colorful stars. It’s really sad that the beauty of this country is shone by the poorest citizens. What an irony.  The moon was a glowing orange red color as it rose up the sky tonite. I thot it was the sun!   The people are reputated to be very friendly. Yet to experience that but I am definitely looking forward to it.  Miss mum. Hope she’s doing fine.

We reach Paris in the morning at abt 7am. checked into a day hotel (Euro 89 for that few hours!!!!) and went to Eiffel Tower. my 2 idiotic colleagues think they could just ask around in the sub way station while i thot they knew the way... so i went back and ask the receptionist. anyway french are snobbish assholes who think that French is the best language so if u speak english ' sorry i don't understand you' urgh! but we were lucky to bump into an old couple who were going in that direction and we figured out the way to get there altogether. after the effiel tower trip we went back to hotel in taxi (no train. won~t be able to make it for teh plane if we did!) i was napping and when i woke up, my legs were so jelly that i fell on the carpet and scratch myself!!!! my knee bled! hahahahhaaa.. was too tired on the 13 hour flight.   then another 12 uneventful hours and we reached Rio at 630, 2 of us stay at 2 different apt in Rio city while the other colleague went to our yard 3 hours away. went shopping with 3 uncles and at nite attended a party. the brazilian gals are BEAUTIFUL with GREAT bodies. now i am thinking, i won~t be able to achieve my goal: to find a boyfriend here... sob sob...  sunday went to another town, where our yard is based at. the aptments where one of the colleague is staying face the BLUE sea. oh my goodness. it~s really 'got money also can't buy'. really really beautiful but out of the way. it's almost a 3 hour drive to town  my apt is great too, facing the famous sugar loaf cliff and the jesus christ statue. really FACING. but next to us are slums... and last nite i heard gun shots for teh 1st time. the nite is lited up by the slums located in the hills... the city is so beautiful with the colourful stars. but it's ironic that the nite beauty of brazil is shone by the poorest.   today 1st day of work. already anticipating lots of things to come my way. will show u all the pics next time, i loaded into my laptop.   AND DID I MENTION THAT MY COLLEAGUES ARE SO CUTE! THERE' S THIS GUY I BE WORKING WITH ON A PROJECT WHO LOOKS LIKE THE CLARKE KEN SUPERMAN?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE BRAZIL!!! hahhahaha love you all. muaks  Greetings from RJ Brazil. PS: I still be accessing this email. but just in case this is my other working acc: DaChin@technip.com sounds stupid hor.

      21 July 2004   Feeling very miserable.   more paper cuts.   Work is getting tougher. Luis, the superman yandao now is treating me like his secretary, asking me to amend this amend that on the contract.... then whatever is amended is not approved by my boss have to amend again. and boss was like `he is thinking portuguese and writing english.. but you leh` ? understand what he meant, i should have a mind on my own, but now stuck in between..   & one more contract coming in the afternoon.   hated the feeling of taking over 1/2 way. 1st ppl throw their shit at you, 2nd u have no knowledge of the prior&nbsp;happenings.  the weather isn't helping by casting grey clouds and sprinkle light rain all night and morning. So miserable. It was so cold&nbsp;last nite, i was TREMBLING when i&nbsp;was walking in the streets. My legs were almost cramping when i got into the car. 15DEG!&nbsp;I think i will develope pneumonia at the end of the week. or frostbites on my purplish fingers and numbed toes.   Then this afternoon miraculously the sky cleared. it&nbsp;is a nice afternoon, but it is still cold.  &nbsp;  Wan to go home. Wan to go home. Wan to go home. Wan to go home. Wan to go home. Wan to go home. Wan to go home. Wan to go home. Wan to go home.

      20 July 2004 &nbsp;   it's a freezing day today, temperature at 15Deg. Mad man. my fingers turning purple in color. My bathroom is flooding, from an unknown source. water just keep seeping from the cabinet under the sink. The pipe is not leaking, think the water may come from the wall or the floor. Haiz. &nbsp; Migrane migrane migrane.   &nbsp;  19 July 2004  &nbsp;  Another gloomy day. Thot I could come into office early to check my mails and stuff only to find out no internet access. What crap. Some stuff can’t wait. But I guess it’s fated somehow.  &nbsp;  Uncle Larry’s absence is sorely felt. Wonder if he is back in SG, and have he contacted mom. It’s 1020am now in Brazil, have to wait for another 2 hours before she will be back home from work.  &nbsp;  =*(&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      17 Jul 04 Uncle Larry left for SG last nite. What an adventure. My boss and I left the office early at 5 pm, rush to take the ferry home. Larry cooked for us a sumptuous meal of salmon, pork braised in country wine, soup and lembak chicken (something like lontong). We left our place at 715pm to catch a 1020 plane. Thot we have more than ample time to get there, but we missed a turn and got into this bus terminal town. It was a busy town, streets filled with peddlers trying to sell things like fruits. Many kids running around selling things to the cars stuck in jam. We lost our way and couldn’t get out. Larry hopped into a cab with his luggage, then me and boss followed him. Then we get stuck in a jam for about half hour with my boss and Larry getting anxious. We saw children climbing up a lorry and stealing drink. Then a kid run up to our car and cleaned the window. Poor things. Finally we got out of the jam after much swearing and cursing and reached the airport. But Larry wasn’t around! The taxi driver left him lower level – arrival hall. By the time he queued up, he was the last 2nd one. And he has to pay overweight charges of US$1000 (over by 23 kg). And when he wanted to take one luggage out – “no, it has been sent in, and we don’t have time to do that”. Poor thing.&nbsp; just got to learn that he need not pay afterall. think he will be refunded. &nbsp;  Today is a rainy day. My plan to visit the nearby shopping center, with many stalls in the alley like basar malam was drenched by the rain. The wind was huge today. Can’t wait for summer to come, really don’t like the cold, and can’t do so many things. I haven’t seen so many places with the weekends all wet and cold! I am hoping tomorrow will be a better day. I am not asking for bright sunny day but please stop raining! But finally I get to enjoy my apartment. I am very at home at my place now. But the real test hasn’t come yet – cooking. Think I brought all the Chinese ingredients for nothing. Would rather go out and buy something than cook! Hated the oiliness and the cleaning.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Melissa is a very sweet girl. She offered to bring me around, and gave me her number so if I want to go around I can call her anytime. Such a sweet girl.  &nbsp;  Tonite a colleague is cooking dinner. Ah – boss just called. Time to go and eat (again). Seen the gym today. Have 3 treadmills and.. that’s all… have a sauna room and Jacuzzi! Goodness I NEED to find a boyfriend soon.. hhahahhaaa..&nbsp;

      25 July 2004  There were little kids hanging out a street just outside our hotel. Maybe about 7 years old in torn jeans and worn out clothes. Saw them on Sat afternoon and Sun morning. Were they there all the time? They were hunging small boxes of chewing gums and sweets, probably trying to sell.   I have also seen kids knocking at the car windows at red-light junctions, asking for money.   Don't the government have welfares for them?  It is saddening to see, they have to endure the&nbsp;hardships of life at such an early age. What will become of them in the future? Probably end up as local valet parking service-provider, getting R$1 or R$2 for each parked car. Or peddlers selling snacks along the Niteroi bridge to the cars stuck in jams, in freezing cold rainy days.  life is unfair.

      24 - 25 Jul 2004  Left for Sao Paulo on 24 Sat morning.   Selso is&nbsp;a brazilian Tommy sent to pick me up at 515 am. Well, i overslept and thank goodness he call woke me up. rush down in 10 mins and as usual, duck and chicken talking.   he went to pick up another guy, a caucasian at a hotel in Rio then we went to meet the rest of the guys; Tommy, Samantha and Lionel. Me and Lionel took Selso's car and luckily, they can communicate through hand language. I was totally lost.   It took us about 6 hours to reach Sao Paulo, stopping for snacks along the way. Brazil is scenic, with so many mountains and hills. We passed by this lake or river, and cos it was still early, there was a layer of fog just above the water. Can't decide it's mystically beautiful or just plain eerie.   Selso had to stop to ask for directions to our hotel, Blue Tree Tower. Many times. he would wind down his window at EVERY opportunity and asked the driver or passer by how to go there. I think he asked more than 10 times before we found the place. Heard that is the case in brazil, one shouldn't trust only a person's direction advice cos they would point different places, cos they want to help.   But brazilians are really helpful. On our way to the shopping centre, Selso did the same thing, and there was this uncle who stopped his car and came to tell us how to get there. and as we con't the same direction for a while, he would yell to us how to get there at EVERY opportunity also. But we still got lost. Especially we have to coordinate with the other car Anthony is driving it was tough. we circled around a stadium (today there was a match, Brazil with Mexico or Argentina, not sure. but just heard alot of shouting and fireworks, think Brazil must have won) with policemen on horses. Wow, damn cool.   There, we finally had our lunch at 2 plus. Chinese food (Tommy Sam and Anthony wanted that. Me and Lionel were like, we have been eating many types of food, BUT brazilian food). And went shopping for 2 hours. bought a pair of shoes at R$50, a bit too tight cos no size. a thick jacket (really warm) R$60, a pair of jeans abit too loose on the backside, or i have a thick waist... have to alter back in SG, at R$40, and 2 Zara tops at R$18. Great buys, i think, for 2 hours for less than SG$100.   Sam was sick, so we went back to the hotel and rest. Later that nite the rest of us went to the nitespot in SP. We went to this pub but the nite ended early cos Tommy suffered from both gastric attack and Lao Sai, and Anthony was tired. I gulped my Malibu and ended up sleeping in the car. Cos the guys wanted to see the Red Light district, helpful Selso (who had taken 12 Caparinas, a very strong local drink and 2 Beers in the Pub) asked EVERYONE how to get there. The waiters, the bouncers, the passerbys.. so in the end everyone knows where we are going. In the end, we decided to go back hotel since the whole of SP knew where we planned to go.   The next day was short. We went to a flea market downstairs. The stalls sold old old stuff, and makes me wonder who would want to buy them. Collectors maybe. Saw a couple of nice earrings but the thot that it might be worn b4 gives me the creeps. As we walked on there was this parade on the whole stretch of road. Stalls selling handicrafts, art work, earrings, blah blah were set up on the road side. A fortune teller yakking in portuguese with his bird tried to give me&nbsp;a telling, but due to communication failure, i decided not.   There was dance showcase on stage. Dancing hot samba like dances, and one performance replayed Dirty Dancing. Was fantastic. Further there was a lady teaching how to dance something like line dance. it seemed easy, was so tempted to join in!   The stalls offer so many things and so cheap. i bought 4 pairs of earrings, and 2 handicraft - handpainted tiles, at R$3/ pair and R$5/ pc. so cheap. too bad we couldn't really explored thoroughly, cos we need to check out at 12pm. Finally reached my nest at 7pm and was greeted with a spoiled tv and a flooded bathroom.   Actually SP is a big city. I think these kind of flea market is common in Brazil, and ironically i have yet to go to any in Rio. Comparing, I think i like Rio more, cos they have more to offer like beaches and many more beautiful things, the Christ Redeemer and Sugar Loaf.   It was a good weekend after suffering in silence in Office. =) hope i am recharged before facing another week.

      2 Aug 04  haiz.  was informed that my visa is extended for another 90 days.  haiz.  thot i won't be that lucky to get the longest extension. then i got back the passport and it is written 31/11/04. shit that is 4 months! then boss say it must be 3/11/04. cos the max is 3 months, and there is no 31 in nov.  i was told that most probably b4 the 3 months is up my work visa is ready in SG. meaning i have to go back to collect it. BUT after getting my work visa, i will have to use my entitlement of coming back 2  per year already. can't use the excuse that business visa has expired and have to come back SG to re-apply.  haiz.  i really miss home. i like it here, am enjoying myself. am getting the hang of work. many beautiful places to visit, and good cheap things to buy. but i still miss home!  haiz.

      1 Aug 04 Sun  Went to the Hippie Market at Ipanema. So nice! bought quite a bit of things.. Many handicrafts are sold. one stall sells face masks made of leather (interesting). Art pieces are also sold. We ate African traditional food, which i didn't like. This young girl came to ask for food we didn't finish. really poor thing. Then saw golden retreivers puppies being sold. The parents are also there, i guess to show the potential buyers the good breed. As we walked along, huskies, chihuahuas, terriers, cocker spaniel are sold too. SO CUTE. urgh. altho i dun agree with selling them, but at least they are in hands of animal lovers. was thinking abt the pet breeding farms in Singapore. haiz, think the animals here have a better life.  31 Jul 04 Sat  Spend the 1st half of the afternoon at a chinese restuarant with the SG ppl. It was the looongest lunch i have ever taken. we arrived at 1pm, and the food came at 2.30pm. we left the restuarant at 3.30pm. it was so long, that big boss had to tell the owner to hurry up serve the food, cos he has to leave for the airport at 4pm!  Then Lionel, Sabah, Melissa, her son Joshua and me went to Sugarloaf. It was beautiful. There is a pub also (brazilians love to party, and will create any opportunity to do so). Then there are groups of ppl exercising. not the SG kind of old ppl doing taichi, but doing aerobics, yoga (somehow seem like Falun Gong to me) and cycling (on stationery bikes... funny huh.)  From Sugarloaf can see the Christ statue on the next cliff. we also caught the sunset. beautiful.  At nite, Lionel and I went to the nite spots in Lapan. We went to the biggest disco. We did a test to see how many guys want to pick me up. so i went walking around alone. nope. but was molested by this idiot, who used his elbow to brush me! so angry, i pushed his arm away. hope his hand rots!  Then caught a few boys starting a fight in the middle of the dance floor. the security stepped in to stop it. one of the boys was stopped by a girl, and the whole event has a 'happy ending' with the winner smooching the prize away all nite. sounds like cavemen to us. hahaha. There was a band who came to the stage to sing, with dancers in the back. of cos skimpily dressed. The girls are not that hot, but one of the male dancer was W.O.W. great toned muscular body with a killer smile. The dancing was the main attraction, and whenever the gal expose her little panties under the short skirt, wolf whistles and cat calls are heard.  A fat man approached me for a dance. yah rite, over my dead body (which will be when he tripped over me during the dance). then as we leave, another young boy wants to talk to me.  WHY I ATTRACT PERVERTS, FAT GUYS AND YOUNG BOYS!!??

      Rio 30 Jul 04  Group Procurement Big Man was here for the week. Today went to dinner with him and the rest of the SG ppl at this restuarant specialising in Moqueca (stew sour spicy seafood). It was great and fun. But I was abit upset when he said that he wants to make me the first woman project manager in Keppel Fels.  Wah lau, if i dun live up to the expectation then isn't it very 'throw face'. of cos happy that he has such high hopes on me, but must he tell everyone or not... Nevermind. say whatever he wants.  After dinner we went to a disco pub. It was nice, but the crowd is abit old (hang out with old men, what to expect. haha) Then Melissa told me that a fat man next to us while ordering drinks at the bar told her that he loves me! so funny, and he was yakking 'Chinatown Chinatown' to her. hahah... Then the night proceed on quite ok, danced with the SG ppl, and at the dance floor a young boy wanted to get to know me. Why do i keep attracting the WRONG ppl?  Went to Leblon and stayed for the weekend at Sam's apt. There was porn channel. Of cos watched it (a bit only huh, just to see why the males are so fascinated about it). so gross. just like animals.

      IT IS FINALLY OVER.  Finally, after 11 days of negotiation, the deal with a Canadian company is finally closed. they have been asking alot of conditions... wat a pain to deal with them. it was quite ugly for a while, cos the supplier was fed up when we keep changing our mind on what we promised them (well have to thank superman for that.. he agreed without thinking and later when boss don't agree, we have to turn them down). Superman practically gives in to them most of the things. and i have to clean the shit. haiz. Boss isnt too happy we took so long, and gave in to them.  but learn alot alot on the legal things in the contract. thanks to my SG colleague who has been so patient to help us. we do have a pretty brazilian legal advisor here, but other than being pretty and distracting to the supplier and have a very fantastic mouth.. eh, not much other things i can comment on.  moved to this new office at Gloria where many he-she appeared at nite. so ugly. our changi gals put them to shame. now i have to walk 15 mins to a post office near the old office. life is always like that, until u lose something, u won't appreciate the presence.
