      I play my part quite well really consdidering my job and all but i'll tell you what really winds me up no end.  People collecting for charity on high streets.  This is not including big issue sellers who enjoy chatting to its the other ones who approch you for money which i class as begging and its rude, im out doing my shopping and i feel like im undercover trying to dodge these middle class idiots.  At one time i remember when all they would do is shake thier money tin and declare what charity they are collecting for.  I didnt mind this, id always pop change in, no hassle, no problems!!  But now they intimidate you, without change boxes!  They want your bank details so you can make a donation every month!!!  Its becoming ridiculous!  Don't get me wrong im a very generous caring human being but this is going to far, its out of control and i have been extremly rude with a few of them because every 30 seconds whilst shopping in Chester i was approched!  The thing is i do what i can,i pay my bills promptly, i pay tax, i have a job which is dedicated to supporting young people, i pay five pounds per month to an animal charity, i always sponser friends and family, i do certain sponsers myself, i buy the big issue, i give to the homeless and im a regular blood donor and i am drawing the line!!

      Do you ever feel like you can figure people out far to easily.  Im always seeing right through people and it winds me up! I can see why people say and do certain things and it just seems so shallow.  For example i notice when people say a certain thing to me which is obviously because they want me to ask them a certain thing but im not like that im not nosy i dont care for gossip its pointless.  Most people i know live off it.  Your just missing whats important.  What a shame :(

       didn't think id come back did you, almost didn't, why do we forget things so easily, my user name vanished from my brain.  Last night was o.kay I suppose, I hate coming home early.  I cant believe im letting someone control me in such a way.  Once upon a time I was never that way.  I've always been really independent.  Is that the real meaning of love?  Becoming something you dislike?  Im going to drive myself into insanity.  I do think to deeply about things and I wish I was a little less cynical, what am I saying no I don't I love being me, its so much fun.  I love it when I can tell people really aren't to keen on me.  It proves im not shallow or bothered when it makes me smile!  Bye for now :)

      I used to do this a long time ago when things just didnt go to plan, this is an accident, i have just read someone elses postings and now here i am.  When i did this once before it made me worse so im just going to be positive with the thoughts i am tracking.  I am really scared i am getting married next year to a wonderful person and im terrifyed, im going to university in september and that also scares me almost to death.  Im frightened of losing control.  Im not arsed what people think of me, never have been who gives a toss?  Im whats important!  I'LL BE BACK! :)

      i was on leave last week, which was nice, this was my first week back and although the week didnt take long to end its not been a very good one, with my bad smear result and an arse of a manager i had had enough!  Trust me to pick this week to cut down on my alcohol intake, good thinking batman! Any hoos, i came to the conclusion that if you just don't worry about it, it hardly exsists!  So thats what im going to do!  Don' worry be happy!
