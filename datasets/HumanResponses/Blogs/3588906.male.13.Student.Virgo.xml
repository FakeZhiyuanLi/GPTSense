        KILL ME KISS ME   Ok I was browsing through this book called "Kill Me Kiss Me" and it looked very strange I wasn't reading it but merely the artwork was enough to draw me in and make me buy it. (by the way I'm talking about manga ^^) Basically it is about two highschool identicle cousins of the opposite sex. Weird Right? well it gets weirder. The whole 1st volume is based around the female cousin Tae Im, and her obsession with model Kun Kang who happens to go to her cousin's ((Jung-Woo  Im)) school. So Tae and Jung-Woo switch places, and sexes, and go to each others schools as each other. Confusing, yes, interesting, yes, this is an awesome manga filled with romance and flirly wirly stuff. A downside to it is that you have to read the story very carefully to understand it other than that its a good book and I recomend it to everyone. If I didn't explain clearly enough ^^;; here's what it says on the back of the book.  When Tae Im finds out that her favorite idol star is currently attending the same school as her identicle cousin Jung-Woo Im, she convinces her kin to switch places--she will dress as him, attend his all-boys school and try to get close to her lover boy; he will dress as her, attend her all-girls school and revel in its sea of babes. Flawless? Well, with bullies, brats, and bishonen around, everything can go wrong.  Ok if that clarifies some things then good, Now shut-up and eat your cheese sandwhich!        NARUTO   For my next reveiw I will be reveiwing a shoen jump anime, yes the creator of Naruto made an anime series and I have it!!!! Original Japanese dialoge English and Chinese subtitle!!! and best of all... collector edition 3 disc package!!!!! bad part... $59.64 but anyway to the reveiw!  Naruto features an engaging story, memorable characters, and cool ninja action. With themes of unrequited love, alienation and acceptance, competition, and the realization of goals, its no wonder that this popular anime and manga is making it's western debut in Shonen Jump U.S and on Cartoon Network.   Long ago in Japan, there was a ninja village that was attacked by a  "Nine-Tails Fox" demon and the whole village was nearly wiped out. The Hokage or strongest man in the village, battled the demon and saved them all by sealing it within the body of a new-born child. Unfortunately, as these stories go, the hero used up all his strength, and died. Thanks to his sacrifice, the village was saved.....  12 years later that child, named Naruto Uzumaki , has become a mischievous, prank-loving student at the local ninja academy. Unfortunately, having a demon sealed inside of him has made him something of an outcast. This doesn't stop him in his dream to become the next Hokage and the strongest ninja ever. Other main characters in the story are Sasuke, Sakura, and Kakashi their teacher. Sasuke, is young noble who plans on rebuilding his clan as soon as he exacts revenge on everyone who had a hand in it's destruction. Sakura who is on the path to becoming a female ninja, has a secret crush on Sasuke. She in turn is the object of Naruto's secret affections. As ninjas-in-training,  they learn the arts of shadow, swiftness and  illusion under their teacher Kakashi.   Naruto, written by Kishimoto Masashi first appeared in Shonen Jump in 1999. Naruto features an engaging story, memorable characters, and cool ninja action. With themes of unrequited love, alienation and acceptance, competition, and the realization of goals, this story is easily identified with by today's youth. It didn't take long to became on of the more popular series in this popular Japanese manga anthology.  Due to it's popularity, it is no surprise that an anime was created for it. The anime is currently showing on Tokyo TV and Cartoon Network has secured the rights to show it in the U.S.      Ok E-mail me to vote for the next reveiw my email is on the profile.
