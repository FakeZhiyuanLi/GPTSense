      Yahoo! Cassie and I went to the Floyd Cemetery today, it was  awesome!  We often got creeped out by one thing or another, it was kinda freaky sometimes, and we took some pictures. We hope we got some ghostly pics, but, unfortunately, we will not know until the film is developed. :(   Not only did we visit pretty much  every  section of the enormous graveyard, we also got to work in the library at our old elementary school before we went ghost huntin', and we got to eat at McDonald's, and, after we left the cemetery, we went to Dairy Queen to have marshmellow-flavored malts, which were  delicious!    Well, anyway, overall, it was a pretty fun day, and at the library we read X-Men comics that Cassie brought, so we weren't bored! :)  I'll be writing again soon, and I'll probably soon have more info on the ghost pics, so if you're interested, you'll be glad to know this!   If you have any information on ghosts that isn't on castleofspirits.com, and there for I probably won't know it, then  please  feel free to contact me! Check out my profile to find out how! ;) And remember... NON-BELIEVERS GO FIRST!!! MUAHAHA!!!!!

      Wow! I just tried the  coolest  candy! Mm, mm, mm! I got it a Blockbuster! That's right! Dedicated to the latest Harry Potter movie, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, there is a new wizarding candy out, one which Harry and his friends enjoy, and is now available to Muggles! :D This candy is...   FIZZING WHIZBEES!!!   Yeah! xD I just tried a handful of them, and I highly reccomend this new treat, for not only does it taste delicious and come in several flavors, it  crackles  in your mouth!!! Keep your mouth closed, hear a muffled crackling. Then, open your mouth, and fill the world with the sound of crackling wizarding candy! It's the tastiest, loudest, coolest treat you'll find! ;)

      Okay, my hermit crab is a  genius!  I went to TechTruck to look at laptops, then I went to Blockbuster to return some movies and get some more, and before I left, I put Hygüy, in his fish bowl, out on the patio to get some sunlight. I had him up on a little table-thing on the grill. It would be an almost three-foot drop, which for him is rather long. Well, when I returned home, I came up the sidewalk in our backyard, stopped on the patio to check on Hygüy, and found that he was on the ground, under his fish bowl.   When I placed the genius-survivor-crab back in his bowl, I found a most  genius  setup, very impressive, for a hermit crab. You see, when I said good-bye to him, only an hour or so before, he was climbing on one of the two sponges that he sometimes drinks from. He slipped off, and I found that funny. Both sponges were in the center of the bowl, on a small hill in the sand that was made when he dug a hole by the side to lie in.   The setup that Hygüy had "innocently" created was this:  The two sponges were up against one side of the bowl, and a shell that was a spare (incase he needed to switch shells) was in the area that he dug out. He also has a little drinking bowl, besides the sponges, and it was on its side, the water poured out, and it was up against the side of the bowl, along with the shell. This setup I found was a sign that a stroke of genius resides in my crab. He is truly Hygüy... the Smartest Hermit Crab Ever!!!

      Hey, there! Me 'n Cassie are gonna go ghost huntin' tomorrow. :) It will be fun, and we are visiting the First Bride's Grave, along with two other cemetaries in Sioux City. xD It's gonna ROCK!You see, we found this cool website with cool ghost pics! It just may prove something to you non-believers. You can click  urlLink here  to view the site, there are some stranges pictures on it, particularly these two, which seem a bit unnerving:   urlLink Hampton Court Ghost    urlLink Willard's Children's Library   You may agree that these photographs could seem... oh... I don't know...  BELIEVABLE!  So, if, even after seeing this proof, you do not think that there are spirits dwelling even in our very homes, then I have nothing to say to you. But, if we develop some awesome ghostly pics, I'm gonna post 'em here, on my websites, and try to on castleofspirits.com as well.   Hehe... Just keep in mind! Non-believers go first! MUAHAHA!
