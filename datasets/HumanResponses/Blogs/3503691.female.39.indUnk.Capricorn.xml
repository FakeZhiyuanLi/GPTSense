      I have always had a love for antiques and have been collecting them for years. Whether it is an old piece of pottery, a tattered worn apron, or an old piece of furniture, it's for me.  When my daughter was born, I decided to be a stay at home mom.  My interest in antiques quickly turned into a business venture.  I began to buy antiques and sell them at flea markets and on the internet as a part time job.  I guess I caught the bug at an early age.  After my grandfather retired as a police officer, he sold antiques and used furniture at flea markets and out of his basement and garage 'store or shoppe'.  I used to go with him when he traveled around to various estate sales, garage sales or auctions.  I was young at the time and was intrigued by his ability to search for his treasures, haggle on the prices and get whatever bargains he could.  Grandpa would talk to everyone at the sales we would attend, like he knew them for years.  Most knew him by name like they were old friends. I guess negotiating a price, whenever he was buying or selling, seemed to open the door to conversation.  This I like to refer to as 'chit chat'.  I think that was the part he loved the most.  It certainly was not the huge profit he was looking to make, but was the opportunity to 'chit chat' with people.  His gift was passed along to me.  Not only did I inherit his enthusiasm for antiques and collecting, the art of negotiation, and the eagerness to sell, but I also inherited his gift to 'chit chat'.  A lot has changed since my grandfather was in the business of buying and selling.  But the interaction with people and doing something you love still remains the same.  He would 'chit chat' while selling at the local flea market.  Thirty years later, I can work from home and sell on the internet, or set up at the flea market and 'chit chat' just like he did.  Like my grandfather, I travel around to local sales searching for my treasures to sell.  At most sales, I do find I get caught up 'chit chatting' for quite a while. I laugh sometimes because there are days I get nothing accomplished except perfecting my socialization skills and work on my gift of 'chit chatting'.  I hope, that in addition to my passion for antiques and collecting, that my gift of 'chit chat' gets passed along to my daughter.  Just as I did years ago, she watches me at the sales. She has an eye for what I like to buy, even picking out items I may have missed. She watches while I negotiate a price and, at the age of 9, she too has learned to do the same.    When we are at the sales together, many people say hello to me.  I remember the faces, as we have met and 'chit chatted' at one time.  My daughter will ask me if I know them, and I admit that I actually don't.  It just seems like 'chit chatting' opens up a whole new world of friends and acquaintances.  She will understand in time.  Funny, because it reminds me of the outings with my grandfather and all the people who I thought knew him as well.  My grandfather passed away before we had home computers and the internet.  He was not around to see how much everything has changed with the computer age. People are now selling antiques and collectibles in cyberspace to buyers all over the world. It is no longer limited to the local flea market.  The art of selling has certainly changed, but the gift he passed on to me, the ability to 'chit chat' has remained the same.  Like he did, I will 'chit chat' with people wherever I go.  And now, thanks to technology, I have the ability to 'chit chat' from the comfort of my home as well, on my computer in cyberspace.  He certainly would be proud.
