      I woke up when the phone rang, when I heard the voice on the other side of the phone call, I knew it was my best friend. But it wasn't Tarissa. She said that she was going to be late for work, only she didn't say it in english. I told her that was fine. "Ok, bye Kyoko," she answered. I lay in bed for a few minutes thinking about the coffee shop, that's when I realized what happened. "I don't work in a coffee shop," I told myself, "I work at the salon, I own the salon." I jolted upright. Where was I? It wasn't my room, it wasn't my apartment. I went over to the window and looked down at the street and it wasn't my town. Then my mind faded and Kyoko's  mind took over. I showered and got ready for work. I got into my Camry and drove to Hair and Nails. On the way I got into a small traffic jam and rattled my long, polished nails on the steering wheel. I got to the salon and unlocked the doors, swept the floor, shook up some bottles of nail polish and turned on the open sign. Then a woman came in, "morning Julie," she chimed brightly, "where's Nat?" "She'll be in late today, I'm guessing her date went well." I heard my voice speaking english, the language I have spoken every day of my life, I could barely understand myself through my thick, japanese accent. The woman's name was Terry, she was middle aged, a little heavy set, and had a mass of tight blonde curls sprouting from her head. Terry towered over me, she was about 5-7 or 5-8, I probably stood about 5-1 at the most. Together we got the salon ready for customers. At twenty-three past eight, the first customer came in. "Good morning Ma'am, can I help you?" She told me what kind of hair cut she wanted and I took her to my station. I saw my beautician's license mounted on the wall above a picture of an asian woman holding sushi with chopsticks and smiling at the camera, she was my best friend. I had the customer sit down, I put the cloth over her clothes and picked up the scissors, then I froze. I didn't know how to cut hair, give me coffee beans and I'll make you a latte, but hair? No, that wasn't my division. I stared down at the woman's head holding the scissors in my left hand. I thought for a moment and transferred the scissors to my right hand and snipped the air. It was difficult, it didn't feel right. I moved the scissors back to my left hand and it felt natural. I picked up the spray bottle, combed her hair with my right hand, and then started cutting with my left hand. Just another day at the shop. Cutting hair, doing nails, this was my life.  During my lunch break I went back to being Carly again. I had gone to a restaurant and ordered miso soup. I sipped it, and spat it out again. "What was I thinking ordering this? I hate miso soup", I thought. But I didn't hate miso soup, it was my favorite thing to eat. Who was I, I wasn't myself. I picked out my brain, my name was Kyoko Yammamoto. But then why did Terry call me Julie? That was my American name, it was easier for people to pronounce. The woman in the picture with the sushi, my best friend, Takako, we came to the States together five years ago. It was a weird dream, it had to be, My name was Carly Morgan, my best friend was Tarissa. I had always lived in the U.S.  I took a deep breath, then another one, and another. I was having a panic attack

      "Who am I?" A question asked by many, yet answered by few. As for me, I don't really know any more. At one point, my name was Carly Morgan, until I was 22 years old. I had just finished junior college and was planning on transferring to a university. I was the manager of the local coffee shop and the owner was planning to sell the business to me once I got my bachelors degree in business. I was rooming with my best friend since 3rd grade, Tarissa Florman, we were trying to get used to the fact that I was moving to a dorm 200 miles away. I still miss her so much. My boyfriend at the time, or should I say  ex -boyfriend, wasKelvin Mitchell. He decided to end our 1 1/2 year relationship a week before it happened, said that he couldn't 'handle the whole long distance thing'. Tarissa and Kelvin were my closest relations, we had our group that we ran with on Saturday nights, but I didn't really  know  any of them. I left home when I was 19, and haven't talked to my parents since. They were fighting a lot and on the verge of the big 'D' word, I decided that I couldn't handle it and moved in with Tarissa. Tarissa and I stayed up all night talking for the first week we lived together, a slumber party every night. Then we matured, we developed our routine, our group of friends, our lives together. On Monday and Wednesday I would prepare breakfast for us, my classes didn't start until 10 a.m. and the assistant manager did a pretty good job at the coffee shop until I arrived at 3 p.m. and Tarissa had to be out the door by 8 to get to her job as a receptionist. On Tuesday and Thursday mornings, Tarissa would whip together something for me, I had a morning class at 7 a.m. We both had Friday mornings off and would cook together. We both loved cooking so much, and loved home made food. So our apartement almost never contained any pre-packaged food. And it was always cheaper for us to cook from scratch. Most of the time our rent money was tight, Tarissa worked weekends and good pay her share usually, but I worked part-time and needed to pay for school (Tarissa decided that college wasn't for her). But after I got a student loan everything was fine. My life was clockwork, I was going to college with a full scholarship, I would move back to the same neighborhood after I finished school, and then I would own, and probably still manage the coffee shop. Then Kelvin broke the news to me, I didn't grieve at all, instead I went along in a sort of trance, just doing what needed to be done.  Then it happened, I woke up and I was not myself. I woke up in someone else's bed, in someone else's body. I knew who I was by instinct, but I could also remember my life as Carly. Though I was severly confused, I was able to get through the day okay, living someone else's life. Since then, I have lived a different life nearly every day. A few times I stayed in one body for a week or so, but that's it. Through all of this, I can barely remember that girl I once was, Carly Morgan is a stranger to me now. I've always wondered if everyone's life is like mine, switching constantly. Sometimes I believe it's true, but that I am special, in the fact that I remember who I once was. I used to wonder if every life I lived had a purpose, if I was completing a task for someone, like in a weird sci-fi show. I can remember the people I have been, bits and fragments of their lives are carried with me. With every day I only told one person what happened, and I knew from the moment the words came to my mouth that it was a mistake. I risked it, and it wasn't a good idea. I just had a feeling that this was my own thing, I couldn't share the burden. So I just went on, like I did after Kelvin. Until it started getting really weird, the lives of the people I was started to intertwine, and then they started to intertwine with Carly.
