      I am so fucking bored.  You would think that since it is summer that I wouldn't be bored. HA yea right.  But I have to work tonight... good stuff huh.   Anyone who lives in E-Ville... or anywhere somewhat close needs to go to the PIPEDOWN show on Monday May 31, 2004.  It is going to be badass!  It is at 1123 1st Ave, $5, 7:00.  So you all better fucking be there. Or else!!!  :-)

      I give up on people.  Every now and then you begin to actually believe that there is some goodness and not so much stupidity in people.  But, then there is always that dumbass who proves you wrong.  I am not going to mention his name...  if he ever reads this, you know who you are and don't even think of fucking talking to me for a while. Anyways.... on to a better note.  I hung out with one of my buddies from work a couple of nights ago, which was awesome.  But, hey its all good right?   I am attempting to find a lot of hours at work.. so you will be seeing me at Target a lot lately.  I am trying to pull off 35 hours a week.  Probably not going to happen.. but its worth a try.  I am actually going to attempt to close tomorrow night.  Which is all good, cause the closing manager is Art, and he is awesome.  But, I am off today... so woohoo. Have you ever noticed that right before school gets out, you are always so excited and then summer hits and you are bored out, of your fucking minds.  I do.  I am bored right now. Until I feel like rambling again... later

      Well.... school is almost out and I am already bored out of my mind.  The only thing that I have to look foreword to is going to South Carolina.  Woo hoo.  Working a lot, that is the only thing I really have to keep me somewhat busy anymore.  Work makes the time go by and keep ones mind off of things. I am pretty much giving up on Mike.  If he wants to talk to me fine, if not thats cool too.  I am not going to wait around for it.   Going to hang out with Nick for a little bit before we have to go to work today...   Shear and complete boredom... wow how the time flies.

      People really annoy me lately.  Especially the stupid ones, sometimes I wonder if some people have the brain capasity of a peanut or even a brain at all.  Certain people should not be allowed to reproduce.  The government should make everyone take a "stupid test" to see wether or not they are allowed to reproduce or even go outside.  That way there would be less stupid people in the world.  But, idiots do come in handy sometimes.  For instance, if you are told to do a bitch job usually you can con an idiot into doing it for you.  That and idiots make everyone else look smarter.  Fun stuff, ehh?

      Yea, I totally kicked ass playing Halo with my buddy Bo tonight.  Not really, actually I usually was the reason that we all died.  Opps, at least we got through like 3 or 4 levels. :-) I am confused, I think that Mike likes me but I am not all sure.  I am such an idiot though... so, I don't know.  He just never seems like he wants to see me.  It may just be because of finals or because school is getting out.  I don't know, but I would like to know where this is going.  Cause right now I am soo friggin (haha I said friggin) confused.  We flirt constintly (spelling) and we have kissed and stuff, but he is always doing something to where he has to leave early or whatnot.  I think that I just got unlucky cause last weekend he had some family in town that he hasn't seen in like forever and this week is finals.  So, maybe everything will get better soon.  At least I hope.

      Well, having poison oak really really sucks.  I got it about a week ago when I was at Wesselman's Park.  I should really learn to watch where I am going to sit down, when I am going to sit down under a tree in the woods.  Cause yea, you can get poison oak that way.  It wasn't that bad... but then 2-3 days ago, I got it in the corner of my eye near my nose.. and then I woke up on Sunday and  my throat and eye were swollen.  Fun stuff... now the oak is in my eye and throat.  Fun Fun Fun Times.  I stole a saying from my buddy... he always says "good stuff" or "good times" or just stuff like that.  Now, I am saying it, ahhhhh!  :-) Oh well

      Us kids went to Arby's tonight.  I swear.. its either Target, GD Ritzy's, or Arby's now-a-days.  Man, we are expanding.  Awesome huh?  3 more days till SC.  Ya'll are gonna miss me aren't ya?  Of course you are.  Jessica, Todd, and Robby said that Target will just not be the same without me for a week.  It makes her sad.. I will be without my Jessica....:*-(.  Tear...  Robby still owes me a back massage.  Actually a neck massage, cause if he were to touch my back.. it will hurt a lot.  I am sunburnt.  Chared, very red.  In a lot of pain at the moment.  Jessica and I are so funny together.. I bring out the little munchkin in her.  And that scares the crap out of Robby and Todd I think.  Oh well...life is good right now.  Just waiting for that massage.... :-)

      Today is a good day!  Even though I have to work from 1-8:30.  But other than that... it is a good day.   I was at Chris' house last night (my mom's bf) and Haley and I were hanging out... for 13 she is pretty hilarious.   My buddy Brian and I also hung out some last night.  We drove around and then went to Garvin park and sat there for a while.  Talked... good good times.  I work with him at Target and he just graduated from Reitz this year.. lucky little devil.  I want to graduate and go to college.  I want to go to IU right now! Ashley and I are gonna be room mates.  It's gonna be great.  We are gonna have a blast there.  O.. and we get to shop for stuff for the room.  Good stuff.  More reason for me to spend money. Finally got the Alanis Morissette "Jagged Little Pill" CD from someone to archive to my computer.  So, that is kickass.  I used to have the CD, but somehow I ended up losing it.  It is an awesome CD.  I got Enya's Greatest Hits "Paint The Sky With Stars" CD to also archive to my computer.  I know I know.. its Enya... but she is really soothing.  And during a stressful day where you want to hit everything... somehow she helps.   Well.. off to get ready for work.

      I know what you all need!  An update!  On what you may ask... those two lovely questions that it took me so long to get Nick to answer.  1. Why he didn't want his friend Chelsea talking to me. His answer---- She is his friend, and that us talking creeps him out.  2. Why couldn't he just tell me about Sara instead of hiding it and leading me on. His answer---- He told me the next day because it had happened that night.  Right  after he got off work at 8:00 I suppose.  Or at least sometime in between him getting off work and then coming to my house later on that night.  Oh well.. guys will be guys I suppose.  Still confuses me but oh well.  Well, Nick if you read this.  I am not really tooo pissed off anymore.  I just wish you would have told me that night about Sara.  Fair enough right?   Well.. off to Ashley's...

      Well I just got back from Target 15 minutes ago.  I ended up closing, they needed the help so I offered to stay.  Which is totally cool and all.  Jessica and I hung out after work and went to McDonald's for some food.  The lady was soo nice, she gave us free Happy Meal NeoPets!  Rock on!  Mine is a cute little green frog looking thing.  He is awesome.  So we hung out in the parking lot and ate out food till around 10 till midnight.  And now I am here.  Aren't you all lucky!  Haha, just kidding! Oh yea, Nick has yet to IM me, post or even call me to tell me 1. why he doesn't want Chelsea talking to me, and 2. why he just couldn't tell me about Sara and lead me on like he did... I will let you all know how the update is going later.  Right now, sleepy time with my new little froggy.

      Well, I am sitting here ready to go to work an hour early.  Yea I know what you are thinking... I have no life or I am just extremely bored. Nick won't tell me why he doesn't want his friend, Chelsea, talking to me.  He has no right to tell her if she can or can't.  And plus she seems pretty cool.  I am still waiting on his response to that and my lovely little comment on my previous post.  I don't know if he has read it or not though.  It would be such a shame if he doesn't.  Because then he wouldn't know how pissed off and hurt that I am.  Well, actually more pissed off now rather than hurt.  And Chelsea is right... a little ice cream solves everything... aren't I glad that Target has just that.  ICE CREAM!! Well next Friday I am leaving for South Carolina and I cannot wait.  No more bullshit from anyone around here and having to deal with shit.  I can go on the beach, check out some hot guys, and forget about all of my troubles back here in Indiana.  Well.. at least for a week anyways.  And hopefully whenever I get back everything will turn out for the better. Talked to Mike Hassel last night.. he finally got a job.  About damn time too.  I am proud of him.  At least his life is going pretty good. Well, Ashley should be extremely happy with me.  I am hopefully going to IU when I get out of Central.  I have made my decision.  I am ready to get out of this damn town.  Ashley and I can go to IU and forget about all of the shit and our troubles back here in Evansville.  So, Ashley aren't you happy!!  Woohoo!!  Now we just need to get Tommy up there with us and everything will be set.  Gee college is just around the corner.  Along with my ACT's coming up on Saturday.  You know that will be fun.. tons....

      I am sorry if I made you mad tonight.  And I am sorry if I got you into trouble.  And I wasn't mad at you for your decision, even though it appeared that way whenever I walked back to my house from your car and closed the garage really quick and went into the house without looking back.  I was just about to ball my eyes out and I didn't want you to see me like that.  I understand your decision, I may not like it but I understand it.  I just really want to give things a second try.  You never know, I may be just what you need to help sort out your life.  And tonight, whenever you were talking to me... when I was laying there with my back turned.  It was because I was thinking about what you had just told me, it hurt, and I was trying to sort things out in my head and figure out the next thing that I was going to say to you while trying to not ball my eyes out.  Nick, I want you back so badly.  I don't think that you even realize.  I don't know if you know how much I care about you and how much I want to help you.  I know that things were shaky in the past, I know that you are scared, and I am too.  But, I want to take a chance.  I am willing to take a chance.  And I hope that you are willing to take one on me too. Tonight, I said something that I didn't mean that probably hurt you.  I said that "you know how strong my feelings are for you.  And you told me that you still have feeling for me... but I don't know if you actually do or not."  I am sorry for saying that.  It was out of line and I shouldn't have said it.  I know that you have feelings for me because I can tell that whenever I look into your eyes and when we talk. I know that this is a confusing time in your life... I just wish that there was some way that I could just take all of your confusion and pain away from you.  If there was I way, I would... I would take all of your pain and make it mine.  I would do anything for you in the past and that is still true today. I am taking a big chance by telling you all of this.  I do not know if you will be upset, angry, or what your feeling might be.  But I had to get some things off of my chest.  I want to tell you so many things in person, but my mind goes blank because of how much is running through it. Nick, you mean the world to me and so much more.  Please, let me explain myself to you later on today before you go to class at 10:00.  I will call you whenever I get up, cause I want to talk to you. I hope you have a goodnight's sleep, and have sweet dreams.  You deserve it.

      Well, guess who hasn't called me like he said he would.  If you guessed Nick... bingo!  You win 1,000,000 dollars.  Haha, just kidding.  Sorry.. I got your hopes up didn't I.  So..sorry.  He is actually talking to his brother about something right now that is pretty important so he can take all the time he needs with that.  I just hope he calls though.  Him and I need to finish talking about things.   Blah.... Life.. work, eat, sleep..well never really sleep, then work.  Fun stuff and good times right?

      Well today was a fun day!  And it is only 6:00!  We all went to Steak and Shake today.  Well, Squeaky didn't come... that dork.  I am sorry Sarah, your fiancee didn't show :-P, but Jessica's did.  Todd is whipped.  He just doesn't know it yet.  And they are all running off to Vegas soon to get married.. and I am gonna be a witness.  So woohoo for me!!!  Todd didn't show up for a while... but after we called him and told him that his fiancee was getting irritable that he needed to get his little butt over here.  And you know what... he did.  WOW, he is a good guy.  After that Robby and I stayed for a little while and talked some.. and then we both ended up going to Auto Zone and he got some adhesive for his rear-view mirror that kinda fell off. So I didn't get home till around 6:00 and I left at 1:45 and I only went to Steak and Shake and Auto Zone... good good times.  If you ever go to Steak and Shake get the Frisco Melt.... very very yummy.  And always remember that you can use sour gummy worms to catch the sour gummy fish that TARGET sells... haha, good times, good jokes.  Cause you know that us Target people are awesome and CRAAAAZY!  Haha.  Well, I am off to Subway to get Nick some food cause I am a nice person like that!

      Well well, once again waiting on Nick to call.  Supposed to at like 10:30, 11-ish.  It is now past that.  Oh well, he went bike-riding tonight to clear his head.  He has had a stressful week.  He just needs to learn to answer his cell phone every now and then.  :-)   Ahhhhhhh, I have tomorrow off!  Woohoo.  I just may work anyways.. wow, thats pethetic.  A bunch of us are going to lunch tomorrow, probably at Steak and Shake.  Yummmy.  It is me, Jessica, Squeaky, Todd, and maybe Robby.  I know that Squeaky is a weird name, but that is what I call him.. cause one day he put a "I Squeak" sticker on his nametag from the pets isle and a "1/2 ton of yanking fun" sticker on... so now I call Michael "Squeaky".  Good stuff huh.   Since I am rambling on and all....

      Well, its Monday morning.  Haven't really looked outside yet though... but most likely or at least hopefully it will be a pretty Monday with NO RAIN.  Pretty much all last week it rained and we had storms.  Which really sucked.  I really need to get ready to go to work today and get a shower.  But I am gonna postpone (spelling) that until a little bit later.   At least I got a little bit of extra sleep today.  I slept 10 hours... which is a good thing cause I really needed it.  Yesterday getting off of work I was so tired.  Maybe it was because I worked a 9 hour shift and then an 8 hour shift within two days at Food Ave, I know that those shifts are really easy but Food can get extremely boring and tiring.  My friend that I work with, Jessica, and I scared the crap out of one of the newer guys that works there.  His name is Robert and he is pretty cool though.. if he wasn't so quiet.  But he is only going to be there for like 2 months anyways cause then he is going back up to school at Ball State.  But Jess and I are trying to get him to go and see "The Passion" at the two dollar movie theatre with us on Tuesday.  Cause we are all actually off on Tuesday.  Which is strange cause Jessica snd I usually work a lot lately.  We both have this thing where if we don't work, we ask if we can come in cause of how bored we are and that we really don't wanna be at home with the parents.   Man I really wish that I was going to college now.  I am senior and all... but, I would rather be in college.  The good thing about IU is that there is a Target in Bloomington, which totally kicks ass.  And, I can come home and work at our Target whenever I am on Christmas break, Spring Break, and during the summer.  I really liked IU's campus.  It was sooo nice.  I know that leaving all of my friends is gonna be hard though.  The majority of all of my friends are staying in Evansville and going to USI, but Ashley is going to IU and she really really wants me to go.  I don't think that my mom does though...  I think that she would rather me stay here and live at home.  But I am not gonna live here forever... so, yea.  And plus, it is only a 2.5 hour drive to Bloomington and Ashley and I can take turns driving home on the weekends and during breaks and stuff.  So I think that that would be awesome. Well, I have rambled on enough here... so...

      Yea Nick hasn't called and he said he would today right when he got off of work.  Which would have been 8 or 8:30...  and now it is 12:11, so I am doubting that he is going to call.  :-(  Which sucks cause I really wanted to hang out tonight with him.  But I guess this means that I get to go to bed a little earlier than normal tonight.  Cause I need to catch up on some sleep and make my headache go away.  I have had one all night.  Errrrrrrr.  I have to work tomorrow... cashier for once, wow.  2:30-6:00, no break.. not even worth my time to come in at all.  O well.  Well... maybe I will get to talk to Nick tomorrow.  Who knows.

      Well I couldn't get blogger to work for me for a while.. but apparently it is working now.  So yea.  Woohoo for me.. sigh.   Have to work today.... 12:30-8:30 in Food Avenue.... ah!  I hate food ave. and that is the only thing that they are scheduling me as anymore.  Wait, I am a cashier tomorrow for three and a half hours.  Big woppie.  Then I work Wed, Thurs, Fri, Sun, Mon, Tues, Wed. and then vacation!!!!  Going to South Carolina for like 6 days.  So that should be awesome. Nick, Ashley, and her bf Tommy were over here last night.  Tommy cooked... he is such a good cook and we watched some movies.  After Tommy and Ashley left, Nick and I hung out for a while.  We used to date last year for like 6 or 7 months and it had appeared last night that we were going to start up again.  Which would be awesome... cause I like him a lot.  But, he wants us to start out as friends and then build up to a relationship.  Which totally makes sense, cause that was probably what screwed us up in the last relationship.  I am just scared that I am going to be "hung out to dry" as you might say.  All of my past relationships after Nick's were... we would go and hang out, kiss, and it would appear that they really liked me.  They all led me on.  Which blows, but hey thats life.  And it always ended with, well.. "I don't want a relationship right now" or "I am too busy".  Yea, you weren't too busy when you were over here the past four or five days.  Errrrrrrrrrr.  I just really don't want that to happen with Nick.  And he is scared too... I do know that.  So, I will wait for him.  He means the world to me and I would do anything for him.  And Nick, if you are reading this I hope that you realize how much you mean to me.  And we will do the friendship thing, I know that it will be hard for both of us... but I also believe that it will be good for us. And you better not forget to give me a call whenever you get off tonight!  :-)

      Yea I was looking through one of my old notebooks from school and I found a bunch of poetry that I had forgotten that I had written. What blew my mind was how EMO I was sounding.  It is some pretty depressing stuff... well, see for yourself.  "Ready to Die" sitting here alone away from all things real looking for a way trying to deal fuck it all all odds are against me why the fuck can't you all see can't get these thoughts out of my head why can't I  just be dead why delay the enivitable is here only to wish to completely disappear alone in the world no one seems to care to walk right past you they wouldn't even dare an invisible image clear to the eye to already be invisible ready to die  (Samantha Embry 5/7/04)   This one isn't as emo....  "Only to Dance" looking at your eyes an image to unclear needing you, wanting you to only be so dear an invisible image you cannot portray a feeling so deep only to say why can't you see whats right in front of you a thing so special for you to only throw away to hateful world so full of strife what all we get is just one life why can't you  just take a change just get over yourself one only to dance  (Samantha Embry 5/9/04)

      I wanted to apologize to Aaron because I told him that me and some of my friends were coming to indy on friday and were going to stop by his house.  Aaron I am sorry.  We didn't end up leaving end up leaving until later that day and Ashley and I both had to be back early cause she has SAT's and I had to be at work at 7:30 in the morning.  I didn't have any way of calling or getting ahold of you to tell you that we were only going to Bloomingon because of time.... so I am sorry.  I am sorry for making you wait at your house when you thought that we were coming.  Forgive me?

I was randomly searching through Blogger trying to find my buddies blog, and I found this guy's from Indianapolis' blog.  Which is really cool come to find out.  Well... I finally got the guts to speak to him, his name is Aaron by the way.  And he is pretty cool and we seem to have some stuff in common.  Which is awesome!!! Well... onto mess with the computer some more...

My dad is back in town, which totally kicks ass.&nbsp; I can't wait to see him.&nbsp; The best thing is, is that I told him that I wanted a tattoo.. and he thinks that that is awesome.&nbsp; So.. maybe I can get him to co-sign on one for me.&nbsp; Hopefully.. :-).&nbsp;  I really miss talking to Aaron, I haven't talked to you in a while... I am sorry.&nbsp; But I do need to talk to you sometime soon.&nbsp; You have this way of making all my problems go away, which is good considering you are 4 hours away.&nbsp; Oh good news!!&nbsp; I am going to IU next year!!!&nbsp;
