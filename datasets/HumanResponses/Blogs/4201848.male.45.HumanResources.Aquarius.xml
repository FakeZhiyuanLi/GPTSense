      OK, sorry for abandoning all of you out there wondering hOWL in the hell I'm going to work nights when: a. I don't really want to work nights. b. My life happens when the lights are on. c. I don't want to work nights.  I can sympathize with you because I feel the same way. When life (your job) demands a nocturnal existence you have to adapt. Thus, these suggestions that have worked for me:  a. If you have a night shift coming up, the evening before on your last day off, go to bed at your usual time, maybe a little later and sleep for 1 to 3 hours. Get up, drink coffee and or tea and stay up for 6 or more hours. Go back to bed and sleep for 6 or more hours. When you get up you are more or less ready to stay up all night.  b. When you go to sleep in the am. for your daylight sleep think about doing the following:   Take Melatonin and or Valerian before you hit the bed. Melatonin 2 mg. to 6 mg. (for adults) depending on your sensitivity, is a natural hormone produced in your pineal gland that influences your daily rhythm's and sleep cycle. That is, it makes you drowsy. It is also an antioxidant (good for you) and most people find it has no side affects. You can get it at most grocery stores and vitamin shops. Read the instructions. Valerian is an herb that has been used for centuries to help folks get drowsy before bed. It comes in 400-500 mg. capsules and I find it more sedating that Melatonin. BTW, it stinks. It has a funky odor but once it is down the hatch it is very helpful in smoothing out the melon so it can sleep. As in all vitamins and herbs or medicines, read the instructions.  Use heavy curtains or shades over your bedroom windows so very little light gets in your sleeping area. Light has a way of waking you up more easily during the daytime than darkness. It also interferes with time shifting which is predicated on fooling your body into thinking it is sleeping at night.   More on this later. What did you expect, a 15 page term paper? =B^o

       OK, what is time shifting? It is the key to transition from the world of the day walkers to the night life and back again. You would think I would tell you about it now but truth is, its time for me to become unconscious.       Pardon the tease, it is not intentional. I will be back with some suggestions that do work.   In the mean time think and read up on Melatonin and I'll be back with my time proven technique to alter your waking and sleeping rhythms.
