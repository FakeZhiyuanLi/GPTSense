       Date: 19 June 2004 Location: At home staring at the com. Status: Bored Re: Myself   Hmm...first time writing a blog here..so i guess its pretty obvious to write about myself first. Im a pretty easy-going guy who loves to live life simple n enjoy it to the fullest. Basically, my life revolves round 7 things...Basketball, Music, Friends, Food, Studies, family and sleep...so yeap...Im a boring guy..lolX..I love hanging out with friends and play a good game of basketball. Im currently studying in Pioneer Junior College now and Im in the school's basketball team(sort of...) I also play for an outside team...which is T-net club@Bukit Merah...hmm... I pretty much suck at basketball and I yearn to be a forward...but sadly...my height does not allow me to do so(hey...Im 183cm ok...) so u guess it...Im a friggin center. My greastest dream right now is to defeat St. Andrew JC and Hwa Chong JC basketball team and get into top 4 in Singapore...if possible...i also wish to play for Xue Lian Red(Combined Schools) some people say Im crazy but hey...its a dream right? My ambition is to be a biologist or an entomologist or a NBA superstar when I grow up. My lucky number is 13 and its sooo sacred to me...why? Because when I first join a team..they gave me 13..also..my ex-coach used to wear his no.13 Gan Eng Seng jersey and taught me proper basketball...so yeah...no.13 rocks...its evident because almost all of my jerseys are no.13 and nothing else..hehe..So i guess thats about it for now...          -=]CHAN TU YUAN[=-

My mind was on my team, and sorry, not you Miss Lim. Bleah, I won't even apologise, my dear CT.  You just don't cut it.&nbsp;  I wandered back all the way to January. First came Smokey who's with me since the begining. Underrated, humble and dark like ink Somehow i believe, he's destined to be our PG.  Then came the Camel from Red Hill Constituency He jumps 50 yet he still can't "eat" Haix...he's hardworking,  But on his mind there's just Iris.  Next is Lai Hui, that left handed monkey. Spins and dribbles past you ever so brilliantly It's no wonder he leaves you pondering what he just did.  Ice Man is up next on the list. His darn freezing lame jokes just leave you laughing in your sleep. There's also something special about him; when he drives down center, the defence just splits.&nbsp;  Then there's this monk who's communist. Post up moves aside, he hates running And yes, he keeps rambling about a girl in my class who's in rugby.  Push is another one, who knows every girl in PJC He likes almost every girl; Indian, Malay, Chinese--just name it Chien Fern, Michelle and a whole long list-now look! Again he's at it!  Shirong is another lamer king in making. Chiobus, horny jokes-well...his mind is nowhere clean. Sometimes i just wonder why i always go home with him.  Darren's another confused kid. Can't differentiate between ice longan and longan ice is saddening. With a jersey no. (69) like this, you can't help wondering what he's thinking.  Last but not least, is ultraman me. 'Cause of me, I've got SAJC laughing themselves silly. But I'm working darn hard on rebounding and they better make sure they mark me >:  And thus it's formed, the Fellowship of Misfits. No skills, no talent, just strong bonding and a dream. Just dreaming of winning the other JCs&nbsp; Obstacles won't stop us from making our way to the rim.  But please lar all of you, dream won't materialise if you all don't do gym! All fail pull-ups and that's really weak. You have one shot writing your destiny and let's not have regrets to keep.&nbsp;  At the end of all things, so what if we didn't reign? At least these years, we stick through thick and thin.  -=]CHAN TU YUAN[=-

It's so complicated...very vexing...I wanted so much to just tell her how I feel...but I keep hesitating...past experiences have taught me that when I confess to someone that I like her...most probably that girl would avoid me for the rest of my life...haix....don't know what to do sia...my friends keep telling me to confess to her...of course I would like her to know...but I have to think of the consequences as well...I don't want to lose her as a friend as well...haix...feeling so lonely...everytime try to blend in with the crowd...make alot of friends...but in the end...still realise that I'm a loner...no matter how many friends I have or how humourous I am...ultimately it's all for show only...ultimately...deep down inside...I'm just an empty shell...feeling down and out...this kind of feeling just sucks to the core...  -=]CHAN TU YUAN[=-

But my table was occupied with my team mates...so nevermind lar..talk talk first...felt very awkward to sit with her at first...so I sat with my team mates instead...end up devising a plan to sit there...lolx...went to her table...and ask questions about maths...from there...slowly start to stick to that table liao...whahaha...I'm a genius...heehee...studied SO MUCH today...so productive...but I doubt I can pass the maths test tomorrow...still got quite some doubts not cleared yet...haix...what to do sia...talked a lot together...and time flew real fast today...soon it was 9pm and Mr Chia was chasing everyone out of the canteen...walked out of school together...but her friend was tagging along...GRRR....wanted to send her home at first but chickened out in the last minute...end up regretting on the bus...haix..I'm such a wuss...reach home already 10++pm liao...still got so much to study...oh my god...headache man...SMS her to ask if she wanna go and watch the fireworks with me on Sunday...BUT...she said she don't want...SAD MAN...feel like shit now...damn...sob sob...looks like I'm going to be rotting at home on Sunday again..sad sad sad...oh ya...before I forget..heard from Matthew that next Tuesday we having friendy with the teachers...thought that it was a joke but it seems like the 'joke' is true...don't know what to expect from them..haix...but one thing's for sure....it's gonna be friggin' fun...haha...  -=]CHAN TU YUAN[=-

      Date: 12 August 2004 Time: 10.50pm Location: Singapore Status: Sad Re: 35-42  Today had the testimonial match...a complete letdown...I'm such a loser...played for 1 whole quarter without scoring, grabbing rebounds, playing shutdown-D...I just SUCK....The first quarter was already a major setback for us...Francis was scoring at will...Wei Jie was also dominating the boards...wondered what the heck I was doing...to think I had the BALLS to say that I will reject Francis...ARGGHHH...during second quarter..the J2s replaced their main players with some guys I totally never see before one...but I was already being the bench boy liao...after much struggling...we managed to lead by a couple of points...but slowly that lead dwindled down to a one point deficit...in came Wei Jie and Francis and the game is tied easily...next was complete slaughter...rejuvenised after overcoming a deficit to tie the game from behind...things took on a different thing after that...we were losing...I was so so sad...we were the jokers of the basketball club..leading during the second and third quarter...after that lost....haix...this is definately one of the worst performance I ever put up...to think there were so many people cheering for us...I feel that I'm such a letdown...even Yuyi and Joscelin came down...but...I'm such a disgrace...disappointed...I really don't know what to do now...on my way home...nearly broke out in tears in the taxi....tried my best to hold back my tears...I really don't know what to do now...I'm not blessed with anything except for my DAMN height...although coach said I played rather well today...I knew he was consoling me only...that made me want to cry more...tomorrow is the maths teat for differentiation...but look at me now...do you guys really think I have the damn mood to study? Some people might say its just a testimonial match...but I think I really put in a lot of effort in preparing for this match and I dare say I put in my 100% in this game...so my past few months of shooting practices are for nothing...because in the end...I don't even have the chance to use it...if there's a hole in the ground...most probably I'll bury my head in the ground like an ostrich...haix...so what's the final score? 35-42...we lost by 7 points...from leading to losing...haix...I also don't know what to say now...  -=]CHAN TU YUAN[=-

I don't want to be called a loser man..I wanna win tomorrow...I don't care if the J2s have Wei Jie or Francis...I want to win...tomorrow is th day where I unleash my full fury and might on them...I hope....hur hur...oh ya...finally dared to SMS her to study together...hope she agrees...heehee...maybe I might ask her out this Saturday to watch the fireworks at the Esplanade...ohh...she just loves fireworks...so pretty...enough of my crapping now...feeling so tired...  -=]CHAN TU YUAN[=-

'Ohh...we were waiting for Shirong so we played pool lor...then Shirong came..continued playing...lost track of the time...darn...eventually reached the place at around 7.30pm...Mr Tan was already there waiting for us...so we started eating...so fun...first outing with my team mates...as usual...we laughed more than we ate....with jokers such as Jinhong and Shirong around...it's hard not to laugh...while eatind discovered some secrets about my team mates...for example...Benedict LOVES eating fishballs...so much so that he alone finished a few plates of fishballs...next is Edmund...he kept hogging those fried chicken wings...I think he finished a few plates of those chicken wings...scary right? As for the drinks..Mr Tan treated all of us..oww...so generous...haha....and did you guys know that Mr Tan is a pro in pool...all of us couldn't believe our eyes...he is so amazing...but as Shirong would put it...it's 'very obvious'..he said that Mr Tan is a physics teacher..therefore he understood the principles of law of reflection, law of refraction, relative velocity, momentum, angle and amount of energy required, blah blah blah...crappy but funny...even Mr Tan also say he BTH Shirong...lameness number 1...HAHA...some of them left first...end up me and a few other guys continue playing pool...played until very late...in the middle of nght...took a taxi home...spent so much moneythat day...oh man...learnt from Mr Tan that our testimonial match with the J2s will be on this thursday...so fast sia...feel that I'm so unprepared for it...I'm still in my shooting slump...and I can't shake off the phobia of landing on someone's shoes and spraining my ankle badly...damn...Godbless me man...hopefully on that day...I can shake off all my fears and break out of my shooting slump and show to them that we are no pushovers...and we CERTAINLY arre not failures...  -=]CHAN TU YUAN[=-
