      I am really goin' crazy here. I worked a big chunk of the weekend to resurrect the Web site and had hoped to have it back to normal by today, but I can now see it could take years, as it took years to build the original site.  I appreciate those of you who have written to let me know of your empathy. Your patience and support means a lot. I'll chip away at the site bit by bit and eventually, all the pictures and stuff will be there. If you have a link to suggest for any or several of the pages, write to me at  urlLink stuckinthe70s@yahoo.com , and I'll see to it that it gets put up quickly. Rather than try to figure out what all I had on those pages in the first place, I'm going to go to my e-mail and use your suggestions of what you'd like to see on the site, and upload that first. So, now's your chance to help me build back Stuck in the '70s the way you want to see it!  More later ... stay tuned! Julie

      !@#*#!*#!!  To anyone who found this blog from my Web site, http://www.stuckinthe70s.com, WELCOME, and THANK YOU for caring enough to find me here. If you read yesterday's entry, you'll know that I am in the midst of changing servers. Little did I know that would mean I would lose my ENTIRE WEB SITE!!!!! All of those pages formerly hosted by Cox Internet are gone, gone, gone. I thought they would be transfered over, but now I can't get to them!  So, I will be calling tech support tonight after work to see if the files still exist somewhere in cyber space where I can get to them. If not, then I will have to recreate my entire damn web site from scratch. Looks like it's gonna be a looooonnnnngg weekend. Luckily, I had saved my front page on my computer -- but that's the only page I have saved. The rest just resided in cyberspace. (I've learned a very valuable lesson here, folks.)  So, here's how you can help. If I have to create the site from scratch again, that means I'm not going to have all the groovy links and stuff I had on my former Web site. So, if you were linked on any of Stuck in the '70s pages and don't find yourself there on my site any more, please resubmit your link to me at stuckinthe70s@yahoo.com, and I will place you back on there. This is going to be a pain in the arse, I can tell you, but in the long run, it may mean a more efficient and better-looking site (trying to look on the bright side of life). Diary pages, hosted on a free server, should still be accessible. This also includes the magazine pages, I hope.  Please stick with me, and come back and try the buttons to the different pages. If it doesn't work, please come back again the next day, and hopefully, by Monday, Aug. 23, I will have it all worked out, and back up and running.  Thanks for your patience. I'm going to put my head in my hands and cry now.  Julie

      Well, boys and girls ... I tried to add a link to this lovely blog to my Web site  last night but kept getting a server write error. I'm so fed up with that server. In fact, I got so fed up, I switched servers!! Get a load of this -- I was only able to fit 10 measley megs on that server, which explains why Stuck in the '70s is spread out over, like, four Web servers (three of them free). Now, with Yahoo as my Web host, for a dollar less  month, I'll get 2 GIGs of Web space. This is going to allow me to put sound and video downloads on the Web site as well as lots of other good stuff!!! And, it'll all reside at the same place and be easier to upload and update. I, for one, am excited about this plan.  First day of school went relatively well for the boys. The oldest was busted while trying to take a big sombrero to school and the bus broke down on the way home. Son No. 2 did OK and is ready to get his trumpet tonight. We'll be going to our friendly neighborhood discount giant to do that as soon as I get out of work.  More later as I'm able to finally get things updated on my Web site again.

      This weekend, I'm going to put links to this blog on my Web site, www.stuckinthe70s.com, so I can get some feedback from visitors. NOTE TO VISITORS: If you're not nice, your comments will mysteriously disappear. So, keep it clean and friendly please.  That said ... school starts tomorrow. We've got to get a trumpet off lay away for my middle son. Ah yes, starting school band. Makes me think of Mr. Kinney and when I began fifth-grade band at Mossville Grade School, playing my dad's alto sax. I didn't like playing the sax so much, but I loved Mr. Kinney, the band director. (sigh) I specifically remember a powder blue leisure suit he'd wear with a dark blue dress shirt, white shoes and a matching white belt. Now, THAT's dreamy.  We're going to have to go shopping for school supplies tonight or tomorrow. I do love the smell of new crayons or crispy white notebook paper. New text books smell almost as good as lilacs or honeysuckle to me. Luckily, we store up school supplies in a big plastic tub each year, so we won't have too much to buy.  I won an auction on ebay this morning. I'm so excited. This little beauty is the September 1973 issue of Tiger Beat magazine. What's so special about that issue, in particular, you ask? Why, it was the first time I ever bought Tiger Beat. I had ridden my bike down to the Convenient store, saw the cover, littered with cute boys' faces, and snatched it up. It was at that moment that I fell in love with Tony DeFranco. I was 10, and Tony was 14. My husband wouldn't be born for another three months. ;)

      Well, here it is Tuesday morning. I meant to play with this blog thingy last night, but we got into supper (Velveeta shells & cheese and golden whole kernal corn), and then the hubby wanted to watch "Once Upon a Time in Mexico." We rented the DVD last Friday and have to return it tonight. He'd watched it the night before last but wanted to share it with me. Sweet. Antonio Banderas and Johnny Depp. I used to think Antonio was pretty hot until a friend who was an extra in "White River Kid" told me he's extremely short and acted like a son of a bitch every time she saw him. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Then there's Mr. Depp. Yeah, baby. Born in '63 -- there you go. I've liked him in everything. Well, maybe everything with the exception of "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas." That was just hard to watch.  We were gonna go to the oldest son's thingy at the high school last night. It was some kind of "welcome" thing for sophomores. At his high school, high school starts with sophomore year. Go figure. So, at the junior high last year, he wasn't called a freshman (although I called him that), he was called a 9th-grader.  Sophomore year. Boy, do I remember that. It was the only year I didn't buy the school yearbook. I looked like a greaser or something in my yearbook picture because my hair was so oily, even though I washed it every morning, and I had zits all over my forehead. It was the year of driver's ed -- 1978-79. I'll never forget learning to drive in an icy central Illinois winter.  Well, better get back to work ...

      An hour ago, I wasn't really sure what a "blog" is. Now, I've created one to be a companion to my Stuck in the '70s Web site. Woo-hoo! This should be a pretty cool.  I'll plan on this to be a place where we can do some remiscin' and some commentary on the world's current state. Or whatever. I'll try to write something at least a few times a week about what's on my mind or, again ... whatever.  Let's see ... today? Today has been a real Monday. Went by very slowly at work. Mind you, I'm grateful for work. Very pleased to be employed. :) In fact, I'm going to sign off here and write more later because I've still got plenty of work to do.
