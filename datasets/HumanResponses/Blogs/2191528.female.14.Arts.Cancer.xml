Anyways in Yearbook...When Lucy and I were walking out the door Andrew was in front of us... Lucy: *Opens his back pack halfway* Andrew: *trys to close it* Stop! Me: *Opens it full way!* Andrew: *Closes it and turns around*  Hey you!  Stop it!  Lucy's boyfriend called me a 'f_cking fatas_' so that wasn't cool...But at least she told me she was going to break up wik him...^_^!  Anyways...It turned out to be a good day until tonight when Marnie told me about She was going to join HF's...I was threatened because...I knew they were going to like her more than me because she has something like Julia...but me...I just have a nice and affectionate personality I guess...But I was scared because I thought Robin, Mindy, Tim, Ally would like her more than me...So I was so scared!  And I ended up yelling at her and all...And Marnie I'm sorry!  -.-  If your reading this...I'm so sorry!  I didn't mean to!  I'm so sorry!

      EDIT.:.:.I want to apoligize to Marnie...But she'd think I'm a bitch to apoligize...Ya know...Right now I feel like none of my insanity friends are my friends any more...I feel so lonely...Anyways...I think I just need someone to talk to...tomarrow I'll just be crying while hugging Alyssa...Because Marnie's not like any other person I know...She's *really* special to me...and I fucked it up...  Okay it went like this...I go on my old sn 'XxYeLLoWDucKEZxX'  And I forgot to block Diego on that sn and then he goes and talks to me and says bullshit about me being a bitch and an ass...He goes 'You are the biggest ass I've ever known'  Well you know what Diego?!  Fuck you!  Okay!  You ruined everything!  You ruin everything between Marnie and me alright?!  Anyways...Marnie and I had a fight...I mean...Yes I listen to her advice but sometimes it's too fucking much advice!  And I got really tired of it right now!  And now I think Diego told her what he said to me or what I said to him and now she's going on his side!  So I think that Marnie and Diego should be *best* friends...I mean She's been really mean to me tonight and I don't need to listen to anymore advice!  from her, because I know what I'm doing with my life!  So shit!  Don't ever tell me what to do...Don't tell me to change!  I will eventually change!  But hell not now!  Just let me be myself!  Now I'm going to bed to sob bye! >.

      And yet another skool day was today...:P  Well I went to P.E. and it was pretty boring, hung out with the usual: Stormy, Noel, Fransisco, and Stephanie.  In History, Edwin came walking to me and I didn't notice, but I knew someone was walking towards me so he put his hands on my eyes and I thought it was Sandra because his hands were cold.  So it went like this: Harris and Edwin came walking and Edwin put his hands on my eyes and I said 'Hmm, cold hands... It's Sandra!' and he took off his hands, and I saw who it was and I was all 'Oh, it's Edwin' and giggled.  I have a lot of guys I like...They are: -Diego G., because he's cute and nice and a trouble maker >D -Abraham, because he's really sweet and really flirty -Israel {aka Izzy}, because he's quiet and really cute -Edwin, because he seems really sweet and he's insane like, Julia, Marnie, Lissette, and X-ine, and I ^_^.  Alyssa was absent today so at snack I went to the blacktop and saw Jaime and hung out with her until snack ended and I went walking a lone to math.  At Lunch, I went to bookdrop first because my 'Hot Topic' bag broke.  The red string I use it as something for my hand, like an accessorie.  So I got my food and I went to X-ine and Brittany...and hung out with them while eating lunch...then I saw a lil' fight and I followed Lillit...to the field and met up with Abraham and Krystal...and he burped a L-O-U-D Burp and Lillit and I were applauding him.  and I carried Lillit on my back, for 25 seconds.  And Abraham got on my back, and I laughed my butt off.  And yes...Thats skool talk to you later...:D  Bye bye!

      I had like two dreams.  The first one was when I was with my old bestest friend, Benjamen.  When it was my first day at Holy Family in the fourth grade, he said hi to me and we talked and then became best friends.  :P  Anyways, my dream began by: I think it was in Alhambra I think, we were in the car.  His mom was driving, and we both sat in the back and we were holding hands talking.  And then the last thing I remember seeing is big bright sun.  The next dream was I was at skool, and it was really cloudy...{Hence it was raining during the night}  I was talking/walking with Alyssa and walking, I remembered saying 'I have to give this letter to Benjamen' and then later on she somehow left me.  I kept on walking and I passed Brian and he stuck out his toungue and made the rock sign.  Then I stood alone outside of Mrs. Augistines classroom, then Reberto came and some of his friends came to me and they were making fun of me, and I was leaning against the wall, looking down...and looking at my fingernails.  And I remember one of them saying: Him: How many Organs do you eat? 10? Me: You eat 100 Him: You eat 150 Me: Well then you eat 200 And meanwhile Reberto was staring at me

      :D  Wheeee!  Snack was just like a regular snack *until* when Lucina gave me my 'Evanescence' cd back!  When I looked at it...I examined it...and then all of a sudden I held it in front of me and said 'Dun dun dun dun!  We just got a cd!  We just got a cd!  We just got a cd I wonder who it's from!'  ;)  Tee hee then when I walked Alyssa to her class with Ernie, Ernie passed by her and put his hand in your face and slapped her butt and then walked away and then I was all 'TEEHEEETEEHEEE!!! HAHAHAHAAAA!'  Then at lunch...Oh my God.  I had half of a Chili Dog, and when we went to our corner I was singing all of these crazy songs for example...'Blues Clues Songs' 'On Top Of Spaghetti' 'Sesame Street Songs' 'John Jacob Jingle Hymer Smith' 'I love you' And then I felt so incredibly dizzy and fell down..>. D  Anyways...At Acting Training today, I met this girl who wasn't there last week but started like 2 weeks ago...She came today and she is sooo awesome!  Her name's Carrin or something like that!  :D  I think we'll become good friends in that class!  So next week I'm going to write a letter to her...Exchanging #'s and stuff...Hopefully...:P  Well I'm home and I'm going to so some stuff buh bye!  I love ya!  ~hugs~  EDIT!!!!  Since there's two Michelle's in the Acting class...And not to let anyone get confused, Jonathan is going to call me by 'Renee' and Carrin is going to call me 'Ren' for short...But I said for him to call me by my middle name because the other Michelle is cuter and younger so she deserves it!!!  :D :D :D  Love ya  Michelle!!!

      At skool today:  At Snack, Alyssa came back, I asked her where she was.  She said she had a Pink Eye.  Then when we sat down Ernie, a friend of his, and Ritardo came to us.  I was looking away, and he was looking at us.  Then when he walked away I looked at him and I saw him smirking at me.  >.  In my math class we changed seats.  and Mr. Duran put me in the front.  And then I told him that I couldn't see in the front. ;) So I sit in one desk back.  But at least I sit near the cutest guy in class, Israel.  Our New P.E. teacher is awesome.  His name is Mr. Parker.  We only stretch our muscles, do our activit and then leave.  He said he doesn't believe that running laps and doing excerciss is what P.E. is about...He thinks that P.E. is about the activitys...^.^  Alyssa also gave me a choker necklace chain.  Hers says 'Best' and mine says 'Friends'.  She's my really close friend at skool.  And Marnie & Julia are my closest friends out of skool...;)  At lunch, we chased Ernie.  He kept on running away and going to teachers out on the field...>. .o  Ritardo is an ugly butt.  He's so small, thin, and short  :P  I went to my new Elective class.  Andrew, Anahid, Kristina, and Denise from my old yearbook class are in it.  And Anahid threw up because she ate food poisening at lunch.  And two people who sit next to me were making fun of her...>.

      I didn't do anything interesting today, woke up at 12:00. :P  And I talked to Alyssa and I told her I needed to talk to Abraham before Monday, or I guess I would talk to him on Monday.  But I feel like this weekend is so damn long.  I miss Abraham, because I screwed up yesterday.  I am going to hate myself because of what I did.  I'm going to write him a letter before I go to bed...if I don't get too tired.  Anyways, I didn't eat yesterday so I had this big ass headache.  >.

He's coming!' and I was all 'No way!' and she pulled my hand and we started running...o.O;  I didn't even know why, then Lillit told Abraham to talk to me, and I looked at her and I said Damnit, I was panicing and kept on going inside and outside of a classroom, then I ran passed Abraham, while he said 'Michelle!  Wait!' and I said 'GO AWAY!' >. .  -At English, I wrote Abraham the letter, I wrote to him what I wanted to tell him at Lunch, but my shyness took it away...>.  -Then After skool, I told him to meet me at the restroom where the bungalo's are after skool, and he did and he asked 'why?' and I told him 'I don't know' >. .  -And then I went to go see Secret Window with Gabby...:D  It was great!

It was fun!  :P  and twice too!    -At Snack, Alyssa had a student of the Month ceremony, so I was bored most of snack, Camille dumped Ryan yesterday, and she told me when she got home she realized how much she loved him and cried a lot and she cried herself to sleep, I felt so bad for her and she showed me a letter she wrote to Ryan to ask him back, and later on the day she came up to me and told me that they got back together and I hugged her!  I'm so happy for her!  :D  -At Lunch, Lillit and I did more immitations of celebrities, we did one of 'Benji and Joel' we did the song 'Hold on' I did Joel and she did Benji, you know how Joel like sing in the microphone in 'Hold On' video, he like bends over?

      Okay, What's so bad about this?  Abraham is a 7th grader, but he's freggin tall and he's 14.  Okay?  He's my age, he just flunked one grade or something.  Is it so bad to like a boy who's in 7th grade but my same age?  It sucks because I'm in 8th grade and I'm going to high skool next year meaning I'm not going to see him for a whole other freggin year.  I know it's not right, but I can't help it.  It happened yesterday and just because he's single doesn't mean I should like him.  I seriously need help.  I mean it's not right, and it's just difficult for me as an 8th grader.  And he's like, what? about 6 or 5 months older than me.  His birthday was January 27, 1990.  Another bad thing about him is that he's a huge flirter and it'll be hard you know?  Please someone help me with this.  P-L-E-A-S-E!

      April 28, 2004  Today I woke up too late to go walking by myself, so Tanti took me.  When I got there, I went to X-ine, and she didn't arrive yet, so when Brittney and Stephanie came first Stephanie put her hands on my eyes, and gave all these wierd answers.  And then once I saw it was Stephanie, Brittney did the same thing and I, again gave wierd answers, and she finally took her hands off and I saw X-ine and we talked for a lil' bit.    So my first class was History, we too more notes of the Civil War battle.  Quite boring.  But we did it.  And she gave us a lecture about how we are supposed to act when we have a Sub.  Because we acted pretty poorly, when the sub was there.  It sucked because she began to yell at us.  ._.  At Snack, I went to go get the usual, a burrito and juice.  I took two bites and then gave it to someone who wanted it.  And then I met up with X-ine and we hung out, while I went searching through her backpack.  And her backpack seems as messy as mine is.  It's like 'Damn!'  Except her's has more than mine.  I need to put more stuff in mine actually...:P  Anyways, she had some pretty cool stuff in there.  So when the bell rang we had to go to our Testing rooms.  yes...we're doing the STAR testing.  ._.  It sucks too.    The testing's are really easy actually.  Today we did the Spelling test and the Math Standard test.  Pretty easy.  Hopefully I'm at Average level you know?  So after the testing Stormy, Noel and I just hang out together, not talking just hanging out.  Pretty boring actually.  We would look at each other because we were bored.    At Lunch, I caught up with X-ine we decided to hang out at the field.  And then we went to the corner, and soon Abraham showed up, along with the gang.  And Abraham and I began flirting with each other.  I think I'm starting to like him again.  He's so cool, he began being nicer and nicer to me lately.  Anyways, X-ine and I just hung around and Ally, just the same being the same.  She just changed into an annoying childish bitch.  ._.  She was actually cool.    At Science, I finished copying note's and we watched this Bill Nye video about space and astronauts.  Eduardo and I were talking to each other, and Jennice was all 'You guys should date or something, your always talking to each other' and Eddy and I just looked at each other like 'wtf?' and laughed.  I can't possibly imagine dating Eddy, he's just a friend.    In Apply Tech, Jovanny sat between Anahid and I and got high off of my package of 'Big Red' gum  Teehee.  Then I did some definitions, aka bookwork.  But hey I finally finished it.  FINALLYYYYYYY!  BWHAHAHAAAAA!    When I went walking to the gas station I decided, Hey!  I'm going to buy some candy!  And I bought two kinds   #1. Pixie Sticks  #2. Vinilla Caramel cube things  So when I went outside to go wait for my aunt I saw Abby and she stayed with me for a lil' while.  And she opened the Pixie Sticks bag and she got three.  Then Abraham walked by, and it went like this...  Me: Hey Abraham!  You want some candy?   Abraham: No Duh! Me: I have some of those Vinilla Caramel cube things Abraham: Oh Sweet!! Me: You can have some I just don't know how to open it... Abraham: God Michelle! *grabs it from me*  Just use your teeth!  Abby: I told her to! Abraham: *Opens it with his teeth and breaks the bag while a lot fall out and hands me like 3 in the bag* I only got three okay? Me: Yeah right! Abraham: Serious! Me: Well then where are the rest? Abraham: On the floor I gotta go.. Me: Wait!  Do you want some Pixie Sticks? Abraham: Oh Okay.  *takes one*  Bye Michelle! Me: Bye Abraham!

      April 12, 2004  -In P.E. we did volleyball and it was fun.  Since I was non-Suit again, and Stormy's absent, Mr. Parker played with our tea, and I was actually getting into it.  So since Mr. Parker was with Noel and me, we won!  :P  and we got extra credit  -At Snack, I was giving out the pictures of me, I took on Sat. and a lot of people like it, which makes me happy because I think I look cutesy, wanna see it?  it's...http://www.angelfire.com/fang/passdabisquits/Me.jpg  :P  -In Science, I did my work with Eduardo, he's a cool bean.  He helped me with my work, and I let him copy it, because it was actually fun, because he helped me with it.  :P  Not much to say about it, we were supposed to watch a video, but we didn't have enough time to.  :(  -At Lunch, I took one bite out of a burrito and gave it to this blondey.  :P  While I was sitting down watching Ally eat Ernie kept on looking at me.  I still wonder why he always stares at me.  O.o;  And then since the gate was closed, we couldn't go to our corner...{grr...*KILLS!*}  Lissette and I followed Abraham to Mrs. Augustine's class.  and we hung out there for the whole lunch, mostly talking to Abby.  I don't think he hates me as much!  At least I hope he doesn't.  I saw Dustin...:D  And I said 'Hi Dustin'  And he smiled at me!  Wheeeeee!  -In English, they changed the seats, it looks soooo wierd though...it's like...wtf?!  o.o;;;;  After skool I walked home with Paula and we got the same thing, Doritos and Coke, then when I got home I took a shower, and that my day...:P  Not much more to it.

      April 11, 2004  Today is Easter!!!  :D  And it was also Julia's birthday party!  So I went to mass and I sat next to this one new member.  :D  And she's cool!  So at the end we began to sing 'Hallelujah' and it was really powerful and beautiful!  and then I got a lot of hugs, like from Joel, Mark, Marcoe, Margret, Lydia, and people...:P  and then it was back home so I can take a shower and get ready for Julia's birthday.  And then I put gel on so my hair would be all curly.  :P  And I wore my shirt I got from Solvang.  and my black jeans.  And then I headed for her house for her b-day!  :D  And I rang the door bell and she came like the usual to come and greet me.  Run and then slam herself against the door.  :P  So when I got in, She introduced me to one of her friend's from LACHSA.  His name was Mose.  I wanted to call him Moses, because it would get addictive, :P  and not to my surprise he was crazy like Marnie and me.  I mean I would expect it, I mean he goes to LACHSA.  So, when I went in the kitchen I saw Diego there, and I smiled.  He had the beatles hair cut, he actually looked cuter in it.  and so then we went outside and began to Tye-Dye shirts/socks.  Mose did a really good job in his, and since I didn't bring a shirt, I did some socks.  it was fun.  it's all tye-dyed and stuff.   Then after that we went inside to talk and hang out and munch on things.  So Diego like got a Carrot and put in half a pittah bread and showed it to me, and I began to laugh my ass off, while Diego and Julia and Mose were looking at me cluelessly.  I went next to Julia and kept on laughing when Julia and Mose got it, I began to keep on laughing and went on the floor.  Julia did the same thing, but got a bigger carrot.  and made a whole in it.  :D:D:D  dahahahaaa!  Then when Mose's mother came, Julia's pigeon who scares me began to like Diego's *ahem*  ;)  and it was rather funny.  And then when Mose left, we began to do stuff and then right when we were about to watch Life of Brian Dehvian came and we watched it with her and there was this one part where a guy says 'Bickis Dickis'  :D  and then Bickis's wife's name is 'constantious buttaux'  DAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA!!!!  Anyways when we went outside to paint, I began to paint my shoe and my Aunt came and then I had to leave and I hugged all of them good bye then left, and I went home and did some more of my homework, and Now I'm getting ready for skool so g'night!

      April 2, 2004  Well today was half day...and pretty miserable...>.  I went to P.E. and I was late as usual, and I went inside the activity room, and we had a sub.  >.  Then In History I had to go to Rosenburg's class to finish my test.  And Israel has Rosenburg too!  :D  anyways, they seemed to be doing a test also.  So I got to finish and when I come back to Frutschy, I find stupid Louis and Juan...and all of them looking in my History Notebook and I grab my notebook saying 'Hey!' and Louis goes 'Oh crap...' :-p    then I had to go to Math, so I went to the class I worked really hard on finishing the assignment, and no one was actually doing it...and so I finished and Mr. Duran said it wasn't due until the end of the next class...>.  Then it was Snack, >. .  Then it was Science, I had to do a stupid test in that class so I went in Petrosian's classroom do it.  I sat in the group with Jaime and Denise.  and I had fun at least being in the same class as them, and I miss Petrosian...:(  She was awesome...then I went back to Mercado...and I saw everyone playing around with their own cell phones...:P  and I started playing with them as well!  :P  Then at English I went up the stairs to the class then it said 'meet at the library' and then I went down the stairs then to the other building and went up the stairs to go to the library and got pretty pissed off in there, don't know how I just did...>.  Then in Apply Tech...When I was on my way there I saw Dusty and yelled out 'Dustina!' but I don't think he heard me...:(  Then I did some stupid stuff and after skool hung out with Alyssa came home took a shower and watched tee vee crappy day really...

      April 1, 2004  Hmmm...April fools day...>.  Main thing that happened today was at lunch  Alyssa was absent so, most likely boredom kicked in.  Dustin came to the corner, but Abraham didn't...:D:D:D  I was that Dustin didn't show up at the corner when I was absent.  o.O;  I wonder if he...Nah he can't possibly...but maybe...I don't know...Anyways, I did an Eminem impression and since it was the same day as the talent show I told them   Me: Hey I should of tried out for the talent show! Lillit: Oh and what would you do? Me: Uhhm...*Awkward silece* OH!  I KNOW!  Eminem impression *Laughter from the whole gang* Me: seriously!  imagine me with baggy pants and a baggy shirt, and having a cap on except backwards, and with the microphone, and *moves hands like a P.I.M.P.* 'y0 lose yourself in the music the moment...'  Gang: *Cracks up*  Teehee!  It was hillarious!  Then Stephanie and Lissette were whispering something, and then they began to kick my ass, and after like the fourth or fifth time, I fell on the floor with pain, and then I tried to get up but Stephanie's shoe hit me hard, and cut my arm...>.  Then later on I finally, FINALLY, F-I-N-A-L-L-Y!, got Dustin, I kicked his ass, litterally.  Not kicked his ass as in beating him up, but like just kicking...:D:D:D  Me=  And then when I got home I had a major headache and I watched TRL and the MTV News said that Simple Plan was breaking up.  Then they called the Lead Singer, and he said that it was true, then everyone felt sad, and I did too, and then later on he called back and he said it was an April Fools joke, I got so pissed off, I felt bad for nothing!  >.

      Well Today I was late because I didn't feel like getting up out of bed.  And because I didn't do my project thing.  And I had to do it today.  And then My aunt was bugging me, and just blaugh!  So I started walking fast to skool, and I made it!  I was like only a few minutes late!  o.o;  Wow, I thought I would be like 15 minutes late.  Anyways, I went to P.E. and saw X-ina and Noel talking, so I went with them, and then they started talking about Terrorist attack.  And it just freaked me out.  I got really scarrrred!  Anyways, after that I went to History and we were working on our Brochure's and I turned in my notebook and I don't know if a 25 is good or bad.  >.

      Heyy!  I'm back everyone!  Okay so I woke up today really tired and sleepy, I didn't want to get up so I ended up being late.  And what I forgot was that it was free dress day, which made my day a lil' bit more tough, so I went to my P.E. class and I went to the field and I saw all the 8th graders at the field and then it hit me, that it was Panerama picture day.  Where all of the 8th graders take a picture together.  And so I met up with X-ine and we took the picture together which was fuuun!  We would talk and we giggled and all of that coolness.  And then since the Panerama pictures took up all of 2nd period *W00T!* I went to my third period and we did vocabulary the whole time, which was kind of boring.  And then at snack I decided to call my aunt to see if she can bring me an extra T-Shirt, but she didn't.  ._.  And so after calling her I went to go to my Math class, and lucky me I got the seat with gum on it, and I had gum stuck on my butt all day.  >. .

      Hello there you miraculus people!  I got up late and rushed to put on some clothes.  And put my hair up in a high bun.  Then off to go pick up Paula.  When I got to class we were reading and the sort.  At snack, I showed Christine and Brittany my Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwich my aunt made me.  I laughed and told them that I felt like I was back in elementary again.  :)  And then when the bell rang I went to go to class and noticed Javier right next to me and then He said 'Hey Michelle' and I turned to my side, he was going up the stairs and I smiled and said 'Hey Javier!' Then I went to my class.  And Erika, Robert and I were writing notes to each other.  At the end of the class, Erika and Malcom were being really disgusting!  They were throwing spitballs at each other, except the one that Malcom threw landed on my sleeve.  It was soooo disgusting!  But Erika got back at him for doing that to me.  Ahh.  Even more disgusting then what Malcom did.  She got a whole piece of paper and put it in her mouth, she chewed on it until class ended and she put it in the back of Malcom's shirt.  Ewwwwwwh!  Anyways, I searched for Paula and didn't see her so I went to go walking home by myself.  *sigh*  I walked past Javier and his two wierd friends, and they just stared at me, and told Javier I was passing by and he got a piece of paper from his backpack and threw it at me.  I looked at the paper and threw it back at him and we smiled at each other.  Hah.  He's an awesome friend!  :D  He's probably one of my best friends, mostly because of his sister.  But I think we might like each other.  I try to get a picture of him but it's hard.  And I met up with Paula later on.  We started to walk home and then I saw my aunt and she gave us a ride.  And then I went to go get my hair done at the saloon.  And I got new shampoo to keep the color in longer!  \/\/|-|33333!  And then I went to my cousins house and we hung out there for a bit, We talked about how short she was and lol.  Poor Armine.  And then I went home and Allyssa called and gave me a speech why she wants me to pass 9th grade.  Dude.  I am going to pass, but she can't tell me what to do.  We had an argument like this before.  But bigger, but she drives me insane sometimes.  Voice Lessons are going to be at 2:00 on Wed.  Well better go to bed.  Paula's mom is going to drive us to skool tomarrow!  *hugs* Love ya!  G'night!  *kiss* Mwah!  Bye bye!

      Yep!  June 21 was my birthday!  Yet it was cloudy and it didn't feel like my birthday and I felt depressed the whole day.  Well at least half of the day.  Well I had to go to Summer Skool right?  So I put on my favorite shirt.  It was a John Deere one Mom got me from Hot Topic.  I don't know why I love it so much.  Maybe because I did the report on him so many times?  I have no idea why, I just do.  Anyways, I went to go pick up Paula so we don't have to walk those 3 miles to skool.  Or more!  *gasp*  So we also picked up Marly to show us where our classes were because she graduated Glendale High Already.  So, Paula's the lucky one, Her class gets to be where the bungaloos are and she doesn't get to walk up stairs.  Unfortuneately for me, I have to climb up to the 4th floor in one of the biggest buildings.  And there has to be 6 or 7 flights of stairs.  *sigh*  Poopie.  Anyways.  My teacher's name is Meados.  She's A-W-E-S-O-M-E!  She reads to us, she helps us with everything, she's just like one of the best summer skool teachers I've ever had.  Yeah.  So at snack I found Paula and then Brittany and Christine came and I hugged both of them, so happy to see them!  And then we just kept on talking and then when the bell rang we all went our seperate ways, Except when I started walking I passed by Javier and he called out my name.  Javier is my friend, Lucina's brother.  The 7th grader in Roosevelt.  He dated Monica too!  And so I turned around and like whoa.  He sooo changed!  His hair is now spiked.  He got a lil' more into Puberty meaning, his voice changed and he got a lil' bit more Acne then he usually had.  And he wore the same glasses.  In my opinion, he was much hotter since I last saw him in the 7th grade!  :D  He's going to be a sophmore now.  Anyways, I went to him and he said 'Hey!  Now I get to see who you are!  Kewl!  *handshake*' I said to him 'Yep!  *grin*  Very kewl!' And he said 'So who do you have?' And I told him 'Oh I have Meados up in the big building all the way up the stairs' and lol he said 'Haha!  I don't know where that is but kewl!' I laughed also then he told me bye and I went to my class.  Meh.  I like him now.  I know it's not good but I do.  Anyways, When we started walking home I walked with Paula and Brittany.  And Brittany's mom offered us a ride, and so when we got to Sav-Ons we all got squished.  Denise was on the far left of me I sat next to Denise Brittany sat next to me and Paula was sitting a lil' bit on Brittany's lap!  Lol!  It was sooo funny!  I could feel Denise's heartbeat teehee!  Then Brittany's mom dropped us off at 7-11.  It was like walking home from Roosevelt again lol!  The Mom picked Paula and me up and Gabby was there too!  So we dropped off Paula and then we went home.  Mom went to go do some errands.  So, Gabby and I went inside, And I saw the outside door had a banner that said: 'HAPPY BIRTHDAY!' And then I opened the door and guess what was inside.  No not a surprise party, there was a bouquet of roses {That are in my room at the moment. :P} and next to it was a card.  And it was standing on top a bunch of cookies.  And in front of my kitchen it said 'Happy Birthday Michelle' *sigh*  I opened the card and inside was a letter that said a lot of things that would make you cry.  It also had a 25 gift Certificate to Hot Topic.  And so I knew I was gonna cry when I read the letter, so I told Gabby to go in my room so she wouldn't see me cry, and so I started reading it.  I won't tell you guys what it said but I'll tell you what the first line said,: Dear Michelle, It's hard to believe you are entering your 14th year.  Throughout these years you've began to change and mature, and ever since I picked you up from the foster home.  It seems just like yesterday' and gah!  It would make you cry because I'm a rebel to her!  And I try not to be anymore.  Anyways, Gabby and I hung out and I was on the internet the whole day then I went to bed.  :P  And loads of phone calls :P

      Well yes today was a stay home day.  I didn't feel like getting up because I was too tired so I stayed home while getting Marie pissed off.  So then later on she stopped being pissed off and we went to Linkin Hieghts.  Well because she needed to go to the bank there.  Then we went to a mexican resturaunt.  And guess what I had?  A hamburger!  :P  and some fries.  Then we went into the 99 cent store and I got gum and some batterys.  When I payed for the batterys they cost 7 pennys more then I had so, the lady let me have the batterys even when I didn't have the 7 cents.  Wasn't that nice of her?  :D  How cooool!  Anyways, after that we headed home and I went on the comp for a wee little bit, and then I had to go to Dr. Mineros.  And this time when I went to Mineros, Marie told him every single detail that goes on here.  And duuuude thats not cool.  Every bloody detail..>.

      I woke up early because Paula told me to go to her house early so we can walk together to skool, because it takes us an hour or more to get there.  So I went to her house around 6:55 A.M. and then her mom offered to drive us to skool, so we were at skool at 7:00 A.M. and class starts at 8:00 A.M. and she was saying 'It's all your fault Michelle!  Why did you come to my house so early?!' And it's like 'What the hell?  You told me to.'  ._.  So, anyways, at snack I caught up with Ariel, Stormy, Noel, and Jenny.  And we walked around the whole skool, and it was really boring in a way.  When the bell rang, I started walking to my next class, and I started to walk with Javier, and I gave him a note that I wrote to him in class because I was bored, and he gave me his Hot Cheetos, because he didn't want it anymore.  And in my class we finished the book 'The Best Christmas Pageant Ever'  It ended up being really good and interesting!  :)  So after skool, I went to go meet up with Paula, where she told me she wanted to meet me after skool, and I didn't see her and I think she was with Audrey and Miranda, but like whatevers.  So then Javier gave me his response from the note I wrote to him.  And I read it while walking home and he invited me to hang out with him and his friends, because I have no one to hang out with.  And so thats awesome!  :)  When I got home, Marnie called and she told me it was okay to come over, so I went over and we got into her pool which had some chlorine in it and when we dried off we were soooooo exhausted so we watched t.v. and then when her mom came home she asked us if we wanted to see 'Spiderman 2' with her.  And I told her my aunt was picking me up at 7:00.  But I ended up staying over and we watched 'The Beatles' first visit to the U.S.' and I will never forget this quote   Paul: 'Ringo!  Packing!'  And  John and George: 'John and George best buds and pals forever!' {Or something like that}  Teehee and we watched PotC right before going to sleep.
