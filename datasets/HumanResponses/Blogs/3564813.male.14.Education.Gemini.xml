       Well, ya, its been a really long time since I last updated this blog. The reason being... I've been busy. Anyway, I'm at home alone at lunch, and have 6 minutes until I have to leave to go back to school.   CSI is one of the best TV shows on TV at the moment. That, and 8 Simple Rules, obviously. Anyway, the other spin off shows are not as good as just plain old CSI. I have a fiction book about it too which I've been reading this past week, and plan to read another one after I finish too. I wonder when that will be, sometime this week probably.  Our form tutor was away all last week and today too, so thats really good. She's so nasy, our previous form tutor went on maternity leave. When we had her we were 9TE, now since we have the new one, she changed us to 9WL! I have NEVER EVER signed a piece of paper with my name on saying that I am in WL, and I never will do! I always right TE on all of my work, and any forms that are handed in to teachers etc. LET THE POWER OF *insert something here* live on!   Anyway, thats about all I have got time for at the minute so see ya when I can next be bothered to write!

       Now, today was Deben House v Staff, and guess who won?! We did! Deben! I couldn't actually go though because I had to go home at lunch to eat. I also had media today after school, and started a small movie.  Ms Lonsdale was really nice to me in French today, she told me about Ms Tindles baby, and said she would tell her that we have made her a card (we have, but haven't got everybody to sign it). Honestly, forget what I said in Mondays post.  Can't think of much else to say, so I will probably either write tonight or tomorrow.

       WOW! Today was the hotest day of the year so far! I dunno by how much, but it was really hot all day! Also, today was the first day since the 1800's in which the planet Venus passed infront of the Sun! I didn't get a chance to see it because I was in school and you can't look at it with your naked eye.  Anyho, at school we returned back to Product Design, which is a million times better than Food Tech, because the teachers are better and... who want's to cook food, anyway, after watching Gordon Rammsay's "Hell's Kitchen".  CAD - Carefuly Aplied Deodrant! What's that!? You DON'T use deodrant? Shame on you, shame on you! You smelly little toerag, you must start wearing a range of plesant smelling fréquence's. Nah, never mind, I just wanted to tell you that James put the above down in his Manufacturing test, and still got a higher mark than me!  Today we had Ms Seath instead of Mrs Turner for Music, it was a really nice change since all we did was play keyboards etc. Nothing else really to say, apart from I probably won't be able to write any more today because I'm going to Darren's soon.

       t was early evening in the Queen Vic, and Daniel was settling down to a pint of Coffee. The pub was filling up and Alfie was enjoying some banter with the locals.  All of a sudden, Darren burst into the bar, after a hard day's work as as a top class Porn Star. Darren was out of breath, and gasped, "Help us out mate. There's a bit of trouble at the launderette – Pauline's tearing her hair out!"  "Sorry love, I can't. I’ve got to play Badminton at the Slaters round at Deodrant Lane", exclaimed Daniel. "Oh, be a mate Daniel", pleaded Darren "there's an enormous Fox sitting outside the launderette, and no-one can get their service washes back!"  "All right" sighed Daniel. "Seeing as you're a mate I'll help you out". "Cheers," said Darren, "I need to get my pants back before tomorrow."  They rushed round to Bridge Street as fast as their little legs could carry them. Sure enough, there was a great big Fox glued to the spot. Dot was trying to tempt it away from the door, but the Fox snarled and roared.  As if from nowhere, Billy appeared outside the launderette, brandishing a huge Carrot! The Fox pulled itself up to its full height, and towered over him. It rolled its eyes and lunged at Billy, swiping the Carrot away. Daniel and Darren shook in terror, fearing what the Fox might do next...  The Fox munched on the Carrot, and then spotted the fruit and veg stall. It lunged but toppled backwards and crashed through the launderette door.  Daniel gasped as a flurry of clothes rained down from the sky. Alfie ran out into the street and was blinded as Darren's pants flew into his face! "Never mind," said Pauline. "I'll put the kettle on." The Fox ran off towards Deodrant Lane as Daniel, Darren and Alfie collapsed in fit of giggles.

       THPS4 is actually really good! I had the oportunity to play THUG a couple of months ago round a friends, and hired it that same day, however after playing it for a couple of hours I decided it wasn't for me. I didn't like it. This is a different story however, I actually like number 4.  Anyway, I also changed the skin, to give the blog a nice clean look, lol, I have to say, i've only been blogging for a day, and I'm already obsessed with it! I really do think everyone else should have one! I really like the way you can share your diary with the world. Did you realise that these things even get turned in to books?  Imagine... in a couple of years time you could walk in to a book shop, and pick up a book/blog that you read years ago? Well, don't say it doesn't happen.  Tomorrow: Well, I have to go to Media Club after school since i'm doing Media Studies next year, last time we went we filmed a short movie, it went like this.   I was a teacher guy, who walked out of the door, I walk around a corner. You next see Darren, on his bike racing past. I stop him, and tell him to walk back the way he came because he shouldn't have been riding his bike. Next, when he is on his way back, he talks with a friend, still riding his bike. I shout at him and he takes no notice and speeds off, running over James in the process.   Pretty crappy, huh? Yeah it maybe, but just remember this was our first time. Anyway, tomorrow we have to go back and edit what we did. Can't wait. Oh, we also filmed some staff leaving, at one point when *name edit* was leaving on his bike, it actually looked like he was taking a piss while what he was really doing was adjusting his bike helmet. Oh well, smile, your on camera!  Anyway, going to go now, watch the monstrocity that is Eastenders. Wish me luck, this programe is really shabby, but somewhat adictive - "Ohmah, are you coming home for tea?".

       Well, just got back from town and I bought:   Tony Hawks Pro Skater 4  AND  Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers   They are guite old games but it was only £20 for both of them so I got a good deal really.  Later, I plan to go to Darren's and play out, but first I gotta eat, then I will go about 6.30. I just went to Husseins and didn't realise until I saw his bike there, but James French was round! Wow... I didn't know those two were friends! Anyway, I don't wanna sit at the computer too long because I may end up with a hunch back like the fat woman at the library!  Well, at the moment I'm drinking evian bottled water, and it's really not that nice. I could never tell the difference before betweeen bottled waters, but since I started to drink them a lot I can now tell which kind they are, and evian is one of the worst! I mean, the after taste is foul and the flavour is a bit on the sweet side. I definitley like Aqua-Pura a LOT more than this French crap!  Thanks to the caretaker having a wank in his office, he wasn't out in time to unlock the bike compound, so I was late out of school too! On top of that, having a crap teacher forth period was bad too, oh well, not too bad because we don't have her until next Monday now!  I'm so strange today, my mind has gone blank! On all school work today I've been writing the 6th June, but it isn't, it's the 7th... isn't it?  HAHA! I was so bored today, that I watched the Hey Arnold movie, let me say, it was ok, since it brought back memories from when I was a child, but the story was so predictible. Maybe they should have been evicted. (Don't worry, you probably won't know what I'm talking about.)  Hey, i'm now gonna play Tony Hawks 4, so I will probably blog again later this evening, or tomorrow.

       Well, this is my first update to my new blog! I'm at the library with a friend at the moment, I was going to get out some books but I don't have a library card so I can't they put me on the computers anyway.  Today was the first day back at school after the holiday it was ok, but we had Miss Beckett and she doesn't teach us anything so that was really booring, luckily she didn't talk much we just got on with doing our James Bond review.  Someone else was supposed to come to the library but he couldn't make it for some reason or another. Anyho, I'm going in to town after this, might get a game or something, I dunno.  Jack has his pool out and has his friend, so I definilty want to avoid going back there for a while, or else I may get caught up in something so boring, I dunno.  Anyway, German today was ok, we learnt new stuff with a good teacher unike ms Lonsdale, who can't teach to save her life! She would be better of as a fish merchant. Honestly, all she ever does is shake her head... constantly. UP and DOWN! ALL THE TIME!  Anyway, Darren's getting bored since he can't go on a computer so I'm gonna go out to town soon. I will write more later when I get home, ok?

       Wow. I went cycling today as part of Activites week we went all the way to Barnby. I'm really tired now, Darren's done it all week! Anyway - Shrek 2 is nearly done and I want to watch it later. I feel like randomly printing out stuff... because the school printer is really fast.  Anyway I saw Ms Tindle on tuesday and her baby! I took a picture of them (I was doing photography). I left the picture up in the art dept. and Laurence went up there at tok a  picture  of a  picture.  I really don't think Laurence wants it in there. I'm gonna ask him to remove it.
