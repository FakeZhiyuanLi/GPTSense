      Apparently my last blog didn't post in time for the holiday.  Sorry about that.  I'm still new at this whole thing.

      I went and saw the fireworks last night.  Or as we say in East Tennessee "farwurks".  Loved them, loved them, loved them....  I am so proud -- no, GRATEFUL to be an American.  Standing in a parking lot with friends and strangers alike watching a fantastic display of color and beauty.  Its astounding, when you think of what those amazing pyrotechnics represent.  It takes my breath away.  I am so fortunate that I have never had to witness the terror of war, and there are so many who are out there on the line preserving my right to gawk at the sky with a cocktail in my hand while time wanders on.  My constant and fervent prayers are with them especially today -- to the warriors of past and those of the present and future, I give you my most humble thanks!  Today I pray especially for my Grandfather, who is a long time veteran, and also for my little brother, who idiotically enlisted with the Navy fresh out of highschool (I am SO proud of you, even if I don't completely agree with your actions!) Last night I stood arm in arm with my good friend Shondar, with our hands over our hearts while we recited the Pledge of Allegiance, and tears (of bliss and happiness, and heartfelt gratitude) forming in our eyes.  A few feet away some rednecks were laughing and toasting eachother with irreverant displays of guzzling beer.  Why?  Because they could.  That is why I am so happy to be here.  So, so many have so much less.  What do I have to complain of?  Not a damn thing.    This is a great little  urlLink link , when it pulls up, just click your mouse in the sky and enjoy!

      So, yeah.  I know that you all are really getting tired of listening to me complain about all of my aches and pains -- BUT I AM SO SORE!!!   Muscles that I didn't even know existed are screaming at me.  I keep lifting up my shirt and examining my stomach... after that workout you would think that I have abs of steel.  But no.  Same squishy soft tummy.        Great pic, huh?  I have no idea what I was shocked by at that particular moment, I just remember being astounded at what I saw.  It may have been the tiny, cute little girl from the press all dolled up in Tommy jeans and dirt free shirt emerging from a tunnel with IMMACULATE hair.  I was such a mess, I think that I am still scraping clay out of my skin.  This picture was taken somewhere around five minutes into the tour.  I'll have to get one of the aftermath...  Oh, the horror!!!

      This morning I woke up at the crack of dawn and donned the oldest nastiest jeans that I own to take a trip to the  urlLink Appalachian Caverns  in Blountville, TN.  It has recently come under new ownership, and the new owners gave a private, three and a half hour tour for a few fine representatives of local media.   Crawling through caves with a bunch of strangers is not something that I really looked forward to, so upon request, my friend Rob agreed to come along.  "why not?" he says, "going caving a eight in the morning sounds fun!" And fun it was!  15,000 bats worth of fun.  Seven inch crawl spaces of fun.  Covered head to toe with clay and mud fun.  Bruises, cuts, muscle cramps and FILTH!   ...I have never enjoyed myself so much!  I felt like a superstar when we left the caverns.  That, and I landed a sizable account for the radio station... So that made me feel pretty good too!  But honestly, it was a blast, a completely new and foreign experience, and those can be hard to come by.  I recommend this to anybody who wants to kill three hours for something completely new.  I am sore, battered, and very tired, but I am getting ready to take a hot bath and a nap, and it will probably be the best bath that I have ever had, and I will most likely have the deepest sleep that I have ever experienced.  I can't wait!   I am going to do this again.  They only take tours of at least 15 people to make it worth the guide's time, so I am taking volunteers!  Who's going to come with me?

      "I love my oscillating fan.  It answers all my questions:  Do you keep my hair from getting messy?....  Do you keep my documents in place?....  Do you have three settings?....  LIAR!"   You just can't trust anybody anymore...

      Welcome to the trend that good friend Jason has started... its hittin' JC by storm!  Pretty soon there will be nobody to read these things, just a bunch of very self absorbed folk expressing themselves in a comfortable medium!  Amy, good luck with yours, I can't wait to see it!  You can check out her message board  urlLink here .  She's Canadian, so we can't help but love her, eh?
