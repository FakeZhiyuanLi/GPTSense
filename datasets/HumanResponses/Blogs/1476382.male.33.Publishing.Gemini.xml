      I, Garner: The Viceroy Papers by: Ron Mwangaguhunga  Ah, the spoils of war. I love the smell of Tikrit in the morning ... it smells like victory. Bismark is said to have once remarked that man can neither create nor direct the stream of time. Nonsense. I, Jay Garner, Viceroy of Iraq, will govern Babylon. It is my destiny. Ever since the Kurds hoisted me upon their shoulders and proclaimed me “Little boots.” If only they knew. Alas, the Tigris is not conducive to surfing.  Have sent Rumsfeld a memo to appoint Annie Liebowitz as my official court photographer. I am already practicing bombastic poses in the mirror. We are not going to do this imperialist thing half assed. Who says absolute power corrupts? Probably some loser. So little done, so little to do.  Rummy nixed the Liebowitz idea. Thinks I should be insuring that democracy takes hold. I have decided to favor the woolen tailored suits favored by the European administrators of the nineteenth century.   An Iraqi schoolboy led his class in a rousing chorus of Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries." Damned beautiful. I have been catching up on my reading: Conrad, Eliot.  I have decreed Latin to be the official language in order to break down the cultural and linguistic barriers that have divided the different regions of Iraq. I, Drusus Mosca Bismark Columbus Garner; I, Garner.  As I write this I am reclining on a couch with a hookah. This is the life. I think I will declare myself Emperor tomorrow.  I am now the subject of fascination for the newspaper gossip columns. The entire nation hangs on my every utterance … as it should.  Have decided that my job description – overseeing democracy, supervising construction of schools and water distribution --is more in line with God than Emperor. A theocracy is more efficient than a democracy anyway.  Our domestic staff is diligent and resourceful. Our saucier is noteworthy. Much better than the staff at the Hilton in Kuwait. Then again, back in Kuwait I was just Jay Garner. Now, I am a God.  I am attended by my faithful servant Muhammad. In lieu of Annie Liebowitz, Muhammad is turning out to be an excellent photographer. He constantly raves about my greatness. Tomorrow I will oversee several shrines being erected in my honor. I, Garner.  The Iraqi summer has conspired to make it so that I wear togas all day. Damned fitting, actually. Rummy  and the grocery clerks at Defense have sent an errand boy to collect the bill. I think I will have some fun with him.

       Mugabe Tyrannus   “In the tide of death from which there is no escaping, Death in the fruitful flowering of her soul, Death in the pastures, And pestilence, a fiery demon gripping the city”   Sophocles, Oedipus Tyrannus   Although “President”  Robert Mugabe  of Zimbabwe is considered an international pariah, a paleosaur from the chaotic era immediately following European colonialism, he enjoys quixotic support among prominent members of the African American community. On October 19, for instance, Mugabe appeared on WABC New York’s ‘Like It Is.’ A public affairs show, ‘Like It Is’ is the longest running African American program in the United States. The interview, conducted by the show’s host,  Gil Noble , occurred without a single probing question asked of Zimbabwe’s tyrant-in-chief. Perhaps in the interest of accuracy the show ought to be called ‘Like It Isn’t’?  Throughout the hour long interview, Mugabe made it a point to use the first person plural when making statements regarding the commonwealth of Zimbabwe. The regime character and the person of Robert Mugabe are entwined in Mugabe’s odd use of the royal “we.” “Mr. Blair and Mr. Bush -- we do not countenance any intention to interfere in the internal affairs of Zimbabwe,” challenged Mugabe at one point in the interview. Later, a jocular Mugabe, prodded by Gil Noble, added, “To me, (President) Bush seems to be an aggressive person.”  How would Robert Mugabe define “aggressive”? Mugabe extra legal land seizures could be considered, at the very least, politically “aggressive.” This week,  Patrick Chinamasa , Zimbabwe's Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, seized the farm of  Richard  and  Cathy Yates  after forcing them to leave; the crime: the Yates’ are white. “(Zimbabwe seizes) land because the British were intransigent – the Blair regime wouldn’t listen to our plea,” said Mugabe, defending the policy.  The land seizure issue has its roots in an August 1994 shift in policy, at the time Mugabe abandoned racial tolerance and announced that the government would no longer follow a policy of reconciliation between Zimbabwe and Europeans. The land seizure of the Yates’ property is not an anomalous: this past February, Peter Baker, another white farmer, refused to vacate his farm, Rocklands, and successfully challenged the seizure in court. Without any legal grounds, however, the Zimbabwe police went looking for him, forcing Baker to go into hiding for two months. When Baker returned, his farm was destroyed. There are approximately 100,000 displaced farm workers as a result of Mugabe’s quixotic land reform program. Before Mugabe they had jobs and got along fairly well with the white farmers, despite the massive postcolonial gap between rich and poor.  “The tyrant,” wrote the late philosopher  Seth Benardete , “is the true believer in the lie of the city stripped of everything that makes it noble and good.” (Seth Benardete, Socrates’ second Sailing, On Plato’s Republic)   Zimbabwe is the most HIV infected country in the world -- about a quarter of the adult population is HIV positive. In many urban areas, infection runs to 40% and the army, those numbers runs closer to 80%. If risk levels of AIDS in Zimbabwe remain the same, by 2015, AIDS will have caused the death of almost 52 percent of all boys who now are 15 years old in Zimbabwe, according to the United Nation's AIDS Programme in its latest population report.   Zimbabwe is also facing a massive food crisis. Refugees International warns: “the consequence will be a severe food shortage for 5 million Zimbabweans - nearly half the population - between now and the next harvest season in April 2004." Important crops like corn and tobacco production has shrunk by 50 percent. To top it all off, Life expectancy in Zimbabwe is poised to fall to 38 years.  Predictably, Mugabe, 79, denies mismanaging the country and in turn accuses local and foreign opponents of sabotaging Zimbabwe's economy to punish his government for seizure of white-owned commercial farms for landless blacks.  Ironically enough, the  Shakespeare Theatre’s  2001-2002 season included productions of The Oedipus Plays in Zimbabwe as part of a cultural exchange. At that time, the play incorporated elements of Ancient Africa, with African-American actors, costumes, and dances. The idea of having this particular Greek tragedy performed in Zimbabwe is fascinating, considering the tyrant Robert Gabriel Mugabe’s uncomfortable similarities to Oedipus Rex.  The roots of Zimbabwe’s massive structural problems are, like Sophoclean Thebes, embedded in the person of Mugabe. On October 20, 2003,  The Herald  (South Africa) reported that, “Nearly all government and quasi-government departments, as well as the public transport sector, had been ‘paralysed’ as the state fuel supply company had ‘run dry,’ the state press reported (this) weekend.” Mugabe’s Zimbabwe is plagued like Sophoclean Thebes. And like  Oedipus , Mugabe is a sociopath who has squandered the public trust. Zimbabwe’s bleak social reality is the private desires of Robert Mugabe: Zimbabwe is a mirror of Mugabe.   The US is ready to assist in the transitional process in Zimbabwe. Writing in an Op Ed piece in the New York Times in June, Secretary of State Colin Powell called on countries in the region to overthrow President Robert Gabriel Mugabe:   “A brave man recently met with me and described how life in his country has become unbearable. ‘There is too much fear in the country, fear of the unknown and fear of the known consequences if we act or speak out,’ explained Pius Ncube, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. Yet Archbishop Ncube speaks out fearlessly about the terrible human rights conditions in Zimbabwe, and is threatened almost every day with detention or worse.  “For hundreds of thousands of Zimbabweans, the worst has already come. Millions of people are desperately hungry because the country's once-thriving agricultural sector collapsed last year after President Robert Mugabe confiscated commercial farms, supposedly for the benefit of poor blacks. But his cynical ‘land reform’ program has chiefly benefited idle party hacks and stalwarts, not landless peasants. As a result, much of Zimbabwe's most productive land is now occupied by loyalists of the ruling ZANU-PF party, military officers, or their wives and friends.”  And what was the tyrant’s response to the  Secretary of State? “(Powell ) should have spoken about the corruption of his own government,” Mugabe told Gil Noble, smiling, seemingly pleased at his own outrageousness. “It is a rare opportunity to talk to an African head of state,” said ABC TV’s Gil Noble, with just a touch of hubris, in conclusion. Now if only the people of Zimbabwe could conclude the tyrannical reign of Robert Mugabe.

      Time seemed to stand still in 1999 when Brandi Chastain tore off her shirt, exposing a sportsbra, after her World Cup winning goal. Now, four years later, with the future of women’s soccer in doubt with the demise of the WUSA and FIFA’s money troubles that revolution appears to have stalled. Welcome to America, the hypermasculine.   NASCAR dads, the pollsters tell us, have supplanted soccer moms as the nation’s cultural barometer. Ubermensch and Governor-elect Arnold Shwartzenegger appears to have read the zeigeist well, simultaneously projecting willpower, decision and action. Beer and babe magazine Maxim – 1.5 million subscribers strong – is a rare media success in this lackluster economy. Even Halle Berry, Oscar award winning Best actress, dons a bikini and boxing gloves for the cover of this month’s FHM. Katherine Hepburn is quietly spinning in her grave.   Say what you will about President Bush – he never needed Naomi Wolf to teach him how to be an alpha male. Surrounded by hypermasculine types like Princeton wrestling sensation Donald Rumsfeld, a man who takes the combative stance of the warrior to a whole new level during press briefings, President Bush, like Arnold, is a mirror of his age. The image of hypermasculine George Bush in the orange flight suit on the deck of the Navy carrier is seared onto the popular consciousness. Gone are the days of the velvety voiced George Stephanopoulos’ anxiety attack rashes in the West Wing; gone are the days of former ballet dancer Rahm Emmanuel defending the President on television. Welcome to America, the hypermasculine.   Even the Democrats instinctively seem to accept the fact that the paradigm has shifted. Front runners General Wesley Clark, a warrior, and the super-aggressive Howard Dean, are perceived as the party’s best hope at defeating the President. Treason, Ann Coulter’s extended love letter to the masculine qualities of Joe McCarthy, is flying off the shelves. Our excess national testosterone has even seeped over into Hollywood, of all places. Extreme renderings of the Trojan War and the conquests of Alexander are currently in production. We are the most powerful nation in the history of the world, the zeitgeist appears to be saying – let’s act like it!   The American image of the masculine has changed. The slim and patrician Uncle Sam is now buff, drives an SUV, and has 50 Cent blaring on the radio. September 11, in many ways, transformed us into a warrior culture, and the War on terrorism influences all aspects of our society. Firemen, rather than movie stars or athletes, are considered role models, for instance. Working class soldiers returning for shore leave last Memorial Day weekend were greeted in New York like rock stars by leggy Manolo Blahnik-clad urbane Sex and the City types. When was the last time that happened?   Award-winning WWII historian Paul Fussell’s new book, “The Boys’ Crusade" sums up things nicely, saying, “there has been a return, especially in popular culture, to military romanticism, which, if not implying that war is really good for you, does suggest that it contains desirable elements.”   There is a significant reason that Senator Clinton opted out of a Presidential run to focus on her constituents and, tellingly, a committee appointment at Armed Services. Female virtues of nurturance, empathy, compassion, self-sacrifice, kindness, are, for the moment, on the wane. Welcome to America, the hypermasculine.

       David Brooks and Manolo Blahniks   For a conservative  David Brooks  is a different kettle of fish altogether. He is a sociologist who tries to be fair. Brooks also is fascinated by the breakdowns of the "blue" and "red" states during the election of 2000. For example, do you know that in Red states, you can usually find a breakfast for under $3? Well in todays NY Times columns, Brooks oh-so-subtly gets us Blue staters for knowing what Manolo Blahniks are. He does this by way of praising the salt of the earth values of Iowans and, ever-so-subtly hinting a very humid future residence in  Dante's Inferno  for us Godless urbanites.  Deliver us from  Prada .  urlLink Vintage Brooks !

       Where In The City Is P Diddy?   Is it just Shadenfreude to want to see this man earn his hundreds of millions in "pain," and "sweat," like Debbie Allen said in  Fame ? I want an up to the minute broadcast of  P Diddy   running the NYC Marathon. Around Mile 23 things should be, as Sean Penn said about his  fact finding  tour of Iraq: "very, very interesting." If Diddy makes it, I promise to take back every snarky playa hating comment I ever threw his way. Except about the  cheesecake  from junior's comment on Making of the Band. That crossed the line.

       What's It Like Trying To Make It in NYC?   I get asked this a lot, mostly by college friends, mostly by email. I guess I would day that two things above all else are important: 1) To do something original and exceptional in your profession, and 2) get properly attributed for it in the press. The very cool  Ivy Supersonic   outfitted  Pam Anderson  and  Kelly Ripa   with these very hip rock star hats for yesterday's  Regis and Kelly Show , but alas, both  Access Hollywood  and the  NY Post   (I have nothing but love for you guys) ran photos and footage, but did not attribute the credit to Ivy, whose hip styles could have used the boost. So, for what it matters, Ivy, this space is behind you. Someday when Ivy's bigger than Donatella she can laugh at this. Cheers, Ms. Supersonic.

       No Comment Necessary   From  urlLink David Brock's Blinded By The Right , page 25:  "The dominant figure at the (Washington) Times was the editor in chief,  Arnaud de Borchgrave , Newsweek's former chief of foreign correspondents ... the son of a Belgian Count, and the husband of a much younger, porcelain-skinned wife,  Alexandra , an accomplished photographer and the great grandaughter of the esteemed book publisher  Henry Villard , Arnaud was culturally about as far as one could get from Bible Belt fundamentalism ... (he) could occasionally be glimpsed doing early morning push-ups in his underwear in his office, or sunning himself with a foil reflector in the bureau adjacent to the Times building, maintaining a perpetual orange glow."

       And I Like K Street   I am pretty sure that I am the only one outside of DC that likes  K Street . I have not met a single fan in the New York area. I will give you that the story is loose and could be tightened up; I will also concede that there are too many tentative moments, "hrmmphing" and "hahhing," especially from  Mary McCormack  and  Roger G. Smith . Finally, yes, it is the revolving reality cast of stars and politicians that draws me in. And, no, I would not break off a dinner date to watch K Street at the appointed hour, I would, however, consult Mssr. Tivo on the matter.

       A Short Defense of Michael Wolff   I thought  Stephen Metcalf's   urlLink brutal Observer Book review  -- and I don't think I am going overboard in saying it -- was more about Michael Wolff than the book he wrote.   One line in particular kind of pissed me off. It purports to unravel Wolff's entire philosophy of life at one sitting:  "Messrs.  Diller and Murdoch  are at the top. Poets are at the bottom. (Mr. Wolff makes a big deal out of his status as a parent. One wonders what it’s like to grow up in a household where the prevailing sentiment is, 'What clear-eyed person would want to be a poet?') In between lies everyone Mr. Wolff condescends to. 'I had to summon my energy to want to talk to them.'"  Well, I consider the Bloggers the poets of the media world -- we are certainly not Barry Diller. We of the creative and fertile mind waiting to get a shot at the big leagues,  Elizabeth Spiers  is our patron saint. Michael Wolff has always answered my emails and showed me the highest respect over the years. Metcalf's article struck me as pretty personal for a book review, even in the snarky precincts of the New York media game.  Stephen Metcalf's feelings towards Wolff's style interfered in his review.

       "Diana Vreeland Loved Soul Train"   Which high powered Conde Nast editor wrote this? Note: I've never met him (hint, hint), but I like this author much:  "I earned my Masters degree in French literature in the Spring of 1972. My topic was the pivotal role played by all the fabulous, exotic North African women in the world of poet  Charles Baudelaire  and painter  Eugene Delacroix . My thesis was based on the whole sense of importance of Africa to the conception of Orientalism as it influenced art and literature in Nineteenth Century France, a topic in which I have a keen interest.  Delacroix's Les Femmes d'Algiers  featured prominently, as did Flaubert's Salambo. I truly loved writing my Master's thesis, and although I still yearned for the world of fashion, I moved on to pursuing my doctorate without hesistation."  Can you guess who wrote this?  One more clue:  "You see ( Diana) Vreeland   loved black culture. She loved the Saturday Morning Dance Show  Soul Train ; my grandmother cared nothing for it ... she went hog wild over every manifestation of black style. It all began, I think, with Josephine Baker, who truly was one of the most stylish women to ever walk this planet. Mrs. Vreeland loved to tell the story of watching a movie one night in the balcony of a Paris cinema back in the 30s. She had her elbows on the armrests and was intently watching this film, when all of a sudden, one of the armrests  moved . She turned to see what was going on and found out that she had been resting her elbow not on the arm of a seat, but on the head of Josephine Baker's pet cheetah, and that both the magnificent cat and its magnificent owner were now getting up to leave. Mrs. Vreeland watched speechlessly as the cheetah padded in a stately fashion up the aisle of the theater, Josephine Baker walking regally behind, wearing a daring, bias-cut Vionnet dress with no underwear on underneath."  If you guessed that this is  urlLink the wonderful Andre Leon Talley's ALT , then give yourself a pat on the back. Basta!

       When Did Rolling Stone Magazine Jump the Shark?   I am of two minds on the subject. First, May 3, 1998, to me, was the day the music died.

       Turning Republican Is Good For Your Career!   We all know Republicans make more money than liberals, but now actually  turning   Republican might also be good for your career. Witness:  Dennis Miller . Miller is moderately funny in a sort of very-near-nervous-breakdown kind of way. For years he has been trying to find his niche in Hollywood: He cannot act (Miller has always been frank about why he could not do skits on SNL), he isn't very  compelling  as a talk show host, and his comedy, well, to be fair: it's just not the type of comedy that assaults you, like, say,  Bernie Macs  does. Miller's comedy sort of lets you smirk at your own smartness for knowing the arcana he throws at you at the speed of a moderately challenging game of Trivial Pursuit.   Let's Face the Music in a very VH1 type of Leif Garrett-level frankness, Dennis Miller was one Call AT&T commercial away from being  Chevy Chase . Or  Carrot Top . Miller himself might characterize his plight in that manner.   But lo and behold,  urlLink one time Ross Perot supporter  Dennis Miller, fell in line behind the Republicans using the time worn cliche ("Let's face it, 9/11 changed everything")and chucked any sense of principle behind him and c'est goddam good, non?   Miller is now living large on the Republican dime. He is on  urlLink Fox Tv's Boston Public .  Miller is also a commentator for Fox tv, and now  urlLink CNBC wants a piece of him . Dennis Miller is like the prettiest girl in school fending offers from all the jocks. But does anyone really believe that a former Perot operative is now  so  Republican that he is willing to run for the Senate? His principles are reversed 180 degrees in a couple of years? He had a Paul in Damascus moment? Yeah, and I've got some Brooklyn Bridge property to sell you.  Forget turning Japanese, turn Republican!

       At What Point Will Dave Letterman Concede Defeat?   Granted, if you go in for late night television, and I don't,  David Letterman  is the smarter, edgier comedian than  Jay Leno . That having been said, Jay Leno is really kicking David Letterman's ass. No one denies it:  urlLink the numbers speak for themselves . Middle America likes the friendly and untaxing and accessible Leno over the conflicted and angsty Dave. So, now that the battle is pretty much decided and costing CBS quite a bit of change to remain at number two, at what point does the Tiffany Network either: a) concede defeat and go home and try another attack, or, b) keep throwing money down a moderately successful business model in the hopes that Dave will hold on to young men -- a desireable demographic, or c) kick things up a notch and really compete with Leno. If c) is the option, my Tivo is at the ready.

       Why George Stephanopoulos will Fail at ABC   Not since  Attilla the Hun's   aggressive campaign against the Roman Empire has anyone been so audacious and bold as  George Stephaopoulos'   very public transformation from the creepy giggling elf behind  James Carville's   Cajun strategist routine into a respected network news correspondent, or, as they say in the biz a "Wise Man." Imagine the  thumos  involved (George would appreciate the Greek philosophical reference) to think that you can go from the "the mouthpiece that turned" of the Clinton Years to  Cronkite  or  Eric Sevareid , if you will, without paying the requisite dues. One wonders whether the appropriate response is to applaud or to be appalled at the cheek displayed.   ABC TV was driven by a felt need to make a sexier broadcast -- they just were; they saw their line up of  Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts  -- a conservative tea party with no breaking scoops and little eye candy -- and thought,  this is the formula for perpetual third place .   ABC needed to bring a bull into the proverbial China Shop. In third place there is little room for failure. So: here comes velvety voiced squeaky clean metrosexual George Stephanopoulos, a yummy treat for the 20 and 30something  Manolo Blahnik  set, but, like  Phil Donahue , not very popular with men.    But Young Stephanopoulos is smart and certainly charming in a  Conte Baldassare Castiglione's Book of the Cortier  kind of way, not unlike  Daniel Patrick Moynihan  and  H. Carl McCall  a generation or two previous -- smart attractive men with a bold future ahead, and all that. Soon Cokie and Sam were exiting stage center, George Will's air time was curtailed, and that creepy looking reptilian  Fareed Zakaria   was given a short segment as counterpoint to Young Stephanopoulos.   So George is alone in an ideal situation with utmost control on Sunday Morning. Yet he is still in third. George Stephanopoulos is behing  Bob Schieffer , and, to be frank here, to get your ass kicked by Bob Schieffer is quite a feat.  Why is this thus ?  The answer is so simple it is plainly in the face of the suits, but because of their training they can not and will not see it. The answer is  idealistic  rather than the pragmatic and  bottom line  orientation of the typical ABC News suit: George Steph can not be accepted as a "Wise Man," at least not for a while, because he is too protean, too untrustworty, too "European" in character. Stephanopoulos may indeed be Conte Baldassare Castiglione's ideal courtier, able to charm  Clinton  and  Taki Theodocrapolos  as well as the buxom  Bebe Newirth , but the American viewer will not tune in to a Wise Man lacking in gravitas and solid character.  If we were an ancient culture like, say,  France George Stephanopoulos would be accepted as an eminent talking head and intellectual, he might even be President. But we are America, not France, and, not to sound too much like  Chris Matthews , a man who has his finger on the pulse of America, we like straightforward and natural people with the gravitas of conviction and loyalty. George Stephanopoulos has exhibited little or none of that in his adult life.   George Stephanopoulos  may one day pay his dues and become a man of gravitas like  Tim Russert  (think:  Moynihan , Buffallo, NY rustic principles, family man, Roman Catholic, "working class") or  Chris Matthews  (Peace Corps in Africa,  Tip O'Niell , Catholic, "working class", centrist, appalled by Clinton's moral failings, family man). But to paraphrase  Rose Tremain's  glorious refrain in Restoration for her mercurial character  Sir Merivel , "(George Stephaopoulos) is not yet the man he will become." And, whe he finally does complete that process, what an interesting person -- in politics and as a world commentator will be the man in full George Stephanopoulos.

       But What I Really Want To Do Is Executive Produce ...   Whatever happened to wanting to be a writer and creator of an HBO Show? Okay, fine, there is a certain coolness about  Executive Producing , like, say, the great  Michael Hirschorn  does at VH1 on those X Generation nostalgia shows. Even  Sandra Bulloch  is in on the act with  George Lopez . Then, of course, there are  Courtney Cox and David Arquette  and their design-fashion show. (BTW Was that  Courtney Cox  on the cover of  Town and Country ? Has Cafe Society morphed into the Jet Set? Yes, alas, I trace the exact moment when  John Travolta  occupied the cover story talking about his gaudy planes and not, say,  Dina Merrill  talking about the roses she grows in  Newport, Rhode Island  or  Harry Bellafonte  on the  Harlem Rennaissance .)

       Who Are You Anyway?   I'm  Ron Mwangaguhunga , son of Uganda's former diplomat to Canada, the US, and, finally, the UN,  Louis Kayanda Mwangaguhunga . I was born in  Kampala, Uganda , educated at the  UN School ,  St. Johns College  (Great Books) and  Marlboro College  (John Dewey). I worked at  New York ,  The Nation ,  Paper ,  Silicon Alley Reporter  and was Editor in Chief at  MacDirectory . Currently I am working to launch an  as yet untitled  magazine on independent film and technology. I hope to get it off the ground by  February 2004 . My work has appeared in the   urlLink NY Press   and   urlLink National Review Online   -- I'm not as liberal as most of my friends think --and I can die now happily because  Richard Johnson  mentioned me in  Page Six  a few years ago. There, now you know.

       Graydon Carter's Editor's Letter   My Conservative friends will accuse me of kissing ass and my liberal friends will think me a traitor for sleeping with the enemy over a magazine that rarely if ever does a cover story on African Americans, but it's my blog, so I'm going to defend  Graydon Carter's  Editor's letter. So there. Okay, "quite probably" the letter goes beyond any editorial mandate that the Newhouses ever gave to our Canadian editor (no, I've never met him), but consider this, O skeptical reader: my old friend  Christopher Hitchens , whom I used to intern under at  The Nation , was the house liberal of  Vanity Fair  , but he supported the war. So -- I ask you -- where was Graydon supposed to get a consistent voice against the occupation of Iraq if not from the house liberal? Is  Lisa Robinson  going to give it to the  Straussians ? Does she even really give it to  Rod Stewart  even? So, he did it himself and, in the process, got rid of those god awful editors letters that really serve no purpose and no one reads. Well, they read them now. Thanks to Graydon Carter, for being civilization's last line of defense ... okay ... okay, I'm disgusting even myself with this prodigious amount of ass kissing. But I do not find the highly political Editor's Letter to be the act of an ass.

       George Gurley's Vagina Monologue -- And Mine   Did you read  George Gurley's  Vagina Monologue in the  urlLink NY Observer  last week? Positively lascivious. When he was not going on about non-Platonic "cavernous" spaces, he was meeting up with German porn stars in bars off Avenue A (Hey, isn't drinking at an Avenue A bar a little  David Dinkins -era for the hipsters at the salmon colored weekly?) Anyway, we like Gurley, so here's our very own Vagina Monologue. Showing off our liberal arts education, my momologue comes from  Machiavelli's Discorsi Sopra la Prima Deca Di Tiudo Livio, III, 6 : it concerns  Caterina Sforza Riario , a great beauty of her day and a woman Machiavelli thaught of fondly, "(Some conspirators) killed  Count Giordano , their lord, and took his wife and small children. Since they did not see how they could be secure if they did not become masters of the fortress, and the castellan were not willing to cede it to them, Madonna Caterina (so the Countess was called) promised the conspirators that if they let her enter it, she would deliver it over to them and they could keep the children with them as hostages. With this pledge they let her enter. As soon as she was within, she stood on the walls and berated them for the death of her husband and threatened them with every kind of revenge. And to show that she did not worry about her children, she showed them her  genitals , saying she still had the means to make more of them." What an Italian woman!  Machiavelli  knows how to tell a story, dammit.

       A Beautiful Mind    Harvey Mansfield , the William R. Kenan, Jr., Professor of Government at Harvard, a conservative political philosopher and all around genius said of Classicist  Seth Benardete , "(he) was a scholar, a philosopher, and a most extraordinary man ... Before he died on November 14, 2001, at the age of seventy one, he was the most learned man alive -- and, I venture to assert, the deepest thinker as well."  Having read some of his unbelievably dense and brilliant books, I emailed Professor Mansfied, "I'm curious ... Mr. Benardete didn't speak out about contemporary political events despite the fact that he dealt quite a bit in political philosophy. Would you characterize Mr. Benardete as a conservative?"  Less than an hour later in my email box was Mansfield's reply, "Perhaps he was above conservatism, if such a thing is possible. HM"

       An Email From James Grisham of The Hannity Show   James Grisham, "Sweet Baby James", the producer of the Sean Hannity Show thoughtfully emails:  "I have served in the Navy as a petty officer, and in the National Guard  as a Seargent in a round out division - anti-armor was my speacialty,  killing tanks.  "If you did a tour of duty in the military, your blog would reflect a  vastly diffrent perspective."  And he has a point. I have never served in the military and the only tour of duty I experienced was as Research Editor at Silicon Alley Reporter trying to get info on moguls for the December 200 issue at the height of that Gilded Age. Although I disagree with James, I respect him greatly and hope we can just agree to disagree. Cheers, James.

       Whatever Happened to the NY Press?   The  NY Press  used to be an interesting read -- all snarky and conservative and above all  relevant  -- and now it has become an Eastern European literary magazine.  What happened!  I once even wrote an article on  The Great Books  for them a la   urlLink Alan Bloom  . It was the anti-Village Voice, young, angry, smart and media centric; low on facts, hard on rhetoric: New York Press was the Zeitgeist, it was a dissonant more working class continuation of the  Spy Magazine  tradition. I miss it, god damn it.  Russ Smith  sold it for $2 million, but he should have taken the the great  Taki Theodoropoulos  made him years ago -- $5 million.  urlLink   The worst hangover I have ever had was after a Taki dinner party at  Elaine's  for sex offender  Scott Ritter  -- I shit you not. Only, he wasn't a child offender at the time, he was opposing  Clinton  and  Hussein  ... it's a loong story. Anyway, the last thing I remember was drinking with Taki and  Chris Buckley  in the back of  Elaine's  arguing over the  Great Books  ... and I woke up very, very sick. Never try to drink a Greek writer under the table. And never,  I mean never , try to outdrink  Christopher Hitchens  ... but that's another story.

       New York Times Book Review   The Fantastic  Page Six  recently wrote an interesting piece on what is wrong with it. The Book Review assigned a review of a  Clinton  trashing right wing book to the HUSBAND of  Dee Dee Myers , the former Communications Director under Clinton. Are they crazy?! Do they have any sense of objectivity? The charge that institutions like the  NY Times  and  NPR  are objective about the news, or at least are moderate in view is being exploded on a daily basis by bullshit like this. Apparently this is standard practice, as the very cool  David Hershkovits  of  Paper  informs me.   urlLink

       On Tina Brown   Has anyone else seen the Trio TV special on 24 hours in the life of our favorite status seeker  Mrs. Tina Brown ? I'm fascinated by her, like almost everyone else in the NY Media circuit, but she is a strange woman. " Barry Diller !" says Brown, clearly excited that the daddy cool of business is in her living room, "Barry Diller!" she repeats, then points to the Trio camera -- very  meta , that -- and not so much says but purrs, "those are yours." Meaning: she is doing the Trio Show which is from Barry's network, isn't it irnonic? "Did  Barry Diller  say that?" says her husband, Mr. Brown, at the party, a little later -- like, maybe eight or nine cocktails later appropos of nothing. Is  Barry Diller Tina Brown's  god? Clearly there is some unhealthy compulsiveness about Barry Diller in the Brown household. And, more importantly, does anyone actually buy Mr. Brown's books? Enquiring young journo minds want to know. He seemed awfully "busy" in his study researching for some other coffee table tome that no one actually puts on their coffee table. He seems to be arranging pictures and reading while the go-go Tina Brown is out conquering the world and embarassing the aristocratically dignified  Candace Bergen . Anyway, I am still fascinated by Brown. But someone ought to investigate just what Harry is doing while Tina is saving the world.

      On the UN and the US   It is now time for the US to engage the UN, to take up our destiny as leader of the world -- through the UN, playing well and cooperating with others, enforcing global peace with a premium of attention placed on our national security. The collapse of the Soviet Union left little to nothing with regards to a teleological system with which to interpret reality, which, in turn, made the outsiders of history resort to what sociologists call "networks of kin," or, blood politics, namely, the use of ethnicity, as  Daniel Patrick Moynihan  and Glazer predicted a generation ago, as the most cohesive argument in influencing collective action and thus accruing power. The tragedies of Rwanda and Kosovo bear witness to the dangers of basing reality on ethnicity in the global village.   These three interpretations of reality, these forces – capitalism, ethnicity and fundamentalism –are the dominant realities for much of the planet. This tryprich hovers over the planet with the grave intensity of a cloud rendered by the British master portraitist,  Gainsborough . What in particular does this menacing cumulus suggest?  Of late, neoconservatives have made cavalier use of buzz words like, "civilization" and "generation," suggesting that the administration is hunkering down for a Vietnam style war in the manner of the Crusades, putting Western Man on notice. Those  neo-Straussians , who have spent tortured lifetimes locked in Ivory Towers reading Plato and understanding nothing Platonic (but quite a bit Clauswitzian) are characterizing the entire Islamic world, painted broadly, as barbarians, it seems. Perennial conservative favorite  Victor Davis Hanson , in his recent book, “Autumn of War'' goes so far as to say Islam and the West are ''two entirely antithetical cultures.''  This is an especially narrow reading of history, especially considering that the Bushies appear congentially unable to assign blame to the  Saudi Royal  family -- who are the true mortal enemies of the West – through the  Carlyle Group .  Let us hope that the ascension of Colin Powell and the relative decline in power of Rumsefeld and  Scooter Libby  mean that calmer heads are prevailing in the administration.  If only we had gone the route of the United Nations and used the goodwill of nations surrounding 9/11 to take control of that confused but infinitely useful institution (now, though, said institution is devolving into a significant but useless artifact as a result of the teddy bearish but hugely irrelevant  David Dinkinsesque  leadership style of  Kofi Annan ). It is sadly amusing how the Right engages in its favorite sport: Pin The Hysterical Criticisms on the UN ("It doesn't work," "The UN is only after one thang: One World Government!"). Ironically, by not participating in the UN and playing well with the other nations on this big blue marble called the planet Earth, we are in caught in a dangerous self fulfilling prophecy. Blame the UN for being ineffective in combating evil on a global scale while disregarding it will, obviously, result in a UN ineffective in combating evil on a global scale that is disregarded and resentful .   The US pays the overwhelming majority of dues at Turtle Bay, and, through our international lawyers -- great minds they -- Mid Century last, influenced by the calamity of Hitler and Naziism, Fascism and Japanese Imperial expansion, basically wrote the UN Charter along with British intellectuals. In high surrealist fashion, it was the US and Britain that led the unilateralism and heartbreaking irrelevancy of the UN during what history will almost certainly refer to as the Second Persial Gulf War (2003-2003).   The US could easily -- through clever diplomacy, brandished carrots, lengthy courting of our pouting but not disinterested allies—establish dominance in the UN and reform all manner of areas that are currently, well, how does one say it? Spookily unresolved. For example, we could revolutionize the Law of the Seas committee, which my father chaired in 1979. The Law of the Seas Committee and International Law pertaining to the law of the seas, which is, in the most polite manner I can muster -- a basket case.   Any pirate ship (or, increasingly a terrorist commandeered ship) can affix the flag of a rogue nation at its mast and sail, unaccosted. The September 2003 issue of the Atlantic has a spooky article by  William Langewiesche  on the anarchic seas and what goes on out there offshore. One could buy a flag, from, say, Mali or Nigeria, or any other rogue nation, for a pittance, and be put on their registry; incidentally, that money goes straight into the pockets of the corrupt juntas. If caught, with, say, suspect weopons, the ship and the terrorist aboard would be subject to the law of Mali or Nigeria (hah, what law?) and not, say, to a standard Law of the Sea -- there is none beyond several miles away from the coastline of a sovereign nation. Remember those North Korean scuds on their way to Yemen? They were detained briefly and then let go by US military officials. We are, to use a maritime analogy, "flatfooted" in those mighty ocean breezes which are -- spookily -- highly conducive to chemical fumes. That is the precarious position that our overstretched navy and coast guard find themselves bound -- to no uniform of enforced law of the sea.  If  George Bush  had used the UN, moved our Superpower briskly through the musty halls of Turtle Bay, as an eagle on the world stage, we could easily have modernized those Byzantine structures at the UN set up by dozens of competing beaurocracies over the past half century, and used the resources of the navies of the world, for example, to, finally, put an end to generations of pirates (from ancient Greece, to Corsica, to Daniel Defoe to Johnny Depp's scruffy and less malevolent-looking Pirates of the Carribean) and those terrorists who increasingly frequent the anarchic oceans as their preferred routes of human slavery and other bold instances of tyranny.   But NO (shakes fist at computer screen huffily)! The hillbillies, the Rumsfelds and the pasty academic Straussians with their dogeared copies of Commentary in their back pockets, pale from the fortifications of the Ivory Tower, who have spent the 80s and 90s misreading  Leo Strauss  wanted to go at it alone ... alone ... which, as it happens, is just what the terrorists wanted. (continues shaking fist angrily at computer screen) By Isolating the US, making us act unilaterally, making us aggressive, all the while breeding the next generation of terrorists in the madrases of Saudi Arabia and Chechnya and the "Stans" of the former Soviet Union (Uzbeki, etc) and the Sudan and Jordan and Egypt, now work through tyrants in the UN to move world opinion, incrementally, in their favor: while the Rumsfeldian crows continue to cackle "irrelevant, Old Europe".   Didn't we all know that this was how this bad Operetta was going to end? With  Donald Rumsfeld  -- a two bit amateur wrestler at Princeton who has made a career of fighting (army, two tours of duty at the Defense Department)-- insulting Old Europe ad nauseum? It's time for Rummy to hit the showers: no more wrestling on the international stage for him.    I believe that the advancement of mankind requires an appeal to a universal and international law. This road leads upwards, away from provincial concerns, towards the United States, that great experiment in post-ethnicity, which appeals to international and universal law in all its founding documents, and ultimately towards the United Nations, the Parliament of Man.  Let us strengthen international Law. Pacta Sunt Servanda (pacts will be served), so that for the first time perhaps in history, since Roman Law, International pacts will be enforced by a mighty UN backed by the most powerful nation in the history of the world. Imagine the world's navies policing the oceans for pirates and terrorists, commanded by the US. Makes you sleep better at night, n'est-ce pas?  It is high time for International Law to be followed and enforced. It is high time for an International Criminal Court (I have a Dream:  Kissinger  in ankle chains trying to charm an international tribunal for War Crimes in Chile and East Timor). It is time for the people of the world to stop clutching at kinship in blood and kinship in religion as viable systems of reality in a global world, else we continue the historical loop, caught in repeat, at war with those who are outside our kinships of blood and religion.  We must realize that the only kinship that will bring harmony to the pandemonium of international affairs is a kinship and concern based on our shared planetary territory, the Earth. With global advancements in travel and communication, the landscape of the planet has shortened, leaving us with a global village, a neighborhood, in which we all either share, or proceed to corrupt en masse. No one asked for this global village, but it appears that history is asking us to respond.  President George Bush’s recent address to the United Nations did not back down an inch with regards to the steamrolling stance of his administration and the war in Iraq. Alas. On top of that stubbornness, the President asked the General Assembly to send troops to internationalize the affair. So, let’s all get this straight: George Bush wants the world to send in troops, under the US banner, to a situation that they already fundamentally opposed. French Prime Minister Chirac, ostensibly speaking for the Chocolate making countries, says that they want Iraq’s sovereignty given back to the Iraqis. The immediate aftermath of the Presidents speech is that the UN has decided to cut back on troops in Iraq. Charmed, I’m sure.  That appeal to Iraqi sovereignty is a brilliant passive aggressive diplomatic move on the part of Chirac. It is, on the one hand, a popular and democratic utterance made to appeal to the sentiments of the General Assembly, namely, the non-aligned Nations and those hostile to the hyper power of the US (namely, most of the world).   In contrast, Imperial Administrator  Paul Bremer  has said recently that Iraq is not yet ready for self rule. In point of fact, it would be wholly against US national interests to give Iraq back to the Iraqis, in its current volatile state, which would automatically be a resentful enemy, if less dangerous than when Hussein was at the helm. So let us liberal and conservative Americans unite – that Elvin anti-realist Dennis Kucinich notwithstanding – in grave concern at the idea of allowing Iraq immediate sovereignty.    President Musharaf  of Pakistan has already given us a resounding no, couched in the frisky proviso that if the US sends “military and intelligence aid” (read: money), then they might be able to comply. Might.  Of course, any such an offer would have to be reciprocated with India, Pakistan’s nemesis, whose troops we would also like in the mix; Egypt, too must be bribed: Egypt, which is undergoing deep internal resistance to the US and, if the Atlantic Magazine is to be believed, the Mubarak regime is on the verge of being toppled by a more radical element.  Turkey is looking increasingly unhappy at further cooperation with troops, as we cannot quite match our previous bribes from before the Second Persian Gulf War.   Security Council Resolution 1244, which made Kosovo a UN protectorate, increasingly appears to be the best viable option for the Iraq quagmire. UN protectorate status is, in fact, an incubation program for nations that has a remarkably high rate of success –- in East Timor, for example. Despite the fact that many of the most powerful nations in the General Assembly and Security Council were against the war, now is the time to put aside petty differences. The tyrant Sadaam Hussein is gone, and order in the region is the next great obstacle facing the world.   Our American troops are in a shooting gallery. On average one soldier is killed a day, and several attacks per day are sustained. The UN is also a target. The UN Mission in Baghdad was attacked, killing the great humanitarian Sergio Vieira de Mello, an architect, by the way, of the mechanisms of UN Protectorates. And the UN Mission in Iraq was attacked earlier today. Giving up the administration of Iraq to the UN would save us from the budget crunching $87 billion that George Bush asked the nation to spend. Although the UN troops would be targets of Muslim terrorists, they would be far less of a target and we would be free of the quagmire.   Why are we being stubborn about Iraq? Any civilized thinker knows (that elven waif  Dennis Kucinich  notwithstanding) that we cannot abandon Iraq altogether, that would be contrary to our national interest. The UN wants to do this, or at least, they would accept this burden if only for the sake of relevance or humanitarian altruism. The UN would probably do a better job than the US as well because internal antagonisms towards the world legislative body are far less than against the US.   The US would save tens of billions of dollars in the process. The US would regain a degree of goodwill from the nations of the world. US soldiers would be out of dangers way, to a large extent, and, finally, we would be able to rotate home those soldiers, to attend to their families. Fresh UN troops would lessen US involvement and allow new reserves to pick up where exhausted troops left off. The UN would be doing what they are good at – not “making constitution,” as  President George Bush  contemptuously offered, but in incubating a nation.   There is no reason for George W Bush to cling to the carcass of Iraq as if he were an apex predator unwilling to abandon his prey. The President had best turn his attentions to America and our own electric grids before lavishing those favors on Iraq. We’ve done our job; Iraq is no longer a threat. Now let’s leave the heavy lifting to the experts.  Once the UN is recognized and empowered as the Parliament of Man by the US, then, and only then, can compassionate conservatives End trafficking in human slaves. Pass the UN resolution. Enforce this with all the armies of the world. GW and conservatives are right on the buzzer with this. Human Rights advocates will team with conservatives and the armies of the world to finally eradicate this scourge in our lifetime.  Ladies and gentlemen we are the future of the world, and the UN is the framework by which the human race and the global village can advance and prosper.

      An Interview With Senator John Kerry's Hair  After several frustrated attempts, we were finally granted this important historical moment. So, without further ado, we proudly present for the first time: a print interview with  Senator John Kerry's hair .  Interviewer: Charmed, I'm sure; why now?   John Kerry's Hair  (hereafter JKH): I will concede that I have been reluctant in the past, but setting the record straight is important to me.   Interviewer : That, and the upcoming Democratic Party primaries. Would you care to take the opportunity to sum up your opposition?   JKH : Rather than disparage the talent in the room, I'd like to state  categorically  that I am the best head of hair among the Democratic Presidential candidates.   Interviewer : That is a bold statement.   JKH : Bold times call for bold statements, my good man.   Interviewer : Well, there is no denying that you are a  striking  coif.   JKH : Even by the considerable standards of Massachusetts, which were instituted by the Kennedy family. I am the measure of all things hair.   Interviewer : What about  John Edwards ? In the Senate he is called " The Prell Girl ". He has impressive hair, no?   JKH : (averted gaze) Well, if you go in for  that  sort of thing.   Interviewer : What is this that we are hearing about Dick Gephardt dying his eyebrows?   JKH : One hears rumors to that effect. (Unnerved) Look, what about me?   Interviewer : Sorry. So, tell us: what are your secrets to looking good. (confidentially) Is it Washingtonian power hairstylist  Christophe ?   JKH : Please. Christophe is so over.   Interviewer : So tell us.   JKH : You're going to laugh.   Interviewer : No, that would be unprofessional. Trust me, I won't laugh. What is your secret for looking so good?   JKH :  Heinz Dark Brown Mustard    Interviewer : Oh dear.   JKH : Smeared  liberally  overnight, it works wonders. Also, I like to tell my constituents in Massachusetts that said mustard is just grand for use in grilled crab po' boys.   Interviewer : I'm sure it is.   JKH : So you see there are many political advantages to my wife,  Theresa Heinz .   Interviewer : Yes, I was meaning to get to that.   JKH : I really am not at liberty to discuss her.   Interviewer : (crestfallen) Well, okay, how about the President’s economic stimulus plan?   JKH : Can't talk about that either, old boy. I'll leave the meditations on the merits of the President's plan to help Americans earn ends meet to the Senator. My primary concern, rather, is the avoidance of split ends.   Interviewer : Very well. Let's try something innocuous. What color are you?   JKH : That’s not a political minefield. I am chestnut with a liberal sprinkling of dusted gray.   Interviewer :  Liberal , you say?   JKH : A poor choice of words, in retrospect. Let's just say I am a well textured mop of dusted-grey hair.   Interviewer : Are you worried about going completely gray?   JKH :  Pardon ?   Interviewer : It's a well known fact that the rigors and the burdens of the office of the Presidency turn their resident gray within the first year. That's a fact: look at  Bush  and  Clinton  and, as we speak, George W. Are you saying that you are not aware of this fact?   JKH : (hesitant) I am not unaware ...   Interviewer : Well then what is your position on going prematurely gray?   JKH:  Ah, hair today, gone tomorrow?   Interviewer : If you say so. Now ...   JKH : You say that this going gray is an  established  fact.   Interviewer : Of course.   JKH : Right. Well, I'm going to have to close the lid on things.   Interviewer : -- But.   JKH : So good of you to drop by, but I have things to discuss with the Senator.   Interviewer : Oh well. Good luck in the primaries.

       Toby Young Is An Ass    Toby Young  blasts  Tina Brown  in  urlLink The Telegraph today . In his missive he says of Brown, "The truth is that however hard Tina tries she can't seem to persuade the gatekeepers of media power that she is 'hot,' to use one of her own favorite yardsticks."  To be frank,  The Corsair  has always had a bit of fun with Brown, but this is just too juicy an opportunity. The comment that Tina Brown is not 'hot' to the gatekeepers of media power could only have been made by a very out of touch chump like Toby Young, on the other side of the Atlantic.  Now I have nothing against Britain, but everything against Toby Young. We met briefly at a dinner  Taki Theodoropoulos  at  Elaine's  when I was in my mid 20s. Taki introduced me to Young, who wrote for the  Top Drawer  section of the NY Press, back when the NY Press was relevant. I had read Young's first piece on  Graydon Carter  and thought it was very funny. Carter has this theory of "seven rooms" and if you make it into the seventh room you have made it, you are at the top of the status heap along with  Tom Cruise  and  George Bush ; Toby Young made Graydon Carter appear to be a status obsessed fool. On that evening I saw that it was Toby Young himself who is a status obsessed fool.  As I started to tell Young how much I liked the piece and ... slowly ... but ... surely ... Young turned away from me and looked towards the door. Finally his back was to me: conversation over. At the time I was  appalled , but later realized that sometimes, at dinner parties, especially in Washington, status oriented asses will literally turn away from a conversation in search of someone "more important." As a young man at the beginning of his career, I was, I suppose, less interesting than other guests, like  Michael Mailer  and  Christopher Buckley . Often I wonder -- l'espirit d'escalier style -- what I could have said to salvage the situation.  Several years after that I got a bit of revenge. The excellent  Jim Romenesko , ran a hot web site for  urlLink media insiders , which is still the best at what it does.  Somehow a conversation started on Toby Young, who had been fired at Vanity Fair and was being disciplined at New York Press for passing off an urban legend as a first hand experience (I told you Toby Young was an  ass ).  Young emailed me almost immediately. I guess either he read ny account of him or one of his friends did. He wanted to know if I was sure it was him because he kept a diary and he didn't remember the event. Oh, I was sure about the events of the evening. I even told him I remebered him as "balding."  Young apologized and that was that. But now, hearing Young in London attacking Tina Brown as being unable to get through the gates of power in the US is laughable. It was Toby Young who was blacklisted in the US because of his asshole ways, at  New York Press , at  Vanity Fair .   Tina Brown may have her faults, but she's never done anything to bring about the opprobium of an ass like Toby Young.

       K Street's Carville on Clinton   In  Ted Koppell's  book  Nightline  authored with Kyle Gibson (p.400) there is an interesting excerpt from an interview with  James Carville  immediately after  Bill Clinton  was elected President:  "I'm scared. I think it's a little bit like -- I'm kind of scared to see him for the first time. I mean, my only other experience has been with governors and senators. I mean, I know that once someone gets elected, the relationship changes. It's inevitable. I have no idea what it's going to be like when you see somebody as President-elect. I mean, I've never talked to a President."

       How Mort Zuckerman Beat out Lord Conrad Black   In  Richard Sikios'  1995 book  Shades of Black  he tells a compelling story of how  Mort Zuckerman  beat out  Lord Conrad Black   to buy the   NY Daily News .  urlLink Black  eventually went on to back the  urlLink New York Sun .   urlLink Lord Black of Crossharbour  was always a fan of the New York scene and was after an American flagship. In 1992 he met  Barbara Walters  at a cocktail party in London. Walters suggested to Lord Black (okay, I just like saying that) that he talk to her investment banker friend  John Veronis  about buying the troubled Daily News. Lord Black did and things started rolling.  He assessed that the  Daily News  was overmanned and needed a new printing plant, but, as a businessman, approached it all from the point of view of getting a "a good deal or no deal."  Enter Mortimer Zuckerman , an individual not tied to any company or justifications for his purchases.   Zuckerman made his wealth in real estate and wanted "face" in the New Yorkmedia swirl after buying  US News and World Report  and  The Atlantic . Black and Zuckerman initially talked about buying the venture together.  David Radler . president of Hollinger, Black's company, told Siklos:  "At one point (Zuckerman) talked, for instance, that we would switch every year who would control the editorial page."  Conversations broke down and a bidding war ensued.  Rupert Murdoch  weighed in, unsurprisingly, on the side of fellow conservative Lord Black. "I think Conrad would be very good for the News," said Murdoch at the time,"and he'd be better still for the city."  On August 17 Lord Black offered $75 million of  Hollinger  money and won backing of both the Board of Directors and management of the  Daily News.  Zuckerman won the drivers and pressmens unions. In the end Zuckerman won because he offered a more positive vision for the company as an individual buyer not linked to a corporation. Lord Black would have had to cut jobs to justify the purchase to investors in Hollinger. C'est tout!

       Daphne Merkin's Cate Blanchett Profile in the NYT Mag   For quite some time  Cate Blanchett  has obsessed me strongly but I could never quite figure out why. I mean,  Daniel Day Lewis  and  Meryl Streep  and  Liv Ullman  are also  lo ultimo , or the best at what they do, which is acting. But there is something more about Cate Blanchett's project, the great work of her life, than there is to the other actors.    I think the key to Cate Blanchett and what makes her so haunting is Liv Ullman, who makes a brief appearance in  Daphne Merkin's  perceptive piece (p.78, Sunday Times) -- the most perceptive interview, incidentally, I have ever read on the mysterious subject of Cate Blanchett. Merkin mentions that Blanchett and Ullman have been talking.  Apparently Blanchett is a fan of Ullman as director. Interesting. Ullman is definitely in that rarified stratosphere of world directors, after her work on  Kristin Lavransdatter  and  Faithless , which made a strong showing in Cannes in 2000. But Ullman is more famous as perhaps the greatest female actress in the history of cinema, which, I would argue, also means that Ullman may be the greatest  actor  in cinema, period.   Ingmar Bergman is in my opinion the greatest filmmaker in the history of cinema. That lone Victorian-Modernist voice, so full of harsh close ups, post-Christian angst,  Freud ,  Bach  and  Mozart , strange civil wars, failures of communication, discordant romantic betrayals interspersed with  familial comfort all served as background, in a way, to highlight Liv Ullman's historic performances. Ullman's strong work braught Ingmar's deepest feelings on human existence in the world. Bergman's pick up line on Ullman, it has been said, was "I believe that I will have a beautiful but painful tie to you for the rest of my life." Who wouldn't fall for a line like that?  Of course saying that is simplifying things greatly.  Max Von Sydow  served as Bergman's animus even while Ullman served as his anima, but I still believe that acting in cinema in the 20th century begins and ends with the Bergman-Ullman collaborations of high modernism. But this is a blog, so forgive me if I simplify a bit.  So that brings me back to Daphne Merkin's  urlLink perceptive article on Cate Blanchett . Why would Merkin not draw the obvious comparisons to Blanchett, who is clearly Ullman's successor, or at least would-be-successor, in acting and not directing. Well, for one, we may be treated to Liv Ullman  directing  Blanchett as Nora in a film version of " A Doll's House ." When Blanchett approached Ullman as a fan of her directing, it was a courtship of sorts. And the courtship appears to have borne fruit.  To a film geek like me this is big stuff. Then again, aren't we  all  film geeks now? Don't we all apply thought to the countless films we see -- on tv at the neighborhood bar, on TiVo, on Movies on Demand, on HBO, on DVD, at press screenings?   Anyway, back to the scariness of  Cate Blanchett . I have never seen an actress so disappear into their roles in the manner that Blanchett does. That quality of acting is particular to her. She disappears into, say, the single southern mother in The Gift -- accent and all-- charging that character with her own peculiar cool energy. Meryl Streep also does this brilliantly, of course, with flawless accent, as well, but Streep does it with  humanitarian intent   in mind. Her characters are often (always?) flawed people whom she inhabits and makes touching, human, worthy of compassion. I'm thinking here of  The French Lieutenants Woman , the tormented mother in  Kramer vs Kramer , Sophie in  Sophie's Choice . All of these flawed characters do not immediately elicit sympathy, but through the strength of her performances, Streep ethically forces the viewer to turn towards the characters and engage them as flawed but all too human.  Ullman's project, on the other hand, has evolved from the Bergman-centered expressions of angst and infinity rendered startlingly in the claustrophobic close ups where emotions are pushed to their outermost limits. I am thinking here of the scene in  urlLink Cries and Whispers  where the two sisters  Kirin  and  Maria , long stranged and cold towards each other, put aside all differences as their third sister lies dying. In the close up, the two sisters come towards each other, fall into one anothers arms, embrace, kiss, and let all the years of animostity evaporate on screen. Dialogue dissolves into a particularly intense Sarabande from  urlLink Bach's Cello Suite No. 5 . An infinity of emotions in one scene.   The evolution of Ullman's "activity" has now progressed from playing those roles for Bergman into a sort of multidimensional "conversation," or, rather, competition with Bergman in the realm of directing. Ironically she directs many films in which he actually writes the screenplay. A complex relationship, to say the least. Beautiful ... just like Bergman said in his pick up line.  But what does that have to do with  Cate Blanchett ? Well, Blanchett's project is not Meryl Streep's or even Ullman's, nor is it  Daniel Day Lewis' , who, though brilliant, sometimes seems on the verge of giving himself a mental breakdown, not so much dissolving into his characters, but conquering and enslaving them through violence, at risk to his own sanity. No,  Cate Blanchett   is the most interesting and strange case in that strangest profession of them all: acting.   Daphne Merkin gets it just about right here:  "A day or two before I meet her, I admit to a movie afficionado friend that I cannot remember the role she played in  'The Talented Mr. Ripley ,' and he sheepishly concedes that he can't remember either. It was said of the great English character actress  Peggy Ashcroft  that she didn't have a face, and in the sense of not seeming to be fixed in her own physyognomy, Blanchett doesn't have one either."  That is precisely what is so scary about Cate Blanchett. Not the impossible talent, though it is doubtlessly there: but the fact that when one looks back to the actor of any one of her brilliant performances ... one doesn't know who to cheer.  Who is Cate Blanchett ? Is she the face of  Donna Karan ? Is she the fashion icon who appears on countless magazine covers yet displays absolutely no emotion to Merkin on the subject, even going so far as to show disdain for, what she calls "lipstick talk"? Is she  Veronica Guerin ? Is she the pregnant mother of a child and a wife? Who is she?  Merkin askes Blanchett if she considers Veronica Guerin's lack of box office success despite her strong work as a result of taking on a Julia Roberts-type role:  '''Who knows,'' (Blanchett) asks, putting her finger on the existential mystery that underlies the construction of any screen persona, ''who  Julia Roberts   really is?'"  And then I finally figured out what is so scary about Cate Blanchett. Blanchett is the mother and wife and actress and model-spokesperson who stares at us from the magazine covers and the screen, she is all of those things. But they are all roles, waystations on an unknown destination. Asking who is Cate Blanchett is like asking What is a Self.   Note to self: See if you can interview Cate Blanchett on her next press junket.

       Jazzy: The Dog That Just Keeps Giving   Yesterday  The Corsair   came down hard on  Cindy Adams'   deceased lapdog and faithful companion  Jazzy . Admittedly, coming down on a dead eight pound pooch with the full wit and ironical resources of  The Corsair   seems a bit much. But Cindy couldn't leave well enough alone,  urlLink could she ?  And so with my morning coffee I was assaulted once again by a full page devoted to that annoying Yorkshire Terrier,  Jazzy .  A picture of the moist eyed mutt interrupting my french toast. Even in death that dog has found a way to get under our skin! Adams  writes:  "My pain was such that I lay in bed in a fetal position. I told almost no one because I couldn't stand it. Or understand it. I still don't. The trainer he's known since the Dec. 9, 1999, day he came to me has an upstate farm. He went for the weekend with his Yorkie sister,  Juicy . He never came back to me. Sunday he was dead."  Okay, let's gloss over the fact that Cindy named the other damned dog  Juicy . Let's leapfrog Juicy for a moment. Why is Cindy in the fetal position? I know that a beloved pet's death can hurt, but wouldn't her sympathies better serve the people of the Phillipines who suffered under the  Marcoses  while Adams was defending them in print to US audiences?  In her new book  The Gift of Jazzy  she recounts the gory details thusly:  "They said blood and everything was coming out from everywhere."  Only in New York, kiddies, only in New York!

       Whatever Happened to BUST Magazine?   Remember  urlLink BUST ? That significant 90s artifact that everyone who is anyone read is not as omnipresent as it once was.  Bust   was founded in 1992 and went "from a handmade rag into a full on glossy" by the end of the decade. Memorable stories include 'The Myth of the Black Butt' and 'A Vindication of the Rights of Cunt.' Lest you think that Bust is porn, it is not: Bust is a sort of grrl power Buffy-esque feminist magazine that even men can enjoy. And I did often. I remember a withering critique they did of Lifetime television saying, basically, that all they did was run miniseries after miniseries of helpless women being victimized by evil men and in the end the courts vindicate them is not a good thing for Middle American housewives to be supporting. Arch!  I can't even find Bust on my local newstsand anymore, though, and that makes me sad. Bust was Grrly before Xena and Buffy were.

       Asian Babies Take Over Upper West Side   An interesting social phenomenon has turned up on the  Upper West Side of Manhattan . Seemingly overnight, scores of WASPy and Jewish Baby Boomer couples have taken to adopting Asian babies, often girls a la  urlLink Faith Popcorn . What is this all about? Could someone email me some answers?  papermag@yahoo.com   A friend told me he thought it might be liberal couples adopting Chinese girl babies to save them from the totalitarian regimes abortion politics. Interesting, but I don't think that is right. Whatever the case, a casual stroll between 59th and 96th street and you'll see many Asian babies with white couples or their black nannies.  Sometimes in NY you can actually see the Jamaican nanny (UpperWest Siders favor Jamaican nannies while Upper East Siders favor European nannies who often have secret affairs with ... oh never mind) pushing a Japanese baby adopted by a Jewish couple. Only in New York, kiddies, only in New York.

       The Charlie Rose Drinking Game    The art of the interview is to draw out the subject while the interviewer recedes into the background.

Charlie, thank you for giving us those great interviews with  Kiefer Sutherland  and  David Westin  and  John Kerry , but honestly: It's not all about you. All those I's and me's Charlie, puh-lease.   So, in the spirit of Charlie Rose's energetic use of the first person singular personal pronoun,  The Corsair  proposes The Charlie Rose Drinking Game. It's late at night, it was a hard day at work, you are about to go to bed and Charlie is interviewing some Master of the Universe -- so why not have a drinkie poo on the Chuckster?

       George Magazine Could Have Worked Today    John Kennedy Jr's George Magazine  probably would have worked today. When you think about it, the interviews with  Castro , the  Drew Barrymore Marilyn  cover -- all were ahead of their time. We were just not ready to accept DC as a celebrity center when John John took us there.    K Street  owes itself somewhat to John John's foresight. That DC series which my good friend on the President's Bioethics commission tells me shuts down the town from ten to ten thirty on Sundays is so John John. George Magazine would have had an audience, George Clooney and John John would have had power lunches, oh what might have been. Arnold would be a cover boy.  Matalin and Carville  would have been columnists.  Dennis Miller  would have been the Court Jester. It would have been Camelot all over again. George was ahead of the curve.

       Gene Simmons to Sell Soul ... One Share at a Time   Legendary capitalist-musician  urlLink Gene Simmons  is planning to sell his soul one share at a time. "That son of a gun is clever," said  Satan  with an admiring smile. "God gave rock and roll to you, but Gene is a gift from yours truly." Since Simmons has sold virtually everything else to his band of gullible and financially solvent fans, the selling of his soul via over the counter penny stocks should come as no surprise. Simmons in the past has sold a very bad magazine called Tongue, as well as a KISS coffin, which, he at one point suggested would make an excellent beer cooler. Charmed, I'm sure. Insiders are predicting that Gene Simmons market capitalization for shares of his soul could fetch  $7.25 .  BTW: This piece is definitely satire in case you are wondering.

       Is Diane Sawyer Tired of GMA?    Diane Sawyer  joined the cast of  Good Morning America  in 1998 to help ABC catch up to NBC's Today. It wasn't supposed to be a permanent gig, but Sawyer is a team player -- whether in the  Nixon  Administration or on  60 Minutes . The temporary position, though, notes  urlLink Matt Drudge  may be outlasting it's welcome.   Diane Sawyer began her broadcast career at CBS Morning News and the idea of a long term contract at Good Morning America cannot -- in the nature of the tv news biz and hierarchy -- be attractive. "She desperately wants to give up the vampire hours!" a top production source explained from New York on Tuesday, reports  Drudgereport.com .   This isn't the first sign of unhappiness at the successful GMA. In 1998, Diane and co host  Charlie Gibson  were unhappy with marketing support and threaten to leave the show. On-air support was said to be inadequate because the show's producers were not supplying GMA information far enough ahead of time to be effective.   As of September ABC's GMA caught and passed NBC's TODAY show in many of America's top cities, according to Nielsen ratings.  GMA is ABC's best chance in years to stop the juggernaut of  Today  with  Katie Couric  and  Matt Lauer .

       Charles Murray: Ruggedly Ugly   Celebrated cryptoracist  Charles Murray , who has made a career of providing statistics for the those inclined to bigotry, is feted in this week's  New Yorker . In Saturday's Arts and Ideas section in the  New York Times  he was referred to as "ruggedly handsome" in a largely positive piece by one  Emily Eakin . Murray, who co authored The Bell Curve with  Richard Herrnstein  (who had the good taste to expire before publication) argued that African Americans have the lowest IQ scores of all the races on this Big Blue Marbe and that is attributable to hereditary factors rather than, say, bad neighborhoods and schooling (environment). Conveniently, Murray and Herrnstein postulated that Asians have this highest IQs and Whites are .. just right.   urlLink Rebecca Mead fawns  over Murray's latest tome  Human Accomplishment .  In Human Accomplishment Murray goes on to prove his own intelllectual shortcomings by rating  Virgil  a better writer than  Count Tolstoi   and  Picasso  a better artist than  urlLink Rembrandt  . That this man is postulating on intelligence and acquiring it in greater supply is ponderous. Charmed, I'm sure.

       The Real World: Not Happening   Finally, after years of vicariously watching that overdone  Bunim and Murray  confection where twentysomethings "hooking up," I can honestly say I'm over  The Real World . Gag me with a fork, I am  done . Watching plants produce chlorophyl could easily top The Real World Paris as far as excitement goes.   I'm not sure why I began to watch this show. I guess in the beginning before we all became jaded on reality tv shows like a hobo on  urlLink muscatel  .  The Real World was my crystal meth. And it was good while it lasted, I suppose in the manner of tweak. But I'm over it. Everyone would like to watch attractive twentysomethings get amorous -- wouldn't that explain the porn boom? It's just that watching these pretty but dim bulbs start "businesses" and compete against each other is a bit of a snooze.  The Greeks were great with wisdom.   Cephalus  quotes  Sophocles  the playwright and poet in The Symposium as follows:    Cephalus : . . . "I was present . . . one time when someone asked the poet Sophocles: "How are you in regard to sex, Sophocles? Can you still make love to a woman?" Hush man, the poet replied, I am very glad to have escaped from this, like a slave who has escaped from a mad and cruel master." I thought then that he was right, and I still think so, for a great peace and freedom from these things come with old age . . . . (329 c)."  Well, at 32 I don't need the viagra yet, but like Sophocles I am free from the tyranny of the cruel master The Real World. Basta!

       Is NY1 CBS NY's Farm League?    Duke Castiglione .  Andrew Kirtzman .  Jay Dow .  Kerri Lyon . It reads like a Who's Who of the NY broadcast news biz. All four talented reporters were originally  urlLink NY1  talent "poached" by CBS NY  in only the past year .  CBS NY is shanghaing NY1's videojournalists like sailors out of the 19th Century, with one difference, of course: unlike those luckless shanghaied, the NY1 staff is  voluntarily  leaving the scrappy local 24-hour Time Warner news service. As the hierarchy dictates, CBS trumps NY1, so there is nothing anyone can really do about the loss of familiar faces on the 24 hour channel. This leaves me wondering: Has NY1 become a farm league for  urlLink CBS NY  to pilfer at will?

       Whither Real Estate Gossip?   At what point during this whole postmodern gossip craze did we start to become  fascinated  by what can only be called  Real Estate gossip ? Don't get me wrong: I love my gossip served pipin' hot, but I'm not sure I need to know about the schematics of a particular celebrity home or even the price paid.  Too much information , thank you very much. For example: nowadays, we can learn through New York Magazine, that: " urlLink Kathleen Turner is downsizing her real estate to match her diminishing box-office clout ." We also are deluged with gossip about Woody Allen selling "his massive Carnegie Hill townhouse." Who can forget also that  Lachlan Murdoch  son of mogul  Rupert , " urlLink has bought an enormous-and mysterious-14,500-square-foot building in Nolita for $5.25 million."  Even  50 Cent  got in the news when he bought urlLink  Mike Tyson's $4.1 million Farmington, Connecticut mansion .   My point here is do we really need to know that much information? Do we need to know how much  Katherine Hepburn's  pad will go for? Is this just some elaborate game put on us gossip lovers by the Real Estate industry? And, finally, at what point did this useless information seep into the precincts of High Gossip?

       Simon Dumenco on Blogs   Okay, leaving aside the fact that  Simon Dumenco   left me out of his list of  urlLink six compelling blogs , his article was interesting. There  is  a blog explosion on the web that is growing increasingly sophisticated. Bloggers are now regularly scooping the news and making news and publishing some damned interesting information.  So, I'll lick my wounds of exclusion from Dumenco's list. You know,  urlLink Dumenco, being snubbed socially provokes exactly the same brain response as being physically hurt?  Anyway, I won't press assault charges.

       What Does James Truman Do?   Just what does  urlLink Conde Nast Editorial Director James Truman  do to fill his day? I mean, I know that he attends and throws  urlLink a lot of parties . And he announces new editors. And he travels to exotic places, like Iran. On Persia, he writes in Conde Nast traveller (April 2003):  "I'd traveled to Iran last fall with the thought of overlooking the country's politics and focusing on its history and natural beauty. This thought quickly disappeared, not least because Tehran itself is short on both history and beauty."  Beauty seems to be a big part of James Truman's duties at Conde Nast. Hanging out with supermodels, throwing the swishiest party, spouting the bon mot -- in effect, being the best Aesthete that  Newhouse  money can buy.  Hey, I'm not knocking it: the world needs at least one person expert in the incredibly diverse beauties on this Big Blue Marble -- from the Persian to the Polynesian to the Sub Saharan African to the Venzuelan. And maybe all the travel and worldliness might be reflected in a more diverse group of covers at Advance, no? I mean, how many times can Conde Nast actually run  Heidi Klum's  ample bosom and  George Clooney  at Lake Como? Can I get some diversity, people?

       Howard Stern Criticizes Oprah Winfrey on Exploiting Guests   King of All Media  Howard Stern  today attacked  Oprah Winfrey  for exploiting her guests. The nationally syndicated shock jock who has interviewed dwarves, homeless people, sexual abuse survivors, amputees and siamese twins blasted Winfrey. "She puts on these sad families and their stories ... then drives off in her limousine."  Stern could not be reached for comment as he was busy catching a ride with  Ronnie the Limo driver  to his miltimillion dollar  Millenium Buildings  apartment.

       Kurt Anderson to Colors   Kurt Andersen, the former New York Magazine Editor and founder of Inside.com is the new  urlLink Editorial Director and chairman of Colors , that sleek globally thoughtful magazine put out by Benneton.   The magazine up until now revolved around a single theme, like, say, "Death." Using thought provoking and compelling photographs, Colors would present global perspectives on the subject. Andersen, who has a rather evolved sense of design, like many of the Baby Boomer generation (he was a cultural and architecture critic at Time), should be an interesting fit.  (Ed Note: I was a factchecker at New york under Andersen and interviewed with him, unsuccessfully, as an editor at Inside.com)

       Celebrity Stage Names   In a world where justice is the law of the land a woman named  Patricia Andrejewski  would have just as much of a chance to be a star as  Pat Benetar . Unfortunately we do not live in a world free of xenophobia, of fear of the strange and foreign sounding things, so Patricia Andrejewski changed her name to Pat Benetar and the rest is history. Or herstory. Whatever.   urlLink Celebrity Stage Names  is a cool site that gives you the real names of stars before they were big. So:  Tom Cruise  was  Thomas Mapother IV  ,  Elvis Costello  was  Declan McManus  and  Ice T  was  Tracy Morrow  ... hee hee ... Tracy.

       It's Official: Cindy Adams Is a Picklehead   Coddler of dictators,  urlLink purveyor of perfume ,  urlLink dog lover , all around  annoying  media persona and Park Avenue doyenne  Cindy Adams  did not get that 40 minute exclusive with  Fred Durst .  The Daily News'   Richard T. Pienciak   reports:  "It's bull----, but you know, that's  the Post ," said an angry  Dick DeGuerin . "Those quotes are fabricated."  DeGuerin (who is aptly named and Fred Durst's attorney) claims that his client was tricked into a 45 second conversation by  Debrah Charatan , his second wife. But Cindy said she had four ten minute conversations with Durst on the phone from his Galveston, Texas jail cell. Hmmm. There's something fishy going on here. Could it be that like the dictators Cindy Adams favors, she could be going in for the noble lie? Say it aint so, urlLink  Jazzy  ... say it aint so ....

       Is Bonnie Fuller Getting a Bum Rap?   Wow. The media is snarky. Whether you are a writer for a newspaper, or a radio DJ, or an editor of a glossy, one thing can be said with certainty:  you, madame or sir, are in a snarky business . And there is no better way to see the snark fly than if your career is advancing at  Mach 10 . Then all the playa hatas come out and hate on you. So you say:  don't negetate ... congratulate .  Or something along those lines.   Anyhoo :  Bonnie Fuller's  career is in  urlLink overdrive . However you may feel about Fuller, it is good to see her dump  Jann Wenner ,  urlLink on his ass .   My factchecker friend  Tracy  always said that Wenner's enterprises -- Rolling Stone in particular -- are  not  very girl friendly, but that's another story altogether.   Bonnie Fuller drew great media ire for the fact that she was going from US Weekly, a glossy, to American media with -- gasp! --  tabloids ! There was something, oh, I don't know,  louche  about the whole enterprise, you know? One wanted to take a shower after reading that Our Bonnie was going the way of  urlLink The Pecker  at  urlLink American Media .  No, not our Bonnie ... she's one of us ...  the New York Media Elite !  But Bonnie, who is famous for overworking her employees, is  urlLink making quite a go at it , what with all the pilfered editors and the new NY offices of American media and what not.    Already controversy has erupted over running the picture of  urlLink Kobe Bryant's accuser . Of course, the media went after Fuller like a pit bull. The problem is, Bonnie Fuller did not approve or disapprove of the publication of the picture: it was an editorial decision made by  Jeffrey Rodack  the Managing Editor of  The Globe . Rodack wrote an interesting (and very oily)  urlLink piece for Poynter  defending his decision nto run the picture, and The Corsair blasted him for it (See  urlLink Archive ,  November 5, The Corsair ).  So I don''t see what the fuss is about Bonnie Fuller and all that "selling out her sisterhood" chitchat. The only thing I see Fuller as guilty of is overworking her poor employees: hey,  Bonnie , some of your editors and writers and factcheckers  have lives  that do not involve the Lexis Nexis, my little pomegranate!

       Awful Celebrity Plastic Surgery   Okay, we admit, that even for  The Corsair  this is a very puffy piece. But it's Saturday, and yesterday we did a lot of political conversation (log down for that), so here goes. Those groovy cats at  AwfulPlasticSurgery.com  have done up their site with speculations and pictures of  urlLink celebrity plastic surgery gone awry .  Terribly  awry.  Courtney Love  awry.  Check it out yourself.  The Corsair's  personal favorite is  Patrick Swayze  at the bottom. "Crazy like Swayze." Remember when -- for like a minute -- he was big in the 80s? And then came  Road House . Hoo, boy (covers nose with hand).

       Michael Jackson's Dad: Spare The Whip Spoil The Child   Celebrity means never having to say you're sorry. Or even, it appears, censoring your rambling and incriminating thoughts. Intrepid  Daily News  staff writer  Corky Siemaszko  reports that Michael Jackson's bizarre father,  Joe Jackson (no relation to the mild and affable adult contemporary singer with the same name) admits to  urlLink whipping Michael Jackson .  Yes, you got that right: whipping. First Johnny Cash gets his sister in law pregnant and now this!  In a  BBC  interview airing tommorrow, Joe says, "I whipped him with a switch and a belt ... I never beat him. You beat someone with a stick."  Okay,  Kuta Kinte !  Also showing up for the BBC chat was  Majestik Magnificent, Michael Jackson's  "personal magician." No, I'm not kidding here, everything I have written can be verified with a  Lexis Nexis  search. Although  Bonnie Fuller  might have one of her slave/employees hogging it.   Majestik told interviewer  Paul Theroux  that Michael Jackson is "not gay."  When confronted with the fact that the painfully shy Jackson vomits from nerves, his humane father answered, "He regurgitates all the way to the bank."   This interview will explain so very much about the strange man in the mirror who wears one glove and raves about  Macauley Culkin's  lips,  The Corsair  believes.

       Election 2004   It is probably time that  Senator Joe Lieberman  dropped out and gave his constituents in Connecticut his full attention. Why do I say this? Well, the other non electables in 2004 -- the foolish  Al Sharpton , loony  Dennis Kucinich  and  Carol Mosley Brann  -- know they won't win. Brann is running to split the black vote and deny Sharpton the black spokesperson role. Kucinich is pushing Nader ideas. And Al is running to be President of Black America. Lieberman is a serious man and should be taken as such. Every Senator, sitting in that aristocratic club deliberating on geopolitical strategy, thinks they can be President. But Lieberman has no base and is lagging on funds. BTW: Did you know that  Senator Kerry had chin reduction cosmetic surgery?

       Who Will Be The Next Secretary of State?    Colin Powell  has all but turned in his papers at the end of his term, so the question arises: Who will be the next Secretary of State? Will it even be a Republican? If a Democrat wins, it will open up a chance for some of the most ambitious men in the world. The Secretary of State position carries with it a prestige, a hint of wisdom and internationalism, that is irrestistable to a certain type of person.  Richard Holbrooke  is one of those people. He wants to be Secretary of State so bad I can feel it over here in cyberspace. His whole life has been maneuvered for the job.   Nicholas Von Hoffman  wrote in  Spy in May 90 :  "To interview Holbrooke is to learn the etiquite of media-government relations as they are observed in Washington. Some statements are on background, some are not for attribution. Some are deep background, others are deeper background, and a few are uttered on a swallow and forget basis."  Ahh,  Machiavelli  and his nasty grandson  Kissinger  would be proud.  Other contenders are the creepy reptilian Fareed Zakaria and  Michael Wolfe's  interesting suggestion in his media column some time back of  Walter Isaacson .

       Warren Beatty Has Released More Bombs Than North Korea   A thought occurred to me:  Warren Beatty  sure has made a few stinkers. I mean, I know he is the father of the Washington-Hollywood connection, back in the  McGovern  days when he was a volunteer, and even when he was an informal advisor to  Gary Hart  in 1984, but it has been quite a while between hits for great swordsman.  Ishtar alone lost $37 million. And who can forget  Town and Country ,  Dick Tracy  and the regrettable  Bullworth ? Maybe he should stop being Halle Barre's advisor and take some advice on keeping a career going? (BTW: What is that creepy Padawan-Jedi Master relationship he has with Barre anyway and does  Annette Benning  approve) Or maybe he should just finally take the plunge and run for political office. He's obviously wanted to for years and that receding hairline will not help him in looks obsessed Tinseltown.

       The Charlie Rose Drinking Game    The art of the interview is to draw out the subject while the interviewer recedes into the background. Although  Charlie Rose  delivers the goods on any given weekday, he uses the first person singular personal pronoun often. Excedingly often. Okay: all the damned time. Charlie, thank you for giving us those great interviews with  Kiefer Sutherland  and  David Westin  and  John Kerry , but honestly: It's not all about you. All those I's and me's Charlie, puh-lease.   So, in the spirit of Charlie Rose's energetic use of the first person singular personal pronoun,  The Corsair  proposes  The Charlie Rose Drinking Game . It's late at night, it was a hard day at work, you are about to go to bed and Charlie is interviewing some Master of the Universe -- so why not have a drinkie poo on the Chuckster? Every time Charlie uses the first person singular personal pronoun, down a shot.   And don't use any of the cheap stuff, ladies and gentlemen, this is Charlie Rose and that whole "corridors of power  Illuminati Trilateral Commission " thingie we're talking about. You better recognize.   If you are still conscious after the drinking game, then you are a candidate for the  Jared Paul Stern  Ironman Drinkie-poo competition.

       Will Someone Give Bill Murray An Oscar Already?   Oscar is fickle about comedians. Oscar eludes those who seek him. Will someone give the Oscar to  Bill Murray  already? His performance in  Sophia Copolla's    Lost In Translation  was brilliantly subtle.   Imagine a Best Oscar going to an underplayed performance.  Denzel Washington's  dirty cop was the most powerful and full-on performance in recent years and it would be wonderful to have Bill Murray's declining Hollywood actor in a foreign land win it this time around.   Murray has been snubbed by Oscar. He has never been nominated and that is a crime. Murray was endearing and complex in  Rushmore . He was a rich personality in The  Razor's Edge . And Murray was overlooked as the subtle but wildly funny psychiatrist in  The Mighty Tennenbaum's .   My favorite Bill Murray flik is  Meatballs , which is also the first film I ever saw. To me Bill Murray is the coolest man on the planet earth.

Also: putting  April Lavigne  on the cover of March 2003 was a very sad reminder that even though the music has died at Rolling Stone, the stink still lingers.

       Gore Vidal: About to be Gored   I love  Gore Vidal . Always have. He is an essayist at least the equal of  Camus , a  urlLink playwright , an actor,  urlLink an amateur historian , a wit, a bon vivante, a film director and a one-time candidate for a seat in the U.S. Senate. Vidal is an intellectual in a time when intelligence in a variety of the humanities is quite rare. And he is about to get into the middle of a shitstorm from the right wing.   urlLink Matt Drudge  is reporting that Vidal has said in an interview that, " Bush  and  Ashcroft  would be 'hanged' by Founding Fathers; they are 'despots'"  The story is developing but you know how this is all going to play itself out.  Once the story is out, probably later on today, right wing radio will unleash all manner of Old Testament Hell on the aging novelist.  Chris Matthews  will put him on to defend himself. Vidal's lacerating wit will not save him from a vivisection on Fox, on the radio and in the tabloids. Much ado will be made of the fact that he lives most of the year in  Ravello, Italy  and  Hollywood . His patriotism will be called into question (Vidal fought in World War II).   The words " liberal elite " will interject themselves into any sentence concerning Gore Vidal. And his highly controversial statement that the Bush administration knew that the World Trade Center would be attacked ( which I don't believe for one minute) will be brought up.  Finally, Gore Vidal's sanity will be called into question and senility will be hinted at.    The Corsair  had a brief phone encounter with this honorable man of letters. In 1995, while an intern at  The Nation ,  Christopher Hitchens  asked me to fax a story on  Marty Peretz  of the New Republic to  Gore Vidal . Gore Vidal's fax was busy do I called him up to tell him it was coming through. In the background I heard voices and music, apparently Gore Vidal was having a party at his palazzo. "Pronto!" he yelled into the phone, sounding a little sloshed. I told him what was coming, he politely turned on the fax, and that was it. My brush with Vidal.  At that moment my desire to be a writer in the manner of Vidal was strengthened one hundred fold. I wanted to dash of essays  Montaigne -style on Art and Politics and I wanted to enjoy life in all its rich glory.   It is unfortunate that Vidal uses such inflamatory rhetoric during this tense period in American history. The problem with Gore Vidal is that he was born rich and has lived his life where every utterance is taken as God's word, among idolizing students, servants, Presidents ( Kennedy ,  Hillary ?), and socialites ( Jackie O ,  Eleanor Roosevelt ,  Joanne Woodward ). He is for all intensive purposes the eccentric Southern Patriarch straight out of  William Faulkner . Operating out of that kind of fawning cosmos, a person doesn't practice the necessary art of self censorship of the politically incorrect, or even socailly irresponible statement.  Millionaire playboy-editor-journalist  Taki  is exactly the same way. Of course if you mentioned something like this to Vidal, he'd just say you're hopelessly middle class.  Older people tend to get more extreme with age as if all of their ideas past and present had crystallized into a sharp essence. For further reference, check out any talk show with callers that are seniors.  And it is very sad that Gore Vidal is on the brink of being villified at a time he should be resting on his commedable laurels. Sadness all around. I can't bear to watch.

       Help Tucker Carlson Name His PBS Show   Yes, you read me correctly,  Tucker Carlson  is going to get a  urlLink gig hosting a talk show  on PBS. "We wanted someone with a little levity on  PBS ," says executive producer  Jeff Bieber . "Yes, I used levity and PBS in the same sentence."  Washington's WETA will produce the unnamed 30 minute porgram. Anyone want to help Carlson find name for his new show?  Email The Corsair  at: papermag@yahoo.com.

       Indiewire: Elephant Tops List   The folks at  urlLink IndieWire  are still keeping the indie banner alive even though everyone else seems to have sold their asses out (think  Parker Posey ,  Peter Berg  and even  John Favreau  with that big budget kids movie  Elf ) to The Man.  I guess independent film is a waystation until you can smoke Camels at the  urlLink Chateau Marmont  and make big stupid Hollywood films with happy endings?  Even though Indie cred isn't worth a stack of celluloid, I still loves ya, Porgie!  Elephant tops the  IndieWire: Bot , which reports grosses for limited release movies. They write:  'Elephant' continues to show some legs, returning to the number one position on the  iW: BOT  after spending last weekend at number two. " Shattered Glass " switched places with "Elephant" in its second weekend in theaters, while the final film of the  Sundance  film series, " Die Mommie Die ," sashayed into third place. Also apparently opening well was doc " The Revolution Will Not be Televised " on one New York screen."

       Who Is Your Favorite Talking Head ?   News talking heads are sexy for a number of reasons. For one, they are wise, informing us of world events. Another reason that talking heads are sexy is that they are hired, in many instances, for their looks. Well, independent web site  Gogomag.com  offers readers who watch way too much tv a chance to rate their  urlLink own favorite news talking heads .   The usual suspects place well:  Laurie Dhue ,  Brooke Alexander ,  Anderson Cooper  ... but there are some surprises. For example: who would have thought that Fox Tv's  Shephard Smith  would top the men's list? And while we are at it: who would have thought that readers of Gogomag.com think that NBC News hottie  Campbell Brown  would only get 3 percent of the vote? Who knew?    RESPOSES   Jeremy Burnich  votes for, " Mishal Husain  -  BBC World News Anchor ." And Frank Lynch votes for  Soledad O'Brian ,  CNN's American Morning "  Keep those votes coming!

       Padma Lakshmi: Bud Girl    Salman Rushdie's  gorgeous model galpal  Padma Lakshmi   is set to become a Budweiser model,  urlLink according to Hello Magazine .   The Corsair   encountered Lakshmi and Rushdie several years ago walking arm in arm on a brisk Autumn night several years ago on the Upper West Side and shot a silent smile to Rushdie. Rushdie returned the existential aside, but Lakshmi scowled and tightly held on to the arm of her paramour before walking away.      The Corsair  can understand the jealousy, however misplaced. Lakshmi has a good thing going with Rushdie and it is best to keep it close at hand.  The Corsair  wishes Lakshmi the best of luck at  Budweiser  and her quest to finally get the world famous novelist to make an honest woman out of her. But Padme, why not give an inobtrusive fan a fair shake?

       That was Steven Brill All Over   From  James Cramer's  autobiographical  Confessions of a Street Addict , on mini mogul  Steven Brill :  "(Brill) never did know when to quit, though, and could not bear to lose at anything. At the firm's summer outing at Brill's Westchester mansion, he divided us into teams, placing us in his pool, and insisted we play a  vicious game of water polo  where dunking was encouraged and expected. He relished the contact, being a head taller than just about anyone else on the opposing squad, including me.  Just as I was about to score what would have been the tying goal for my team,  Brill sank his teeth into my throwing arm , spouting blood into the clear water in a steady stream. As everyone looked on in horror,  I could only laugh . That was Steve all over."   The Corsair  is currently in the fetal position, knees touching his pronounced cheekbones, rocking himself back and forth, mumbling over and over again, "the New York media will be the end of me..."

Here goes:  Marvad  made a deal with a man named Thrasher, who represented himself as selling the tapes with the permission of  Rick Solomon , who now says that that is not the case. And, apparently, Paris was ostensibly okay with the tape being sold.  Riiight . Who says porn companies aren't sleazy?    Anyhoo : This Thrasher guy said he already split the $50,000 with Solomon and plans to do the same with the 30 percent profits from the tape.

       Why George Stephanopoulos will Fail at ABC   Not since  Attilla the Hun's  aggressive campaign against the Roman Empire has anyone been so audacious and bold as  George Stephaopoulos'  very public transformation from the creepy giggling elf behind  James Carville's  Cajun strategist routine in  The War Room  into a respected network news correspondent, or, as they say in the biz a " Wise Man."  Imagine the  thumos  involved (George would appreciate the Greek philosophical reference) to think that you can go from the "the mouthpiece that turned" of the  Clinton  Years to  Cronkite  or  Eric Sevareid , if you will, without paying the requisite dues. One wonders whether the appropriate response is to applaud or to be appalled at the cheek displayed.    ABC TV  was driven by a felt need to make a sexier broadcast -- they just were; they saw their line up of  Sam Donaldson  and  Cokie Roberts  -- a conservative tea party with no breaking scoops and little eye candy -- and thought, this is the formula for perpetual third place.   ABC needed to bring a bull into the proverbial China Shop. In third place there is little room for failure. So: here comes velvety voiced squeaky clean metrosexual  George Stephanopoulos , a yummy treat for the 20 and 30something  Manolo Blahnik  set, but, like  Phil Donahue , not very popular with men.    But Young Stephanopoulos is smart and certainly charming in a  Conte Baldassare Castiglione's Book of the Courtier  kind of way, not unlike  Daniel Patrick Moynihan  and  H. Carl McCall  a generation or two previous -- smart attractive men with a bold future ahead, and all that. Soon Cokie and Sam were exiting stage center,  George Will's  air time was curtailed, and that creepy looking reptilian  Fareed Zakaria  was given a short segment as counterpoint to Young Stephanopoulos.   So George is alone in an ideal situation with utmost control on Sunday Morning. Yet he is still in third. George Stephanopoulos is behing  Bob Schieffer,  and, to be frank here, to get your ass kicked by Bob Schieffer is quite a feat. Why is this thus?  The answer is so simple it is plainly in the face of the suits, but because of their training they can not and will not see it. The answer is idealistic rather than the pragmatic and bottom line orientation of the typical ABC News suit: George Steph can not be accepted as a "Wise Man," at least not for a while, because he is too protean, too untrustworty, too "European" in character. Stephanopoulos may indeed be Conte Baldassare Castiglione's ideal courtier, able to charm Clinton and  Taki Theodocrapolos  as well as the buxom  Bebe Newirth , but the American viewer will not tune in to a Wise Man lacking in gravitas and solid character.  If we were an ancient culture like, say, France, George Stephanopoulos would be accepted as an eminent talking head and intellectual, he might even be President. France is a pragmatic and ancient culture: they go  in for the realities of ambition and Machiavelli; we, however, are different: America is a young nation of idealists. Naked ambition on a Stephanopoulan scale is messy, and counteractive to building public trust, i.e. ratings.   We are America, not France, and, not to sound too much like  Chris Matthews , a man who has his finger on the pulse of America, we like straightforward and natural people with the gravitas of conviction and loyalty. George Stephanopoulos has exhibited little or none of that in his adult life.  George Stephanopoulos may one day pay his dues and become a man of gravitas like Tim Russert (think: Moynihan, Buffallo, NY rustic principles, family man, Roman Catholic, "working class") or  Chris Matthews  (Peace Corps in Africa, behind the scenes opeator for  Tip O'Neill , practicing Catholic, "working class", centrist, appalled by Clinton's moral failings, family man). But to paraphrase  Rose Tremain's  glorious refrain in  Restoration  for her mercurial character Sir Merivel, "(George Stephaopoulos) is not yet the man he will become." And, whe he finally does complete that process, what an interesting person -- in politics and as a world commentator -- will be the man in full George Stephanopoulos.  Until then we get to see George in a spiffy new studio (why do network suits always construct elaborate new studios when a show is tanking? What is that about? Remember  Bryant Gumbell's  new studio? And  Dianne Sawyer's  at the beginning of her GMA run?) pressing buttoons and getting no public trust.

And speaking about antiquities what is it about  Ambassador L.Paul Bremer's  chair? It is just too imperial -- you know what I mean fellow media watchers? It's like he should be  slurping  a mint julep on that antique chair, inspecting his plantation or something. It is a very wierd looking chair: all elevated and throne-like.  That chair is not helping post-Persian Gulf War relief efforts.

       So You Wanna Be A Neoconservative?   Years after pathbreaking philosopher  Leo Strauss   shuffled off the mortal coil and was welcomed into the Isle  of the Blessed , where he and  Plato  and  Aristotle  discuss the Great Issues, things aren't going so well for neoconservatives.   For one,  Paul Wolfowitz  and  Donald Rumsfeld  are on the outs with  President George Bush .

Oh, Is that what enterprising people call it now-- a part ? A " piece"  was what  The Corsair  called it back in the day, thank you very much. Surprisingly,  Lloyd Grove   of the Daily News actually came up with this chesnut, meaning he is actually stretching his legs, singing for his supper, and hunting for some New York snark.  "He's doing it in his own time, according to nobody else's schedule but his," a Coppola spokeswoman told Grove.   Of course Coppolla is thinking about the best thing for his picture and not basing his casting decisions on Bartiromo's luscious lips, her expressive Neapolitain eyes, that honeyed voice ... ahem.

       Child Stars: Unsafe at Any Speed   With a little less snark than usual I submit to you this post. Why do we have child stars? I mean, in the bigger picture, isn't there something creepy about parents who parade prancing and emoting children in front of us for financial gain? Or maybe parading their kids around fulfills some sense of unfulfilled potential on their part. Whatever the case: child stardom from a standpoint of labor and psychological well being is  wrong .  Think of all those creepy commercials that feed off of our natural affection for innocent children to part us from our pocketbooks. Think of "Mikey" on the cereal commercials. Think of the  Oscar Meyer  kid.  Effective, no? I'll bet you're humming that tune right now at the keyboard. We certainly do not need children pitching cold cuts on tv.  But what about acting? That is harder, I think, to pull off such a ban in a modern democracy. I think that children on tv or in film should be restricted  in some manner . I know what you're thinking:  The Corsair has finally let his totalitarian roots show.  But taken from the standpoint that 7 year old kids do not work in mines, maybe we can do something  urlLink about this .  I don't mean  ban  kids from the movies altogether: I just mean set it up so that a kid under, say, 14 has to justify the labor, perhaps in front of a judge in family court even. If the director or central casting can argue to the judge that the role is a learning experience that will benefit the child even as it benefits the box office, then, fine.  Why is The Corsair bringing this up now? Two words and one name:  Michael Jackson . Michael Jackson was a child star who gave up his childhood to enrich his freaky parents. Somewhere along the line his whole mindset got haywired and we are in the mess we are in now.  And it's not just Michael Jackson. Child stars are menaces to society. For every relatively successful person like  Danny Bonaduce  (who has his issues) there are tragedies like  Dana Plato ,  Todd Bridges  and the rest of them. In fact, the only people whom I have ever seen defending child actors are their whacked out parents on, say,  Maury Pauvich  or  Oprah . We all are averse to child stars -- whether the freaky mousekateers who evolve into plastic life forms, or the sitcom cuties who evolve into  Scott Baio's .  Don't even mention  Halley Joel Osment . After losing his Oscar bid Osment is said to have broken down into uncontrollable tears. So much so that he didn't stop until  Harrison Ford  offered him a part in his next movie, which ultimately never panned out (hey, it's a tough town). Either Osment was being genuine in his severe dejection at the loss, or he was crazy like a fox and either position is not what we as Americans want for our children.   Let's make it a court issue for people to thrust their children into the entertaionment media.

       Why Is Eisner Still At Disney?   Wasn't November supposed to be the month that Eisner either showed some miraculous growth numbers for  urlLink Disney  or he was to be shown the door?  urlLink Sheesh .

Michael Wolff  made an interesting comment on Eisner a while ago in his column in  New York .    Eisner has made himself indispensible at Disney. He has a large amount of shares and, like an African dictator, he has never groomed a succesor. So it would be hard to fire Eisner without greatly affecting the already bad stock price.  Sad that a public company has to be held hostage to the Hollywood tactics of a real punk like Michael Eisner. Will the Board of Directors react? only time will tell.

       Jay McInerney Slurps   I have two recurring dream-reality issues. One, I believe that there was a cartoon in which  Laverne and Shirley  are trapped on an island with a pig as a marine sargeant. Everyone tells me there was no such thing, but I am sure it is not a dream,  this was an actual cartoon . Am I going crazy?   Anyhoo:  the second issue is that  Jay McInerney  was actually a wine columnist for  House and Garden . This book of his is a collection of his columns and is  urlLink surprisingly bad .  Like his mentor,  Norman Mailer , McInerney thinks that because he can write he has the authority to write about anything .... even subject matter of which he clearly has no grasp.  He goes on for 278 pages and expects us to fork over $24.95 so that he can associate himself with fine wine in gassy verbiage.  To know the meaning of a good belly laugh,  The Corsair  suggests you read McInerney's chapter on port.   Jay,  why don't you just admit you don't know what the fuck you're talking about?

       Gurley's Figured Our David Brooks   I like  George Gurley . He writes these somewhat pronographic little asides in the  Observer .  Well, now he takes on  David Brooks .  I can't figure this guy out. He is a great writer with a keen eye on the materialism and shallowness of urban liberals in  Bobos in Paradise , but what is he doing suing the New York Times Op Ed Pages to continue his  epater la bourgoisie ? It's odd, to say the least.  Well, I'm tired of racking my brains on this,  urlLink Gurley has a clue .

       Harold Bloom Blasts Steven King    Rush and Moloy  report that the beloeved superintellectual Harold Bloom is upset that  Steven King  is getting the  urlLink National Book Foundation Award  (whatever that is).  Bloom, perhaps the greatest living explainer of  Shakespeare  now living, should take heart. We love Bloom's interpretation of Falstaff and Hamlet. Dear Bloom, nowadays these book thingies, from  The Oprah Club  to the  Kelly Ripa Club  (like Oprah and Kelly are depleting Barnes and Noble stocks) are just ways to get people in this country to tear away from the tv sets and read a little, expand the old attention span.  Shakespeare is forever, Dr. Bloom, Steven King is to get people to open a book.

       Our Eminem Problem   My sister, the excellent  Elizabeth Mwangaguhunga  is drawing up a petition against Eminem in light of his revealed  urlLink racist tape .   It was too good to be true in a way. I mean, how many trailer park lower middle class angry white men are there who harbor no racist feeling? As black radio stations clamour to defend the young Eminem and  Dr. Dre   seriously reconsiders his street cred, some questions ought to be asked.  One: Why did it take so long for Eminem to admit he made racist rap songs?  Two: What was he thinking? Did he think a racist rap song would get air play on the anti-black radio station?  Three: Why is Eminem playing this off as a "The Source hates me" issue and not tackling it head on?  I cannot say I am a fan of Eminem, but I feel sorry for him as he has a formidable opponent in my sister.

       Michael Jackson is Going to Jail   This time  Michael Jackson  is not going to see  The Wiz , no, this time Michael Jackson is going straight to  OZ.  No amount of moonwalking will get him out of it. Can you imagine Jacko in a moist Oz-like environment? In prison, it is said, child molesters are considered the lowest of the low. Even criminals, it appears, have standards.  So Michael Jackson, who is 90 pounds soaking wet, will eat and sleep with  Addebezzi -like characters, with the  Chuck Zitos  of the world if, of course, he does not just head straight ot Algiers or Morocco. This will not harden the composer of "Ben," it will, quite frankly kill him.   Not that I am a fan of Jacko. He has been a well known child molester for years. In the diaries of his last "conquest", Michael Jackson was said to be obsessed with the young  Macauley Culkin  . Jesus.   I just question whether having him die in a maximum security prison is the way to solve the societal problem of Michael Jackson.

       David Brooks Bitchslaps The "Cognoscenti"    David Brooks  is a strange kind of conservative. His  urlLink Bobos in Paradise  was a brilliant sociological skewering of the typical Upper West Side liberal phoney, but now he turns his eye on the cultural elite ... from the  urlLink Op Ed section of The New York Times . Hmmm.  Note to David: You cannot get more cultural elitist than the NY Times.   Anyhoo:  David peppers his column with mentions of  Vogue ,  InStyle ,  Diana Vreeland ,  Helmut Lang ,  Anna Wintour ,  and even  Kate Spade  gift bags. So,  The Corsair  has to ask: who is David speaking to? Every damned week without fail  Brooks slaps us around with mentions of the magazines, pop cultural names, brands, of the NY-LA-DC elites as if it is a mortal sin or something to like that sort of thing. David:  One does not go to hell for eating arugula !  I mean, is Brooks talking to the Evangelical Republican small businessman in Colorado? Or is he yelling at the Manhattan cultural elite here?  The Corsair  is confused.  Whatever the case, Brooks' casual references to Givenchy, Manolo Blahnik  suggest more than a passing familiarity with the "cognoscenti."

       Michael Hirschorn Makes Good On VH1   I have to admit that I don't really remember what  VH1  was like before it was cool. I vaguely recollect aging rock star video. Bad videos.  Very bad videos .   Don't get me wrong: I love  Dylan's Jokerman  and  Jagger and Midler's Beast of Burden , but on the radio. They do not translate well on celluloid. Remember  The Stone's Undercover of the Night ? Mick and Keith and the crew go down to some  urlLink Latin American country for some political intrigue ?  Yeah, Riiight.  What were they thinking? The only way Mick is going to some Latin American country is to knock up some supermodels! Please, baby, please,  no aging rock star videos !    Anyhoo:   Michael Hirschorn  is the man responsible for making  urlLink VH1 cool  and irony laden.  Hirschorn filled the programming with Countdowns and Nostalgia and Irony and Snark: a healthy diet for the Gen Xer. We like Mike here at  The Corsair .

       My Trio   I guess  Joe Klein  is an okay guy. I've never met him. He seems to have a bit of a wit, for someone who works at  Time Magazine , the world's capitol of gravitas and all that. In the end, there is nothing wrong with Joe Klein that a robust multivitamin couldn't remedy. But what was he thinking when  Trio TV  gave him the  urlLink gig of a lifetime ? I mean, who wants to watch endless hours of  Battle of the Network Stars ? Who even watched Battle of the Network stars back then, when  Telly Savalas  and  Gabe Kaplan  had juice? Not me: and I was a hip 6 year old. Who loves ya, baby?  Now, If  Laura Zalaznick  of Trio Tv called  The Corsair  (call me, Laura, call ... me ...) and asked: What low budget high quality shows would you program for Trio TV? Remember, we only have a fraction of the network budgets, but we want high quality. I would say: Laura,  have you ever read my blog? I am all about low budget high quality.    Anyhoo : These are some of my picks:   Masterpiece Theater: Last of the Mohicans . No, not the cheesy Michael Mann MTV video. This is the real deal. The French and Indian War. The drama. For some bizarre reason the Masterpiece Theater programs made in the 7os -- arguably the best programming of all time -- languish in somneone's vault.   Alice:  I've always wondered if this was a comedy or a tragedy or a "dramedy", that significant 70s cultural artifact. A single mom who sings Bradway showtunes working to support her kid in Arizona on diner tips. If you take out the laugh track, this could easily be a  David Lynchian  show, no? Without the laugh track it could be an American drama drenched in pathos, like  Dreiser's   Sister Carrie . Don't even get us started on the great  Vic Tayback  banging the pick up bell with his spatula like the true character actor he was.   Rich Man Poor Man:  Observe  Nick Nolte  before the fermented grape stole his looks. Then again,  there is charm in Nolte's whiskey ravaged grim visage.   Poldark:   This cult British tv series is habit forming. Incredible. Just  urlLink incredible .   Assorted Good Times episodes:  Come on, you know you had a crush on  Wilona  when you were kid, don't you; or, if you were a girl,  Bookman the janitor  was your long cold drink of water.  The one where Michael gets drunk off some "elixir" was a classic. So was the episode when James has hypertension. So was ... hey ... was this  urlLink a comedy or what ?   The Big Blue Marble:  My favorite show as a kid, if you must know.   Carl Sagan's Cosmos:   Okay, so in the madcap world of astrophysics  urlLink Sagan's hypotheses are probably all outmoded already . So what? This series was the bomb! Classics do not get outmoded. We want astrophysics!   Fame the TV Series : Why are there not repeats on  VH1  already? When you say low budget and high quality I think ..  right here's where you start paying for it ... with pain ... and sweat .   Schoolhouse Rock:   The Figure Eight . Mysterious, melancholy and mathematically instructional.   The Black Stallion:  This Coppolla produced flic is perhaps the most beautiful filmed movie ever.   The Gore Vidal-Bill Buckley Fight  It was in the heart of the 60s. The left and the right clash violently  on national television . A classic.   Woody Allen's Teleplay: Don't Drink the Water.  One of the most interesting experiments ever.  Woody Allen  directs and writes a teleplay starring  Michael J Fox  and the kid who played  Blossom .  Okay, so those are some of my Trio picks. And you have to admit it is a hell of a lot better than  Battle of the Network Stars .

       The Real World: Done   Finally, after years of vicariously watching that overdone  Bunim and Murray  confection where twentysomethings are "hooking up," I can honestly say I'm over  The Real World . Gag me with a fork, I am done. Watching plants produce oxygen could easily top  The Real World Paris  as far as sheer excitement.   I'm not sure why I ever began to watch this show. Possibly peer pressure: the need to chat at the water cooler with the other fact checkers and editors over those crazy Gen Y nudists. I guess in the beginning, before we all became jaded on reality tv shows like a hobo on muscatel, there was something going on .  The Real World was my crystal meth. And it was good while it lasted, I suppose, as tweaks go.  But I'm over it . I mean, everyone would like to watch attractive twentysomethings get amorous -- wouldn't that explain the porn boom? It's just that watching these pretty but dim bulbs start "businesses" and compete against each other and get on each others nerves is just a bit of a snooze. Soap operas have better plots.  The Greeks were great with wisdom.  Cephalus  quotes  Sophocles  the playwright and poet in  The Symposium  as follows:    Cephalus : . . . "I was present . . . one time when someone asked the poet  Sophocles : "How are you in regard to sex, Sophocles? Can you still make love to a woman?" Hush man, the poet replied, I am very glad to have escaped from this, like a slave who has escaped from a mad and cruel master." I thought then that he was right, and I still think so, for a great peace and freedom from these things come with old age . . . . (329 c)."  Well, at 32 I don't need the viagra yet, but like Sophocles I am free from the tyranny of the cruel master  The Real World . Basta!

       Michael Wolff: Media Person of the Year    "Today's vast world of media is shaped by many bold and audacious personalities," says  I Want Media . "But which individual most deserves to be recognized for his or her impact on the media in 2003? "    The Corsair  thinks  Michael Wolff  was clearly the media person of the year. Audacious? Wolff! Wolff won the  National Magazine Award  in 2002 for columns and commentary. Then, this year Wolff stunned the world's media by making controversial statements about  CENTCOM  during the  Second Gulf War , asking  General Vincent Brooks,  "I mean no disrespect, but what is the value proposition of these briefings. Why are we here? Why should we stay? What's the value of what we're learning at this million dollar press centre?"   Audacious!   Wolff also stunned the snarky and highly envious New York Media clique when it was revealed that he makes more than  $450,000  a year from his gig at  New York Magazine . And, to add salt to our wounded pride, he is currently in the thick of a  urlLink bid to buy the aforementioned New York,  thus transforming us all from fancy free scribblers to  Masters of Our Own Fate .     Autumn of the Moguls , his paean to media moguls, was published in November 2003 to generally good reviews. In fact, Wolff declared the  New York Times Book Review  dead, and, later they gave Autumn of the Moguls a positive review. And even though he called  Miramax  honcho  Harvey Weinstein  a "thug," that gangster of New York still attended  urlLink Michael's book party  at -- where else -- Michael's. That's "juice."   He buried the hatchet with  Barry Diller  and he analyzed  Tina Brown's  rough year, but in the end Michael Wolff looked down from all of this media hooplah from his  Table No. 5  looking pretty solid. In fact, very solid.   Maybe we should all be wanna-be mogul's? Send your nominees to:    feedback@iwantmedia.com

       Hollywood Studio Heads Hijack Indie Oscar Hopes   If anyone hasn't sold out yet it is  Eugene Hernandez  and the folks at  urlLink IndieWIRE . But it seems that even the Indie mini-studios are in trouble.   Jack Valenti , head of the  Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA)  (hasn't he been in power for, like, as long as an African dictator?)  has finalized the controversial awards season screener ban which "will only allow tapes for members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences."  In recent years, indie films that might have been overlooked by screeners have recieved nominations. The studio heads of  Dreamworks ,  MGM ,  New Line ,  Paramount ,  Sony ,  Fox ,  Universal ,  Disney  and  Warner Bros  have been criticized by indie luminaries, including:   Darren Aronofsky ,  Todd Field ,  Richard Kelly , producers  Mary Jane Skalski ,  Jeremy Thomas ,  Eric Watson , and  Eden Wurmfeld , and actors  Maggie Gyllenhaal ,  Peter Sarsgaard  and  Sissy Spacek .  Kevin Iwashina ,  Peter Levine  and  Jason Tuchinsky  from  CAA ,  John Lesher  from  Endeavor ,  Julie Yorn  and  Adam Schulman  from The Firm, and David Schiff from  UTA    among others.  While Valenti uses the the anti-piracy argument, there is  no question  that this ruling will all but shut out the smaller independent features for Oscar awards, or even Oscar nominations.

       Norman Mailer: That Spooky Fart"   Oh dear  Jesus .  Norman Mailer , the countercultural literary hero and self proclaimed "heavyweight champion of writing" has suffered a TKO in his latest piece of ... " urlLink work " called  Modest Gifts: Poems and Drawings .    The Corsair  may blast  The New York Press  from time to time, but  Alexander Zaitchik's  vivisection of Mailer's new money making scheme is  urlLink right on the money .   It takes a lot of nerve to expect $14.95 for this crock of shit. It doesn't even appear as if Mailer has ever tried to learn how to draw, or sketch, or whatever it is he is hoisting on us. His poetry is, as usual, uninspired, self indulgent and stupid. Mailer's got a lot of alimony payments and so maybe that's why he is hawking his wares in this untoward manner.   I guess that the venerated writer -- now past 80 years on Earth -- is so great that we should be happy to snatch up the scaps from his table from on high in  P-Town . One should marvel in the godlike grandeur of his sloppy scribblings and adolescent, undisciplined poetry, for he is  Mailer , he is our great American of Letters.  After publishing  That Spooky Art , a weak cut and paste job worthy of anything  William Burroughs  produced in his last days (and that's not saying much), one should have seen this coming. In his senectitude Mailer has morphed from hipster to hustler, selling us knock of writing for real literature. Do not buy this book, dear readers,  The Corsair  has spoken.  Norman Mailer's  Modest Gifts  is not a book to be tossed aside lightly, to paraphrase  Dorothy Parker ,  it should be thrown with great force !

       How Come Movies on the Media Don't Do Well?   Maybe we are all just navel-gazing at ourselves? It is a possibility. How else to explain why we love movies on the media than nearly everyone else in the Western world does? I was wondering how come movies dealing with the media --  i.e. journos, djs, talking heads, editors  -- don't do so hot in their cumulative box office numbers?   Almost Famous , which is perhaps the most beloved journo movie of this age, had a cumulative box office of a measley $31.7 million.  Elf  made that much on its opening weekend!  Even that Steven Glass movie  Shatterd Glass  has earned only about  $269,898 , despite tons of media attention, including  Hayden Christiansen  appearing on  Reliable Sources , as well as tons of raves in everything mediacentric from  Interview  to  The Observer .   Veronica Guerin  hasn't even earned more than $10 million yet, depite -- t ellingly  -- critical and media raves.  Howard Stern's   Private Parts  only earned $40 million, despite his being on every cover imaginable (Can you say  overexposure ? Can you say  ultraoverexposure ? Then again, exposed private parts and Stern go hand in hand,  so to speak ).   Woody Allen  often spoofs the lives of television writers and we all know of his dismal box office numbers, which fly in the face of his East Coast media acclaim.   Let's face it, my fellow media monkeys  we in the media and of the media love ourselves a lot more than the heartland loves us . Don't feel bad, though, cultural elites: I love you, baby.  The Corsair  will always love you and cover your snarkiness with affection. Now, bookmark us.

       Is This The End of Dan Rather?    urlLink Today's Drudge Report   has as it's headline, " DAN RATHER MAY END ANCHOR RUN NEXT YEAR ." It goes on to say, "Executives plot late '04 departure of CBS star... 'After the election, we are looking at changes,' a top network source tells DRUDGE... "  Wow.  Now,  The Corsair  has to take this with a pinch of salt as Drudge is well known for dropping the ball on big exclusives (remember the "exclusive" that  Eisner  and  Disney  were going to buy  Apple Computer ?)  urlLink What a howler in bad reporting .  But this could be true, as Drudge has conservative informants high up in the media Establishment, and Rather's retirement would be major news.  Let  The Corsair  count the ways in which this is a significant development. For one, In 1986, Dan Rather was stalked, pummeled and kicked on a Manhattan sidewalk by a well-dressed man who kept asking "Kenneth, what is the frequency?" On  REM's  1994's Monster album, they viciously (deliciously) parodied the line in their single hit of the same name.This bit of trivia, by the way, is  a propos  of nothing,  The Corsair  just wanted to find a use for that bit of odd arcana.  Rather has been the most hated man in television news--  the antichrist , if you will, embodying the establishment left. His softball rebuttal-free interview with  Sadaam Hussein , a tryant, did not help  urlLink reconstruct his image  in my book.  And Conservatives have some cause for this animus. In April 2001, Dan Rather helped raise $20,000 for the  Travis County Democratic Party  in Austin, Texas.   Howie Kurtz  of  The Washington Post  did a front page story, confronting Rather.   The newsman replied to criticism of his journalistic objectivity ( ABC's Jeff Greenfield , for example, once a Democrat, has renounced all partisan activity in the name of journalistic integrity), said he "wouldn't be surprised" if critics use the incident to call him a secret Democrat. "I'm going to get that criticism whether I  deserve it or not."  If conservatives are not fans of Rather, I don't see the left coming to his defense. And lefties are very good about aiding people who are defenseless, even after a roughing up by that well dressed man. But in fact they, too,  urlLink find him unpalatable .  All of this begs the question: if neither the left nor the right feels comfortable in Dan Rather's objectivity, then  why is he a Wise Man ? The Corsair always thought it had to be the hair ... that, or the nervous beady eyed creepy-unstable look that he pulls off so well.  UPDATE: Dan Rather, responding to the Drudge rumors, says  urlLink "Hell no, I won't go!"

       Jackson Victim's Story   Truly it is a day steeped in  Kierkegaardian  irony (I know what you're thinking:  with a beginning like that, where is The Corsair going with this ?) that sources like  The National Enquirer  are regularly scooping the mainstream media on the celebrity gossip trial beat that ultimately fuels viewer interest in lowest common denominator fare-- especially in these dog days of  Thanksgiving . Every damned cable talk show worth their salt is chatting about  Michael Jackson,  delivering hot air, contributing  mightily  to global warming;  you just know Geraldo is going to cover the legal angle of this even if you never turn him on . (Incidentally, does watching Geraldo's show, much like  E! Celebrity Uncensored  make you just want to take a shower? No? That's just me again? Great.)   It is culturally significant that  Bonnie Fuller   -- a media persona well ahead of the curve -- has abandoned traditional status filled glossy publications to pursue the redemption of the low market tabloid.  But then again, we have been angling towards this candy colored culture of shadenfreude for some time now.  Any society that allows a a romantic song with the chestnut lyrics " urlLink You remind me of my Jeep " to top the Billboard charts is sick, sick,  sick  and deserves what's coming to it.  And then some.    Anyhoo : Who  doesn't  like a celebrity trial is what  The Corsair  says-- it's just that, well, with  Phil Specter's  murder allegations and Jackos kid sex allegations buzzing about the ethers, things are almost a bit too ...  seedy  ... to excavate the snark from out of; do you know what I mean?    The media landscape is cluttered with high grade humorless celebrity felonies (see today's  Page Six  cartoon), it reminds me of New York City under  Mayor Ed Koch . Think:  Streethawks , starring  Sylvester Stallone  and  Billy Dee Williams .  Seedy!  It's almost too sad to comment upon.   Almost!   Alexis de Tocqueville  hinted that democratic levelling may lead us to this 'culture of ogling cosmetically-altered criminally minded freaks straight out of central casting for  Fellini's Satyricon ,' only he didn't use that particular phrasing. If anything,  The Corsair  loves to translate the classics into today's language. And if  Howie Kurtz  is talking to  James Wolcott  about  Michael  and  Majestik , well, then, it cannot be completely taboo.  Perhaps "celebrity justice" is a natural byproduct of democracy in this sense: the public joy, or at least, the public fascination with the ridicule of the famous provides a release valve for resentments over the natural differences in wealth and excellence. As a  very  public act, almost a  holy excorcism of resentment , the celebrity trial  affirms that  we are indeed all equal before the eyes of the law , and  riches don't really make you happy , right?   Suuure .   urlLink The National Enquirer  now has the story (or, "the SHOCKING story," as they describe it after the tabloidian manner) of Jackson's alleged victim. Apparently, nude photos of the boy were taken. The Enquirer describes their particular brand of journalism in this way:  "The issue that goes on sale Friday discloses how the boy's 'hostage' mom escaped from Michael's  Neverland  ranch, chronicles Michael's non-stop  Las Vegas  partying with young boys in the days before his arrest ... and much, much more."  Not just much, says the noble Enquirer, but "much, much": Joy to the world.

Afterwards I took a lot of antibiotics and prayed for the best."

       Madonna and Time Warner Culture   "At the party to introduce  Sex , (then  Time Warner  CEO)  Jerry Levin  arrived dressed for the occasion in a ( Warner Brothers ) baseball jacket. Entering he saw an actress bent over to receive a tattoo on her butt. He saw transvestites gyrating upon pedestals in leather corsets. He saw  Madonna  herself, led around on a leash till she bumped into Jerry, one bewildered looking executive. Others from the  Time  background, who had seen their careers reporting on world catastrophes, had seen it all, from Crimean mass rape to the Salk vaccine, seen it all then been able to golf a round on Sunday, felt disgust. ' Sex  was a low point in publishing,'  Marty Payson  opined. 'Everyone associated with the company was embarassed about that.' Her book stiffled. Madonna's companion album, Erotica, became the most returned in WEA memory."    Exploding: The Highs, Hits, Hype, Heroes, and Hustlers of the Warner Music Group by Stan Cornyn and Paul Scanlon.

       Tucker Carlson On Fame   "Hardest of all to get used to, though, was the loss of anonymity in public. Working in television is like having your picture in the Post office. People you've never seen before know what you look like.  "I didn't fully comprehend the consequences of this until I flew to Italy for a friends wedding. Thanks to bad weather I wound up spending quite a bit of time in the Paris airport. One beer led to another, and by the time I boarded the flight to Florence, I'd definitely been drinking. I wasn't embarrassingly wino drunk, though I was dirty and unshaven. I was, however, impared enough not to notice that there was a large Moroccan man seated between me and the aisle.  "Not long after takeoff, I had to go to the bathroom fairly desperately. (Savvy travellers, I've since learned, don't drink four liters of beer before getting on airplanes). By this time, the Moroccan guy was asleep, completely passed out and snoring. Rather than wake him I decided to climb over his seat. Stepping from one armrest to the other, I made it successfully.  "I had no such luck on my way back. Years later I convinced myself that the plane had turbulence just as I was standing over the sleeping man. I'll never know for sure. I do know that somehow I lost my balance and wound up falling knees-first into his lap.  "He woke up screaming. I didn't understand the precise meaning of his words, but I got the general point. He yelled in the intercontinental language of pain, fear and confusion. I tried to apologize, but this seemed to make him more agitated.   "He didn't stop shouting until I got off his lap, which wasn't easy. It was a loud moment.  "But not so loud I couldn't hear my own name spoken in a stage whisper from three rows back. It was a group of American tourists. They were staring at me. "That's definitely him," said one. "I saw him on CNN last week."   Tucker Carlson ,  Politics, Partisans and Parasites.

       Janice Dickinson: Sexing the Stars   No, dear readers:  The Corsair  is not way behind the curve on this one; he is fully aware that  Janice Dickinson's  smouldering autobiography  No Lifeguard on Duty  has been out for a while --  but since the holidays -- the slow days -- are here: let's recap the juicy bits .   Before we begin,  The Corsair  ran into Dickinson midtown two summers ago. She is very beautiful in a scary, dark and highly aggressive older woman way. The Corsair checked out her, uhm, assets, as she passed, and, within moments, Dickinson turned as well and returned and met this noble chronicler with a ferocious stare. This woman is not to be trifled with! Grrr...   urlLink So, briefly, here is what we learn .  Bill Cosby  flies a fluffy supermodel out to Vegas to open up for him as a singer (yes, that is sketchy). The married Cosby comes to her room and hits on her -- she turns him down -- and he yells at her saying, angrily: "After all I've done for you, that's what I get?"    urlLink Dickinson  renders  Warren Beatty  in the sad reflection of the mirror of his vanity. Trapped in the reflection, Beatty stares at himself; plays with his hair -- for an hour or so -- after coitus with Dickinson (He's so vain; I bet he thinks this blog is about him):  "I woke up a few hours later, at around three in the morning, Warren wasn't in bed. I looked across the room and found him admiring himself in the mirror.  "'What are you doing,' I asked in a sleepy voice.'  "'Nothing,' he said, but he couldn't take his eyes off himself. He ran his hands through his hair, staring at his own reflection in the mirror, . I went back to sleep, in the morning, when I woke up, he was  standing there again, playing with his hair, mussing it; trying to get it just right -- going for that just-been-fucked look. I guess he thought he was pretty too."    Helmut Newton  approached her at a pool one time and asked her to "take off her clothes." To which she responded, "fuck you, you dirty old perv."   Calvin Klein  fires her for taking Qualudes before a fashion show, saying, "you will never work with me again, Janice, you have my solemn promise on that."  Janice slept (if that is the right word) with  Mick Jagger  all night long: " The man was indefatigable ... He was pure energy -- kind of spooky., to tell you the truth. I woke up the next morning feeling like I'd been through a war."   Sylvester Stallone , who Janice has sex with, likes to refer to the act as "bam ham slam" thinking -- sadly --  urlLink that this is witty .  If you never got the book, it makes for a great  urlLink Christmas present .   If this is old news,  hey, just remember, good gossip is forever.

       How Bush Made His Secret Iraq Trip Happen    Democrats  and  Republicans  and even  Greens  can all,  I hope , appreciate that our President made his top secret trip to visit our demoralized troops in Iraq yesterday at high risk, for that special  Thanksgiving  meal.   Matt Drudge , who is becoming increasingly influential among media types, what with his web exclusives and that infamous  K Street  "non appearance ( James Carville  threatening to kick his invisible ass via his answering machine for naming  Mary Matalin , his  very dark  wife, as a possible White House leaker to uber-grouch Washingtonian beltway insider  Robert Novack )" -- anyway, Drudge gives us the meaty scoop with the help of the raw press pool notes of  Washington Post  reporter  Mike Allen's   urlLink  on his site.   Drudge described the event, thus:  "  General Sanchez  said, 'God bless you for all of your sacrifices,' and hurriedly introduced  Ambassador Bremer . Bremer said he had Thanksgiving greetings from the President. But then Bremer, hamming it up, looked toward stage left and said, 'Let's see if we've got anyone more senior here.' Then the President came out and the room erupted even before he reached the stage ..."  The account is very interesting. One of the most interesting passages from the notes comes from a quote from  Communications Director   Dan Bartlett  , who told the Press on Air Force One:  "It is absolutely critical, when we land, that you do not open your windows. Particularly as we land and when we're on the ground, we want no light emanating from the plane. We will not be pulling up to a terminal ... We will be stopping at the end of the runway. It's just important that we move quickly, do not open up the windows to illuminate any light."

       Lawrence Taylor Turned Tricks    The Corsair  is in  Boston  now, don't ask us why. After the turkey, the triptophan and the family, he is in full  pundit  mode (or as the cool  Michael Hirschorn  might say,  talent -mode), pondering deeply the issue of  Lawrence Taylor , who has admitted to  urlLink sending call girls to the hotel rooms of opposing team players to wipe them out before the big game.     Apparently, contingent upon payment, said ladies of the evening were ordered to give the poor saps a "full night" of, um,  athleticism . Holey moley, thinks  The Corsair , jaded, with only the faintest whiffs of snark implied: And this nugget is airing on the prestigious  60 Minutes , of all venues. What is the media coming to?  "You know what they like and what type of women they like and you just call the service," Taylor tells the ancient, pharaonic  Mike Wallace .    The Corsair  believes that this is a stroke of evil genius right out of  Sun Tsu  and cannot decide whether this story is a worthy object of opprobrium or mirth.    Alls fair in love and football.

       Madonna Loses Her Accent!   It's official:  Madonna  has lost her faux British accent. Wednesday night, as  The Corsair  sat among family preparing for a big turkey feast, he got a pleasant surprise. On  Jay Leno's  late night show, Madonna dicussed her career not like a 50s movies star, but in a sort of  Los Angeles Valley girl hipster  accent.  What's up with that?  "This is a job," Madonna told Jay she advised  Britney Spears  , "this is not your life."   But the Material girl, with her  red Kabbala string  firmly affixed to her well toned wrist, seemed to slip in and out of her accent. Whenever The Material One was asked, for example, to deliver pronouncements on the state of celebrity or the like ... slowly ... very slowly ... the accent veered back into  Oxbridge  via the  Paramount  lot, circa  The Rat Pack  days. Hmm.   The Corsair  can understand. Madonna, as a "pop artist" and, more specifically, a  singer  is a sort of amorphous self (The Corsair has dated enough "actresses" to know the drama involved in the craft).    Maddy began as a NY downtown hipster by way of the  University of Michigan  (dance) and spoke accordingly in that familiar urban cool patois; then she was  Mrs. Penn  and hid from the paparazzi, demurely, as her id-driven  Marlon Brando  wannabe husband issued unpredictable beat downs accompanied by thuglike Quest For Fire grunts; then she was reinvented in the  Latina  phase (The Lost Years), where La Madonna provocatively hung around attractive gay dancers, played  Truth or Dare , and engaged in  epater le bourgoisie  against our outmoded Victorian sexual mores (excuse  us !);   Now, stroll with me through the gallery of Madonna's hip hop mogul Maverick record era( "Music makes the bourgoisie and the rebel ...") , replete with the overflowing  Cristal ,  Guy Oseary  and  Ingrid Cesares  rubbing up against her on the aquarium dancefloor as sharks and tropical fish frolic underneath unawares, baskeball players undressing,  Jose Canseco  leaving her house at 6am, ah those "bling bling" days in Miami --the blessed  excess ... back, when the Clinton economy was  huuge .    Things have gotten more domestic. Now, Madonna does dinner with  Prince Charles , has  urlLink a mansion  and her British babies with overrated underground director  Guy Ritchie .   Is this where the great adventuress Madonna ends her days: shipwrecked on the somewhat ordinary shores of la Isla Bonita?  In Britain, with babies, a moderately successful Britisher husband, eating boiled food and practicing the Kabbala in a draughty old mansion?   The Corsair  cannot help but wonder if  urlLink Madge is fed up with Britain . I mean, if she is no longer speaking in the accent, how much longer can the nation  itself  fare in her restless artistic consciousness?   So what will be the next  Madonna Period ? Will it be a melancholic Blue Period, like  Picasso ? Will she have a polo playing period, like the hapless pump-wielding  Sylvester Stallone ? She never really did have a hip hop period -- I mean,  urlLink she did "date"   Tupac Shakur  and all, but she was never really immersed. How about a younger guy, Madge, like  Demi's Ashton  or  Cameron Diaz's Justin ?  Who knows with the unpredictable Ms. Ciccone. Who knows, indeed.

       Val Kilmer: Uber-Creepy   Oh, and a propos of nothing: How creepy is  Val Kilmer ? I don't know why this thought came to me but let's lay it on the table and deal with it, shall we?  It's not his quirky roles, like  Batman ,  Jim Morrison  or porn "star"  urlLink John Holmes , although it contributes to his general oddness.  No, that's not it. By Hollywood standards Val isn't  that  freaky, either: I mean, he didn't seduce  Cher  when she was 16, like  urlLink Warren Beatty did .  It's just a  general impression  Val gives off; you know,  psycho  vibes. Even supermodel airhead  Cindy Crawford , his ex-girlfriend, hinted at it when she described him as "intense" (which, translated by  The Corsair  means nuttier than  Martin Lawrence  wearing several jump suits and jogging in LA during several summers ago, to lose weight for a movie role).  Mark my words, Val Kilmer is very, very strange.

       Russell Crowe at Strip Club    urlLink Testosterone feuled A Lister   Russell Crowe  was spotted at a well named strip club called the  Dollhouse  according to  Jeanette Walls  of  MSNBC . His pregnant wife  Danielle Spencer  wasn't in attendance. Now, such things are not felonies, Uma used to let Ethan go to Scores all the time (and look how that worked out).  Crowe and his entourage, however, freaked out when they saw cameras. Feeling a little -- how does one say this?--  guilty ? Call  The Corsair  cynical, but  I do not think Crowe was built for monogamy .   Okay, I'll say out loud what you're all thinking:  it must be a slow newsday for Ol' Corsair.

       Celebrity Mug Shots   While we are on  The Smoking Gun ,  The Corsair  particularly like their page devoted to  urlLink Celebrity Mug Shots.     Noelle Bush  is a heinous one (then again what do you expect from such an .. intrusive ... "impromptu photo shoot"). And disgraced Congressman  James Trafficant , with his toupee all aloft, may answer the very cool  Elzabeth Spier's   question as to whether or not  Michael Jackson  will be allowed to keep his prosthetic nose in the clink.    Dana Plato's  mugshot made me sad.  Wynona Judd's   Kinda freaked me out; it definitely harshed my mellow. But then I gazed at  Carmen Electra's   mugshot and everything was right in the world again.

       Kabbala Red String Theory   Those cats at  The Smoking Gun  are at it again! Scooping the mainstream press, they give us the goods on  Paris Hilton , who, when she is not wearing a black wig and  keeping it on the down low , is wearing  urlLink Kabbala red string to ward off bad mojo .  Now I know what I want for Christmas: some  Kabbala red string!    The Observer's   Simon Doonan   was a  urlLink precog on the Kabbala thing , but he has another plan for Partis' image rehabilitation:  " FINAL DAY :  First outing . No, not the  Ivy  or the  Kabbalah Centre   ( The Corsair  is shiverring now, because Doonan wrote this days before the fact) or some other tragically trendy, paparazzi’d destination: I’m talking about lunch at  Le Deli Grandeville , a public eatery located in the basement of 450 West 33rd Street. This inappropriately monikered, unglamorous canteen feeds a wide spectrum of earnest hard-working New Yorkers, including the employees of  Lerners ,  Channel 13  and Doubleclick.  Le Deli Grandeville  will be Ms. Hilton’s big opportunity to find out, via supervised conversations, how the other half live."  Hey, Doonan, can you gaze into your crystal ball and tell me if you see  The Corsair  hooking up with the  BBC's  sexy Washington Correspondent  Katty Kay ?

       Page Six Rocks!    The Corsair   has always been a fan of  Page Six . In fact, if he does not get his daily Page Six fix for whatever reason, he gets cranky. But to my surpise, today's Page Six is  urlLink particularly juicy .  We read about  P Diddy  declaring himself the  Big Maverick Award  at  VH1 , a drunken  Farah Fawcett  (which remind The Corsair about the  Joe Esterhaus  tale of Farah peeing against a tree in Hollywood; Farah is very strange even for an  Aquarius ) and  Queen Elizabeth  is furious at  President Bush . Thank you  God , for allowing there to be a Page Six.

       Are Corporate Magazines the New Black?   Hey, what's up with corporate magazines? They are attracting some top drawer talent these days. First, the Elder Brother of the New York media elite  Kurt Andersen  went to  Colors , which, admittedly, is not your  typical  corporate magazine; and, for that matter, neither is  Bergdorf Goodman , which is where, among other places, the very cool  Michael Gross  is nesting.  Magazines sponsored by a corporation allow their editors more freedom,  The Corsair  imagines. Then, of course, there is that persnikety question of  moolah ,  cheddar , cash. In this media environment magazines are losing dollars by the fistful and advertisers aren't what they used to be in those glossy, glossy cyber 90s, or even the razzle dazzle  Reagan  years.  One doesn't have to worry about that when you've got a single cash infused entity writing the checks and asking only for the prestige,  the face  of a top notch editor.  It's a good move on all sides,  The Corsair  thinks:  iconic brands  with  great editors . It is a sort of  Medici -like interlocking structure of artist and patron where everyone involved gets a piece of the action.  So, who is next?  Michael Kinsley  at  Apple Magazine ?  Tina Brown  at The  Manolo Blahnik Quarterly ?  Richard Johnson  at  Jaguar ?  The possibilities are endless.

       Graydon Carter: Libertarian Chic   I know, the shrill preachiness of  Ayn Rand  gave them a bad name. A  geeky  name. But now, several decades after the fact,  Graydon Carter , arbiter of DC-LA urbane, the " daddio of cool " (sorry,  Tina ) is here to resurrect our favorite  urlLink third party from obscurity .   Atlas be Shrugged :  La Graydon  is a Libertarian! Get Carter.  And here I always thought of  Libertarians  as your prototypical milk dud munching, pocket protector wearing,  Cato Institute  joining, economics majoring   Ludwid Von Mises   quote machines. Noooo: that image is so  Night of January the 16th ; the new libertarian is  John Gault  with  Saville Row  suits and an architectonic haircut;  de groovy . The new libertarian edits a  Conde Nast  glossy. Hey, even businessmen need a defender.  While  We the Living  go on with our silly  Anthems  about smokers rights and the rightness of the war in Iraq, capitalist libertines everywhere can cheer, because Graydon Carter,  The Voice of Reason , is looking out for captains of industry and Hollywood stars from the Editor's Letter page at  VF .  Basta!  (PS: You know we only kid you, Graydon, because we are fond of you)

       Apologia Pro Laura Zalaznick    Laura Zalaznick , prexy of  Trio TV   is becoming quite the celebrity in here. Anyway, if you weren't logging in earlier, there was a confusing little contretemps that is now over and  I must set the record straight .   The Corsair  wishes to apologize from the bottom of his healthily ironic heart and feverish mind for raking the very cool Laura Zalaznick over the coals in a blog, since edited out, that accused her and Trio of pilfering my 70s miniseries idea without giving me any props.   Karen Reynolds , the PR person for  Universal Studios  sent us a very gentle email explaining that the 70s mini series project had been in development for over a year.  Oops. Maybe we are not the experts on the television side of the business as we thought we were? Then again, we all make mistakes.  Anyway, I posted the idea --in rough form -- on  urlLink August 2003 on Papermag.com's boards . I also emailed the idea to their programming department at  feedback@triotv.com . Then, one month later, Trio  urlLink TV issued a press release  touting basically the exact same films that I posted for a 70s mini series film series --  how wierd is that?   Anyway, I just read about the whole thing in TV Guide and said to myself: Okay, they took my idea and ran with it -- I did post it in cyberspace, the public domain, but  couldn't they at least email me a heads up? Yo What's up with that?   So, in an addled mood I posted a harsh open letter to Zalaznick and Trio but I was wrong. I swear to God, the whole thing was so  meta: it was like that What's Happening episode where Raj thinks his episode of the kids finding the bag of money is stolen by the tv executives, but he finds out that it wasn't.   Anyway,  The Corsair  still loves  his Trio .  And I guess if I was spinning this I would say The Corsair was ahead of the curve and anticipated programming at Trio. If I were spinning.   Everyone watch Trios Top Ten Miniseries Countdown over the Holiday weekend.

Then there is the image of him hanging out with  Tupac Shakur , "dating"  Camille , the current wife of  Kelsey Grammar , feuding with short fingered vulgarian  Donald Trump  ... ahh, that AJ, what a pip!

       James Wolcott Loves Majestik Magnificent   Ah, Sunday afternoon with  The Corsair : a strong Kenyan coffee ( bold  ... yet  unpretentious  ...), the monsterous  New York Times Sunday  edition sprawled across the apartment, blueberry muffins half munched ... and the piece de la resistance:   CNN's Reliable Sources  with  Howie Kurtz .  We fess up to our media geekiness.  This Sunday,  Vanity Fair's   James Wolcott , easily one of the best essayists in the english language (we love you, Wolcott, we even find that anti- Soprano  stance groovy), professed a secret love.  Now, you ask, what could an esteemed writer like Wolcott find to love?  Brian De Palma (okay,  The Corsair  did think that Wolcott was a bit wacky for claiming that B-movie schlock king Di Palma was the best living filmmaker; we reserve that for  Ingmar Bergman ) ? No, no, no: Wolcott said that he loved Michael Jackson's eccentric personal clown,  Magestik Magnificent  . Think:  P Diddy's   Farnsworth Bentley ,  urlLink but even more loyal and odd .  Howie Kurtz's eyes glazed over in a "nobody's home" kind of way when Wolcott layed out his pop culture street cred.  What the fuck is a Magestik Magnificent,  Howie seemed to be pleading out at us across the ethers before he sped along with another question.  But we at  The Corsair  know, James Wolcott, we too cannot get enough.

       What Happened to Eduard Shevardnadze?   Back in the day Crazy  Eddie Shevardnadze  was our boy -- remember that? He was down with  James Baker  and  George Bush the Elder  and even Ambassador  Vernon Walters , who used to quip that he could speak eight languages and think in none (too true, Vernon;  too true ).   Now, after two dozen years in power, Shevardnadze fell in for the old autocratic desire for unlimited power. Tant pis. But how did Shevardnadze go from being down with  those Fabulous Baker boys , all presiding over the fall of the Soviet Union into being a petty tyrant from a tiny backwater?  As a rule of thumb,   The Corsair  believes that no head of state, no matter how good, should stay beyond ten years in power.   Now, if  The Corair  could be a benevolent autocrat he would make a modified Great Books education mandatory for all public school kids :  Archimedes  and  Euclid  and  Ptolemy  Math labs; piano keyboard lessons with music appreciation featuring  Monteverdi  and  Bach  and  Beethoven  and  Coltrane ; intensive biology labs with  Harvey  and  Gray's Anatomy , supplemented by freehand drawing and painting of the torso and organs;  African dance  to get the blood flowing; kindergarteners can imitate and learn of cave drawings with charcoal; comparative world religions and myths for the kids' curiositas; and readings of the  Analects of Confucius  and Sun Tzu's Art of War and  Machiavelli's Discourses on Livy   and  Clausewitz'   On War  for political science as well as reading of the  Lincoln-Douglas  debates and the US Consitution.  Nah, who are we kidding,  The Corsair  could never be autocratic; the  PC lobby  and the teacher's unions would run me out of town faster than  Calvin Klein  can pitch woo at  Latrell Sprewell  during a  Knicks  game.

       Secret Witness Saw Jacko Abuse Boy     The National Enquirer , which has ironically become the clearinghouse for accurate and  timely  information on all things pertaining to celebrity criminality, once again scoops the competition, which often on the subject comes across as sloppy. Then again, Enquirer gossips have been at this game, hiding in the bushes, peeling through trash, flashbulbs at the ready, for some time and have something to prove: they want to clean the clocks of the  real  reporters -- you know,  those George Polk Award winning, Chardonnay sipping snobs .   Anyhoo:  The Enquirer reports that a secret witness has come forward with testimony that may put  Michael Jackson  behind bars.  urlLink According to the website :   "The secret witness was in Michael's bedroom with the singer and his alleged victim, and has told authorities he saw Jackson sexually abuse the boy, according to a source close to the case.   "The issue that goes on sale Friday details the witness' encounter with Jackson, reveals that the star tried to send the boy and his family out of the country for good"   How do they get this information?

       Rush Limbaugh's Drug Stash: Excellence in Pill Popping   The folks at  TheSmokingGun  have published a voluminous list of all the drugs and their dosages that Rush had on hand, and it looks like enough to  urlLink stun a rogue bull elephant . No, no amend that prescription: there are enough drugs involved in this list to stagger a sperm whale.   It appears that Limbaugh's long winded soliloquy's on  will power  should've contained few footnotes, say, as to the pharamceutical accompaniment to each act of will, like niacin, on lowering cholesterol, or Oxycontin if you are just  getting your high on . Checkit:  "Rush Limbaugh illegally purchased hundreds of prescription pills a month and sought a quartet of doctors to fuel his drug addiction, according to search warrant applications unsealed yesterday in  Palm Beach County Circuit Court . Investigators executing the searches, which took place November 25 at three offices used by Limbaugh's South Florida physicians, accused the radio personality of 'doctor shopping,' or improperly seeking out practitioners to supply him with an inordinate abundance of painkillers  OxyContin ,  Lorcet ,  Norco ,  Hydrocodone  and  Kadian , the anti-anxiety drug  Xanax , the cholesterol-lowering drug  Niacin , and  Clonodine , which treats high blood pressure."  Whew! Everything makes the Limbaugh cut but the  urlLink Xanthan gum !

       To "Sir" With Grudge    You could just see this one coming from out of the stadium, no?  Keith Richards , rarely the voice of reason, is a downright surly man-beast, a god of a guitar player, who is  hitting the right note   in his devastating criticism of  Mick Jagger , perhaps the coolest man in the world, but, of late, something of a whore, for accepting an honorary title from  urlLink the British establishment .  Why does  The Corsair  side with Keith over Mick in this family squabble? Let Keith tell us in his own words, as he did to  urlLink Uncut Magazine :  "'I don't want to step out on stage with someone wearing a ----ing coronet and sporting the old ermine,' declared the 59-year-old guitarist.  "I told Mick, `It's a ----ing paltry honour.'  "'I thought it was ludicrous to take one of those gongs from the establishment, when they did their best to throw us in jail.'"  And on that matter Keith Richards is  quite  correct. And  we don't know his from Adam . Recent reports indicate that  Scotland Yard   detectives trumped up drug charges against the Stones -- as well as other rock and roll associates -- urlLink  in order to get them in prison  as a little love message from the establishment.  At this point Richards, long characterized as the "elder brother" and "conscience" of the Stones, stepped up his rhetoric, hinting that the knighthood was pathetic, beneath Mick, really; and  hypocritical  besides,  to  Uncut :  "I thought it sent out the wrong message ... It's not what the Stones is about, is it?"  "If you're into this s---, hang on for the peerage," Richards sneered. 'Don't settle for a little badge.'"  Jagger's response to the attack in the  Herald Sun , was to describe Richards's views as "endearing" but sometimes " urlLink very irritating ."  The Corsair knows that growing up is selling out -- somewhat, at least; but wouldn't it be a sad world indeed, if His Satanic Majesty, the king of all hellraisers, were to run after a knightship like a cocker spaniel in search of a dog yummy? If rock stars sold their artistic statements to sneaker companies or Jaguar? If 60s icons would win the Presidency and toss aside idealism to legislate by polls?  Oh, who the fuck is Mick fooling,  keemo sabe : the 60s sold itself out  decades  ago.

       Trio TV Does It Again    Laura Zalaznick's   Trio TV , the channel for the sophisticated media junkie, takes on awards shows in December.  The Award Show Awards Show  is their latest contribution to their particular brand of refined media navel gazing.   urlLink Zalaznick's strategy  is to stay within Trio's modest budget by conconcentrating on its special programming, which is essentially, orignial narration by media insiders on some of the greatest moments in television. Not a bad idea; and not expensive.  This particular show -- focusing on  urlLink awards  -- is narrated, with wonderful ironic effect, by the delicious, if slightly bitter,  Tatum O'Neill , Oscar's youngest-ever winner in a competitive category. As a child star who was discarded by Hollywood as past expiration, Tatum is the one to discuss awards.  O'Neill developed an ulcer at 7, when her parents divorced; chased in vain after alleged pedophile  Michael Jackson ; married and divorced tennis star  John McEnroe . So you know she has got the world weary voice and battle scars that are needed to delve into this world of glitz and glamour and profit and perfect gaudiness; Tatum is particularly compelling as an analyst of America's fascination with awards shows.   Frasier Morre  at the  AP   urlLink writes :  "In 1974 (O/Neill) walked the red carpet as a 10-year-old Oscar nominee for best supporting actress in her first film,  Paper Moon .   "She even practiced weeks beforehand with her father and  Paper Moon  co-star,  Ryan  (O'Neill).   "'He wanted me to rehearse,' she recalled in a recent chat with a reporter. 'I remember him dressing me up and letting me wear platforms, which I always wanted to wear, and we pretended to walk down a red carpet.'  "But on that April 2, when she became Oscar's youngest-ever winner in a competitive category, neither parent was present. Her grandparents brought her.   "'For years I didn't think about it,' said O'Neal, 40. 'Now, today, it makes me sad.   "'Winning was a great honor,' she added. 'But the truth is, I had no idea what Oscar meant. I just knew there was a lot of people and it was gonna be a long time that I was sitting in that seat.'"   Trio is  so  definitely  in the cut ; Laura Zalaznick still feels the Boomer idealism.

       Whatever Happened to the A List?    urlLink Entertainment reporters , tabloids, shock jocks and  urlLink bloggers  have all waited paitiently for  Tom Cruise's  calculated star to fall from its celestial heights, and now that it has, it is kind of anticlimatic.  Thus far reviewers have  urlLink not been kind  to Tom Cruise's new flic  urlLink The Last Samaurai .  And, as the weekend progresses, the critics are piling on. Cruise is one of the last of a dying breed, namely:  A List celebrities .  Once our solar system was filled with such stars, now no longer. Once we had  Madonna ,  Oprah ,  Britney Spears ,  Bennifer ,  Michael Jordan ,  Jack Nicholson ,  Justin Timberlake ,  Christina Aguilera  and  Brad Pitt .  Each one of these stars has taken a beating in the past year. Jordan is a  urlLink serial adulterer , grungy  urlLink Fred Durst had sex with pristine Britney Spears ,  urlLink Jonathan Franzen bitchslapped the inscrutable Oprah ,  urlLink Madonna's Marxist British film with her husband was such a flop it wasn't even released in the UK ,  urlLink Bennifer Flopped , Aguilera's second studio album, 2002's  urlLink Stripped was a commercial flop ,  Brad Pitt  went into haitus to do his Troy film, and even  Jack Nicholson  isn't quite so nimble anymore, as he settles down, away from the camera flashbulbs with his new sweetie,  Diane Keaton , finally accepting his late middle age in interviews.  If you were to ask me -- today, December 6, 2003 -- who are the A List stars are, the people who make everyone stand at attention, especially the gossipers and East Coast media types, I would say, of the top of my head,  Al Sharpton  (the B Lister of the Democratic Party),  Paris Hilton , maybe  Halle Barre ,  Michael Jackson .    Basically , B List freaks (sorry,  Halle )  So, I guess  urlLink Radar Magazine's B List nation  was about right.  Where are you  Maer Roshan , we need your wise magazine to guide us through the upcoming celebrity freakshow.

       Al Sharpton on SNL   Oh  yes  (devilish grin widens, rubs hands together) ...  oh  yes. The funniest guy at the otherwise regrettable Democratic Party debates is taking his shtick  up in Lorne Greene's bitch . The stars are all aligned in forming a cosmic happy face. The wise men are coming from the east bearing gifts of Frankincense and Myrr.  It's Christmastime in the city and on Saturday Night,  urlLink Al Sharpton  is going to help us all get a laugh on.   "Paris Hilton," report  Rush and Molloy , "who has canceled all interviews, will join guest host the  Rev. Al Sharpton  and musical guest  Pink  on  Saturday Night Live ." All the better.  That's right:  Al Sharpton's  hosting that countercultural Baby Boomer stronghold   Saturday Night Live .   The Corsair  is  urlLink salivating at the thought  of  Harvard Lampoon  writers trying to not trip over themselves writing for the Reverend, who needs little help in cracking up an audience.  There are so many ways we can go with this:    11:32 : Opening Skit. Flashback: Sharpton debates patrician  Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan  (played deftly by  Darrel Hammond ) for Senate in 1994. A rhyming Sharpton engages in "the dozens," while Moynihan, in vain, tries to steer the debate towards Iatrogenic Government. Hilarity ensues.   11:40:  Al Sharpton medallion skit. The secret origins of Al's eye-catching medallion. Apparently it has come down from from an ancient African civilization of hustlers. The medallion imparts the gift of gab.   11:50:   Al Sharpton: The Early Years . Driving around down south doing doughnuts late at night with James Brown in parking lots. Hair coiffing techniques are discussed.   11:55:  Weekend News. Anchors  Tina Fey  and  Jimmy Fallon , telling Sharpton jokes, are interrupted by ... you got it:  the Rev !  Oh no, they didn't !   12:05:  President Al Skit: What would happen if Al Sharpton won the Presidency?  Pink  Performs "Get The Party Started" at the Inauguration as Al gets his boogie on. Shuttle diplomacy over the East Coast West Coast gang friction. Al brings peace to the Middle East by bringing up his love of James Brown's early music, bringing together  Sharon  and  Arafat  in a stunning rendition of "Hot Pants."  Al Sharpton  marries a gay couple ( Maya Rudolph  and  Rachel Dratch ) and brings together both left ( Amy Poelher  in hippie garb) and right in a sermon ( Jimmy Fallon  in preacher garb) on that funny thing called love, over some down home southern cuisine.   12:10:   Pink  performs. Sharpton, drunk on attention, does back up vocals on "Hooker" uninvited. Pink is not impressed.   12:30:    Paris Hilton -  Al Sharpton  tape surfaces, making the rounds at office Christmas parties. On tape Al is shown answering his cell phone and posing lewdly for the camera. Al tries to escape the media spotlight by heading home to Harlem, unfortunately, guys on 116th Street accost Sharpton for "getting with a girl that don't have no ass."   12:45:   Reality show. Al Sharpton must spend a month in  urlLink The Hilton's world , attending premiers, walking past the velvet rope-- scantily clad. Sharpton must hold Hilton's teacup chihuahua  Tinkerbell . Moral of the story? In the end, a teary eyed Sharpton confesses that "a kid from the streets ... cannot manage this much papering."   1:00:  Signs off reading Twas the Night Before Christmas to Pink and Hilton.    Set your  Tivo's  on stun.

       Dropping the Dime on Reagan   First  50 Cent  was being stalked by  Vivika Fox , and now Conservatives want to put  Ronald Reagan  on 10 cents:  has everyone lost their senses ?  Look,  The Corsair  tries to be fair here, looking at issues cultural, political and gossipy from all angles, with proportional amounts of snark, but  has the Republican Party lost it's fucking marbles ? Let's put it all out on the table: They want to  urlLink replace FDR with Reagan ?  A few things:  FDR was the man who, despite polio, assumed the Presidency at the height of the Great Depression, where 13 million were unemployed and nearly every bank was closed. FDR revived America and took it to the status of superpower. FDR presided over ther victorious allies on the right side of the greatest war mankind has ever known, breaking the back, in the process, of the Nazis and Imperial Japan. Now supporters of " The Ronald Reagan Dime Act " want to replace FDR with Reagan. What the  fuck ?  "I certainly would not look at it in any way as dishonoring FDR. He's also one of my favorite presidents," said  Rep. Wally Herger , R-Calif. "He was also interestingly enough a personal hero of President Reagan's, but frankly I feel more connection with Reagan. He's a Californian, also closer to us now in history."   It's good to see that intellectuals like Herger are in our congress, no? I guess Reagan's ass backward  urlLink "Constructive Engagement" policy with Apartheid's totalitarian South African regime  is the stuff of legend ... and dimes.    UPDATE:   Nancy Reagan is the voice of reason here. Reagan has asked that FDR  not  be  urlLink replaced by her husband .   In a statement, Mrs. Reagan says: "While I can understand the intentions of those seeking to place my husband's face on the dime, I do not support this proposal and I am certain Ronnie would not."  The former first lady goes on to say: "When our country chooses to honor a great president such as Franklin Roosevelt by placing his likeness on our currency, it would be wrong to remove him and replace him with another. It is my hope that the proposed legislation will be withdrawn."  Thank you, Nancy Reagan.

       Page Six Fucks With Lenny Kravitz   The intrepid folks at  urlLink Page Six  are making life hard for rocker  Lenny Kravitz   to close the deal and marry his galpal, Aussi A-List hottie  Nicole Kidman .  Real  hard. They are really getting in his face on this story, doing somewhat back to back Lenny Watches on Wednesday and Friday.   Page Six says Lenny has told friends that he is using  Nicole Kidman  to boost his career. Typical playa talk (for further reference see  50 Cent ). And now Page Six reports that Lenny was with another stunning woman at Shore Club's  Sky Bar :  "'(Kravitz) spent a lot of time with this woman and ended up grinding on the dance floor with her,' said our spywitness. The photos ...  show Kravitz eyeing the beauty like a pork chop."  The words "Kravitz" and "pork chop," when placed together in a sentence, do not augur  passion , Page Six is always solid on reporting; and, besides,  The Corsair  likes the  Page Sixers  better than Lenny anyway.

       Hollywood Cheapskates   Hey, don't call them cheap ... call them  thrifty . This week's  urlLink Star Magazine  reports on some of the  thriftiest  Hollywood stars. Despite the millions they make on film and in Japanese commercials, celebrities cannot shake off the american thrift of their unmonied youth:   "When  Julia Roberts  wed  Danny Moder  at her ranch in Taos, N.M., in 2002, the  Mona Lisa Smile   star relied on  Wal-Mart  and  Ace  hardware for last-minute decorating supplies, including a $150 wood porch swing and about $200 for additional plants. The food was down-home as well: Hot dogs, burgers, corn on the cob and coleslaw rounded out the menu. Julia's thrifty with her wardrobe. In February, when Julia fell in love with a vintage dress at a second-hand store in Santa Fe, N.M., she bartered her jeans to buy it!"  Can you imagine her pal  Denzel Washington  noshing on coleslaw? Me neither; by the way what is  noshing  anyway?

       Nick Cage Almost Remarries Lisa Marie   Although there were some hints of a budding psychosis in  Peggy Sue Got Married , it wasn't a true car wreck in  slow motion until  David Lynch's  creepy artsy Americana horror flic  Wild At Heart , where  Nic Cage  showed us, in full glory, his unhealthy obsession with Elvis.   Nic Cage's  didn't just  play  characters that bore a striking resemblence to  Elvis Presley ,  Nico wanted to be Elvis Presley .  It was not until Cage married Elvis' crown jewel  Lisa Marie Presley  that his ambition-compulsion was fully satisfied. And with the dissolution of their Hollywood marriage, things seemed to have gone back to normal for both.   urlLink The National Enquirer  reports that  Nic Cage  came thisclose to remarrying his sleepy eyed hottie ex-wife  urlLink Presley . But then they remembered why they broke up in the first place, according to the  Enquirer .   Michelle Caruso  writes that in between bouts of incredibly hot sex, the two fought like cats and dogs:  "As The ENQUIRER reported, Lisa Marie has been suffering gastrointestinal problems that are aggravated by the stress of performing. When Nic learned of her anxiety, he dropped by for support.  "'In addition to being enormously sexually attracted to Lisa Marie, Nic has always had a soft spot for her,' says the source."  A "soft spot" is one way to put it;  The Corsair  sees it more as revisiting a compulsion.    Anyhoo:  one thing led to another, and the flames of  l'amour  were once again crackling.  Alas, it was not to be. Nic likes to party in LA and N'Orleans, the article says. And then there is that longstanding crush on  Angelina Jolie , who wore that red dress that "knocked Nic's eyes out of his head," as Caruso writes. (Didn't Jolie steal  Billy Bob  from  urlLink Laura Dern ?)   The Corsair  knows that actors have a fragile sense of self. Actors tend to form very close relationships with the cast of a film, only to blow them off the minute that shooting stops. Such is the plasticity of Hollywood. That having been said, it is pretty creepy that Cage has kept up this Elvis obsession for so many years.  Move on Nicky boy. Elvis was a hero to most, but he was a karate loving, B-Lister druggie who died on the bowl to  The Corsair .  And while you're at it, Nocko, get rid of that comic book collection.

       Vivica Fox Won't Leave 50 Cent Alone!   According to the  urlLink National Enquirer ,  Vivika Fox  will not leave bullet riddled hip hop star  50 Cent  alone.   "She has called, and called, and called — trying unsuccessfully to get him on the phone so he could explain to her what happened," revealed a friend of the actress in the  Enquirer .  Apparently the man named after the price of Olestra filled potato chips (elegant, no?) feels that  urlLink Fox  is too posessive.   Odd, though, considering that in recent interviews --where he has gone into specific sexual positions they engaged in -- he blames the break up on the premise that Fox used him to promote her hit film,  Kill Bill .   Ah, well,  The Corsair  could have told you that a relationship between the upwardly mobile actress, Fox, and the criminally minded bullet dodger was not meant to last.  urlLink Chateau D'yquem  does not mix with  urlLink St.Ides .

       Vagina Monologue    Showing off our classical liberal arts education, this particular monologue comes from  Machiavelli's   Discorsi Sopra la Prima Deca Di Tiudo Livio ,  III, 6 : it concerns  Caterina Sforza Riario , a great beauty of her day and a woman Machiavelli thought of fondly, "(Some conspirators) killed  Count Giordano , their lord, and took his wife and small children. Since they did not see how they could be secure if they did not become masters of the fortress, and the castellan were not willing to cede it to them,  Madonna Caterina  (so the Countess was called) promised the conspirators that if they let her enter it, she would deliver it over to them and they could keep the children with them as hostages. With this pledge they let her enter. As soon as she was within, she stood on the walls and berated them for the death of her husband and threatened them with every kind of revenge. And to show that she did not worry about her children, she showed them her genitals, saying she still had the means to make more of them."   Say what you will about his politics, but Machiavelli knows how to tell a story, dammit.

       Udon Noodles Made Her Bloated    urlLink TV Guide  reports that It Girl and all-but-certain Best Supporting Actress for 2004,  Scarlet Johansson  did something deeply naughty with director  Sophia Coppolla  and  The Corsair , your humble scribe, wishes to God he was in the room when that shit went down! Apparently there is some interesting  backstory  (excuse the pun)  behind  (again, sorry) that, um, erotic opening scene in  Lost In Translation .    TV Guide's   Angel Cohn  writes:  "The shy thesp admits director  Sofia Coppola  had some convincing to do on the day they shot that one: I said, 'Sofia, I don't want to wear sheer underwear because I've just been eating a lot of [Japanese udon noodles], and I'm bloated. I just don't want to do it. Can't we just use regular underwear with my ass crack [showing]?'"  "In response, Coppola assuaged Johansson's fears about the panties by modeling them for her! 'Sofia's got such a nice figure,' Johansson says. I thought, 'Wow, if my ass is going to look like that in those underwear, get them on me.'"  And in similar but less porny news,  urlLink Jeanette Walls  reports that  Barbara Walters  admits to checking out naked women. “I like to look,” the newswoman said while discussing what she does when around nude ladies in a hot tub on  The View . “They’ve got beautiful bodies.”   I always said Barbara Walters was one of the guys.

       Musical Chairs at Conde Nast Bash   Ah, the holidays are here again, and that means missletoe, the ambient tones of  urlLink Manheim Steamroller , pine needles, that silly woman who invariably gets carried home through the chilly streets of New York by her patient chums because she drank too much egg nog at the company party, and, of course, the  urlLink Conde Nast Four Seasons editor and pubisher bash . Imagine the collective egos assembled in that one room; all that hot air in a single location.   Accompany me through this gallery of 'what fools these mortals be.' Why, look over there, it's  Graydon Carter  and his boy wonder,  James Truman   lighting up -- oh, those  scamps -- tobacco products--indoors! And in direct defiance of  Mayor Bloomberg's  anti-smoking ban. That contrarian Canadian libertarian is just being rowdy!  Oh, and there's  Lucky  Editor in Chief  Kim France   who, like Christ's neighbor, the crucified robber who repented at the last minute, now sits on  Si Newhouse's  left hand, at the  power table .   Metaphors of paradise ring true here and not politically  incorrect , by the way, as  Conde Nast  is the  Nirvanna  of glossies.   Just as  Dante Aligheri  places the true  Paradiso  in the Empyrean, situated outside the universe, and therefore outside space and time, those outer tables, far away from  the Mystic Rose , that celestial choir that is  Si Newhouse , are less appealing, less -- shall we say -- "holy."  And would it be a far stretch of the imagination to envision the editors at Conde Nast dressed in ermine?   Why,  Teen Vogue  Editor-in-Chief  Amy Astley  is seated so close to Si that she can just ... just dip her head, slightly and gently brush her rose lips against his signet ring.  Not since the  Court of the Sun King  has anyone assembled such a crowd of nonpareil beauty and excellence.  That image I have conjured of Amy Astley is so beautiful ... so sublime, I believe that I shall now weep.    "The seating arrangement means everything - and nothing," says  Maurie Perl , the vice president of communications told  Keith Kelly  of the Post, who sat at none-too-elite Table 8. "The important thing is that you're in the room."  Sure, Maurie,  whatever you say .   Thank you Conde Nast, thank you for trapping beauty timeless in your glossy and quite fragrant pages, thanks to you editors great and small, who give me such  material   and  vanity  to work on.

       Vanity Fair's Plame Game   The most famous spy in the world,  Valerie Plame , shows up in, of all places,  urlLink jet set bible and doctor's office staple ,  Vanity Fair.   When she's not hobnobbing with  Ben Bradlee  and  Sally Quinn , our "Jane Doe" is speaking with Vanity Fair writer  Vicky Ward  .  The slim, sharp white-blond Jaguar driving fortysomething "secret agent" must have cut quite a figure in Niger. Like nobody would ever peg her as a spy:  ancient Chinese secret, huh ?  But Valerie is a tasty dish in an older woman kind of way. She is indeed our favorite "yellow cake" ... our favorite ...  cheese cake!  Ha ha! We couldn't resist the urge.  Note to the CIA: People who look like they have just walked out of the pages of  Lisa Birnbach's   Official Preppy Handbook  stick out like a sore thumb doing cloak and dagger wqrk in Third World Countries. At the Ugandan embassy, where I spent much of my childhood, we had a whole species of jokes about how conspicuous CIA agents were in Kampala.  I must now relate some words by R Kelly: Hey, Valerie,  keep it on the down low ... aint nobody has to know .

       Diana Vreeland Loved Soul Train   Which high powered  Conde Nast  editor wrote this?   "I earned my Masters degree in French literature in the Spring of 1972. My topic was the pivotal role played by all the fabulous, exotic North African women in the world of poet  Charles Baudelaire  and painter  Eugene Delacroix . My thesis was based on the whole sense of importance of Africa to the conception of Orientalism as it influenced art and literature in Nineteenth Century France, a topic in which I have a keen interest. Delacroix's  Les Femmes d'Algiers  featured prominently, as did Flaubert's Salambo. I truly loved writing my Master's thesis, and although I still yearned for the world of fashion, I moved on to pursuing my doctorate without hesistation."  Can you guess who wrote this?  One more clue:  "You see (Diana)  Vreeland  loved black culture. She loved the Saturday Morning Dance Show  Soul Train ; my grandmother cared nothing for it ... she went hog wild over every manifestation of black style. It all began, I think, with  Josephine Baker , who truly was one of the most stylish women to ever walk this planet. Mrs. Vreeland loved to tell the story of watching a movie one night in the balcony of a Paris cinema back in the 30s. She had her elbows on the armrests and was intently watching this film, when all of a sudden, one of the armrests moved. She turned to see what was going on and found out that she had been resting her elbow not on the arm of a seat, but on the head of Josephine Baker's pet cheetah, and that both the magnificent cat and its magnificent owner were now getting up to leave. Mrs. Vreeland watched speechlessly as the cheetah padded in a stately fashion up the aisle of the theater, Josephine Baker walking regally behind, wearing a daring, bias-cut Vionnet dress with no underwear on underneath."  If you guessed that this is the wonderful  Andre Leon Talley's   urlLink ALT , then give yourself a pat on the back. Basta!

       Mia's Mission    George Jacobs , Mr. Sinatra's manservant, recently came out with a tell all bio called  Mr. S  that is fascinating. Aside from noting that  Ava Gardner  told him she was part African American, Jacobs spills the beans on the Machiavellian  Mia Farrow . He writes:  "Motherhood was, only after stardom, the most powerful imperative for her. At times, she'd sit with me and go down her list of all the great and famous men she wanted to have children with after Frank. She knew the relationship would end sometime, but she assumed it would be at  her time , and only after she had created one of what would be her master race of offspring. She was talking some major names, on her wish list.  Leonard Bernstein , who was gay,  Picasso , who was almost dead , J.D. Salinger , who had disappeared, and  Bob Dylan , who was badly disabled from his motorcycle accident, and was underground. The girl thought big. She was that focused ..."

       The Charlie Rose Drinking Game    The art of the interview is to draw out the subject while the interviewer recedes into the background. Although  Charlie Rose  delivers the goods on any given weekday, he uses the first person singular personal pronoun often.  Excedingly  often. Okay: all the damned time. Charlie, thank you for giving us those great interviews with  Will Ferrell  and  Luca Cordero di Montezemolo , but honestly:  It's not all about you . All those  I's  and  me's  Charlie; it's not all about you.   So, in the spirit of Charlie Rose's energetic use of the first person singular personal pronoun,  The Corsair  proposes  The Charlie Rose Drinking Game . It's late at night, it was a hard day at work, you are about to go to bed and Charlie is interviewing some Master of the Universe -- so why not have a drinkie poo on everyones favorite social climber- cum-interviewer? Every time Charlie uses the first person singular personal pronoun, down a shot.    And don't use any of the cheap stuff , ladies and gentlemen, this is Charlie Rose we're talking about, and that whole "corridors of power Illuminati Trilateral Commission" power nexus. One doesn't just down muscatel with Charlie Rose; you better  recognize .   If you are still conscious after the drinking game, then you are a candidate for the  Jared Paul Stern  Ironman Drinkie-poo competition.

       We Love You, Shiela   My buddy,  urlLink the very cool Ivy Supersonic  informs me that  Sheila Horne Brody , aka  Amuka , is leaving as the lead female vocalist for  George Clinton and the P-Funk Allstars   to tour for her Billboard Top Ten Hit  Appreciate Me , which is a urlLink  must have .  The Corsair  wishes Amuka all the luck in the world, not that she will need it.

       Jacko May Give Up His Kids    The Star Magazine  reprorts that Michael Jackson is considering giving up his kids  urlLink to his own mother  or, possibly,  Debbie Rowe , who enlarged the possibilities of a turkey baster from that of being merely a holiday accoutrement.   "The children are with Michael right now -- there no reason why they shouldn't be,"  Michael Sands , a Jackson family spokesman told Star. "He's their father. If circumstances change, though, they will go to Michael's mother, Katherine, or to their mother,  Debbie Rowe , until this whole business is over."  And as if this is not bad enough, Fox's  Roger Friedman  reports that Jacko's current manager,  Dieter Weisner , the man who helped hired his pit bull lawyer  Mark Geragos , operates legal sex clubs and brothels  urlLink in his native Germany .

       Resign Eisner ... Resign    Michael Eisner  will eventually resign for his pathetic management of Disney, his stupid purchase of  ABC , those idiotic themeparks, EuroDisney and other mega-blunders of this public company, but it will not be pretty because Eisner is an adolescent asshole, after the Hollywood ego-driven manner. Shareholders should demand it. I want to see Eisner crying like a bitch being escorted from the premesis, like  Jim Bakker  was years ago before  urlLink he complained of aliens .   The following is a blog I wrote on November 19th that is even more valid now that Roy Disney has resigned and called for  urlLink Eisner to step down :  Wasn't November supposed to be the month that Eisner either showed some miraculous growth numbers for Disney or he was to be shown the door? Sheesh. Will someone fire  Michael Eisner   urlLink already !  We all know that he is antagonizing  Steve Jobs  and the guys at  Pixar  who are singlehandedly saving Disney's bacon.   Michael Wolff  made an interesting comment on Eisner a while ago in his column in New York.   Eisner has made himself indispensible at Disney. He has a large amount of shares and, like an African dictator, he has (consciously) never groomed a succesor. So it would be hard to fire Eisner without greatly affecting the already bad stock price.  Sad that a public company has to be held hostage to the Hollywood tactics of a real punk like Michael Eisner. Will the Board of Directors react? only time will tell.

       Being Fisher Stevens   Imagine that you are  Fisher Stevens . That would mean that you are an accomplished stage actor who is respected by his peers.  You are popular with all the right people. You were executive producer of the critically acclaimed "In The Bedroom." But no matter what you do, how many awards you win, every mention of you in the gossip pages involves the fact that you are a urlLink  former paramour  of  Michelle Pfeiffer .   The Corsair  is a modern man, and there is no shame in the game of being called  Mr. Celebrity Ex Diva , but, man to man, that has got to hurt you in the solar plexus.  You know, all dark night of the soul, alone in your bedroom  contemplating  -- that sort of shit. Fisher Stevens is  urlLink accomplished .  If he were a better looking man (who are we kidding, if he were a  good  looking man), Stevens would have been thrust into the floddlights of Tinseltown. Alas, that was not the case; and so he is, for all intensive purposes, in every gossip column, for the duration of his time on this planet, "the guy who dated  Michelle Pfeiffer."    Life,  John Kennedy  once said, is not fair.

       Fuck Joan Rivers   No, don't fuck her literally, as with all that plastic surgery, such an operation may be on the impossible side. Besides, any chance of finding a supple piece of flesh on Old Phoney Joaney is  highly unlikely . I'm being figurative here. I mean, who does  Joan Rivers  think she is anyway? Her fifteen minutes ended the instant she rat fucked  Johnny Carson   with that low grade piece of ass late night comedy show on the Fox network all those many moons ago. But  nooo , never ever count on Joan Rivers to make an elegant or  timely  exit.  Instead, Joan Rivers, like the proverbial guest who will not take the hint that the party is indeed over, has extended her stay on the national landscape, taxing all of our patience, and generally  fucking up  our good time as media voyeurs. Insinuating herself on to the red carpet with that bitter, venomous mouth that we all know and hate, Joan Rivers gets to stand in between legitimate celebrities and their entrance to the  Oscars  and, of late, the  Golden Globes  as well. With her talentless "offspring,"  . With her talentless daughter, Melissa  in tow, Joan aggressively barrs celebrities from making an entrance unaccosted to an event that they have indeed been invited to.    The Corsair  has a feeling that celebrities are too affraid to be mean to Joan because they fear the opprobrium of the E! Network or, even worse, a cutting remark on their perfect night. Remember Lynn Redgrave, nerves on end after allegations of her husband's affair, hoping to win Best Supporting Oscar, in abject horror as Joan asked her who she was "wearing."   Publicists can get panicky as well; celebrities with jitters as to whether or not they will get an award are naturally vulnerable. And, like the puff adder that she is, Joan Rivers has anticipated that vulnerability and preys on it, plays it like a  Stradivarius . Rivers plays on the fear to judge these stars on their sufaces -- their looks and their fashion. Imagine the shame of an elderly woman so shallow as to judge celebrities on their surfaces. But then, Old Lady Rivers seems immune to shame.  Everyone: celebrities and journos and viewers alike are waiting -- with baited breath -- for someone,  anyone  to deliver a much needed bitchslap to Madame Joan Rivers' surgically stretched cheek.  Retire, Joan ...  retire !

       The Corsair's Remote Control Tour Diary   There are over  500  cable channels nowadays, so who better to give you a tour of some of the major ones? (This idea is so good my fingers are crossed that no one steals it from me  without attribution ; unfortunately, most bloggers have sticky fingers)    Anyhoo:  500 channels means "niche marketing." And with all those niches, things can get confusing as to what is being marketed. So,  The Corsair  will help the viewer through the wonderful world of cable with these pithy explanations,  In Media Res:    TNT : Lousy with Middle aged  Testosterone. A musky-smelling channel.  Bruce Willis  and  Steven Seagal  action flics and basketball. Big in New Jersey.   CNN : Used to be a channel for Kings and Queens and heads of state, but of late it is the channel for cranky retired people with an angry opinion on everything political ("Those libs are holding up Medicaid!"). Poor CNN:  They used to wine and dine with kings and queens, but now they are laying in the gutter eating pork and beans.    Lifetime : A channel earnestly devoted to the smouldering resentments of Midwestern housewives. Husbands are to blame in most of these story lines. Anger is the predominant emotion. Hollywood has not been kind to  Nancy McKeon . Hell hath no fury like  Joanna Kearns  scorned!   Family Channel : The channel devoted to Christians in a nuclear family with a conviction that human history has a purpose beyond this world.  Halleleuia . Lots of  Mary Kate and Ashley films , which, ironically, attract a  very different  sort of crowd than the ones that these cats are aiming after.   CNBC : This channel serves as "White Noise" for the various strip joints in the Wall Street and financial district vicinity. As your  Bud Fox -like trader with a "Lawng Island" accent sips a  Stoli  on the rocks on his lunchbreak, sniffing his "Bolivian white Powder" ("Vitamin C"), getting a "friction dance" from his favorite "dancer," he can look over her shoulder, casually, and catch a brief glance at just how the markets are doing, and get a gauge on when he should return to the office.   A&E : An elderly folks network with lots of  Murder, She Wrote , and "original" films like "Horatio Hornblower," for viewers who can remember their glorious years of service in the British Imperial navy policing those hectic colonial ports.   History : This is the  Hitler  and  Outlaw Biker  channel. At any time of the day, there is a  hilbilly bar with serious discussions going on as to Hitler's "tactical blunders" and what they would have done "different," with this channel serving as the background noise.   Discovery : This is the older, skeevier companion network to the already low rent  History Channel , which means that it attracts a  comparatively downscale sort of viewer  than one would expect at History, which is not saying much at all. Seriously, though, This is the  straight up  serial killers network. No joking, yo. Somewhere in the Yosemite Valley there is a man, in a dungeon, sweating profusely, wearing clown makeup and laughing at the moon. He is surrounded by dog collars and he is described by co workers at the post office as "a solitary man."  Guess which channel this guy is watching to drown out the screams. That's right (sotto voce)  Discovery . Homeland security  must needs  to monitor anyone who watches  more than 3 hours a day of this shit .   VH1 : Perhaps the coolest channel on basic cable or otherwise, my little pomegranates! Suffused with irony, snark and nostalgia, this channel supplies the basic components of the Gen X diet.  Michael Hirschorn  is our god;  we are not worthy .   MTV : No longer cool: a  little  resentful of the joie de vivre its older, more successful brother,  VH1 . It will never be the  80s  again and the blush has wore off that ordinary looking frat boy  Carson Daly . No one over 16 should be watching this channel, even for the misguided purpose of irony.   E!:  Creepy celebrity stalking and gossip. Everyone on this channel reeks of thwarted Hollywood ambitions and plastic surgery gone awry. This channel hasn't had a hit since  Gregg Kinnear   was up in this bitch , and  Jules Asner  snatched  Steven Soderberg , using the Asner name (she divorced  Ed Asner's  son years ago).   ESPN:  This is reality tv for the Maxim set. Faint but palpable homoerotic subtext via "hero worship" of alpha males, like, say,  Shaq  or  Sprewell  (but viewers call him Spree, cause, like, they know him personally in a  Calvin Klein  kind of way), although your average  Joe Fratboy  will never acknowledge that distrubing little truth.   Bravo : For the affluent gay man. Cultural programming( National Dog Show ,  Cirque du Soleil ,  Inside the Actors Studio )  and  Queer Eye For the Straight Guy  rebroadcasts. If you go in for the National Dog Show, collect  Lalique  crystal (" Steuben Glass  is for amateurs"), or the like, then this is your network.   BET : A seriously embarassing network marketed to the seedy stereotype of the urban underclass. Ghetto comedy skits told in unremarkable english with frequent reference to bodily functions;  charmed , I'm sure. Snakeoil selling televangelists prevail over the airwaves on Sundays. And C-List Blaxploitations flix fill out the rest of any regrettable week spent watching this schedule.  urlLink Can you fucking believe that Viacom paid three billion dollars for this channel ?   Sci Fi:  The repressed sexuality channel. Their niche is the grown man who has a crush on the X Man,  Storm  and dreams in full-on video games. Somehow the unresolved "sexual energy" gets worked out into a reverence for the "paranormal." B List hot chicks like  Shannen Doherty  and  Tracy Lords  end up here after Hollywood is through with them.   Fox:  If you go in for  Karl Rove's  talking points, this is the channel for you.  The Corsair  has to admit that he watched it during the  Second Gulf War . Fox routinely scooped the other networks because it sometimes seemed that Rummy gave them the inside scoop. For a "family values network," the women broadcasters have an  oddly pornographic patina  about them. Hmmm.   Showtime:   Tries earnestly to out-extreme the original programming at  HBO , who got there first. Dreams of getting recognized at events like the  Golden Globes ; not likely, however. This is the place to try to pitch your indie documentary on transexual underwater basket weavers in  Micronesia .   Food : For people who's interest in food has transcended the purely phenomenal eating stage.    TLC:  This channel is a bit of a mystery to me. It used to have a niche as a sort of  Cliff Clavin  channel: you know, for the general interest trivia mind-- programming on the  imago  stage of child development, poisonous reptiles, the  Minoan  civilization,  Roman  mosaics, classical biological warfare, the robber barons, volcanoes, that sort of thing. But now it has a lot of "fixing up the home" programming. Go figure what that means.   AMC:  Kind of Cool. Old Hollywood glamour with some original programming and commentary on the Gilded Age of Hollywood. This is like a channel put together by the editors of Variety looking backward. Vanity Fair should do a show here. Old school.   FX:  Not worth talking about. Maxim lite. Loads of testosterone.   We:  Women's fantasy. Lots of  Merchant-Ivory  Brit productions of aristocrats who fall in love with common women, who are often middle aged American divorcees. Pure drivel.   C-Span:  For the ultra political science geek. Viewers tend to look like  urlLink Michael Barone , wait anxiously for their  New Republic  copies to arrive, and chuckle over Senate voting record statistics. Can rattle off the precise wording of the Republican Party platform of 1964.   Oxy:  Very "sisterhood" oriented;  Oprah  and  Gerry Laybourne's  experiment has recently taken a sort of Sapphic detour of late with regard to their programming.   National Geographic:   Interesting and kind of cool. This is a channel about animals and exotic cultures.   IFC:   So earnest, so hip, so anti-Hollywood: yet as soon as  Dinner for Five's  indy star  John Favreau  gets to do a big shlocky Hollywood film like  Elf , he jumps like a Cocker Spaniel being offered a dog yummy. Independent cinema is dead.   TCM:  This is a less hip AMC. This is like AMC with a broken hip. Lots of old movies with no irony or relevant commentary.   Ovation:   The Corsair  has a theory that this is a piece of flotsam adrift on the vast media ocean that is digital television. They repeat the same ten or so programs ad nauseum. Is there anyone employed at Ovation? Did the programmer have a heart attack in the 80s? Did anyone notice? Is anyone watching?   ESPNClassic:  Oh, dear lord help us. Old men with beer bellies reliving "classic sports moments." (At this point,  Bruce Springsteen's   Glory Days  should be playing). This is the tv channel  Al Bundy  would most likely be watching on his day off from the shoe store.   TVLand:   Tries to be all retro-ironical, but street cred will not be forthcoming by running repeats of  Bewitched  and  Sanford and Son , alone. Poor saps. The other networks have bought all the good old tv shows, leaving TV Land to contemplate Mayberry.    Animal:  Television for committed vegans and PETA members. What kind of ad revenue do these guys generate?   Sundance:   An edgy IFC; very left wing political, but  pure .  Robert Redford's  pet liberal project.   Trio:  Perhaps the coolest channel of them all. What VH1 viewers will most likely watch once they quit being ironic, get real jobs in the media and participate in the economy. Used to be a Canadian station, believe it or not. Culture and media navel gazing.   NWI:  A rap up of all the international anti-American news agencies.  Al Gore  wants to buy this station and kick things up a notch.   DiscoveryTimes:   One of the strangest channels in the world. this is actually the  New York Times'  channel, but it is devoted to showing America militarized or in crisis, which, all told, are the moments when  The Old Grey Lady  was at its finest. Lots of Civil rights struggles, war footage, terrorism analysis, and --wierdest of all -- endless looks into our military academies.  What the fuck?!    FUSE:  MTV's unsuccessful competitor for the extreme generation low attention span kiddie market, which is not saying much.   VH1Classic:  Could be interesting, as the X Generation is big on nostalgia, but right now this channel is  not happening.    USA:  This is the sybil channel. It is high testosterone most of the year, but come holiday time it is all about the holidays... kinda like our dads.   Style:  If it is possible this is an even more shallow channel than E! Lots of B-List types talking about the beauty business.  That's all, I hope you liked my thoughts. If you did, bookmark this site.  Cordially,   Ron Mwangaguhunga

       Katty Kay    The Corsair  is fickle when it comes to his women. Sometimes he likes them dark and brainy, like  Gloria Borger . Other times, The Corsair leans towards the leggy look, with the glossed lips, like Fox News bombshell  Laurie Duhe . NBC's  Campbell Brown  seems like a southern sorority gal who likes to have a good time: then there is that story that  urlLink Virgin CEO Richard Branson hid her shoes so he could take her home . CNN's sexy Suzanne Malveaux is a definite honey. But lately, The Corsair has fallen into the old cliche: the blonde with the British accent. It hurts to have unexceptional tastes, but  The Corsair  cannot help but gasp at the  BBC's Washington Correspondent  Katty Kay.   That's all I have to say, nothing snarky nor profound.

       Are Rock Stars Pure Energy?   Whenever one reads some rock magazine or other there is inevitably a vague New Agey sort of discussion concerning "energy." One reads things like, "dude, the energy of the show was amazing," or, "you could almost feel the energy coming off of  Kid Rock , man." That sort of thing. I find that interesting.  I find it especially interesting because I recently re read  Janice Dickinson's   No Lifeguard on Duty  (BTW:  The Corsair  is also reading former Senator  Gary Hart's   The Patriot,  if you want to know), where the proto-supermodel describes sex with  Mick Jagger :  " The man was indefatigable ... He was pure energy -- kind of spooky, to tell you the truth. I woke up the next morning feeling like I'd been through a war."   That, to me, is interesting in light of all our previous  'discussion' of energy and rock stars. In  Bebe Buell's   Rebel Heart , she describes meeting him" like lightening had struck ." And, "both Steven and I felt a spark, an animal magnetism from the get go, even though -- or perhaps because -- Steven knew I was with  Todd (Rundgren)."   But the most interesting entry in the book is a line about her flying in  Steven Tyler's  private plane:  "Being confined in a tiny area with a person who had the energy of fifty wild ponies was terrifying."   So, Bebe Buell found Steve Tyler's energy "terrifying" and Janice Dickinson found Mick Jagger energy "spooky."  Is scary the new black ? Bear with me guys, The Corsair has a lot of  Aquarius  in him and is fascinated by these things.

       Howie Kurtz: Jumps the Shark  Or,  Mr. Kurtz, he Dead   You know how it is with  Corsair  and  Howie . We are tight in that I-watch-you-on-tv-religiously kind of way. And why not? Howie represents that East Coast media elite thing that Corsair is both fascinated and repelled by, in a  Lifetime  movie of psychotic compulsion sort of way (But not so much  Burning Bed  as  Mother May I Sleep With Danger ).    Anyhoo:  Just like the heroines of those Lifetime valorizations of victimhood,  The Corsair  is going to have to cut the cord of an abusive relationship in the end, and ask for that pesky divorce. So I'm going to say it, though it pains me: Howie Kurtz's  Reliable Sources  has, alas,  jumped the shark . I've lost that loving feeling.   Allow me to explain : Old Reliable hasn't been the same since  K Street  came to Washington and stunk up the joint. Sure, DC has been lousy with special interest money, but journalism was journalism,  you know what I mean ? We all knew that The Baltimore Sun's  Jack Germond  could drink the equivalent of the  Chesapeake Bay  in cognac, but he would always get the scoop and give us a great story and that, in a way, that was how one felt about Beltway DC journalism: flawed, but suffused with yummy nougaty scoop.  That is no longer the case. While Howie Kurtz used to be the bellwether of serious journo talk -- real "1 am on  C Span " sort of geeky, but good stuff-- he has increasingly become enamoured with the borish fad of putting Hollywood celebrities on, and them asking dumb, fawning questions. Where's the love, Howie Kurtz; where's the love?  K Street made everyone in our gilded capital think they were movie stars, or at least deserving of the attention of  Courtney Love . I have to tell you, though, Howie, Courtney Love doesn't deserve the attention of Courtney Love.  One expected that the demise of that magnum of chloroform, "ombudsman"  Bernie Kalb , Reliable Sources was on to bigger and better things.  That was not the case. After Howie Kurtz appeared on K Street in a  Starbucks , no less, that was the beginning of the end of that significant and formerly excellent media reporter. Starbucks, indeed!  Soon after Howie put on George Clooney and fawned (dear Lord, how Howie  fawned  that day) to Rosemary's nephew about being on " Vanity Fair's  cover." I guess writing for VF is no longer enough after being on K Street, Howie no longer wants to provide the content,  he longs to be the subject . What's next Howie, a publicist and harassing diva-like calls to  Page Six ? When does it end, Howard Kurtz? How much fame is enough? Mus we endure a  Mahogany -like ending to this tragic tale before he, like  Diana Ross , another diva of sorts,  goes back to his long suffering  Billy Dee Williams  (the excellent  Washington Post ) and be satisfied that his lot in life is to give life and conversation to the media class?    But the last straw came last week when The Corsair sat by the tv set, coiled, ready-for-media-chat,  Sunday New York Times  messily undone at his feet, Kenyan coffee at the ready, waiting for Howie to start the media conversation of the week. The guest of honor?  Darrel Hammond , the  Saturday Night Live  impersonator.  Oh, Howie.

       So You Want To Be A British Aristocrat?    Mohammed Al-Fayed , the  urlLink international sleazeball and megalomaniac , is making a bid for the  Daily and Sunday Telegraph   urlLink newspapers in Britain , continuing a never ending quest to become " down " with the thoroughly bigoted British Upper Class system.   Hey Mohammed: When was the last time you saw a dusky member of  British Commonwealth  contributors in the  House of Lords ? Are there any Kenyan or Trinidadian Earls? Dukes? Meriticracy be damned in Britain, says  The Corsair .  In this quixotic endeavor, Al Fayed has left no stone unturned.  From across the pond, as a Ugandan born former colonial of England, the travails of the Egyptian-born Al Fayed strike  The Corsair  as somewhat sad, almost touching. Eminent sociologist  VF Calverton  called what Al Fayed is going through as a "colonial complex," like Madonna adopting a British accent as a sign of having reached the "upper strata of existence."  urlLink The BBC profile of him strikes the right tone :  "Why won't they give me a passport? I own  Harrods  and employ thousands of people in this country.   "Mohamed al-Fayed   Ever since he arrived in the UK in the early 1970s, Mr al-Fayed has barely concealed his desire to be accepted into the establishment of his adopted country.  It is an ambition that has seen him donate millions of pounds to British charities and assume control of Harrods, the London department store which was once a by-word for Britishness itself.   "(Fayed) has resurrected the satirical magazine  Punch  and also moved into the mainstream British pursuit of football, buying  Fulham FC , and earlier this year offered up the club's manager  Kevin Keegan  when the English national team was managerless.    "Yet, like an over-zealous schoolboy desperate to muscle into a select gang, it seems the harder Mr al-Fayed has tried for acceptance, the more he is brushed off. "   Brushed off  is the key here. The British aristocracy, like a job at  Ambercrombie and Fitch  is a white only affair. We have better chance of seeing an African American in the US Senate withing the next election cycle than seeing Al Fayed accepted in with the swells.   A note to Al Fayed:  Getting a lordship and sitting in the House of Lords might be easier if you didn't  urlLink accuse  the Royal family of  killing your son and Princess Diana.  Just a friendly tip from  The Corsair .

       Smackdown: Dick Morris vs Bill Clinton   From  Behind the Oval Office , by  Dick Morris  p. 64-5:  "At about midnight, (then Governor Bill) Clinton  joined Hillary,  Gloria Cabe , his campaign manager, and me in a cozy breakfst room off the kitchen. My polling (for a 1990 gubernatorial reelection fight) showed that  McRae  offensive (Bill's ooponent) had dropped Clinton's share vote to a meage 43 percent. Generally, when an incumbent's share of the polls dropped below 50 percent in the polls, it means he is likely to lose ... Clinton's temper got the better of him. Exhausted, worried, and angry, he exploded. 'You got me into this race,' he screamed, 'so you could make some extra money off me. That was the only reason. And now you give me no attention, no attention at all. I'm about to lose this election, this primary, against a nobody' ... Clinton has a terrible temper ... In pain and facing that harsh criticism, I lost my temper too. If he was too hasty in his criticism, I was too sharp in my reply. Storming out of the breakfast room  through the kitchen toward the door outside, I rallied, 'Thank you, thank you, thank you. You've just solved my problem. I'm getting shit from Atwater and shit from Lott for working for you, and now I can solve my problem. Go fuck yourself. I'm quitting your goddamn campaign, and now I am a free agent. I can be a fifty state Republican and don't have to take your shit.'  "Clinton charged up behind me as I stalked towards the door, grabbed me from behind, and wrapped his arms around me to stop me from leaving. I slipped to the floor. Hillary helped me to my feet. The moment I stood up Clinton became apologetic. 'Don't go, don't go I'm sorry. Don't go, I;m sorry,' he said as I walked out the door, slamming it behind me.. Hillary ran after me to calm me down. She put her arms around my shoulders and walked me around the grounds of the mansion. "Please forgive him," she pleaded. 'He's under so much pressure. He didn't mean it. He's very sorry. He's overtired, he hasn't slept well in days. He's not himself. He values you. He needs you,' she repeated.  "I calmed down enough to drive to my hotel, and I called Eileen (his wife) shaking in rage. Later Hillary called to tell me how much Bill wanted me back. Then he came on line to apologize ... I couldn't leave Clinton three weeks before his primary, but from then on I dealt with him in a formal, almost frosty way. I stopped calling him Bill, always adressed him as Governor, and left when our meetings were over rather than hang around and chat."

       Explaining David Brooks to East Coaster Insiders    David Brooks  tends to switch back and forth between two styles in his  urlLink New York Times Op Eds , which are often entertaining. On the one hand, he is the Brother from Another Planet -- a Conservative Yankee in King Sulzberger's Court (except instead of Victorian Medievalism in Twain, Brooks hacks away at Upper West Side-DC pink shirted NPR listening stone ground cracker and brie munching liberalism)  -- or, as I fondly call him  Brooks Brother , explaining those "kooky" ways of the liberal Blue states to the folksy red states. Brooks comes off as a sort of Ambassador at large, telling his countrymen abroad,  through the very pages of the cultural establishment , what to make of things like, say, Jamaican nannies who essentially raise ones kids, as often  happens on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Or why  Nascar racing  and power tools and Evangelical Christian music aren't big in  DC , or  Hollywood  or  Silicon Valley   or even  Wall Street , as they are in, say,  Kentucky :  the heart land .   Here Brooks can be quite funny about the extreme polarization in the country: we are, essentially, two nations: one Born Again and the other worldly, very  metrosexual . One side  Sex and the City , the other the Country Music Awards and gun shows: one half red, one half blue.  Okay, that's a  gross oversimplification , but it is the jist of Brooks Brother's rhetoric and  this is a blog, people , if you want a deep sociological analysis of the country don't look at me to do it here,  my little pomegranates !  I actually like Brooks when he brings out those differences -- and  Chris Matthews  uses him in that capacity -- because I do not think that big city folk or people in that sphere understand Christians, or, rather, conservative  evangelical Christianity  and what  a major force it is in our country . It transforms lives -- like say, the President's -- from alcoholic wastrel to productive citizen. It is amazing and, to be frank, I don't understand it, but I'd  like  to (ed note: there was absolutely no snark in that last staement: I really would like to understand the social forces at work in the evangelical movement in America).  But Brooks has a serious side as well. And today Brooks tells us that  George Bush  and his courtiers have " A Fetish of Candor ," or, in other words, they like their country music, their cowboy hats and a handshake deal is as good as gold. These are serious, rugged foolk and they do badly when they have to get on the world stage and get all  Machivellian  with the heads of state of  the chocolate-making countries .   Brooks starts off snarkily enough: "I  think we are all disgusted by the way  George W. Bush's  administration has allowed honesty and candor to seep into the genteel world of international affairs."  Okay, you see where this is going? I can too. It ends thusly:  "Sometimes you've got to be slippery to accomplish real good. The Bush administration is thus facing an insincerity crisis. It has become addicted to candor and forthrightness. It needs an immediate back-stabbing infusion.  "Perhaps Al Gore could be brought in to offer advice."  In other words, those urbane-sophisticated liberals who couldn't melt butter in their mouths because they haven't accepted  Jesus  and the  right to shoot   cannot understand candor and it is that candor that forced  Donald Rumsfeld  to repeatedly rub salt into the wounds of  France  and  Germany  calling them Old Europe.    I see:  It was a  fetish of candor  and not the  school boy wrestling culture  that Rummy was displaying, for all the world to see, when he slowly, creepily, last year morphed from Secretary of Defense into Secretary of State by criticizing Europe to NATO conferences in ... Europe.  Sorry Brooks, this is cookie cutter stuff; I thought Gore sucked hard when he buried the knife into his loyal running mate's back, but to make that a metaphor for all non-Evangelicals is  cheesy like Provolone .   The Corsair  rates today's Op Ed:  C-plus .  Needs improvement.

       But, Sir, Doesn't Pavarotti Suck?   Right off the bat I am not going to say that I am a fan of Opera as a  species , per se, although the early operas of  Monteverdi   have moved me, what with their odd sense of acceleration of pace and repetitions of phrase. I have found myself caught in the funk, so to speak, on those occasions, and have been known to move my midsection vigorously, like  Courtney Cox  in that godawful  urlLink Springsteen video . No, I really didn't but it sounded interesting, didn't it? No? What ever .   Not that  Luciano Pavarotti  would ever include Early Music in his cheesy repertoire. So, as you can guess, I do not see the need for his coming-to-be in Western Civilization, although I am vaguely aware that it does actually exist.   Anyhoo:   The big man  urlLink got all pimped out  for his wedding to his 30-year old ex-secretary,  Nicoletta Mantovani  . How cliche is that,  anyway ?    And with  The Corsair , the only sins are sins of cliche ... and tackiness ... and Pavarotti is the king of tackiness. We like to call him  Louche -iano Pavaratti. The died jet-black beard is  highly  implausible, and that fake ever-present smile creeps us out. And then there's that cheesy Three Tenors video where Arnold Shwarzenegger sits in the front row, fairly busting out his tuxedo: That was the moment that  Oswald Spengler  rendered tragically in  Decline of the West . Yuck!  Reuters reports:   "'Alice joyfully invites you to the wedding of daddy Luciano and mummy Nicoletta,' read the invitation from the couple's 11-month-old daughter."  How  cuute . They continue:   "A host of stars, including Irish rocker  Bono  and Italian singer  Zucchero , turned out for the wedding which was eagerly anticipated by Italian gossip magazines and television chat shows."  Well, if  Zucchero  was there, then it must indeed have been an event.  But the true story -- and  The Corsair  is nothing if not a bloodhound on the search for scoop -- lies with  Adua , jilted wife number one.  Somewhere the  urlLink well-paid Adua  is speaking of things Pavarotti from behind clenched teeth and making broad and fast arm movements as is the Italian manner when emotional issues are involved. And boy would I like a translator to decipher  that  scoop.  Because we all understand the language of jilt. What? You mean you've never excavated the archaeology of dumped? It's just me? Okay:  whatever .

       Kids! Larry Clark Was Right    Larry Clark  may have been right about  urlLink Kids . Those little rugrats are spreading the flu like crazy. I mean,  sure , they are  cute  and  urlLink defenseless  and need our care and nurturing, but they are  urlLink spreading this year's flu virus  around like a drunk sailor spending his paycheck on shore leave.  Okay, since we are being frank here, aren't kids sometimes just a little a bit creepy? C'mon! T ake off your PC blinders people!  I'm thinking of  John Singer Sargent's   urlLink rendering of kids, you know what I mean ? Most of the time they are at the periphery of social life, but they just kind of stare at you with these  urlLink knowing eyes .   And their  urlLink heads are all out of proportion  and they have  runny noses  and they  rarely  wash their hands unless you tell them to and they just are a little too fascinated with the  urlLink natural world that surrounds them .   And we are not even going to go into naps (" Wake  up! If you can't take the daily grind ...")and juice containers. It's all about the juice with those little monsters.   What's up with that ?

       The Earth's Magnetic Field Is Weakening!    urlLink MSNBC reports  that the earth's magnetic field "has decreased 10 percent over the past 150 years, raising the remote possibility that it may collapse and later reverse, flipping the planet's poles for the first time in nearly a million years!"  At this current rate of decline (*yawn*), the earth's magnetic field could vanish altogether in 1,500 to 2,000 years (zzzzzz...)  Well,  The Corsair  will be pushing up daisies then, buried possibly at  urlLink Westminster Abbey  next to  Geoffrey Chaucer , so the magnetic field can kiss my grits (originally said by  Polly Holliday , the sassy, older 'socially  unencumbered'  waitress on the 70s hit series  Alice ).  Which brings me to the neat point that as architects came off well after our little national discussion on building design prompted by the downing of the World Trade Center, no earthly disaster -- even a cosmic scale -- could make the job of an " Earth Scientist " a remotely cool way to finance  bling-bling . Studying the earth's magnetic field does not make one a babe magnet.

       Kutcher Pulls Punk'd   You've got to hand it to  Ashton Kutcher , he knows how to  urlLink make an exit  and coin a new verb, "to  punk ." The former model and toyboy of  Demi Moore  is pulling the plug on the red-hot MTV hit show  Punk'd , leaving us all wanting, uhm, (Demi) more.   Foxnews'  web site eulogizes:  " Among Kutcher's victims: singer Nick Lachey, who thought his wife,  Jessica Simpson , had allowed her hillbilly relatives to move their trailer onto his mansion estate, and  Justin Timberlake , who was moved to panic when he thought all his belongings had been seized because he owed $900,000 in back taxes.   "'Today is a sad day for  MTV , but probably a happy day for Hollywood. Celebrities can rest a little easier knowing that the Punkings have ceased,' said  Lois Curren , an  MTV  executive in charge of series development."  But have the punkings ceased? The buzz flying around is that Kutcher is becoming too ubiquitous in his punkings. Hollywood is tipped off to his game. The pranks are getting harder to pull off on jaded, already punch drunk stars. So what better way to snag these unsuspecting A-listers, than to pretend the punking is over.  Or maybe all the  shadenfreude  in the air is making everyone just a little  too  paranoid and it is we who are the punks.

       Bubbling Brown Sugar   To my funny emailer -- and  you know who you are  -- who wanted me to dig up the words to "the song that the kids sang on What's Happeneing,"(and, no, it was not the same episode where  Mr. Dunbar  forced  Raj,   Rerun  and  Dwayne  to bootleg the  Doobie Brothers  concert)  here it is, in public,  in full view :  "Bubbling Brown Sugar  if you feel you want to jump and shout.  Bubbling Brown Sugar  joy is what it's all about.  Bubbling Brown Sugar  bubbling with a happy beat,  Bubbling Brown Sugar  is a stimulating Harlem treat"   There .

       Crying at the Matrix    Choire Sicha  at the very cool  urlLink Gawker  hipped me to this little chestnut of a site that I find quite amusing. It is called  urlLink Group Hug  and it is chock full of confessions posted anonymously. The one I like best runs:  "I went to Matrix 3 with a few of my friends (we're all male). And when the scene came where trinity died, I had to fight and strive to hold back tears so i wouldnt look like a wuss.  "I was unsuccessful, and a tear streamed down my face just as one of my friends looked over at me.   "Subsequently, i wasnt the cool one for the night."  more confessions at:    urlLink http://grouphug.us/

       Sir Mick Jagger Sells Out   It's official: His Satanic Majesty,  Mick Jagger , uhm, make that  Sir Mick Jagger  has  urlLink sold out .  This is an especially sad moment for classic rock afficionados as Mick is the embodiment of good old male rebellion, uhm,  was  the  urlLink embodiment anyway . He was very  Peter Pan I-won't-grow-up  and that was okay. Somehow, life was worth living knowing that at least  conceptually  someone like Mick could exist in a state of perpetual adolescence, knocking up Brazilian supermodels and shaking his booty on a stage even though well into Middle Age.   Alas , the Mick is no more. He joins a long line of pop-knights, like  Sir Paul McCartney  and  Elton John , but neither of those icons lived anti-establishment lives to the degree of Mick. Even  Keith Richards  admits what Mick is too afraid to say:  Jagger saw the Estrablishment as more attractive than the outer periphery, where he laughed at the squares for so many years, and which has richly rewarded him.   In the end, I guess, we all just want to be on the inside; Mick laughed at the squares, and now he wants to be one.  "I think he would probably like to get the same honour himself," Sir Mick said of Richards, questioning his craggy-faced bandmate's motives.   "It's like being given an ice cream - one gets one and they all want one. It's nothing new. Keith likes to make a fuss."   Richards had said to Uncut Magazine that he did not want to go on stage with someone wearing a "coronet and sporting the old ermine", adding: "It's not what the Stones is about, is it?"   No, it's not.

       "I've seen her in her underwear, but I've never seen her with a mop!"    The above quote comes from celebrity dummy  Nick Lachey  speaking on the subject of his wife,  Jessica Simpson , who has eyes the color of weak tea, by the way, in the latest  urlLink Star Magazine .  The interview is significant for several reasons, the most important being:  who the hell gives an interview to Star Magazine  anyway? Isn't  Star  one of those magazines where if one finds oneself ensconsced therein, the right response is to recoil in horror? Don't publicists commit  hare-kare  as a result of the failure to get their clients stories  out  of the pages of Star? Isn't  Star  the embodiment of shadenfreude? Has Star ever run a positive piece about a celebrity?  Apparently Nicko  doesn't mind  -- if you'll excuse the pun. In the interview, when asked if he and his dim wife were worried about overexposure, he replies, "I've always said that's a good problem to have. We're certainly enjoying ourselves."  Okay,  Sally Kirkland!   The interview goes on, painfully:   Star:  "People are fascinated that Jessica made you wait two years, until you were married, to have sex.   Nicko : "I wish it were only two. It was three.   Star:  "And you were faithful the entire time?   Nicko:  "Uh, yeah. Let me give you the exclusive scoop: I wasn't with her because I wanted to sleep with her. If that was the case, I would have been gone early on. I fell in love with her for many other reasons. I was very much dedicated to her and very faithful to her.   Star:  "You've said you'd never even seen her naked before you got married?   Nicko:  "I'm not talking about this stuff. It's not anybody's business."  Uh huh,  urlLink read all about it .  And in other breaking boy band news:  Nick Carter   urlLink fires his manager mother . I know, I don't really care either.

       Andrew Cuomo: The Art of Losing   "The agony of defeat. It seems magnified in a political election, that modern day crusade and zero-sum game. There is no silver medal award for finishing second. Elections consume body and soul.  "My race was great political theater. I was running last year in a primary to defeat George Pataki, who defeated my father Mario Cuomo. The New York press had choreographed the campaign into an Italian opera in which the son was to avenge the father's death. There was no romance in the opera: father dies, and son dies.  "Political loss is unique in that it is public and pervasive. There is no need to whisper in the kitchen 'honey, I didn't get the promotion' after an unsuccessful political campaign, everone knows you lost.  "For me, the pervasive nature of loss became real one day after my withdrawal from the New York governor's race when I was at a gas station. I pulled into a self service station and removed the gas cap. I was excercising all the deliberate caution not to dirty my suit or my tie, which have a proclivity to position itself as a bib for the gas nozzle. I was attempting my personal innovation: wedging the gas cap into the nozzle to avoid having to hold the handle. As this is not easily done, I made several attempts in which the cap fell down and rolled to some inaccessible spot, causing me to have to retrieve it, moving delicately to avoid dirtying myself.  "At this point I looked across the island to see the customer on the other side watching my exhibition. The patron across the way looked at me and said, 'Boy Andrew, losing really stinks -- you even have to pump your own gas.  "Everyone knew. There was no hiding."   Crossroads , Introducion by  Andrew Cuomo .

       The Corsair's Remote Control Tour Diary   We have a few new visitors to  The Corsair , so I'm going to repost this tv tour. If you have already peeped it, please scroll down for the new posts, sorry about that.   There are over  500  cable channels nowadays, so who better to give you a tour of some of the major ones?    Anyhoo:  500 channels means "niche marketing." And with all those niches, things can get confusing as to what is being marketed. So,  The Corsair  will help the viewer through the wonderful world of cable with these pithy explanations,  In Media Res:    TNT : Lousy with Middle aged  Testosterone. A musky-smelling channel.  Bruce Willis  and  Steven Seagal  action flics and basketball. Big in New Jersey.   CNN : Used to be a channel for Kings and Queens and heads of state, but of late it is the channel for cranky retired people with an angry opinion on everything political ("Those libs are holding up Medicaid!"). Poor CNN:  They used to wine and dine with kings and queens, but now they are laying in the gutter eating pork and beans.    Lifetime : A channel earnestly devoted to the smouldering resentments of Midwestern housewives. Husbands are to blame in most of these story lines. Anger is the predominant emotion. Hollywood has not been kind to  Nancy McKeon . Hell hath no fury like  Joanna Kearns  scorned!   Family Channel : The channel devoted to Christians in a nuclear family with a conviction that human history has a purpose beyond this world.  Halleleuia . Lots of  Mary Kate and Ashley films , which, ironically, attract a  very different  sort of crowd than the ones that these cats are aiming after.   CNBC : This channel serves as "White Noise" for the various strip joints in the Wall Street and financial district vicinity. As your  Bud Fox -like trader with a "Lawng Island" accent sips a  Stoli  on the rocks on his lunchbreak, sniffing his "Bolivian white Powder" ("Vitamin C"), getting a "friction dance" from his favorite "dancer," he can look over her shoulder, casually, and catch a brief glance at just how the markets are doing, and get a gauge on when he should return to the office.   A&E : An elderly folks network with lots of  Murder, She Wrote , and "original" films like "Horatio Hornblower," for viewers who can remember their glorious years of service in the British Imperial navy policing those hectic colonial ports.   History : This is the  Hitler  and  Outlaw Biker  channel. At any time of the day, there is a  hilbilly bar with serious discussions going on as to Hitler's "tactical blunders" and what they would have done "different," with this channel serving as the background noise.   Discovery : This is the older, skeevier companion network to the already low rent  History Channel , which means that it attracts a  comparatively downscale sort of viewer  than one would expect at History, which is not saying much at all. Seriously, though, This is the  straight up  serial killers network. No joking, yo. Somewhere in the Yosemite Valley there is a man, in a dungeon, sweating profusely, wearing clown makeup and laughing at the moon. He is surrounded by dog collars and he is described by co workers at the post office as "a solitary man."  Guess which channel this guy is watching to drown out the screams. That's right (sotto voce)  Discovery . Homeland security  must needs  to monitor anyone who watches  more than 3 hours a day of this shit .   VH1 : Perhaps the coolest channel on basic cable or otherwise, my little pomegranates! Suffused with irony, snark and nostalgia, this channel supplies the basic components of the Gen X diet.  Michael Hirschorn  is our god;  we are not worthy .   MTV : No longer cool: a  little  resentful of the joie de vivre its older, more successful brother,  VH1 . It will never be the  80s  again and the blush has wore off that ordinary looking frat boy  Carson Daly . No one over 16 should be watching this channel, even for the misguided purpose of irony.   E!:  Creepy celebrity stalking and gossip. Everyone on this channel reeks of thwarted Hollywood ambitions and plastic surgery gone awry. This channel hasn't had a hit since  Gregg Kinnear   was up in this bitch , and  Jules Asner  snatched  Steven Soderberg , using the Asner name (she divorced  Ed Asner's  son years ago).   ESPN:  This is reality tv for the Maxim set. Faint but palpable homoerotic subtext via "hero worship" of alpha males, like, say,  Shaq  or  Sprewell  (but viewers call him Spree, cause, like, they know him personally in a  Calvin Klein  kind of way), although your average  Joe Fratboy  will never acknowledge that distrubing little truth.   Bravo : For the affluent gay man. Cultural programming( National Dog Show ,  Cirque du Soleil ,  Inside the Actors Studio )  and  Queer Eye For the Straight Guy  rebroadcasts. If you go in for the National Dog Show, collect  Lalique  crystal (" Steuben Glass  is for amateurs"), or the like, then this is your network.   BET : A seriously embarassing network marketed to the seedy stereotype of the urban underclass. Ghetto comedy skits told in unremarkable english with frequent reference to bodily functions;  charmed , I'm sure. Snakeoil selling televangelists prevail over the airwaves on Sundays. And C-List Blaxploitations flix fill out the rest of any regrettable week spent watching this schedule.  urlLink Can you fucking believe that Viacom paid three billion dollars for this channel ?   Sci Fi:  The repressed sexuality channel. Their niche is the grown man who has a crush on the X Man,  Storm  and dreams in full-on video games. Somehow the unresolved "sexual energy" gets worked out into a reverence for the "paranormal." B List hot chicks like  Shannen Doherty  and  Tracy Lords  end up here after Hollywood is through with them.   Fox:  If you go in for  Karl Rove's  talking points, this is the channel for you.  The Corsair  has to admit that he watched it during the  Second Gulf War . Fox routinely scooped the other networks because it sometimes seemed that Rummy gave them the inside scoop. For a "family values network," the women broadcasters have an  oddly pornographic patina  about them. Hmmm.   Showtime:   Tries earnestly to out-extreme the original programming at  HBO , who got there first. Dreams of getting recognized at events like the  Golden Globes ; not likely, however. This is the place to try to pitch your indie documentary on transexual underwater basket weavers in  Micronesia .   Food : For people who's interest in food has transcended the purely phenomenal eating stage.    TLC:  This channel is a bit of a mystery to me. It used to have a niche as a sort of  Cliff Clavin  channel: you know, for the general interest trivia mind-- programming on the  imago  stage of child development, poisonous reptiles, the  Minoan  civilization,  Roman  mosaics, classical biological warfare, the robber barons, volcanoes, that sort of thing. But now it has a lot of "fixing up the home" programming. Go figure what that means.   AMC:  Kind of Cool. Old Hollywood glamour with some original programming and commentary on the Gilded Age of Hollywood. This is like a channel put together by the editors of Variety looking backward. Vanity Fair should do a show here. Old school.   FX:  Not worth talking about. Maxim lite. Loads of testosterone.   We:  Women's fantasy. Lots of  Merchant-Ivory  Brit productions of aristocrats who fall in love with common women, who are often middle aged American divorcees. Pure drivel.   C-Span:  For the ultra political science geek. Viewers tend to look like  urlLink Michael Barone , wait anxiously for their  New Republic  copies to arrive, and chuckle over Senate voting record statistics. Can rattle off the precise wording of the Republican Party platform of 1964.   Oxy:  Very "sisterhood" oriented;  Oprah  and  Gerry Laybourne's  experiment has recently taken a sort of Sapphic detour of late with regard to their programming.   National Geographic:   Interesting and kind of cool. This is a channel about animals and exotic cultures.   IFC:   So earnest, so hip, so anti-Hollywood: yet as soon as  Dinner for Five's  indy star  John Favreau  gets to do a big shlocky Hollywood film like  Elf , he jumps like a Cocker Spaniel being offered a dog yummy. Independent cinema is dead.   TCM:  This is a less hip AMC. This is like AMC with a broken hip. Lots of old movies with no irony or relevant commentary.   Ovation:   The Corsair  has a theory that this is a piece of flotsam adrift on the vast media ocean that is digital television. They repeat the same ten or so programs ad nauseum. Is there anyone employed at Ovation? Did the programmer have a heart attack in the 80s? Did anyone notice? Is anyone watching?   ESPNClassic:  Oh, dear lord help us. Old men with beer bellies reliving "classic sports moments." (At this point,  Bruce Springsteen's   Glory Days  should be playing). This is the tv channel  Al Bundy  would most likely be watching on his day off from the shoe store.   TVLand:   Tries to be all retro-ironical, but street cred will not be forthcoming by running repeats of  Bewitched  and  Sanford and Son , alone. Poor saps. The other networks have bought all the good old tv shows, leaving TV Land to contemplate Mayberry.    Animal:  Television for committed vegans and PETA members. What kind of ad revenue do these guys generate?   Sundance:   An edgy IFC; very left wing political, but  pure .  Robert Redford's  pet liberal project.   Trio:  Perhaps the coolest channel of them all. What VH1 viewers will most likely watch once they quit being ironic, get real jobs in the media and participate in the economy. Used to be a Canadian station, believe it or not. Culture and media navel gazing.   NWI:  A rap up of all the international anti-American news agencies.  Al Gore  wants to buy this station and kick things up a notch.   DiscoveryTimes:   One of the strangest channels in the world. this is actually the  New York Times'  channel, but it is devoted to showing America militarized or in crisis, which, all told, are the moments when  The Old Grey Lady  was at its finest. Lots of Civil rights struggles, war footage, terrorism analysis, and --wierdest of all -- endless looks into our military academies.  What the fuck?!    FUSE:  MTV's unsuccessful competitor for the extreme generation low attention span kiddie market, which is not saying much.   VH1Classic:  Could be interesting, as the X Generation is big on nostalgia, but right now this channel is  not happening.    USA:  This is the sybil channel. It is high testosterone most of the year, but come holiday time it is all about the holidays... kinda like our dads.   Style:  If it is possible this is an even more shallow channel than E! Lots of B-List types talking about the beauty business.  That's all, I hope you liked my thoughts. If you did, bookmark this site.  Cordially,   Ron Mwangaguhunga

       Lawyer-Journos?   The issue of people in the media business who studied to become or were  actually  practicing lawyers fascinates me. Strange as it may seem, there seem to be quite a few lawyers who toss aside the glamour of that most hated of professions to take up work in the media, which, oftentimes seems just as popular a vocation. Think:  Charlie Rose ,  Geraldo Rivera ,  Ann Coulter ,  Steven Brill  ,  Jim Cramer  and even  Laura Ingraham . Do these lawyer-journosl have any characteristics in common?   Well, one thing that fairly leaps at you is their  aggression . Aggression is rewarded in the legal industry, where the term "shark," is, more often than not, a term of  endearment . Ann Coulter exemplifies the lawyer-journo's aggression made good. But my favorite aggression journo lawyer story involves Steve Brill taking -- quite literally -- a bite out of fellow lawyer-journo Jim Cramer back in the heyday of American Lawyer Magazine:  From James Cramer's autobiographical  Confessions of a Street Addict :  "(Brill) never did know when to quit, though, and could not bear to lose at anything. At the firm's summer outing at Brill's Westchester mansion, he divided us into teams, placing us in his pool, and insisted we play a vicious game of water polo where dunking was encouraged and expected. He relished the contact, being a head taller than just about anyone else on the opposing squad, including me. Just as I was about to score what would have been the tying goal for my team, Brill sank his teeth into my throwing arm, spouting blood into the clear water in a steady stream. As everyone looked on in horror, I could only laugh. That was Steve all over."  Oh dear sweet  Jesus .  Ambition is also common to lawyer-journos.  Brooke Astor  took Rose under her wing,  Bloomberg  sponsored his show, and Charlie has been chasing his courtier dreams ever since: whether on 6 0 Minutes II , or at a dinner party at  Tina Brown's , Charlie is all about the bold faced names. Arguably, his entire show could be seen -- if you are feeling particularly cynical -- as a venture in bold faced names.   Bluster  is another quality journo-lawyers have in spades. Geraldo Rivera is not affraid to talk smack and back it up with the old Bronx raspberry once in a while. Geraldo doesn't go by the code of journalists, no, he goes by the Brooklyn Law school tough Newyorican (well, Jewish Newyorican) punchy code. He will punch out white supremacists or threaten to bust a cap in Sadaam Hussein's somewher-in-Bagdad ass.  He's old school like that.   urlLink Geraldo also likes the ladies  and has admitted to pitching woo with  Marian Javits , wife of former New York senator  Jacob Javits ;  Margaret Trudeau ;  Bette Midler , and Liza Minelli (well, partly) among others (hey. it was the 70s, who loves ya baby?.    HyperAchievement  is another factor in the lawyerjourno. Steve Brill's towering  After,  which is perhaps the best account of September 11 th, is a prime example. Actually, Brill's After is probably the greatest rendering of the events surrounding a single day from a single location  ever  created. A mere journo could never have done that, no: only a  lawyer-journo  would have the guts and the towering ambition.   So what have we learned ? One, that journalism, or, work in "the media" is more glamourous than the law. Journalism has what the Japanese call " urlLink face ." Lawyers bring qualities that journos do not necessarily have. And lawyers are often more fun to watch and read than regular journos because they are so hyperagressive and ego-driven. But that's just my opinion.

       Grover Is Evil   Every fairy tale has a villain. Do you remember all the hullabaloo several years ago when cultural investigators finally figured out that  urlLink Bert from Sesame Street was really a passive aggressive evil puppet ? Well, they forgot to mention Grover ...  Grover Norquist  that is. There is no way to underestimate the evil genius of  Grover Norquist ,  Karl Rove's  best friend, one of the dirtiest players in Washington, and a man who has the President of the United States on speed dial. He strides the fence on  K Street  like a mighty colossus, bending America and the world at large to his whimsy. Who would have thought that a man named  Grover  could be so dangerous?   urlLink Grover  has  urlLink made enemies  on the  urlLink left  and the  urlLink far right  and if he weren't so powerful, he would probably be the latest celebrity criminal. Better yet: he would be a celebrity lobbyist criminal -- and  no one likes lobbyists . But money and influence can sweep away scandal -- just ask the Governator; and very few people living have as much influence as that lobbyist called Grover.  Even conservatives have  urlLink trouble with Grover,  who, if I take the meaning of my DC emails, is becoming quite a polarizing figure on the Georgetown scene.  But the most interesting line about  urlLink Grover  making the rounds in DC is that he might have been the man who convinced the White House into  urlLink airlifting shady Saudi nationals  out of the US immediately  urlLink following 9/11 .   urlLink This guy  is Darth Vader evil.

       Has Jump the Shark Jumped the Shark?    Jump the Shark  has  urlLink chronicled the moments  when tv shows and bands have put on their leather jackets and attempted to waterski over the holding pens of apex predators to keep their street cred.   Starting as a web site, then slipping into the  urlLink publishing  realm, the average Gen Xer felt proud that   urlLink John Hein's  ingenious contribution to the English language was becoming a mini-empire of sorts.  I mean  , someone had to hold powerful and shadowy men like Asaad Kelada's  feet to the flame when they hoisted that noxious flame-haired country music child star  Danny Cooksey , aka "Sam" from  Diffrn't Strokes  on us to be "the new cute kid."  Pshaw !  What does any Gen Xer want to do anyway when we are not doing the important things in life? We like to "pop culture reference." And no, I don't know why we do, maybe it's a latchkey thing, I don't know, but boy do we like to make up lists and impress each other with our knowledge of pop culture trivia (for example,  Mr. Drummond  was played by the unforgettable  Conrad Bain , hows that for spiffy? Just don't ask me who played the dizzy  Aunt Sophia ).  Cue to 2004, and the creation of "Jump the Shark" the  urlLink desk calendar .  The Corsair  wants to feel the love for JTS, back in the day when it was only a website and was, for lack of a better word,  fresh .  Oh how I chuckled as posters blasted  Janet Jackson's  underwritten character  Cleo  for ruining  Fame , or when that mop haired little girl ruined  Growing Pains  (what's that? Growing Pains was never worth a peep?), or when Edna's Edibles (run by the indomitable  Charlotte Rae , thank you very much) fucked up the whole girls in private school scenario. But the blush is off the rose, dear friends; Jump the Shark has officially bitten the big one exceding it's reach and mandate. Ah well, we'll always have the memories and those cheesy retrospectives on TV Land.

       Is NY 1 CBS's Farm League?    Duke Castiglione .  Andrew Kirtzman .  Jay Dow .  Kerri Lyon .  Now  Arthur Chien . It reads like a Who's Who of the NY broadcast news biz. All four talented reporters were originally  NY1  talent "poached" by  CBS NY  in only the past year. CBS NY is shanghaing NY1's videojournalists like sailors out of the 19th Century, with one difference, of course: unlike those luckless shanghaied, the NY1 staff is voluntarily leaving the scrappy local 24-hour Time Warner news service. As the hierarchy dictates, CBS trumps NY1, so there is nothing anyone can really do about the loss of familiar faces on the 24 hour channel. This leaves me wondering: Has NY1 become a farm league for CBS NY to pilfer at will?

       It's Official: Porn is the Mainstream   Since 1905  Variety  has reported on Tinseltown's business, but it has studiously ignored the seedier side of the business down in the San Fernando Valley, namely, the  porn industry . You know, the industry that moved out at, like, 15 -- okay, ran away -- and ended up living on the "wrong side of the street"? Even the name suggests an aura of up-to-no-good. No, Variety wanted to keep face; Variety was not about that; Variety would cover  Nicholson ,  BO ,  prexy changes  and  helmers .  No longer. Add the verb  porning  to the Variety lexicon.  Variety Magazine , the essential rag for the film and tv industry here in the US has started an official porn blog called  urlLink The Porning Report , which means that the $10 billion dollar a year industry is now about as close to legit as it has ever been.   Imagine if 100 years from now Pa ris Hilton , whose porn tape was viewed en masse in bars and offices, was the one who liberated porn.

       Conde Nast Dish with Joan Didion and Meghan Daum   Okay, pull your chairs up close to the screen and grab a handful of unsalted popcorn while  Daddy Corsair  reads to you from the latest  Black Book  interview with everyones favorite intellectual rail-thin porcelain doll-looking literati  Joan Didion  and  urlLink Meghan Daum  in  urlLink Black Book .  They dish on  Conde Nast . Meghan goes first:  "I was mistaken for a messenger one time, walking into 350 Madison Avenue I was so bedraggled and poorly dressed. They stopped me at the desk and told me to take the freight elevator and I said, 'I'm an assistant.' I'm really curious to talk to you about this, because that was '92 and it was the closest I felt I came to a glamourous literary job. I knew nothing about fashion. I had no interest in it -- I pronounced Versace as Versayce -- but its interesting how the fashion world is intrinsically linked to being a writer for women. It's so interesting because it ties in to this idea that a long time ago that the Seven Sisters College embodied a sensibility that was directly parallel to the culture of Conde Nast and that somehow, throughout time, both cultures have been perverted by various social forces."   Didion:  Yeah, the people in charge of Conde Nast saw themselves in loco parentis, really. They had all these young children who came to work for them, and they took care of them in a sense.   Black Book:  What would you attribute to the change in that culture?   Meghan:  Maybe cocaine (both laugh)

       It's Official: Architects Are The New Black   In the aftermath of September 11, many seismic cultural shifts occurred below the media radar. One of the most interesting is that the unlikely  Daniel Liebeskind  became a household name. From out of obscurity onto the pages of  Page Six  and  Vanity Fair ,  and even  urlLink The New Yorker ,  urlLink architects and graphic designers  are, for lack of a better word,  cool .  To paraphrase  Huey Lewis and the News , it's hip to use a  T Square .  In the January 2004  Vanity Fair   they profile some of the more  high profile  members of the design community.  The Corsair  has to admit, there is a sort of high bohemian aesthetic hipness to those cool cats. Clad in black and sporting interestingly designed glasses (do all architects wear glasses? Or is it some  Machiavellian  stunt to achieve the effect of great learning?)  I mean, successful members of the design community represent both the ancient and the modern: the reside at the nexus point at which technology and art achieve confluence. Their hair is bad in that  nurtured in the wilderness  manner that suggests genius and, at the very least, a touching lack of personal vanity. They wear strange Modernist jewelry informed by the religious symbols of far flung exotic lands. Their vocabulary is nebulous, as rendered famously by  the smart sister who went to Brandeis  in  Hannah and her Sisters ; they know their way around words like "space" and "grid" and "unrealized," yet their millieu is quite substantive -- glass, for example, and titanium.  Let's face it: Architects, who once were lumped in one notch below chemical engineers in the hipness game,  are the new black . Their resume is so much more weighty than yours or mine. If I walk into a bar and hit on a leggy hot chick, I might, out of the side of my mouth mention that I had a great  urlLink interview with David Lynch , and that he had to delay his flight to preside over the jury at  Cannes  to talk to me. Cool, right? You'd think so: you'd think that I get the girl. And in a just and rational universe I would get the girl. But this is not a rational universe. Now, imagine if an architect walks in. What has he done lately? asks the hot chick, gamely.  Nothing much  says he from behind large spectacles. He's just designed the  Saidye Bronfman Center  in  urlLink Montral.   Ka-blam ! And just like that I'm buying him a drink while he's discussing breakfast options for the morning after with wifey.  Let's face it: it's an architect-designed world and we are just renting space.

       Billary Shrugged   " Howard Dean  laughed.  " urlLink He stood boldly at the edge  of a political crossroads. The nomination lay slightly ahead of him. A frozen explosion of granite burst in flight to the sky over the motionless establishment. The Democratic Party Establishment seemed immovable. The establishment had the stillness of one brief moment in battle when thrust meets thrust and the currents are held in a pause more dynamic than motion. The stone glowed, wet with sunrays."   Submitted for your approval:   The Fountainhead  a la  Howard Dean  and his Rage Against the Party Machine campaign. So let's review what has happened thus far in the Democratic primary soap operetta, shall we?  Al Gore , out from the wilderness of a Japanese trip (whiskey commercial?)decides, rather abruptly -- okay,  very  abruptly -- to endorse  Howard Dean , the hard charging but affable former Governor of Vermont, in the process  bitchlapping  his loyal former running mate Senator  Joe Lieberman  in the process, effectively ending that man's bid at the Presidency.  Lieberman isn't the only one to get Gored.  Billary  faced real damage by this endorsement which, obviously, contained some spite, as Dean is the  anti-DLC Billary candidate . Al never got over the Lewinsky; even Monica's over it, but not our Albert. Gore Vidal, a relation, once quipped on the Gore family that if a poisonous snake were to bite a Gore, it would die, envenomated.  We get his point .  God it must suck to be Billary right now. Gore, in playing Kingmaker to Dean, places himself smack dab in the path of Hillary as being the de facto leader and moral voice of the Democratic Party. He also puts a thumb in the eye of his former boss, Bill Clinton, insinuating himself in his wifes path, rejecting a his boss' legacy  in which he himself was a prime player , and aiding and abetting the enemy.  Everywhere, Bill Clinton's legacy is being torn to pieces. The recent elections in Ireland had caused Clinton's Good Friday Accords to evaporate. The Democratic Party has repudiated Clinton's centrism and veered back to the left. The golden age of the 90s has been dismissed as irrational exhuberance. Everyone and their brother has a book out calling attention to Clinton's Rwanda failure. Clinton backed milk dud munching geek  Gray Davis  got his ass handed to him on a platter by the Governator; Clinton's team now works for  Wesley Clark , whose candidacy is about as thin as the hair atop  Donald Trump's  head. Even  Linda Tripp  was awarded back pay.  Billary shrugged indeed.

       Paris: Troubled Teen In Love With Her Reflection    Paris Hilton  attended a school for troubled kids? No!  Say it aint so !  urlLink The National Enquirer  gives us the lowdown on Paris Hilton's brief stay at the exclusive  urlLink CEDU school in Running Hills, Ca . The website for the school says:  "CEDU High is an emotional growth boarding school for adolescents who exhibit behavioral and learning difficulties. The curriculum has three cornerstones: The original CEDU Emotional Growth program; college preparatory academics; and an outstanding outdoor adventure program. Woven through this triangle is an enriching theme of visual and performing arts. CEDU High School is the original emotional growth boarding school. Since 1967, it has worked with teens and families to redirect negative behavior, teach vital life skills, create academic success, and reunite families."  There are a million rather snarky comments  The Corsair  could make about "performing arts," and Paris Hilton and "negative behavior" and Paris Hilton, but we shall refrain.  Oh, how we shall refrain .    Anyway , back to the  Enquirer  because  enquiring minds want to know.     Patricia Shipp  writes:  "(Paris) acted like royalty from the time she arrived until she made her escape -- by limousine -- after two months, charges the source, who attended the school with the hotel heiress.   "'She was a mess from day one,' the insider told The ENQUIRER. 'She was such a spoiled brat that the other rich kids were disgusted with her too!'  "Paris was admitted into the school partly to help her to stop her abuse of drugs and alcohol, but all she talked about was finding a way to get out.   "'She arrived with several bags of designer luggage like she was going to a resort on vacation. She was more concerned about what she was wearing and what shade of makeup to put on rather than talking about her problems.'   "Stuck-up and in love with her reflection, she threw a fit when she learned she could wear only the jeans, T-shirts and sweatshirts supplied by the facility, divulged the insider.   "'But that was nothing compared to the tornado she created when they told her  absolutely no makeup .   "'Oh, my God! I thought the end of the world was coming the way she reacted to the rules. If Paris wasn't crying, she was angry -- refusing to eat the food or figuring out how to escape.   "'Everyone was expected to do assigned chores and to participate in group discussions -- but Paris did nothing, except cry like a baby.'"   The Corsair  has absolutely no comment.  urlLink Judge for yourself .

       Eminem and the Secret Service   My friends at  urlLink Moneyjungle.org  are taking on the  Eminem   contretemps, lock stock and smoking barrel, so you better recognize !

And our philosophy is very pro-life,  namely my own . I'm too cute to die.   Anyhoo :  Moneyjungle  says:  "The thing is, I don?t think Eminem is the problem. I don?t even think it?s rap music. I think it?s a much larger problem. I think it is the ?urban? agenda - a close ally of the  urlLink ol?homosexual agenda  in the battle for our hearts and minds? it?s ruining our country. I mean, first Bob Marley shoots the sheriff. Then Ice-T is telling kids to kill cops and now they have set their sites on the president. And we?re at war.   "Does Eminem have no shame?"

       She's Easy Like Sunday Morning    urlLink Star Magazine , that significant cultural artifact, shows us some of the interesting footage that didn't  quite  make the cut at Fox TV's hit  The Simple Life , starring  Paris Hilton  and  Nicole Ritchie . Our favorite little chesnuts:  "They were kind of pumping gas at the  Exxon  for one or maybe two days but they didn't do much," says  Chris Trotter , who works at the gas station/grocery store. "They pumped a few cars, but just for the cameras. Fox offered $5 off a tank of gas to get a lot of people to come in [to the station] those days."   and:  "I heard Paris say that it was just innocent flirting, but I think it was a lot more than that," insists Trotter. "She hooked up with several guys."   Oh that  urlLink Uptown Girl  livin  urlLink la vida loca !

       Gore Comes To Harlem   Forget about  urlLink Cotton , Al Gore has come to Harlem to endorse Dean! But his trip is, uhm,  quixotic  for two reasons:  1) Harlem is the location of the office of  Bill Clinton -- the biggest cat in the jungle -- who is all but against the  Dean  run. Dean is the anti-Democratic candidate (read: Anti-Clinton- Terry McAuliffe  , centrist DLC, moneygrubbing, poll taking, lowdown suckas). So this brings up the thorny question:  why Harlem , Al? Did you really have to take it to the 'hood? So it's like that, brother?  2)  Joe Lieberman , Gore's Vice Presidential pick, was completely  urlLink blindsided . Actually bitchslapped is a more accurate description, but try as we might, the image of Gore bitchslapping the stately Senator from Connecticut didn't pass muster. At the very least it was  bad manners , at its worst, um, it's pretty bad (The Corsair can imagine Washingtonians like socialite  Sally Quinn  covering her mouth and whispering into beltway insider  Ben Bradlee's  ear:  oh no he didn't ).  So, when is Lieb going to pull out?  The Corsair  is talking all predictions at  papermag@yahoo.com . My own bet is before the end of December, and his withdrawal will be a nasty  urlLink Zell Miller  type affair. We cannot wait to watch how Lieberman handles his treatment at the hands of the Democrats.  At this moment,  Bill Clinton  is sitting in  urlLink Sylvia's in Harlem  on his lunch hour, sampling the  urlLink smothered pork chops , hungrily eyeing the women of 125th street contemplating his next move.  Bill Clinton's old school like that.

       Checkmate: White Knight to Rescue Lord Black: The Canadian Media Invasion Begins   Will  Mort Zuckerman  be the white knight to rescue  Lord Black  and the embattled Hollinger, Inc, and, more important, will the media ever stop preceding Hollinger with  embattled ? That cannot be good for the share price.  Oh, it's all good,  The Corsair  is only having a little bit of  shadenfreude  at the expense of the mogul Canadians. And you can bet your black clothing that somewhere,--somehow --  Graydon Carter  is lighting up, secretly avoiding the Blooberg's finest and chuckling at the end of irony and this curious media development.   Chris Tryhorn  of the Guardian  urlLink writes :  "Mr.Zuckerman, who owns the Daily News tabloid is the latest high-profile figure to be touted as a potential white knight who might rescue Lord Black's companies.  "According to reports, Lord Black is hoping to persuade him to invest in Hollinger and is not in talks to sell any of his titles, which include the  Daily Telegraph ,  the Spectator  magazine and the  Jerusaleum Post .  "Mr Zuckerman, like Lord Black, was born in Canada and made his fortune in Boston real estate and has owned the market-leading  Daily News  for the past decade."  In  Richard Sikios'  1995 book  Shades of Black  he tells a compelling story of how  Mort Zuckerman  beat out  Lord Conrad Black   to buy the   NY Daily News .  urlLink Black  eventually went on to back the  urlLink New York Sun .   urlLink Lord Black of Crossharbour  was always a fan of the New York scene and was after an American flagship. In 1992 he met  Barbara Walters  at a cocktail party in London. Walters suggested to Lord Black (okay, I just like saying that) that he talk to her investment banker friend  John Veronis  about buying the troubled Daily News. Lord Black did and things started rolling.  He assessed that the  Daily News  was overmanned and needed a new printing plant, but, as a businessman, approached it all from the point of view of getting a "a good deal or no deal."  Enter Mortimer Zuckerman , an individual not tied to any company or justifications for his purchases.   Zuckerman made his wealth in real estate and wanted "face" in the New Yorkmedia swirl after buying  US News and World Report  and  The Atlantic . Black and Zuckerman initially talked about buying the venture together.  David Radler . president of Hollinger, Black's company, told Siklos:  "At one point (Zuckerman) talked, for instance, that we would switch every year who would control the editorial page."  Conversations broke down and a bidding war ensued.  Rupert Murdoch  weighed in, unsurprisingly, on the side of fellow conservative Lord Black. "I think Conrad would be very good for the News," said Murdoch at the time,"and he'd be better still for the city."  On August 17 Lord Black offered $75 million of  Hollinger  money and won backing of both the Board of Directors and management of the  Daily News.  Zuckerman won the drivers and pressmens unions. In the end Zuckerman won because he offered a more positive vision for the company as an individual buyer not linked to a corporation. Lord Black would have had to cut jobs to justify the purchase to investors in Hollinger. C'est tout!

       Russ Smith On Michael Wolff    Where did I go wrong  and  how is it truly done , seem to me to be the laments arising, prayer-like, from  Russ Smith's   urlLink  tender assessment of Michael Wolff  in, of all places, the embattled  Hollinger Inc's    New York Sun .  Can I too be a  daddy cool   of the media, Michael?  Lunch with me , oh successful media critic, and tell me where I went  awry  ...  "Mr. Wolff is the quintessential caricature of Manhattan’s insulated, effete, and self-important insider," writes the scrappy  Russ Smith , by way of wind up. But from then on, (and on) the drool quotient increases arithmetically as Russ does a one hundred and eighty degree turn from his usual role as irascible conservative, now trying on the ermine hat and spaniel-like eyes of the courtier.  Please,  Michael Wolff , invite  Mugger  to  Michaels  and put him out of his ass kissing misery! We actually kind of liked him when he took on the power elite of this city and Washington, arms swingling, eyes closed,broad haymakers rarely, if ever, connecting with the intended smug liberal media target: it was somehow  touching .  But now Smith continues, shamelessly, nose shaded an autumnal brown:  "Mr. Wolff, along with a group of investors including advertising legend  Donny Deutsch , is one of the bidders for New York magazine, which is currently up for sale.  At the same time, he has been discussing with  Roger Ailes  a possible television slot on  Fox News .   Please step lively, butwatch the drool. Smitty goes on:  "Mr. Wolff holds court at  Michael’s  — the favored restaurant for such worthies — nearly every day; he’s a frequent talk-show guest; he owns a Rolodex that’s the envy of competitors; and he is a regular on the lecture circuit. He speculates at will on the failures and successes of companies such as  TimeWarner ,  News Corp ., the  New York Times ,  Viacom ,  Vivendi , and  Condé Nast , and the (mostly) men who run them.   "He’s on a first-name basis with  Rupert Murdoch .   One can almost feel the pathos, the longing; but it is not over:  "One attribute Mr. Wolff possesses, however, separates him from all the other vain characters who read the  New York Observer  every Wednesday to see if their name is mentioned (if only that paper had an index!): He’s got thick skin and is less prone to hold grudges than most of his lunch companions."  And surely Russ Smith would be an excellent one of those lunch companions.    The Corsair  can feel the love and -- dare we say it? --  envy  from over here (envy is great weakness of the writer, after all), even at the far end of the rarified media elite precincts.   The Corsair  would like to suggest that  Mugger  get himself a blog, as he will get far greater visibility in this manner than as a columnist for the moribund and irrelevant  urlLink New York Press .  And good luck on that invite to Michaels.

       David Brooks: Brother From Another Planet   For a month now I have been reading  David Brooks'   urlLink Op Ed column  for the  New York Times , trying for the life of me to get his angle. Now, I belive I have.  David is the  urlLink Brother From Another Planet  ... a Conservative soul brother, to be sure (hereafter  The Corsair  will call him  Brooks Brother ), giving us the lowdown on his sometimes humerous encounters with those wacky liberals.  It is not so much that David is an alien being to the eastern seaboard media-- he is not: he just  writes  in a manner that calls to attention his  cultural  differences with the Upper West Side of Manhattan, like in his December 6th letter to  Tom deLay  on the conditions of this third rock from the sun:  "Dear Tom:  "This week I read that you have abandoned plans to house Republicans safely on a cruise ship off the island of Manhattan during the G.O.P. convention in New York this summer. Have you paused to consider what this will mean?  "It will mean that instead of spending time in a secure environment offshore, kind, decent Republicans will be wandering innocently among packs of inflamed New York liberals. They'll be subjected to long harangues that rely heavily on the words 'multilateral,' 'Kyoto' and 'John Ashcroft.' They'll get condescending looks when they go into a deli and order a strawberry and chocolate chip bagel with pineapple cream cheese ? a perfectly acceptable bagel option in most suburbs. They will na?vely pick up  The Village Voice , thinking it contains small-town news.   "When the Utah delegation pauses to say grace before dinner at  Elaine's , the cultural dissonance will be so great it will be measurable on the Richter scale.   "Tom, New York is not a place where Republicans can feel at home. New York has Central Park, which is a large pastoral area without a single putting green. It is a city with nearly eight million people, none of whom own riding mowers. "  Very funny,  Brooks Brother , but also an interesting expression via irony of the sociological differences between the Bush red states and the Gore blue states.  Our man from the planet Conservative, in the Evangelica star system, goes further:  "New Yorkers suffer from liberal anhedonia, which is the inability to derive pleasure from grossly oversized pieces of machinery. So when a Republican starts a perfectly normal conversation about the glories of his powerboat, snowmobile, combine or hemi, the liberal is likely to screech out something about the ozone layer.  "New York is a city of strange rituals. The people live in these vertical gated communities they call apartment buildings, but they don't seem to have normal family structures. If a Martian landed in a Manhattan playground, he would conclude that human beings start out small and white, and grow up to become middle-aged Jamaican women. In Manhattan, when an oldest child turns 12, entire families disappear overnight."   The Corsair  likes the part about the Jamaican nannies, which is a deadly accurate spitoon, just dropped out of the side of the mouth as if it were an aside, rolled down the 92nd Street Y, and taking out a phalanx of pink-shirted NPR-listening yuppies like bowling pins. The Jamaican Nannies are a staple of the  Upper West Side , like Balducci's,  and PBS tote bags, and are just as appreciated.   Also the idea that children going off to boarding schools at 12, which is fairly odd in other parts of the country, is also a keen Brooksian observation.   The Corsair  likes  David Brooks'  offbeat but culturally significant columns on the experience of an  offworlder  in Upper Manhattan.

       Hillary on Stephanopoulos?!   Fresh from visiting war torn  Afghanistan  and  Iraq ,  Senator Hillary Clinton  visited hostile territory in the form of  George Stephanopouols'  failing ABC Sunday chat show.  Sunday morning after the snowstorm:  The Corsair  is channel surfing and nearly pours his Kenyan blend coffee all over himself when he spies, on ABC,  George Stephanopoulos  interviewing Hillary Clinton on his show, with  George Will  sitting in for cross examining honors. What the fuck?!  Is this the same  George Stephanopoulos , who, in his Clinton years memoir  urlLink All Too Human  (All Too Ambitious), wrote luridly of  The First Lady  breaking down and crying during a Whitewater strategy session?  Yes, it was. And is that the same George Will that used to snidely criticize the dignity of  Bill Clinton ?  Yes it was.   Whatever your political background, you have to admit that Hillary -- a  Scorpio , to be sure -- is racking up military cred not only on the  Senate Armed Services Committee .

       Jack Valenti's Screening Room   Ultra sleazy Washington lobbyist and  MPAA  head  Jack Valenti   took a bit of an ass whipping at the hands of Federal Judge  Michael B. Mukasey  in New York.   Citing "unlawful restraint of trade," that the MPAA's "screener ban" would significantly harm independent films, Mukasey granted a preliminary injunction, effective immediately,  urlLink blocking the policy .  Falling back on the old chesnut that screeners are major sources of piracy,  we won't entertain the possibility   that old Jack is trying to protect the Oscar from deserving independent films, who have cleaned the clocks of the tired, formulaic old studios. No ... our Jack wouldn't do that. He's much too "ethical."  In other news,  urlLink Louisiana Congressman Billy Tauzin  is slated to take over from  urlLink Valenti soon . Why would a powerful Republican in the majority party want to become head of the embattled MPAA?   A $1.03 million salary might be incentive. How about that sweet screening room at MPAA's Washington headquarters (perhaps third in coolness behind the White House screening room and Steven Spielberg's), then there are the orchestra seats at the Oscars, and first class travel to film festivals.   Ah, the line between  urlLink K Street  and, er, uhm,  urlLink K Street  is blurred.

       Siegler Sued: Fuggedabouddit!   Meadow pinched? Hey! Whatsamatta you?  urlLink Media Life Magazine  reports that  Soprano's  troublemaker  and thwarted teen singing sensation  Jamie-Lynn Sigler  has stepped into the proverbial  Pasta Fazool .  "Sigler is facing a lawsuit from her talent agency for unpaid fees. According to  Writers & Artists Group , the agency negotiated for Sigler to continue playing Meadow Soprano for the fifth and sixth seasons of the show and is therefore still owed a 10 percent commission. The agency is asking for at least $40,000 in damages."   The Corsair  thinks that  Paulie Walnuts  and  Christopher Moltisanti   should go talk to those pansy-assed "writers" and " artistes"  and take care of "that thing" by making them an offer they can't refuse--  ninja style !

       Graydon Carter: Civil Rights Leader    Mahatma Gandhi .  Martin Luther King .  Nelson Mandela .  Susan B. Anthony . Now, we have libertarian  Graydon Carter  to add to that pantheon of  urlLink civil rights leaders .  'Cause my favorite gossip read,  Page Six , said so:  "Carter seemed surprised by his new persona as a civil-rights leader. 'I make the front page of the [International]  Herald Tribune  not for having written a great book or having painted a great picture or anything, but for having an ashtray in my office.'"  As an occasional inbiber in tobacco products,  The Corsair  tips his pirate hat to Conde Nast's resident libertarian in tribute. Man-to-man, Graydon:  Conde Nasties of the world, Flame on!  But, alas, I blogged too soon. Page Six continues:  "No longer. His spokeswoman said, 'There are no ashtrays.' And a source who works nearby told PAGE SIX: 'I haven't smelled smoke coming out of his office this week.' Sounds like surrender."   Oh, say it aint so Graydon; say it aint so !

       MSNBC Layoffs    The Drudge Report  reports that  urlLink MSNBC  is giving out seasons beatings of a sort -- employees are finding that tis the season to be sorry:  urlLink layoffs .   What?  Jesse Ventura's   urlLink America -- the hungry man's  Savage Nation  -- is not garnering those premium sponsors?  Sheesh .   MSNBC, like Michael Jackson, has identity issues. It is not conservative or liberal and isn't aware that reruns of  Matt Lauer's   Headliners and Legends  is not the way to rivet important demographics to the tube, unless the  networkette  thinks viewers are interested in watching his hairline recede; which, incidentally, we are not.   How long before  Microsoft  realizes that this experiment in television has gone  horribly awry  and divests?  The Corsair  gives it nine months, all told.

       Rating David Brooks   The time has come to grade the  urlLink Satuday Op Ed of David Brooks , our favorite Brother from another planet. This week was a welcome surpise, compared to  urlLink last week's boiler plate special  that seemed to be a victim of deadline rather than good use for the most important sounding board in the Western world.  Brooks serves us two scoops of yummy Beltway sorbet in the form of some of the content of the President's State of the Union Address. Brooks begins rather confidently:  "Not long ago, a man who runs a construction company came to the White House to meet with a senior Bush administration official. He talked economic policy, then was asked how his business was going.  "He said things were going well. Orders were up. He'd revamped his I.T. system, and he'd re-engineered his production process so he'd been able to reduce his work force to 7,200 from 9,800.  "You can imagine the reaction as he dribbled out this final bit of good news."  No,  David Brooks , we, lowly and untethered to the  inside beltway  that is Washington DC  , do not have the contact with the Administration that you do , but we can guess. Call us  outsiders , David Brookie!  Blindly and in vain, we can guess , O lord: out of the Divine Light of  Karl Rove , flailing in the darkness of the GOP in the wilderness, we can only guess in  error . To be sure, our  guesses  would not be anything near in approximating your divine  knowledge  of, say, the  name  of the construction company owner.  You see,  Brother Brooks  is saying in his signature offhand way that  someone  in the administration  told  him that story and they probably did. Brookie is top drawer right now, he is  urlLink The Republican at the New York Times . He is  useful , especially in those swing states and in communicating with the East Coast Establishment.  And in that mutually dependent  urlLink cha-cha , carried out discretely across those blue states, the Administration slips David some scoop in his lapel; scoop in the form of  SOTU  (State of the Union, my little pomegranate) content:  "In his State of the Union address, the President will announce measures to foster job creation. In the meantime, he is talking about what he calls the Ownership Society.  "This is a bundle of proposals that treat workers as self-reliant pioneers who rise through several employers and careers. To thrive, these pioneers need survival tools. They need to own their own capital reserves, their own retraining programs, their own pensions and their own health insurance.  "Administration officials are talking about giving unemployed workers personal re-employment accounts, which they could spend on training, child care, a car, a move to a place with more jobs, or whatever else they think would benefit them.  "President Bush has a proposal to combine and simplify the confusing morass of government savings programs and give individuals greater control over how they want to spend their tax-sheltered savings. Administration officials hope, in a second term, to let individuals control part of their Social Security pensions and perhaps even their medical savings accounts."   Pioneers ? "Give individuals greater control over how they want to spend their tax-sheltered savings"? Having "individuals control part of their Social Security pensions and perhaps even their medical savings accounts."   Hmm . Interesting ( The Corsair  rubs his chin in recognition of an interesting idea). I thought the President was going to rattle off a Moon program,  urlLink reacting to the Chinese mission , unfocused, silly. Been there done that, was my reaction to  Cheney's  latest treat bag to the aero-space-defense industry.  But this ... this.  Hmmm . It smacks of  vision . It smacks of  policy wonkishness , of  make the economy of prime importance .  Yes ... yes. It is not the  urlLink McGrocery list that Bill Clinton used to read  at the  urlLink SOTU , you know, the Fillet O' Fish, the Dunkin Doughnuts Kruller, the more charter schools, the Egg McMuffin, the tax credits for stay-at-home parents -- but you get the picture.  The speech has not yet happened, so there is still time for the President to mess things up, but this is an  interesting  piece of news and  David Brooks  did a good job. So, up from last week's  C-minus , we give Brookie and  A.

       Entourage versus Entourage: P Diddy v Jesus   As I noted yesterday, entourages have had a  risorgimento  in recent days.  The Corsair  would like to compare and contrast two of the more influential entourages in the past, oh, say, two millenia or so, namely:  urlLink P Diddy's  and  urlLink Jesus Christ's .   Violence? Both entourages have caused a ruckus at one time or another.  urlLink P Diddy's entourage poked NY Times Boldface columnist Joyce Wadler in the ribs . That's pretty roughneck, but JC has P Diddy beat:  urlLink Peter, one of the leaders of Christ's entourage, sliced off the ear of Roman soldier Malchus  -- and  JC healed him !  VIPs? JC has got P Diddy beat again. It goes without saying that P Diddy bestrides the earth on CP time, and is it well known that he basically unhooks any velvet rope that bars entry for him and his crew. He's old school like that. P Diddy is not seperated from any event in the world. The velvet rope is not an impediment to having his drink on,  fa sure, nah mean ? That's cool: but JC is cooler. Pearly gates? No problem.  urlLink JC can get his entourage into the most exclusive club of them all:   heaven !  And, finally: Influence? Well, P Diddy's entourage is blazing with bling-bling, up and coming rappers, publicists and beefy former bouncers. But what about the future? What do these guys do after the gravy train dries up? Probably 3 to 5 in Sing Sing. ( Kidding.  Can''t you guys take a joke about Jesus and P Diddy? Sheesh.)    Anyhoo:  The influence of JCs crew goes as far and wide as sub-saharan Africa, Central and South America and Western civilization, through the  urlLink Early desert fathers , through the  urlLink scholastic monks  of the Medieval era, to the Roman Catholic Church, to the Protestants up to todays Evangelicals.   So,  The Corsair  concludes that Jesus of Nazereth had a cooler entourage than the  P, I double D.  Respect.  ( The Corsair  hope no one took offense at this largely playful Christmastime comparison. In toher words, please P Diddy, don't hurt me!)

There is not much to say on that subject except that we disagree:  urlLink Senator John Kerry has the best coif . Basta!

       Only Geeks Understand   With today's high level announcement that  The Pope  has praised  Mel Gibson's  rendering of  urlLink the last 24 hours in the life of Jesus Christ , the question arises: can only true blue fans-as-directors garner the  highest  excitement from the filmgoing public?  There is precedent to this theory. The geek directed spectacular  LOTR  broke worldwide records for an opening on a Wednesday (Wednesdays!) pulling in $34.1 million in the US and $23.5 million in over a dozen other countries.  Spiderman is a similar story:  urlLink Spidergeek Sam Raimi  hit a grand slam in his vision for the Marvel comic here.  Sharon Waxman  wrote in  urlLink yesterday's NY Times :  "In the United States, the film, a  New Line Cinema  release, broke the box-office record for an opening in December. The record holder for opening-day ticket sales remains "Spider-Man," which took in $39.4 million on May 3, 2002, according to  Exhibitor Relations , a company that tracks box-office sales."  In  urlLink Wednesday's NY Times ,  David Edelstein  wrote:   "Wandering around ( The Loews Theater  on 42nd Street), I saw people reading  Tolkien .  Miriam Kriss  put down her book to explain that she was there in tribute to  Peter Jackson , ' fan who understood.'Then she delivered a rather stunning tribute to the fan aesthetic: 'The problem with the last  George Lucas   Star Wars  movies is that he's not a fan of his own work. You can't be if it's your work. But he doesn't understand anymore why we loved  Star Wars . He just sits and stares at special effects on his computers. I'd rather see  Star Wars  movies by people who grew up with  Star Wars . A fan would get it.'"  A fan would  get it?   A fan who understood ? Yes, my little pomegranates, the  urlLink AintItCoolNews gang  are spending their hard earned milk dud-stained dollars on  films , sending shockwaves through Timseltown.  Take  Harry Potter ,  urlLink for instance . By all accounts of fans, the film was faithful to the book, and, as a result, it got rave reviews as a sort of  urlLink visual analog representation  of the impression  JK Rowling's  tale left on the reader. The rave reviews translated into extreme urlLink box office  (I always wanted to say that and sound like a Variety insider, forgive the pretention).  So, will Hollywood turn the reigns of film over to the geeks? Will Hollywood -- the epitome of cool cachet -- become like Silicon Valley?  Will the geek inherit the world ?   Time will tell ...

       Michael Not Biological Father of His Kids?   That significant cultural artifact and guilty pleasure  The National Enquirer  is reporting that the biological father of Jacko's kids may be  urlLink an anonymous sperm donor .  The article, which, with the tabloid, goes on sale today, but is teased online  urlLink here  goes on to say, "Jackson was also caught in a lie about his third child  Prince Michael II , (the article) tells how his credibility could become a major issue in the child molestation case."  In other Jackson news,  Machiavellian  lawyer  Mark Gregaros , on  urlLink Larry King  last night, tried to quell the hullabaloo over Jacko's Nation of Islam "conversion," and whether or not  urlLink Metternichian   Johnny Cochran  was going to replace him, saying:  "The fact of the matter is -- you want to know where this originates from? It's the PR firm that the prosecution hired ... And what they did is, they played the race card. They're trying to inject Johnnie Cochran into this. They're trying to inject the Nation of Islam as some kind of a buzz word into this."   But the only buzz word, or "buzz inducer" anyone is focusing on at 11:30 am Friday morning is what the hell is the "intoxicating agent" that  Michael Jackson  used.  Multitudes  of purveyors of  hard beverages  are hoping against hope to profit from the Grand Prize in the " urlLink Ford Bronco " and "ugly ass urlLink Bruno Magli  Shoes" sweepstakes of  Product Placement in Celebrity Crime Award.   Better known as ' The Juicies ,' these awards are lucrative, but not as  prestigious  as, say, sitting next to  urlLink Dominick Dunne , enthralled, as he  gloms  celebrity off our latest bad-celebrity-cocktail-chatter episode, like an engorged wood tick feasting on an unfortunate  tabby cat .   Greeat . Has  Geraldo  got his Michael Jackson  urlLink theme song at the ready ? Such are the rituals of shadenfreude and democratic levelling in progress. Or maybe  The Corsair  is  playa hating  and  moralizing  with such  high falutin  terms because he isn't profiting from the  Bonfire of Vanities ? Don't even  entertain  the thought.  We report, you decide.   Update:  "MilkNCookies" writes, "In the words of  Maury (Pauvich),  Michael Jackson , "YOU ARE NOT THE FATHER!"    Update:  "NeedMoolah" writes, "Mike is a mess someone on another BB said they saw on the news that when Mike was being booked he said his eyes were chocolate:  " Officer : Eye Color?  Mike:  Chocolate  Officer:  Chocolate?   Mike:  yes, chocolate  Officer:  That's not a color  Mike:  I said Chocolate  Officer:  I'm putting down brown"

       Governor Rowland Implodes Under The Weight of His Own Hot Air    Shadenfreude  is a  bitch , let me tell you. And there is nothing worse that being  urlLink hoisted by ones own petard  in the media capitol of the world. I know this  instinctively , as an occasional practitioner of that spooky art in this city. Well, sport sounds less pretentious than art, so let's call it  that .   Never in my life have I seen a sitting politician receiving so many bitchslaps, in such rapid succession, within, ostensibly, a season of holiday warmth towards humankind, as are being issued to urlLink Governor Rowland of Connecticut .  Never  (affects "outraged" tone).   If this beating took place in the ring,  Judge Mills Lane  would throw in a skimpy white towel and send  urlLink Governor Rowie's black-and-blue broken body, spent from the bitchslaps, to the showers . Pronto! It's  over , Johnny.  It's over to everyone  but the Rowland's , which makes this  little political shadenfreude  particularly touching and cruel and fascinating in observation; it's like watching a couple of ants, slowly by slowly, reeling under the heat of a magnifying glass -- knowing what is going to happen next.    Equally  sizzling  a proposition, Connecticut's Governor, a thick-headed man, by  refusing  to just resign  that damn job  in the face of rising public anger, is not doing himself a service. This stubborn man is getting a long, protracted vivisection from  urlLink everyone in the media biz . A  serious  vivisection, my little pomegranates, to which his wife is, sadly, a party.  Connecticut  Governor John Rowland , and his wife, his "partner-in-crime"  , so to speak ,  Patricia , are  too good to be true  and too sad to be true,  simultaneously . There is a snarky  blogger heaven  where bloggers are 24/7 press access to the Rowland's, to trap the gaffes, like beetles in amber, ad infinitum; there is also a blogger  hell , where the conscience of the blogger creeps up and asks the man -- can't you just leave them  alone ?  I  can't.    First off , Governor  John Rowland  is ethically challenged. Now, I don't know whether this is because ethics are  invisible  little creatures (darn tham!), but even by the standards of politicians, Rowland is creepily  devoid  of ethics,  of an ethical universe , oh, why mince it: devoid of even a single negative imperative imprinted upon his psyche, those chestnuts that make us fit for civilization (puffs out chest, gets all "moralizing," while simultaneously projecting a jocular and macho sense of final judgement).   For example, today's  urlLink Times ties Rowland's "paving contractor"  to his controversial partnership in a private deveolpment group  (wink wink, he'll thake care of  that thing  for ya).  What's up with that ?   Since when do politicians engage in business ventures with ties to their precinct  while still in office  -- that's crazy talk: what was he doing, pulling a  Mariah ?    Rowland was absent with the sniffles  in "political corruption" class on the day  urlLink Ambassador Lauder  taught everyone to make your scrilla after you leave office and have cemented your contacts,  preferably in an emerging democracy, where the legal framework is dodgy at best .   And then there is that whole country house angle  with the Rowlands. Not that I am against summer houses, per se, if you go in for that sort of thing (averted gaze), even though the majority of Americans are  summer homeless , Governor ass. Summer house issues, air-conditioned dog houses thingies, (sigh) these issues just don't work out with the electorate, even in an electorate as wealthy as there are in Connecticut. Be afraid, Rowland, be  very very  afraid.  But of all the Christmastime fun surrounding this *dramedy* the Rowland's, produced, of course, by  Asaad Kelada , was yesterday's press conference, where husband and First Lady, like Bonnie and Clyde, took on the press -- big mistake, baby pop --  urlLink in poetry  -- a bigger fatter  Greek  mistake -- was a moment of great  hysterical , and historical significance.  And I do not mean to say that they  urlLink quoted   Edmund Spenser , or  Rilke  or even  Dr. Suess , people.  No , the Rowland's, well, Patricia, to be frank, with moral support from "her man," read a "witty" attack on the media in the form of  urlLink Twas the Night Before Christmas .  ( The Corsair  cringes at the thought)  The NY Times yesterday described the delivery as a "sing-song rebuke." It goes a little something like this:  "Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house, not a creature was stirring, except me, the first spouse.   "I was waiting for Santa, that jolly old elf, to give him the list I had drawn up myself.  "For I had hung all the garland and tinseled the trees and festooned the house for the public to see.  "I'd sent all the cards to our friends far and near, and thanked all our staff for their hard work this year.  "I'd shopped and I wrapped all my gifts full of love for our five picky teens, the black Lab and the guv.  "I kept quiet and calm through December's dark storm, protecting my family from those who wish harm.  (Corsair cringes again)  "So now it was my turn to get Santa's ear, to tell him what I wanted for Christmas this year.  "When out on my yard there arose such a hubbub, I thought maybe [Hartford Courant reporter] Jon Lender had jumped in the hot tub."  --You see where this is going? No? I must continue? Very well:  "Now surely that man needs to go soak his head, but there on the lawn stood Santa instead.  "'Come in, dear Santa, and rest for a while. I've got cookies and milk,' I said with a smile.  "'I am late,' said Santa. 'My last stop took hours, all that coal I delivered down The Courant's tall towers.  "'They used to be good girls and boys,' Santa said. 'But the poison pen's power has gone to their head.  "'And I have the same problem at the media stations; they've just simply forgotten good human relations.  "'Their thirst and hunger for the day's biggest story has earned them black coal for their ill-gotten glory.'  "'Oh Santa,' I said, 'that is sad, I agree. They've acted like Grinches who have stolen our tree.'  "'They whipped themselves into a mad feeding frenzy. They've embarrassed our children and our Mama McKenzie [Jo McKenzie, a longtime aide]."  Here is how  Alison Leigh Cowan  and  Marc Santora  of the Times described the event:  "After the poem's tone became clear and the audience gasped, she glanced at the governor to assess his reaction. 'Go for it, hon,' he said. 'What can they do to us?'  "'They can't make it worse,' she replied, and continued reading."  The media can;t make it worse, honey? I just did. And, as I write this, many media organizations in the tri state area are doing worse ...  much  worse. But enough, even I have had enough of this shadenfreude; it's just too sad. Resign, Governor Rowland,  resign .

       I Love Trio   Regular readers of this blog know that  The Corsair  loves  urlLink Trio Tv , the most revolutionary experiment in television is, well, in a good while. Trio is grown up  snark , an eclectic mixture of insider irony at the pop culture, along with a good measure of historically significant programming thrown in for good measure.   Both Trio and this  Corsair  blog are  young  and share a similar purpose of snark and the good stuff (okay, Corsair has officially lapsed into  delusions of grandeur ). This is one of the reasons why their  urlLink  influence on the Golden Globe nominations  is so  urlLink interesting .  Invirtually all of the accounts on the nominees, there is a  urlLink Trioesque skepticism  about the importance of the Golden Globe Awards. And that infusion of skepticism wasn't there before, thanks to  urlLink Trio's documentary ,  The Golden Globes: Hollywood's Dirty Little Secret .   urlLink Trio , like Bill  Murray , for lack of a better word, rocks.

       Older Women are the New Black   Or, More to the Point, Diane Keaton is the new Jill Claybergh   The  urlLink Jill Clayburgh Effect  is back in, well, effect. Older women are romping around the national landscape like college girls backstage at a Stones concert. But in the case of  Diane Keaton's    meteoric  rise to sex symbol from author of a book on bad Clown art is the most surprising.   She's got "it" says the  urlLink Sun Herald . She's portrayed as "passionate" and "desirable" says the  urlLink NY Times .  urlLink The Washington Post  goes so far as to call her a "babe."  And she is in a manner of speaking. Her rise comes at the tailend of a year where Tinseltown said: it's okay for older women to be considered sex symbols. Look at  Demi Moore  and  urlLink Ashton Kutcher , for one example, and even, the  not old   Cameron Diaz , 31, who is dating  Justin Timberlake , who is  urlLink 23 . Then, of course, there is the  urlLink 12 year age difference  between  50 Cent  and  Vivica Fox . Hey,  it's all good.   From  urlLink older women-younger men  it was a short hop skip and jump to  older woman as sex object , when you think about it.

       Hairspray Loans Presidential Campaign 850 K   This morning The Old Gray Lady reports that Presidential hopeful (don't you hate that word?) Democrat  Senator John Kerry  has loaned his embattled (don't you hate that word too?) campaign $850,000. Kerry is hoping to become the  urlLink ABD  (Anyone but Dean) candidate of the Democratic Party Establishment.  NY Times reporters  Katherine Q. Seelye  and  Robin Toner  write in  urlLink Some Democrats Uneasy About Dean as Nominee  today:  "'We don't want a wimp in this part of the country,' said Representative  Marcy Kaptur , Democrat of Ohio. 'Everything I've read that Dean has said about  Saddam  seems to be right on point. Our people have struggled to make a living and they want a fighter. They don't want some kind of Hollywood production with hair spray.'"  And speaking of politics and hair spray, the follicle- y  curious can read my interview with the Senator's hair  urlLink here .

Yesterday,  P Diddy's  entourage -- including the one jerk who elbowed  Joyce Wadler , the Boldface Columnist in the ribs -- made a "moat" around their master as he made a "personal cell phone call." Today, in  Page Six ,  Charlize Theron's   urlLink entourage got into trouble . The Sixers write:  "Theron was caught in the middle of an ugly brawl between Brazilian paparazzo  Laura Giannoni  and a mystery man in Theron's entourage at the  Viscaya  lounge after the 'Monster' screening nearby. "  And, to top things off, Theron's former  urlLink Italian Job  co-star, Marky Mark, is Executive producing an HBO flic called -- guess what?  urlLink Entourage . This is brave of Wahlberg, as it said that  his own   urlLink contretemps with a member of his entourage  involved Wahlberg, who compared his  urlLink Planet of the Apes  costar  Helena Bonham Carter  -- in monkey makep -- to  urlLink Janet Jackson  -- offering the black bodyguard a role in the film.   Anyhoo:  Entourages are the new black. There a must get, they show that people want to be around you, fodder over you, protect you. You don't have to say  it's all about me  when you have an entourage around you -- it is simply taken for granted. An entourage implies money -- how else would one be able to keep  beefy bodyguards  in the Cristal and swordfish, clothe, bejewel and perfume a handful of models, pay the cellphone bills of a gaggle of publicists and "guys from around the way"?   The ultimate in entourage chic, again demonstrated by Theron, is the fact that one's entourage grows,  evolves , as the night progresses, into an unwieldy mass. You meet people right?  People change , as "social philosopher"  urlLink Ritchie Rich  once said, so  why can't one's entourage reflect the social evolution that a hipster makes during the course of one evening?  Theron, that hipster, probably doesn't even know who was in the entourage that evening, the  urlLink Page Sixers  continue:  "Giannoni filed a police report at the 13th Precinct. 'They took pictures of my face, but I can't press charges against the guy because I don't know who he is . . . I am distressed, depressed and tired.'"   Forget the me generation , my little pomegranates,  where's the cachet  in that? It's the entourage generation, baby, who loves you? (Points to entourage)  they  do.

       Joyce Wadler Gets Elbowed In The Breadbasket!   Imagine our surprise when we read in the Metro section of the  New York Times  that their  Boldface Names  Columnist  urlLink Joyce Wadler took an elbow to the ribs  as a parting gift from  P Diddy's  bodyguards!  Ooof!   Or at least this is what hapless readers ( Corsair  included) were led to believe. Let's run through the evidence like Diddy in the city:  The column begins with Tuesday's opening of the  Marquee , the 'ultralounge.' Wadler runs into  Fisher Stevens , AKA the ex-Mr.  urlLink Michelle Pfeifer , who says he is "shy." His best bud  Matt Dillon , rides shotgun and is, as usual,   urlLink negotiating with a beautiful blonde , unable to close the deal. So far so good, everything is as it has been since the beginning of time; Joyce is okay.  Then she meets  Chelsea Clinton  and  Ian Klaus . They cannot do an interview but are polite about it, all told. So far, so good.   Then ( urlLink El Greco lighting , dramatic  urlLink Buxthehude organ music ) things go wrong .. horribly wrong:  P Diddy  is in the building. Joyce writes:  "Mr. Diddy did not converse. He stopped just long enough to do the ritual 'what's up?' handshake to the chosen few: open-thumb grip, slight bow of the head, grave expression.  "Then Mr. Diddy and the guard recreated into the chilly entrance hall where Mr. Diddy's men formed a moat around him while he made 'a private cellphone call.'  "'You can have two questions,' Mr. Diddy told us, after he had hung up.  "Weasked him to describe for us his perfect environment."  "'I'm not answering that,' he said, waving us off."  "A little later, when Mr. Diddy was leaning on the DJ booth where Q-Tip was spinning, we asked one of the bodyguards who was standing in front of him if we could ask another question.  "'He doesn't want to talk to you, he already told you that,' the guard said. Then he elbowed us in the ribs,  ultrahard ."  Say  what ?!  I am not kidding, this is the verbatim report from  Joyce Wadler . Is she  okay ? Is this a joke of some kind? Should I arrange a convocation of bloggers to address the issue? Are we to inquire as to the state of her health?  I really hope that those bodyguards did not lay a hand on our collegue  Wadler .  'Cause we're drinking milk !

       Will Someone Give Bill Murray An Oscar Already?   The following article is reposted from November 13th. If you have already read it, sorry, please scroll down. I felt the need to redo it because his  urlLink Golden Globe nomination  inches him thismuchcloser to  urlLink the Big O :   urlLink Oscar  is fickle about comedians. Oscar eludes those who seek him by inducing soft chuckles. That having been said, will someone give the Oscar to  Bill Murray  already?  urlLink His performance  in  Sofia Coppola's     urlLink Lost In Translation  was brilliantly subtle and nuanced. In fact, it was all nuance: an  anti-performance .  Imagine a Best Oscar going to an underplayed performance.  Denzel Washington's  dirty cop was the most powerful and  full-on  performance in recent years.  Adrien Brody  was a surprise, but in a sense it was the most fully articulated performance among the nominees last year. It would be  wonderful  to have Bill Murray's declining Hollywood actor in a foreign land  urlLink shilling whiskey  to win it this time around.   Murray has been snubbed by Oscar. He has never been nominated and that is a crime. Murray was endearing and complex in  urlLink Rushmore , but again that was a comedy, so he was hurt at the outset. Murray was a rich personality in  urlLink The Razor's Edge . And Murray was overlooked as the dry, intellectually clueless psychiatrist in  urlLink The Mighty Tennenbaum's , another comedy, so Oscar ignored.   My favorite Bill Murray flic is  urlLink Meatballs , which is also the first film I ever saw so there is nothing intellectual about my love of it. To me, Bill Murray is the coolest man on the planet earth.  So give him an Oscar already.

       Paris Hilton: Homewrecker!    urlLink The National Enquirer  reports that  Paris Hilton , while taping her reality show  The Simple Life , wrecked the relationship of two high school sweethearts in  Altus, AK , and then  got the hell out of town quicker than a wayward preacher faced with a shotgun wedding !    Caroline Cains  --the earth angel-- told the  Enquirer :  "Thanks to Paris, the future  Trae  (Lindley) and I were building was ripped apart within a matter of days ... As lovers, Trae and I are back to square one."    Caroline Cains  and  Trey Lindley  were  Mr. and Miss Ozark High  in the 2003 yearbooks, but apparently, Trey thought being Paris'  Arkansas fling  was a more  prestigious  title. Or, at least  cooler  for a high school kid when in the locker room with the guys. Men.  Trae spoke out in the same interview:  "There's a chance Caroline and I can mend our relationship, but it's going to take a lot of work. Caroline just doesn't trust me anymore."    Noo : really? Ah, young naive love. Why can't the  Real World  be as exciting as this? Come to think of it, when was the last time that TRW was even exciting?  A source told  urlLink The Enquirer :  "(Paris) admitted to at least one person in Altus that 'The Simple Life' producers encouraged her to find a romantic counterpart because they thought it would make for 'good TV.'   "It wasn't very difficult for her to find a fall guy, because Paris was the first celebrity most of the townspeople had ever met. And she used that star power to cast a spell on Trae."  The story goes on ( Corsair  munches popcorn distractedly, leans in to computer screen) ...:  "'Paris met Trae at the Altus bait shop where she and Nicole were working, and Trae was smitten.   "'Then Paris ran into him a few nights later when she and Nicole were carousing, hanging out with some neighborhood kids at a local gas station.   "'Trae is a handsome guy, so when Paris saw him again she made it pretty clear she wanted to hook up. And as the evening progressed, she continued to pursue him.   "'As soon as Paris learned about Caroline through one of Trae's friends, she giggled and said,  He has a fiancee? Well, we'll see about that!    "'She started rubbing against Trae, batting her baby blues, and flipping her hair.   "'By the end of the evening, Trae had forgotten all about his fiancee and had become Paris' toyboy Ã¢â‚¬â€? whatever Paris wanted to do with him, he was game. It was really sad to watch Paris take a couple who were so madly in love and destroy them without a care in the world."   Bait shop. Gas station. Leg rubbing. Hooking up. This story has it all: the heartland, an uptown girl, reality tv, and romantic betrayal (Corsair claps). You've got to  urlLink read it to believe it . Oh good job, guys; inquiring minds are satisfied.   Now, if only we could fit a  Golum  into the story.

       Mary Pinkett, RIP    urlLink Mary Pinkett , the first black woman elected to the City Council, died on December 4th. That reminds me of a  political me  I had almost forgotten, buried under the snarky writer me, and, of course, a woman I will  urlLink always miss .  In the winter of 1989, at the age of 17, I interned at Councilwoman  urlLink Mary Pinkett's  office in the 35th District of Brooklyn. This was before going off to college in  Vermont  and falling in love with the idea of writing for a living. Her office a small but warm affair in Fort Greene, above a pizza place(which made it hard to work as lunchtime approached). Thge office was presided over by her loyal aide,  Mary King , while the Councilwoman was at City Hall, fighting the good fight. There I learned some of the most important lessons in my life, lessons that go beyond politics.  On my first day I remember that I wore my father's  Saville Row  suit, which was a good thing, as any man who has ever worked for Mary will tell you. Councilwoman Pinkett loved to have the men around her well-dressed. Within ten minutes of knowing her, my suit recommended itself well enough that she decided to take me on a campaign pit stop. As we jumped into her town car, she began to  pry  me for  personal information , lingering on the fact that I was born in Africa. But what was up?  And so, there I was, about twenty minutes into my new job, at a Senior Center in  Fort Greene , Brooklyn listening to Councilwoman Pinkett campaign. At the end of her speech, the Councilwoman told the elderly African American audience that a "young, African legislative aide" was in the audience, and that a "vote for her was a vote to bring young bright voices onto the New York scene."  And so I received my first lesson in politics. As I spent the next half an hour talking about Africa to the clearly interested seniors, most of whom fought the Civil Rights struggles in the 60s but had never been to the Dark Continent, my initial shock lessened. Politics was about using the materials at hand to ones advantage; you had to be on your toes to be in the presence of Mary Pinkett. Was everyone in politics like this? How  naive  I was even for 17!  Several months later Councilwoman Pinkett invited me to the annual  St. Patrick's Day  celebration at  City Hall . I wore something green -- a tie, I think, purely by chance, but I believe to this day that that got me the invite from the Councilwoman. So there I was, a black 17 year old, at the Councilwoman's side, at City Hall with Ed Koch, the New York press and other Irish American dignitaries. Suddenly I feel all the attention in the room focus in on me.  urlLink The Lord Mayor of Dublin , Ireland, either interested in my tie or in the fact that I was the only young black man in the room, was standing next to me and the councilwoman, solicitous. And just like that,  voila : flashbulbs started clicking.  I imply here that the  urlLink Lord Mayor's  motives were political because he seemed more interested in my tie and how I liked the Irish coffee -- me, a 17 year old kid -- than talking to the Councilwoman, at my side, smiling into the cameras, unconcerned.  How does on talk and act when the cameras are chasing you? The Councilwoman did well, and, in the process, promoted legislation for the city to stop doing business with Myanmar (Burma),Chaired the Civil Service and Labor Committees, and promoted legislation to protect whistleblowers and the elderly on the Commission for the Aged.  Those were the days of giants.  Ed Koch's  administration was coming undone, crumbling really, after years in power from within by corruption charges. The way was being set for  David Dinkin s, who would eventually become the City's first African-American mayor, a one termer.  Liz Holtzman , now a name largely forgotten, was battling to increase her budget before the now defunct  Board of Elections , while I took voluminous notes in my High school notebook, for the Councilwoman. The incredibly ambitious  Susan Molinari , was young, the only Republican in the Council, she was on the fasttrack to her father's Congressional seat, and a hot career in Congress before leaving to start a family and anchor an ill-fated CBS news show for children. Looking back at the drama of New York City politics, I cannot believe that I almost forgot those days altogether. But even among giants, Mary Pinkett stood tall.   Mary Pinkett , the first black woman elected to the City Council, died November 4th at New York-Presbyterian Hospital Columbia Medical Center. She was 72. May she rest in peace.

       Whatever Happened To Tommy Mottola?

Imagine my surprise!  Not one to engage in  shadenfreude ,  The Corsair  avoided eye contact so as not to make Tommy feel as uncomfortable as  urlLink Courtney Love  at an AA Meeting, I just handed him the money and he gave me the change and I left the joint thinking: Fame ...  aint it a bitch ?

       McGruder Gets Booed At The Nation   Believe it or not, my little pomegranates,  The Corsair  once worked as an intern at  urlLink The Nation  on a weekly stipend provided by none other than  Barbara Streisand . Trust me, though, there is  nothing glamourous  about the long hours, intense factchecking under strict deadlines and that tiny "Babs" stipend, although there  was  that unforgettable boozy lunch with  Christopher Hitchens , where roughly twice as much was spent on drinks than on food, in which  The Corsair  stumbled through the streets of NY, weaving in and out of traffic, barely escaping the clutches of death in the form of a delivery truck several times in the process of getting home. Ah,  The Nation : the memories! The hangovers!  So I wasn't surprised to hear that  mildly  funny cartoonist  Aaron McGruder , writer for  urlLink "The Boondocks"  was booed at the 138th anniversary Nation dinner attended by  Uma Thurman  and  John Waters , among others. The Nation magazine projects high seriousness into the sphere of politics, but the atmosphere within is playful and as light as Publisher  Victor Navasky's  love of boxing.   urlLink McGruder  is a hostile, but  urlLink hostility is not a crime , although it is a  social misdemeanor  in the world of  cartoons . Chances are that when one's  eyeballs  come to rest on the  comic  section of the paper,   said person is probably looking for a laugh , and not an attack on National Security Advisor  urlLink Condi Rice's sexuality . Just a thought.  And one more thing: if you are getting booed at left institutions like  The Nation  and attacked by the right at  urlLink Free Republic ... uhm,  that's not good .  Unless, of course, he wants to be hated by all sides ... which, uhm, is not good.   So:  Along with the robust multivitamin for  Time Magazine's   Joel Stein ,  The Corsair  offers  McGruder  some  urlLink Prozac.

       McSweeney's Open Letters   Although  The Corsair  lives in the right part of Brooklyn, he isn't allowed to play reindeer games with those hip folks at  urlLink McSweeney's .  Yet . But I'm drinking milk ...   Anyway : The McSweeneyites have a new feature in which they allow people to write open letters to "people or entities who are unlikely to respond."  Mine  would begin something along the lines of:  "Dear  Naomi Campbell :  "Although  urlLink I am not a dangerous multimillionaire Chechnyan rebel , I harbor terrorist longings in my heart, for  I believe that you are tha bomb!  "  Something along those lines. The McSweeneyites put more thought into it, though, as  Anna McKerrow  of the UK shows us in her open letter to Yuppie Mummies (Yummies), which begins:  "Dear Yummies,   Upon the groves and the park walks of the city, the greener pastures, you trundle lightly with your streamlined and turbocharged buggies. You talk languorously on your video-mobiles to other yuppie mummies, clad exclusively in  Dolce & Gabbana  loungewear. You do not have infant-sick on your jeans or bags under your eyes. You are pristinely gorgeous and rich.   "Yuppie mummies, you drive your small, precocious offspring to  Montessori  schools in  Land Rovers  totally inappropriate for London roads before heading off to the gym for a few light stretches. You have a health-conscious overpriced lunch in a designer café. You arrive home just in time to berate the housekeeper for misdemeanours real or imagined.   "I wish I had your lifestyle, Yummies, but I think I would still feel the emptiness. With the necessity to work removed, does the light shine harder through the mesh of your everyday existence? Is it harder to fill the days? Your children are the joy of your life, but is their presence at a removed distance dimmer, more hazy, as satellites to the (regained) body beautiful?"  You get the picture.  The Corsair  especially likes the open letters to  urlLink centripetal force ,  urlLink alcohol  and  urlLink Louis XIV .

       Diary of a Mad Senior    Stuyvesant High School  is a school for highly intelligent public school students in New York City. Their online newspaper is  The Spectator , and it contains a sort of teen rant column -- kind of like a blog, but with better grammar -- called  urlLink Diary of A Mad Senior . It's better than  the OC , people;  it's on like Grey Poupon !  It's a  hoot .  Do you remember high school? The angst, the cosmic sense of self importance, the bad poetry, the unrequieted love --  what ? You  don't ?  That's just me , you say? What ever .   Anyhoo : The Mad Senior in question, one  Shannon Blaney -- probably a fine young woman with a bright future -- gives us a dose of High School when she writes:  "So you can imagine how happy I was to have a best friend who reciprocated my feelings. Then in sophomore year, a minor tragedy took place. My best friend moved at the very end of the year—all the way to Mexico City. I was devastated and felt quite selfish. What, I wondered, would I do next year? Who will be my friend?"  A group hug for everyone who went through High School angst. We've come a  long  way, baby.

       Governor Pataki Knows Way too much about LOTR   Everyman New York Governor  George Pataki , Our Hungarian hero, Our fearless leader ... knows more about  Lord of the Rings  than I am comfortable with as his constituent.  Way  more. How much more? Let the Governor tell us in his own words:  who do you love ?  "The one I love is  Samwise Gamgee  [played by  Sean Astin ]," Pataki told  urlLink Rush and Molloy . "Gamgee's the understated guy, the gardener that nobody ever expects to amount to anything, who every step of the way provides the moral courage and strength that allows Frodo's mission to be successful. He's a great figure in literature."  ( The Corsair  whistles to try to cover up the uncomfortable silence. Then he shuffles pebbles with his feet. That doesn't work either. Then he just moves on to another blog without further comment.)

       Bruce Wasserman To Wed New York Magazine   The New York Times is reporting that  Bruce Wasserman  is  urlLink set to marry the beautiful but financially distressed New York Magazine .   The "wedding" would cost the veteran Wall Street financier $55 million, for the rare honor and privilege of earning a profit of between $1 and $2 million on revenues of $40 million.   Say  what ?!  New York is a vanity publication,  urlLink a trophy wife, to be sure . She looks pretty and makes you, by intimate connection, look swell too. Plus she gets you in circulation with the right types of people. La donna e mobile.   urlLink Wasserman  is moving up in the world. He founded, then sold  Wasserstein Perella , an investment bank, and is currently chairman of  Lazard Freres .  Wasserman has dated less prestigious trophy publications such as  American Lawyer  and  the Deal , but his coming nuptuals to New York ensure a proper place in New York Media Society.

       Playahating: Joel Stein   We are going to try to hold back that  urlLink green eyed monster , but it won't be easy.  Joel Stein  ... grrr ... the mildly witty  Time Magazine  humorist ... grrr ... who is in need of a robust multivitamin (oh, that felt  so  much better) scored a sitcom pilot deal with  Warner Brothers . (Corsair passes out from playa hating)  At some point tonight,  The Corsair  will have too many  Cutty Sarks  and yell at anyone within listening range that it is  he  who should have landed the sitcom deal.   Deborah Schoeneman  writes in  urlLink New York Magazine's Intelligencer :   "Time humorist Joel Stein did go to Burning Man with (Walter)  Isaacson , and we only mildly hate him for it ... Warner Bros. Television recently purchased a sitcom pilot from Stein, about 'a young guy without much journalism experience who gets hired by a really serious newsmagazine' (who could that possibly be?), and sold it to ABC."

       Happy At Last? Mary J Blige Gets Married   Melancholy R & B crooner  Mary J Blige   urlLink jumped the proverbial broom  at her home in Bergen County, N.J. Dec. 7, with non A-list guests in attendance. What can we say:  Mary likes to keep it real.   And we like Mary.  Of course, it is impossible to gloss over the existential side to Blige.  urlLink BET writes :  "Years ago, when Mary J sang 'all I really want is to be happy' and pleaded for 'no more drama,' women everywhere sang and cried along with her. We could relate to the desire to free ourselves of the baggage we lug through life."  There is something  Paris in Autumn  about  Mary J Blige's   music and drowsy-eyed world weary persona. And who can forget the time  urlLink she almost punched supermodel   Veronica Webb  out during an interview for  Interview Magazine  after Webb--  Spike Lee's  former mistress -- continued to ask her insulting questions about allegedly taking etiquitte lessons to offset her ghetto mannerisms.   The Corsair  wishes congratulations and hopes that this is the beginning of happier times for Blige, who deserves a few smiles.

       What Altus, AK Thinks of Paris and Nicole   The intrepid crowd at the  urlLink Star went back to Altus, Arkansas  to find out what the town thought about  Paris Hilton  and  Nicole Ritchie .   "Paris and Nicole worked for me for one day. After that they'd visit every night to meet guys. They were sweet and kind -- but a little dingy," said  Bill "Buffalo" Leding .  Local Dairy famer  Danny Council  had a different take. "I told them they should get a card that reads 'hired to be fired,' he told the Star.' I couldn't get them to get up and do anything after one hour's work. Out of the two girls -- if you had to make one your daughter -- it would be Nicole. She has a heart. But Paris just thinks the world revolves around her.'"   Noooooooo ..... you don't say?

       LOTR: The Unbearable Whiteness of Being Frodo   Can we get a  Cablasian  Wizard, please? Are there any Eskimo orcs in central casting,  come on work with me people !   The Corsair  is tired of all the hyperbole launched in the direction of  LOTR .  Really  tired. The whole LOTR madness came along at a time when, after 9-11, the world wanted a clear cut battle between good and evil a la  Harry Potter  and  Star Wars . Fine: I can understand the cathartic need for moral clarity.  And not to make it into a  race  thing (hunker down,  my little pomegranates , you can see where I'm going with this, can't you?), but couldn't you have, like on  latino  elf? Or a  black  hobbit? Would that  interfere  with the  integrity  of the film? This has got to be the whitest trilogy in the history of film.  What's up with that ?  I mean, this is middle earth we are talking about here, not Woody Allen's Upper East Side. And on earth there are many races.  Okay, that's the end of my race rant.   MSNBC's   Larry Terenzi  offers the  urlLink only negative review  of LOTR you are likely to read other than my self serving race rant..  Update: " Lloyd Dobler " writes: "Gollum is a straight up brotha! Albeit a weird one."

       Ingmar and Ingrid's Movie Magic   "The idea of working with  Ingrid Bergman  was an old desire, but that did not initiate the story. The last time I had seen her was at the  Cannes Film Festival  at the screening of  Cries and Whispers  (ed note: 1974). She had snuck a letter into my pocket, in which she reminded me of my promise that would make a film together. Once long ago we had planned to adapt   Hjalmar Bergman's  novel  The Boss, Mrs. Ingeborg  to film.  "...I wrote the screenplay for  Autumn Sonata  in a few weeks in order to have something up my sleeve in case  The Serpent's Egg  flopped with a somersault. My decision was final: I would never again work in Sweden.  "That is the reason I made the strange decision to shoot Autumn Sonanta in Norway. As it turned out, I felt perfectly content to work in the primitive studios on the outskirts of Oslo. Built in 1913 or 1914, the buildings have been  left just as they were. Of course, when the wind blew in certain directions, the air traffic passed right overhead, but otherwise it was old fashioned and cozy. Everything we needed was available there, even though the space was dilapidated and had not been kept up. The crew members were friendly but a bit amateurish.  "The actual filming was draining. I did not have what one would call difficulties in my working relationship with Ingrid Bergman. Rather, it was a kind of language barrier, but in a profound sense. Starting on the first day when we all read the script together in the rehearsal studio, I discovered that she had rehearsed her entire part in front of the mirror, complete with intonations and self-conscious gestures. It was clear that she had a different approach to her profession than the rest of us. She was still living in the 1940s.  "I believe that she possessed some sort of inspired system of working, albeit a strange one. In spite of her mechanisms for receiving director's cues not being placed where one expected to find them -- and where they ought to be -- she still must have been somehow receptive to suggestions from two or three of her former directors. After all, she had done excellent work in several American films.  "In  Hitchcock's  films, for instance, she is always magnificent. She detested the man. I believe that with her he never hesitated to be disrespectful and arrogant, which evidently was precisely the best method to make her listen.  "I discovered early into our rehearsals that to be understanding and to offer a sympathetic ear did not work. In her case I was forced to use tactics that I normally rejected, the first and foremost being aggression.  "Once she told me: 'If you don't tell me how I should do this scene, I'll slap you.' I rather liked that."  From  Images: My Life in Film , by  Ingmar Bergman .

       The Breakfast Club   Saturday, March 24, 1984 Shermer High School, Shermer, Il  Dear  Mr. Vernon , We accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong -- and what we did was wrong -- but we think you're crazy to make us write an essay telling you who we think we are. What do you care? You see us as you want to see us: in the simplest terms and the most convenient definitions. You see us as a  brain ,  an athelete ,  a basketcase ,  a princess  and  a criminal . Correct? That's the way we saw each other at 7 o'clock this morning.   "We were brainwashed."

       Lauryn Hill Attacks Vatican   Delectable former  urlLink Fugee   Lauryn Hill , the  urlLink demure little songbird  that inspired a million crushes (The Corsair scribler's heart included),  made a  somewhat  strange, but not totally off-the-mark criticism of Vatican child sex abuse policy at a benefit for that organization where  she herself  was  urlLink scheduled to perform .   A few Italian newspapers yesterday ran translations of Hill's English statement. She is quoted as saying there is "no acceptable explanation for defending the church."   "I realize some of you may be offended by what I'm saying, but what do you say to the families who were betrayed by the people in whom they believed?"  La Republica  newspaper, quoted Hill.   Those quotes would not sound so odd if  urlLink the fog  surrounding  urlLink Lauryn Hill's own strange religion  weren't so thick. Thicker than a Haitian  Lambi en Sauce , toujours la?    Towering  cumulous clouds surround the petite former Fugee in the form of her very own religious guru,  urlLink Brother Anthony , who is regarded by many in the music press and  urlLink hip hop community as a dangerous svengali  who has salted the songbirds tail.  The Corsair  tends to have a problem with religious gurus named "Brother Anthony" that keep their charges in isolation ... it just doesn't sound  kosher ; it sounds  voodoo . It also sounds a bit  pimpy  as Lauryn has several dozen million dollars.  Lauryn's got a cult-like attatchment to Brother Anthony that kind of reminds me of  Tootie Ramsey's  intense passion for  Jermaine Jackson  in the "very special"  Facts of Life  episode Star Struck, where Edna Garrett gave  urlLink an incoherent speech about how girls go crazy over musicians . I never did get the meaning of that episode ...   Anyhoo : about Brother Anthony:  "I don't speak about him publicly," Hill told  MTV Online , "because he is a good friend of mine. He's not an ambitious person. He just shares, and people want truth. I believe God will make a way and he is going to identify [the man] ... I saw somebody living what he was saying. It wasn't a bunch of jargon. His life was a living testimony of faith and of passion and systematic rebellion ..."   In  Toure's  infamous -- smouldering, really --2003  Rolling Stone  expose of Hill, he wrote:  "In 2000, Hill became close with  Brother Anthony , a shadowy spiritual adviser, then abruptly fired her management team and the people around her. In 2001, she recorded her  MTV Unplugged  2.0. Few bought the album, but many talked about how she could be heard on the record breaking down in tears and saying, 'I'm crazy and deranged. . . . I'm emotionally unstable,' and repeatedly rejecting celebrity and the illusions that make it possible. 'I used to get dressed for y'all; I don't do that anymore,' she said on the album. 'I used to be a performer, and I really don't consider myself a performer anymore. . . . I had created this public persona, this public illusion, and it held me hostage. I couldn't be a real person, because you're too afraid of what your public will say. At that point, I had to do some dying.'"  It continues (Corsair is munching on pocorn, eyes stuck on the screen):  "'Brother Anthony was definitely on some other shit,'  Pras  says. 'I had a tape of [his teachings]. That shit is ill. Fucked me up. I can't really explain it. It was some weird shit, man. It was some real cult shit. When I heard the tape, I couldn't believe that this dude was really serious. He was sayin', 'Give up all your money.' I don't know if that meant 'Give it to me' or whatever, but on the tape he said, 'Money doesn't mean anything.' "    Seth Fenn  has  urlLink responded to the RS article . Ms. Hill’s production coordinator, Fenn's job, "which included everything from organizing auditions, handling logistics, and managing studio inventory. I also helped her design her own personal studio and occasionally would even watch her kids."   On  Brother Anthony , Fenn writes: "A lot was made of the Brother Anthony bible studies and the brainwashing effect on Ms. Hill. Aside from the inaccuracy of the suggested 3-times-a-week lessons (it was my job to drive Brother Anthony from the airport and I did this once a week), we’re talking bible study here! That’s it! Since when is it a bad thing, or a crazy thing to want to explore the teachings of God?! Ms. Hill is her own woman and does what she wants to do. She was not brainwashed into anything!"  Okay,  fellow Raelian!   But seriously, its not the once a week bible sessions that bother  The Corsair  so much,  it's that whole  MTV Unplugged 2.0 album with "only three chords being played on every song;"  it's that whole  breaking off from old friends;  it's that whole  Columbia has cut off her recording budget;  it's that whole  "quoting Scripture, fanatically religious" --   knowwhatImean?   Please come back to earth Laurence Hill (oh, that  Sir Paul McCartney , what a pip!),  we miss you.

       Eminem Rescues Suicidal Ex-Wifey   Significant cultural artifact  urlLink Star Magazine  reports that Eminem "rescued" his troubled (read: insane in the membrane) ex-wife and lyrical muse  Kim Mathers .  Livin la Vida Loca  with America's favorite "dramedy"  The Mathers Family.  (produced by  Assad Kelada , of course, laugh track optional)   Let me try and untangle this twistedness for you, my little pomegranates.  In the pilot episode, follow me as  Kim Mathers  disappears for two weeks in November, missing court appearances for drug charges in Michigan.   But Kimmy not only vanishes without a trace, she cuts off the  ankle tether  issued under court-ordered house arrest ( The Corsair  rolls his eyes and says nothing).  Oh no, she didn't!  (roll laugh track) What will that  wacky  chick do next?  Star reporter  Bob Hartlein  reports in the latest issue that Eminem's uncle,  Todd Nelson , told him, "I heard she had planned to kill herself down in Cancun, a place she's always loved, and where she wanted to die."   Thanks for sharing , Uncle Todd.   Nelson , the source for the story, told Star, "Eminem persuaded Kim to turn herself in and posted her $50,000 bail. He also claims Kim is upset about having to receive in-house drug treatment in January, noting, 'She's threatening suicide again.'"  Nothing says loving like a court-ordered ankle tether ...  A family under house arrest stays together ...  Uncles who tell family tales to tabloids ...  Well,  you get the idea.

       Strom Thurmond's Jungle Fever!    He Says She's Just a Friend   "She cant love me, I cant love her Cause they say were the wrong color Staring, gloating, laughing, looking Like weve done something wrong Because we show love strong, get real, come on Calling us names too bad to mention But we pay them no attention For color blind are inner feelings"    Stevie Wonder ,  Jungle Fever    Former "States Rights" Democratic Presidential candidate, whose current gig involves fertilizing magnolias,  urlLink -- none oter than: Strom Thurmond  schools us on racial issues  from beyond the grave .   It appears that  Strom Thurmond  had jungle fever and couldn't keep his hands off his 16 year old maid, resulting in the illegitimate birth of  Essie Mae Washington-Williams , in 1925!  Who was it that said, the darker the berry the sweeter the juice: was it  La Rouchefoucauld ?  Carrot Top ?  Galileo?  No matter.   Marcus Warren  of The Telegraph reports that:   "In public the senator, who stepped down as a South Carolina senator only a year ago, acknowledged Mrs Washington-Williams as ' a friend '(ed note: italics mine). Privately he admitted that she was his daughter with a black housemaid and helped her financially, (Williams) said."  An originator of the 1956 " urlLink Southern Manifesto ," which was proffered up when his own mixed-race daughter was 26, Thurmond, as  urlLink his biography at Clemson  states, "holds the record for the longest filibuster in Senate history; he spoke against the 1957 civil rights bill for twenty-four hours, eighteen minutes."   Granted, Strom later reversed himself on his own hypocrisy, hiring conservative  urlLink Armstrong Wiiliams , among other African American hires, as a  urlLink staff aide .  Also, granted, is the fact that he repudiated his past before he went completely senile,  ironically  leaving his staff -- with many African Americans -- to run daily affairs in the Senator's office, like a ramshackle Southern plantation where the eccentric slave owner is, essentially, owned by his "slaves."   But Good Old Strom, may he rest in peace, is in a strong tradition of Southern hypocrite racists, who believe that African Americans -- or did believe -- are backwards people, yet warm blooded enough to heat up the sheets.   Thomas Jefferson  serves as the greatest example of this hypocrisy. Our founding Father, in  urlLink Notes on the State of Virginia , Chapt. 14, writes:  "A black, after hard labour through the day, will be induced by the slightest amusements to sit up till midnight, or later, though knowing he must be out with the first dawn of the morning.  They are at least as brave, and more adventuresome.  But this may perhaps proceed from a want of forethought, which prevents their seeing a danger till it be present.  When present, they do not go through it with more coolness or steadiness than the whites.  They are more ardent after their female: but love seems with them to be more an eager desire, than a tender delicate mixture of sentiment and sensation.  Their griefs are transient.  Those numberless afflictions, which render it doubtful whether heaven has given life to us in mercy or in wrath, are less felt, and sooner forgotten with them.  In general, their existence appears to participate more of sensation than reflection.  To this must be ascribed their disposition to sleep when abstracted from their diversions, and unemployed in labour.  An animal whose body is at rest, and who does not reflect, must be disposed to sleep of course.  Comparing them by their faculties of memory, reason, and imagination, it appears to me, that in memory they are equal to the whites; in reason much inferior, as I think (ed note: italics mine)  one could scarcely be found capable of tracing and comprehending the investigations of Euclid ; and that in imagination they are dull, tasteless, and anomalous.  It would be unfair to follow them to Africa for this investigation.  We will consider them here, on the same stage with the whites, and where the facts are not apocryphal on which a judgment is to be formed."  Of course none of that stopped  urlLink Tommy from getting busy with Sally Hemmings , who was the  half sister  of Thomas Jeffersons wife, Martha Jefferson, as a result of some more  eighteenth century Southern interracial action .   So, in the end, Strom really  was  a  urlLink Traditionalist .  BTW, TJ: The Corsair got an A in his college tutorial on  Euclid's   Elements , and, years later, can still appreciate  urlLink the beauty of his Golden Mean Ratio .

       Is Tim Russert a Saint?   Meet the Press' perky  Buffalo Bills  loving host   Tim Russert   urlLink had a dream-vision that Sadaam Hussein was captured the night before the bedraggled dictator was lured out of his spider hole by US forces .    Peter Johnson  of  USA TODAY  writes:  "At a party Saturday night in Washington,  NBC Meet the Press  host  Tim Russert   bumped into an unusually upbeat (ed note:  urlLink CIA Director )  George Tenet .  "He told the CIA director that he had dreamt that Saddam Hussein had been captured.  "'Have a nice holiday,' Tenet said, knowing then what the country would learn in nine hours: The Iraqi dictator had been caught.  "On NBC's Today Sunday morning, anchor  Tom Brokaw  put Russert's dream in perspective, quipping that Russert, a Buffalo Bills fan, had often dreamt about the Bills winning the Super Bowl."  Okay,  Crossing Over with John Edwards !   urlLink The Roman Catholic  "canonized" dean of Washington journalism is highly regarded by the press corps:  but could Tim Russert have the right stuff to become one of "the blessed" ?  St. Tim ... we like it.   But the path to canonization and sainthood is  urlLink heady stuff.    Tracy Wilkinson  writes on canonization in the  Fort Wayne Journal-Gazette :  "To be considered (for sainthood), candidates for beatification and sainthood - they are known as Servants of God - must have a widespread reputation for holiness that grows and deepens after their death."   Check!  While St. Tim is still very much alive and, may we say, live ly ,  he has a strong reputation, why, just look at what  urlLink his Washington Speakers page says of him :  "With a reputation for hard-hitting journalism that cuts through the spin and uncovers the truth, Tim Russert is one of the most influential journalists working in Washington today. As NBC’s senior vice president and Washington bureau chief, he has helped shape the way today’s news is reported and analyzed. As producer and moderator of Meet The Press, he heads one of the most popular and most often quoted news programs on the air. As political analyst for Today and anchor of CNBC’s The Tim Russert Show, he has brought his insight and intelligence to a global audience. With quick wit and warm humor, Russert sheds an irreverent light on the Washington scene, even as he unravels its most intricate complexities."  The second part of sainthood is where we hit a snag, though. Wilkinson writes:  "And they must be known to have intercessionary powers. That means a believer can pray to the candidate requesting intercession with God to grant a favor, which in virtually every case is the cure of a serious medical problem."  Hmmm,  urlLink Running back Travis Henry  has been performing with a fracture in his lower right fibula,  just above the ankle .  Perhaps we should all pray to St. Tim for a healing, and help his efforts to achieve the status we all believe he deserves, as Patron Saint of hard hitting Washington journalism.   Amen.

       John Edwards: Tough Luck   It must be hard being  urlLink John Edwards  -- no, not the  urlLink psychic , the junior Senator from North Carolina and erstwhile Presidential candidate. Although the former trial lawyer is not engaged in the paranormal, it almost seems as if some  cosmic force  is working against his run. Remember when  urlLink Wesley Clark's Presidential announcement overshadowed his ? What are the odds on that?  Then, as if that wasn't a strange enough occurrence, Edwards was all set Sunday to get the biggest media push on his lagging run by doing an interview segment on  60 Minutes  this past Sunday.  What happened ? You guessed it:  Sadaam Hussein was captured , forcing CBS to  urlLink reschedule the story for a later date .   Ouch:  the stars appear to be against Ashton Kutcher's man for 2004 .

       The Corsair's Remote Control Tour Diary   There are over  500  cable channels nowadays, so who better to give you a tour of some of the major ones?    Anyhoo:  500 channels means "niche marketing." And with all those niches, things can get confusing as to what is being marketed. So,  The Corsair  will help the viewer through the wonderful world of cable with these pithy explanations,  In Media Res:    TNT : Lousy with Middle aged  Testosterone. A musky-smelling channel.  Bruce Willis  and  Steven Seagal  action flics and basketball. Big in New Jersey.   CNN : Used to be a channel for Kings and Queens and heads of state, but of late it is the channel for cranky retired people with an angry opinion on everything political ("Those libs are holding up Medicaid!"). Poor CNN:  They used to wine and dine with kings and queens, but now they are laying in the gutter eating pork and beans.    Lifetime : A channel earnestly devoted to the smouldering resentments of Midwestern housewives. Husbands are to blame in most of these story lines. Anger is the predominant emotion. Hollywood has not been kind to  Nancy McKeon . Hell hath no fury like  Joanna Kearns  scorned!   Family Channel : The channel devoted to Christians in a nuclear family with a conviction that human history has a purpose beyond this world.  Halleleuia . Lots of  Mary Kate and Ashley films , which, ironically, attract a  very different  sort of crowd than the ones that these cats are aiming after.   CNBC : This channel serves as "White Noise" for the various strip joints in the Wall Street and financial district vicinity. As your  Bud Fox -like trader with a "Lawng Island" accent sips a  Stoli  on the rocks on his lunchbreak, sniffing his "Bolivian white Powder" ("Vitamin C"), getting a "friction dance" from his favorite "dancer," he can look over her shoulder, casually, and catch a brief glance at just how the markets are doing, and get a gauge on when he should return to the office.   A&E : An elderly folks network with lots of  Murder, She Wrote , and "original" films like "Horatio Hornblower," for viewers who can remember their glorious years of service in the British Imperial navy policing those hectic colonial ports.   History : This is the  Hitler  and  Outlaw Biker  channel. At any time of the day, there is a  hilbilly bar with serious discussions going on as to Hitler's "tactical blunders" and what they would have done "different," with this channel serving as the background noise.   Discovery : This is the older, skeevier companion network to the already low rent  History Channel , which means that it attracts a  comparatively downscale sort of viewer  than one would expect at History, which is not saying much at all. Seriously, though, This is the  straight up  serial killers network. No joking, yo. Somewhere in the Yosemite Valley there is a man, in a dungeon, sweating profusely, wearing clown makeup and laughing at the moon. He is surrounded by dog collars and he is described by co workers at the post office as "a solitary man."  Guess which channel this guy is watching to drown out the screams. That's right (sotto voce)  Discovery . Homeland security  must needs  to monitor anyone who watches  more than 3 hours a day of this shit .   VH1 : Perhaps the coolest channel on basic cable or otherwise, my little pomegranates! Suffused with irony, snark and nostalgia, this channel supplies the basic components of the Gen X diet.  Michael Hirschorn  is our god;  we are not worthy .   MTV : No longer cool: a  little  resentful of the joie de vivre its older, more successful brother,  VH1 . It will never be the  80s  again and the blush has wore off that ordinary looking frat boy  Carson Daly . No one over 16 should be watching this channel, even for the misguided purpose of irony.   E!:  Creepy celebrity stalking and gossip. Everyone on this channel reeks of thwarted Hollywood ambitions and plastic surgery gone awry. This channel hasn't had a hit since  Gregg Kinnear   was up in this bitch , and  Jules Asner  snatched  Steven Soderberg , using the Asner name (she divorced  Ed Asner's  son years ago).   ESPN:  This is reality tv for the Maxim set. Faint but palpable homoerotic subtext via "hero worship" of alpha males, like, say,  Shaq  or  Sprewell  (but viewers call him Spree, cause, like, they know him personally in a  Calvin Klein  kind of way), although your average  Joe Fratboy  will never acknowledge that distrubing little truth.   Bravo : For the affluent gay man. Cultural programming( National Dog Show ,  Cirque du Soleil ,  Inside the Actors Studio )  and  Queer Eye For the Straight Guy  rebroadcasts. If you go in for the National Dog Show, collect  Lalique  crystal (" Steuben Glass  is for amateurs"), or the like, then this is your network.   BET : A seriously embarassing network marketed to the seedy stereotype of the urban underclass. Ghetto comedy skits told in unremarkable english with frequent reference to bodily functions;  charmed , I'm sure. Snakeoil selling televangelists prevail over the airwaves on Sundays. And C-List Blaxploitations flix fill out the rest of any regrettable week spent watching this schedule.  urlLink Can you fucking believe that Viacom paid three billion dollars for this channel ?   Sci Fi:  The repressed sexuality channel. Their niche is the grown man who has a crush on the X Man,  Storm  and dreams in full-on video games. Somehow the unresolved "sexual energy" gets worked out into a reverence for the "paranormal." B List hot chicks like  Shannen Doherty  and  Tracy Lords  end up here after Hollywood is through with them.   Fox:  If you go in for  Karl Rove's  talking points, this is the channel for you.  The Corsair  has to admit that he watched it during the  Second Gulf War . Fox routinely scooped the other networks because it sometimes seemed that Rummy gave them the inside scoop. For a "family values network," the women broadcasters have an  oddly pornographic patina  about them. Hmmm.   Showtime:   Tries earnestly to out-extreme the original programming at  HBO , who got there first. Dreams of getting recognized at events like the  Golden Globes ; not likely, however. This is the place to try to pitch your indie documentary on transexual underwater basket weavers in  Micronesia .   Food : For people who's interest in food has transcended the purely phenomenal eating stage.    TLC:  This channel is a bit of a mystery to me. It used to have a niche as a sort of  Cliff Clavin  channel: you know, for the general interest trivia mind-- programming on the  imago  stage of child development, poisonous reptiles, the  Minoan  civilization,  Roman  mosaics, classical biological warfare, the robber barons, volcanoes, that sort of thing. But now it has a lot of "fixing up the home" programming. Go figure what that means.   AMC:  Kind of Cool. Old Hollywood glamour with some original programming and commentary on the Gilded Age of Hollywood. This is like a channel put together by the editors of Variety looking backward. Vanity Fair should do a show here. Old school.   FX:  Not worth talking about. Maxim lite. Loads of testosterone.   We:  Women's fantasy. Lots of  Merchant-Ivory  Brit productions of aristocrats who fall in love with common women, who are often middle aged American divorcees. Pure drivel.   C-Span:  For the ultra political science geek. Viewers tend to look like  urlLink Michael Barone , wait anxiously for their  New Republic  copies to arrive, and chuckle over Senate voting record statistics. Can rattle off the precise wording of the Republican Party platform of 1964.   Oxy:  Very "sisterhood" oriented;  Oprah  and  Gerry Laybourne's  experiment has recently taken a sort of Sapphic detour of late with regard to their programming.   National Geographic:   Interesting and kind of cool. This is a channel about animals and exotic cultures.   IFC:   So earnest, so hip, so anti-Hollywood: yet as soon as  Dinner for Five's  indy star  John Favreau  gets to do a big shlocky Hollywood film like  Elf , he jumps like a Cocker Spaniel being offered a dog yummy. Independent cinema is dead.   TCM:  This is a less hip AMC. This is like AMC with a broken hip. Lots of old movies with no irony or relevant commentary.   Ovation:   The Corsair  has a theory that this is a piece of flotsam adrift on the vast media ocean that is digital television. They repeat the same ten or so programs ad nauseum. Is there anyone employed at Ovation? Did the programmer have a heart attack in the 80s? Did anyone notice? Is anyone watching?   ESPNClassic:  Oh, dear lord help us. Old men with beer bellies reliving "classic sports moments." (At this point,  Bruce Springsteen's   Glory Days  should be playing). This is the tv channel  Al Bundy  would most likely be watching on his day off from the shoe store.   TVLand:   Tries to be all retro-ironical, but street cred will not be forthcoming by running repeats of  Bewitched  and  Sanford and Son , alone. Poor saps. The other networks have bought all the good old tv shows, leaving TV Land to contemplate Mayberry.    Animal:  Television for committed vegans and PETA members. What kind of ad revenue do these guys generate?   Sundance:   An edgy IFC; very left wing political, but  pure .  Robert Redford's  pet liberal project.   Trio:  Perhaps the coolest channel of them all. What VH1 viewers will most likely watch once they quit being ironic, get real jobs in the media and participate in the economy. Used to be a Canadian station, believe it or not. Culture and media navel gazing.   NWI:  A rap up of all the international anti-American news agencies.  Al Gore  wants to buy this station and kick things up a notch.   DiscoveryTimes:   One of the strangest channels in the world. this is actually the  New York Times'  channel, but it is devoted to showing America militarized or in crisis, which, all told, are the moments when  The Old Grey Lady  was at its finest. Lots of Civil rights struggles, war footage, terrorism analysis, and --wierdest of all -- endless looks into our military academies.  What the fuck?!    FUSE:  MTV's unsuccessful competitor for the extreme generation low attention span kiddie market, which is not saying much.   VH1Classic:  Could be interesting, as the X Generation is big on nostalgia, but right now this channel is  not happening.    USA:  This is the sybil channel. It is high testosterone most of the year, but come holiday time it is all about the holidays... kinda like our dads.   Style:  If it is possible this is an even more shallow channel than E! Lots of B-List types talking about the beauty business.

       Corsair 2003 Year End Awards:   The Pirates   Every blogger worth their salt has year end awards and "this thing of ours" is no different. It's in the kool aid that we all drink from. 'Tis the season to be snarky,  and all that jazz  (sorry  urlLink Cindy Adams , that's jazz, not your annoying little lapdog  urlLink Jazzy ). So, without further ado,  The Corsair  presents The Pirates -- more credible than the  urlLink Golden Globes , and able to leap tall publicists in a single bound -- my 2003 year end awards. Basta!    Most Embarassing Media Moment  pirate goes to  Paris Hilton  beating the  urlLink President's first post Sadaam interview .  Howard Kurtz  of the uber media program  urlLink Reliable Souces  on CNN read my little email at the end of his show:   "And  Ron (Mwangaguhunga ) says -- 'Of all I know that you Northeast corridor media types will give the victory to  Jayson Blair  scandal, the most embarrassing media moment for the rest of the country has got to be  Paris Hilton  beating  President Bush's  in-depth post-Saddam interview in the ratings.'"   Thanks, Howie: love to love you, baby.   Great Read  pirate goes to the  Village Voice's  beloved columnist  urlLink Michael Musto . Musto is damn fun to read. His voice is pure and his love of pop culture, served with a dash of snark and a side portion of gossip is downtown through and through. It's  La Dolce Musto's  world, we just live in it.   The Wierdest Hair  pirate goes to  Donald Trump . There's something (grimaces) ... something (frowns, shifts in chair) ... something  not quite right  about  urlLink Trumper's hairdo .    Takes One to Know One  pirate goes to blowhard defrocked (or left of his own accord,  whatever ) Catholic priest  John McLaughlin . The vow of poverty left way behind (way,  way  behind), he once declared to  George  that he would love to come back in another life as the  Sultan of Brunei . Continuing in that homage to tyrants and corrupt rulers, the  pseudoconservative  voted last Sunday on Russian autocrat  Vladimir Putin  as  Person of the Year . His reasoning? "The person to lead Russia into the 21st century is a blend of despot and small 'd' democrat." Hmm. Takes one to know one,  Father John .   The  He's taken to Jebus  pirate goes to  Howard Dean .  Superphilosopher  Leo Strauss  used to exhort his disciples to  urlLink immerse themselves in the religions that they grew up with  and use his rigorous method of examining texts to vivify their religious experience. After  Joe Lieberman  attacked Dean on his religion flank,  urlLink Dean done got the lord in him . Which is a smart move as we all have a little bit of the puritain about us, whether Whitmanesque or Emersonian or even the Ginzberg-Kerouacesque hippie Buddhist. Why else would all the news magazines do those religious cover stories come springtime? Or  Milton Bradley  sell all those  Ouija Boards  to malicious high school kids wanting to freak out the repressed virgins in the crowd.   And on the subject of newsweeklies, the  Dutch Trucker Hat of Obsolescence  (worn backwards) pirate goes to  US News and World Report . Does anyone read  Mort Zuckerman's  bronze medalist in the newsweekly marathon? Is this purely a vanity affair? Aside from affording the colosally boring  Michael Barone  a chance to dress up and play journo ("want to hear about FDR's postal reforms?") is there any other use for this? Semi glossy bird cage papering, anyone?   Best Blog  pirate goes to  Choire Sicha's   urlLink Gawker  and  Elizabeth Spier's   urlLink Kicker . Those two are the standard to which we all aspire. Thanks guys.   The Best Name  Pirate goes to  The New York Times'   urlLink Jennifer 8 Lee .  And I know whereof I speak : After graduating from college, I sent a snail mail letter (hey, it was 1994) to  Roger Ebert  asking advice on making a splash in the media swirl. He said, and I'm paraphrasing, that not to be cynical, (I) should emphasize my last name because it is memorable (well, how many Mwangaguhunga's do you know anyhow?). Well,  so is Jennifer's .   With Great Power Comes Great Responibility  pirate goes to  urlLink Page Six . I love 'em, pure and simple (we also love the first  urlLink power couple of NY Gossip Rush and Molloy , yang to the Page Sixer ying). Page Six is the hands down  best  daily gossip media organization.  urlLink Ian Spiegelman  went public, giving us some  inside  on the working of this great institution. They broke up  Uma  and  Ethan  and saved  Nicole Kidman  from making a biiig mistake.  Richard Johnson ,  Chris Wilson ,  Paula Froelich  and  Ian  can all take a bow. You guys rock hard:  keep on keeping on .  The  Ubiquitous as Ugg Boots  pirate goes to  urlLink David Brooks.  The conservative sociologist "Brooks Brother" (I call him that) was  everywhere  this year, explaining Manhattanites to the Bush states.  Did you know, for example, that in most areas outside of the Manhattan and DC and LA and Silicon Valley power nexus you can get a breakfast for under $2?  Fascinating . I guess that's why our man Brookie thinks that the inhabitants of the heartland are more real than the mediaratti.   Although Brooks would scoff at the s- Ugg -gestion of being associated with such trendy footwear, we still love to read him.  The  Jordana Brewster Career that Wasn't  pirate goes to  Jennifer Love Hewitt . Stalking the celebrity caravan at the outskirts, the self professed " urlLink Love "  wasn't getting any. Hollywood is mean to starlets, ask  Jimmy Woods'  former chippie  Heather Graham  about that one. Once something of a movie star,  urlLink Love  is guest starring in unwatchable music videos and dodgy tv shows.  Next?    The  Mischief Maker  pirate goes to  Robert Novak . Look at this man. Observe him closely. His smile declares malice to the world. Good will towards man? Ha; more likely bad intentions! Very ...  bad  ...  intentions . This man actually kind of scares me a little. It's those moist rat-like eyes that seem to twinkle in the downfall of a good politician. From the  urlLink Chicago Sun Times  and  urlLink The Capitol Gang , the Prince of Darkness works his merry brand of mischief. Whether insinuating himself in the  urlLink Valerie Plame affair  or being lambasted by fellow conservatives as being an "Unpatriotic American"  urlLink in National Review , Robert was as much a story as the issues he covered. When Novak scuttles by it is said one hears the unholy  bleating of the goat ,  sulfurous malodors arise  and the cacophanous echo of  cloven hoofs striking marble  abound.    The Low Down Dirty Dog  pirate goes to  Lenny Kravitz . Lenny would rather let his career rule over  urlLink love . The far-ahead-of-her-time Britisher songbird  Neneh Cherry  warned all women in the spirit of sisterhood to  steer clear  from Mr. Kravitz with her musical diss " urlLink Buddy X ," which described Lenny in all his hypocritical narcissistic glory, and how he broke the heart of  Lisa Bonet , who risked her career to pursue their relationship.  Neneh sang:  "I don't care what you do/ But there's a hypocrite that lives in you/ Cause if your woman gave her love/ In the same way that you do/ You'd feel a-way/ You know you would"  And  urlLink Page Six  broke it all down for us,  ninja-style , at the  urlLink beginning of December , revealing that Lenny's relationship with  Nicole Kidman  was an elaborate publicity ploy -- or so he bragged to friends -- to raise his moribund career. I do hate the game, but in this case I don't very much like the playa,  if you must know . I find Lenny a  low down dirty dog  for chosing, of all people, the most publicly jilted woman in the world, our  Nic Kidman , who was divorced in the full media spotlight, immediately following a  urlLink miscarriage . Outside of  urlLink Euripedes' Medea , it's hard to thing of a more badly jilted celebrity. Great timing, and great show Lenny Kravitz, always adept at raising the image of black men in America --  asshole !   The Christmas spirit  pirate goes to  urlLink The Charlie Brown Christmas special .  The Corsair  isn't always snarky, but this year, for whatever reason, the old Xmas cheer  just wasn't there . Nada; it wasn't happening and I couldn't, for the life of me, get into the whole commercial holiday drunken office party thing. I couldn't even put up a credible front. Then along came that darn  Charlie Brown Christmas special .    I am not a pussy . I am not saying that I got teary-eyed, or anything like that.  You wouldn't respect me if I made that fact known anyway. My snark web cred would be at zero percentage,  sho nuff . Let's just say  The Corsair  got a little  ocular moisture  over said tv show,  okay ? And let's just leave it at that.  The  Meta Network  pirate award is a tie. My two favorite networks,  urlLink Trio  and  urlLink VH1  win the honor. Both networks seem to subsist on commentary on the excesses of the established networks, the Golden Globes, the bad sit coms, the commercials, the beauty pageants, all that stuff -- and I  love  it. How  meta  is that? They take the thin gruel offered by the dinosaurs and rolls pop cultural sushi. In fact, the only cable channels that hold any water with me are Trio and Vh1.  urlLink Michael Hirschorn  and  urlLink Laura Zalaznick , take your bows now, you truly deserve the applause.   The Que Pasa USA?  pirate goes to the Latino people, who surpassed African Americans as the largest minority in the US. Let's have some love for our Spanish-speaking brothers and sisters. And higher representation on the magazine covers and tv programming, okay? A one time only  Salma Hayek  issue in which the terminally unfunny Dame Edna blasts latinos doesn't count,  Graydon  ... and take that Winston Light out of your mouth when I'm getting all righteous!  The  She ran for Governor of California to become the Mayor of Hollywood  pirate goes to  Arianna Huffington .  Crazy like Swayze . As Ahrnold made his leap from Hollywood to Politics, Arianna made a simultaneous  leap  (watch you're heads, fellas), thus terminating the vacuum left behind, from Politics to Hollywood. Somehow, Arianna Huffington came out of her  quixotic  independent party run for governor as the cool political voice of the  urlLink Hollywood set , heir to all their  influence  and  affluence  and  radical chic . How did that happen and did anyone even  observe its occurence?  The woman is  smooth  ... Sade made that sultry song about her -- she's whip smart, a devastating rhetorician, a formidable reinventor of self and  she is dark .   Greek dark . Admiring Arianna is like admiring the guy who picks your pocket beneath your notice, under your radar,  on the DL . If Arianna were a man, she would be in the Senate, possibly in a leadership position, or maybe even Prime Minister of England, where she spent her college years.   urlLink Six Million Dollar Woman  pirate goes to every young man's older woman fantasy,  Demi Moore . Undergoing what can only be described in Pravda, of all places, as  urlLink "massive plastic surgery ," Demi went from being pretty, to some kind of wonderful. Demi gave new meaning to the Golden Globes. She is our bionic woman, a real life analog to the hyperadvancement in technology. She is bigger technology news than the blackberry pager. One imagines, with tongue in cheek and a heart full of mirth, the conversation at that historic moment when the plastic surgeons conducted their  urlLink Wierd Science  on her:  "We can rebuild her. We have the technology. We have the capability to make the world's first Bionic woman.  Demi Moore  will be that woman. Better than she was before. Thinner . . . bustier . . .  tighter ."  When you get tired of Ashton, Demi ...  call me ?    The Six Pieces of Bubblegum Diet  Award goes to  Dylan Lauren . I find  urlLink Dylan , the socialite owner of Dylan's candy store, to be immensely fascinating. She's sweeter than an  Alexander the Grape !  Although she sells  50,000,000  calories of candy in a year, she remains rail thin, like most Upper class Upper East siders chicks. How does anyone working in a candy store come off looking, well, to be frank, a little anorexic (and I mean that in the nicest possible  urlLink Nan Kempner  kind of way). In the  Your Body  section of the  January 2004 Harper's Bazaar , written up by one  Jacqueline deMontravel  she gives up the goods and  urlLink reveals her eating habits to us, the readers . Sweet fucking Jesus I never knew that rich women go through  such deprivation !  The diet is as follows:   "Ninety percent of my diet consists of healthy foods, 10 percent of indulgences. 8:30 A.M. Large bowl of mixed fruit (half a melon, an orange and one cup of blueberries) 9 A.M. One-hour run (6-8 miles) 10 A.M. Stretching for 15 minutes 10:05 A.M. 8-oz. Emer'gen-C ElectroMix electrolyte-fortified sports drink, liter of water 10:30 A.M. Omelet with six egg whites, one cup of broccoli and spinach, and fat-free cream cheese 1 P.M. Liter of bottled water with lemon 2 P.M. Salad with 3-oz can of tuna, ginger dressing, a multivitamin, 8 oz. Of diet Coke, 10-15 gummy bears 3 P.M. Liter of bottled water 4 P.M. One medium grapefruit 6 P.M One-hour session of weight training 7 P.M. Six pieces of bubble gum 8 P.M. 8-oz. Glass of water 8:30 P.M. Half a roasted butternut squash, 4 oz. Of steamed Chilean sea bass, stalk of steamed kale, spoonful of Birthday Cake ice cream 10 P.M. 8-oz. Cup of hot water with lemon Total calories consumed: Approximately 1520"  Six pieces of bubblegum at 7pm, huh? Well, as  The Corsair  is writing this at around one, poor Ms. Lauren is half way between bottled water and her tuna salad and gummy bear break. Let's send good vibrations her way, huh peeps:  you can do it, Ricky ! Resist the smell of those everlasting godstoppers. Beauty is pain!  The  Thug Life Born, Thug Life Bred  Award goes to  Harvey Weinstein , the good natured "indie" studio exec, who appears to have the thickest skin of any media personality in the world.  Michael Wolff  skewered him in  urlLink Autumn of the Moguls , calling him "grotesque," "a thug," "a great and gross manipulator." Wolff added, for good measure, "he is generally thought to have good taste. He's kind of kitsch."   Ouch . Thems fighting words when applied to a  pseudointellectual  like Big Harv, the man who inflicted  Roberto Benigni  on  urlLink Western civilization .  Weinstein returned fire by  urlLink actually  attending  the book party at Michael's restaurant .  Like water rolling off a thugs back  ...   The Girl, Interrupted Award  goes to  Paris Hilton , who finds  urlLink answering her cell phone  to be of  greater imperative  than pursuing good vibrations by way of  Rick Solomon . Well, that's showing us that the girl has her priorities in order.   The Jenna Dewan  pirate award goes to  Fisher Stevens . Every so often a chestnut bubbles up from the oozing cesspool that is the eternally adolescent mind of  Howard Stern , who, mirabile dictu, was seen  urlLink dining with Steve Martin at Coco Pazzo.   They must have been discussing  urlLink Picasso's late erotic paintings .   Anyhoo:  one such magical Sternian chestnut is  the Jenna Dewan Game . It goes like this: name a "celebrity" whose name you know  but really shouldn't.  And if you say  Ron Mwangaguhunga , I'll be heartbroken.  Jenna Dewan  is famous for  urlLink dancing for Justin Timberlake and then dating him.   The Corsair would like to add the august name of  Fisher Stevens  to the Jenna Dewan game.  Why did I spend much of the last quarter of the year on the  urlLink ex-Mr. Michelle Pfeiffer ? I don't know ... I really don't know, but for a second there, it was as if  urlLink Fisher Stevens  was busting loose, breaking all bounds, about to reach the media heavens, as if  everything  was finally going to go right with him and he wouldn't have to hang out anymore with unsavory past-their-expiration-date type seedy "stars" such as  urlLink Matt Dillon . But no, false alarm. Fisher's still just fisher.  The  Has Been  pirate goes to California's former Milk dud munching gerbil faced geek of a governor,  Gray Davis , who showed us that he has Vice Presidential levels of charisma lazily wobbling out of his veal-like torso. Proving he  did not  have what it takes to govern the fifth largest economy in the world, Gray Davis put on a campaign so lackluster that it made Al Gore's 2000 bid look like  urlLink Napoleon at Jena .  Fuck !  The  Never Was  pirate goes to  urlLink Vincent Gallo , auteur du cinema. That  rat's ass  can polish his pirate award like  urlLink Coolio and his Grammy  as far as I'm concerned because this will be the  last goddamn honor  he will receive. Ever! (shouts, shakes fist at computer screen) The vole-like "star" put out the verminy-titled film Brown Bunny in which he receives the most talked about blowjob since  Monica  blew  Bill  from  Chloe Sevigny , whose  urlLink current dental condition  might make for a  fascinating  reshoot.    Anyhoo:   Sleazy creep  urlLink Gallo  -- aptly named --  whined  about  urlLink Roger Ebert's bad review  of his unwatchable "work."   Why?  Even Gallo remarks that he made a stinker. He was 'Le scandal de Festival' at Cannes. Why do we still talk about him? By now he should have beat out  Fisher Stevens  for the  Jenna Dewan  award!  The  Dance Move of the Year  pirate is a three way tie.  Neve  ("First off it's pronounced Neve, not Ne-vee!") Campbell  wins for her surprisingly graceful moves in  urlLink The Company .   The other ties are  Al Sharpton , who threw down some  urlLink serious foot magic on SNL , impersonating his one time mentor,  James Brown .  The third and last tie award goes to  Calvin Klein , whose  urlLink substance-abuse feuled sprint to courtside to pitch woo  at  Latrell Sprewell  exhibited a surprising grace. The things one does for love ...   The  Most Irrelevant Magazine  pirate goes to  Rolling Stone . I am of two minds on the subject. First,  May 3, 1998 , to me, was the day the music died. Rolling Stone Magazine, the embodiment of hip counterculture colluded with the Giuliani adminitration as a corporate sponsor for "Family Day" to displace the Million Marijuana March from Washington Square Park.  urlLink No lie .   Also: putting  April Lavigne  on the cover of March 2003 was a very sad reminder that even though the music has died at Rolling Stone, the stink still lingers like a fucking puddle of stillwater at 1290 Avenue of the Americas.  The  He Kept Us On Our Toes  pirate goes to  Michael Wolff . Oh you can love the man (and we do) or you can hate the man, but if you care about the media, you have to keep you eyeballs firmly affixed to  urlLink Michael Wolff . Unlike  Tina Brown , Wolff appears to be genuinely thoughtful, capable of expounding on politics and media in something other than "synergetic" buzzwords. Whether it was that  urlLink crazy little    urlLink Centcom fiasco , or his tome  urlLink Autumn of the Moguls ,  urlLink his will-he-or-wont-he-buy New York  -- the man has style. He is one of the best interpreters of the media, and,  simultaneously  one of the canniest players in the media.    The  Jill Clayburgh Older Women are the New Black  pirate goes to  Diane Keaton . Looking for Ms. Goodbar? An older, more mellow blend of nougat, you say?  Older women are veering around the national landscape like Calvin Klein  in hot pursuit of Latrell Sprewell . Why? Is this a delayed reaction from the popularity of  The Golden Girls ? No. In the case of  Diane Keaton's    meteoric  rise to sex symbol from author of a  urlLink book on bad Clown art  is the most surprising. What is even more surprising is that Keaton  actually likes  the bad Americana clown art.   Taste isn't everything,  I guess.  She's got "it" says the  urlLink Sun Herald . She's portrayed as "passionate" and "desirable" says the  urlLink NY Times .  urlLink The Washington Post  goes so far as to call her a "babe."  And she is in a manner of speaking, to be frank. Her rise comes at the tailend of a year where Tinseltown said: it's okay for older women to be considered sex symbols. Look at  Demi Moore  and  urlLink Ashton Kutcher , for one example, and even, the  not old   Cameron Diaz , 31, who is dating  Justin Timberlake , who is  urlLink 23 . Then, of course, there is the  urlLink 12 year age difference  between  50 Cent  and  Vivica Fox . Hey,  it's all good.   From  urlLink older women-younger men  it was a short hop skip and jump to  older woman as sex object , when you think about it.   So, jumping bones with  Diane Keaton ? I don't know, but I'd definitely like to have some coffee with her and ask her about her absurd position on clown art.   The  I Wanna Be Vice President  pirate goes to Senator  Bob Graham  of Florida. Jesus Christ, I have never seen a man lust after the Vice Presidency in my life. Like Golem chasing after the ring of power("my preccciousss!!!"),  Graham wants this thing. I mean, what is there so grand and swishy about the office, huh? You get to go to rubbery chicken fundraisers. You get to go to funerals of dead heads of state in remote but politically important nations. You get to speak at fascinating places like -- yawn -- the Daughters of the American Revolution, and such.  So why has Bob Graham gone out of his way -- no, strike that -- gone  way the fuck  out of his way to get the post. First he ran a  urlLink quixotic campaign  which no one believed he was in to win. Then pulled out just before he had to burn bridges by campaigning negative. The he quit his extremely important Florida Senate seat, making him that much more important to keep on the Presidential ticket in order to keep the state. God, this man has a  love jones  for the Vice Presidency and The Corsair cannot for the life of him figure out:  why ?   Runner ups in the chasing the ring of power contest include  Newt Gingrich  chasing after Secretary of State,  James Baker  chasing after Secretary of State (hey, Colin Powell is laid up recovering from prostate cancer -- als fair in love and politics!) and  George Pataki , chasing after fellow Yalie  Dick Cheney's  position on the ticket.  The  Hey, I Really Am Black  pirate goes to  Michael Jackson . Like OJ before him, Michael found his black roots  just in time  for jury selection in his criminal case. Now he's Muslim and giving an interview to  Ed Bradley  and, we imagine, BET to prove that he really is black, although the visual seems to contradict the fact. Coming soon:  Michael proclaims his innocence on the labels of the bean pies!

       Happy Holidays   I'd like to take the time to wish you, my little pomegranates, a healthy and happy holiday season. Thank you for poutting up with me during the year. One types and types and wonders if anyone is even reading. You are, and I am filled with gratitude. I'll recharge my batteries and be back on Friday. Until then, guys, cheers,  Ron Mwangaguhunga The Corsair  (oh yeah, here's  urlLink Al Gore's son's mugshot .)  (oh yeah, and  urlLink an NBC reporter got run over by a reindeer )

       The Charlie Rose Drinking Game    The art of the interview is to draw out the subject while the interviewer recedes into the background. Although  Charlie Rose  delivers the goods on any given weekday, he uses the first person singular personal pronoun often.  Excedingly  often. Okay: all the damned time. Charlie, thank you for giving us those great interviews with  Will Ferrell  and  Luca Cordero di Montezemolo , but honestly:  It's not all about you . All those  I's  and  me's  Charlie; it's not all about you.   So, in the spirit of Charlie Rose's energetic use of the first person singular personal pronoun,  The Corsair  proposes  The Charlie Rose Drinking Game . It's late at night, it was a hard day at work, you are about to go to bed and Charlie is interviewing some Master of the Universe -- so why not have a drinkie poo on everyones favorite social climber- cum-interviewer? Every time Charlie uses the first person singular personal pronoun, down a shot.    And don't use any of the cheap stuff , ladies and gentlemen, this is Charlie Rose we're talking about, and that whole "corridors of power Illuminati Trilateral Commission" power nexus. One doesn't just down muscatel with Charlie Rose; you better  recognize .   If you are still conscious after the drinking game, then you are a candidate for the  Jared Paul Stern  Ironman Drinkie-poo competition.

       New Celebrity Mugshots   Tis the season to be jolly, and what better way to be jolly than to scope out celebrities at the top of their game getting collared for a stint in the pokey!  Shadenfreude !  There, I said it : a day cannot pass happily without mention of that  Germanic buzz word , which is now almost past it's prime.  Almost .   Anyhoo:  Check out  Johnny Cash  in a  urlLink 1965 drug bust .  And here's  50 Cent   urlLink awaiting felony charges for peddling crack cocaine and heroin .   Oh, here's a sweetie,  Andre the Giant ,  urlLink awaiting arraignment for "roughing up a local tv cameraman."   Oh dear sweet lord ... can you imagine the poor wretch who had to  share a cell  with Andre? Can you fathom a moist Oz-like scenario where a hapless convict has to do Andre's laundry? Or  fluff his pillows for him ? ( please excuse  the pun there)  But my all-time favorite is  Robert Downey, Jr,  inexplicably bubbly as  urlLink he gets ready to serve some serious time on a drug conviction . He deserves an Oscar for this performance.

       The Paris Hilton-Trey Lindley Aftermath   The little town of  urlLink Altus, AK , not Bethlehem, is still reeling from  The Simple Life  stars  Paris Hilton  and  Nicole Ritchie , who were anything but simple,  urlLink according to The Star Magazine .  Up until now, Altus has been positive about the whole pr affair. But lately, as The Star reports, bitterness has set in. It's the extreme wealth that Paris is generating on top of her already considerable fortune that is sizzling the playa hating juices of the little town of Altus.   urlLink Julia Campbell writes :  "The small town of Altus -- population, 817 -- agreed to let Fox come in to film the show because they believed it would put their little town on the map and bring in much-needed revenue from tourism. Well, the town is definitely on the map, but so far, Altus has netted a mere $59 from the girls' participation in a kissing booth at the town's annual spring festival, the Springdale Gala. Meanwhile, Paris reportedly stands to make more than $3 million from a sequel show and other projects. 'Must be nice,'says Altus' mayor,  urlLink Veronica Post . 'We would have been happy with $150,000 for a new fire station.'"   Trey Lindley , Paris' boytoy, is still milking his 15 minutes of fame, because according to the article:  "Trae Lindley, was 'smitten' with the hotel heiress, according to Trae's father,  George Lindley . The couple occasionally still talk on the phone, he says. 'When she was down here, they were always together,' says  Russell Sturdivant , 19, who played basketball with Trae. 'But I don't know how serious it was.'  "George Lindley says the feelings between his son and Paris were mutual, but that it was Paris who plucked his son out of a crowd. 'Trae is not the type to go over and be forward and introduce himself and say 'Hey, I'm the big man on campus,' George says. 'Apparently, Paris picked him.'"  But there were  other boys , I mean, you don't expect your typical boy crazy socialite alpha female to settle down with one  mate in her sojourn into the heartlands:  "Lindley wasn't Paris' only pick, say locals. One boy, who would not give his name, claimed that he had a fling with Paris.  Karen Stites , whose husband Scott owns the local bar  Hog Calls , says Paris planted a wet kiss on her husband's lips. 'He was so proud of it because she's a celebrity,' she says. 'I guess he figured it was a free pass.'  urlLink Bill 'Buffalo' Leding , owner of the Lakeside Mart gas station and convenience store says, 'We've got some pretty girls around here, but when you bring someone to the town who's confident and spends the money taking care of herself, these boys are bound to swoon over her.'"  Read it for  urlLink yourself .

       Limbaugh Medical Records To Be Released to Prosecution   As the fellows at  urlLink The Smoking Gun salivate  like a Wall Street broker at a strip club on his lunch hour, a Florida Judge has ruled that  Rush Limbaugh's  medical records can be released to prosecutors, but must be kept from Enquiring minds,  if you know what I mean .  The investigation is to find out whether or not Limbaugh engaged in "doctor shopping" as a bid to fuel his addiction. The Smoking Gun has posted Limbaugh's incredibly large drug stash yielded in the search of his home  urlLink here .

       Elizabeth Spiers Shines   The patron saint of all good bloggers,  Elizabeth Spiers  gets her comeuppance in the form of  urlLink a glowing New York Times profile  and we can not be more happy for her.  On the history of the very cute Miss Spiers,  urlLink Shaila K. Dewan  writes:   "(Spiers) had a difficult time persuading her parents to let her apply to an out-of-state college, but nonetheless ended up at  Duke University , where she took Arabic, wrote a paper on terrorism and considered working for the State Department or an intelligence service. 'I applied to the C.I.A. but nobody called me back,' she says."  Hey, what's up with that? First  urlLink Page Six's spectacular editor Richard Johnson  and now Elizabeth Spiers? If Richard and Elizabeth cannot get the scoop on our enemies, then what makes you think  urlLink Valerie Plame  will?  Fo' shizzle .    Anyhoo:   The Corsair  counts as his main influences  urlLink Spy ,  Elizabeth Spiers ,  Page Six ,  urlLink Kierkegaard's battle against the original Corsair  and ... uh... well, this is not about me ...  it's about Spiers .  And, in a sense it is about about  all  bloggers. This is the golden age of blogging -- everyone and their grandma has a blog. Recently,  urlLink The Daily Candy  (a semi blog) sold for between $3 and $4 million. Now Ms. Spiers gets her due. How much longer before  urlLink The Gothamist  gets a show on  urlLink NY1 ?  When will  The Corsair  get a gig on  urlLink MSNBC ?  Or essay writing privileges at  Vanity Fair ?  I'm getting off track again.  Any time things veer away from being  about me  I lose interest (I can't help it, I'm a Gemeni), so I'll say it quickly before the mood evaporates:  Congratulations Elizabeth Spiers on a well deserved moment in the sun.

       Justin Timberlake and N Sinc: Racists?!   Say what you will about  urlLink NSync , that they were a sucky boy band, that Joey Fatone got busy with older woman Kathy Griffith, or even that they are a Backstreet rip off.  Accroding to that significant cultural artifact  urlLink The National Enquirer , former NSync band manager  Ibrahim Duarte  is accusing Justin Timberlake, among other band members of using the n-word in a way that does not bespeak of brotherhood and friendship.   Tom DiNardo  writes:  "Ibrahim Duarte filed a $10 million lawsuit November 25 in New York Supreme Court, saying he was fired without warning in 2000 -- after suffering a constant barrage of racial remarks, incidents and humiliation."  "In one fiery confrontation, Timberlake -- now a successful solo artist -- exhibited astounding racial insensitivity, according to the complaint.   "The singer said to Mr. Duarte, 'You niggas ain't s---.'"  Duarte's attorney Douglas Wigdor told The ENQUIRER: 'Justin Timberlake used the N word to Mr. Duarte frequently.'"  Tha article goes on to say:  "What's more, the emotionally charged suit states that once during the summer of 2000, band member  Lance Bass  'segregated' Duarte by placing him on a separate tour bus away from the band and other personnel."   Segregated?   Come on, Ibrahim ...  come on . You almost had me there. I was all set to go off on a rant about that evil Justin Timberlake and march with the  Reverend Al Sharpton  against him interloping in the  R and B  game, but then you had to pull the segregation shit and now the credibility is no percentage. Why doesn't Ibrahim just sue for the real cause, he got his ass fired and missed out on he  NSync gravy train  and the subsequent  Timber-lake o' cash .   Once you have understood that, the article takes a more  comedic  tone:  "'Duarte always traveled with the band on their bus and Mr. Bass did not ask any of the White/Caucasian employees who regularly traveled with the band to travel on the other bus . . . ,' according to the suit. "  What ever .

      (scroll below  Paris Hilton - Trey Lindley fans )   Most Embarrassing Media Moment   The Kenyan coffee was pipin' hot as to our liking, the  Sunday New York Times  was sprawled underneath my feet and  Howie Kurtz  was interviewing the "shark-eyed"  Sam Donaldson , throaty professional Presidential "advisor"   urlLink David Gergen  and the ever-smiley singsong  urlLink Robin Wright  on  urlLink CNN's Reliable Sources  about something called "Spider Hole Journalism."  All that we needed was  urlLink Smokey to sing for everything to be good in the world  ... tonight .   Anyhoo:  At the end of said convocation of the Beltway Insiders, Zowie Howie relayed that he wants viewers to send in their votes for "The Most Embarrassing Media moment," which suggests that even Howie isn't immune to the charms of  shadenfreude  (do we get spanked for using  urlLink that word ?).    Of course, the winner is going to be the  urlLink Camel Filter  poster boy Jayson Blair . But that doesn't mean that  you can't accost Howie  with your own picks. The email is  reliable@cnn.com , and he will read the most soundbytable little morsels on the show. And tell him  The Corsair  sent you.  For my money,  urlLink Paris Hilton beating President George Bush's   in depth interview with  Diane Sawyer  on Sadaam's capture takes the cake, or  urlLink Iraqi Pomegranate Soup ,  if you will .

       Paris Hilton: Homewrecker!   (Note: This story is reprinted from  12-18 , but for some reason people are requesting it, so I'm putting it up here.  Trey Lindley's  15 minutes and all that. Please scroll down to the new stuff on  Kournikova and Julio ,  George Stephanopoulos ,  Neve Campbell  and CNN's  Howie Kurtz's Most Embarassing Media Moments  if you have already read it. Sorry about that, my little pomegranates)   urlLink The National Enquirer  reports that  Paris Hilton , while taping her reality show  The Simple Life , wrecked the relationship of two high school sweethearts in  Altus, AK , and then  got the hell out of town quicker than a wayward preacher faced with a shotgun wedding !    Caroline Cains  --the earth angel-- told the  Enquirer :  "Thanks to Paris, the future  Trae  (Lindley) and I were building was ripped apart within a matter of days ... As lovers, Trae and I are back to square one."    Caroline Cains  and  Trey Lindley  were  Mr. and Miss Ozark High  in the 2003 yearbooks, but apparently, Trey thought being Paris'  Arkansas fling  was a more  prestigious  title. Or, at least  cooler  for a high school kid when in the locker room with the guys. Men.  Trae spoke out in the same interview:  "There's a chance Caroline and I can mend our relationship, but it's going to take a lot of work. Caroline just doesn't trust me anymore."    Noo : really? Ah, young naive love. Why can't the  Real World  be as exciting as this? Come to think of it, when was the last time that TRW was even exciting?  A source told  urlLink The Enquirer :  "(Paris) admitted to at least one person in Altus that 'The Simple Life' producers encouraged her to find a romantic counterpart because they thought it would make for 'good TV.'   "It wasn't very difficult for her to find a fall guy, because Paris was the first celebrity most of the townspeople had ever met. And she used that star power to cast a spell on Trae."  The story goes on ( Corsair  munches popcorn distractedly, leans in to computer screen) ...:  "'Paris met Trae at the Altus bait shop where she and Nicole were working, and Trae was smitten.   "'Then Paris ran into him a few nights later when she and Nicole were carousing, hanging out with some neighborhood kids at a local gas station.   "'Trae is a handsome guy, so when Paris saw him again she made it pretty clear she wanted to hook up. And as the evening progressed, she continued to pursue him.   "'As soon as Paris learned about Caroline through one of Trae's friends, she giggled and said,  He has a fiancee? Well, we'll see about that!    "'She started rubbing against Trae, batting her baby blues, and flipping her hair.   "'By the end of the evening, Trae had forgotten all about his fiancee and had become Paris' toyboy ... whatever Paris wanted to do with him, he was game. It was really sad to watch Paris take a couple who were so madly in love and destroy them without a care in the world."   Bait shop. Gas station. Leg rubbing. Hooking up. This story has it all: the heartland, an uptown girl, reality tv, and romantic betrayal (Corsair claps). You've got to  urlLink read it to believe it . Oh good job, guys; inquiring minds are satisfied.   Now, if only we could fit a  Golum  into the story.   Entertainment Update:  Congratulations to  Russell Crowe  and his wife,  Danielle Spenser , who gave birth to a boy,  Charles Spencer Crowe  on Sunday night, weighing 2.8 odd foot of grunt (6 pounds 2 ounces).

       Stephanopoulos Is In The Cut   Yeah, I came down hard on  Geoorge Stephanopoulos  a while ago. I came down on Our Man Georgie like stupid on  urlLink Senator Patty Murray . In a  very special Corsair , dated Halloween 2003, we wrote:  "Not since  Attilla the Hun's  aggressive campaign against the Roman Empire has anyone been so audacious and bold as  George Stephaopoulos'  very public transformation from the creepy giggling elf behind  James Carville's  Cajun strategist routine into a respected network news correspondent, or, as they say in the biz a "Wise Man." Imagine the massive  thumos  involved (George would appreciate the Greek philosophical reference) to think that you can go from the "the mouthpiece that turned" of the  Clinton Years  to  Cronkite  or  Eric Sevareid , if you will, without paying the requisite dues. One wonders whether the appropriate response is to applaud or to be appalled at the cheek displayed."   Ouch.  We were in  rare spirits  that day ( Cutty Sark , to be precise), so cut us some slack.    George Stephanopoulos  did a bang up job shoring up all that raw ambition into some decent content on  urlLink This Week on Sunday .  The mop-headed Wise Man slogged through The Hague to give us the behind the scenes with  urlLink Wesley Clark facing off in a smackdown at the Hague with Slobodan Milosevic . Then afterwards, he shuttled to  Littleton, New Hampshire  to follow the NATO General on the campaign trail.   The most arresting scene by far was when Milosevic, cross examing Clark, read from  urlLink Peter Boyer's damning New Yorker article , confronting Clark about disparaging comments on his leadership (BTW: How the fuck does a  war criminal  at the Hague get a New Yorker subscription?!) by  Amy Gen. Henry Shelton , former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.   With a slow, devious  predator's smile , Milosevic asked -- through a translator -- "So your former superior talks about your character. Isn't that right, General Clark ... Why were you removed from your post prematurely?"  It was an evil moment.  Tryants cornered, like rats, will do anything --  anything  -- to survive, and Milosevic did as his slimy character dictated. Afterwards, outside, Stephanopoulos asked Clark if any of the testimony inside hurt his Presidential bid. Clark was upbeat but it looked as if he had been punched in the solar plexus by  50 Cent , or gotten "Alec Baldwined" in the most excellent  urlLink Page Six  ( we love you , Page Six).   You done good George , you got us a memorable scene and you asked a hard ass question of a public figure seeking to become Master and Commander of the Universe. In 2004, we promise to go  a bit  easier on you and the "healthy" sex life he enjoys with wifey,  urlLink Alexandra Wentworth .

       Ballet Done Right   I am not a fan of the ballet.  Let me amend that : I am not a fan of  sitting in an audience  and watching -- in two dimensions -- the stage as a ballet troupe athletically presents their program.    urlLink Robert Altamn's latest flic , with, of all people, quirkey Canadian  Neve  ("First off, don't call me  Ne-Vee ")  Campbell  gets it right.  The film adds a third, and of course, fourth dimension to the ballet scenes with the help of  urlLink DP Andrew Dunn , a God of the perfect shot.  Dunn gets camera shots from up in the stage lights, the wings, from behind the stage and he catches the gossamer costumes as well as the elaborate and draining movements.  Altman gets the "social macrocosm" and Neve Campbell is terrific, but the real star here is the camera, and the man behind it:  DP  Andrew Dunn

       Enrique and Kournikova: It's Over   In the beginning was  urlLink the herpes rumor .  During  urlLink Enrique Iglesias's Escape video , rumors flew. But  Enrique Iglesias , like a gentleman, brushed them off, telling UK reporter   Julie Goodhand :  "There are stories about how I wouldn't kiss ( Anna Kournikova ) in the video because she had herpes on her lips. They are all rubbish."  They were indeed, but it appears that now he won't be kissing the Slavic beauty as that significant cultural artifact  urlLink National Enquirer reports that they are no longer an item . Done deal: Finito ... ( The Corsair  makes a 'surfer dude' hand signal) call me Anna (he slowly, earnestly puts his fingers to his ear) ...  call me ?  The singer's PR people refused to answer the Enquirer's questions for the story. ( Actually , I can't blame them on this one)   urlLink The Enquirer  writes, "When Today host  Katie Couric  probed  Enrique Iglesias , 28, on Nov. 25 about his on/off romance with tennis babe  Anna Kournikova , 22, he stammered, 'We're, we're cool.'"  Iglesias seems to not have given up on a  Donald Trumpian  taste for Eas tern European cuisine , if you get the snarky drift. Iglesias went in for a  urlLink Kournikova look-alike  to chase the holiday blues away.  The story continues: "(Iglesias) was recently spotted making out with 25-year-old Croatian model  Monika Jakisic  at a London nightclub. 'Yes, I was with Enrique,' Monika reportedly has admitted. 'He's a lovely man, but I don't want to comment on his personal life.'  'Enquiring" minds want to know.  ... And now they do.

       Most Embarrassing Media Moment   The Kenyan coffee was pipin' hot as to our liking, the  Sunday New York Times  was sprawled underneath my feet and  Howie Kurtz  was interviewing the "shark-eyed"  Sam Donaldson , throaty professional Presidential "advisor"   urlLink David Gergen  and the ever-smiley  urlLink Robin Wright  on  urlLink CNN's Reliable Sources  about something called "Spider Hole Journalism."  All that we needed was  urlLink Smokey to sing for everything to be good in the world  ... tonight .   Anyhoo:  At the end of said convocation of the Beltway Insiders, Zowie Howie relayed that he wants viewers to send in their votes for "The Most Embarrassing Media moment," which suggests that even Howie isn't immune to the charms of  shadenfreude  (do we get spanked for using  urlLink that word ?).    Of course the winner is going to be the  urlLink Camel Filter  poster boy Jayson Blair . But that doesn't mean that  you can't accost Howie  with your own picks. The email is  reliable@cnn.com , and he will read the most soundbytable little morsels on the show. And tell him  The Corsair  sent you.  For my money,  urlLink Paris Hilton beating President George Bush's  interview with Diane Sawyer on Sadaam's capture takes the cake, or  urlLink Iraqi Pomegranate Soup ,  if you will .

       Corrections   Ah, that  fleet of factcheckers  employed by our  private Ugandan coffebean fortune  sometimes misses a factoid. ((Note: this is a one man organization,  my little pomegranates ) Like, we appreciate the time when the very cool  Jon Friedman  of  urlLink CBS.MarketWatch.com  noticed that we misspelled the name of  Sofia Coppola  and the excellent  Chris Bonanos  of  urlLink New York Magazine  emailed that we mistakenly blogged that  Joan Didion  was fired from  Vogue  for negatively reviewing  The Sound of Music  (it was, as Chris noted,  urlLink Pauline Kael )  Hey, if we dish the snark, then we have to be ready to take the lumps when  we muck up . If we have any blaring errors, email me the corrections at  papermag@yahoo.com  . Thank you.

       Tyson vs Snipes   "One night after ( Mike Tyson's  girlfriend)  Hope  had visited MT (Mike Tyson) in his LA apartment, he told me to follow her. She had left earlier than usual, telling him that she had to visit a friend. He wanted me to find out where she went, if she made any calls, if she talked to anybody, everything that she did after leaving him that night. So I grabbed the  black Lamborghini Diablo  and kept a safe distance ... At Roscoes, a soulfood hangout in downtown LA, she parked, got out of the car and walked over to a  black Lexus ... her friend turned out to be actor  Wesley Snipes .  "(Tyson) was paging me. I called him back to let him know the situation ... Less than ten minutes later, he pulled up in a yellow Testarosa, accompanied by a new bodyguard  Anthony Pitts . Anthony was a former professional football player, stood about 6'7, and weighed in around 250. Tyson jumped out of the Ferrari.  "...When Hope caught sight of him, she practically fell out of Snipes lap and onto the floor. The actor froze then waved a hand"'Now, Mike, now, Mike, we can do this together. I dont want no problem.  "'Let's go into the bathroom!' Tyson snapped.  "When I returned from the parking lot, I noticed Anthony was blocking the bathroom door. A couple minutes later we heard a big noise inside, and then Tyson emerged alone.  "After he was gone, I cracked open the bathroom door. Wesley Snipes was sitting against the far wall, head tilted to one side,  unconscious  (italics mine)."   urlLink The Inner Ring , by  Rudy Gonzalez , p.58-9

       Sin-ergy    Peter Biskind's  new book  urlLink Down and Dirty Pictures  is one of the most talked about tomes around. It is a quote machine. In one passage from the book overrated director  Bernardo Bertolucci  says of  Harvey Weinstein , "he started to believe too much in himself as auteur of the film ... He's like a little  Sadaam Hussein  of cinema."  Well, with quotes like that, you know the old Corsair would have to zero in and  extract . Oh, and extract we did. Here's a little tidbit that clarifies the whole embarrassing  Tina Brown Talk Miramax Eisner  fiasco. Dig in:  "On July 1998, (Tina) Brown stunned the media world by 'ankling' The New Yorker in favor of a new venture, a magazine to be published by  Miramax . Talk, as it was to be known, created yet another rift between (Harvey) Weinstein and (Michael)  urlLink Eisner . The Disney chairman had his own relationship with Brown, and he was after her to do something for him.  "The  Tina Brown  hiring was a big problem,' says  urlLink Joe Roth . Michael thought he was a friend of Tina's and Tina kept trying to get Harvey to allow her to let Michael know that this conversation was going on -- which was totally outside the business plan, and had to be approved.  "Harvey called Michael at ten o'clock the night before it was announced. Michael hit the roof. He thought having a movie company and a magazine, especially an expensive magazine, was a conflict, and he was against it. It was very different from the business that these guys had contracted for.' Roth adds,'Harvey was worried that if he had told him earlier, Michael would scuttle it somehow, so he took a chance, and probably sold Tina on the idea that he didn't have to ask permission.' Eisner would have vetoed the deal, and initially he told Harvey,'I'm not gonna let you do it.' In the end, Eisner was reluctant to humiliate Weinstein, who reportedly told him that he would only be in for $5 million. Still, the two men virtually stopped speaking.  " urlLink After losing the Brooklyn Navy Yard as a site for the Talk launch party  when Mayor Giuliani discovered that  urlLink Hillary Clinton , his likely rival in the race to become New York's new Senator, would grace the cover of the inaugural issue, Brown secured Liberty Island instead.  "On August 2.1999 the $200,000-plus, star studded party was held at the foot of the Statue of Liberty, bedecked for the occasion with festive Japanese lanterns. If Harvey wanted to buy his way into the charmed circle of New York's celebrity intellectuals, he succeded beyond his wildest dreams. Everyone who was anybody was there, 1,400 strong, from  urlLink Salman Rushdie , just emerging from his  urlLink fatwa-induced internal exile , to  urlLink Madonna  to  urlLink Henry Kissinger . As the first round of fireworks blossomed over New York harbor in a spectacular display of fiery brilliance,  urlLink George Plimpton  exclaimed, 'This one's for Harvey and Bob Weinstein.'"

       Esquire Lives   Imagine our surprise at finding that  Esquire  did not, in fact, evaporate into an inert gas sometime in the late 90s. No,  it actually is  still  being published.  Not only that, but the January 2004 issue is pretty yummy indeed. It drinks deep from the dish of wit. In their  What I've Learned   section, they manage all manner of fun from everyone including the Sir Edmund Hillary of social climbers,  Lynda Carter  to aging Hollywood swordsman Jack Nicholson . Here's what  urlLink Wonder Woman  had to say:  "This modeling agency I'd gone to was putting on the  Miss USA  contest. Why would I want to run around in a bathing suit? But my mother and sister talked me into it. Three weeks later, I was Miss USA. Didn't even sing. There was no talent: it was all tits and ass."  Well, to each our strong points. And  Jack Black  and  Kyle Gass  turn out this little chestnut:   Kyle : Who we'd like to meet?  Jesus .  Jack : You should say  I  instead of  we . I think Jesus would be a big fuckin letdown. You'd find out he's just a dude. He might be a real boring hang. He might be a really kick ass rabbi. You'd want to know the answer to everything and he'd say, 'How should I know? I'm just Jesus.' Plus you don't know how to speak ancient Aramaic. I say, let's go back to see someone who for sure kicked ass. Let's go fucking chat it up with  Plato .  Kyle : Talk about a language barrier. You're not gonna be knowin any of the Greek. I'd like to meet  Hitler  when he was an artist in Austria. Hang with him. I used to dream about this. I fantasized that I went to art school with the Beatles ...  Jack : Dude, you better finish up that fuckin Hitler thought. You left it on a really wierd note.  Kyle : Oh! I would just be checking Hitler out. Telling him, maybe you should stick with the painting."   Esquire , the gift that keeps on giving.

       Stupid Ass of the Week   "Religious broadcaster," Yale Law School grad and sometime  urlLink faith healer   Pat Robertson , Fox News reports, says that George Bush will win in 2004,  urlLink at least that is what God is telling him .   "'I think George Bush is going to win in a walk,' Robertson said on his '700 Club' program on the Virginia Beach-based  urlLink Christian Broadcasting Network , which he founded. 'I really believe I'm hearing from the Lord it's going to be like a blowout election in 2004. It's shaping up that way.'"   The story continues:  "'The Lord has just blessed him,' Robertson said of Bush. 'I mean, he could make terrible mistakes and comes out of it. It doesn't make any difference what he does, good or bad, God picks him up because he's a man of prayer and God's blessing him.'  "The  Rev. Barry W. Lynn , a frequent Robertson critic and executive director of  urlLink Americans United for Separation of Church and State  said he had a prediction of his own: 'Pat Robertson in 2004 will continue to use his multimillion broadcasting empire to promote George Bush and other Republican candidates.'  And the story concludes:   "In a reference to Bush's political adviser, Lynn said, 'Maybe Pat got a message from  Karl Rove  and thought it was from God."   P.O.V. CBN Networks -- Evening. Pale moonlight illuminates Pat Robertson, deep in prayer.  Male Voice (O.S.): (Waspy accent)  So it looks like Bush will win again in a walk, any problems with that, my faithful servant?  Exquisite joy erupts on the cherubic face of Robertson. A strand of drool leaks from his prayerful lips.   Robertson:  No,  Mr. Gawd , thank you!   Ah, the pleasure of having a gods that shares ones political beliefs.

       Golddigger!   "The Huffington estate in  urlLink Montecito  is one of the most beautiful homes I've ever seen. It sits on ten acres overlooking the Pacific Ocean near Santa Barbara. As Michael was showing me the property, I told him there were two issues of business I wanted to address: the release of his tax information, and the need to repair the damage he'd done in his new hometown. Many longtime Republican activists were openly supporting (Senator Diane)  Feinstein . I suggested he commit the money and organization for a major rehabilitation effort. He said he'd think about it.  "Then there were his tax returns. By refusing to release them, he was vulnerable to Feinstein's charge that he paid no taxes and had, in fact, avoided them by remaining a resident of Texas until he ran for Congress. He told me there was no way he'd ever release them and, in fact, he  couldn't .  "He didn't explain why and I didn't ask, but as we walked across the estate he told me a story. Before he married Arianna, he didn't own a house. He lived in an apartment in Houston and was very happy. After the wedding they'd looked for over a year at more then a hundred homes around Los Angeles and purchased this one for over $4 million.  "'We spent another fortune redoing it,' he said. 'Then I get elected to Congress and  Arianna  needs a house in Washington, so we buy another one for five million. She spends another fortune redoing it.'  "'No one but my accountants and I know how much I am worth. The press has estimated it at seventy to seventy-five million dollars, based on my disclosure forms. That's way low, but it's fine if that's the figure they want to use. It's more like double that amount. If I disclose my taxes, Arianna will figure out how much I am worth and try to spend it all.'  "'Now I understood, and I almost felt something like sympathy for him. Not releasing his tax returns would become an explosive issue, but one that I never raised with him again."

       Saying Goodbye to Sex and the City   "Everybody needs a little time away/ I heard her say,  from each other / Even lovers need a  holiday / Far away  from each other "   Chicago ,  urlLink Hard to Say I'm Sorry   (note:  do not read further  if you are against plot spoilers for Sex and the City's final episodes. Warning: Plot spoiler coming up)   All over the country women will be watching the final Sex and the City episodes, staring Sunday at 9pm. Will Samantha get breast cancer (yes)? Does she beat the breast cancer? Will Carrie get married?   urlLink Jessie Knadler of Star  weighs in:  "An on-set source tells Star that in the second-to-last episode, Big ( Chris Noth , 49) calls Samantha,  Miranda  and  Charlotte  and asks to meet them at the local diner. The source believes Big wants advice on if and how he should pop the question to Carrie, the sex columnist played by  Sarah Jessica Parker , 38. Another clue is served up in a different episode from the upcoming season, which kicks off on Jan. 4, when Charlotte York ( Kristin Davis ) house-sits for Carrie and overhears a message that Mr. Big leaves on Carrie's answering machine, saying, 'I've made this mistake too many times before, and I can't afford to make the same mistake again.' He signs off by saying, 'I love you.' "  The article continues:  " Samantha Jones , the sex-obsessed publicist played by  Kim Cattrall , 47, is diagnosed with breast cancer during the final season. But Star has learned that she beats cancer in the end. And in a future episode, Samantha meets with the heads of a breast cancer awareness organization, who ask her to speak at a function. When she practices a stiff-sounding speech in front of boyfriend Smith Jerrod ( Jason Lewis , 32), he tries to help by telling her that during his stint in AA, he learned to keep it real. Samantha's retort: 'This is not AA. This is PR!'"  I hope that last line isn't indicative of what we can expect.  (soap opra-ish long fade to commercial)

       Tucker Carlson On Fame   "Hardest of all to get used to, though, was the loss of anonymity in public. Working in television is like having your picture in the Post office. People you've never seen before know what you look like.  "I didn't fully comprehend the consequences of this until I flew to Italy for a friends wedding. Thanks to bad weather I wound up spending quite a bit of time in the Paris airport. One beer led to another, and by the time I boarded the flight to Florence, I'd definitely been drinking. I wasn't embarrassingly wino drunk, though I was dirty and unshaven. I was, however, impared enough not to notice that there was a large Moroccan man seated between me and the aisle.  "Not long after takeoff, I had to go to the bathroom fairly desperately. (Savvy travellers, I've since learned, don't drink four liters of beer before getting on airplanes). By this time, the Moroccan guy was asleep, completely passed out and snoring. Rather than wake him I decided to climb over his seat. Stepping from one armrest to the other, I made it successfully.  "I had no such luck on my way back. Years later I convinced myself that the plane had turbulence just as I was standing over the sleeping man. I'll never know for sure. I do know that somehow I lost my balance and wound up falling knees-first into his lap.  "He woke up screaming. I didn't understand the precise meaning of his words, but I got the general point. He yelled in the intercontinental language of pain, fear and confusion. I tried to apologize, but this seemed to make him more agitated.   "He didn't stop shouting until I got off his lap, which wasn't easy. It was a loud moment.  "But not so loud I couldn't hear my own name spoken in a stage whisper from three rows back. It was a group of American tourists. They were staring at me. "That's definitely him," said one. "I saw him on CNN last week."

George (Mactier) specifically hates this passive-aggressive record-o-man.

Nothing like AOL's digital butler, with his fake-enthusiastic utopian-zombie voice.

       Tara Reid Gets All Crunked Up   As  urlLink I, Claudius  began with pagan dancing, let us also begin 2004 in a  somewhat  urlLink Saturnalian  mode. With a  catfight .  You may already have heard of the little  contretemps  between that boozy slice of American Pie,  Tara Reid , and the so-called most downloadable babe,  Cindy Margolis , but I'm  pretty sure  you will want to hear about it again.   That significant cultural artifact the  National Enquirer  feeds our prurience  urlLink thusly :  " ... When the two women met up, witnesses said, Tara made a disparaging remark about (restauranteur Guy)  Starkman  to Cindy -- who flew into a major rage.   "(Margolis) grabbed Tara by her hair and yanked her off her bar stool onto the ground, say witnesses.   ( The Corsair  munches on unsalted pocorn, eyes firmly affixed to computer screen)  "Then the two feuding femmes began scratching, gouging and rolling on the pricey parquet floor while trying to land punches.   "'It was a knock-down-drag-out fight of the type that was never seen in this place.  ( The Corsair  wipes a single bead of sweat from his furrowed brow)  "'... It was horrendous, or beautiful, depending on who you asked.   ( The Corsair  sighs, mouthing the word  beautiful )  "'There was some difference of opinion about the husband of one of the gals, and off they went.   "'They were rolling around on the floor.   "'There was no blood, but there were handfuls of hair left on the floor."   ( The Corsair's  eyes widen)  "In time the two were separated and Cindy was ushered out the back door of the bar.   "The 'judges' at the bar unanimously declared 35-year-old Cindy -- who at 5-foot-7 is two inches taller than featherweight Tara -- the winner. When the smoke finally cleared, slightly red-faced Tara, 28, returned to her stool for more cranberry vodkas. "  Poor Tara. If she had actually  won  the fight, chances are she would still be  getting crunked up  on Vodka and cranberries.  God bless the  urlLink National Enquirer .

       RuPaul's Blog!   Have you ever whatever happened to  RuPaul ? Well, Ru has a  urlLink weblog .  What's that? You don't remember Ru? You never watched the  urlLink Ru Paul Christmas ? The  VH1 Show ?  Crooklyn ? Didn't you see Ru insult funnyman  Milton Berle  and  his adult diapers ?   Ru Paul was a late 90s  phenomenon .   Fast forwards to today, where Ru has a blog.  As of 7:51 Eastern time, here is a part of Ru's New Year message on the  urlLink blog:   "so, in this moment of heightened sensitivity, i wanna take this time to tell all my niggaz, my bitches and all my ol' skool ho's, i love you from the core of my soul, to the bottom of my heart.   "because of the love you gave me, i'll know that i existed."  And on behalf of all the "niggaz, bitches and ol' skool ho's, "happy new year, Ru.

       What's Eating Russell Simmons?   What's Eating  Russell Simmons ? Or rather,  what is Russell Simmons eating?  Plants ...  urlLink lots and lots of plants .   The Corsair  knows all the telltale signs.  I was editor-in-chief at  MacDirectory , and  urlLink reported frequently on Apple's CEO Steve Jobs . Jobs drank so much carrot juice that at one time he appeared to be  turning orange . We had to recalibrate our digital cameras, it was a fiasco (only kidding).  The hip hop herbivore is looking a little ... now I don't want to  offend  anybody here ... these are  powerful toes  I'm stepping on ... and I'm sure many of my readers are veggies as well ... Russ is looking a little  anemic .  A little  urlLink unhealthy .  In the "urban community," it might be phrased as:  urlLink Russ doesn't look  like he's packing "the rib-busting ox-strength."  Seriously, though, keeping it gangsta:  could someone throw some curry oxtail in Russell's algae shake?  Please?

       Jackie, Oh!   "A perfect example of (the glamour of Kennedy power) would be ... the way  Jacqeline Kennedy  acquired the use of the estate she wanted for riding in the hunt country of Virginia. She found a country place and set her heart on it, but the widow who owned it did not want to leave her home, since she had also set her heart on it, years before, and had shared the place with her husband before sharing it with his memories. Mrs. Kennedy called on the then-powerful lawyer  Clark Clifford , who wanted to become ... 'an honorary Kennedy' by doing the will of the family, even down to its most arbitrary whims.  "The first two times Clifford tried to persuade the woman, he was turned down; but Mrs. Kennedy told him to keep trying. Clifford then resorted to what he called his National Security argument: it was the woman's patriotic duty to help the President meet challenges to the nation by giving him a place to relax. This worked. The delighted Mrs. Kennedy sent Clifford a drawing to congratulate him on these ingeneous bullying tactics. (The drawing) shows him striding up to a woman's house with a lawyerly sheaf of documents labelled 'Acts of Exile, Tortures, Lists of Jail.' All very funny, except to the woman."

       My Trio   I suppose  Time Magazine's   Joel Stein  is an  urlLink okay kind of guy . I've never met him. He seems to have a  bit  of a wit, however  dry , for someone who works at  Time Magazine , the world's capitol of gravitas  and all that . In the end, there is nothing wrong with Joel Stein that a robust  multivitamin  couldn't remedy. But what was he thinking when  Trio TV  gave him the  urlLink gig of a lifetime ? I mean, who wants to watch endless hours of  Battle of the Network Stars ?  I mean,  seriously , who even watched Battle of the Network stars back then, when  Telly Savalas  and  Gabe Kaplan  had  juice ? Not  me : and I was ever the hip 6 year old.  Who loves ya, baby ?  Now, If  Laura Zalaznick  of Trio Tv called  The Corsair  tommorrow (call me, Laura, call ...  me  ...) and asked: What low budget high quality shows would you program for Trio TV? Remember, we only have a fraction of the network budgets, but we want high quality. I would say: Laura,  have you ever read my blog? I am all about low budget high quality.    Anyhoo : These are some of my picks:   Dummy .  urlLink Gritty 70s drama  of urban social decline -- thanks,  Ed Koch !  Asshole ! Koch turned NYC into a  Guns n Roses  video, with  Mr. Brownstone  creeping around Central Park in a raincoat with nothing on underneath. Get  this  plot, though, peeps:  LeVar Burton  plays a  deaf  and  dumb  mute who is framed for the death of a prostitute (Kuta Kinte, you are a  framed  man!). But will we get  justice  from the man? Will a young  Paul Sorvino  get him redemption when he cannot even communicate with his client? Or will "Dummy" just become another urban statistic on the Koch street?  Despite the overall bleakness, this a very, very cool social commentary.    Masterpiece Theater: Last of the Mohicans . No, not the cheesy  Michael Mann  MTV video with  Daniel Day Lewis  and  Madeline Stowe  giving florid, overproduced romance.  No , this one was the  real deal .  The French and Indian War , my little pomegranates. Colonial wars involving trappers and Native Americans dressed in coonskin and caribou, muskets at the ready. The Massachusetts Bay Colonizers  and what not . Dodgy alliances, snow and muskets -- we're talking  the French and Indian War,  people , work with me here . The  drama , fo' shizit. For some bizarre reason the Masterpiece Theater programs made in the 70s -- arguably the best programming of all time -- languish in someone's vault,  uncherished  and unsung. American history geek? (raises hand sheepishly)  Present .   Alice:  I've always wondered if this was a  comedy  or a  tragedy , or perhaps that significant 70s artistic construct, the "dramedy."  Single mom who sings Bradway showtunes working to support her kid in Arizona on diner tips.  Fuck ! I'd imagine that singing "There's a New Girl In Town" ought to get those coffee refil tips into the stratosphere out there in  Phoenix . I'm sure the serial killer truck drivers on their way to the Pacific Northwest on one hours sleep, a thermos of coffee, crank and a meat cleaver under the diner stool are really  up  and  around  to hearing broadway medley's at Mel's Diner,  no ? No ...   Better yet , Alice Hyatt, thou repository of standards of the great White Way, stick with Florence "Flo" Castleberry's crafty encomium: a leathery oversexed outlook on truckstop flings and a pipin hot "kiss my grits!" to the cheapskates.   Imagine  if that show were pitched  nowadays . Only  David Lynch  would go with it. Without the laugh track Alice could be an American drama drenched in pathos, like  Dreiser's   Sister Carrie . Take away the laugh track, throw in some creepy Lynchian music, and you've turned a dramedy into  Americana horror . Alice would end up on nthe evening news and Lil Tommy would be shackin up with dingy Vera faster than Mel could re-lard his pork chops. No ...  urlLink Alice doesn't live here anymore .  Don't even get us started on the great  Vic Tayback  banging the pick up bell with his spatula like the true character actor he was. Dating those seedy Phoenix chicks well past their expiration date. Americana horror is the genre. May  Mel Sharples  rest in a  urlLink greasy kind of peace .  Pink  uniforms, ah, Mel, read much  de Beauvoir ?   Rich Man Poor Man:  Observe  Nick Nolte  before the fermented grape robbed him of his marginal looks, then again,  there is charm in Nolte's  urlLink whiskey ravaged grim visage . If Nolte can be a star then so, dammit, can anyone. Earns props for  Teachers , though.  He counts .    Poldark:   This cult British tv series is quite habit forming. Incredible. Just  urlLink incredible . A period piece that is a cross between  Wuthering Heights ,  the Mayor of Casterbridge  and  Le Liaisons Dangereuse . You get sucked in to this costume drama that is one part soap opera and one part high art.   Assorted Good Times episodes:  Come on, you know you had a crush on  Wilona  when you were kid, don't you; or, if you were a girl,  Bookman the janitor  was your  long cold drink of water.   What, you never saw a black man doing a John Wayne impression,  pilgrim ? And you know in your heart Wilona saved  Janet Jackson  from falling down the elevator shaft trying to escape her mom who beat her with a hot iron just before she became Willis' girl, then  Cleo  on Fame, then Ms. deBarge.  The one where Michael gets drunk off some dodgy "health tonic" was a  urlLink classic  ("Get Vita Brite and sleep tonight ...*passes out*). The there was the time Michael joined a gang. Oh, what about the one where Thelma almost married this bigamist Nigerian.  Crazy ! What about that  pimpy  guy "Lennay," who always sold  hot  appliances from out of his coat. So was the episode when James has hypertension. So was ...  hey  ... was this  urlLink a comedy or what ?   Cinema Paradiso . The best work of art on friendship I've ever encountered. A glorious film.   urlLink Fellini's Satyricon . A pagan work. Un-be-fucking-lievable. The Rablasian Fellini walks us through Roman antiquity as imagined crossed with a science fiction movie. There can never be anyone as Felliniesque as Fellini.   The Big Blue Marble:  My favorite show as a kid,  if you must know .   Carl Sagan's Cosmos:   Okay, so in the madcap world of astrophysics  urlLink Sagan's hypotheses are probably all outmoded already . Right? So  what ? So is  Ptolemy's Almagest , and yet I still read it in college. The provocative thinking is worth another looksie. This series was  the bomb ! (looks around sheepishly, then raises hand, "question: who is the  PBS  geek"?)Classics do not get outmoded.    urlLink Chespirito . This show was a mystery to me: Why would a grown Latin man want to go on tv dressed like a bumble bee with a big "CH" affixed to his paunch. Subtitle it and put it on Tri. We'd all like to know what the people on that endless laugh track find so funny.   urlLink Stoned, the Afterschool Special with Scott Baio . "Super Stoned Jack," was the scariest introduction that most of us had to the world of the sweet leaf. If I were  stoned  I would never go out in a row boat. Well, not after seeing this little chestnut. Put it on Trio so we can all laugh at the "reefer madness." Just say  yes.    Fame the TV Series : Why are there not repeats on  VH1  of this show already? When you say low budget and high quality I think ..  right here's where you start paying for it ... with pain ... and sweat . The show of young, artistic people struggling for their moment to shine is about as American as it gets. Whatever happened to that sexy cello player who wouldn't give anyone the time of day,  urlLink Lori Singer .   Cries and Whispers  by  Ingmar Bergman . If Black Stallion is the most beautifully shot film, then this is number two. All natural lighting. Bergman uses a fade to red to seperate scenes, mimicking the inner membrane of our eyelids. About as fucking intense as art can get. And halfway through this film about communication and treachery and time past, Bergman dissolves a reconcilliation scene with a Bach Sarabande in the most mysterious way.    Schoolhouse Rock:   That Figure Eight . Mysterious, melancholy and mathematically instructional. Time will never again be so mundane. A strong influence on  The Corsair's  childhood.   The Black Stallion:  Those fabulous Coppollas! This is perhaps the most beautiful filmed movie ever.   The Gore Vidal-Bill Buckley Debate-Fight  It was in the heart of the 60s: it was the polarized political center of the 60s. The left and the right clash violently  on national television . A  classic . I just finished reading Vidal's Burr.  Excellent .   Woody Allen's Teleplay:  Don't Drink the Water .  One of the most interesting experiments on television ever.  Woody Allen  directs and writes a teleplay starring  Michael J Fox  and the kid who played  Blossom . Shaky handheld camera follows a grown Michael J. Fox as slowly becomes involved with the much younger woman. Sound familiar?   Kramer vs. Kramer.  The first dramatic statement of the Baby Boomers. A film of the first water. Young married couple breaks apart. Wife leaves shallow workaholic husband and baby. Goes out West. Comes back revitalized. Husband fights custody. Bach and Vivaldi heighten drama. And the courtroom scene where Meryl Streep slowly dissolves into tears and forced composure are among the best acting you will ever see.  Okay, so those are some of my Trio picks. And you have to admit it is a hell of a lot better than  Battle of the Network Stars .

       Will Someone Give Bill Murray An Oscar Already?   Oscar is fickle about  urlLink comedians  (unless you, like me, found  William Hurt  in  urlLink Kiss of the Spider Woman  to be inexplicably  hilarious  ... and don't even get me to do my impression of  Daniel Day Louis  in  My Left Foot ... I'll knock over this computer).   Oscar  only  rewards drama, goes the theory ...  Oscar  feels that comedy isn't really acting. Oscar eludes all those who seek him. Oscar believes comedians are too contrived in their performances. Oscar, Oscar, blah blah.  blah . What about  Bill ? What about his oft-spoken of "nuanced irony" (makes bracket gesture with frostbitten fingers)?  Will someone give the Oscar to  Bill Murray  already? His performance in  Sophia Copolla's    Lost In Translation  was the most winning of the year.  Imagine a Best Oscar going to an underplayed performance, a bittersweetly comic performance, gentle man going through the inevitable motions of decline. And Bill Murray -- for lack of Oscar nominations -- is an actor in decline yet at his peak. How better to reward irony than with irony? Give the subtly nuanced rendering of decline a thumbs up, Hollywood.   Denzel Washington's  dirty cop in  Training Day  was the most powerful and full-on, cut all the stops performance in recent years. Septemeber 11th, to a degree, fueled our need for catharsis: a big evil wolfish lead villain exterminated by his own excess. In contrast with that performance, would be wonderful to have Bill Murray's muted Hollywood actor jetlagged in a foreign land win it this time around.   Murray has been snubbed by Oscar before ( The Corsair  shakes his head balefully at man's base nature). The fact that Murray has  never  been nominated and that is a crime. Murray was simultaneously straightforward and emotionally complex in  Rushmore . He created a rich, if conflicted personality in  The Razor's Edge . And Murray was overlooked as the subtle (that word again) but funny cuckolded psychiatrist in  The Mighty Tennenbaum's .   My favorite Bill Murray flic is  Meatballs , which is also the first film I ever saw, so take my suggestion with a grain of salt ("spazz ... spazz ...  urlLink spazz "). There will never be a time quite like the 70s, in Canada, no less. There was an innocence (notwithstanding Murray's very un-PC manhandling of fellow counselor  urlLink Roxanne , played a bit on the butch side, by  urlLink Kate Lynch ).  And for the kids who don't get the ad libbed sex jokes, thereis the cockles-warming relationship between Murray and the affable Chris Makepeace character. That relationship would never happen today as a result of the cynicism arising from the Catholic Church and internet sex fiends. If Bill Murray showed that much interest in a camper nowadays, he's be serving a three year sentence!   Anyhoo : To me, Bill Murray is the coolest man on the planet earth, so there.

       Mike Tyson and Naomi Campbell   "I chauffered  Mike Tyson  and  urlLink Naomi Campbell  around dozens of times during 1987. They were a strange mix. She was very polished, having been raised and educated in London. In her crisp British accent she talked down to Tyson all the time, trying to 'educate' him, correcting his grammar and teaching him manners. She also got him into a designer clothes mentality by taking him on expensive shopping trips in mid-town Manhattan, to expensive boutiques on Madison and Fifth Avenues. Until then, he had been wearing clothes bought at  urlLink AJ Lester's , a sporting goods store in Brooklyn. Naomi Campbell got him into  Gianni Versace , the designer for whom she did most of her modeling work. Later, his wardrobe was almost exclusively made by Versace, including $2,500 sport shirts and $5,000 leather pants. Tyson would shower (Campbell) with very expensive gold and diamond jewelry.  "There were a number of times I picked up Naomi Campbell from Philadelphia International, the closest major airport to Atlantic City. She was on a tight schedule so, instead of having time for a real date, many times I would just chauffer them to Manhattan. This gave them several hours to have sex in the back of the limousine. The movement they generated in the back of the limousine was incredible. Sometimes I thought the car, rocking and rolling, might tip over. Once we arrived at her apartment building, they would say their goodbyes.  "'You know, Mike, if it weren't for the sex, I wouldn't even talk to you,' she seemed to enjoy telling him.'You don't offer me anything else.'  "And Tyson would just laugh. Exhausted from the non-stop sex, MT would sleep all the way back to the Ocean Club."   urlLink The Inner Ring , by  Rudy Gonzalez

       Tyson and Trump   Take  urlLink Alan "Ace" Greenberg , the legendary head of Bear Steans. Alan has always made a great deal of money for everyone, including himself. He is an amazingly streetwise guy with a tremendous intellect. He is a champion bridge player, and that is not by coincidence. Over the years, Alan has called me, because he know I hang out with a number of celebrities. Ace picks up the paper and reads thatI've been out with  Mike Tyson ,  Evander Holyfield , and a host of rock stars, models, and actors. He always tells me that if I were a real friend to these celebrities, I would advise them to save their money, be very conservative and very smart.   "He watched what was happening to Mike Tyson in the newspapers. This was a number of years ago, before Mike Tyson's problems and prison term. Ace saw that Mike's money was going fast and furious, so he called me in order to offer to watch over Mike's money, as he does for so many others, and to ask that I tell Mike to please give him a call. Ace wanted no money for his guardianship; he just felt sorry for the many atheletes and stars who lose all of their money to incompetent or dishonest managers. In the most emphatic terms I asked Mike to contact Ace, but he never called."   Donald Trump ,  urlLink Trump: The Art of the Comeback

       Jailhouse Pen Pals   Maybe it is all the talk of  Mike Tyson  that got me on this little bit of  urlLink incarceration fun .  Ladies, are tired of all the lies and the  cheating ? Let's face it,  Uma Thurman  was right:  all men cheat . But the intellligent lady can better the odds for  fidelity  in her relationship. Do you want to know that your man is where he says he is? Then you are looking to the wrong singles bars for companionship. Just look behind bars  period .  Try a  urlLink jailhouse pen pal . Ladies, I know you can understand the concept. Think of it: a moist Oz-like scenario of your  very own ! Just check out  Manuel Pardo Jr . Inmate Number  111983 :  "I am a 48 year old Spanish male, a former Marine and Nam Veteran. I was a former Police Officer in Miami and took the law in my own hands and ended up on Death Row. I seek a nice and sincere person to correspond with and establish a good friendship."   How can you resist ? This a man who has a keen sense of justice -- he served his country, he served his community. Sure, he probably did some unspeakable crime, but he's on  lockdown, baby pop . He's probably very "mussular," ladies.  And what's best ... you know he isn't two timing you ... at least not with another  woman . And, um, probably not of his own volition ... but that's neither here nor there. He will be faithful, after a fact, in his own special way.  Yes, yes, that whole "Row" thing is a bummer, yes, but at least you know  how  your own little Harlequin novella will end, no? And isn't it romantic, his dying at the hands of an unjust state? It's like a  Bold and the Beautiful  storyline, or, at least, a LifeTime movie starring Nancy McKeon or Meredith Baxter Burney, but this time the woman will not be scorned. The struggle against the cirminal justice system will bring you and your "punk" closer, in your private struggles against "The Man." How romantic.  And  Gentlemen . Don't think I've forgotten you. I have got a  hot one  for you. Meet  Jacqueline de Bruce , inmate number  185345  "residing" in Wetumpka, AL:  "I am a 35 year old African-American female who is submissive to a man. I have full suductive lips and a nice figure. I am looking for a pen pal."  Oh, you had me at "hello." And you know where she is 24/7,  you know , fo shizzle. I'll bet all the guards in Wetumpka, AL are in a tizzy over this eye candy. She's not  slipping out  at night while you are at work, trying to make ends meat (insert  urlLink Good Times  theme song) going to the club with her little friends. When she says she's in the  commisary , you know she's telling you the truth. And she has a nice figure, after a fashion --  or so she says .   Jailhouse love , people. Becauyse it's all about trust; and in this day and age, the only way we can trust, is to be sure that our partners are incarcerated. Jailhouse pen pals:  It's the new black .

       Trials, Trial, Trials ...   Yeah    urlLink A New York Times story by Gretchen Morgensen  soberly reminds us that if we live in an  Age of Shadenfreude , then we need public trials in which to roast those fallen stars to crispy. To wit: America was a nation founded by ambitious lawyers out to throw off the outrageous chains of  tyranny , and today lawyers are just as ambitious, but they are also out to throw off the outrageous claims of  celebrity .  As a result of the legal field's bold maneuverings on the battlefield of 'enquiring minds,'  urlLink TheSmokingGun  has become a household name. Legal eagle NYS Attorney General  urlLink Eliot Spitzer  is the golden boy of the Democratic Party. Please do not get in the space between Spitzer and a tv camera.  You will get squished . It is more dangerous between Spitzer and a network camera crew than in the  urlLink DMZ in North Korea . One can almost forget that  urlLink dodgy campaign money from his dad  in '98.  Almost.    urlLink Court TV  (aka, sotto voce, "the INVESTIGATION channel") is  big  as a result of the new legal chic, but they are evidently not chic enough to hang at  urlLink Plaid's VIP Table , as  urlLink Page Six  reports, "COURT TV correspondent  Beth Karas  and friends being muscled out of their VIP table at Plaid to make room for Met  Mo Vaughn  and company." Sorry, counsel, baseball still trumps the legal field in the USA.  Dates to Keep in Mind,  my little pomergranates : On January 20,  urlLink Martha goes before the court ; on February 4,  urlLink WorldCom's Scott Sullivan  gets to see if Justice is truly blind; In  urlLink October, those rascally Enron execs  get their shot. Then, of course, we cannot forget  Jacko ,  urlLink Kobe ,  Scott Petersen ,  Robert Blake , the  urlLink Bassinger-Baldwin's Beatings and Booze child custody fiasco   (aka, the Battle for  urlLink Ireland ").   Finally , we have professional ambulance chaser  urlLink Raoul Felder , who took time out from his busy schedule writing seriously  urlLink unfunny travel books  with  Jackie Mason  to represent David Guest. Guest himself couldn't make the hearing. "He had to have 20 injections in his head," explained Felder ... although he neglected to mention why the  hypedermic needle  looked ... so  ... odd ... (averted gaze) ... okay, admittedly I went after  a cheap laugh right there: but you  know  I had to say it.  We are  going  to need humor to fortify us against all the legal wranglings that stand between us and  pure, unmitigated shadenfreude .

       Tom Harkin is an 800 lb Gorilla   No, no,  no  ... (fake Georgetown dinner party laugh, sips glass of Madeira) ... Iowa's Senator is not  literally  an 800 lb gorilla,  god almighty :  urlLink but what he  is  is incredibly influential within the party . As the joke goes -- what do you give an 800 lb gorilla. Answer:  anything he wants .  And that is how  urlLink Senator Harkin  is being treated by those slaphappy Democratic hopefulls. Everyone wants that big fat juicy Harkin endorsement-- it's hotter than  urlLink Mare Winningham  in ... in ... it's hotter than Mare Winningham in ...  strike  that ...  Mare Winningham  was never hot in  anything  except,  maybe , a  cardigan .   Anyhoo :  In Iowa, the Senator isn't  God ;  God  quite frankly just doesn't have Harkin's positive public opinion numbers.  (makes repentant gesture, sips gingerly from tumbler of  Cutty Sark , begins to blog again)  But in the  end  there are only two contenders that the Senator is wrestling with according to  urlLink Carl Hulse's article in the Old Grey Lady . Is it going to be the surging  Dean  or is it going to be his old comrade  Dick Gephardt ?  If Harkin picks Dean, it will be a massive bitchslap heard round the nation, for no one --  no one  -- has done more over the past 20 years for the farmer, the manual laborer and the midwestern union member than  Dick Gephardt .  But Harkin has to ask himself:  haven't we been down this road before ? And yes, indeed he has:  often . As often as  Tara Reid  has crawled across a dirty barroom floor in search of The Porcelain God. Gephardt has made mistakes over the years and has never been able to fully realize the weight of the Iowa endorsement. He makes the catch, as he has in the past, and then he fumbles.  Dean's campaign is a  phenomenon  and Harkin knows it -- he sees the  futurity  of Dean and the internet progressives:  "'It has been impressive what he has done,'" said Mr. Harkin, who invoked a late friend and fellow liberal in the Senate.'Paul Wellstone and I always knew that if we continue to compete with the Republicans for the same shrinking pool of voters, we will lose. We have to expand that pool and Dean is doing that.'"   Carl Hulse's  article doesn't leave us any closer to  knowing  who will get the endorsement, but it gets you hungry for the big day ... Okay, so maybe  I'm  the only one hungry about this. (looks around the room for support)   Whatever .

       It's Gwynnie Time    urlLink Gawker's  very cool  Choire Sicha  is ahead of the curve once again, starting the media pile up on everyone's favorite frosty blond,  Gwyneth Paltrow  (well, that's my prediction anyway), by just  kind of leaving  a rather provocative quote on the site to go uncommented upon.  Well (pulls up a chair),  let's  do some commentary,  n'est-ce pas ?  Gawker references  urlLink The Washington Post , which basically says that ... people (whistle, averts gaze) ...  people  are resentful of her success. (whistles nervously and looks around):  "[I] don't care if I'm not Number 1 or Number 5 or Number 10. I'm really [expletive] good at my job, and people who are interesting and good know that, and that's all that matters."    Hmm . And just when I thought the  Vanity Fair  blonde (and how many blonde's will Graydon put on the cover in 2004, one wonders, first  Viggo , now Gwynnie -- who's next,  urlLink Eve ? No, no ... Somehow ... ah?...  no ) covergirl was telling tales out of school, I realized, hey ... Gwyneth is just following the precepts of her alma mater,  The Spence School ! Charmed, I'm sure.   Check out  the mission of that infamous incubator of frosty Manhattan blondes who wouldn't give you the time of day back in the day (maybe that was just  me  at the UN School missing out on the frosty blonde sensation, perhaps?), the elite, the posh  urlLink Spence School :   " urlLink Spence  is a small supportive community where the contributions of every student are valued. Each student is challenged to reach her full potential in an atmosphere that fosters self-confidence and a spirit of cooperation. From the Library Media Center to the office of the College Counselor, students at all levels receive individual attention and are encouraged to develop their unique talents and to become independent thinkers."  So no -- It's not about the crappy film  urlLink Plath , my little pomegranates, it's not even really about the seriously sucky performance in  urlLink Duets , it's all about Gwynnie's  potential  being filled. You know the benjamins, the baby, the VF cover: you go Gwynnie ... you exhaust that Spence potential:  gimme a G!  (no,  really , Gwynnie, a G-note would really go a long way in  Cutty Sarks )  Now you know; you better  recognize . Basta!

       Katherine Harris Wants It ... And She Wants It Bad   The cosmetically-challenged former realtor and Florida Secretary of State as well as the current Congresswoman from the 13th District of Florida,  urlLink Katherine Harris , wants retiring Senator (and Vice Presidential piner)  urlLink Bob Graham's  seat (no pun intended). She wants it  urlLink so bad .  The former  realtor  married a rich sugardaddy, businessman  Anders Ebbeson  and by December 1999 listed her net worth as more than $6.5 million. I'll just let that sentence percolate in the blogosphere for a moment.  Ahh .    Anyhoo : All the way in New York City I can feel the burning embers of her smouldering ambition. The former realtor wants a career upgrade ... like,  now ! Then again, to be fair, the American Senate has always been made up of such  busywork of the ambitious  on their way onto the pages of history.  I mean  urlLink who else  could plausibly turn a backwater position like the Secretary of the State of Florida into a Congressional seat, then a credible Senate run  within just 4 years  --  fucking  amazing! ---  against  the wishes of the president she so  hastily  put into power feuled by an ambition that makes  urlLink Livia Drusilla  look like the  urlLink civilian women who have given their lives in the Iraqi conflict . And we won't even talk about the  urlLink voter rolls in Florida  ... that would be naive ... pedestrian even ... why bring such  outmoded moralities  up to a woman so strong in Machiavellian  urlLink virtu and fortuna , with, better yet, a  steady  hand in negotiating that rickety social ladder that is our nation's capitol. Harris is the Sir Edmund Hillary of social climbers.  And such  luck ! Her  fortuna  is indeed  formidable ! Her position as Secretary of State was largely ceremonial -- she pretty much looked after cultural institions and public papers while in office -- and it was about to be abolished when she finished her term, in 2003. That might explain how manic she looked with  urlLink that pen   signing  over the election to the President,  no Supreme Court  (why should  they  get the glory?), just Katherine -- just ...  Katherine .    Of course, ultimately the Supreme Court made the final call.  Imagine the cheek .  The Supreme Court  deemed to supplant the role of Kathy and her nimble, overfast and  mighty  pen!   Granted , Bob Graham's double-barrelled lock on the Dems Veep slot and his  shameless  campaign for that position is  legendary  (what the fuck is it about Florida? Is it the  citrus  combined with the  tropical heat  that  feuls such  caustic  ambition in it's inhabitants?). But Katherine Harris' lust for power is unprecedented in scope in that it flies in the face of a Presidential  urlLink no .   Actually ...  more than a no : The New York Times reported that  urlLink The White House advisors   shuddered . And, let me tells you, my little pomegranates, it takes a whole truckload of moxy to make  urlLink Karl Rove  do a  heebie jeebie dance .   And you can tell from the President's Immigration speech, that he, unlike Clinton,  does not  play politics with votes. In that vain, Bush hand picked  urlLink HUD Secretary Martinez to fetch that errant Florida Senate seat , and he looked like he would win.  Until now . Everything was stable,  solid  even, until someone invited Katherine Harris' fucking ambition into the room. Then everything went  urlLink Mariah .  Harris is, to put it mildly, a  lightening rod . She is the  urlLink Platonic eidos  of polarization. Her candidacy -- should she win the spot -- would electrify the pro-Dean anti-Bushites, the African Americans who were excluded from the voter rolls, the Jewish voters who somehow cast their lots with  urlLink anti-Semite Pat Buchanan , and the  urlLink Al Gore crew .  Katherine Harris would probably tear this country apart if it meant she could rise one step higher on the social ladder.  The Corsair  deems her dangerous (puffs out his chest and struts around the blogosphere acting all moral, imagining himself a To m Paine  and what not)!  My guess is that the Bushies will offer her royal citrus an ambassadorship to some place ritzy (we hear she likes Madrid and Geneva, although a nice South American  vaca-ambassadorship  might help her in future Sunshine State elections  con  the latino vote) so she will be out of their hair. If not, look for another ultra-polarizing election season.  What ever

       Richard Johnson at 50   Our favorite Capricorn,  Richard Johnson , editor of  urlLink Page Six , is celebrating the big 50 January 15th.    The Corsair  can still remember the first time he met Richard at  Elaine's . It was at a dinner being given by that most excellent Greek millionaire  Taki Theodoropoulos , for, of all people, former weapons inspector and internet child predator,  Scott Ritter  (that's actually my fault and it's a long story best saved for another time).   Some foolish guest actually  didn't know  who Richard was, and before he could answer I answered for him, instinctively, with some wonder in my voice, "That's  Richard Johnson ." Nods were then exchanged between he and I. He's old school like that.  We have exchanged emails since then and I made an appearance as a boldfaced name in Page Six once. It was a swishy achievement. I didn't even know until early in the morning a close friend woke me up screaming at me over the phone, "Ron! You're in Page Six!!" And so I was.   urlLink So, Richard is turning 50 . What can one give to the man who has everything? Keep on keeping on, Richard. Page Six is the most important purveyor of entertainment news and the herald of the Age of Shadenfreude. And those successes depend entirely upon you and your merry band of Sixers.

       Musto's Blind Item Bonanza   All over New York people are trying to decode the brilliant  Michael Musto's  spectacular  urlLink blind item feast for gossip hungry eyes . Even Oedipus Rex couldn't solve some of these cryptic riddles, but that doesn't make them any less intriguing or entertaining.  Like this:  "Which scandal lady broke up with that incendiary actor partly because he was desperate to have group scenes involving him, her, and hookers, who he wanted to ram dildos up his ..."  Would that be  Heidi Fleiss  and  Tom Sizemore ? I don't know. But I'm hooked on Musto's phonics.  More:  "Which mega-entertainer slept with that music mogul along the way, thus guaranteeing a much needed early career boost?"  Who would that be?  Pink  and  LA Reid ?  Whitney  and  Clive Davis ?  Michael Jackson  and  David Geffen ?  Damon Dash  and  Beyonce ?  Enquiring minds want to know. But then again, we realize why  we can't . If Michael Musto actually filled in the blanks for us, aside from depriving us of many hours of fun, he would get into trouble with all the stars and their publicists and their lawyers.  And we need our weekly dose of Musto.

       How Much Does George Will Suck?   Oh lord, does  urlLink George Will  suck. (raises his hands to the heavens and becons into the sky) It's that  pedantic  tone, that weak chin, those geeky spectacles, the endless hours of television and inky  moralizing , that haircut just asking for a mussing -- where does  urlLink one begin ?  And where does it end? The icahbod crane-like torso, the boorish references to  Hegel  and  Plato  in 750 word columns. (averted gaze)  The greatest mistake anyone could make in this age is to set themselves up in this society as the public scold, the  moralizer in chief . Ask Bill Bennett. It never works. Sure you make a lot of money at the outset ... but the shadenfreude factor is impossibly high. Our historical lust for a Puritainical archetype is almost as strong as the natural desire in democracy to level such an ass.   So when  George Will  went out of his way to defend  Lord Conrad Black , without even simply disclosing  urlLink his financial relationship to his benefactor , all sorts of red lights went off. And George Will got bitchslapped.  And rightly so .  "My business is my business. Got it?" said Georgie to The New York Times when asked why he didn't talk about the thousands of Black dollars padding his bank account. $25,000 for a day of conversation the board of advisers for Hollinger International  urlLink is high by anyone's accounts .

       Tim Robbins Vs. Tucker Carlson?   In this month's  urlLink InStyle Magazine , tough guy lefty  Tim Robbins  does his best to appear all lighthearted and superficial. I mean, what better place to look vapid and harmless than in InStyle, which features, among other things, serious discussion about "Cindy Crawford's smouldering glam eye makeup" and "Colorful Yoga Bags." What the fuck?!  Anyhoo: The Timster almost pulls it off.  Almost . The thimble deep magazine has the timerity to asks him about bowties ... and something goes horribly awry. Never ask Tim Robbins about bowties. He gets  emotional . Gauntlets are thrown. See for yourself:   Tim Robbins : Bowties are for waiters  Robin Sayers : That's not what (Crossfire's) Tucker Carlson thinks.  Tim Robbins :  Tucker Carlson  can kiss my ass.

       More Predictions   Before this year  really  gets under way, let me fire off some more predictions on the record:   Howard Stern  will not renew his radio contract. Instead, he will become CBS'  Barbara Walters , doing interviews with treain wrecks, like, say,  Heidi Fleiss  or  Paris Hilton . The CBS Entertainment division will pay the subjects a la "checkbook journalism." The show will come on periodically, called "Howard Stern Interviews ..."  The infamously clumsy  Will Smith  will memorably trip and fall down at The Oscars.   Sarah Jessica Parker  will get an Oprah-like syndicated talk show aimed at the hip young woman. The show will feature and be supported inordinately by the fashion houses.   P Diddy  will run for NY mayor as an independent and  Russell Simmons  will signal a willingness to run as an independent for Governor, staring off a new volley of  urlLink celebrity politicians .  Pakistani leader  Musharraf  will be assasinated.  Osama Bin Laden  will make Pakistan the next frontier in the US War on Terror. India will become our new close ally in the war. As a result, Indian fashion, food and music will undergo a rennaisance in the US just as British culture did immediately following 9-11. India comes into its own in 2004.   Justin Timberlake  will marry  Cameron Diaz  and  Al Greene  will perform the cermony as well as sing.   Tony Blair  will be forced to step down. Britain will face a year of upheval as  Prince Charles  declines the crown amid scandal over Diana's death, making way for William to become King.  We will all be quoting lines from  Donald Trump's   urlLink Apprentice  show for much of the early part of 2004.   Alec Baldwin  and  Richard Johnson  will fight -- celebrity boxing style -- in a charity event benefitting Breast Cancer. The Page Six editor will clean The Bloviator's clock. And  urlLink the Bassinger-Baldwin divorce  will become the latest acrimonious slice o shadenfreude to clutter the media landscape.   urlLink Giselle Bundchen  will dump  Leo  for  Ashton .

       60 Minutes versus The New York Times   What happens when an irresistable force meets an immovable object? And,  no , I am not talking about  Tara Reid  at  last call  either, smartypants.   Well, the cornerstone of television magazine journalism,  60 Minutes , is going up against the most respected newspaper in the world, that old grey lady,  The New York Times , whose petticoats have been ruffled as of late, by one randy reporter, one  Jayson Blair .    Now, as if that isn't a  battle royale  in and of itself -- 60 Minutes versus The Old Gray Lady -- throw in  Michael Jackson , arguably the centerpiece of the biggest celebrity scandal in the world. Everyone's favorite freak of the week. Now we're talking  rasslin . Someone pull  Vince McMahon  from his hairdresser.  This megabattle all has to do with the blurring of the lines of news and entertainment (a practice in which I, as a blogger, am enthusiastically engaged). It is considered louche -- no, strike that  unethical  -- for a journo to  pay  for an interview. To be goddam frank here (and when am I not? when am I franchesca?) This is a real  3am in the morning C-Span kind of distinction  (hey, don't look at me that way, I ran out of   urlLink Nyquil ).   I mean, in the grand scheme of things, does it really matter if a news organization pays for an interview, so long as the content of the interview is accurate and compelling?  Fuck (puffs out chest and acts self important as he discourses on media ethics).  So, in keeping in that  sacred  Rembrandtian light,  urlLink Don Hewett , the patron saint of "journalism" has said of that December article by NY Times reporter  urlLink Sharon Waxman , in an article by  urlLink USA Today reported Peter Johnson :  '''I can tell you categorically that we at 60 Minutes did not pay Michael Jackson one cent.' Asked if another CBS division paid Jackson -- which is what the Times alleged -- Hewitt responded, 'Was the deal sweetened? To the best of my knowledge, it was not.'''   Translation : Another CBS division possibly-probably made some sort of payment or "benefit" to Jacko to talk about feces covered jailhouse bathrooms on national tv. But Saint Hewett didn't know about it, so he is  still  on the road to canonization. Nice covering your ass, Donnie boy.  Anyhoo:  urlLink Peter Johnson's  story continues:  "CBS chief  Leslie Moonves , who oversees both the entertainment and news divisions, did not return a phone call Monday. Hewitt's boss, CBS News president  Andrew Heyward , referred a reporter to an earlier statement by CBS that the network does not pay for interviews."  You can see the network suits scrambling to cover themselves.  Note the echo of the cloven hoofs as they traipse across the media landscape!  The story goes further:  "The Times said Monday it stands by the Dec. 30 article by reporter  Sharon Waxman . 'Our story was balanced and accurate,' spokesman  Toby Usnik  said. 'CBS' position was set out fully.' Waxman could not be reached but has said that her reporting was accurate.  "Waxman's story, that Jackson was paid by CBS Entertainment and not 60 Minutes, thereby allowing CBS News to maintain it does not pay for interviews, prompted intense criticism of the network."  Okay, now that that's settled,  urlLink Fox News  gets into the mix in the form of that jolly gossiper  Roger Friedman .  urlLink Page Six calls it the first media feud  of the new year! Friedman writes in his December 30 column:  "It must have been exhausting for the New York Times' Sharon Waxman to write her Michael Jackson story published in Tuesday's issue.   "This required reading all of our columns about the Nation of Islam's influence over Jackson and then reconfiguring them to seem like they were new."    Ouch . If this were the eighteenth century, that would be like smacking her in the face with an ermine glove and demanding satisfaction. That would be like spilling Tara Reid's vodka and cranberry drink. Anyway,  The Corsair  will keep you updated.

       The Zenith of the 80s   "Riding his bike in the pouring rain to a delightful uptown (DC) dinner party, ( Emilio Estevez ) presses his soaked nose to the windowpane, sucking in every inch of ( Andy McDowell's ) coltish beauty. Unable to restrain himself, he crashes the do, squelches in and approaches (her). She turns and drawls, 'How are yew?' His agonized reply: 'I'm obsessed, thank you very much.'    urlLink Figuring she's the kind of gal  who's turned on by a high roller, he uses the home of the Korean lobbyist he's working for to throw a loud, lurid party in her honor. When she fails to show, he tracks her all the way to a ski lodge where she's, of course, weekending with a concerned medic. She tries to let him down gently, saying she's flattered, whereupon he grabs her and lays a big deep sucking kiss on her.    "This has the effect of transferring his infatuation. She's left shivering in the snow, her womanhood awakened. He speeds off whooping and punching the air in triumph."   Jonathan Bernstein ,  urlLink Pretty in Pink .

       What About Nicole Kidman?   Here's an  interesting  interview of  Lenny Kravitz , the hypocrite playa and  fragrant  rocker, done by one  Knox Robinson  in the book  The Black Experience in Rock and Roll.  It goes:  "I've always done what's honest, what's real to me. I've never tried to follow something to have success. And I guess that can be tempting, you know. With artists sometimes being forced to think ' well this is happening right now, I kind of better go that way.' But no, I guess I've always done what I felt. I've never wanted to follow anything; I just wanted to express myself."

       A Vanity Fair at Le Cirque   Everyone's favorite follicle-challenged short fingered vulgarian has an interesting story in his book  urlLink Trump: The Art of the Comeback , which could just as easily have been called the art of the  urlLink weave .   Anyhoo : The Donald sayeth:  One of my most interesting Mar-a-Lago experiences involved the turmoil over  Michael Jackson  and  Lisa Marie Presley . Michael was a friend of mine and a very good guy-- but very different. It began in New York, when I got a call from him one day, saying he would be coming to the city and would like to get together. He often called to say hello when he came to New York. This time I invited him out to Le Cirque, one of the great restaurants of New York, headed by a master, Siro Maccioni. (Michael) was very nervous about going to a restaurant; in fact, he said, he hadn't been to a restaurant in years. I found this hard to believe, but after we arrived, I could see it was true.  "This was in the early 90s, at the height of the Michael Jackson madness, and I don't believe I have ever seen a star as hot as Michael was at that time. When Michael, Marla, and I walked into Le Cirque, some of the biggest people in the universe were seated having dinner. These people who have seen it all. They are rich, they are spoiled and they are snooty. I will never forget as Michael sat down in his red military outfit with a large black hat and picked up the menu. It was as if he had never seen a menu before, and we carefully went over each item. But what was most amazing were the looks on the faces of the most distinguished people in the room as they came over to our table practically begging for an autograph.  "These are people who have never asked for anyones autograph before and I can guarantee you, it was not easy for them to do. They would always start by saying, I have a son who is abig fan of yours, Mr. Jackson. Could you give him an autograph? But I believe it was for them, not their sons. One woman, one of the most socially prominent women in New York, known for her attitude, approached our table, trying to look cool, then slightly tripped. She grabbed the table for support and asked in the same breath, 'Mr.Jackson can I have your autograph?' It was amazing to see this woman, who I have known for years, so flustered and nervous."

       Jason Allen Alexander's 15 Minutes     Jason Allen Alexander  and  Britney Jean  have filed for an annullment, and the guys at the  urlLink Smoking Gun , as usual, have  urlLink the documents  if you just kind of wait for them to get it out.  According to the files, there will be "no community property to divide." The document is an extant work of that most postmodernist of enterprises,  the law . My favorite line, crafted with legal cunning and a tenderness for the language of love, is 16 on Page 2, which goeth:  "Pursuant to NRS 125.350 there was no meeting of the minds in entering into the marriage contract and in a court of equality there is cause for declaring the contract void."  No, here  there was probably no meeting of the minds .   Anyhoo , Little Miss Upchuck was probably  sloshed , as her signature on the Marriage  urlLink license suggests . Or maybe she just wanted to  urlLink boost record sales  in this end-of-year start-of-new-year  urlLink slow news cycle .  What ever .

       An Open Letter to Rapper-Actors   Fellow sculptors of the spoken word lend me your ears:  Last Sunday,  urlLink MC Lyte  told interviewer  urlLink James Brown , "I wish I could write the committee that gives these rappers tv shows and tell them to stop it ... (the rappers) are horrible!"  A  urlLink dis , to be sure. But  she has a point . You guys -- rapper/actors -- have problems with  emoting . I understand the bind; one cannot show ones true feelings on the screen in public. Emotions signify vulnerability and weakness -- and weakness, in Bed Sty, means  you lose cred , which means, unfortunately, you lose listeners and fans.  As a result of these enforced masks, rapper-actors -- on tv and in the movies -- turn in one dimensional performances that range from the  urlLink rage infused sneer of Ice Cube  to, er, the  urlLink rage infused staredown of Ice T . No one wants to spend ten bucks looking at an infomercial on how cool the actor is ... well, nix  that  ... but no one will respect that persona as an actor.  Neither awards nor critical acclaim will be forthcoming .  Then there is the cocky  urlLink LL Cool J smirk . And what else? What other moods and emotional nuances are portrayed by the rapper actors?  Granted,  Will Smith  was never  Jay Z , but he has  signalled  his desire to show the full range of emotions necessary to become an A-List actor, even if it meant starring as a  urlLink vulnerable young con man with identity issues . I won't talk about  urlLink Bagger Vance  ... ( yessum , weeza all trying ta' fuget about Bagga Vance 'roun these here parts!).   You see my point?  Ice T  revolves around the limited roles of cop and thug, while  Ice Cube  eternally plays the street tough guy --  himself , essentially-- in situations,  odd  situations, with anacondas, or in the Persian Gulf, or some such abomination. And  urlLink LL Cool J  is, well,  LL Cool J . What can one say about LL?  urlLink Rollerball ?  urlLink Toys ?!  His best role was in  urlLink Charlie's Angels , where he remains  silent .   Then there is  Master G ,  Method Man ,  Redman  and the rest of the up and comers, moving up the entertainment food chain -- as well they should -- from slinging CD's to gracing the screen. Even  urlLink Method Man has talked about the limits of rapper actors , saying at a taping of the MTV Awards last year, "We're not Will Smiths yet."   No, you guys aren't ... but the first step would be to broaden your horizons and stop limiting your performances. The colors of emotion that can be rendered in a performance -- whether in acting on screen or even in a blog -- are limited only by the imagination.  I look forward to seeing  Ice T  playing the role of a developmentally disabled man going up against poverty in a remote New England town in an indie flic. I do ... I  really  really do.

       Bindi Irwin: The Other "White Meat"   Everyone knows that  The Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin  and his wife,  Terry , live an, uhm,  unconventional  life. The two jet-setting  extreme wildlife  enthusiasts -- staples of  Animal Planet  -- spend their lives wrestling and documenting the lives of all creatures great and small.  But the recent flare up over Steve's  urlLink dangling his infant newborn, Bob , is a bit much by even the standards of his fans. But the bizarre comments by Terry, who called their daughter,  urlLink Bindi  (incidentally, who was named after Steve's favorite Croc) have started a whole new round of headscratching. I mean, doesn't he have his work cut out for him what with rehabilitating the bad image of the tasty  urlLink civet cat ?   urlLink Australia's News.Com.Au reports :  "Irwin and his wife Terri stunned zoo visitors again yesterday when they called their five-year-old daughter Bindi 'white meat' during a live show."  "Bindi was told by her parents to enter a new enclosure, which adjoins a crocodile pen, and splash around to encourage the reptiles to swim out. A gate connecting the pool to the croc pen was closed during the show.   "Mum Terri then said: 'Now flail around and look helpless, that's the girl, good girl.   "'That's my girl Bindi Irwin, the other white meat.'"   Hardly a mouthful for a hungry croc, little Bindi seems to be taking it all in stride.   Frankly,  The Corsair  had thought Steve would be eaten by a feral pig before his image was tarnished, but, then,  didn't you know something like this would happen to an unconventional couple in this age of shadenfreude ? Weirdness is a felony these days.  Just wait till the media gets a hold of  urlLink David Lynch  and  urlLink Johnny Depp  and lawn urinator  urlLink Farah Fawcett !   urlLink Nude body painting freak  terrorizes Gotham ... wait till they get a load a  me !

       Olivia Goldsmith, RIP   "'I don't have any drugs here, not even grass!' the girl protested. Then she stepped from behind the door, though she was still in the shadow. All Sylvie could see was that she was wearing a tiny robe in some cheesy material that clung.  It was white with little roses on itand showed a lot of leg. Sylvie could see her legs were good, even though her feet were stuffed into big terry cloth slippers. M. Molensky took a step and then another out of the comparative darkness of the corner by the door. Then Sylvie saw her face, while the girl, for the first time, lifted her head up and looked directly at Sylvie. For a long moment they stared at each other, face to face.  "'My god' Sylvie gasped. She was staring at her own face -- but not. It was her face as it looked a decade ago. The same wide forehead, the same even brows, the same blue eyes -- even though M. Molensky's might be a darker blue. But the shape was the same. The only difference was the ten years of wrinkles missing on the girl's face. Sylvie stared at M. Molensky's nose. It was Sylvie's nose, straight and long, narrowing in the middle just a little before the nostrils flared. But again, though the nose replicated her own, the girl was missing the line that, on Sylvie's own face, ran from the outside of each nostril to the outside of her mouth. 'Marionette lines' Sylvie suddenly remembered they were called.  "And their mouths! Sylvie felt hers pucker into an O of surprise as she watched M. Molensky's do the same. It was the eeriest feeling Sylvie ever experienced, like watching herself in a mirror -- but a mirror from ten years ago. They stared at one another, wordless and horrified. M. Molensky was seeing what she would become, and Sylvie was seeing what she had been. Sylvie stared at the girl's chin. Yes, she had once had a jaw that taut, a chin that smooth. It hadn't been so long ago. But time and gravity had softened everything. Instinctively, Sylvie had moved her hands to either side of her face and, resting them against her cheeks and temples, she stretched the sagging skin up, giving herself a momentary face-lift. At the same time, her twin opposite raised her own eyes and dragged her cheeks down. Bob, his betrayal and her rage flew out of her mind. All she could see was the work of Father Time. She looked not at what she had, but what she had lost.   "The younger woman's eyes mirrored her own horror. In their blue depths Sylvie could see a fear as acute as the one she was experiencing. Why? Here was a girl who still had her youth and beauty. A girl, Sylvie suddenly remembered, who also has my husband, at least part time. Yet, looking at her, it was obvious that she was a sshocked and horrified as Sylvie. 'I looked like you once,' Sylvie whispered. 'Just like you,'"   urlLink Switcheroo , by  Olivia Goldsmith ,   urlLink who died yesterday night  (via Gawker), after a facelift to remove skin under her neck went wrong.

       He Pushed Her!   "Women like  Pat Buckley  tended to approach dressing as a business. Strip down to their bras and pantyhose and stand there smoking a cigarette. Pat just loved being in her pantyhose and bra.One day in the middle of a fitting, I , who was Anne Klein's husband, came by and I stuck my head out to say, 'hi, Chip.' Mrs. Buckley, naturally, wanted to know who Chip was, and I said, 'you don't know him.' And dressed like that she went to the door and said, 'hi, Chip.' A provocateur.  "... I've never had as much fun with anyone in my life as I've had with Mrs. Buckley. In the first place, she makes fun of herself, which is the best kind of humor. But also, funny things happen to her that just don't happen to other people. I was in a stretch limo with her once, and as I turned to help her out -- she came out on all fours. She said, 'I can't stand up in here. So I have to come out this way.' I took her to the first Reagan inaugural;  Bill Buckley  was there too. We went to a party that  Nancy Whitehead  was giving and as we stood in the coat line, I noticed that Pat had suddenly vanished. I got up to the hat check, and there she was. She had fallen behind the counter.   "I said, 'what in the world ...'  "'He pushed me!'  "I turned around. It was  Bill Simon , the secretary of defense."   urlLink Bare Blass , by  Bill Blass

       The Discreet Charm of East Sussex   East Sussex, baby, in the UK. That significant cultural artifact  urlLink Star Magazine  reports, "We already knew  Johnny Depp  was a Francophile, and now it's safe to call him an Anglophile too. Depp, 41, fell for a $4.7 million Georgian estate in picturesque Rye, East Sussex, during a trip to the U.K. in May, says a source." urlLink The Mirror  reported on July 9th, "SEEMS Johnny Depp isn't the only celeb to have fallen in love with the picturesque village of Rye in East Sussex. "The Pirates Of The Caribbean star recently bought a house there and now we hear Brad Pitt and wife Jennifer Aniston are looking for a property there too. "Our agent tells us: 'It's a beautiful place and perfect for a couple looking to relax and get away from it all.'"The Corsair counts the minutes until the New York Times is writing a story on East Sussex, thereby officially signalling the end of that celeb trend.

       AOL Diva    Rebecca Lieb  of  urlLink Internet.com  is reporting that AOL's recently axed ad sales executive vice president, the Diva-like  Lisa Brown , left her job, in part, over  secret audio tapes  of her erratic behavior at AOL meetings (*cue  007  music*).  Lieb writes:  "(Internet.com) obtained audiotapes of two meetings conducted by recently departed ad sales EVP  Lisa Brown . In them, she repeatedly launches into obscenity-laced tirades, personally insults senior executives in her group, and at one point, pounds her shoe on the table, Khrushchev-style, when a creative director from a longtime AOL vendor speaks out of turn."   Khrushchev-style , huh? Funny. Maybe she just wanted attention, like  urlLink Vivika Fox . Apparently, though, the secret taping began when the  increasingly erratic Bad Bad   Brown (meaner than a junkyard dog) began contradicting instructions  she herself  laid out at staff meetings,  thoroughly  confusing the staff.   A letter accompanied the tapes, Lieb writes, which:  " ... complains Brown unapologetically showed up for meetings up to two and a half hours late, and complains, 'The general tenor of her behavior is filtering throughout the company. She... makes working within IM [interactive marketing] a nightmare for so many people it really needs to be dealt with.... If we lose the very very fine talents of the currently exasperated, it will be a damn shame.'"  Lieb continues:  "When the  Wall Street Journal  broke the story of Brown's departure, after only a handful of months with the company, last week, stating an 'aggressive management style soon rubbed some subordinates the wrong way,' the ad sales staff was jubilant. 'Ding-dong, the witch is dead,' crowed an IM sent from AOL's New York offices that morning."  Where's the love AOL? Where's-the- love ?      Very  erratic.

       President Al Sharpton: The First Few Days   As you can see, the progressive buildup to the Iowa caucus has thrown me off my usually sophisticated pop-culturally obsessed game, and gotten me all  sexed up  on  politics .  Blame Iowa ! Bear with me, though,  my little pomegranates , I  will  come out of this little poly-sci funk intact and, on the other side of the caucus, back in rare form.  My  fascination du jour , though, if you must know, is the  urlLink Reverend Al Sharpton .   And why not : His campaign is quixotic, to be sure, but there is also quite a bit of  pathos  and some, well,  humor  in it.   Actually, there is lots of humor in his candidacy if you know  how  to look. Sharpton has come away -- post  SNL  -- as a sort of  Falstaffian  American character (charicature?), more perfectly suited to  Comedy Central  than the rigors of the campaign trail. Perhaps he might consider following  Jon Stewart , or a late night show on  VH1  opposite  Charlie Rose ?   But all this talk of pitching Al for Prime Time is premature. Although Sharpton  urlLink couldn't win DC , what's to say he's going to flame out in his other hopeful state,  urlLink South Carolina .    What if  he were to  win  South Carolina by snagging the majority of black votes in a tight four way race.  And : what if,  say , conservatives vote for Al  en masse  in open primary states? And what if he won the Democratic nomination as a result of the votes of his loyalists  plus  those of conservative spoilers!  (oh dear, I can already feel my readership beginning to snooze at the sheer  geekiness  of this)  And  then , what if -- just bear with me, now --  what if : Al went on to win the Presidency, buoyed by the  drunken frat boy vote  as well as  merry pranksters across the country  who want to see The Grand Old Party become, well, a  par-tay . Isn't humor ultimately more attractive to the masses? I mean, would you really rather hang out with  Jim Carrey  and  David Chapelle  or  Paul O'Neill  and  Pat Buchanan ,  hmm ?   Highly implausible , you say to a  Reverend President Al Sharpton . Well, I agree. But what if ... what  if  ... (dream sequence music trails off into ...)    January 20, 2005 : A visibly distraught  Chief Justice Rehnquist   administers the oath of office to  Reverend Al Sharpton , who becomes the 44th President of the United States. Immediately following the swearing in, Rehnquist has,  simultaneously , a nervous breakdown and a stroke at  urlLink the thought of an African American  President.  At the inaugural ball, Rehnquist exhibits a  spastic rigor  in his dance (" his freaky stylee ," would be inaugural invitee  Coolio's  take on the spectacle in the next day's  Washington Post ) that was generally taken to be a result of  drunken  revelry. Only later, after the last dance as Rehquist writhed on the floor, did attendees realize that The Ren had not  actually  been engaged in highly  elaborate  breakdancing maneuvers, but was, indeed, in a perilous plight.  Sandra Day O'Connor  would sum up the majority opinion in the  New York Times  by observing, solemnly, "all involved didn't know the seriousness of the matter. We believed that he had passed the bar ... about six or seven times too many."  James Brown performs " urlLink Hot Pants " instead of the traditional "hail to the Chief."   January 22, 2005 : The Andrew Jacksonesque populist appoints  Richard Simmons  as  Surgeon General  and  Chairman of the President's Council of Physical Fitness .   Immediately following, Simmons, The Reverend President and the Religious Right form a joint task force on fundamentalism and excercise called,  Sweatin' to the Holies .  Instead of the partisan Republican Prayer Breakfasts, Democrats and Republicans seeking early morning face time with the President must excercise to gospel and Christian Contemporary hits while being prodded on by  Surgeon General Simmons . The President notes: there will be no breaking of bread ... too many carbs ...  we are all on Atkins , you know.   January 24, 2005 : The Godfather of Soul is appointed Ambassador to the Holy See. "The Pope can no longer call us a nation turning it's back on its soul anymore," the President quips.  February 1, 2005: The President recieves a delegation of Hindi Ascetics, but after, rather  pornographically , mispronouncing their religious title, the " fakirs ," who have lived a life devoted to peace, abruptly exit the Oval Office in a swarm of  obscenities  and  curses  involving the President's mother.  February 2, 2005:  Tina Brown  officially begins sucking up to the new President.   Or something along those lines . How  fun  would a Reverend Al Presidency be?

       Memo From Dick Gephardt to Staff   Dear Staff:  First off, I would like to thank you for your unwaivering support in these last days leading up to the crucial Iowa primary that will make or break my Presidential campaign.    Now to the point of this memo . While I am painfully aware that a Gephardt campaign does not relay the same social cachet as most of the other Democratic campaigns, or more particularly, for that matter, the Clark run, I am a bit disappointed that we have not shored up a number of key endorsements.  Sure, if you want to hear  urlLink Madonna extol the virtues of Kabbala bracelets , or  Christopher Guest , you go to see  Wesley Clark . And if you want to hear solid discourse on  NAFTA  and the history of  organized labor in the Midwest , then you come see me.  And if you want to see  Martin Sheen  and  Susan Sarandon  and  Michael Douglas  -- those glamour pusses -- then you go to sign up for  urlLink Dean's campaign . But if you want to hear bold ideas on  Universal Pensions  and an  International Minimum Wage , come on down,  urlLink you are welcome here .  And if you want  Ashton Kutcher , then your punk is  John Edwards . But if you're worried about getting  urlLink punked by the privatization of Social Security , heck,  I'm your man .   Uma Thurman  and  urlLink Jamie Lee Curtis ?  urlLink John Kerry . Uma wouldn't have gotten all mussed up by  urlLink Bill and the Divas  if we had had  urlLink vigorously enforced gun safety laws .  Even  Dennis Kucinich  has  urlLink Willie Nelson , and  Danny Glover .  Well, even old Willie can't smoke me out on my commitment to, uhm,  urlLink agriculture .  While we have racked up  impressive  endorsements from prominent celebrities like  urlLink Barry Manilow ,  urlLink Tony Bennett  and  urlLink Michael Bolton , we must keep up the pressure. Stars influence decisions, just ask  urlLink Walter Mercado ! And when it comes to decision time, I want Iowan votes.  Has anyone put in a call to  urlLink Spandau Ballet ? De xy's Midnight Runners  might be a good group to get on the horn. I'd imagine a rousing performance of  Come on Eileen  might go over well in those critical Southern primaries.  And what of  urlLink Berlin ? They  urlLink take my breath away , and I'm sure Air Force Academy cadets nostalgic over Maverick's Top Gun will do a do a 4G negative dive over those fellas.  What I'm saying is  get to it , guys, these are the last days, and  we need C Listers .  Thanks,  Dick

       The Penn is Mightier than the Scimetar   Apparently the Penn is mightier than the  urlLink scimetar  ... The  SEAN   PENN !  You better recognize , readers, the man who tied ...   allegedly  tied  Madonna  to a chair and walked away.   urlLink American Spirits  are wacky cigarettes ... ask Sean.    Anyhoo : Beat-poet wannabe extraordinaire  Sean Penn  ( no , not  Johnny Depp ) pens the second part of his  long-awaited  freelance report on Iraq for the  urlLink San Fransisco Chronicle .  As expected, the report reads like  Jack Kerouac  doing melodrama (which is, I guess,  Jack London ) and, to borrow from  alleged  swindler  Martha Stewart  ...  that's a good thing . Oh, how good for the  shadenfreude :  "As darkness descends, the sound of gunshots intensifies. On this night I'm determined to make my way across town to meet with  Rob Collier  of  The Chronicle .   ( The Corsair  sits close to screen, lotus-style, munching salt free popcorn,  fascinated , yet simultaneously trying to concentrate on the  urlLink Diamond Sutra )  "My taxi arrives at about 9 p.m., and one of the staff of the  urlLink Institute for War and Peace Reporting  gives the Arabic-speaking cabdriver directions to the restaurant where I'm to meet with Collier (I'll get a goddamn lamb chop yet). I grab my video camera, slip the button to 'night shot,' and my driver and I hit the road."  Lambchops  notwithstanding , Our Man Penn's straightforward fly-on-the-wall reportage style gets into some ointment,  Baathist -style (no doubt, checkit):  "As I am about to shut off the camera, I sense a bright light over my right shoulder. Keeping the camera to my eye, I pan past the windshield to where on the right shoulder, six armed Iraqis mill about beside a sandbag- fortified position, housing a long-gunner in front of a nondescript building. We are moving into some traffic as I pan the camera through the passenger-side window. One of the armed men screams something in Arabic at me and raises his rifle toward my camera. We are suddenly stuck in traffic."  ( The Corsair  inches closer, curiosity  piqued )  Sean continues:  "I switch off the camera and drop it at my feet as more rifles and voices rise and move toward us. I suddenly fear that my driver might attempt to accelerate and somehow escape. Every instinct tells me that the soldiers would fire on us if he did. I know he doesn't speak English, so I use the universal, 'Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!'"    Whoa!  What the  fuck?  Penn is quoting  urlLink Jeff Spicoli  in a life-death  Mujehadein  situation? Is that a method actor or what? Dedication: thy name is Sean.    Seriously, though : You mean that wannabe Beat writer Sean Penn is really in the  thick  of things? Okay, now let's get back to the narrative ... armed Arabic-speaking men are approaching the papparazzi-puncher. He tells his driver to  whoa , and not gun the accelerator:  "(The driver) whoas and we are surrounded at gunpoint by six guards as they pull us from the taxi. There is a lot of shouting, and my driver looks frightened. We are ushered out of the illuminated area of the street and now, standing in a darkened Baghdad alley, my legs spread, arms extended, I am circled by six leather-jacketed Iraqis, their Kalashnikov rifles trained on me.   "Here is what comes to my mind: 'Dear  Phil Bronstein , please accept my formal resignation from journalism. My understanding is that  Giorgio Armani  is sending a new linen suit to my California home, and I would like to supply it a body as intact as possible, as the suit is tailored. P.S.: I miss lamb chops.' "    Fucking Phil Bronstein !  Mr. Sharon Stone .( The Corsair  tosses his empty bag of popcorn in the air)  I knew it . It was  the macho  that hit me as the tip off.  Every wanna be tough guy journo  is seperated from Phil Bronstein by Six Degrees!  But I digress. You have to read this account.  urlLink It's actually really interesting  if you can suspend judgement.

       Al Gore's Tin Ear   Now look, I  believe  in the case for  urlLink global warming .  The Corsair  is not some crazy Evangelical with a witch-doctorate from  urlLink Bob Jones U  shouting "blashemy!" against science and the  laws of nature .   I am not   Rush Limbaugh .  The Corsair  is a pretty even-handed guy who likes to refer to himself as a  pirate in the third person . *Ahem* That having been said: I believe that the rising in the Global mean of the sea level is  sufficient  to prove that greenhouse emissions have increased as a result of aggressive human industrial activity in the last two centuries.  (So there all of you who thought I was shallow ...;)  But good politics is one part  visionary idealism  and one part  sceptical realism  (throw in  blind luck  there for good measure,  my little pommies ).  Al Gore  appears to be trying to gain ground in his vision quest after that disaster of a Presidential campaign in which he had  Naomi Wolf  dressing him in neutral earth tones  urlLink trying to be an alpha male .  Al Gore  also  doesn't seem to have much of that aforementioned  blind luck  category,  no ?  But  urlLink Al Gore is psycho to deliver his Global Warming speech  in New York on a  fuckingfrigid!  day like today.   No punch lines, no jokes, just scorn (averted gaze).   Al ... like, couldn't you have scheduled the speech in  San Fransisco ? Or even  Atlanta ?   Sheesh.   Ares men are like  urlLink Don Quiote's  rearin for the good fight while subtly sabotaging their own efforts in the process.  And a little Don Q for the Goremeister:  "'Look, your worship,'' said  Sancho . 'What we see there are not giants but windmills, and what seem to be their arms are the vanes that turned by the wind make the millstone go."  "'It is easy to see,' replied  Don Quixote , 'that you are not used to this business of adventures. Those are giants, and if you are afraid, away with you out of here and betake yourself to prayer, while I engage them in fierce and unequal combat.  "So saying, he gave the spur to his steed  Rocinante , heedless of the cries his squire Sancho sent after him, warning him that most certainly they were windmills and not giants he was going to attack."

And Calvin makes us drinks and he keeps ogling me and saying, 'you look hot Janice. No,  seriously .  Really hot. I mean,  hot .'  "And Iman says, I think she gets it, Calvin.'  "And Calvin leaves the room and comes back a few moments later, having slipped out of his pants, to get comfortable. So now he's sitting there in a boxy silk shirt and no pants and Fruit-of-the-Loom underwear and fucking knee socks. It was bizarre. Maybe he thought  he  looked hot.

       The Apprentice? No ... The Cheapskate   Now I know that a certain amount of readers (free marketers and  Ayn Rand  afficionados) will fault this post, and I accept your scorn, my little pomegranates, but,  dammit , if the guys at  urlLink TheSmokingGun  feel it is worthy, then -- well --  so do I .    Donald Trump  is, quite frankly, a cheapskate when  urlLink it comes to charity .  Sure,  you are right , The Trumper doesn't have to give a  goddamned penny , but he does, through the Trump Foundation -- $287,000 in 2002. So, doesn't that make him Top Drawer?  Well, no.  That amount is nothing, absolutely  nothing  compared to, say, the $5 million that his poorer archrival  Leona Helmsley  gave to the  urlLink 9-11 Fund , or even the  urlLink $1 million that Dr. Dre gave , and he is  nowhere near  as rich as The Trumper (who is rumored to be worth in the  ten figure  range).   What's also interesting  are the charities he supports. Trup gave $10,000 -- a drop in the bucket, to be sure -- to  The Metropolitain Golf Foundation  ( four !"), but only  $1,000 each  to the  urlLink United Cerebral Palsy of New York City  and the  urlLink Leukemia and Lymphoma Society .  Glad to see he has his priorities straight.  Trump did, however, find time to give a  heapin'   $58,000  to the Police Athletic League in 2002. Trumper also gave $3500 to the  PAL Woman of the Year  and $10,125 to the  New York City Police Foundation . Hmmm ... do we sense a  theme emerging  here? I don't want to say it out loud, but  I think you get my drift  on where I am going with this.  Let's just say that solicitors for donations from Trump are best served by adding the word "police" to their pitch. Not that there is anything  wrong  with that (*looks around uneasily*).   Way to bread your butter , Trumpster.  My guess is that if any celebrity scandal touches the short fingered barbarian, he will get the  nicest  cell in the joint.

       Phil Bronstein Wants $1 Million From Sharon Stone     Phil Bronstein , aka,  Mr. Sharon Stone  is not a  himbo ; he's just a macho editor in need of some of his wife's financial, uh, ahem,  scrilla . *coughs*" wussy "*coughs*   urlLink Star Magazine's  Jennifer Pearson reports that the preferred snack of  urlLink Komodo Dragons  everywhere,  Phil Bronstein , "executive vice president and editor of the San Francisco Chronicle -- is reportedly demanding $1 million in spousal support, as is reportedly stipulated in their 1998 prenuptial agreement. (At the time, Sharon was worth $11 million.)"  The article continues:  "'Sharon thinks it's really pathetic of Phil and believes he just wants to assert some sort of control,' says one close friend. 'It's become a power play. But I don't think Sharon is going to give Phil anything willingly.'"   And concludes:  "According to another source, Phil has tried to reach a truce with Sharon, even going so far as to buy her an antique necklace for Christmas. 'It was his way of saying a divorce doesn't have to mean the end of civility. I don't think Sharon got Phil anything.'"  Mmm- hmmm .   Odd  and interesting as all that is,  The Corsair  is still reeling from that wierd  Komodo Dragon incident  where Stone watched in horror as her hubby's toe was mangled by the man-eating reptile. Here is an account taken from the  urlLink Japan Today  (of all places) dated June 25, 2001:   "The reptile keeper's version of the dragon attack differs from accounts offered by Bronstein and Stone, which credited Bronstein with besting the 4-year-old, 24 kg Indonesian monitor lizard.  "Bronstein's own newspaper, in its June 14 account of the incident, said the editor 'slammed his foot down, anchoring the dragon's lower jaw to the ground .... Bronstein pried the dragon's upper jaw off his foot, hobbled away and dived for the door.'  "The official zoo report also gave a  slightly  )ed note: italics mine) different version of Stone's role. While crediting the movie star with using a sock tourniquet to staunch the bleeding from her husband's toe, they said she then stepped out of the enclosure to make cell phone calls to relatives.  "'She was hysterical,'  Genie Vasels , an official from the  Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association , the fund-raising arm of the zoo, said in her written account. 'I tried to calm her down. She said that the bite was bad, down to the bone.'  "The zoo said the general curator,  Michael Dee , then called for an ambulance as zoo workers applied ice packs.  "'He looked scared and pale,' Vasels said of Bronstein."  And now he wants  alimony ? *coughs*wuss*coughs*  Wasn't the  tourniquet  enough,  tough guy ?

Margaret Cho , who  urlLink I have interviewed in the past , and who happens to say some of the more outrageous things (nooo ...  you don't say ), for example:  "Despite all of this stupid bullshit that the Republican National Committee, or whatever the fuck they call them, that they were saying that they're all angry about how two of these ads were comparing  Bush  to  Hitler ? I mean, out of thousands of submissions, they find two. They're like fu--ing looking for Hitler in a (haystack). You now? I mean, George Bush is not Hitler. He would be if he fucking applied himself. (big, extended applause)  ... I mean he just  isn't ."   Good to know , Margaret. And:  "... They could have moved the Ten Commandments to Bush's office -- which he needs them, desperately. Or maybe he needs a new version of the Ten Commandments --  George W. Bush's Ten Commandments : Thou shalt not steal... votes . (big applause) Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's... country . (big applause) Thou shalt not kill... for oil . (big applause) Thou shalt not take grammar... in vain . (big applause) I mean, whatever fucking happened to separation of church and state? I mean, you can't like, impose your god on my god. God has many names. God is  God , God is  Jehovah , God is  Allah , God is  Buddah , God is  Beyonce . (laughter)"  Drudge also drudges up harmless quotes from obscure rapper  Chuck D :  "Son of a Bush and his crew is at it again, because, we do not want 8 years run by a  Colon , a  Bush  and a  Dick ." (big applause)   Finally , the terminally unfunny jerk  Al Franken  rounds out this  urlLink cast :  "I'm  Al Franken . I'm here to present the funniest ad award. I'm a last-minute substitution, former Treasury Secretary  Paul O'Neill  was supposed to be the presenter, but unfortunately he was murdered."   Funny, Al: How could  urlLink Stuart Smiley  have tanked with oh-so-swiftly crafted lines like that?  The Corsair  would like to ask the near-hysterical Matt Drudge (he has  the vapors ) if he doesn't  realize  that these are  comedians  and one bitter rapper who lost his spot at the top for coining anti-semitic lines.    Is it just a slow news day in Miami , Matt? In America, one is entitled to say whatever one wants to his or her heart's content assuming, of course, that said content does not include yelling  fire  in a crowded movie theater, or that sort of thing.  Besides , what kind of a threat do these guys pose to warrant top billing on the Drudge Report?  Alas, the country is growing more and more polarized, tragically, between the  comedians  and the  evangelicals  -- who also sometimes moonlight as clowns. Someone call  David Brooks ,  fast ! I need this situation clarified for me in a manner as only his  soothing prose  can do.

       Britney on Justin?   Young love ... there's nothing like it. And when it goes wrong, young hearts turn bitter.

       Farewell, Steve Florio   Via  urlLink Gawker's   Choire Sicha  and through the  urlLink New York Times  we learn that  Steve Florio  is stepping down as Chief Executive at Conde Nast for health reasons.    "He will be succeeded by  Charles H. Townsend , chief operating officer of the Advance Magazine Group, " writes  David Carr , "which runs the back-office functions for Condé Nast and the other magazine groups within Advance Publications, the parent company."  In honor of Florio's departure, I'd like to run a long excerpt of an interview by  Ingrid Sischy  which ran in  urlLink Interview in November 1995 :  " Steve Florio : It was right after my thirtieth birthday, at seven one morning. I've always been an early riser. The voice on the other end of the phone said, 'Is this Steve Florio?' I said yes. Then he said, 'My name is  Si Newhouse .' I replied, 'Oh, yes Mr. Newhouse, I know who you are.' He said, 'I just bought a magazine called  Gentlemen's Quarterly  and I was wondering if you would like to come over and talk to me about being the publisher.' That was on a Wednesday. He offered me the job on Thursday and I started on Monday. All of a sudden there is this rush, and three days later your life has changed. It can be like a kind of rebirth that you didn't even realize you needed. So I worked on GQ and it was maybe the most fun that I even had in my business career.  " Ingrid Sischy : When was this?  "SF: This was from 1979 to 1984."  The interview contniues:  "SF: ... At GQ we were trying to make it more accessible to all men and the way we decided to do that was by putting personalities on the cover. I called  Aaron Latham , the great writer. He had been working on a piece that was called 'The Urban Cowboy.' This was when they were making the film  Urban Cowboy , with  John Travolta , and I asked Aaron if he could get us John Travolta to appear for a cover shoot and he did. That was really the first such cover. We had had a couple of personalities before but this was the real beginning of the new GQ.  "IS: Did the circulation change instantly, Steve?  "SF: The change was amazing. That's the thing about magazines, they are much more dynamic than people give them credit for. What I think I've always been best at is understanding that magazines are not just demographic figures or circulation numbers or manufacturing or distribution budgets. Magazines are living, breathing things. When I was a salesman in the early part of my career, running around selling ad space, I very rarely used research and numbers to convince people. In my early days at  Esquire  (ed note: Florio used to work at Esquire) I would sit there with the marketing director or the president of a company and talk about  Hemingway , about  F. Scott Fitzgerald , about  Tom Wolfe  and the whole New journalism movement. To me it wasn't just a matter of a sale. I was getting paid to have these enormously stimulating conversations about subject matter that fascinated me. When Tom Wolfe wrote 'The last American Hero Is Junior Johnson. Yes!' about the world of automobile racing, I remember sitting down with these guys and saying to them, 'This magazine is the fastest, most beautiful boat in the world, and you guys can't drive it because you're in advertising--the editor gets to drive, but you get to go for the ride. Someone like a Tom Wolfe transports us all there. We are there, in the pit, smelling the rubber and the gasoline, and we are being entertained, while right next to the story is this ad for your product. If it's a great product and it can hold up to the stature of the magazine, and the wonderful level of writing that you find in the magazine, they're going to buy your product.' I probably had more presentations like that than on the cost per thousands, or the CPM. When I went to GQ, when it came to fashion I wasn't interested in the fact that we were showing this type of color of icon being developed in the early '80s, and they were called designers. There were people named  Ralph Lauren ,  Calvin Klein , and  Giorgio Armani  who were becoming larger-than-life figures. We just touched all of this and the spark went off and we had something.  "IS: What year was that? SF: I'm going to say 1980.  "IS: So you were helping guide the magazine not only to the business end as publisher but also in some ways editorially as well.  "SF: At that point I was. But my editorial involvement aggressively backed off when the editor that I had been working with resigned--a man named Jack Haber. After he left, Si Newhouse hired  Arthur Cooper , who is still the editor. Cooper was a seasoned editor, he had worked on a number of magazines, and he told Si, 'I can't work with a thirty-year-old publisher who is also going to have editorial override. You have to give me my lead.' I agreed that he should have that because I was really flying by the seat of my pants and trying to make the magazine something, but not quite sure how to do it. Cooper came in and did a brilliant job, almost immediately. The magazine really became well-rounded in those years, and it accelerated on the business and circulations front, too. In 1984, we had a five-hundred-page increase in advertising.  "IS: Did the competition try and snag you?  "SF: The one offer that intrigued me the most was the  Times Mirror Company  because I love to sail and get out on boats, and one of their magazines was  Yachting . I love to hike in the woods and they had  Outdoor Life . They offered me the job as a president of the Times Mirror magazine group. I told them I just wanted to think about it for a couple of days. I flew home and went to see Si Newhouse at six one morning. At this point in my career I only used to see Mr. Newhouse maybe once or twice a year. I walked into his office and he looked up from his deck and said, 'Where?' He's been doing this a long time and he knows when something's up. I was nervous, Ingrid, I was dying, because I had had this great run at GQ, but now I was going to make a lot more dough, I was going to have even more responsibility, many magazines, not just one. I never told him what was offered to me. He said, 'Look, how would you like to be the president and chief executive of  The New Yorker ?' I said, 'Mr. Newhouse The New Yorker is the greatest magazine in America, but you don't own the The New Yorker,' and he laughed and said, 'Don't ever use that sentence with me.' Eventually I spent almost a decade at The New Yorker. That, too, was just an amazing experience for me. Then on January 7, 1994, it was my first day back from my Christmas break. I got one of those early morning calls from Si Newhouse.  "IS: I hope the phone is on your side of the bed and not on your wife's.  "SF: (laughs) I was in the office, actually. (laughs again) Si said, 'Come on over,' and I asked, 'What should I bring?' He said, 'Nothing, just come over.' I walked over there thinking, Oh Jesus, what's going to happen? And I sat down with him and I said, 'What's up?' He said, 'Steve, I'm going to make you president of Conde Nast Publications.' Then he told me that I would have a new partner. Aside from working with [Si] every day I'd be working with  James Truman . And he announced James's appointment as editorial director about a month later."  Farewell  Steve Florio .

       Jay McInerney at the Old Gray Lady?!    urlLink The excellent gossip reporters   Rush and Molloy  (wouldn't the story of these guys make for a great Miramax movie? I  love  these two) report that  Jay McInerney  is in the running to do a column for  that Old Gray Lady  (slut!):  "Most restaurants would be thrilled to have a famous name like  Jay McInerney  walk through the door. But what if the writer were there to pass judgement on their chicken salad for  The New York Times ?  "The 'Bright Lights, Big City' author is hotly rumored to be in the running to succeed the paper's just-retired restaurant critic,  William (Biff) Grimes .   "Grape buff McInerney has written a book about his wine cellar, and used to be  urlLink the wine columnist for House and Garden magazine . "  Well, here are my thoughts on Jay, dated November 19, entitled:   Jay McInerney Slurps   In which, young  Mwangaguhunga  wrote rather snarkily:  "I have two recurring dream-reality issues. One is that I believe that there was a cartoon once in which  Laverne and Shirley  are trapped on an island with a pig as a marine sargeant. Everyone tells me there was no such thing, but I am sure it is not a dream,  this was an actual cartoon . Am I going crazy?  " Anyhoo:  the second issue is that  Jay McInerney  was actually a wine columnist for  House and Garden . This book of his is a collection of his columns and is  urlLink surprisingly bad .  "Like his mentor,  Norman Mailer , McInerney thinks that because he can write he has the authority to write about anything ....  anythang  ... even subject matter of which he clearly has no grasp.  He goes on for 278 pages -- a  hellish  duration, to be sure, to be trapped in the mind of an amateur --  expecting us to fork over $24.95 so that  he  can associate himself under the category fine wine in his own inimitable  gassy  verbiage. What a pedestrian technique of self; donning the garb of the oneophile without the requisite study and learning.  "To know the meaning of a good belly laugh,  The Corsair  suggests that you read McInerney's chapter on  port . His philistine take on that venerable spirit combined with his  limited  vocabulary only suggest that either his tastebuds never left the  Bennington dining hall  or his ambition just exceded his grasp of the grape.  "Jay,  why don't you just admit you don't know what the fuck you're talking about? "  That was written back on November 19. Let's hope he has more to say on food than he had to say on wine in that godawful book way back when.

       My Eight Favorite Curmudgeons   Has there ever been an African-American  curmudgeon ? I mean, it's not as if  taste  is a matter exclusive to white men, or even  metrosexuals  purely. Well, if there are not, put me down as the  world's first African American curmudge .   And in that good old   list-y  curmudgeonly fashion, allow me to proffer up my list of the  eight  best (why  ten ? ten is such a  bourgois  convention *sips Cutty Sark* returns snarkily again to blog):   Kurt Anderson , the Elder Brother of the NY Media Corridor is a curmudgeon, to be sure. I interviewed with Kurt for a job at the late, great  Inside.com  --  didn't get it .  Alas; no hard feelings. At the time I had just been a research editor at the then oh-so-hot  Silicon Alley Reporter , and immediately following, had just been installed as Editor in Chief of a small consumer quarterly called,  urlLink MacDirectory . Kurt started off the interview by asking, with only a trace of irony, "so ... what's  MacDirectory ?" A smile played on his lips. Oh  snap ! I got dissed by the Elder Brother of the New York Media! Then again: How cool is that?   Before that, I had met him briefly as the factckecker on  urlLink New York Magazine's cyber 60 issue . There I saw Kurt, the editor, at, like, 11 pm on a Thursday night as I was trying to validate all this massive data for that issue; I was pretty frazzled as, by then, I was in my mid 20s and in the whole party all night work all day thing. Kurt made me work like a  Bonnie Fuller  minion on that one. Ah, well, whatever does not kill one ... Nietzsche  and all that .  Kurt has always about him the air of  high seriousness , which makes it appear as if what he's doing at the moment is the most important thing in the world. No doubt Steven Brill, who eventually purchased Inside, was caught on  that  disorienting roller coaster. Kurts study of sociology at Harvard plays a great part in his social smartness.   Kurt is the  Platonic eidos  of smart as well as healthily ironic,with a cultivated aesthetic eye and, of course, everyone wants to work with him for precisely those reasons.  Half of you probably found this choice   interesting , while the other half are scrolling furiously down the screen looking at my other picks whispering, "thanks for sharing,  Ron ." Hey, curmudgeons are  notoriously self centered .  My  second  curmudgeon is  Gore Vidal , whose book  Burr  I have just finished after three days of sleep deprivation.  American History  geek that I am, I could not put that shizit down and am now, hallucinating, posting this blog before the redcoats come to do a  urlLink Crispus Attucks  on my fine self. And so it is with ink stained hands that I tip my Corsair tricorn pirate hat to Vidal.   The Corsair  had a brief phone encounter with this honorable man of letters. In 1995, while an intern at  The Nation ,  Christopher Hitchens  asked me to fax a story on  Marty Peretz  of the New Republic to  Gore Vidal . Gore Vidal's fax was busy do I called him up to tell him it was coming through. In the background I heard voices and music, apparently Gore Vidal was having a party at his palazzo. " Pronto !" he yelled into the phone, sounding a little sloshed. I told him what was coming, he politely turned on the fax, and that was it. My brush with Vidal.  At that moment my desire to be a writer in the manner of Vidal was strengthened one hundred fold. I wanted to dash off essays  Montaigne -style on Art and Politics.  It is unfortunate that Vidal has, of late, taken to employing such  inflamatory  rhetoric during this tense period in American history (note: his assertion that  George Bush  knew of the 9-11 attacks before hand ...  yikes!).  The problem with Gore Vidal is that he was born rich and has lived his life where every utterance is taken as God's word, among idolizing students, servants, Presidents ( Kennedy ,  Hillary ?), and socialites ( Jackie O ,  Eleanor Roosevelt , even  Joanne Woodward ). He is for all intensive purposes the eccentric Southern Patriarch straight out of  William Faulkner . We should take him at his word on Art and with a grain of salt on politics.  My third favorite curmudgeon is  Christopher Hitchens . I worked as Hitchens' intern at  The Nation  in 1995, and, over the years, he has helped me immensely. Frankly, it pisses me off when former interns or collegues attack him for his perfectly principled -- though I disagree with him -- stance on eradicating dictators through pre-emptive action.    Hitchens can drink . I remember one event -- a tradition -- in which his intern is taken out to lunch. In a restaurant off of Grammercy Park, talking of classical literature and US defense spending, we drank  prodigiously . Yes,  The Corsair  got his drink on with Hitchens and his old college buddy. We also briefly discussed the country of my descent, Uganda, which was a British colony, and it's President, a family friend,  Museveni , who, although not a "small d democrat," we all agreed was  good  for the emerging nation.   The drink bill was greater than the food bill. Afterwards, in the summer afternoon, I tried, weaving through traffic, to make my way home ("no intern has ever made it back to the office after a Hitch lunch, don't even try," said the Intern coordinator). It was  harrowing . Several times  The Corsair  nearly lost his boozy life but I made it home and fondly remember my time working with Hitchens, a truly generous man. I remember my girlfriend wondering  what the hell  happened to me to be so drunk in the afternoon: did I get fired?  Next up is  Taki Theodoropoulos  whom I met at  Elaine's  when I was in my mid 20s. I won a contest for  Top Drawer  section of the NY Press, back when the NY Press was relevant. The contest was for Man of the Year and I nominated  urlLink UN arms inspector Scott Ritter , who, alas, turned out to be an  urlLink internet child predator . God, how fucking  embarrasing !  At Elaine's Taki introduced me to  Elaine Kaufman , the owner of that media joint,  Chris Buckley , who's dad almost went to my alma mater, he told me, and the arrogant  Michael Mailer  , of whom nothing ought to be said.   Taki comes off  very  strongly in his columns as  Eurosnobby  and to the right of Pinochet, but, in real life, he is quite a character, very warm and fun loving. Like Hitchens, he loves a drink.   Taki was terribly funny that day, making some very risque jokes about  Bill Clinton , who, at the time, was going through Monica-gate and good cigars. Taki is also deeply literate, with a working knowledge of  Pindar  as well as  Aeschylus , and all manner of Greek literature, Word War II arcana, history and choice tidbits of media gossip from the DC sector to Manhattan. And Taki is generous to a fault, having paid for the whole goddam party out of his own very deep Greek shipping magnate pockets. I'm talking many many thousands kept the party boozed up and in good food. Poor little Greek boy, indeed.  Next up is  Dick Cavett , who I am sure you will be  glad to know  I have never met, but I wish I had. Cavett was liberal cool before liberal cool was even that -- and even now that it  isn't . He is a Master Coversationalist, able to discuss  urlLink the bicameral mind theory  as well as mediate the literary feud of Gore Vidal and Norman Mailer where  urlLink Mailer headbutted Vidal .  Pure 70s conversation: keep on truckin, Dick.  There is agreat line that Cavett is said to have made at a very pretty young African American woman who was waiting to attand a taping of his show. Cavett asked her her name. "Toi," said she; "is that your  name ," he deadpanned, "or your  function ?"   urlLink Fran Liebowitz  is another formidable curmudgeon. Although she once remarked in  Metropolitain Life  that black men have a propensity to Strawberry Wine (who loves ya, Fran, who-loves- you ?), she was  very  very funny in her day.    urlLink John Simon of New York Magazine  is a curmudgeon who would have to be invented if he didn't indeed already exist. Once while at  The Nation  under an unbreakable deadline where I had to verify the spelling and history of an obscure filmmaker I was in dire straights. Who ya gonna call:  John Simon ! After flattering him on an article he wrote in some Scandanavian Literary Review that I had actually read (he replied, graciously, "thank you ... thank you ... you are probably the only one who has read it."), he helped me out --  gratis .   Most writers respond to such a request by saying, "well, what do  I  get out of it." *coughs* Fox News' Roger Friedman*coughs*" But  not Simon , who rules Broadway with a nimble yet caustic pen that sports acid for ink.   And when he is not loving to hate something on Broadway in the pages of newly bought New York Magazine, he is writing --  prolifically  -- on art, culture, literature, opera, books ...  anything . And he does it well.  Excedingly  well. God bless John Simon, our forgotten gem.  Then there is  urlLink Sandra Bernhard . She is strangely sexy and sad and acidic in her wit all at the same time. I saw her sachaying once across the way on Ludlow Street several years ago before Max Fish's lost its social cachet. There was something so touching ... so existential ... about her.   She was  beautiful , wearing a sleek number on her body not unlike Olive Oyl, sardonic smirk evident, aristocratic street toughness oozing out of every pore. God, she looked so fucking hot in a way that I cannot explain adequately.  Hollywood has not been kind to her, despite her gutsy performance in the King of New York, and neither has  Madonna , but they have, it appears, made up for all intensive purposes.  Why can't she get the jump off?   So there are my fave curmudgeons, not an African American among them, honorable mentions to  Margaret Cho , who is young, but on her way to the top drawer, and  Carrie Fisher , who has evolved from  Princess Leia  (sp?) into a snarky chronicler of life in Los Angeles, what city of glitz and plastic.  (Ed Note: This week will be a slow week of posts, please note. Next week I will be back to my old blogging self)

       Stupid Ass of the Week: Al Sharpton    Al Sharpton  behaved like a horse's ass in  urlLink last night's debate , which may or may not be surprising to readers of this blog.  Attacking  Howard Dean  for not having an African American on his staff while he was governor of Vermont, Sharpton  failed to mention  an important little fact: According to the 2000 census, Vermont's state population was  urlLink 0.5% African American .   I went to  Marlboro College  and was the only African American in my graduating class back in 1994. During my time there I was, to be frank, a bit of a  rock star . Many people had never seen an African American except on the Cosby Show. In that left leaning state, people would actually stare at me when I'd go to nearby towns; waitresses -- and I kid you not! -- would argue over who was taking my order. I was even  an authentic black experience  *coughs modestly* for quite a few of the ladies back then in my randy collegiate days.   Al Sharpton  is an ass for attacking Dean on that matter.  National Review's   Byron York  actually has a perceptive piece as to  urlLink why Dean couldn't really tear into Sharpton .

       The Chattering Class Virtual Year Book    Far be it from me , lowly blogger, to impede the progress of all the  primping  and  preening  that goes on among the chattering classes. I mean, they do deserve their time to waddle in the sun being as they explain reality to the rest of the world daily, via their nesting centers in NY, DC and LA, and occasionally  urlLink Davos  and Sundance.  Sometimes the chattering class appear to be unruly students at  urlLink J K Rowlings'  mythical  Hogwarts , struggling in childlike wonder with The Great Questions of Good and Evil --- naked ambition versus the ermine robes of state.  Imagine, if you will,  urlLink Eisner  or, say,  Michael Powell , as  urlLink Voldemortian  forces lying in wait in support of media consolidation! Not too much of a wizarding stretch, I hope.  Now,  take away the element of magic  and at other times, The Chattering Classes appear to be not unlike the  urlLink birds . Imagine if you will,  Barry Diller  a  urlLink heron , or  Anna Wintour  a  urlLink swan , pecking at a salad,  Jayson Blair  (averted gaze) a  urlLink turkey  ("performs distraction display") and  Harvey Weinstein  an  urlLink American Kestrel  ("Pale belly"). My bird's eye view. That's just how  The Corsair's  fevered media-oversaturated imagination works: all  wizards and warblers .  The Chattering Class render their ideas in varying forms of, uhm, media: sometimes they use the standard black and white print, often radio waves, other times tv, glossy mags are the usual, even mini studios--  whatever  the means of communication, there is some hawkish champion ready to express themselves, so, in the end, it is  difficult  to characterize The Mediaratti fully as the variety of media are matched only by the infinitude of styles and thought, limited only by the imagination; and, of course, I don't intend (or  pre tend) to be the last word on the matter-- neither as Hogwarts' sorting hat nor as Audubonian birder on the prowl.  Nor  do I, in any way, mean this to be a  complete list , but only a partial listing of those flapping wings who have crossed my radar screen.   So, like the snarky and chaotic (I think the very cool  urlLink Choire  called me absolutely mad, and I don't dispute that claim)  urlLink Gemini  that I am, allow me to mix my metaphors, combining Rowlings and Ravens, to try and draw a bede on these venerable birds.

       President Al Sharpton: The First Few Days   As you can see, the progressive buildup to the Iowa caucus has thrown me off my usually sophisticated pop-culturally obsessed game, and gotten me all  sexed up  on  politics .  Blame Iowa ! Bear with me, though,  my little pomegranates , I  will  come out of this little poly-sci funk intact and, on the other side of the caucus, back in rare form.  My  fascination du jour , though, if you must know, is the  urlLink Reverend Al Sharpton .   And why not : His campaign is quixotic, to be sure, but there is also quite a bit of  pathos  and some, well,  humor  in it.   Actually, there is lots of humor in his candidacy if you know  how  to look. Sharpton has come away -- post  SNL  -- as a sort of  Falstaffian  American character (charicature?), more perfectly suited to  Comedy Central  than the rigors of the campaign trail. Perhaps he might consider following  Jon Stewart , or a late night show on  VH1  opposite  Charlie Rose ?   But all this talk of pitching Al for Prime Time is premature. Although Sharpton  urlLink couldn't win DC , what's to say he's going to flame out in his other hopeful state,  urlLink South Carolina .    What if  he were to  win  South Carolina by snagging the majority of black votes in a tight four way race.  And : what if,  say , conservatives vote for Al  en masse  in open primary states? And what if he won the Democratic nomination as a result of the votes of his loyalists  plus  those of conservative spoilers!  (oh dear, I can already feel my readership beginning to snooze at the sheer  geekiness  of this)  And  then , what if -- just bear with me, now --  what if : Al went on to win the Presidency, buoyed by the  drunken frat boy vote  as well as  merry pranksters across the country  who want to see The Grand Old Party become, well, a  par-tay . Isn't humor ultimately more attractive to the masses? I mean, would you really rather hang out with  Jim Carrey  and  David Chapelle  or  Paul O'Neill  and  Pat Buchanan ,  hmm ?   Highly implausible , you say to a  Reverend President Al Sharpton . Well, I agree. But what if ... what  if  ... (dream sequence music trails off into ...)    January 20, 2005 : A visibly distraught  Chief Justice Rehnquist   administers the oath of office to  Reverend Al Sharpton , who becomes the 44th President of the United States. Immediately following the swearing in, Rehnquist has,  simultaneously , a nervous breakdown and a stroke at  urlLink the thought of an African American  President.  At the inaugural ball, Rehnquist exhibits a  spastic rigor  in his dance (" his freaky stylee ," would be inaugural invitee  Coolio's  take on the spectacle in the next day's  Washington Post ) that was generally taken to be a result of  drunken  revelry. Only later, after the last dance as Rehquist writhed on the floor, did attendees realize that The Ren had not  actually  been engaged in highly  elaborate  breakdancing maneuvers, but was, indeed, in a perilous plight.  Sandra Day O'Connor  would sum up the majority opinion in the  New York Times  by observing, solemnly, "all involved didn't know the seriousness of the matter. We believed that he had passed the bar ... about six or seven times too many."  James Brown performs " urlLink Hot Pants " instead of the traditional "hail to the Chief."   January 22, 2005 : The Andrew Jacksonesque populist appoints  Richard Simmons  as  Surgeon General  and  Chairman of the President's Council of Physical Fitness .   Immediately following, Simmons, The Reverend President and the Religious Right form a joint task force on fundamentalism and excercise called,  Sweatin' to the Holies .  Instead of the partisan Republican Prayer Breakfasts, Democrats and Republicans seeking early morning face time with the President must excercise to gospel and Christian Contemporary hits while being prodded on by  Surgeon General Simmons . The President notes: there will be no breaking of bread ... too many carbs ...  we are all on Atkins , you know.   January 24, 2005 : The Godfather of Soul is appointed Ambassador to the Holy See. "The Pope can no longer call us a nation turning it's back on its soul anymore," the President quips.  February 1, 2005: The President recieves a delegation of Hindi Ascetics, but after, rather  pornographically , mispronouncing their religious title, the " fakirs ," who have lived a life devoted to peace, abruptly exit the Oval Office in a swarm of  obscenities  and  curses  involving the President's mother.  February 2, 2005:  Tina Brown  officially begins sucking up to the new President.   Or something along those lines . How  fun  would a Reverend Al Presidency be?

       RZA Goes Off    The Corsair  just cannot get over how crazy  urlLink RZA  is. He's  urlLink crazy like Swayze .  Ask him anything and it's on like  urlLink Grey Poupon . Ask him where the  nearest gas station is  and you get a soliloquy about  his  favorite natural resource,  urlLink colloidal silver . Ask him about the  weather  and he delivers a an eccentric little dithyramb on  whether  or not karate can be viewed with the third eye.   Whew!   He so crazy ...   Anyhoo : here is a snippet of RZA's recent interview with  urlLink One World , an interview in which you learn a quite a bit more about his childhood than is necessary:   One World : Listen, I want to ask you another question ... What is the connection between kids living in urban environments and kung fu movies?   RZA : There's a couple of ways to look at it. One, any hero that we see as a kid inspires us to want to be him -- anything that's more powerful than us. Because as a kid, there's many nightmares, its really bad experiences, it's many of those things. For the kung-fu movies, though, it has an extra piece to it. Martial arts, xi-gong and t'ai chi is the natural vibration of the body, it's the natural flow of energy, really. Kung fu is the best energy flowing and energy builder and expeller -- the only thing compared to that is sex, they say. That's the only thing that has the same potential for energy. And sex is really the epitome of creative energy. So when a kid whose young and creative and has all this extra energy and not really having sex, anyway, besides his own masturbation -- he's watching all this action; it inspires his subconscious. For those who are really in tune with nature, they could change their whole life. Somebody like myself -- it started off for me watching these movies and acting like them. The it went to the next level of me watching them with the third eye and listening to the philosophy of the movies, which is also very profound.  Bruce Lee  was a scientist. He wasn't just a fighter.   " Wu Tang Clan  has a lot to do with this whole new influx of Asian things and also the love that blacks automatically have for the Asian culture without even knowing that we're the fathers of it. Like, you don't know that  urlLink Don Mo  who went and taught Xi-gong to the monks was a black man from South India who migrated from Ethiopia with the Dravidian tribe?"  No, I  didn't know that , actually.

Brian : Just your normal everyday lunch.   Bender : Milk?   Brian : Soup.... Apple juice.   Bender : I can read. PB & J with the crusts cut off. Well Brian, this is a very nutricious lunch. All the food groups are represented. Did your mom marry  Mr. Rogers ?   Brian : No, Mr. Johnson  ****   Vernon : What if your home, what if your family, what if  your dope  was on fire?   Bender : Impossible, sir. Its in Johnson's underwear.

       Harvey Weinstein's Freaky Stylee   Via  urlLink Gawker  we learn that  Harvey Weinstein  traffics in  urlLink weopons of mass distraction  when journos appraoch him with exposees on  Miramax .    Jacob Bernstein  writes for  WWD :  "According to the forward of (Peter) Biskind’s book, Weinstein asked him, 'Don’t you have a book idea that’s really close to your heart?' When Biskind innocently responded that he’d always wanted to write a book about the science of politics, Weinstein told him, 'Great. We could sell a million copies! Forget about that other book.'”   Berstein then goes on to recount similar ploys used against  Ken Auletta  and  Kevin Kelly  of the Post.   That would explain Miraxax's quixotic publication of punk  AJ Benza's   urlLink Fame Aint it a Bitch

       The Corsair's Prediction   My crystal ball is so clear it is fucking scary.  Scary!  My prediction about a  urlLink Howard Stern interview  show has turned out to be correct. Here is how I phrased it --  verbatim  --on January 7, 2004:  " More Predictions   "Before this year  really  gets under way, let me fire off some more predictions on the record:  " Howard Stern  will not renew his radio contract. Instead, he will become CBS'  Barbara Walters , doing interviews with treain wrecks, like, say,  Heidi Fleiss  or  Paris Hilton . The CBS Entertainment division will pay the subjects a la "checkbook journalism." The show will come on periodically, called 'Howard Stern Interviews ...'"   How creepy is that ? Okay; so it wasn't CBS, but I even got the Barbara Walters reference. My hairs are standing on the back of my neck. Industry take note,  Ron Mwangaguhunga  has a sharp crystal ball. Other predictions I have made:  "The infamously clumsy  Will Smith  will memorably trip and fall down at The Oscars.  " Sarah Jessica Parker  will get an Oprah-like syndicated talk show aimed at the hip young woman. The show will feature and be supported inordinately by the fashion houses.  " P Diddy  will run for NY mayor as an independent and  Russell Simmons  will signal a willingness to run as an independent for Governor, staring off a new volley of  urlLink celebrity politicians .  "Pakistani leader  Musharraf  will be assasinated.  Osama Bin Laden  will make Pakistan the next frontier in the US War on Terror. India will become our new close ally in the war. As a result, Indian fashion, food and music will undergo a rennaisance in the US just as British culture did immediately following 9-11. India comes into its own in 2004.  " Justin Timberlake  will marry  Cameron Diaz  and  Al Greene  will perform the cermony as well as sing.  " Tony Blair  will be forced to step down. Britain will face a year of upheval as  Prince Charles  declines the crown amid scandal over Diana's death, making way for William to become King.  "We will all be quoting lines from  Donald Trump's   urlLink Apprentice  show for much of the early part of 2004.  " Alec Baldwin  and  Richard Johnson  will fight -- celebrity boxing style -- in a charity event benefitting Breast Cancer. The Page Six editor will clean The Bloviator's clock. And  urlLink the Bassinger-Baldwin divorce  will become the latest acrimonious slice o shadenfreude to clutter the media landscape.  " urlLink Giselle Bundchen  will dump  Leo  for  Ashton .    " urlLink Renee Zellwegger  will stop sucking lemons before turning in a performance.  " Michael Jackson  will flee to Morocco, get a  urlLink villa in Marakesh , and harass little boys unmolested by the local culture until extradited back to the US.  " MTV  will cancel  The Real World .  " Bill Murray  will win Best Actor and deliver the best speech in Oscar history.  " Brendan Frasier  will release more bombs this year than the Iraqi resistance.  " Lauryn Hill  will engage in a lonely,  Kierkegaardian  crusade against the Roman Catholic Church.  " Graydon Carter  and  Sophia Coppola  will date.  " Ashton Kutcher  and  Leo diCaprio  will get into a fistfight.   Christina Aguilera  will pose nude for "Playboy.  " J_Lo  and  Ben Affleck  will get married after their film  urlLink Jersey Girl  crosses the $100 million mark.   " John Stewart  will be tapped to replace  David Letterman  at the expiration of his contract.  "Page Six's  Richard Johnson  will host a weekly pop culture roundtable on Fox News Channel.  " VH1  will give  Mo Rocca  a Late Night talk show.  " John Edwards  will win the South Carolina Democratic primary making him the Anyone-but-Dean candidate that  Terry McAuliffe  and the Clintonistas will rally around.  " Dick Cheney  will leave the ticket due to "heart concerns" opening it up for fellow Yalie  George Pataki.  Pataki will back Rudy for Governor of New York and the Dems may lose New York and another shot at the White House.  " Jayson Blair  will be tapped to write a cover  Michael Jackson  interview for  Vanity Fair .  " Bill Clinton  will finally accept a $50 million a year deal to host an Oprah-like talk show with world leaders, CEOs, journos and religious figures as guests for CBS."   Of course , I will let you all know -- ad nauseum -- every time I get it right. And, of course, if I am way off no mention of it will be made.  ( Update : I guess I'll be off on the Bennifer wedding, huh?)

       Man Versus Beast II   Although  The Corsair  is your average (okay,  obsessively creepy   in restraining order terrain) brand of media observer,  urlLink Man versus Beast   failed to register on my finely tuned media radar.  Now,  Michael Starr  of the  urlLink NY Post informs us that Man Versus Beast II  is in the cut. -- What the fuck?!   (whistles slowly)  Jesus H. Christ ,   is this for real ?  Yes, yes (buries head in hands) my little pomegranates, it is.  Starr writes:  " urlLink Bam Bam the orangutan , who's ignited controversy over his role on the  NBC  soap ' urlLink Passions ,' is heading into the reality TV arena - as a contestant on Fox's 'Man vs. Beast 2,' which airs Feb. 20 (9 p.m.).   "Bam Bam (a male who plays  urlLink Precious , a female nurse on 'Passions') will participate in a 'Man vs. Beast' challenge against NCAA gymnast/rings champ  urlLink Marshall Erwin , trying to see who can endure the longest while hanging 11 feet off the ground.   "Other 'Man vs. Beast 2' challenges include  urlLink Morgan the black Labrador retriever  facing off against All-American long jumper  urlLink Bryan Clay , and  Jacob , a chimpanzee who'll see if he can climb a 40-foot palm tree faster than champion tree climber  urlLink Kap Teo-Tafiti ."  Now, I believe that democracy is the highest form of government, offering the largest amount of freedom to its populace. From these freedoms flow the particular pursuits of our happiness.   I came here from a  urlLink dicatorship in Uganda , and there is nothing -- nothing -- that I  urlLink hate more than tyranny . I am glad  urlLink Sadaam Hussein  is locked away like a dog.  That having been said, if this type of programming is getting on, perhaps our democracy is getting a bit ill and  we had best look to it .   There are whiffs of  urlLink imperial Roman decline  surrounding the broadcast of Man Versus Beast II.

       Stupid Ass of the Century: Courtney "Love"   From an interview with  urlLink Courtney Love  on  urlLink WKQX-FM ,  Sound Opinion , with  Jim DeRogatis  and  Bill Wyman , as recounted in  urlLink Milk It  regarding a Vanity Fair September 1992 story:  "I did take heroin when I was pregnant in the very beginning of my pregnancy. I did-- otherwise I could have sued the hell out of ( Vanity Fair )  (But  Lynn Hirschberg  was) completely wrong. She made it seem like I was taking drugs into my  second  trimester."  Thanks for clearing that up, Courtney.  And as if that isn't bad enough, TheSmokinggun drags her legal issues into the sunlight. They write:  "According to the ... complaint, filed last month in Santa Barbara Superior Court, Love has stiffed  Cappello & McCann  for work the firm did during her two-year legal fight with  Universal Music Group . According to a recent account statement, after paying an initial retainer of $50,000 when she retained the firm in February 2001, Love has run up a six-figure bill that she has ignored. The nonpayment suit is the latest civil action faced by Love, who has defended cases brought by former employees, an ex-landlord, and a Hawaiian spa. Not to mention those pesky drug charges. A Love lawyer, who had not seen the new complaint, declined comment on the  Cappello & McCann  charges."  Celebrity most likely to wind up in jail,  anyone ?

       In other words ... BAPS Sucked   Hollywood is a place where  urlLink nuanced language  and delicate diplomacy is needed in offering up a critique of your betters. Egos run amok in Tinseltown, you know, and slights are remembered and held against you. Aint that a bitch?   Anyhoo : when something called  urlLink Screenwriter Magazine  asked  urlLink Troy Beyer  to take responsibility for her role in bringing  urlLink BAPS  to fruition, arguably the most offensive piece of shit ever to pass through the sordid bowels of the studio system, she was a little ...  put off ; anyway, you can decipher what she means for yourself:   Screenwriter : ( urlLink BAPS ) was your first script and you handed it over to someone else to direct. Was that difficult?   Troy : Well, first I was really excited that (New Line) wanted to make the movie. I knew that if the movie was going to be made, I would need a director attatched and so, initially I was like, 'Great,  Robert Townsend , he's cool, he's funny, he did  urlLink Hollywood Shuffle'  And then I realized that Robert had one interpretation of how the movie should look and as I writer, I had another vision."

       Liz Rosenberg Reads Vanity Fair    urlLink Jeannette Walls of MSNBC's Scoop  reports on the mini feud that has erupted between geeky  Simon Cowell , and  Madonna .  Cowell, you'll recall, last week said, “Madonna used to be good looking. [Now] she’s a housewife.”  And in response,  Liz Rosenberg , who gets paid the big bucks to spin Madonna's every move, responded:  “I’ll have to quote from a philosopher whose name I don’t know, ‘You should only hate people you love. The rest of them are not worth the energy.'"  Which is a sort of  so-so line , all things considered, although it was wittier when  Michael Caine  used the line in response to his Proust questionnaire in VF this month.   Is that all that Madonna's scrilla pays for? Recycling Old Brit lines to counter Old Brits?

       Dennis Miller Has Hairplugs!   Born Again Republican  Dennis Miller  reveals to  Jim Nelson  of that significant cultural artifact  urlLink The National Enquirer  that he does  indeed  have hair plugs. He  weaves  ... I mean, ahem, he  writes :  "'It's one operation they've got down pat. Nobody has a clue I had it done until I tell them,' explains the comedian, adding that the procedure is practically painless.   "But why would an arch-cynic like Miller, one of the longtime bad boys of comedy, go in for such a public display of vanity?   "'I've been known for having a head of hair,' he says, 'and when you've been a pisser like I have on TV for so many years, there's nothing your critics would delight in more than watching you go slowly bald.   "'Quite frankly, I don't mind telling people I had it done, because I think a lot of guys out there would like to get hair plugs but are probably worried about what's involved. But it's a pretty easy operation.'   "In reality, Miller admits that the procedure has actually helped him feel better about himself. 'Who wants to be bald?' he laughs."  Oh, and we're laughing too, Dennis; and ... it's a  pisser .   The Corsair wonders if they used racehorse hairs, because Miller veered to the right faster than  urlLink Seabiscuit at the English Triple Crown !

       Blue Tang Clan?   From the latest issue of  urlLink Bizarre Magazine , a ...  bizarre  ... interview with  RZA , of the  urlLink Wu Tang Clan , and the scorer for  urlLink Kill Bill, Volume 1 . A little bit of eccentricity is expected with musicians, but this  urlLink Bobby Digital  takes it to a  whole  new level on the subject of silver,  Paris Hilton's  favorite color:    Bizarre : Is it true you take a silver supplement?   RZA : Oh yeah, I took  urlLink colloidal silver .  I did some research and it helps to eliminate certain viruses from your body. It goes back to when the  urlLink Black Plague  was in Europe. A lot of rich people wasn't affected because the rich people had silverware. And the atomic structure of silver has a vibration that fights off viruses.   Bizarre : Is it true it could turn you blue?   RZA :  urlLink That's what the FDA recently  said but I can't see how you could turn blue.  Of course, if it fucks with your blood ... I aint blue and my children aint blue. I take 10 days' supply at once, I don't take it every day. You take a 10 day course. When the anthrax scare came out it was good to take a 10 day course at that point. Then relax after that.   Bizarre : Why don't you just use silver cutlery?   RZA : I do. Oh yeah, I do. That's the best way, then every time your fork goes in your mouth a little bit of silver goes in your mouth. So ... I gotta go ...  ( Editor's Note : Do not try this at home. According to the FDA, "The indiscriminate use of colloidal silver solutions has resulted in cases of argyria, a permanent blue-gray discoloration of the skin and deep tissues." So if RZA and his children are complected not unlike  Newport  second hand smoke in the next few weeks, or, rather, that they look bluer than Picasso's Blue period, they were being a little ...  indiscriminate )

       Johnny Rotten Sells Out   Punk was all about ugliness back in the day, but nowadays things are getting  uglier  than usual, especially in Britain. Punk Icon  urlLink Johnny Rotten  has not only agreed to do a cheesy reality tv show, but he has agreed to do a really bad one, namely:  urlLink 'I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here .'  "The announcement made me feel instantly old. ... If it has come to this for the prince of punk, then mediocrity really does get us all in the end," said  Lee Randall  in  urlLink The Scotsman .   The British, who particularly idolize Rotten, are  urlLink especially irked .   "I'm gobsmacked," said  Tony Wilson , a British journalist and music entrepreneur who knows Lydon, according to  urlLink CNN . "I'm shocked, but I have faith ... I'm sure he's doing it for the right reasons."   Suuure: I mean, what's a bloke to do? First  urlLink Mick Jagger, the devil whom we all had sympathy for, whores his geriatric ass out  and joins the  bloody aristos  ... and now  The Antichrist Hisself ! Damned cheek!  Along with Rotten on the UK show will be fighter  Razor Ruddock , who was  urlLink once told by Mike Tyson ,  “I’m gonna make you my girlfriend ... I can’t wait for you to kiss me with those big lips of yours.”  Nice . Also rounding out the cast will be topless model, urlLink  Jordan .   What  is this world coming to? A  Fellini  movie?

That  Index Magazine.   Anyhoo :  Rachel Horovitz  interviews  Susan Sarandon  and comes away with this tasty morsel:   Rachel Horovitz : How do you feel about Hillary Clinton?   Susan Sarandon : Hate her! The only thing she's going to be remembered for is standing by her man, and that is really sad. She had a shot, and she really blew it. She gave Bush the keys to the car while wagging her finger and saying 'you better not drive it, because we're going to be watching.' She turned out to be just another politician, which was really disappointing. I also think she lost a lot of support. I know a lot of people who write very large checks who have told her, 'That's it for us, don't come back.'

       Dreaming of Picasso   "I was deeply depressed and dreamed of  urlLink Picasso  ... we were swimming in the sea and he had his back to me. I wanted to turn around and head for shore because the sky had grown overcast and the waves had started to swell. I realized how far out we were and when I lost sight of  Picasso  I panicked. Suddenly, I saw a face emerge from the boiling, menacing waves. It was Picasso's bald head with it's monks crown of white hair, his brown robust shoulders and powerful arms swimming, swimming, and cutting the leaden-colored waves in sharp, powerful strokes. I shouted, 'I want to turn back!' And  Picasso  just shook his head and said, 'No! No!' and urged me to go on. But I was exhausted and started sinking."   urlLink Fellini  on  urlLink Picasso

       The Last Word on the Sharon Stone Crotch Shot    urlLink Index Magazine  finally puts to rest any questions about the infamous  urlLink Sharon Stone  money shot in  Basic Instinct  in an interview with the film's director,  Paul Veerhoven , a man named  Jost  and  urlLink Bruce la Bruce :   Bruce la Bruce : With the famous scene in youe sex-thriller  urlLink Basic Instinct , in which  Sharon Stone  uncrosses and crosses her legs, there have been rumors that she wasn't really aware of the camera angle.   Paul Veerhoven : I've been trying to set the record straight about this for years! (laughs) At different times, Sharon has said a lot of contradictory things, but my recollection of that scene has always been very consistent. The shot had been thoroughly discussed with her, of course. I was there with perhaps four people, including a boom man, and  Jost , the DP. She had told me that she wanted to work with a very small crew.  Bruce: That's standard for a scene of this nature, I would think.  Paul: Yes. So we shot it at around 7pm. And she saw all the angles, because we taped it. Since  Jost  and I are both Dutch, she was in the presence of two liberal people who would not be shocked by a shot like that. At the time, she had no problem with it.  Bruce: people have debated the scene endlessly -- one side says it's exploitative, while the other calls it the ultimate moment of pussy power. Essentially it made Stone a superstar.  Paul: During the filming, the atmosphere was very relaxed. When Sharon saw it in a theater for the first time, it was completely different. She brought in almost twenty people -- all kinds of managers, agents, and friends. I think they were affraid that the explicit shot would cancel out the strength of her star-making performance. So Sharon came up to me and said that she wanted it out.  Bruce: She had a history of doing nudity in her early films, didn't she?  Paul: I think she had done nudity before. She later said she was going to sue me, but of course she never did becuase she knew that she had agreed to it. In all honesty, she initially loved the scene becuase of how it symbolized female dominance.

This would force the couple - and Paxson's grandchildren - out of the home, of which Bud owns 59 per cent and Devon 41 per cent.

       The Chattering Class Virtual Year Book    Far be it from me , lowly blogger, to impede the progress of all the  primping  and  preening  that goes on among the chattering classes. I mean, they do deserve their time to waddle in the sun being as they explain reality to the rest of the world daily, via their nesting centers in NY, DC and LA, and occasionally  urlLink Davos  and Sundance.  Sometimes the chattering class appear to be unruly students at  urlLink J K Rowlings'  mythical  Hogwarts , struggling in childlike wonder with The Great Questions of Good and Evil --- naked ambition versus the ermine robes of state.  Imagine, if you will,  urlLink Eisner  or, say,  Michael Powell , as  urlLink Voldemortian  forces lying in wait in support of media consolidation! Not too much of a wizarding stretch, I hope.  Now,  take away the element of magic  and at other times, The Chattering Classes appear to be not unlike the  urlLink birds . Imagine if you will,  Barry Diller  a  urlLink heron , or  Anna Wintour  a  urlLink swan , pecking at a salad,  Jayson Blair  (averted gaze) a  urlLink turkey  ("performs distraction display") and  Harvey Weinstein  an  urlLink American Kestrel  ("Pale belly"). My bird's eye view. That's just how  The Corsair's  fevered media-oversaturated imagination works: all  wizards and warblers .  The Chattering Class render their ideas in varying forms of, uhm, media: sometimes they use the standard black and white print, often radio waves, other times tv, glossy mags are the usual, even mini studios--  whatever  the means of communication, there is some hawkish champion ready to express themselves, so, in the end, it is  difficult  to characterize The Mediaratti fully as the variety of media are matched only by the infinitude of styles and thought, limited only by the imagination; and, of course, I don't intend (or  pre tend) to be the last word on the matter-- neither as Hogwarts' sorting hat nor as Audubonian birder on the prowl.  Nor  do I, in any way, mean this to be a  complete list , but only a partial listing of those flapping wings who have crossed my radar screen.   So, like the snarky and chaotic (I think the very cool  urlLink Choire  called me absolutely mad, and I don't dispute that claim)  urlLink Gemini  that I am, allow me to mix my metaphors, combining Rowlings and Ravens, to try and draw a bede on these venerable birds.    Basta , now let's just coalesce all the necessary, fluttering data, my little pomegranates, and see if we cannot usher these rara avis into an aviary fitting for public  consumption , uhm -- only  urlLink the catty consume birds  -- public  observation .   And so , I present, as it were, on the fly, a virtual HS yearbook (the school song a martial, Murdochian anthem, possibly in  urlLink Mandarin Chinese ?), without the pictures:   For your pleasure ,  urlLink Rupert Murdoch  HS, Class of 2004 (stands at attention, hums anthem solemnly):   roll credits    Who's Who :   Barry Diller , Headmaster,  urlLink Dumbledoresque  mogul standing athwart  urlLink media consolidation  ... white  urlLink tailed tropic bird ("In pursuit of fish and squid, tropicbirds engage in graceful dives from the air.")   urlLink Don Imus  ... shifty-eyed leathery janitorial-type (think of the creepy Carl the Janitor in  urlLink The Breakfast Club ) ...  urlLink Masked Booby  ("a variety of hissing and quacking notes on breeding grounds") ...  urlLink Slytherin  ...

       Sammy Convalesces   " Sinatra  ... nursed ( Sammy Davis, Jr .) back to health and to performing agfain after the 1954 automobile wreck on the desert highway between Palm Springs and L.A. that cost him his eye.  "I have never seen anyone more caring and generous than Mr. S(inatra) in that crisis. He was the ultimate stand up guy. Despite his hatred for hospitals, he visited Sammy constantly in San Benardino Community Hospital and made sure he had the finest specialists braught in from L.A. to treat him. On a psychic level, he used his own comeback as the example that gave Sammy the strength to return to performing, bucking him up ever day and making one-eye jokes that somehow took the curse off Sammy's disability. Mr. S also used all his power to arrange Sammy's famous comeback engagement at  urlLink Ciro's on the Sunset Strip , and making sure that every big name in Hollywood was there on opening night to cheer Sammy on.  "Meanwhile he had installed Sammy in the Palm Springs house to recouperate and prepare for his fateful return engagement. Mr. S had me stay at the house to be at Sammy's service for the three weeks he was there, cooking whatever he dreamed of, rounding up the broads he dreamed of. I'd help him light his endless cigarettes until he could practice enough with his left eye  to get his field of vision straight. Sometimes, when he'd end up lighting the tip of his nose instead of the cigarette, he'd break down crying in frustration that he'd never get it back again. 'Shit, Sam,' I'd console him.'You get to see more out of your left eye than a thousand guys see outta two. You're gonna make it. Don't waste that good eye on fucking tears." And he'd stop, and try again, and soon he was striking up matches like old times."   urlLink Mr. S, My Life With Frank Sinatra , by  George Jacobs  and  William Stadiem

       These Lovely Bonesmen   "I remember, when I was a child, being taken to to the celebrated Barnum's circus, which contained an exhibition of freaks and monstrosities, but the exhibit on the programme which I most desired to see was the one described as 'The Boneless Wonder.' My parents judged that that spectacle would be too demoralizing and revolting for my youthful eyes ..."   Winston Churchill ,  urlLink Speech in The House of Commons , January 28, 1931"  A  Reagan  aide once referred to  George Bush , then a contestant for the Presidency, but eventually President number  41 , as, "a Yalie, a preppie, a sissy." Bush 41 was also, by the way, a Bonesman, like his father,  urlLink Prescott , and, his son,  urlLink George Bush , who eventually became President number  43 .  Now, what is  interesting  is the prospect that the front runner for the Democratic ticket is  John Kerry , also a Yalie, and also a Bonesman, albeit a  Botoxed  one. So, oddly, we have the prospect of two  Bonesmen  going at it skeleton-to-skeleton for the Presidency of the United States of America.   What does this all mean? Well,  for one  it means that should Kerry get the nod, every goddam network news program from here to Antarctica will do feature stories on  urlLink Skull and Bones .  2) From point one, we can make the logical leap to point two,  namely  that said feature stories will prompt every major crackpot in the world not on their medication with a theory on (makes quotation gestures into the air) "The New World Order" (secretive wink) will be flapping their gums.  urlLink Those Freaky Larouchies  will be foremost among the rabble, interrupting Presidential debates and causing all sorts of ruckus and  yam yam  with hand-drawn messages on cardboard.  3) Following from the rise of unmedicated freaks on our streets, bitter Yalie,  urlLink Alexandra Robbins ,  who was  not  tapped to be in Skull and Bones will continue her "Hell Hath No Fury Like a Woman Scorned" tour, railing against the secret society (and, subsequently, another generation of Bonesmen and women will wonder why they didn't just pick the whiny baby to get her off their backs).  4)  urlLink Native American Warrior Geronimo's skull  -- the Sacred Skull -- reportedly stolen by Bush patriarch Prescott will be mysteriously returned to the Apache tribe --  no questions asked .   5)  Tom Brokaw  will ask Kerry at the debate whether he can maintain the "Bones Code of Silence" and still run as a Middle Class populist. Also, at the same debate, it will be asked whether or not the  Russell Trust Association  bestows $15,000 on each Bonesman upon graduation, simmering resentments that the Democratic candidate has blood as blue as the Republican.  6) The next inaugural swearing in will have  Chief Justice Rehnquist  ending the ceremony by saying "By order of our order, I dub thee knight of Euloga."   Should be  interesting .

       Henry Rollins as Talk Show Host    I am not a fan , per se, of  Henry Rollins , although do I think that he is an interesting specimen of disaffected white urban aggression. I was never really a (makes bracket sign in the air) "punk" kid -- my childhood was a fairly happy affair. But if I were inclined to be punkish in temperament,  urlLink Rollins  would  not  be my punk icon.  urlLink He's a sell out , frankly. Rollins once said in an interview on the subject of  Madonna :  "Madonna recently put out a couple of platinum albums, a movie, a few videos and is well into an ass-whomping tour. The promoter here in Los Angeles estimates that she could have sold out The Forum three times over. 60,000 people? That is pretty substantial. This is not due to a fluke, a twist of fate or a miracle. Her movie, Desperately Seeking Susan is good. Her albums have well arranged, well executed tunes. The production is fantastic. Her videos are well done, very well done" (excerpted from  Madonna OK  in his collection of essays and spoken-word transcriptions  urlLink Polio Flesh ).   You see what I mean? -- he wants to be loved by The Music Establishment ... he desires to be on that Vanity Fair cover, in between  Quincy Jones  (although, he'd call him 'Q' ) and  Liz Phair , chuckling about a "crazy gig" the night before. He wants to be that man.  Badly . Rollins is perhaps the only somewhat talented musician in the industry who  craves Grammy's  for validity, and, more important than that, the  prime time real estate on network tv in which to speechify  after the fact.   His shifty puppy dog eyes and that air of aggression relay the odor of a bad childhood (which is  not his fault). But, on the bright side:  This is  a key  to celebrity: the desire for acceptance, the  need  for approval, the insatiable compulsion to make everyone pay attention to you.  Which leads me to the question -- why am I writing about Rollins? Well, I think Rollins could turn that unfulfilled ambition into a magnificent late night talk show, possibly for VH1.   No way!   Way.   Rollins has odd masculinity issues. He overcompensates. The tattoos. The sneer. The whole (makes sweeping bracket gestures in the air) "being typecast as a cop thing." It reeks of authority issues and the lack or overinvolvement of a male authority figure in his youth. Whatever the case, his pathology would feed into a late night talkshow marvelously.  Imagine Rollins interviewing, oh, say, Keith Richards. Imagine the puppy dog affectionate eyes that Rollins would throw his way. Now -- imagine how Richards might react? ... Priceless.  Now, imagine that Madonna would throw caution to the wind and allow herself to be interviewed by this mess of Ego and Id. Follow me? The need for approval by this Grande Dame of the music industry would make for some amazing tv. Again:  ... Priceless.  Let me not even throw  Ice Cube , or  Busta Rhymes , or  Justin Timberlake  into the mix.  And as we go to break, Henry could show some us some tats and rant with his band some dissonant post-punk music. Think of the audience: Men 18-34 would like to see this more than the unwatchable Jimmy Kimbell (someone please sink that Titanic). Come on VH1, add Henry Rollins: The Spoken Word to your line up.

       Victoria Gotti Gets It Wrong   I hope the Gotti family doesn't come after me for this (performs a  urlLink Capriole , dodging swingling meat hook). I  really  do. I am paranoid enough having just  published a compendium of the Bush Twins' underage drinking exploits without having to worry about a swarthy Sicilian man, sucking on a horsetooth, accosting me as I order my  urlLink life-giving Cutty Sark  from the neighborhood lounge.  A lot of journos make mistakes -- I know I have. The  Cindy Margolis-Tara Reid  catfight comes to mind, which, apparently, never happened, although  The Corsair  blogged overheatedly about what a sexy thing it would be (sorry). If only one could wish something so hard that it would actually be ...   Anyhoo : for  Victoria Gotti  -- incidentally, what are her qualifications to be urlLink  editor at American Media's Red Carpet ? I mean: other than a sordid last name -- to publish an uncorroborated interview with  JLo  is beyond th pale:  it's just wrong on so many levels .  I am stunned but not surprised that the New York media circuit is so  silent  on this matter. Well,  urlLink God Bless Page Six for taking it on, anyway.   Maybe we just do not think of Gotti as a  Jayson Blair  because The Star is  only  a celebrity rage and not  urlLink The Old Gray Lady . Maybe it is because Gotti (performs a rapid demi-pointe, then a side demi-pointe, gently extracting head from a vice) did it only one time and she is very new to this game and is busy with her reality show on urlLink  A & E  ( fuck!  Remember when  urlLink A & E  used to fun first class French art house flics?).  Page Six reports:  "'Obviously,  urlLink they did not have a sit-down interview to get two sentences . And obviously Victoria is in New York and J.Lo is in Los Angeles . . . [but] Victoria got the information in a stand-up way that was fact-checked and legaled.' Sources say Gotti wrung an innocuous quote out of the Lopez camp by pleading that she was under tremendous pressure from her notoriously tough boss, Star editorial director  Bonnie Fuller , to come up with scoops.'"  So maybe there is a lesson in there to Bonnie "The Slavedriver" Fuller, and to organizations like The Daily News, which made the quote the basis for a cover story, and maybe it is a lesson to Victoria Gotti (performs a sequito grave a tordiglione, thereby avoiding a flying baseball bat)  Now,  please don't have me sleep with the fishies ?

       Do 40% of the People Watch the Superbowl for the Ads?   "Super Bowl ads have become so big that 40% of the audience watching the game tunes in just for the ads," writes  Phyllis Furman  in  urlLink today's Daily News .   Say what?!  That cannot be right. "In fact, only 9 percent of adults plan to watch the game just for the ads, and that number is down from last year's 14 percent and at its lowest level in eight years, according to a new report from Baltimore advertising firm  urlLink Eisner Communications ," writes  A.J. Livsey   in  Media Life Magazine.   The interview continues: ?'This may be more of a reflection on the quality of the last few years of Super Bowl ads and the higher quality of advertising seen throughout the year than a reflection that the Super Bowl is a bad advertising investment,' says Eisner senior vice president  David Blum ."  Which reminds me of an interview I did years ago with  urlLink Macromedia CEO Rob Burgess . I asked his whether or not he was planning on a Superbowl ad. He responded, with a hardly concealed laugh that he was the CEO of a publicly traded company and there was  no way  he could justify to his shareholders spending millions on a minute of ad time.  And as a media-obsessed blogger there is no way I can justify the practice of watching the Superbowl just to see the commercials.

       Burn, Eisner, Burn   On his left flank, sitting upright, bolt straight, is  urlLink Roy Disney, Jr  -- The Popular One -- using the  urlLink bully pulpit of his name to call for Eisner's ouster . Filled with Old Testament thunder and the corporate family name, Roy Disney is a formidable opponent.   And on Eisner's right  is the surefire stock market plunge that Disney ( urlLink down 2.7%  at press time) will take after he misplaying hardball with Pixar ( urlLink up 3.3%  at press time) ...  urlLink a game so bitterly lost .  For years  urlLink I have dogged Michael Eisner's Simian ass .  He has been  ridiculous  in his dealings with  Pixar , which is the centerpiece, nay,  the pearl  of  urlLink Disney's animation  operation.  In point of fact , it is on the backs on profits eked from it's parasitic deal with Pixar that Eisner -- who holds onto the reins of power at Disney ("my  preciousss ") with the  urlLink tenacity of an African dictator  --  urlLink still has a fucking job .  Eisner was playing the prototypical  overmanly  Hollywood power game -- talk tough,  urlLink concede nothing , bully, hector and, when all else fails, threaten lawsuit -- on  Steve Jobs . You know, in Power Player fashion he was just fucking with Job's' head.   Why?   Dont ask me. But now Eisner, the rat who may sink Disney, has handed over to his competition a  sorely needed asset . And what would happen (takes out  The Corsair's  infamous crystal ball, spinkles some Haitian herbs, and says some juju) if Steve Jobs hammers out a deal with, oh, say ---  Jeffrey Katzenberg's   urlLink SKG ? Huh? What then, fucker?   I'll tell you what : Eisner's ego will have given his arch nemesis --  urlLink "the midget"  -- the tool needed to break Disney's animation back. Pixar's every victory over Disney will be fussed over by the Hollywood press and agonized over by shareholders who lost out becuase Eisner was looking out for his ego.  I could  easily  see Steve Jobs being  that vengeful a motherfucker  and SKG offering a very sweet deal indeed to indulge him. A sweet deal for Jobs but a bitter one for Eisner and a Cruella de Ville of a nightmare for Eisner's shareholders.  Here's what I wrote on November 19, 2003:   Why Is Eisner Still At Disney?   Wasn't November supposed to be the month that Eisner either showed some miraculous growth numbers for  urlLink Disney  or he was to be shown the door?  urlLink Sheesh . Will someone fire  urlLink Michael Eisner already !  We all know that he is antagonizing  Steve Jobs  and the guys at  Pixar  who are singlehandedly  urlLink saving Disney's bacon.    Michael Wolff  made an interesting comment on Eisner a while ago in his column in  New York .    Eisner has made himself indispensible at Disney. He has a large amount of shares and, like an African dictator, he has never groomed a succesor. So it would be hard to fire Eisner without greatly affecting the already bad stock price.  Sad that a public company has to be held hostage to the Hollywood tactics of a real punk like Michael Eisner. Will the Board of Directors react? only time will tell.

       Smackdown: Fox 411's Roger Friedman vs Vanity Fair's Maureen Orth   Fresh off of his mini feud with  Sharon Waxman  of  urlLink The New York Times , Fox 411's pugnacious scribbler  Roger Friedman  is now picking a bone with  urlLink Vanity Fair's Maureen Orth .  Friedman writes in 411:   " Vanity Fair  magazine issued a press release yesterday about their new  Michael Jackson  story, and the whole thing sounds pretty funny.   "It turns out that writer  Maureen Orth , whom I have cited before as lifting material from this column and other places in her recent Jackson reporting, got her latest scoops from  urlLink the National Enquirer .   "The Vanity Fair press release breathlessly announces that Jackson plied his 12-year-old accuser with wine and called it 'Jesus Juice.' Big news, indeed!"   Ouch . Friedman goes on to complain that Orth's news that Jacko gave sleeping pills and wine to the accuser came from  urlLink his November 19th story , but the quote Jesus Jusice came from the Enquirer.  Friedman goes for the jugular:  "But people's memories are short, and Orth's clip reading is deep. I think the National Enquirer -- which gets a lot of flack and is never taken seriously -- should go after Vanity Fair. "  Oh, Roger, come on now:  can't we all just get along ? Let's not all fight over the Jesus Juice. There's enough Jesus Juice for everybody.

       Angie, Pam Anderson and Howard    It was quite the threesome  this morning on  urlLink The Howard Stern Radio Show !  Stern, who has lately taken to boasting on air that he has taken over  Barbara Walter's  position at ABC, was in rare form today, reliving make out sessions  in studio  with two former Playboy Playmates.  First up was hottie  urlLink Angie Everhart , who was on promoting her  urlLink lingerie bowl superbowl halftime special .  As quick as  Rudy Giuliani  dropped his bad combover as a result of his newfound 9-11 street cred, Stern moved on to his relationship with the ex model. Apparently, Stern took a page out of Sean Penn's *alleged* bondage incident involving his then-wife Madonna ... *allegedly*.  Stern admitted to tying  Everhart  up and then leaving her alone in a hotel room. "You were bad," said Stern, by way of explanation. As the show progressed, Everhart hinted that she was  not quite pleased  about the incident. "I think I used scarves," the shock jock explained.  Everhart later said of her relationship with Stern, "it was tender ... except for that tying up thing." And concluding, "I got a wonderful friend (out of the relationship), I have no regrets."  And then came erstwhile  urlLink Jane Magazine  columnist   Pam Anderson .  Show producer  Gary Dell'abate  interrupted Angie and Howard to say that Anderson, an  urlLink animal rights activist ,  has spotted Everhart's fur lined Gucci coat in the green room. "The  b-word  might have been used," offered Dell' abate. "That's all right," replied Everhart,"she can be mad at me... she wears leather soled shoes,  doesn't she "  And with that, Anderson was quickly ushered into the studio. "(furriers) anally electrocute animals, and they're not even dead and they skin them," explained the former Playmate, in a stream of consciousness.  "I have  four dogs ,  a cat  and  a horse  and knowing that, it hurts," replied Everhart, also a former Playmate.   But it was all good  between the three after peace and animal rights were asserted on all sides, and the two realized that they had Howard Stern in common. Pam quickly asked about the sex.  "What's it like?" asked Pam.  " Good ," replied Everhart, girl-to-girl  and 10 million listeners.   "We kissed," replied Pam.  "--No tongue," added Howard.  "I'll remember it forever," concluded Pam, wistfully, "because he'll never let me forget."  And all this before my morning coffee.

       The Smoking Gun's On The Case   The intrepid folks at the uber court document of site of celebrity,  TheSmokingGun  report that the Sopranos made  urlLink Best Buy  an offer  urlLink they could not refuse .  According to the site:  "Eight cast members from  urlLink The Sopranos  will whack up a $1.5 million payout from the electronics chain as part of a confidential settlement of a legal beef,  urlLink The Smoking Gun has learned . Last January,  James Gandolfini ,  Edie Falco ,  Lorraine Bracco , and several co-stars filed suit over a  urlLink Best Buy newspaper ad  containing a photo of the cast posing on a New Jersey boardwalk. The actors alleged that the retail giant misappropriated their images. The case was closed out last month when the parties signed the below settlement agreement, which includes a pledge of omerta when it comes to specifics of the financial terms. The document does not indicate whether the boss, Gandolfini, gets a larger taste of those seven figures. But what's unclear is why four other cast members pictured in the Best Buy ad -- Dominic  Chianese  (Uncle Junior),  Aida Turturro  (Janice Soprano),  Drea de Matteo  (Adriana La Cerva), and  Joe Pantoliano  (Ralph Cifaretto)--did not join in the lawsuit or benefit from the settlement."  Then again, Best Buy  urlLink does not have the most spotless of records among consumer electronic stores . Ripoffreport.com has quite a few disgruntled reports of everything from  urlLink bad customer service  to  urlLink refusing to honor rebates .   Anyhoo :  TheSmokingGun  offers  another  interesting piece of data. Yeah, yeah, I'm sure that you heard about  urlLink James Brown's latest brush with the law re: domestic violence  --- pfft . But did you see the freaky misspelled ad that  urlLink James Brown had published in Variety last July ?   The Corsair  wasn't around last July, or maybe I was just rollin' down the street smokin' endo sippin' on " urlLink Jesus Juice ," but the ad reads, in part:  "Due to Mr. James Brown and  urlLink Tomi Rea Brown's  heavy and demanding tour schedule, they have decided to go their seperate ways. There are no hard feelings, just a mutual show business decision made by both parties."  The decision was made "for the benefit of their  carriers " I think he meant careers. In the accompanying photo,  James Brown ,  Tomi Rea Brown ,  James Joseph Brown II , are all smiling at Walt Disney World posing with Goofy.

       Apprentice Want to Tear Trump's Hair Out    urlLink Apprentice  contestant and firee  Sam Solovey , a one time interactive media vet, told  urlLink Media Life  that he wanted to "crawl across the table and pull the hair out of  Donald Trump's head " when he first heard that he was fired.  "I was devastated.   "In the back of my mind I saw it coming, but the reality of the moment was overwhelming. I had never heard those words before and they physically hit me --l ike getting shot between the eyes."  He concluded, "I have a sense of humor about the whole experience and realize that this is probably going to be my 15 minutes of fame.   "I've got about three minutes left. There are no delusions of grandeur from this contestant."  Actually I count  1.5 minutes  left, but just so we are all on the same page ...

       The Youth Gone Wild   That significant cultural artifact,  Star Magazine  today comes out with a compendium of  urlLink the wild and crazy antics of the daughters of President Bush , usually involving booze. And while those antics are completely normal to any red blooded American kid (please don't send the secret service on me), the twins Jenna and Barbara have their fun with the involvement of a  considerably greater cash flow  than you or me.  urlLink David Caplan  writes, "'They both really like to have fun,' says  Ann Gerhart , author of urlLink  The Perfect Wife , a new book about First Lady  Laura Bush . 'But Laura Bush really adores their energy and spirit.'  Some of that energy and that spirit:  "In October of 2000, as a freshman at  Yale University  in New Haven, Conn., Barbara was caught attempting to use a fake I.D. at a local watering hole,  urlLink Toad's Place . "She was polite, but she definitely argued with me to get it back," said the staffer who busted her.  "In spring 2001, Barbara Bush and some pals gave the Secret Service agents the slip while driving from Yale to New York City to attend a wrestling match.  'There's been animosity between the twins and the Secret Service from the beginning,' author Gerhart tells Star. 'They wanted their freedom.'  "Cops spotted Jenna and some friends drinking during the early hours of April 27, 2001, at  urlLink Cheers Shot Bar  in Austin, Tex., and handed her a citation. At the time, the First Lady's spokeswoman said, 'We respect the privacy of this young woman and we're not going to comment on her personal life.'  "On May 29, 2001, Texas police charged Barbara with underage drinking, and Jenna with trying to use a false I.D at  urlLink Chuy's restaurant in Austin . Both cases were dismissed after the girls each paid $100 fines and performed community service.  "While vacationing in St. Tropez, France in July 2002, Jenna and a pair of gal pals headed to the tony resort town's trendy  urlLink Caves du Roy  nightclub, where they reportedly polished off a $225 bottle of vodka and a bottle of tequila. While considered underage in the U.S., they were of legal drinking age in France. C'est la vie.  "On June 26, 2002, then-under-age Barbara and Jenna were seen kicking back Budweisers and chain-smoking cigarettes with a group of friends well past midnight at  urlLink Stetson's , a Texas-themed bar in Washington, D.C.  "The twins met  Ashton Kutcher  and a pal a couple of years ago at a Nike party and headed back to Ashton's place. 'The Bushes were underage drinking at my house,' Ashton later told a reporter.  "In August 2003, Barbara kicked back shots at a birthday celebration for a fellow Yale grad at the trendy NYC haunt  urlLink Capitale . The group's final tab? $1,100."  And while, of course, there is nothing wrong per se with underage drinking (legalese be damned!), the twins do it in trendy spots in DC, NY and Saint Tropez while hanging with A-List celebrities, while  The Corsair  did it in a bodega in Manhattan while cutting classes. And there were no $225 bottles of tequila involved here, my little pomegranates, no: I was all about the 40s of  urlLink Olde English 800  at 17. I'm olde school like that.  Gee,  urlLink the rich are different

       Halle Berre Collides With Equipment    I don't know why , but beautiful people are often clumsy. It is almost as if their ethereal natures are meant for more rarified air than that which exists here. So, trapped in the musty atmosphere of planet earth, they appear clumsy and fragile.   urlLink Winona Rider  fractured her arm during those shoplifting trials. Then Berry broke her arm while filming  Gothika , and even before that  urlLink injured her eye  shooting  Die Another Day .   urlLink CNN.com  says:  "The accident was minor, Everett said Tuesday, denying reports that the Oscar-winning Monster's Ball actress was hit in the head with a microphone boom and spent six hours in a hospital waiting room."  Three lives, six more to go, Catwoman.  Maybe the Catwoman suit should be armored?

       Courtney Cox Pays Up   The fellas at  urlLink TheSmokingGun  have done it again. They post documnets from a case settled by  Courtney Cox  in the "fraudulent conveyance" case of that Jagged Little Pill,  Dana Giacchetto .   urlLink TheSmokingGun  writes:  "Cox is the latest celebrity to settle a 'fraudulent conveyance' lawsuit brought by the court-appointed trustee overseeing the financial  urlLink ruins  of  urlLink The Cassandra Group , once headed by the thieving Giacchetto, a felon who once called Tobey Maguire and Leonardo DiCaprio friends. In August 2000, Giacchetto pleaded guilty to defrauding his lesser-known clients of millions and diverting some of those funds to A-list clients like Cox,  Cameron Diaz , and  Alanis Morissette  (the stars unwittingly believed the money represented legitimate investment returns). Giacchetto spent 28 months in federal custody for his swindles."  damn.     Anyhoo : in the text of the six pages of snooze inducing chlorofom, we learn that  urlLink Courtney's middle name is Bass .

       Ron Jeremy Gets Tammy Faye's Phone Number   It must be a slow week of shadenfreude for  urlLink National Enquirer , which reports that adult film "star"  Ron Jeremy  and the wife of a disgraced televangelist,  Tammy Faye Messner , are "bosom buddies."   EEeeeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwwww!    Rick Egusquiza  writes:  "The pair discovered they had more in common than they ever dreamed of after their initial meeting on  urlLink the WB reality show , which features a strange assortment of celebrities living together.   "'Tammy Faye was a living doll,' Jeremy told The ENQUIRER in an exclusive interview. 'She's a real cutie.   "'I wasn't expecting that a Jewish adult filmmaker and a televangelist would click, but we did!   "'Even though Tammy is very religious, she's got a live-and-let-live attitude. She'll never endorse pornography, but that's O.K. We frequently discussed religion, and I would smack somebody if they ever tried to take her Bible away.   "'Tammy's also got a great laugh -- and we even danced together. I respect her and vice-versa. We were so close that whenever Tammy got emotional and her tears started flowing, I felt like crying, too.'  Egusquiza continues:   "Jeremy, 50, also reveals he had a very special wake-up service during filming of the show.   " 'Erik Estrada  would wake me up each morning with a cup of coffee and a song.'  "As for the future of his friendship with 61-year-old Tammy Faye, Jeremy reveals to ENQUIRER readers: 'I have her phone number and we'll be keeping in touch. Who would have thought?'"   urlLink Fellini.

       Conde Nast's Disappointing Style   When I think of  Conde Nast  several dominant characteristics immediately pop into mind. One,  glamour . Two, a dearth of African Americans on staff. Three,  style .  So, in passing over my second objection and focusing on the third, it is surprising to me that on the style count, Conde was a bit lacking in regards to their big send off of  urlLink Steve Florio  at the final publisher's meeting in Key Largo, Fla.   For one,  Kevin Kelly  of the New York Post  urlLink informs us that :  "The music for the dinner dance on the final night was supplied by KC and the Sunshine Band, still going strong after 30 years."  What-the- fuck ?   urlLink KC and the motherfucking Sunshine Band ?! Not  urlLink Parliament  or even  urlLink Chicago ? Did  S.I. Newhouse Jr ., chairman of Conde Nast "shake-shake-shake ... shake"  shake his booty ?   Well, no he didn't; in fact he wasn't there, but in his place, Kelly writes, "(Newhouse) made sure his CEO for the past 10 years went out with a bang by presenting him with a Steuben crystal sculpture on black marble."   Hmm . Okay: at the risk of exposing an until now dormant metrosexuality, wouldn't  urlLink Lalique crystal  have been the better gift? And wouldn't the guys at Conde Nast be well aware of something like that ? Since when has  The Corsair  been the one to correct the arbiters elegentiae at Conde Nast on their sense of  glassware ?

       Stop With The Fucking Text Messages!   ( Update : The most excellent  urlLink Rush and Molloy report  that both Kidman and Cruise's PR people deny that the incident took place)   urlLink Britain's 3AM Girls  give us an interesting scoop about the cold front that exists between Cold Mountain helmer  Nicole Kidman  and her ex husband  Tom Cruise .    Sure , their break up was bitter, leaving Kidman adrift in a sea of sharkish paparazzi, not to mention  urlLink Lenny Kravitz . But who knew that after all these years there is still, well,  rage .  Apparently Cruise was writing Kidman unsolicited text messages.  The 3AM gals write:  "Cold Mountain star Nicole, who lost out to  Charlize Theron  in the best actress category, marched up to Tom and snapped: 'Can you please stop sending me those stupid f***ing text messages?!'"   Oh, it's on like   urlLink Grey Poupon !  They continue:  "Startled Tom, who also missed out on a gong for his performance in  The Last Samurai , hissed: 'Not here, Nicole!'  "The furious exchange left onlookers stunned and is bound to shatter the myth that, despite their divorce, the couple remain the best of friends."   The Corsair  leans towards screen, riveted  "'It all happened so quickly,' a shocked witness tells us."  The Corsair shakes his media addled head, knowingly:  doesn't it always ?  " 'Nicole went up to Tom and it looked like they were just going to have a catch-up chat. But Nicole had an ice-cold look on her face. She grabbed his hand, squeezed it and then started telling him that she was fed up with his texts and wanted them to stop.  "Tom made it clear that it was neither the time or place for such a conversation. He didn't want to be drawn into a public slanging match. Everyone was talking about it afterwards. It's not every day you get the biggest names in Hollywood bickering like teenagers.  "Goodness knows what the texts said but they left her with steam coming out of her ears. The fact that she didn't win anything at the awards can't have helped."   And so , in snarky fashion, here are some  possible  text messages that Tom  may have  sent to Nic:  1) That dress does not flatteringly expose your  urlLink cold mountains   2) The Best Actor in a Drama category, which you have duly announced, is an almost complete chronicle of your romantic life during the past year. Does that offer you any  personal insights ?  3)  urlLink Charlize  brings off yellow better than you do.  4) Lose the  urlLink headband   5) Where's  urlLink Lenny ?  Oh Nicole, I love you,  but how could I resist ?

       Lloyd Grove is Getting Stronger   There is no question about it,  urlLink Lloyd Grove's Lowdown  is improving. I mean, no, it's not the consistently solid  urlLink Rush and Molloy  or the magnificent  urlLink Page Six , but it is consistently okay, which is much better than it was a few months ago.    So, Media Life asked Grove which recent stories have provoked the most reaction, he answered:  "I probably have done between 300 and 400 items since I started the column, but some standouts that come to mind are: scooping the world on  Gwyneth Paltrow's  pregnancy, ripping the cover off the sexually explicit  Abercrombie and Fitch Quarterly , and reporting  Kerry Kennedy Cuomo  reading the riot act at Michael's to  Dan Klores  over his spinning of her split from Andrew.  I know,  I know  I was hard on our man Grove. On November 13th, I actually wrote:  "Lloyd Grove Job watch  How long do you think Lloyd Grove will survive in this town if he recycles old Jackie Kennedy gossip about her priest/confidante?  "I mean,  The Corsair  loves  Rush and Molloy . Those guys know how to hustle and get the scoop. And of course  The Corsair  loves  Page Six . But Lloyd Grove is the worst. I don't think I have ever read something that made me widen my eyes in wonder.   " The Corsair  gives Grove another two months before the mercurial  Mort Zuckerman  sends him packing back to K Street."  Ouch (cringes). How does one correct such a wicked post? To paraphrase  urlLink Chicago , sweet Lloyd:  "Everybody needs a little time away, I heard her say,  from each other  / Even lover's need a holiday far away from  each other /"   Hold me now . It's hard for me to say I'm sorry. I just want you to stay."   Keep on keeping on , Lloyd

       My Trio   reprinted: January 10th:  I suppose  Time Magazine's   Joel Stein  is an  urlLink okay kind of guy . I've never met him. He seems to have a  bit  of a wit, however  dry , for someone who works at  Time Magazine , the world's capitol of gravitas  and all that . In the end, though, there is nothing wrong with Joel Stein that a robust  multivitamin  couldn't remedy. But what was he thinking when  Trio TV  gave him the  urlLink gig of a lifetime ? I mean, who wants to watch endless hours of  Battle of the Network Stars ?  I mean,  seriously , who even watched Battle of the Network stars back then, when  Telly Savalas  and  Gabe Kaplan  had  juice  and ruled the roost? Not  me : and I was ever the hip 6 year old with emergent media antennae outstretched towards the avant garde world of  urlLink Schoolhouse Rock's Figure Eight  song on the melancholy of infinity and  urlLink The Land of the Lost .   Now, If  Laura Zalaznick  of Trio Tv called  The Corsair  tommorrow (call me, Laura, call ...  me  ...) and asked: What low budget high quality shows would you program for Trio TV? Remember, we only have a fraction of the network budgets, but we want high quality. I would say: Laura,  have you ever read my blog? I am all about low budget high quality.    Anyhoo : These are some of my picks:   Dummy .  urlLink Gritty 70s drama  of urban social decline -- thanks,  Ed Koch !  Asshole ! Back in the Koch day, NYC was all pimps with straightrazors and greaser glue sniffing graffiti punks roaming the streets in search of ultraviolence. Koch turned NYC into a  Guns n Roses  video, with  Mr. Brownstone  creeping around Central Park in a raincoat with nothing on underneath! Get  this  plot, though, peeps:  LeVar Burton  plays a  deaf  and  dumb  mute who is framed for the death of a prostitute (Kuta Kinte, you are a  framed  man!). But will we get  justice  for the amiable host of  urlLink Reading Rainbow ?    Anyhoo : Will a young  Paul Sorvino  get him redemption when he cannot even communicate with his morose client? Or will "Dummy" just become another urban statistic on the Koch street?  Despite the overall bleakness, this a very,  very  cool slice of social commentary.    Masterpiece Theater: Last of the Mohicans . No, not the cheesy  Michael Mann  MTV video with  Daniel Day Lewis  and  Madeline Stowe  overproduced romance to the lowest common denominator.  No , this one was the  real deal .  The French and Indian War , my little pomegranates. Colonial wars involving trappers and Native Americans dressed in coonskin and caribou, muskets at the ready. The Massachusetts Bay Colonizers  and what not . Dodgy alliances based on mutual interests, snow and the fate of North America -- we're talking  the French and Indian War,  people , work with me here . The  drama , fo' shizit. For some bizarre reason the Masterpiece Theater programs made in the 70s -- arguably the best programming of all time -- languish in someone's vault,  uncherished  and unsung. American history geek? (raises hand sheepishly)  Present .   Alice:  I've always wondered if this was a  comedy  or a  tragedy , or perhaps that significant 70s artistic construct, the (flexes fingers) "dramedy."  Single mom who sings Bradway showtunes working to support her kid in Arizona on diner tips.  Fuck ! It's a hard knock life.   I'd imagine that singing "There's a New Girl In Town" ought to really get those coffee refil tips into the bathysphere out there in  Phoenix . I'm sure the serial killer truck drivers en route to the Pacific Northwest on one hours sleep, a thermos full of coffee, tweaking from the crank with a meat cleaver under the diner stool are really  up  and  around  to hearing broadway medley's a la Our Alice,  no ? "How about a little Irving Berlin whilst I carve up the dingy broad" -- "might I suggest a breathless version of  urlLink Marie from Sunny Italy ?"   Better yet ,  Alice Hyatt , thou repository of the standards of  urlLink The Great White Way , stick with Florence "Flo" Castleberry's crafty  urlLink weltanshauung : a leathery-Southwestern oversexed outlook on truckstop flings and a pipin hot "kiss my grits!" for the cheapskates.   Imagine  if that show were pitched  nowadays . Only  David Lynch  would know what to do with it. Without the laugh track, Alice could  easily  be an American drama drenched in pathos, like  Dreiser's   Sister Carrie  --only more chilling. Take away the laugh track, throw in some creepy Lynchian music, or maybe some  urlLink John Cage , and you've turned a dramedy into  Americana horror . In all likelihood, Alice would end up on the evening news having sung ill-advisedly some Mel Torme to a guy who insisted that he "was not the one."  Lil' Tommy would be shackin up with the crank smoking Vera faster than Mel could re-lard his pork chops or Flo could pitch woo in her mobile home. No ...  urlLink Alice doesn't live here anymore .  Don't even get us started on the great  Vic Tayback  banging the pick up bell with his spatula like the true character actor he was. Dating those seedy Phoenix chicks well past their expiration date. A diner owner is royalty in the A-Z, you better recognize! Americana horror is the genre. May  Mel Sharples  rest in a  urlLink greasy kind of peace .  Pink  uniforms, ah, Mel, read much  de Beauvoir ?  Just looking back I cannot believe I just wrote this much about Alice the tv show (holds his head in shame)   Rich Man Poor Man:  Observe  Nick Nolte  before the fermented grape robbed him of his marginal looks, then again,  there is charm in Nolte's  urlLink whiskey ravaged grim visage . If Nolte can be a star then so, dammit, can anyone. Earns props for  Teachers , slo.  He counts . In both North Dallas 40 and Teachers Nolte plays a disenchanted member of the middle america with his job. He was a Gephardt man before his time, methinks.   Poldark:   This cult British tv series is quite habit forming. Incredible. Just  urlLink incredible . A period piece that is a cross between  Wuthering Heights ,  the Mayor of Casterbridge  and  Le Liaisons Dangereuse  but with a compelling soap opera character at its heart. A guilty high quality pleasure. You get sucked in to this costume drama that is one part Danielle Steele and one part high art.   Assorted Good Times episodes:  Come on, you know you had a crush on  Wilona  ("and you too, Wilomena" said the archetypical corrupt pol,  Alderman Davis ) when you were kid, didn't you; or, if you were a girl,  Bookman the janitor  was your  long, cold drink of water .  What, you never saw a black man doing a John Wayne impression,  pilgrim ? And you know in your heart Wilona saved  Janet Jackson  from falling down that elevator shaft while trying to escape her mom who beat her with a hot iron just before she became Willis' girl, then  Cleo  on Fame, then the ill-starred Ms. deBarge.  Remember the episode where Michael gets crunk off some dodgy ghetto "health tonic" (aka muscatel)  urlLink classic  ("Get Vita Brite and sleep tonight" ...*promptly passes out*).   Then there was the time Michael joined a gang and hid his jacket in the oven. Oh, what about the one where Thelma almost married this polygamist Nigerian cat.  Crazy ! What about that  pimpy  guy "Lennay," who always sold  hot  appliances from out of his coat. Classic. So was the episode when James has hypertension. So was ...  hey  ... was this  urlLink a comedy or what ?   Cinema Paradiso . The best work of art on the subject of friendship I've ever encountered. A glorious film.   urlLink Fellini's Satyricon . A pagan work. Un-be- fucking -lievable: creativity on a galactic scale. The Rablasian Fellini walks us through Roman antiquity as he imagines it, crossed with highbrow science fiction sequences of an imagined future. There can never be anyone as Felliniesque as Fellini. The soundtrack alone is mindblowing.   The Big Blue Marble:  My favorite show as a kid,  if you must know .   Carl Sagan's Cosmos:   Okay, so in the madcap world of astrophysics  urlLink Sagan's hypotheses are probably all outmoded already . Right? So  what ? So is  Ptolemy's Almagest , and yet I still read it in college and gained benefit. The provocative thinking is worth another looksie; and, of course, worthy of more questions in light of our current data. This series was  the bomb ! (looks around sheepishly, then raises hand, "question: who is the  PBS  geek"?) Classics are never outmoded.    urlLink Chespirito . This show was a mystery to me: Why would a grown Latin man want to go on tv dressed like a bumble bee with a big "CH" affixed to his paunch. Subtitle it and put it on Trio; I'd watch it just to clarify a childhood mystery. Why is everyone else laughing but me on this one? We'd all like to know what the people on that endless laugh track find so funny.   urlLink Stoned, the Afterschool Special with Scott Baio . "Super Stoned Jack," was the scariest introduction that most of us had to the world of the sweet leaf. Sensimila? Not if you have any sensibilities! If I were  stoned  I would never go out in a row boat on some grey and greasy river. Well, certainly not after seeing this little chestnut. Put it on Trio so we can all laugh at the "reefer madness." Just say  yes  to the Farah Fawcett haired Felicity. But I'm sure skeevy New York Times writer  Neill Strauss  will.   Fame the TV Series : Why are there not repeats on  VH1  of this show already? When you say low budget and high quality I think ..  right here's where you start paying for it ... with pain ... and sweat . The show of young, artistic people struggling for their moment to shine is about as American as it gets. Whatever happened to that sexy cello player who wouldn't give anyone the time of day,  urlLink Lori Singer . I was all about the emotional cellist Lori Singer back in the day.   Cries and Whispers  by  Ingmar Bergman . If Black Stallion is the most beautifully shot film, then this is number two. All natural lighting. Bergman uses a fade to red to seperate scenes, mimicking the inner membrane of our eyelids. About as fucking intense as art can get. And halfway through this film about communication and treachery and time past, Bergman dissolves a reconcilliation scene with a Bach Sarabande in the most mysterious manner imaginable.    Schoolhouse Rock:   That Figure Eight . Mysterious, melancholy and mathematically instructional. Time will never again be so mundane. A strong influence on  The Corsair's  childhood.   The Black Stallion:  Those fabulous Copollas! This is perhaps the most beautiful filmed movie ever.   The Gore Vidal-Bill Buckley Debate-Fight  It was in the heart of the 60s: the polarized political center of the 60s. The left and the right clash violently  on national television . In the  news division  of a  respectable network .  Fuck!  A  classic . I just finished reading Vidal's Burr, BTW.  Excellent . And of course Buckley's role as Grandfather of the American movemenet is secure. For a moment, our two leading intellectuals of our two political polarities went at it in a bareknuckled intellectual fistfight. Not since  urlLink Burr shot Hamilton dead  has there been so much political drama in The Republic.   Woody Allen's Teleplay:  Don't Drink the Water .  One of the  urlLink most interesting  experiments on television ever.  Woody Allen  directs and writes a teleplay starring  Michael J Fox  and the kid who played  Blossom . Shaky handheld camera follows a grown Michael J. Fox as he slowly becomes involved with a bright but much younger woman. How the fuck did this get on American and not Parisian tv? Aren't we supposed to be puritainical? Did Woody Allen have so much juice back in the day that he could put on pedophilic Americana on network tv? Does the story sound familiar?  Actually  the story is tame, and inventive and very, very arty.   Kramer vs. Kramer.  The first dramatic and fully articulated statement of the Baby Boomers achieving adulthood.  A film of the first water. Young married couple breaks apart. They become two seperate people post sexual revolution. Wife leaves shallow workaholic husband and baby. Goes out West. Comes back revitalized. In the meantime, shallow husband defined by his work, like an Eisenhower-era man, like--probably--his father changes,  grows . Welcome to 1978, motherfucker.   Husband fights custody. Bach and Vivaldi weave in and out of drama that takes place, it seems, amidst the most poignant colors of Autumn in Central Park.   And the courtroom scene where Meryl Streep slowly dissolves into tears offset by forced composure as Hoffman's lawyer vivisects her irresponibility -- her feminism, her 1978ness -- are among the best goddamned acting you ever will see. Kramer versus Kramer is as good as film gets.  Okay, so those are some of my Trio picks. And you have to admit it is a hell of a lot better than  Battle of the Network Stars .

       Will Someone Give Bill Murray An Oscar Already?   reprinted from January 10th:  Oscar is fickle about  urlLink comedians  (unless you, like me, found  William Hurt  in  urlLink Kiss of the Spider Woman  to be inexplicably  hilarious  ... and don't even get me to do my impression of  Daniel Day Louis  in  My Left Foot ... I'll knock over this computer).   Oscar  only  rewards drama, goes the theory ...  Oscar  feels that comedy isn't really acting. Oscar eludes all those who seek him. Oscar believes comedians are too contrived in their performances. Oscar, Oscar, blah blah.  blah . What about  Bill ? What about his oft-spoken of "nuanced irony" (makes bracket gesture with frostbitten fingers)?  Will someone give the Oscar to  Bill Murray  already? His performance in  Sophia Copolla's    Lost In Translation  was the most winning of the year.  Imagine a Best Oscar going to an underplayed performance, a bittersweetly comic performance, gentle man going through the inevitable motions of decline. And Bill Murray -- for lack of Oscar nominations -- is an actor in decline yet at his peak. How better to reward irony than with irony? Give the subtly nuanced rendering of decline a thumbs up, Hollywood.   Denzel Washington's  dirty cop in  Training Day  was the most powerful and full-on, cut all the stops performance in recent years. Septemeber 11th, to a degree, fueled our need for catharsis: a big evil wolfish lead villain exterminated by his own excess. In contradistinction to that performance (pats himself on the back for finding a use for "contradistinction"), wouldn't it be wonderful to have Bill Murray's muted Hollywood actor jetlagged in a foreign land win it this time around.   Murray has been snubbed by Oscar before ( The Corsair  shakes his head balefully at man's base nature). The fact that Murray has  never  been nominated is a crime. Murray was straightforward and emotionally rich in  Rushmore . He created a layered, if conflicted and earnest personality in  The Razor's Edge . And Murray was overlooked as the subtle (there's that word again) but funny cuckolded psychiatrist in  The Mighty Tennenbaum's . Murray is all about rendering different shades of beige.  My favorite Bill Murray flic is  Meatballs , which is also the first film I ever saw, so take my suggestion with a grain of salt ("spazz ... spazz ...  urlLink spazz "). There will never be a time quite like the 70s, in Canada, no less: nation obsessed with folksy humanitarianism in a decade of Aquarian folksy humanitarianism. There was an innocence (notwithstanding Murray's very un-PC manhandling of fellow counselor  urlLink Roxanne , played a bit on the butch side, by the unforgettable  urlLink Kate Lynch ).  And for the kids who don't get the ad-libbed sex jokes(I was, like 4yrs old at the time and devoid of irony or snark or smarm, all of which flooded forth, with  torrential velocity , in high school years), there is the cockles-warming relationship between Murray and the affable Chris Makepeace's character,  Rudy the Rabbit . That relationship would never happen today as a result of the cynicism arising from the Catholic Church and internet sex fiends and Jacko. If Bill Murray showed that much interest in a camper nowadays, he'd be serving a three year sentence with Chuck Zito and Addabezi.   Anyhoo : To me, Bill Murray is the coolest man on the planet earth, Oscar or not.

       Neil Strauss Dumps The Old Grey Lady    urlLink Gred Lindsay of WWD  informs us that  Neil Strauss  is giving  The Old Grey Lady  the old  heave 'ho , and it's probably better for all involved in that sordid mess. He'd been doing a three way with Old Lady and  Jenna Jameson , but something had to give way, in the , uhm,  end . And when it's a choice between and  Old Grey Lady  and a  Young Blonde Starlet , *snaps* well,  you know how 'tis . Lindsay explains:  " urlLink Neil Strauss , the music critic who signed up to ghostwrite porn star  Jenna Jameson’s  memoirs without telling his superiors first, is leaving the paper to work on his book projects. 'Neil has resigned, and I have regretfully accepted his resignation,' said cultural news editor  Steve Erlanger .   "While Erlanger insisted that the Jameson affair hadn’t come between them, it is certainly hard to imagine the Times tolerating the (fully clothed) cameo in Jameson’s next film that Strauss was reportedly considering. Strauss will theoretically continue to write for the Times as a freelancer, but not regularly, and his critic’s slot will be filled. 'He made the choice to concentrate on these larger projects,' Erlanger said in a telephone interview."  Affair? Coming between them?  Larger projects ? Why not call a spade a spade Erlanger, Strauss is pursuing  urlLink larger "assets ," if ya nah whatta mean.  Silicon enhanced  assets, cornbread.  Lindsay continues:  "Besides Jameson’s book, entitled  urlLink 'How to Make Love Like a Porn Star ,' Strauss is writing another book based on his January first-person piece on being tutored in the art of picking up women. Columbia Pictures has already bought the film rights for the low six figures."   Hmmm . I wonder how Strauss decided to leave the Times:    INT. NY TIMES HEADQUARTERS RESTROOM. DAY    REPORTER NEILL STRAUSS  TO NO ONE IN PARTICULAR  Boy, Man, that Old Grey Boss Lady takes good care of my sorry ass. How cool is that?  And older women are insatiable, you can't go wrong. She's okay and East Coast respectable and all that, but I'm a  wild and innocent youth . I need to sow my oats with some tighter flesh. I wish I could find someone younger. The Old Gray Lady, she's just a little bit country, and I'm a little bit rock and roll ... (sighs)   JENNA JAMESON ENTERS IN PINK SHORT SHORTS   I think I took a wrong turn somewhere. This is such a big building.   STRAUSS   Nah, honey, you took the  right turn    JENNA   Oh  dear , I can't believe I got lost in  the men's room . Can you help me get to HarperCollins? I'm writing a hardback ...   NEILL STRAUSS , sort of half-sliding and half-oozing from the chair.  I'll show you a  hard back , baby.   urlLink music  seeps  SEX SCENE ONE  The two are interrupted by  urlLink Jayson Blair , YOUNG BUCK, walking in without knocking, prancing around the newsroom wearing a Persian head wrap that covered my face,  Kermit the Frog  on his shoulders and a giant fake fur coat.  Oh,  excuse  me, is there anyone in this men's room that wants to swap sexual favors for crack?  Are ... -- wait.  What are you two doing ? That's so  hot , it's  urlLink burning down my master's house .  JENNA JAMESON  Sweetie, why don't you come on over here and have a piece of this Metro Section?  STRAUSS  Yeah, the more the merrier, it's all Arts and Liesure in here. As they say, all the news that's fit to ...  (Abrupt  Sven Nykvist  close up as The Old Grey Lady walks in, angry)  What is the meaning of  this ?!  STRAUSS, BLAIR and JAMESON all look frightened into the camera.  Freeze screen.  70s porn music and fade away.  End credits       Fashion Week 2004 NYC: Day 1   It's fashion week again here in New York City, and that means  urlLink parties  (especially the  Louis Vuitton  opening party on Monday night and, of course, the  Naomi Campbell  pr done  urlLink Carlos Miele  show at  urlLink Gotham Hall  on Thursday at 7:30, RSVP  Thursday730@nc-connect.com),  urlLink beautiful people all dressed alike  ( urlLink FashionWeekDaily's  HEAVILY OVERUSED BUZZWORDS: "Red, strappy, party"), gift bags and  urlLink gossip .   And speaking of  Fashion Week Daily ,  J.J. Martin  and  Tanya Jensen  write on Day 1:  "What about all that Red?  " Amanda Hearst : I never wear red. It’s so eye-catching. I prefer black or pink.  " Patti Hansen :  “When I was little the kids always teased me about my red hair, but now I love it.  It’s so striking—it’s like, ‘Watch out-- Red Alert!’  " Alek Wek : Red puts me at ease.  Plus you can’t miss it!    "Bright futures?   Alexandra Richards :  I’m only 17 still in high school and living with my mom.  But I’d like to come to NY next year—I’m trying to get into  Eugene Lang  at the  New School  to study painting—but I don’t want to jinx it by telling you that.  "Overheard on  Patty Hansen’s  fitted skirt:  “Have you seen her? To me it looks like something she dragged from her closet from 3 season’s ago.    " Sharon Bush  on Lauren’s absence from the show:  “She really wanted to do it but she had a commitment at  Princeton  she could not get out of.”  " Sharon Bush  on the show:  “Oh, I loved all of it. I would gladly wear any one of those dresses.”  " Amanda Hearst  on her Daily cover.  “Oh my god, I couldn’t believe it when I walked in the tents this morning and saw someone reading it. I love it, I’m thrilled.”   Meanwhile,  urlLink LookOnline's  Blogger  Marilyn Kirschner  takes the pr firms that members of the fashion press have to deal with down a peg:  "As a longtime member of the press, I've had to rely on PR firms through the years. Since Fashion Week has gotten underway, this relationship has been even more exaggerated and important. Simply put, at this moment in time, they are the bane of our existence, it seems.  "Happily and thankfully, most of the companies (you know who you are) we've had to deal with (for tickets to shows, events, parties) have been nothing but professional, easy to reach, and consistently helpful.  "Of course, there are always exceptions.....without getting really ugly...let's just say, the names could be changed to reflect the real situation:  " urlLink Paul Wilmot : Paul Wil 'not'  " Pierre Rouget : Pierre 'Rude' get  " PR Consulting : PR 'In' sulting  "MGI(ed note: Marion Greenberg Inc): MG 'Try'   " Hood Public Relations : 'Should ' Public Relations  " urlLink Ogan/Dallal : 'Ugh' an/ Dallal  " urlLink Rand.M : 'RanduM'  " urlLink Harrison & Shriftman : Harass & Stiffthem  "Okay, I got that off my chest - I feel better already ..."  Snark is good  and  therapeutic.   Update :"  First Lady Laura Bush  has been confirmed to arrive at Olympus Fashion Week this Monday.  Mrs. Bush will arrive at Bryant Park around 2 p.m. to make a brief presentation and to take a tour of the tents, although she will not be staying for any shows.

       Farah Fawcett and Tom Green: Love Connection    urlLink The National Enquirer  has come up with one of the strangest love connections ever -- a real  fuckeroo :  Tom Green , the ex-Mr.  Drew Barrymore , has apparently been burning the bed of  Farah Fawcett , the ex-Mrs.  Lee Majors .   Jesus Fucking Christ , Houston, we have a problem: I couldn't have made that up if I tried. I haven't an imagination on that cosmic a scale.  Farah is no stranger to acting kooky: there was that Letterman appearance, the nude bodypainting Playboy thing that ruined her critically acclaimed image, and then the revelation in  urlLink Joe Eszterhas' American Rhapsody  that she peed in public.    urlLink The Enquirer's   Rick Egusquiza  writes:  "FORMER Charlie's Angels star  Farrah Fawcett  is having a heavenly time with new Angel  Drew Barrymore's  former husband -- wacky comic  urlLink Tom Green !  The pairing of the 57-year-old actress with the 32-year-old  urlLink Freddy Got Fingered  star is the latest May-December romance to rock Hollywood since  Demi Moore  robbed  Ashton Kutcher's  cradle.   "'Farrah's romance with Tom Green was a shock to say the least,' a close friend of Farrah's family told The ENQUIRER.   "Her former love  Ryan O'Neal  can't believe it's true. He hopes Tom is sincere about dating Farrah and it's not just for the publicity.   "Her son with Ryan,  Redmond , hopes his mother is happy. But he's not thrilled about having Tom Green as a potential stepdad. Who would?  "Ryan's children, Tatum and especially  Griffin , are still very close to Farrah. They think it's just another one of Farrah's many bizarre choices in men since splitting from their dad.   "'But Farrah doesn't mind a bit.' Farrah and Tom met at a celebrity poker event and hit it off so well that they had dinner the next night, the friend revealed.   "They've been dating steadily ever since."   I do not know if this is a hoax or not, as Tom was supposedly " urlLink dating" his pal ,  Monica Lewinsky  too. Ordinarily I would say that this is Tom doing his usual  urlLink Tomfoolery  meta protopunking, but Farah has got to know that she is on the edge of being laughed out of Tinseltown. She couldn't think that her old school image would be helped by a prank like this. Could she? I mean she is an Aquarius, and, at least from my dating experiences, Aquarian women are way out there ...  waaaay out there.  Stay tuned to  The Corsair  for further developments: same bat time, same bat channel.   UPDATE 2/9:     Liz Smith  sets  urlLink The National Enquirer  straight about its story on the alleged "romance" between  Tom Green  and  Farah Fawcett . Smith writes:  "FARRAH FAWCETT loves a good joke as much as anybody, but the National Enquirer's recent story on her "romance" with comic Tom Green ( Drew Barrymore's  ex) was a joke gone too far. Farrah says she met Green two years ago with her publicist, and has never seen him since.   "Farrah is, in reality, busy sifting through a mountain of film and TV offers. (Her 'Bobbi Boland' stage effort ended prematurely, but I'm betting she'll tread the boards again.)   "The actress will be in New York during Valentine's week, discussing 'love' on a panel gathered for  The Week  magazine.  Harold Evans ,  Erica Jong  and  Edmund White  also give their thoughts on what makes the heart flutter."   The Corsair Translator : The Enquirer fucked up, like The Star's JLo Story. Farah wants to do "serious" things, like be on Harry Evans panels and steer clear of the likes of Tom Green.

Who could it be? Believe it or not it’s just me.  "It’s like a light of a new day, It came from out of the blue. Breaking me out of the spell I was in, Making all of my wishes come true.

       Courtney Love: Joycean?   There are so many ways to describe  Courtney Love , so you can imagine why  The Corsair  objects to  Neil Strauss'  characterization of her phone call to him as "Joycean" in tomorrow's  Arts and Leisure section .     The Corsair  would have found another adjective, like, say, "narcissist," or even, "messy." "Primitive" maybe?  Then again, the more we look at it, maybe Strauss was right. Maybe Love is Joycean. I mean, look at these lyrics from  urlLink Doll Parts :"  "I want to be the girl with the most cake/ He only loves those things because he loves to see them break/ I fake it so real I am beyond fake/ And some day you will ache like I ache"  And  urlLink Ulysses ,   "Lord!  Did me good all the same. Off colour after Kiernan's, Dignam's. For this relief much thanks. In  urlLink HAMLET , that is. Lord! It was all things combined. Excitement. When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of my tongue. Your head it simply swirls."  Now, check out Courtney Love in  urlLink Gutless :  "You can try to suck me dry But theres nothing left to suck Just you try to hold me down Come on try to shut me up"   And contrast that with a wandering  Steven Daedelus , "Beingless Beings. Stop! Throb always without you and throb always within. Your heart you sing of. I between then. Where? Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I. Shatter them, one and both. But stun myself too in the blow. Shatter me you who can. (242)"   Joycean?   Hmmmmmm ...  could  be.

       John Kerry: Fake   There is a great danger,  The Corsair  believes, in picking  urlLink Senator John Kerry  to be the Democratic nominee for President. First, he is a hairstyle with some armed services experience, but other than that -- what?  There is a real danger that  Al Gore II , also known as Kerry, will spark the disenfranchised  Deaniacs , who registered for "regime change," might flock to a  Ralph Nader  candidacy and, once again, hand a victory to Republicans, to teach the stubborn Democrat Establishment a lesson.  A very real  danger.  You see, Kerry speaks on special interests, but he is, in fact, a urlLink  Master at using them . A veritable Rembrandt of special interest dollars.  Then there is the question of his fakeness. Kerry is impossibly phony. Yes, I know, only Holden Caulfield could get away with using that word, but I always like to imaging that if Caulfield spent some years in Africa and got out of the "instution" to  urlLink study philosophy in the Green Mountains of Vermont , he might have turned out like  The Corsair .   Anyhoo : Kerry's phoniness is vast. To wit:  urlLink The Harley on Leno , Kerry tears up -- at just the right political moment -- in his  urlLink interview with Ed Bradley ,  urlLink the haircut  at just the right time, the initials (JFK), the  urlLink sketchy Irish Catholic background , the Vietnam "Republican" buddy,  James Rassmann  who " just happened " (wink wink) to be in Iowa  urlLink to boost Kerry's poll numbers , the coincidence that his first heiress-wife,  urlLink Julia Thorne , was worth $300 million and his second wife,  urlLink Theresa , worth close to $1 billion. Just a  coinki-dinky .  Look, as John Kerry collects his victories in Michigan and Washington I think that the democrat readers of this site -- and there are a few -- should take a second look at  urlLink John Edwards , a man who is not Skull and Bones, and can therefore make a credible case against Bush's corporate cronyism a la Haliburton.  If John Kerry gets the dem nod, Nader will all but certainly run, bringing along enraged Deaniacs and, quite possibly, getting the party right back in the same mess it was in before. The Party must find confluence between the idealistic progressive wing and the Chardonnay sipping, Brie munching, liberal establishment Upper West Side-Hollywood- Joe Klein - Sally Quinn  wing, otherwise Bush wins again.  But this time with a strong rightist mandate.

       Matt Perry Falls Off The Wagon   That cultural artifact -- I forgot which gossip rag I usually mean here -- the National Enquirer is reporting that Matt Perry has fallen off the wagon ... again.  "As his show  urlLink Friends  nears the end of its 10-year run,  Matt Perry  ( ed note : don't you love the way they call him by a nickname after bringing this up?) has suffered a devastating relapse of his alcohol and drug problem, The ENQUIRER has learned exclusively.   "The issue ... reveals Matt's heartfelt confession to 30 people at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, when he told them: 'I have all this money and fancy cars and beautiful girlfriends but it wasn't making me happy'"  (Tries very, very hard to suppress a laugh)  (very hard)   The Corsair  might openly weep at that misguided by probably heartfelt confession if it weren't for four beautiful words, two gorgeous names:  urlLink Julia Roberts  and  Salma Hayek .   Cry me a river,  Matthew Perry .  Fucking  pussy-boy

       Hitchcock Has No Bellybutton   From an interview between  urlLink Karen Black  and  David Savage  in  urlLink Index Magazine, Feb-March 2004 :   Karen Black : "(Hitchcock) showed me his belly. He had no belly button."   David Savage : It's true. Very few people know that about Alfred Hitchcock.   Black : "One day I went to see him in his cabin, and he started telling me about his operations. He said he had one where they took his belly button away. He pulled up his little white shirt, and sure enough they had sewn right across the center of his belly, horizontally."

       Waters on Manson   The following comes from the  Sunday Arts and Leisure section of the New York Times  in a interview between  Mim Udovitch  and  John Waters .   Waters : "Well, every five years  Charles Manson  has a parole hearing and I watch it for one reason: he has a new look every time. So I watch him, then I find an unsuspecting movie star who happens to look exactly like him in that incarnation, and pair them together, to show that no matter what, Manson's more famous. That's a terrible thing to say. But, basically, still, if you showed a picture of  Brad Pitt  and Manson to people, I think more people would identify Manson, which, I think is a very frightening thing about American fame. This year, he couldn't come out for his parole hearing because they made him wear handcuffs. It was a fashion decision."

       Mrs. Gotti's Letter to Page Six    urlLink According to the patron saint of all bloggers ,  Elizabeth Spiers , the widow of  John Gotti  wrote a letter to Page Six's Richard Johnson on his coverage of the embarassing  JLo  flap (remember the interview that  urlLink was not an exclusive  that was on newsstands EVERYWHERE?):  " urlLink Page Six  did an item a couple of days ago about  urlLink Victoria Gotti's 'exclusive' Star interview  with J-Lo post-Bennifer which indicated that the interview was not so much an interview as a couple of canned quotes from J-Lo's publicist, who also happens to rep Gotti. Gotti was not pleased. More importantly, Gotti's mother was not pleased. Mama Gotti apparently sent a nasty 'fuck you letter' to Page Six's  Richard Johnson ."  Our gossip hero  Richard Johnson  is a big guy who can take care of himself, but we worry. Actually we didn't worry about it until we read  Ken Hall's   urlLink bio of Mrs. Gotti :  "Mrs. Gotti met her husband in 1960 -- when she was still  Victoria DiGiorgio  -- and the two were married on March 6, 1962. They went on to have five children:  Angela ,  Frank ,  Victoria ,  Peter ,  John  and  Frank . Frank was only 12 when he was killed in a traffic accident near the family's home in Oyster Bay, N.Y. He shares the same crypt with his father.  "The circumstances surrounding the boy's death may provide some insight into the crime family culture. He was struck and killed by a neighbor,  urlLink John Favara , who was on his way home from work. Frank was riding a friend's mini-bike around the neighborhood. What happened next, depending on who you want to believe, was either an intentional act of murder or a horrible twist of fate.  "According to one account, Favara's vision was impaired by the glare of the afternoon sun and a construction dumpster that was sticking out into the street. So when young Frank came zipping across the road, Favara never saw the boy and hit him by accident.  "But the other story says that Favara was speeding, ran a red light and hit Frank, perhaps on purpose. Favara went into a semi-seclusion after the accident, which the Gotti's interpreted as a lack of contrition or remorse on his part.  "Mrs. Gotti, understandably devastated over the loss of her son, decided to take matters into her own hands and attacked Favara with an aluminum baseball bat. She hit him numerous times and he was hospitalized, but did not press charges. The car was stolen and later recovered, with the word 'murderer' spray painted across the side.  "Favara received numerous death threats and finally decided to sell his house and move. Three days before the closing, he was abducted while leaving his job at a furniture warehouse. His body was never found, but sources say he was shot and clubbed to death. Then, his body was put into a barrel filled with cement, whereupon he was dumped into the ocean off Brooklyn. No arrests were ever made. The Gottis were vacationing in Fort Lauderdale at the time of the murder.  "Following Mr. Favara's disappearance, Mrs. Gotti was quoted as saying, 'I don't know what happened to him. I am not sorry if something did. He never sent me a sympathy card. He never apologized. He never even got his car fixed.'  " John Gotti's  sentiments were similar. 'I don't know what happened but I'm not sorry if something did happen. He killed my kid.'"  Richard just reported that Mrs. Gotti's kid made a slip up, nothing more. How can you not like Page Six, Mrs. Gotti?

       Gawker on NY Social Diary   We like  David Patrick Columbia  of  urlLink New York Social Diary . We've traded some friendly emails blogger-to-blogger. He said that  The Corsair  has a "healthy amount of irony."   That having been said, (Oh David, don't hold this against us, we know you're top drawer all the way),  NYSD  is about the whitest blog around. No kidding here, my little pommies. Alabaster.  urlLink The Upper East Side  on a Sunday morning white. So when  urlLink Gawker  delivered this very funny and unexpected  urlLink Black History Month present , I sort of made an explosive yet compressed laugh-cough sound that made my office mate look at me, suspicious-like, as if I were the  urlLink kidnap on tape suspect . Choire follows up by saying:  "We just didn't want to mention it (because we're SO nice). But it is really horrifying that, directly underneath the aforementioned pictures of black people at the University of the West Indies benefit on  urlLink New York Social Diary , there's an ad for "Hamptons Domestics" employment agency. The ad has little black Victorian silhouettes and a pineapple as its logo. Yikes."  (scroll to bottom of page to get the full Gawker effect)

       I, Caligula   Sometimes actors -- who generally suffer from identity issues -- begin to become their most successful roles of yesteryear and life imitates art. Think of  urlLink Robert Downey, Jr's  Julian in  urlLink Less Than Zero .  urlLink The 3 AM Girls report  that  urlLink John Hurt , who is famous on this side of the Atlantic for his mind bendingly debauched performance as  urlLink Caligula  in the classic (crosses himself solemnly in the cause of Art)  urlLink I, Claudius , got crunked up and had to be "escorted from London's  urlLink Spearmint Rhino  lapdancing bar for being abusive."  It sounds positively Pagan.  The gals write:   "According to our sources, the 64-year-old luvvie was ejected from the club when management decided they'd had enough of his "disrespectful behaviour" towards staff."  "'... John had been knocking back the drinks and was acting thoroughly rude and unpleasantly,' reveals one insider.  "He'd arrived with a friend and was ushered into the VIP area.  "But while most stars treat the staff with respect, he was being vile. He had one waitress in tears after pointing his finger in her face and shouting and swearing."  And what would you expect Caligula to do in such a situation? The gals continue:  "The only time he smiled was when some dancers started gyrating in front of his table, but even that went wrong. John's hands started to wander and security told him in no uncertain terms he wasn't allowed to touch, otherwise he'd be thrown out."  But how does one explain that to  urlLink the leader of the Roman Empire ?  More:  "As well as shouting and pointing at the waitress, he was screaming for some Rhino chips with which he could buy dances.  "He then kicked up a fuss because his credit card needed authorising and when it came to pay for his bar bill he signed on the wrong part of the slip."  Does a  urlLink self-made God  pay for Rhino chips?  Alas, the story -- myth? -- ends badly:  "By now he was shrieking things like, 'How dare you talk to me like this, don't you know who I am?'  "The club's bosses knew exactly who he was - and decided they'd had enough of him.  "A spokesman said 'We can confirm  John Hurt  was escorted out of the premises. He had obviously had too much to drink so we stopped serving because he was intoxicated.' Exit  urlLink Elephant Man , totally drunk ..."  I don't know what is more depressing, the fact that the 3AM Girls are too young to have made the more accurate Caligula reference or the fact that I myself am old enough.

       The Unbearable Lightness of Being Nicholson    urlLink Rush and Molloy  give us some remarkable quotes from  urlLink Jack Nicholson , horny Hollywood badboy who, it appears, is finally growing long in the tooth.    Rush and Molloy  write:  "The once-unrepentant rake still takes  urlLink Viagra  (though only 'when I am with more than one woman'). And he still loves to 'wind up'  urlLink Diane Keaton  by telling her what I did on the weekend ... [She says], 'Jack, you are absolutely disgusting!' ( ed note : The same can be said of  urlLink Keaton's Clown art book )   The  urlLink article continues :  "But, at age 66, (Nicholson's) decided that 'it is very unattractive for me to be seen fawning over little, tiny girls.'   "Having soured on dating, he misses being in a real relationship. 'I get lonely,' he told  London's Daily Telegraph  this week. 'I wish I had a partner.'"  So, for the record, although Jack still likes to fawn over little tiny girls, he won't because, to jealous bourgois suburban families on vacation doing, say, the tour of star homes, such acts appear as unattractive? And I thought Jack embodied the hip  urlLink swinging 60s , not the  urlLink Eisenhower 50s .  Stop the world, someone, I want to get off.

       Jayson Shot His Dog! It's A Greek Thing   In light of yesterday's blog about how hot chicks like animals and the recent death of  Adam Sandler's  beloved bulldog  urlLink Meatball , we have news from the Daily News that  urlLink Jayson Williams , the embattled former Nets star, blew the head off his own Rottweiler!  "Williams executed his dog  Zeus  in a fit of fury after losing a $100 bet to former teammate  urlLink Dwayne Schintzius ."  "Then Williams reloaded the double-barreled shotgun, aimed the weapon at Schintzius, and demanded, 'Shinbone, get this f-----' dog off my porch or you're next,' according to a sworn statement."   Fuck!   The story continues, "The incident occurred Aug. 8, 2001, at Williams' estate in Alexandria Township after a night of drinking at the nearby  urlLink Mountain View Chalet  - the same place where he drank heavily before fatally shooting limo driver Costas (Gus) Christofi six months later, on Feb. 14, 2002."   Alexandria ?  Zeus ?  Costas Christofi ?   The Corsair , without the aid of  urlLink Dr. Watson , the  urlLink Bloodhoung Gang from 3-2-1 Contact , or even the faithful sidekick, Shinbone, has solved The Case of the with only a love of classics and a degree from a fine liberal arts college.   A modern day  Prometheus , Jayson takes his cues from  urlLink Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound  when he says:  "Am I to be reformed, and made a show  Of infamy to  Zeus ?"  It's all about the Greeks, baby: somewhere in his addled Jesus Juice filled head, Jayson was trying to enact the ancient Greek classic play. And, really, guys: you should see his  urlLink Antigone  after  urlLink getting crunked up  on  urlLink Cutty Sark .  Williams, by the way, is facing up to  55 years  in prison which, as any self respecting member of the  urlLink Nation of Islam  will tell you, is the same age that  urlLink Pythagorras  started a school on the island of Samos.

       Debbie Rowe: Michael Is Not The Father of My Kids   According to  urlLink Star Magazine , by way of an unnamed British newspaper (why? what's up with some attribution,  Dolce  and  Gotti  -- eh?), Jacko "is not the natural father of ex-wife  Debbie Rowe's  two children,  Prince Michael I , 6, and daughter  Paris , 5 ( ed note :  surprised ? Neither am I)-- according to a British newspaper, which claims to have uncovered a 'legal dossier' of documents drawn up by Debbie as she prepares to "seek temporary exclusive custody of the children."  ( The Corsair  munches on unsalted popcorn and stares at his screen)  The story written by  Neil Blincow  and  Alex Burton  continues, "Within the report of these legal documents, Rowe, 41, is quoted as saying, 'I have no information whatsoever about the identity of the semen donor for either child, as such semen was obtained anonymously from a semen bank, under an agreement of confidentiality."  ( The Corsair  whistles silently to himself)  "I consented to the artificial insemination with the specific intent of bearing a child, to which Michael would be the father and treated in all respects as the father" without the necessity of adoption, the Star reports.  They continue, "... In exchange for bearing Jackson two children, Rowe reportedly received $11 million, a $3 million Beverly Hills home, and payment of her monthly expenses. In a surrogacy agreement -- reportedly signed Jan. 23, 1996, ten months before their marriage -- Debbie agreed 'to knowingly and voluntarily waive [her] right to contest Michael's paternity of either child' and 'consent to Michael being declared the father.'"  Whoa. I could tell you that the documents are reported to state that Jacko "imposed a 'no-sex' ban on Rowe for six months prior to her artificial insemination, to avoid 'any possibility of semen being introduced into my body' in any other way."  I could also mention that "Beverly Hills fertility specialist Dr.  Hal Danzer  artificially inseminated Debbie on May 28, and May 29, 1996, with semen 'donated to, and for the use of' Jackson."  But then you wouldn't  run  over here to read  urlLink The Star .   Okay Star, if this is true, I forgive you for that really wierd  urlLink fake J Lo interview with Victoria Gotti  (it was JLo's publicist)  ( Ed Note :  The Corsair  will be published sporadically for the rest of the week, sorry about that)

       Martha Talks   On  urlLink her web site , the embattled  Martha Stewart  appears tasteful in earth tones, seated on some firewood at her place in Westport, Connecticut, with  Teeny , her cat. She writes on her tribulations on  Marthatalks.com :  "Dear Friends:"  ( The Corsair  gets a warm feeling in his chest, leans into the computer, sips his Cutty Sark contentedly)  "As my trial unfolds, I am hopeful and optimistic that I will be exonerated and able once again to devote my full attention to developing and promoting the creative homekeeping ideas that so many loyal customers and supporters have come to rely on for inspiration in their own kitchens, gardens and craft rooms."  ( The Corsair  shakes his fist at his computer, in true Gemini form, angered at being pitched to by Martha, of all people,  even now )  "The second week of courtroom proceedings is underway."   I'll say . Now, can you say  urlLink Faneuil ? I can't and I took several years of Frenchy.   Anyhoo , Martha continues talking:  "As part of my promise to keep you informed about key developments, my attorneys and I will do our best to post relevant items from the trial and related op-eds, as soon as they become available."  ( The Corsair  leaps up and down in pleasure at the considers all the blog entries that will ensue)  "I want to thank all of you again -- and particularly those who have written to me with such kind words and allowed me to post them here -- for your support and encouragement.

       Great Scott! Superman Casting Chaos    urlLink Henry Cavill , a British yet-to-be-known, will play Superman in the upcoming Last Son of Krypton film by Warner Brothers and director  McG , who incidentally, punkd  Katie Holmes  but good.   Playing opposite thr man of steel, apparently, is  Beyonce  who will be  Lois Lane , or at least that is what most media sources are reporting. That having been said, according to insider geek site,  urlLink AintitCool.com , up until Thursday January 29th, was wide open, and director McG had apparently been having second thoughts about casting the  urlLink bootylicious singer .  Media outlets arealso reporting that Academy Award nominee Johnny Depp's name is at the top of the list tomplay Lex Luthor, which contrasts starkly with  urlLink the geek inside word   that Depp is being talked about for the role of  Jor El , Superman's father. It will be interesting to see who got it right, the gossip press, who often are so rushed to be ahead of the scoop that they do not factcheck, or the geek insiders.  Oh, you don't find who ultimately playes the role of Jor El interesting? It's just me? (Looks around nervously)   Whatever .

       Animals and Celebrities   It seems that just yesterday we reported that  Angie Everhart , of  urlLink Lingerie Bowl  fame, had quite a menagerie of animals in her stead. "I have four dogs, a cat and a horse," said the sexy red head on  urlLink Howard Stern's radio show  last week.  Now, via  urlLink Page Six , we learn that  urlLink FHM  has chosen  Paris Hilton  as the Most Eligible Woman in the World 2004 (up from number 19, 2003), and, ancillary to that, Paris also  adores  animals.  The Sixers  urlLink write :  "FHM - which credits 'The Post's renowned PAGE SIX' for discovering Hilton - reports that the hotel heiress stands to rake in $10 million next year thanks to a reality show sequel, a pop album, a book, a clothing line and endorsement deals (all on top of her estimated $30 million inheritance). But our favorite part of the FHM interview is when Hilton describes buying exotic animals in Las Vegas: 'I went to this pet store and bought a baby goat, a ferret and this one animal that was like half monkey, half raccoon. I tried to take them on the plane, and the flight attendants thought I was insane. They were like, 'This isn't a traveling circus. You're not bringing a goat on the plane.' So I ended up having to drive back to L.A. in a limo all by myself for six hours with the animals.'"  Animal rights activist  urlLink Pam Anderson , has posed provocatively for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals in a poster which shows the "actress" clad in a bikini made of three lettuce leaves that reads: "Turn over a new leaf: Try vegetarian."    Charlize Theron  loves her dog so much she douses it in expensive doggie perfume.  Renee Zellwegger  gained weight for  Bridget Jones  with her pooch.   Tiffany Taylor , Playboy Playmate, enjoys breeding bloodhounds and raising ferrets.  Note to skirt chasers: hot chicks like animal lovers.

       Guessing The New York Post Blind Items   Guessing at blind items is almost as much fun as knowing that you are right, which I do not profess in any way shape or form.   urlLink Page Six  ran a few blind items today, one of which, listed under "Just Asking" asked, "WHICH Oscar-nominated actress has a cheating boyfriend? When she's away on location, a third party visits him from England, and the third party is a man ..."  Could that be Irish actor  Stuart Townsend ,  urlLink Charlize Theron's fiance ? In an interview with The Advocate, dated March 5, 2002, he said: "'My first time in a nightclub with a gay friend, I walked into a room full of men kissing each other, and I was shocked by the energy of the place--the muscles! I had never been in that environment before, and I freaked a little. The homophobia barrier closed in around me--I was scared. But I've grown up a bit since then,' laughs actor Stuart Townsend." I am completely guessing on this.  But:  Hmmm . I mean, it can't be  Diane Keaton  as Nicholson is pretty into girls.    The other blind items were, "WHICH cable TV news anchor took a two-week vacation to get some hair plugs? But he had to take a third week because they didn't heal in time and he had tiny scabs all over his scalp . . . WHICH indicted celebrity is rumored to have lost his cool when the victim caught him having sex with another man?"  On the last one  The Corsair  hasn't a clue, there are just too many goddam  urlLink indicted celebrities  to even hazard a guess (although I will guess that it is NOT  James Brown )  But on the first blind item, since  Shep Smith  has a full head of hair, we are going to guess  urlLink Anderson Cooper .

       Jacko is WIRED (and Wierd)    urlLink TheSmokingGun  is posting a heavily edited document on their site that lists some of the things hauled away from Michael Jackson's estate and two other properties on November 18.  Of the loot, there are an astonishing number of computers and electronic gizmos (Apple, Cannon, etc) stashed at Neverland, which kind of freaked me out; and, of course, a  urlLink Robb Report , "a trusted guide for the world's most successful, demanding, and educated magazine readers."  One of the dozen or so computers, court records show, was located "on the second shelf on the right hand side of locked closet in master bathroom."  Most of the Jacko's computers were returned to him after the hard drives were copied.    TheSmokingGun writes:  "According to the below Neverland inventory, Santa Barbara Sheriff's deputies removed computers, legal documents, magazines, and a Canon digital camera found in Jackson's master bathroom."  "... Agents searched Jackson's master bedroom, where they took a "note" found in a nightstand, and had to have a locksmith open the locked master bath (keys to the bathroom were apparently found later in a safe)."

       Who Will Be Kerry's Running Mate   Allow me to do some penance for using the Janet pic yesterday to rock my clock counter, so, fans of snark, forgive me for this rather serious post:  Barring a strong  urlLink John Edwards win in South Carolina   and a strong  urlLink Clark win in Oklahoma , you can gag the Democratic side of this election season with a fork, because, my little pomegranates,  it's just about done , and John Kerry will likely be the nominee. But who will Kerry pick for his running mate? Here are some thoughts:   urlLink Max Cleland .  The Corsair  believes that he is the likely choice for a running mate.  Pros:  From Georgia, brings the South back into the mix ... former Senator ... triple amputee war hero would make a strong veterans campaign with Kerry --  and Vets are likely Republican voters  ... expert on Homeland Security (big plus, as national security is a Republican stronghold) which  Bill Clinton  in a recent closed door meeting warned that the nominee must be strong on ... strong on health care ... could skin chicken hawk Cheney in a debate  Cons : None   urlLink Gary Hart   Pros : Vast intellect, PhD, Oxford, Political Philosophy ... wise from his time out in the political wilderness ... Strong in the Southwest ... devastating debator  Cons : Old adultery charge may still stick in the Bible Belt ... may be more useful to the Democratic Party in a Senate bid against the very weak  Ben Knighthorse Campbell  ... Possible Secretary of State, a la his hero, Jefferson   urlLink John Edwards .  Pros : Young up-and-comer, would play well with Kerry, lookswise ... Could bring the South, providing he can win the South Carolina primary and show strong in Arizona and Oklahoma ... has a base in the Dem party ...  ferocious  debator honed from years as a trial lawyer taking on corporate powerhouse who, often, pleaded to settle out of court rather than face Young Edwards.  Cons : Young, inexperienced ... former trial lawyer with a mile long money trail to their lobby   urlLink Bill Richardson  Pros: Governor of ultra-crucial New Mexico ... Latino ... former UN Ambassador and  urlLink seasoned diplomat  would give international cooperation credit points to ticket   Cons : None   urlLink Wesley Clark  Pros: Longshot, but if he wins big in Oklahoma and the conservative Southwest he could be in the cut ... General would give strong military backing to ticket ... would humiliate chickenhawk Cheney in a debate ... strong with African-Americans   Cons : Too closely tied to Bill Clinton, who wants Hillary '08, which may be an issue.   urlLink Dick Gephardt   Pros : Outside of Cleland and Edwards, the most likely running mate ... most popular pol in pivotal swing state Missouri ... would be perfect for a Kerry-Gephardt Northern labor-veterans strategy against a Bush South ... comes with the backing of labor, a Democratic must needs ... a truly good guy who dropped out and endorsed Kerry early:  he did the right thing   Cons : Wooden on the stump,  charismatically challenged    urlLink Evan Bayh  Pros: Young up and comer, popular moderate Democrat from a Republican state ... would look good stumping with Kerry ... strong political family ... Would play well in Bush states ... hugely ambitious for national office, a quick study   Cons : A long shot ... may not even be able to deliver Indiana, his home state, against Bush   urlLink Bob Graham   Pros : Most Aggressively Campaigning for this position ... got out early ... most popular elected official in CRUCIAL Florida ... Senate Intelligence Committee  Cons : Bad ticker ... charisma challenged.

       Britney as Bond Girl   According to  urlLink the 3AM Girls ,  Britney Spears  has set her sights on becoming a Bond Girl, following in the footsteps of her mentor,  Madonna , who played a role in Die Another Day.  The 3AM Girls write:  "'Britney's desperate to carve out a name for herself as an actress and loves the idea of being a Bond girl,' reveals our insider. 'She's in great shape and thinks she'd be brilliant.  "'Britney has seen what it's done profile-wise for  Halle Berry  and she wants a slice of the action." But we can understand why they may be reluctant to sign her. Britney was widely panned for her starring role in  urlLink Crossroads , a sickly-sweet teen road-trip movie."  The article goes on to say that Britney sees that her music career is just about over so she wants to make the transition into acting. Fair enough, but what name will Britney pick? In the Bond Girl tradition of  urlLink Pussy Galore ,  urlLink Kissy Suzuki ,  urlLink Mary Goodnight  and  urlLink Honey Ryder ,  The Corsair  would like to suggest a few:   Pepsi Girl : The Bond movies are so thick with  urlLink product placement , that Britney could simply enter the fray as one herself. Imagine Britney a deadly, nameless assassin from  urlLink Kentwood, Louisiana  who can crush a man to death with her jumbulayas. A French double agent (Cajun!), she is drinking the cold beverage, suggestively, trying to seduce 007. She is unable to distract him, so she calls her allies on her  Nokia  phone to inform them of Bond's whereabouts.   Kat Bayou , a wetland ecologist from Louisiana's Nature Preserve(hey, come on,  urlLink Denise Richards  played a nuclear physicist!). She befriends 007 against terrorists who plan to release bio weopons into the Louisiana Gulf. Adventures with  urlLink alligators  and snakes bring Bond and Bayou closer together.   Cassandra  A New Orleans psychic who gets on the wrong side of Haitian gangsters and voodoo obeah men and needs 007 to bail her out.   Cassandra "succumbs to Bond's advances and loses her powers of perception, but gains freedom."

       That was Steven Brill All Over   originally published November 22, 2003:  From  James Cramer's  autobiographical  Confessions of a Street Addict , on mini mogul  Steven Brill :  "(Brill) never did know when to quit, though, and could not bear to lose at anything. At the firm's summer outing at Brill's Westchester mansion, he divided us into teams, placing us in his pool, and insisted we play a  vicious game of water polo  where dunking was encouraged and expected. He relished the contact, being a head taller than just about anyone else on the opposing squad, including me.  Just as I was about to score what would have been the tying goal for my team,  Brill sank his teeth into my throwing arm , spouting blood into the clear water in a steady stream. As everyone looked on in horror,  I could only laugh . That was Steve all over."   The Corsair  is currently in the fetal position, knees touching his pronounced cheekbones, rocking himself back and forth, mumbling over and over again, "the New York media will be the end of me..."

       Gratuitous St. Elmo's Fire Quote    "Jules, y'know, honey... this isn't real. You know what it is? It's St. Elmo's Fire. Electric flashes of light that appear in dark skies out of nowhere. Sailors would guide entire journeys by it, but the joke was on them ... there was no fire. There was't even a St. Elmo. They made it up. They made it up because they thought they needed it to keep them going when times got tough, just like you're making up all of this. We're all going through this.  ... Hey, it's our time at the edge."   Rob Lowe  as perenial fuck up "Billy" to  Demi Moore's  catatonic "Jules" in  urlLink Saint Elmos Fire

       Oh, so THAT'S What a Chocolate Starfish is! Re: Janet Jackson   Forget for a moment the Jesus Juice, the prosthetic nose, the Playboy pictorial with the boa constrictor -- forget even the duet with  Pia Zadora ,  urlLink When the Rain Begins to Fall : In the late 80s in urban neighborhoods there was a  compelling  little t-shirt that read, "I wish I could live on a planet --  dammit!  -- where ever woman looked like Janet."  Charmed , I'm sure.  But the makers of this "t" (excuse the pun) hadn't forseen the Superbowl images of the, uhm, "wardrobe malfunction"  that everyone --  everyone  -- is talking about today. And my clock counter on this site is going gonzo for people who are clicking on  The Corsair  to see some Janet flesh. So, without any snark or ado, I'm gonna link you to what you so  obviously  want:  hereeees ,  urlLink Janet ! (thank you, as always,  urlLink Gawker , for the link)  Also: download the video  urlLink here :

       Who Will Be Kerry's Running Mate   Allow me to do some penance for using the Janet pic to rock my clock counter, so, fans of snark, forgive me for this rather serious post:  Okay, barring a strong  urlLink John Edwards win in South Carolina   and a strong  urlLink Clark win in Oklahoma , you can gag the Democratic side of this election season with a fork, because, my little pomegranates,  it's done , and John Kerry will likely be the nominee. But who will Kerry pick for Veep? Here are some thoughts:   urlLink Max Cleland .  The Corsair  believes that he is the likely choice for a running mate.  Pros:  From Georgia, brings the South back into the mix ... former Senator ... triple amutee war hero would make a strong veterans campaign with Kerry --  and Vets are liely Republican voters  ... expert on Homeland Security (big plus, as national security is a Republican stronghold) which Bill Clinton in a closed door meeting warned that the nominee must be strong on ... strong on health care ... could humiliate chicken hawk Cheney in a debate  Cons : Health might be an issue   urlLink Gary Hart   Pros : Vast intellect, PhD, Oxford, Political Philosophy ... wise from his time out in the political wilderness ... Strong in the Southwest ... devastating debator  Cons : Old adultery charge may still stick in the Bible Belt ... may be more useful to the Democratic Party in a Senate bid against the very weak  Ben Knighthorse Campbell  ... Possible Secretary of State, a la his hero, Jefferson   urlLink John Edwards .  Pros : Young up-and-comer, would play well with Kerry, lookswise ... Could bring the South, providing he can win the South Carolina primary and show strong in Arizona and Oklahoma ... has a base in the Dem party ...  ferocious  debator honed from years as a trial lawyer taking on corporate powerhouse who, often, pleaded to settle out of court rather than face Young Edwards.  Cons : Young, inexperienced ... former trial lawyer with a mile long money trail to their lobby   urlLink Bill Richardson  Pros: Governor of ultra-crucial New Mexico ... Latino ... former UN Ambassador and  urlLink seasoned diplomat  would give international cooperation credit points to ticket   Cons : None   urlLink Wesley Clark  Pros: Longshot, but if he wins big in Oklahoma and the conservative Southwest he could be in the cut ... General would give strong military backing to ticket ... would humiliate chickenhawk Cheney in a debate ... strong with African-Americans   Cons : Too closely tied to Bill Clinton, who wants Hillary '08, which may be an issue.   urlLink Dick Gephardt   Pros : Outside of Cleland and Edwards, the most likely running mate ... most popular pol in pivotal swing state Missouri ... would be perfect for a Kerry-Gephardt Northern labor-veterans strategy against a Bush South ... comes with the backing of labor, a Democratic must needs ... a truly good guy who dropped out and endorsed Kerry early:  he did the right thing   Cons : Wooden on the stump,  charismatically challenged    urlLink Evan Bayh  Pros: Young up and comer, popular moderate Democrat from a Republican state ... would look good stumping with Kerry ... strong political family ... Would play well in Bush states ... hugely ambitious for national office, a quick study   Cons : A long shot ... may not even be able to deliver Indiana, his home state, against Bush   urlLink Bob Graham   Pros : Most Aggressively Campaigning for this position ... got out early ... most popular elected official in CRUCIAL Florida ... Senate Intelligence Committee  Cons : Bad ticker ... charisma challenged.

       Real World Creator Bunim Dies, RIP    Mary-Ellis Bunim , pioneered the reality genre in which semi-educated inner city black kids were transplanted into all-white environments with priviledged peers, only to be humiliated and thrown off the show when they resorted to anti-social behavior,  urlLink died  on Thursday.   Charmed, I'm sure, but hardly the commitment to 'diversity' that all the Hollywood obits are praising her for.  Whatever my differences with her style of reality television, may she rest in peace.

       Eric "Altercation" Alterman vs. Ken Auletta, Round 1   What's up with  Eric Alterman  and  Ken Auletta ? In a January 2004 interview with  Jesse Oxfeld  for  urlLink Mediabistro , when Auletta was asked about an Alterman argument that corporatism influences tv news -- an argument, incidentally, that Auletta sometimes uses himself -- the New Yorker author said, "(Alterman's) a little more conspiratorial than I would be."  Okay,  no biggie  there, just some mild media snark. But when  urlLink C-Span's   Brian Lamb  asked Auletts about a snarky book review for the Los Angeles Times in which Alterman took Auletta to task about his cozy New Yorker interviews with Media moguls, Auletta came on a bit strong.  "My job is to understand people, not punish them."   Ouch

       RZA is Crazy    The Corsair  has many media obsessions but one of his favorites is  RZA . The RZA is crazy. Nutso. He eats ungodly amounts of  urlLink colloidal silver , even  proffering it to his offspring  need we say more?   One day  RZA  and his babies are going to turn blue from a colloidal silver overdose and then people will take me seriously.  Anyhoo : here's what he had to say to  FHM :   FHM : How strong is your Kung Fu?   RZA : "Strong, but I've never used it. One of my uncles trains CIA agents. He was offended I was learning from someone else, so he showed me this one move. He said, 'I could cripple you.' I believed him but he had to prove it. I was hurt for three months."  Okay ... leaving aside the implausibility that one of RZA's uncles is in the intelligence gathering business, how many people out there have familial relations that whisper  urlLink Moon Knight -like threats.  Being family is not about crippling one another . The interview concludes:   FHM : Is there an RZA sex tape out there?   RZA : I don't leave evidence like that. I form the lense with my hand, look through it and tape record with my mind.  What-the- fuck ?!

       Vanitas Vanitatum, Omnia Vanitas   "Laughter is mad, and reckless mirth-/ What does she in this weary earth?/ Should Wealth, or Fame, our Life employ,/ Death comes, our labour to destroy," writes  Ann Bronte  in  urlLink Vanitas Vanitatum, Omnia Vanitas . And the same could be said of inveterate namedropper and  urlLink status seeker  extraordinare  urlLink James Lipton  of  urlLink Inside the Actors Studio  ( okay , *skittish* so maybe I know a little bit about this topic, my little pommies, as that little -- makes broad quotation gestures with his fingers -- "interview with myself" thingie wasn't  the best  idea I've ever come up with, *blushes*).   urlLink Joanna and Alex  of the very cool Two-Twenty.net  urlLink put me in my place over my vanity , as did several others via email. I'm properly chastened. If I'm gonna throw down the snark, I should have a tough enough skin to take a bit of a bitchslapping now and then, as well. What was it  Matt Dillon  said in  Drugstore Cowboy  about  urlLink the therapeutic qualities of getting your ass kicked ? So, allow me to redeem my name on the subject of self promotion.  So, let's get  off me  and back  on to   James Lipton . (apologies, that was a nasty little piece of imagery I just laid on you; fucking  disgusting , actually)  Of  Lipton , who we now  presently mount  with vigor ( sorry , couldn't resist), let us say that one  Robert Wilonski  of the  urlLink Dallas Observer  once sagely wrote, " James Lipton  is so obsequious, it's astonishing the man does not conduct his interviews from his subjects' anal cavities ( ed note : this emerging theme is not my fault). The host of Bravo's hysterical, oddly riveting  Inside the Actors Studio  never misses an opportunity to suck up to the famous and talented who deign to accept his invitation."  And yet the  New York Times  doesn't appear to think so, as in tommorrow's Sunday Times Magazine  Edward Levine  interviews him in the  urlLink "DOMAINS" section , where Levine's  dough  is earned the hard way.   Gargantuan  was the name dropping going on at that  little tea party . Since I was called on my bull, let me be the bull rattling the china at that pleasant Times Magazine interview; allow me to bring some  urlLink Minoan chaos to Europa's ordered walk in the meadow . And so, on the principle of "takes one to know one" we -- the  shamed  author of the infamous "interview with myself" -- will  grade  Our Man Lipton, on how good he is at self promotion. Edward Levine's Lipton interview begins thusly:  " Workout : I do Pilates. I actually trained with  urlLink Joseph Pilates  himself and his wife, Clara. This was in the mid-1960's, and it was a thing for dancers then. When Joe died, a group of us bought his gym for his widow. I still do Pilates downstairs, all the mat work. I don't need an instructor. I could teach it myself. Not that I look thin these days. I sit too much and eat too much."  (diva-like whisper) He doesn't need an instructor; he could teach it himself. (with this,  The Corsair  presently resumes his very sorry indeed "snarky-growly"  urlLink Lou Grant  impression with light touch of Ugandan accent about the "o's").  The Corsair  gives Lipton an  A  regarding his "gym" grade on the self-promoting art of talking publicly about the fact that -- yes -- you  do indeed  work out. The only fault contained therein is that he didn't talk publicly about working out in front of a  mirror , or,  better yet , a window facing out towards the public on, say, the Lower East Side or the Meatpacking District or even out in Hells Kitchen, where the biker gangs don't take kindly to that sort of thing. Now,  that  would have been  urlLink de trop , but not  too  trop, I think. The grade  could  have fallen to an  A-Minus  had he simply said he used Pilates, which is, quite frankly, a little 2003, but Lipton recounted a clever little anecdode of good times shared with  Joseph Pilates , or "Joe", as Lipton intones gravely, hinting at mortality, making us all seem  just a little bit  more uncool in that world that Lipton, and Lipton  alone , so excellently occupies. Riding on that "Joementum," buying the gym is a bit much, almost too put on, but it worked -- mainly because he can buy gyms for grieving widows. Very  urlLink Conrad Bain  as  urlLink Mr. Drummond  in Diffr'nt Strokes.   Levine continues in the interview:  " Favorite household chore : I do very few things in the world well, but one of the things I do well is frame and hang pictures. I am most fastidious about my pictures. I go around straightening them all day."   The Corsair  grades Lipton a C on that one. A solid C. The modesty rings false, bro, and I should know. This is the same thing I went and done did with that interview of myself. This is bigger than the both of us, Jamesy (slaps around a sloppily constructed hand made effigy of James Lipton):  It's not about the mundane you  ... it's about the people you know (grabs effigy and points out well beyond the fourth wall of comedy, and towards "the stars" with a "nurtured in the wilderness" look) and all that powerful juju that you spout out on tv that involve  them  ... do it for the children, James. That you straighten pictures is not as interesting as  who  is in those pictures, James. Who, James, (shakes a voodoo effigy of Lipton, looks confused)  who ... ?!  The interview goes onwards:  " Pre-show ritual : We shoot on Monday nights. I will already have done two weeks' research. Then Friday morning through Monday afternoon I am incommunicado. My wife and I will dine and talk, but those four days are sacrosanct. I am in my study preparing my questions. I print out my blue cards at around 4 on Monday afternoon."   Erm , a B. He communicated " urlLink incommunicado ." Which ... we like,   I guess.  Somewhat.  Next:  " Post-show ritual : Often the guest and I have dinner afterward. I don't eat before the show. We go to  Elaine's , and we eat and talk until 1 or 2 in the morning. We did it with  Harrison Ford  and  Mike Myers ;  Charlize Theron  and her mother; and  John Travolta ."   Fuck, an A-Plus  grand slam, Lipsky. We can forgive the unfortunate reference to  urlLink John Travolta  and  urlLink Mike Myers  because through that thicket he leads us, gently, by the hand, to a tasty slice o' A-Listers, like:  urlLink Charlize Theron  and  urlLink Harrison Ford  jammed into the same thought with  urlLink Elaine's .  Shmears .  Next:  " Favorite outfit : My wife has to put me together. Sartorially, I am a disaster. I have no taste. I am from Michigan. I am a Midwesterner with Midwestern taste."  Hmmm. We will admit that the red-state thing should have fucked with his  GPA . But he was  bold  about it. That Midwest comment so  falsely articulated  radiated just the  right  amount of authenticity. It reminded me of my Grandfather's homebrewed bannana beer back in Uganda.  James Lipton , seems to be shouting out to the indifferent, Sartrian universe, that he is  not  afraid of his roots. Lipton is at one with his inner Americana. Although James is actually so Chardonnay -sipping-and-Brie-munching University-professor-blue-state-type that it hurts, he's  not afraid  to admit he was born in the heartland, most likely munching a cheeseburger and clutching at a gun as he emerged triumphantly from the afterbirth, crawling towards Tinseltown with stars in his eyes. And although he has risen to the heights that only  urlLink John Travolta's jet  can presume to attain, James is still "down" with  urlLink the common man.  And mentioning the old ball-and-chain, the long-suffering Mrs. Lipton added  depth  to his little performance of self. I'll give an controversial A to this "revelation", paced very well in the story.  Again:  " Luxury he can't live without : Our home in  Bridgehampton , without question. It is my oasis, my salvation."  Oh, A, buddy boy.  An A answer if there ever was one, Mr. Oasis (smiles admiringly); Mr. Salvation (taps effigy on the back). Bridgehampton is  not  the Hamptons, and that's good, bacause the Hamptons is filled with Soprano's-type-brokers who usually snack on strippers, but come Friday after Memorial Day, try, in vain, to munch on that late twentysomething  Manolo Blahnik -type weekend gold digger (fake waves) that is way --  oh, so very way  -- out of their league. The Hamptons is  so over . But the  urlLink artistic-literary Bridgehampton  is forever. It is the new  urlLink P-Town .   More!   " Car : A Mercedes S.U.V. I love that car. I'm not a P.C. person. I sit there royally in my S.U.V. and never think about the gas consumption."  (BZZzzzz)  Ahhh  *all disappointed*, sorry about that, James, but we have a wondeful consolation prize for you backstage: a  B-Plus  at best. A Mercedes SUV would have been an A-Plus answer back in 2002, but the war, the WMDs ... uhhh,  no . A Toyota  urlLink Prius  was the answer we were looking for, James. So sorry.  " Oscar-night plan : I'm going to the  Vanity Fair party in L.A . I went last year. If you are not nominated, and obviously I am not, the worst thing in the world to have to sit through is an awards ceremony. So I watched it at the party.   An  A . It would have been an A-Plus but for the fact that James forgot to mention  urlLink Graydon Carter . In fact, I think it is actually trademarked as the "GraydonCarterOscarParty (TM)" -- or something along those lines. Still, this was a respectable showing for a self-proclaimed Midwesterner.  " Biggest shock of his life : I wrote the book and lyrics for a musical called  urlLink 'Sherry, ' which opened and closed in 1967. In the aftermath, the orchestrations disappeared, but they turned up in the Library of Congress in 2000. On Feb. 24,  Angel Records  is bringing out an album of the show with  Nathan Lane ,  Carol Burnett ,  Bernadette Peters ,  Tommy Tune  and  Mike Myers ."   Nathan Lane  and  Bernadette Peters  are so Theater royalty. A Solid  A-Plus .  Tommy Tune  may have been a bit much, though, but I'm not buying that line of argument.    Anyhoo , Lipton goes on, even doing the Proust questionaire, saying his favorite word is  honor . Hmmm.  Not bloody likely , I'm afraid, try: FAME, or any derivative with similar connotation .... but check the interview out anyway  urlLink here .

       Who Will Be Kerry's Running Mate   Don't you know that  urlLink Todd Purdham of the NY Times  could have been  waay  ahead of the curve had he just logged into  The Corsair  back on  February 2, 2004 , when I gave my Veep picks for  Kerry , which look alot like his. But  nooo  ...   Anyhoo : we're not mad. But just to show how mighty our crystal ball is -- and we are not talking to political insiders like Purdham is -- let me "republish" my picks. Which, like I said before, look alot like Purdhams, although mine are about 2 weeks earler. Hmm.  The Corsair  as mightier than the  Old Grey Lady  ... we like, we  like !  Feb 2, 2003  redux :  Okay, barring a strong  urlLink John Edwards win in South Carolina   and a strong  urlLink Clark win in Oklahoma , you can gag the Democratic side of this election season with a fork, because, my little pomegranates,  it's done , and John Kerry will likely be the nominee. ( ed note, Feb 14, 2004 : he prolly still will) But who will Kerry pick for Veep? Here are some thoughts:   urlLink Max Cleland .  The Corsair  believes that he is the likely choice for a running mate.  Pros:  From Georgia, brings the South back into the mix ... former Senator ... triple amutee war hero would make a strong veterans campaign with Kerry --  and Vets are liely Republican voters  ... expert on Homeland Security (big plus, as national security is a Republican stronghold) which Bill Clinton in a closed door meeting warned that the nominee must be strong on ... strong on health care ... could humiliate chicken hawk Cheney in a debate  Cons : Health might be an issue. ( ed note: Feb 14, 2004 : it's a fucking long ass sojourn through the country for a Veep, from Labor Day till the election -- can Cleland do it? I think so.  Odds on favorite )   urlLink Gary Hart   Pros : Vast intellect, PhD, Oxford, Political Philosophy ... wise from his time out in the political wilderness ... Strong in the Southwest ... devastating debator  Cons : Old adultery charge may still stick in the Bible Belt ... may be more useful to the Democratic Party in a Senate bid against the very weak  Ben Knighthorse Campbell  ... Possible Secretary of State, a la his hero, Jefferson ( ed note: Feb 14, 2004 : with Drudge infused affair allegations riding the ethers, stick this pick with a fork, baby, it's done)   urlLink John Edwards .  Pros : Young up-and-comer, would play well with Kerry, lookswise ... Could bring the South, providing he can win the South Carolina primary and show strong in Arizona and Oklahoma ... has a base in the Dem party ...  ferocious  debator honed from years as a trial lawyer taking on corporate powerhouses who, often,  pleaded  to settle out of court rather than face Young Edwards.  Cons : Young, inexperienced ... former trial lawyer with a mile long money trail to their lobbies. ( ed note Feb 14, 2004 : after Cleland, this one is the hot pick, though the Edwards camp is seething about the  urlLink hot mike Kerry comment that Edwards , "can''t even win his own state." Will Edwards bite the bullet, silence raging campaign staff and be a good Veep for the good of the party and himself?)    urlLink Bill Richardson  Pros: Governor of ultra-crucial New Mexico ... Latino ... former UN Ambassador and  urlLink seasoned diplomat  would give international cooperation credit points to ticket   Cons : None. ( ed note: Feb 14, 2004 : hot like salsa)   urlLink Wesley Clark  Pros: Longshot, but if he wins big in Oklahoma and the conservative Southwest he could be in the cut ... General would give strong military backing to ticket ... would humiliate chickenhawk Cheney in a debate ... strong with African-Americans   Cons : Too closely tied to Bill Clinton, who wants Hillary '08, which may be an issue. ( ed note: Feb 14, 2004 : Wes is bitter as the Clintonistas dumped his ass as soon as he started looking like yesterday's donuts. Could be Sec of Defense in a Kerry White House. An effective military attack dog. Will work well with a Cleland Veep)   urlLink Dick Gephardt   Pros : Outside of Cleland and Edwards, the most likely running mate ... most popular pol in pivotal swing state Missouri ... would be perfect for a Kerry-Gephardt Northern labor-veterans strategy against a Bush South ... comes with the backing of labor, a Democratic must needs ... a truly good guy who dropped out and endorsed Kerry early:  he did the right thing   Cons : Wooden on the stump,  charismatically challenged  (ed note: Feb 14, 2004: this ticket may be too damn Northern top heavy. Could be the  greatest  and  most powerful  Sec of Labor in US history in a Kerry White House)   urlLink Evan Bayh  Pros: Young up and comer, popular moderate Democrat from a Republican state ... would look good stumping with Kerry ... strong political family ... Would play well in Bush states ... hugely ambitious for national office, a quick study   Cons : A long shot ... may not even be able to deliver Indiana, his home state, against Bush ( ed note: Feb 14, 2004 : not bloody likely, but it would harken to the Tom Sawyer-Huck Finnish days of Clinton-Gore '92)   urlLink Bob Graham   Pros : Most Aggressively Campaigning for this position ... got out early ... most popular elected official in CRUCIAL Florida ... Senate Intelligence Committee  Cons : Bad ticker ... charisma challenged. (ed note: Feb 14, 2004: The Corsair believes that Graham, who lusts after this position so badly that our computer screen is blurred, prolly had a deal with the Dean peeps, so he may be radioactive to Kerry; then again loyalty, in politics, is  urlLink mobile, like la donna )

       An Interview of Ron Mwangaguhunga by Ron Mwangaguhunga   What's your name?   Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I present an interview with  Ron Mwangaguhunga    What's the Ron short for? Ronald?   It's short for Irony, the "I" and the "why" are silent.   Is that African?   Ugandan, I was born in Uganda, raised there, and London briefly, then Ottawa, Canada (The Corsair shivers) and Manhattan.   Sounds like you were you a military brat   Close. I was a diplobrat, a culturally significant animal that shares many of the same character traits. My dad was Uganda's Consul to the Embassy in Canada in the early 70s, then Ambassador to the US and finally the UN in the late 70s, while chairing the UN's Law of the Seas Commission. Growing up in the shadow of the UN in the 70s is about as idealistic as it gets. At the dinner table we spoke of Human Rights and The Year of the Child.   What was growing up in Canada as a Ugandan like?    Fucking cold, hombre . Wicked cold. And Canada in the 70s was kind of like Kentucky on ice. Lots of country and western on the radio, for some odd reason and people had CB radios in their living rooms. Trucker culture was very big there. I grew up to  urlLink Dolly Parton's Jolene  ,  Crystal Gayle ,  Johnny Cash  tunes. And it was wild up North: humungous coyotes and coy dogs and wolves would wander into the city often, with patchy fur and tongues dragging, which, for a morsel-sized tidbit of a Ugandan boy, is kind of scary. I believe we were the first black people anyone in the town had ever seen. We did a good job representing, I must say. And, to this day, I get along with white people. White people like me.   And you went to the UN School in Manhattan   Yup.  Dustin Hoffman's  daughter was one year ahead of me. I should have scored her, but I was far too concerned with drawing pictures of dinosaurs at the time. You can imagine that she was very popular after  urlLink Kramer vs. Kramer  swept the Oscars. Those UN kids were fucking sophisticated. Everyone saw the Oscars, the major sporting events, the Presidential addresses, and discussed them. I believe some Kindergarteners actually had briefcases, but I may just be lying. The older kids did what rich sons and daughters of powerful people did in the 70s -- they went to dicos and fucked.  Very internationalist, this school. We sang Native American folk songs, did karate in gym class, studied world art: it was about educating possible world leaders and all that. The conservative hilbillies who oppose internationalism should look at the languages and music and literature curricula at the  urlLink UN School  before they express their own aggressive ignorance. (Ed Note: In retrospect I can see that this line earned me the hate mail, but bear in mind it was written in the heat of the build up to the Iraq War)   You went to college in Vermont.   Right,  urlLink Marlboro College , which had a large proportion of studious, beautiful kids dressed in  LL Bean  pajama tops and faded blue jeans, talking contemporary philosophy and comparative literature. We did a lot of cross country skiing and amateur astronomy at our own planetarium -- of course, there were monsterous amounts of the "sticky ickey." It was Vermont.  It seemed like the thing to do. Marlboro was  urlLink Secret History  by  Donna Tartt  without the murder. I wanted to be a writer. I transferred out to go to  urlLink Saint John's College , where I immersed myself in the  Classics  and  Ancient Greek , then I went back to Marlboro and studied Literature and Philosophy. You'll see scattered references, like archaic ruins, alluding to the classics in my blog. I have to get my monies worth somehow.   When did the 80s end?   Somewhere in  urlLink Secret History   Donna Tartt  says rightly that the magical weekend always officially ended (for kids of the 70s) with the  urlLink Wonderful World of Disney , at 7pm on Sunday night. That's when one did one's homework.  Officially  the 80s ended the moment  Rob Lowe  gave  Demi Moore  his  urlLink St. Elmo's Fire  speech. The decade ended when Billy intoned: "This isn't real. You know what it is? It's St. Elmo's Fire. Electric flashes of light that appear in dark skies out of nowhere. Sailors would guide entire journeys by it. But the joke was on them. There was no fire. There wasn't even a St. Elmo. They made it up. They made it up because they thought they needed it to keep 'em going when times got tough. Just like you're making up all of this. We're all going through this.  It's our time on the edge ." Just like that with that gravelly world-weary voice:  it's our time on the edge . And with that, the 80s abruptly ended as Billy took the Greyhound bus out of Georgetown with his loaded six string on his back. Lowe always knew that you leave a party while the gettings good: look at how he exited the  urlLink West Wing before it jumped the shark .   So you've heard about the Kerry affair?    Alleged  affair. Who  urlLink hasn't . It's today's shadenfreude. If it is true, it won't help  Dean , who supposedly chose to fight on in Wisconsin because he was privy to the info. If it is true, it will help  John Edwards , whom I have always believed is the strongest candidate to tackle Bush. (Ed Note: This turned out as a hoax)   What's up with your obsession with RZA?   He's  crazy  like  urlLink Swayzee . He's like the wind. Crazy people are interesting. Plus he feeds his kids colloidal silver --  hello ? His kids are going to look pretty  urlLink Smurfy  pretty soon, because  urlLink colloidal silver turns you blue .   What's up with the site design? It makes my eyes bleed   Hey,  The Corsair  is no frills. I'm a content man. What? You don't like the pea soup and electric blue motif? (Ed Note: If you remember, this site used to be designed really badly)   No. And what's up with speaking in the third person like that. And what's a Corsair?    The Corsair  was sort of a  urlLink Spy Magazine  in  urlLink nineteenth century Denmark . They attacked one of my favorite philosophers,  Kierkegaard , in a way that remarkably anticipated the way tabloids attack the famous today in this age of shadenfreude. I like to think we are continuing in the tradition of  The Corsair , but that I would have incorporated Kierkegaard's critique of our snarky democratic leveling and asked him to join the masthead. Kierkegaard was an OG blogger --  real old school .  urlLink Hegel  was his nemesis. It was on like  urlLink Grey Poupon  when those two slung the snark.   Are you crazy?   No, that's a  misconception ; I'm eccentric. I do yoga. I am  opinionated . I like cheesy celebrity gossip and  urlLink Herodotus .  Annie Lennox  told  Time Magazine  this week that she thinks of herself as a "thought factory." I like that. (Ed Note: The pretentious meter goes off the charts on that one, guys, sorry)   You're kind of all over the place. What's your mandate?   I cover media, gossip, fashion, politics, tv, fashion,  urlLink classical civilizations  -- a little bit of everything,  fo' shizzle . It's a bonfire of the vanities every day at Corsair. I am going to try and incorporate the business world more into this also.   What's with the Cutty Sark?   Like most writers, I drink copiously. It was said at Saint Johns that I in my brief time there I drank the equivalent of the Chesapeake in gin and tonics. I don't dispute the claim.  urlLink Cutty Sark  is my beverage of choice. And  no , I don't get paid to say that.   What are you like?   Shy, very shy, always flirty with the ladies, grave, African, occasionally amusing, scruffy -- I sport a "nurtured in the wilderness" look. A cross between  David Chappelle  and  urlLink Mircea Eliade .   How long have you been blogging?   Since October 2003.   Do you like people to correct you?   I do. I'd rather have someone email me that I misspelled the name of  Sofia Copolla , like a fine reader from CBS Marketwatch did, rather than look like an ass with the name out there. Better a correction than the 8 to 10 pieces of hate email I get.   And what's your obsession with Bill Murray?   The first movie I ever saw was  urlLink Meatballs , and he is really interested in  urlLink Gurdjieff , which I am too, and have been for close to a decade. Bill can do no wrong as far as I'm concerned. He is the coolest man in America.   Presumably you've worked in the media world   Presumably. I've either worked at or written for  The Nation ,  New York Magazine ,  Paper ,  New York Press , former NYC classical radio station WNCN, Fashion Week Daily, National Review Online,  Sonicnet , which was absorbed by  MTV Interactive , and  urlLink MacDirectory , where I was editor in chief.   What do you like?   You mean aside from  urlLink Naomi Campbell  and the  urlLink Max Mara models ? I'm, assuming you mean blogs. As far as blogs go, I like the usual.  urlLink Choire Sicha  really made me laugh about a week ago when, as an aside, he mentioned that  NY Social Diary  had blacks in the party pictures, which is unusual to say the least. I must say here that I like  David Patrick Columbia  and he has had nice things to say about my site, but the Upper East Side that he often covers is, well,  you know .  urlLink Newyorkish  is the sweet spot.  urlLink Socialite Life  is a place I frequent. I think  urlLink Elizabeth Spiers  is a hottie. I love  urlLink Lowculture , actually I am an addict. I am a  urlLink Lockhart Steele  addict as well. And  urlLink TMFTML  and  urlLink Uncle Grambo  and his quest to broaden the english language. And I read  urlLink Musto  on line, and  urlLink Rush and Molly  and  urlLink Page Six . And  urlLink Old Hag . And  urlLink Romenesko  and  urlLink VH1's Best Week Ever Blog . Oh dear, I hope I got everybody. That  urlLink Jen Chung  of Gothamist ... yummmy. And Memefirst. We love  urlLink memefirst . I like  urlLink Bunsen  too. (Ed Note: This is massive ass kissing, on a cosmic scale, of which I am now ashamed, but I was new, at the time, and needed to kiss the right as to get me where I am today, which is somewhere in the Middle of the heap. Not my finest hour)  What would be your ideal media job?  Writing for  Jon Stewart  or  VH1  or  Trio  or -- gasps -- Dave Chappelle might be fun. But everyone writing in NY who writes wants to do that.   That's like saying, oh, I'd love to write and executive produce a drama for HBO. Like, you and everyone else, tough guy. But I do. If my boss is reading this, my current job is my ideal media job.       Spy was obviously an influence.    Spy  and  Spiers ,  Taki ,  Gore Vidal ,  Nabokov ,  Basquiat  and  Alan Thicke .  Thicke of the Night  was big with me. Just kidding.  urlLink The Big Blue Marble  and  urlLink Land of the Lost  and the  urlLink Figure 8 Schoolhouse Rock  Song were big with me; figure 8 got me wondering about infinity and eternal recurrence. My questions on the nature of Time, however, were somewhat resolved in a gentlemanly stalemate over the tv show  urlLink Voyagers , featuring  urlLink Meeno Peluce  as a corsair who defied the linearity of time. Rock on Meeno Peluce. (And, RIP, Jon-Eric Hexum)   What other TV Shows?   Oh, lots:  urlLink The Edge of Night ,  urlLink Upstairs/Downstairs ,  urlLink Poldark ,  urlLink The Linda Carter Variety Show ,  urlLink Good Times ,  Sherman Hemlsley  on  urlLink The Jeffersons , the first black self made millionaire on tv that didn't take over a third world country by junta -- actually every black man between 25 and 35 in America was influenced by Sherman. He's like the black Jesus.  urlLink Fame the TV Show , I always wonder why they don't put repeats on  Trio  or  VH1 , that was a great show in the first few seasons.  urlLink James at 15  is another show that I cannot imagine has evaporated: "It is so choice. If you have the means I highly suggest picking one (DVD) up." Very tender.  urlLink Kiss Meets The Phantom  ... too many to name. But  I, Claudius  was the watershed event. I wouldn't have studied the classics if not for that. And the  Hardy Boys , dark. The whole ground of being of the 70s had that dark gritty urban vive to it: from  Baretta  to  OPEC .   And what about movies?    urlLink Ingmar Bergman  is my personal Jesus. Fucking haunting, that man. Watching his movies makes me hungry because you burn so many calories paying attention to the music, the emerging themes, the lighting, that fucking abrupt  Sven Nykvist  close up. Bergman also has this  High Serious  vibe about him that is attractive. Not many people nowadays approached art with a  urlLink Rembrantian reverence , just look at a punk like  Andy Warhol . He's a very strange Northern wind twisting through the labyrinth of Western art.  urlLink Autumn Sonata ,  Cries and Whispers ,  Shame  and  urlLink From The Life of the Marionettes  are works of art every bit as great as anything done by  urlLink Vermeer  or  urlLink Josquin de Pres . Last week's NY Times Arts and Leisure said that Bergman is spooky, and he is: spooky like  urlLink Jaime Summers pulling off the face of a fembot.    Music tastes?   The earlier the better. Classical implies after Mozart, and that's too late for me. Early early music at the  urlLink root  of the musical impulse is what I am after. Aside from the random  urlLink Schubert  or  urlLink Wagner  piece, music has been going downhill since the middle 18th century. I love  urlLink Medieval  and  urlLink Renaisance  music. It has charm and I love the embroidery. Give me some  urlLink Monteverdi drama , or  urlLink Dietrich Buxtheheude  and I'm raring to go. I also love world folk music, especially  urlLink Corsican polyphony , it is very pure; then there's East African traditional music, and  urlLink Tibetan chants  that sound like mountain wind,  urlLink Russian Orthodox chant . And  urlLink freeform jazz  and  John Cage  when I'm smoking the  urlLink sweet leaf , which is increasingly rare as I am now over 30, and it is a well known fact that if you smoke weed after 30 something is wrong with you. Of course, for fucking and dancing one needs the requisite  Mobb Deep . One can't fuck properly to  Philip Glass .   Books?   In no particular order:  urlLink Ada or Ardor  by  Nabokov , which is complicated, but once you work out all the family relationships, it gets fun.  urlLink The Forbidden Forest  by  urlLink Eliade . The Forbidden Forest is like a  urlLink bouillabaisse  or a  urlLink cassoulet . It changes depending on the season you read it. I broke up with my fiance and the book had special meaning for me, and I just rred it a few weeks ago and the book -- or me -- was dramatically different. Like a bouillabaisse with white wine in winter as opposed to one with beer in the summer. I adore  urlLink John Fowle's Magus  and  urlLink Sophocles Oedipus at Colonus .   Will you sell out?   Depends on how you define it. Will I jump at the chance if, say,  urlLink Trio  or  urlLink GQ  asks me to be their official blogger, or one of the cable networks offers me a footstep in the writing door. Or if Dave Chappelle or John Stewart wants me as a writer? Of course. I'd like to be recognized for the work I put in here. But will I alter or change my content? Never.  Well , I won't use cursewords. But I like what I do now, which I don't want to say, they let me do my blog at work, just so long as I make my deadlines. But in the future I want to write for TV.   Who would you most like to take on a desert island with you.   Oh, without a doubt  urlLink Helena Christiensen .  urlLink Helena Christiansen  is proof that there is a Divine Intelligence shaping the destiny of man. God, she's fucking  urlLink incredibly gorgeous . And Naomi Campbell, I don't care how skanky my friends at Page Six say she is. I'd just wear a suit of armor.   Thanks   No problem. Pour me a glass of The Sark on your way out.  (The Corsair will not be "published" tomorrow due to mi vida loca. Sorry)

       Samuel L. Jackson's Subway Nightmare   In the  March 2004   urlLink FHM Magazine ,  Samuel L. Jackson  tells this harrowing tale of the  urlLink evil subway . A "very special" Corsair:  " I was riding the A train late at night. I was getting off the train and there was a woman in front of me who had some shopping bags, and one broke. I stopped, very un-New York like, and helped her pick up her stuff. When the door closed, I had one foot in the subway, and one on the platform. Luckily for me I was in the last car. As the train took off, I was snatched off by my feet and my body twisted, ripping all the shit in my knee. I was dragged along, dodging the poles and I couldn't get my shoe off. Eventually somebody pulled the emergency chord which stopped the train. I didn't find out until a year later when I was in court that the reason it took so long to pull the chord was that the guy who did was on crutches."

       Trump Loves Pennies   "I'm not a big fan of the handshake ... I think it's barbaric, shaking hands, you catch colds, you catch the flu, you catch this, you catch all sorts of things." If you identified  urlLink Donald Trump  as the author of this oft-repeated riff then you are dead on.  The trouble is that it doesn't mesh with a comment he made to FHM in the March issue. Check out this slice:   Trump : If I see a penny on the sidewalk, I always pick it up, because, psychologically, I want to do that."   FHM :  Seriously?    Trump : Absolutely. I do it all the time. That's the way I am.  Okay, leaving aside the fact that this is utter and complete bullshit, lets zero on the whole penny-hygiene thing. Donald Trump, worth, roughly $2 billion bending over, ass akimbo, picking up Abe Lincoln's from the gritty expectorate laden Midtown streets. And yet he will not shake hands?   Priceless.

       Smackdown: Dick Morris vs Bill Clinton   From  Behind the Oval Office , by  Dick Morris  p. 64-5:  "At about midnight, (then Governor Bill) Clinton  joined Hillary,  Gloria Cabe , his campaign manager, and me in a cozy breakfst room off the kitchen. My polling (for a 1990 gubernatorial reelection fight) showed that  McRae  offensive (Bill's ooponent) had dropped Clinton's share vote to a meage 43 percent. Generally, when an incumbent's share of the polls dropped below 50 percent in the polls, it means he is likely to lose ... Clinton's temper got the better of him. Exhausted, worried, and angry, he exploded. 'You got me into this race,' he screamed, 'so you could make some extra money off me. That was the only reason. And now you give me no attention, no attention at all. I'm about to lose this election, this primary, against a nobody' ... Clinton has a terrible temper ... In pain and facing that harsh criticism, I lost my temper too. If he was too hasty in his criticism, I was too sharp in my reply. Storming out of the breakfast room  through the kitchen toward the door outside, I rallied, 'Thank you, thank you, thank you. You've just solved my problem. I'm getting shit from Atwater and shit from Lott for working for you, and now I can solve my problem. Go fuck yourself. I'm quitting your goddamn campaign, and now I am a free agent. I can be a fifty state Republican and don't have to take your shit.'  "Clinton charged up behind me as I stalked towards the door, grabbed me from behind, and wrapped his arms around me to stop me from leaving. I slipped to the floor. Hillary helped me to my feet. The moment I stood up Clinton became apologetic. 'Don't go, don't go I'm sorry. Don't go, I;m sorry,' he said as I walked out the door, slamming it behind me.. Hillary ran after me to calm me down. She put her arms around my shoulders and walked me around the grounds of the mansion. "Please forgive him," she pleaded. 'He's under so much pressure. He didn't mean it. He's very sorry. He's overtired, he hasn't slept well in days. He's not himself. He values you. He needs you,' she repeated.  "I calmed down enough to drive to my hotel, and I called Eileen (his wife) shaking in rage. Later Hillary called to tell me how much Bill wanted me back. Then he came on line to apologize ... I couldn't leave Clinton three weeks before his primary, but from then on I dealt with him in a formal, almost frosty way. I stopped calling him Bill, always adressed him as Governor, and left when our meetings were over rather than hang around and chat."

       RZA is Crazy    The Corsair  has many media obsessions but one of his favorites is  RZA . The RZA is crazy. Nutso. He eats ungodly amounts of  urlLink colloidal silver , even  proffering it to his offspring  need we say more?   One day  RZA  and his babies are going to turn blue from a colloidal silver overdose and then people will take me seriously.  Anyhoo : here's what he had to say to  FHM :   FHM : How strong is your Kung Fu?   RZA : "Strong, but I've never used it. One of my uncles trains CIA agents. He was offended I was learning from someone else, so he showed me this one move. He said, 'I could cripple you.' I believed him but he had to prove it. I was hurt for three months."  Okay ... leaving aside the implausibility that one of RZA's uncles is in the intelligence gathering business, how many people out there have familial relations that whisper  urlLink Moon Knight -like threats.  Being family is not about crippling one another . The interview concludes:   FHM : Is there an RZA sex tape out there?   RZA : I don't leave evidence like that. I form the lense with my hand, look through it and tape record with my mind.  What-the- fuck ?!

       Reba McEntyre Calls in Sick    urlLink Medialife  reports that country music crooner Reba is unhappy with her salary at WB. Does anyone watch this drivel:  " Reba McEntire  has called in sick to the WB Network at least twice in the past month, stating that she could not film episodes of her sitcom 'Reba' due to a 'family emergency' in Oklahoma. Rumors have now surfaced that McEntire is displeased with her current salary, but she is expected to return to work today without having renegotiated her contract."  Hmmm. What would that phone call sound like?   Executive Producer Allison Gibson : Hello?  Reba: H'lo, Allison?  Allison: Yes, Reba? Reba? We are going to start shooting in ten minutes. Where are you?  Reba: Uhm, My uncle who trains CIA agents in Oklahoma's trailer done blew up. He was making crystal meth and something ignited.  Allison: (skeptically) Yes, well, I'm sorry to hear that. This wouldn't have anything to do with your salary.  Reba: Uhm. It might.  Allsion: What's wrong.  Reba: I just don't think someone on tv should be making $8.50 an hour.  Allsion: This isn't tv, Reba, it's the WB.

       Adam Moss at New York   Via  urlLink Gawker  via  urlLink Mediabistro  we learn that NY Times culture czar is replacing that punchy paige boy haircut  Caroline Miller  at  urlLink New York . The Corsair is not really happy about this, as  Adam Moss  had the disgusting little habit when he was editor at the  New York Times Magazine  of running cover stories on  African  and  African Americans  as alien species to be observed under a (makes quote marks with fingers) "concerned" liberal microscope, the African American " urlLink down low" AIDS piece , the impoverished adopted Sudanese immigrant story, the Nigerian women about to be stoned story and, of course, the Death Row Gangsta Rap cover stories are hallmarks of the  Adam Moss  school of editing.   We hope that Adam Moss doesn't bring that kind of shit to New York Magazine.

       GroupHug.US   A confession from  urlLink grouphug.us :  "I'm female-19, on my way to being very well educated and a good citizen. I love violence. Violent movies turn me on like you cannot believe. Kill Bill I was this amazing sexual experience for me. All the guys I'm attracted to are either really gifted martial artists or talented in some other sort of violent activity like boxing. This attraction worries me."  And:  "On the outside I'm very humble, but inside, I know I rule a lot."  Also:  "I would never go through with it, but I have a fantasy about my teacher. He recently had his 30th birthday. I'm 17. He acts flirty with a few girls he teachers, I'm one of them. He plays with my hair alot. Even though he's happily married, I want so badly to seduce him. He's told me I'm good-looking, that I have great skin, he likes my hair a certain way...he's blown me a kiss during class before, as well.  "I don't think he'd go through with it, either...but I want so badly to know what he thinks of me. I want him to want me, like I want him.  "I feel like such a jerk."  And who could leave out:  "i have a summer job working in corn feilds with a bunch of other people. over the years i have perfected taking a dump while walking through the field"   Good times .  urlLink Grouphug.us

       Whatever Happened to the NY Press?   The  NY Press  used to be an interesting read -- all snarky and conservative and above all  relevant  -- and now it has become an Eastern European literary magazine.  What happened!  I once even wrote an article on  The Great Books  for them a la   urlLink Alan Bloom  . It was the anti-Village Voice, young, angry, smart and media centric; low on facts, hard on rhetoric: New York Press was the Zeitgeist, it was a dissonant more working class continuation of the  Spy Magazine  tradition. I miss it, god damn it.  Russ Smith  sold it for $2 million, but he should have taken the the great  Taki Theodoropoulos  made him years ago -- $5 million.  urlLink   The worst hangover I have ever had was after a Taki dinner party at  Elaine's  for sex offender  Scott Ritter  -- I shit you not. Only, he wasn't a child offender at the time, he was opposing  Clinton  and  Hussein  ... it's a loong story. Anyway, the last thing I remember was drinking with Taki and  Chris Buckley  in the back of  Elaine's  arguing over the  Great Books  ... and I woke up very, very sick. Never try to drink a Greek writer under the table. And never,  I mean never , try to outdrink  Christopher Hitchens  ... but that's another story.

       Vagina Monologue   Showing off our liberal arts education, my momologue comes from  Machiavelli's Discorsi Sopra la Prima Deca Di Tiudo Livio, III, 6 : it concerns  Caterina Sforza Riario , a great beauty of her day and a woman Machiavelli thaught of fondly, "(Some conspirators) killed  Count Giordano , their lord, and took his wife and small children. Since they did not see how they could be secure if they did not become masters of the fortress, and the castellan were not willing to cede it to them, Madonna Caterina (so the Countess was called) promised the conspirators that if they let her enter it, she would deliver it over to them and they could keep the children with them as hostages. With this pledge they let her enter. As soon as she was within, she stood on the walls and berated them for the death of her husband and threatened them with every kind of revenge. And to show that she did not worry about her children, she showed them her  genitals , saying she still had the means to make more of them." What an Italian woman!  Machiavelli  knows how to tell a story, dammit.

       Andrew Cuomo: The Art of Losing   "The agony of defeat. It seems magnified in a political election, that modern day crusade and zero-sum game. There is no silver medal award for finishing second. Elections consume body and soul.  "My race was great political theater. I was running last year in a primary to defeat George Pataki, who defeated my father Mario Cuomo. The New York press had choreographed the campaign into an Italian opera in which the son was to avenge the father's death. There was no romance in the opera: father dies, and son dies.  "Political loss is unique in that it is public and pervasive. There is no need to whisper in the kitchen 'honey, I didn't get the promotion' after an unsuccessful political campaign, everone knows you lost.  "For me, the pervasive nature of loss became real one day after my withdrawal from the New York governor's race when I was at a gas station. I pulled into a self service station and removed the gas cap. I was excercising all the deliberate caution not to dirty my suit or my tie, which have a proclivity to position itself as a bib for the gas nozzle. I was attempting my personal innovation: wedging the gas cap into the nozzle to avoid having to hold the handle. As this is not easily done, I made several attempts in which the cap fell down and rolled to some inaccessible spot, causing me to have to retrieve it, moving delicately to avoid dirtying myself.  "At this point I looked across the island to see the customer on the other side watching my exhibition. The patron across the way looked at me and said, 'Boy Andrew, losing really stinks -- you even have to pump your own gas.  "Everyone knew. There was no hiding."

       NY Times' Neil Strauss: Porn Writer?   Damn, we had just gotten all up in  Neil Strauss'  grill on Saturday for describing a rambling  Courtney Love  phone call as  Joycean , and now it appears our  New York Times   whipping boy du jour , our boy Strauss is trading up from the Old Grey Lady all done up in curlers and wearing her bloomers contrasted with the  supple  silicon-enhanced porn queen in her prime.  Delicious .   That most excellent media duo  urlLink Rush and Molloy  report that Strauss is ghostwriting the pornobiography of "starlet"  Jenna Jameson .  They write:  "Editors at  urlLink The New York Times  were were, um, taken aback when they learned that music critic  Neil Strauss  was ghost-writing Jameson's memoir,  urlLink How to Make Love Like a Porn Star . Actually, says a source, 'They went insane.'  "Now we hear that Strauss has been talking with Jameson about appearing in her next movie as a male nurse. Our snitch says that Strauss won't be joining in the groaning and groping. Still, it's bound to cause concern on W. 43rd St.  "A Times spokeswoman says Strauss and his bosses 'had a frank and thorough discussion of outside activities. We would not agree that the editors went  insane , or ballistic. They did point out to Neil, with some emphasis, that our guidelines include this passage:  Before accepting a freelance assignment, a staff member should make sure that the tone and content of the publication, Web site or program are in keeping with the standards of The Times ."  The Old Grey Lady is respectable, she defines reality. She will  not  be mocked. La donna e mobile. She wants her journos to be flies on the wall, not  guys on the ball . But  Hmmm.  What would a Strauss-crafted porn script look like,  The Corsair  wonders.  (fade out)  fade in  1a.  INT. HOSPITAL DOCTORS LOUNGE IN THE HOLLYWOOD. DAY    MALE NURSE  TO NO ONE IN PARTICULAR  Boy, it's been a while since I've been able to show some young sugar my bedside manner. All I ever see in this place are Old Grey ladies. I'd love to ...   JENNA JAMESON ENTERS IN SHORT SHORTS   I think I took a wrong turn trying to get back to my room   MALE NURSE   No, honey, you took the  right turn    JENNA   Oh dear, I can't believe I got lost in this hospital. Can you help me get back to my room? I want ...   MALE NURSE , sort of half-sliding and half-oozing from the chair.  I know what you want, baby.   urlLink music  seeps  SEX SCENE ONE  They are interrupted by  Adam Nagourney  YOUNG BUCK, walking in without knocking, with big fake 70s porn moustaches, shortpants and an old USC Film School t-shirt  Oh,  excuse  me, I was looking for the commisary. I was hankering for a slice o' pie.  JENNA JAMESON  Sweetie, I got all the pie you need right here ...  MALE NURSE  And it's the best kind:  Georgia peach!   (Abrupt  Sven Nykvist  close up on Nagourney)  Nagourney looks straight into the camera, cocks his eye and says:   I'll buy that for a dollar!    Alright, enough. But, come to think of it,  The Corsair  can understand why The Old Grey Lady would be jealous that her reporters were giving all their "tender mercies" to Jenna Jameson.

       JLo and Marc Anthony    urlLink Star Magazine , whose publisher  Colleen Wyse , incidentally, is out after just 16 weeks on the job, is reporting in their February 11 issue a budding Latino power coupling between  JLo  and the freshly single  Marc Anthony . A veritable  Jennthony .  "Star has learned that the couple moved on to a very prestigious LA hotel where they spent the next five days holed up in the Presidential Suite, feasting on room service, watching videos, and, according to an insider, 'got reacquainted romantically.' They then traveled on to Miami a week later where Anthony decamped in the guest suite of Lopez' waterfront mansion. Afraid of being spotted with Anthony in public as 'he is still legally married,' the couple took a private boat, the 'Sea Ray,' out for a ride, were seen hugging and kissing and then, went below deck for more privacy."  Below deck? Sea Ray? Below deck? What? Is Star trying to get the  Neil Strauss  Best Porn Screenplay award or something?  Anyhoo: While we're on the subject of  Star , the  urlLink Toronto Globe and Mail  calls the new profile of  IWantMedia.com's  Media Person of the Year  Bonnie Fuller  in  Vanity Fair  "devastating."   A taste : "Even Fuller's reported best friend,  Jane Hess , is quoted as saying, 'She's like a shark.'"

       Senator John Kerry's Horoscope    Senator John Kerry , who has had plastic surgery on his chin and has dated  urlLink Morgan Fairchild  as well as the former  Mrs. Robert Evans , the American born daughter of Yugoslavia's princess Elizabeth,  urlLink Catherine Oxenberg , was born under the sun sign of the  extremely  lucky Sagittarius. And no one of late is so brimming with  urlLink Machiavellian Fortuna  as Kerry, who sat back and watched  Gephardt  and  Dean  essentially bitchslap themselves out of contention in Iowa, and now, at this moment of historical exigency, is poised to watch  Edwards  and  Clark  do much the same thing  urlLink over the South . Here is his horoscope for the day of the  Virginia  and  Tennessee  primaries:  Sagittarius, for February 10, 2004,  urlLink Super Horoscope  (Berkley Books)  "A kind deed in the morning is apt to attract a pleasant and unusual reward. Your investigative skills should be excellent ...  your personal goals should be clearer as today's events validate your direction and strengthen your personal commitment to achieve your personal goal ."  And that horoscope doesn't appear to be off, if the lefty Village Voice's  urlLink James Ridgeway's damning profile  of George Bush in 1972 is any indication. ( UPDATE : The President  urlLink has released his military record ) Ridgeway writes:  "In Alabama, where  George W. Bush  supposedly was slaving away on  urlLink Winton 'Red' Blount's  1972 U.S. Senate campaign in lieu of National Guard duty, he is remembered by a Blount son as a smartass 'cuntsman' from Texas.   "Bush Junior, as he was then called, used to come into Blount's campaign office in Montgomery, prop his feet up on a desk, and blab on about how much he'd drunk the night before, according to a detailed article by New Orleans freelance journalist  Glynn Wilson  on his  urlLink Progressive Southerner blog .  "Blount's Belles, a group of young Republican women and Montgomery debutantes who were helping out on the campaign, would fall into a swoon at the sight of young George. 'We thought he was to die for,' said one. But the Blue Haired Platoon, a group of older women campaigning for Blount, referred to Junior as 'the Texas soufflé' because he was 'all puffed up and full of hot air.'"  Charmed, I'm sure. But things  really  are not going well for the President. His interview with  Tim Russert  made him look weak and uncertain.  The right wing po urlLink litical base is red hot  over his policy compromises on immigration, prescription drugs and weopons of mass destruction.  But of course,  Senator John Kerry  is a fluffy overly  urlLink ambitious hairdo  with  zero substance , so it all works out in the end.

       Fashion Week Buzz: Day 5   An  urlLink Oscar De La Renta Model Took a Nasty Spill . This should fill the daily ration of shadenfreude necessary for the well oiled functioning of an "evolved" democracy.  Onward :   Dead Animal Alert :   urlLink FashionWeekDaily  reports Vogue's editor, " Anna Wintour  looking maximalist in a beaded suit with fur trim and low heeled suede boots"  And, " Nan Kemper  in a fabulous blue leather and fox fur Fendi coat (CH skirt and sweater underneath), and her favorite  Manolo Blahnik  boots."  And "Catherine (Malandrino’s) compensates for a light lower half with a blast of head warmth: enormous poofs of  Davy Crockett  raccoon (or was that coyote?) exploding from the models' heads.   And at the  Paco Rabanne Golden Age Party , three men dressed in python carrying a baby doll,  urlLink also dressed in python .  Our gal, Lookonline's  Marilyn Mirschner  gets the scoop:  "On Tuesday,  urlLink Oscar de la Renta  may have catapulted himself into the 'Hall of Fame' with a show that started - get this - only a mere 15 minutes after it was supposed to begin! Now, that's a record. It's true: while most shows are well over 45 minutes late these days, Oscar's 50- piece presentation was 15 minutes early. In fact, his 1 p.m. show ended before most would have begun. Bravo to Oscar and his associates for pulling that one off.  " ...  Carolina Herrera (who says she was inspired by chic European ski resorts of decades past), was really disappointing. In fact, I overheard a fellow show attendee commenting to a companion that it was so bad, it looked like the collection was 'designed by FIT students.' Ouch!"  And  urlLink WWD's  Ja cob Berstein  and  Greg Lindsay  have a take on things: " André Leon Talley  has made an unusual request this fashion week: he doesn’t want to be anywhere near the front row or the cameras. Part of it is due to the level of, um, scrutiny Talley has been subjected to in the past, but he said he also just wanted to tip his hat to his colleague, sittings editor at large  Camilla Nickerson , whose shoot for October’s Vogue is the 'It' reference of the season. 'The whole thing has spiraled out of control' said Talley. And anyway, he said, 'I’m tall. I can see from the fourth row, the scrum or back in the bleachers. It’s not where you sit. It’s the contribution you bring with your ideas and your talent.'”   And the Patron Saint of All Bloggers, that very cute Southern lass,  Elizabeth Spiers   urlLink wraps things up nicely , "After the 17th iteration of 'Honky Tonk Women,' the runway clears.  Anna Wintour  is sitting on one side of the runway in trademark sunglasses and a bodyguard-protected leather jacket. On the opposite side of the runway sits  Glenda Bailey . They have no problem with the front row or cameras."     Basta!

       Janet Jackson Goes Nude on CD Cover    urlLink Matt Drudge  seems to be hyperventilating as he headlines his site, in all caps as usual, "JANET JACKSON TO GO NUDE FOR NEW CD COVER!" Gawker's very cool  Choire Sicha  captured this hysterical aspect of Drudge's character nicely  urlLink a while ago .   One: Janet Jackson is not nekkid, but topless, covering her boobies up with her arms.  Two: Out of the corner of the CD you can clearly see that she is wearing low rider jeans.  Three: Calm down Drudge, you are beginning to sound like a housewife from Kansas and not a salty journalist in the  urlLink Walter Winchell  tradition (now you know where he gets that stupid hat from) .

       Sir Howard Stringer to BBC?   The sexy but reptilian BBC Washington Correspondent  Katty Kay  made a rather curious remark in the "tell me something I don't know" section of the  Chris Matthews  program this Sunday past. She predicted somewhat ominously that  urlLink Sir Howard Stringer , former head of CBS News, may become the next  BBC Director General .  Half awake, sipping from my usual Sunday Kenyan blend of coffee, the idea was intriguing.  Sir Stringer's bio reads, in part:  "Prior to joining Sony, Mr. Stringer had a distinguished 30-year career as a journalist, producer and executive at CBS Inc. As President of CBS from 1988 to 1995, he was responsible for all the broadcast activities of the company including entertainment, news, sports, radio and television stations. Under his leadership, the CBS Television Network became the first network to rise from last to first place in one season. In 1993, in what became one of the most chronicled coups in television history, Mr. Stringer convinced  David Letterman  to bring his critically acclaimed late night show to CBS.   "From 1986 to 1988, Mr. Stringer served as President of CBS News, where he developed several new programs including the award-winning 48 HOURS, which continues as a primetime hit to this day. Prior to that, during his tenure as executive producer of the CBS EVENING NEWS with  Dan Rather  from 1981 to 1984, that program became the dominant network evening newscast of its day. From 1976 to 1981, while Mr. Stringer was executive producer of the CBS REPORTS documentary unit, it won virtually every major honor, including 31 Emmys, four  Peabody Awards , three  Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Awards , three  Christopher Awards , three  Overseas Press Club Awards , an  ABA Silver Gavel  and a  Robert F. Kennedy Grand Prize . Among his award-winning programs are THE ROCKEFELLERS, THE PALESTINIANS, A TALE OF TWO IRELANDS, THE DEFENSE OF THE UNITED STATES, THE BOAT PEOPLE, THE BOSTON GOES TO CHINA, THE FIRE NEXT DOOR, and THE CIA'S SECRET ARMY. "  The bookies, however,  urlLink according to The Sun , also have  urlLink David Liddiment ,  urlLink Tony Ball ,  urlLink David Elstein ,  urlLink Mark Thomson ,  urlLink Simon Shaps ,  urlLink Dawn Airey  and  urlLink Mark Byford  as front runners.   The Corsair  goes with Katty Kay on this one: Stringer is the most substantive candidate for the Beeb, which my father, Uganda's former Ambassador to the US, then Uganda's former Ambassador to the UN, listens to religiously.

       I, Geraldo: On The Road with Jerry Rivers   Apparently, Fox TV's favorite tragedy chaser,  urlLink Geraldo Rivera  will be taking his show on the road to Iraq.  The Corsair  managed to snag some of his road trip diaries, which, oddly, morphs from the dialogue of a bad 50s tough guy impersonation so favored by conservative hacks like  Peggy "I tell ya" Noonan  into an almost  imperial  prose style:   Day 1 : Lots a burkhas: no slim chance of me scoping out the hot tomata's here. You can't get a glimpse of the dames.  Can't wait to get back to America. I'll bet  urlLink Brian Williams  doesn't need to do stunts like this  urlLink to get ratings . Fucking  pretty boy . I was once a  urlLink Wise Man .    Day 2 : What am I doing here in the Sunni Triangle with  urlLink soldiers who distrust me ? I should be covering the legal angle of some tragedy, or sitting in a comfy New York studio with  urlLink Rita Cosby  dishing on  Michael Jackson . There are trials up the wazoo!  Martha ,  Jacko ,  urlLink Jayson Williams ,  Robert Blake  and  Scott Petersen ... what am I doing here? This scenario is turning grey faster than an incoming President's hair in the first year in office.   Day 3 : Why was I complaining so the past few days: this is the story of the century:  nation building . Ah, the spoils of war. I love the smell of Tikrit in the morning ... it smells like victory. Bismark is said to have once remarked that man can neither create nor direct the stream of time. Nonsense. I,  urlLink Jerry Rivers , will gather the scoop on Babylon. I am a Wise Man.   Day 4 : Have sent  Roger Ailes  a memo to appoint  Annie Liebowitz  as my official photographer. I am already practicing bombastic poses in the mirror. We are not going to do this imperialist  Waugh  travel journo thing half assed.    Day 5 : Looking for a good satanic ritual story for my show. Ailes nixed the idea. May need to punch out some Shiites to punch up ratings.  Fo shizzle .  Day 6: Ailes said ixznay on the  Annie Liebowitz  photo shoot of Geraldo of Arabia. He said it wasn't in the budget. Haven't seen so much bad acting since  urlLink Three Men and a Little Lady . Ailes can pinch a penny till  Abe Lincoln  squeals!   Day 7 : Ya can take the kid outta the Bronx ... &c, &c and all that Jazz. Headed back to Fox studios in New York. Iraq is as distasteful as my  urlLink torrid, torrid affair  with  Bette Middler .

       Twilight of the B-Listers    urlLink Those wacky 3AM Girls  blow up  Paris Hilton's  spot today (I know, that sentence sounds vaguely porny on this end too). Apparently, Paris tried and tried and tried to get into  Clive Davis'  exclusive pre-Grammy party but was  nixed . Cheer up, Paris,  The Corsair  wasn't invited either.  The  3AM Gals  write:  "(The) millionaire hotel heiress had a rude awakening at the weekend when she tried to blag a ticket to record boss Clive Davis's pre-Grammy Awards bash at the Beverly Hills Hotel in LA.  "America's answer to  Lady Victoria Hervey  found out just how far down the celeb list she was when she tried desperately to get an invite.  "For not only did one fail to materialise, but her name was not on the guest list either.  "Yesterday, a spokesman for Davis said: 'Paris wouldn't be on his guest list. Clive Davis's parties are legendary and his list is for musical royalty.'  "So, in desperation, 22-year-old Paris apparently got on the phone and begged Davis, head of  J Records , to let her come. But her pestering didn't impress the music mogul. He was heard telling a companion, 'That girl has been calling me non-stop. Why can't she leave me alone? I don't even know her.'"  But while  The Corsair  sat back and licked his uninvited wounds, Paris was, well, Positively Parisian. So what does a spoiled girl like Paris do when faced with adversity? She gatecrashed with her boytoy  Nick Carter .  Damn, Paris is as ubiquitous on the crimson-gold media landscape as  Joe Trippi .  And speaking of Paris, her former B-Lister paramour  urlLink Joe Francis , the "founder" of the sleazy Decline of Western Civilizationesque  urlLink Girls Gone Wild  videos ( urlLink Paris vacationed in August in Ibiza with young Joe ) is having trouble getting into parties as well, as  Deborah Schoeneman  writes in  urlLink New York :  "Francis, who may be worth upwards of $100 million, is under investigation for taping girls he allegedly knew were underage engaging in lewd acts, but true to form, he hasn’t let that stop him from partying. Large bouncers and a conspicuous lack of invitations, on the other hand, have crimped his style. Francis told friends he had a ticket for the Golden Globes ceremony, but he never showed and wasn’t on any of the studios’ lists. And we hear he was begging (once again) to get into the after-parties. 'I said no,' says one event planner. 'I don’t even think Playboy would welcome him at their parties.' The planner was right, of course. Displaying a strangely admirable tolerance for rejection, Francis showed up solo to Playboy’s Super Bowl party in Houston. 'He was literally begging to get in. I mean, he was explaining how he’s a  celebrity  and he needs to walk on the red carpet and explain what’s going on in his life to the press,' says that party’s gatekeeper. Francis’s worst offense, however, was offering to bring  urlLink Mario Lopez  (Saved by the Bell) to get VIP access. 'Needless to say, he never got in.' Francis didn’t respond to our e-mail."   Meanwhile, Paris has been in a suing mood of late. As  urlLink Medialife  writes:  "Reality TV star Paris Hilton got a reality check when her sex life became public knowledge. Now the scheming socialite has sued a Panama-based internet company for $30 million for illegal distribution of her infamously raunchy tape of her cavorting with ex-boyfriend  Rick Solomon . The 22-year-old hotel heiress has sued  Kahatani Ltd . for violation of privacy, illegal business practices and infliction of emotional distress. Hilton, the star of the Fox reality show 'The Simple Life,' is seeking $15 million in actual damages and $15 million in punitive damages."  There's no such a thing as bad publicity, only too little.

       Mugger Russia   Russian Thug  Vladimir Putin , former Jesuit  John McLaughlin's  political object of affection, has done it again. Proving that Stalin was an amateur, he hasmade one of his chief political opponents in next month's election " urlLink disappear ." Top that,  David Blaine !   Oleg Shchedrov  writes for Reuters (be careful, Oleg!):  "The bizarre mystery surrounding missing Russian presidential candidate  Ivan Rybkin  deepened on Monday when a murder inquiry was opened and then quickly dropped."   The Corsair  shivers slightly, remebering childhood in Uganda in the 1970s, then continues:  "The disappearance of Rybkin, 57, a fierce critic of  President Vladimir Putin  on the night of February 5 injected drama into the run-up to a March 14 election in which Putin is widely expected to win easily, securing a second Kremlin term.   "While Rybkin, backed by exiled entrepreneur and Putin foe  Boris Berezovsky , has launched bitter attacks on the Kremlin chief particularly for his Chechnya policy, his ratings are very poor. Like other candidates he stands no chance of unseating the highly popular Putin."  Let's hope that there is  no foul play  involved, although factoring in that outspoken Putin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a billionaire c andidate for President,  was jailed and beaten ... that's highly implausible .    UPDATE : The candidate r urlLink esurfaced , no foul play involved. Rybkin's his staff reported Tuesday evening that he had turned up in Ukraine, and Rybkin "told the Echo of Moscow radio station, 'I haven't disappeared anywhere.'   "'I decided not to listen to the radio and TV' for a few days, Rybkin said. 'I decided to go to Kiev to visit friends.'"   "Rybkin, 57, said he was 'shocked' when he read Russian newspapers on Tuesday and saw that his absence was being given wide attention."  Okay, Russia is officially a freakshow.     Ubiquitous Joe Trippi    Joe Trippi  is trippin on media appearances this week guesting at  urlLink McLaughlin's One on One ,  urlLink Hardball  and  urlLink Topic A .  And of course, Trippi was  urlLink hired by MSNBC as a political analyst .  A good career move in DC, it seems, is running a failed Presidential campaign.

       Late Night Talk Show Wars, World War Two   Not since  urlLink Helen Kushnick ,  Jay Leno's  late balls-of-steel manager, sparked off the  urlLink Late Night Talk Show Wars  has there been this much belicose sentiment in the television ethers.  This time,  Stuttering John Melendez   appears to be the causus belli.  urlLink E! Television late night talker Howard Stern  weighed in on the noteworthy stutterer's defection to  The Tonight Show  this morning., saying of the Doritos munching comedian, "he can never be me."  Other chestnuts were bandied about, like:  "I told (Leno) what an ass he is ... you're just an ass ... a dummy."  "Everyone in the industry is going to laugh at (Jay)"  "(Leno is) just desperate ... you're not edgy."  "(Leno) wants to be me and he doesn't want to be me -- he wants to be the good guy."   urlLink Marksfriggin.com  does an excellent job of summing up the hostility and the tone:  "Howard said Leno asked him if he's mad that he's taking John. Howard said he asked Jay how much more material he's going to steal from his show. He said that Jay acted like he didn't know what he was talking about. Howard said he told Leno that he stole the idea of sending out some wacky guy to ask questions on a red carpet to celebrities. Jay told him that  Steve Allen  used to do that stuff. Howard said he asked Jay about  the homeless game  and how he stole that idea as well but Leno said that Steve Allen did that as well. Howard said that Jay just couldn't admit that he's stealing this stuff from him.   " ... Howard said he told Leno that he can't get  18-25 year old men  to watch his show and what he's trying to do is get John, from his show, to get that audience. Howard said he told Leno that his show is lame ... and he can't develop his own people. Howard said that Leno also said he heard how John wasn't getting paid that well on the show. Howard said he told Jay that he was going to give Jay a list of what he pays people on his show so he can take care of all of them as well. He said he also found out that the previous announcer,  urlLink Edd Hall , used to be Letterman's production guy which was kind of weird.   "Howard said this move (hiring John) was as weird as  urlLink Jay hiding in a closet and spied on some NBC executives . Howard said Jay asked him if they're still going to be friends. Howard said they were never friends so, no, they're not going to be friends. He said he told him that he's the ... lamest guy on the planet. He said he doesn't care what he does but he looks like a stupid ass. He also said that John gets these jobs where he doesn't have to do anything and he's the luckiest guy around.   "Howard said that Jay has stolen like 20 elements from his show but won't admit it. He said that the head writer from the show might as well have a funnel from the show to his ass. Gary (Dell'abate) came in and said that he heard that Howard and Jay had worked things out and were going to ride the wave of publicity. Howard said that Jay called him again and asked him if he wanted to do his show to talk about this stuff. Howard said he's going to talk about it on his own show and not do Leno's show.   "Howard said that John could have come to him before taking that job to try and get more money. John came in a short time later to talk about it. Howard said that John's whole attitude has changed since this happened. He said he went to Atlantic City with John and John was mouthing off to the dealers down there. John didn't know what he was talking about."  Check out Marksfriggin.com for an excellent wrap up of the whole brutal rant of Stern's decomposing show  urlLink here .  And as if this weren't inflamatory enough,  urlLink ABC Late Night talker Jimmy Kimmell  got into the mix, sending Stern a brutal letter(email?), saying, in part,"(Leno) plays dumb and nice but this guy is a fucking snake!"  Stern also mentioned that  urlLink CBS Late Nighter   David Letterman  contacted him and had some words, but that wasn't going to be discussed on air.  Methinks The Second Late Night Talk Show Wars begun have ..

       I'm Ralph Nader, Bitch!   Like  David Chapelle's  exquisitely rendered  urlLink Rick James  skit,  Ralph Nader  just doesn't seem to give a damn what other people think of his loppy antics.    The Corsair  worries in the dead of night that all those young college students --  idealists , really -- who have not been broken down by a life of sleazy compromise and corporate whoredon, like me, your humble blogger, will flock to a Nader run. All those disgruntled  Dean  and  Kucinich  voters will probably give Ralphie a hearing, thus, in the process, siphoning votes away from the eventual nominee, you know,  the one guy who actually stands a chance of beating Bush.  ( ed note :  The Corsair  still hopes  John Edwards  is the eventual nominee)  I'll always have love for Nader, I suppose, for his admirable past contributions to the protection of the weak over the years -- his auto safety reform, his lobbying reform, his useful citizens groups, and history will surely have a warm, if small, place for him, but I do not understand this quixotic run. Nader will not win; he cannot. He will be lucky if he pulls more than 4 percent. The folks at  urlLink Ralphdontrun.net  make a powerful argument.   Nader has been such an effective critic of the pursuit of power for the sake of ego, but lately,  well , ever since 2000, when he actually made a political difference on a national scale, his eyes have betrayed a certain ...  urlLink inamorata  ... with his newfound "player" status. The greater good is becoming less important as the stubborness of old age crystalizes all those persnickety personality faults acquired over a lifetime fighting in the political wilderness.  Something  faint  but  sinister  is emerging, in the manner of  urlLink second act of Wagner's Parsifal ,  from deep within Nader's once blameless public-crusader persona ...  a smile erupts abruptly when there shouldn't be one , when the subject of influencing the final vote count comes up. I don't know. I believe a great man has fallen prey to the  urlLink pursuit after the Wagnerian Ring of Power . Very sad; very  urlLink Gollumesque , chasing after "his preciousss!". Even saints can be sinners, it seems.  Of this point I am certain: if Nader got a little nookie once in a while, the Democrats wouldn't be in this bind.

       Maximum Exposure    urlLink The Smokinggun.com  leaves  The Corsair  a more than a little nervous about technology and privacy issues as they detail the shenanigans of one  Mark Huffman , owner of the ironically named tanning club,  urlLink Maximum Exposure . The folks at  Smokinggun  write of the tomfoolery,"Huffman ... was nabbed earlier this week when a male customer noticed what appeared to be a camera hidden in a wall fan, according to the below Reading Police Department report. When cops arrived, they found evidence of Huffman's clandestine taping operation as well as pot plants and kiddie porn."   Fuck.  Well, I'm glad I have a  natural  tan right about now.   urlLink Cincinnaichannel.com  reports:  "In what some might call a fitting irony, it was another piece of high-tech gadgetry that eventually got Huffman busted, (WLWT Eyewitness News 5's Brian) Hamrick reported. A patron saw what he thought was a camera in a vent, and using his own cell phone -- a source of its own controversy recently -- snapped a picture of the camera and took it to police.  Irony and technology, deep in Reading, Ohio --  Jerry Springer  country, by the way. I just thought this was an interesting story, gentle reader. I don't have anything to say on it either way.

       Kristin Davis to Keep Charlotte Pieces   Proving that today is indeed a  very  slow newsday,  urlLink Yahoo notes  that  Kristin Davis , who plays  Charlotte  on  urlLink SATC  will be keeping much of her wardrobe after the season ends.  "'I have a lot of quintessential 'Charlotte pieces,' Davis told AP Radio recently. 'I have a lot of her vintage clothes. I have a lot of her shoes, except for the ones that I'm really, really sick of because they hurt.'"   And in further late breaking news, I have decided to have the national drink of Peru,  urlLink Pisco , with my dinner tonight.   Anyhoo :  urlLink Bunsen  gives us the last screen shot -- spoiler alert! -- and  Matt Haber , from  urlLink Lowculture , sums up  urlLink the meaning of Sex and the City .

       My Pal Susan Shapiro   Last night as per my usual Friday night rituals ( excepting , of course, the  urlLink Azazel Goat ) I went to the local bar for some jesus juice, hit on the ladies, came up dry, and, ultimately, got home  zozzled  (great word,  zozzled , it was coined by  urlLink Edmund Wilson , the daddy cool of American literary curmudgeons in his book  urlLink The Sixties ; Edmund liked Ginger snaps, liverworst sandwiches and  gin , not necessarily in that order, mind you) That damned  Cutty Sark  had gotten the best of me. For some reason I assumed that a little light reading would solve the problem of my perilous equilibrium. So I picked up my old pal  urlLink Susan Shapiro's  book  Five Men Who Broke My Heart  and  urlLink started reading . It's  fantastic , brutally honest, funny, just beautiful. And I'm not just saying that becuase she is one of my favorite people in the world. I barely slept because I was so into what Susan was saying.  Susan will be on  urlLink The Today Show  on Wednesday, and  urlLink reading  at  urlLink KGB Bar  on Tuesday night. I'll be the one drinking  Cutty Sarks  and laughing at Sue's jokes.   Miramax  has got to option this story and get  Helen Hunt  to play Sue.

       Eminem's Mom Mugged ... On Eight Mile Road!   Navigating  urlLink Eminem's sordid past  is like  urlLink perambulating  through one of  Steven King's  creepy-ass  urlLink Maine towns . At midnight. In Winter. On foot. It's a  urlLink looonng Eight Miles .  Only,  Eminem's Detroit  is  tougher  -- have you ever tried to fight for your ass -- literally -- with a crazy eyed tweaker round Motor City way?  No ? Oh well, I guess then it was  just me .   Anyhoo :  Bob Hartlein  of that significant cultural artifact  urlLink the Star  weaves a winding tale of la vida loca that surrounds  Em :  "Five years into his estrangement with his mother  Debbie Mathers , Eminem remains so resentful of her that his only response to her recent carjacking was to call her a 'bitch,' a family member tells Star.  "Late on the night of Thursday, Jan. 22, Mathers, 49, was visiting a gas station on Detroit's dangerous Eight Mile Road when she was carjacked at gunpoint. (A 16-year-old Detroit boy was apprehended and charged shortly after the incident.) Her purse -- which was in the car and has yet to be recovered -- contained 'a manuscript of a book she was writing about Marshall and baby pictures of him,' says the source."  One would expect some comfort from your son if this were to happen to you,  right ? Not in the Mather household. Love is for pussies:  "This ordeal was yet another stroke of bad luck for Debbie, following her diagnosis with breast cancer a few years ago, says the source. And although she avoided injury during the crime, the source says that Debbie was subjected to a fusillade of angry words from her son.  "'Look b****, of all the places for this to go down,  Eight Mile Road , where my movie [2002's 8 Mile] was filmed!' Eminem allegedly yelled over the phone after learning of his mother's latest misfortune, the source says. 'Couldn't you pick another place for it to happen?'"  Damn ...  urlLink it's a hard knock life .  Where's the love , Marshall? (shakes his head dejected at the lack of compassion in this godless Post September 11 world, whispers)  Where's the love?  Just because she didn't throw down for your baby pictures, cornbread, that doesn't make your moms a  punk .  She has cancer!  But wait, there's more:  "For years, war has been raging between the 31- year-old hip-hop mogul and his mother. In 1999, Debbie filed an $11-million slander lawsuit over some disturbing and potentially defamatory lyrics (he fantasized about killing her and called her a pillpopper) on his debut album, The Slim Shady LP.  "In response, Eminem cut Debbie off both financially and emotionally, the source says.  "To make matters worse, Debbie recently lost her Michigan home to foreclosure, and has since been living with a friend in a bad area of Detroit, according to the family member. Now, this vicious reaction from her son is almost too much for Debbie to bear, says the family member."   The Corsair  munches on salt-free popcorn,  whistles  to no one in particular about all of this trailer park shit, and, appalled,  continues reading :  "Eminem may not have much time left to mend fences. According to Debbie's brother  Todd Nelson , she isn't getting treated for breast cancer, which she has been secretly fighting for two or three years. 'It only became known to family members in the last six months,' Nelson tells Star. Another family member thinks the disease is causing Debbie to waste away to what seems like a skeletal figure. 'Debbie isn't receiving any treatment for her cancer, partly because she can't afford it, and partly because she's in denial,' says the source. 'At this point, she doesn't care about her health: She continues to smoke, and most of the time, she's too weak from grieving over the eldest son she's lost to get out of bed. But maybe if Marshall showed her some love and compassion, she'd have a reason to live.'  "The source adds that friends and family are stunned at Eminem's alleged insensitivity and indifference toward his mom: 'None of this seems to be a wake-up call to Marshall to extend an olive branch. He just doesn't seem to have it in his heart to forgive her for whatever past mistakes she made, and help her out -- especially now, when she needs him the most.'"  It's like a car accident that you can't help but watch even though you know it's wrong.  Surely  this has something to do with the decline of American democracy ("and don't call me  Shirley "), but I am too tired to give it the old Jerry Springer's Final Thought. Thank God it's Friday (*sips Cutty Sark*). For everyone out there who thinks  your  family is dysfunctional ...

       The Book of Pam    urlLink Lloyd Grove  weighs in on the strange rise of Christianity in the lives of silicon-enhanced celebrities. Yesterday,  Britney  was enduring "the passion," now, apparently,  Jesus  works his magic on  Pam Anderson .  urlLink Hep C ? No, true believers ...  urlLink JC .  Shmears :  "THE PASSION OF THE SEXPOT: I suppose it was inevitable that even  Pamela Anderson  would get religion. The buxom former 'Baywatch' babe and hardcore-video star sermonizes in  urlLink Jane magazine :   "'I now love going to church. It's nondenominational, but they preach from the Gospel with sincerity. I've been reading the Old Testament lately. But the Book of John is also a good place to start. I've never felt anything but love from the people at the church I belong to. It doesn't matter to them that I'm on TV. Who cares?'"   Jesus gets all the hotties . It must be that cultivated trustafarian hippie look he's got going on. It practically shouts:  my daddy's rich!   Anyhoo :  urlLink Rush and Molloy , our favorite crime fighting-gossip reporting couple (when will  Miramax  option  their  story?), does an exhaustive survey of celebrity religion that is a must read, among them:  "Wesley Snipes says, 'I never fail to pray before a meal.'  "For all her 'dirrrtyness,'  Christina Aguilera  says, 'Right before I get onstage, I gather my band and dancers in my dressing room. We hold hands and my bass player leads us in prayer, or sometimes I'll lead the prayer.'  "Reliably kooky  Courtney Love  thanks the Church of Scientology on her new CD, 'America's Sweetheart,' but says she also attends a Baptist church in South Central Los Angeles every other Sunday. 'When they say,  Father , I just replace that with  Mother , ' she says."  Yes, indeed, Court certainly is a  urlLink mother .     Also in Grove is the extremely odd note that eminent Shakespearean scholar  Harold Bloom  pulled a  urlLink Falstaff  on feminist  urlLink Naomi Wolfe  when he "placed his hand between her legs."  The article will apparently be on sexual misconduct at Yale for  urlLink New York Magazine .  urlLink Beatrice  (via  urlLink Old Hag ) notes that  Camille Paglia  -- a Bloom padawan -- has inserted herself into the mix.   Stay tuned .

       Whatever happened to Slim Goodbody?   True, he was slim.  Very  slim. Okay,  urlLink John Burstein  was the classic  urlLink ectomorph geek . But we were  urlLink wild and innocent  youth at the time. What were we to know about cool? But even as a kid, I did pick up a certain ... nervousness. Now, maybe that had to do with a really fast metabolism on his part. Or, maybe it's just the plain fact that dressing up in his mom's panty hose with your innards haphazardly pained on them  isn't  the best way to make a living. And add on to that the fact that he did this in front of kids. In the name of (makes broad ironical quotation marks with his fingers) " health education ."  Said ectomorph with an afro would actually sing these horrible --  horrible  -- rockabilly ditties and dance this really spastic jazzercize numbers, chicken legs flapping in the wind, all in full view of kids. How lame is that?   When I was a kid at the  urlLink UN School  it was considered lame to watch Slim Goodbody. Nowadays similar social leprosy could be gained from admitting to the consumption of  urlLink Benson and Hedges cigarettes , or purchasing a  urlLink Kenny G album .   For whatever unfathomable reason of the childhood cruelty of my generation, the Yemeni Ambassador's kid at the UN School was considered  a geek . Kids are old school like that. Now, in his early 30s, that kid is right about now a mid level official in the tyranny there, taking out all his childhood aggressions on innocent civilians.  Shit happens : I can't be held accountable.   Anyhoo : Even that kid -- let's call him  the monkeyboy  -- he thought  Slim Goodbody  was lame.  That  guy. And you know your up shits creek without a paddle if your shtick cannot appeal to the undiscriminating tastes of the Yemeni Ambassor's kid.

       TV Notes    urlLink Matthew Starr  pretended to be an earthling, but he was really the Crown Prince of the Planet  Quadris . His father was overthrown by tyrants, so he was sent here to develop his telekenetic powers then go back to throw down some furious anger at his oppressors. His mentor is  Louis Grossett Junior , who also pretends to be his science teacher.   As opposed to, say,  urlLink Bennu of the Golden Light , who is a messenger from an alien world, a scout. Bennu is looking for his lost companion,  Mira . He aids people in distress with his freaky magical amulet.  You better recognize .   urlLink Alan Fawcett  was the host of a show which scored pantomimers on originality, appearance and lip synch.    urlLink Quincy's  understanding of forensic medicine was way ahead of it's time for prime time tv. He,  Quincy , of the LA Coroner's office. He lived on a boat, was a 70s swinger, and played detective to find evidence to support his theories of unexplained deaths. This did not endear  urlLink Jack Klugman  to the  urlLink po-po .   urlLink Greg Evigan  played the independent trucker  BJ McCay . He was a medevac pilot in the Nam and, somehow, managed to smuggle a chimp named  Bear  back with him. Living in a truck has it's advantages, as he croons in the theme song, "Best of all, I don't pay  property tax ."  Sheriff Lobo  was always on his ass for something or other. Quite possibly this was tax related.   Robert Gulliame  -- who insists that he is not  Haitian/caribeat , played an upwardly mobile household executive-budget director-Lt. Governor,  urlLink Benson DuBois . (*snickers*  DuBois?)  His plight  mirrored  the rise of African Americans throughout the 70s, more accurately than  Good Times  (the low estimate) or  The Jeffersons  (an inflated estimate of the African American plight). He bantered with the Wagnerian housekeeper  urlLink Gretchen Krauss , played so ably, ironically by the Nebraska-born  Inga Swenson .  urlLink That freaky kid Missy Gold  with the big eyes and the adult dialogue kind of wierded me out. She harshed on my  urlLink "I'd Like To Buy The World A Coke"  70s vibe.  So,  now you know .

       Bowing to the Guy who Plays Jesus    urlLink Drudge  reports via  urlLink The NY Daily News' Tracy Connor  that  The Passion of Christ  actor  James Caviezel  has  actually had people bow down before him on the street . The Corsair has only had that happen after a  particularly aerobic  performance in the bedroom --  kidding . Well, not really. But the Daily News says:  " James Caviezel , who plays Christ, said he got an equally eerie sign six months before he auditioned when a stranger came up to him and said, 'You'll be playing Jesus.'  "Caviezel noted his initials are J.C. and was 33 - the same age as Jesus when he was killed. He said he's had fans bow down before him, and shrugged off the hardships of playing the physically demanding part.  "'We're not called to the easy life,' he said. 'You either carry your cross, or you're crushed under the weight of it.' But Caviezel did not sound so Christ-like when he described how he looked after he was struck by lightning as he hung on the cross. 'I looked like I went to see  Don King's  hair stylist,' he said."   We're not called to an easy life ? What the  fuck  is up with that, buddy boy? Have you noticed that people surrounding this holier-than-thou project are starting to sound vaguely first century  urlLink desert father  what with those goddam platitudes? Not to lump  all  Christians into this generalization on my part (and what is blog logic if not flawed but said with zest?): but  they  seem to have this  mighty desire  to be  morally superior  to everyone else. Cavizel,  listen to me , sweetbread:  you are an  actor  starring in a  cheesy interpretation  of the last 12 hours of a world-historical moment: you are not Jesus himself . You are not even  urlLink Billy Crudup . This is not you. Repeat after me, Jimmy:  I am not Jesus.   urlLink George Jefferson  is.

       The Justin Furor    urlLink Cyberspace is buzzing like Swayze  over  Justin Timberlake  co-hosting of the  urlLink Motown special .  Apparently , he's not black enough. He's got a stronger blaccent than me, anyway.   urlLink Here is some of the buzz  going around about it bout it:  "(It) makes Black people look SIMPLE to request that he NOT host because he didn't stand behind the Super Bowl fiasco. The reasons he shouldn't be hosting Motown-anything are way more important than that shit." --  Newlywed   "Timberlake was their second choice after not being able to put together a reunion of Rare Earth." --  Anon   "so would you have a problem with a black person who was heavily influenced by a white artist hosting a white awards show?" --  shyshy   "This is a cultural insult? Okay, so where were they when Snoop was walking around with with women in dog chains to the MTV Awards? Where are they when Snoop parades a pimp around with him all over the place?  " urlLink The Boondocks  comic strip has hit the nail on the head this week, with the way we act." --  Anonymous   "The decision for Justin to co-host this special was made prior to his notorious event with Ms. Jackson. I didn't agree with the decision for him to host the show when it was first announced and now that he sold Janet out, he should be removed and his 'ghetto-pass' should be permanently revoked!   "Seriously, he was a bad choice from the beginning. I know the TV execs want to meet a certain demographic for the show, but at what expense? The producers of this show need to reconsider their initial choices and go with someone else. Perhaps Beyonce or even Usher but certainly not Mr. Timberlake.

       Stuttering John To Ann-Ann-Announce L-Leno   Accorrding to  urlLink this story ,  Stuttering John Melendez  of  urlLink The Howard Stern Show  will take a rr-rrr-rrun at announcing the  urlLink Jay Leno Show . "He is working with a speech coach to control his stutter, a Tonight Show spokeswoman told  The Associated Press  Wednesday." Hmmm:  urlLink how do we feel about that ?  An unofficial site of the show,  urlLink Marksfriggin , says of the matter:  "John has been part of  urlLink Howard's show  since the late 1980's so this is going to be quite a change for him. It may be a sign of things to come for others on the show since Howard has been threatening to leave radio when his current radio contract is up in less than 2 years. John may just be the first person to find a job outside of the Stern Show in anticipation of Howard possibly bailing out. "  Melendez begins announcing as early as March 29.   ""Growing up, I was always a big fan of The Tonight Show and its amazing history. Now to actually be a part of it is beyond my wildest dreams!' Melendez said in a statement.   "'I thank  Howard Stern , the most talented radio personality, for giving me my start, for without him, The Tonight Show would never even know me. I am looking forward to working with Jay Leno and the rest of  The Tonight Show  staff.'"   Stuttering John is perhaps best known for asking an embarrassing question of  Bill Clinton's  former paramour  Gennifer Flowers , so nicely recounted by  urlLink Stressfacory.com :  "It was John's amazing performance at  Gennifer Flowers's  first press conference that established him as a national figure, worthy of discussion on  urlLink The McLaughlin Group , of all places (where they referred to him as 'Mr. Melendez'). If ever there was a sanctimonious event worthy of puncturing, it was Flowers's public revelation of the sex-filled taped conversations between herself and then-presidential candidate  Bill Clinton .  "'Gennifer, did Governor Clinton use a condom?' John's booming stutter cut through the packed hall.  Flowers tried to suppress a grin, but her handlers became irate. They tried to field more dignified questions, but John was persistent: 'Will you be sleeping with any other presidential candidates? Was there ever a threesome?'"   urlLink John  will also be doing interviews for Jay, but, we imagine, they will be of a tamer, more network friendly variety.  Oh, and yes, my little pomegranates, any week where the lead off blog concerns  Stuttering John  is indeed a  slllooow  week.

       The Passion of Britney   That significant cultural artifact  urlLink The National Enquirer reports today  that  Britney Spears  is a "born again christian."  The Corsair  would like to note in the interest of snarkalistic integrity,  urlLink The Enquirer has also falsely reported  that  Farah Fawcett  and  Tom Green  were an item ( eeewwww ). So, take this with a grain of salt, or a splash of holy water, or  whatever .  While  Mel Gibson's  freaky pappy, Hutton, was saying that  urlLink the Holocaust was "exaggerated"   The Enquirer  rolls out their all-star line up of  Michael Glynn ,  Robin Mizrahi ,  Patricia Shipp  and  Ellen Goodstein  on this one, who write:  "With her dad hugging her tightly( ed note : as he would a bank book in a hurricane) and tears streaming down her cheeks, the 22-year-old pop princess walked down the aisle at the  urlLink Great Western Forum  in Inglewood, Calif., on February 1 and rededicated herself to Christ  urlLink in front of the  Faithful Central Bible Church's largely black congregation."  The Enquirer continues:  "Her surprising appearance at the service climaxed the tremendous upheaval that followed her spur-of-the-moment wedding to a childhood friend.  "'Following the worldwide press her marriage received, Britney suffered an emotional collapse,' revealed a source close to the family. 'With her father's guidance, Britney knew she had reached a spiritual low -- and that God was the only answer.  "'She realized she had to go back to the Christian church in order to get her life together.'"  In other words,  Britney's been taken to Jebus.  Now, I could say something snarky here, perhaps about a master plan to infiltrate the black people, to get at and steal their original music, or, I could contrast Britney's dad's "focus" with the Roman soldiers who led Christ to  urlLink Golgotha . But nothing I could say would be more interesting than this story -- or  pseudostory  as the case may be, so I'll let the Enquirer tell it:  "'They told Britney that they loved her very much but they couldn't stand idly by and watch her destroy her life and her career ( ed note : "gravy train")," the close source told The ENQUIRER.  "'Her family told her that she needed to get her feet back on the ground and return to traditional values( ed note : like pimping your kid out to the music industry is family values) ... and that included Christianity.'  "Britney took their sober sentiments to heart and agreed to attend the  Faithful Central Bible Church's  two-hour service on February 1 -- and stand with her father to rededicate herself to Christ. In an exclusive interview, an eyewitness to the stirring ceremony told The ENQUIRER:  "'Britney arrived with her father, who had his arm around her. She seemed very focused, and her eyes were teary.  "'Britney was weeping during most of the service, and her father comforted her by hugging her, or leaning over and  urlLink kissing her cheek .'"  Daddy's little dividend indeed.

       Blind Items   Today's  urlLink New York Post Page Six  blind items had me stymied. How illustrative of my essential shallowness that I have spent all morning trying to break the code -- to no avail. Who are they? Tell me:  "WHICH Manhattan mogul's gorgeous wife has a lesbian lover who was involved in a scuffle with security at a recent fashion show? The Sapphic smackdown happened after the mogul's wife tried to have her private playmate barred from the show, so as not to arouse her hubby's suspicion . . ."   Russell Simmons ?  Jerry Seinfeld ?  Who ?  "WHICH sexy starlet who was just caught cuckolding her boyfriend had been cheating on him for years? We're told that the wild child actress slept with two of her hunky male co-stars on movie sets a few years back."   Drew Barrymore ?  Hillary Duff ? Who?!  The very cool  urlLink Uncle Grambo may have figured it out on Whatevs .org today:  "it's gotta be  Bijou Philips , dunnit? while I have no evidence to support this, I'm betting that she got freaky deaky with Power while on the set of  James Toback's   'Black And White'  ... that whole opening scene had a definite air of authenticity."  We agree. The wild child thing sounds Bijy. Just a guess.

       Overlooked Classics   Yesterday I railed against outmoded fashion, lets be a little more positive today and speak of those forgotten classics that need not be. Why is it that we forget our heroes, like the new  Mr. Ed ,  urlLink Sherman Helmsley ? Why? Here are some classics we should never forget:   urlLink Stoned, the Afterschool Special with Scott Baio . "Super Stoned Jack," was the scariest introduction that most of us had to the world of the sweet leaf. Sensimila? Not if you have any sensibilities! The tag line for this read:  "Jack is a motivated high school student who smokes cannabis for the first time, and falls in with a fast crowd. Will he wake up and realize what he's doing with his future before it's too late?"   If I were  stoned  I would never go out in a row boat on the grey and greasy river limpopo.  Well , certainly not after seeing this little chestnut of a public service announcement made by anxious parents of latchkey kids in the Age of Studio 54. Put it on Trio so we can all laugh at the "reefer madness." Just say  yes  to that Farah Fawcett haired character Felicity. But I'm sure skeevy New York Times writer  Neill Strauss  will.    Dummy .  urlLink Gritty 70s drama  of urban social decline -- thanks,  Ed Koch !  Asshole ! Back in the Koch day, NYC was all about twitchy pimps with straightrazors and purple suits with ruffled shitrs and jewel encrusted goblets wandering the urban landscape (hey, come to think of it,  urlLink the pimpy fashion sensibility  is very ... umm...  urlLink priest -like), as well as greaser glue sniffing graffiti punks roaming the streets in search of a little of the old  ultraviolence . Koch turned NYC into a  Guns n Roses  video, with  Mr. Brownstone  creeping around Central Park in a raincoat with nothing on underneath!   Get  this  plot, though, peeps:  LeVar Burton  plays a  deaf  and  dumb  mute who is framed for the death of a prostitute (Kuta Kinte, you are a  framed  man!). But will we get  justice  for the amiable host of  urlLink Reading Rainbow ?    Anyhoo : Will a young  Paul Sorvino  get him redemption when he cannot even communicate with his morose client? Or will "Dummy" just become another urban statistic on the Koch street?  Despite the overall bleakness, this a very,  very  cool slice of social commentary.   Poldark:   This cult British tv series is quite habit forming. Incredible. Just  urlLink incredible . A period piece that is a cross between  Wuthering Heights ,  the Mayor of Casterbridge  and  Le Liaisons Dangereuse  but with a compelling soap opera character at its heart. A guilty high quality pleasure. You get sucked in to this costume drama that is one part  Danielle Steele  and one part high art.   Assorted Good Times episodes:  Come on, you know you had a crush on  Wilona  ("and you too, Wilomena" said the archetypical corrupt pol,  Alderman Davis ) when you were kid, didn't you -- the only blingy woman in the projects; or, if you were a girl,  Bookman the janitor  was your  long, cold drink of water . What, you never saw a black man doing a  John Wayne  impression,  pilgrim ? You better  act like you know . And you know in your heart Wilona saved  Janet Jackson  from falling down that elevator shaft while trying to escape her mom who beat her with a hot iron just before she became Willis' girl, then  Cleo  on Fame.("and you too, Winooski")  Remember the episode where Michael gets  crunk  off some dodgy ghetto "health tonic" (aka muscatel)  urlLink classic  ("Get  Vita Brite  and sleep tonight" ...*promptly passes out*).   Then there was the time Michael joined a gang and hid his jacket in the oven, which prompted JJ to note that the smell emanating from the kitchen was an improvement on Thelma's cooking.  Oh , what about the one where Thelma almost married this polygamist Nigerian cat.  Crazy ! What about that  pimpy  guy "Lennay," who always sold  hot  appliances from out of his coat.  Classic . So was the episode when James has hypertension. So was ...  hey  ... was this  urlLink a comedy or what ? ("and you too, Winifred")   Cinema Paradiso . The best work of art on the subject of friendship I've ever encountered.  The Corsair  lost a couple of tears in his Cutty Sark at the end of this one. Any classroom reading of urlLink  Artistotle  on Friendship should include a look at this film.   urlLink Fellini's Satyricon . A pagan work. Un-be- fucking -lievable: creativity on a galactic scale.  Nino Roti's  sonic assault of wierd music alone is worth the DVD price. The Rablasian Fellini walks us through Roman antiquity as he imagines it, crossed with highbrow science fiction sequences of an imagined future looking backwards. There can never be anyone as Felliniesque as Fellini. Fellini has this really odd little maneuver, where the actors are frequently lstanding still, ooking into the camera, which creates a very disturbing effect. Throughout the film -- the Minotaur spares Acyltus from a bludgeoning, promting cosmic laughter at the end(the absurd universe?), then the rambling journey winding through the labyrinthine whorehouse at the beginning, with those withering close ups of the freaky pagan denizens therein, then the  elaborate fake funeral at Trimalchio's dinner (eating and dying was all Trimalchio was about) -- all give off the combined effect that  the film is laughing at you, the viewer . From some distance outside of time the film is laughing at the viewer. Very, very strange effect, that. Also, the world's first  urlLink werewolf tale.    Carl Sagan's Cosmos : Okay, so in the madcap world of  urlLink astrophysics Sagan's hypotheses are probably all outmoded already . Right? So what? So is  urlLink Ptolemy's Almagest  and yet I still read it in college and gained benefit. The methods by which man came to his conclusions about the universe are worthy of contemplation; and, of course, worthy of more questions in light of our most current data. Cosmos is no exception. This series was the bomb! ( looks around sheepishly, then raises hand , " question : who is the biggest  PBS  geek in the room"?) Classics are never outmoded.     urlLink Chespirito . This show was a mystery to me: Why would a grown Latin man in need of some excercise want to go on tv dressed like a racy little bumble bee number emblazoned with a big "CH" on his paunch.  Subtitle it  and put it on Trio; I'd watch it just to clarify my childhood mystery. I'd like to crack open a cold cerveza and figure this out.  What the fuck was going on here ? Why is everyone else laughing but me? I feel like I'm in a Fellini movie, but it is in Spanish and the sets are decidedly low rent. We'd all like to know what the people on that endless laugh track find so fucking hilarious.   Fame the TV Series : Why are there not repeats on  VH1  of this show already? When you say low budget and high quality I think ..  right here's where you start paying for it ... with pain ... and sweat . The show of young, artistic people struggling for their moment to shine is about as American as it gets and less cruel than Donald Trump's Apprentice, where sharky career advancement is all about crippling the competition. Whatever happened to that sexy cello player who wouldn't give anyone the time of day,  urlLink Lori Singer . I was all about the emotional cellist yet frosty behaving  Lori Singer  back in the day.  Yummy.    Cries and Whispers  by  Ingmar Bergman . If Black Stallion is the most beautifully shot film, then this is number two. All natural lighting. Bergman uses a fade to red to seperate scenes, mimicking the inner membrane of our eyelids. About as fucking intense as art can get. And halfway through this film about communication and treachery -- where the incessant ticking of an pocketwatch reminds us of time's passage -- Bergman dissolves a reconcilliation scene between two hard hearted sisters into  urlLink Bach's Sarabande no. 5 in D minor . That's so fucking cool it hurts to just write it (*sips  Cutty Sark  to steady hisself*)   The Black Stallion:  Those fabulous Copollas! This is perhaps the most beautiful filmed movie ever. From the point of view of a boy. The Black Stallion is really the restrictive society. Very 70s. The image of the horse adrift in the Pacific Ocean, a burning ship sinking in the background, and the boy, by pure instinct, snatching the floating rope as it passed, is straight out of  urlLink Jung .   The Gore Vidal-Bill Buckley Debate-Fight  It was in the heart of the 60s: the polarized political center of the 60s. The left and the right clash violently  on national television . In the  news division  of a  respectable network .  Fuck!  A  classic . The country was divided in those days is an understatement.  Excellent . Buckley is the Grandfather of the American conservative movement; Vidal the leading leftist rhetorician (lefties don't organize hierarchical movements, it goes against type). For a moment, our two leading intellectuals of our two political polarities went at it in a bareknuckled intellectual fistfight. Not since  urlLink Burr shot Hamilton dead  has there been so much political drama in The Republic. Was there something in the water in the late 60s, or was everyone just  crezzzzy.    Woody Allen's Teleplay:  Don't Drink the Water .  One of the  urlLink most interesting  experiments on television ever.  Woody Allen  directs and writes a teleplay starring  Michael J Fox  and the kid who played  Blossom . Shaky handheld camera follows a grown  Michael J. Fox  as he slowly becomes involved with a bright but much younger woman. How the fuck did this get on American and not Parisian tv? Aren't we supposed to be puritainical? Did Woody Allen have so much juice back in the day that he could put on pedophilic Americana on network tv? Does the story sound familiar?  Actually  the story is tame, and inventive and very, very arty.   Kramer vs. Kramer.  The first dramatic and fully articulated statement of the Baby Boomers achieving adulthood.  A film of the first water. Young married couple breaks apart. They become two seperate people post sexual revolution. Wife leaves shallow workaholic husband and baby. Goes out West. Comes back revitalized. In the meantime, shallow husband defined by his work, like an Eisenhower-era man, like--probably--his father changes,  grows . Welcome to 1978, motherfucker.   Husband fights custody.  Bach  and  Vivaldi  weave in and out of this drama that takes place, it seems, embroidered into the most poignant colors of Autumn in Central Park, from skeletal oranges to deep cloody oches and emerald greens. Those colors and Bach and Vivaldi accurately reflect the heightened emotion of the drama -- the decisive break from the previous Eisenhower-era, the divorce and emancipation of the Boomers in film.  And the courtroom scene where  Meryl Streep  slowly dissolves into tears offset bya  forced composure (better than  Jane Fonda  in Klute) as Hoffman's lawyer vivisects her irresponibility -- her feminism, her 1978ness -- are among the  best goddamned  acting you ever will see. Kramer versus Kramer is as good as film gets.

       Favorite Curmudgeons    (swirls  Cutty Sark  on the rocks in glass, listens attentively to melancholy  urlLink Elgar  piece on the radio, looks out the window gravely) Has there ever been an African-American  curmudgeon ? I mean, it's not as if  taste  is a matter exclusive to white men, or even  metrosexuals  purely, although historically that helps. Well, if there are not, put me down as the  world's first African American curmudgeon  because I am definitely interested in that gig. I have a lot of opinions on all things under the sun.   And in that good old  list-y  curmudgeonly fashion of categorizing the good from the useless, allow me to proffer up my list of the best *sips Cutty Sark* of them:   urlLink Paul Fussell  is one of the funniest curmudgeons. He invented the term Class X, which refers to a  urlLink class outside the scope  of Upper, Middle, or Lower by virtue of wit, irony, learning and the fact that they pick jobs where they work for themselves. Fussell exemplifies Class X. He has said:  "I learned [to turn experience toward intellect and away from emotion through] my long immersion in Eighteenth-Century literature, where the urge is constantly outward from oneself; that is, not trying to undertake deep voyages into the self, but rather, to escape the self, look out at society, see what's going on, and then comment on it. Irony is a great help there, to protect oneself from the self-regarding emotion, which has always been an enemy of mine from the start."   urlLink Camille Paglia  is regarded as a right-wing nut, but, in fact, she voted for  Ralph Nader  in 2000, and she is very smart. I think her shotgun delivery and occasional ranting makes her look somewhat less than what she is -- one of  urlLink Harold Bloom's finest disciples . An aggressive, Nietzean aesthete. I dig her.   Kurt Anderson , the Elder Brother of the NY Media Corridor is a curmudgeon, to be sure. I interviewed with Kurt for a job at the late, great  Inside.com  --  didn't get it .  Alas; no hard feelings. At the time I had been research editor at the the now defunct  Silicon Alley Reporter , and immediately following that, had just been installed as Editor-in-Chief of a tiny consumer quarterly called,  urlLink MacDirectory . Kurt started off the interview by asking, with only the faintest trace of irony, " so  ... what's  MacDirectory ?" A smile played on his lips. Oh  snap ! I got dissed by the Elder Brother of the New York Media right out of the gate! Then again: How cool is that?   Before that, I had met Kurt briefly as the factckecker on  urlLink New York Magazine's cyber 60 issue , back in '95 of thereabouts. There I saw Kurt, the editor, at, like, 11 pm on a Thursday night as I was trying to validate all this massive data for that issue which had to be done by the end of the evening; I was pretty frazzled as, by then, I was in my mid 20s and way into the whole party all night work all day thing (I was writing music and club reviews for Sonicnet.com in the evenings, which entailed drinking tremendous amounts of booze, and partying at clubs all night long with strange and sundry women "music web journalists," while factchecking at New York in the daylight hours). Kurt made me work like a  Bonnie Fuller  minion on that one. Ah, well, whatever does not kill one ...  Nietzsche ,  and all that .   Anyhoo : Kurt has always about him the air of  high seriousness , which makes it appear as if what he's doing at the moment is the  most important thing in the world . No doubt  Steven Brill , who eventually purchased Inside, was caught on to  that . Kurts study of sociology at Harvard plays a great part in his social smartness.   Kurt is the  urlLink Platonic eidos  of media insider,with a cultivated aesthetic eye and, of course, everyone wants to work with him for precisely those reasons.  Another curmudgeon is  Gore Vidal , whose book  Burr  I read earlier this year when I first posted this blog without additions.  American History  geek that I am, I could not put that shizit down and am now reading  urlLink Lincoln .  urlLink Burr  is a beautiful look at the American Revolution with all the cynicism you can handle -- Vidal's thesis is that it was started by ambitious lawyers who saw an opportunity for social advancement. Actually, if you read Vidal's books everything -- everything -- is driven by the ambition of man. That's too cynical for me by a half, but it makes for interesting reading, the intersection of egos, as with Burr and Hamilton.   The Corsair  had a brief phone encounter with this honorable man of letters. In 1995, while an intern at  The Nation ,  Christopher Hitchens  asked me to fax a story on  Marty Peretz  of the New Republic to  Gore Vidal . Both hated Peretz, who is an ass. Gore Vidal's fax was busy do I called him up to tell him it was coming through. In the background I heard voices and music, apparently Gore Vidal was having a party at his palazzo. " Pronto !" he yelled into the phone, sounding a little sloshed. I told him what was coming, he politely turned on the fax, and that was it. My brush with Vidal.  At that moment my desire to be a writer in the manner of Vidal was strengthened one Being and Politics.  It is unfortunate that Vidal has, of late, taken to employing such  inflamatory  rhetoric during this tense period in American history (note: his assertion that  George Bush  knew of the 9-11 attacks before hand ...  say what?). The problem with Gore Vidal is that he was born rich and has lived his life where every utterance is taken as God's word, among idolizing students, attentive servants, Presidents ( Kennedy ,  Hillary ?), and socialites ( Jackie O ,  Eleanor Roosevelt , even  Joanne Woodward ). That type of power, being the center of attention, being able to issue proclamations combined with being an autodidact means that he rarely reflects -- which he all but admits often. And without reflection, his arguments suffer. He is for all intensive purposes the eccentric Southern Patriarch straight out of  William Faulkner . We should take him at his word on Art, but with a grain of salt on politics.  My third favorite curmudgeon is  Christopher Hitchens . I worked as Hitchens' intern at  The Nation  in 1995, and, over the years, he has helped me immensely. Frankly, it pisses me off when former interns or collegues attack him for his perfectly principled -- though I disagree with him -- stance on eradicating dictators through pre-emptive action. The human rights side of the get-rid-of-dictators argument is perfectly liberal.   Hitchens can drink . I remember one event -- a tradition -- in which his intern is taken out to lunch. In a restaurant off of Grammercy Park, talking of classical literature and US defense spending, we drank  prodigiously . Yes,  The Corsair  got his drink on with Hitchens and his old college buddy. We also briefly discussed the country of my descent, Uganda, which was a British colony, and it's President, a family friend,  Museveni , who, although not a "small d democrat," we all agreed was  good  for the emerging nation.   The drink bill was greater than the food bill. Afterwards, in the summer afternoon, I tried, weaving through traffic, to make my way home ("no intern has ever made it back to the office after a Hitch lunch, don't even try," said the Intern coordinator). It was  harrowing . Several times  The Corsair  nearly lost his boozy life but I made it home and fondly remember my time working with Hitchens, a truly generous man. I remember my girlfriend wondering  what the hell  happened to me to be so drunk in the afternoon: did I get fired?  Next up is  Taki Theodoropoulos  whom I met at  Elaine's  when I was in my mid 20s. I won a contest for  Top Drawer  section of the NY Press, back when the NY Press was relevant. The contest was for Man of the Year and I nominated  urlLink UN arms inspector Scott Ritter , who, alas, turned out to be an  urlLink internet child predator . God, how fucking  embarrasing !  At Elaine's Taki introduced me to  Elaine Kaufman , the owner of that media joint,  Chris Buckley , who's dad almost went to my alma mater, he told me, and the arrogant  Michael Mailer  , of whom nothing ought to be said.   Taki comes off  very  strongly in his columns as  Eurosnobby  and to the right of Pinochet, but, in real life, he is quite a character, very warm and fun loving. And, like The Corsair, he loves the ladies. And like Hitchens, he loves a drink.   Taki was terribly funny that day, making some very risque jokes about  Bill Clinton , who, at the time, was going through Monica-gate. Taki is also deeply literate, with a working knowledge of  Pindar  as well as  Aeschylus , and all manner of Ancient Greek literature, Word War II arcana, history, and choice tidbits of media gossip from the DC sector to Manhattan to the Euroroyals and international jet set over the last half century. And Taki is generous to a fault, having paid for the whole goddam party out of his own very deep Greek shipping-magnate pockets. I'm talking many many thousands kept the party boozed up and in good food and Elaine in the cut.  Poor little Greek boy , indeed.  Next up is  Dick Cavett , who I am sure you will be  glad to know  I have never met, but I wish I had. Cavett was liberal cool before liberal cool was even that -- and even now that it  isn't . He is a Master Coversationalist, able to discuss  urlLink the bicameral mind theory  as well as mediate the literary feud of Gore Vidal and Norman Mailer where  urlLink Mailer headbutted Vidal .  Pure 70s conversation: keep on truckin, Dick.  There is agreat line that Cavett is said to have made at a very pretty young African American woman who was waiting to attand a taping of his show. Cavett asked her her name. "Toi," said she; "is that your  name ," he deadpanned, cocking his eyebrow, "or your  function ?"   urlLink Fran Liebowitz  is another formidable curmudgeon. Although she once remarked in  Metropolitain Life  that black men have a propensity to Strawberry Wine (who loves ya, Fran, who-loves- you ?), she was  very  very funny in her day.    urlLink John Simon of New York Magazine  is a curmudgeon who would have to be invented if he didn't indeed already exist. Once while at  The Nation  under an unbreakable deadline where I had to verify the spelling and history of an obscure filmmaker I was in dire straights. Who ya gonna call:  John Simon ! After flattering him on an article he wrote in some Scandanavian Literary Review that I had actually read (he replied, graciously, "thank you ... thank you ... you are probably the only one who has read it."), he helped me out --  gratis .   Most writers respond to such a request by saying, "well, what do  I  get out of it." *coughs* Fox News' Roger Friedman*coughs*" But  not Simon , who rules Broadway with a nimble yet caustic pen that sports acid for ink.   And when he is not loving to hate something on Broadway in the pages of newly bought New York Magazine, he is writing --  prolifically  -- on art, culture, literature, opera, books ...  anything . And he does it well.  Excedingly  well. God bless John Simon, our forgotten gem.  Then there is  urlLink Sandra Bernhard . She is strangely sexy and sad and acidic in her wit all at the same time. I saw her sachaying once across the way on Ludlow Street several years ago before  Max Fish's  lost its social cachet. There was something so touching ... so existential ... about her.   She was  beautiful , wearing a sleek number on her body which was not unlike Olive Oyl, sardonic smirk evident, aristocratic street-toughness oozing out of every pore. God, she looked so fucking hot I was in awe.  Hollywood has not been kind to her, despite her gutsy performance in the King of New York, and neither has  Madonna , but they have, it appears, made up for all intensive purposes.  Why can't she get the jump off?

       Lola Ogunnaike on Dave Chappelle   The resident  urlLink "hot, hip young thing"  of the  urlLink New York Times ,  Lola Ogunnaike  interviews  Dave Chappele , who has taken over  Richard Pryor's  mantle as America's  urlLink heavyweight champion social commentator-comedian .  Zaniness  ensues:  "'Third World Girls Gone Wild,' another (Chappelle Show) sketch, spoofs the 'Girls Gone Wild' video series. Instead of young nubile blondes flashing their breasts for Mardi Gras beads, Mr. Chappelle's version features smiling native women dancing topless in remote African villages."   Oh dear.   "He has skewered the R&B singer  R. Kelly  and the original superfreak  Rick James , and he has imagined a 'Racial Draft' in which different ethnic groups swap prominent culturally ambiguous celebrities. The white delegation wins  Colin Powell  and  Condoleezza Rice , Jews score  Lenny Kravitz , and African Americans walk away with Tiger Woods, a self-proclaimed 'cablinasian.' 'So long, fried rice; hello, fried chicken,' Mr. Chappelle, with Woods-like golf apparel and large dentures, declares."  There's more:  "'Dave Chappelle isn't content just to play the race card,'  Elvis Mitchell  wrote in a column in The New York Times. 'He shuffles the entire deck.  "Before stretching his gangly frame out on a couch in his trailer, Mr. Chappelle said, 'I've always liked an element of danger in comedy.' He lighted what would be the first of many  urlLink Winstons . His voice barely rose above a whisper. 'I like the idea of people watching and asking,  Can he say that ?' "   (voice barely rising above a whisper) Is Lola Ogunnaike seeing anyone seriously?

       Has Annie Leibovitz Jumped the Shark?   Has  Annie Leibovitz  jumped the shark? Granted, I do not quite see what all the fuss is about the whole photography-as-an-art-form argument and why we are familiar with Liebovitz's name, but not, oh, say,  urlLink Tiepolo  or  urlLink Raphael.  But no, we get Annie who does  urlLink the Soprano's photo shoots  instead.  Nice.    Anyhoo : According to a poll by  urlLink FashionWeekDaily :  "Many VF fans find deep, pithy cultural meaning in La Leibovitz’s shrine-to-Hollywood tableaus.  'Art' was mentioned on occasion. The bad news: everyone else (i.e. the nation) is Annie’d out.  'I think if VF wants to attract old people, they should keep Leibovitz,' says one reader.  Majority rules, and they are tired of seeing  Gwyneth Paltrow and her ten best frenemies lounging like feasting Romans 4 times a year."  And the numbers of the poll are  harrowing . 17 Percent were in support Of Annie's "tableaus," while a whopping 83 Percent were in favor of change. There is no word as to whether or not the results of the poll were affected by the fact that Annie dumped  Susan Sontag   urlLink for the nanny . I guess they are "frenemies" now.

       In Defense of Gawker and Wonkette   I'm sure you are all aware of  urlLink John Lee's Blogging While Anti Black   piece in which he says, among other things, that  urlLink Gawker's Choire Sicha  and  urlLink Wonkette's Anna Marie Cox  have a race problem. He writes:  "We don't expect media-centric blogs about people of power to read like an issue of  Final Call , but we don't expect them to sound like  National Vanguard either.  Nick Denton  and his employees have decided that a person's ideas, actions and deeds don't define them, the color of their skin does. Thanks for letting us know where we belong."  Leaving aside the overheated comparison of the ultra-racist National Vanguard to Wonkette and Gawker, I'd like to bring up a couple of stories that, I think, show a snarky disdain for the sometimes overly alabaster tone of the manhattan media business. One, dated  urlLink Feb 5, 2004 :  "We just didn't want to mention it (because we're SO nice). But it is really horrifying that, directly underneath the aforementioned pictures of black people at the University of the  urlLink West Indies benefit on New York Social Diary , there's an ad for 'Hamptons Domestics' employment agency. The ad has little black Victorian silhouettes and a pineapple as its logo. Yikes. Context aside, Hamptons Domestics makes us vaguely ill anyway. (Though, East Village Domestics, hmm... maybe we could get a bunch of unemployed scenesters to use their parents' money to do our laundry.)"  Yikes, indeed. I remember clearly reading this that day a week or so ago, and being blown away at the boldness of the comment. The parties that NY Social Diary chronicles are indeed, very white and very brimming with New York power.  David Patrick Columbia , who runs the site, is a good man, who is accurately rendering a world that exists, effectively, behind the scenes. I remember thinking that it was very balsy of Choire to comment so snarkily on that reality.  Similarly,  Anna Marie Cox , Wonkette, gave me a link, excerpting a part of my Chattering Class Yearbook of the media. The link was pretty damned snarky and all about Martin Peretz and the alabaster quality of The New Republic.  urlLink It read :  "The Chattering Class Virtual Yearbook: "Martin Peretz, Civics Chair ... Does not call on African American Students ... Secretly compares every student to his star pupil, Al Gore '00"  Not the type of thing one would expect a racist National Alliance member to be plugging. As a black man and a blogger I regard Gawker and Wonkette as something quite different than that which Mr. Lee portrayed in his piece.

       The Highly Persihable Nature of Fashion in a Democracy    urlLink Acid Wash Jeans . (*buries head in hands*)  urlLink Uggs .  urlLink Mullets .  urlLink Legwarmers .  urlLink Shoulder pads . What do all of these personal adornments have in common?  Well , at one time or another they were considered hotter than  urlLink Heather Graham's  career --  lo ultimo .  And to some people these are  still  the standard of chic, several years after the fact --  that which one cannot do without . Such are the mysteries of the fashion pyramid, and Heather help us if we are on the bottom end.   Anyhoo : There is a  democratic urge  to dress up precisely like, say,  urlLink Jennifer Beals , or  whomever  (puts on Church Lady voice) when they are constructed as the media "hot property"  du jour  (shakes fist at computer screen).  urlLink Alexis de Tocqueville  would marvel at what bleating sheep we have become. Remember the character in  urlLink Can't Buy Me Love  -- incidentally, also named  Ron , but I am of no relation to  Patrick Dempsey  -- who had all the jocks dancing an  urlLink African Anteater Dance ?  Fuck  ... you know you do.   So why ,  O self righteous blogger , are you getting all preachy and right  urlLink winger  on our innocent asses? We are just reading this blog for shit and giggles, not a  urlLink Jonathan Edwards speech . Why you gotta be that way today?    Well , I was watching  I Love the 80s  (hides head in unbearable shame) for the 87th time ( And for that ,  I know , I have forever lost  1/5000th  of the high regard with which you once held my snarky self, and for which  I accept your condemnation ), and the catalogue of fashion faux pas contained therein had my  urlLink head spinning . I mean, I had a  urlLink name belt  ("Ron-Ski" in finger turned green "silver" -- at $2 a letter, thank you very much), I wore  urlLink Addidas with the fat black  laces , I had a  urlLink friendship bracelet.  I, too, have been in the  urlLink upper bounds of the bell-shaped fashion curve , and, as time snaked on, I've gotten off that fast-moving merry go round, briskly, with  nary backwards glance . Until the next bad fashion came my way.    But there it was, stopping me in my tracks, forcing me to reflect --  urlLink on VH1  -- an  entire catalogue  of Americana horror. A decade of bad fashion decisions staring me right in the face. (collapses into tears). God help me, my little pomegranates,  I couldn't muster the necessary irony to laugh at myself !  And so, my dear reader, I am looking at the  urlLink man in the mirror  -- that rat-tailed,  Alexander-the-Grape  munching,  urlLink Riunite on ice  sipping,   Bugle boy   wearing breakdancer -- and  asking him to change his ways .  So how happy was I today --  urlLink mirabile dictu  -- when  urlLink Lookonline's Marilyn Kirschner  puts us in my place in our "wrap up" of Fashion Week:  "I thought it was highly interesting that in place of  Cathy Horyn's  traditional apres - Fashion Week roundup in the  urlLink Tuesday 'Fashion' section of The New York Times , she instead focused on the retail arena. Of course, retailers do seem to be the news these days, what with the recent overly hyped opening of the 'behemoth Louis Vuitton flagship' on 5th Avenue.  "The article, ( urlLink A Store Made for Right Now: You Shop Until It's Dropped ) which perhaps even more interestingly, was given star status by being placed on page 1 of the first section (rather than being buried in the 'Style' pages). In it, Ms. Horyn talks about the new Comme des Garcons Guerilla Store that opened on Saturday in Berlin, which she observes, 'flouts conventional wisdom in almost every way.' Why, well, because it will be closing within a year, regardless of whether it makes money or not.  "Horyn spoke about the 'highly perishable nature of fashion,' the idea that 'Fashion changes radically every season, so why shouldn't the boutiques that sell the clothes?' And as she noted- on the heels of the New York Collections - 'Last week, 130 designers presented their fall 2004 collections, with more to follow over the next month in Milan and Paris. Yet by the time their clothes are manufactured, a factory in Malaysia or China will have produced cheaper versions. Stores like  H&M  and  Zara  will have them on their racks - and the consumer will be on to the next thing.'  "So true; which is why I firmly believe in finding clothes that combine style and substance, clothes that are relevant and appropriate for one's lifestyle, age, occupation, and personality. And more importantly, clothes whose designs will stand the test of time and transcend 'ins' and 'outs' and trends."   So  true: God bless you  Marilyn Kirschner . I will never wear a  urlLink Members Only Jacket  ever again -- even if  urlLink Ricky Shroeder , AKA  Rikki Stratton , says it's  urlLink copacetic .

       Goodbye Libby Callaway   As  urlLink Sex and the City  winds down like those melancholy breezes that frequent  urlLink Charlie Brown tv specials , those stylish and independent  New York women that break our hearts (and we still love them for it) will have another loss to overcome as  urlLink New York Post's  uber-cute fashion editor, rural Appalachia-born  Libby Calloway  is headed back to the Bush red states.   Here's the sad scoop according to  urlLink WWD's Greg Lindsay :  "Fashion Week is finally over, and for  Libby Callaway , even more so.  The New York Post’s  fashion editor is leaving the tents and heading home to Tennessee — by this time next month, she’ll be editing the Life section at The  urlLink Nashville Tennessean . While the paper’s fashion coverage will fall under her purview, don’t expect to see her at Bryant Park next season. 'I had an epiphany last fall,' she said. 'It was: Oh, I don’t have to be here anymore. I see myself living another life, with a backyard and a Volvo station wagon in the driveway.' The Post has not yet chosen her replacement."  But Callaway is replacing her Manolo's for  urlLink caterpillar's . Callaway, incidentally once had an incident with her  Manolo Blahnik  shoes, according to an interview with  urlLink Mediabistro :  "The cast I wore after breaking my wrist in a  Manolo Blahnik –related incident on some wet subway stairs. (It happened on my birthday last April, as I was on my way to dinner with friends — can it get better than that?) I refused to let anyone sign it, until I got an offer from fashion cartoonist  Marisa Acocella , whom I've recently become friends with (what a peach!). So, one night at the bar at  Raoul's , she drew the face of a woman with her eyebrow raised and the following: 'I've heard of killer shoes, but this is ridiculous!' I made my doctor be very careful with his saw so I could keep the cartoon intact. Hopefully it will make me a very rich woman on eBay someday. (Just kidding, Marisa!)"  Well, breaking one's wrist on Manolo's is not as bad as, say, breaking teeth in Balenciaga boots, like that sexy distant relative of  urlLink Madame de Sevigny ,  urlLink Chloe Sevigne . All fashion is pain; Libby is getting while the gettings still good. Ah, Libby, sweetheart, we never got to deliver our sexiest "your dad must be a terrorist because you are  tha bomb !"  Cutty Sark -infused lines on you.  The Corsair  wishes Libby the best of luck and a great career in newspapers.

       Look Homeward, Angel   Although WB mainstay  Angel  celebrated 100 episodes  just last week ,  urlLink the show has been cancelled . Things move faster in tv than a demon out of Hellmouth. According to  Medialifemagazine.com :  "There has been talk of special movie events next year, but nothing has been confirmed.  Angel’s  ratings are up more than 20 percent this year among adults 18-49, one of just two WB dramas to rise, but they are still relatively low. The WB evidently didn’t see many long-term prospects for the show, which was barely renewed last season."  Too bad. It was a surprise. Even the  urlLink Watch with Kristin  online gossip column wasn't aware. In a Friday column, she interviewed the show's vamp  David Boreanaz :   Kristin : One hundred episodes. Must feel good.    Boreanaz : Yes. I never imagined the show getting to 100 episodes. I only imagined getting the work done that was in front of me. When we started this journey four and a half seasons ago,  David Greenwalt  and  Joss Whedon  were like, 'One down, 99 to go,' and I was like, 'Whoa, whoa, whoa--I need to focus on this scene we're shooting on the rooftop.' And here we are. "   And there he went . Oh, the shadenfreude is thick. And so, on that elegiacal note, we leave you with a smattering of  urlLink Thomas Wolfe  -- the wolfman, if you will, that long forgotten American author of upper-middlebrow sapiness:  "As they walked townward, he tried to talk, explaining himself in babbling incoherent spurts.  “'It was like this,' he began, 'if I had known, but at that time I didn’t—of course I know it was my own fault for—   “'Oh, for God’s sake!' said Ben impatiently.  'Dry up!  I don’t want to hear about it.  I’m not your damned Guardian Angel.'   "The news was comforting.  So many people, after our fall from grace, are."   Indeed.

       NY Times' Emily Nussbaum Likes 70s TV ... and so do I    Clearly ,  urlLink Emily Nussbaum of The New York Times  likes 70s tv, revels in it, and, quite frankly, so do I, so  it's all good . But, as they said in the 70s, don't go breakin' my heart,  Emily Nussbaum , stay for a while, see this 70s thing through. The reasons for that 70s love, though, are not so much for artistic excellence, on my part at least, although in the cases of  urlLink Land of the Lost  ,  urlLink I, Claudius ,  urlLink Roots  and  urlLink Schoolhouse Rock ,  excellence is in abundance, but the real reason is more generally because people of my generation -- kindergarteners in the 70s -- viewed that culture at large with the wide eyes of wonder at 70s reality, or,  what was going on . This is not my thought but the thought of an interesting letter in the Arts and Leisure section of tommorrow's NY Times from a man whose name escapes me (I threw out my A & L subscription copy with the old coffee filter this morning,  alas ).  So, as  Emily Nussbaum  sexes us up with a wonderful exposition on  Starsky and Hutch , and how they shepharded in the gritty tv drama era of the 70s, when ethnic cops, divorced cops, slutty cops, and cops living in slums themselves took on the underbelly of our decaying urban centers. And hardboiled drama (the 70s were synonymous with urban decline, grafitii, "white slavery," Fort Apache the Bronx -- so the rise of the cop, as cultural hero, was all but telegraphed) were all the rage, here are some other (making ironical quotation marks in the air) "Big 70s Subjects" I'd like to see Ms. Emily -- my new journo sex symbol, by the way (sorry,  Lola Ogunnaike )  -- tackle, like 70s cereal box "face" and former footbal star,  Lynn Swann :  1)  urlLink Schoolhouse Rock's The Figure Eight , Infinity and the Nietzche's concept of  urlLink The Eternal Return  Question. Come on, Emily, I've been puzzling over  urlLink this concept  for the better part of twenty years. I mean:  What does that song mean ,  Emily Nussbaum . Could you break down for us the mathematics of infinity in Arts and Leisure?   "If you could make a figure eight That's a  urlLink circle that turns 'round upon itself   Place it on it's side and it's a symbol meaning ...  infinity "   What-the-fuck ? Is that some veiled reference to the  urlLink Bill Murray character in Groundhog Day?  Help me out here, Em; break me off some meaning.   2)  Of The Dramedy and It's Discontents . Why oh why, dear reader, did this particularly significant cultural artifact achieve it's  urlLink provenance  and peak in the 70s? Was its rise related in some phantom-sinister manner to the urban decay of the age? Were the execs affraid of too much drama and therefore threw in some giggles? And, as an offshoot to the dramedy, is the  troubled youth , who often was  the dram in dramedy . That was a big issue in the 70s, these troubled youths who "mouthed off" to parental authority figures. In the 60s, the kids really only wanted peace, love and understanding (okay, the Beats also wanted hot sex and South American Drugs and poetry, but they still snuck out to do it). But in the 70s a whole new breed of ruffians, like  urlLink Ralph Macchio  on quintessential 70s dramedy  urlLink Eight is Enough , and the  urlLink troubled Kristy McNichol  on the oft-forgotten, but once highly popular,  urlLink Family . These kids were testing the limits of 70s freedon --  they mouthed off to their parents to their faces ! Nowadays this noble banner is being held up by  urlLink that angry kid  on  urlLink WB's Everwood  who keeps yelling at  Treat Williams  for moving his family only so that the ungrateful ass can get a good life. And bloggers. We mouth off to authority figures too with mischief Fuck.  *averts gaze*  3)  Bad Science Fiction . Of course, in order to co-sign on this topic with me, you would have to agree -- at least in principle -- that there is, in fact, such a thing as  good  science fiction. What was it about the 70s that caused such bad science fiction? Bad fiction is bad enough, but why drag "science" into it -- and is it really science if you mention things like other "galaxies" and "alien races."   Was the rise of bad sci fi related to the demise of the folksy humanitarian impulse that spurred that 70s sense of that whole 'hey baby, what's your sign?' (again with the planetary references), Keep on Truckin' and UNICEF commercial era?  Had we grown tired of the planet in the wake of the OPEC scandal and yearn for off-world travel?  Had Carter fucked the whole shit up that bad ? Or am I being too idealistic in my tele-metaphysical speculation: Was it merely tv execs trying to  get up into that Star Wars bitch?    Whatever the case , we were inundated with some interesting at the time (but, in retrospect  bad ) sci-fi, among which,  stinking up the DVD storage area  at Amazon's warehouses are  urlLink Space 1999  and  Battlestar Galactica .   4) Commercials with a Social Message. Hey, w hat's up with that, Emily ?  Emily Nussbaum , explain why so many commercials in the  Age of Aquarius  had such a strong social message and sense of universal brotherhood (like  Lowenbrau's  "Here's to Good Friends") and, frankly, just love sweet love ( Love, American Style )? Two examples of this species come to mind almost immediately: one, the Coke  urlLink "I'd Like To Teach the World to Sing in perfect Harmony ,"  urlLink  and the "Keep America Beautiful" ad campaign  where  urlLink Native American Iron Eyes Cody  cried at the lack of environmental awareness of the 70s.    So, Emily, you've now got a full plate on explaing 70s tv and the big questions. Keep on truckin'

       Will Amanpour Get Her Iranian Visa?    urlLink As Haiti spirals into , quite possibly, a massacre in our Western Hemisphere, as Carribean -born Secretary of State issues strongly worded memorandum, native Iranian uberjournalist  Christianne Amanpour  is being  urlLink denied a visa to cover Iran.  While While action or inaction in Haiti will probably be the legacy of the  Colin Powell Doctrine , just as Kosovo and Rwanda were for Clinton, Amanpour is effectively frozen out of any action.   urlLink Aidainternational  writes:  "'Refusing a visa to a foreign journalist is nothing unusual for Iran, but this incident is obviously part of the present tension in US-Iran relations,' said Reporters Without Borders secretary-general Robert Ménard.   "Calling on Iran to grant the visa, he noted that the head of the official news agency IRNA was summoned by legal officials on 30 September after he had put out a report of a public opinion poll showing 74.7 % Iranians wanted talks with the US to resume. The 22 September report appeared the day after the Guide of the Islamic Revolution,  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , had made an especially harsh attack on the United States.  "Iranian officials gave no reason for refusing Amanpour's visa application. During her last visit to the country, she did a report on Iranian young people which seems to have displeased the regime, which is in the habit of blocking the return of journalists who have done reports considered critical. CNN is seen by Iranians via satellite."   The Corsair  would like to give a few reasons Amanpour's Visa was denied:  -Amanpour is one of Iran's most successful native citizens. Ali Khamenei's tyranny is anti-success.  -Amanpour, in almost twenty years of reporting, has not been kiled in reporting. This is displeasing to the tyranny.  -The tyrant in Iran found her Somalia reporting for CNN too "one sided" in it's account of the warlords against the US.  -It is common knowledge that  urlLink if you see Amanpour doing a report on a country  on CNN International or  60 Minutes , chances are you are not  urlLink one of the G-8 Summit of nations .  -They felt she gave Milosevic a raw deal.  -The  urlLink "Supreme Guide" Ali Khameni  fears that Amanpour will question his nonexistent qualifications in the travel industry.  -Amanpour serves as a strong role model to Iranian women, which scares the geeky and illiterate tyranny.

       The Passion of The Bill Murray   Okay people, the horizon is now in view, and everything, even the swift moving  urlLink Gainsborough  clouds, are irradiated by a  haunting  reddish-bronze sunset. The quest is almost over, fellow pilgrims. Our ship has broken it's last wine-dark swell before the docking, and we are nearly  hugging the shore .  The Oscars are upon us , people. And now, more than ever, we must motivate to make sure that  urlLink Bill Murray wins Best Actor .  Good to see that he made the cover of the  urlLink New yotk Times Magazine this week .   So, what about  Bill ? What about his oft-spoken of "nuanced irony"? Will it be enought to overcome  Sean Penn's  over the top  urlLink superemotional performance ? Will  urlLink emo  beat nuance?  Will someone just give the Oscar to  Bill Murray  already? Just give-it-to-him: hand that baby over to Billy. Now --  shnell , not yesterday. His performance in  Sophia Copolla's    Lost In Translation  was one of subtraction, not addition -- continuous over the top gambits, or  screaming , or even  crying like a pussy  every frame of the film.  Imagine a Best Oscar going to an underplayed performance, a bittersweetly comic performance, the gentle man going through the inevitable motions of decline. Bill here is playing a style of self, a mode of being. And Bill Murray -- for lack of Oscar nominations -- is an actor in decline yet at his peak, adding irony on to sublety. How better to reward irony than with irony? Give the subtly-nuanced rendering of decline a thumbs up, Hollywood. Give Bill Murray an Oscar for portraying "Bill Murray."   Denzel Washington's  dirty cop in  Training Day  was the most powerful and full-on, cut all the stops, performance in recent years. Septemeber 11th, to a degree, fueled our need for that kind of catharsis: a big evil wolfish lead villain devoured by his own excess. Denzel's evil cop was a big fat  Osama Bin Laden  effigy. In contradistinction to that performance (pats himself on the back for finding a use for "contradistinction"), wouldn't it be wonderful to have Bill Murray's muted Hollywood actor jetlagged in a foreign land win it this time around? Why? Because we, like Bill, are older; we've been languishing in the stream of time  just a little bit longer  than we were when we saw the world in terms of black and white. Now we want to examine the varieties of gray.   Murray has been snubbed by Oscar before ( The Corsair  shakes his head balefully at man's base nature). The fact that Murray has  never  been nominated is a crime. Murray was straightforward and emotionally rich in  Rushmore . He created a multi-layered, if conflicted and earnest personality in  The Razor's Edge . And Murray was overlooked as the subtle (there's that word again) but funny cuckolded psychiatrist in  The Mighty Tennenbaum's . Murray is all about rendering different shades of beige. Some people believe acting is screaming and crying, Murray is not of that school. Besides, doing that kind of shit  urlLink will drive you mad .   My favorite Bill Murray flic is  Meatballs , which is also the first film I ever saw, so take my suggestion with a grain of salt ("spazz ... spazz ...  urlLink spazz "). There will never be a time quite like the 70s, in Canada, no less: Canada is a nation obsessed with folksy humanitarianism, think Pierre Trudeau and their relationship to the Native Americans. And the 70s were a decade of Aquarian folksy humanitarianism. Now top that off with a summer camp, Camp Mohawk, of Meatballs.   There was an innocence (notwithstanding Murray's very un-PC manhandling of fellow counselor  urlLink Roxanne , played a bit on the butch side, by the unforgettable  urlLink Kate Lynch ).  And for the kids who don't get the ad-libbed sex jokes(I was, like 5yrs old at the time, and devoid of irony or snark or smarm, all of which flooded forth, with  torrential velocity , in high school years), there is the cockles-warming relationship between Murray and the affable  Chris Makepeace's  character,  Rudy the Rabbit . That relationship would never happen today as a result of the cynicism arising from the Catholic Church and internet sex fiends and Jacko. If Bill Murray showed that much interest in a camper nowadays, he'd be washing the laundry of  Chuck Zito  and  Addabezi .   Anyhoo : To me, Bill Murray is the coolest man on the planet earth, Oscar or not. But boy will I be happy if Bill Murray wins this year. The Cutty Sark will flow in triumph. (And, of course, if he loses The Cutty Sark will flow in defeat, only this time mixed with Corsair tears). So, the reddish-bronze sunset gives way to a purple twilight, the winds spiral once again out to sea, and Bill Murray is very much our Oscar hopes with fingers tighly crossed, our breath held and precious Cutty Sark spilling in the process.

       NY Times On Mel Gibson and Bach   Twice today in the  urlLink Arts and Ideas section  (the highbrow section), the New York Times cooly took  Mel Gibson  to task, horsewhipping him publicly (excuse the allusion) comparing his film, "The Passion of the Christ" unfavorably to  Bach's St. Matthew's Passion . Like, duh, guys: how many people could come off looking good compared to one of the seminal works of Western Civilization?    Anyhoo :  Edward Rothstein  writes in his Connections column:  "... Perhaps the  Gibson/Bach  comparison is most revealing for its contrasts. Mr. Gibson's film, 'The Passion of the Christ,' which early attendance figures suggest may become a worldwide success, reinvents the Passion in a late medieval mode, exhibiting a lusty fascination with flagellation, a fetishist's attentiveness to whips and welts, a panting anger at grotesquely caricatured villains. 'By his wounds, we are healed,' reads the prophet's epigraph for Mr. Gibson's film, and bleeding wounds are primarily what are seen throughout.  "After seeing Mr. Gibson's 'Passion,' in fact, and suffering through two hours of scourged flesh and pent-up fury, I listened to Bach's 'St. Matthew Passion' with amazement, awe and relief. Next Friday night one of the best contemporary interpreters of Bach's 'St. Matthew Passion,'  urlLink Philippe Herreweghe , will lead a performance at Alice Tully Hall; it should probably be prescribed as a remedy for every viewer of the film."   Ouch , that is, though, a wonderfully bitchy remark, macking Gibson look like the violence-obsessed ass that he is (in striking contrast to the philosophy of Christ). And just below Rothstein,  urlLink Mary Gordon , recent author of a scholarly tome  Joan of Arc , places the final nail, as it were, into Gibson, nailing him, once again, on the lack of, uhm,  intelligence  in his film:  "A great deal of screen time is taken up with the flagellation of Jesus. What does this accomplish in an understanding of the meaning of Jesus/ life and death? How is Jesus different from any other person of torture? How is 'The Passion of the Christ' different, then, from 'The Silence of the Lambs'? Jesus as a person with mind and spirit is not very present in this film. This may be partly because  Jim Cavizel , who plays Jesus, is not an actor of great psychological sublety. In the scenes when he is ministering rather than being bloodied, he is merely bland."  Gordon too references St. Matthews passion, which brings us too the question, who drank more from the great fountain of  urlLink Jesus Juice ? Bach or Gibson? Qui es mas macho?  On  Inspiration :  "The Holy Ghost was working through me on this film, and I was just direction traffic. "  urlLink Gibson   "Bach wrote the St. Matthew Passion while in Leipzig. (The Passion is the story of the crucifixion.) He borrowed words and sometimes melodies from others to write this work. The text of this Passion is taken from St. Matthew's Gospel, chapter 26-27. Bach never wrote an opera but this work like other passions of his are very close to opera with the whole story told in song. All lines were sung. Bach remain in Leipzig twenty-seven years until his death."   urlLink Lessonspage biography   Winner:  The Gibsonator   On  Box Office :  "Bach died in 1750 and was essentially forgotten. No monument or tombstone was put at his grave."   urlLink Lessonspage biography   "In a marketplace filled with mostly uninteresting titles, The Passion of the Christ comes at an opportune time taking over the media spotlight and creating almost a one-picture field. The decision to open the Jim Caviezal-starrer on Ash Wednesday was brilliant since Christian moviegoers will be in the mood for this kind of film at this time, plus it allows the pic to be topical all the way through Easter Sunday in early April leading to a solid theatrical run. Until a month ago, most of the interest remained with devout Christians, but the rising tide of controversy and media coverage has snowballed and Passion now stands as a can't-miss pop culture event film that will be seen even by those who are not very religious.  "As a subtitled film in the dead languages of Aramaic and Latin, Passion was a tough-sell since conception. With little starpower on-screen and a production that led to the most graphically violent telling of the story of Jesus' death yet, there was every reason to believe that the R-rated picture would only appeal to a certain segment of the population, and not to mainstream audiences. But behind-the-camera starpower from Gibson allowed for ten times as much press coverage as other directors would have gotten. Now, the Biblical tale has become a giant force in the multiplexes with a launch on Wednesday in a massive 3,006 theaters with a total of 4643 prints."   Gitesh Pandya ,  urlLink Boxofficeguru.com   Winner: Pow! Zam!  Gibsonroonie!   The  Critics ?  "The real test of greatness, both in content and in performance is the effect of repeated hearing--especially repeated hearing without focused concentration. After a while, both the art and the artistry of a recording like this make themselves felt in an undeniable way. Most important of all, the effect of Bach's St. Matthew Passion is to immerse the listener in the feelings and philosophies of an event that forms the foundation of western culture. If you think that's an overstatement, put this in your car cd and leave it there for a week. It's amazing what treating classics of art like drive-time distraction can do for your perspective. I found it particularly helpful to alternate a few days of the St. Matthew with a few days of the B-Minor Mass. The contrast was striking and highlighted the intensely dramatic and at the same time personal aspect of the Passion. And this performance delivers over and over again. While the initial impression of the opening bars is somewhat ponderous compared to other performances (e.g.  Harnoncourt ), the intensity and passion of the playing and singing is amazingly consistent throughout. These people really believe in this music."   urlLink Amazon.com review  of Bach: Matth?us-Passion   "My thumb was way up. I admired the film as a work of passion and obsession by Mel Gibson.  Obviously, it comes from his heart.  And I think it?s a very well-made film.   On the other hand I was shocked, as many people were, by how violent it was, and I think the message that needs to get out is, this is not a family film."   urlLink Roger Ebert     Winner: Okay, marginally?  Bach    Total : With two categories to one, Gibson is  clearly  the greater artist. Move over Monteverdi, there's a new artist in town, and he put the mad in mad max! I mean,  really , what were the cultural elite thinking? (averts gaze at the NY Times)

       Plato and the Founding of the Academy   Okay, those of you who have been with this blog since it's conception in October 2003 will know, by merely reading the title of this, that I am  psychologically compensating  for the fact that I ran  Lil Kim's ill na-na  as lead blog for  two whole days straight . I can hear your collective groans from the outer limits of the blogosphere. In my fevered ex-Catholic mind I am wondering whether or not that fact makes me a pormographer.  I know : I crave intellectual respectablity despite the fact that I am an inveterate gossip with a hankering for the naughty.  That having been confessed , my dear reader, please hear me out on this  decidedly non-snarky blog , my guilt here does not mean that the following review of  John Bremer's  book  urlLink Plato and the Founding of the Academy , by one  Noam Gedalof , from  the  urlLink St. John's College Alumni newsletter  is not  fucking fascinating .  urlLink Plato's Republic  to me has always been as darkly beautiful and mysterious as the  urlLink Ancient Greek sense of equating morality with Geometry , even going so far as to  urlLink imply in Aristotle  that a formula for virtue could be found in The Golden Mean.   Give it a shot, like you might a glass of good cognac. I think it is really interesting if not amusing, like I usually am (or try to be). Noam writes in his book review:  "  John Bremer  says he has come into the possession of a letter purporting to be from Plato himself, and addressed to his great nephew. Bremer, a former St. John's (College) tutor, describes how the letter came into his possession, presents the text in English, and in 100 pages of footnotes and other tabulations and analyses develops and clarifies the letter's contents.  "In the letter, the author elaborates a scheme of the design of  The Republic  based on a twelve hour reading period, beginning at noon and ending at midnight. The way into duration is the sylable count. The Republic may be divided into 240 three minute units -- each of roughly 750 syllables. (Bremer calls them Bremer Units) The speed is fast, but not unrealistic. Plato would have composed on wax tablets, most likely of equal size, and in this way he could keep track of both the number of syllables on each tablet themselves -- by numbering them. He could follow the time frame in which each part of the conversation played out. And he could also -- and he surely did -- compose each numbered tablet with reference to other tablets, and often with them side to side.  "What emerges when  urlLink The Republic  is viewed through this lens is an architectural marvel -- suffused with symmetries musical, astronomical, geometrical, even choreographic.  urlLink The famous Divided Line , for example, itself divided in extreme and mean ratio, comes at precisely  urlLink The Golden Section  (the point which divides in extreme and mean ratio) of the duration of the conversation. An elaborate and precise ring composition also reveals itself. Bremer has shown this with a table that places summaries of tablets 1 and 240, 2 and 239, and so on, side by side.  " urlLink The design of The Republic  for once finds concrete exposition in Bremer's work -- a truly new way to  urlLink read the ancient text ."

       Ashton Kutcher is 30!   Yeah, his bio says he's 26, but  Ashton Kutcher , who plays teenage hearthrob  Michael Kelso  on  That 70s Show , hasn't been a teenager in well over a decade, according to that significant cultural artifact  urlLink The National Enquirer . He's actually  urlLink 30 years old !  "According to a bazillion press clippings, actor  Christopher Ashton Kutcher  was born  urlLink Feb. 7, 1978, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa . But  urlLink Los Angeles County Registrar's voter registration  records show a  Christopher Ashton Kutcher  who was born in Iowa and currently residing in Beverly Hills with a birth date of Feb. 7,  1974 ."   Shit.    "Pure coincidence? A clerical error? Call us skeptical, but we think not!   "If Kutcher really IS 30, that would make his so-called  urlLink May -September romance with 41-year-old Demi more like a  urlLink July - urlLink September  romance and take some of the sizzle out of the relationship.   "Ashton's representatives insist that he was born in 1978 and when he appeared on 'The Tonight Show' back in January 2003, Kutcher himself confirmed the same thing to host  Jay Leno .   "But if that's the case, why do the L.A. voter rolls have him listed as 30? Hmmm, could it be 'The Butterfly Effect' ... or are we just being 'Punk'd'?"   The Corsair  feels for Ashton. He became famous for his youth, forst in That 70s Show, then as a boytoy. And in a town of liars, er, I mean actors, getting called on this is pretty lame. But it is just too juicy to ignore.  Sorry, biscuit.   ( Ed Note : Due to work constraints there will be no blog tommorrow. Sorry)

       The Kournikova Boytoy Tour   It looks like  Anna Kournikova  is pulling a  Colin Farrell , and going through the opposite sex faster than a meteor about to burn itself out.  urlLink The 3 AM Girls  have been up all night chronicling her conquests since breaking up with  Enrique Englesias . They write:   "The Russian tennis strumpet has finally been ditched by Spanish crooner Enrique after he heard reports of his other half's antics over the weekend.  "The final straw was the news that Anna had been seen in Las Vegas getting close to actor Mark Wahlberg in a number of nightclubs on Saturday.  "The pair then booked a suite in the Vegas Palm Hotel on Sunday night and emerged looking 'tired but happy' the next day.  "And that wasn't the only time she's strayed. Earlier last week she'd been spotted getting friendly with New York Yankees baseball star  Derek Jeter .  "'Enrique was so upset and he says it's definitely over this  urlLink time ,' a source tells us. 'He couldn't stand the thought of her with someone else.'"  "But we're hardly overflowing with sympathy for Enrique. Since he met Anna he's been linked to a string of women, so she's finally giving him a taste of his own medicine."   Note to young, beautiful, rich and famous people : fidelity is overrated.

       Page Six Blind Items   Thank god for  urlLink Page Six blind items , they keep bloggers like me busy, especially on the slow days. This is no different:  "WHICH Broadway hunk lost his chance at being the next  James Bond  because of rumors he's gay? The movie's producers found out he was a little too close to his male assistant, and were worried about the secret getting out and weakening the Bond machismo . . . WHICH former supermodel and her hubby are on the rocks? His constant philandering with sexy young women in  urlLink bars  has finally come to a head, and she is said to be shutting off the tap on their marriage . . . WHICH hard-partying 'celebrity deejay' was recently bounced from L'Ermitage hotel and the Hyatt in L.A. while frittering away his share of the family fortune on drugs and booze?"  The first one, I'll guess is  urlLink Hugh Jackman . I don't know why I say that, but it just seems right.  urlLink Gawker  agrees.  Choire Sicha  writes, " Hugh Jackman , this one's easy; he's starring as a gay playboy in 'Boy from Oz' and he's the only one hot enough right now to be considered for James Bond... no,  John Stamos  in 'Nine' doesn't count..."  The second blind item is  Cindy Crawford , The "bars" comment screams "The Pulse"  urlLink Rande Gerber , who owns bars and is a former model. Gawker agrees, "Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber?"    The last one is hard. Very hard. I'm guessing  Paul Sevigny , because, frankly, he and  Rosanna Arquette  are the only celebrity deejays I know about. But I'm pretty sure I am wrong on that. Gawker has a better guess. "How about  Cameron Douglas , Michael's 23-year-old son-- maybe he's in need of a little attention?"

       Howard Stern: Is This The End?   "This is the end, Beautiful friend  This is the end, My only friend, the end  Of our elaborate plans, the end  Of everything that stands, the end  No safety or surprise, the end  I'll never look into your eyes...again"  The Doors ,  urlLink The End   It looks like we are witnessing the slow and bloody demise of  urlLink Howard Stern's immensely successful radio show . First his sidekick Jackie "the Joke Man" Martling left the show, ostensibly to "punch up scripts" for tv and film. Then, just last week  urlLink Stuttering John Melendez . Then  urlLink the feud with   Jay Leno . And now, just yesterday,  urlLink six stations unceremoniously dropped Stern , caving in to FCC pressure as a result of  urlLink Janet Jackson's tit . Which, incidentally, are not remotely as interesting as  urlLink Monica Belucci's sumptuous breasts  (thanks for the link,  urlLink Uncle Grambo )  Again,  urlLink Marksfriggin.com  summarizes the discussions this morning:  " urlLink Howard  said he knows the story is big if he ever sees himself on the  urlLink cover of the NY Times . He told Robin that he heard from his agent last night that he was suspended from the San Diego station last night. He didn't know it was going to be all 6 of the Clear Channel stations. He said he saw himself on the front page of a paper right next to Jesus from  Mel Gibson's  movie. He said that he thinks he looks better than Jesus. He said that's all he cared about w urlLink hen he saw the Daily News . Then he saw the awful picture that the NY Post used. He said they hate him over there and use the worst picture they can find.   "Howard said he got a call from  Robert Schimmel  yesterday while all of this was going on. He said he did't even know he was under attack at the time. After talking to Bob he found out about the suspension. Howard heard that the head of Clear Channel has to testify in front of congress so that might be why all of this was going on. Since Clear Channel is in breach of contract they may not even have rights to the show anymore. He also heard that he should stop talking about this congresswoman who was getting upset about the things he was saying about her. Howard said she's not going to stop talking about him so he doesn't know why he has to stop talking about her.   "Howard said after he found out all of that he watched ''American Idol.'' He told Robin about the people who got voted in and discussed that show for a couple of minutes. Howard went on to talk about how crazy this censorship stuff is and how they're saying that it was racist comments that got him removed from these stations. He said it was a phone caller who made a racist comment though, not him.   "Howard said he really doesn't know what's going on and he's not sure why he's being taken off of these radio stations. He said he had to read the paper to get his information. He said that the papers are reporting that he was taken off because of a ''vulgar'' show he did. Howard also said they're claiming it was an ''indecent'' show he did but he doesn't understand that because he hasn't been accused of doing anything indecent.   "Robin told Howard that in  urlLink USA Today  they said that he was yanked but the syndicator stood by him. Howard said that would be Mel (Karmazin). Howard read some of the articles that were written and the comments that the Clear Channel people were saying. Howard said that he's going to be the sacrificial lamb in all of this indecency stuff. Artie said it's pretty scary that they're not allowed to talk about a politician. He said that it's frightening."  Under attack from  Jay Leno  and now the FCC. Stay tuned for how this little contretemps resolves itself.

       The Passion of The Bill Murray   Okay people, the horizon is now in view, and everything, even the  urlLink Gainsborough  clouds, are irradiated by a  haunting  reddish-bronze sunset. The quest is almost over, fellow pilgrims. Our ship has broken it's last wine-dark swell before the docking, and we are nearly  hugging the shore .  The Oscars are upon us , people. And now, more than ever, we must motivate to make sure that  urlLink Bill Murray wins Best Actor .  So, what about  Bill ? What about his oft-spoken of "nuanced irony"? Will it be enought to top Sean Penn's over the top  urlLink superemotional performance ? Will  urlLink emo  beat nuance?  Will someone just give the Oscar to  Bill Murray  already? Just give-it-to-him. Now:  shnell . His performance in  Sophia Copolla's    Lost In Translation  was one of subtraction, not addition -- continuous over the top gambits, or  screaming , or  crying like a pussy  every frame of the film.  Imagine a Best Oscar going to an underplayed performance, a bittersweetly comic performance, the gentle man going through the inevitable motions of decline. Bill here is playing a style of self, a mode of being. And Bill Murray -- for lack of Oscar nominations -- is an actor in decline yet at his peak, adding irony on to sublety. How better to reward irony than with irony? Give the subtly-nuanced rendering of decline a thumbs up, Hollywood. Give Bill Murray an Oscar for portraying "Bill Murray."   Denzel Washington's  dirty cop in  Training Day  was the most powerful and full-on, cut all the stops, performance in recent years. Septemeber 11th, to a degree, fueled our need for that kind of catharsis: a big evil wolfish lead villain devoured by his own excess. Denzel's evil cop was a big fat  Osama Bin Laden  effigy. In contradistinction to that performance (pats himself on the back for finding a use for "contradistinction"), wouldn't it be wonderful to have Bill Murray's muted Hollywood actor jetlagged in a foreign land win it this time around? Why? Because we, like Bill, are older; we've been languishing in the stream of time  just a little bit longer  than we were when we saw the world in terms of black and white. Now we want to examine the varieties of gray.   Murray has been snubbed by Oscar before ( The Corsair  shakes his head balefully at man's base nature). The fact that Murray has  never  been nominated is a crime. Murray was straightforward and emotionally rich in  Rushmore . He created a multi-layered, if conflicted and earnest personality in  The Razor's Edge . And Murray was overlooked as the subtle (there's that word again) but funny cuckolded psychiatrist in  The Mighty Tennenbaum's . Murray is all about rendering different shades of beige. Some people believe acting is screaming and crying, Murray is not of that school. Besides, doing that kind of shit  urlLink will drive you mad .   My favorite Bill Murray flic is  Meatballs , which is also the first film I ever saw, so take my suggestion with a grain of salt ("spazz ... spazz ...  urlLink spazz "). There will never be a time quite like the 70s, in Canada, no less: Canada is a nation obsessed with folksy humanitarianism, think Pierre Trudeau and their relationship to the Native Americans. And the 70s were a decade of Aquarian folksy humanitarianism. Now top that off with a summer camp, Camp Mohawk, of Meatballs.   There was an innocence (notwithstanding Murray's very un-PC manhandling of fellow counselor  urlLink Roxanne , played a bit on the butch side, by the unforgettable  urlLink Kate Lynch ).  And for the kids who don't get the ad-libbed sex jokes(I was, like 5yrs old at the time, and devoid of irony or snark or smarm, all of which flooded forth, with  torrential velocity , in high school years), there is the cockles-warming relationship between Murray and the affable  Chris Makepeace's  character,  Rudy the Rabbit . That relationship would never happen today as a result of the cynicism arising from the Catholic Church and internet sex fiends and Jacko. If Bill Murray showed that much interest in a camper nowadays, he'd be washing the laundry of  Chuck Zito  and  Addabezi .   Anyhoo : To me, Bill Murray is the coolest man on the planet earth, Oscar or not. But boy will I be happy if Bill Murray wins this year. The Cutty Sark will flow in triumph. (And, of course, if he loses The Cutty Sark will flow in defeat). So the reddish-bronze sunset gives way to purple twilight, and Bill Murray is very much our Oscar hopes.

       President Bush and Dick Cheney: A Dialogue   It's no secret that  Dick Cheney  is  urlLink not a popular man  throughout the land.  urlLink Even his daughter  may have something to say about the Administration's ban on gay marriage. In fact, many  urlLink consider him too powerful . But now that polls show  urlLink Bush trailing potential challengers   John Edwards  and  John Kerry , he may want to consider a stronger ticket. In other words, could  urlLink Dubya  ask Cheney to step down "for the good of the party"? You know, a "health related" stepping down. Is Bush powerful enough? Here's a little imagined dialogue of possibility:   Cheney : Mr. President?   Dubya : Good to see you, Dickster, hows the ticker doin'?   Cheney : Oh, fine, sir; got a clean bill of health.   Dubya : Oh, is that so (sly smile plays on his lips). Are ya sure you wouldn't want to take some time off?   Cheney : Sir?   Dubya : You know, like the  entire second term .    Cheney : (dumbfounded) Wh- aat ?   Dubya : Well, it's this war thing, Dickie, sorry to say. Nothing personal. If Kerry picks someone like  urlLink former Senator Cleland  and runs as a veteran who cares, then we are in  deep doo doo . I can't run on a  urlLink National Security platform  down south if they start rallying vets against you for being such a goddamned  urlLink chicken hawk    Cheney : But, sir, I object, I --   Dubya : No, I know you aren't a goddamned chicken hawk, Dick. Wouldn't have asked you to join the ticket if you were. But politics is about  the perception . How else do you think I  urlLink broke John McCain in South Carolina  in 2000?   Cheney : But I was Defense Secretary --    Dubya : Speaking of that. Didn't you administer pop's First Persian Gulf War?   Cheney : (puffs up) Why yes, I did indeed.   Dubya : And who was the general in the field, he had a funny name.  Polish  or somethin'   Cheney : (nervous) Shwarzkopf, er ...  urlLink Norman Shwarzkopf .   Dubya : (smiles) Stormin' Norman, I like that. See that, Dickie, we've already got a nickname for him.   Cheney : But, sir --   Dubya :  And he's from Florida , isn't he?   Cheney : Uhm, yes, sir --   Dubya : Perfect (reaches for a pretzel). Him or  urlLink Giuliani  would be just the ticket for the ticket.  Giuliani  at the New York convention would be perfect. I'd campaign in the South, and Rudy would just stay right there in the tri state area of NY, Jersey and Connecticut.   Cheney : (desperation) But, if I may speak frankly, what about Wyoming, sir. You couldn't have swept that state without  me  on the ticket.   Dubya : I guess we'll just have to manage Wyoming's whopping three electoral college votes without ya, Dickster. A vacation is a good thing. Sound mind and all that.  Wishful thinking on The Corsair's part?

       The Passion: Early Morning Box Office    Matt Drudge  has been  on top  of  urlLink Mel Gibson's Passion  like ... er, never mind (please excuse that image).    Anyhoo : today is no different for the intrepid Miami-based proto-blogger.  urlLink Drudge notes  thay in little Plano, Texas, (link via  urlLink CNN's   Thom Patterson ) as far as  The Passion  goes, it's  on like popcorn :  "Thousands of moviegoers in Plano, Texas, spent the morning of Ash Wednesday viewing  Mel Gibson's  controversial 'The Passion of the Christ,' courtesy of a local businessman.  "Three early-morning showings of the movie about the crucifixion of Jesus began at 6:30 a.m. Wednesday, after  urlLink Arch Bonnema  bought thousands of tickets for $42,000, according to a spokeswoman at his church.  "'It was his passion,' said  Pat Spackey  of the  Prestonwood Baptist Church . 'He was just so moved by the movie that he wanted everyone to be able to see it.'"  Okay, so am I the only one who was blown away by the image of people going to see  urlLink a little bit of the ole ultraviolent  at 6:30 am? Oatmeal? No. Cookie Crisps? No. Eggs with Catsup? No. The blood of our precious lord?  Priceless.    urlLink New Yorkish  cuts them down to size. And so does  Matt  at  urlLink Lowculture .

       Penny Lover   "I'm not a big fan of the handshake ... I think it's barbaric, shaking hands, you catch colds, you catch the flu, you catch this, you catch all sorts of things." If you identified  urlLink Donald Trump  as the author of this oft-repeated riff then you are dead on.  The trouble is that it doesn't mesh with a comment he made to FHM in the March issue. Check out this slice:   Trump : If I see a penny on the sidewalk, I always pick it up, because, psychologically, I want to do that."   FHM :  Seriously?    Trump : Absolutely. I do it all the time. That's the way I am.  Okay, leaving aside the fact that this naught else but complete bullshit, lets zero in on the whole  penny-hygiene thing . Donald Trump, worth, oh, approximately $2 billion by conservative estimates, bending over,  fat ass akimbo , picking up Abe Lincoln's from the gritty expectorate-laden Midtown streets. And yet he will not shake your hand?   Priceless.

       Allegra Beck    urlLink Allegra Beck .  urlLink This from the New York Times :  "At the end of this month, on her 18th birthday,  urlLink Allegra Beck  will come into control of her 50 percent of the privately held Versace firm; her mother owns 20 percent and Santo, 30 percent. The family's holdings include the fashion business, which had sales last year of $486 million, as well as a villa on Lake Como and a town house in New York. The family has sold the Miami Beach house.   "Though her name is as prominent as a Hilton, Ms. Beck isn't a typical heiress. This is in part because of what she has endured and in part because her father, Paul Beck, and her mother, who are separated, have shielded her from the news media. She attends a private school in Milan and is often present at her mother's runway shows. But, while Ms. Beck will soon be free to exert control over one of the most famous labels in fashion, she plans to enroll this fall in an American university to study drama and business."   The Corsair  would like to take this opportunity to formally extend to Allegra Beck a  full scholarship  to the  Ron Mwangaguhunga School of Drama and Business , registration guaranteed upon turning 18.  Call me ?

       Topic A: Ron Galotti and Candace Bushnell on Tina Brown's Talkfest   (new posts see below Tina blog: for  Tuesday 2/24 )   Mr. Big ,  urlLink Ron Galotti , made an  excruciating  appearance on  Tina Brown's   urlLink Topic A  last night.  Excruciating.   The former  Vogue ,  Talk  and  GQ  publisher interrupted an all girl discussion of the influence of Sex and the City for one segment.  One segment.  Then he whisked off into the night.  After  Tina Brown  made an apology to  urlLink Candace Bushnell ,  Mr. Big  returned to the center of New York media, strutting down the aisle, full into the all-girl gab session on  urlLink Sex and the City .  After a very stiff hug, Bushnell noted,  twice , that she was married to someone else (as is, of course,  urlLink  Mr. Galotti ). Panelist  Aisha Tyler ,  Laura Ingraham  and  Erica Jong  sat by as Galotti made a few comments and then disappeared. By the next segment, the girls got into a no holds barred discussion on the meaning of the  HBO  series.  One wonders how that strange tv moment came about?  The Corsair  will take a stab:  (phone rings)   Tina Brown : Hello,  Tina Brown  speaking.   Ron Galotti : Hey, Tina, it's Ron.   Tina Brown : (awkward silence) oh, ehm, hi, Ron   Ron : Long time, huh?   Tina : Uh, yeah ...   Ron : So, ya gotta show on CNBC, Topic A. Your doing all right with yourself, I see.   Tina : Well, yeah, you know.   Ron : --yeah   Tina : (after an excruciating moment) Uh, what can I do for you Ron?   Ron : We had some good times,  eh  Tina?  Tina: Yeah, good times all around.   Ron : At  Vanity Fair  and the  New Yorker    Tina : Right,  good times  (pause)   Ron : --so ...   Tina : What are you up to Ron?   Ron : Oh, this, that and the other thing,  urlLink you know the ad recession     Tina : Yeah   Ron :  Hey, I just thought of somethin'  Tina: Really?  Ron: Yeah, are ya doing anything for the finale of  Sex and the City ?  Tina: Uhm, er -- just a girl chat show, you know, Manolo's and that sort of thing.  Ron: Hey, I'd be great on that.  Tina: No, really Ron, it's a discussion with me and  Aisha Tyler , and  Candace Bushnell   and --   Ron :  Candace ?   Tina : (pause)  Uhm , look Ron   Ron : You gotta put me on, Tina. I'm the original Mr. Big.   Tina : Ron, I ...    Ron : I've always been loyal, Tina, a paisan ...   Tina : (breaking down) yes ...  Ron: Just get me on, let me talk a bit about me, make me look good.  Tina: (resigned) okay, Ron; just one segment.  Ron: Great. I always said  Mickey Rourke  was wrong in  The Pope of Greenwich Village .  urlLink Italians don't outgrow people , they outgrow clothes. And neither does Tina Brown.   Tina : --  Right . I'll talk to you later.   Ron : Don't worry, it'll have  urlLink synergy .  Tina: (unenthusiastically)  urlLink great

       David Guest's Medical Records  or,  He Denies any Amaurosis Fugax    urlLink TheSmokinggun.com  via  urlLink Gawker  gets the goods on  David Guest's  medical records, and it is a treasure trove of yum. So much so, in fact, that this gossip pirate has only scratched the surface dubloons of its booty.   We find out, for instance, that Guest, who has a "significant medical history,"  is  urlLink allergic to polyester . And his signature is, well,  urlLink demonic . He takes  urlLink oxycontin , (aka poor man's heroin) two times a day. His bowel sounds are  urlLink positive .  The guys at  TheSmokinggun.com  fill us in:  "The 2003-4 documents, just filed in connection with litigation between Gest and estranged wife  Liza Minnelli , purport to record the 50-year-old producer's fragile, pain-filled existence since Liza allegedly went  Sonny Liston  on him last June during a London holiday. Since then, Gest has been living in Hawaii, where he is presently being treated with a 'bizarre and irrational course of medications and treatments,' according to a New York doctor who reviewed Gest's records for the Minnelli camp. The records are filled with accounts of Gest's morphine drips, insomnia, lesions, elevated cholesterol levels, and other details from his stays at Honolulu's Queen's Medical Center."  As to the mechanics of the ass whipping -- alleged ass whipping -- that Liza handed out:  "The patient was struck on the forehead, temporal and parietal areas by his spouse on June 18, 2003. He states that he was assaulted by his spouse on numerous occasions over the last year; however the last occasion was especially violent."  Oh god, this is juicy. Read it all  urlLink here .  What do we learn? That doctors who cater to the rich and powerful will often enable any nutso or addictive behavior so long as said upper tax bracketer has the green to pay for it.

       Kiefer's Sweet Julia Memories    SAG Best Actor in a TV Drama   Kiefer Sutherland  tells  urlLink Ananova  that he thinks fondly of his time dating  Julia Roberts .   urlLink Ananova  writes:  "'All in all, we had two great years', the actor has told  urlLink Fuer Sie  magazine.  "'But the media hype and our lack of experience destroyed everything.'  "Speaking about his change from movie to television roles, Sutherland, 37, said he finally realised Hollywood life wasn't for him.  "'The big bosses have all the power, they bring you down, don't keep their word and treat you like dirt', he said.  "'If you live in Los Angeles, you are in their hands'."  Oh, so it's the media's faultnow, is it KiKi? Gee, and I thought it was because Kiefer was cheating on Julia Roberts with a stripper-gogo dancer named  Amanda Rice  (stipper name,  Raven ), who sold her story to the tabloids, telling them, in the process, that Kiefer regularly referred to Julia as "the ice princess."   Blame the media , Kiefer.

       The Kid Stays in the Picture, and: Friedman vs. Waxman    urlLink  Roger Friedman's Fox 411 column  relays some very strange information regarding the 13 year-old cancer stricken boy at the center of the Jacko sex abuse case. Friedman quotes  urlLink Rush Hour 2  director  Brett Ratner  as saying:  "'[The boy] would sit in my director's chair. When I told him to get up, he'd tell me to go to hell.' Ratner said, 'He used to tell me, Brett, I don't like the last shot' while he was watching us make the movie. He's telling me how to make my movie! He's more street smart than I was at that age. If someone tried to fondle him, he'd punch them in the face. He's an adult. I think the jury will see that.'"   Okay, lets bypass the fact that the kid is acting like  urlLink Orson Wells ,  and he's only 13 .  Friedman goes on:  "Ratner confirmed for me what I've heard a lot now from others: that actor/comedian  Chris Tucker  bonded with the boy when he was ill. I've told you before that it was Tucker and  Adam Sandler  who the boy wanted to meet when he was at a camp for sick children. It was through Tucker that he met Jackson."  Okay, first things first: how the  fuck  does a 13 year-old boy get is kind of juice? Were his first words out of the womb, "It's all about who you know,  baby ." Did he chill at the  urlLink Chateau Marmont  when he should have been in kindergarten?  What the fuck is up with this kid giving directing pointers to Brett Ratner? Granted we live in a media savvy age, where weekend box office results are news items on the Sunday night news, but  come on .   Anyhoo : Speaking of Friedman,  Cynthia Cotts , the media reporter for the  Village Voice ,  urlLink weighs in  on the his feud with  Sharon Waxman  of the  urlLink New York Times , and finds that Roger just wants a little respect.  R-E-S-P-E-C-T :  "The Fox scribe's latest point of contention ( ed note : with Waxman) involves a $70 million loan payment that Jackson reportedly owes, a payment that has either been made or not, depending on whose sources you trust. On January 13, Friedman reported that the payment had been made by two 'Jackson stalwarts'; a month later, on February 12, Waxman reported that the payment had not been made—and that Jackson may face bankruptcy as a result.   "Friedman says he was too 'tired and incensed' to ask Waxman about her reporting on his story about the loan payment. (Perhaps it didn't occur to him that she didn't credit him because her sources contradicted his.) Instead, he wrote to  New York Times  public editor  Daniel Okrent , expressing his shock at the alleged theft. According to one source, the letter begins, 'I can't believe she's doing this to me again!' Waxman wrote a letter defending her work, and shortly thereafter Okrent informed Friedman that no correction would be forthcoming."  Cotts casts her net far and wide to find out what journos think of Friedman, and finds,sadly, "other scribes express varying degrees of affection and pity for Friedman. One calls him 'marginal, with delusions of grandeur'; another says he wants 'to be respected.'"   Cotts concludes:  "Friedman says he has nothing against the Times reporter personally. 'I'm not her media critic; I'm not looking into her stories,' he says. 'My main complaint is that there's no citing of previous reporting in her stories ...  I invite Sharon Waxman to lunch anywhere she likes, on any coast at any time. Just please stop this doing this thing. Just give me credit.'"   And  respect , methinks. Roger just wants a little r-e-s-p-e-c-t.

       Page Six Blind Items   Blind items are fun. With a little indirect communication we can avoid the whole lawyer mess. Today's  urlLink PageSix  presents us with some of the good stuff:  "WHICH Broadway composer had a torrid affair with fake plastic surgeon  Dean Faiello , who fled to Costa Rica after he allegedly killed his patient  Maria Cruz  and buried her body under concrete in his Newark home? . . . WHICH 'happily married' model isn't so happy after all? Although she and her hubby present themselves as the perfect couple, insiders say they're talking divorce . . . WHICH porn hustler is so desperate for celebrity pals to attend Mardi Gras with him, he has offered every "star" a free ride on his jet, five-star accomodations and $4,000 in cash for play money? So far, no one will risk their reputation by being seen with him. "  Okay, the first one I have no idea about. I'm not even going to try to fake like I know anything about Broadway composers. The second one sounds like  urlLink Cindy Crawford . I'm not quite sure why her particular name sprung to mind, but the image of domesticity is one that Crawford seems to be pushing a bit ... a  bit  ...  too hard  (do we need to see her blindingly-blond child in a commercial for automobiles?). Do we need to always see her progeny by the immensely shallow pub purveyor, "The Pulse,"  urlLink Rande Gerber ? And the third sounds like  Larry Flynt , who always wants attention. And he has a " urlLink centerfold pink" jet .   Eeeeeewww.  Then again,  urlLink Gawker , who is a better guess than me, says, "The third blind item... gotta be  Joe Francis , right? I just saw him referenced on another headline as someone everyone's avoiding... And this has been months in the works. This sounds like something he'd do, and it sounds like something that should happen to him. It's about time, actually."  Yeah,  Joe Francis  sounds like someone who would pay celebrity to surround him at Mardi Gras.

      ( Janet Jackson  photos below this blog; scroll down)   A Little of the Old In and Out    In :   Bonnie Fuller . I read, with horror, the  Vanity Fair  (Unfair) profile of Bonnie, which brought up everything from a sad incident in her impoverished past with a Marshall, coworkers fouling her food, her children's pictures that adorn her door at work and the bitchy comments that co-workers have made about them, but  urlLink The Kicker gets it right  when they start reporting on the crumbs in her sammich. Overkill. Just because  someone is a perfectionist doesn't make her media punching bag number one. Charles Manson  shouldn't be treated in the manner Bonnie is treated.  The Corsair  is now, 100 percent pro-Bonnie Fuller. You can kick a girl only so much before this 145 pound African wolfpack steps up to the plate,  Ninja-Style . Never let em see you sweat, Fuller; I got your back.   Out :   Lizzy Grubman . As  urlLink Cindy Adams reports , " LIZZIE Grubman  heading for an 'Apprentice'-type MTV show come Sep tember. Winner gets a p.r. job. 'I'm knocking off Donald,' she says." And I hope she means in the ratings and not some more of  urlLink the old SUV treatment .    In :   urlLink Hugs not drugs . Gothamist gives you your very own chance to air your thoughts on the most interesting picture in the world currently circulating.  Pimp Snoop Dogg  mesmerizing  The Olsen Twins , the most powerful media force in the world, no,  the galaxy , with his funkadelic chalice and syrupy pimp juice. Caption this puppy, please.  urlLink Please .   In :   urlLink Israeli Porn .  Variety  writes, "Israel's High Court of Justice unanimously ruled on Wednesday that the Playboy channel can continue to be broadcast in the holy land, thereby ending three years of legal sparring over the legality of its broadcasts. The special 11-justice panel rejected two petitions against the adult channel on cable and satellite television in Israel, but, amazingly, the judge decided to uphold the freedom of expression and even noted that the pornographic content of the channel was 'relatively light.'"    Out :  Celebrity Religion. Yesterday we blasted  Jim Carrey  and his pseudo religiosity that emerged from his forgotten  urlLink Randian  tint. Now  Jeff Bridges , on  urlLink his weblog , espouses some poo poo religiosity, "Free your heart from hatred,  Free your mind from worries, Live simply, Give more, Expect less." Less cliche, eff, now  shut up and act.    In :  The Passion of The  Lisa Whelchel .  Lisa Whelchel , who played Blair Warner on  Facts of Life  heartily endorses The Passion of the Christ  urlLink in her blog , "I have been struck lately with “the power of one!” What a difference – what a life-difference, one person, obeying their call can make in this world. Obviously, a very recent example of this is  Mel Gibson . What a worldwide impact this one man, just doing what the Lord prompted him to do, is going to have on eternity.   "(I like what [her daughter] said last week when we were discussing this. She said, “Does this mean that Mel Gibson is a Christian?” I answered, 'Apparently, so.' She quickly responded, 'Cool! I’d love to spend eternity with Mel Gibson!')" You, Blair, and tens of millions of annoying " urlLink crossover " music listeners.    Out :  Cindy Crawford's marriage is very out. Most bloggers figured this one out when  urlLink Page Six ran the blind item  about the philandering husband who frequents bars and his former supermodel wife.   Now,  urlLink Star Magazine , that significant cultural artifact, pokes at the burning embers, "On Feb. 26, five-and-a- half years (and two kids) into their seemingly model marriage,  Cindy Crawford  and husband  Rande Gerber  strolled outside a Brentwood, Calif., gym. As they walked side-by-side, arms interlaced, they kissed in the parking lot, looking like the perfect devoted husband and wife.  "Coincidentally or not, the day before Cindy and Rande's public display of affection, an item in The New York Post's Page Six gossip column  urlLink reported the marriage of a 'former supermodel and her hubby' was on the rocks  due to 'his constant philandering.' And although the identity of the cited couple can't be confirmed, Star has learned that bar owner Rande's philandering just may crush former supermodel's Cindy's marriage."  In:    Paul McCartney is fucking rich.   urlLink The Beeb  reports that, " Sir Paul McCartney's  wealth is bigger than the combined fortunes of  Sir Elton John ,  Sir Mick Jagger  and  Madonna , a list of the UK's richest stars reveals.

       Janet Jackson Exposed, Martha Stewart Convicted    Janet Jackson  is once again, uhm, exposed  urlLink in this German Magazine  (warning: not safe for workplace environments). Although I am not 100 percent sure about the turquoise nail polish, and I did not take the picture in question, again, the source is adamant (okay, some guy on  Velvetrope.com ) that this is the real deal Those crafty Germans.  Jackson,  urlLink according to The Scoop , has just been pencilled in to appear on SNL on April 10th to poke fun at herself:  "Another source familiar with the situation adds, 'She?s stayed out of the public eye since the whole Super Bowl fiasco. She?ll almost certainly do a skit that will refer to and spoof [the incident] in hopes of encouraging everyone to chill about this whole thing.'?  In other bad things celebrities do news,  urlLink Martha Stewart was convicted  of all counts against her. Sentencing scheduled for June 17,  urlLink AP/Yahoo says :  "The jury of eight women and four men deliberated three days before convicting Stewart of all counts against her. The charges carry up to 20 years in prison, but Stewart will most certainly get much less than that under federal sentencing guidelines.   "Stewart, 62, grimaced as each count against her was read. Her eyes appeared to widen slightly.   "Her ex-stockbroker,  Peter Bacanovic , 41, was convicted on all but one count against him, filing a false document."    urlLink Reuters  noted early this morning that Omnimedia shares were skyrocketing, "Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. stock jumped $1.68, or 12 percent, to $15.71 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. That's its highest level since June 2002."    urlLink But AP  and the NYSE had the final wod, "Shares of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. were halted by the New York Stock Exchange on Friday shortly before the guilty verdict in her stock fraud trial was announced.  "Shares of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia rose $2.24, or 16 percent, to $16.27 before the hold was imposed at 3:02 p.m."   urlLink Margaret Cho , always outspoken, on Martha Stewart,  urlLink in her blog ,"It seems to me that America inherently hates it when women are wildly successful, and there is a built in punishment that comes along with that kind of wealth. I cannot follow a recipe for shit, but I can spot misogyny from miles away. Why do we hate women who beat all the odds and come out on top? Why are books written to 'expose' their financial 'deviance,' as well as their 'ambitchiness?' Double standards abound, when reality shows are devoted to the tough inner life of the poor soul who must play sorcerer's apprentice to Trump's Merlin, and from scratch making, raffia using, household tip knowing Martha Stewart is facing a possible jail sentence of twenty years. If her manner with the people she worked with was ugly, if she were truly the megalomaniac monster we are told she is, why are her male counterparts glorified for displaying the exact same behavior?"

       Bonnie (Fuller) Come Lately   So there we were, listening to Beethoven's late quartets in the afternoon rain, sipping on a peppery cognac, reading  urlLink Keith Kelly's NY Post piece  on  Bonnie Fuller , when all of a sudden, I exploded into laughter. What caused this waste of such a mature cognac?  "Staffers (at Star) are also said to be upset that Fuller frequently conducts meetings while eating a sandwich or a bun that gives off lots of crumbs. Fuller doesn't deny that she gobbles down food in front of staffers at meetings, but said it's a two-way street.   "'We're very free around here. Sometimes I have a sandwich. The other day I was at a meeting in which two staffers were eating sandwiches. We don't go out for lunch.'"  Okay, now I've heard everything. Sandwich crumbs are now media news? Look, I was never a big fan of  Bonnie Fuller , but people are hitting her  waaaay  too hard and way too low. First that brutal --  bruutal -- Vanity Fair piece, which was just fucking nasty as far as I'm concerned, and now bitchy comments on her sammich crumbs?  Come on now . Let's stick to the  important  things, people, like photos of  Janet Jackson  sunbathing nekkid and  JLo's  ex husband bad mouthing her.    Ya know?    urlLink Lizzie Spiers  is also surprised by Crumbgate.

       Dick Morris: How to Beat John Kerry   Say what you will about Francophile  Dick Morris , the shady political operator who let a hooker listen in on his private strategy calls with former  President Clinton , but  you cannot call him incompetent . Today, in  urlLink The Hill , Morris lays out a strategy whereby the Republicans can defeat that can of hairspray  Senator John Kerry  ( The Corsair  wanted  John Edwards  for the nominee). Morris writes:  "In opting for Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts and turning down Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, Democrats have broken from the pragmatism and moderation that dominated their party’s profile under Bill Clinton and Al Gore in the 1990s."  ( The Corsair  nods, sadly)  "Their party has now moved back to the liberal extremism of  Walter Mondale  and  Michael Dukakis  that characterized the 1980s — with the same predictable result."  ( The Corsair  nods, sadly)  "It is now up to President Bush to take advantage of this by implementing a three-part strategy in the coming campaign.  "First, his paid media must attack Kerry’s voting record to define him as an ultraliberal. There are likely those in the White House who are urging Bush to run positive ads. That won’t work. Even if positive ads produce a small, short-term bounce for Bush, events soon will come to dominate, and the impact of those ads likely will evaporate."  ( The Corsair  lets out a depressed sigh)  For the other two reasons that  will give anyone pause, check out Morris column  urlLink here .

       JLo's Ex Speaks: And, Damn, does he sound Bitter   That significant cultural artifact  urlLink Star Magazine  gives up the scoop with a bitter interview with JLo's first husband. Doesn't JLo know how to pay off your exes? I mean, arent there lawyers and private investigators in Hollywood who make a living taking care of exes?    Anyhoo : The 29 year old Cuban-born  Ojani Noa , a former waiter who married J.Lo in early 1997 is speaking out to  urlLink The Star's Nicola Pittam & Anna Holmes :  "'While I am very happy, Jennifer does not seem that way,' hunky Noa, who's releasing a calendar of semi-nude photos, declares. 'She has changed so much since I first met her. I'm sure her romance with Ben failed because she changed.'  "'Ben went through the same joys I had with her in the early days,' Noa says. 'It is all incredibly romantic, but then she changes. The more famous she becomes, the more different she is -- I think it happens because of the people she has around her, her team of advisers, managers and lawyers. It happened to me when I was married to her. There were times when even I had to go through advisers to speak to her.'  "Noa says that Jennifer was in major denial about her transformation, however. 'She turned to me [one day] and said, You're not the man I married, he says. 'We'd only been married six months. But I hadn't changed, it was her. All she thought about was her work. It kind of hurt in a way because I was really young and really naive. To be honest, it felt like a betrayal.'"   urlLink Check out Star  for the rest of the story.

Well, today he turns 56. "And then we'll take it higher."   Out :  Ultraphony asshole  Jim Carrey  is definitely out. The National Enquirer's  Robin Mizrahi   urlLink paints a gloomy picture of the fake . She writes:  "'Jim (Carey) knows he's great at becoming other characters, but he feels he has no true soul of his own,' a close friend confided to The ENQUIRER.  "The twice-divorced performer also feels frustrated at not having found the right woman, but he doesn't think he'll find his soul mate until he first discovers his own true self, said the friend. And right now the spiritual pilgrim is practicing what he preaches.  "'Jim eats no wheat, dairy, sugar or processed food. No caffeine, either, and he doesn't smoke cigarettes or pot. And he's really into fasting - he actually enjoys feeling hungry,' revealed his friend.  "'Jim never does anything halfway. Even his house reflects his new philosophy - he's been giving away his possessions, little by little.'"  This, people, is the same Spiritual pilgrim who emerged from a rhino's ass.   In :  Minerals and herbs.  urlLink Roger Friedman of Foxnews.com  says of Jacko:  "When Jackson thought he was having a morphine overdose last December, I am told he called in one Alfredo Bowman, also known as 'Dr. Sebi.' Bowman is not a real doctor. He just plays one.   "Bowman ... is now staying with Michael in Aspen, feeding him  minerals and herbs  and talking to him very nicely. US Weekly says Dr. Sebi is 'detoxing' Michael from his addiction to alcohol and painkillers. " Hmmm. Minerals and herbs.    In :  Steroids.  urlLink Lloyd Grove  once again gives us the Sweet and Lowdown today. Interviewing extreme journalist  Robert Young Pelton , just back from the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, who interviewed a CIA operative known pnly as "The Contractor." The Contractor says about combat readiniess:  "Most (CIA operatives) are into steroids big-time. D-balls [Dianabol] to bulk you up and Sustanon to help you maintain what you gained. The doctors turn a blind eye to it. We get the stuff across the border in Pakistan."  What the  fuck ?   Out :  Nerds. The geek shall inherit the earth.  urlLink NY Times Martin Nisenholtz  insists that although he knows things tech, he is not a geek.   In :   Arianna Huffington . The new in thing in Washington is to succeed in Hollywood. HBO's K-Street,  Lawrence O'Donnell  and  Dede Myers  consulting for NBC's  The West Wing , and now Arianna Huffington, parlaying her run for Governor into political tv.  urlLink Rush and Molloy write :  " Halle Berry  and  Alfre Woodard  may be dueling it out on rival movies based on an incident in Tulia, Tex. Berry wants to play a defense lawyer for some of the 10% of the town's black residents who were falsely arrested on drug charges in 1999 on the word of a single cop. But 'Tulia' is still two years away. Meanwhile, producers  Arianna Huffington  and  David Yudain  have their own movie, 'Tulia, Texas,' ready to go for CBS, in which Woodard would star as  Mattie White , whose four children were all arrested." I'm  so  there.   In :  Excess. From  urlLink Page Six : " BEN Stiller  washing his $41 hamburger down with a glass of Dom Perignon at Old Homestead." Damn, all I had was a bite of  Bonnie Fuller's  crummy sandwich for lunch.   Out :   Adam Clayton Powell, Jr . versus  Charles Rangel . Page Six writes, "THAT State Assemblyman Adam Clayton Powell Jr. — one of the few Democratic legislators who spoke against the state's harsh ban on smoking and voted against the bill — held a fund-raiser last night at One on Little West 12th Street for his campaign against Rep. Charles Rangel, who won his Harlem congressional seat from Powell's father in 1970." Fuck. When are we Northerners going to figure out that the reason the South is so powerful is that they fall in line and reelect representatives for the long haul, thus  garnering seniority , and thus helping the region. Rangel is fourth in line to head Ways and Means and is steering a lot of pork to Harlem. Electing Powell simply because he wants to avenge his pappy s no help to Harlem. And  Al Sharpton  insinuating himself into this mess and backing Powell because he felt Rangel slapped him in the face by endorsing  Wes Clark  doesn't help matters.  Sheesh , Washington politics is as complicated as my last name.

How that proceeds and the extent to which it affects consumers of entertainment, news and information is a hugely important story."

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :    David Chappelle .  Fuck , Dave is so in with  The Corsair  that I am about to name him the new  Richard Pryor  based solely on the "I'm  Rick James , Bitch!" skit, easily some of the best comedy of the past decade. And I'm not alone in the praise. According to  urlLink medialifemagazine.com , " 'South Park' has long been the MVP of Comedy Central, hauling whatever show airs after it to decent ratings.   "But now it looks like one of those shows finally has detached itself from 'Park's' coattails, to the point that it is now bettering its lead-in's ratings.   "Comedy Central's 'Chappelle's Show' starring  Dave Chappelle  had a strong week and helped boost the network to an even stronger February, up 10 percent over the previous month among adults 18-49.  "'Chappelle,' which airs Wednesday at 10:30 p.m., was responsible for a good part of that. Last week's episode made the top 10 on ad-supported cable among viewers 18-49 years old. With more than 1.9 million viewers in the group, it was the most-viewed episode since the show's Jan. 21 season premiere."   Out :    urlLink Skull and Bones . And I thought only African-Americans devised complicated secret handshakes to crafted to intimidate the uninitiated. But we are all "the man" to Bonesmen.  Lloyd Grove  gives us the Sweet and Lowdown:  "On the Feb. 8 installment of 'Meet the Press,' the President was similarly uncommunicative ( ed note : about Skull and Bones).  "'It's so secret we can't talk about it,' he told Russert.  "'What does that mean for America?' Russert pressed. 'The conspiracy theorists are going to go wild.'   "'I'm sure they are,' Bush agreed with a nervous giggle."   The Corsair  nervously giggles.   In :  Former  urlLink Maine Senator, George Mitchell , the new "nonexecutive chairman" of Disney -- whatever that means. Mitchell is like Rob Lowe when it comes to jobs. He was  urlLink Clinton's  broker for the Irish Good Friday Agreement , a lawyer, an army intelligence officer,  urlLink a Senate Majority leader  and now this.  Crazy like Swayze .   Out :  Madonna's panties.  urlLink Jeannette Walls of MSNBC writes : "Madonna’s skivvies are up for sale. The lacy drawers that the singer wore in 'Evita' can be purchased for a mere $3,650 from Infinitely Better, a shop in Swindon, England."  Greeeat.   Madonna's bloomers, anyone ... Drawers? (frustrated) Kni...kni ...  Knickers   no, not ni -- I am not a racist, in fact I am black ... (sighs) anyone want these things? No? I kinda figured.

In an  urlLink web chat interview to mark World Book Day  she hinted she might write a beyond the seven promised Harry Potter books, "(Rowling) was asked: 'Are you going to write books about Harry after school?'  "Rowling gave fans hope when she replied: 'Probably not. But I'll never say never because every time I do I immediately break the vow.'"   Out :   urlLink Joe Francis . On  Howard Stern  today,  Snoop Dogg  painted a rather sordid picture indeed of the sleazy founder of the Girls Gone Wild franchise (if it is possible to make the purveyor of underage white girls topless seem sleazier), according to  urlLink Marksfriggin.com :  "Howard and Robin asked Snoop about his new video series 'Black Girls gone Buck Wild' that's with the Playboy people. Snoop said that the guy at Girls Gone Wild didn't want to have Latino and Black girls in his videos so he went out on his own to put out that stuff."  Greeeat.  Francis was going after that lucrative Kentucky white supremacist market.    In :   18 year old dancers, my friend (savors the words, a smile plays on The Corsair's lips) ... 18-year old dancers. They are crafty the way they get you to buy them things. The Smokinggunners write of  urlLink Diane Ritchie , who is seriously threatening to part Lionel from his Commodore stash:  "The Richies, who wed in December 1996 and have two young children, live in a $40 million Beverly Hills mansion, with its 30 rooms spread over 18,000 square feet. 'In addition to nine full time staff members, we also employ people to maintain our plants, detail our cars, care for our pool, groom our dog, maintain our aquarium and a painter for regular touch ups on the house,' noted Richie. She also made sure to point out particular monthly expenses that Lionel, 54, needs to cover: clothing, shoes, and accessories ($15,000); dermatology ($3000); laser hair removal ($1000); massages ($600); jewelry ($5000); gifts ($5000); and vitamins ($500). There are plenty of other costs Richie listed--like $20,000 annually for plastic surgery and her nine-year-old son's $125,000 boarding school tuition--but TSG will let you discover those chestnuts. According to Richie, she began dating the pop star in 1984, when they met at the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles (she was an 18-year-old dancer)." I love that last line, an aside, tossed out into the ethers, as if to explain everything (sotto vocce) " she was an 18-year old dancer."  A  ballerina girl , if you will.   Out :   College athletics. Call me a nerd, my little pomegranates, but I went to college for a classical liberal arts education, not to shoot hoops or rape. Well, the  urlLink University of Georgia  joins the ranks of other corrupt univeristy athletics departments spanning the nation from sea to shining sea. As the  urlLink Smokinggunners  write:  "Until his resignation last year amidst allegations of impropriety in UGA's basketball program, Harrick was an assistant coach under his father,  Jim Harrick . In addition to helping pop run the lay-up line, the younger Harrick taught 'Coaching Principles and Strategies in Basketball' during 2001's fall semester. The 39-student class was popular with several of Harrick's players, since the coach wasn't a stickler when it came to attendance, studying, or showing up for the College of Education course's only test. Below you'll find that test, a 20-question mockery that includes such brain teasers as, 'How many points does a 3-point field goal account for in a Basketball Game?'"   Fuck .

       Who Is Novak's Source?    K Street  is heating up once again as the election year approaches, as well it should. America is the last standing superpower in the world, and K Street,  urlLink DC , is the center of that power.  urlLink Editor and Publisher  notes that  Robert Novak's  source will be named in the new autobiography of former Ambassador  Joseph Wilson :  "Sources say the embargoed title,  The Politics of Truth , from Carroll & Graf, will reveal who tipped off syndicated columnist Robert Novak in July that Wilson's wife,  Valerie Plame , worked for the CIA--a felony punishable by as many as ten years in prison--and the larger circumstances around the leak. The matter is the subject of a grand-jury investigation that has seen Novak, Wilson and a number of high-profile administration members questioned."   Also in K Street news, the question as to who will replace  Jack Valenti  is up in the air.   The ultra sleazy Washington lobbyist and  MPAA  head  Jack V   took a bit of an ass whipping at the hands of Federal Judge  Michael B. Mukasey  in New York recently.   Citing "unlawful restraint of trade," that the MPAA's "screener ban" would significantly harm independent films, Mukasey granted a preliminary injunction, effective immediately,  urlLink blocking the policy .  Falling back on the old chesnut that screeners are major sources of piracy,  we won't entertain the possibility   that old Jack is trying to protect the Oscar from deserving independent films, who have cleaned the clocks of the tired, formulaic old studios.   In other news,  urlLink Louisiana Congressman Billy Tauzin  dropped out of the running, and gave up his top contender position  of taking over from  urlLink Valenti . Why would a powerful Republican in the majority party even want to become head of the embattled MPAA?   Well, the $1.03 million salary might be incentive. How about that sweet screening room at MPAA's Washington headquarters (perhaps third in coolness behind the White House screening room and Steven Spielberg's), then there are the orchestra seats at the Oscars, the  urlLink limosine and driver , the office two blocks away from the White House, and first class travel to film festivals.   Ah, the line between  urlLink K Street  and, er, uhm,  urlLink K Street  is blurred.   urlLink The Hill  notes two superhighpowered contenders for Valenti's job:  "One is 12th-term  Rep. David Dreier  (R-Calif.), the chairman of the Rules Committee who headed the successful gubernatorial campaign of movie star  Arnold Schwarzenegger  and has been romantically linked to several movie actresses.   "The other is even better known: White House National Security Adviser  Condoleezza Rice , who perhaps not so coincidentally was given a warm introduction at a Valentine’s Day party last month hosted by  Bill Cohen , the former defense secretary and Republican senator from Maine."  God, I wish  urlLink K Street  were still on.  Finally, at the highest levels of power, it is no secret that Bush never forgave McCain for challenging him in the primary in 2000, became the media darling of the race, and made him spend some of his oil stained campaign booty in said primary. Well, the two are at it again, just like South Carolina, according to  urlLink The Hill . Bush, attempting to be seen as even handed on the independent commission on intelligence, appointed McCain chair. Bad move, writes  Alexander Bolton :  " Sen. John McCain  (R-Ariz.) is pushing the White House to give subpoena power to the independent commission President Bush created last month to investigate intelligence operations.   "The administration has turned him down, but the senator is refusing to take no for an answer.  "The clash reignites a bitterness first sparked when Bush and McCain fought for the GOP presidential nomination in 2000."  Reignites? It never simmered down, dude.

       John Kerry's Manhood   As if to make up for that whole lack of National Security street cred, the backers of the Democrats ( Jann Wenner  in that infamous  urlLink Rolling Stone cover of Al Gore ) try to insinuate that the nominee has a massive shlong.  urlLink John Kerry is no different  (link via  urlLink Fleshbot  via  urlLink Wonkette ). They may not belive in the death penalty or military bases in every congressional district, but they have three legs.

       Tina on Nader   "There was something perversely thrilling about the old Raider's decision not to do the decent thing and lie low (or even help the side he claims to be on)," writes  urlLink Tina Brown in the Washington Post . "In an era when every politician's naked ego is muffled by euphemism, his bloody-minded announcement was the political version of unprotected sex. He is willing to trash his legacy to make a point about process."  And then she delivers the coup de grace, like a jailhouse shiv between the ribs: "Crazy alpha-men in their waning years have a miserable time out of the limelight."  Rarely do we agree with Tina,  but that is so true .

       Oscar Night Romps    urlLink Those intrepid 3AM Girls  got the goods on the  after-after Oscar party (wink-wink),  you know , the parties that begin in private rooms at the Chateau Marmont after the drinks at Morton's makes everyone a little frisky.   Apparently,  Benicio del Toro , whose name, the 3AM Girls freely translate to mean, "Benny the Bull," was seen  canoodling  with the  Lost in Translation  star with the sexiest ass  The Corsair  believes he has ever seen:  "Our spies caught the pair walking into the exclusive Chateau Marmont hotel on Sunset Boulevard at 3.30am with their arms wrapped around each other before getting into a lift to go somewhere a little more intimate.  "'They didn't care who saw them,' says our source. 'They walked through the hotel lobby where there were quite a few people hanging about and didn't seem at all embarrassed to be spotted with their arms all over each other."   The Corsair  munches on salt-free popcorn and leans into his screen.  "'It was quite extraordinary. She looks so young and he could easily pass for her dad.  "'They then got into a lift together. At that time in the morning they couldn't have been heading to the hotel pool, put it like that. They were clearly going to the rooms.  "'You would have thought they'd want their beauty sleep as the ceremony took place later that afternoon, but clearly not.' Puerto Rican Benicio, 37, apparently likes his ladies young.  "The sexy actor once smooched with British supermodel  urlLink Sophie Dahl  at a New York club when she wasn't much older than his newest squeeze."   urlLink Page Six  Reports:  " Naomi Campbell  was making the rounds at Mortons with music mogul  Steve Stoute , but word was out that she and 'Rush Hour' director  Brett Ratner  are an item — perhaps be cause they were spotted coming out of the Beverly Hills Hotel the other day around noon."  Ah,  l'amour.    Also:   The 3AM Girls noted, in a side blind item:  "WHICH showbiz bash host instructed door staff to confiscate mobile phones with cameras? He was so worried compromising piccies would get out he refused entry to anyone who wouldn't give their handsets in."  Smart idea, but the enemy of bloggers. Was that  Graydon Carter  by any chance?  And:  Lizzie Spiers'   urlLink Oscar Night Bonfire of the Vanities .  And:  urlLink The great Michael Musto  sums up The Oscars.  Thanks for the link Uncle Grambo!

       Dasani Bottled Water is Tap Water   In the beginning was the Jesus Juice, now  urlLink The BBC reports  that Coca Cola's experiment in bottled water,  urlLink Dasani , the second biggest selling bottled water in the US, is actually nothing more than "purified" tap water. The Beeb reports:  "Soft drink giant Coca-Cola has admitted it is selling purified tap water in a bottle.  It says the source for its new Dasani bottled water is the mains supply at its factory in Kent.   "The company says Dasani is 'as pure as bottled water gets' due to a 'highly sophisticated purification process'."   And you thought Evian spelled backwards was naive?   Just so long as no one messes with my  urlLink Fiji water . That's my joint right there, straight or as a splash in my  Cutty Sark .

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :    " Rob Lowe  will play the lead role in the CBS drama series 'Dr. Vegas,' as the doctor at a hotel in, you guessed it, Vegas," reports  urlLink Media Life .   In the recent past Lowe has been employed as a Presidential speechwriter who leaves his job to run for Congress, a lawyer and now a doctor. We never would have guessed that the sax playing, hard boozing and partying  urlLink Billy Hixx  from St. Elmo's Fire would be such a yuppie professional with so many careers. He's a  urlLink Man In Motion .   Out :   M & M's . Melts in your mouth not in your hands, righ?  Wrong ! As  Jeanette Walls  of  urlLink TheScoop  writes: "Joan Rivers got into a turf war with the BBC. The caustic funnywoman was broadcasting her fashion critique from the red carpet at the Oscars for E! and kept butting heads and fighting over guests with a reporter for the BBC, says a source.   "'Honestly, the BBC people were being sort of aggressive about grabbing [celebrities] and saying  we?re in a live shot  and then holding onto them forever,' says a source. 'Or they kept luring over guests who were talking to Joan by offering them  urlLink M&Ms  if they would stop talking to Joan and come over to talk to them. Joan and the BBC were bickering over  Nicole Kidman  for example. Joan was joking about it all, but it actually got pretty ugly at a few points.'"   In :   urlLink Hookers as a Vehicle to Win the Best Actress Oscar  Ted Casablancas of E! Entertainment -- easily the shallowest television channel -- makes a fascinating point by way of telling us that  Tom Cruise  and  Penelope Cruz  broke up. He says:  "More reliable is the notion that chicks in Hollywood will forever play chickas for hire--and get Academy Award noms and wins out the wazoo for the privilege. You know the heady list:  Elizabeth Taylor ,  Julia Roberts ,  Elisabeth Shue ,  Mira Sorvino , et al.  "Now, didja think I wasn't gonna ask *( Jane Fonda ). about Charlize's 'murdering lady of the evening' Oscar nod? (After all, Jane-hon received her own gold playing a hooker in 1971's  Klute .) She diplomatically said to moi, specifically in regard to Charlize, 'The Academy sees that it's a complex role to portray a woman who wasn't born a monster.'"   Out :  Split personalities. Apparently,  Beyonce Knowles  needs to put on a split persona act to get on stage and shake her ample booty, according to  urlLink The Star .  Louise Gannon  writes:  "Beyonce says it was a cousin of hers who first noticed that she became an entirely different person onstage.  "'She came up with the name Sasha and it sort of stuck. Now, when I go onstage in one of my outfits, everyone around me calls me Sasha."  "Without Sasha, Beyonce notes, 'you'd get a very different girl. There's no way I'd wear a short little dress [and] dance like that in front of all those people. Beyonce Knowles is really just a very quiet, shy little thing.'"

       Lord of the Voting Academy Members   With over 26,000 cast and crew, many of which are voting Academy members -- costumers, model builders, digital experts, lighting technicians, etc -- it is no wonder LOTR made an incredible 11 out of 11 sweep at the Oscars.    urlLink Rush and Molloy  quoted  Sir Elton John , "It was the most boring Oscars I have ever seen,' he told us at the party he threw with InStyle magazine at Pearl.  "'I thought there might be one surprise in the song category, but even there Lord of the Rings won. And I don't think it deserved to."   Me neither, Elton.   Poor (but wealthy)  Harvey Weinstein , who  urlLink let the film slip through his short fingers , like  Melissa Rivers'  slender foot busting through her  Jimmy Choo  last night, must be howling right about now for letting New Line take his lunch money.  I imagine dreamily that he and embattled Disney CEO  Michael Eisner  -- who took some collateral hits as well -- are somewhere, possibly  urlLink The Ivy , licking their wounds, counting their lumps, and bonding over the absurdity of it all:   Michael Eisner : Shit, Harv. Bad night all around, huh.   Harvey Weinstein : That's a fucking understatement, Mike.   Eisner :  urlLink Lotsa noise  coming from my end.    Weinstein : (embarrassed) Sorry, Mike, that was  urlLink me  (shoos his backside with a copy of Variety),  Damned Wolfgang Puck and his fucking French Perigord black truffles  ... too rich.   Eisner : (covering his nose all of a sudden) oh, Harvey ...   Weinstein : Hey, didja see The Lord of the Voting Academy Members sweep?   Eisner : Evil genius, Harv; evil fuckin' genius. That business model reeked of Dark Lord Sauron.   Weinstein : Takes one ta know one (laughs). Imagine sending a cast of 26,000 -- many of whom are Academy members -- to vote in the interest of their resumes. No wonder.   Eisner : I took a beating last night too, Harv, if ya hadn't noticed.    Weinstein : And  urlLink Finding Nemo  should have been spun as a win for Disney. You know you are half way to Ovitzville when  Robin Williams  of all people is comparing your company to "a Muppet and a water slide."   Eisner : I have a lot of enemies, Harvey, what can I fuckin' say.  urlLink I'm like an African dictator holding on to power . There are a lot of laid off and bitter animators out there looking to trap the mouse.   Weinstein : Player haters, Mike; they are just playa hatin'.   Eisner : As I always say, don't playa hate, congratulate.  Weinstein: Or in my fuckin' case: don't playa hate,  emulate . Next time around Miramax is financing a film with  50,000  Academy voting extras, I'm gonna be throwin my weight around.

       President Howard Stern?    urlLink  Howard Stern  mentioned this morning that he may consider running for President.   Of course he will not, ultimately, for several reasons, some of which are:  1) He will not reveal his current salary and IRS forms to the press, for fear that  Thesmokinggun.com  would pummel him.  2) He is past his prime and will not -- even if he registers new people to vote -- break 5 percent.  3) He would probably -- if he ran -- help reelect Bush, which is, for him, a nightmarish FCC scenario.  4) It would fuck up his ABC TV Barbara Walteresque deal, which begins in the spring, on a limited basis.  Instead of running for President, Stern should (and could) broker a deal -- shnell!  -- with Senator John Edwards for an endorsement before the Super Tuesday primary. Stern could give Edwards his endorsement -- in the best of all possible worlds --if the Senator promised to run to reform the FCC, for the better. This would have to be done on the morning show tommorrow in time to make a difference in the Super Tuesday primary. Time is of the essence here.  Other than that, Nader could possibly swoop in and make the promise and get the Stern endorsement (*recoils in horror*).   There is no doubt that this election will be one part economy, and one part cultural, with Stern on the one side, and  Mel Gibson  on the other, representing the twin polarities of our democractic life. Bush congenitally plays the culture card when the economy tanks, just like his daddy and the " urlLink Flag desecration " amendment.    Note to John Edwards : Make this happen.

       A Little of The Old In and Out    In :  Not that I have anything against it (I'm not) -- but I'm curious about the culural significance of  The Rise of White Africans  as I, myself, am a black African-born blogger. First, there was the exotic  Theresa Heinz , all over the cultural landscape, and now, out of nowhere,  Charlize Theron . What's up, buttercup?  Out:  urlLink J-Lo's Tush . According to that significant cultural artifact the  National Enquirer :  " Dr. Richard Fleming , codirector of the Beverly Hills Institute of Aesthetic and Reconstructive Surgery, told Planet Tab: 'Hollywood thrives on youthfulness and influences how people all over the world judge beauty. And we're always surprised by our patients' top picks of celebrity features.  "'Jennifer Lopez's lips are still considered appealing, but last year everyone wanted her butt - which now, no one ever asks for. That was last year's look.  "'While a huge percentage of patients want to look like the strong classic beauties, such as  Catherine Zeta- Jones  and  Charlize Theron , there are always those who request to look like the celebrities who might not be classic beauties, but are hot at the moment.'"  In:  urlLink Bill Murray . Always In.   Out :  Silly little freak and disgraced African American journo  urlLink Jayson Blair's memoir  of which,  editornadpublisher.com  writes, " the Daily News'   Paul D. Colford  pounced on (the memoir's bits), such as: 'Zuza [my girlfriend] took pictures of me prancing around the newsroom wearing a Persian head wrap that covered my face, Kermit the Frog on my shoulders and a giant fake fur coat. I did a full tour de newsroom in this peculiar uniform. It is hard to know what I was feeling, other than it was exhilarating to shock everyone. Perhaps I was crying out for attention.'"  Out!    In : Restless former designer/comic book writer/movie pusher/talk show host and snarky asshole Izaac  urlLink Mizrahi  gets a development deal. What the fuck is up with that? Is he going to do a reality show starring FIT students vying for a fashion show at the tents in Mid-Manhattan? And--the better question --how will that gain a  national  NBC audience?  Anyhoo : Mizrahi got a deal (more than I can say), which,  The Corsair  predicts, will be seven figures thrown into the void by NBC, but, ultimately, a mahor windfall by  Les Miz .   Out :   urlLink Kerry against free speech.  Presidential hopeful  Senator John Kerry  is running on his bandylegs to the political center now that he has all but locked up the nomination, fleeing from Democratic principles such as free speech, in order to short the Bushies push for a "culture war" platform framed by social moderates and evangelicals over issues like gay marriage and The Passion of The Christ. In his center break, Kerry is tossing Stern over the bow like a hot potato. Great going, future President asshole!   In :    urlLink Forbes Gets Global  and Grows Up. For years the Forbes 500 List looked like an alumni picture from last year's  urlLink bohemian grove outing . A few years ago, those pasty Princetonians, embarrassed by the lack of billionaires in Africa that were not dictators (laissez faire works!), paired up Africa and the Middle East in their Forbes 500 listing. Well, now they are beginning to get it. Less pink bespectacled flesh and more color:  The Corsair  approves.   Out :    urlLink Robert Novak  (link via  urlLink Romenesko ), the maddening CNN personality who has inserted himself into the  Valerie Plame  Bush administration spy affair. Just name your source, Novak! No one will question your "journalistic principles" (a very 3am in the morning C-Span affair if you ask me) when you save US tax payers millions trying to ferret out the info via legal bills and congressional inquiry.

       McCain and Kerry: The Phantom Menace   What is up with  urlLink Senator John McCain's  odd, mysterious flirtations with Kerry's presidential posse, from across the Senate Republican cloak room and, quite frankly, the "across party lines reciprocations" from the  Kerry  camp? It's like a modern day  West Side Story , with MCcain, the former southwestern POW, a cagey jet, and preppy John Kerry, a shark. Like West Side Story, their choreography is complicated. And it has more than a touch of  policial phantom menace .  In other words, why is a Republican senator from a conservative southwestern state making oblique overtures towards the opposition presidential candidiate in an election year? Why are Bush and Kerry fucking with the President?   urlLink Robert Novak , always ahead of the curve, offers us this tasty hunk of  urlLink yellow cake :  "In this winter of Republican discontent, the last thing the Grand Old Party needed last week was  Sen. John McCain  leaving the door open for him to be  John Kerry's  Vice Presidential running mate on the Democratic ticket. That opening was tiny, and McCain quickly had it closed with a bang. Nevertheless, the incident was disturbing to knowledgeable Republicans.  "A  Kerry-McCain  ticket is out of the question, and nobody knows it better than McCain. Then why did he for several hours last Wednesday permit what the Associated Press described as 'a glimmer of hope' for this unlikely combination? It reflects more than the senator's indisputable propensity for mischief-making. At a time when George W. Bush needs help and support, McCain is opposing him on a broad front of issues from tax cuts to global warming."  On  urlLink ABC's Good Morning America  recently, John McCain said, ''John Kerry is a close friend of mine. We have been friends for years. Obviously, I would entertain it.'' Say ---  What?!   Then, last week, as if out of the blue,  urlLink Ben Smith of the salmon colored media bible The Observer  wrote in a story that, "A close adviser to Republican Senator John McCain is informally advising Senator John Kerry on his Presidential bid and may go to work for the Democrat's campaign."   Hmmm.  There are higher forces at work here. A phantom menace.   The man in question, the Texan  urlLink John Weaver , was political director to Mr. McCain?s failed 2000 campaign against the President.    So what's going on? One imagines an "impromptu" meeting with the President in the West Wing.  Hmmm:    President Bush : May the campaign contributions be with you, my padawan, how are you today?   John McCain : Well, I'm not feeling too welcome with the  urlLink Republicans , of late. Where's the love?   The President : Really, John, sorry to hear that. What's all this crazy talk I hear about you as Kerry's running mate?   Senator McCain : It's just speculation. I'm trying to put the kibosh on it once and for all, Mr. President.   The President : That's good, John.  Patience . Use the Force ...  think.   Senator McCain : Sorry, Mr. President.    The President : Here, you dropped this (hands McCain his  Republican Party membership card .)   Senator McCain : Thank you, Mr. President.   The President : (fatherly) Next time try not to lose it.   Senator McCain : Thank you, Mr. President    The President : (anxious) This weapon is your life!   Senator McCain : (frustrated) I  try , Mr. President.   The President : (dejected) Why do I get the feeling you're going to be the  election defeat  of me?   Senator McCain : (vehement) Don't say that, Mr. President. You're the closest thing to a leader I have.   The President : (sadly)  Then why don't you  listen to me ?   Senator McCain : (at last ...) I am  trying , Mr. President.   And a Preview from our next Corsair episode : McCain meets the dry, stately Kerry in his private campaign bunker, who declares,  benignly , to the Arizona Republican, "You don't need Presidential guidance, John. In time, you will learn to trust your feelings. Then, you will be invincible. I have said it many times, you are the most gifted Senator I have ever met."   McCain : Thank you,  Mr. Nominee .    Kerry : I see you becoming the greatest of all the Senators, John. Even more powerful   urlLink Bill Clinton ."  to be continued

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  Jack Shaeffer . Shaeffer  urlLink spanks   Jayson Blair  in  urlLink The New York Times Book Review , with just the right amount of english on the paddle to give everyone a satisfying conclusion, after our  loong  hard slough of media navel gazing re: his --  his  -- plagerism. And although we are a little upset at his  urlLink recent tirade , which I think is unfair against my comrades, my  amigos  in media and political snark  urlLink Gawker  and  urlLink Wonkette , here, at least, he squarely gets Blair for the allegedly unrepentant tone of the book ( ed note : I have not read the book, nor do I plan to, but every reviewer I've read agrees that the tone is not repentant, as is it on his other media interviews, which I have seen). But Schaeffer, hey! lighten up on the  Edward Murrow  judgements on  Wonkette  and  Gawker , who leave me  glad  at heart in those hungover mornings, not sad of heart, as you say. I have to give the man some credit:  Jack Shaeffer was all over the mediascape this week . So was  urlLink Editor and Publisher . Those guys  worked it  this week, turning out the most interesting -- and ethical -- questions to Blair, and holding his feet to the fire over his answers.   Out :  urlLink Liz Clairbourne Aims to Replace Martha Stewart . The vultures are circling the  urlLink disbudded golden Guernsey , Martha Stewart.  Michael Flaherty  of Reuters  urlLink writes :  "Sofas, love seats and armoires are joining sweaters, slacks and blouses under the  Liz Claiborne  brand, as the clothing designer guns for big-name rivals including  Martha Stewart  with a planned September launch of a full furniture line.   " Liz Claiborne  last year signed an agreement with home furnisher Lexington Home Brands for 140 furniture items.  Liz Claiborne Home  products already offers floor coverings and bed and bath merchandise, and last month hired Block wares LLC  to design and manufacture home organizing products.   "'This is an opportunity to replace  Martha Stewart ,' said  Barbara Friedman , president of licensing for New York-based  urlLink Liz Claiborne Inc.  Stewart, the lifestyle trendsetter, was convicted last week of lying about a stock trade, and rivals are taking aim at her media and household goods company  urlLink Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia .   Look out, Martha!Don't take a shower alone ("and that's  not  a good thing"!)! But   as even as the girl gangs in  urlLink Danbury, CT are salivating for a tussel, targeting you , look to your home! Watch your back! Liz Clairbourne is casing the joint!   In :  Suge Knight's  Uncut. Just yesterday it was noted that  Russell Simmons  is retiring (thank god!) the godawful advertisement for himself, that -- that  thing , called  urlLink Oneworld Magazine  (hey  Russell , cornbread, how about  one last   Kimora  cover feature for the road?) . Well,  Suge Knight  has plans to launch another urban title in its stead, reports the  urlLink Page Sixers :  " MARION 'Suge' Knight  wants to start his own magazine. According to allhiphop.com, the founder of  Tha Row Records  wants to release  Uncut , a part-hip-hop, part-tabloid publication. 'Suge wants to do it,' a source told the Web site. 'The major obstacle is that there is a British publication by the same name, so a name change might happen.' Knight will start work on the magazine when he gets out of jail next month. He was sent back to prison in June of 2003 on a parole violation."    Out :  Suge Knight's  possible ties to a  cannibal  rapper. Folk's ...  I couldn't make this up if I tried . According to the previously mentioned  allhiphop.com , "(Suge's) Death Row provided drugs to  Anton 'Big Lurch' Singleton , who is charged with the grizzly murder of a 21 year-old Los Angeles, California area woman."  Knight told Reuters that he knows nothing of Singleton, offering this insight on the motivation behind the attempt to smear the name of  Death Row  -- which, of course, is  sterling . (Affects Boston Brahmin accent) My dear, everyone who is everyone knows that Death Row is to music what  urlLink Skidmore, Owings and Merrill  is to architecture,  lo ultimo .  "They're just looking to get paid," Knight told  urlLink allhiphop.com . "It's not only just slander. It's fraud."   urlLink Allhiphop.com  reports:  "( Anton 'Big Lurch' Singleton ) is  urlLink on trial for the murder  of  Tynisha Ysais , 21. Ysais was found her apartment with her chest ripped open. According to testimony, Singleton and Ysais' boyfriend  Thomas Moore , spent the evening prior to the murder smoking PCP.  "On Friday (April 11), Ysais' mother,  Carolyn Stinson  filed a wrongful deat lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court against Stress Free Records and Knight's Death Row Records, claiming that both provided Singleton drugs in an attempt to make him more marketable as a 'gangsta rap' artist.  "Authorities later arrested a disoriented Singleton as he wandered down the street nude, covered in blood."   urlLink Nolan Strong  continues, horrifyingly:  "Later testing revealed human flesh in his stomach. When Ysais body was discovered, her lungs were exposed and had been chewed on.  "Stinson's lawyer also appeared to back away from the allegations leveled at  Death Row  in the lawsuit.  "'We're continuing to investigate,' McKesson said. 'If it turns out that Death Row is right -- that there is no connection, we will drop them (from the lawsuit) immediately.'"   Yikes.   And now, from the cannibals to the coutouriers:   In :  urlLink No Man Can Serve Two Masters .  urlLink Vanessa Friedman of the Financial Times  takes us deep within the  urlLink wine dark ermine robes  of the fashion industry, examining the latest crease:  "For the last decade, conventional wisdom has held that the shortcut to brand success was to appoint a designer with an already existing line and identity to a stagnant label and watch both grow; by contrast today's PPR appointments say one designer cannot serve two brands, and talent is grown, not bought.  "'At one point it was the model for a designer to start their own line and develop it and then be snatched up by a large house,' says  urlLink Floriane de Saint Pierre , president and general director of  Floriane de Saint Pierre Associates , a fashion and luxury executive search firm. In exchange for creative contributions to a pre-existing brand, the designer would receive investment in their own brand and management aid. 'But how do you split your time? Your creativity?'" Short answer:  you can't . At least not well.   Out :  urlLink What if Prince William Came to Live in New York For a Year?   Apparently someone forgot to tell  William Nowich  that we beat the British during the end of the 18th century in a little  somethig-something  called the American Revolution.  Hello?    Anyhoo : What would William do by way of a job?  Norwich  guesses, "Editorial assisting at royalty-friendly Vanity Fair would serve nicely."   ''I wouldn't put a royal below 14th Street,'' says the real estate broker  Linda Stein . ''Uptown is safer. The prince needs to get to an airport fast, just in case. He also needs something where the lobby is not too busy. He needs something with a discreet entrance.''    Okay , I'll admit, Norwich entertained me on that little divertissement.

Well, Owen was everywhere this week (see blog below), even popping up in, of all places,  urlLink the New York Times Men's Fashion supplement, in Rome , interviewed by  Josh Patner , who writes:  "(Owen) Wilson is no wide-eyed hick. Writers have called him a ''big-popcorn movie star' and 'bankable headliner.' He is an actor who has it all: down-home folksiness and art-house weight, megaplex sex appeal and a deep sense of complex characters. His peculiarly deadpan delivery (he sounds like an old-time character actor playing a boozy cowboy) and versatile presence on screen (he can be ironic and naive) have made for a charmed career. 'Bottle Rocket,' his first film, a crime caper written with Anderson, who also directed, was screened at the  urlLink Sundance Film Festival  in 1993. 'It's kind of incredible,' he says, a toothpick twirling in his teeth. 'Wes and I were friends in school; we'd go see two movies a night. Wes worked in the projection booth, so we went for free. And here we are at Cinecitta, where  Scorsese  filmed. It's good, man.'"  You lucky dog, Owen.     Out : Will Hillary be Veep in 2004? Although she may win him Arkansas --  possibly  -- the Dems need a stronger regional candidate, and New York is a foregone conclusion, a given, even if Dubya picks  Giuliani  to stand in for an "ailing"  Dick Cheney . But strategist  urlLink Dick Morris  seems to think that a Veep spot is the last chance for Hillary to fulfil her Presidential potential. He writes:  "If Kerry wins in 2004, he will very likely seek re-election. The last time a president served four years and didn’t try to succeed himself was back in 1880 and the president was  urlLink Rutherford B. Hayes . So, unless Hillary wants to try to mount the first successful challenge to a presidential renomination since  urlLink Gene McCarthy  forced  urlLink Lyndon Johnson  into retirement in 1968, she will have to sit out the 2008 contest.  "Should Kerry be re-elected, his vice president will probably be the Democratic candidate in 2012. All five times, since 1960, that a vice president sought the nomination for president after his party controlled the White House for at least two terms he has gotten it ( urlLink Richard Nixon  in 1960,  urlLink Hubert Humphrey  in 1968,  urlLink Gerald Ford  in 1976, George H.W. Bush in 1980, Al Gore in 2000). That means that Hillary would be out in the cold until at least 2016 and, if the Democrat won and was re-elected, until 2020. She’ll be 73 by then."  "... And don’t kid yourself; the decision is Hillary’s to make. The Clintons still control the Democratic Party. If Hillary wants to run for vice president, Kerry has to go along.  For him to spurn the former first lady would be to cause a schism in the party. He’ll be pulling knives out of his back for the entire race."   In :  urlLink Kerry's Proposed Lincoln-Douglas style Debates .  urlLink Locking up  the Democratic Party nomination, John Kerry has an interesting proposition. Fascinating, really: hold a series of  Lincoln-Douglas  style debates across this polarized country and let the people decide. The idea comes through Massachusetts (the historic  urlLink Silber versus William Weld  Gubernatorial race), by way of  urlLink Ilinois 1858 .  The Lincoln-Douglas Debates are, perhaps, our most noble rhetorical moment -- moreso than the  urlLink debates surrounding the Articles of Confederation , I believe.  urlLink Lincoln's "House Divided" speech  ("A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure, permanently, half slave and half free.") places him as a sort of Moses for Modernity, certainly for African Americans.   The President sets himself up as a bold and principled Everyman, so, in theory at least, he cannot back down or lose some of his edge. Kerry gains in that the exposure -- on equal footing with the President of the last superpower -- feuls his candidacy. It also solves the cash gap of the corporations and the right. If Kerry scores in a debate, the free positive publicity for him, and the free negative publicity for the president would be, if you'll excuse the term, "priceless."   Out :   urlLink Luciano Pavarotti . Not a fan. Never was. He was cheesy. So, I'll "excavate" an old blog, from December 13, 2003, that tells my feelings better than I could myself:  "Right off the bat I am not going to say that I am a fan of Opera as a  species , per se, although the early operas of  Monteverdi   have moved me, what with their odd sense of acceleration of pace and repetitions of phrase. I have found myself caught in the funk, so to speak, on those occasions, and have been known to move my midsection vigorously, to oscillate wildly, like  Courtney Cox  in that godawful  urlLink Springsteen video . No, I really didn't but it sounded interesting, didn't it? No? What ever .   Not that  Luciano Pavarotti  would ever include Early Music in his pre-processed cheesy repertoire. So, as you can guess, I do not see the need for his physical coming-to-be in Western Civilization, although I am  vaguely aware  that he actually does exist. He's big with bored housevives in the Midwest,  isn't he ?   Anyhoo:   The big man  urlLink got all pimped out  for his wedding to his 30-year old ex-secretary,  Nicoletta Mantovani   ( ed note : this is from December 2003). How cliche is that,  anyway ?    And with  The Corsair , the only sins are sins of cliche ... and tackiness ... and Pavarotti is the king of tackiness; his tack is  very very nessy . We like to call him  Louche -iano Pavaratti, in my little media precinct of one. The dyed jet-black beard is  highly  implausible, my sweet readers --  highly!  --and that fake ever-present smile (sotto voce)  so fake ,  creeps us out. And then there's that cheesy Three Tenors video where Arnold Shwarzenegger sits in the front row, fairly busting out his tuxedo, applauding loudly, sweet, sweet sophisticated readers:  That  was the moment that  Oswald Spengler  so tragically predicted, rendered agonically in  Decline of the West . Yuck!  Reuters reports:   "'Alice joyfully invites you to the wedding of daddy Luciano and mummy Nicoletta,' read the invitation from the couple's 11-month-old daughter."  A babymommy . They continue:   "A host of stars, including Irish rocker  Bono  and Italian singer  Zucchero , turned out for the wedding which was eagerly anticipated by Italian gossip magazines and television chat shows."  Well, if  Zucchero  was there, then it must indeed have been the thing to do on that particular evening.  But the true story -- and  The Corsair  is nothing if not a bloodhound on the search for scoop -- lies with  Adua , jilted wife number one.  Somewhere the  urlLink well-paid Adua  is speaking of things Pavarotti from behind clenched teeth and making broad and fast arm movements as is the Italian manner when emotional issues are involved. And boy would I like a translator to decipher  that  scoop.  Because we all understand the language of jilt. What? You mean you've never excavated the archaeology of "dumped"? It's just me being bitter? Okay (gets highly agitated) ... :  whatever .    Owen Wilson: Behind Enemy Lines in Stripclub Armageddon     urlLink Britain's 3AM Girls  have the gift that keeps on giving --  pipin' hot scoop!  And you thought I was going to say something naughty, didn't you? (winks slyly)   Anyhoo :  Owen Wilson  is the stud of the moment, according to the 3AM Girls, and, I think, the beautiful  urlLink Jen Chung  (heart flutters), who  urlLink goes on about him in Gothamist . At the UK premier of  Starsky and Hutch , Wilson made like it was the 70s all over again at London's nightclub  Trap , and wound up "inviting a dozen girls back to his hotel to continue the party."  urlLink Keep on truckin', big man   Then,  urlLink as the 3AM Girls note , things took a rather sinister turn:  "... Although Owen was the centre of attention at the bash, it was a different story the night before, when he visited lapdancing club  urlLink Sophisticats  and tried to make a move on a blonde dancer named  Crystal .  "Owen soon found his fame had little effect on the object of his affection. In fact, her furious husband called us to name and shame Owen for breaking the club's 'no touching' rules.  "'Owen beckoned her over and asked for a dance, and, at first, he just seemed to be enjoying himself like any other punter,' the hubby told us.  "'But then he started trying to chat her up and asked if she wanted to come to the premiere.'  "The sexy strumpet laughed off his advances but Owen didn't take the hint ..."   The Corsair  plays sinister crime-reality shjoe "reinactment music." *shivers*  "'He started touching her, putting his hands on her bottom,' continued her angry hubby, who asked to remain nameless. She stood up and told him:  'No, no, no! You're not allowed to touch me - that's against the rules .' He wasn't happy about the rejection.  "'He got in a sulk, paid for the dance and stormed out."  "That must have been a disappointment for his companions for the evening, (Ben)  Stiller  and comedian  Steve Coogan .  "'He's just lucky he got to walk out, if security had seen him he'd have been thrown out - and if I'd been there, I'd have knocked him out,' added our outraged spouse.  "We're sure the babes he met at (the  Starsky and Hutch ) bash more than made up for his embarrassment."  Oh Owen, what would  urlLink J.C.  say about your boorish behavior?

       Barbara Streisand: "Mother Focker"!    urlLink According to Reuters , Babs Streisand, everyone's favorite egocentric diva, is in final negotiations to play  Ben Stiller's  mom in the sequel to the wildly popular "Meet The Parents:"    "The sequel, 'Meet the Fockers,' is set to go into production April 5 with  Jay Roach  back as director. The film is slated for release on Dec. 22, the studio spokesman said.   " ... Stiller starred in the original box office hit film as accident-prone male nurse Greg Focker, who goes through hell when he visits the childhood home of his intended fiance,  Pam Byrnes  to meet her mother and father (played by  Robert Deniro ) an overly protective former CIA agent with a lie-detector in the basement. Greg ultimately wins them over.   "In the sequel, a clash of cultures ensues when the straight-laced, conservative Byrnes family meets the liberal, relaxed Fockers."  Didn't we all know all along that Barbara Streisand was a  Mother Focker ?

       Neil Strauss Dumps The Old Grey Lady    urlLink Gred Lindsay of WWD  informs us that  Neil Strauss  is giving  The Old Grey Lady  the old  heave 'ho , and it's probably better for all involved in that sordid mess. He'd been doing a three way with Old Lady and  Jenna Jameson , but something had to give way, in the , uhm,  end . And when it's a choice between and  Old Grey Lady  and a  Young Blonde Starlet , *snaps* well,  you know how 'tis . Lindsay explains:  " urlLink Neil Strauss , the music critic who signed up to ghostwrite porn star  Jenna Jameson’s  memoirs without telling his superiors first, is leaving the paper to work on his book projects. 'Neil has resigned, and I have regretfully accepted his resignation,' said cultural news editor  Steve Erlanger .   "While Erlanger insisted that the Jameson affair hadn’t come between them, it is certainly hard to imagine the Times tolerating the (fully clothed) cameo in Jameson’s next film that Strauss was reportedly considering. Strauss will theoretically continue to write for the Times as a freelancer, but not regularly, and his critic’s slot will be filled. 'He made the choice to concentrate on these larger projects,' Erlanger said in a telephone interview."  Affair? Coming between them?  Larger projects ? Why not call a spade a spade Erlanger, Strauss is pursuing  urlLink larger "assets ," if ya nah whatta mean.  Silicon enhanced  assets, cornbread.  Lindsay continues:  "Besides Jameson’s book, entitled  urlLink 'How to Make Love Like a Porn Star ,' Strauss is writing another book based on his January first-person piece on being tutored in the art of picking up women. Columbia Pictures has already bought the film rights for the low six figures."   Hmmm . I wonder how Strauss decided to leave the Times:    INT. NY TIMES HEADQUARTERS RESTROOM. DAY    REPORTER NEILL STRAUSS  TO NO ONE IN PARTICULAR  Boy, Man, that Old Grey Boss Lady takes good care of my sorry ass. How cool is that?  And older women are insatiable, you can't go wrong. She's okay and East Coast respectable and all that, but I'm a  wild and innocent youth . I need to sow my oats with some tighter flesh. I wish I could find someone younger. The Old Gray Lady, she's just a little bit country, and I'm a little bit rock and roll ... (sighs)   JENNA JAMESON ENTERS IN PINK SHORT SHORTS   I think I took a wrong turn somewhere. This is such a big building.   STRAUSS   Nah, honey, you took the  right turn    JENNA   Oh  dear , I can't believe I got lost in  the men's room . Can you help me get to HarperCollins?

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  Penelope Cruz . According to  Ted Casablancas ,  Penelope Cruz  either is or is not still going out with  Tom Cruise  (thanks Teddy). Whatever the case, Cruz is reeling over yesterday's disgusting terrorist attacks in Spain. According to  urlLink Rush and Molloy :  "'She's very upset about it,' her rep told us yesterday. 'Penelope is in Rome, promoting her movie  Don't Move . She's been on the phone with friends and family, making sure they're all okay. We think everyone is safe.'"   Out :  Britney Murphy . Okay, is it just me or is there something really, really scary about those big haunting brown eyes of Britney Murphy, peering out from that gigantic little old lady head.  I didn't want to say this out loud, but she really creeps me out,  she harshes on my mellow . Apparently my instincts were correct.  urlLink Jeannette Walls writes :  "Some reporters got more than they bargained for when they tried to interview Brittany Murphy at a recent junket.   "(Murphy) ... was in the U.K. promoting her new flick, 'Uptown Girl,' when she shocked journalists with what one source describes as 'really erratic behavior.' At one point, Murphy lay down on the floor, declared that she was tired of everyone looking at her, and put a napkin on her face. She also reportedly grabbed a reporter’s hand, told her she looked cold, clasped and rubbed it, until the flummoxed journalist asked Murphy to release her hand so she could write. One TV crew left in despair, according to a report, after failing to get an interview because Murphy kept bursting into song rather than answer questions.  "Murphy’s rep initially denied the reports, calling them 'ridiculous' and telling  The Scoop  that she was with the star throughout the junket. When pressed, however, she conceded that she was outside the room for some of the interviews. 'Brittany’s just a really sweet person,' the spokeswoman told The Scoop. 'You know how some people have that wall built? She’s very warm and welcoming. She’s an outgoing person. She’s not one of those people who sits there cold in a chair.'”  Freak!    In :  Patrick Swayze . He's so in he was never out; Patrick Swayze is the new black:  he's like the wind .   urlLink According to Fashion Wire Daily , "For a few excitable patrons of Miami’s Soho Lounge this past Saturday night, the eventual question of the evening was 'Where is Patrick Swayze now?' Seemingly the most absurd celebrity sighting possible at the Revolver party, a weekly indie rock and dance party in the hip but quiet Design District neighborhood, it nonetheless inspired a handful of clubgoers to traipse through various rooms inside the club in search of the famous actor."  Seriously, though, lets all rally together to reignite Swayze's career. Then, maybe, we can do a little  something-something  for "The Gute"  Steve Gutenberg .   Out : Crack is out. Way out. Don't you listen to Whitney Houston? (sotto voce)  Crack is wack.  Apparently  urlLink 96 year old Julia Roberts  wasn't listening to Whitney's aria. Oh, no: and look what happened. The senior, born  February 3, 1908 , at the turn of the century, back when horse drawn buggies sped across the landscape, "was busted Monday along with a few younger relatives/cohorts for running a drug operation out of her home." The guys at smokinggun work hard for their money, and we never treat them right.   In :  urlLink Editor and Publisher . The guys at Editor and Publisher, Greg Mitchell in particular, really got out and grabbed the Jayson Blair story. They asked the tough questions of Blair, of the media, and of the people who were supposed to be tough, but ended up soft --  Chris Matthews ,  Bill O'Rielly ,  Larry King .  Editor and Publisher had a strong hard week of media reporting, enjoy the weekend, you deserve it.   Out :  urlLink John McCain as Kerry's running mate . How many times did the poor guy have to denounce that rumor? He did it on  Stephanopouos , guys. And yet all week the whisper became audible chatter became shouting and, finally, yesterday, the  Republican  Senator of Arizona put an end to the speculation. Just like he  already  did on Sunday on Stephanopoulos.

       Ted Casablancas and Casablanketyblank    Nobody does it better . Ah, the art of saying nothing tantalizingly, that is the peculiar art that is performed daily online by E! television's  Ted Casablancas . Sometimes  urlLink E! Online gossip Ted Casablancas  is very hard to understand, is all I'm saying ... and that is precisely how he likes to play his game; the harder it is do decipher what I call  Casablanketyblank , the harder it is to figure out  The Awful Truth : that Teddy's online column is a very  thin gruel  indeed, with little in the form of tasty scoop.    Teddy Casablancas  speaks a strange language all his own, one part LA -- or, as he calls it "Hell A", and one part  just plain wierd . He speaks in a breathy tone of familiar first names, suggesting insider knowledge, drawing you in, holding your attention with the surnames, making you cool by implication because you are hip enough to  Tom  and  Nic  and  Cameron  and  Justin  and  Charlize . Then, when he has our rapt attention, our cool by implication shared gaze, Teddy spins us left and right, dropping a snarky hint, and then, just as quickly, withdrawing it, covering his ass by taking  the devil's advocate position  and, before you know it, you know exactly as much about the stars as when you did when you began reading his column, that fruitless task once perceived as so rewarding.   In the following snatch of  Casablanketyblank , I think Teddy's saying that  Tom Cruise  and  Nicole Kidman's  people are on the way to some brokered "get together." Either that, or Tom and Nicole do not want to get back together. You see what I mean:  how fucked up his game is ? Seriously Teddy, have you ever considered a career at the State Department? The UN? Cause, you've got skillz man:   " Tom  and  Penélope , according to  Camp Nicole , are having troubles of their own that have nothing to do with their amorous feelings--or lack thereof, perhaps--for each other. Further clandestine chitchat led me to the following conclusion:  "I think we have another  Justin-Cameron  sitch on our hands. In other words, some members of Nicole's inner circle are so against Ms. K. reuniting with Mr. C. that I'd bet the hookup never takes place. It's that contentious.  "Similar sorry sitches occur between Just 'n' Cam, as I've alerted you previously.  "And before everybody starts bemoaning the above couple's expected split, just remember:  Paris 'n' Nick  rose again like the Phoenician fun-lovers they are, right? Okay, maybe it was just a little minispark, but you get the detracting drift, I'm sure."   I'm sure

       Jaco has KFC for every Lunch and Dinner!   Apparently  Michael Jackson  can't get enough of the Colonel's secret recipe. Private jet time is KFC time for the famously reclusive star. According to  urlLink Ananova :   "Jackson demands the  urlLink Colonel's KFC original chicken breasts  to go with mashed potato, corn and biscuits with spray butter, according to travel documents seized by police.  "According to  urlLink The Evening Standard  the records are from a chartered flight on September 1 last year carrying Jackson, a cousin, lawyer, nanny and three children.  "The singer's food and drink preferences are listed for himself, nanny and children. He has additional food available at breakfast such as fruit, scrambled eggs, lox (smoked salmon) and bagels, but lunch and dinner remains solely the Colonel's domain.  "However, the document adds: 'If travelling for a number of consecutive days, will try other forms of chicken but still would like the KFC.' However, the newspaper says the star's young children, Prince and Paris, have a much stricter diet. They are forbidden peanut butter, sugar, chocolate and chicken skin.  "Toddler  Prince Michael II  is reportedly always fed by his nanny,  Grace , and he also gets KFC - cut up into pieces - in addition to crackers, grapes and juice or milk.  "Jackson rarely eats pudding. The document adds: 'Will ask for a sundae one out of 10 times you fly with him.' He also bans 'broccoli and strong-scented food'.  Read the rest  urlLink here . Okay, let's recap:  1) Although Jacko's breakfast includes fruit, scrambled eggs, lox and bagels, his lunch and dinner are exclusively KFC.  2) 'If travelling for a number of consecutive days, (Jacko) will try other forms of chicken but still would like the KFC.'   3)  Prince  and  Paris , have a much stricter diet. They are forbidden peanut butter, sugar, chocolate and chicken skin. (scratches head at chicken skin and the psychological implications)  4) Toddler  Prince Michael II  (the writer tries not to crack up) gets KFC cut into strips, crackers, grapes and juice or milk.  5) Jackson rarely eats pudding.  Jesus Christ what a freak! I can understand the KFC and the chicken skin, but no  urlLink Yorkshire Pudding  with the bacon drippings? For  shame!   Actually, this all reminds me of my January 6, 2004 blog on Trump that throws light on why Jacko was nervous visiting a swishy restaurant with trump (of course! no KFC!):  Everyone's favorite follicle-challenged short fingered vulgarian has an interesting story in his book  urlLink Trump: The Art of the Comeback , which could just as easily have been called the art of the  urlLink weave .   Anyhoo : The Donald sayeth:  One of my most interesting Mar-a-Lago experiences involved the turmoil over  Michael Jackson  and  Lisa Marie Presley . Michael was a friend of mine and a very good guy-- but very different. It began in New York, when I got a call from him one day, saying he would be coming to the city and would like to get together. He often called to say hello when he came to New York. This time I invited him out to Le Cirque, one of the great restaurants of New York, headed by a master, Siro Maccioni. (Michael) was very nervous about going to a restaurant; in fact, he said, he hadn't been to a restaurant in years. I found this hard to believe, but after we arrived, I could see it was true.  "This was in the early 90s, at the height of the Michael Jackson madness, and I don't believe I have ever seen a star as hot as Michael was at that time. When Michael, Marla, and I walked into Le Cirque, some of the biggest people in the universe were seated having dinner. These people who have seen it all. They are rich, they are spoiled and they are snooty. I will never forget as Michael sat down in his red military outfit with a large black hat and picked up the menu. It was as if he had never seen a menu before, and we carefully went over each item. But what was most amazing were the looks on the faces of the most distinguished people in the room as they came over to our table practically begging for an autograph.  "These are people who have never asked for anyones autograph before and I can guarantee you, it was not easy for them to do. They would always start by saying, I have a son who is abig fan of yours, Mr. Jackson. Could you give him an autograph? But I believe it was for them, not their sons. One woman, one of the most socially prominent women in New York, known for her attitude, approached our table, trying to look cool, then slightly tripped. She grabbed the table for support and asked in the same breath, 'Mr.Jackson can I have your autograph?' It was amazing to see this woman, who I have known for years, so flustered and nervous."

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  Jennifer Garner . As  urlLink Medialife  reports, " 'Alias' star  Jennifer Garner  has made the switch from playing a spy on television to recruiting spies for the CIA. Garner will be featured in a video on the agency’s employment web site. The CIA chose her to represent its organization because, as stated on the CIA web site, the character she plays embodies the integrity, patriotism and intelligence the CIA searches for when recruiting." Now, Garner may be a slice o' heavenly yellow cake and all, but what's her game? You'll remember that Garner also hosted the  urlLink Scientific and Technical Awards  on Feb. 14 at the Ritz Carlton Huntington Hotel in Pasadena. Is she angling to leverage the geek stalker material position currently left vacant by  urlLink Gillian Anderson . Or maybe it is an elaborate plot to get her own  Star Trek  show.   Out :  Ron Galotti . I've fucked with Galotti majorly in my little media blog, but I'm sad to see him go.  urlLink Keith Kelly reports , " Ron Galotti , the real-life 'Mr. Big' who was played by actor  Chris Noth  in 'Sex and the City,' is selling everything and leaving Gotham.   "'I bought the farm,' he told  Media Ink . His new home will be a 100-acre farm in Pomfret, Vt., just outside of Woodstock.   "The departure of one of the most important publishers in the business over two decades comes six months after his stormy departure - the third in his career- from glitzy, glamorous  Conde Nast , where he was most recently publisher of  GQ .   "The 55-year-old former executive says he looks back fondly but has no intention to return. 'I've had a great run, I wouldn't change a thing,' he said." Oh Ron, now who will we bitchslap when it's a slow week?    In :  Anderson Cooper  is in, very, very in.  Ben Affleck , whose career is in a serious nose dive, was quoted giving a nasty remark to the  urlLink always excellent Rush and Molloy . "Asked why (Affleck)  urlLink went on the Howard Stern  show in December, Affleck quips: 'With Howard, you know what you're getting. It's not CNN, where there's some snide p- named  urlLink Anderson Cooper  pretending to do real news."  Cooper this week also earned high praise from Our fearless Leader,  urlLink Choire Sicha , class president of the blogger set, in the  urlLink salmon colored pages of The Observer,  saying, among other things, "At a time when cable news is a cesspool of partisan shit-stirring, rehashed war feed and cheery, white-toothed weatherman smiles, Mr. Cooper distinctly stands out. He’s turning out to be something even more unexpected—and much more compelling—than the Gen-X sex symbol/anchor of his do-me CNN marketing: the return of the TV journalist as humanist." You go, Anderson.    Out :  urlLink OneWorld Magazine . That glossy tribute to Russ' ego is capt. No more loving interviews and cover features on the boss' wife, the absurd  Kimora Simmons . According to  urlLink Rush and Molloy , "(Russell) Simmons ... had some bad news on the publishing front. His OneWorld magazine has folded. The nine-year-old mag about hip-hop culture was said to be having serious financial problems. Simmons blamed the shutdown on the departure of publisher  John Pasmore , adding that 'we plan to relaunch OneWorld in the near future.'" No, please don't Russell.   In :  urlLink Emptyhanded.com  via  urlLink Two-Twenty.net  via  urlLink TMFTML .  James Allenspach  is an evil genius. Jesus on the cross, listening to --? I'd guess Norah Jones, cause Jesus had that "in touch with his feminine side" flow about him.   Out : The Practice. Apparently, this will be news to all seven people who still watch this show, but  Nellie Andreeva  of  urlLink The Hollywood Reporter reports  that the show is done. " David E. Kelley's  Emmy-winning legal drama 'The Practice' will bow out May 16 after eight seasons.   "The final episodes of the ABC show will set up a spinoff series, which has been given a 22-episode order by the network for the fall." I don't think I have ever watched a single episode of this show.   In : The Colorado Senate race will be the most closely watched and competetive in, perhaps, the nation's history. As  urlLink Peter Savodnik writes in The Hill , "Rep.  Bob Beauprez  (R-Colo.) is in the middle of a classic political dilemma: The White House is urging him to run for the seat held by  urlLink Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell  (R-Colo.) while House Republican leaders are pressing him to hold on to the seat he narrowly won in 2002."  Actually, Beauprez "spent more than $1.8 million to eke out a 121-vote victory." In other words, if he runs for the Senate, the Democrats will pick it up faster than  Colin Farrell  at a Playboy Mansion party. And the Senate race is just as hot in this battleground for power in the capitol of the world's last standing superpower. Rumored to be thinking of a run is philosopher king  urlLink Gary Hart . State  urlLink Attorney General Ken Salazar  and software entrepreneur  urlLink Rutt Bridges , who is expected to spend $10 million on the race, have all already announced their candidacies.  urlLink Rep. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) pulled out, and, on the Republican side, rising star  urlLink Tom Tancredo , who has made a name for himself in Republican power circles by an  intense  anti-immigration platform (he's to the right of Pat Buchanan if such a space exists).   Out :  Jude Law , neatfreak. According to that  urlLink significant cultural artifact Star Magazine , Jude Law is a neatfreak. They write, "Jude Law is telling friends he's so frustrated with his girlfriend, Alfie co-star  urlLink Sienna Miller , 21, he wants to break up. The reason? Seems Jude has a lot in common with Felix Ungar from The Odd Couple -- obsessed with order and cleanliness. A source says the 31-year-old can't stand the fact that Sienna is so completely disorganized. 'Jude lines up the shoes in his wardrobe, arranges his clothes according to color. He keeps all the papers on his desk neatly stacked and his pencils sharpened. He also freaks out if there's anything in the fridge that's beyond the sell-by date.'  "Apparently, Jude was just as anal-retentive with his ex-wife,  Sadie Frost , 35, and their three children. 'He was annoyed if the kids left finger marks on the walls, or if the living room was strewn with toys," the source says. "Sadie was always trying to get the house as clean as possible for him, but Jude was complaining to her that it looked untidy.'  "According to the source, Sienna is ultra flighty. 'She loses her cell phone, forgets appointments, and constantly spills the contents of her purse.' Friends say that Jude can't believe he's dating someone more scatterbrained than Sadie, so he wants out -- with plans to dump Sienna right after the Oscars, according to the source."  Wait, didn't Sienna pose for Maxim in her panties? And Jude thought he was dating a  urlLink Mesopotamian scholar ?   In : Sexy camera phone pics. Once again,  urlLink Drew Barrymore  is ahead of the curve. Ananova reports, "The Charlie's Angels star was seen taking the saucy snaps in lingerie store,  Victoria's Secret , reports  urlLink Teen Hollywood .  "The actress was apparently sending the sexy pictures to her rock star boyfriend,  urlLink Fabrizio Moretti of The Strokes .  "A friend of the actress is quoted as saying: 'The camera phone was a birthday gift and she was bursting to try it out.  "'She and a girlfriend were snapping away in Victoria's Secret and were sending the raunchy photos to Fabrizio to see which outfit took his fancy.'"

       It's Only Hollywood, Baby   " urlLink Alan Pakula  once told me one of the truest stories I have ever heard about film journalists."  " When  urlLink Sophie's Choice  was coming out, one of the news magazines sent a writer to do a major feature on me. He came to my office to do the interview, and, during it, he told me about a script he had written. He just happened to have it with him and he gave it to me.  "Three days later, he called me and asked me if I had a chance to read his script yet. He told me that he was in the middle of writing his profile about me.  "I knew what he was doing: he was shaking me down. While he was in the middle of writing this profile of me which would be read by millions of people, he was asking me what I thought of his script.  ""I told him that I'd been very busy, but hoped to read his script that weekend -- which I knew was past his deadline for submitting my profile.  "'Oh,' he said, sounding disappointed, 'I was hoping you'd have it read before then.'  "I thought about it. A favorable profile in a magazine with that kind of mega-circulation would certainly help the movie. I was worried about Sophie's box office anyway.  urlLink The subject matter itself  would scare some people off.   "I called him back and told him that I'd finished reading his script and loved it. I told him that I wanted to produce it -- not direct it, but produce it like I had produced other movies earlier in my career.  "'Oh,' he said, sounding disappointed, 'I was hoping you would direct it."  "I called him back the next morning and told him I thought about it some more. I told him I liked the script so much I wanted to  direct  it. As my next movie.  "There was a pause and he said 'I hear you're an honorable man. Do I have your word on that?'  "'Absolutely, ' I said to him, 'I give you my word. You've written a brilliant script.'  ";Thank you,' he said, 'this is probably the greatest moment of my life. By the way, I think you are going to like the profile I am writing."  "We made plans to get together in a week -- way past his deadline -- to celebrate.   "When the profile came out, it was long, glowing, and flattering and I'm sure it helped the movie's success."  "He called me after the article came out and he kept calling me for days, but I wouldn't take his calls."  "He sent me an anonymous note in the mail, but I have no doubt it came from him.  "All it said was 'You fucked me masterfully. I applaud you. I deserved it.'"   Joe Eszterhas ,  urlLink Hollywood Animal , p.117-18

       Our Man Chalabi    urlLink After the devastating 60 Minutes piece  deconstructed Chalabi, the pile on begins in DC. And no, Chalabi was  not  the white guy on The White Shadow (now that you mention it,  TV Land  should do a retro, no?). Ahmed Chalabi, according to  urlLink Fred Kaplan of Slate , is an egomaniac. And worse. He writes, "What is going on with Ahmad Chalabi? The Iraqi exile, MIT-trained mathematician, and wealthy businessman who plotted with high-level U.S. officials to return to Baghdad and grab the reins in a post-Saddam government—to bring to his homeland the virtues of modernization and Western-style democracy—has now joined forces with Iraq's most prominent anti-American theocrats."  The conservatives also have misgivings about Chalabi. According to  urlLink Arnaud de Borchgrave of the Washington Times :  "(Chalabi) controlled and supervised the appointment of no fewer than six key players, including three ministers — the oil minister, the finance minister, the trade minister, the central bank governor, the head of the trade bank and the managing director of Iraq's largest commercial bank.   "With this kind of power base, Mr. Chalabi's next steps were predictably familiar. They are deja vu ad nauseam in other parts of the developing world. He has placed relatives and cronies in key slots in the new bureaucracy. Promissory contracts totaling some $400 million for Iraqi reconstruction projects have been allocated to Middle Eastern and American business friends.   "On June 30, when chief U.S. Administrator  L. Paul Bremer  and his colleagues on the coalition's provisional authority go out of business, and  Mr. Chalabi  and his fellow Governing Council members recover full sovereignty on Iraq's behalf (pending elections in 2005), the long-time president of the Iraqi National Congress (INC) in exile, will be in the financial driver's seat."  Way to go, Neocons.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  Heidi Klum  and  Seal . Beauty and talent go well together, and, since  urlLink the marvelous Page Sixers  have deemed this stellar coupling acceptable,  why shouldn't we?   urlLink The National Enquirer's Patricia Shipp gives us a step-by-step :  "The two were spotted enjoying a cozy dinner at  Madeo , a restaurant in Los Angeles on February 22.  "'It was obvious that they've fallen hard for each other,' disclosed an observer.  "'After dinner at Madeo's, Heidi and Seal went to Seal's home in the Hollywood Hills where they spent the night.  "'The next morning they emerged from the house, and she gave him a kiss before they drove to a nearby  Starbucks  for morning coffee.  "'When Seal went inside to get coffee for the two of them, Heidi walked her dog, a cute Jack Russell terrier.  "'Seal and Heidi laughed and whispered to one another while they sipped their coffee outside.'  "Soon the two had to part as Heidi headed off to catch a plane.  "'Heidi kissed Seal once again, told him she loved him and thanked him for being so wonderful,' said the observer.  "'As she left in an SUV, Heidi turned to Seal and said, See you very soon, darling!"  "'Seal adores Heidi,' confided the insider."  Awww.  You go, Seal.    Out :  Paul Wolfowitz . As  urlLink the Hill reports , "Tensions between the Bush administration and House Republican leaders flared last week when Deputy Secretary of Defense  Paul Wolfowitz  angered them by arguing that reducing President Bush's proposed defense spending would be an unpatriotic slap at the military. " Okay,  Mr. Philosopher-King , angering members of Congress in your own party? That's not a good thing, Paul, even  urlLink Plotinus  would say, don't you think?   In :  Lucy Sykes . is she shallow? Yes. But  oddly compelling .  urlLink FashionWeekDaily  does a day in the life of Mrs. Sykes, and it is  fascinating :  "8:00 pm - The YSL show. I arrived to find my friends  Charlotte Stockdale  and  Amanda Moore  across the runway from me, both predictably chic, as well as every fashionista that ever there was. Tonight's the night.  Veruschka  the ?60s model,  Patrick Demarchelier ,  Bill Cunningham  (we all adore him).  If you weren't there, well: sorry babe.   Harvey W , of course: there's something going on. Stella, of course. The show was pure  Tom . Tailored with such precision. Just looking at it, you felt you'd cut yourself. Beautiful, delicate hints of chinoiserie. I am watching fashion history. At then end, as Tom walked down the runway, he was so focused. No one sat. The whole crowd was screaming. Tom wore a red smoking jacket. For a moment, I thought that he might walk past the photographers at end of runway, and we'd never see him again. When he turned to walk back, my heart pounded. He's the man who brought sex back to fashion. I fought my way through the crowd to congratulate him afterwards my heart pounding still, and when he said, calmly 'Oh yes, Lucy Sykes' I died and went to heaven.  Tom Ford  is my  YSL . As I walked out, I asked my favorite fashion oracle,  Marylou Luther , 'Isn't he the most devastating man in fashion?'  'Of course,' said Marylou, 'apart from one other. 'Who?' I asked. ' urlLink Euan ,' she answered, and disappeared into the night. What has my husband been doing to these women? Tom was so in control, he had a yogic calm. As SJP said, 'Why leave the party when it's already gotten bad? Leave when it's still buzzing.'? Note the touch of shallow french existentialism that hangs about the comment made before a modish disappearance into the night. It could easily have been a snatch of dialogue from  urlLink Last Tango in Paris . Lucy is as pretty as an  urlLink Akkadian bass relief  (and as deep). Let's train our social microscope on the specimen. Have you observed it closely. Good; carry on.   Out :  Evan Bayh . For some bizarre reason, the youthful Senator from Indiana got tremendous buzz this week as a possible running mate for Kerry. That would be a bad idea.  urlLink The photogenic Senator  is about as exciting as a wheat field in August. Or, as  urlLink Arianna Huffington  says in her syndicated column, "Don't pick a VP by looking at the map. Pick someone who can help you bring soul back to American politics and appeal not just to our self-interest but to our better instincts. In other words, do not pick  Evan Bayh ." I couldn't have said it better myself.   In : Nader Cynicism. Sometimes I don't know whether to get really angry at Ralph Nader, or just kind of pity him as a stubborn old man nearing senility laced with bitter pessimism. I mean, in the  urlLink Village Voice's Nader interview , he does the strangest thing. Really odd, because Nader's attention span is legendary. When asked "Whom do you like?" he starts of civil, then veers -- almost immediately -- into the avenue of The Darkness, leaving us asking:  This is who you Like ? He answers:   " Edwards , although he's no courageous champion. He didn't make one speech defending the civil justice system, which is his forte. So that tells you somethingÃ&#130;&#151;it is under massive attack by about 10 bills in Congress. Also, on foreign relations and military, he's terrible."   That some real thug love, Ralph!   Out : The exercisee Move of the Month.  urlLink Greg Lindsay of WWD  has a good time reporting of the crazy goings on at YM. "Now, several sources close to ( urlLink YM ) said (Editor in Chief Linda)  Fears  is spooking the staff by making a slew of last-minute changes to the May issue, which will bear neither her nor (former editor in chief Christina)  KellyÃ&#130;&#146;s  name. The diary, news and college sections Ã&#130;&#151; all Kelly favorites Ã&#130;&#151; have already been cut, and even more frightening to them is FearsÃ&#130;&#146; first big idea: a new health section featuring an 'Exercise Move of the Month.' For a staff reared on KellyÃ&#130;&#146;s let-the-advertisers-be-damned approach, itÃ&#130;&#146;s causing shudders all around." Shudders, people,  shudders .      In :  Michael Musto  of the  Village Voice  always gets the scoop.  urlLink This week he writes  of his trip to Miami at  Jade : "By the antipasto tables, I asked  MICHAEL IMPERIOLI  how the show's changed his life, and before he could answer, he was interrupted by a stampede of fans and well-wishers. 'That's how it's changed my life,' he said, beaming. His views on gay marriage? 'That's a no-brainer,' said Imperioli. 'If people love each other, they should be able to get married.' And so should  LIZA  and  DAVID , and  BRITNEY  and  JASON , and even  DREW BARRYMORE  and  TOM GREEN ."

       Michael Gross Blacklisted?! Oh, Hell no!     The Corsair  likes  Michael Gross , in fact, we consider him an acquaintance/friend, exchanging emails over the years on media and career matters. So when I read  urlLink Lloyd Grove's account  that  Michael Gross  may be blacklisted because of his incendiary but  fair   urlLink account of Ralph Lauren's life , the red flags went up. Grove writes:  "One New York fashionista is wondering whether the devil wears Polo.   "Writer Michael Gross claims he's been blacklisted by major glossy magazines since his unauthorized book, Genuine Authentic:  The Real Life of Ralph Lauren , which just came out in paperback, first appeared.   "Gross, a former News columnist, said one 'top fashion magazine editor' recently told him that he shouldn't expect to get work from big-name magazines for a long time. 'He said I was radioactive - for 200 million reasons,' the writer added.  "A Ralph Lauren spokeswoman replied that any suggestion the company was putting pressure on magazines not to use Gross was 'completely untrue.'  Well, I certainly hope so, spokeswoman for  Ralph Lauren , for your sake and the sake of your employer, because  The Corsair  is in the mood for some media attention for being loud and I am also in the mood to pick a new punching toy. Things have been slow going, and what better way to spice up the blogosphere than start a war with a comapny messing with my buddy. (puffs out chest) I'm old school like that.

       Al Sharpton to Get Fox TV Show?    urlLink Presidential candidate Al Sharpton  may get his own Fox Tv Show,  urlLink according to the New York Times .   Jim Rutenberg  of the Times  urlLink writes :  "Mr. Sharpton, who retained the  urlLink William Morris talent agency  two weeks ago, said he wanted to be the host of his own cable news and radio programs, and his talent representatives said they were pursuing talks with all conceivable outlets.  "But, perhaps unsurprisingly for a man who is running for president, Mr. Sharpton's media ambitions do not stop there. He has already had an informal discussion with Fox Television Studios about a possible reality television show, officials there said on Friday. And he recently met with  Sid Ganis , the Hollywood producer who included Mr. Sharpton in the 2002 remake of 'Mr. Deeds,' to discuss future roles.  "'For months they were saying to me from various parts of the media world that they wanted me to do a syndicated radio show, a syndicated TV show, and now these guys with a reality show,' Mr. Sharpton said. 'I said I wanted to wait for the end of the campaign. Now that we're halfway through, I told William Morris to go and complete some deals.'''  The William Morris Agency? What the  fuck ? Aint that a bitch: Sharpton goes Hollywood,  huh .  Tucker Carlson  broke the scoop yesterday on  urlLink the Chris Matthews Show  that the Reverend had had a meeting with  Roger Ailes  at Fox. So, I guess his appearance at the Presidential debates was all a big audition. His purpose within the Democratic Party, as a jester and a Shakespearean fool, is over and the Rev is going big time.  Who knew?

       Jann Wenner: "I laugh at that criticism"   On March 5th,  Jann Wenner , editor at  Rolling Stone , defended himself from all the charges in the media that Rolling Stone has sold it's ass cheaper than a trick at the  Tony Soprano's Bada Bing Club . Here is a private portion of his  urlLink Billboard Interview with Carla Hay :   Carla Hay : Others say the magazine has gotten soft. How do you respond?    Jann Wenner : "I think the criticism is bulls--t. I laugh at that criticism."  Disturbing laughter echoes through the blogosphere.  I refer readers to  The Corsair Award , granted December 27, 2003:  "The  Most Irrelevant Magazine  pirate goes to  Rolling Stone . I am of two minds on the subject. First,  May 3, 1998 , to me, was the day the music died. Rolling Stone Magazine, the embodiment of hip counterculture colluded with the Giuliani adminitration as a corporate sponsor for "Family Day" to displace the Million Marijuana March from Washington Square Park.  urlLink No lie .   "Also: putting  April Lavigne  on the cover of March 2003 was a very sad reminder that even though the music has died at Rolling Stone, the stink still lingers like a fucking puddle of stillwater at 1290 Avenue of the Americas."  And the criticism laughs right back at you, Jann, baby.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In : Former US Senator and Presidential Candidate (as well as super-intellectual)  Gary Hart  is odds on favorite to replace  urlLink retiring Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell (R-Colo.)  if he wants the seat. Hart, who recently received a  urlLink PhD in Philosophy at Oxford , has written ably on  urlLink Kierkegaard ,  urlLink Jefferson , and an immensely useful and creative retooling of  urlLink Machiavelli's Prince  for our Democracy called,  urlLink The Patriot , is indeed that.   When he is not writing novels, practicing international law or brushing up on his Russian studies, Gart Hart is at his ranch in Colorado -- like  urlLink a philosopher king  -- observing the decline of Western Civilization. Run, Gary,  run .   Out :  Dick Cheney . Apparently at  urlLink the Gridiron Dinner, Cheney quipped , according to Hillnews,  "I always feel a genuine bond whenever I see Senator Clinton. She's the only person who's the center of more conspiracy theories than I am." Yeah, uhm, did you hear the one about Bush replacing you with Giuliani at the NY convention, Soprano-style, Dick?   In : Manley Moonlighting Governors. What is it about the tag team of Ventura and Shwarzenegger ("weighing in at a combined weight of 600 lbs, from parts unknown  The Masked Governators !") First Ventura moonlighted on  urlLink Vince McMahon's gloriously doomed XFL , then, Arnie -- get this -- moonlights as an "editor/predator" at  urlLink ultralowbrow men 18-35 demographic 'Flex' and 'Muscle and Fitness.'  What-the- fuck?!  Will the next Governor of New York be an anchor at  ESPN ? Perhaps the bigger story, as a result of 9/11, is the incredible rise of manliness --  urlLink the Iliad ,  urlLink Alexander the Great flic , HBO's wild west manly tale  urlLink Tombstone , Gibson's bloody Christ who takes his licks like a man. It's a man's world, it seems, though we'd like to see some Grrl power in the mix.   Out : Liberals. Ever since  Bush the Elder  trounced  Mike Dukakis  for being a card carrying member, it has not been cool to be lib. Now, however, even Ralph Nader can barely conceal his contempt when he utters the words, "liberal intelligencia" to refer to his opponents on his right, who have asked him to not run for president. You know life sucks for libs when Nader is hating on you.   Being called a liberal is like being called weak and human beings -- especially in this adenoidal era -- regard weakness as Evil. Good and Evil are irrelevant: all that exists is Strong and Weak. Being Strong is better than being Good; being Strong is better than being Just; Being strong is better than being Smart. And Being Liberal, alas, is not perceived as being strong.    In :  Ken Auletta . Auletta is a class act, and he showed an incredible amount of patience on  Tina Brown's Topic A  last night, sandwiched in between the seriously stupid  Kinky Friedman  cadidate for Governor of Texas ("to hell with corporations!", the matronly  Susan Cheever  ("I don't care who runs Disney, just as long as they keep making movies that keep my kids quiet") and  Rocco Landesman , who made facile points about the shocking -- shocking! -- anti CEO climate.   In that mix of stupidity, Auletta shone, stating facts and figures as well as reasoned arguments about Disney. Way to go, Ken; then again,  what was Tina thinking?    Out :  urlLink C-SPAN Delay . After 25 years,  Howard Stern's  band of merry pranksters is causing C-Span CEO  Brian Lamb  to consider adding a pause to live phone discussions. Not that I watch those call in shows that offer elderly retirees a chance to rant ad nauseum in shrill, semi-senile disembodied voices about the Illuminati's hold over our government, and the good old days of  "Cal" Coolidge , but this is a sad testament to the fact that we -- America -- are no longer young.   IN :  Kurt Andersen . Anderson writes in this week's  urlLink New York :  "One has the friends one has, and one doesn’t tend to choose them carefully. I wouldn’t call myself a friend of  Martha Stewart’s , but I know her. A few years ago, during a coffee break at a technology conference, we had a pleasant conversation about public radio and—this was the best—the excellence of the steamed-milk froth on our free Starbucks lattes. A few years before that, she had invited me to a large dinner party at Nobu where  Sam Waksal  was present. (At that dinner, I happened to exchange a friendly glance with  Calvin Klein , whom I had met exactly once before, but who nevertheless acted in that moment as if we were good friends, mouthing the words “Are you okay?” from across the room, since a few weeks earlier I had been fired as the editor of this magazine.)"  urlLink Did he mention Latrell ?

       Al Franken: Democratic Party Bouncer   From time to time  Al Franken  likes to kick  urlLink a little bit o' Ass  --  Republican ass , playa. The other day he used just  urlLink the right mix of hard power and soft power,  so to speak, in a short term domestic conflagration. Didn't you know that Howard Dean's  aggro  speeches would one day cause some kind of ruckus on the left hand side?  urlLink The New York Times Magazine (subscription required) captures the frenzied mood surrounding Al Franken's rather "punchy" ass-whipping of a confused protester at a  Howard Dean  campign rally with the appropriate amount of gusto.   But let me set a little ambiance for you , cornbread, cause that's the sorrt of thing Bloggers like to do. (plays  urlLink Europe's The Final Countdown ) It is "the Sunday before the nation's first primary," at a  Howard Dean  rally in downtown Manchester. The New England winter is crisp; the mood is one of fighting back. The Republicans have been eating the lunch of the Democratic Party since  Ca-lee-fohrn-eeaaah , and the midterm elections and, of course, the Supreme's 5/4 dance number that handed the Bushies the keys to the White House.   Anyhoo : Our man on the scene, the NY Times writer, one  Russell Shorto , feels it important for us to know -- at the outset -- that Franken's tushy is the stuff of the Gods, ambrosial,  a hasty pudding  if you will:  "From 1966 to 1969, Franken was a member of the varsity wrestling team at his high school in Hopkins, Minn. Six years after graduation, when he showed up in New York to begin work as a writer on the first season of  urlLink 'Saturday Night Live ,' he was still almost as much an athlete as a comedian. ''He seemed like a total jock,'' says the comedian  urlLink Laraine Newman , who was a member of the original cast. 'He always had a football in his hands when they were writing. And he had this very defined musculature. His butt was like a cut basketball. Which, you know, you don't normally see in comedy writers.'"  No, no, one doesn't,  Mr. Shorto , to be sure; but  The Corsair's  former girlfriends don't complain, we are in our early 30s after all  is all I'm saying .    Anyhoo : Let's bring on the rassling. Now for a spot of the old rough and tumble,  Harvard-style  --- bring-it-on!:  "Onstage,  Martin Sheen  speaks first, then Dean's demure wife, then the suddenly embattled former governor of Vermont himself. Sometime after Dean begins taking questions from the audience, a manic-looking heckler starts to heckle, accusing Dean of 'covering up for  Dick Cheney .' He gets louder. A couple of spindly members of Dean's security team approach him uncertainly; he swings his arms and keeps shouting. It goes on for several minutes and seems to be veering toward actual violence. Dean, the media, the members of the audience: nobody knows what to do."  Oh, but our man Franken does,  does he ever  (wicked Rumsfeldian gleam in eyes):  "At this moment Franken turns, cocks his head slightly, gives that well-known magnified, tortoise-shell-framed gaze and says: 'I think the two of us can get him out. You wanna do it?' After a pause that is meant to be emphatic, I say, 'No.' But it's too late: he's off, in rumpled jeans and a big down jacket, plowing up the aisle."   Al Franken's  old school like that. When he cocked his head you just knew:  it was on like Gray Poupon .  The Corsair  imagines the Harvard educated simian, rumpled jeans and big brown jacket ruffling in the wind, the accoustical sounds of  urlLink Six Million Dollar Man bionic  sound effects stacattoing in the background ( da-da-da-da-da  ...) as Franken-in-slow-motion-bolt approaches said interruptor, head low and spectacles fogged in anticipation of crunk:  "By this time there is a confused scrum around the heckler, who is holding his ground and still ranting. Franken hits the floor, wedges himself among a couple dozen legs and puts the man in a wrestling hold, grabbing him at the knees."   Oof!  One can almost buckle at the beauty of the writing at this  New York Times  sports section style commentary, like that unfortunate freak, tumbling down the slippery slope into Prose Heaven. Oh,  tell us more :  "That destabilizes him, and others now quickly push him down the aisle and out the side door of the theater."  Oh Al, destabilize the GOP;  destabilize !:  "Franken gets up, looking dazed; his glasses are snapped in two. He's quickly swarmed by confused but excited reporters who want to know, like, what was he doing?"  He's kicking ass and taking names, gentlemen,  Harvard-style . Snapped spectacles be damned! The Democrats are mad as hell and  urlLink they're not gonna take it .  Read the rest of the  urlLink NY Times profile .  Way to go, Big Man; at the upcoming Boston Dem convention, Big Al will be taking on a  urlLink Larouchie with a weak knee .

       Bomshell 60 Minutes: Bush Planed to Bomb Iraq Before Afghanistan!    CBS  is running teasers for a  urlLink 60 Minutes  that looks to be brimming with zest, so those wily liberals Martha's Vinyard Way will, no doubt, be hoisting some rather indifferent red wines to their pagan gods come Memorial Day. Let the pounding begin:  the liberals are mad as hell and they are not going to take it anymore . Apparently, one  urlLink Richard Clarke , who has advised four presidents (and was  Bill Clinton's  counter-terror point man in the  National Security Council ), throws light upon the current administration's reaction to terrorism in his new book, " urlLink Against All Enemies ."   Oh,  It's on like Gray Poupon!  (rubs hands together)  The  60 Minutes  website teaser reads:  "Former White House terrorism advisor  urlLink Richard Clarke  tells  Correspondent Lesley Stahl  that on Sept. 11, 2001, and the day after - when it was clear al Qaeda had carried out the terrorist attacks - the Bush administration was considering bombing Iraq in retaliation.   " ... Clarke was surprised that the attention of administration officials was turning toward Iraq when he expected the focus to be on  al Qaeda  and  Osama bin Laden .   "'They were talking about Iraq on 9/11. They were talking about it on 9/12,' says Clarke.   "The top counter-terrorism advisor, Clarke was briefing the highest government officials, including  President Bush  and Secretary of  Defense Donald Rumsfeld , in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks.   "'Rumsfeld was saying we needed to bomb Iraq ... We all said,  but no, no. Al Qaeda is in Afghanistan , recounts Clarke, and Rumsfeld said,  There aren't any good targets in Afghanistan and there are lots of good targets in Iraq . I said,  Well, there are lots of good targets in lots of places, but Iraq had nothing to do with [the September 11 attacks] .'"  (The Corsair takes a sip of  urlLink The Cutty Sark ) Ahhh ... The pause that refreshes.    Anyhoo : The CBS site continues:   "Clarke goes on to explain what he believes was the reason for the focus on Iraq.   "'I think they wanted to believe that there was a connection [between Iraq and al Qaeda], but the CIA was sitting there, the FBI was sitting there, I was sitting there, saying,  We've looked at this issue for years. For years we've looked and there's just no connection,  says Clarke.   "Clarke also tells Stahl that the president isn't doing the best job fighting terrorism.   “'Frankly, I find it outrageous that the president is running for re-election on the grounds that he’s done such great things about terrorism,' says Clarke in Sunday's interview. 'He ignored it. He ignored terrorism for months, when maybe we could have done something to stop 9/11. Maybe. We’ll never know."  Maybe; but here's what we do know: one, Clarke is hawking a book, and, like  urlLink Paul O'Neill  before him, he will be savaged by the Right. Two, Clarke is damaged goods: he bet the farm on cyberterrorism being the next frontier, and  he lost big time .  His job and his credibility were burned  in the intelligence community. This book makes him look vengeful. Three, they will try to paint Leslie Stahl, a fucking excellent journalist, as obsessed with getting Bush.  Mitigating factors: One, this will feed into the New York Left Media nexus. Howard Stern has been beating at Bush mightily. Expect Stern to use the 60 Minutes as an extended discussion on corruptions in the Bush Administration. Expect the New York Times editorial board and op ed columnists to follow suit. And expect Kerry and some congressmen -- perhaps even, hmmmmmm  John McCain  -- to get involved, making the President look bad. Hmmm: John McCain may end up being the big winner of this  60 Minutes  drop off into Spring. And the race for the President of the last standing superpower has barely begun!  Finally, concerning CBS, a fascinating little chestnut if you are a media geek like me has been revealed. Apparently  urlLink Eisnehower asked then CBS President Frank Stanton to run a a federal communications agency  in the event that a Soviet military attack killed major US officials. This was in the dark days of the Cold War when the Soviets had successfully launched  Sputnik ,  e4ffectively beating America into space, and savaging national morale. Dark Days indeed:  "A few weeks after the Soviets launched the first manmade satellite in 1957, shattering America's sense of security,  urlLink CBS President Frank Stanton  was summoned to the White House to see President Eisenhower.   "Stanton knew his friend was agonizing over how to respond to Sputnik and the terrorizing thought that permeated America: Had the Soviets gained a huge first-strike advantage in the nuclear arms race?   "But Stanton learned  urlLink Eisenhower  also was wrestling with how best to ensure the U.S. government could function if a Soviet attack wiped out many American leaders.   "Stanton, who had no experience or ambitions in government, was taken aback when the president asked if he would be willing to oversee a federal communications agency after such an attack.   "'I was surprised and startled by the breadth of the assignment,' said the 96-year-old Stanton, who lives in Boston.   "Nervous about the awesome task of keeping the nation's telephone, radio and television systems operating after an attack, Stanton said he nevertheless 'agreed to do my chore.'"    Crazy.  CBS and the Preidency.

       Plum Sykes Strikes Out: Aaron Gell in W Magazine   From  Aaron Gell's  review of  urlLink Plum Sykes' Bergdorf Blondes , from the  urlLink April 2004 W :  "Fashionista-cum-muckraker  Plum Sykes , who apparently spent years researching her novel  Bergdorf Blondes  ( Miramax Books ) by going deep undercover as a glamorous It Girl. The story is told in the voice of a shallow, narcissistic features writer for a major fashion magazine -- a voice Sykes nails with uncanny verisimilitude. Unfortunately, while she name drops all the requisite labels, like the crack fashion caption writer that she once was, the plot she hangs them on is thinner than a  urlLink Louboutin heel , and nowhere near as sturdy. It centers on the breakup of the heroines' engagement (her moody beau is said to be a stand-in for Sykes' former fiance,  Damian Loeb ) and her subsequent quest for another PH (prospective husband) who has his very own PJ (private jet)."   Charmed, I'm sure.   This  Andrew Gell  can write. His snark is pure.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  Nakedness  in general.  urlLink Today on Ananova ,  we learn, via  The Sun , superhottie  Carmen Electra  reveals that she plays drums naked with her husband, the bloated  urlLink angel from another dimension   urlLink Dave Navarro , "We jam together - he plays guitar and I drum and we even play naked."   urlLink Yesterday on Ananova , via  Jane , it was revealed that  Daryl Hannah  also likes to be naked -- when jogging, "Basically, we're all apes, right? I like to be unfettered whenever possible - if it's a beautiful day.  "It's not like I throw off my clothes and start running out of control," she told  Jane magazine .  Call me cynical ("cynical!"), but do these frisky revelations come a little too close to their projects,  urlLink Starsky and Hutch  and  urlLink Till Death do us Part  for Electra, and  urlLink Kill Bill, Volume II  for Hannah?  Whatever the case, Nudity: it's the new black.   Out :  Lenny Kravitz . For his new and pretentiously titled album (whispers) " urlLink Baptism ," Lenny steals  urlLink Prince's look  finally completing a process of leeching off the creative energies of his better that has been ongoing for about a decade.   There has always been a strange hero worship thing going on, unrequited, from Lenny to Prince, ever since  urlLink Kravitz borrowed the royal falsetto  on his first album 'Let Love Rule.'    The heavy influence, or, as  Harold Bloom  might pronounce it,  urlLink the anxiety of influence  that Prince exerts over Kravitz has finally broken the proverbial camel's back.   Somewhere  Nicole Kidman  is laughing at  urlLink Kravitz's bad processed hair and cheesy sunglasses worn indoors .   In : Taking Potshots at Actors.  Snark  seeps it's way into the  strangest places , like mainstream publications such as the ultranice  urlLink People Magazine , of all places. In their Picks and Pans section they pan Taking Lives, the new Angelina Jolie flic. Note the snarky little slice at Ethan Hawke in the last line, tossed off, as it were, as if it was an aside penned by  Uma Thurman :  "Jolie, whose lips are monumental enough to serve as a weopon in her own right, strides through as if she learned all she knows from Angie Dickinson on Police Woman. Hawke, even when trying to project good-guy appeal as an art dealer helping to ID a suspect, gives off a weasel scent."     What-the-fuck?!    Out : Malnourished Milan runway model tushes.  urlLink Like Johnny Depp, I am partial to high water booty .  urlLink Butt Lifter Jeans . A girl with an ass is  so very in  (excuse the pun on the bum). Finally, after years of  Howard Stern  feeding the self consciousness of women and their hind quarters, the  BET  sensibility is winning out, to the consternation of the Long Island contracters crowd. Men want  urlLink a curvy ass, like Monica Bellucci's , which is enough to make a grown man cry.  urlLink Buttock implant surgery  is also big, thanks to JLo. Voluptuousness.   In : And speaking of an  urlLink ample tushy, Athina Roussel , nee  Athina Onaissis , and her polo boytoy  Alvaro Alfonso de Miranda , or, "Doda," are very in. Also the dad of the richest little girl in the world, Thierry Roussel, had some good news on February 20:  "An Athens court yesterday cleared the father of  Athina Onassis ,  Thierry Roussel , and the former Roussel family spokesman  urlLink Alexis Mantheakis  of perjury charges. The trial followed a suit lodged by Onassis Foundation President  urlLink Stelios Papadimitriou , who had been accused of slandering Roussel. Papadimitrou told the court yesterday that he had never maintained that Roussel took drugs or acted lewdly in front of his daughter."   Out : Beating around the bush. Career challenged  Amanda de Cadenet   urlLink wanted her multimillionaire former boyfriend Keanu Reeves back , so she took the initiative, and (allegedly) concoted an offer he couldn't refuse.   According to  urlLink W :  "KEANU REEVES is back with former fiancee  urlLink AMANDA DE CADENET  thanks to an 11-year-old cupid. The pair rekindled their romance after the Matrix star  was asked to attend a school play starring  urlLink Amanda's  daughter ATLANTA.  'If it weren't for Atlanta playing cupid Keanu and Amanda would have  remained friends, but have gone their separate ways,' confesses a source.  'She has helped them fall in love again.'"  In 1995 the huntress stalked her prey, holding an  urlLink impromptu Keanu Film Festival with Courtney Love, one evening . One year later, they were going out. But then they broke up. And things hadn't been the same since.  And (wink, wink) out of the blue (wink, wink), the prococious eleven year old  Atlanta  calls Keanu and asks him to attend her school function (wink, wink), "why don't you go with my mommy." (wink, wink)  I saw  urlLink The Parent Trap , and it makes a clever Disney movie, but I refuse to believe than any child other than those born in France are that socially sophisticated to engineer that kind of romantic mojo.   Well, we can't playa hate, Amanda did good for herself.

       Courtney Love at Bowery Ballroom   I'm hung over, I've got a bit of a cold, it was packed, but I enjoyed last night's show of  urlLink Court Love at the Bowery Ballroom . She came on late, like almost two hours late, but that's to be expected. Courtney's singing sucked, except for "Voices Carry," which I thought was beautiful in it's own twisted/haunted way. But one doesn't go to a Court Love performance nowadays -- or at least last night -- to hear the music. We wanted to be a part of the drama.  urlLink Gawker had this link of Courtney getting her boob sucked  outside of  Wendy's  in New York Wednesday, thanks  urlLink Gawker (you'll not that the booby sucker is reading the  Village Voice , which at no point in time leaves his hands when providing said ministrations; a discriminating counterculturalist he).   Anyhoo: what can I say, I went there more for the spectacle and maybe to see her in panties and I was not disappointed, although I wish I was closer to the stage, the Bowery Ballroom was packed ( Ethan Hawke  and  David Blaine , Kurt Loder and the MTV crew,  Debbie Harry , Soprano star  Little Steven , among others, were there) and spacious.  Honorary black man  urlLink Roger Friedman at Fox 411 reports  that NY Daily news photog  urlLink Dara Kushner  was hurt when Court crowdsurfed.   And the  NY Post   urlLink sums it all up :  "Before the show she quieted the audience and told them, 'If any of you plans on getting injured tonight, please go outside and get arrested now.'   "She struggled through her set, at one point saying, 'My voice has gone to hell. That's what a jail cell does to it.'  "During one song she stripped off her red velvet dress and sang in her bra and panties. She then covered up with a T-shirt that read 'Eat My F-.'"   (Update: Oh la vida loca,  urlLink Courtney is at it again , playing to the cameras, her whole life on film; via Gawker via   urlLink BluBox , Court is playing guitar outside a window in NYC basking in the attention.  Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down thy skanky hair ...)

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  Cypress Hill . An excerpt from their interview in the  urlLink April 2004 FHM . Only a rock star can get away with smoking weed past the age of 30 and not look like a silly punk ass:   FHM : You worked with  Bob Marley's son Damian  on "Smoke it Up" for the new album. What's his bud like?   Muggs : It's the Schwarzenegger of weed. It's scientifically genetically enhanced marijuana to the 10th power. He went toke for toke with us. When it comes to ganga, he's got pedigree, but we've got  ghetto lungs . We're used to blunts and shwag weed.   B-Real : We're all mellow dudes.   FHM : Do you like to garden?   Muggs : B-Real created his own marijuana called Kush. That's the one-hitter quitter, homey:  hydroponic steroided up .    Do you like to garden . Who came up with these questions?   Out :  The Ladykillers  gets a bad review from  urlLink The Hollywood Reporter , which says:  "( Tom) Hanks'  mere presence will, of course, deliver a solid opening weekend. And the brothers' faithful fans might find enough things to like to sustain a decent boxoffice performance thereafter, especially among older audiences.  "The premise remains the same. Once more, a professor with dubious credentials rents a room from an unsuspecting old lady. He and his cronies, all claiming to be musicians, use the house as a base of operations to commit a nefarious criminal deed. Once more, however, circumstances and the old lady foil them at every turn.  "Only instead of the English suburbs,  the Coens  take us deep into the Southern Bible Belt.  Professor G.H. Dorr  (Hanks) rents a room from a black Baptist churchgoing lady named Marva Munson ( Irma P. Hall ), who will allow neither 'hippity-hop' music nor smoking in her domicile. With the cover of practicing medieval instruments in her basement, Dorr and his gang tunnel from that basement for several blocks to the cash storage office of a riverboat gambling casino.  "The crew Dorr assembles gives new meaning to the expression 'thick as thieves.'  Marlon Wayans' Gawain MacSam  is the casino 'inside' man, whose temper and foul mouth just naturally invite catastrophe, not to mention slaps by Mrs. Munson."  Hmmm,  actually that sounds kind of fun to me . And who ever thought  Tom Hanks  and  Marlon Wayans  would ever make a film together. Next thing you're going to tell me fucking  Spielberg  will helm the next  Carrot Top  flic.   In :  urlLink National Review editor Rich Lowry versus radio personality Al Franken in Spinsanity  debate.  urlLink The conservative New Criterion blog  discusses it thusly:  "There is some good in this. Franken devotees, who probably have never read  National Review , will tune in expecting their man to triumph. What they will find is a middle-aged schoolyard bully. Franken claims to have challenged Lowry to a 'fight in [his] parking garage,' and then slyly questions Lowry's heterosexuality."   urlLink Franken  claims:  "Rich said on C-SPAN that Democrats had sissified politics; I challenged him to a fight in my parking garage; he demurred like a little girl; I wrote about the incident honestly in my book; he wrote a column that gave his readers a totally misleading characterization of my book, which he later admitted he hadn’t read; I challenged Rich to another fight; he demurred again, but challenged me to a contest of ideas. So here we are."  Can you say mid-life crisis? Can you say slow news day?   Out : That fake bottled "pure mineral" water Dassani is urlLink  very very out . Jonathan Prynn of the Evening Standard writes:  "Coca-Cola today recalled every bottle of its controversial "pure" mineral water Dasani in a cancer scare.   "It came after the 95p bottles of water were found to be contaminated with illegal levels of bromate, a potentially cancer causing chemical.   " Coca-Cola  said all 500,000 bottles of the carbonated water, which is drawn from public water ( ed note : tap water) supplies in Sidcup, will be cleared from stores within 24 hours."  The thing that really freaks me out about this?  urlLink Dasani is the second top selling bottled water brand in the US . How the fuck does a multinational corporation make fucking million, possibly billions, on bottled water. And why isn't any news team really hammering Coke on their smoke and mirrors. Oh, I guess it is because Coke is a major advertiser on just about everything.  Sweet.    In :  urlLink This is really and truly the most offensive and perverse stories  I have ever read online, and that is saying something. Please do not read this if you are at work, it is just that twisted. I cannot say any more, except that I will pray to the redeeming lord Jesus on behalf of the teller of  urlLink this  story.   Out :  Condoleeza Rice  becomes another of the pretty politicians that  Rupert Murdoch  collects, like Newt Gingrich and Baroness Maggie Thatcher, when she speaks at his little  urlLink conference . The Guardian writes:  "The four-day event started last night, and Mr Howard is due to speak at 9pm tonight (British time). Ms Rice, President Bush's national security advisor, is to address the conference by video link."   Great.    In :  Bushmeat.  Just what is  urlLink bushmeat ? And no, it is not some pornographic reference to our Commander-in-Chief. Perish the thought. Bushmeat is the practice of eating primates, mostly by impoverished populations. In addition to leading towards the extinction of whole species of monkeys and apes, the  urlLink Nature Science update  writes, "The practice of hunting and eating bushmeat in Central Africa is infecting people with a new virus."  As a Ugandan-born writer I'd like to register my shock at this practice of noshing on cute monkeys, although I don't quite know what precisely was in that "dirty water hot dog" I ate at lunch in Midtown this afternoon. I could be a hypocrite on this matter.

       The C-Span Jones   Have you ever had a (makes quote gestures into the air) " urlLink love jones "? (looks around, embarassed) I know I've had. But have you ever had a (makes quote gestures again) "C-Span Jones"?  Good : that makes you psychologically healthy. No normal person would have a  C-Span Jones ; no normal person should have a C-Span Jones. Normal people don't write philosophical discorse on  Brian Lamb's  even temperament and boundless curiosity over the arcana of just whom  James Knox Polk  was "polking."  urlLink Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post  gives us the symptoms, which, alas, were diagnosed in her own little ditty called "Confessions of a C-Span Junkie":  "A  urlLink C-SPAN  story, embarrassing but true: I climbed on the treadmill at the gym the other morning, clicked the channels of the attached TV down to the C-SPAN zone and was delighted -- honest! -- to find the  urlLink Senate Budget Committee  marking up the fiscal 2005 budget resolution. Still more embarrassing: It wasn't even live, but a replay of a session the day before. Unfortunately, by the time I finished my paltry few miles, the majority staff director had barely begun his presentation. So I stood on the motionless treadmill to watch the rest of the proceedings until, finally, I felt so self-conscious that I turned it up to a slow walk.   "Mine is admittedly an extreme case. You know you've got it bad when that day's segment of the  urlLink Lyndon Johnson tapes  is one you've heard before. Or when you don't watch just the hearing but are glued to the cinema verite footage of all the milling around before and after. Or when you find the Senate quorum call, with its accompanying classical music, a relaxing interlude -- what passes for a Zen moment in Washington.   "In our house, C-SPAN is a family affair. I began to suspect that  urlLink C-SPAN radio  was playing a little too often in our car when I was out with my 8-year-old daughter listening to -- what else -- the  urlLink Florida Democratic Party winter meeting , and I realized that she could identify all the presidential candidates. By voice. The year before, she became so captivated by the  Senate Judiciary Committee  debate on the  Charles Pickering  nomination that she woke up the next morning demanding to know how the vote had gone on 'that judge guy.'"    Oh dear sweet jesus , why did this woman have to involve her child in her madness? (takes a sip of  Cutty Sark  ) ... ah, the pause that refreshes.  Was there a need to turn to C-Span radio? Are there not enough useless C-Span channels -- how about C-Span 3, the segment of our drama when we follow the " urlLink C-Span bus " around theb country to visit the birthplaces of the Presidents! Oh dear-sweet-jesus ...   Anyhoo : It's not going to be smooth going for this baby, I want to let you know right now.  A C-Span Jones  is not to be tossed aside lightly, my dear friend, it must be  cast off with great force ! But sure, it will be tough sailing: that inescapable craving of counting  yeas  and  nays  for cloture before leaving the house on a date will creep up the spine, like a monkey on the back. The delirium tremens that accompanies missing a think tank meeting of  urlLink the Cato Institute  on the reform of Social Security will be acute, like the sharp burn of a crack pipe against ready fingers. And, of course, the jones at rushing to see a  riveting  interview with the latest biographer of  Millard Fillmore ; ahh, not unlike the chemically-bubblegummy smell of exhaled crystal meth ...  priceless .   C-Span is like crack, only more addictive, more sinister, and pipeless --  Ruth Marcus  of the Washington Post hath wrought some awesome shit, what?  Introducing her baby to a life of geeky political junkiness, adrift in the wilderness of Omnibus Transportation Committee hearings. Your bad, Ruthie; you're very very bad.

       Hey Graydon, where are the African Americans?   Several years back I altogether stopped sending out my annual "Letter to the Editor" email criticizing  Vanity Fair  for the lack of African Americans, especially on the cover, and especially in their 'Hollywood issue.' It was a futile quest to get someone to listen and actually do something more than send out an obligatory response to reader email backed up with naught else but hot air. I saved this little chestnut, though, I think it was my last attempt at satisfaction, from the long suffering and saintly  Heather Fink , dated April 24, 2000:  "Dear Mr. Mwangaguhunga,  "Thank you very much for your letter to the editor. We have received  several letters regarding this matter, and I will be sure to address this point  with the appropriate editors here. I appreciate your input and hope that you  continue expressing your opinions to Vanity Fair.  Sincerely,  Heather Fink"   Greeeaaat.  I'm glad I shared.  Of course, my problem is not with  Heather Fink , who was polite, but couldn't change the situation, no, my issue was with her boss  Graydon Carter , who I snark on from time to time in this blog, but for whom I ultimately hold no hard feelings against. Look -- there is no one suggesting that anything is wrong with Graydon on the issue of race,  that's crazy talk . I'm just saying that Graydon is not representing African Americans on the cover of VF; and that smarts. It is his privilege as an editor, but it is a kind of stupid thing for a so-called libertarian to do to his legacy. Hollywood itself is not as white as Graydon paints it.  I just cannot believe that  urlLink Matthew McConaughey  and  urlLink Gretchen Moll  deserve covers more than  Chris Rock ,  Chris Tucker ,  Halle Berry  or even  Janet Jackson .  I mean --  Fuck!  -- even  urlLink Sandra Bullock , she of the linebackerish looks -- got a cover!  The argument that nobody would ever make in public is that covers of African Americans sell less than covers of white celebs:  Ruben Stoddard  was the worst selling RS cover in 2003, and  Serena Williams  the  urlLink worst selling SI cover in 2003 . But  urlLink last year's best/worst cover list  is closing the gap of this very sad but true industry fact. I've worked in magazines for 9 years, I know the game.  But  urlLink Roger Friedman of Fox 411  who I knighted an honorary black man on Monday does a fine job in explaining why VF was snubbed by the National Magazine Awards:  "'It's because Graydon's so obsessed with Hollywood,' said one insider, referring to Carter's sometimes embarrassing preference for celebrity profiles over actual journalism.   " Beth Kseniak , director of public relations for Vanity Fair, said, 'I can't remember when we didn't have a nomination. But we've been very fortunate in previous years and we congratulate the nominees.'   "One aspect of criticism about Vanity Fair is its obliviousness to cultures other than its own. In the March 'Hollywood' issue, 13 famous actresses graced the cover, not one of them African-American. As well, Vanity Fair has not featured an individual black person on the cover in several years.   "Kseniak responded, 'We were supposed to have  Halle Berry , but she backed out at the last minute.'"  Okay VF, now is your opportunity.  The African American contribution to the entertainment industry in America and the world is vast. Could you refelect that just a little bit more?

       A Little of the Old In And Out    In :  Kerry  and  McCain  are  urlLink Still Fucking With The President . I swear to God, it looks like Kerry and McCain met at his campaign bunker, and decided -- just for the hell of it -- to play jedi mind tricks on the President. Today, McCain  urlLink sticks up for Kerry on Defense , AP reports, "Asked on NBC's 'Today' if he thought Kerry was weak on defense, McCain said: 'No, I do not believe that he is, quote, weak on defense. He's responsible for his voting record, as we are all responsible for our records, and he'll have to explain it. But, no, I do not believe that he is necessarily weak on defense." Geez. Will someone get McCain and Kerry a room already?    Out :  urlLink Kelly Ripa cameltoe , (via  urlLink Stereogum  via  urlLink Nick Catchdubs )   In :  urlLink Star Magazine's Victoria Gotti reporting  on the breakup of mob wife actress  Edie Falco  and  Stanley Tucci.    Victoria Gotti writes, "'They're not together,' Tucci's spokesman, confirmed to  Star . But  Star  has learned the backstory behind the breakup. 'Edie says they split because Stanley felt guilty about leaving his wife and their kids,' a friend of the HBO mob mom tells Star exclusively. The couple paired up both onstage and off while co-starring in the 2002 Broadway play,  Frankie and Johnny in the Claire de Lune , in which they appeared in the buff for five months.  "Right around that time, Tucci's seven-year marriage to Kate, with whom he has two children, came to an end. But now, Tucci (whose next project is 2004's The Terminal) may be heading back to the homestead: 'They'd been fighting about how much Stanley was spending time with his family,' the source reveals to Star. A few weeks ago, Tucci spent the whole day with his wife and kids in Central Park, the source adds. According to the source, he was supposed to meet Falco at chic Italian eatery Da Silvano that night, but instead dined with his wife. Falco was not happy and gave Tucci an ultimatum: 'Her or me.' A few days later, we're told, he told Edie, with whom he was living that it was over."  Poor Carm ...  men!   Ironically, Victoria Gotti, daughter to mobster  John Gotti , also dumped her husband after he was found -- through racketeering wiretaps -- to be sleeping with his bookkeeper.  Gotti and Falco have quite a bit in common.    Out :  Dirty but beautiful . That's how a snitch describes the relationship of  urlLink just released from police custody  (link via  urlLink Gothamist )  Courtney Love  and  Chris Milk  to  urlLink Rush and Molloy :  "The duo met on the set of her video for 'Mono,' but evidence of their liaison did not surface until Love accidentally left her BlackBerry at a restaurant in December.  "Someone saw these really juicy, poetically pornographic things going back and forth between them," says our snitch.  'They were dirty, but beautiful . Just a sign of how much she loves him and how much he loves her." Courtney is a mess.   In : Running away from Kerry? According to  urlLink Hans Nichols of The Hill , "A handful of ( ed note : Southern and Midwestern)House Democrats who look vulnerable in November’s election, plan to run away from their party’s presumptive presidential nominee, Sen.  John Kerry  (D-Mass.), and will not endorse him.  "The holdouts are a minority of the 17 'frontliners' selected by the party leadership for member-to-member cash infusions, but their attitude reflects varying levels of comfort with how the New England senator will play in their districts."   And the really odd thing is, that Bush and Kerry  are in a statistical dead  heat right now.

       Quien es Mas Negro?    urlLink Quien es mas macho ? That's  so  over. We want to know which  whigro  is more black!  Quien es mas negro ,  silver dollar . The blacker the berry the sweeter the Jesus Juice, nah mean.  Theoretically, if we let our combatants loose on 125th street, which one would bring back the  hydro , and which one would bring back  oregano . And the categories of our little crunked up game are:   Directorial alter ego :   urlLink Ingmar Bergman  had  urlLink Max Von Sydow ,  urlLink Fellini  had  urlLink Marchello Mastroianni  -- you get the jist. Which specimen of black manliness does our little whigro idealize himself as?   Celebrity Urban Pals:   Significant others. Peeps.   Street Cred:   Nothing says wigger like the accoutrements of a thuggernaut. Ghetto fabulosity is priceless.   Afro-Asiatic Connects :  The revolution will not be televised. When the Afro-Asiatic connect happens,  you better recognize . When the black muslims with the funny outfits hook up with the martial artists and the Asian tiger economies, we're gonna find out once and for all whose world is this.  Now , what have the combatants done to further this cause?  And our contestants this week are two fine specimens of "the whigro,"  urlLink Quentin Tarantino , and  urlLink Brett Ratner , who "grew up in Miami Beach, the only child of a famous Jewish socialite," according to IMDb. Let's get ready to rumble:   Directorial alter ego :  Quentin, I mean  urlLink QT , has  urlLink Sam Jackson    Brett Ratner , the Rat, has  urlLink Chris Tucker  ... no contest.  Winner:  QT    Pals:    QT  has  urlLink Pam Grier   The Rat has  urlLink Russell Simmons and his new girl Serena Williams . Not to mention the rumored  Naomi Campbell  fling.   Winner : The Rat. We love us our Pam Grier, but we don't thing she hangs with QT once the cameras are off and the paycheck has been signed. Rat directed hip hop videos, for gods sake, how black is that?   Street Cred:    QT  once posed for  Bikini Magazine  with a 22 ouncer of malt liquor.  The Rat is  urlLink fucking Serena Williams . Enough said.   Winner : No contest, hands down, The Rat. Now, if QT had been shown pouring out some of his urban concoction for "the dead Homies," that would be a serious mitigating factor. And it would have to be a 40 ouncer. 22's are for pussies, QT, come on, act like you know.  Bish .   Afro-Asiatic Connects :  QT has  Kill Bill , which has  urlLink Vernita Green , who dies rather quick for our tastes, frankly.   The Rat  has  The Rush Hour  franchise, speeding up the day when the African and the Asian will clasp hands in a deadly kung fu grip thus putting the kibosh on The New World Order ... or at least that's what my friend  Pookie  from Uptown says.   Quien es mas Negro?    Brett Ratner . He's old school like that.

       The Ubiquity of Jack Shafer   Where did Slate's  urlLink Jack Shafer  come from (link via the very cool  urlLink Gawker )? All of a sudden Shafer is all over the media like  urlLink The New York Times' RW Apple  on a cheesecake! Is he a  urlLink Raelian clone ? Has there ever been  urlLink a more ambitious  and successful online media personality covering the media? How does he do it? Every day this man figures out an angle to get him injected onto the media landscape. And boy, are we  jealous ! (And you thought the green eyed monster was the post-St. Patty's Day hangover)  Since  The Corsair  is so very bored with  David Brooks ( zzzz ), we are now going to turn our attention to a media persona worth our snarky level gaze. So, without further ado, we inaugurate  Shafer Watch  (which is like  urlLink Baywatch  without all those meaningful jiggles):   Thursday March 11 : "Publishes"  urlLink tirade against our pals Gawker and Wonkette on Slate , "The Heaving Pukes Who Write Gawker and Wonkette."  Upside : Gains attention from Poynter.org, which is important. And the Wonkette-Gawker reprisal means greater exposure.  Downside : Reprisal?  Payback  is a bitch, Shafer; payback (sotto voce)  is a bitch . Performance:  B    Sunday :  New York Times Book Review , bashes Jayson Blair, for the umpteenth time, on behalf of all journalists, in the  urlLink Old Gray Lady .   Upside : The last word on the media story of the year.  Downside : By Sunday, March 13th, Shafer was a little behind the curve, no? Performance:  B Minus.    Thursday : Apparently he wasn't the last word. Apparently,  urlLink more needed to be said about Jayson Blair . "I played a small role in the Blair aggrandizement with a negative review of Burning Down in the March 14 New York Times Book Review." Really, Jack? Thanks for the disclosure, seeing as no one who reads your Slate piece would otherwise be aware.  Upside : More media attention.  Downside : Looks like you are stretching it  a little bit thin , Shafer, especially when you have to rely on this sort of thing: "Allowing  Jayson Blair  to judge the ethics of a writer—or publication—is a little like green-lighting  Joseph Mengele  to lead a malpractice investigation of Marcus Welby." Let's leave Mengele out of this, Jack, and while you're at it  ...  we liked   urlLink Marcus Welby . Performance:  C plus.   Who knows what Jack Shafer will do next, but we can count on one thing: it will be covered by the media. But we don't playa hate here (shifts uncomfortably in seat) ... okay, maybe we do, but -- you -- don't playa hate,  congratulate . And Jack Shafer is worthy of the kudos, he has somehow become as big a story as the people he covers in the media.  Tell us how to do it, Jack ...

       A little of the Old In and Out    In :  Rem Koolhaas . Fancy yourself being an architect named  Rem Koolhaas  -- the world is your oyster, for you are  Rem  -- and if you do a good job on a project, people say to you, "hey ... cool house, Koolhaas." (silence, soonafter followed by the sound of crickets gently mating)  Okay , admittedly that was a cheap laugh. Perhaps the  urlLink cheapest I have ever stooped to conquer .  urlLink Greg Lindsay brings us up to date  on Rem's life:  "Three years ago, Condé Nast hired architect  Rem Koolhaas  to lend advice to its editors, and up until now, his mug on the cover of Wired last summer was the only outside proof that he’d ever been there at all. But it turns out he’d been busy. Very busy, indeed.   "He and his team had produced a book, for example — a hardcover dictionary containing every word that had ever appeared in Wired, graphed by popularity. Its usefulness in the long run (and whether it was worth the effort) is up for debate, but hey, it looks neat."  Kool and the gang.    Out : The Bush advertorials on the drug bill.  urlLink Roger Ebert in Romenesko's blog today  has a great idea, "If tax dollars paid for those Bush advertorials, shouldn't the government bill the Bush campaign for the production costs?"    In :  Mel Gibson  is having Doubts about  George Bush . According to  the Drudge Report , the Sean Hannity radio show will air an interview with Mel Gibson critical of the President. As  urlLink Drudge reports :  "In the interview, set to air on Tuesday, Gibson says of Bush: 'I am having doubts, of late. It mainly has to do with the weapons [of mass destruction] claims.'  "The surprisingly critical comments from Gibson, a rare conservative voice in Hollywood, come as PASSION continues to dominate the boxoffice."   Wild.  I just love it when  Drudge  does words in ALL CAPS, you just know the Miami heat is getting him all loco in the membrane.   Out : Way out.  Passed  out.  Christian Slater  passed out at a strip club. Remember when that little bastard's entire acting career -- his (makes ironical quote marks into the air) "repertoire" -- hinged on his impersonation of  Jack Nicholson ? Oh how we laughed -- ooh,  la la  -- at his "uncanny mimicry," at his eerily accurate rendering. Hey Hollywood press -- he was a little kid copying his idol, no genius there, you drank his press agent's cool aid on that one.    Anyhoo : these days he's starting to look a lot like  Robert Downey, Jr . According to that significant cultural artifact  urlLink Star Magazine , Slater may be an addict -- an addict of  love , or, at the very least, " urlLink dirty pillows :"   (cues for music,  urlLink Tina Turner's "Private Dancer ")  "At 2:10 p.m. the day after the Oscars, most of Hollywood was still sleeping off the previous night's festivities. But after a long night of partying, 34-year-old  Christian Slater  stumbled out of Los Angeles strip club 4 Play and hailed a cab, according to eyewitnesses. No, Slater hadn't stopped in for the free lunch buffet -- he had been there all night long, according to sources. On Feb. 29, after hitting the  Vanity Fair Oscar party , Slater headed to 4 Play, a club he's patronized before that features all-nude dancers and offers private and secluded V.I.P dances for $20 a pop.  "Slater and a male friend pulled right up to the stage.'He was just like any guy, throwing dollar bills and cheering the girls on,' says one patron.  "After a short time, Slater became smitten with a  4 Play  dancer named  Leah , a 22-year-old buxom brunette whom he asked for a private dance. But by the time Leah finished shaking it on the main stage, Slater was already slumped low in his seat. He stumbled over to a nearby couch and proceeded to pass out for the night (and into the next morning and afternoon) still wearing his suit and sunglasses!"   Graydon Carter  should be offended. Mortified, really. How does Slater top off his Oscar bash? The 4 Play strip club.  Imagine the cheek!    In : Whitney Houston in rehab. Crack ... crack ... crack  is  whack,  Whitney , and good of you to notice.  urlLink Ananova reports :  "Whitney Houston has entered a drug rehabilitation facility, her publicist has said.  "Whitney 'thanks everyone for their support and prayers,' publicist  Nancy Seltzer  said in a statement in Los Angeles. She declined to offer any further details.  "Houston, 40, admitted in a December 2002 programme on ABC television that she had abused drugs in the past, but said she had moved beyond that time through prayer."   The Corsair  wished the Browns best of luck, no snark at all in those sentiments.   Out :  The Jim Lehrer Newshour versus Christian Parenti and Katrina Vanden Heuvel .  urlLink Cynthia Cotts of the Village Voice  gives us the lowdown:   Parenti , author of an upcoming book on occupied Iraq, was being interviewed by NewsHour's  Ray Suarez . He and Middle East history professor  Juan Cole  were analyzing the recent suicide bombings in Iraq and various groups that might have been involved. Then something went terribly wrong: Parenti suggested that Halliburton and Bechtel have failed to provide 'meaningful reconstruction' and that the U.S. occupation might actually be contributing to the instability in Iraq. Lehrer apparently went ballistic."  As a result,  Jim Lehrer  ran on March 4 an "Editor's Note acknowledging the mistake," which read, "For those who were watching two nights ago, a discussion about Iraq ended up not being as balanced as is our standard practice. While unintentional, it was indeed our mistake and we regret it."   And  Katrina Vanden Heuvel's  response? 'We think Christian Parenti's reporting has been thorough and reliable,' she told (Cotts). 'This is a journalist who spent a great deal of time on the ground in Iraq." According to vanden Heuvel, Parenti's comments about the failure of meaningful reconstruction were based on his reporting and firsthand observation.'  Stay tuned for round 2, where Jim Lehrer gives  The Nation   urlLink "the gasface" .    In :  But what I really want to do is Executive Produce .  Kelsey Grammar produces UPN's Girlfriends,  urlLink Sandra Bullock produces George Lopez , Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith will produce All of Us,  urlLink Sylvester Stallone will produce The Contender ,  urlLink Dick Clark produces American Dreams  -- everyone has their own project that they want shepharded. Executive Producing is the new black.  And, in that vein, here's what I wrote way  waay  ahead of the curve on October 31, 2003:  "Whatever happened to just wanting to be a writer and creator of an HBO Show?  That's so  2002.  Okay, fine, there is a certain coolness about  Executive Producing , like, say, the great  Michael Hirschorn  does at VH1 on those X Generation nostalgia shows. Even  Sandra Bulloch  is in on the act with  George Lopez . Then, of course, there are  Courtney Cox and David Arquette  and their design-fashion show. (BTW Was that  Courtney Cox  on the cover of  Town and Country ? Has Cafe Society morphed into the Jet Set? Yes, alas, I trace the exact moment to when  John Travolta  occupied the cover story talking about his gaudy planes and not, say,  Dina Merrill  talking about the roses she grows in  Newport, Rhode Island  or  Harry Bellafonte  on the  Harlem Rennaissance .) And then there was  Graydon Carter's The Kid Stays In The Picture  that started off the madness. First the End of Irony and now Executive Production mania! Do we blame Canada for this? Now, it appears, everyone wants to Executive Produce.  Steven Soderberg of K Street,  etc, etc,  Will and Jada Pinkett Smith ,  Tom Cruise  Executive Produced his ex wife  Nicole Kidman  in The Others and  Rita Wilson  exec produced My Big Fat Greek Wedding. You know what they say: a family that Executive Produces together .... But what happened to wanting to Direct? When did that all of a sudden become uncool? BTW:  urlLink Fellini retrospective at the Guggenheim ; anyone who knows me knows that Mwangaguhunga loves to get his Fellini on."    basta!    Out :  urlLink AdAge talked to Heart's Cathleen Black  on Oprah, their partnership and that spectacularly well selling magazine of hers("Oprah is averaging 950,000 copies a month. It's over a 40% increase over the year before"), and, of course, the inevitable question:   AA : "So what happens to that magazine if  Oprah  gets hit by a bus?"    Ms. Black : "I don't know! Having just celebrated all of her 50th birthday celebrations from Chicago to Santa Barbara, I wish her a fantastic next 50 years, at least, and not just because of our partnership."   Mixed :  Douglas Faneuil . The always excellent  urlLink Michael Musto analyzes Faneuil , and what may become of him:  "As for  Douglas Faneuil , the social set is torn between pegging him as a total rat fink or a noble whistle-blower, but either way, he proved to be the most credible witness, maybe because he clearly had a ghostwriter. ('It intensifies your tactile sensations and emotions,' he testified about Ecstasy.) Faneuil's cleverest move of all was that, in the midst of Team Martha's hope that he'd come off like a ditzy drug queen, he copped to just two Ecstasy uses. ('Say one," you can hear the lawyer strategizing. 'Nah, they'll never believe that.')"  The jusy is out on young Faneuil.   Mixed : Baby Heathcliff.  urlLink Plum Sykes in FashionWireDaily , on her  Juicy Jeans :   “I got three boxes delivered to me the other day; one marked ‘Lucy,’ one ‘Lucy’s husband,’ and one ‘Lucy’s baby.’ Inside was a stash of  Juicy Couture !  Heathcliff , my son, even got two Juicy tracksuits!”     In : You can skip to the next blog here if you want, I won't be hurt, I'm going to get a little geeky here with regards to The Great Books. Oh Lord help me, I love  urlLink The New Criterion's pretentious weblog . What does that say about me? Don't say it out loud; I'm sensitive. Alas:  "For a time it seemed almost like a rite of Spring. As April showers turned to May flowers, protest season arrived at the campus of  Columbia University . But it has been a number of years--not since 1996--that there has been a sizable Columbia protest against its own Core Curriculum, the famous freshman year series of classes designed to bring each undergraduate up to speed on the basics of civilization and those texts formerly known as 'Great Books.' Why not? Have the tenured radicals retired? Oh, no. The reason for the lack of public protest is that there was a backlash to the radicals in '96. The indictments of the Dead White Male fell flat.  David Denby's  book on the Core was a best seller. The Curriculum almost seemed strengthened by the turmoil. So, if you are a radical, what to do?"  Well, how about you throw in  urlLink Dickinson ,  urlLink Woolf ,  urlLink Marie Curie ,  urlLink Confucius  and  urlLink Ralph Ellison  in there and I'm down. The Corsair is a big booster for the Great Books, except when it becomes a "Great Books of Western Civilization" issue, then it becomes a white racial pride issue and you've lost me. Great Books do not belong to any culure but to mankind. And  Marie Curie  and  Sun Tzu  were geniuses in any universe.  My cure for the Great Books debate? Internationalize it, mix in a UN vibe. Oh, and did I say  urlLink The New Criterion weblog  is interesting?

       Best And Worst Selling Magazine Covers   The  urlLink Media Industry Newsletter  just put out their compilation of the best and worst selling magazines -- and,  most importantly ,their covers, which contributed mightily to newsstand sales, for 2003. There are some shockers,  the Economist , for example, that Bible for Machiavellian types, had as it's best selling issue for 2003, with a cover of Virgin Mary ("Bible and Koran"). Who knew?!  And  Jon Stewart  -- poor guy -- was the single worst selling cover for  Entertainment Weekly  on October 31. But EW's Best seller is an odd surprise --  urlLink Sarah Michelle Gellar , giving her exit interview for  Buffy , no doubt. Oh, the teenage girls still have that cover on their walls. We bloggers -- we proud few who heartily blog -- still worship you, in a Buffy-like devotion.  For  Forbes , another shocker, as the Best selling issue was a story called " urlLink Inside Dope  (marijuana leaf on cover)." I guess the "Capitalist Tools" are purchased from the glass counter at the local head shop, no?  And, finally, the  Pauley Walnuts  cover for  TV Guide  was their worst seller for 2003. Fuggedaboudit!  ( ed note : due to work constraints, no blog posts tommorrow. Sorry.)

       Lunch With the Queen    urlLink Alexandra Shulman , the editrix of  urlLink British Vogue , joined the cream of British womanhood  urlLink Women Achievers  who lunched with  Queen Elizabeth  on March 11th.   Shulman writes in  urlLink the Telegraph :  "At midday, the  Victoria Memorial  was surrounded by rows of taxis and chauffeured cars, waiting for access to the large palace courtyard. It looked like an upmarket queue for the cross-Channel ferry and included the same maddening experience of watching a car that seemingly joined later than your own getting ahead. Security was tight, with every car's undercarriage scanned for explosives, and progress was slow.  "Once through the portals, we were given name badges and, surrounded by signs for the Ladies everywhere you looked, were ushered upstairs. We gathered in the sequence of massive staterooms, heated by electric bar fires and looked down upon by the spectacular royal art collection, including  urlLink Vermeers  and  urlLink Van Dykes . Drink was copious - stiff gin and tonics outnumbering glasses of water, orange juice and wine - and, so civilised, smoking was allowed.  " urlLink Baroness Thatcher  stood in the centre of one room, shorter than one would have imagined, in a brilliant fuchsia suit, seemingly in top form and defying rumours of ill health as she tucked into her G&T.  urlLink Cherie Blair , in blue stripes, chatted nearby.  urlLink Zadie Smith  floated around like a beautiful blues singer in a white fur jacket and red silk skirt with flowers in her hair, while  Twiggy  sported a purple tail coat as she chatted to  urlLink Kate Moss  in her vintage blue silk dress."  Sounds yummy.  The Age wrote, "Over sauteed loin of lamb and passionfruit cheesecake, the cream of British womanhood joined the Queen for a historic girls-only lunch to celebrate female achievement."  Also at the gals only affair were the melancholy-eyed  urlLink JK Rowling ,  urlLink Heather Mills-McCartney  and teen diva  urlLink Charlotte Church , were among the 180 powerful attendees.

       Is Roger Friedman Black? Well, now he is.    Usually when I read the  urlLink Foxnews 411  columnist I get a slow and mounting feeling of dread. Why would that harmless, bespectacled Fox entertainment reporter inspire such emo in me? Well,  Roger  (shuffles feet uncomfortably)... Roger ... Raj is just so much more  knowledgeable  about African American culture than I am. He makes me feel like I should go study my black history.  Roger Friedman , ladies and gentlemen,  is blacker than me.   Imagine my anxiety when Roger riffed today about the history of black music. And he even got a little righteous:  "It was  Chuck Barksdale  of  urlLink the Dells  who put it best when he told the audience that his group was accepting for  'The O'Jays ,  the Whispers , and the  Chi-Lites . They're not going to wait 50 years.' The Dells were the only act among the seven inductees who were not allowed to perform two numbers. Even Harrison got two, and he's dead."   The Chi-Lites ?  What the --?   I should know that kind of stuff, but I don't.  My bad . As I said,  Roger Friedman  can be goddamned encyclopedic in his knowledge of black culture when he wants to be. When he is not writing on the  Nation of Islam  or  Jacko , here he is, contemplating African American music-- well, almost too well.    And so , in that manner,  The Corsair  proudly awards  Roger Friedman  the first  Honorary Black Man Award , which confers advanced sexual prowess to the awardee. Who loves ya, baby?

       James Caviezel told JLo to Not Get Nekkid   According to Ananova,  James Caviezel , aka Jesus Christ, didn't want JLo to get nekkid during their steamy love scenes in the stinker  urlLink Angel Eyes . Here is what Ananova says:  " Jim Caviezel  asked  Jennifer Lopez  to put some clothes back on before filming a raunchy sex scene with her.  "The actor, now starring in  Mel Gibson's Passion of Christ , appeared in Angel Eyes with J-Lo but didn't want to see her naked.  "The newly married actor told Jen that he didn't want to offend his wife  Kerri , reports the  urlLink Daily Mirror .  "I want to respect her," he said. "The only bare breasts I want next to me in my life belong to my wife."  "An astonished J-Lo ended up filming the scene wearing both her bra and a pair of knickers.  "Jim, a devout Catholic, prays for 15 minutes every morning before working out and went to mass every day while filming the Passion of Christ."  Tee hee (chuckles softly) -- "knickers."

Anyhoo: today they interview-flaggelate Jayson Blair. It is brutal. Or, as they psyche themselves up:  "The steel toes are laced up, we're all hopped up on crystal meth, and we're completely devoid of self-esteem. It is, as they say, definitely on."  It's on like Grey Poupon.  A.L. Daulerio  gives us the scoop (link via  urlLink Gawker ) urlLink  here .

       Howard Stern Declines Rolling Stone Cover .   This morning  Howard Stern  informed his audience that he was offered the cover of  urlLink Rolling Stone Magazine , but declined the offer, through his agent, and not just any agent,  urlLink peasblossom ,  (sotto voce) " super agent,"  urlLink Don Buchwald . Apparently, Stern does not want to be the only face affixed to the  urlLink decency over the airwaves controversy . And who can blame him as  urlLink The Passion of The Christ  tops the box office for the third week in a row, on its way to becoming the largest R-rated box office draw EVER:  urlLink bigger than The Matrix !  "I don't want to be on the cover of  Rolling Stone  because  urlLink Congress passed  (this controverial) law ... it's not just about me," Stern said this morning, then mentioned that although he loves the magazine and  Jann Wenner , the issue is about free speech, not about him.    But wouldn't the cover of RS be the perfect place to defend himself? The college frat boy type whose parent buys them an RS holiday gift subscription provides a great platform to speechify on freedom of speech,  no ? And I am no pal of  Jann Wenner , as regular readers of this blog know.  Which brings us round to this argument: Why is  Howard Stern  mounting such a weak defense of himself? Is the delicate tightropewalk with his ABC contract a factor in his moral calculus? Is he trying not to rock the boat too much as he prepares to  urlLink lounge in the Barbara Walters chair ? Once upon a time, he would have marched an army of influential Nascar dads, policemen, college students, club kids, your garden variety freaks and, last but not least, Long Island construction workers to the nation's capitol to rally against the FCC.  Storm the fucking gates of the empire!  But no more.  Now, in lieu of excercising the political power we all know he is capable of wielding (think  Pataki , think  Christie Todd Whitman , he "protests" by  not reading live copy on the air , encouraging contributing to John Kerry's campaign fund while noting in the secure form that you are a "Howard Stern Fan'' in the vocation are.  And Stern has been asking -- pleading -- for some  urlLink Edward Murrow  to take up the fight in his place. And only the punchdrunk  George Carlin  replies materializing from the ethers.   Howard, if you want to stand up to the issue of censorship in these increasingly evangelical United States:  you are going to have to lead the fight . There are no  Ed Murrows  anymore, ratings and profit making has trumped prestige and quality in an unprecedented reversal in the newsroom. Stern -- who is angling to be under the aegis of ABC News as opposed to ABC Entertainment whoud know that.  Take up the spirit of the 60s, Mr. Stern, redeem your generation, and  fight this as hard as you can .  Then again, if your  ABC TV  deal is more important than this staple Baby Boomer issue -- free speech -- and you'd rather sell out for the comfy job, bermuda shorts and black socks, well ...  you'd have ample company .  urlLink Boomer's are ironically Eisnehoweresque  like that. (PS: They didn't sell out ... they bought in)  Incidentally, it is hugely unlikely that a free speech fight against the US government -- and being on the winning side should Kerry becomes President -- would hurt Stern's job at ABC. Rather the opposite, I would think.  (PS: If you haven't  urlLink gotten tickets already, get 'em ! Prince is doing a secret show tonight at Club Black NYC at around 11 Pm -- via the ultra pretty  urlLink Ultragirrrl )

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In : The New A List. Number one at the Box Office?  Not necessary , cornbread. Primary victories?  Nah . What do  Owen Wilson ,  John Edwards ,  Johnny Depp ,  Angelina Jolie  and  Mary-Cate and Ashley  all have in common? Aside from Depp's  Pirates of the Caribbean , none of these new stars on the media landscape has had a stellar success, like, say,  Tom Cruise , or  John Kerry  has, in their field. And yet we are fascinated by them. More fascinated by them, in fact, than their more successful counterparts.    Julia Roberts  is  far more  successful than  Jolie , and yet -- who would you rather read about, or see on a magazine cover? Huh?  And yet : has Jolie ever helmed a number one hit?  John Edwards  only won South Carolina, and yet, he is the  urlLink Elvis of the Democrats . You can win, it seems,  without winning , as these charismatic stars of Dc and LA -- or, as  Ted Casablancas  likes to say -- "Hell A" -- are proving. Go figure.    Out :  Vivika Fox ruins a $1.5 million dress . Apparently she was crunked up on some red wine. As  urlLink Ananova  reports (via  urlLink IMDB ):  " urlLink Kill Bill star Vivica A Fox  has ruined a diamond-encrusted dress worth $1.5 million with red wine.  " IMDb.com  says the former girlfriend of  50 Cent  made the gaffe at a showbiz party.  "Designer  urlLink Randi Rahm  is now trying to salvage the Oscars dress, but says he's not angry with the star.  "He tells People magazine: 'I got a beautiful Hollywood star who looked breathtaking in the dress. I'm not upset at all, it's all part of the deal!'"  "He says he's busy removing the diamonds, throwing away the stained silk and making Fox a new version which uses beading instead of real diamonds."   Redredwine it makes you feel so fine ....    In : "The World is a Dangerous Place." This  urlLink jejune  cliche has been uttered by conservatives,  sotto voce , for the past year, but it's frequency is increasing. Those 6 words are usually followed up by a  rousing defense  of unilateral action, a denunciation of international law and the UN, or some such fucked up long term strategic policy decision that involves energy resources. "The world is a dangerous place ... so  we gotta  be prepared," is one such line. It must be uttered in a nasally sort of 1950's  Frank Sinatra  manner-- preferably by  Peggy Noonan  on a Sunday morning talking head show. It's  so very  hip. So very.   Out :  Does Colin Powell Have the Keys to the Airplane?  Says the  urlLink AP : ''I think simply Powell, who I know, like and admire, has been never permitted to be fully a secretary of state in the way that I envision the secretary of state,'' said  Senator John Kerry , a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ''I think Powell I'm not sure they didn't lock the keys to the airplane up sometimes.'' On  urlLink Stephanopoulos , Powell denied the allegation calling it "a stereotype (hmmm, what does the Secretary mean?)"   In :  Martha Wainwright . I just have the biggest crush on her. Why hasn't she taken off?  urlLink She's brilliant ! She's a real mama-jama.   Out : The monstrously stupid  urlLink Dierdre Imus . The trophy wife (hmm, how about loving cup wife) of leathery shock jock  Don Imus  sat in on  Tina Brown's Topic A  last night and generally stunk up the place. Taking over "the stupid chair" previously occupied last week by the comedically challenged  Kinky Friedman , Dierdre's catty and seriously unfunny contributions included saying of Secretary of Health and Human Services  Tommy Thompson , "we have (him) on tv with three chins." Charmed, I'm sure. And instead of giving her 'picks' to Tina, she gave these "clever chestnuts" her "predictions":  1)  Donald Trump  will marry himself; and 2) Kerry will dump  Theresa Heinz  and marry the powerball winner.  Oh Dierdre -- please, fetch  Quincy MD  quick -- shnell! --  we just busted a gut laughing .   And always in:  urlLink Whatevs . We love us our  Grambo  fix.

       McCain and Kerry: The Phantom Menace   What is up with  urlLink Senator John McCain's  odd, mysterious flirtations with Kerry's presidential posse, from across the Senate Republican cloak room and, quite frankly, the "across party lines reciprocations" from the  Kerry  camp? It's like a modern day  West Side Story , with McCain, the former southwestern POW, a cagey shark from the Gulf of Mexico, and the craggy, preppy John Kerry, who looks like he stepped out of a  urlLink Gilbert Stuart painting , is a Heinz 57 private corporate jet. And like West Side Story, their choreography is complicated and funky. Finally, it has more than a touch of  political phantom menace .  In other words, why is a Republican senator from a conservative southwestern state making oblique overtures towards the opposition presidential candidate in an election year? Why are Bush and Kerry fucking with the President?   urlLink Robert Novak , always ahead of the curve, offers us this tasty hunk of  urlLink yellow cake :  "In this winter of Republican discontent, the last thing the Grand Old Party needed last week was  Sen. John McCain  leaving the door open for him to be  John Kerry's  Vice Presidential running mate on the Democratic ticket. That opening was tiny, and McCain quickly had it closed with a bang. Nevertheless, the incident was disturbing to knowledgeable Republicans.  "A  Kerry-McCain  ticket is out of the question, and nobody knows it better than McCain. Then why did he for several hours last Wednesday permit what the Associated Press described as 'a glimmer of hope' for this unlikely combination? It reflects more than the senator's indisputable propensity for mischief-making. At a time when George W. Bush needs help and support, McCain is opposing him on a broad front of issues from tax cuts to global warming."  On  urlLink ABC's Good Morning America  recently, John McCain said, ''John Kerry is a close friend of mine. We have been friends for years. Obviously, I would entertain it.'' Say ---  What?!   Then, last week, as if out of the blue,  urlLink Ben Smith of the salmon colored media bible The Observer  wrote in a story that, "A close adviser to Republican Senator John McCain is informally advising Senator John Kerry on his Presidential bid and may go to work for the Democrat's campaign."   Hmmm.  There are higher forces at work here. A phantom menace.   The man in question, the Texan  urlLink John Weaver , was political director to Mr. McCain's failed 2000 campaign against the President.    So what's going on? One imagines an "impromptu" meeting with the President in the West Wing.  Hmmm:    President Bush : May the campaign contributions be with you, my padawan, how are you today?   John McCain : Well, I'm not feeling too welcome with the  urlLink Republicans , of late. Where's the love?   The President : Really, John, sorry to hear that. What's all this crazy talk I hear about you as Kerry's running mate?   Senator McCain : It's just speculation. I'm trying to put the kibosh on it once and for all, Mr. President.   The President : That's good, John.  Patience . Use the Force ...  think.   Senator McCain : Sorry, Mr. President.    The President : Here, you dropped this (hands McCain his  Republican Party membership card .)   Senator McCain : Thank you, Mr. President.   The President : (fatherly) Next time try not to lose it.   Senator McCain : Thank you, Mr. President    The President : (anxious) This weapon is your life!   Senator McCain : (frustrated) I  try , Mr. President.   The President : (dejected) Why do I get the feeling you're going to be the  election defeat  of me?   Senator McCain : (vehement) Don't say that, Mr. President. You're the closest thing to a leader I have.   The President : (sadly)  Then why don't you  listen to me ?   Senator McCain : (at last ...) I am  trying , Mr. President.   And a Preview from our next Corsair episode : McCain meets the dry, stately Kerry in his private campaign bunker, who declares,  benignly , to the Arizona Republican, "You don't need Presidential guidance, John. In time, you will learn to trust your feelings. Then, you will be invincible. I have said it many times, you are the most gifted Senator I have ever met."   McCain : Thank you,  Mr. Nominee .    Kerry : I see you becoming the greatest of all the Senators, John. Even more powerful   urlLink Bill Clinton ."  to be continued

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  Angelina Jolie , pilot. Apparently not content with being an Oscar winning actress, UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, former hillbilly wife and adoptive mom, restless  Angelina Jolie , the future  Mrs. Mwangaguhunga  tells the  urlLink Daily Record  she is studying to be a licensed pilot.   "'My dream is to deliver food and help people get from one place to another.  "'Part of this is because every time (Maddox) sees a plane he's amazed. If I could fly a plane by the time he's four, I'll be like Superwoman to him.'"  My dreams concerning  Angelina Jolie  and superwomen costumes, however, cannot be discussed here, in a  family-friendly  blog (come on, Disney  might  want to buy me out someday; you never know)    Out : The hardest working man in show business,  James Brown , is "disgusted" that the po-po didn't let him freshen up before taking his  urlLink now infamous mug shot .   The singer of "hotpants" told the  urlLink Sydney Morning Herald  (link via  urlLink ananova ), "It was quite comical. You get a man out of bed and that kind of thing happens.  "You don't get a chance to freshen yourself up. You expect that. Later on, I got my shave in and did my hair nicely, and I was smiling."  James -- if I may call him that -- James stressed he wasn't angry about the arrest, just "disgusted." He went on:  "For all I've done, the things I've tried to do and accomplished, just to treat me that way is an injustice in this country.  "I'm not angry about it. I'm just a human being. It happened to our Lord, so who am I? It's been done to goodwill people since time began -  urlLink Martin Luther King ,  urlLink John Kennedy , people around the world in one way or another.  "I'm no better, and I thank God because it makes me stronger and I keep on going. The people's spirit lifts me. I'm just a human being reacting and I'm going to work."  Let's hope the people's spirit, that antic bastard muse, moves Our Man James to stop beating up his wife and leading the police through multistate PCP-fueled high speed chases.   In : The Florida Highway Patrol, policing the redneck Riviera, used an unfortunate slang word when referring to the girlfriend of a crunked up fellow officer. Apparently,  urlLink according to the Smokinggun ,  Officer Rick Benton  there is no decorum for a fellow officer arrested. In his  actual  arrest report,  Rick Benton  writes of 31-year-old corrections officer  Travis McConchie  and his girlfriend  Bernadette :  "Travis was stopped for speeding 73 in a 45 mph he failed to pull over for approximately 1/2 mile. His girlfriend  was naked and weas sitting on top of him with her tits in his face."   urlLink Okay, Roscoe P Coltrane : Since when is it okay for a cop to use slang on an official report? I mean, could't he find some burocratic term, like sweater muffins or dirty pillows? Why'd he have to go there? Why'd he have to sound like he was in a bar?    Out : Is  Kirstie Alley  Out of control? Apparently, Mr. Fucking  urlLink John Travolta , king of self indulgence,  urlLink Mr. Buy My own Private Jet , name my son  Jett  (conceived, by the way, on a romantic weekend at  Bruce Willis  and  Demi Moore's  place), fly it at all hours and drive my neighbors batty, and then -- the piece de resistance -- make an  urlLink unwatchable science fiction scientology religious movie , belives that Alley is out of control, according to  urlLink The Star :  "Former sex symbol  Kirstie Alley's  weight has gotten so out of control that, sources say, her good friend (and fellow Scientologist)  John Travolta  has staged an intervention to help keep her from ballooning even more.  Kirstie, 53, who rose to fame and fortune with her role as the feisty  Rebecca Howe  on the hit '80s sitcom  Cheers , has gone from va-va-voom voluptuous to formidably fat."    In :  The Spice Market .  So in it's almost out .  urlLink Page Six notes today  that  Tom Cruise  likes the place:  "Cruise, who celebrated the announcement of his split with (Penelope) Cruz by dining with  Will Smith  at  urlLink Spice Market  Thursday night, has yet to be linked to another woman. But the star won't be unattached for long, and Hollywood insiders speculate his next escort will likely be a Scientologist because Cruise has been devoting more time to his faith and surrounding himself with fellow Scientologists."  And on Monday it will be surrounded in buzz (as well as the stench of blood and offal from the meatpacking district) as  Janet Jackson's  album relase party is held there, as Fix reports:  "Virgin Records is throwing a CD release party for  urlLink Damita Jo  on Monday, March 29  urlLink for invited guests only . It will be held at  Jean-Georges Vongerichten's   Spice Market  restaurant in New York City. Spice Market is located at 403 West 13th Street."   Out :  Michael Jackson .

And you know --  you just know  -- that Hello will be followed by  Us Weekly  and  Star  and  National Enquirer . Down time, as we know it, is almost over; welcome to the world of 24/7 gossip and cell phone nude pics of celebs in compromising positions.  Not that we really mind thet, cornbread.    In :  Charlie Rangel  wants to fight over prescription drugs. The fuzzy teddy bear who represents Harlem in the House of Representatives to the World's Last Superpower is getting punchy over prescription drugs. According to  urlLink the Hill's Michael S. Gerber :  "The top Democrat on the  urlLink House Ways and Means Committee  threatened to go to the House floor if Republicans deny his request to hold additional hearings on the administration’s alleged cover-up of the estimated cost of last year’s prescription drug bill.  “If we don’t hear from the chairman of the committee, we can take a privileged motion and go to the floor to demand that we get the consideration that’s given to us under the rules as the minority,” Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) told  Mark Bisnow  of  PolicyWonk Weekly .  Okay,  leaving aside  the fact that I have just quoted something called PolicyWonk Weekly, this falls into the Democrat's strategy of tying as many probes and investigations to this administration as humanly possible as the election race heats up; so far  urlLink I count nine .  In other related news, the rumors regarding  urlLink Fred Dicker's NY Post column  about a vengeful  Al Sharpton  urging  Adam Clayton Powell IV , Rangel's mortal enemy, his nemesis, Moriarty to his Holmes, to run against him again with his backing are sizzling the streets of Harlem.

Anyhoo :  urlLink That Other Old Gray Lady  reviews her new show, the D-List.  Virginia Hefferman  likes it, apparently.   In :  urlLink John Fowles .

       William Safire on the 9/11 Commission   Pity the great writer on politics and language  William Safire .  Why ? Well, aside from being a Pulitzer Prize winning former Nixon speechwriter and Senior columnist for the  Old Gray Lady , he has a lot of new words to digest and interpret for his  On Language  column in the  Sunday Magazine . These 9/11 hearings have given us all pause, what with their codewords spiralling out into the light of day.  I wonder how  urlLink Bill  would analyze the 9/11 hearings of yesterday?  Hmmm (dreamy fade away):   Actionable Intelligence   What is  urlLink actionable intelligence ? And when, more precisely, is intelligence actionable?  In response to questioning from the 9/11 commission on Tuesday, Secretary of Defense  Donald  "The Jockstrap"  Rumsfeld  said, "First, I know of no  actionable intelligence  since January 20, 2001 that would have allowed the U.S. to attack and capture or kill  Usama bin Laden ."  But in this matter we will give the last word to DC  urlLink doyenne   Sally Quinn , who is used to such gallant favors:  Washington DC is a matriarchal society and I am the queen bee. Any incoming administration would be ill advised to get on my bad side early in the game. Ask  urlLink Bill Clinton  about that point sometime.  Anyway , I received some action able intelligence  via the Hill some time ago that  urlLink Arianna Huffington  coveted my social position. Well, I don't like to kiss and tell, but let's just say Arianna was last seen dropping out of the California recall debacle and  urlLink producing telemovies . She'll never eat lunch in this town again. Draw your own conclusions.                                                                                         Sally Quinn,                                                                                        Washington DC   The Washington Read   "I have not read the book, " is not the sentence that the President utters most often, although, no doubt, he probably does. "I have not read the book,"  is the answer that many under questioning from the 9/11 Commission offer up.   And what is the book in question? Why: It's  urlLink Richard Clarke's   urlLink Against All Enemies .  Everyone it seems used plausible denial when asked whether or not they had read the book in question. Only one respondent admitted to "the Washington read," which entails scanning the index to see if anything is said about you.   This reminds me of an incident between  urlLink Norman Mailer and William F. Buckley :  " William F. Buckley  once sent fellow author  Norman Mailer  a copy of his latest book. Mailer, disappointed to find that Buckley had apparently neglected to inscribe the book, promptly flipped through the index to see whether he had been mentioned. There, beside his name, Mailer found Buckley's 'inscription' - a handwritten 'Hi!'"   The adjectival Talmudic   Let's get our " urlLink boots on the ground " and try to discover the use of  urlLink Talmudic  as an adjective by the 9/11 Commission.   urlLink The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage  by  Allan Siegal  and  William G. Connolly  says of Talmud, "The overall term (literally study) for the body of Jewish oral law and tradition."   But what they don't mention is that studying the Talmud is thirsty work. Influential conservative philosopher  Leo Strauss  made many innovations in the study of ancient philosophical texts through his intimate knowledge the Talmud (Strauss was a rabinnical student) You won't see  President Bush  in the near future poring over the Talmud in the West Wing, deep in thought. And so, with that improbably image in mind, any text too complicated for Dubya will hereafter be called  Talmudic .   Thank You For Your Candor    After testimony is given the commissioners tell those who have just testified, "Thank you for your candor." Where did this originate?  Candor, of course, is derivative from the ancient Kryptonian city of  urlLink Kand-or.   "Kandor is ... harbored in the  Fortress of Solitude  until Superman can one day find a way to free the people from their dimensional prison. Until that day, Cerizah and the people of Kandor will feel safe knowing Superman is looking out for their well being."

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  Richard Simmons , that Slapstick little bitch. ( ed note : each slap burns a grand total of 15 calories!)  Perky and flamboyant was so 90s , we want slap happy, we want gin drinks hurled at unspeakable velocities across rooms. Drama, dear reader, is  very in ; that never goes out of fashion. Imagine the following scenario: you are a man who likes pastry.  You cannot have the pastry . You are a proud man.  But your job entails that you be a punching bag for all manner of snarky tv hosts . Sometimes you are afflicted by black thoughts. But you must always smile while in public  even when you're crying on the inside .  The scenario above describes  Richard Simmons , our Shakespearean fool in short shorts, our chubby muppet-like fitness guru. Only the folks at  urlLink TheSmokinggun  could capture the hallucinatory dream-like character of la vie when Richard keeps it gangsta:  " Richard Simmons  was arrested yesterday and charged with assaulting a  Harley Davidson  salesman during a confrontation at a Phoenix airport. No, that is not a joke. The 54-year-old fitness guru (5' 7", 155 pounds) laid the smackdown on one  Chris Farney , a 23-year-old Mesa man (6' 1" and 255 pounds) who happens to cage wrestle in his spare time. According to the below Phoenix Police Department report, when Farney spotted Simmons (whose real first name is Milton) walking through the  Sky Harbor International Airport , he said, 'Look, Richard Simmons. Drop your bags, let's rock to the 50's.' Farney told cops he was referring to an old Simmons workout tape. The diminutive star responded by walking over to the strapping Farney and saying, 'It's not nice to make fun of people with issues.' He then slapped Farney's face. The motorcycle salesman, who was not injured, called cops, who cited an 'emotional' and repentant Simmons for assault."  Okay,  tout ensemble , people: " Milton ?!"   And, seriously, can't you just see Simmons, with dead shark eyes and a icy growl, saying, sotto voce, hands on hips for dramatic effect, "It's not nice to make fun of people with issues."  Then Simmons slowly walks up to Farney, with malice in his eye and bad intentions in the cocked wrist, slapping the Harley Davidson salesman with a haymaker, not so much hurting the man's face, so much as hurting the man's  feelings.    Even cage wrestlers get the blues .    Out : New School President and Democrat  Bob Kerrey . Kerrey took the opportunity to play the partisan on a non-partisan committee investigating 9/11 by  urlLink blasting Fox News publicly . Kerry was a moderate Democrat, but the New School is about as far to the left as an institution can possibly go.  The New School  is so far to the left, that Kerry's presidency has drawn fire. Apparently he wasn't democrat enough! So, keeping his embattled presidency in mind, you can see how Kerry would tone his comments of (makes ironical quote gestures) "outrage." No doubt he will have neutralized opposition to his presidency on campus and be welcomed as the conquering hero in Grenwhich Village by the time you read this blog.   In : Diplomats are the new black.  Sidney Pollack  is filming  urlLink The Interpreter in the UN .  The Observer writes:  "At a press conference at the United Nations earlier this month, Mr. Pollack said he 'hoped very much' to include some real live diplomats in the film, and was discussing it with the U.N.  "'We’ve had a lot of interest from the various diplomats,' Mr. Pollack said. 'Not only is that better for us, more authentic, but in each case they’ll be playing who they are, so I don’t have to worry about directing actors.' At the moment, the U.N.’s office of legal affairs is looking into the possibility of diplomats doubling as actors."  There are so many poignant lines about Machiavellian politics and acting that I might try out here, that remaining silent would probably be my best course.   Out :  urlLink Poison's Brett Michaels goes Country . We should have known something was up when he tried to pawn off 'Every Rose Has It's Thorn" as heavy metal fare. The Ap writes:  "Michaels lived in Nashville for a few years in the late 1990s and was back there this month spending time with singer-songwriter  Jeffrey Steele , who recently signed with  Lofton Creek . Reportedly, Michaels is planning a country version of his song 'Every Rose Has Its Thorn.' And he's already dipped his toes into a country career. He makes a cameo in  Tracy Lawrence's  upcoming video for 'It's All How You Look At It.'"  On his web site  urlLink here  you can see he is already sporting cowboy hats. Image is everythang, hoss. Once a man transitions his website, more is sure to follow.  This may be the first transition from metal to country ever.

       Village Voice: NYPD Admits to Hip Hop Intelligence Unit    urlLink Today's Village Voice  unleashes a bombshell today sure to reverberate through the music world and African American and latino culture. Apparently, the NYPD lied when the consistently denied, in the press, the existence of a surveillance of those in the hip hop community. This is, of course, utter and complete bullshit, as anyone who has ever seen the dark unmarked detective cars surveilling hip hop tour busses as they line up outside of Sony Music Studios on West 54th street knows.   urlLink Dasun Allah of the Voice  writes:  "While earlier this week the department acknowledged consulting with Miami authorities, over the years the police brass have consistently denied that there is a team keeping tabs on rap stars and their entourages. A two-month investigation into the existence of such an intelligence squad produced revelations from a retired detective who says he was its founder and architect, and an admission from the NYPD that indeed there are officers assigned to do surveillance on people in and around the hiphop music scene."  He continues:  "'We have an intelligence division and we have detectives that monitor the music industry and any incidents regarding the music industry,'says  Officer Doris Garcia , an NYPD spokesperson. 'And in regards to Miami P.D. we did exchange information, and that’s it.'"   Glad to see that under Bloomberg there is a certain frankness emerging out of the NYPD in our democracy, but still, this does not excuse the fact that the police, up until now, and only under direct questioning, out and out lied. And further, they are profiling an industry that is disportionately African American and Latino,  which is fucked up .   urlLink Dasun Allah  goes on:  "Hiphop music and fashion titan  Russell Simmons  thinks that the NYPD needs to contend with more serious concerns surveillance of rap stars, and questions their utilization of resources. 'They don’t follow around every rock and roll outlaw. They should be following around all these drug dealers that are real obvious,' he says. 'You know who the drug dealers are. You know all of their names. Why are you wasting your police force energy on singers?'"   Oh come on, Russell, you know the cops follow  Kid Rock  and  Alanis Morrissette , you know they do. Uh, don't they?  Read the VV article  urlLink here .   ( Update : a wise reader of the Velvet Rope forums named  urlLink platinumhussy  reminded me that the police used to surveil punk rock clubs, so this is not a new "racial" phenomenon in social science. Do the police have a right to this manner of surveiling? I don't know. Were they wrong in lying about the existence of the unit? I still believe so.)  due to work constraints,  The Corsair  won't be blogging anything new tommorrow. Sorry

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In : Miami. A Miami 5 Year old boy apparently sprinkled the sweet leaf on a classmates lasagne at the school cafteria. His bad.  urlLink The Associated Press  reports:  "Police say a 5-year-old boy brought a bag of marijuana to school and was sprinkling it over a friend's lasagna at the school cafeteria before a monitor intervened.   "Police say it is unclear whether the kindergartner at  urlLink Gratigny Elementary School  even knew he was carrying the drugs on Monday.  "The lasagna was confiscated before the other boy had a chance to eat it."   Never let a kindergartener near your stash !  Apparently,  Entertainment Tonight  is going to do a show on whether or not John Kennedy Jr  urlLink smoked pot .  "Tonight on ET, we have new Kennedy bombshells: Did JFK JR. smoke pot? Was he diagnosed with ADD? Best-selling author  urlLink LAURENCE LEAMER  (The Kennedy Men: 1901-1963) reveals the shocking news he learned about JFK's son. Plus, we have the personal photos you've never seen before!  "'John took marijuana the same way other people take a martini in the evening,' claims Leamer, whose  Sons of Camelot: The Fate of an American Dynasty  is in bookstores now.  "In fact, Leamer says  JFK Jr ., although he was not addicted to the herb, liked it so much he took it over the border to Canada during a road trip with pals. "His friends told me they were worried they'd be arrested,' says Leamer. 'John wanted to bring it with them.'"  Fuck, Kennedy weed.  You just know that must be better than hydro .   Out : Hiding crack in your crack. First off, you would think that crack rock cocaine would be  outre , I mean, look at what it did to that little old lady who tried to give  urlLink Junior Soprano  a "half and half" last Sunday night.    Anyhoo : According to  urlLink theSmokingGun , Jovon Williams had a rough night being searched by the police:  " Jovon Williams , a 24-year-old Wisconsin man found himself with a difficult decision to make last week. After Milwaukee cops searched him for drugs, he could have either turned over the goods stashed in his pants, or found a new hiding place. Williams chose the latter. According to the ... search warrant affidavit filed in the circuit court, Williams told police, 'I didn't want to get caught with that dope, I got 18 rocks, you would've done the same thing, I stuffed it way up my ass.' As for the outcome, there's little doubt no stone was left unturned in the search for the crack."  Let's just hope the cops had warm hands.   In : Grief counselling for Martha Stewart Omnimedia employees.  urlLink The National Enquirer reports  that overdramatic workers could whine at operatic lengths to a paid professional:  " ... employees of  Martha Stewart's  company were being offered 'grief counseling' -- after her conviction shocked, devastated and reduced them to tears.  "After the guilty verdicts were announced, almost everyone felt complete and utter disbelief," disclosed a staffer at  Martha Stewart Living  magazine.  "'We just couldn't believe that Martha would probably be going to prison.'  "'The mood at the magazine was very somber and subdued -- and it has been ever since.'  "'Everyone was walking around like zombies -- like there was a death in the family.'"  As Martha would say, stone ground crackers go well with that  urlLink whine .   Out :  urlLink Access Hollywood's   Billy Bush  is a dickface.  Jason McIntyre  of that significant  urlLink cultural artifact Star Magazine  writes:  "At the Oscars, he brazenly played matchmaker for 13-year-old  Keisha Castle- Hughes  and veteran actor  Johnny Depp . Then he had the gall to ask  Naomi Watts , 'Watts up?' Just who is  Billy Bush , and why is he always yelling?    Bush , 32, the boisterous first cousin of  President George W. Bush  (Billy's dad is the brother of the first  President Bush ), is certainly a rising star. As an entertainment correspondent for Access Hollywood, he has leaned over  Alec Baldwin  to talk to  Sandra Bullock , and tried to ambush  Ethan Hawke  with off-color questions."  Like I said: a dickface.   In : Buttafucco. As in,  urlLink Joey Buttafucco . He's back:  in jail.  He's in jail because he failed, as the  urlLink Daily News writes :  " Joey Buttafuoco , whose 17-year-old lover,  Amy Fisher , became known as the Long Island Lolita after shooting his wife in the head, was sentenced to a year in jail for auto insurance fraud.   "Buttafuoco, 48, pleaded guilty to a single felony count and was immediately booked into the Los Angeles County Jail. Prosecutors said Buttafuoco, who co-owns a San Fernando Valley body shop, told undercover agents how to file phony insurance claims.  "Superior Court Judge  David Horwitz  also sentenced Buttafuoco to five years' probation and ordered him to pay more than $4,600 in restitution."  The upside is that no one in jail is so desperate as to make Buttafuoco his "mistress."  His Buttafuoco is safe.

       Kofi and Courtney: All I Wanted Was Some Chicken Nuggets    urlLink Page Six gives us the goods  on the apparently not homeless but merely bedraggled breast suckler,  Kofi Asare :  " Kofi Asare , 23, tells PAGE SIX he hopes to print the infamous image on T-shirts, and use it to further his dreams of becoming an actor or model. 'First there was Justin and Janet, and now there's Kofi and Courtney,' Asare crows. 'It's great exposure for me. I look at the picture and I think,  Wow, that's a classic shot. It's controversial, but it's all in good fun .'   "The photo - which shows a grinning Love pulling down her top while Asare suckles her like a newborn baby - has been burning up the Internet and is rumored to have been bought by the National Enquirer.   "Asare says he was heading into  Wendy's  around 8 p.m. last Wednesday when he saw Love flashing her breasts at paparazzi outside. 'All I wanted was some chicken nuggets,' Asare says. 'I saw Miss Love flashing everyone. I had to push the envelope. I figured, 'This is a once in a lifetime opportunity.' She flashed me so I was like, 'May I?' She was cool with it. It wasn't like I was trying to do anything to degrade her.   "'I just said, Thank you, and she got into her vehicle with some people she was with. They sped off and the paparazzi sped off after them.' Love was arrested hours later after she allegedly hit a fan with a microphone stand while performing at  Plaid .   "Asare, who is black, said he was offended after some identified him as 'homeless' when describing the photo. 'I didn't appreciate being vilified like that,' said Asare, a reservations agent for a limousine company who lives with his parents in Morningside Heights. 'It was an assassination of my character. I'm not homeless. I graduated from  SUNY-New Paltz  last year. I majored in public relations.'"  I wouldn't advertise a graduation from New Paltz, but point taken. With regards to the more serious allegations about underage sex, the most excellent Page Sixers investigated, and Ted Nugent wasn' returning calls:  "Meanwhile, Love went on Howard Stern's radio show yesterday and gave a rambling interview in which she claimed to have performed oral sex on rocker  Ted Nugent  when she was a 12-year-old groupie. Nugent did not return our call for comment. "  Nor did he return emails from  The Corsair .

       Courtney's Underage Ted Nugent Sex Allegation   (scroll down for 60 Minutes piece)  Another day  Courtney Love  bombshell, but this one is particularly disturbing, so I'll keep the snark to a minimum. One wonders if illegal underage sex is what Nugent means by  urlLink quality of life upgrade  that the Republican Party represents. On the  urlLink Howard Stern Show  today,  Courtney Love  admitted, after heavy questioning, to allegedly having had oral sex with Republican  Ted Nugent  at the age of  twelve . This is an impossibly horrible revelation --  is there a statute of limitations for this sort of thing?  -- and explains quite a bit about Courtney Love's disfunctional relationship to the rock and roll lifestyle.  At the Republican convention several years back, Nugent gushed to ABC News, via a chat:  "I was very proud to assist, with our  urlLink Ted Nugent United Sportsmen of America  Texas members, to send  Ann Richards  on her terminal nacho date with Cuomo and help elect a real American as governor of the great state of Texas.  George W . Is my American Blood Brother."  Nugent runs the  urlLink Ted Nugent Camp for Kids , which, according to their website:  "Following Fred's direction on their last hunt together, Ted created this incredibly successful Kamp for children to learn about nature  and man together. A 100% volunteer  501C3  non-profit corporation. Ted Nugent Kamp for Kids is operated by qualified families and individuals who deeply care about children and their futures. Every child is treated with love, affection and spiritual guidance by our dedicated volunteers. Lessons in resource stewardship, individual accountability, the  Ten Commandments ,  the Golden Rule ,  Hunter Safety and law ,  International Bow Education (IBEP )    and basic lesson in life are driven home in an open honest ,caring setting in the wild. Two weekends each summer for kids 9-15 will touch will touch them deeply for up-grade. True North."   Finally, In a  urlLink Salon interview  in 2002, "(Nugent) names a wild boar after  Janet Reno  ('the only thing missing was the purple dress and he-man haircut'), and describes the same boar as emitting a  'Courtney Love -like squeal.'"  No doubt the very folks  urlLink Page Six  and/or another entertainment outlet will be all over this tomorrow. We hope they can get Nugent to explain himself so we can get to the bottom of Love's serious allegations and whether they have a basis in fact.  I'm sure that the evangelical former governor and current President would be pleased at the relation.  Courtney Love  called  Howard Stern  on his cell phone at around 8 am.   "She thinks she can just pick up her phone (and call me) and we'll be doing my radio show," said the amused Stern.  Apparently, Courtney has some trouble distinguishing between real life and the public persona, according to Howard's sidekick.  "He knows how to be Howard Stern when he's off the air," snapped  Robin Quivers , curtly.   urlLink As the morning conversation  continued, Stern asked Love, "so what's going to  happen to you?"  "I'm gonna have to retire," replied Courtney, tongue in cheek.  On injured  urlLink Daily News photographer Dara Kushner , Love was equally snarky, "her nose was grazed, but let's go out in an ambulance anyway."  And Love didn't mince words when it came to backing Howard on his FCC problems.  "Clear Channel can eat me -- give me some (props) for slamming Clear Channel for you."  "... That's very brave," replied Stern.   The two bantered about an upcoming Love appearance on  Jay Leno . in which she hopes to come off as normal to America.  "Leno is Letterman Lite," attacked Stern, who has been feuding with the former Doritos pitchman since The Tonight Show swiped  Stuttering John Melendez .  Finally, when Stern asked about  urlLink the homeless man who suckled at her breast , she explained, "we were mobbed at a Wendy's -- I don't remember, he grabbed my body." Then, "how about I punch him and go to jail?"  Then when asked what would happen in her custody battle as a result of the offending picture, Courtney snapped, "don't you go near Francis (Bean), she's fine."  At "press" time, the two were still chatting it up; she had grabbed a cab from her loft came to the studio.

       Al Franken: Democratic Party Bouncer   From time to time  Al Franken  likes to kick  urlLink a little bit o' Ass  --  Republican ass , playa. The other day he used just  urlLink the right mix of hard power and soft power,  so to speak, in a short term domestic conflagration. Didn't you know that Howard Dean's  aggro  speeches would one day cause some kind of ruckus sooner or later?  urlLink The New York Times Magazine (subscription required) captures the frenzied mood surrounding Al Franken's rather "punchy" ass-whipping of a confused protester at a  Howard Dean  campign rally with the appropriate amount of gusto.   But let me set a little ambiance for you , cornbread, cause that's the sorrt of thing Bloggers like to do. (plays  urlLink Europe's The Final Countdown ) It is "the Sunday before the nation's first primary," at a  Howard Dean  rally in downtown Manchester. The New England winter is crisp; the mood is one of fighting back. The Republicans have been eating the lunch of the Democratic Party since  Ca-lee-fohrn-eeaaah , and the midterm elections and, of course, the Supreme's 5/4 dance number that handed the Bushies the keys to the White House.   Anyhoo : Our man on the scene, the NY Times writer, one  Russell Shorto , feels it important for us to know -- at the outset -- that Franken's tushy is the stuff of the Gods, ambrosial:  "From 1966 to 1969, Franken was a member of the varsity wrestling team at his high school in Hopkins, Minn. Six years after graduation, when he showed up in New York to begin work as a writer on the first season of  urlLink 'Saturday Night Live ,' he was still almost as much an athlete as a comedian. ''He seemed like a total jock,'' says the comedian  urlLink Laraine Newman , who was a member of the original cast. 'He always had a football in his hands when they were writing. And he had this very defined musculature. His butt was like a cut basketball. Which, you know, you don't normally see in comedy writers.'"  No, no, one doesn't,  Mr. Shorto , to be sure; but  The Corsair's  former girlfriends don't complain, we are in our early 30s after all  is all I'm saying .    Anyhoo : Let's bring on the rassling. Now for a spot of the old rough and tumble,  Harvard-style  --- bring-it-on!:  "Onstage,  Martin Sheen  speaks first, then Dean's demure wife, then the suddenly embattled former governor of Vermont himself. Sometime after Dean begins taking questions from the audience, a manic-looking heckler starts to heckle, accusing Dean of 'covering up for  Dick Cheney .' He gets louder. A couple of spindly members of Dean's security team approach him uncertainly; he swings his arms and keeps shouting. It goes on for several minutes and seems to be veering toward actual violence. Dean, the media, the members of the audience: nobody knows what to do."  Oh, but our man Franken does,  does he ever  (wicked Rumsfeldian gleam in eyes):  "At this moment Franken turns, cocks his head slightly, gives that well-known magnified, tortoise-shell-framed gaze and says: 'I think the two of us can get him out. You wanna do it?' After a pause that is meant to be emphatic, I say, 'No.' But it's too late: he's off, in rumpled jeans and a big down jacket, plowing up the aisle."   Al Franken's  old school like that. When he cocked his head you just knew:  it was on like Gray Poupon .  The Corsair  imagines the Harvard educated simian, rumpled jeans and big brown jacket ruffling in the wind, the accoustical sounds of  urlLink Six Million Dollar Man bionic  sound effects stacattoed in the background ( da-da-da-da-da  ...) as Franken-in-slow-motion-bolt approaches that unfortunate looney, head low and spectacles fogged:  "By this time there is a confused scrum around the heckler, who is holding his ground and still ranting. Franken hits the floor, wedges himself among a couple dozen legs and puts the man in a wrestling hold, grabbing him at the knees."  One can almost buckle at the beauty of the writing at this  New York Times  sports section style commentary, like that unfortunate freak, tumbling down the slippery slope into Prose Heaven. Oh,  tell us more :  "That destabilizes him, and others now quickly push him down the aisle and out the side door of the theater."  Oh Al, destabilize the GOP;  destabilize !:  "Franken gets up, looking dazed; his glasses are snapped in two. He's quickly swarmed by confused but excited reporters who want to know, like, what was he doing?"  He's kicking ass and taking names, gentlemen,  Harvard-style . Snapped spectacles be damned! The Democrats are mad as hell and  urlLink they're not gonna take it .  Read the rest of the  urlLink NY Times profile .  Way to go, Big Man; at the upcoming Boston Dem convention, Big Al will be taking on a  urlLink Larouchie with a weak knee . Be there or be square ...

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In : According to NBC News Chief Foreign Affairs correspondent  urlLink Andrea Mitchell  on the  Chris Matthews Show  on Sunday, Hillary has let it be known in the Senate cloak room that she wants the Kerry Veep slot. Now, if only she had a strong military background, pull in the Southwest and was a  urlLink prisoner of war in Korea . Then she'd be idea. Oh, and if only she were a Republican.   Out :  urlLink Alexandra Robbins . She is following up her best selling expose of Skull and Bones with Pledged: an expose of sororities in general. If only she had been tapped as a Bonesman, none of this vitriol would be streaming out of the presses.    In: In an odd flash of anger,  Ebert  and pony boy  Roeper  unleashed some of their own vitriol on Hollywood  urlLink on their tv show  last week:   Roeper : "(The Soprano's) is better than more than 50% of the feature movies we review here."   Ebert : " --When you say more than 50%?"   Roeper : "Probably more like 75%"   Ebert : (stares angrily into the camera) "Yeah."   What the fuck?!    (*shivering* sips Cutty Sark) Ahh,  the pause that refreshes!    Out : Was  Dick Clarke's  60 Minutes chat with  Leslie Stahl  an infomercial? Well, I notes that it would have problems with the right on Saturday, but not this particular set of problems. For one, Clarke's career was pretty much down the drains because he falsely predicted that the next terror war would be cyber, rather than the old fashioned variety. But does that make 60 Mins last night and infomercial?  urlLink Matt Drudge  seems to think so:  "60 MINUTES pro  Lesley Stahl  is said to have been aware of the conflict before the program aired.  [CBSNEWS.COM did add a disclaimer to its Internet coverage of the book over the weekend: "Against All Enemies," which is being published Monday by FREE PRESS, a subsidiary of SIMON & SCHUSTER. Both CBSNews.com and SIMON & SCHUSTER are units of VIACOM." And CBS RADIO did carry a disclaimer in its news coverage of the book.]  " ... Earlier this year, it was Stahl who also profiled another author on 60 MINUTES -- for another book owned by VIACOMCBS -- without any disclaimer!  "'The Price of Loyalty' by former Treasury Secretary, turned Bush critic,  Paul O'Neill  was financed, produced and released [and rolled-out at CBSNEWS] by VIACOM's SIMON & SCHUSTER.

I had a long night of drinking. Thanks much.   In :  Big Knickers  ... huh? ... no, Sir, I am not a racist, I said Big Knickers, not ... oh, never mind.   Anyhoo: as  urlLink Kylie Minogue notes in Blender via Ananova , thongs are out, and big knickers are in, ostensibly to cover up all  urlLink those buttock implants going around :  "Kylie told  Blender : 'Big knickers are back. Women want comfort again. And I don't mean the sort of underwear our grandmothers wore.  "'It'll be more French and sexy, but definitely bigger. The G-string is last year's thing. The thong is gone! The flossing has finished!'"   Out : Airheaded but sexy older woman  urlLink Deborah Norville  got spanked by  Howie Kurtz  on  urlLink Reliable Sources  on Sunday. No, not like that, get your minds out of the gutter.  Apparently, Norville's gang on her new  urlLink MSNBC talkfest  (stinkfest?) mistook  urlLink an Onion story  for a real news story and ran with it.  urlLink Embarassingly, Norville's peeps denied  that they had gotten it wrong, telling Howard Kurtz when he asked for comment that they were in on the joke, meant the story as a spoof and simply forget to credit the Onion.  Riiiight . When we want a sexy older woman, we'll go with  urlLink Old Hag .   In : Doing things naked. Last week we noted  Darryl Hannah  and  Carmen Electra , suspiciously close to upcoming projects, admitted that they like to jog and play drums, respectively --  in the buff!   Add  urlLink Alanis Morrisette's  name to the bunch. She notes that she likes to walk around naked:  "The singer who appeared naked in video  urlLink Thank U , said: "I walk around naked all the time. I'm a leave-the-bathroom-door-open nudist, which is sometimes disconcerting for my friends."  "She says even her parents share her habit of discarding their clothes at home. She added: 'We all walked around naked when it was appropriate, there wasn't a lot of shame to it.'  "She says her parents were on the 'periphery of hippiedom' although she herself didn't totally embrace the hippie lifestyle, says the  Daily Record ."  Oh yeah, she just happens to have  urlLink So-Called Chaos  coming out on May 17 on  Maverick Records , but that's  just a coincidence , peeps.  fin  (we'll always be together; together in  urlLink electric dreams )

       The Condi Rice 9/11 Testimony Drinking Game (Thanks, Wonkette)    National Security Advisor  Condi Rice's  testimony will probably have as much gravity as  urlLink Watergate , as well it should. The 9/11 Commission is trying to find out what went wrong, how did the worst terrorist attack in our history catch us off guard? Finding those answers is the job of the Commission.   And what of us? What of we policy geeks who called in sick to our jobs (*cough, cough*) so that we could watch (family emergency) this historic moment (stomach virus) uninterrupted by  work ?   Drink , my sweet readers; let the  urlLink Cutty Sark  cut the gravity.  urlLink Wonkette had the idea , but because the day got away from her, I felt I should give it a shot. I give to you, dear reader, with special mention to Wonkette for the idea,  The Condi Rice 9/11 Commission Drinking Game :   Take one drink if:    ... Condi refers to White House documentation: memos, e-mails or agenda items  ... Condi says she wants to "work with the Commission" (every time she does)    Take two drinks if:    ... Condi's opening statement goes beyond 20 minutes  ... Condi puts down  Richard Clarke    Pound it if:    ... Former Senator  urlLink Bob Kerry  makes an outrageous statement  ... A Republican on the panel tells Bob Kerry that he is being partisan  ... Condi puts down the Clinton Administration  ...

       In Media Res:    Simon Dumenco Defends the Indie Spirit in the Mag Industry   "On a recent warm night in New York City, I suffered for my art (or for this column, at least): I went to the launch party for Cargo," begins  urlLink Simon Dumenco in Folio Mag , very honestly, with a faint ring of melancholy, like in  Charlie Brown  comic strip.  Although he is old friends with the publisher of  Cargo ,  Alan Katz , Dumenco writes, "I suppose my problem — my attitude problem — is that my wires cross when I contemplate something like  Cargo  because I can't quite picture editors there thinking, 'Thank god for the ad sales staff — they make it possible for me to ….' Do what, exactly? Okay, to be fair, Cargo does engage in journalism of a sort — it covers the, uh, shopping beat. But a journalistic enterprise sheared entirely of narrative — with no trace of the essential human impulse for meaningful storytelling — well, I just can't wrap my mind around it."  Then Dumenco's narrative latches onto  Alan Light , former Editor in Chief of  Spin , who is putting out  Tracks ; odds are not in favor of Tracks, but Dumenco writes:  "In the crush of the  Cargo  crowd, I'd briefly become separated from (his companion), and when I found her again she was talking to her friend  Alan Light , the editor-in-chief of  Tracks , the music magazine for boomers. As I talked to this Alan, I wanted to give him a bear hug."   Tracks  is about music for grown ups, all the stuff that didn't get into  Spin  that frustrated  Light  over the years. And of that indie spirit, Dumenco says:  "I like that Tracks exists. I like that it can exist. And I like that major liquor conglomerates and car companies ( Absolut  and  Nissan ) have come in, even though — shock of all shocks — Tracks never writes about booze or minivans.  " Cargo  is the future, of course: media about product consumption begetting more product consumption. But it will always carry some daunting, anti-journalistic baggage. (Can it ever be anything but advertiser-friendly? Can it be expected to tell us, in any great measure, what not to buy?)"  Very good column.   Adam Moss at New York Magazine    urlLink FashionWireDaily  peeps in at the behind the scened transition of  Adam Moss  as new editor at  urlLink New York Magazine :  "Just as  Mayor Moss  put the finishing touches on New York's interior design issue coming out next week, he made some decorative decisions of his own. First he repainted his corner office, which has a view of  urlLink St. Patrick’s Cathedral . Then, in what came as a shock to staffers, he tore down an artistic, translucent glass wall that separates his office from the main hallway and built a solid white wall in its place. Unlike the classic newsroom, where editors like  Bonnie Fuller ,  Patrick McCarthy , and  Cindi Leive  like to feel close to their worker-bees, Mayor Moss built his wall and is staying behind it, interviewing 'a slew of mid-level editors,' according to an insider."   He tore down the  translucent glass ? The  peasant ! Someone get  urlLink Stanley Crouch  to issue a beat down. Go  urlLink Fashionwire spies . Why did I just have so much fun on that esoteric subject? Does this mean  MossWatch ? We'll see.   Al Gore and Al Franken Launch -- with some difficulty -- Left Networks   The story is shaky, but  Al Gore  is  supposed  to be  urlLink buying News World International  (and with it, alas, the  CBC , some of the best investigative reporting into humanitarian efforts globally) early this week for roughly $70 million from various investors for his youth oriented liberal tv network. But the  urlLink story is changing fast , so it might not happen. Apparently, one -- or possibly more -- of the investors may have gotten cold feet.    urlLink Joe Hagan of The Observer  chronicles the long hard slough:  "It wasn’t easy for Mr. Gore to get his hands on  NWI . According to two sources familiar with the situation, Mr. Gore went so far as to seek the influence of  French President Jacques Chirac  in buying the channel, hoping that Mr. Chirac would aid him in landing a sweetened deal with  Vivendi  chief executive  Jean-René Fourtou —and quick. That request resulted in a meeting last summer with executives of  Universal Television Group  and Vivendi’s chief operating officer,  Jean-Bernard Levy . At the time, however, Vivendi was preparing to sell its cable properties to NBC, which temporarily stalled Mr. Gore’s media ambitions.  "The deal was delayed for nearly a year, most recently by  Barry Diller , chairman and chief executive of  InterActive Corp . As the former owner of  USA Networks , which he sold to  Vivendi  for $10 billion in 2001, Mr. Diller still owned a stake in those properties. Sources said Vivendi was keen on selling NWI to Mr. Gore, but Mr. Diller needed to resolve his ownership in Universal properties first. One source with knowledge of the situation suggested that Mr. Diller had stalled the deal as a bargaining chip to improve his take on Vivendi’s sale of Universal to NBC. But a spokeswoman for Mr. Diller disputed that. 'It was only Mr. Gore who asked us to reconsider, given how long the process was taking,' she said, 'to which we did agree to let this asset escape from our J.V. [joint venture], for no consideration of any kind or as part of any discussion with Vivendi.'"  "In any case, the path was cleared for Mr. Gore’s group to close the deal. It’s not clear where Mr. Gore and  Mr. Hyatt  rounded up the money, or how they will cover the gargantuan programming costs to come. But as you may recall, Mr. Gore’s first gig after the election of 2000 was becoming vice chairman of  Metropolitan West Financial Inc. , headquartered in Los Angeles, which hired him to explore high-tech investments. With the assistance of  Peter Knight , his former Democratic fund-raiser and a managing director at  Metropolitan West , Mr. Gore had access to scores of investors, according to sources close to him."  Related story from urlLink  The Independent's Andrew Gumbel :  "'Broadcasting from an underground bunker 3,500ft below  Dick Cheney's  bunker, Air America radio is on the air," announced  Al Franken , the comedian and Bush satirist who carries the weight of the new venture largely on his shoulders.  "At least, that is what he was supposed to have announced. Here in Los Angeles, one of a handful of major cities receiving the Air America signal on distinctly out-of-the-way stations, we got a dying blast of Mexican mariachi music, then an abortive programme announcement, then a lot of awkward silence followed by a few bars of the Beatles singing, 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand.'  "When  Al Franken's  noontime show finally aired, we were accidentally given the second hour first. The first hour came on third. There was, of course, the option of listening on the internet, but the server kept crashing because of listener overload.  "Teething troubles were perhaps inevitable in a venture of this size, but they were greeted with delight by conservative radio pundits who cannot wait to watch Mr Franken and his roster of celebrity colleagues fail."  Let's hope Al and Al are just going through "teething troubles." They can be expected in a new venture, but this is a lot in so short a perios.  Sloppy . Sometimes it seems -- especially after Arnold, the 2000 election and the midterms -- that the Left is in a very, very difficult position to get out of.     The Week Ahead:    Sunday : CB S' 60 Minutes  Bashes  Bush  again, for the third week in a row, leaving Our Frat Boy in Chief within an inch of his political life. This time:  urlLink A Toxic Chemical Cover Up .  "A government whistle-blower says the Bush administration covered up the reasons for a toxic coal slurry spill in Appalachia that ranks among the worst environmental disasters in U.S. history.   " urlLink Jack Spadaro  tells  Correspondent Bob Simon  that political appointees in the  Department of Labor  whitewashed a report that said an energy company that had contributed to the Republican Party was responsible for the 300-million gallon spill.   "Simon's report will be broadcast on  60 Minutes , Sunday, April 4, at 7 p.m. ET/PT"  So, did Bush kill  urlLink Don Hewitt's  granddaughter's pet bunny or something? I feel as if I'm missing some context; some  preamble . In other words: It's getting  a little personal  in herre ...  Not that we here at  The Corsair  are  pro-Bush  or anything, but sometimes one does feel sorry for the man who just wanted to clear his daddy's name (and, coincidentally his) from the word "one term failure." Now,  Leslie Stahl  willing, he will join  urlLink Poppy  fishing on Fidelity up in Kennebunkport, wondering what went wrong.  Now, Don, a little advice, if you want to keep your journalistic street cred, why don't you start doing some stories about corruptions in the Democratic Party --  you know they are there ; I know they are there. That way, by alternating the blame, you make what you say sound  credible . Otherwise, you just look to 1/2 of the country as being reflexively anti-Bush, which you are, and I am too, cornbread,   but we want to keep it on the down low, aint nobody have to know  ...

       A Little of the Old In and Out:    In :  urlLink Chris Martin Kicking A Bit O' Papparazzi Ass . I'm not a fan of the frosty  La Paltrow  (she's the type that ignored me) or  Martin's mellow Cold Play , but isn't it  Biology 101  that teaches us that primates get  fucking punchy  when strangers start acting all  aggro  while they are in the late stages of making a baby. So, I have a hard time shedding tears for the papparazi on the wrong end of Chris Martin's boots, as  urlLink Ananova  reports via  urlLink Sky News :  "'He kicked me from behind and I crashed to the ground,' (a) 34-year-old photographer said.  ( The Corsair  softly chuckles)  "'It was stupid, dangerous and violent. He seems to think it is OK for him to be violent to photographers because he is a celebrity.'  "( Alessandro Copetti ) has made a formal complaint to police about the alleged incident.  "A spokesman for Martin said the photographer had been 'aggressive' and had tripped as he ran after the couple's cab.   Kick him when he's down , Cold Player, that's the best time to kick a man threatening your family.   Out :   Monkey love . While we're on the subject of primates, well, not  on  them directly, but you get the picture,  I hope  -- let us speak on the love that none dare speak it's name ... ( sotto voce )  monkey love .  urlLink According to The National Enquirer , that significant cultural artifact, The Rock was accosted, in a disgusting manner, by some of our evolutionary cousins, on the set of last year's sleeper hit  urlLink 'The Rundown' :  " ... There were other representatives from the animal kingdom that perked up 'The  urlLink Rundown  set.   "The monkeys chosen for one key scene were adolescents in an 'almost permanent state of arousal' and they were constantly jumping on and off the actors, divulged  The Rock :   "'I can never look at a monkey the same way again.'"   They were trying to get a piece of the rock?     In :  Elaine's . Was it ever out?  urlLink Liz Smith writes , "HarperCollins moguls  Jane Friedman  and  Maureen O'Brien  were grinning from ear-to-ear. They feel they have a true winner in their Hotchner tale of how  urlLink Elaine Kaufman  did it almost entirely by herself, starting about 40 years ago. She opened her unpretentious and clubby cafe in 1963, and today it's still a nightly hit.   "'I was asked by  Fox New Channel's  fair and balanced reporters to tell what I like best about Elaine's. I said truthfully that I love the food and wouldn't order a veal chop anywhere else in America - except maybe at  Le Cirque .'"  Yeah, Liz, and I enjoyed the salmon at Elaine's too, back in the Clinton days. Alas,  urlLink lax mercury emissions  standards by the Bushies will keep me from "Elaine's salmon" (ahem,  so to speak ) for the forseable future ...   Out :  Washington Geeks . Okay, I am fascinated by Washington DC culture and the power plays that go on in that imperial capitol. I'm fascinated that cold reptilian calculation can land some irrelevant hayseed a Congressional seat, or the best lobbying game in town. But sometimes, every so often, an event just comes up  just really lets us know  that the affairs of our chic little empire are in the hands of pocket protector wearing pencil necked geeks and lobbyists -- not that I am a bigot. I love all kinds of people, provided they are funny. Why (gets dramatic)  some of my best friends are geeks!     Anyhoo : This is such an event, covered, diligently, by  urlLink The Hill , which is good on these sorts of things:  "Some 500 staffers will rise early on Sunday -- daylight-saving time and all -- in an effort to give their respective offices bragging rights in the  Credit Union Cherry Blossom Ten-Mile Run .  "Each year, some of the most spirited competition in the annual race is for the Capitol Hill team title the 'Capitol Hill Competition Cup' awarded to the four-person team with the best aggregate time.  "This year?s colorful entries from the Senate include  Dorgan's Dashers ,  Fritz's Last Run  from the Commerce Committee, the  Raucus Baucus Caucus , the  Couch Potatoes  from  Sen. Mike Crapo's  (R-Idaho) office, Levin Ya in the Dust, the Inappropriators from the Appropriations Committee, the Vermonsters from  Sen. Pat Leahy's  (D-Vt.) office and  Jeff's Joggers  from  Sen. Jeff Bingaman's  (D-N.M.) office.  Jesus  Fucking  Christ! Afterwards, the stewards of the global American Empire will retire to Senator Inoye's offices for some  Nescafe ,  urlLink Parcheesi  and  urlLink Monty Python videos , discussing who's hotter -- Jennifer Garner or Agent Mulder.  urlLink This truly is the revenge of the nerds  (note in the link: pony boy studs  Mo Rocca  and  Paul Wolfowitz  trading tips on bagging imperial debutantes).  Benson and Hedges  cigarettes will be smoked in abundance.    In :  urlLink Zbigniew Brzezinski's  auditioning hard for a Kerry  Secretary of State  position. Oh, so hard. Although his name is  Zbigniew Brzezinski , his friends call him  Zbig  (and although my name is  Ron Mwangaguhunga , my friends call me bubbles). Our Zbig Newton took a bit of a b"chewing out" at the hands of  urlLink The New York Review of Books , but it has not yet proven that anyone currently living still reads that publication. I mean, other than me (cops to some geekiness on that).   Out :  Serbia . The Powell Doctrine issued a  urlLink firm bitchslap  to Serbia this week. Apparently the Serbs don't yet realize that we are rapidly moving towards an era of international law, for they see serbia as beyond the law of nations. But the bitchslap and US withholding $25 million in aid must be rough ... trust me (rubs cheek ... ruefully)  I know whereof I speak  when I say Colin's bitchslaps ... can ....  sting  (shakes fist at computer screen) ... hypothetically, of course.    In! :  urlLink The Smokinggun collects  all the legal documents leading up to  Kurt Cobain's  suicide in honor (?) of the tenth anniversary. And, although it is more than a bit creepy, it is dry, like the law, and the best chronicle of all the participants involved in the tragedy.  urlLink Draw your own conclusions .  And, also  In :  urlLink Washingtonian socialite Deeda Blair is New York bound . In your face, Washington DC! (gives them the  urlLink gasface ) The Washington Post writes:  "The fact that longtime Washingtonian  urlLink Deeda Blair  and her husband,  William McCormick Blair Jr ., are selling their Foxhall Road home and moving to New York means that the capital will lose its most visible link to the rarefied world of international style.   "Washington has more than its share of boldface names and people of global importance. And it has a perfectly respectable number of well-dressed men and women who balance the whims of fashion with a strong sense of self. But  urlLink Deeda Blair , with her halo of gray streaked hair, sharp cheekbones and a confident posture that carries off everything from  Chanel  ruffles to  Chado  silk faille, has been, for more than four decades, the winning retort for those who defend Washington's honor against fashion insiders who deride the nation's capital as a scarred landscape overwhelmed by dowdiness and lacking in pulchritude."

       Sir John Gielgud: A Life in letters   All quotes below come from the new book,  urlLink John Gielgud, A Life in Letters, Introduced and Edited by Richard Mangan :  "27 June, 1976, to  Hugh Wheeler :  "I finally succumbed to play a small part for a lot of money in the  urlLink Caligula  of  urlLink Gore Vidal . Martin is very cross with me for accepting it as I was originally offered Tiberius (now to be played by  Peter O'Toole ) and my first scene was to come out of a pool, with a plaster over my nose and exzema all over my face, to reveal two children, boy and girl, emerging from under my tunic where they were dallying with me. So I loftily refused and had a stinkingly rude letter from Gore saying he supposed I'd never read Suetonius, and how dared I go round saying good actors would be ashamed to appear in such pornography. Then a week or two ago came an offer for this part -- a Senator who cuts his veins in his bath and disapproves of everything, and I thought, well, why not? What Vidal and I will say to each other if and when we meet, I tremble to prophesy. I must say I never liked him. (Caligula) is backed by the owner of  Penthouse  Magazine! ( Bob Guccione )"  "28 May to  George Pitcher  and  Ed Cone :  "I have agreed, after a certain amount of bribery, to come over to be in a film ( urlLink Arther ) with  urlLink Dudley Moore  -- my old butler image -- to be made on location in New York ... the picture is a bit common, it seems to me, trying, but not succeding, to be a kind of  Woody Allen  fantasy -- but my part is good and  might  perhaps be funny if the director (who also is the author of the script) is  urlLink clever . His name is  Steve Gordon .  urlLink Liza Minelli  is also to be in it. There are scenes in motorcars, Tiffany's, Bloomingdales, etc. I only pray it won't be too appalingly hot, as I am very prim and dressed up. I have a death scene in the hospital wearing a cowboy hat. Keep your derision for when you see the film."  "20 Oct 1996 to  Irene Worth :  "( urlLink Claire Bloom's ) book ( urlLink Leaving A Doll's House ) about her lovers and marriages has created something of a sensation. Very painful reading, but no doubt she needs the money badly. All the name dropping will sell it well, I'm sure. But sad."  "1995 20 Feb to  George Pitcher  and  Ed Cone :  "No work at the moment except for some odd recording jobs. Frightful gales and storms. I can;t help being riveted by the (O.J)  Simpson  trial. Martin gave me Sky (tv) where it is to be seen nightly, though he says I should be ashamed of myself for watching it."

       The Next Administration   It is Friday in New York City and the sky is dark and heavy, suggesting a pregnant pause before the storm. Armed with a half full glass of  urlLink Cutty Sark  and  urlLink Monteverdi  on the radio, politics is in my crosshairs.  So, who will win the Veepstakes on both sides? The Machiavellian undermining and backroom conniving is already in full swing (ah, K-Street:  your tax dollars at work ) just in time as the cherry blossoms blossom in Georgetown. I think we can all agree, with strategic winks and nods, dear readers, that  sometime within the next few months ,  Dick Cheney  will announce that because of "health issues" (wink, wink), he will step down as Vice President, just in time for an exciting convention in Manhattan wherein all manner of mystery will be unveiled.  Dubya  will then be forced to find someone -- anyone -- who can make up for those massive Electoral College votes from Cheney's powerhouse native state of  Wyoming  (softly chuckles); what will the President ever do without Wyoming.  So,  who ? The Bush family is dynastic, or, as  Kevin Phillips  says in his book  urlLink American Dynasty :  "The Bush family has never produced a doctor, teacher, scholar or lawyer of note. As far back as World War I, the family's single-minded focus has been on three major areas: intelligence, energy and national security. It is no coincidence that these three categories of Bush family operations were also three of the key enterprises of the American twentieth century."  That having been said, Bush will set the ground of inevitability for a  Jeb Bush  Presidency as soon as possible (if he achieves a second term). That's why  Rudy Giuliani  -- of the mercurial temperament, the maverick -- would be a bad choice: Rudy doesn't play well with others. But Giuliani did take care of  urlLink his messy marriage problem , marrying  Judith Nathan , which will please Bible Belters. And then there is the Republican Convention in New york, around the anniversary of 9/11. All of which suggest the inevitability of Rudy, who is New York royalty, the prestige-statesman factor alone is powerful.  But Giuliani cannot even deliver New york State, which leans heavily in favor of Kerry. Nor will he help the ticket with the conservative base. However, Rudy, an Ethnic Italian moderate could be of use with those all important Reagan Democrats, as he is considered a law and order moderate. Also, Giuliani has a ton of GOP IOU's from the mid term elections; elected Republicans all over the country would go to the mat for him in their districts. Finally -- and this is crass, forgive me -- the momentum of a convention coming off of 9/11 with Giuliani on the ticket would be massive.   Giuliani: 50-50 odds    Other players :   George Pataki :  Pro : An old Bush dynasty ally;  Con : Fucked up New York. Giuliani would be stronger.  90-1    urlLink Senator Danforth : Missouri is a swing state and, for some reason, this guy popped into my head. Great speaker. An honest man. Evangelical. Likeable.  75-1    Colin Powell : This would be a desperate Hail Mary Pass, but very, very possible. It would throw off the neocon power base and realign all manner of forces. One of those forces would be what the fuck would Democrats do if African Americans defected to the GOP. I mean, hey, there isn't a single African American senator, and look at all the plum jobs that blacks get with Republicans. Powell is dangerously popular, fiercely loyal to the Bush dynasty, and --  bonus!  --  Alma Powell  will not allow him to run for the Presidency, setting things up for Jeb in 2008. Possibly as much prestige as Giuliani.  50-50    Wild Card : There is always the possibility of a wild card that no one can predict. A business titan? (Not likely, not in this Enron climate). Chances are that if there is a wild card, he or she will be old and will come from Missouri, New Mexico, New Hampshire, Oregon or Ohio. And what of California and the Shwarzenegger factor: Is Cali in play?  65-1

       The Next Secretary of State    Democrats    Walter Isaacson : It may not yet be his time. Wise, Aspen leader. N'Orleans Democrat with Founding Father best seller and media-philosophy cred.  85-1    Zbigniew Brzezinski : This man's name is more complicated than mine -- and that's a feat. He is auditioning hard with  urlLink his new tome , which took a bit of an ass whipping in the  urlLink New York Review of Books . He is unbelieveably brash for a man who armed  urlLink the Mujahadein . A little too inside for Kerry to get away with appointing, then again, Jimmy Carter broke everyone's heart when he campaigned as a  urlLink peanut farming outsider , then appointed the ultimate Trilateralist insider  urlLink Cyrus Vance  to State.  65-1    Richard Holbrooke : No one wants State more than Ambassador Holbrooke. And, while we are on the subject, since when do UN Ambassadors  urlLink go out with Diane Sawyer ? Huh,  urlLink Dick ?  urlLink Impressive resume . Holbrooke is a master operator and a player who cultivates the air of inevitability that he will ultimately be the Secretary of State of the US, the world's last standing superpower, astride the globe like a mighty colossus.  50-50    urlLink Jamie Rubin : It may not be his time yet. He is too young, the  John Edwards  of the foreign policy elite set.  urlLink Madeline Albright's pretty toy boy . A lock as possible UN Ambassador under Kerry. Hedged his bets on  urlLink Wesley Clarke , and lost. Side note: His wife,  Christiane Amanpour , may be the most important television journalist, and he himself is on the fast track to UN Ambassador, State, and, possibly, UN Secretary General.  This is the glamour couple for the next age: The Age of International Law.  95-1    urlLink Gary Hart : This is my favorite choice, because now that Daniel Patrick Moynihan has passed on, no one is wiser or more intelligent on such a wide variety of subjects than Hart. And he gets along well with Kerry. Affairs will not matter at State, although you can be sure convoluted arguments will come from the Bible Belt ("hey, his past infidelities could be used as against you by a foreign spy.")  50-50    Republicans   Now this here is the only game in town. Three major figures want this post:   urlLink Newt Gingrich : A favorite of the Hawkish conservatives. So ambitious that he  urlLink attacked  Colin Powell in the  urlLink neocon rags . While still sitting at State. Oh, it was on like  urlLink Gray Poupon ! An enemy of  George Bush the Elder , which may hurt his chances of advancing in the Bush dynasty. Poppy still has juice.  50-50    James Baker : You don't get any oilier than  urlLink James E. Baker , who allegedly called Arabs, "sand ni**ers at a cabinet meeting." Baker is the dirtiest player in the game. Reeks of thwarted ambition. Why was George Bush, that punk President and he -- he, the mastermind -- secretary of state?! And only for part of the term at that! An unfinished Secretary of State stewardship, helping your Poppy's reelection: come on Dubya,  you owe me .  50-50    Paul Bremer : A Bush favorite. Close with the Dynasty. His fortunes within the dynasty depend  entirely  upon the Iraqi power handoff, and whether he scores, or drops the ball. Slim chance.  90-1

       The Democratic Party Veepstakes   Ever since  urlLink NBC News Chief Foreign Affairs Correspondent Andrea Mitchell , a graduate student in power, the wife of Fed Reserve Chief  Allan Greenspan , suggested that  urlLink Hillary Clinton wants the veep slot , it has been hers to lose.   The problem with Hillary is that she doesn't bring much to the ticket. Kerry does well with women. Kerry will win New York. Kerry will win the Northeast. In a way, Hillary woudl have been much more useful to the ticket had she run for the Senate seat in Arkansas, where a Southern base would mark her head and shoulders above the sunny and potimistic bright Senator  John Edwards , which, quite frankly, she is not. The problem with Hillary is that she was too tepid, she didn't run; Edwards did -- and thus, among many, he should get the nod,  it's his turn .   Hillary Odds: 50-50    John Edwards : Neck and neck with Hill. Pro: Electoral College votes. A bombshell convention speech in Prime time to show off his looks. A player in the party to come.  50-50    urlLink Max Cleland .  The Corsair  believes that he is the likely choice for a running mate.  Pros:  From Georgia, brings the South back into the mix ... former Senator ... triple amutee war hero would make a strong veterans campaign with Kerry --  and Vets are liely Republican voters  ... expert on Homeland Security (big plus, as national security is a Republican stronghold) which Bill Clinton in a closed door meeting warned that the nominee must be strong on ... strong on health care ... could humiliate chicken hawk Cheney in a debate  Cons : Health might be an issue. ( ed note: Feb 14, 2004 : it's a fucking long ass sojourn through the country for a Veep, from Labor Day till the election -- can Cleland do it? I think so.  Odds on favorite )   urlLink Gary Hart   Pros : Vast intellect, PhD, Oxford, Political Philosophy ... wise from his time out in the political wilderness ... Strong in the Southwest ... devastating debator  Cons : Old adultery charge may still stick in the Bible Belt ... may be more useful to the Democratic Party in a Senate bid against the very weak  Ben Knighthorse Campbell  ( note : Campbell  will not  seek relection) ... Possible Secretary of State, a la his hero, Jefferson ( ed note: Feb 14, 2004 )   urlLink Bill Richardson  Pros: Governor of ultra-crucial New Mexico ... Latino ... former UN Ambassador and  urlLink seasoned diplomat  would give international cooperation credit points to ticket   Cons : None. ( ed note: Feb 14, 2004 : hot like salsa)   urlLink Wesley Clark  Pros: Longshot, but if he wins big in Oklahoma and the conservative Southwest he could be in the cut ... General would give strong military backing to ticket ... would humiliate chickenhawk Cheney in a debate ... strong with African-Americans   Cons : Too closely tied to Bill Clinton, who wants Hillary '08, which may be an issue. ( ed note: Feb 14, 2004 : Wes is bitter as the Clintonistas dumped his ass as soon as he started looking like yesterday's donuts. Could be Sec of Defense in a Kerry White House. An effective military attack dog. Will work well with a Cleland Veep)   urlLink Dick Gephardt   Pros : Outside of Cleland and Edwards, the most likely running mate ... most popular pol in pivotal swing state Missouri ... would be perfect for a Kerry-Gephardt Northern labor-veterans strategy against a Bush South ... comes with the backing of labor, a Democratic must needs ... a truly good guy who dropped out and endorsed Kerry early:  he did the right thing   Cons : Wooden on the stump,  charismatically challenged  (ed note: Feb 14, 2004: this ticket may be too damn Northern top heavy. Could be the  greatest  and  most powerful  Sec of Labor in US history in a Kerry White House)   urlLink Evan Bayh  Pros: Young up and comer, popular moderate Democrat from a Republican state ... would look good stumping with Kerry ... strong political family ... Would play well in Bush states ... hugely ambitious for national office, a quick study   Cons : A long shot ... may not even be able to deliver Indiana, his home state, against Bush ( ed note: Feb 14, 2004 : not bloody likely, but it would harken to the Tom Sawyer-Huck Finnish days of Clinton-Gore '92)   urlLink Bob Graham   Pros : Most Aggressively Campaigning for this position ... got out early ... most popular elected official in CRUCIAL Florida ... Senate Intelligence Committee  Cons : Bad ticker ... charisma challenged. (ed note: Feb 14, 2004: The Corsair believes that Graham, who lusts after this position so badly that our computer screen is blurred, prolly had a deal with the Dean peeps, so he may be radioactive to Kerry; then again loyalty, in politics, is  urlLink mobile, like la donna )

But, they had to be shelled.   "So each night I had to spend 45 minutes to an hour shelling all these pistachio nuts for him. I did that on all three nights.

      originally published Feb 25   President Bush and Dick Cheney: A Dialogue   It's no secret that  Dick Cheney  is  urlLink not a popular man  throughout the land.  urlLink Even his daughter  may have something to say about the Administration's ban on gay marriage. In fact, many  urlLink consider him too powerful . But now that polls show  urlLink Bush trailing potential challengers   John Edwards  and  John Kerry , he may want to consider a stronger ticket. In other words, could  urlLink Dubya  ask Cheney to step down "for the good of the party"? You know, a "health related" stepping down. Is Bush powerful enough? Here's a little imagined dialogue of possibility:   Cheney : Mr. President?   Dubya : Good to see you, Dickster, hows the ticker doin'?   Cheney : Oh, fine, sir; got a clean bill of health.   Dubya : Oh, is that so (sly smile plays on his lips). Are ya sure you wouldn't want to take some time off?   Cheney : Sir?   Dubya : You know, like the  entire second term .    Cheney : (dumbfounded) Wh- aat ?   Dubya : Well, it's this war thing, Dickie, sorry to say. Nothing personal. If Kerry picks someone like  urlLink former Senator Cleland  and runs as a veteran who cares, then we are in  deep doo doo . I can't run on a  urlLink National Security platform  down south if they start rallying vets against you for being such a goddamned  urlLink chicken hawk    Cheney : But, sir, I object, I --   Dubya : No, I know you aren't a goddamned chicken hawk, Dick. Wouldn't have asked you to join the ticket if you were. But politics is about  the perception . How else do you think I  urlLink broke John McCain in South Carolina  in 2000?   Cheney : But I was Defense Secretary --    Dubya : Speaking of that. Didn't you administer pop's First Persian Gulf War?   Cheney : (puffs up) Why yes, I did indeed.   Dubya : And who was the general in the field, he had a funny name.  Polish  or somethin'   Cheney : (nervous) Shwarzkopf, er ...  urlLink Norman Shwarzkopf .   Dubya : (smiles) Stormin' Norman, I like that. See that, Dickie, we've already got a nickname for him.   Cheney : But, sir --   Dubya :  And he's from Florida , isn't he?   Cheney : Uhm, yes, sir --   Dubya : Perfect (reaches for a pretzel). Him or  urlLink Giuliani  would be just the ticket for the ticket.  Giuliani  at the New York convention would be perfect. I'd campaign in the South, and Rudy would just stay right there in the tri state area of NY, Jersey and Connecticut.   Cheney : (desperation) But, if I may speak frankly, what about Wyoming, sir. You couldn't have swept that state without  me  on the ticket.   Dubya : I guess we'll just have to manage Wyoming's whopping three electoral college votes without ya, Dickster. A vacation is a good thing. Sound mind and all that.  Wishful thinking on The Corsair's part?

       Heidi Fleiss versus Jamie Lynn DiScala   That significant cultural artifact  urlLink The Star  fuels a mini-celebrity catfight. Uhm, okay, strike that: make that a quasi-celebrity B-List catfight,  to be exact , cornbread. Former Hollywood Madam and current lingerie shopkeeper  Heidi Fleiss  apparently didn't like  Jamie Lynn DiScala's  (AKA,  Meadow Soprano : we know, that whole DiScala thing threw us, too) portrayal of her life.  urlLink Star reporters Brenda You & Jennifer Birn  note:  "To get into character, Jamie-Lynn 'did a lot of research -- watching documentaries, reading Heidi's book, poring over articles about her,' she says. 'I also had to lose some weight. I stopped weight training so I could have a frail frame because Heidi was notorious for her figure and how small she was.' That wasn't the only difference. "I've never had any experience with drugs,' adds Jamie-Lynn. 'So I had to do a lot of research on the effects of [drugs].' Fleiss was a documented user."  And Heidi's response to the dedicated Jamie?  " ... Fleiss, 38, the real-life 'Hollywood Madam' who spent 21 months in prison after her prostitution ring was busted in 1993, tells Star she is miffed over being played by the HBO starlet. 'My [movie] deal is with  Paramount Studios  and  Nicole Kidman ,' claims Fleiss. 'I've read what  Jamie-Lynn  has to say and it's obvious she doesn't have a clue who I am!' she continues. 'I'm big-time. I'm not a made-for-TV movie. I'm big-screen, baby.'"  It's all Hollywood, baby, but just in case Fleiss might want to watch out for 300-lb goomba's wielding telephone books and Saturday Night Specials (yes, I pilfered that reference from gritty 70s urban dramas like  urlLink Good Times ).  So, Kick back, break out the  urlLink Riunite on Ice , and weigh in your thoughts on my little bitty post on the  VH1 Best Week Ever  blog right  urlLink here

       Congressional Diva and Jacko    The Corsair  hears that  tout le  power players in Washington DC -- that imperial capitol -- is abuzz over  Jacko's  visit to Reprentative  Sheila Jackson Lee  ( D-Texas).  urlLink Sam Dealey of The Hill  writes of the  urlLink eventoid :  "Denizens of the Rayburn House Office Building’s fourth floor were sent into a tizzy Tuesday night when  urlLink Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee  (D-Texas) made what they regarded as an outrageous after-hours demand.   "In anticipation of pop icon  Michael Jackson’s  controversial visit with the congresswoman, Jackson Lee’s staff gave short notice to her Rayburn neighbors that their hallway would be closed the next day from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Offices were told they must submit beforehand a list of visitors expected during that eight-hour timeframe and that the Capitol Police would bar any unannounced visitors."  "Jackson met yesterday with Jackson Lee and several African ambassadors in a session that began nearly an hour behind schedule. The pop star, who faces felony charges for sexual molestation of minors, has decried the AIDS epidemic during his brief visit to the Capitol."  And  urlLink Wonkette  reports, "Says one GOP aide, 'Just because the self-proclaimed Queen wants to meet the self- proclaimed King doesn’t mean she can shut down the hallway.'"    urlLink Michael Janofsky of the New York Times  said of the visit, "Hallways were packed. Security was tight. Photographers were poised everywhere."  Not since  Clooney  and  Soderberg  stunk up the town on  urlLink K-Street , making all the big haired Georgetown socialites and blousy Congressional paige's and lobbyist women swoon ...

       Page Six Blind Item Guess   Once again,  urlLink the most excellent Page Six  has set  urlLink tongues a wagging in the blogosphere  with their blind items.  urlLink The Sixers write today :  "WHICH plucky pop tart lived up to her bad-girl image with some X-rated action at the recent World Music Awards in Monaco? We're told that the songbird was invited to an orgy by a certain sex-obsessed aristocrat, who ended up with a royal pain after the singer used a sex toy on him. Our heroine coyly referred to the unprintable incident by telling reporters she had a 'strapping good time in Monaco.'"   Sex-obsessed aristocrat is easy:  urlLink Prince Albert of Monaco . Now, who is the songbird?  Let's work this out together: the key words here are "plucky pop tart," and "strapping good time," those are they keys, respectively, to the nature of the singer, and her sense of humor.  My guess -- and this is just a guess to all those slap happy lawyers out there --- is that this is  urlLink Mariah Carey , and don't ask me why I made this guess.  urlLink She  seems more Albert's type than  urlLink Dido  or  urlLink Pink , who also attended. I could be wrong, though.  Yo,  Chris Wilson , Most excellent  urlLink  Page Sixer , if you're reading this, hook a brother up on the DL, nah mean?

       A Bit of the Old In and Out     In :  Brian Lamb  reads at least 52 books a year. In today's  urlLink WashingtonPost.com chat , everyone's favorite and cuddly government geek confessed, "I read a book a week, 52 guests a year." Now, why did we  already suspect  that interesting little piece of info? The next time we need setting straight on the administration of  James Knox Polk , Bri Guy will be the one we talk to first.   Out : Curry in a hurry; the flavors of Bombay.  Michael Caine  is opening a curry restaurant. Why does a 71 year old British Lord, wealthy beyond all measure, famous, and  still getting acting roles  want the bother with  urlLink the spice ? I can't tell you, but  urlLink Ananova  notes, "Sir Michael, 71, said: 'I have been out of the restaurant business for quite a few years.  "'This particular project is the first venture that has excited me enough to get back into the business, and I am really looking forward to it.'"  Sounds  excellent  (said with a high sarcasm), now why don't you get me some mango chutney to go with this flavorful feast?   In :  Happy April Fool's Day /  Happy Birthday : Novelist  urlLink Milan Kundera  turns 75 today. Born on April Fools Day? Draw your own conclusions, keemo sabe.   Out :  urlLink Tina Brown on Richard Clarke's  9/11 Commission testimony. "... His was a reality show, but it was also reality. People may have had a hard time identifying with  urlLink Paul O'Neill's  abortive adventure at Treasury -- a high-priced CEO who made a bad career choice, he never lost the aroma of the boardroom -- but Clarke, for all his scary IQ, is somebody we recognize. Every office has someone like him, a super-competent guy whose big, square, argumentative head you learn to dread when it appears around the door announcing bad news."  "Big, square argumentative head"? Hey, sister (balls up fists, acts punchy, like Robert Blake in Baretta), you better watch-who-you're-talking-to with that (struts)  fake Upper Crust British Accent ! My head's not big ... it, just -- you know -- it  has to contain a lot more info than regular folks , like. Yeah, that's it; that's my story and I'm sticking to it.   And just what (cattily)  precisely  does the aroma of the boardroom smell like, huh? Teen spirit? My guess: hookers and blow.   In : The Passion of The Mel.  urlLink Cindy Adams  relates the latest Mel Gibson quote involving violence and martyrdom, from the People Magazine 30th Anniversary issue. His defining moment? "Watching his toddler Hannah toddle onto a street 'with traffic flying by.' He "knocked old ladies out of the way, ran through glass cabinets, jumped over everything and grabbed her just as she was stepping into the street. I think I s- - - my pants."   Nice  image, Mel.

For those of you who can't get enough of meta-media navel gazing, and I can't, here's an  urlLink ironic twist  and a link to editor Lou Grant's blog.  Most best :  " Howell Raines  signed a three figure deal with  Reaganbooks  to pen the inside story of his stewardship of the New York Times as managing editor. 'I've been holding back, but this will let me lift the veil on the Grey Lady and how the bitch led me on but never put out for my genius,' he said. The initial printing of 50 books is slated for early winter of '05."  That Old Grey Lady:  la donna e mobile .   Out :  urlLink The New York Press .  As someone who used to write for them, I know whereof I speak when I say that the New York Press is irrelevant. Worse, they seem to be under the illusion that blogs are the irrelevant, and they are still influential. The Press attacks  urlLink Choire Sicha ,  urlLink Elizabeth Spiers , and basically all of us, through  Lloyd Grove , who sometimes reports on the blogosphere.   The Corsair  passes by filled boxes on the sidewalks of Manhattan, and I have not for years now seen anyone taking one, or even carrying one with him on his travels.  urlLink Back when it was cool , The Press was a factor.  Again,  urlLink as someone who has written for The Press , trust me. It has become an Eastern European literary rag.   In : Fashion designer  Jenni Kayne  made a big impression on LA's fashion week. Accordijng to  urlLink Fashionweekdaily , "She’s only 21, but Jenni Kayne – the FAO Schwartz heiress-turned-designer – pulled in fashion week’s hottest crowd to date, and her clothes stood up to her star power."  And star power she has ... just ask  Dustin Hoffman , who brought his whole family to check out her show "'My son Jake went to high school with Jenni,' ... I left the  John Kerry  benefit to come here with my kids and support her. I even missed Kerry’s speech.'”   Out : Me, apparently; I'm out.  urlLink Anonymous Outsider  puts me in my place. Okay, so I love  Michael Musto 's column and have been a reader for nearly a decade. Boy-o-boy, did he get me (throws in the towel). Oh well (smiles), I'll work hard in the next few months to "regain the eye of the tiger." Anonymous Outsider does a nice job on the media, check him -- or her -- out  urlLink here .    In : The very cool  urlLink Old Hag  and me are both looking forward to Tom Perrotta's new book,  urlLink Little Children .   Out : The It Bag. I'm not sure what that means, but my guess is that it has something to do with  Louis Vuitton .  Joel Schumacher , the man who singlehandedly destroyed the Batman movie franchise waxes metaphysical on fashion, "Who picks the 'It Bag'? My friend  Minnie Driver  told me the designers pick out about 12 girls and give them the bag. And then everybody wants it -- then they make it scarce. Is that true? Does that really work? Is that all there is to it? The movie business should try that."  Oh yeah, well my pal  Minnie Ho  said  urlLink casting Clooney as Batman was a sucky executive decision .   In : Costars fucking. Call me naive, but I never got how actors could slip in and out of the beds of their costars, now -- voila! --  urlLink Mickey Knox, in The Good The Bad and the Dolce Vita  (published, ironically by  Nation Books , as in  Nation Magazine ) gives the most solid explanation:  "Sooner rather than later costars fuck. It makes life much easier working together, rubs the rough edges off ego clashes, and together they have the power to protect themselves against the vagaries of the director or producer."   Now I understand Hollywood .

       Rachel Hunter on the State of Supermodels   In  urlLink People Magazine's  Scoop section, former supermodel (does one ever truly lose the status?) and MILF hottie  urlLink Stacey's Mom ,  Rachel Hunter  summed up the talent in the roo:   People : Has modelling changed a lot since you started?   Rachel Hunter : How I was discovered was, I was on the beach. And that's how they find girls. It wasn't these determined little 13 year olds who are like this, 'This is what I want to do.' That scares me -- that this is what we're breeding.   Okay ; walking around the bitterness inherent in that statement, Rachel, actually,  The Corsair  is more scared at the idea of modelling scouts patrolling beaches for 13-year old girls than the determined teens.  And, on the QT, Rachel Hunter is dating  Anthoney de Rothschild , who is nine years younger.  urlLink According to Ananova , she met him "while promoting Ultimo gel-filled bras in London ... Anthony is the son of  urlLink Sir Evelyn de Rothschild  and is heir to a £300 million fortune."  Britain's  urlLink 3 AM Girls , as usual, put it all into context, ""He is a very good catch. But you can see why he's so taken with Rachel. She makes a change to the upper class girls who may only be after his money."  Earlier in the article, the 3 AM Girls conclude, "And this one is worth more than exes  Rod Stewart  and  Robbie Williams  put together."

       Cissy Houston To Hold Harlem Prayer Vigil For Whitney   I swear to God, Fox's  Roger Friedman  is the blackest white man in the entertainment reporting business. Today he gives us the scoop on  Whitney Houston , with a little blue eyed soul. He writes:  " Whitney Houston's  mother is taking a stand on her children's substance abuse problems.   " Cissy Houston , the great R&B and gospel singer, is leading a prayer vigil next Monday night in Harlem. In a simple announcement on New York radio station KISS-FM Houston called the two-hour event 'mothers praying for healing.'   "'Let us pray for healing and deliverance,' Houston said in the recorded message, 'for our children affected by substance abuse.'   "The event will held from 7 to 9 p.m. at the  urlLink Abyssinian Baptist Church . Sources tell me that by Monday Houston and others involved in the planning should have quite a team of performers, celebrities and clergy who will participate. My guess is that Cissy's cousins  Dionne  and  Dee Dee Warwick , as well as many other notables, will attend."  Shouldn't Dionne have predicted this?   I mean, isn't that what friends are for?  My guess is  Al Sharpton ,  Lennox Lewis ,  Mike Tyson ,  Janet Jackson , and various members of  New Edition  will be in attendance.   The Corsair  wishes Whitney good luck.

       Alistair Cooke of Masterpiece Theater Dies At 95   Some of my earliest and most poignant memories of childhood in the 1970s as an emigre involve the  urlLink UN School  where, I think, I get my sense of internationalism, as well as  urlLink PBS' Masterpiece Theater , where I came away with the feeling that dramatic tragedy is of great human dignity. To this day I prefer drama to comedy. And don't ask me where I got my love of gossip.    urlLink The AP sadly reports  today:  " Alistair Cooke , the broadcaster who epitomized highbrow television as host of 'Masterpiece Theatre' and whose 'Letter from America' was a radio fixture in Britain for 58 years, has died, the British Broadcasting Corp. said Tuesday. He was 95.   "Cooke died at his home in New York at midnight, a spokeswoman at the BBC's press office said. No cause of death was given, but Cooke had retired earlier this month because of heart disease."   Alistair Cooke  was the ultimate cultural ambassador of British soft power.  Joe E. Sheldon  -- bless his heart -- mailed me just last week one of the first  urlLink Masterpiece Theater's ,  Last of the Mohicans , which  urlLink I had been complaining about  for years about for years. It was absolutely marvelous.  It would be impossible to name my favorites, whether  urlLink I, Claudius , or  urlLink First Churchills  (fuck, I can hear ringing in the chambers of my mind  urlLink Purcell's Music for Queen Mary II , the theme of Churchills) or  urlLink Upstairs Downstairs . Each were introduced by the cultural ambassador with a twinkling eye and a dry comment on the behavior of the characters. "What fools these mortals be," Cooke seemed to be saying, at the beginning and at the end of these high dramas.   I met my first love (okay, first crush, as I was 7) over a discussion in the school yard at the UN School of  urlLink The Dutchess of Duke Street , back in the late 70s, when Masterpiece Theater was in full power. Sera was a precocious girl, and I hear she's making indie films in Mallorca now (*sighs* at the reddish bronze twilight memory of first love and Masterpiece Theater).  And ever since the mid 70s, Masterpiece Theater has been more or less a source of joy.   Cooke left in 1992, followed by Baker, and soon after The Soprano's took over the 9pm slot in the "must see tv" sweepstakes. I never quite cottoned to Cooke's replacement,  urlLink Russell Baker . Baker never seemed to love the classics as much as Cooke. In Baker's intro's he seemed more taken with the language and his lofty position than the drama, than the grand statements being made. Baker posed like a curmudgeon while Cooke was the real deal. There was never a host of high drama as equal to the task as Alistair Cooke.  "'He was really one of the greatest broadcasters of all time, and we shall feel his loss very, very keenly indeed,' UK Prime Minister  Tony Blair  said, summing up the feelings of all in the room.

Clarke's  critique of Bush, National Security Adviser  Condoleezza Rice  and other administration figures in 'Against All Enemies.'  "Woodward's book, to be released next month, will receive not only a multipart series in The Washington Post, but also the  Mike Wallace  treatment on '60 Minutes' April 18 - when I am absolutely confident that the common corporate ownership of CBS and Woodward's publisher, Simon & Schuster, will be mentioned."   Out :  The New Republic's  blowhard literary editor  urlLink Leon Wieseltier  ("the weasel") made an appearance on  urlLink The Soprano's on Sunday . "They got the SL," he shouts, impotently, into the night, as Mobsters steal his car "do you know how long my brother was on the waiting list for that thing?" And do you know how long bossman  urlLink Marty Peretz  has been waiting for his  urlLink star pupil Al Gore to be President ? You don't always get whatcha want, Leon.   In : Alcohol-infused and bloated  Jason Patric , former paramour of  Julia Roberts  was arrested in texas, according to  urlLink TheSmokinggun :  "Actor  urlLink Jason Patric  was busted by Texas cops early yesterday and charged with misdemeanor counts of resisting arrest and public intoxication. The 37-year-old thespian smelled of alcohol and fought with police after they tried to cuff him, according to the below probable cause affidavit filed in the City of Austin Municipal Court. Patric's trouble began at 2:45 AM when he mocked a patrolman who sought to clear large crowd of pedestrians out of a roadway. Asked if he had a problem complying with the police directive, Patric 'assumed an aggressive stance.' That, of course, is never a good idea when dealing with the fuzz. In short order, Patric tussled with the officer and fell to the ground with the cop (where he was eventually cuffed). Patric, in the Lone Star State for the premiere of his new film 'The Alamo,' was booked into the Travis County Jail."  Damn. Remember when he used to  urlLink romance Christy Turlington ? According to the  urlLink Affadavit for Warrant of Arrest and Detention , the Alamo star "exhibited the following conditions," odor of alcohol, dilated pupils, and other Aggressive and fighting with police officers. Oh my god ... is Jason Patric  me ?   Out :  Nicky Hilton  versus  Shannen Doherty ?  urlLink Fashionweekdaily reports  of the swishy  Tom Ford  show on Rodeo Drive, " Nicky Hilton  worked the arrivals line for  Marie Claire  and  E!

I though Shannon's arch enemy was her sister,  Paris ? Who can keep track. Mais ca ne fait rien:  Catfight!    In : Pork, the new white meat. According to  urlLink The Hill's    Hans Nichols  and  Johnathan E. Kaplan , "House Republicans could learn some valuable political lessons from their Democratic counterparts when it comes to carving out the big slices of pork stuffed into the pending $275 billion transportation bill.  "In an apparently deft maneuver, the Democrats are allocating, on average, some $10 million more to their most vulnerable members than have the Republicans."  I don't know whether to applaud or hold my nose.   Out :  urlLink Georgia Senator Zell Miller , and good riddance, ya ole crab apple. Was he ever a Democrat?

He's just mad because his parents named him Zell,  thanks for sharing .   In : Is Georgia freshman Rep. Denise Majette the new democratic party superstar? According to TheHill's  Peter Savodnik  and  Michael Rochmes , "Rep.  Denise Majette  (D) announced yesterday that she would run for the Senate seat held by retiring  Zell Miller  (D).  "Her candidacy stunned lawmakers from both parties, some of whom voiced skepticism that the freshman House member could win in an increasingly Republican state."  For all the hooplah about Georgia being a conservative state, current census figures also have the population at about 30 percent African American. Alas, there have been fewer than half a dozen African American senators in the history of the United States. Could Denise Majette be the next?   Out : The New York Times'  Neil Strauss , who left the nytimes to pursue a career in porn, screenwriting  and ghostwriting, gives coinage to the new verb (a la Corsair), to Strauss, "To use an Old Gray Lady in Order to pick up Young Bloonde Ladies."   urlLink Jack Shaeffer of Slate  (link via  urlLink Gawker ) has a whole bunch of verbs using Ny Times bylines, like, "To Sulzberger: To maintain a great distance between one's rhetoric and one's wallet.

       Halle Berry Injured: Again?!   An injury prone  Halle Barre .  urlLink According to Rush and Molloy , back from vacation (welcome back!), is injured -- again:  "Halle Berry's ear infection is wreaking havok with her career.  The Oscar-winner's doctor forbid her from flying to Vegas to pick up the Female Star of the Year award Thursday at the ShoWest convention of movie exhibitors.   "Now, her aural trouble has forced her to drop out of the cast of the HBO drama 'Lackawanna Blues,' based on  Ruben Santiago-Hudson's  play about the boarders in a riotous rooming house in upstate Lackawanna.   Berry broke her arm during  urlLink Gothika , as  urlLink theAge reports ,"Halfway through filming the movie, she broke her arm in a scene with co-star Robert Downey Jr, bringing the film to a screeching halt for four weeks. Upon her return, she worked for six weeks with a camouflaged cast on her right arm."  Downey joked, "I'm always willing to accept blame for anything that happens within 50 miles of me, but in this case, I felt so glad that I was sober when it happened, (because when I'm not) everything on Earth would be my fault."   And then there was Catwoman. Kron (no relation)  urlLink channel 4 reported  at the time, "Halle Berry was taken to a hospital after colliding with a piece of set equipment while filming a running scene for "Catwoman" but is now back at work, production spokesman Joe Everett said.   "The accident was quite minor, Everett said Tuesday, denying reports that the Oscar-winning actress was hit in the head with a microphone boon and spent six hours in a hospital waiting room."  And then, who can forget the car accident?  urlLink The Seattle Times can't , "For the record, the actress was cited for leaving the scene of a car accident in February 2000 on the Sunset Strip. She said at the time that she hit her head and has no memory of speeding away from the scene. She was fined $13,500 and ordered to serve 200 hours of community service.   It proved to be a wake-up call for Berry, who said she changed everything in her life after that.   "I really believe you manifest what you think, and I was thinking all wrong before the accident," she said. "Since then, I've started thinking that life is good and that I deserve all the good things that are happening to me."

       On The First Lady as the Embodiment of American Soft Power   Let us begin at the beginning, and in the beginning was  urlLink Lucy , the hottest chick in her day, albeit a little short for my tastes at 3 feet, 7 inches tall (then again -- hey -- horizontally, aren't we  all  the same height). Fast forward to First Ladies, dear readers: for just as foreign policy considerations -- especially those concerning allies -- ought to be led off with the carrot before resorting to the whip, so too should we not discount the importance of  urlLink soft power . And, as the last standing world superpower, the First Lady is the embodiment of our overwhelming soft power.   urlLink The anxiety of influence  of being First Lady (ask  urlLink Hillary  about that) comes in coming after  urlLink Jackie O . In the days of  urlLink Eleanor Roosevelt  and the  Great Depression  it was enough to be a humanitarian, the times warranted displays compassion, while the President conveyed a steely command of the Republic. And in the days of post-World War II post-Cold War tensions, it was enough to be a  urlLink June Cleaver  clone, like  urlLink Mrs. Eisenhower .    urlLink Jackie O , pre-Greece, pre-anti-Apartheid Mandela backer  Maurice Templesman , was the epitome of insular American chic. She was a product of the  urlLink Fifth Avenue and East End ,  urlLink Virginia hunt club horsey set  and Vassar; a French-educated  urlLink Debutante of the Year , 1948, was perfectly suited to physically represent American culture in the age of intense competition against the Soviet Union.  American Capitalism was good  -- just look to Jackie, we seemed to be telling the world.  The long shadow of Jackie O -- which runs continuously and unbroken throughout the latter half of the 20th century (just ask Hillary, who, after Health Care tanked, went with  urlLink the pink pearls Barbara Bush look  for a while), shading the cherry blossoms in Washington.  urlLink Theresa Heinz Kerry  is in a unique position to break this shadow-prison and lead us to the next age -- an age of universal law, transparency, democracy and international cooperation.  Heinz presents a sophisticated image with her Swiss-Mozambique accented english, her  urlLink Old Master painting collection , her  urlLink deep study of yoga  and her  urlLink multilingualism  -- she speaks 5 languages -- as well as an advocacy of literature, not just a librarian's inquisitiveness. Just as  Jackie O  classed up the joint with invites to  urlLink Malreaux  and  urlLink Pablo Casals , who played Bach cello suites (has DC ever been so fucking cool?) in the White House, I believe Americans are goddamned sick of all the country music (even those from Kentucky) and want a First Lady to demonstrate American Soft Power, our cultural riches (and, quite frankly the classical music industry could really,  urlLink really use the help ) that arise from our ability to  synthesize and blend all the arts and philosophies of the world into our melting pot . Liberalism and art should be stressed against the pathetic, moribund Anglophilia of the conservative movement, with that faint musty odor of Brideshead Revisited ("yes,  urlLink Chardin  was a fine painter, and  urlLink Elgar  a good composer, but what about the American  urlLink John Singer Sargent  and listening to  urlLink John Cage  on a rainy night after some fine weed?"). God bless America, break out the jazz, thank you very much!  We have rogue ambassadors, hot Hollywood actresses like  urlLink Angelina Jolie  and  urlLink Julia Roberts , who travel to Third World countries trading their celebrity to highlight humanitarian collapse. Heinz would be in a perfect position to continue and encourage Hollywood in this useful role, and, in turn, becoming a liaison between the worlds of literature, art, movies and other cultural institutions around the world, helping our best exports, spreading good will, and -- all good -- raising funds for the maintenance of the mission. Part Hollywood, part Random House, part music industry, part tv land, part museum mile, part Silicon Valley, part fashion houses, the First Lady must be an exemplar of american cultural influence, and, in the process, the premier fund raiser from those institutions.  Resentment overseas that hinder American companies from gaining access could be charmed open by a talented First Lady, the embodiment of American soft power.

       On The Anxiety of Influence of Coming Afer Bill Clinton and Run Against the House of Saud   Like  Jackie Onassis ,  urlLink Bill Clinton  exerts and anxiety of influence over all future Democratic candidates due to his charismatic 8 years in an ocean of conservative Republican rule during the latter quarter of the 20th Century.   The anxiety of influence that has colored  Al Gore  vanilla, and you -- Senator Kerry -- as  urlLink fodder for the satirists  is heightened by your lack of a definied character.   If you do not define who you are, The President has over $100 million reasons, donated by corporations to paint you in the image of Dukakis, lessons learned from Pappy, George Bush the Elder.   Run against the  urlLink House of Saud ,  urlLink American enemies , and expert procurer of Russian prositutes; run against  urlLink Grover Norquist,  immensely corrupt Republican power broker,  urlLink airlifter of questionable Saudi's  immediately following 9/11; co-opt, co-opt, co-opt ...  And on matters of the military, they are neither Republican or Democrat at heart (although most will say that they are Republican, as military men and women have strong father fixations) but loyal to any President who doesn't diminish their role in world affairs. This amounts, to a degree, to a bribe. Walking the tightrope of keeping up military district appropriations and pay raises and attatching residents to UN peacekeeping ops will be tricky, but with a robust economy and a moderate Republican Secretary General (think george Bush the Elder, as a gift offering to the xenophobic anti-UN right wing) it can be managed.

       On Lies and Manliness   This Presidential election will be all about manliness. The cultural indicators are all abuzz with what it means to be a man and quien es mas macho: upcoming films include extreme renderings of ancient events surrounding the conquests of Alexander and Troy;  commentators and intellectuals wrestle with the idea, from  urlLink George Will  to philosopher  urlLink Harvey Mansfield .  Tina Brown  has spent the past two weeks on  urlLink Topic A  delving -- rather deeply -- into the "daddy party" and the "mommy party," and how our psychological orientation towards our parents influence the party we go in for.  Even  Bill Clinton   urlLink at the Democratic even last week  went on to say of the Republicans and their highly irresponsible deficit spending after the surplus, "They're the 'mature party,' they're the daddy party. They remind me of teenagers that got their inheritance too soon and couldn't wait to blow it."  And, of course, the issue is not masculinity per se, but the mask of masculinity and the fear of terrorism. Even  urlLink Hillary Clinton  coveted a Senate Arms Services seat. This was a key strategic move on the part of Clinton, revealing that she is concerned about the fact that she has no military record in this post 9/11 age, and is, perhaps, hinting at her future national ambitions.   Anti-Bush Democrats, perhaps rightly, were instantly won over to Kerry's -- your -- hypermasculine veteran-issues appeal after  Howard Dean  and  Dick Gephardt  beat each other into oblivion in Iowa. Fortune was on your side, and you supplied the manliness issue,  John Kerry , well played.   The candidate who appears to be the more manly, more credible in defending the country from future terrorist attacks (which is why the  urlLink Clarke-Rice  debate is at center stage) is most likely to win the general election and the most coveted position in the world, Presidency of the World's Last Superpower.  The American image of the masculine has changed. The slim and patrician Uncle Sam is now buff, drives an SUV, has  50 Cent  blaring on the radio; he voted for  Schwarzenegger  over the lamb-like ineffective  Gray Davis  (ineffective is the new evil in Buff Hypermasculine America). September 11, in many ways, transformed us into a warrior culture, and the War on terrorism influences all aspects of our society. Firemen, rather than movie stars or athletes, are considered role models, for instance. Working class soldiers returning for shore leave last Memorial Day weekend were greeted in New York like rock stars by leggy Manolo Blahnik-clad urbane Sex and the City types, looking for love. When was the last time that happened? Who flipped the script?  Award-winning WWII historian  Paul Fussell's  new book; urlLink The Boys Last Crusade  sums up things nicely, saying, "there has been a return, especially in popular culture, to military romanticism, which, if not implying that war is really good for you, does suggest that it contains desirable elements."   But what of Lies?  Men lie about sex all the time ; in fact, to men, lying about sex is not truly a lie, it is a way of life, for further reference see President Clinton. But the debate on lies on the political Left is not about sex, but of higher, more important matters: namely, whether or not  George Bush  lied and if, in  saying so outright and boldly  they can gain votes in the Midwest, the Southwest and the South.  The moderate left does not want to risk being too bold on this issue, while the  urlLink Far Left  and  urlLink Far Right  have no problem is using the incendiary word: "lie."   The Corsair  counsels the Kerry Camp to avoid the use of lie when speaking of the President. It smacks of  looniness , to be frank. The Far Left and the Far Right are polarized against George Bush to such a degree as to be illogical: let them be so. They will never vote for Bush and many will vote for you. Do not turn off centrists by using the overheated rhetoric of the ultra-partisans. Also, for the record,  the Corsair  does not mistake incompetence for conscious lying.   Tim Robbins   urlLink on MSNBC  says of Bush's Vulcans: "I did some research on (The Vulcans in the cabinet: like Defense Secretary  Donald Rumsfeld  and his deputy,  Paul Wolfowitz ) and I found out about some of the philosophy they adhere to a kind of elitist philosophy that there are different truths for different people. The idea of the noble lie; that concept exists in the philosophies of some of these people. So I just started writing these characters and that's kind of where the play started. Then I thought, this is fun to write but there is another story here, and that's the soldiers who are serving the country."  Although Robbin's heart is in the right place (or, rather "left" place, as it were), this is a  dangerously simplistic view  of  urlLink Leo Strauss'  intricate and complicated philosophy of the world. Avoid falling into this trap and allow partisans to make their points -- as surrogates -- without becoming entangled in their faulty logic. Frankly,  The Corsair  believes that  Wolfowitz  himself misreads both  Plato  and  Strauss , but that's another story not for here.

       Exhortation to seize the UN and Save It From Irrelevance (and, thusly, from Itself)   Possible future Secretary Generals of the United Nations: Bush, Carter, Clinton, Ford -- on second thought,  ixnae on the Ford-izzle . Imagine harnessing the seething ambitions of a failed US President and setting them up as the first effective Secretary General, the first cypher of US power on a global scale in concert with the community of nations: Imagine what we could do with the perennial problems of international slavery and piracy on the high seas and international money laundering and terrorism and the Albanian and Russian mobs, the Yakuza, warlords and oceanic pollution.  The United Nations will remain tragically irrelevant until -- Buddha forbid -- a stray asteroid wreaks havoc or, more than likely, a global epidemic in the scale of the Bubonic will force the world out of complacency and into collective action.   If only we had gone the route of the United Nations and used the goodwill of nations surrounding 9/11 to take control of that confused but infinitely useful institution (now, though, evolving into a significant but useless artifact as a result of the teddy bearish and highly irrelevant leadership of  Kofi Annan , now embattled over corruption). It is sadly amusing, with a twinge of red bronze twilight how the Right engages in its favorite sport: Hysterical Criticisms of the UN ("It doesn't work," "tyrannies are on human rights commissions," "following UN mandates puts our sovereignty at risk," "The UN is only after one thang:  One World Government )  Oddly, at the same time, by not participating in the UN and playing well with the other nations on this big blue marble called the planet Earth, we are in caught in a tragic  self fulfilling prophecy:Blame the UN for being ineffective in combating evil on a global scale and withhold dues in punishment and, voila, you get a UN ineffective in combating evil on a global scale,  reductio ad absurdum .   Of course the UN is ineffectual when unlearned hayseed munching rednecks like former Senator Jesse Helms strangled funding and resisted paying UN dues over truly Felliniesque reasoning as "the UN supports abortion in Third World (overpopulated) countries an' ah don' want our dues goin' over ta pay f'r that godlessness."   The Right seems wholly allergic to learning as well as to internationalism or any manner of enlightenment that transcends their own provincial purview of the country music venue. They are, by definition, narrow thinkers (but do not say this out loud, lest you lose the crossover vote). One would think that the threats of SARS and Terrorism and Information Piracy and Piracy on the High Seas (the evil Corsairs who kidnap and kill and rob, at will, since the Babylonians ruled the Near East) would shake them out of their complacency. We are in a global village, whether they like it or not: Welcome to  the Age of Aquarius .   The US pays the overwhelming majority of dues at Turtle Bay, and, through our international lawyers -- great minds -- at Mid Century last, influenced by the calamity of Hitler and Nazism, Fascism and Japanese Imperial expansion, basically WROTE the UN Charter, along with British intellectuals, in High Surrealist Fashion, it was the US and Britain that led the unilateralism and heartbreaking bitchslapping of the UN during what history will almost certainly refer to as the Second Persian Gulf War (2003-2003).   (shakes his head) The US could easily after -- through some guile and subterfuge and goodwill and threats and the strategic withholding of monies temporarily control the UN and reform all manner of areas that are currently, well, how does one say it? Spooky. For example, we could revolutionize the Law of the Seas committee, which my father chaired in 1979. The Law of the Seas Committee and International Law pertaining to the law of the seas, which is, in the most polite manner I can muster -- a basket case.   It is time for the US to engage the UN, to take up our destiny as leader of the world -- through the UN, playing well and cooperating with others. It is high time for International Law to be followed and enforced. It is high time for an international Criminal Court (ahh, Kissinger in ankle chains trying to charm an international tribunal). And it is time for the people of the world to stop clutching at kinship of blood and kinship in religion and realize that the only kinship that will bring harmony into this  pandemonium of international affairs  is a kinship in our shared planetary territory, Our collective real estate, Our Planet Earth.   You, Mr. Kerry, in an act of good will should place a Republican -- preferably  George Bush The Elder  -- in the place of the ineffective Kofi Annan as Secretary General (you will have the votes, Mr. Kerry, especially after this scandal destroys Annan you promise to pay your UN dues and follow international law). Bush Senior was a UN Ambassador, has friends, understands building international coalitions and will soothe the paranoiac xenophobic hillbillies who instinctively fear the UN. You, Mr. Kerry can lead the world to it's next era, an International Law Era, in which the enemy are the persistent plagues of mankind and not provincial detrius.

       Compassionate Capitalism   As  urlLink The National Review reports, Compassionate Conservatism is dead , RIP. That having been said, compassionate capitalists are the new black, and you,  Senator Kerry , would do best to associate with them. Co opt this abndoned piece of policy flotsam from the Republicans.  Lou Dobbs   urlLink nightly and patriotically blasts outsourcing  who abandon America in this stagnant jobs economy.  Warren Buffett  is critical of politics as usual in California,  George Soros  is sour on the Republican fiscal solutions.  urlLink Pete Peterson attacked the current climate .  Paul Krugman  always gets his George Bush on. Why are these men -- all respected capitalists -- veering towards the Democratic Party and why is it incumbent upon you, Senator, bring them under the tent?   One : The association with these respected capitalists, economists and financiers will warm corporate executives towards the Democratic Party and, through that, a new social contract with American workers and the US government, bringing the Democratic party a long way closer to being both the daddy  and  the mommy party, in the long term, strategically.   Two : The thawing relationship with corporate titans will fill Party coffers, which has been on the decline and is much needed against the wealthy Bush political machine.   basta!   tomorrow, back to gossip and snark

       Charlie Murphy's True Hollywood Story   ( ed note :  urlLink Condi Rice Drinking Game Link :)  This week's  urlLink Time Out New York  features an interview with  urlLink The Dave Chappelle Show's  breakout star,  urlLink Charlie Murphy , the younger brother of Eddie " urlLink My Girl Likes to Party All the Time " Murphy.   Here are two interesting excerpts from an interview by  Margeaux Watson :   TONY : Your brother (Eddie Murphy) used to wear some pretty wild leather suits.   CM : So did I! I had the  urlLink Butch Lewis  look -- suit, no shirt, gold chains, hair all greasy. Everything was shiny and oily. I remember one time we was at the premiere of one of my brothers' movies and we thought we was the shit. We had our shades on, sitting down, waiting for the movie to start, and  urlLink Debbie Allen  walked over, bent down and said, 'Y'all some handsome black men, but I really wish y'all would take that shit out of your hair.' We was insulted, like, 'Muthafucka, don't try to rain on my parade! I'm fly!' But she kept it real, man."  and:   TONY : Do you have any True Hollywood Stories that are too raw for Comedy Central?   CM : Of course! But I gotta be careful because I am not a tattletale and I aint tryin' to make no enemies.  Rick James  and  Prince  loved my stories about them. In fact Dave (Chappelle) told me that when he went to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, Prince invited him to his after party at the hotel. They were all in the room laughing, and Prince was telling him how much he loved the sketch, and then he ordered room service and when he got to Dave, he said 'Pancakes, Dave?'"   Tony : Do people constantly come up to you and imitate Dave's portrayal of  Rick James  by screaming 'Charlaaaay Murphaaay?'   CM : Yeah, and that's great for me because it aint like you saying 'Reebok' or 'Nike' when you say 'Charlaay Murphaaay.' You sayin -- my name. I'm being promoted all over America. I couldn't wish for something better than that.   Set TiVo's for stun : ten episodes of  Dave Chappelle   urlLink tonight on Comedy Central . It's Chappelle's night, godammit.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  urlLink Richard Clarke's story optioned by SONY Pictures.  Clarke is the envy of K Street, not only because  Simon and Schuster  bent over backwards to place him on all the Top Drawer programs in town --  Tim Russert ,  60 Minutes  and  Chris Matthews ; but now he has that which many secretly covet:  Hollywood fame . Most have to settle with some adricultural subcommittee chair, secretly wishing that they could have all the glamour as well as the power and lobbyist kickbacks. Aint life a bitch.   "Clarke was repped by ICM in the deal," wrote  Gregg Kilday  of the  urlLink Hollywood Reporter . How many times on K Street is someone repped by ICM?    Out :  Cofer Black  was "reassigned" at the last moment yesterday.  What a coincidence  that Saturday is the slowest news day, no?  We would not entertain  the possibility that the White House wanted the least possible coverage of that bit of news.  Bob Woodward  and  Dan Eggen  write in the  urlLink Washington Post , "In other developments yesterday, CIA officials said  Cofer Black , head of the agency's Counterterrorism Center for the past three years, has been assigned to another position. They described the move as part of normal turnover at the agency."    In :  urlLink Doonesbury .  Gary Trudeau's  daily syndicated strip has got it's groove back. After Iraq, Trudeau protrayed the President as a floating Imperial Roman helmet, as opposed to a floating cowboy hat, as he had during the campaign. Either way, an administration deaf to nuance is shown in all it's imperial Daddy-issues swagger.   Out :  urlLink The Swan .  urlLink Natalie Chicha  is brilliant today, a swan in her own right, in passionately denouncing this reality trash:  "We love to hate reality TV, and reality TV knows that. It cues our hate to keep us watching, like a bullfighter taunting a bull: waving red to draw our attention and anger. Usually, the red flag — the brandished target for our hate — is a loathsome character, the best example from this season being The Apprentice’s Omarosa. And, for the joy of the game, we pretend that the flag is live prey, rather than a manipulation introduced and controlled by the bullfighter.   "But The Swan, which ran an encore debut last night, drapes the red around the bullfighter and knots it like a cape. Other shows have had equally shallow and enraging premises —remember Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire? But the premise always drew equally shallow and enraging contestants, while the contestants on The Swan don’t seem shallow so much as insecure and clueless. The show itself is the villain, the only target for our hatred. But the question is,  urlLink is The Swan purposefully loathsome, or just deeply hypocritical ?"

       After the Condi Rice Drinking Game   Okay: In retrospect, it probably wasn't the most "enlightened idea" in a bad economy to brag on my blog about taking a "sick day" (gives an unconvincing wheeze)  to play  urlLink The Condi Rice drinking games link , (nervous laughter) unless your boss is really,  really  really forgiving.  We are very very hung over (We took a wicked swig each and every time  urlLink former Sen. Kerry  called Condi, " urlLink Dr.Clarke "), so forgive us for the lack of posts today.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In : Who squealed on Ambassador  Joe Wilson's  wife, ex-CIA operative  Valerie Plame ?  urlLink The Washingtonian's Buzz columnist Harry Jaffe writes :  "Galleys of former ambassador Joe Wilson’s book,  urlLink The Politics of Truth , have begun to circulate in Washington, but word about which Bush official might have outed Wilson’s wife as a CIA agent have not leaked— yet ." (italics mine)   Out : Hollywood has not been kind to  David Duchovny ; he that was once hot, now  decidedly  is not.  urlLink The AP  reports, " David Duchovny  expects that  Mulder  and  Scully  will ride again one day. Duchovny said a second big-screen installment of 'The X-Files' remains in the works. It should only be slightly more exciting than watching plants absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Gag it with a fork, Duchovny,  it's done . Even the hard core geeks have moved on, David. Post your comments to this inspired idea on VH1's Best Week Ever blog  urlLink here , where  The Corsair  has been known to write, on occasion.   In : urlLink  The Apprentice . Let's face it,  Donald Trump  is riding the crest of the reality show zeigeist. In slippers, balancing a teacup. Not since  P Diddy  hijacked the New York City Marathon to a pr stunt has anyone already rich and famous morphed themselves more rich and more famous (mo money, mo money)  and a tv star to boot . Fuck. That's just what that short fingered barbarian did.  urlLink TheDrudgereport's  filched  urlLink Nielsen numbers  show that  urlLink The Donald's Apprentice  overnight got a 15.6 rating, or, 23 share for NBC. We're not even going to lie as if we know what those numbers mean, only thatv they are good.  Very good . Aren't you curious as to how The Donald will fuck this up? I can't see him and NBC on friendly terms after ratings drop, as they always do in network tv. Remember So You Wanna Be A Millionaire? Regis' shtick was the line "Is That Your Final Answer," just as Donald's is (waves hand in a funny manner) "You're Fired." "And this too," said Lincoln, quoting the wise Chinese Emperor,"will pass away."   Out : urlLink  The Trumper . Courtesy of  urlLink OldHag , "My problem is verisimilitude.   "How am I supposed to buy this premise when dude is $1.8 billion in the hole? Pretty soon he's not even gonna be CEO of his own company. This cannot inspire confidence. Even his supporters concede that his casino business is getting killed by the new kids. (No surprise, really, when you look at the talent the competition is bringing in).  "Eight years running a publicly traded company and you've never posted a profit. Assets are falling, liabilities are growing. Last night you told your inner circle, "We're having a good year." WTF? Dude, you've failed at every task! Don't make me say it."  I think you just did. Read more  urlLink here .   In : My old college buddy  Shaw Isaacson's   urlLink American Feed .    Out :  urlLink Bend it like Bekham , who is accused of making the beast with two backs with one  urlLink Rebecca Loos  (what a meaningful name; note: link not safe for workplace, Rebecca's boob gets "Loos"). His little affair hasn't really got much press in the US, but it is big in the UK. Very big.  urlLink Ananova reports :  " David  and  urlLink Victoria Beckham  are planning another public show of unity as they brace themselves for  urlLink more allegations  about their private life.  "Becks is expected to put the claims behind him and play for Real Madrid on Sunday - and Posh is expected to fly to Spain to watch the game.  "However, the pair are preparing for more newspaper revelations.  urlLink Rebecca Loos  has reportedly signed a  £300,000  deal to tell all about the affair allegations which Becks last week dismissed as 'ludicrous.'  "According to  The Daily Mirror , Beckham returned to training yesterday to be confronted by jibes from his teammates.  "A source told the paper the England captain lost his rag in the dressing room and tore down a joke poster poking fun at his troubles."  Damn, that's cold. Omerosa cold.   In :  urlLink Demi  and Ashton to get married in June? So says that significant cultural artifact  urlLink The Star :  "In the very early morning hours of Monday, April 5,  Demi Moore  and  Ashton Kutcher  arrived at Miami's Raleigh hotel laden with bags and looking jet lagged like a normal couple. But later that day, the attached-at- the-hip pair -- he in a white hat and she in a headscarf -- headed to the Westin Diplomat hotel in Hollywood, Fla., for a Passover Kabbalah retreat. The couple have become devotees of the mystical sect of Judaism -- Kabbalah. Now Star has learned that the couple is planning to celebrate their own Kabbalah wedding in June."   Kabbalah wedding?    Out :  urlLink Glamourmagazine.com  reports that  Paris Hilton  is out some money. "Paris Hilton has been forced to pay up after losing a diamond bracelet loaned to her for last year's Oscars. The Simple Life star borrowed gems worth more than  £87,000  for the ceremony but claims they were stolen during the evening, and has been locked in a legal battle with New York jewellers  Kwiat  ever since. Paris has always maintained that the bracelet was faulty and kept falling off her wrist, so she put it in the glovebox of a friend's car, which was later broken into. It is thought she paid  £54,000  to Kwait in an out-of-court settlement."   In :  urlLink Engadget . The techie-oriented site comes away today with what might be an incredible  urlLink scoop on gadgetry . The story begins, "Could Microsoft be preparing to drop a potential bombshell with the Xbox 2?" Then winds into a gossipy response, which may or may not be true (April Fools has passed) from one of their readers about the  X Box  and  iPod :  "Regarding the Xbox 2 hard drive, I was snowboarding in Whistler, B.C. from February 19 - 26, 2004.  We were in a bar called the Amsterdam Cafe in the village one night and  urlLink J. Allard , the head of Microsoft’s Xbox division was in the bar with some friends. I recognized him from a recent Business 2.0 article and we started talking. (He bought my friends and I a round of drinks he called 'Hey Zeuses' - they were  urlLink Red Bull and tequila  and they were nasty.) Anyway, we were talking about the Xbox 2 and he said their current plan was not to include a hard drive in the Xbox 2 itself, but to offer a portable hard drive as an accessory you could buy separately. Here’s the kicker: He said what they were trying to do was to incorporate MP3 (and WMA, obviously) functionality into the portable hard drive and turn the thing into an iPod killer.  Basically, the idea was to come up with an MP3 player that was as good or better than the iPod that would also serve as the hard drive for the Xbox 2. And he said they planned to sell them as a loss leader at $100 each."   Fuck .  Bill Gates  is an evil genius. Continue reading the story  urlLink here .

       The Condi Rice 9/11 Testimony Drinking Game (Thanks, Wonkette)    National Security Advisor  Condi Rice's  testimony will probably have as much gravity as  urlLink Watergate , as well it should. The 9/11 Commission is trying to find out what went wrong, how did the worst terrorist attack in our history catch us off guard? Finding those answers is the job of the Commission.   And what of us? What of we policy geeks who called in sick to our jobs (*cough, cough*) so that we could watch (family emergency) this historic moment (stomach virus) uninterrupted by  work ?   Drink , my sweet readers; let the  urlLink Cutty Sark  cut the gravity.  urlLink Wonkette had the idea , but because the day got away from her, I felt I should give it a shot. I give to you, dear reader, with special mention to Wonkette for the idea,  The Condi Rice 9/11 Commission Drinking Game :   Take one drink if:    ... Condi refers to White House documentation: memos, e-mails or agenda items  ... Condi says she wants to "work with the Commission" (every time she does)    Take two drinks if:    ... Condi's opening statement goes beyond 20 minutes  ... Condi puts down  Richard Clarke    Pound it if:    ... Former Senator  urlLink Bob Kerry  makes an outrageous statement  ... A Republican on the panel tells Bob Kerry that he is being partisan  ... Condi puts down the Clinton Administration  ... The Commission breaks into verbal jousting among themselves

       Before the Storm: The Media Class Waits for Bob Woodward   Everyone is waiting for  urlLink Bob Woodward's nuclear bomb  of a next book to detonate on  urlLink 60 Minutes  the Sunday after next. Everyone.  urlLink The right is digging fallout shelters  in anticipation of a nuclear winter.  urlLink Tina Brown captures the anticipatory mood  marvelously:  "In this atmosphere of anticipation followed by revelation, the media classes are salivating at the prospect of investigative journalist Bob Woodward's latest tome,  urlLink 'Plan of Attack .' Talk show producers I speak to are on steroids waiting for Woodward. They have always just heard from a D.C. insider who had lunch last week with a friend who ran into Woodward at the pharmacy/ grocery store/Blockbuster and reported breathlessly that 'he didn't want to say anything but I hear it's going to blow the lid off all the stuff about why we really went into Iraq/who's really making the decisions/what Powell really believes/what the real hold is that Cheney has over Bush/what Condi will never say to the 9/11 commission.'"   Salivating doesn't even begin to express it.  We can't wait.

       Gawker Stalkers   The gawker stalker reports are some of the funniest (and potentially "actionable") parts of the whole  gawker mystique . I love them.  urlLink Heres one of the funniest  gawker stalker reports I have read (today):  "I saw  Julianne Moore  Saturday, April 3rd, at  urlLink Citarella , on 6th avenue and 9th street. She was shopping with an old assistant/older relative type. She was very friendly to the cashiers—I guess she shops there often. Was very petite but otherwise just like in the movies: red hair, barely any makeup, and a long green coat that went well with her hair. Naturally, I stalked her for a couple of blocks, but she knew she was being followed and thus started walking around in circle, giving me dirty looks. It worked—she scared me off."  Can you imagine this scene playing out on the mean streets of New York? The tip off of this "character" is that they notice Moore's hair and makeup and how the coat goes well with the hair.  Too much information . (*uncontrollably shudders*) I couldn't tell you what color socks I have on today, and bigman here is all  in Moore's grill   remembrancing of wardrobe's past.   And, naturally he followed her for a couple of blocks.  Naturally . This is not New York behavior, cornbread, this is the musky sort of fun of the tweaker high on meth. Poor petite  urlLink Julianne Moore : not only has Oscar been unkind to her, she has this freak causing her to walk in circles. Can someone get Homeland Secutrity on this clearly deranged man's ass?  urlLink Choire , my friend in the blog, you need to send his email to the proper authorities.

Along with the fact that the  New York Times  restaurant critic (temporary but still) was eating fast food, she was also reading  USA Today . Maybe all the fat has gone to her brain and she's taken leave of her senses."   Hey :  All she wanted was Chicken McNuggets !  And what was  Our Miu  doing at McDonalds? "It may be a shock to all of you that Miu eats McDonald's, but I was craving those fries. And no, I haven't been knocked up."  We still kiss your fry-greasy, elegant, thin socialitey fingertips, darling  Miu .   In : 'Diamond Dermabrasion' face lifts. According to that significant cultural artifact  urlLink The National Enquirer :  "'Courtney (Love) had a 'Diamond Dermabrasion' face-lift to try to get rid of sun damage as well as drug and alcohol damage to her skin,' an insider told The ENQUIRER.   "'Diamond Dermabrasion' is an ingenious treatment using diamond-shaped crystals. It's a combination of scraping and suction that Courtney's beauty therapist, Regina Knobel, described as  sandblasting the skin .   "'Courtney said she loved the way she looked afterward but blew off paying Knobel her fees.   "'Knobel's office tried repeatedly to collect $3,304 from Courtney but she ignored the statements as well as the calls from the collection agency.   "'So as a final resort, Knobel decided to file a lawsuit in small claims court and won fees plus court costs.'"    Scraping and suction ?  Blew off ? Yup. Sounds like some  Courtney Love  going on.   Out : urlLink  TheSmokinggun  reports that former Murphy Brown star  urlLink Robert Pastorelli  (he played the philosophical housepainter Elvin) died of a heroin overdose:  "An autopsy has confirmed that actor  urlLink Robert Pastorelli , who starred opposite  Candice Bergen  in 'Murphy Brown,' died last month of an accidental heroin overdose. On March 8, Pastorelli's assistant found the 49-year-old performer slumped over on the toilet of his Hollywood home, a syringe sticking from his right arm. According to a coroner's report released yesterday. Pastorelli died from a 'fatal blood concentration of morphine.' According to sources quoted in the report, Pastorelli previously battled heroin addiction and had been depressed since his girlfriend's 1999 suicide."  May he rest in peace.    In :  urlLink LA Fashion Week may be over , but  urlLink Russian Fashion Week  has just begun, writes  Godfrey Deeny , "In just three years, Russian fashion Tsar  Alexander Shumsky  has turned Moscow mode from a tiny collection of small shows to a ten-day estravaganza of 55 shows and a score of parties. "  What's in? Bike gangs and Haute Couture, according to  urlLink Godfrey Deeny of Fashion Wire Daily , who begins:   "The daddy was known as the Kremlin couturier. The son is a fully paid up member of Moscow’s meanest motor cycle gang.   "The Night Wolves, the gang with whom he rumbles, showed for the runway show of  urlLink Egor Zaitsev , son of  Slava Zaitsev , the genial designer who used to dress Politburo wives back in the old days.   "A half dozen Wolves even tossed Egor into the air sveral times after his show in  T Modul,  a city-center shopping and convention center where most of the shows are staged."  Russian models mixing with biker gangs, sounds  very very best .   Out : Condi's testimony. My old boss  urlLink Jason Calacanis  from  urlLink Silicon Alley Reporter  days strikes the right tone:  "After today’s insulting testimony from Condi Rice (uhhh… isn’t an apology in order here?) I think we all know why the Bush team didn’t want to give the Presidential Daily Briefing to the 9/11 commission: the title (or a subject heading, it is not clear) seems to be “bin Laden determined to attack the United States.”  "Imagine that… one month and five days before September 11th the President is told bin Laden DETERMINED TO ATTACK THE UNITED STATES in the most important daily report given to the president—WHILE HE IS ON A MONTH LONG VACATION!  "Read the  urlLink transcript  and cry for democracy—where is the accountability?!  "Mr. President  declassify  that document!"  We couldn't have said it better, Jason.   In : Oral sex during The Passion of The Christ.  urlLink Lindsayism chimes in :  "Weird News I'd Love To See:  " Associated Press : A couple was arrested last night for allegedly engaging in oral sex in a theater while  Mel Gibson's  film 'The Passion of the Christ' was screening."   How cool would that be ? All over the country, bondage fetishists go to matinee screenings of the Passion to get their freaky "o"-on. The lights go out, Jesus takes his licks on screen. Agony on film, exstasy in the seats. Can't you see Mel raging on the talk show circuit. Preachers villifying from the pulpit. And what about the ushers with their flashlights patrolling the aisles. Oh,  Lindsay , you are a freak after my own kinky heart.  Do you want to see  urlLink Kill Bill Volume 2  with me?

This might be the only award winning writer and guest of  David Letterman  who has done "skin flics." Ames sent out a mass email a few minutes ago saying, in part:  "A few years ago, I spent three days on a porn set to write  urlLink an article for NY Press , and which I reprinted in my book My Less Than Secret Life.  On my last day,  urlLink they included me in the movie , which is called 'C-Men.'  In the movie, I'm talking to a porn starlet in a bar, attempting to pick her up, and then this male porn star, named Dale DeBone, dressed in a super-hero outfit, comes over and tells me to get lost and I slink away.  I later saw Dale DeBone in a reality TV show where he dated a woman and was listed as an 'actor'.  here is a link to buy this video, if you go in for that.  Personally, I don't like porn."   O-kay  .... (whistles nervously then runs like the wind)     Out : Stern is out of Six stations.  urlLink The folks at TheSmokinggun  have the transcripts of the show that started the scandal:  "In another broadside at Howard Stern, the Federal Communications Commission today fined Clear Channel Communications a whopping $495,000 for last year's broadcast of an allegedly indecent bit on the King of All Media's popular radio program. Acting on a listener complaint, the FCC hammered Clear Channel over an April 2003 broadcast during which Stern and his cohorts discussed their sexual practices and the use of a personal hygiene product called 'Sphincterine.' Included in the commission's notice of liability--which cites 18 alleged indecency violations--was a transcript of the offending broadcast,  urlLink a copy of which you'll find below . Until late-February, Clear Channel aired the shock jock's show on six of its stations. But the radio star was abruptly dumped after Clear Channel concluded that Stern's February 24 broadcast violated the media giant's new zero-tolerance decency standards. Last month, Infinity Broadcasting (which employs Stern and airs his show nationwide) was fined $27,500 for a "graphic and explicit" July 2001 Stern show."

       The Passion of the Condi     A Harlot Washes Condi's Feet    urlLink Dennis Miller  recognized Condi as the embodiment of neoconservative  urlLink virtu , and with tears equal to his past deeds, he besaught Condi with weeping. Spraying hot tears, the comedian mingled petrol with his moist weeping on her most pure feet and wiped it away with his salt and pepper speckled beard.  "Do not despise my tears. Do not reject me as a liberal."   The Last Supper   On the night before she was betrayed, Condi took  urlLink The Yellow Cake , gave thanks and praise, gave it to the neoconservatives and said, "Take this Yellow Cake and eat of it, receive the Yellow Cake with pure souls."  And when the supper was over, she took a cup filled with petrol, gave it to the neoconservatives and said, " urlLink Drink this petrol  and be confirmed in our right wing faith."  Afterwards she took her two closest neoconservative disciples  Richard Perle  and  urlLink Paul Wolfowitz  with her to the Washington Monument.    The Trial   Condi, according to custom, passed through DC, the capitol of the Imperium; accompanied by her neoconservative disciples, went to the  urlLink Washington Monument , and sat down on the ground. The neoconservatives were sleeping near her, when all at once an armed troop appeared bearing  urlLink ACLU membership cards  appeared. They were supported by a detatchment of  urlLink UN Peacekeepers .  urlLink Richard Clarke , knowing the habits of Condi, had indicated this place as one where she might be most easily surprised; earlier he had dipped his hands with her into a dish of petrol. And, also according to custom, he betrayed her with a kiss for pieces of silver provided for by  urlLink Simon and Schuster .   The plan of the liberals was to trap Condi, by the testimony of witnesses and by her own words. It was before the powerful personage of  urlLink Pontius Keane  that Condi was braught.  Condi's neoconservative disciples  Perle  and  Wolfowitz  followed their Mistress to the dwelling of the  urlLink 911 Commission . Perle stopped in the antichamberand was soon recognized by Senate paiges as a disciple of Condi, the accused. Perle denied thrice that he had ever the least connection with Condi. But his better nature soon revealed to him the fault he had committed. Touched to the bottom of his black heart,  urlLink Richard Perle  wept bitterly.  On the reading of the incriminating charge, Condi remained silent for she had resolved to endure all things so that she may save American petrol interests: Condi Rice:  urlLink Lover of Oil    Politically Left For Dead   O Lamb of the Right, political death is blind to your splendor, Condi.    The Resurrection   After being pilloried by the media in Friday's papers, Condi will rise again on the third day in glory  urlLink succeding Jack Valenti as President of the MPAA . She who suffered for American petrol interests has risen, in glory, to Hollywood, to judge the G, PG, PG-13 or R, depending upon their merits and their good works. And her kingdom will have no end, until, of course, she decides to retire (Valenti held his post, like an African dictator, for 38 years)   Beyond Politics   "So then Condi Rice, after she had spoken to the neoconservatives, was taken up into Hollywood, and sat down at the right hand of Tom Cruise. Condi's body was glorified at the moment of her Resurrection, as proved by the new and supernatural properties it subsequently and permanently enjoys. But during the forty days when she eats yellow cake and drinks petrol, familiarly with herisciples and teaches them about Hollywood, mystery remains veiled under the appearance of ordinary humanity. Condy's final apparition ends with the irreversible entry of his humanity into divine glory, symbolized by the cloud and by heaven, where she is seated from that time forward at Tom Cruise's right hand.  Only in a wholly exceptional and unique way would Condi show herself to Dennis Miller "as to one untimely born", in a last apparition that established him as a neoconservative.

       Keisha Kight Pulliam, AKA Rudy, All Grown Up   I don't know why I am so evil today. Maybe I had evil in my porrige? I am going to get 100 angry emails for desecrating the story of the Passion and Condi Rice, and now I am doing this gratutitous piece on lil'  urlLink Rudy from the Cosby Show .  To be frank, I cannot think of  urlLink Keisha Knight Pulliam  as sexy. I simply cannot . Intellectually I can grasp the idea, but I saw her as a cute baby,  urlLink so I just can't .   Anyhoo :  Keisha Knight Pulliam  in  urlLink XXL :   XXL : And in 'One Call Away' you're up there in a cute little bra ...   Keisha : They knew that I wasn't going to do anything that wasn't tasteful.  urlLink The video  is not demeaning, or I wouldn't have done it. Yes, you do see me in a bra and people are very shocked by that because they're remembering me as a 10 year old girl. What's appropriate for  urlLink someone who is 25 is not apppropriate for someone who is 10. This isn't Rudy in a bra. It's Keisha Knight-Pulliam ,  the actress .  I still feel guilty. Here's  urlLink the basseyworld blog  to sum up my feelings:  "Rudy Huxtable grew into a beautiful woman. I was worried there during the end of the Cosby Show. But since I went through awkward middle years myself, I knew she’d grow out of it.  "What? I did too grow out of it!   "I have to say, I don’t enjoy seeing  Rudy Huxtable  in a bra and panties. It’s just not right."   I'll cosign on that.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  urlLink Diana Ross won't have to serve  more time in the slammer.  urlLink The AP writes , "On Monday, a city judge rescinded his order calling for the 60-year-old singer to return to Tucson to serve 48 consecutive hours in the Pima County Jail.   "Ross, who pleaded no contest in February to a drunken-driving charge, arranged to serve her jail sentence in Greenwich, where she lives.   "But based on an account from Greenwich police, Tucson City Court Magistrate  T. Jay Cranshaw  found that she failed to serve 24 consecutive hours as required by Arizona law."  "Ross spent 22 1/2 hours at the Greenwich jail between Feb. 9 and Feb. 10 before being released because there was no female guard on duty for the remaining 1 1/2 hours."  Altogether, Ms. Ross spent 44 hours in jail over a three day stretch.  Harrowing . Mahogany got to meet her public  up close and live . At some point during the stint, the song " urlLink I Want Muscles ," must have gone through her wonderfully processed head.  Personally I prefer to think of her in the proto 70s freedom kaleidescope  urlLink Mahogany . I ask you, Diana:  "Do you know where you’re going to?  Do you like the things that life is showing you Where are you going to?  Do you know...?"   Out :  Oprah versus Howard . This is a war Howard Stern is going to lose, and lose badly. I don't quite know why he is being such a pussy in taking on the government. Maybe it is his ABC gig that he's worried about. He should be holding rallies at the White House, for God sakes, instead,  urlLink he is taking on Oprah .  That  urlLink significant cultural artifact Star Magazine  writes:  "Author  Larry Sloman , who collaborated with Stern on his book  Private Parts , tells Star: 'Howard's show is tame compared to some of the graphic discussions on Oprah. But the FCC doesn't have the guts to take on a black woman who has single-mindedly willed herself an all-American icon.' His frustration with the FCC at an all-time high, Stern has threatened to quit radio all-together, or move to satellite radio, which the FCC doesn't regulate.  "But Oprah's racy segments haven't gone altogether unnoticed. An FCC official, who asked to remain anonymous, tells Star that the government agency has received "a number of complaints" about Oprah's show in recent weeks.  " ... One of Oprah's former colleagues adds, 'When was the last time Howard did anything good for anybody? Oprah is always doing good things for people.'"  I guess breast implants and sex with whores for losers doesn't count as good things?   In :  urlLink Guadeloupe Lopez hits the jackpot . As if she needed the infusion of cheddar, JLo's mom, Guadeloupe,  urlLink hit a $2.4 million payout . Guadeloupe is the mom of multimillionaire diva  JLo  and successful entertainment correspondent  Linda Lopez :  "'It was divine intervention,'  Guadalupe Lopez  declared after her $3 investment generated a more than 800,000-fold dividend.  "'I have a great devotion to Our Lady of Guadalupe ... and had just looked up at the $2 million and said a little prayer to her when I hit the jackpot. Our Lady really looks out for me,' she told the slot machine owners, who issued a press release touting the 'anonymous' winner.  "Borgata sources and J.Lo's camp confirmed the winner was Jenny From the Block's mom."  I'll bet this blog that she is a Sagittarius. I've been aound the block a bit, and nothing fails to amaze me that Sagittarian luck hitting. It's  uncanny .  Apparently, Guadeloupe had only been playing for about 10 minutes when the three 'Wheel of Fortune' symbols popped up. The Lopez family is definitely the friend of the wheel of fortune.  But, wait a second ... didn't  urlLink People Magazine  report that she broke off her engagement to Affleck because she didn't care for his partying and  gambling ?   Out :  urlLink Iris Palmer, the eccentric british model  and trapeeze artist is out of the fashion biz. As the  urlLink British Vogue  (via the Sunday Telegraph) writes:  " IRIS PALMER  may have given up her dreams of becoming a trapeze artist to re-enter the modelling world, but it appears she's already regretting the decision. Iris, daughter of  Sir Mark Palmer , claims she is already bored and now plans to turn her hand to painting. 'I hate this industry, I really do,' the eccentric English beauty told  The Sunday Telegraph . 'I'm not interested in clothes and the people are all so boring. At the moment I'm only modelling to make money on the side. I hope I won't be doing it for much longer.' Her distaste for the fashion industry was openly on display at the launch of the  urlLink Vivienne Westwood retrospective  at the  V&A  last week, where she couldn't wait to leave. 'It is simply too full of pretentious people being pretentious to each other," she told reporters as she beat a hasty exit. "It's really not my kind of thing at all.'"   In : Kathleen Turner. Who knew?  urlLink Michael Musto gives us the dish ,"BILL MURRAY ... stepping up to the podium to crack that he was thrilled to be part of 'the  Sofia Coppola  lifetime achievement award.' Pointing out  KATHLEEN TURNER  in the crowd, he then interjected,  'Now she plays homely wenches, but she's obviously an incredibly hot fuck. She must be, right?'" I always agree with Bill.   Out :  Ed Burns .  urlLink Variety reports (subscription required):  "The Tribeca Film Festival has announced a lineup of 65 features for its Spotlight, Showcase, Restored & Rediscovered and Midnight sections, with premieres including  Ed Burns'  latest, 'Looking for Kitty';  David Duchovny's  directing debut, 'House of D'; and  John Walter's  humorous docu-tribute 'In Search of Ted Demme.'"  Okay: question:  has Ed Burns ever had a hit film ? Why does he get to marry  Chrystie Turlington  (shakes his fist at computer screen jealously) and make movies!  Why!    In :  urlLink Frank DiGiacomo is leaving the Observer for Vanity Fair . Our  urlLink Lizzie Spiers , that dark haired hottie, says, "Alternate headline: "Observer Staffers Dissatisfied: Little Gold Foil Stars No Longer Considered Adequate Compensation Package."

       Billy Bob Left Angelina Because He Was Scared    urlLink Manorexic Billy Bob Thornton  left  Angelina Jolie  because she scared him, according to  urlLink Ananova , via NBC's Dateline:  "In a frank interview with  urlLink NBC's Dateline show , he admitted she was "too beautiful and too smart" for him  "However he claims they are now friends and that he's been spending time with her adopted Cambodian son  Maddox .  "Angelina was Billy Bob's fifth wife. They bragged about their sex lives in interviews and, at one time, wore vials of each other's blood around their necks."  Thornton also gets sassy with interviewer  urlLink Ann Curry . Here's some of the backtalk:   Curry in a Hurry : How do you respond to the industry buzz that  urlLink The Alamo  is in trouble?"   Manorexia Nervosa : The people who start that crap are the people that I fight with every day. Name one movie where the filmmaker was not asked to cut it. And I'll kiss your butt.

       Topic A: Ron Galotti in Vermont   Last night former  Vogue  publisher  urlLink Ron Galotti  (no relation) made a visit to our favorite media tv show (alright,  urlLink Howie , our  second  favorite) to tell us about "dropping out" of the competetive New York city magazine game.  Apparently "Mr. Big" will be  raising chickens  (I'm not kidding) and hanging out on 100 acres in the  urlLink Green Mountain State .   "I lived for 35 years in a pressure cooker," Ron told Tina. So, I guess Ron can understand the vagaries of the politics of poultry; the restraints of rotisserie. "I left my house at 7 am," lamented the  urlLink former publisher of Country Living , "and I didn't get back until 11 pm."  " urlLink Ron ," said Tina, with all the sincerity of a talk show host wanting to move on to the next segment, "we're going to check in with you ... because I really want to know blow-by-blow how life is going for you on the farm." Hugs and kisses ended the segment.  Hmmm.  The Corsair's  devilish mind wonders how that will end up:  slow fade   urlLink cock crows , Morning Summer 2004:   Tina Brown : Hello folks, and live on satellite, we are checking in on former publisher of Conde Nast Traveler Ron Galotti for the blow by blow on his 100 acre Vermont farm. How's it going, Ron.   Ron Galotti : Last night I saw stars, Tina.   Tina : (excitedly) stars? Who, Ron, give us the dish.   Ron : No Tina, not who. You gotta think of the big picture here. Like, you got  urlLink Cameron Diaz ? We've got the  urlLink Aurora Borealis . It shines brighter, Tina, last night was the  urlLink harvest moon  ...    Tina : (dejectedly) That sounds positively bucolic. -- Okay, Ron, gotta run to the next segment.   fade in.   urlLink cock crows  Fall 2004   Tina : And live on remote, we have  Ron Galotti , former publishing director at  Esquire .  Tell us what's new, Ron?   Ron : That's  Selectman  Galotti, Tina.   Tina : Excuse me?   Ron : I was elected by my town to the  urlLink board of selectmen . Real direct democracy, Tina. Better than making a cool million a year as publisher at  Vanity Fair.    Tina : (unenthusiastically) ... and just what exactly does that entail, Ron?   Ron : (zestily) Oh, we oversees roads -- including the laying out, discontinuing and reclassifying of roads. We board sit as local board of health, liquor control commission and  I'm on the sewer commission  ...    Tina :  Where  has the time flown? We have to move onto the next segment.  fade in   urlLink cock crows . Winter 2004   Tina : (positively unexcited) And live via satellite, we have Selectman Galotti. Quickly give us your hot picks.   Ron : Funny you should say  picked , Tina, cause I "picked" these myself.  urlLink Pressed Cider , Tina; they can't get enough of it here.

       Lloyd Grove on Reliable Sources   Alt urlLink hough The Daily News'   Lloyd Grove  had a rocky start in New York,  urlLink and I said so , he's improved vastly.   So, imagine my surprise when Grove was a guest on  urlLink Howie Kurtz's Reliable Sources  talking on the  urlLink JFK, Jr  affair fiasco.   Never before have two such high profile media personalities spoken in such frank terms -- and on national television, no less -- about ...  showering.    Howie  asked  Grove  whether or not he would be uncomfortable writing on the  JFK, Jr.  story and if, afterwards, would he feel the need to take a quick one.  "It doesn't make me uncomfortable," said Grove, "and I would take a shower."  An honest answer from someone in the gossip business.  Later on, Howie hopped in:  "We'll have to see (about the  JFK, Jr . spade of books). I think I may feel like taking a shower afterwards."    Thanks for sharing!

       Dylan in Victoria's Secret Commercial: Sell Out?   Some say Dylan  urlLink sold his soul  to Lucifer  urlLink when he went electric . His dye hard fans held on; Dylan is a genius, they said, there is method to his madness. The debate is flaring up once again as a result of  urlLink Dylan's Victoria's Secret commercial .  urlLink Ananova writes :  " Bob Dylan  is appearing in a TV advert for sexy underwear and will release a CD of his songs exclusively through the designer's stores.  "The ad, for  urlLink Victoria's Secret , shows the 63-year-old legend at the  Palazzo  in Venice leering at a scantily dressed model wearing angels' wings as a remix of his 1997 song  Love Sick  is played.  "Dylan is dressed in black sporting a pencil moustache, goatee beard and eyeliner in the commercial."   Eyeliner ? I can already imagine  urlLink patchouli-scented  fists smashing their sitars in disgust. Hey,  the man is a rock star , an eternal adolescent; he has a lot of ex-wives and "love children" to support, cut the man a break. Haven't we all sold out? Didn't we all have IPO shares in our portfolio when we were defending Clinton's blowjob back in the 90s, when the economy was cool? God, I wish we'd all stop playing holier than thou on a man's right to make some money in this economy: by the way, peeps, rock is not art,  urlLink Monteverdi  is art.  When  Claudio Monteverdi  comes out and does a  Taco Bell  commercial, then you will hear me blog like a motherfucker, until then, I hope these guys pop a lude and  cope .    Anyhoo :  Ananova  continues,  "It is the first time Dylan has appeared in a commercial in his 40-year career although in the past he has lent his music to be used in ads.  "Victoria's Secret creative director  Ed Razek  told  urlLink the San Francisco Chronicle : 'We had done some spots last year with Dylan's music, and they got a great response.  "'I can't speak for his motivation, but it certainly wouldn't be commercial.'  "A spokesperson for Dylan's record label,  urlLink Columbia Records , said: 'We think this is a great way to reach people with Bob's music. We're thrilled that he said  yes  when we asked him to be in the commercial.'"  Wait a second? There is such a thing as a  Creative Director  at Victoria's Secret?  What the fuck ?! I've got some very creative and, well,  athletic  ideas for those girls.  I'll sell out this blog in a heartbeat for that job (sorry, dear readers):  Ed Razek  (makes hand signal) ...  call me ?  Other Dylan song sell outs:   urlLink The Times They Are a Changin'  to  urlLink sell Jayson Blair's Burning Down My Masters' House: My Life at the New York Times    urlLink All Along the Watchtower  to sell  urlLink Jehovah's Witness publications .   urlLink Get Your rocks off  to the  urlLink Carmen Electra's Absolute Strip Tease  "excecise" (wink, wink) video.   urlLink Joey  will be the theme song for the  urlLink Friends Spin Off .    urlLink Masters of War  will be  Condi Rice's  theme song before her  urlLink 9/11 Commission testimony .

       60 Minutes: Bob Woodward    The leaks over this appearance are mighty. The  urlLink fucking Tehran Times  is reporting on this book already, spinning it's own nasty tyrannical spin on it! On the  urlLink CBS web site , some funamental questions are asked, but the leaks have all but answered them, making  60 Minutes , a little less than must-see television. Still,  urlLink Woodward , who once dated  urlLink Leslie Stahl  will be interesting. Wallace will do the interview, saving Stahl from  urlLink a major conflict of interest .  Here's what CBS says on their  urlLink 60 Minutes Page :  "(Bob) Woodward will answer the following questions, among others, in the interview with Wallace Sunday night:   "-How early did President Bush begin planning the war on Iraq?  -In the war?s wake, which top administration officials now barely speak to each other?  -What did the CIA say to President Bush to convince him that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction?  -Which foreign dignitary was told of the plans to attack Iraq days before even key cabinet members were briefed?  -Which key advisers did President Bush ask ? and not ask ? about whether he should go to war with Iraq?  -Why did the CIA think Saddam had been killed before the ground war even began?"  And here are some answers, via leaks:    How early did President Bush begin planning the war on Iraq?   According to  urlLink Foxnews , "President Bush secretly ordered a war plan drawn up against Iraq less than two months after U.S. forces attacked Afghanistan and was so worried the decision would cause a furor he did not tell everyone on his national security team, says a new book on his Iraq policy."   In the war's wake, which top administration officials now barely speak to each other?    According to  urlLink Reuters ," Vice President Dick Cheney  and  Secretary of State Colin Powell  are so upset with one another over the Iraq war that they are barely on speaking terms, according to excerpts from a new book published in the Washington Post on Saturday. The book, entitled  urlLink 'Plan of Attack ,' is not due to be released until next week but the Post's assistant managing editor,  Robert Woodward , wrote it and the newspaper is reporting from it."    Which foreign dignitary was told of the plans to attack Iraq days before even key cabinet members were briefed?    (ed note 4/19: Originally, I wrote that this was  urlLink Tony Blair . Of course, now we know it was  urlLink Prince Bandar of Saudi Arabia .)    Which key advisers did President Bush ask -- and not ask -- about whether he should go to war with Iraq?    According to the  urlLink NY Times , "The exact timing of Mr. Bush's request to Mr. Rumsfeld to begin war planning had not been publicly known, and it had not been known that, as the book reports, Mr. Bush kept that request secret from other top advisers, including Mr. Powell, Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, and George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence."   Why did the CIA think Saddam had been killed before the ground war even began?    urlLink The New York Times reports : "The book also provides new details about the hurriedly arranged airstrike on March 19, 2003, in which the White House jump-started the war with a bomb and missile strike on the Dora Farms compound near Baghdad in a failed attempt to kill Saddam.  "The air raid, advocated by  Tenet , had initially been opposed by Franks, the book says, but was approved by Bush and Cheney after they asked other advisers to leave the Oval Office.  "The strike was launched, the book says, on the basis of first-hand reports from Iraqi sources at Dora Farms enlisted by a network of 87 Iraqi spies, designated with the cryptonym DB/ROCKSTARS, who had been recruited by a CIA team that had infiltrated northern Iraq in the months before the war.  "In calls by satellite phone to the CIA team, the Iraqi sources reported that Saddam's sons Odai and Qusai were at the compound, and that Saddam himself would return there. After the strike, the book says, one Iraqi source reported that Saddam's body had been removed from the wreckage, prompting Tenet to celebrate what he thought had been a success.  "Even now, it is still not clear whether Saddam was at the site at all, though a CIA official said Friday that the agency maintains that Saddam was "probably" there and survived the U.S. raid. Woodward's book reports that the Iraqi security guard who was the main source of the intelligence was killed in the U.S. attack, but a CIA official said the Iraqi agents recruited by the agency had proved 'extraordinarily productive.'"  And, the  urlLink Washington Post gives this excerpt :  "(Hans) Blix had told Rice, 'I have never complained about your military pressure. I think it's a good thing.' She relayed this to the president.   "'How long does he think I can do this?' Bush asked. 'A year? I can't. The United States can't stay in this position while Saddam plays games with the inspectors.'   "'You have to follow through on your threat,' Rice said. 'If you're going to carry out coercive diplomacy, you have to live with that decision.'   "'He's getting more confident, not less,' Bush said of Hussein. 'He can manipulate the international system again. We're not winning.   "'Time is not on our side here,' Bush told Rice. 'Probably going to have to, we're going to have to go to war.'   "In Rice's mind, this was the moment the president decided the United States would go to war with Iraq. Military planning had been underway for more than a year even as Bush sought a diplomatic solution through the  United Nations . He would continue those efforts, at least publicly, for 10 more weeks, but he had reached a point of no return.   "The president also informed  Karl Rove , his chief political strategist, of his decision over the holidays. Rove had gone to Crawford to brief Bush on the confidential plan for Bush's 2004 reelection campaign. While  Laura Bush  sat reading a book, Rove gave a  PowerPoint  presentation on the campaign's strategy, themes and timetable.   "Opening his laptop, he displayed for Bush in bold letters on a dark blue background:   " urlLink PERSONA :   " urlLink Strong Leader    " urlLink Bold Action     urlLink Big Ideas    " urlLink Peace in World    " urlLink More Compassionate America    " urlLink Cares About People Like Me    " urlLink Leads a Strong Team    "All things being equal, the president asked, when would you like to begin the campaign and active fundraising?   "Rove said he wanted the president to start that February or March and begin raising the money, probably $200 million. He had a schedule. In February, March and April 2003, there would be between 12 and 16 fundraisers.   "'We got a war coming,' the president told Rove flatly, 'and you're just going to have to wait.' He had decided. 'The moment is coming.' The president did not give a date, but he left the impression with Rove that it would be January or February or March at the latest.   "'Remember the problem with your dad's campaign,' Rove replied. 'A lot of people said he got started too late.'   "'I understand,' Bush said. 'I'll tell you when I'm comfortable with you starting.'"

But it was evidently worth it: 'It's the best movie that [Anderson] has ever made,' Murray said. 'I'm proud of everything that's on the screen.' When an audience member blurted out that Murray was robbed of the Oscar for 'Lost in Translation,' he smiled and assured that audience, 'I'm really okay... I don't care about the prizes.

He said that most of the world (population-wise) was so poor, that if us wealthier ones didn’t do something about improving their lot in life, there would be worse problems for all of us.

We still love you, David.  Someone's got to cover the rich .   Out : Cheney.  urlLink The Washington Post's William Hamilton writes today :  "Woodward describes a relationship between  Cheney  and Secretary of State  Colin L. Powell  that became so strained Cheney and Powell are barely on speaking terms. Cheney engaged in a bitter and eventually winning struggle over Iraq with Powell, an opponent of war who believed Cheney was obsessively trying to establish a connection between Iraq and the al Qaeda terrorist network and treated ambiguous intelligence as fact.   "Powell felt Cheney and his allies -- his chief aide,  I. Lewis 'Scooter' Libby ; Deputy Defense Secretary  Paul D. Wolfowitz ; and Undersecretary of Defense for Policy  Douglas J. Feith  and what Powell called Feith's 'Gestapo' office -- had established what amounted to a separate government. The vice president, for his part, believed Powell was mainly concerned with his own popularity and told friends at a dinner he hosted a year ago celebrating the outcome of the war that Powell was a problem and 'always had major reservations about what we were trying to do.'   "Before the war with Iraq, Powell bluntly told Bush that if he sent U.S. troops there "you're going to be owning this place." Powell and his deputy and closest friend, Richard L. Armitage, used to refer to what they called 'the Pottery Barn rule' on Iraq: 'You break it, you own it,' according to Woodward."  So, do you think Cheney will claim "health issues" and quit the ticket in Spring, or right before the convention?

       T-Minus 3 Days to Woodward 60 Minutes Bombshell    President Bush secretly ordered a war plan drawn up against Iraq less than two months after U.S. forces attacked Afghanistan    In three days  urlLink Bob Wodward appears on 60 Minutes  to detonate nuclear powered revelations about the Bush Administrations readiness in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The CBS web site reads:  "Woodward interviewed 75 of the people who helped prepare for the war, including President Bush – the only source who speaks for attribution -- in the upcoming book, “Plan of Attack,” published by Simon & Schuster. Both CBSNews.com and Simon & Schuster are units of Viacom."  Hmm. I guess  urlLink Drudge really got to them . The web site goes on to say:  "In the interview, Woodward talked about how the administration was able to finance secret preparations for the Iraq war.   "'President Bush, after a National Security Council meeting, takes  urlLink Don Rumsfeld  aside, collars him physically and takes him into a little cubbyhole room and closes the door and says, 'What have you got in terms of plans for Iraq?' What is the status of the war plan? I want you to get on it. I want you to keep it secret,' says Woodward.   "'...The end of July 2002, they need $700 million, a large amount of money for all these tasks. And the president approves it. But Congress doesn't know and it is done. They get the money from a supplemental appropriation for the Afghan War, which Congress has approved. ...Some people are gonna look at a document called the Constitution which says that no money will be drawn from the treasury unless appropriated by Congress. Congress was totally in the dark on this.'"   urlLink According to CBS :  "Woodward will answer the following questions, among others, in the interview with Wallace Sunday night:   -How early did President Bush begin planning the war on Iraq?  -In the war’s wake, which top administration officials now barely speak to each other?  -What did the CIA say to President Bush to convince him that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction?  -Which foreign dignitary was told of the plans to attack Iraq days before even key cabinet members were briefed?  -Which key advisers did President Bush ask – and not ask – about whether he should go to war with Iraq?  -Why did the CIA think Saddam had been killed before the ground war even began?"  According to  urlLink Foxnews , " President Bush  secretly ordered a war plan drawn up against Iraq less than two months after U.S. forces attacked Afghanistan and was so worried the decision would cause a furor he did not tell everyone on his national security team, says a new book on his Iraq policy.  "Bush feared that if news got out about the Iraq plan as U.S. forces were fighting another conflict, people would think he was too eager for war, journalist  Bob Woodward  writes in  urlLink Plan of Attack , a behind-the-scenes account of the 16 months leading to the Iraq invasion.   " The Associated Press  obtained a copy of the book, which will be available in book stores next week.   "'I knew what would happen if people thought we were developing a potential war plan for Iraq,' Bush is quoted as telling Woodward. 'It was such a high-stakes moment and ... it would look like that I was anxious to go to war. And I'm not anxious to go to war.'   "Bush and his aides have denied accusations they were preoccupied with Iraq at the cost of paying attention to the Al Qaeda terrorist threat before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.   "A commission investigating the attacks just concluded several weeks of extraordinary public testimony from high-ranking government officials. One of them, former counterterrorism chief  Richard Clarke , charged the Bush administration's determination to invade Iraq undermined the war on terror.   "Woodward's account fleshes out the degree to which some members of the administration, particularly  Vice President Dick Cheney , were focused on  Saddam Hussein  from the onset of Bush's presidency and even after the terrorist attacks made the destruction of Al Qaeda the top priority."  The story continues on  urlLink Foxnews :  "The book says  Bush  told  Rumsfeld  to keep quiet about it and when the defense secretary asked to bring  CIA Director George Tenet  into the planning at some point, the president said not to do so yet.   "Even Bush's national security adviser,  Condoleezza Rice , was apparently not fully briefed. Woodward said Bush told her that morning he was having Rumsfeld work on Iraq but did not give details.   "In an interview two years later, Bush told Woodward that if the news had leaked, it would have caused 'enormous international angst and domestic speculation.'   "The Bush administration's drive toward war with Iraq raised an international furor anyway, alienating long-time allies who did not believe the White House had made a sufficient case against Saddam. Saddam was toppled a year ago and taken into custody last December. But the central figure of  Al Qaeda ,  Usama bin Laden , remains at large and a threat to the West.   " urlLink The book  says  Gen. Tommy Franks , who was in charge of the Afghan war as head of  Central Command ,  uttered a string of obscenities   ( ed note : italics mine-- R Mwangaguhunga) when the Pentagon told him to come up with an Iraq war plan in the midst of fighting another conflict.   And the story continues, on  urlLink Foxnews :  "Woodward, a Washington Post journalist who wrote an earlier book on Bush's anti-terrorism campaign and broke the Watergate scandal with Carl Bernstein, says Cheney's well-known hawkish attitudes on Iraq were frequently decisive in Bush's decision-making.   "Cheney pressed the outgoing Clinton administration to brief Bush on the Iraq threat before he took office, Woodward writes.   "In August 2002, when Bush talked publicly of being a patient man who would weigh Iraqi options carefully, the vice president took the administration's Iraq policy on a harder track in a speech declaring the weapons inspections ineffective.   "Cheney's speech was viewed as the beginning of a campaign to undermine or overthrow Saddam. Woodward said Bush let Cheney make the speech without asking what he would say.   "The vice president also figured prominently in a protracted decision March 19, 2003, to strike Iraq before a 48-hour ultimatum for Saddam Hussein to leave the country had expired.   "When the CIA and its Iraqi sources reported that Saddam's sons and other family members were at a small palace, and Saddam was on his way to join them, Bush's top advisers debated whether to strike ahead of plan.   "Franks was against it, saying it was unfair to move before a deadline announced to the other side, the book says. Rumsfeld and Rice favored the early strike, and Secretary of State Colin Powell leaned that way.   "But Bush did not make his decision until he had cleared everyone out of the Oval Office except the vice president.  'I think we ought to go for it ,' ( ed note : italiscs mine -R. Mwangaguhunga) Cheney is quoted as saying. Bush did.   "U.S. forces unleashed bombs and cruise missiles, blanketing the compound but missing the palace. Tenet called the White House before dawn to say the Iraqi leader had been killed. But his optimism was premature. Saddam was alive."   urlLink 60 Minutes  is on Sunday at 7 pm on CBS.

       Ivana Trump is Jealous of The Donald   It is no surprise that  urlLink Ivana Trump is jealous  of her ex husband The Donald, as temperance is not a part of the Trump genetic makeup. That significant cultural artifact,  urlLink Star Magazine reports  that Ivana cannot take The Donald's success:  "'She is so jealous of him,' says a close friend of Donald. 'Every time he does something and it's a success,  urlLink she gets more and more bitter . When The Apprentice took off, she had nothing but venom to spew. She told all their mutual friends Donald's success was a fluke. She said that he doesn't have any charm or charisma in front of the camera and that  urlLink she could do a better job . She said  urlLink she is the true Trump star .'"  Of course, she may have a reason as she negotiated her alimony settlement when The Donald was  urlLink in financial straights . Now -- allegedly -- hie is abillionaire.  urlLink That's got to hurt .   The Star continues:  "Now America may get the chance to decide who is the top Trump star -- in the ultimate reality show war. Sources tell  Star  that Ivana, 55, has signed a deal to star in her own reality show -- which could go head-to-head with the second season of The Apprentice due back on NBC this fall. Though the details have not been finalized, a TV producer who has had talks with Ivana told Star that one premise for the show is 'Girls on Top,' a sort-of 'upscale Average Joe,' with men trying to date successful women. Ivana is also considering other concepts, says another source, including a reality series about older women and younger men -- which has obvious appeal to Ivana, who's been  urlLink dating Italian model  and dancer  urlLink Rossano Rubicondi , 32, for the past two years."  What happened to that  urlLink dodgy pseudo Count  she was dating?   "Sources close to both Donald and Ivana agree that watching him hit it big convinced her to do a show of her own. "Seeing the success Donald is having with The Apprentice fueled Ivana's desire to do her own show and has given her the impetus to move forward with it," says Ivana's friend,  Vivian Serota . Once Ivana saw her ex's runaway success, Donald's friend says, she became determined to compete, even pitching a few different ideas to producers -- including  Mark Burnett , executive producer of The Apprentice. When asked if she was planning her own reality show, Ivana would only say, 'We'll see. Never say never.'"  And the article concludes:  "But while Donald's net worth is estimated at $2.5 billion -- he claims it's more than twice that -- insiders estimate hers at $40 to 50 million, a relative pittance. A TV producer tells Star that Ivana is practically salivating over Donald's Apprentice earnings. 'Ivana has been looking at ways to get a reality TV show largely because she's seeing how much money Donald is making,' a source says -- reportedly $5.2 million for the season."  Ivana salivating over money?  Nooooo .  Check out  urlLink The Star .

But it wasn't.  urlLink Prescott Bush , father of the first President Bush and the grandfather of the current President, stole my  urlLink bones , just as the American governoment took away from me freedom in the final years of my life. This is a crime, this captivity of my bones, which has led me to  urlLink roam unburied , unable to enter the happy hunting ground.    urlLink Prescott Bush stole my bones  from Fort Sill, OKlahoma, for the pleasure of his secret society  urlLink Skull and Bones .    urlLink I wish  to be buried in the Triplet Mountains, but the frat boys at Skull and Bones, the gatekeepers of power, will not let me, an old Apache chief, achieve his final reward.   They dug up my body in 1918. My body is at the Skull and Bones Museum. The Skull and Bones Society admitted that it held my remains as early as 1986. The palefaces hold my remains in a glass cage. The Skull and Bones Society log book records the 1918 grave robbery.   According to the Skull and Bones log book entry, Prescott Bush, grandfather of George W. Bush, and five other officers at Fort Sill, Okla.,  urlLink desecrated my grave .   I ask the current President (S&B, '68) or even John Kerry (S&amp;B, '66) or even the first president Bush (S&amp;B, '48) to atone for the sins of your grandfather. Please give my bones back to the Apache people, so that I can be buried on Apache land. I was born on the prairies where the wind blew free and there was nothing to break the light of the sun. I was born where there were no enclosures. And now I am  urlLink trapped in these stone walls .

       Overlooked Classics   Most of this was posted on February 18th, but since some new people have come along since then, I thought I'd republish it with some additions of overlooked classics:  What the fuck was up with  urlLink this ? When I was a kid  urlLink the dummy in Magic  kept me up. Screaming. Crazy ...   urlLink Stoned, the Afterschool Special with Scott Baio . "Super Stoned Jack," was the scariest introduction that most of us had to the world of the sweet leaf. Sensimila? Not if you have any sensibilities! The tag line for this read:  "Jack is a motivated high school student who smokes cannabis for the first time, and falls in with a fast crowd. Will he wake up and realize what he's doing with his future before it's too late?"   If I were  stoned  I would never go out in a row boat on the grey and greasy river limpopo.  Well , certainly not after seeing this little chestnut of a public service announcement made by anxious parents of latchkey kids in the Age of Studio 54. Put it on Trio so we can all laugh at the "reefer madness." Just say  yes  to that Farah Fawcett haired character Felicity. But I'm sure skeevy New York Times writer  Neill Strauss  will.   Dummy .  urlLink Gritty 70s drama  of urban social decline -- thanks,  Ed Koch !  Asshole ! Back in the Koch day, NYC was all about twitchy pimps with straightrazors and purple suits with ruffled shitrs and jewel encrusted goblets wandering the urban landscape (hey, come to think of it,  urlLink the pimpy fashion sensibility  is very ... umm...  urlLink priest -like), as well as greaser glue sniffing graffiti punks roaming the streets in search of a little of the old  ultraviolence . Koch turned NYC into a  Guns n Roses  video, with  Mr. Brownstone  creeping around Central Park in a raincoat with nothing on underneath!   Get  this  plot, though, peeps:  LeVar Burton  plays a  deaf  and  dumb  mute who is framed for the death of a prostitute (Kuta Kinte, you are a  framed  man!). But will we get  justice  for the amiable host of  urlLink Reading Rainbow ?    Anyhoo : Will a young  Paul Sorvino  get him redemption when he cannot even communicate with his morose client? Or will "Dummy" just become another urban statistic on the Koch street?  Despite the overall bleakness, this a very,  very  cool slice of social commentary.   urlLink Bugsy Malone . This was the shit when I was a kid. Scott "Chachi" Baio, who, incidentally, Hollywood has not been kind to, is in a period gangester flic ... only  everyone is little kids . Crazy.    urlLink Jodie Foster  plays an oversexed  Tallulah Bankhead  rip off. There's a gangster called Fat Sam. And the whole crazy 70s scenario is about spud guns. There is a veiled sense of poking fun at the Cold War here.  urlLink I loved this movie . I wish Trio would put it back on (" urlLink anybody who is anybody  will soon walk through that door/ at fat sams grand slam speakeasy")   Poldark:   This cult British tv series is quite habit forming. Incredible. Just  urlLink incredible . A period piece that is a cross between  Wuthering Heights ,  the Mayor of Casterbridge  and  Le Liaisons Dangereuse  but with a compelling soap opera character at its heart. A guilty high quality pleasure. You get sucked in to this costume drama that is one part  Danielle Steele  and one part high art.   Assorted Good Times episodes:  Come on, you know you had a crush on  Wilona  ("and you too, Wilomena" said the archetypical corrupt pol,  Alderman Davis ) when you were kid, didn't you -- the only blingy woman in the projects; or, if you were a girl,  Bookman the janitor  was your  long, cold drink of water . What, you never saw a black man doing a  John Wayne  impression,  pilgrim ? You better  act like you know . And you know in your heart Wilona saved  Janet Jackson  from falling down that elevator shaft while trying to escape her mom who beat her with a hot iron just before she became Willis' girl, then  Cleo  on Fame.("and you too, Winooski")  Remember the episode where Michael gets  crunk  off some dodgy ghetto "health tonic" (aka, muscatel) with a dangerously high alcohol content? Crazy.  urlLink classic  ("Get  Vita Brite  and sleep tonight" ...*promptly passes out*).   Then there was the time Michael joined a gang and hid his jacket in the oven, which prompted  JJ  to note that the smell emanating from the kitchen was an improvement on Thelma's cooking.  Oh , what about the one where Thelma almost married this polygamist Nigerian cat.  Crazy ! What about that  pimpy  guy "Lennay," who always sold  hot  appliances from out of his coat.  Classic . So was the episode when James has hypertension. So was ...  hey  ... was this  urlLink a comedy or what ? ("and you too, Winifred")   Cinema Paradiso . The best work of art on the subject of friendship I've ever encountered.  The Corsair  lost a couple of tears in his  Cutty Sark  at the end of this one. Any classroom reading of urlLink  Artistotle  on Friendship should include a look at this film.   urlLink Shields and Yarnell . Come on, you know you liked it -- mime, dance and comedy sketches. What more could you want? Okay, talent is valid.   urlLink Fellini's Satyricon . A pagan work. Un-be- fucking -lievable: creativity on a galactic scale.  Nino Roti's  sonic assault of wierd music alone is worth the DVD price. The Rablasian Fellini walks us through Roman antiquity as he imagines it, crossed with highbrow science fiction sequences of an imagined future looking backwards. There can never be anyone as Felliniesque as Fellini. Fellini has this really odd little maneuver, where the actors are frequently lstanding still, ooking into the camera, which creates a very disturbing effect. Throughout the film -- the Minotaur spares Acyltus from a bludgeoning, promting cosmic laughter at the end(the absurd universe?), then the rambling journey winding through the labyrinthine whorehouse at the beginning, with those withering close ups of the freaky pagan denizens therein, then the  elaborate fake funeral at Trimalchio's dinner (eating and dying was all Trimalchio was about) -- all give off the combined effect that  the film is laughing at you, the viewer . From some distance outside of time the film is laughing at the viewer. Very, very strange effect, that. Also, the world's first  urlLink werewolf tale.    Carl Sagan's Cosmos : Okay, so in the madcap world of  urlLink astrophysics Sagan's hypotheses are probably all outmoded already . Right? So what? So is  urlLink Ptolemy's Almagest  and yet I still read it in college and gained benefit. The methods by which man came to his conclusions about the universe are worthy of contemplation; and, of course, worthy of more questions in light of our most current data. Cosmos is no exception. This series was the bomb! ( looks around sheepishly, then raises hand , " question : who is the biggest  PBS  geek in the room"?) Classics are never outmoded.     urlLink Chespirito . This show was a mystery to me: Why would a grown Latin man in need of some excercise want to go on tv dressed like a racy little bumble bee number emblazoned with a big "CH" on his paunch.  Subtitle it  and put it on Trio; I'd watch it just to clarify my childhood mystery. I'd like to crack open a cold cerveza and figure this out.  What the fuck was going on here ? Why is everyone else laughing but me? I feel like I'm in a Fellini movie, but it is in Spanish and the sets are decidedly low rent. We'd all like to know what the people on that endless laugh track find so fucking hilarious.   Fame the TV Series : Why are there not repeats on  VH1  of this show already? When you say low budget and high quality I think ..  right here's where you start paying for it ... with pain ... and sweat . The show of young, artistic people struggling for their moment to shine is about as American as it gets and less cruel than Donald Trump's Apprentice, where sharky career advancement is all about crippling the competition. Whatever happened to that sexy cello player who wouldn't give anyone the time of day,  urlLink Lori Singer . I was all about the emotional cellist yet frosty behaving  Lori Singer  back in the day.  Yummy.    Cries and Whispers  by  Ingmar Bergman . If Black Stallion is the most beautifully shot film, then this is number two. All natural lighting. Bergman uses a fade to red to seperate scenes, mimicking the inner membrane of our eyelids. About as fucking intense as art can get. And halfway through this film about communication and treachery -- where the incessant ticking of an pocketwatch reminds us of time's passage -- Bergman dissolves a reconcilliation scene between two hard hearted sisters into  urlLink Bach's Sarabande no. 5 in D minor . That's so fucking cool it hurts to just write it (*sips  Cutty Sark  to steady hisself*)   The Black Stallion:  Those fabulous Copollas! This is perhaps the most beautiful filmed movie ever. From the point of view of a boy. The Black Stallion is really the restrictive society. Very 70s. The image of the horse adrift in the Pacific Ocean, a burning ship sinking in the background, and the boy, by pure instinct, snatching the floating rope as it passed, is straight out of  urlLink Jung .   The Gore Vidal-Bill Buckley Debate-Fight  It was in the heart of the 60s: the polarized political center of the 60s. The left and the right clash violently  on national television . In the  news division  of a  respectable network .  Fuck!  A  classic . The country was divided in those days is an understatement.  Excellent . Buckley is the Grandfather of the American conservative movement; Vidal the leading leftist rhetorician (lefties don't organize hierarchical movements, it goes against type). For a moment, our two leading intellectuals of our two political polarities went at it in a bareknuckled intellectual fistfight. Not since  urlLink Burr shot Hamilton dead  has there been so much political drama in The Republic. Was there something in the water in the late 60s, or was everyone just  crezzzzy.    Woody Allen's Teleplay:  Don't Drink the Water .  One of the  urlLink most interesting  experiments on television ever.  Woody Allen  directs and writes a teleplay starring  Michael J Fox  and the kid who played  Blossom . Shaky handheld camera follows a grown  Michael J. Fox  as he slowly becomes involved with a bright but much younger woman. How the fuck did this get on American and not Parisian tv? Aren't we supposed to be puritainical? Did Woody Allen have so much juice back in the day that he could put on pedophilic Americana on network tv? Does the story sound familiar?  Actually  the story is tame, and inventive and very, very arty.   Kramer vs. Kramer.  The first dramatic and fully articulated statement of the Baby Boomers achieving adulthood.  A film of the first water. Young married couple breaks apart. They become two seperate people post sexual revolution. Wife leaves shallow workaholic husband and baby. Goes out West. Comes back revitalized. In the meantime, shallow husband defined by his work, like an Eisenhower-era man, like--probably--his father changes,  grows . Welcome to 1978, motherfucker.   Husband fights custody.  Bach  and  Vivaldi  weave in and out of this drama that takes place, it seems, embroidered into the most poignant colors of Autumn in Central Park, from skeletal oranges to deep cloody oches and emerald greens. Those colors and Bach and Vivaldi accurately reflect the heightened emotion of the drama -- the decisive break from the previous Eisenhower-era, the divorce and emancipation of the Boomers in film.  And the courtroom scene where  Meryl Streep  slowly dissolves into tears offset bya  forced composure (better than  Jane Fonda  in Klute) as Hoffman's lawyer vivisects her irresponibility -- her feminism, her 1978ness -- are among the  best goddamned  acting you ever will see. Kramer versus Kramer is as good as film gets.   Whatever happened to Slim Goodbody?   True, he was slim.  Very  slim. Okay,  urlLink John Burstein  was the classic  urlLink ectomorph geek . But we were  urlLink wild and innocent  youth at the time. What were we to know about cool? But even as a kid, I did pick up a certain ... nervousness. Now, maybe that had to do with a really fast metabolism on his part. Or, maybe it's just the plain fact that dressing up in his mom's panty hose with your innards haphazardly pained on them  isn't  the best way to make a living. And add on to that the fact that he did this in front of kids. In the name of (makes broad ironical quotation marks with his fingers) " health education ."  Said ectomorph with an afro would actually sing these horrible --  horrible  -- rockabilly ditties and dance this really spastic jazzercize numbers, chicken legs flapping in the wind, all in full view of kids. How lame is that?   When I was a kid at the  urlLink UN School  it was considered lame to watch Slim Goodbody. Nowadays similar social leprosy could be gained from admitting to the consumption of  urlLink Benson and Hedges cigarettes , or purchasing a  urlLink Kenny G album .   For whatever unfathomable reason of the childhood cruelty of my generation, the Yemeni Ambassador's kid at the UN School was considered  a geek . Kids are old school like that. Now, in his early 30s, that kid is right about now a mid level official in the tyranny there, taking out all his childhood aggressions on innocent civilians.  Shit happens : I can't be held accountable.   Anyhoo : Even that kid -- let's call him  the monkeyboy  -- he thought  Slim Goodbody  was lame.  That  guy. And you know your up shits creek without a paddle if your shtick cannot appeal to the undiscriminating tastes of the Yemeni Ambassor's kid.   urlLink Matthew Starr  pretended to be an earthling, but he was really the Crown Prince of the Planet  Quadris . His father was overthrown by tyrants, so he was sent here to develop his telekenetic powers then go back to throw down some furious anger at his oppressors. His mentor is  Louis Grossett Junior , who also pretends to be his science teacher.   As opposed to, say,  urlLink Bennu of the Golden Light , who is a messenger from an alien world, a scout. Bennu is looking for his lost companion,  Mira . He aids people in distress with his freaky magical amulet.  You better recognize .   urlLink Alan Fawcett  was the host of a show which scored pantomimers on originality, appearance and lip synch.    urlLink Quincy's  understanding of forensic medicine was way ahead of it's time for prime time tv. He,  Quincy , of the LA Coroner's office. He lived on a boat, was a 70s swinger, and played detective to find evidence to support his theories of unexplained deaths. This did not endear  urlLink Jack Klugman  to the  urlLink po-po .   urlLink Greg Evigan  played the independent trucker  BJ McCay . He was a medevac pilot in the Nam and, somehow, managed to smuggle a chimp named  Bear  back with him. Living in a truck has it's advantages, as he croons in the theme song, "Best of all, I don't pay  property tax ."  Sheriff Lobo  was always on his ass for something or other. Quite possibly this was tax related.   Robert Gulliame  -- who insists that he is not  Haitian/caribeat , played an upwardly mobile household executive-budget director-Lt. Governor,  urlLink Benson DuBois . (*snickers*  DuBois?)  His plight  mirrored  the rise of African Americans throughout the 70s, more accurately than  Good Times  (the low estimate) or  The Jeffersons  (an inflated estimate of the African American plight). He bantered with the Wagnerian housekeeper  urlLink Gretchen Krauss , played so ably, ironically by the Nebraska-born  Inga Swenson .  urlLink That freaky kid Missy Gold  with the big eyes and the adult dialogue kind of wierded me out. She harshed on my  urlLink "I'd Like To Buy The World A Coke"  70s vibe.  So,  now you know .

       Chris Rock Dodges The Crack Trap    I've been hard on  urlLink Neil Strauss , and those of you who have been reading me a while know that I have been hard on  urlLink Jann Wenner and Rolling Stone . That having been said, the April 29, 2004 issue is fantastic. Let's leave aside  urlLink Uma Thurman , who, in an interview, defends  urlLink Ethan Hawke's infidelity  with a  urlLink Buddhist assessment  of his " urlLink intentions ", and everybody's favorite possum eating  urlLink hillbilly  celebrity  Billy Bob Thornton  saying, a propos of nothing, as hillbillies are wont to do, " I like waitresses. I met one at a waffle house in Nashville that I don't know if the devil could have charmed her ..."  Thanks for sharing, Billy Bob !   But, No, none of that&nbsp;piffle crosses our radar, the  real  nuclear explosion comes from a  urlLink Chris Rock  interview by none other than our boy  Neil Strauss . A&nbsp;unusually&nbsp;bold&nbsp;observation about "the rock"&nbsp;turns Chris "Rock" very,  very &nbsp;reflective ... a very special Corsair (soft piano music):    Strauss : So did you ever try crack?    Rock : The closest thing I ever got to doing crack was selling crack. Me and a friend of mine, we took these jobs at a camp just to make money. We were going to get paid a thousand or two thousand at the end of the summer and take that and buy some crack to sell. But of course he got hooked on crack before we could go out and do it. And then, right after that, God braught comedy into my life.    Strauss : I wonder what would have happened if you had started selling it?    Rock : Who knows what would have happened. I would have been dumb enough to have done it. I'm not saying, 'If I wasn't for comedy, I'd be selling crack.' But I rememeber sitting with my friends, cutting up the coke like it was yesterday: cocaine, lactose, vitamin B12. Cook it up -- crack. I am so lucky I never tried crack. The most I did was put some coke on my tongue."   Bravo to  Neil Strauss  for asking the hard questions and  Rolling Stone  to briefly getting back to hard hitting stories. And good for Rock, who dodged a bullet that ravaged the inner city in the 80s. But, Chris, hey --  urlLink lactose in the inner city ?

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In : The new tell all Vogue editrix's  urlLink Anna Wintour  bio.  urlLink Page Six  says of the bio: "'The book will deal with how viciously Anna went after  urlLink Grace Mirabella  when Grace was editor of  American Vogue  and Anna was creative director,' tattles our source. 'Anna was gunning for Grace's job, and eventually got it when  S.I. Newhouse  fired Grace and replaced her with Anna.'" Hot damn, this is better than  urlLink Dynasty .   Another Wintour's Tale,  urlLink Fashionweekdaily reports  on  Plum Sykes'  Bergdorf Blondes Book Party (you know, the party where  urlLink Amy Fine Collins  fainted):  "At the end of the night, crowds of 15+ filled descending elevators. But when Anna, (her son) Charlie and  urlLink Shelby  (Bryan) departed for the evening, not a soul stepped into their elevator, and everyone opted to take the next one down. 'She had what you could call the VIP elevator of the night,' quipped one of the waiting guests."  And: "Anna’s assistants refused to let  urlLink Patrick McMullan upstairs  to shoot, but when a bevy of beauties walked out of an elevator and proceeded to air-kiss Patrick,  urlLink he was waved through ." You can't stop  The Patrick .   Out :  urlLink Lil Kim's Court Date . Lil Kim  urlLink isn't looking her best . She looks likr the type of person who travels via the Ricky Lake limo service. Ah, the blush is off the rose,  urlLink Lil Kim . As  urlLink Millie Vanilli  lip synched, poignantly, touchingly, "It's a tragedy for me to see, the dream is over."   In :  Dick Morris . Once again, Morris, the brandy swilling Francofile former " urlLink John " makes an acute political observation. According to  urlLink Page Six . A political expert told the Sixers  "'If Kerry names (Hillary Clinton) his running mate, the book's release will suddenly be delayed until after the election,' ...  Dick Morris  - whose own book, 'Rewriting History' (a play on Hillary's "Living History"), is due out May 4 (said): 'I think that is very possible. I think that it is also a bit of a threat . . . that if [Kerry] does not choose Hillary, Bill will dominate the environment during the campaign and distract attention from the ticket. If Bill, who has trouble finishing anything and procrastinates constantly, actually finishes the book, there is a reason. Likely she was nagging him to do it so he could raise the pressure for her.'"    Out : James Carville. Accroding to  urlLink Lloyd Grove , "That was  urlLink James Carville  being refused seating at the  urlLink '21' Club  Tuesday night because he was wearing his usual starched and pressed (but verboten at '21') jeans. The Ragin' Cajun had arrived to help his wife,  urlLink Mary Matalin , celebrate the publication of her book  urlLink 'Letters to My Daughters'  at a dinner hosted by  Simon & Schuster  honcho  David Rosenthal . But the maitre d' vetoed the jeans, so Carville rushed around the corner to  Brooks Brothers  and bought an $80 pair of khakis."   In : Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis.  urlLink Ananova reports , "Johnny Depp says he would never ask his Vanessa Paradis to marry him as it would ruin her 'perfect name'. He said he often thought about proposing to the mother of his two children, but the name issue had held him back. 'It's so perfect and so beautiful,' Johnny said. 'It would be a drag to stick her with Paradis-Depp. It's like a flat note.'  "But he said he would not hesitate if she was to propose to him: 'She's the woman of my life. I would do it in a second.'"  Spoken like true  urlLink Gemini .   Out : The Democratic Leadership Council.  urlLink Bob Shrum , the  Karl Rove  of the Kerry campaign is an unreformed old fashioned liberal. Any pandering to the center  Bill Clinton  style will not be tolerated. Shrum comes from the Robert Kennedy tradition of the Democratic Party. So, buh bye to the DLC types, buh bye  urlLink Paul Begala .   In :  George Hickenlooper's  new indie documentary " urlLink Mayor of the Sunset Strip " about the very odd but interesting  urlLink DJ Bingenheimer , who is famous for knowing famous people,  urlLink Indiewire's Wendy Mitchell  writes: " ... Hickenlooper's documentary isn't all a rock-and-roll party; it also looks at Bingenheimer's disturbing obsession with celebrity and his troubled real-life relationships."    Out :  urlLink Jenny Garner .  urlLink Alias  ... the daughter of the beast. "And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his MARK, and over the number of (her) name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God."

Please help me  urlLink stop the daughter of the beast.    In : Awww, Courtney. Why is it that the thought of Courtney makes us all feel all warm and protective about her?  urlLink The Scoop  has a down and out Courtney Love bemoaning her fate. "'I’m covered with loser dust,' Kurt Cobain’s widow griped to Blender magazine. Love and her daughter, Frances Bean, did the interview for the mag, according to a source who saw the issue that hits newsstands next week. 'I can’t even get an autographed Charmed poster for my daughter.'” Awww, Courtney. We still love you.    Out :  urlLink JLo .  urlLink According to Ananova , who got some advance on JLo's Inside the Actors Studio appearance (I know, I know, I'm wondering what she's doing there as well), Ms. Lopez regrets the nickname.    In : A very strange thing happened last week on  urlLink TMLTMF . The usual no holes barred pop culture banter was replaced, if only briefly, by the most fucking intelligent debate on the nature of Art. That shit was outrageous. Who knew?  urlLink Crazy .

       An Open Pitch To Mark Burnett    urlLink Mark, baby :  Have I got a pitch for you. Are you ready. Hold on to your socks:  Kids Fight Club .  Are you still with me?    I know a media savvy guy like you observed the kudos given out to the  urlLink SNL Fear Factor Junior  parody. Cute, but it has a poverty of vision. Now, Kids beating the snot out of each other?  This is cutting edge . This is bigger than the two of us, Mark. I'm talking "babies with rabies."  "The tribe has spoken," is the tagline for Survivor. "You're fired," is the Apprentice. And what about us?   "Two kids enter ...  one kid exits ."  Who to host? We get a no name. Kids further down the show business food chain are more pliant. There are a million hungry stage mothers on the Upper West Side waiting for this shot, ready to kill or be killed --  so to speak .  We do this right and we could build a franchise. I'm talking amateur kids fight clubs at Disneyworld, Mark.   We shoot around Manilla for the summer. They don't have issues with a little kid-on kid-violence in that part of the world, Mark.   Press? If we get the edgy crowd on our side, we're safe. Baby smackdowns are beyond good and evil: it's controversial. And if the  John Stossels  of the world get in our grill, we go Zen. Fall back. Fuck 'em.  Does the oak flinch at the bamboo shoot?  Take it to heart, Mark; this is money in the bank.  Call me?

       Britney: OnTourage    urlLink CNN reports  (via  urlLink Hollywood Reporter ), "Representatives for the pop princess are shopping a reality series featuring backstage footage of her life on tour, according to sources.  "Being pitched with the pun-style title 'OnTourage,' the series would follow the lives of Spears and her fellow dancers on the upcoming European leg of the Onyx Hotel Tour, her steamy concert series.   "'OnTourage' is being described as a cross between MTV's 'The Real World' and 1991's 'Madonna: Truth or Dare.' Spears would narrate and even wield a digital camera to chronicle her adventures with her dancers, bodyguards and managers from the tour bus to the stage."  I'm not  quite sure  if I would pitch a show mentioning it's similarity to Madonna's  Truth or Dare  (or, for that matter, any cinematic --  ahem  -- "work" of The Material Girl's, but I know that I need to know all about the adventures of her dancers, her bodyguards and managers from the tour bus to the stage.

       The President and the 9/11 Commission   Five democrats and five republicans today discussed issues spanning the Clinton and Bush administrations as to how we could be so naive about the threats to our democracy. There were five times as many graduates from Al Quaeda camps as our intelligence academies at the FBI and CIA and yet we still allowed them into our country. In the words of  urlLink Tennyson's March of the Light Brigade , "Forward, the Light Brigade!/ Was there a man dismayed?/ Not though the soldier knew/ Someone had blundered."   urlLink Daniel Patrick Moynihan  was so far  urlLink ahead of his time  on so many issues, like  urlLink international law , and now, it seems, secrecy.    urlLink Moynihan  wrote a book called  urlLink Secrecy  (please  urlLink buy this book  if you are interested in the 9/11 Commissions inquiry into the breakdown and disconnect between our intelligence organizations). On the CIA and FBI's competition he writes:  "Bureaucratic boundaries have also proliferated, although occasionally they have been surmounted by public servants of rare quality. In the case of the CIA and the FBI in the 1990s,  urlLink John M. Deutch  as director of the CIA,  urlLink Jamie Gorelick  as the deputy attorney general, and  urlLink Louis J. Freeh  as director of the FBI have developed guidelines for sharing intelligence information and thereby have successfully reduced tensions between these two rivals. At the top, at all events. In the vaults and tunnels, however, the secret wars have gone on as before."  Such dark language and so prescient. In Secrecy, Moynihan traces the history of governmental secrecy, a twentieth century innovation, and the results are very, very sad. Let's hope that tonight -- George Bush's 12th q and a with the media, he touches, if only briefly, on this. Okay, now on to the fun stuff.

       Fashion Week Daily: Tina Asleep at the Wheel   The people at  urlLink FashionWeekDaily  are almost as obsessed with  Tina Brown  as I am, which is  significant . Okay,  Question : if you cyberstalk someone and you are really, really talented at it,  like I am with Tina  ... then, like, are you  still  stalking or is it just  surveillance . Hmmm....    Anyhoo : Here are some of the questions that they think Tina flubbed when she had  Plum Sykes  on:   "Tina asked : These [Bergdorf blondes] are the girls who are in the party pages of Women’s Wear Daily?  Tina should have asked : The Sykes siblings—there are, like, 10 of you, right?  " Tina asked : Are they going through a phase?  Tina should have asked : What did you eat today?  " Tina asked : What happens if you’re a Bloomingdale’s brunette?  Tina should have asked : And why do you look nothing like your “twin” Lucy?  " Tina asked : Tell me about clinical.  Clinically depressed.  Tina should have asked : Do you wear the same shoes twice?"  And on March 20, we said re: Plummy:  "From  Aaron Gell's  review of  urlLink Plum Sykes' Bergdorf Blondes , from the  urlLink April 2004 W :  "Fashionista-cum-muckraker  Plum Sykes , who apparently spent years researching her novel  Bergdorf Blondes  ( Miramax Books ) by going deep undercover as a glamorous It Girl. The story is told in the voice of a shallow, narcissistic features writer for a major fashion magazine -- a voice Sykes nails with uncanny verisimilitude. Unfortunately, while she name drops all the requisite labels, like the crack fashion caption writer that she once was, the plot she hangs them on is thinner than a  urlLink Louboutin heel , and nowhere near as sturdy. It centers on the breakup of the heroines' engagement (her moody beau is said to be a stand-in for Sykes' former fiance,  Damian Loeb ) and her subsequent quest for another PH (prospective husband) who has his very own PJ (private jet)."   Charmed, I'm sure.   This  Andrew Gell  can write (bows in reverence). His snark is pure.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    DC-Hollywood-NYC Edition    In :  urlLink Dick Morris . Say what you will about our favorite brandy swilling francophile  urlLink "john" , but Dick makes acute political observations. Today he writes in  urlLink his column :  "If the president is not careful, he will discredit his administration and the Republican Party for a decade by insisting on staying in Iraq long after the regime he opposed is toppled, despite casualties, in a frustrating and elusive search for peace and stability in a nation that has never known either. It is only Bush’s obsession with Iraq that could elect Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) president."  I don't know if  Morris  has backdoor access (so to speak) into the Bush White House -- I doubt it, but anything is possible for the man who worked  simultaneously  for  urlLink Trent Lott and Bill Clinton . Machiavelli comes to mind. Bush ought to read Morris' column thoroughly before giving his speech tonight. There is wisdom (and an acute reading of polls and the mood of the people) therein.   Out :  urlLink Barbara Walters . Tacky. Very, very tacky.  urlLink Geraldo may think she's a dame with a great rack  and a set of legs like sticks of dynamite, but  The Corsair  is unimpressed (Also, that's  Geraldo , he thinks Minnie Mouse is hot) . As if it weren't bad enough that Babs introduced into the Art of the Interview game the shameless question, "If you were a tree, what tree would you be?" Now  urlLink Lloyd Grove gives us a peek  inside her palatial Fifth Avenue apartment to find that the tackiness is neverending:  "Suitors called on the 72-year-old Walters at her palatial Fifth Ave. apartment, where she led them on a tour and showed off her 'power wall,' featuring snapshots of herself and virtually every important person on the planet."  A  wall of power ? EEEwwwww. If she were a tree, what tree would she be? A punk ass  urlLink birch .   MIXED :  P Diddy . Honorary African-American  urlLink Michael Musto  gives us some scoop on P Diddy's  urlLink Raisin in the Sun  advance buzz:  "I don't know if  Sean Combs  is going down or not, but I hear that the Raisin in the Sun audience guffaws when his character is excited to get a $10,000 check. The real Diddy is so much less oppressed that  Ralph Carter , from the original production of Raisin (the musical version), bitterly told  Barry Z , 'If I was Sean, I could buy me a show too!'"    In : We  love   urlLink David Patrick Columbia's New York Social Diary . Sure, it is  urlLink whiter than Jenna Bush's legs  (thanks Wonkette), but then, so is the Upper East Side. He has some incredible pictures of ultragorgeous model  Larisa Bond's  birthday party, and some comments:  "Very 60s this moment. Master Event designer  Remco  created a 007 fantasytheme à la  Goldfinger , with rooms of red and gold. Guests played with gold squirt guns filled with  Veuve Clicquot  causing a certain movie star of Gilligan’s Island fame (hint hint) to get up and leave ' I’ve been squirted too many times,' she stated (understandably) impatiently. Why does that sound like so much spam?"   "Remco"?  That "movie star" -- ahem -- would be  urlLink Tina Louise , of the awful plastic surgery.   Out :  urlLink Sofia Blanc de Blancs . I have a thing about  Sofia Coppola . Sure, she wore flats, and she hunches a bit: wouldn't you be if you were  urlLink universally blasted  in your  first acting role as sinking the franchise of the greatest guy movie of all time ? Maybe it's because she is as fanatic about  Bill Murray  as I am (rumor is that she became melancholy waiting for Murray to accept the Lost in Translation role)? I don't know. She has that arty look that I dig, so maybe that goes into the mix as well. But to name a wine after oneself. No, baby, that's just plain  urlLink wrong . Apparently -- I kid you not -- there are cans of wine called "Sofia Mini's." I'd love to make a comment geometrically balanced with just the right amount of wit and saucy humor about the Sophia mini's, but that would be too easy and I'd end up disappointing you.   In :  urlLink The AP  reports that  urlLink Supermodel Carmen Kass  is running for a seat in the European Union parliament under a pro-business party:  "The blonde, blue-eyed Kass - heralded here as one of the best-known and richest Estonians in the world - has brushed aside criticism that she's a neophyte with no political experience and not qualified for public office.   "In an interview earlier this year she said she could help raise Estonia's profile by serving in the European Parliament.   "'I'm entering politics because, for the past 10 years, I've gotten a lot from the world,' she said. 'And everything I've gotten, I've gotten from Estonia. I want to give something back to Estonia.'"   That's right Carmen,  urlLink give back to the community .   Out :  urlLink Vivika Fox . Spread-eagle on the cover of  urlLink Smooth . Damn. Couldn't get that  urlLink Jet centerfold , huh sister?   In : Old Hag. Give us  urlLink ye olde haggis  anyday.   Out : Grover Norquist. Uber sleaze. This man is evil. John Kerry has got to bring his name up and shine light on Norquist, who, often, has been known to hide beneath rocks in Washington. Here is  urlLink John Loftus on Olbermann :  "LOFTUS: Well, you know, it’s a funny story. About a year-and-a-half ago, people in the intelligence community came and said-guys like  urlLink Alamoudi  and  urlLink Sami al-Arian  and other terrorists weren’t being touched because they’d been ordered not to investigate the cases, not to prosecute them, because there were being funded by the Saudis and a political decision was being made at the highest levels, don’t do anything that would embarrass the Saudi government. So, of course I immediately volunteered to do it and I filed a lawsuit, against al-Arian charging him with being a major terrorist for Islamic Jihad, most of his money came from Saudi charities in Virginia.   "Now, Alamoudi’s headquarters were in the same place, he was raided the same day, on March 20. An hour after I filed my lawsuit, the U.S. government finally got off its butt and they raided these offices. And, the stuff that they’re taking out of there now is absolutely horrendous. Al-Arian has now, finally been indicted, an along with Alamoudi, today.   "But, who was it that fixed the cases? How could these guys operate for more than a decade immune from prosecution? And, the answer is coming out in a very strange place. What Alamoudi and al-Arian have in common is a guy named  urlLink Grover Norquist . He’s the super lobbyist.  Newt Gingrich’s  guy, the one the NRA calls on, head of American taxpayers. He is the guy that was hired by Alamoudi to head up the Islamic institute and he’s the registered agent for Alamoudi, personally, and for the Islamic Institute.         "Grover Norquist’s best friend is  Karl Rove , the White House chief of staff, and apparently Norquist was able to fix things. He got extreme right wing Muslim people to be the gatekeepers in the White House. That’s why moderate Americans couldn’t speak out after 9/11. Moderate Muslims couldn’t get into the White House because Norquist’s friends were blocking their access."  Draw your own conclusions.   In :  urlLink POV , the innovative PBS documentary series.   Out : Don't kill the cgef, he's only trying his best.  urlLink Ananova  gives us scoop on  Johnny Depp :  " urlLink Hollywood Reporter  says (Johnny) Depp grabbed an old blade from a wall and joked he would kill the cook for making fantastic sticky toffee pudding.  "It quoted a member of staff as saying: 'Depp's always in our upstairs bar with different people having a laugh. He was drinking with  urlLink Samantha Morton ,  urlLink Johnny Vegas  and some off-duty staff.  "At about two in the morning they'd finished off two bottles of port and 14 bottles of wine between five of them.  "Then Johnny got this look in his eye and started yelling that he had to kill the chef for making such amazing sticky toffee pudding and custard. He had it for three days on the trot and says it's the most delicious thing he's ever eaten."  "Depp is currently in England for filming on The Libertine."  Looks like Johnny is the libertine.

       The Bob Woodward Nuclear Meltdown: T- Minus 6 Days    Shhhhhhhhhh . Listen. No, no, listen carefully, grasshopper. Can't you hear the sound of papers rustling in the Nation's capitol? Can you feel the intensity of the nervousness? That, dear reader, is the hullaballoo right before  urlLink Bob Woodward  makes his appearance on  urlLink 60 Minutes  next week and flips the fucking scrip.  The furor on the right is  urlLink massive . Only six more episodes remain  urlLink before Don Hewett goes back to Martha's Vinyard  and hands off the mothership to the Tiffany Network. And you can tell,  can't you ?  Hewett is going after the Bushies like nothing I've ever seen before. His "fuck you" attitude is written all over the last 5 broadcasts. Even  Howard Stern's  rants seem flaccid in comparison to the sharpness of 60 Minutes'  urlLink anti-Bush editorial stance .  urlLink Lefties, rejoice .  And so in DC  urlLink the Woodward game  is strong. Actually, the  urlLink anti-Bush publishing industry  is strong in general. And these developments come amid the whispers of " urlLink who leaked to Robert Novak "?  Novak, nicknamed  urlLink 'The Prince of Darkness'  for his overall demeanor and his column,  urlLink which traps  all the best  urlLink leaks on K-Street  like a spiderweb,   urlLink declined to speak of the matter  at Harvard.   But this week  urlLink the buzz will intensify  incrementally, as the  urlLink April 30 pub date approaches  and we hopefully find out just  WHO  leaked.

       Lynn Hirschberg to New York Magazine? We Can Only Hope ...    urlLink The inimitable Gawker  turns our attention to an interesting post on the  urlLink LA.com Blog . They write:  "Hollywood is openly wondering what  Adam Moss , the former features czar for  The New York Times  who left to edit  urlLink New York magazine , is going to do about entertainment coverage. Here's a scoop that hasn't been announced:  Anne Thompson  was let go as New York mag's Hollywood columnist back in January by Moss's predecessor,  Caroline Miller . (Previous to her, the mag's columnist, who also held the title of West Coast editor, was LA Weekly's  Nikki Finke ). So the mag is presently without a Hollywood writer, leaving a clear path for Moss to name his own--if he even decides to keep the column. True, Moss has been seen lunching with  urlLink The New York Times Magazine's  contract writer  urlLink Lynn Hirschberg  at  urlLink NYC's Michael's restaurant . But the two are close friends so it may have been purely social."  ( ed note : 4/11:  urlLink Anne Thompson is still on the masthead  at New York. Apologies)  Yeah, it could be purely social, but, then again, let's get the ball rolling and drum up some wild speculation.    urlLink Catherine Seipp in Salon did an excellent job summing up the flak  that led to Hirschberg's getting the bump from Vanity Fair back in the day(1998).  Seipp  wrote then:  "Briefly, here's the back story:   "1.  Lynn Hirschberg , who wrote regularly for  Vanity Fair  under  Tina Brown  but never enjoyed the same closeness with the magazine under  Graydon Carter , nevertheless was assigned to profile Seinfeld for the May issue."  (cue ominous music) Seipp continues:  "2. Although Hirschberg is  urlLink famous for turning celebrity profiles  into celebrity vivisections (as in the memorable ' urlLink The Fall of Jamie Tarses, As Scheduled ' in the  New York Times magazine  a few months ago) her portrait of Seinfeld was basically a Valentine --  urlLink atypical for Hirschberg , but typical for a  Vanity Fair cover . Not that there's anything wrong with that!"   Ummm , we won't get into my opinions about Vanity Fair covers, although you can read all about it  urlLink here  (3rd story).  "3. Vanity Fair now accuses Hirschberg of showing  Seinfeld  a copy of her manuscript before it was published -- which would be a major breach of journalistic ethics -- and has severed what was left of its relationship with her."   urlLink On April 2, 1998, NY Post reported : "But even hard-nosed Jonas couldn't shield Seinfeld from the tenacious Hirschberg, who, over the years, has eviscerated  Courtney Love ,  ABC's Jamie Tarses  and others.  "Love never forgave Hirschberg for writing that  urlLink the rocker used heroin  while pregnant with daughter  Frances Bean .  "At a post-Oscar party in 1995, Courtney picked up  Quentin Tarantino's  Academy Award and vowed, 'If Lynn Hirschberg were here, I'd kill her with this Oscar.'"   urlLink Seipp continues in Salon :  "4. Hirschberg says she did not show Seinfeld her manuscript."   and :  "5. Jonas faxed Vanity Fair what the magazine took as evidence that she did. "  But,  urlLink The NYPost reported at the time :  "Hollywood execs and journalists who've had to deal with the difficult Jonas - notorious for not returning phone calls - were doing cartwheels over the news that she'd gotten the ax.  "'I field calls from people all day long who just do nothing but complain about her,' one top-level television industry insider told ( ed note : then-) The Post's  urlLink Josef Adalian . 'People think she's an ineffective, destructive and mean-spirited excuse for a publicist.'  "Added another detractor at a major network: 'If you were to poll everyone here, they'd say she's a big bitch and a huge pain in the ass.'"  Finally:  "6. Hirschberg responded that this 'evidence' was merely papers she accidentally left in Seinfeld's car, not her story. "  "7. Jonas isn't Seinfeld's publicist anymore."  Since then, Hirschberg has labored in the New York Times wilderness, turning in  urlLink interesting copy .  urlLink Hard hitting copy that the media chattering classes mull over . Back in  urlLink 1998, Catherine Seipp wrote , " ...  a studio publicist said to me the other day, indulging in a little shudder just at the mention of Hirschberg's name. 'She's like  Mike Wallace  showing up at your door with a camera crew -- I mean, why even open it?'"  Why not open it, says  The Corsair . What's wrong with a  Mike Wallace  of the Hollywood entertainment complex? Forgive and forget, I say. Wouldn't  Lynn Hirschberg  be a  magnificent  Hollywood columnist for New York?

       A Little of the Old In and Out    Hollywood-DC-NY     In :  urlLink 60 minutes Corporate Tie-in Flak . I warned them, but did they listen?  Look : I love 60 Minutes, but  Matt Drudge  is right about the motives and  urlLink the shady corporate tie in . I grew up on their brand of Martha's Vinyard hard edged cultural elite investigative journalism. I loved it when  urlLink Ed Bradley went to Greece to get to the bottom of the November 17  terrorists. And  urlLink Christianne "the Goddess" Amanpour's interview of Chirac  on the Persian Gulf War was masterful. But no one -- no one -- can defend their  urlLink blatant attacks on the Bushies of late .   As Newsday's  Glenn Bower  reports:  "Many conservatives are suspicious because within four months, '60 Minutes' will feature three books that are either critical of Bush or are expected to raise tough questions about his leadership, said  Rich Noyes , research director of the Media Research Center.   "Besides the Clarke book and upcoming feature on Woodward's account of the administration's planning for the Iraq war, the newsmagazine in January interviewed former  urlLink Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill  about his criticisms of Bush in the book "The Price of Loyalty."   "Noyes also said  urlLink Stahl's interview with Clarke  didn't match the '60 Minutes' standard of toughness.   "'60 Minutes had made it a practice its whole life of telling corporate America to come clean and tell America what is going on,' Noyes said. 'They should be held to the same standards themselves.'"    Indeed.    Out :  urlLink John McCain as Kerry's Veep : it is not going to happen.  urlLink Sure, there was a high powered flirtation  across the halls of power.    urlLink Howard Kurtz  quotes McCain spokesman  Marshall Wittmann  as saying, "'It's not going to happen -- end of story, period, exclamation mark.'"    That's a wrap fellas , nothing else to see here, no more speculation, move along crisply.   In : Inexplicably ordinaty looking Hollywood superstar, hero of the working man  Drew Carey  gets greenlighted ...  again .  urlLink Alexis de Tocqueville  never would have anticipated this shit happening in such a brilliant democracy.

       Puffy's a Little l'Oeuf in his Oeuvres    P Diddy's   urlLink l'oeuf  make a very  urlLink Cocteauesque  appearance in his  urlLink oeuvre  recently, which, in due turn, landed him deep inside in the  Old Gray Lady  today. I know that sounds vaguely pornographic, vaguely French, so allow me to explain.  Check out this  urlLink strange chestnut from the New York Times , which starts in a  P Diddy  acting "session" for the Broadway play " urlLink A Raisin in the Sun ,' with one  Ms. Batson , Diddy's acting coach, that goes kind of, uhm, er,  haywire  and takes us to a very  dairy space . Let's start at the acting coaching:  "For about 15 minutes, Ms. Batson made practical suggestions ('Don't fear making it presentational') and mused about the text ('This is life. This is the dream. This is it'). And when she didn't like something, she was brutally honest ('You're just not getting the moment').   "Mr. Combs made a point: 'You have all these other teachers like  Strasberg ,' he said, turning toward Ms. Batson to check whether he had correctly pronounced the name of the illustrious acting teacher and co-founder of the  Group Theater . Ms. Batson, who studied with Strasberg at the  Actors Studio , nodded. 'But,' he continued, 'Susan has been able to simplify and make it more direct. Sometimes her help can be as crazy as  Dare to eat the eggs . "  "He was referring to an early scene in which  Walter Lee's  wife Ms. McDonald makes him scrambled eggs. In the first few previews, Mr. Combs left the eggs on his plate, but after that he started taking forkfullsls. 'People have come to see the play; real New York thespians and they're like, `Damn, he's really eating the eggs,'  Mr. Combs said.  `I can't believe it. He really can act.' "   "The next evening, Ms. Batson attended a performance with a class of her students a group of aspiring stars who jumped to attention when their leader said 'Listen up, troops!' During the show, Ms. Batson seemed to be in constant motion, shifting in her seat and writing notes furiously. But during the breakfast scene, she froze after Mr. Combs ate his scrambled eggs. He started choking, coughing so hard he practically brought the performance to a halt. Ms. McDonald, quick on her feet, brought him a glass of water and, after a few seconds, he recovered gracefully. Ms. Batson shook her head and giggled. "I can see the headline," she whispered.  `Coach Kills Combs.' "  "The eggs were still on her mind after the show, when she went backstage to give notes. Mr. Combs was visiting with  Demi Moore  and  Ashton Kutcher , so she waited in a room across the hall.  Kenny Leon , the director of 'Raisin,' joined her. After a long pause, he said, 'He's not going to eat those eggs.'"  Next time, can someone get Puffy a  urlLink chocolate swirl cheesecake from Juniors , please?  Thank you.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In : The  urlLink Friends  lawsuit, which, if I do say so myself,  aint Friendly . Sure, the entertainment industry at any one time has a half a dozen really juicy, succulent pieces of litigation circulating, but this is  so best . It's  special , like that  urlLink Diffrn't Strokes episode when the bicycle store owner molests Arnold Jackson's friend Dudley .  A very special lawsuit . With notes of snitching and casual sexism.  According to the  urlLink Smokinggun  (via  urlLink Gawker ) in the lawsuit's allegations, the writers of Friends come off as stupid, lewd, racially insensitive jugheads, just the sort of type that would envision New York the way they do every week --  not exactly in those words , of course. The defendant, one  Amaani Lyle , comes off, even worse than the jerky writers, she comes off as quite bitter. In entertainment, lawsuits are like handshakes. Some of the highlights:  "(complaint #) 25 . I had to constantly listen to comments of what kind of breasts and what kind of buttocks my supervisors were most attracted to.  "42. (Executive Producer)  urlLink Andrew Reich  would insult me because I previously worked at  Nickolodeon , but he would not insult the other writers' assistants.  " 50 . (NBC writer)  Greg Malins  talked about what he'd like to do sexually to different cast members on the show like  Courtney Cox  and  Jennifer Anniston .  " 59 . (Executive Producer)  urlLink Greg Malins  would take a copy of the Friends script cover and blacken out the letters to make it say penis.  "71. (Friends co executive producer)  urlLink Adam Chase  once called  Maura Kauffman  a cunt in a phone conversation with me on a weekend when I was home.  "78. Greg Malins liked to doodle and it usually was something disgusting."   Ooooh, I'm telling on you . I hope Ms. Lyle gets some sort of a payday out of this  elaborate snitchery , because she's going to find a hard time ever working in that town again.   Out :  urlLink Elvis Mitchell, leaving the Times . As Gawker reports:  "After we reported it on Wednesday, the rumor that film critic Elvis Mitchell is leaving the NY Times is already on its way to confirmation. Today, Variety steps up the rumor-mongering, confirming along the way that  A. O. Scott  will be named chief movie critic. Variety claims that Mitchell has 'irked' people at the paper, with his gallivanting about society with film directors and spending the last semester up at Harvard.  "[UPDATE: We hear Elvis actually has been asked to leave the building -- we hear his cubbyhole is all packed up and cleaned out.]"   Irked?  And  urlLink he looks so easy going  on those IFC interview thingies.   IN :  Alexandra Posen , at the CFDA 's Fashioning Fiction In Photography Since 1990, the other night, spinning to  urlLink Fashionweekdaily  on behalf of Alexander:  "I think it's a great junction. People keep saying it's this awkward union, but it's a great junction of two fashion superstars. Zac's been seeking a collaboration [backer] from the beginning. Without [ urlLink P. Diddy's ] support, we're essentially monetarily on our own?he definitely is paving the way for us to produce big things, which we have planned, for September.'  Or, as  urlLink British Vogue says : "Combs noticed Posen's talent early in his career and made his respect for him public while DJ-ing in a New York nightclub after the CFDA awards last June. 'You ain't got shit if you ain't got  Zac Posen  in your closet,' he said over the loudspeaker."  Oh Puffy,  shut up .   Out :  urlLink Paula Yates  broke  urlLink Bob Geldoff  when she dumped him for future autoerotic asphyxiation poster boy  Michael "Devil Inside" Hutchence , according to  urlLink Ananova , via the  urlLink Daily Mirror :  " Bob Geldof  lay on the floor of his home for two days after his wife  Paula Yates  left him for Michael Hutchence.  "He speaks about the ordeal in a  BBC1  programme on Saturday night about the  Live Aid  hero.  "Geldof, 52, says he was 'helpless' as Ms Yates destroyed herself with drink and drugs.  "However, he doesn't attack the mother of his three children -  Peaches ,  Pixie  and  Fifi Trixibelle , says the  Daily Mirror.   "He says: 'I don't think I would dis her. She was great.'  "Geldof also says he couldn't understand why she left him for the INXS singer. 'I couldn't stand being without my family. Home had gone. Home was them.'  "His friend  Marsha Hunt  said he'd was completely broken by the experience. 'He was on the floor in a foetal position in the living-room and he basically stayed there for the next two days.'"  I've been there over a woman, so I won't even get snarky about that whole naming your kids  Peaches  and  Fifi Trixibelle  shit. That kind of fuckery is for his analyst to delve into. Draw your own conclusions on that.   In :  urlLink Mary J. Blige , She shares a lot in common with Jane t Jackson . Liberated nipples, for one thing.  urlLink Aside from her 60 Minutes flap  and the FCC getting involved, British Vogue writes:  "AFTER noticing that her nipple was free for all to see during a recent stage performance,  Mary J Blige  decided that she had to give her wardrobe some attention. 'I need clothes,' she told  Women's Wear Daily . 'Not the handkerchiefs they're selling now. It's got to be loose fitting stuff. The jeans have to have stretch and they have to make me happy.' While  Dolce & Gabbana  dressed Blige for her 2002 tour, the singer admits that the clothes weren't perfect because she didn't have enough time for all the fittings. 'A lot of the stuff wound up being too low-cut,' she went on. 'And low-cut jeans don't work for me. My behind is low and high at the same time, and I refuse to have my behind showing.'"   (uncomfortable silence) Does anyone out there know how a behind can be high and low at the same time?    Out :  urlLink Kim Delaney .  urlLink TV Guide asks : Is  Kim Delaney  acting a bit ... odd, of late? On a recent interview via conference call with TV Guide reporter  Daneil R. Coleridge :  " Kim Delaney  hasn't had the easiest life in recent years.  urlLink She was arrested for DUI in 2002 ; her show  urlLink Philly was axed ; she was  urlLink let go from CSI: Miami ; and, last year,  urlLink she checked into an Arizona rehab facility  to treat an alcohol addiction. This week, the actress raised eyebrows once again ...  "On Wednesday, Delaney and  Beau Bridges  did a telephone conference call with reporters to plug  urlLink NBC's four-hour miniseries 10.5 , about a deadly earthquake hitting the West Coast. (It airs May 2 and 3 at 9 pm/ET.) Between answering questions, the actress punctuated the pauses with anxious remarks — seemingly unaware (or unconcerned) that reporters could hear everything she said. 'Beau, how weird is this?' she was heard to complain. 'Beau, are you going crazy? I gotta call you after this. I'm dying!'  "Bridges and the Peacock publicist in charge of the call had to reassure Delaney she was 'doing fine.' She kept insisting Bridges phone her after the conference to talk about it, as if something unusual were going on, other than her own surreal commentary. Frankly, this seemed odd behavior coming from an actress who's been doing press to promote her projects for years.  "The 42-year-old Emmy winner, who plays a seismologist in the disaster drama, did grudgingly answer some queries. When asked if she'd do more NYPD Blue, she told TV Guide Online: 'Always. If Steven [Bochco] calls me. He's been a great friend. If he calls, I show up.'  "We also inquired about the status of  urlLink Sudbury , her CBS pilot about two sisters who happen to be witches. 'I have no idea where it's going,' she said. 'It's a very nice cast. You got Dixie Carter, Shirley Knight, myself and Jeri Ryan. We finished [shooting] it. It was great.' She also added, 'I'm a good witch. It's not like black magic.'"  What the fuck? I got 50-50 odds on  Delaney  going crazy in 2004, 60-40 on  Sadie Frost , and 75-25 on  Brittney Murphy  with those big spooky peepers.    In :  urlLink Greek Cypriots defeat Unification Vote . In a massive blow to peace and stability in the region and a stubborn clinging to old, outmoded and  jejune  tribal notions (gee where does  the Corsair  side on this issue),  Alex Efty  of  urlLink the AP writes :  "The European Commission said it 'deeply regrets that the Greek Cypriot community' rejected the plan.   "'A unique opportunity to bring about a solution to the long-lasting Cyprus issue has been missed,' the commission said in a statement in Brussels.   "The commission, the EU's administration, said it wanted to 'warmly congratulate Turkish Cypriots for their 'yes" vote ( ed note : in the separate referendum).' It added it would look at ways to promote their development.   "Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots voted in separate referendums on whether to accept a plan by  urlLink U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan  that would reunify Cyprus after 30 years of division. The United States and other countries have pushed hard for acceptance of the plan ahead of Cyprus' May 1 entry to the European Union."  Why is this in and not out?  Good news : Another defeat of the useless fuzzy-wuzzy  Kofi Annan . Let's put  urlLink George Bush,.Sr  in this position.  Yes, I can hear the outrage, but listen, politically, do you think Southerners will stand for a liberal Secretary General, like  Clinton  or  Carter ; never; and do you think an unsophisticated little autocrat like  Giuliani  would ever pass muster with the left of the Foreign Relations Committee? Bush is supremely qualified, he is not too right wing, and is just moderate enough. The perfect compromise, if we can get past the freaky Bush-Dynasty -illuminati crowd and push this through.

       Andre Leon Talley Gets Rave Reviews From ... Style.com   Some hyperbole from  urlLink Style.com :  "'It was like  Maria Callas  at the Metropolitan!' said  urlLink Oscar de la Renta , employing a little good-natured hyperbole to describe  Vogue Editor at Large   André Leon Talley's  international stage debut, last week with the  Martha Graham Dance Company  at City Center in New York. 'All the celebrities and friends were there for him,' de la Renta continued. Indeed,  Vera Wang ,  Ralph and Ricky Lauren ,  Zac Posen ,  Anne Bass ,  Nan Kempner ,  Mikhail Baryshnikov , and the evening’s chairwoman,  Kimora Lee Simmons , all poured into the sold-out Midtown theater to witness Talley's dramatic narration of  urlLink Edward Lear's poem The Owl and the Pussycat , a role Graham originally created in 1978 for  Liza Minnelli ."  And I wrote this back on December 3rd, but a lot of the new readers never saw it, so:  "Which high powered  Conde Nast  editor wrote this?   "I earned my Masters degree in French literature in the Spring of 1972. My topic was the pivotal role played by all the fabulous, exotic North African women in the world of poet  Charles Baudelaire  and painter  Eugene Delacroix . My thesis was based on the whole sense of importance of Africa to the conception of Orientalism as it influenced art and literature in Nineteenth Century France, a topic in which I have a keen interest. Delacroix's  Les Femmes d'Algiers  featured prominently, as did Flaubert's Salambo. I truly loved writing my Master's thesis, and although I still yearned for the world of fashion, I moved on to pursuing my doctorate without hesistation."  Can you guess who wrote this?  One more clue:  "You see (Diana)  Vreeland  loved black culture. She loved the Saturday Morning Dance Show  Soul Train ; my grandmother cared nothing for it ... she went hog wild over every manifestation of black style. It all began, I think, with  Josephine Baker , who truly was one of the most stylish women to ever walk this planet. Mrs. Vreeland loved to tell the story of watching a movie one night in the balcony of a Paris cinema back in the 30s. She had her elbows on the armrests and was intently watching this film, when all of a sudden, one of the armrests moved. She turned to see what was going on and found out that she had been resting her elbow not on the arm of a seat, but on the head of Josephine Baker's pet cheetah, and that both the magnificent cat and its magnificent owner were now getting up to leave. Mrs. Vreeland watched speechlessly as the cheetah padded in a stately fashion up the aisle of the theater, Josephine Baker walking regally behind, wearing a daring, bias-cut Vionnet dress with no underwear on underneath."  If you guessed that this is the wonderful  Andre Leon Talley's   urlLink ALT , then give yourself a pat on the back. Basta!

       NY Times Sunday: Bushies Worried About Climate Change Film and, Will Frist Close Down Senate?   Where's the love  Rupert Murdoch ?  Although Earth Day was celebrated officially two days ago, and  urlLink the Administration was caught flat-footed  to  Kerry's  bad-on-the-environment charge (which is a space  Karl Rove  doesn't like to be at), and the Bushies have been working  overtime  to  urlLink project a teflon image over the environment.  So it comes as no surpise that  urlLink Drudge is reporting  that the Administration is not happy about Fox's new $125 million enviro-disaster film.  It isn't personal, guys, it's business.  Drudge writes:  "Fed agencies employees (will) not to comment publicly on FOX's new summer fuss-film  urlLink THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW , a $125 million disaster movie on 'global warming.'  "The flick, which depicts how accumulating smokestack and tailpipe gases sets off an instant ice age, is set to open on May 28.  "Few climate experts think such a prospect is likely, the  NEW YORK TIMES  is planning to report on Sunday, newsroom sources tell the  DRUDGE REPORT , but the prospect that moviegoers will be alarmed enough to blame the Bush administration for inattention to climate change has stirred alarm at the space agency.  "'No one from NASA is to do interviews or otherwise comment on anything having to do with' the film, said an April 1 message to employees."  As if the Bushies are going to get the environmental vote. Not bloody likely, but they do have to trim off the hunters and fishermen and some outdoorsy folks in vital rural states, like Oregon, New Mexico and New Hampshire, where the environment is a point of pride  Actually, though, there is a serious story about  urlLink conservative hunters and fishermen turning against the corporate centric environmental policy . Remember when we could eat  urlLink Tuna  and  urlLink Swordfish ?  Sigh  ...   urlLink Oliver Beekman in the Guardian wrote  presciently, over a year ago, in March 2003:  "The US Republican party is changing tactics on the environment, avoiding 'frightening' phrases such as global warming, after a confidential party memo warned that it is the domestic issue on which  George Bush  is most vulnerable.   "The memo, by the leading Republican consultant  urlLink Frank Luntz , concedes the party has "lost the environmental communications battle" and urges its politicians to encourage the public in the view that there is no scientific consensus on the dangers of greenhouse gases.   "'The scientific debate is closing [against us] but not yet closed. There is still a window of opportunity to challenge the science,' Mr Luntz writes in the memo, obtained by the  Environmental Working Group , a Washington-based campaigning organisation.   "Voters believe that there is no consensus about global warming within the scientific community. Should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled, their views about global warming will change accordingly.   "Therefore, you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate.   "The phrase 'global warming' should be abandoned in favour of 'climate change,' Mr Luntz says, and the party should describe its policies as 'conservationist' instead of 'environmentalist,' because 'most people' think environmentalists are 'extremists' who indulge in 'some pretty bizarre behaviour... that turns off many voters.'   "Words such as 'common sense' should be used, with pro-business arguments avoided wherever possible.   "The environment, the memo says, 'is probably the single issue on which Republicans in general - and President Bush in particular - are most vulnerable.'   "A Republican source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said party strategists agreed with Mr Luntz's conclusion that 'many Americans believe Republicans do not care about the environment.'   "The popular image is that they are 'in the pockets of corporate fat cats who rub their hands together and chuckle manically [sic] as they plot to pollute America for fun and profit', Mr Luntz adds.   Read the UK Guardian article in full  urlLink here .  Read  Jennifer 8. Lee's   NY Times  article a year ago on the memo  urlLink here .  And, if you are interested,  urlLink my interview with Dr. Richard A. Muller, a wonderful guy who just happens to be an expert on Ice Ages  and global change over milennia.  And, in other news,  urlLink Robert Novack today reports :  " urlLink Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist  is being urged by colleagues to threaten to close down the Senate for the rest of the year unless  urlLink Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle  ends his disruptive tactics.  "In addition to menacing all judicial nominations, Daschle is now preventing legislation from being sent to Senate-House conferences to resolve differences in bills passed by both Houses unless the outcome is guaranteed.   " Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona , chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, and other conservatives want  urlLink Frist to counter Daschle  by bringing the business of the Senate to a halt. This would mean passing an omnibus appropriations bill and then awaiting the outcome of the elections. Democrats could not offer their pet amendments, but it also would prevent passage of a budget resolution and, therefore, kill any chance of making the Bush tax cuts permanent."  As the  urlLink NY Times reports today , the partisanship and divisions within the nation are strongly echoed in the halls of congress where, decimatingSenate tradition,  urlLink Frist will openly campaign in South Dakota against his counterpart, Daschle, in his back yard .   That's cold.

       Smackdown: Dick Morris vs Bill Clinton   reprinted from February 11th:  From  Behind the Oval Office , by  Dick Morris  p. 64-5:  "At about midnight, (then Governor Bill) Clinton  joined Hillary,  Gloria Cabe , his campaign manager, and me in a cozy breakfst room off the kitchen. My polling (for a 1990 gubernatorial reelection fight) showed that  McRae  offensive (Bill's ooponent) had dropped Clinton's share vote to a meage 43 percent. Generally, when an incumbent's share of the polls dropped below 50 percent in the polls, it means he is likely to lose ... Clinton's temper got the better of him. Exhausted, worried, and angry, he exploded. 'You got me into this race,' he screamed, 'so you could make some extra money off me. That was the only reason. And now you give me no attention, no attention at all. I'm about to lose this election, this primary, against a nobody' ... Clinton has a terrible temper ... In pain and facing that harsh criticism, I lost my temper too. If he was too hasty in his criticism, I was too sharp in my reply. Storming out of the breakfast room  through the kitchen toward the door outside, I rallied, 'Thank you, thank you, thank you. You've just solved my problem. I'm getting shit from Atwater and shit from Lott for working for you, and now I can solve my problem. Go fuck yourself. I'm quitting your goddamn campaign, and now I am a free agent. I can be a fifty state Republican and don't have to take your shit.'  "Clinton charged up behind me as I stalked towards the door, grabbed me from behind, and wrapped his arms around me to stop me from leaving. I slipped to the floor. Hillary helped me to my feet. The moment I stood up Clinton became apologetic. 'Don't go, don't go I'm sorry. Don't go, I;m sorry,' he said as I walked out the door, slamming it behind me.. Hillary ran after me to calm me down. She put her arms around my shoulders and walked me around the grounds of the mansion. "Please forgive him," she pleaded. 'He's under so much pressure. He didn't mean it. He's very sorry. He's overtired, he hasn't slept well in days. He's not himself. He values you. He needs you,' she repeated.  "I calmed down enough to drive to my hotel, and I called Eileen (his wife) shaking in rage. Later Hillary called to tell me how much Bill wanted me back. Then he came on line to apologize ... I couldn't leave Clinton three weeks before his primary, but from then on I dealt with him in a formal, almost frosty way. I stopped calling him Bill, always adressed him as Governor, and left when our meetings were over rather than hang around and chat."

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  urlLink Gerardo . "I'm used to good old fashioned homestyle Spanish cooking/ If I try that I'll be puking." Just so you know, we like  Rico Suave , o snarky editors at  urlLink Blender Magazine  (shakes fist impotently at computer screen)   Out : This  urlLink Gene Simmons  quote in the May 2004  Details Magazine  profoundly disturbs me. "If I ever go to jail, I want  urlLink Lenny (Kravitz)  there with me. He's pretty. He'd be very popular in jail." (shivers)   In :  urlLink Lindsayism . Our favorite Comedy Central employee posts emails she solicited regarding sex related "high ideas,"or ideas that come to one when one is in an altered, somewhat  pharmaceutical  state. Here's one:  " ... It'd be cool if there was a pill you could take before sex that would allow you to read your partner's thoughts. Of course, it would ruin the mood when you realize that I'm doing a mental panel-by-panel reconstruction of the Spider-Man series,  urlLink 'Return of The Sinister Six .' And by the way, after while we're cuddling and you're plotting out the trajectory of our hypothetical romance (2.5 kids, vacations at  urlLink the Cape , Christmas with your parents, his & hers matching gravestones), I'm working on the follow-up, 'Revenge of the Sinister Six.'"   Out : As previously mentioned, or at least hinted at,  urlLink Blender Magazine  has listed the 50 Worst Songs Ever. Rocking in at number one is Jefferson Starship's "We Built This City on Rock and Roll."    In : Chesty UK model  urlLink Jordan , famous for being famous, has excepts from her new bio Being Jordan in  urlLink OK! Magazine , reports  urlLink Ananova . Here's a sample:  "Jordan said: 'I didn't feel starstruck by  Victoria  but I must admit to feeling a bit of a thrill around David. He is so good-looking, has such a fit body and is so nice with it.  "One night in July, after  Dane  and  Victoria  had performed their single at  Party in the Park , the four of us went clubbing to  Twice as Nice  so Victoria could look credible on the R 'n' B scene.  " urlLink Dane  was DJing and I was standing with the famous couple. Suddenly I felt someone take my hand and squeeze it gently as it to reassure me that I shouldn't be overawed by all the hype.  "It was David. I looked at him in surprise and he was looking right back at me. Imagine how you would feel if  David Beckham  held your hand!  "Victoria was standing right next to him, so I thought I'd better keep my mouth shut. She is so incredibly possessive that if women so much as say they fancy David she goes mad.  "I would have given anything for her to disappear at that moment and leave me alone with one of the world's sexiest men.  "But I guess I'll never really know what David was thinking. Maybe he was showing that he understood what it was like to be caught up in Dane and Victoria's desperate bid to get to number one ..."   Out :  urlLink Jude Law's ex Sadie Frost . The woman is frosty. Has anyone ever seen a picture of  urlLink this woman  smiling? Apparently, she was recently observed banging on  Jude Law's  door demanding to speak to him, according to  urlLink The Mirror :  " ... We hear it was the mother of all bust-ups between the former darlings of the Britpack scene.  "Apparently, Sadie - who lives just round the corner - turned up very late at night with her current squeeze,  Jackson Scott , in tow.  "The 37-year-old mother-of-four started banging on the door demanding Jude let her in, saying there were, 'Things she needed to discuss with him.'  "But 31-year-old Jude was having none of it. The furious Cold Mountain star refused to let his ex-missus in because she was in such a 'state,' which made Sadie even more angry."   Damn  ... we can relate to Jude all of a sudden. Don't you feel human compassion for this man? Having his shit all out in public like this. Evil bloggers like me all up in his business. Scandalous.  "Our spy reveals: 'It was one of the ugliest arguments they've had for ages.  "'Sadie feels very embarrassed by the whole thing, but as far as she is concerned it wouldn't have ever happened if Jude had let her in.  "'She was screaming and shouting at him and even Jackson was chipping in.'"  Damn.  Even Jackson  had to speak his mind:  "Sadie hates the fact that she was washing her dirty laundry in public. She was well aware of the curtains twitching - at one point she even thought someone had started taking pictures of the confrontation. If they do exist she's desperate for them not to come out."  Hey, Sadie, if you hate it so much, pop a prozac and stop doing what you're doing. There. I said out loud what we all were thinking.   In :  Jennifer Garner . We predicted the ascent of the anti-Christ about a month ago. Should 13 Going on 30 hit number one at the box office this weekend, then the rise to power will be complete: Jennifer Garner will overtake Julia Roberts as the Hollywood "It" Girl. And that significant cultural artifact  urlLink The Star Magazine  has a nifty little item regarding that:  "With the buzz surrounding the release of her new romantic comedy  urlLink 13 Going On 30 ,  urlLink Jennifer Garner , 32, is Tinseltown's new 'It' girl. Her hilarious turn as a young teen who wakes up to find herself in her 30s has Hollywood calling her the next  Julia Roberts . But sources say one person doesn't appreciate the comparison: Julia herself.  "'When reviews started coming in for Jennifer's movie, people were saying she was the new Pretty Woman, and Julia wasn't happy about it,' says a source close to Roberts."   The Corsair  whispers, " ... catfight ... catfight ..."  " ... Garner's career is hot. Not only is she filming more Alias episodes, but she's gearing up for her star turn in Elektra, the spin-off of the successful Daredevil movie, which grossed over $100 million. Her other films, Catch Me If You Can and Pearl Harbor, fared equally well.  "Julia's recent roles haven't been noteworthy. Reports indicate that  Mona Lisa Smile  made only $63 million in the US (though Roberts took home $25 million for her salary). Her other recent films, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind and Full Frontal barely made a blip on the radar.  "Days before  Mona Lisa Smile  was released, Roberts told a crowd of journalists, 'Because I've had lots of great career opportunities and I've built on them over a long period of time, the kind of attention I give to my career can be very sporadic. And of my choosing.'"  Love  Jennifer Garner  or hate her (and  The Corsair  loves her dimpled sweetness), she is hungry for the heights of fame. I have never seen a celebrity stake out the top spot like she did, prowling around it, staring at the perch with haunted eyes,  urlLink the CIA site , the  urlLink courting of the geeks  at the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Science Scientific and Technical Awards, Alias, Electra, now  urlLink this . Damn, she's hungrier than  Tom Cruise  on his way up.   Out :  Senator Arlen Spector . Everyone hates this fucker.  urlLink Conservatives, because he is mild . God, how  urlLink conservatives hate Spector , it is an  urlLink awesome sight . Liberals hate him because  urlLink he is one mean motherfucker, screaming at his twentysomething aides.  According to  urlLink the Hill's Peter Savodnik and Geoff Earle :  "Conservative activists backing  urlLink Rep. Pat Toomey’s Senate bid  are voicing doubts that the congressman has enough money or shock troops to counter the statewide, multimedia campaign being waged by Sen. Arlen Specter in Pennsylvania’s Republican primary.  "While a recent Quinnipiac University poll put Toomey within five points of Specter — marking a significant tightening of the race — the activists said the conservative House member from Allentown needs to do a better job mobilizing his base."  So, Specter wins, but in the end, he loses.

       David Gave the Seed   In the May 2004  urlLink Interview Magazine ,  urlLink JT Leroy  comes to the window of  urlLink Melissa Etheridge .    JT Leroy : Do your kids know that  urlLink David Crosby  is their biological father?   Melissa Etheridge : Yeah, they do. He's never been any kind of parent to my kids -- they see him maybe once or twice a year. But they know that it was David who gave the seed that allowed them to be born; that is all. It was a gift from him and his wife.  Hmmm. And what a meaningful gift. Bummer, though, to be a 5 year old and a 7 year old finding out that that  urlLink David Crosby gave the seed  that allowed you to be born.   Imagine how "the talk" played itself out:    Melissa : Kids, do you know that your biological father was a famous musician?   urlLink Bailey : Is it  Sting , Mama, he's so socially conscious.   Beckett : Is it  Billy Joel , Mama, he's such a dreamer.   Melissa : Uh, no ... it's ...   Beckett : Is it  Mick Jagger , Mama? he's like a force of nature.   Bailey : Is it  Elton John , Mama? He's so romantic.   Melissa : Uhm, did I say famous? I meant,  sorta  famous.  (uncomfortable silence)   Bailey : Well,  Jackson Brown  would be okay, I suppose. Is it him Mama?   Beckett :  Phil Collins  wouldn't be too much of a let down. Say it's him, Mama; you're scaring us.   Melissa : (fake smile) no, kids,  urlLink David Crosby !  (uncomfortable silence)   Bailey : Mama's making a funny.   Beckett : Oh, ha-ha-ha, Mama, ha-ha, you're so funny.  Melissa: No, kids, (seriously) David gave the seed that allowed you to be born.  (kids turn to one another)   Together :  EEeeeeewwwww

       Lauren Bush: The UN Feeds You Well    Morgan Goldberg  interviews the hot 19 year old Presidential neice   urlLink Lauren Bush  today for  urlLink Fashionweekdaily , and comes up with this little chestnut:  " Goldberg : What did you eat today?  " Bush : I had an egg whites scrambled with cheese for breakfast. And for lunch I ate the buffet here at the  UN : greens, shrimp salad, grilled vegetables, a roll and dessert. The chocolate cake was amazing. The  UN  feeds you well."  Of course, one would not expect a mannequin like  urlLink Lauren  to be up on geopolitical affairs, but, in fact, quite ironically, the UN does not feed anyone  urlLink well .  Seriously, people, we need to get rid of  Kofi Annan  as Secreatary General, and appoint a former US President in his place.

       Vice President Powell?   Call it a hunch, but when  Richard Johnson  of the  New York Post's Page Six  gets a Republican insider to speak on the Administration, one gets the impression, however veiled, that he or she is  someone of note  saying something  noteworthy . That's why when, at the end of their lead story,  urlLink Colin Stands Tall With Dubya  , there was an intimation of something quite mindblowing, our scoop detectors were up:  "The insider also denied the rumor that  Powell  would be replaced before the fall election. 'Why would the administration get rid of Powell? He is the only person there who has an 80 percent approval rating, and only person giving [Bush] good advice.   "'Right now,  Dick Cheney  and  Donald Rumsfeld  are being blamed for the mess we are in in Iraq, but swing voters love Colin Powell.'   "There is even talk of Powell replacing Cheney as vice president. Not that  urlLink Cheney, who has a bad heart, would go easily . Cheney, determined to keep fit, even brought an exercycle on his recent trip to Asia.   "'It was this ancient thing, like from the '60s, and he had people lugging it on and off planes wherever he went. It was hilarious.'"   How interesting . The insider, whom I believe is a player in the Administration, is ridiculing  Dick Cheney's  attempts at projecting manly vitality. Clearly, although Bush has made gains in recent tracking polls,  urlLink 57 percent believe that the country is "on the wrong track ," which is, in no small part, thanks to Cheney. Cheney is increasingly regarded as a liability. And the politically sagacious  Dick Morris  actually has a  negative  take in  urlLink his latest column out today in the Post :  "Both of the polling organizations that track the presidential race in daily surveys have concluded that the contest has settled into a stalemate.  urlLink Scott Rasmussen  reports that for eight of the last nine days,  President Bush  has gotten 45 to 46 percent of the vote, while  Sen. John Kerry  ranged from 44 to 46 percent.  urlLink John Zogby  shows Kerry ahead by three and reports little movement either way.   "This 'tie' is terrible news for the Bush camp."  Kerry went out of his way this past Sunday not only to refer to  Woodward's  book, but to quote Colin Powell, making him an issue in the campaign. The conservative  urlLink Wall Street Journal  goes so far as to say that Powell could ostensibly help Kerry in the election. And so, what better way to neutralize Powell as an issue than to coopt him, to make him a part of the ticket.  Of course, it doesn't hurt that Powell has helped defang the  urlLink devastating 60 Minutes portrait  by allying himself squarely with the Bushies, as  urlLink The Washington Post's Dan Morgan writes :  " Secretary of State Colin L. Powell , responding to a new book about the Bush administration's decision to go to war in Iraq, said yesterday he was closely involved with planning for the attack and had been as 'committed as anyone else' to toppling the government of  Saddam Hussein .   "The book,  urlLink 'Plan of Attack' by Bob Woodward , describes Powell as an opponent of the war strategy pushed by Vice President Cheney, and recounts that the Saudi ambassador,  Prince Bandar bin Sultan , learned of the decision to go to war before Powell. But Powell said he was committed from the start to President Bush's war plan if diplomacy failed and that he was well informed about Bush's strategy.   "'My support was willing and it was complete, no matter how others might try to impose their policy wishes on my body,' Powell said in an interview with the Associated Press."   There are no African Americans in the United States Senate, despite the fact that the Democratic Party continues to garner upwards of 90 percent of the black vote (an astonishing 95 percent in the 2000 election). So far as I know, there is only  urlLink one low priority Democrat running for the Senate in Illinois . There are no ther plans to recruit another. The Democratic Party ( allegedly  pro African American) has  never  nominated an African American on the Presidential ticket.  And, of course, Colin Powell has approval ratings above 80 percent. A Powell Vice Presidency could  put the African American vote into play  for Republicans in a way never before witnessed. And that would be very, very bad for the Democratic Party. Then again, the Democrats have taken the African American vote for granted for so many years.  I have labored under the opinion that  Dick Cheney  will pull out due to "health problems" in early spring, or as the  urlLink CIA leak - Valerie Plame hearings  get thick -- whichever comes first -- and that the Republican Party will unveil  urlLink Sir Rudy Giuliani  as Dubya's running mate at the New York Convention, maximizing momentum, the big Mo. Bush already has Wyoming and the defense hawk oil magnate vote locked, Dick Cheney is  essentially unuseful  to the reelection, except, perhaps as an advisor. But Powell is far more formidable with swing voters, while Dubya cements the true believers.  We live in interesting times.  ( ed note : because of work i won't be posting tommorrow, but I'll be back on Thursday)

       Doonesbury's DB Will Lose Leg in Iraq    urlLink The AP reports :  "A main character in the  urlLink Doonesbury comic strip  will lose a leg while fighting in Iraq, one of two strips published this week that feature soldiers getting injured in the war.   "In Monday's  urlLink Doonesbury, B.D.,  a football coach-turned-soldier, was injured after being reactivated in the Army at the end of 2002, following a losing football season.   "Later this week, he will wake up to find his left leg amputated, according to Universal Press Syndicate, the strip's distributor.   "Doonesbury creator  urlLink Garry Trudeau  said he wanted to illustrate the sacrifices American soldiers are making.   "'It's a task any writer should approach with great humility, but I think it's worth doing,' Trudeau said. 'We are at war, and we can't lose sight of the hardships war inflicts on individual lives."   "Trudeau said B.D. would learn to deal with his injury 'probably the same way so many wounded vets seem to - with gratitude for having had one's life spared, empathy and respect for those who have suffered worse, and a grim sense of humor indispensable to fending off despair.'"

       Jesus Juice, Naked Mannequins, The Simpsons and Jacko    urlLink ABC News is reporting  that they have seen Santa Barbara reports that outline the allegations the alleged victim and his brother made to a psychologist:  "The psychologist, Stan Katz, interviewed the alleged victim and his younger brother at the request of the family's lawyer. According to the report, the boy's brother told Katz that not only did Jackson serve the boys alcohol, but on at least two occasions, Jackson's alleged victim passed out, ABCNEWS has learned.   "The report says the alleged victim's younger brother told Katz he saw Jackson touch his brother — a 12-year-old cancer patient — inappropriately when he was passed out.   "Jackson was charged in December with seven counts of committing lewd or lascivious acts upon a child and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent to the child.   "The police report states that when the psychologist asked the alleged victim if Jackson engaged in sexual activity in front of him, the alleged victim started crying and wouldn't answer. The boy's younger brother was the only one who described the alleged touching.   "'Because the alleged victim's younger brother was only 9 years old at the time, his age could pose a problem for the prosecution.'"  The story on  urlLink ABC News continues :  "Katz also told Santa Barbara police that the boys told him, 'Jackson once stood in front of them naked for a moment, as they were watching TV.'   "According to the report, the alleged victim also told Katz that Jackson gave him a laptop computer and surfed the Internet with him for pictures of naked women. And, according to the boy, Jackson said if anyone should ask what they were doing he should say they were watching  The Simpsons .   "The younger brother also alleges that Jackson played with a mannequin of an 8- or 9-year-old girl in a sexually suggestive manner in front of the boys."

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  Pink  is having a strapping good time in the Old World suing  Austria's OVP Conservative Party , I shit you not. According to  urlLink Tampa radio station 93.3's website :  "Bosses at Pink's record label are suing  urlLink Austria's conservative party OVP  for using the pop punk's name to boost support.  "The political organization infuriated  BMG  chiefs when they printed the 'Just Like a Pill' star's name on flyers promoting candidate  urlLink Benita Ferrero-Waldner's  election campaign, following her sold-out show in Vienna on April 4.  "According to her label the party broke 'more than one right of the artist. It was a misuse of an artist's name for a political campaign without the written consent of the artist.'  "It's not even clear if the artist approves or even shares the political view of that party."  Don't  urlLink get the Party started!    Out : Ultraskanky Girls Gone Wild founder  Joseph Francis  is  urlLink suing the woman who accused him of rape last month for $25 million, as TheSmokinggun reports . Adding insult to skankery, he is even suing  urlLink the accuser  to get back money for the post coital repast he bought her:  "Claiming that he would not 'sit back and be called a rapist,' Francis filed the below Florida Circuit Court lawsuit against the 21-year-woman and a friend who accompanied her to Francis's Ritz Carlton suite after a night of South Beach partying. Francis, 31, contends that he engaged in consensual sex with the woman--identified as  Amy Doe  in  urlLink his complaint  -- and even had lunch with the alleged victim and her pal the following day. Along with the $25 million, Francis is also seeking to be reimbursed the $36 he shelled out for the medium rare burgers the women ordered from room service."  And, (altogether now)  a skankety skank skank!    In :  urlLink Heeb Magazine . A very clever "downtown" magazine for people who love Jews. "a Jewish social-entrepreneurship venture fund ( Steve Spielberg  and  Charles Bronfman ) support happily gave Heeb $60,000 to get started," writes  Jesse Oxfeld  of Medibistro. urlLink Medibistro interviewed their new editor Josh Neuman :  " Mediabistro: Your background is not as a business guy. You have a master's from the Harvard Divinity School.    " Josh : I think it's impacted my experience. I think there is a line to be drawn. I'm aware this is commerce. I've always loved magazines, but I never mistook my magazine for Hegel or Kierkegaard or Marcus Aurelius. What interests me about magazines is the intersection of ideas and commerce, the way our magazine performs something subversive in the marketplace. Watching people experience Heeb at the newsstand, it's this triangular experience. They look at the image, then they look at the word Heeb, and then there's just this private moment. And that private moment is precious because it's not an, 'Oooh, that's cool,' and it's not an, 'Ugh, that's awful.' It's something like, 'What the hell is that? Could this really be here, could this be happening?' So that's really of interest to me.  "It's not my background. I thought I was going to be a philosophy professor, and I taught for five years at NYU. But marketing is very philosophical to me."   Whatever . I'm a real fan of this this magazine. Especially the pictures of full-figured bohemian Jewish women. Where else can I get my Semitic princess fetish on? I'm old school like that.   Out :  urlLink Tom Brokaw .

Do you remember  Communique  Magazine from the beloved defunct series  urlLink Central Park West ? If you do, you'll love the fake magazine titles  urlLink at Lowculture today .  And,  Out : Well, out May 5th at the  urlLink Tribeca Film Festival  (yes, guys, it's that time of year again; we heart  urlLink Jane Rosenthal ) is the documentary  Point and Shoot .  urlLink Fashionweekdaily writes :  "'Point and Shoot',  Shawn Reguto’s  reality-based film about the fashion industry, isn’t your typical high-gloss fashion movie à la  urlLink Pret à Porter . Premiering May 5th at the Tribeca Film Festival, the film is a gritty, behind-the-scenes exposé on fashion scenesters, warts and all (models have warts?).   "For his first feature-length film, Reguto, 29, took real-life footage he shot over the past two years and edited it into a 90-minute narrative that follows him, his girlfriend  Athena , and their crew of hipster friends clubbing, partying and sometimes even working. The Tribeca native began compiling footage in 2002 when he met Athena, a model for  Yves Saint Laurent  and  Levis . The film follows their relationship and the challenges that face them as a couple living in this unstructured atmosphere ( ed note to self : buy digital camera, attend fashion show, and hit on gorgeous models by telling them you want to make an  'independent film'  about them). 'She loved me filming her,' Reguto said. 'It was a part of our relationship. A lot of photographers have a muse girlfriend and she’s my muse.' But when asked about the current state of their relationship, Reguto was vague ( ed note :  The Corsair  softly chuckles) . Like most reality romances, it seems this one fizzled when the cameras shut off. Fortunately for Reguto, he still has his friends who also appear in the film.  Alex Burns , a model/actor who will appear in  Zach Braff’s  upcoming film 'Garden State', says working with his friend of fifteen years was 'a real pleasure, surprisingly.' The film also includes  Betsey Johnson ,  Carmen Kass ,  Mini Anden  and  Patrick McMullan  (who’s also listed as an associate producer).  "'Most fashion movies shoot [this world] two dimensionally and there’s this lack of respect for the people in it,' Reguto told  urlLink The Daily  Monday afternoon. 'Just because you’re dealing with a superficial world doesn’t mean the people in it aren’t real and don’t have problems … It’s not exposing anything that people don’t already know or haven’t heard stories about,' he says. 'There is darkness there and I’ve been apart of it, unfortunately.'” ( ed note : fashion movies shoot two dimensionality because the industry is two dimensional, frankly, Shawn, and I mean that in the most elegant and glamorous way)  On the glorious two dimensionality of the Fashion Industry, I'll leave you with this quote, also from  urlLink Fashionweekdaily , in answer to the fundamental ground-of-being philosophical question 'Who is your style icon':   urlLink Clio Manuelian ,  Ferragamo :  “ urlLink Ghandi  – I like his message, he’s man-orexic and we’ve got great kaftans for spring.”  I rest my case.

       Condoleeza Rice's Freudian Slip    urlLink According to New York Metro , the usually tight-lipped  urlLink National Security Advisor, Dr. Condoleeza Rice , let out something of a rather embarassing  urlLink Freudian slip :  "A pressing issue of dinner-party etiquette is vexing Washington, according to a story now making the D.C. rounds: How should you react when your guest, in this case national-security adviser  Condoleezza Rice , makes a poignant faux pas? At a recent dinner party hosted by New York Times D.C. bureau chief  Philip Taubman  and his wife, Times reporter  Felicity Barringer , and attended by  Arthur Sulzberger Jr .,  Maureen Dowd ,  Steven Weisman , and  Elisabeth Bumiller , Rice was reportedly overheard saying, 'As I was telling my husb?' and then stopping herself abruptly, before saying, 'As I was telling  President Bush .' Jaws dropped, but a guest says the slip by the unmarried politician, who spends weekends with the president and his wife, seemed more psychologically telling than incriminating. Nobody thinks  Bush  and  Rice  are actually an item. A National Security Council spokesman laughed and said, 'No comment.'"  As something of a creature of etiquitte myself, here are my suggestions to proper Washingtonians on how to handle another inevitable "Condi Slip":  Should the future MPAA Prexy refer to  urlLink Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia  as "my Wild Scallion," kindly inform anyone within hearing range, that yes, indeed,  urlLink scallion dip would go well with the crudites .    Should the National Security Advisor refer to Defense Secretary  Donald Rumsfeld  as " urlLink my jump off ," simply chuckle softly, as if a funny were made, then, lightly, change the conversation.  Should Condoleeza refer to  urlLink Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist  as, "Dr. Love ..", steer the conversation over to the recent health care bill. If she refers to him as " urlLink my Tennessee Stud ,"  run don't walk  from the vicinity.  Should Condi refer to Att urlLink orney General John Ashcroft  as, "my boo," briskly grab an appetizer, take a bite and remark to all those in the periphery, "Yes, Condi, they are good."  Should the National Security Advisor make any manner of "Condi Slip" regarding the name " urlLink DeLay ," make way,  post haste . There are some linguistic excesses that modern etiquitte are powerless to gloss over.

       Keifer Sutherland "Heartbreaking" Drunk?   That significant cultural artifact  urlLink The National Enquirer reports  that the man who would be  urlLink Mr. Julia Roberts  -- but wasn't (a stripper named  Raven  in Vancouver, don't ask)--  Kiefer Sutherland  spends lots of time knocking down scotch. At all hours. Not  urlLink 24 Hours , but:  "'Kiefer's been a big drinker but now he's pounding down the alcohol morning, noon and night,' an insider (told  urlLink The Enquirer )"   "Kiefer Sutherland, star of TV's 24 ... was caught knocking back Scotch at a Hollywood gay bar at 9 o'clock in the morning!  "And another source said: "Kiefer is well-known at dives in the scary Hollywood area where he lives.   "It's not unusual to see him downing glass after glass of J&B Scotch at one of these places any night of the week.   "And when they close at 2 a.m., then it's on to the after hours clubs."  "The ENQUIRER reported in March that the 37-year-old star got a gash on his head in a bar fight.   "And now The ENQUIRER has learned exclusively that on the morning of April 3, Kiefer was drinking at the  urlLink Spot Light ."   The Corsair cannot fail to note that LA.com describes The Spotlight thusly,:  "If you ever wondered where all the freaky trannies went during Hollywood's gentrification, this is the answer.   "The Spotlight is a dive and proud of it. This is where the flavorful underbelly of Hollywood gay life washes up. It's clear that most of the patrons have 'history'--we don;t ask and don't tell--but who knew the place had history, too? It's the city's second oldest gay bar (the oldest is the Friendship in Santa Monica), open since 1963."  It should be noted that it opens really early, which may or may not be factored into your conclusions.   urlLink The Enquirer continues :  "'Kiefer was falling-down drunk,' said an eyewitness.   "He wasn't surly or anything -- just the opposite, he seemed very happy and was obviously feeling no pain.   "There was a movie shooting across the street when Kiefer came out of the Spot Light for a cigarette. Several of the crew members on the shoot recognized him and came over to have their photos taken with him.   "He was very obliging to everyone, including the female security guard on the movie and one young mom who came over with her toddler in a stroller to get his autograph.   "But Kiefer reeked of alcohol and was unsteady on his feet.   "Finally he excused himself, saying he had to go back into the bar to sit down. 'It was so sad seeing him that way.'  And it goes on:  "A staffer at the Spot Light who was on duty that morning told The ENQUIRER: 'Kiefer started drinking at 9 o'clock in the morning with some buddies and didn't stop till after 1:30 p.m.   "'At one point, he was so hammered that he fell off his barstool and landed on the floor. But he just laughed it off.   "'He was drinking Scotch and his associates actually had to prop him up!   "'Some girl pulled down her pants and showed her butt to him and he said in slurring speech,  I'll show you something.   Italics  mine :  "'Then he pulled down his pants and exposed his butt to her and everyone else in the bar!'   "The eyewitness added: 'When Kiefer stumbled out of the bar, there were a bunch of cops hanging around the film shoot across the street. He laughed and said, Don't mind me, officers -- and just staggered away.   "'It was funny and heartbreaking at the same time.'"

"She said: 'I was surprised. He raps about having this bitch and screwing that one, but he didn't know how to excite a woman.  "'He was like a little virgin boy when I met him and he was 26 at the time. A lot of the stuff he raps about is bull****.'

The story goes on to say that the 30 year old Brazillian, who "dated" Eminem for 16 months was introduced by Eminem to rapper Dr. Dre as his "wife."  " '... He has a very tiny thing, nothing to tell your girlfriends about, and when we were together he sometimes suffered from premature ejaculation,' said Alvarez.  "... She said in July 2000 she had a pregnancy scare and Eminem had refused to discuss it. 'We had a row and that was the last time I saw him. Luckily my pregnancy was a false alarm.'"

She didn't:  "DESPITE what she told  urlLink Women's Wear Daily ,  urlLink Kimora Lee Simmons  was not the winning bidder at a hot auction at the  urlLink Martha Graham Dance Company gala the other night . The diva-licious designer of  Baby Phat  told the trade paper that she bid $16,000 to have  Manolo Blahnik  name a shoe after her in his next collection. But Manhattan podiatric surgeon  urlLink Dr. Suzanne Levine  says she snared the honor after shelling out $20,000. Dr. Levine quipped: 'If Kimora wants the auction prize that badly, I will sell it to her for $30,000 and donate my profit to the Martha Graham Dance Company.'"  Kimora wanted it bad.  Really bad . According to  urlLink this blog , which references the WWD article, "(Kimora) wanted it so much that she asked the manager to keep the bidding sheet from her competitors in the final moments of the auction."  Oh,  urlLink Kimora .   In : On  urlLink Chris Matthews  on Sunday, pony-boy wanna be Secretary of State  urlLink Fareed Zakaria  predicted in the "Tell Me Something I Don't Know" segment that  Ibrahim al-Jaffari  will be the US installed Prime minister of Iraq.  urlLink Globalsecurity.org  describes him thusly, "Ibrahim al Jafari, spokesman for the Islamic Dawa Party, which was persecuted by Saddam. Born in Karbala, educated in medicine in Mosul. Spent time in the United States and the United Kingdom. Shiite." We'll see how clear Zakaria's crystal ball is.    Out :  urlLink Geronimo's Bones . If, indeed, the rumors are correct, and Prescott Bush dug up Apache chief Geronimo's bones at Yale, this has got to be braught up in the debate.   In :  Kofi Annan's  "saintly aura." Despite the fact that he is, indeed a fuzzy headed irrelevant factor in world politics, twice in about as many days has Kofi Annan's "saintly aura" been invoked. First by  urlLink David Patrick Columbia, who wrote ,  saw Kofi Annan on Wednesday night at the Waldorf at the Citizens for NYC annual gala.  Frances Fitzgerald , the distinguished author and daughter of the late Marietta Tree, presented Mrs. Nane (pronounced Nan)  Annan with the Marietta Tree Award for Public Service . There were several other awards given out, but more about that on another day.  "Mrs. Annan, who is one of the most beautiful women in New York, like her husband, has a kind of saintliness about her."  And then, on  urlLink Topic A With Tina Brown ,  urlLink Johns Hopkins Professor Fouad Ajami , spoke of Anan's "saintly aura."  Not a vital, world-historical  urlLink Joan of Arc aura , surely.   Out :  urlLink Chris Rock's HBO comedy special . Am I the only one who thought that the last 45 minutes of marriage jokes were way too bitter and misogynistic? I am ... oh,  whatever.    In : Yoganistas. Today,  urlLink Fashionweekdaily  gives us a new word:  " Yoganista  (/YO-gah-NISTA/)  "NY may have its fashionistas (far too many of them, really) but LA has its very own "ista's": the Yoganista.  Yoga teacher/writer and all-around groovy chick  urlLink Anna Getty  coined the new term to describe 'former fashion-obsessed LA girls who are into yoga now - but still wear cute outfits to yoga class.' For daywear, these girls are more likely to go for  urlLink Joie ,  urlLink C& C , and  urlLink Nuala  over  McQueen  or  Chanel , but they take their yoga outfits seriously?it must look edgy, layered, soft, and of course, flattering. With  Madonna  as the yoganista fashion icon, how could they not? Look for  Anna Getty's  new column in  Fit Yoga  magazine in August."    urlLink VH1's Best Week Ever     Out :  urlLink Dubya is appointing UN Ambassador Negroponte to become the US Ambassador to Iraq .

       (UPDATE MON MAY 4) Page Six Blind Item Guesses    urlLink Those crafty Page Sixers write :  "WHICH newly single model/actress has a drug problem? Pals say the leggy looker has always dabbled, but now the cocaine habit is spiraling out of control - and the friends are siding with her estranged husband, who is clean and sober . . ."   Hmmm . Let me rack my brain on who this possibly could be. Newly single model/actress ... I'm thinking either  Cindy Crawford  or, quite-possibly-maybe,  Rebecca Romijn Stamos ?  Hmmmm.  Who would be the stronger of the two?  And the second: "WHICH pop star has a sex tape about to surface, a la  Paris Hilton ? The tape, shot by her own brother, shows her fooling around with a woman and doing cocaine and crystal meth between sex acts."  I haven't the faintest idea, but I'm sure in about a week or so we all will know, thanks to  Page Six . I posted the story on  urlLink theWendyExperience Board  and people think that it is either  Britney  (older brother  urlLink Brian Spears ) or  XTina  (younger brother  Michael Aguilera ) or  Avril Lavigne  (brother is  Matt Lavigne ).  Actually, I haven't the faintest idea about either of them.  urlLink I'm just continuing the conversation that the Page Sixers started, as any good media-centric blog is wont to do .   urlLink That PageSix.com  ... man,  it's like electronic crack  it's so addictive.  urlLink They must mix some high grade lactose in the Page Six recipe.   And, for those of you who need more of the electronic crack,  urlLink on Monday, May 4th, this blind item by those crafty Sixers :  "WHICH talk show host has a problem with a sexy segment producer? She's telling friends how he tried to slide his hand up her skirt during a private meeting."  I don't know who this is, but I am goddamned sure that  urlLink it aint Ricki Lake .

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  Desire  as opposed to  need , baby pop --  that's how we drop . Does that sound too  trippy ?  urlLink Is The Corsair being a tad too Schopenhauresque in formulations ? Let me do the remix, my little soupbones:  urlLink Fashionweekdaily , overheard at “French Kiss,” a night of dinner, dancing and gambling to benefit Memorial Sloan-Kettering’s cancer center at The Mandarin Oriental Hotel’s Grand Ballroom, on bidding on the silent auction items, “ Need  is so ten years ago; it’s all about  desire  now.”   Out :  Naomi Campbell  gets the big Italian boot ( ka-pow!)  from Valentino ("don't let tha door hit ya , where the good lord done split ya"),  urlLink reports JJ Martin of Fashionweekdaily :  "Campbell, whose level of celebrity here in Italy rivals the  urlLink Pope , is being replaced by  urlLink Gisele 'The Bod' Bündchen .  Gisele will be shot today and tomorrow in Val’s own backyard, Roma, by  Mario Testino  for the Fall/Winter 2005 campaign.  Valentino hasn’t shot in Rome since 1995, when  urlLink Arthur Elgort captured Claudia Schiffer looking as irresistible as Fellini’s fountain-bathing Anita Eckberg in La Dolce Vita .   urlLink Crazy, like Swayze : she's  urlLink like the wind  (ponders Naomi meaningfully,  then goes back to the snarky gossip ).   In :  urlLink InStyle writer Erica Kennedy , the godmother of  Russell Simmons and Kimora Lee's  daughter  Ming , is the  urlLink author of Bling , which, it appears, has already made quite a bit of  bling bling  and  urlLink hoopla among rap royalty -- names changed to protect the not so innocent .    urlLink The Page Sixers write :  " Vanessa de la Cruz , the 'bitchy faded supermodel,' is trying to open up her own image consultancy firm but doesn't like to do any real work, and is losing modeling gigs because of her bad attitude and age. Insiders giggle the character seems to be loosely based on  urlLink Naomi Campbell , who last year started  urlLink NC Connect , a publicity and image-relations firm.   "Meanwhile,  Lena Whittaker , 'the wild, hip-hop-obsessed daughter of a powerful entertainment lawyer,' is a cross between  urlLink Lizzie Grubman  and  urlLink Nicole Richie . At one point, Lena even hits someone with a glass - a la  urlLink Richie's fracas at Bungalow 8  two years ago ("say you, say me ...").  "There's even a comic take on Combs' mother("is she too a 'natural blonde'?"),  urlLink Janice Combs , via the character of Mama Jackson, a flamboyant older woman who rides on Lamont's coattails."   Writers can be so cruel . Present company excepted, surely. (altogether, now, my little soupbones: "... and don't call me  Shirley ")    Out :  XTina cancels US Tour . Scandal ensues. According to  urlLink the Sun , via  urlLink Ananova,  Christina Aguliera cancelled her tour at the last minute. According to  urlLink Victoria Newton :  "Doctors ordered the star to pull out of a 28-date US tour to avoid permanently wrecking her vocal cords.   "The singer said: 'I really look forward to getting back out there and I’m using this time to write for my next record.   "'It’ll make the next time I play live bigger and better because I’ll have time to get things right for the next tour.'  "Revealing the cancellation to disappointed fans, Christina took a swipe at pop rival  BRITNEY SPEARS  who has been criticised for miming during her world tour.   "She said: 'I’ve had vocal strain in the past because  I DO  sing live.'"   Oh-oh, XTina's getting punchy ; someone give her a film cameo, you know: she's beautiful ... no matter what they say. Although  urlLink XTina made number 14 in the Rolling Stone Magazine 2004 Rock Rich List , with $27.9 million, and her tour last summer with  Justin Timberlake  sold out big cities, roughly one year ago Page Six reported that  urlLink they were having problems selling tickets . Problems.  Hmmm.   Then again,  words can't bring her down.    In : According to  urlLink the indispensible Page Six , this is the moment of truth for the Sex and the City movie ( The Corsair  plays  urlLink The Final Countdown, by 80s hairband Europe ):  "Sources say  Kim Cattrall  is still holding out, demanding pay and airtime equal to that of her nemesis  Sarah Jessica Parker , and it's going down to the wire. 'If it doesn't happen this week, it doesn't happen,' said our insider. 'No one can believe Kim would pass this role up - it's not like there are that many offers on her table right now.  HBO  is desperately trying to convince her to do the movie, but it could go either way right now.'"    Nemesis . That sounds hott. Sounds vaguely superheroish. So, why not write a script capturing that nemesis chemistry:  Carrie and Samantha catfight .   Hey, I'm there .  Thousands of trim urbane women in  Manolo Blahniks  are pulling for Kim or HBO to come around.  And The Corsair is right behind them in that imaginary demonstration line, checking out all their assets.    Out :  Governor Shwartzenegger's  Teutonic lack of a sense of humor, what a stereotype he is becoming --  what a bore . Apparently, the Governator is planning on suing an outfit that makes bobbleheaded dolls of him, according to  urlLink the Smokinggun :  "Arnold Schwarzenegger is threatening to sue an Ohio company that is selling a bobblehead doll featuring the name and likeness of the California governor. In a blistering letter sent yesterday to the Ohio Discount Merchandise company, lawyer Martin Singer contended that Schwarzenegger was entitled to 'substantial damages' for the "unauthorized commercial exploitation" of the Republican pol's image on the $19.99 doll. With the exception of movie promotion, Singer noted that Schwarzenegger does not permit the use of his likeness on commercial products in the United States. Below you'll find a copy of Singer's letter. The Schwarzenegger doll, which went on sale about a month ago, is one of several bobbleheads featuring politicians that the Ohio firm sells ( John Kerry ,  Wesley Clark , and  Howard Dean  also retail for $19.99, while  George W. Bush  would only set you back $14.95). The bobblehead company contends that since Schwarzenegger is now an elected official, his image is public domain."   Please Arnold : let's just chalk this whole unseemly episode up to  urlLink the 'roid rage  (how sinister does that sound?) -- you know and I know, big guy, that you must have know that you've got a boatload of hormones from the animal kingdom in you that you shouldn't have in you,  dude , I'm talking about the wild horses, and what not, guy. The 80s were a different time; man to man, I know you did what you had to do -- it's bodybuilding, extreme stuff, hey, I'm socially liberal about that stuff.   Anyhoo : Fuck if I know, dude, but I'm not even fucking technically sure at this point  that you can even be classified as human anymore , you know what I mean? -- just -- just withdraw from these legal procedings  slowly  and blame it on your unnatural equine tendencies, no one will think the less of you. Let me take a flying leap into the unknown on this and predict that Arnold loses the case.  Badly . In fact, his pressing of the point makes him look a tad fascist about the press. Perhaps some enterprising reporters as a result  urlLink probe his dodgy deal "editing" Muscle and Fitness magazines while governing Cal--ee--for--nee--ahhhh . He is embarrassed at his inability to look humorously at himself. Just a guess, mind you, just a guess.   In :  Naomi Watts  is single. According to the  urlLink San Fransisco Gate, via the Daily Star :  "Hollywood beauty  Naomi Watts  has dumped her toyboy boyfriend Heath Ledger -- because he's 'so immature,' reports a British newspaper.  The '21 Grams' actress, 35, is fed up with being left embarrassed by 25-year-old Ledger's conversational skills and has decided to branch out on her own.   "According to the Daily Star, Watts said, 'He doesn't want to get married and have kids.   "'He is immature and unruly. He's always out clubbing with his friends.   "'He's so immature that it makes me look stupid for being with him.'   Naomi, I understand where you're going with this, he is a monosyllabic dummy, but he's 25. At 25 I sure as fuck know all I wanted to do was club and party and drink and make money.  urlLink But I'm drinking milk  ... so, Naomi ... call me?   Out : The rogue punk ass British troops who tortured the nameless, faceless Iraqi, who may or may not be even alive.  urlLink Paul Byrne of the UK Mirror writes (ed: note pictures accompanying the story are intensely graphic):   "A HOODED Iraqi captive is beaten by British soldiers before being thrown from a moving truck and left to die.  "The prisoner, aged 18-20, begged for mercy as he was battered with rifle butts and batons in the head and groin, was kicked, stamped and urinated on, and had a gun barrel forced into his mouth.  "After an EIGHT-HOUR ordeal, he was left barely conscious and close to death. Bleeding and vomiting and with a broken jaw and missing teeth, he was driven from a Basra camp and hurled off the truck. No one knows if he lived or died."  Accompanying the story is an Iraqi man, face covered with a paper bag, bleeding from the jaw, and urinated on by British soldiers.   urlLink UK Mirror writes :  " ... Chief of the  General Staff General Sir Michael Jackson  said: 'If this is proven, the perpetrators are not fit to wear the Queen's uniform. They have besmirched the good name of the Army and its honour.'  "No 10 said: 'The Prime Minister fully endorses the general's statement.'"   In :  urlLink From Flab to Fab : 90 days to a hot body, a la VH1. "Could you look like a rock goddess too if you had (a small army of personal trainers, nutritionists and stylists demanding one more sit-up, counting every calorie and picking out the perfect outfits to show it all off) at your beck and call?  VH1 proves that 'real' woman can in its two one-hour series, 'Flab to Fab,' premiering Monday, May 10th at 10:00 pm and Monday, May 24th at 10:00 pm."   Out : Trying to get the jump on  Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett , the second richest man in the world, and, if he will permit me to say,  urlLink one crafty motherfucker . According to  urlLink Bloomberg via The Age , when scalpers tried to make some money off Buffett online:  "Billionaire investment guru Warren Buffett is without doubt one of the most successful stockmarket investors of all time - and it appears he is just as savvy when it comes to sales strategies on the internet.  "When scalpers started hawking tickets to last night's annual meeting of Mr Buffett's famed investment vehicle, Berkshire Hathaway, in Omaha, Nebraska - offering tickets at $US117 ($A162) a pair on the eBay website - Mr Buffett, 73, jumped on to the online marketplace and offered 10,000 tickets at $US5 a pair. He blew away the competition.  "'He's got a situation where people are trying to take advantage of him,' said  Donald Yacktman , of Yacktman Asset Management, in Chicago.  "'Count on Warren Buffett to do something like that.' Berkshire shareholders got four free passes to last night's annual meeting, described as 'Woodstock for capitalists' by Mr Buffett, and most take along at least two guests. The tickets are keenly sought - after all, it costs more than $US3000 to buy Berkshire's cheapest share and secure admission unless you can go along as a shareholder's guest."  While Woodstock for capitalists sound, uhm ... well,  chic , you know,  somewhat , for the economics majors and software company CEO-types, uhm,  I guess (laughs nervously) : the big "to do" for tonight is still the  urlLink White House Correspondents Dinner , and the crunk Bloomberg jumpoff after party ("the roof ... the roof ... the roof is on ... fire"). No offense to the cocktails and BBQ's in Omaha, and, oh, who can forget the 6 hour q and a with Warren Buffett ---  sweet!   Uhm : but  no , Bloomberg's is still the pop off spot to get cookoo for cocoa puffs.  urlLink Wonkette handicaps the tables , with a jaded but sexy eye:   urlLink ABC : "ABC's table is so hot it's practically glowing. Unanimous agreement from all sources. Says one, 'ABC managed a triple play --with heavy-hitter hotties from Hollywood ( Affleck ), Sports ( Tom Brady ) and Washington ( Powell ,  Rumsfeld ,  Rove  ... OK, well Rove's not exactly 'hot' but you know what I mean).'"    urlLink Bloomberg : "Hottt but not on fire like ABC. (Says one operative: 'Even though Bloomberg has the party tickets, I'd say ABC managed the most-impressive, most-enviable 'gets.'") Still, impressive:  Candice Bergen ,  Minnie Driver ,  Drew Carey ,  Anna Kournikova . "  And, of course,  urlLink Kwame will be at the all important Greta Von Sustern table  ... (lulling sound of crickets in the moonlight) ... uh,  hello?    In : And, while we are on Washington, Kerry needs to get a pit-bull running mate who is able to go negative, thus allowing him to look Presidential.  urlLink Kerry is looking like Al Gore, Part II inside the beltway .  Who are the best pitbulls for this particular world-historical mission?  urlLink Bill Richardson of New Mexico  and the fiery and angry  urlLink Max Cleland of Georgia .  Hillary  would be far too volatile being the attack dog -- she would only coerce the base to come out stronger for Bush, dashing Kerry hopes at swing voters.  I hate to say it, but  John Edwards  is too positive a man for this ugly mudslinging race (sorry John), although he would be a damn fine  Attorney General , if  Ralph Nader  doesn't strongarm Kerry for that position at the last minute -- as we suspect that asshole will.  And to end on a positive note:  In :  Michael Musto  has been updating  urlLink La Dolce Musto as the week rolls by with top drawer gossip, to wit :  "BREAKING NEWS, 4.29.04 Watch out, Donald.  IVANA TRUMP  is about to announce the launch of her own reality show, called  Girls on Top . More details next week.   "BREAKING NEWS, 4.30.04 Web exclusive: Rumors say pop princess  MANDY MOORE  is being considered for a role (presumably Glinda) in Wicked. That should be a walk to remember."  So keep your eyes peeled to the  urlLink VV site . We are very pleased, as  there is no such thing as too much Musto . So there. I don't care who knows it.

       60 Minutes: America's Flirtation with Eugenics   Eugenics, a spurious philosophy that cannibalized Darwin, popular at the end of the nineteenth and top of the twentieth century, and American business executives (and academics at prestigious universities, showered with corporate money to lionize their exploits intellectually) did a flirtatious dance all the way into the 1970s. The philosophy goes as follows: businessmen and the wealthy are at the top of the intellectual food chain ( Paris Hilton ,  Donald Trump ?) because they can "survive" with the fittest, and, by contrast, the poor are mentally retarded and prone to criminality, and are thus unnecessary to the society.  CBS' Bob Simon  tackles the thorny issue if Eugenics in America on  60 Minutes  on Sunday.   urlLink The 60 Minutes website reads :  "The Nazis became infamous for it, but even before Hitler plotted his master race, America practiced eugenics and it's a secret that a 60 Minutes report brings back to center stage in all its ugly shame.   "Bob Simon's report on a state institution that once kept thousands of children away from the rest of society will be broadcast Sunday, May 2, at 7 p.m. ET/PT."   urlLink CBS' site continues :  " urlLink The Walter E. Fernald School in Waltham, Mass ., was once part of nationwide system of state-run institutions that warehoused children deemed "feeble-minded" -- in some cases right up until the 1970s.   " Michael D'Antonio  writes in his new book,  urlLink The State Boys Rebellion , that eugenics was an idea that peaked in the 1920s and 1930s.   "People were told, 'We can be rid of all disease...lower the crime rate...increase the wealth of our nation, if we only keep certain people from having babies,'" D'Antonio tells Simon."   urlLink The Tech at MIT wrote on itself in 1995 :  "At the Oct. 3 news conference that announced the completion of the committee's nearly 1,000-page report, (President Bill)  Clinton  made a formal apology to the thousands of subjects of radiation experiments reviewed by the committee.  "The report stated that children at the Fernald School were 'unfairly burdened' by researchers from  MIT  and  Harvard , who encouraged the children to take part in tests with promises of gifts or trips to Red Sox games.   "The researchers also appeared 'unwilling to respect' some children's wishes not to participate in experiments, according to the report. The parents of the children involved in the experiments were not told that the tests involved radiation."   Fuck . The 60 Minutes site:  "In fact, many of the children were not mentally impaired, but merely wayward or poor and uneducated with no place to go. Such children were often subject to the abuse inherent in large institutions.   " Fred Boyce  was committed to Fernald at 8 years old when his foster mother died. 'It was the easy way out. They didn't have to look for homes for you so they could dump you off in these human warehouses and just let you rot,' he tells Simon.   "Boyce spent 11 years there and was labeled a 'moron,' even though his intelligence was within the normal range. There were many others kept at Fernald who were not mentally deficient.   "'We thought for a long time that we belonged there, that we were not part of the species...[not]supposed to be born,' says Boyce, who describes a vicious cycle at Fernald of abuse and harsh punishments for trying to run away from the abuse.   "Moreover, the normal inmates like Boyce had to work long, hard hours in Fernald's gardens, orchards and other work areas and thus were denied a proper education."  They weren't deemed educable. They were poor.    urlLink Finally :  " Joe Almeida  was at Fernald at the same time as Boyce was. He relates a similar experience, but talks about another secret both men share: They were unknowingly subjected to radiation experiments at Fernald.   "'We were getting special treatment...extra dessert...extra milk,' says Almeida of the 'science club' they were recruited for. The food was radioactive, part of an experiment conducted by The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the government and the  Quaker Oats company .   "Boyce, Almeida and others in the 'science club' filed and won a lawsuit over the experiments. The $60,000 they each received was small, says Almeida, but no amount can replace the precious thing taken from him and thousands of others.   "'They took the most important thing in my life away...my childhood and my education,' Almeida tells Simon. 'The two things that you need in life to make it, they took from me'."   Mad scientist geekboys with human guinnea pigs in supply and business titans drunk on their invulnerability, deeming a class of people useless to their profit margins.  urlLink A sad alliance . Of Eugenics, at the height of the Eugenicist movement during the Industrial revolution, the conservative --  surprise!  -- urlLink GK Chesterton  wrote:  " I take one case of a more or less Eugenist sort from a paper that lies open in front of me --- a paper that still bears on its forehead the boast of being peculiarly an organ of democracy in revolt. To this a man writes to say that the spread of destitution will never be stopped until we have educated the lower classes in the methods by which the upper classes prevent procreation. The man had the horrible playfulness to sign his letter 'Hopeful.'"   Watch  60 Minutes  Sunday at 7pm, and, hopefully, America never lowers itself into that Nietzchean pit again.

       Livin' It Up With Ali and Jack! (or, Ali, You Got Some 'Splainin to Do!)    urlLink Rush and Molloy report  that  Living it Up  starring the oddly hyper  Mrs. George Stephanopouolos ,  urlLink Ali  along with her aging, charismatically challenged tv news mannequin sidekick  Jack Ford  (you know, the show with the  urlLink nonexistent ratings ) finally bit the big one (didn't you always know it would end up this way? why aren't  we  programming the networks?). Here's the poop:  "The syndicated talk show 'Living It Up! With  urlLink Ali  and Jack' was abruptly canceled yesterday with a stinging rebuke from  King World Productions  boss  Roger King  that left staffers stunned."  ( The Corsair  grabs a bag of unsalted popcorn, sits down in front of computer and reads on, excited at the prospect of another's downfall)   "The show, which appears locally on WCBS/Ch. 2, starred  Ali Wentworth  (aka  Mrs. George Stephanopoulos ) and  urlLink Jack Ford .  "A snitch tells us, 'King World senior vice president  Mike Stornello  called everyone into the room and said the show had been axed. Then he put Roger on speakerphone, because he said Roger wanted to say thank-you to everyone.'  "But our spy quotes Roger as saying: 'There will be no thanks. I want to tell you how I really feel. This has been the most painful and expensive experience that the company has ever been through.'  "King called it 'a disastrous show,' saying 'no one has worked as hard as they could, [and it] cost a lot of money.'"  ( The Corsair  covers his mouth, then whispers slowly to himself: " oh no he didn't ...")  "Ever the wit, Wentworth quipped after the tirade, 'Well, I feel better.'  "A King World rep told us yesterday: 'Roger expressed his disappointment and wished the staff luck in the future.'"  ( The Corsair  All purpose Simultaneous Translator:  The fuckers cost me money, so I'm gonna get the motherfucking last word up in this here bitch .)   "The only person who didn't get an earful was co-host Ford. According to our source, he had left early to play golf."   Jack Ford's  devotion to that shitty show is awe inspiring (wipes a crocodile tear) ... it gets me right here (pounds his chest, manfully).  urlLink In George Gurley's Observer piece , he wrote, "Mr. Stephanopoulos declined to be interviewed about his wife, but released a statement through Ms. Raftery: '(Ali Wentworth's) talent is undeniable and completely unique. She is the most wonderful mother and wife, but what many people dont know is her Chicken Marbella is unbeatable!"  Well, get used to that Chicken Marbella, Georgieboy (aggressively punches the air), cause something tells me you'll have that particular poultry dish quite often while "Dark Ali" is on haitus. And don't be surpised if she starts experimenting with different sauces and spices,  Georgie Porgie . Furniture will be rearranged on a daily basis. Unemployment is a bitch, my friend, little Clinton-traitor ... unemployment is hell ....  for the other spouse.   Our Boy Gurley also wrote:  "Over the holidays (2003),  Entertainment Weekly  had listed both Ms. Wentworth and her husbands shows as among the worst of 2003. The couple was blamed for 'spoiling both weekday and Sunday-morning TV.' EW commented that Ms. Wentworths 'madcap shenanigans' make her co-host Mr. Ford look 'like a suicide-watch candidate.'"  "The Daily News also put Living It Up! with  Ali and Jack  on their worst-of-the-year list (2003), and so did  The New York Times , in a print conversation between the papers TV critics.  Alessandra Stanley  called Living It Up! 'the worst daytime talk show in history' and said shed never reviewed it because 'very few watch it and it's just too painful and sad.'"  The painfulness and sadness is over. Old Yeller, the worst daytime talk show in history,' has been put down. Rest in peace, Livin' it Up with Ali and Jack.

       Fashionweekdaily: Fabien Baron of Paris Vogue has ADD   If I ever got  Fabien Baron  of  French Vogue  alone in an interview situation, there are so many questions I would ask him, most of which relate to conceptions of beauty and style,and probably I'd ask for some jet set gossip.  urlLink Fashionweekdaily  wanted to know about  urlLink Carine , because everyone wants to know about what it's like to work with  Carine , it's  Carine's  world, we just rent in it:  " Fashionweekdaily : What's it like working with  Carine ?   " FB : It's great working with  Carine .  I love her sense of risk, her desire for sexiness, her excitement for the new, her international taste, and the way she moves in her always-impeccable outfits -- quite something."  Then, sandwiched in between the data that his uniform consists of a black cashmere sweater and a charvet shirt, Levi's and Converse All Stars, we learn, coincidentally,  that he has a pesky little case of that chic disease-- attention deficit disorder  (all the stars are getting it, my little soup bone):  " Fashionweekdaily : Best and worst things about working in fashion?  What would you change?  " Fabien : The great thing about fashion is that it's only for six months. I think change is a good thing. But at the same token, the short-lived fashion world attracts people with short attention spans, which can ultimately create a sense of shallowness.  I wouldn't change anything because I have A.D.D."   Pow!  He's old school like that. Attention Deficit Disorder, thank you very much. That's pretty heavy stuff offered by way of admission to a total stranger. So, it was quite surprising to follow on, as Fashionwiredaily callously asked this man with attention deficit disorder the politically incorrect question:  "What's the future direction of  French Vogue ?"  Long distance planning from the ADD patient?  Fabien Baron's  answer, of course, in unsurprising:  "Who knows.  Let's see where the fashion industry is going.  I don't particularly think about the future.  What we do is concentrate on the moment, doing the best for the moment. I'm glad  Carine  also works the same way."  Next up, Fashionweekdaily interviews a Down Syndrome kid and asks him to solve calculus problems. And, coming soon, Fashionweekdaily sets up an obstacle course to race sufferers of Parkinson's Syndrome.  Sheesh.   And some people say I'm an asshole.

       Mark Cuban Likes Rebecca Romijn -- A Lot    Mark Cuban  is an arrogant, adolescent, overly aggressive and overbearing man-boy: a punk, in other words  a fucking Stallone . But he's big now,  urlLink as big as the google IPO , what, with that  urlLink 60 Minutes blowjob  last Sunday from  Steve Kroft  (after 5 unrelenting weeks of punishing the Bush Administration, last week's  60 Minutes  was the most Republican-loving episode of all time, with attack pieces on the cigar smoking midget  urlLink tyrant Sadaam lawyer , and two blowjobs each meted out to ultracapitalists  Mark Cuban  and a  urlLink South African mogul  named  Tokio ). I should know,  urlLink I interviewed him once . But he is funny, and  urlLink "id"  in his manner,  very primate , but his humor mitigates that. Or I could just be playa hating.   Anyhoo : That's why when I checked out his Blog at  urlLink BlogMaverick , and saw him discourse on the lusciousness that is  Rebecca Romijn  (kisses fingers with reverence, then continues in a dreamlike voice), I knew it was  a keeper , and I felt a faint sense of alarm for his wife, a surprisingly mousy woman, whom I have never met but for whom I foresee a cloudy future, drenched in riches -- an unexpected  financial windfall so to speak , after the Cuban stores his cigar in an unlawful humidor.  Mark Cuban  is not monogamy material: let's just put that on the table. Alpha men are generally not monogamy material:  "The sports world is always about what are you going to do next. Sports reporters want to get the story about the game over and done with as quickly as possible so they can bug the hell out of you about what you are going to do next. They will ask you the same damn question over and over.  Are you going to sign/resign/hire/fire XXXXX. That's 90 pct of the questions I get, and it's ridiculous because if I do anything, it's immediately available to everyone at the same time. So why not ask a question with some substance? Then I realized how lucky I was that I only had to put up with annoying repetition of questions.  "At the premiere of  urlLink Godsend  this week, I watched   Rebecca Stamos  deal with the same type of stupidity but at a level that made me realize and appreciate how little I have to deal with.  "The premiere was typical. Lots of paparazzi. It was cool to walk down the red carpet with my wife and Todd Wagner, my production partner. Cameras flashing, people screaming your name to look at them for pictures. But it was a pittance compared to what happened when she came by. My goodness. The questions probably would have had me jumping over the ropes to knock someone out. Personal. Personal. Personal.  She handled it like a champ. Laughing off questions she didn't want to answer and being incredibly gracious with her time. Of course I was only watching every step she took because I was curious how she would deal with the media. It was purely an intellectual exercise. I had to refer to the physics classes I didn't take to wonder how she fit in that dress. But I digress."  Yes, indeed you do, my favorite billionaire interview subject. I've got  50-50  odds that they divorce in a year and Cuban is dating Romijn by Thanksgiving.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  Ambassador Joe Wilson's  book,  urlLink The Politics of Truth , is the latest anti-Bush tome to come out.  urlLink His wife, Valerie Plame , was outed as a CIA operative to  urlLink creepy-eyed conservative columnist Robert Novak , and Wilson gets in the last word.  urlLink The Independent writes :  "Leaking the identity of a CIA operative is a federal offence and the FBI, headed by an outside prosecutor, has for several months been conducting an investigation and has put together a grand jury to consider evidence and hear from witnesses.  "Mr Wilson initially claimed it was Mr Bush's senior political adviser,  Karl Rove , who leaked his wife's identity, though he has since stepped back somewhat from that allegation. Reports suggest that other potential leakers could be Mr Cheney's chief of staff,  Lewis 'Scooter' Libby  or else  John Hannah , a senior national security aide on the Vice-President's staff. Either way, if anyone in the White House is found guilty of the leak to Mr Novak and others, it would be very damaging to Mr Bush as he campaigns for reelection."   The Corsair  has 60-40 action on  Scooter Libby  as the leaker, but my buddy,  Pookie , uptown on 125th Street (who also on the side sells bootleg cartons of Newports), is taking 75-25 odds on  John Hannah . Act like you know.   Out :  Rebecca Loos , she of the meaningful name. It's getting kind of tragic for our Rebecca; she is at 14 minutes and 45 seconds and it's beginning to look like a disaster.  urlLink Sky News is reporting  that no less than  Mohamed al Fayed  cut the buxom beauty's name from his guest list for a party:  "Rebecca Loos' new celebrity status took a knock when  urlLink Harrods' boss Mohamed al Fayed  refused her entry to a party at the store.  "Miss Loos had been expecting to return as a guest to the upmarket Knightsbridge shop where she worked as a 19-year-old.  "But the former PA, who shot to fame after her claims about sleeping with England football captain  David Beckham , was kicked off the list an hour before the bash.  "Al Fayed said the snub was out of loyalty and friendship to the Beckhams, who are customers at the store."  The UK is still all about the class distinctions. And, alas, in the end, the upper crust draws together close and protects it's own.   In : Corporate fat cats talking about fat americans. Oh, the irony is as thick as a McDonald's Milk shake. My old boss  urlLink Jason Calacanis' weblog  paraphrases a panel discussion of Nobel Laureates in Economics about -- of all topics -- obesity in America.  Imagine my surprise :  " urlLink Daniel Kahneman : Discussed the size - that in the US you get 30-40% more food on your plate then in other countries. He said that once the food is on your plate we dont have control.  " urlLink Gary Becker : (Jason agrees) with a number of things Danny said. If you look at weight gain in the USA and the US has been a leader in this (huge laugh.) He said weight gain started to speed up in 1980. What happened after 1980? He mentioned three of four factors: the cost of junk food has gone way done. It is much cheaper to get it thanks to technology to prepare (he mention French fries.) Secondly, the sedentary nature of the teenage population has changed significantly. He mentioned TV and computer activity, and that work is more sedentary.  "Then showed a slide with an escalator leading up to a gym (huge laugh.)  "The third factor is a tricky and difficult one, and I dont know how much weight to put on it. We are in an environment where medical progress has sped up. He says that the people are less concerned about things like weight because they believe that in the future we will have drugs to solve cholesterol problems and sex enhancement drugs (i.e.  Viagra .) He says this is all conjecture, but he believes it. We've only seen this increase in weight in the past 25 years.  "Milken paraphrases the concept as 'I can do what I want today and I can take a morning after pill.'"  Junk foods,  urlLink junk bonds , what's the difference at Club Fed, eh, Michael? (huge laugh)   Out :  urlLink Jill Sander over at Mediabistro  asked some prominent magazine editors who they think should get a National Magazine Award. The usual culprits were represented --  Paul Colford ,  David Carr ,  Choire Sicha ,  Kurt Andersen ,  Tina Brown  -- but then Jill went and asked Wired Magazine's Editor-in-Chief  Chris Anderson .  Big mistake , Jilly girl. Ol' Chris-co is not going to give the testosterone pull quote. He flips the script on bourgois geekiness and  takes it to a whole new level :  "Award: Best Cover. I'd give it to  Edge , a U.K. games magazine, which has the grooviest spot-varnished covers around. Minimalist, iconic, and often anime-influenced, they're probably a failure on the newsstand and I can't figure out how they can afford the production costs for subscribers. But each month I get a thrill just opening the polybag and a reminder of what magazines can do."  Ah,  the thrill of opening the polybag ...  Priceless.   In : Pumas.  urlLink FashionWireDaily reports :  "Sales at Puma soared 29.3% in the first quarter of 2004, powered by rapid growth in sales of its apparel.   "The German sportswear and apparel brand racked up sales in the first three months of 443.8 million Euros ($532.6 million), while sales of apparel gained a whopping 39% to 111.2 million Euros.   "Puma also revealed that the company had achieved record profit margins in the first quarter. Gross profit margins thickened to an impressive 51.7%, up from 47.2% in the like period a year earlier. Net earnings grew 64.6 percent to 80.4 million Euros."   Out : A-List Movie Star salaries. They are going to go down faster than Paris Hilton on Rick Solomon. This interesting quote from  urlLink Variety's coverage  of the Mike Milliken Institute panels goes, "In a later session with reporters, though, (Sumner) added that star salaries would have to come down and said studios have let A-list actorwalkalk away with a disproportionate share of the rewards.'" To be continued. The Corsair will keep you informed of upcoming developments --  same bat time, same bat URL .   In : Jay Z's "99 Problems" Video is  hot . Me? I've got 99 problems but a blog aint one. Thanks  urlLink Scott of Stereogum  for hooking us up with this shit.  Rick Rubin  is crazy in this trippy urban Brooklyn thuggernaut of a video.  Jay Z  gets sprayed with bullets a la  Tony Montana  in the end.    Out : Senate Democrats. According to  urlLink Alexander Bolton of TheHill , the whoring fcampaignign contributions is at a feverish pace  "Senate Democrats are offering lobbyists new access to Senate Democratic leaders and lawmakers in exchange for personal contributions of $25,000, the maximum amount allowed to national party fundraising committees.   "Democrats are energized by a spate of unforeseen Republican retirements that have dramatically reshaped their prospects of regaining control of the Senate this November."  "...To close the gap, Senate Democrats are turning to allied lobbyists and consultants in Washington, many of who earn big paychecks touting their ties to lawmakers on the Hill. To be a member of the so-called Majority Council a program run by the DSCC lobbyists must reach into their own pockets for a donation of no less than $25,000.   "...Lobbyists at that level will be made members of the elite council, a group that will meet with the Senate Democratic leadership every month or six weeks. The councils first meeting was held about three weeks ago, and another meeting will take place in the early weeks of May."   That's fucking disgusting.    In : And, closing on a positive note, the white wine slurping cucumber munching Fifth Avenue set got together to support the ballet ( yuck!  The Corsair doesn't eat swine, and  the Corsair  sees no redeeming social function in ballet, excepting  urlLink Neve Campbell's performance in The Company , which was  sexy ) in a civilized manner.  urlLink Fashionweekdaily reports , "As the 100+ crowd gathered for the luncheon, young ballerinas in tutus from The American Ballet Theatres costume archives mingled with the ladies who lunch, who were all wearing their very best  Carolina Herrera  outfits. The darlings of New York society think  Dayssi ,  Blaine , and  Muffie  mingled with the editors  Kerry ,  Amanda  and  Kristina . During lunch,  Carolina Herrera  staged a presentation of her fall collection for guests, followed by one-on-one consultations."  What other occasion would there be for braised artichoke bottoms with fava beans.  Fucking rabbit food. No wonder the Old Money Upper East siders are so mean. Hunger from  urlLink all that dieting  and the rabbit food!

       An Interview with John Kerry's Hair   Matt Drudge reports that  urlLink John Kerry, right before he flew in to appear on Meet The Press, had a $1000 haircut :  "On the Friday before his MEET THE PRESS appearance, Dem presidential hopeful John Kerry flew his Washington, DC hairdresser to Pittsburgh for a touch-up, the DRUDGE REPORT has learned.  "Cristophe stylist  Isabelle Goetz , who handles Kerry's hair issues, made the trek to Pittsburgh, campaign sources reveal.  "'Her entire schedule had to be rearranged,' a top source explains.  "A Kerry campaign spokesman refuses to clarify if Goetz flew by private jet on April 16 or on the official Kerry For President campaign plane.  "The total expense for the hair touch-up is estimated to be more than $1000, insiders tell DRUDGE.  "One source suggests the hairdresser was flown to Pittburgh on Teresa Heinz Kerry's 'Flying Squirrel', a Gulfstream V private jet.   "'Senator Kerry thinks Isabelle does a superb job,' a campaign source said.   "Goetz grew up in a small town in eastern France. She also does Hillary Clinton's hair."  You know the shit is going to hit the fan. Kerry can fucking wave goodbye to the red states after this East Coast prep school washingtonian shit.   Anyhoo: this gets me in the mood to recycle on old story I did, so, if you haven't seen it:  An Interview With Senator John Kerry's Hair By: Ron Mwangaguhunga  After several frustrated attempts, we were finally granted this important historical moment. So, without further ado, we proudly present for the first time: a print interview with Senator John Kerry's hair.  Interviewer: Charmed, I'm sure; why now?  John Kerry's Hair (hereafter JKH): I will concede that I have been reluctant in the past, but setting the record straight is important to me.  Interviewer: That, and the upcoming Democratic Party primaries. Would you care to take the opportunity to sum up your opposition?  JKH: Rather than disparage the talent in the room, I'd like to state categorically that I am the best head of hair among the Democratic Presidential candidates.  Interviewer: That is a bold statement.  JKH: Bold times call for bold statements, my good man.  Interviewer: Well, there is no denying that you are a striking coif.  JKH: Even by the considerable standards of Massachusetts, which were instituted by the Kennedy family. I am the measure of all things hair.  Interviewer: What aboutJohn Edwards? He has impressive hair, no?  JKH: (averted gaze) Well, if you go in for that sort of thing.  Interviewer: What is this that we are hearing about Dick Gephardt dying his eyebrows?  JKH: One hears rumors to that effect. (Unnerved) Look, what about me?  Interviewer: Sorry. So, tell us: what are your secrets to looking good. (confidentially) Is it Washingtonian power hairstylist Christophe?  JKH: Please. Christophe is so over.  Interviewer: So tell us.  JKH: You're going to laugh.  Interviewer: No, that would be unprofessional. Trust me, I won't laugh. What is your secret for looking so good?  JKH: Heinz Dark Brown Mustard  Interviewer: Oh dear.  JKH: Smeared liberally overnight, it works wonders. Also, I like to tell my constituents in Massachusetts that said mustard is just grand for use in grilled crab po' boys.  Interviewer: I'm sure it is.  JKH: So you see there are many political advantages to my wife, Theresa Heinz.  Interviewer: Yes, I was meaning to get to that.  JKH: I really am not at liberty to discuss her.  Interviewer: (crestfallen) Well, okay, how about the President’s economic stimulus plan?  JKH: Can't talk about that either, old boy. I'll leave the meditations on the merits of the President's plan to help Americans earn ends meet to the Senator. My primary concern, rather, is the avoidance of split ends.  Interviewer: Very well. Let's try something innocuous. What color are you?  JKH: That’s not a political minefield. I am chestnut with a liberal sprinkling of dusted gray.  Interviewer: Liberal, you say?  JKH: A poor choice of words, in retrospect. Let's just say I am a well textured mop of dusted-grey hair.  Interviewer: Are you worried about going completely gray?  JKH: Pardon?  Interviewer: It's a well known fact that the rigors and the burdens of the office of the Presidency turn their resident gray within the first year. That's a fact: look at Bush and Clinton and, as we speak, George W. Are you saying that you are not aware of this fact?  JKH: (hesitant) I am not unaware ...  Interviewer: Well then what is your position on going prematurely gray?  JKH: Ah, hair today, gone tomorrow?  Interviewer: If you say so. Now ...  JKH: You say that this going gray is an established fact.  Interviewer: Of course.  JKH: Right. Well, I'm going to have to close the lid on things.  Interviewer: -- But.  JKH: So good of you to drop by, but I have things to discuss with the Senator.  Interviewer: Oh well. Good luck in the primaries.

       Studio 360's Kurt Andersen Interviews Air America's Lizz Winstead   Of all places,  urlLink MotherJones.com  has an interview between  urlLink Kurt Andersen  and  Lizz Winstead , co creator of the Daily Show, who left Comedy Central after a  urlLink brutal feud with the dumb-as-wood politically incorrect mannequin Craig Kilborne .  Trippy.  But you have to watch  urlLink Andersen's martini dry wit . It comes up from nowhere, and zaps you on the social level something fierce and unexpected, like an uppercut to the chops.  I'm serious.   I know Kurt, somewhat. We worked together at New York magazine, back when he was editor and I was a hungry factchecker. Why, I remember, in another life, years later, being interviewed for a job at  Inside.com  by Andersen. The conversation was pleasant. It was the height of the dotcom revolution and in Silicon Alley, and he was starting a new business in an arena that I had been a minor player in for a year or so. The conversation turned to the small consumer magazine I was editing at the time,  urlLink MacDirectory . He asked me after the magazine. I launched into a spirited explanation of where I was steering the magazine editorially. We were to be the  urlLink Vogue Magazine of technology magazines , sexy, savvy, digital. He looked at me with a twinkle in his eyes, then leaned toward me, conspiratorially, saying, meaningfully,"No, Ron, I mean,  what  is MacDirectory."  All at once I felt the air drain from my lungs, and for a second hyperventillation seemed a distinct possibilty. Only Kurt's boyish grin told me that he was just kidding, cutting the tension, clearing the air. Kurt's like that.  Blam!  And then the grave demeanor is broken with the boyish smile. So, imagine my surprise when I read Kurt and Air America's prickly  Lizz Winstead :  " Kurt : When a  Justin Timberlake  and  Janet Jackson  thing happens, will you talk about it? Or will you purely be Halliburton and Iraq?  " Lizz Winstead : We will, [but] we might take less of a  Howard Stern  approach and try to break down why people are reacting the way they are and why, for God's sakes, the media is leading with it. Really: Is a society that embraces America's Funniest Home Videos so outraged that they saw a woman's breast? Or are they outraged because the woman is just too old to show her breast, because nobody wants to see the breast of anyone over the age of … I think 30 is the cutoff?   " Kurt : To have all of these modules of news comedy, that's a daunting prospect. Comedy can go wrong in a bigger way and make somebody turn the dial faster than just talk.   " Lizz : We're never going to do some gigantic six-minute sketch. And the comedy is going to have a purpose. That way I think people won't tune out. You've got to be a little bit fearless and say, 'This whole venture is a risk,' because no one's ever done anything this kooky before.   " Kurt : Is the plan to make money, lose money?  " Lizz : Make money.  " KA : Not just from  urlLink Ben and Jerry's ads ."   Fuck . That hurt. I could feel it from across the computer screen. I could see him winding up that suckerpunch. That's his MO, I tell you. Lull you into complacency with banter. Disarm you. Then  Ka-plooey , right cross to the solar plexus.   And while we're on the topic of  Ben and Jerry's , go get some free ice cream today, as  urlLink it is cone day  and the weather, in NYC, is ice cream friendly.  Deadlines make it impossible to blog tomorrow. I'll be back Thursday.

       A Little Bit of the Old In and Out    In : Quirky actor  Nic Cage  getting married to 19 year old waitress:  "According to  urlLink The Sun , Cage proposed to 19-year-old  Alice Kim  with a huge diamond and emerald ring.  Nicholas met Alice when he was out dining with friends on Valentine’s Day at  Sushi Avenue , where she worked.  "The star of  Gone in 60 Seconds  became so captivated by Alice while he was there that he invited her to the Oscars with him the following month.  "Cage, who is more than twice Alice’s age, created quite a stir at some of the Oscar after-show parties when he was seen with her on his knee.  "Since their Oscar date the actor has taken Alice in his private jet for several romantic meals in New Orleans and Chicago, where he has been filming.  "A friend said: 'Nic has really fallen for this girl.'   Hmm.     Out :  Halle Berry , the first African American woman ever to recieve a Best Actress Oscar, has  urlLink filed for divorce  from rhythm and blues singer  Eric Benet  (has anyone ever bought an Eric Benet album?), according to  urlLink Ananova :  "The couple were married for three years and separated in October. It is the second divorce for the actress, who was previously married to Cleveland Indians outfielder  David Justice .  "Tabloids speculated about Benet's faithfulness from almost the moment the  X-Men  star married Benet in January 2001.  "The two met in 1999 at a party to celebrate the premiere of Berry's movie  urlLink Introducing Dorothy Dandridge.    In : China.  Jason Calacanis  attended  urlLink The Miliken Institute's Roundtable Discussion: Perspectives on China in the Global Economy , and he presents a daunting portrait of competition against China in the next hundred years.  Harold Goldstein , the Managing Director of Xinhua Finance, the moderator, said:  "(Harold Goldstein) showed the following slide which shows the number of years to double per capita GDP. It took the UK from 1780 to 1838. It took the US from 1839-86. It took China less then ten years to do it twice—since 1978.  "Copper 97 to present 11 to 20% of the world’s total. Second largest importer of oil with 7% of the globe’s consumption. Harold says China has pricing power in shipping and commodities."  "... China may have a rough landing, it may see a precipitous drop in GDP over the next 24 months, but the more important story are the fundamental changes taking place. China is producing about 200,000 graduates in science and engineering each year – that is more then the US, Germany and Japan combined. I would argue the nature of the reforms means tha the china GDP growth story will continue even if there are bumps in the road."   Out :  urlLink The always interesting Dick Morris  takes  George Bush  to task for his presentation, his style and his rhetoric, which, Morris asserts, is way too geared towards white men (we agree):  "Asked whether they would give priority to 'letting terrorists know we will fight back aggressively' or to 'working with other nations,' men want to fight by 53-41 while women seek cooperation as their priority by 54-36 —  a gender gap of 30 points !  "But much of Bush’s problem is linguistic. He needs to develop a war-on-terror equivalent of his highly successful 2000 rhetoric about being a compassionate conservative committed to leaving no child behind.   "Women are a lot less interested in forcing democracy on Iraq than they are in preventing suffering there and promoting safety here."   In : Wonkette. It's always a bonfire of the vanities over at Wonkette. But this time, she catches the city's powerful in DC making perfect asses out of themselves. To wit, the big Bloomberg after party for the White House Correspondent's dinner.  urlLink Wonkette says :  "We hear that some enterprising journalists have been attempting to score invites to the big Bloomberg  urlLink White House Correspondents' Dinner  after-party by saying they need to get in because they are 'covering' the party. But those trying this tack clearly haven't coordinated very well -- either that, or a certain local paper is planning entire special issues around the event. What's more, some of these reporters aren't exactly known for their society coverage, though this has yet to stop anyone. Says our source: 'I can see it now: The Bloomberg after-party -- a pespective from Baghdad.'"  In related news,  urlLink Kwame Jackson of The Apprentice  will accompany Great Von Suistern to the Dinner on Saturday Night.  Invitees to the Bloomberg after party include  Ben Affleck  (Ben's acting career is at an all time low, a political career might do him sone good),  Meg Ryan ,  Jimmy Kimmell ,  George Clooney ,  Drew Carey , hopeful country music crooner  Minnie Driver ,  Mary Louise Parker ,  Candice Bergen ,  Mary-Kate and asley Olsen  (please someone, give Mary-Kate  some stew ),  Anna Kournikova ,  Serena Williams ,  Diane Sawyer ,  Barbara Walters  and former Iraq War POWs  Shoshana Johnson  and  Jessica Lynch .   Drew Barrymore  will be shooting a documentary at the dinner and after party on the 2004 election.  Sometimes, the respective roles of each component of the DC-LA-NY power nexus get all mixed up and the power, the glamour and the media all converge at a single event.  urlLink This is that event .   Out : OneWorld? One debt. Remember OneWorld, that unreadable urban magazine with all the pretty pictures and interviews of Russell Simmons' family each issue? It's having trouble paying freelance writers.  urlLink David Carr of the NY Times  (and topic A with tina Brown) writes:  " urlLink Ward Sutton , an animator and illustrator, said he was owed $2,550 for a comic and illustration he drew for ( urlLink OneWorld ) magazine. He sent a note asking for payment after the final issue, and received this reply from the publisher,  John N. Pasmore , 'OneWorld has no ability to pay its bills and unless something unexpected happens, OneWorld will file for reorganization (Chapter 11) or dissolution (Chapter 7).'"   wow. It sucks to be  Ward Sutton  right about now.

       Is Mary-Kate Olsen Too Skinny?   That significant cultural artifact  urlLink Star Magazine  runs the subject of the world famous Gemini twins. Is she too skinny?  Peter Davis ,  Victoria Gotti  and  Nathan Cooper  share authorship on this:  "First she ditched her twin sister Ashley's sunshine-blonde hair color in favor of a reddishbrown hue. Now, on the eve of the May 7 opening of the Olsen twins' $40 million debut feature film,  urlLink New York Minute , Mary-Kate is upping the ante in her quest for individuality by becoming  urlLink skeletal-thin , observers say.  "Mary-Kate looks shockingly skinny in recent photographs, leading some to question whether the pressure of her busy career is taking its toll.  "'It looks like she's got  urlLink no body fat  at all,' says psychologist  Dr. Robert Butterworth , who has closely examined the pictures of Mary-Kate, but does not treat her.  urlLink 'She seems thin . I think she's underweight and  urlLink she's hiding it .'"  "...  And with adulthood around the corner -- the twins turn 18 on June 13 -- the girls are gearing up to attend New York University this fall. If that weren't enough, Mary-Kate is also in the midst of her first serious relationship -- she dates Boston University student  David Katzenberg , son of DreamWorks honcho  urlLink Jeffrey Katzenberg ."  The article concludes:  "Though a rep denies that either sister has an eating disorder, other reports paint a different picture. At a Hollywood function in December, according to one source who was there, Mary- Kate and her sister barely touched their food. 'They both played with the food on their plates, moving the food from side to side,' the source says. 'And Mary-Kate looked like nothing but skin and bones.'"  Sad.

       The Corsair's Remote Control Tour Diary, 2.0   I originally ran this several months ago, but as the cable universe changes and evolves faster than  urlLink Kylie Minogue's face , I'm adding on some new channels and my commentary for the newbies. There are also new stories beneath, so, scroll,  my little soupbones.   There are over  500  cable channels nowadays, so who better to give you a tour of some of the major ones?    Anyhoo:  500 channels means "niche marketing." And with all those niches, things can get confusing as to what is being marketed and to whom. So,  The Corsair  will help the viewer through the wonderful world of cable with these pithy explanations,  In Media Res:    TNT : Lousy with Middle aged  Testosterone. A musky-smelling channel.  Bruce Willis  and  Steven Seagal  action flics and basketball. Big in New Jersey.   MTRS : Fashion runway shows. Sexy models on the catwalk in sheer gowns and hip music. The only channel where the velvet rope is open to horny teenage boys and fashion industry insiders. Democracy at work.   CNN : Used to be a channel for Kings and Queens and heads of state, but of late it has morphed into the channel  urlLink republicans love to hate . Establishment without the ratings or juice. Pity CNN:  They used to wine and dine with kings and queens, but now they are laying in the gutter eating pork and beans.    Lifetime : A channel earnestly devoted to fanning the smouldering resentments of Midwestern housewives. Husbands are, of course, to blame in most of these story lines that usually end with a favorable courtroom verdit ..  for the wife who killed her abusive husband . Anger is the predominant emotion. Hollywood has not been kind to  Nancy McKeon . Hell hath no fury like  Joanna Kearns  scorned!   ABCFamily : The channel devoted to Christian  urlLink tween girls  in a nuclear family with a conviction that human history has a purpose beyond this world.  Halleleuia . Lots of  Mary Kate and Ashley films , which, ironically, attract a  very different  sort of crowd than the ones that these cats are aiming after.   CNBC : This channel serves as "White Noise" for the various strip joints in the Wall Street and financial district vicinity. As your  Bud Fox -like trader with a "Lawng Island" accent sips a  Stoli  on the rocks on his lunchbreak, sniffing his "Bolivian white Powder" ("Vitamin C"), getting a "friction dance" from his favorite "dancer," he can look over her shoulder, casually, and catch a brief glance at just how the markets are doing, and get a gauge on when he should return to the office.  Maria Bartiromo  as metaphor for the ideal Long Island investment banker's trophy wife.   A&E : An elderly folks network with lots of  Murder, She Wrote , and "original" films like "Horatio Hornblower," for viewers who can remember their glorious years of service in the British Imperial navy policing those hectic colonial ports. And  urlLink Biography . Old people love reading and watching biographies. Another life not their own, I suppose.   History : This is the  Hitler  and  Outlaw Biker  channel. At any time of the day, there is a  hilbilly bar with serious discussions going on as to Hitler's "tactical blunders" and what they would have done "different," with this channel serving as the background noise.  urlLink Attila the Hun  and notorious historical persona, like  urlLink Vlad the Impaler  are big here.   Discovery : This is the older, skeevier companion network to the already low rent  History Channel , which means that it attracts a  comparatively downscale sort of viewer  than one would expect at History, which is not saying much at all. Seriously, though, This is the  straight up  serial killers network. No joking, yo. Somewhere in the Yosemite Valley there is a man, in a dungeon, sweating profusely, wearing clown makeup and laughing at the moon. He is surrounded by dog collars and he is described by co workers at the post office as "a solitary man."  Guess which channel this guy is watching to drown out the screams. That's right (sotto voce)  Discovery . Homeland security  must needs  to monitor anyone who watches  more than 3 hours a day of this shit .   VH1 : Perhaps the coolest channel on basic cable or otherwise ( full disclosure : I write for  urlLink VH1's best blog ever , on occasion), my little soupbones! Suffused with irony, snark and nostalgia, this channel supplies the basic components of the urban diet.  Michael Hirschorn  is our god;  we are not worthy .   MTV : No longer cool: a  little  resentful of the joie de vivre its older, more successful brother,  VH1 . It will never be the  80s  again and the blush has wore off that ordinary looking frat boy  Carson Daly . Lots of prank shows, like  urlLink Punk'd  and  urlLink Wild Boys . TV for the low attention span generation (thanks hippies for dropping the kids in front of the gameboy) Even extreme sportsmen need eye candy for the downtime.   E!:  Creepy celebrity stalking and gossip. Everyone on this channel reeks of thwarted Hollywood ambitions and plastic surgery gone awry. This channel hasn't had a hit since  Greg Kinnear   was up in this bitch , and  Jules Asner  snatched  Steven Soderberg , using the Asner name (she divorced  Ed Asner's  son years ago).  urlLink E! stands for envy , which is the predominant emotion expressed on this channel.   ESPN:  This is reality tv for the Maxim set. Faint but palpable homoerotic subtext conveyed via "hero worship" of alpha males, like, say,  Shaq  or  Sprewell  (but viewers call him with the jocular-guy-pal sobriquet "Spree," cause,  like , they know him personally in a  Calvin Klein  kind of way), but, of course, your average  Joe Fratboy  will never acknowledge that distrubing little truth.   Bravo : For the affluent gay man, but not as culturally prestigious as  urlLink BBC America , because BBC has that whole colonial cachet -- pre 1776. Cultural programming( National Dog Show ,  Cirque du Soleil ,  Inside the Actors Studio )  and  Queer Eye For the Straight Guy  rebroadcasts. Excellent movies like Deer Hunter are occasionally sprinkled into the programming.    BET : A seriously embarassing network marketed to the seedy stereotype of the urban underclass. Ghetto comedy skits told in unremarkable english with frequent reference to bodily functions;  charmed , I'm sure. Snakeoil selling televangelists like  urlLink Crispy and Taffi Dollar  -- how  ghetto  -- prevail over the airwaves on Sundays. And C-List Blaxploitations flix fill out the rest of any regrettable week spent watching this schedule.  urlLink Can you fucking believe that Viacom paid three billion dollars for this channel ?   Sci Fi:  The repressed sexuality channel. Their niche is the grown man who has a crush on the X Man,  Storm  and dreams in full-on video games. Somehow the unresolved "sexual energy" gets worked out into a reverence for the "paranormal." B List hot chicks like  Shannen Doherty  and  Tracy Lords  end up here after Hollywood is through with them.   Fox:  If you go in for  Karl Rove's  talking points, this is the channel for you.  The Corsair  has to admit that he watched it during the  Second Gulf War . Fox routinely scooped the other networks because it sometimes seemed that Rummy gave them the inside scoop. For a "family values network," the women broadcasters have an  oddly pornographic patina  about them. Hmmm.   Showtime:   Tries earnestly to out-extreme the original programming at  HBO , who got there first. Dreams of getting recognized at events like the  Golden Globes ; not likely, however. This is the place to try to pitch your indie documentary on transexual underwater basket weavers in  Micronesia .   Food : For people who's interest in food has transcended the purely phenomenal eating stage. We still like the  urlLink Iron Chef , though.  Fuku-san , ("yes") I just heard that the Iron Chef, that  urlLink odd Asian man  dressed in a Rennaissance courtier outfit via  Liberace  and Samaurai style days was munching a yellow pepper.   TLC:  This channel is a bit of a mystery to me. It used to have a niche as a sort of  Cliff Clavin  channel: you know, for the general interest trivia mind-- programming on the  imago  stage of child development, poisonous reptiles, the  Minoan  civilization,  Roman  mosaics, classical biological warfare, the robber barons, volcanoes, that sort of thing. But now it has a lot of "fixing up the home" programming. Go figure what that means.   AMC:  Kind of Cool. Old Hollywood glamour with some original programming and commentary on the Gilded Age of Hollywood. This is like a channel put together by the editors of Variety looking backward. Vanity Fair should do a show here. Old school.   FX:  Not worth talking about. Maxim lite. Loads of testosterone. A warehouse for old Fox Tv shows.  Married ... with Children  repeats, anyone?   We:  Women's fantasy. Lots of  Merchant-Ivory  Brit productions of aristocrats who fall in love with common women, who are often middle aged American divorcees. Pure drivel.   C-Span:  For the ultra political science geek. Viewers tend to look like  urlLink Michael Barone , wait anxiously for their  New Republic  copies to arrive, and chuckle over Senate voting record statistics. Can rattle off the precise wording of the Republican Party platform of 1964.   Oxy:  Very "sisterhood" oriented;  Oprah  and  Gerry Laybourne's  experiment has recently taken a sort of Sapphic detour of late with regard to their programming.   National Geographic:   Interesting and kind of cool. This is a channel about animals and exotic cultures and taboos.   IFC:   So earnest, so hip, so anti-Hollywood: yet as soon as  Dinner for Five's  indy star  John Favreau  gets to do a big shlocky Hollywood film like  Elf , he jumps like a Cocker Spaniel being offered a dog yummy. Independent cinema is dead.   TCM:  This is a less hip AMC. This is like AMC with a broken hip. Lots of old movies with no irony or relevant commentary.   Ovation:   The Corsair  has a theory that this is a piece of flotsam adrift on the vast media ocean that is digital television. They repeat the same ten or so programs ad nauseum. Is there anyone employed at Ovation? Did the programmer have a heart attack in the 80s? Did anyone notice? Is anyone watching?   ESPNClassic:  Oh, dear lord help us. Old men with beer bellies reliving "classic sports moments." (At this point,  Bruce Springsteen's   Glory Days  should be playing). This is the tv channel  Al Bundy  would most likely be watching on his day off from the shoe store.   SoapNet : This is ESPN Classics for the housewife. For those who missed an episode of  urlLink One Life Too Live  because the pesky rugrat swallowed a button. Imagine the inconvenience. Bon-bons are big advertisers.   TVLand:   Tries to be all retro-ironical, but street cred will not be forthcoming by running repeats of  Bewitched  and  Sanford and Son , alone. Poor saps. The other networks have bought all the good old tv shows, leaving TV Land to contemplate Mayberry.    Animal Planet:  Television for committed vegans and PETA members. What kind of ad revenue do these guys generate? Pet detectives and other odd programming fill the bill.  The Corsair  has heard that lots of pet owners keep the channel on while they go to work.   Sundance:   An edgier IFC; very left wing political, but  pure .  Robert Redford's  pet liberal project. While IFC pretends that they their directors will have the integrity to turn down 3 picture deals to make  urlLink crappy Hollywood car-chase pictures , these guys really would rather do a documentary on Micronesian head hunters.  So there .   Trio:  Perhaps the coolest channel of them all. What VH1 viewers will most likely watch after they all "sell out" (I didn't sell out, I  bought in ) . Used to be a Canadian station, believe it or not, back in the day, with lots of Canadian mountie dramas. A station devoted to the sophisticated amateur sociologist interested in the decline of Western Civilization. In a detatched, ironic and witty manner, of course.   NWI:  A wrap up of all the international anti-American news agencies.  Al Gore   urlLink is having as much trouble buying this station  as he had in Florida. Are you going to blame Nader for this too, Al?   DiscoveryTimes:   One of the strangest channels in the world. this is actually the  New York Times'  channel, but it is devoted to showing America militarized or in crisis, which, all told, are the moments when  The Old Grey Lady  was at its finest. Lots of Civil rights struggles, war footage, terrorism analysis, and --wierdest of all -- endless looks into our military academies.  What the fuck?!    FUSE:  MTV's unsuccessful competitor for the extreme generation low attention span kiddie market, which is not saying much.   VH1Classic:  Could be interesting, as the X Generation is big on nostalgia, but right now this channel is  not happening.    USA:  This is the sybil channel. It is high testosterone most of the year, but come holiday time it is all about the holidays... kinda like our dads.   Style:  If it is possible this is an even more shallow channel than E! Lots of C-List types talking about the beauty business. Hair care, weight loss, mascara ads predominate.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  Sofia Coppola  and  Quentin Tarrantino , according to  urlLink Gawker , ar an item.  Fuck . I'll be the depressed blogger sucking down can after can of  urlLink Sofia Blanc de Blanc.  Looking like  Woody Allen  at the end of  Crimes and Misdemeanors.  I mean, what does  QT  have that I don't .. wait, don't answer that.   Out : Bill Clinton Drama. According to  urlLink The New York Magazine Intelligencer column this week , Clinton's memoirs may come out in  August!  Thus interfering with the Kerry campaign (unless --wink, wink -- Hilary is on the ticket -- wink, wink):  " Bill Clinton’s  long-awaited memoir may finally have a release date, and if so, it’s not good for the  John Kerry  campaign. A publishing source says the Random House book, most recently slated for June, will hit stores in August, after the July Democratic convention and less than three months before the election—and some Kerry supporters fear it may divert attention from their candidate. Clinton is addressing the Random House sales force this week. (He’s also agreed to speak at anti-Bush political organization  MoveOn.org’s  benefit on May 11 at the Apollo.) A source close to Clinton will say only that he’s finishing up the book as fast as he can—and that it could come out before the convention. Random House declined to comment."   Damn.    In :  urlLink Paris Hilton, the new model for Guess ? Paris in the Fall ... campaign. We can now forget that whole  urlLink porn business .   Out :  urlLink Wall Street Journal . Bad news for the paper. According to  Jenny Bailly  of  urlLink Fashionwiredaily :  " Mohamed Al Fayed's  latest litigious move has gotten the green light. A High Court judge has ruled that Harrods can proceed with a defamation claim against Dow Jones and Company, owner of the  Wall Street Journal .   "Harrods boss  Al Fayed  took issue with a WSJ story published about the Knightsbridge department store on April 5, 2002, headlined 'The Enron of Britain?' In response to a press release issued in jest by Harrods on March 31, titled 'Al Fayed Reveals Plan to  Float  Harrods,' the financial paper warned that if the company ever went public, investors would be 'wise to question its every disclosure.'   I guess the April Fool is the Journal.   In :  Eminem , the most metrosexual rapper ever. According to that significant cultural artifact  urlLink Star Magazine 's  Laura Schreffler , Em likes to  urlLink pamper  himself:  "On April 12, during his European trip, reports say the 31-year-old rapper indulged in luxurious treatments at the spa in London's posh  urlLink The Dorchester hotel , where he was staying.  "Though a spokesman for  The Dorchester Hotel  wouldn't comment on Eminem's specific treatments, a staffer at the spa said he hit the tanning beds (which can cost up to $60 for a half-hour), the massage tables and pedicure baths -- accompanied by four big bodyguards who stood sentry outside the treatment rooms! Staffers say he was nice, sweet and friendly, 'nothing like you would expect.'  "But Em's no stranger to pampering: Reports say he's also been seen in Hollywood's upscale  urlLink Ole Henriksen Salon  for pore-cleansing facials."  Now, if only he could find something to rap with  aromatherapy .   Out : Vanity.

MSNBC's  urlLink Jeanette Walls gets the scoop :  "The much-loathed reject from 'The Apprentice' was scheduled to appear on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live' last week, but refused to go on air when she saw a lie detector test backstage.  “'The lie-detector test wasn’t even for her,' a spokeswoman for the show told the Scoop. 'It was intended for Jimmy’s Uncle Frank [a regular character on the show], but when Omarosa saw it, she just freaked.” Some fellow contestants have accused Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth of lying when she said one of them used the N-word. 'We tried and tried to calm her down, but she just kept saying  I’m not going on stage with that lie detector test , then she just walked out. It could have been a problem because we’re a live show. Luckily,  Camryn Manheim  [of ‘The Practice’] was also a guest, and so she just stayed on a while longer and cracked jokes.'"

       Topic A: Jay McInerney's Ex Wife's Plastic Surgery   Just what the fuck occurred with  Tina Brown  on last night's  urlLink Topic A with Tina Brown ? Was it the  urlLink book deal (Thanks, Gawker )? As she gave her " urlLink hot pick ," and she said goodnight, just before that sort of porny-speakeasy jazz music started wafting through the studio, and the credits rolled, she got a michievous twinkle about her eyes, then she leaned in to novelist-panelist  urlLink Jay McInerney  and asked about his ex wife,  urlLink Helen Bransford , and her plastic surgery.  And the fucking mike's were still live!   Did Tina know what she was doing?   urlLink Julie Breeson of Boston Magazine summed up  the beginning of Bransford's facelift book thusly:  "Helen Bransford, author of  Welcome to Your Facelift  (Doubleday, 1997) and wife of Bright Lights, Big City author  Jay McInerney , took the plunge at 47, getting lipo under the chin, a forehead peel, an upper-eyelid tuck, dermabrasion (removing fine wrinkles through an abrasion tool), and a standard facelift, all at once. The chronicle of her surgery began with what she describes as a 'trigger event.' Her husband came home one night after interviewing  Julia Roberts  and raved about the actress' beauteous attributes. Helen was understandably jealous, but Jay reassured her he had told Julia all about her, leaving out only the pesky detail of her age (Helen is seven years older than Jay). This sent her running pell-mell to plastic surgeons across the nation for advice, ultimately having her operation done near her home in New York City."  Despite the fact that Bransford wrote a  urlLink book on her facelift , which is in the public record, Jay didn't feel like letting all 70 members of Tina's viewing audience (only kidding) in on his personal life.   Obviously , Tina felt the topic was too personal to bring up  during the show , even though one of the topics was  urlLink The Swan and all those nutty reality plastic surgery shows.  So, uh, why the fuck bring it up when the mikes are still live, where evil bloggers like me could post it online for all the world to see?  "Now it seems so quaint that I would have (had) those reservations," he replied to Tina. And just as the show cut, bloated Brit  urlLink Paul Theroux  could be heard saying, " ... it's grotesque."  Oh, what  The Corsair  would have given to have been a fly on the wall in the ensuing, uncensored, chat on plastic surgery.  The UK Guardian's book section did a wondeful and snarky and gossipy profile of McInerney, which I reprint, in part,  urlLink here , as he talks about life with his third wife, now ex-wife,  Helen Branford :  "( A new life was) marriage to  Helen Bransford , and moving to Tennessee. But now that, too, is over. This again raises the question always asked by Jay-watchers: is he really a good boy pretending to be bad, or is he actually as bad - as callous and brattish - as he can sometimes seem? Naturally he has always favoured the former view, and said two years ago, 'I think I've been trying to prove I'm a really bad guy for 20 years, that I'm not a mother's boy. But part of me is stuck with being a Catholic boy who is slightly shocked by things.' Part of him - but perhaps a decreasing part. He once admitted that, as a teenager, he was deeply influenced by the Playboy 'Adviser' section and he still retains that slightly tacky notion of sophistication - he really has to have a beautiful woman on his arm. And the emotional detritus is piling up."  Some people are deeply influenced by  urlLink Nabokov , and others The Playboy Advisor. But what happens when one is influenced by Playboy Advisor?:  "(Jay) says he's not behaved so badly. 'I don't think I've left a trail of  urlLink weeping women  in my wake. I mean, the number of serious relationships I've had has not been into double digits. Merry [his second wife] once said I was a very dangerous man, but I don't know many people who would agree with her. I think I have a much more tempestuous and eventful amorous life than the average middle-class citizen, but I wouldn't agree that I necessarily behaved dishonourably. The score is about equal between me and the opposite sex!'   "Perhaps. His first wife,  Linda Rossiter , was a half-Japanese model whom he met when he was living in Japan on a Princeton scholarship. The marriage lasted for precisely four months - she went off to the Milan collections and never came back. Then in 1981, while studying at Syracuse under  urlLink Raymond Carver , he married a PhD student called  Merry Reymond . He was still living with her when  urlLink Bright Lights, Big City  was published in 1984, and changed his life. He claims that no one thought he was handsome till he became a famous writer, but suddenly every door in New York was open to him, everyone was offering him cocaine, and models were passing him their phone numbers. It was exciting for him but confusing for Merry: 'She married a graduate student and woke up married to an MTV star.'"   The Corsair  munches on popcorn, riveted to the screen, at the thought of the 80s, models passing telephone numbers and half-Japanese models:  "In 1987 he left her for a model,  urlLink Marla Hanson , who was then headline news as a result of having had her face slashed by a mugger. Merry suffered acute depression, attempted suicide, and was in a psychiatric hospital for nine months. He paid the enormous bills, which wiped out his earnings from Bright Lights, and said, 'Yeah, I did feel guilty, but I paid a lot of money to expunge the guilt.' One of the best stories in How It Ended seems to relate to this period. It is about a famous actor going to visit his estranged wife in a psychiatric home, and wondering why he keeps delaying their divorce. 'Sometimes he suspected he was afraid to let go because she was the only person who wouldn't allow him to reinvent himself completely, into something bright and shiny and superficial... [She] was perhaps his best chance to remember and preserve the best of what he had been.'   "So he was slow to divorce Merry and never got round to marrying  Marla Hanson , though they stayed together for four years. He remembers it as 'a very obsessive relationship, throwing glasses at each other, cheating on each other. It was very exciting.' But she left him in 1991, walking out with her portfolio and her diaphragm, just like his first wife. Within days, he rang an old friend,  Helen Bransford , asked her out, and suddenly they were in love and married three weeks later at City Hall. She came from a very grand old Tennessee family (the family seat, Belle Meade, is now a museum) and he seems to have fallen in love with the South as much as with her. They bought a country ranch near Nashville, and he signed off from New York with his big valedictory novel  Brightness Falls . His next novel, The Last of the Savages, was set in the South, and the interviews he gave on publication were all about horses, heirlooms, ancestors, and revealed a hitherto-unsuspected vein of snobbery. He claimed, 'I always wanted to live in the world that I have ended up living in.'"   The Corsair  mouths the words, softly, reverently, "I always wanted to live in the world that I have ended up living in," pausing on the syllables, trying them on for size. The profile in  urlLink the Guardian continues :  "But the Tennessee idyll was already flawed. Helen was 43 when they married - seven years older than him - and warned him that they might not be able to have children. He said he honestly didn't mind. But when she became pregnant within weeks of marrying him, he seemed to share her delight. Then she had a miscarriage. Then she had four more miscarriages. Then she turned to IVF. But her eggs were too old, and her uterus too old to carry the baby to term. Most women, I imagine, would have given up at this point, but she didn't. A friend of hers called Jesse, a country and western singer, offered to donate eggs, and Helen advertised for a surrogate mother to carry the baby. She found a waitress who was willing to do it for $15,000. Thus, with Jay's sperm, her friend's eggs, and her employee's womb, Helen created the twins,  Maisie  and  John Barrett McInerney III . But it was touch and go. The waitress refused to give up smoking, much to Helen's fury, and then developed diabetes and kept going into labour. The twins were eventually born three months prematurely, weighing less than 2lb each, and had to spend 10 weeks in incubators. Helen wrote a gripping account of the whole saga for  American Vogue ."   Wait  ... first she chronicles the "saga" of childbirth to twins in  Vogue , then her facelift? Okay, (takes a breath, munches some popcorn), I just needed to puzzle that out ...  let's continue :  "Jay's role at first was hardly more than sperm donor and bemused spectator. He'd always assumed he would be a father one day, but he was in no hurry. 'I never really cared that much. I just didn't get it until I saw them [the twins] and held them and got to know them.' The twins were born in 1995, the year he turned 40, and lost his own father - it should have marked the end of his long restless adolescence.   "But the next year there was an odd little warning sign that all was not quite perfect in the marriage. Helen had a facelift. She decided to do it, she said, because when Jay came back from interviewing Julia Roberts he remarked, 'I told her all about you. Well, everything but your age.' It was the first sign, to Helen, that the seven-year age gap was a problem - a problem for Jay, she thought. So off she went and had a facelift, and wrote an article, and then a book, about it. Jay said he felt 'a little embarrassed. But I have to say that I've benefited from it. She looks great, as good as she did when I first met her 14 years ago.'   "He once said that what attracted him to Helen was that 'She was so cool, like a guy.' She was the first woman he'd lived with who was not emotionally needy or wounded in some way. 'And,' he now adds, 'who wasn't emotionally unbalanced. Maybe that's one of the reasons why our separation is so amicable. She's not threatening to stab me in my sleep or stab any future girlfriends in my life!'"  So amicable, after the facelift ...  hmmm.  Most curious.  "But  surely  having a facelift and going to all those lengths to have children suggest that she was needy, or at least that she was worried about ageing? 'Well. I never quite understood those decisions. Neither of those decisions were pacts that I was in agreement with. Those were not moments of great concord , so I don't know how to answer for those decisions. Helen is a great eccentric - and I say that affectionately. I don't think anyone else would have had quite that response to that set of problems.'"   Surely.   " Significantly , his next novel,  urlLink Model Behavior , published in 1998, was set again in New York and marked what one critic called 'a return to the shallow end'. He had grown bored with country life, and was spending more and more time in their New York apartment, so eventually Helen moved there with the twins, bought an adjacent apartment (from  Stephen Fry , who seldom used it) and tried to make a family home. Helen said it was fine for him to go out partying till three in the morning, as long as he didn't expect her to accompany him."   The Corsair  audibly gasps, all wrapped up in McInerney's life:   " Inevitably , this soon provoked rumours that Jay was having affairs, though he insists that's not the reason they split up - 'We were having our own problems, all by ourselves.' One basic problem was that Helen wanted to be in Nashville and he wanted to be in New York. Helen had done New York in her twenties and thirties and wanted to get out - 'She didn't feel she needed all the social desperation, I guess.' Whereas he felt he belonged - 'It's my place, you know? It's the only place I've ever felt entirely at home. There's a wonderful fantasy element to life in Tennessee, and it was something I wanted to try but I don't think it was ultimately the life for me.'"   Inevitably.   "They officially separated (in 2000), but Jay says the real crisis was (1999). Of course, he'd been through divorce before, but not when there were children. 'Children change everything,' he sighs. 'That's what makes it essentially really awful - that was what gave us both such trouble and regrets. And the resolution is somewhat melancholy, but at the same time I'm so relieved that there is some resolution, and so is Helen. We both get along much better now - we started as really great friends and that's what we've reverted to, and it seems to work very well.' He visits the children two or three times a month and recently went on holiday with them. The other day he accompanied Helen to a party in Nashville, which he says shocked some of their friends.  Jesse , the biological mother of the twins, is still angry with him. 'She might be a little down on me - one always has to blame somebody - but I think she'll get over that. Because Helen is so incredibly non-judgemental that her friends are coming around now.'"  Damn ...  Jesse's  down on Jay,  The Corsair  writes that on his scorecard, then continues:  "But last year, he says, was 'a terrible, terrible year for me'. What made it so terrible was that he suffered writer's block - something that had never happened to him before and that he thought never would. 'With so much of my life in turmoil, I just couldn't settle in a place where I could concentrate. I couldn't get enough distance when my mind was so consumed by this life crisis, and I was really stuck for a while. I'm very happy that's over.'"  Okay, I'm only going to make one comment before directing you to the Guardian site to read the whole fantastic story  urlLink here , which I went on from at length.  Do I have this correct: The writer's block was the only point in this story that really caused him  angst , the writer's block is that which really fucked up his year, like,  not the girlfriend who was mugged and slashed , or the twins in Tennessee, or the case of the needless facelift, or even Jesse? (when is someone going to care about Jesse?)   Blame it on the Playboy Advisor.

       FashionwireDaily: Amy Spindler's Celebration    urlLink Merle Ginsberg covered the Amy Spindler celebration at The Rainbow Room  for Fashionwire Daily. Check it out  urlLink here for the full story . I'll summarize:    Attending : "Karl Lagerfeld, Graydon Carter,  urlLink Anna Wintour , Patrick McCarthy, Etta Froio, Ed Nardoza, Bridget Foley, Linda Wells, Ingrid Sischy,  urlLink Cathy Horyn , Gerald Marzorati, Martha Nelson, Andy Port, designers  urlLink Donna Karan , Diane von Furstenberg, Helmut Lang, Miguel Adrover, Richard Tyler, Michael Kors,  urlLink Isaac Mizrahi , fashion titans Rosemary Bravo, Marion Greenberg, Ed Filipowski, Lisa Sheik and fashion writers Hal Rubenstein, Billy Norwich,  urlLink André Leon Talley , Lynn Hirschberg and fashion industry luminaries Anne McNally, Brana Wolf, Elizabeth Saltzman, Candy Pratts Price, Kelly Klein, Elizabeth Stewart,  urlLink Barry Diller , Tom Ford,  urlLink Elton John , Suzy Menkes,  urlLink Stella McCartney  and Hollywood heavies like Bryan Lourd, Kevin Huvane and Stephen Huvane"   urlLink Ginsberg  continues: "Some words spoken in Amy’s honor:  " Ingrid Sischy   "We’re celebrating Amy’s total embrace of life, her wildness, and the rays of sunshine that she brought our lives. Amy’s life was a big one."  " Elizabeth Stewart   "Amy always had opinions. She either loved or hated. She loved a good steak, salty things – especially language – maps of the movie star’s homes, the NY Times (she thought the rest of the paper occasionally had some good stuff),  urlLink Krispy Kremes ,  urlLink Da Silvano , and pissing me off. She hated waiting, friendly waiters, long boring speeches, and being sick.”  " Tom Ford   "Amy was tenacious, stubborn, opinionated and brilliant.  urlLink Passion  was the center of her being. She lived life in double time. Her mind was so  urlLink nimble , I had a hard time keeping up with her."  " Diane von Furstenberg   "Did Amy know her journey would be so short? Is that why she read so much, loved so much? We must honor her life every day. We must be strong, intelligent, glamorous, of course. Amy was always inspired. Amy was all about  urlLink courage .”  " Graydon Carter   "She was like a  urlLink Howard Hawkes heroine ."  " Adam Moss   "But she was never intimidating."  Got to  urlLink Fashionweekdaily  for the whole story.

       The White, Black, Gray, and, now, Thin White Album   The Thin White Duke  David Bowie  is allowing fans to "mash up" any two of his songs together for a new contest, according to Reuters. EMI's cease-and-decist order to the hit mash up " The Grey Album " recently made the news. Reuters writes:  "Singer  David Bowie  has invited his fans to mix two of his songs together, extending a hand of friendship to underground bootlegging enthusiasts.   "The rocker, currently touring with his 26th album 'Reality,' has invited his supporters to splice a song from the album with any other track from his back catalog as part of a six-week contest.   "Bowie is on the panel of judges who will pick a winner and runners-up from among a publicly voted shortlist of entrants."

       Minnie Driver Wants A Record Deal   According to  urlLink TeenHollywood.com  (via  urlLink Ananova ),  urlLink Minnie Driver  wants a record deal. The site says:  "The Hollywood actress - who is also a talented singer and songwriter - is desperate to sign a recording contract before her new movie, 'The Phantom of the Opera', hits cinemas.  "She revealed: 'I just want to get a little independent deal. But I have to get my record out before the movie comes out - because otherwise people will think I'm an opera singer!'  "As well as trying to land a record deal, Minnie also presented the  Best Male Video  prize at the  urlLink Flame Worthy Music Awards  in Nashville, Tennessee.  "The 'Good Will Hunting' actress recently performed at the  South By Southwest  music festival in Los Angeles."   urlLink E!Online  said of her performance at the time:  "Actors-turned-singers failed to amaze:  urlLink Julie Delpy's  set of plodding songs dragged on and  urlLink Minnie Driver's  pop-rock never quite got in tune, even though she wore a cowboy hat and everything."  Does  Minnie Driver  have what it takes?  Comment here or  urlLink here .

       CBS 60 Minutes: That Corrupt House of Saud   It is really easy to hate the corrupt  urlLink House of Saud , and all their skanky progeny, raping the oil of their people, resisting principled leadership, lording it over a strategically undereducated and impoverished populace, making the GDP of the country their own little family checkbook.  What's not to hate about the House of Saud ? But  urlLink 60 Minutes  kicks it up a notch.  Apparently Bush is so cozy with them that Barbara, "Bar" Bush, wife of Bush the Elder, allows the skanky Prince Bandar the luxury of smoking in their house at their crib.  urlLink He is the only person allowed to do so :  "'To this day,' the elder George wrote to  urlLink The New Yorker , 'Bandar is the only person besides the President of the United States that Bar lets smoke in our house, although both have to do it in their room with the door closed.'"  Say what you will about the  urlLink House of Saud and their underage prostitutes , they know how to buy a President. The sleazy corrupt bastards could also spell the end of the Bush dynasty if  urlLink Kerry makes them a campaign issue . And he should.   urlLink 60 Minutes reports on Sunday :  "A London-based Saudi dissident says Saudi Arabia framed Britain for bombings in its capital in an effort to pressure the British to stop his group from criticizing the Saudi regime."  "... urlLink The Saudi government  reacted to a series of bombings in Riyadh that began in late 2000 by arresting five Britons, a Belgian and a Canadian, even though expatriates were the apparent target and Muslim fundamentalists the probable perpetrators.   "The Westerners confessed and were convicted of the bombings, they say, after being tortured -- a fact the Saudis deny, but doctors have confirmed. In the confessions, the detainees say they were forced to implicate British diplomats in Saudi Arabia. It was all part of a plot against his group,  urlLink says al-Faghi .   "'They wanted to use those detainees as leverage to twist the British arm in order to force them to kick us out of Britain or do something to silence us,' al-Faghi tells Bradley."   urlLink The harrowing story continues :   "Al-Faghi's group has criticized the  urlLink House of Saud  for years, condemning the repressive kingdom on a radio station beamed into the country that the British allow the organization to operate from the United Kingdom. "  "Saudi Arabia took drastic action because it was frustrated, says al-Faghi. 'We are a political opposition to the Saudi regime and because they've tried all means to harm us, to convince the British that we are doing wrong things, [but] they failed,' he says.   "Britain did not capitulate. A team from Scotland Yard was forced to investigate the diplomats in Riyadh and found no basis for the allegations. The detainees, however, spent several years in captivity, enduring more torture, and for two of them, the promised threat of execution. A personal plea from  Prime Minister Tony Blair  last summer got them pardoned and released - but not exonerated. The Saudi government still considers them guilty.   "This is difficult for Briton Sandy Mitchell, who with his friend, Canadian  urlLink Bill Sampson , spent two-and-a-half years on death row.   "'To my dying day, I will hate myself for this,' says Mitchell, 'because I was ashamed of having to falsely accuse two innocent men and I had to name two British diplomats.'   "Sampson is resigned to the injustice. 'I know the members of [the Saudi] government are hypocrites. I know the members of their government are liars and therefore I do not expect anything better from them than that,' says Sampson.   " urlLink Prince Turki al Faisal , who was head of Saudi intelligence when the men were arrested, twice postponed an interview with 60 Minutes before finally declining to talk to Bradley."  Watch this on 60 Minutes Sunday at 7pm. Now, if you'll excuse me, writing about the House of Saud makes me want to take a shower.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  urlLink Desmond Tutu was  pimping hard  at the Vanity Fair Tribeca Film Festival . Check out the ice grill and hit pause on the  urlLink playa hating  button, 'lil bit,  you better recognize : the archbish is up in the TriBec to see and be seen (as well as  get his crunk juice on  at the  Skyy Vodka  open bar). The arch Bish will bish slap all pretenders and contenders. "Kiss my bling-bling," the bish seems to be saying, nonchalantly, with that angelic countenance, and the sufferage-aristocratic sounding Afrikaner-Soweto lilt, what, with the reddish-Bronze twilight of the stuggle for racial equality shining in the background. No "loser dust" gathers on his fancy threads Tutu is flossing: go archbish,  go archbish !  Graydon Carter  better jump back!   Out : How does one put this? How does one broach a subject so ... so  sensitive ? Tender as the teenage heart. Well, I'll come out with it, and thank you to  urlLink Scott L at Stereogum  for bringing this to my attention.  urlLink Britney Spears has a crack problem .  Who knew?    In :  urlLink Mistreatment of Iraqui soldiers and the attendant Rumsfeld-bashing . prediction: Rummy resigns after setting-up-the-grounds for exit ("I would obviously resign if I didn't feel I could be effective") and  McCain  takes Rummy's place (and, by  Karl Rove's  evil genius, gets taken out of the equation  once and for all  as a powerful Southwest bulwark Veep for Kerry)   Out : Tomb raiders. Not cool. So-not-cool. And yet, it is such an evil Nietzschean-Kissingeresque enterprise ...  Anyhoo :  urlLink Some corpse thieves raided the Toscanini family tomb , desecreating the final resting place of the legendary conductors daughter,  Wanda Toscanini Horowitz . Apparently there truly is no honor among thieves.   urlLink The AP chronicles :  "'It surely wasn't an act of vandalism,' (Police Col.  Marco Rizzo ) said, citing the fact that they didn't leave graffiti. 'There were at least two people involved, maybe a third person. We don't know.   "The break-in happened Thursday night, although it wasn't noticed until the following day. The culprits entered, pulled open a grate to the underground chamber, but ignored Toscanini's coffin.   "Instead, they smashed a marble tombstone covering the coffin of  Wanda Toscanini Horowitz , who died in 1998. They opened the coffin, then left, Rizzo said. He said it was possible the intruders may have been hunting for jewels."  It is deliciously ironic (and how can one not talk about matters concerning  death  without the requisite  irony ?) that  urlLink Scythian tomb robbers, who robbed ancient tombs, were expert at the practice actually, ended up leaving, in their wake, archaeological data of sometimes greater import than the tomb that they themselves had robbed . Okay,  enough with the dark irony , guys, (see what two days sick will get you?)  next :   In : Middle Aged women baring breasts are the new black. Washington DC, home of the  FCC  and their ludicrous tirades against  Howard Stern  as well as all the networks, is, it appears, a place that is  very fixated  on the the proverbial " urlLink dirty pillows ."  urlLink Freud might say something  about being weaned too early and the concurrent effects on psychosexual development.  Who knows, who cares : all we know is, a middle aged lady flashed Ben Affleck at the Bloomberg after party, as he was with Vanessa Kerry. According to  urlLink Ananova, via The Sun :  "A fan flashed her breasts at  Ben Affleck  as he chatted with the daughter of US presidential hopeful  John Kerry .  "Affleck was with medical student  urlLink Vanessa Kerry  at a Washington dinner at the time, reports  The Sun .  "The middle-aged woman showed off her bare chest, exclaiming: 'You are fucking gorgeous.'  "An onlooker said yesterday: 'It wasn't pretty.'"  Did she have a tablemat holder nipple ring, too; or were the naughty bits closer in resemblance to a Ninja star of death, perhaps? DC: it's gritty: it aint pretty.   Out : Louisiana's disproportionate legislative power is going the way of the Dodo bird, so much the better for us. Louisisana is far more conservative than the general consensus in the blue states, yet, alas, for many years they have held a disproportionate amount of political juice. The secret is very southern: blue state congressional seats have a migh higher turnover rate than the sloe gin fizz of the humid and conservative South, where  urlLink plus sa change, plus le meme chose .  urlLink TheHill notes :  "Louisiana’s congressional delegation is going to lose much of the power it has wielded for nearly half a century because retirements and election-year maneuvering mean four of its nine members will be freshmen in January.  "One senator and three members of the state’s seven-member House delegation are retiring at the end of their terms. With the loss of seniority, much of the state’s historically influential delegation may be unable to garner prime committee assignments.   “'There are no two ways about it,' said Rep.  urlLink David Vitter  (R-La.), who is retiring to run for the U.S. Senate. “We will lose seniority in the delegation.”  “We have a tradition of having an effective delegation up here in part because of seniority,” he added.  " ...  urlLink W.J. 'Billy' Tauzin (R-La.),  the most senior member of the state’s delegation, is leaving his seat for health reasons. Tauzin served as chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee and sits on the House Resources and Homeland Security committees. He is serving his 13th term."  No offense to my one southern conservative reader of this blog,  but good fucking riddance to that Cajun bastard . Anyone on Energy and Commerce would be better than that cat. The words Louisiana and power scare me as an African American, they remind me that  urlLink in 1990, 14 years ago, David Duke won 55% of the white vote in his run for Governor , despite the fact that the National Republican party denounced him.    In :  trailer trash : whether on Jerry "(wheezes) Jere ... " Springer, or anywhere else, their lack of shame makes for great shadenfreude, and their desire to be famous -- if only on reruns and at the local dive bar and Dairy Queen -- is a little on the yucky side. But  oh-so-compelling ; I lie to myself often and psychologically justify my fascination by calling it all "my amateur sociological research into Americana."  Whatever.   Those are my hang-ups, I will not hide them from you, because, well, I show them to you, like 5, maybe 6 days a week?   Anyhoo : This man sold his ex-wife's wedding dress on eBay, and, as trailer trash is wont to do in these social situations,  urlLink he couldn't resist the urge to spill the beans on the seedy breakup  of his nuptual bliss in lurid detail. Oh, hey, Mr. trailertrashman, resist ...  resist :  "I found my ex-wife's wedding dress in the attic when I moved.  She took the $4000 engagement ring but left the dress.  I was actually going to have a dress burning party when the divorce became final, but my sister talked me out of it.  She said, 'That’s such a gorgeous dress.  Some lucky girl would be glad to have it. You should sell it on EBay. At least get something back for it.'  So, this is what I’m doing.  I’m selling it hoping to get enough money for maybe a couple of Mariners tickets and some beer.  This dress cost me $1200 that my drunken sot of an ex-father-in-law swore up and down he would pay for but didn’t so I got stuck with the bill.  Luckily I only got stuck with his daughter for 5 years. Thank the Lord we didn't have kids."  Mariners tickets and some beer --  pour l'amour.  (That's about as romantic as  urlLink riunite on ice )   In : Embedded with Grrrls. Our favorite Spin employee,  urlLink Ulragrrrl , shares with us  Andy DePunk's   urlLink observations on dating-in-your-twenties :  "It is bizarre though, that no one in their twenties knows what the hell's going on. Since college, dating's been a lot like my little 6 year old cousin's soccer club. The parents drop off the kids and everyone just kicks the ball around like crazy, bonking heads and skinning knees until they occasionally make an accidental goal. But girls, no matter how savvy they are, seem a hell of a lot more frustrated and confused with us than we are with them. And I guess that was the gist of my previous email.  "I have a female roommate now, which is sort of fascinating. I feel sort of like a journalist embedded with the enemy troops. I'm privy to war room discussions on hot guys who haven't called back, strategic planning sessions on capturing high profile targets, and endless standoffs with pussy boys who flirt with their eyes at bars and don't do anything about it. The whole thing was funny to me at first. Because girls seem to have absolutely no idea what they're doing. But lately I'm feeling more humbled. Maybe the pheromones are getting to me."   Maybe , but this is interesting stuff delivered with a lot of heart and sharpness. Read on  urlLink here .   Out :  urlLink Fashionweekdaily  has an interesting post about "punchy" former New York Magazine editor "sweet"  Caroline Miller  possibly-maybe headed to  urlLink another Primedia property , one jingled about by the late ... mediocre ...  Steve Allen :  " Caroline Miller , who was ousted as editor-in-chief of New York Magazine in favor of  Adam Moss  in February when  Bruce Wasserstein  bought the title from Primedia, has emerged as a strong contender for the top spot at TV Guide. TV Guide editor  Mike Lafavore  was fired on Monday, and Miller has already had a pow-wow with the publishers."   Can you get any more edgy that  TV Guide , what, with those mutiple collectors item covers?  TV Guide is raw like cole slaw.    In : Conservatives value wisdom and the  urlLink Permanent Things , liberals value  urlLink sophistication  and  urlLink Internationalism :  urlLink why can't we combine the two teleological ends ? Both sides have merit: the depth of  urlLink conservative wisdom  and the breadth of  urlLink contingent pragmatism  are two sides to the same coin.  urlLink Dewey  and   urlLink Voegelin , why can't we all just get along ... philosophically?

       Was Andy Kaufman's Death a Hoax?    urlLink The AP reports : " urlLink Andy Kaufman  died of lung cancer on May 16, 1984, but according to legend, the eccentric comedian said if he were faking, he'd resurface 20 years later to the day.   "'So, just in case, a party is being planned by  Bob Zmuda , Kaufman's best friend and partner, at the  House of Blues  in Los Angeles on May 16.    "'Over 100 personal ads will be taken out across the country and abroad, reminding him of his words. Will he show?' Zmuda asked on the Web site for  Comic Relief , a series of shows that raise money for health care for the homeless. Zmuda founded Comic Relief after Kaufman's death.    "VIP tickets to the Andy Kaufman — Dead or Alive? tribute offer 'select seating and celebrity reception (hopefully with Andy).'"   Is this the second coming of  Latke ? Was Andy Kaufman's death a hoax?  Comments? Here or on  urlLink VH1's Best Week Ever blog.

       Are Checkoslovakian Faces "Complex"?    urlLink Fashionweekdaily  has an interesting quote from 70s icon  urlLink Karen Black  regarding her face, a subject which, I, too, I must admit, have pondered with deep consideration:  "It’s very nice because it’s severe and I have naturally curly hair. I’m Checkoslovakian descent and I have a kind of complex face. So, I need very simple things to offset that.  urlLink Tony Basil  told me that. He said just wear very simple things because it’s very complicated from the neck up."  Karen Black's face has always kind of freaked me out, you know, kind of like that kid in the Total Eclipse of the Heart video with the  urlLink glowing green eyes , y'know?  I was born in Uganda, and we are rather  urlLink earnest from the neck up .  Oh, and speaking about Africans, is one of the most imteresting people in the world. Born in the early 1940s, Tété-Michel Kpomassie, travelled from his home village in West Africa to Upernavik in northern Greenland. Why did a young tribesman  urlLink decide to go to such an Arctic environment ? Would I be lose all credibility with you at this point if I were to bring up  urlLink Eternal Recurrence and Deja Vu with respect to how certain people seem driven by forces in their life choices that might have already occurred ? Yeah? Okay, forget I said it.

       Grouphug.us    Grouphug.us  is the most fucked up yet fascinating look into the  urlLink sepia-colored film Noirish David Lynchian heart  that is Americana ... Americana horror,  people . (looks around suspiciously, continues ...) Set up as a sort of confessional, with locked glass doors, we, the spectators confronting the spectacle, are allowed to pull up a front row center seat to watch the freak-of-the-week parade about their naughty bits. Some of it is touching, quite frankly, some of it is raw; some of it is brutal, but  virtually all of it  flouts the basic laws of grammar; here, my little soupbones,  urlLink have yourselves a looksie :  "so i am really really really scared. My girlfriend is going to get sick she says in her mind schizophrenia she says she will kill herself before she gets too bad. but we are suppose to get married and have children. i know she doesn't really want too. she left me alone tonight.. she is sleeping on the futon. I don't smoke pot anymore because when she smokes pot she gets scary and crazy and i just look at her and cry because i am powerless because i love her so much."  (The Corsair pulls out a legal note pad and  urlLink does a Dr. Melfi )  "... sometimes i get really confused and shit is crazy in my head fast and quiet a man and a womens voice. I have been told i feel too much. I cry a lot. I cry over the time that i am missing spending with my parents or i think of times that i am not going to be with my girlfriend i have also been told i have dyslexia probably my dad has it."  ( The Corsair  cocks an eyebrow, slowly puts down the legal pad, and gets into a sprinters position)  "um. i burn my arms. i don't know really why but i do with steam and heated spoons. i put bandaides over them so people can see the bandaides. but i hide the scars."  ( The Corsair  shivers ... and bolts from the room to the accompanyment of  urlLink Asia's Heat of the Moment )   I wonder if there have ever been studies about the statistical percentages of madness in a world empire, and whether or not the pathologies increase over time.

       Krucoff on the Quest 400    urlLink Just who, precisely  are the  Quest 400 ? They are the  Masters of the Universe , my precious little soup bones.  Walk down Fifth and the Upper Eighties on a Saturday Night and you will see the tribe in action. They are  urlLink that tiny group of high society holdovers  that  urlLink parties on the Upper East Side . Sometimes, on Saturday nights, you can see them shuttling off to the benefits -- there: look at the man wearing a cape and sporting a cane, like  Dracula . Now: think of dracula as metaphor.   Anyhoo : No longer do they tend to their rose gardens in Newport, Rhode Island.  urlLink The ladies  have little lap dogs instead of imperial colonies with brown people. The men are straight out of an Auchincloss novel. They sip  Cutty Sark  and cry real tears over the  urlLink appalling state of their old prep schools  (".. and, barmaid, *sob*, the old boys have made Latin an elective!"), or their sail boats. They frequent upscale bordello's after  urlLink Michael's  if they aren't already cheating with the illegal immigrant nanny. And to their  urlLink cucumber-sandwich munching wives , those Rockefeller Republicans with the severe 1970s hair, the many facelifts, and the designer handbags, their dogeared copies of  urlLink Debretts Peerage and Barontage  ("Royalty is the ultimate reality, my dear")  urlLink Cindy Adams  can do no wrong. They make socially inappropriate comments mitigated by the fact that they are rich and don't really give a fuck that you might be offended by.  Sometimes , they say, with the undigested cucumber sloshing about their botoxed lips -- sometimes a good right wing dictator really gets the trains running on time,  Binky .  To be sure.   urlLink Krucoff crunches the numbers , god bless his snarky mathematical soul, and  urlLink Gawker , for doing the math and putting it online. Where precisely did these Masters of the Universe make their fortunes?  urlLink I'm saying .   urlLink The bad way . Media/ Publishing. Captains of Industry. Fashion.  And, surprisingly, one percent actually made it on the A-List through sports. Would I be cynical if I said those sports were more likely the ones with the little balls populated by white players? Yes,  too cynical .   Bravo, Krucoff, bra-fucking-vo.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  Howard Stern  was apparently invited to the National Press Club,  urlLink according to Joe Hagan of The Observer . " ... In Washington, D.C., Mr. Stern has met with relative silence.  "Two weeks ago, the committee that runs the National Press Club in Washington voted down a proposal for  urlLink Mr. Stern  to appear as a guest speaker, according to two sources familiar with the situation."  Your loss, Press Club, that would have been a hell of a speech had he given it.   Out : The  urlLink Smokinggun.com  collects through the Freedom of Information Act some of the funniest letters to the FCC from  Howard Stern  listeners on the double standard of giving  Oprah Winfrey  a free ride. My favorite line, "Tell me, Mr. Powell, how do you explain the concept of a tossed salad to your kids?"   In : The feud between  urlLink Catwoman ,  Julie Newmar  and  Jim Belushi , hero of the dumpy working man. Too Wong Foo,  Julie Newmar : ka-pow!   While, personally, I'd rather devote the space to a dissection of the  urlLink neoconservative hatred of the UN's origins in Security Council Resolution 3379 , and how the disgusting Zionism-equals-racism pronouncement turned Israel forever against the possibility of working with the UN, alas, the thought of Julie Newmar and Jim Belushi mixing it up is too delish. That significant cultural artifact  urlLink The National Enquirer tells writes  that the two C-List neighbors are feuding. "On January 25, Newmar wrote to her local councilwoman,  Cindy Miscikowski , complaining about the fence.  "In her letter, Newmar said, 'I live next door to a neighbor from hell . . .  "'I have called Police, Fire, Building and Safety Departments and other authorities on dozens of his prior law-breaking actions. It is exhausting and expensive.  "'Please help me. I need some peace.'"   In :  Howard Dean  is going to barnstorm the Deep South.  Hmmm  (a moments pause). Bad fucking idea, Keemo Sabe,  let me count the ways . One, you are the poster boy of the Eastern seaboard Democrat. Two, they grow them big and mean and inbred in Mississippi. Three ... But I can't stop Dean, no one can -- he does what he feels is for the good. He's a  urlLink Scorpio , dammit.  urlLink Alexander Bolton of TheHill reports :  "'But whether they like it or not, Dean may be coming to a neighborhood near them.  Dean will announce the specifics of his planned tour through the South within Â&#147;the next couple of weeks,' said an aide.   Â&#147;'He has a number of states in mind,' said  Walker Waugh , DeanÂ&#146;s spokesman. 'HeÂ&#146;s talked about going to Mississippi, and heÂ&#146;s talked about going to Alabama.'  "Dean also has told some Southern Democrats that he plans to travel to Texas and Louisiana as well."  ( The Corsair  shakes his head in disbelief and actual worry for Dean's physical safety)   Out : Prada is, I repeat,  not  going public. Don't believe the hype.  urlLink Our pal Godfrey Deeny of Fashionwire reports :  "Prada has taken the unprecedented step of issuing a public statement denying a report in the Italian press that the firm will seek a public quotation later this year.   "'With regard to the news: in the Italian press, the Prada Group would like to clarify through its spokesman that while it can confirm the strong improvement in its financial figures, there are no plans for a public listing in 2004,' the Italian luxury specialist said in a statement."

He kept handing the mic to some idiots in the front row who were talking about politics and Tony Blair and shit, and Morrissey was really cocky.

       Fuck Michael Eisner: Remember the Alamo   Karma is a bitch, and  Michael Eisner  is finding that out,  the hard way . According to  urlLink Page Six, Mel Gibson  is being touted as a possible successor:  "A consortium of mysterious European investors has approached Gibson about a possible takeover of Disney now that Comcast has thrown in the towel, sources told PAGE SIX. 'We were very impressed with the way Gibson handled The Passion of the Christ, ' one insider said. The group was especially motivated after The Passion, made for $25 million, raked in almost $600 million. 'Gibson has the sensibilities Hollywood needs,' says a source close to the star. 'He has the right insight to lead a studio. Look at those numbers! Now, that is how to make movies - none of this $120 million nonsense.'"  Why not? Look at the leadership of Eisner of late:  urlLink he tanked -- big time -- on Alamo . He has consciously, studiously even, made sure not to  urlLink groom a successor . Eisner has quixotically  urlLink tossed $8 million for Clive Barkers Abarat series  (like money down the toilet, because, of course, kids dig  Clive Barker  stories). And  urlLink his ego singlehandedly fucked up the Pixar relationship.   Last but not least,  urlLink Jim Rutenberg of the Old Gray Lady reports  that The Mouse House is blocking Michael Moore's latest film:  "Disney came under heavy criticism from conservatives last May after the disclosure that Miramax had agreed to finance the film when Icon Productions, Mel Gibson's company, backed out.   "Mr. Moore's agent,  Ari Emanuel , said  Michael D. Eisner , Disney's chief executive, asked him last spring to pull out of the deal with Miramax. Mr. Emanuel said Mr. Eisner expressed particular concern that it would endanger tax breaks Disney receives for its theme park, hotels and other ventures in Florida, where Mr. Bush's brother, Jeb, is governor.  "'Michael Eisner asked me not to sell this movie to Harvey Weinstein; that doesn't mean I listened to him,' Mr. Emanuel said. 'He definitely indicated there were tax incentives he was getting for the Disney corporation and that's why he didn't want me to sell it to Miramax. He didn't want a Disney company involved.'"  One can almost see the pathetic Eisner, manic, like an African dictator about to be ousted, drenched in sweat, trying to cling to power. "Gibson passed on the flic. Now Gibson wants my job.  They all want my job  (looks over his shoulder). I gotta back out. Gotta. And the taxes. I can blow $100 million on Alamo, $8 million on Abarat. but I need those Florida tax breaks ..."  It's over Michael ...  it's over.   Whether they replace you with  urlLink Steve Jobs  or Gibson, it's over, Johnny.

       A Picasso Record?    urlLink Maccers  posted this story about the  Picasso   urlLink rose period painting "Garcon a la Pipe" poised to sell for $100 million . I go back and forth with Picasso.   What kind of a fish is a Picasso? Is Picasso a mighty trout navigating the breakers of the wine dark-sea of Art, or is he a minnow riding on the backs of more original Old Masters ("I collect Old Masters and Young Mistresses" --Nabokov, Ada).  Some days, when I look back at his blue period, suffused with carbolic and icy blues and haunting lunar  urlLink El Greco lighting  that fairly crackles and vibrates, I think: Goddamn,  utter and complete genius . Picasso is the sum total of all that came before him.   And then , almost as often, the more and more one looks at his work, the more one sees how much he  outright copied from other artists . He was an incredible thief.  urlLink He stole so well  and hid the booty in his own works, that his victims, the melancholy Spanish guitar of  Juan Gris  with the amber patina, the dispassionate dance hall gaze of  Toulouse-Lautrec ,  Leger ,  Goya ,  Velasquez ,  Braques ,  El Greco , the unnamed West African mask makers, the Greek potters, have all become, in the fullness of time, his inferiors in the art world, subsumed to Picasso's superior plundering.  His artistic borrowings were legendary -- he was a proto-postmodernist, in a way.  Does Picasso disappear in the absence of greater artistic lights; is Picasso like the moon, which shines only from the borrowed glory of the suns rays?  His line is confident, certainly (he could paint before he could talk), but is it worth 100 mil?   urlLink the anxiety of influence is particularly heavy with Picasso . Sometimes I even wonder just how original or even if Picasso was very original. The more I learn about art, the more pictures I catalogue in my mind, the more I see that a particularly clever idea, a witty or disturbing character, or use of color, in his paintings --  was borrowed.  And, like an onion unraveling, one wonders, underneath it all is there anything of substance? Or is it all just smoke and mirrors and protective layering?  Perhaps he is not a fish at all, but the screaming, disruptive  urlLink bull of Guernica  slowly evolving into the  urlLink priapic Minotaur  as the 20th century unfolds, leaving weeping women in his wake, instead of  urlLink bombed out Spanish villages .  The Modernists are strange that way. Their break with ancient and classical forms moves them closer to clever statements, or disposable pronouncements, rather than all-inclusive world philosophies. Compare  urlLink Magritte  to  urlLink Velasquez , or  urlLink Koons  to  urlLink Titian .  On matters of art (and  urlLink education politics ) I am quite conservative, and on everything else, an unashamed liberal. Then again, the moderns may have a point that art is better served as wit and disposable pronouncement if, indeed, there is no meaning to human existence. A conservative take on art is an anti-Nietzchean view that there are absolutes -- love, God, Buddha, the culture (Greekness, Maya, Nilotic)  whatever.  The Nietzcheans are all about pushing-the-limits. God is dead, has been for quite some time, really, so the  form of Christ  is not so much in the renaissance of debate, but form itself, say, in synthetic cubism, or the startlingly beautiful, if lifeless geometric compositions of Mondrian.  Whatever the case, the painting is clearly interesting:  "Charles Moffet, co-director of Impressionist and modern art at Sotheby's, said: 'It has a haunting ambiguity that has ensured its status as one of Picasso's most celebrated images of adolescent beauty.   "'It is, without question, one of the most beautiful of the artist's Rose Period paintings and one of the most important early works by  Pablo Picasso .'"   " John Whitney , a former US ambassador to Britain, bought the painting in 1950 for $30,000.   " ... It is being sold by the Greentree Foundation, a philanthropic body founded by Mr Whitney's wife, Betsey, following the death of her husband in 1982."    If  Byron  was the first rock star, Picasso was the first international celebrity -- Madonna with talent. Is it worth $100 million? Fuck no. Give me a  urlLink mysterious  labyrinthine  urlLink Mannerist  any  urlLink day of the week .   Now, back to gossip ("toss me in the shallow water before I get too ...")

       Scarlett Johansson to Louis Vuitton   According to  urlLink Fashionweekdaily ,  Scarlett Johnansson  is to be the new face for  Louis Vuitton :  "Two weeks ago,  urlLink The Daily  reported  Scarlett Johansson  had been tapped as one of the new faces of  Louis Vuitton’s  fall advertising campaign, photographed by  urlLink Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott . Now The Daily has learned from an inside source that the 19-year-old Johansson will allegedly be paid $5.33 million to pose for the LVMH-owned luxury goods and clothing house, with the first images scheduled for August magazines.  When reached for comment, a Louis Vuitton representative said the company could not confirm Johansson’s business matters. 'We expect to make an announcement by the end of next week,' the rep said. 'But I can’t comment now because the nature of celebrities can be very fickle.' A Vuitton insider commented that Johansson was picked after company executives wanted a younger name post-Jennifer Lopez. 'She’s young with classic look that hints at a bygone era,' the source said."  As opposed to JLo?  ouch.    Isabella Rossellini  had recent problems with age and fashion, says  urlLink British vogue , "the raven-haired daughter of  Ingrid Bergman , who has complained that she was ousted as the face of  Lancome  in 1994 because she was too old, laughs at the idea that she could ever turn back. 'I'm 52,' she told  Women's Wear Daily . 'I don't think cosmetic companies have plans to come back to me. I'm available.'"  And  urlLink Page Six noted yesterday  that 60 year old former covergirl  Lauren Hutton  is enjoying life, and still looking grand, at 60, "Only a few years after a serious motorcycle accident, the seminal supermodel just returned from a month-long trip to Africa (her 28th visit) that included cliff-diving near Zanzibar and a safari in the Serengeti, where she tracked game on foot and shocked her guide by picking up a 6-foot boa constrictor."

       Jim Jamusch: "I Love Ghostface;" PLUS: RZA and His Colloidal Silver   From  urlLink Filmmaker, Spring 2004 :   Filmmaker : What about the  urlLink Bill Murray  piece (in  urlLink Coffee and Cigarettes ) -- how did that come about, the idea of him playing an actor on the lam as a waiter?   urlLink Jim Jarmusch : Oh, man, I don't know, because I wrote that one literally the day night before. I wanted to have  urlLink RZA ,  urlLink GZA  and  urlLink Ghostface Killa  from the  Wu Tang . I love Ghostface and I thought he'd be a great actor to play with. And then I found out that Ghost was in Miami but GZA and RZA were definitely coming. So I called Bill and he's like, 'Jim, how long will this take?" 'One day.' 'Well, can we do it in half a day?' 'I'll try.' 'Oh, you'll try ... just tell me where to be, when to be there and what to wear.' Now, you can't give Bill's number to anyone on the crew -- his agent doesn't even have it. (On the day of the shoot) Bill walks right in, parked his own car and was there for the whole day, took RZA and GZA out to a Japanese restaurant for lunch. But I wrote that script real fast, and they followed it to a large degree. The thing about RZA being a doctor was a real funny thing.   Filmmaker : It was real?   Jarmusch : Yeah, one night I was with RZA in the studio and he gets a call from the wife of our friend  urlLink Sifu Wahnam , the Shaolin Master. RZA is the god father of his kids. The kids are sick, its like 1:00 in the morning, and we go to their place. (Sifu's) wife Sophia's all freaked out -- one kid has a fever, one's sweating. And RZA's like, 'Okay, here's what you do, man. You take them  urlLink off the dairy , you take them off the citrus,  you give them this mineral , you give them one aspirin each -- no more!-- one aspirin each and you call me in the morning.' We're leaving and I said, 'What the fuck, are you a doctor now or what?' And he's like, 'Hell ya! You know, I started reading that shit, I've been reading alternative medicine for three years. So I put that in the script ...  Okay, how much do you want to bet that that mineral is  urlLink RZA and his crazy obsession with colloidal silver . I swear to god,  urlLink RZA is going to turn half the population blue with this fixation !

       Mean Girls: Tina Fey vs. Last Call Girls    Girls are mean. And  urlLink Tina Fey should know .  urlLink According to Star Magazine , there is a catfight going on at NBC. Tina gives NBC's lowgrade fare Last Call the icy grill:  "There seems to be a pissing contest at NBC -- literally -- between the female staffers at the show,  Last Call with Carson Daly  and the ladies at  Saturday Night Live .  Tina Fey , SNL's head writer and Weekend Update co-anchor, and the writer and co-star of the film Mean Girls, told  Carson Daly  on April 21 that the women at SNL have a problem sharing the bathrooms on 17th floor of New York City's famous Rockefeller Center with the Last Call women. The reason? The SNL ladies believe Carson's female employees urinate on the toilet seats!"  ( The Corsair  softly chuckles)  "Word leaked out the next day that the  urlLink Last Call  girls were upset by Fey's remarks so someone from SNL put up a sign in the ladies room that read,  urlLink 'Tina says : If you sprinkle when you tinkle, please be neat and wipe the seat.' "  Questions:  1) Who knew Last Call was still on the air 2) Who leaked (excuse the pun) this information to the Star? 3) I just watched the SNL Tivo from last week, and isn't  urlLink Amy Poehler's Avril Lavigne  hysterical?  Anyhoo: check out  urlLink Star  for this story and other gossip.

       Black Eyed Peasy: A VERY SPECIAL CORSAIR   According to that significant cultural artifact  urlLink The National Enquirer ,  Ashton Kutscher  tried to punk the band  urlLink The Blackeyed Peas  and he himself ... was  urlLink Punk'd .   urlLink The Enquirer says :  "The practical joke started innocently enough with the Peas being invited to a party at a Hollywood Hills mansion.  "But when group members, with the offbeat names  will.i.am ,  apl.de.ap  and  Taboo , arrived they saw couples retiring to bedrooms in the mansion.  "Just as the 'Punk'd' pranksters planned, the Peas and their entourage found themselves in the middle of a brothel party with high-priced call girls.  ( The Corsair  grabs a handful of salt-free popcorn, and becomes riveted to the screen)  "'Band member  will.i.am  was an accomplice in the prank,' said an eyewitness. 'But the rest of the band and their entourage became suspicious.'  "Just then a team of seven phony vice cops rushed in from all directions. Some of the band members tried to explain it was a big misunderstanding, but the Peas' pleas fell on deaf ears."  ( The Corsair  makes an inaudible whistle)  " ... And then all hell broke lose."  ( The Corsair  jumps up and down shouting: 'It's on like  urlLink Gray Poupon! ')  ""When one of the cops acted like he was going to slap the cuffs on will.i.am, one of his friends punched a cop in the jaw, which sent him flying backwards and into the pool," said the eyewitness.  "Then, the guy tackled another one of the prop-cops and they both went tumbling into the pool!"  "The 'Punk'd' crew members hurriedly tried to explain that it was just a joke -- but nobody was laughing.  "Usually at this point Ashton comes out of hiding and lets the celebrity in on the prank, but a spokesman said the actor was away on location for a movie.  "It's just as well. The Black Eyed Peas quickly left because tensions were so high, said the eyewitness.  "'If they had stayed, it probably would have led to a full-fledged brawl between the band and the Punk'd crew.'"    The Corsair  is 'away on location for a shoot.'

We at  The Corsair  love to read our friend DP Columbia's NY Diary, but we wish our friend would do more non-Upper East Side events.)   Out :  urlLink Senator Al Franken?  (link via  urlLink Wonkette ) Sure, he's arrogant and geeky, but could he be the next Senator from the state of Minnesota? According to the  USA Today :  "'I've thought about it and discussed it with my family more,' Franken told  The Associated Press  Saturday, before attending the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner here. The only holdout, he said, is his 19-year-old son Joe, who is worried he'll see less of his father.  "Franken, over a bite at a Thai restaurant (he ordered tom yum goong soup with shrimp and seafood salad), also said he's happy with the direction of his new radio show,  urlLink 'The O'Franken Factor,'  despite unenthusiastic early reviews."  Well, if I may shed the fedora natural to a snarky blogger covering the LA-NY-DC power circuit for a moment, and only a moment, and don the Darth Vaderesque mantle of seedy political wonk-advisor, Al: lose the yum goong soup.  Fast . You are running in Minnesota against  urlLink Senator Norm Coleman : Mr. Apple fucking pie Americana.

Now,  urlLink that's Minnesota cuisine at it's most inedible .  Thems good eats . Stick to the mild humor, Al, leave the heavy lifting to the professionals.   In :  The Indian fashion industry . Mark my words, my crystal ball is clear:  2004 will be the year of India . Indian culture is hott. Bollywood rocks. And their curry-hott fashion market is about to blow up:  " Raghavendra Rathore , the designer from the royal family of Jodhpur in the desert state of Rajasthan, known for its vibrant colors and rich embellishments, said every designer was trying to work out that perfect combination of inspirational designs, financial management and marketing savvy.  "'The bubble is about to burst and one or two of the designers will really make it. Very soon you will see,' said Rathore.  "Fashion experts and industry insiders say it is only a matter of time before one of the top 50 makes that elusive breakthrough and becomes an international style icon.  "'People are dying, itching to see that one perfect combination,' Rathore told Reuters on the sidelines of Fashion Week on Wednesday. 'It's a matter of time, stars and the moon to align themselves when the time is right.'

Blame it on the dodgy horse hormaone to human hormone ratio in Shwarzenegger's blodstream, but this lawsuit is only going to fly back in his face. As  urlLink the cats at theSmokingGun explain :  "The Schwarzenegger doll, which went on sale about a month ago, is one of several bobbleheads featuring politicians that the Ohio firm sells ( John Kerry ,  Wesley Clark , and  Howard Dean  also retail for $19.99, while  George W. Bush  would only set you back $14.95). The bobblehead company contends that since Schwarzenegger is now an elected official, his image is public domain."  But try to explain that to Arnie, who is campaigning so hard for the Republican nomination in 2008, what, with trips to Jordan, Israel and Germany, that he is neglecting that  self-deprocating humor element  of his political persona. It's a crucial part of any politician, Arnie.  Shheeessh . Nazi-kids have no sense of humor.   Out :  urlLink Tanorexic Teens . According to the LA.com blog, "Sun-kissed California teens may have to catch their rays all natural if lawmaker Joe Nation (D-San Rafael) gets his way.

Just sit back, and let the Musto weave the tale:  "Granted a moment to interrogate—rather than lick—Jessica, I asked her if she's become any more sophisticated lately, but she didn't seem to get the question. I repeated it, and sweet Jessica laughed and replied, 'That's not a good word to describe me. Classy, but I don't know about sophisticated.' 'Baby, you're the most sophisticated," smirked Lachey, oozing that patented male-hustler-esque chic I naturally adore. (He's the smart one in the household, the way Janet's the normal Jackson. Kidding. I love them all!)  "'Your favorite book?' I posited, but Jessica didn't hear the question. I repeated it, adding, 'Mine's Cosmo Girl.' She laughed—not that dumb—and said, 'My favorites are romance novels. I'm definitely a girlie girl. Anything that'll make me cry.' (Bergdorf Blondes does it for me. So moving.) And finally, considering that Jess is a part owner of Dessert Beauty, is this kind of expansion really necessary? Does she really need the moola? She got the question. 'Sure, why not!' baby Jessica exclaimed, without pause. Repeat: not dumb at all!  Only  Michael Musto  would have the guts to ask Jessica Simpson her favorite book.  So best.

       Felix Dennis: Poet? Naaaah    Maxim Magazine  founder and vole-like mogul  Felix Dennis  really wants to be a poet,  urlLink or so he hints to the Wall Street Journal today .   Oh,  The Corsair  loves rich eccentrics, like  Sargent Shriver  and Felix the scat ... we could go so many ways with this little chestnut.   urlLink WSJ's Matthew Rose writes :  "'It would be nice if  Mr. Letterman  or  Oprah  gave me two minutes,' Mr. Dennis says. 'I'd blow their bloody socks off.'  "Mr. Dennis has let his hair grow long and shaggy since he started writing seriously in late 2000. He has completed 650 poems, at last count, in the four hours a day he devotes to them. Every few weeks, he sends what he calls a 'wodge' of poems to his editor and to a lawyer friend, who stands in for the kind of ordinary reader Mr. Dennis seeks. Mr. Dennis then joins the other two in grading his poems. Those that get three As make the cut. Cs are discarded. Anything in between goes up for discussion or revision.  "Mr. Dennis says in the next few years he's considering selling Dennis Publishing, owner of the highly successful Maxim, an irreverent men's magazine. He would like to concentrate on poetry and other interests ..."  " ... A poet named  Michael Horovitz  (during a reading by Dennis) jumped up and protested that it was 'so wrong and so unfair,' Mr. Dennis recalls. Mr. Horovitz says he didn't use those exact words, but he has little admiration for Mr. Dennis's style: 'He has this maddeningly reactionary and Philistine concern about rhyming, which is why Felix, until he gets over it, won't become a true poet.' He adds that people only bought the book out of 'sheer gracefulness' in return for free wine."  Wine ... or  whine.  Mr. Dennis is like any other good British boy who wants deeply and perversely to be  urlLink Lord Byron . The Corsair believes that the whole  Rolling Stones/ Beatles  thingie began with Lord Byron, rock stars are just pale imitations. But the sun has set on the British Empire, although  they have  colonized the language -- why not make the most of it, my little soupbones, goes the thinking.   Alas, " Mr. Dennis ," while living like an imperial viceroy on Mustique, doesn't know that the category of poet is, in fact, dead. Rigor mortis has set in. No one gives a flying fuck about the poets anymore. And poets, as a social class, are on the rungs somewhere between  subway motormen  and  squeegee handlers  on the great social ladder of Being.   Finally , Dennis lacks the exotic bohemian style, the  savoir faire , of Lord Byron,  urlLink Don Juan ; rather, Dennis strikes us as Falstaff without the wit and minus the drinking stamina. The Corsair managed (wink, wink) to get a few stanzas of Dennis'  floetry , his low grade godawful doggerel.  Check it:  " Epistle to Celebrity Skin   " urlLink Halle Berry's  got a lotta class/ Fills out a swimsuit with her tits and ass/ She took the Motion Picture Academy to the Cleaners/ Plus she stirs my Oscar ... Meyer Weiner"  Also:  " urlLink Lara  ( urlLink Flynn Boyle )  "How does one adequately describe in verse/ Without appearing too perverse/ I'll set aside my pint of Bass/ And describe the  urlLink bony curvature of her ass ."  But, that's not all ... Finally:  " Gina Gershon   " urlLink Gina, Gina , Burning Bright/ In the forest of the night/ Should a pizza suddenly appear/ Which slice would go best with beer?"  I'll refrain from reading  urlLink Rhyme of the Ancient Pamela .  Big kudos to  urlLink TMFTML , who also tear Felix a new hole.

       White House Correspondents Dinner: Famous-For-DC   We are the world's last superpower. America, the great. We sit astride the globe like a mighty colossus. So, what went on at the  WHCD Bloomberg After Party ?   urlLink Wonkette ,  urlLink Mrs. Cox  (2nd story on OldHag), who was  urlLink charming on Howie Kurtz , leads us off:  "Line is not quite around the block.  urlLink Jeff Bezos  is behind us. Franken about five places behind us, swaying just slightly. Much discussion on whether or not IDs are being checked and whether or not everyone is being forced to stand in line or just those of us who may be famous-for-DC but who are not legitimately famous. Question answered:  -  urlLink Olsen twins  are swept by. -  urlLink Chris Matthews  goes right on in. -  urlLink Joe Scarborough , talking to Marines, follows. -  Bezos  takes this as his cue.  -  urlLink John Podhoretz  next, eliciting memorable exchange:    urlLink Franken : 'I'm telling Page Six!'   Podhoretz : 'I am  Page Six !' Franken: 'You can't handle Page Six!' Franken proclaims his intention to get to the bottom of this. Marches forward. Returns, announces, 'They told me I could get in, but I'm gonna wait in line with you!'  "Truly, a man of the people."   urlLink Jon Fine of AdAge tells us :  "The crowd of well-wishers demanding snapshots with Internet gossip-and-links purveyor  Matt Drudge  -- outfitted for the occasion in a simple white hat he bragged cost $3.99 -- was substantially larger than those demanding snapshots with entertainer  Wayne Newton . (Those convinced that  Donald Trump  has the most terrifying hair in the world would do well to avoid the improbable and elaborate structure that crowns Mr. Newton's skull.)"  "...  urlLink Newsweek columnist Howard Fineman  end-running an entire receiving line to enter Newsweek's pre-dinner reception -- an egregious offense of party etiquette ameliorated slightly by the fact he had  urlLink Meg Ryan  on one arm."   Next, we have  urlLink Hank Steuver of the Washington Post :  "Nix the moment where  urlLink Henry Kissinger , older than ever, declines, with actual horror in his voice, the opportunity to speak to  Lyndon LaRouche . (Who, it happens, told us: 'Keep out of mischief, unless you enjoy it.' Oh, that lovable LaRouche.)"  "But  urlLink Ben Affleck  looked exactly like  urlLink Ben Affleck , and his draw was understandably magnetic. He was large-headed, and available, out on the crowded smoking yard in back, surrounded by all these young Republican women (he told one of them he thinks Republican girls are better looking than the rest, and she told us, and we tell you).  urlLink Vanessa Kerry , daughter of, took his cigarette out of his hand and threw it on the ground, as a health admonition. Later Affleck got involved in a heated debate about the estate tax."   urlLink Danna Harman of the Christian Science Monitor :  " Serena Williams , awesome enough in her tennis clothes, was in an even more eye-catching emerald number."  And, finally  urlLink Elizabeth Bumiller of the NY Times :  "'It's become like everything else,' said  urlLink Christopher Buckley , the comic novelist and a former speechwriter for Mr. Bush's father. 'It's become the Super Bowl.'"  Basta!

       NYTimes to Spurlock: You Want Liver Failure With That?   It is rare that the staid New York Times Arts and Leisure section makes The Corsair spit out his Kenyan blend coffee, but  urlLink Susan Dominus did , in her interview with Morgan Spurlock of the eagerly anticipated fast-food bashing film  urlLink Super Size Me.  Sure, Emily Nussbaum's lovingly rendered 70s tv nostalgia moves me; but Dominus downright floored me.  After about 30 days of McDonalds:  " DOMINUS : Did you start to smell bad?  " SPURLOCK : Oh, man. I was deliberately not exercising any more than the average American, but I did let myself go to the sauna, to kind of sweat some stuff out of me. And when I came out of the sauna, some guy was like, man, somebody or something smells like cheeseburger in here. I could only assume it was me.  " DOMINUS : I think that's a safe assumption."

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In : Kaballah gibberish tatoos. In her rush to emulate the Material Girl (who, apparently, is no longer materialistic)  Britney Spears  made a boo-boo,  urlLink according to the 3 AM girls :  "The 22-year-old has had a series of Hebrew symbols etched into the back of her neck in an act of devotion to Kabbalah, the mystical form of Judaism she was introduced to by Madonna.  "But unfortunately for her they are absolute gibberish.  "Says a source: 'She had hoped it would say new year or new era. It seems she's got the words the wrong way round."  Oops she did it again (we couldn't resist).   Out : Fashionweekdaily reports that Plum Sykes may, finally, have found her plum pudding, I mean, prince charming:  "Has  urlLink Plum Sykes, 34 , finally found her prince? Sources close to the  Bergdorf Blondes  author tell us she may be getting engaged soon to erstwhile  urlLink Internet entrepreneur Toby Rowland . The 35-ish Rowland is the son of the late Tiny Rowland, a British press baron who owned Britain’s  The Observer  newspaper at one point. Toby, who was engaged once before, to an American, started an Internet company at the height of the dot com boom, but his company went down when the bubble burst; before that he worked for Disney."   Not the freshest  catch, Plum, darling: Rowland was head of  urlLink something called Clickmango , an online health site that went bust ... can the air of impatient superiority that surrounds you support such an association?   In : Art wars. Who wins?  Us!   urlLink Those crafty Page Sixers report  that  urlLink Sotheby's  and  urlLink Christy's  are going all out this week:  "Both are holding their major Impressionist, Modern and Contemporary art sales. On the block is between $400 million and $500 million worth of art. Each auction house has gambled millions of dollars guaranteeing owners minimum prices, whether their artworks sell or not. The excitement starts tomorrow with Christie's Impressionist and Modern art sale featuring, among others,  urlLink Modigliani ,  urlLink Monet ,  urlLink Chagall  and  urlLink Picasso ."  Seriously, though, if any of you want to hook me up with  urlLink George Braques Bouteille et Verre  ( a steal, BTW, at $1.2 million to $1.6 million), I wouldn't have a problem.   Out : Teenage Exhibitionism.  urlLink Daphne Merkin in today's New York Magazine  brings us up to scoop on what the private school kids are doing (Is there a NY Mag private school beat?). And, as far as I am concerned, it makes  urlLink my old UN School  spitball embarassment moments look fucking miniscule in comparison:  "In the latest instance of a teenager attempting to convey her hotness factor, a  urlLink Horace Mann  eighth-grader used a digital camera to tape herself masturbating and simulating oral sex, then e-mailed the gawkily explicit video—which resembles an audition for a pedophiliac porn film—to a male classmate she had a crush on. The boy in question chivalrously rushed the three-minute clip onto the Web, and its contents quickly made the private-school circuit."  Damn.  Kids are cruel .   In :  Guy Ritchie ; Lourdes: Language Maven: Einstein. According to the Austrian Magazine  Woman , via Ananova, Madge says of her husband:  "'My  urlLink husband was always a scientific type and a total Darwinist  when I met him. He was never interested in spiritual things like God and the Bible. But Kabbalah is based on scientific facts and that captured his analytical mind.  "'My daughter also attends her own spiritual course every Saturday where she learns about sharing and the power of her words. It's changed her a lot - she doesn't overreact as much anymore,' she said."  So your baby is a sorceress and your hubby is a mad genius. Gee, the Kaballa has really made Madonna down to earth.   Out : Sofia and Quentin are officially an item. A  urlLink gawker stalker  breaks it all down for us.  urlLink Check it out , apparently, "They like each other quite a bit, actually. It's all been rather peasy."   In : Russia. All that corrupt cash floating around, not to mention the spikey hair, the gel, the loose women -- get me a flight. According to  urlLink Nick Charles of Fashionwiredaily , "No wonder Vanity Fair-y  George Wayne  has not returned from a jaunt to Russia. According to Lotus co-owner and party poohbah Mark Baker, Moscow is the place to be these days, and a Moscow branch of  Lotus  isn’t far off. Apparently the city is crawling with newly-minted billionaires who love anything that smacks of American-style glamour, and Moscow fashion week has become a must. Baker is also helping Russian aristo-model  Natalia Vodianova  channel some of the cash to a good cause and establish a children’s foundation with a  Calvin Klein  fashion show planned for the Moscow launch. As for George, he is still 'missing' somewhere on the Volga. After persistent reports of perk fests in the name of Vanity, is there a home to come back to?"   The Corsair  prediction: Wayne will return in a few weeks with a harrowing story of partying with ukranian cossak crime lords and Moldavian slave-boytoys. All in time for the VF's next issue: That crezzy  GW .   Out : Writers and envy.  urlLink Carl Swanson on Elvis Mitchell in NY Mag :  "'Elvis has this sort of Candide-like air about him,' says Outside executive editor Jay Stowe, who edited Mitchell at Spin (yes, he worked there, too). It’s not naïveté, exactly, but an aura of doing what he wants and seeming surprised, in all innocence, when people take offense."  Offense or envy?

       Sargent Shriver: Keeping It Gully    urlLink WWD keeps us up to date on America's semi-Royals ,  The Shrivers  (Quickly: let's do the math on this one -- Spensors:Windsors:: Shrivers: Kennedy's):  " The Shriver clan  —  urlLink Eunice Kennedy Shriver  and her husband  urlLink Sargent 'Sarge' Shriver ,  Timothy ,  Bobby ,  Anthony  and  urlLink First Lady of California Maria , descended on  urlLink Giorgio Armani’s Rodeo Drive  boutique Thursday night for a party hosted by  Details  and Olympic gold medalist  urlLink Carl Lewis  to benefit Special Olympics, founded by Mrs. Kennedy Shriver in 1968. While the entire retinue wore neutral-hued Armani, it was Sarge who caused the biggest fashion frisson in an Old Guard navy blazer and buttercup yellow trousers paired not with the standard loafers, but black and gold Reebok trainers. 'Am I hip? I don’t know,' he growled, 'but have you ever seen an 89-year-old man do this?' he asked as he lifted his leg to a 45-degree angle, leaned over and bent his knee to better examine his shoes. 'Oh, he is the most fashionable one of us,' joked his wife. 'Don’t let him fool you.'  ( The Corsair  lifts his leg to a 90-degree angle, leans over and bends his knee to better lift a bottle of  urlLink Cutty Sark )    Anyhoo : Sure, Sarge,  urlLink Dick Cheney would pass out  if he tried that: you are the  urlLink healthiest Vice Presidential also-ran in history ; but Sarge, you're not tha only old man with some serious athletic game:  Jack Palance , 84, that gravelly-voiced creepy Silver Age star,  a full three years your senior ,  urlLink does push ups in public .    You better recognize!    Frankly , though, my favorite  Sargent Shriver  story is  urlLink told by Sam Stossel here in The Atlantic, April 9, 2004 :  "A campaign-trail legend from 1972 places  Sargent Shriver , the dashing Democratic candidate for the vice presidency and the former director of the Peace Corps and the War on Poverty, in Youngstown, Ohio, chatting up voters in a working-class tavern. Shriver is his usual genial self, and seems to be connecting with the assembled steelworkers, who will form part of a vital voting bloc in the general election. As the merrymakers call for another round, people shout out the names of their favorite beers. Not to be outdone, Shriver eagerly joins the chorus:  urlLink 'Make mine a Courvoisier! ' For Congressman  Tip O'Neill , who had been traveling with Shriver, this faux pas was the last straw. 'That's it,' said O'Neill, stepping away from the bar. 'I'm getting back on the plane and going back to Boston. There's no hope here.' (Indeed, there wasn't.  Richard Nixon  was reelected in a landslide that November.)"  Oh, yeah,  urlLink Tip, like a man named after a drink gratuity  is unfamiliar with  the 'voisier.  (averted gaze).  Rest in Pickled, Tip

       John Simon: P Diddy Has Presence ... Alacrity   We are in " urlLink the last days ," people; the last days. Strange things are happening. Jesus is right around the corner.  urlLink Will you be Left Behind ?  John Kerry's  presidential campaign is  urlLink shaping up to be the biggest natural disaster  since  Al Gore .  George Bush's   urlLink base is starting to abandon him . Now,  urlLink John Simon, the ultrasnarky New York Magazine theater critic , has some, sort of,  urlLink nice things, to say about P Diddy's performance in Raisin in the Sun :  "Under Kenny Leon’s meat-and-potatoes direction, all the principals in Raisin— Phylicia Rashad ,  Audra McDonald ,  Sanaa Lathan , and young  Alexander Mitchell —do admirably. As for  urlLink Sean Combs as Walter Lee , his eyes widen a bit too readily, his limbs are so loose as to threaten flying apart, and his face is curiously babyish. Still, he has genuine presence, and his emoting, except in a moment of utmost dejection, has alacrity—no diddling or puffery—and shows potential, if not quite yet heart."  Genuine presence .. alacrity ... boyishness ... no diddling or puffery?   On the subject of snark,  urlLink Bob Hoover of the Pittsburg Post Gazette wrote on Simon :  " John Simon's  dismissal in  The Times  of Norman Mailer's 1991 'Harlot's Ghost' came close.   "Confronted with that 1,300-page 'widow-maker,' Simon summed up Mailer as 'a punch-drunk writer trying to outbox all competition, real or imaginary.'"   urlLink The Hindu of India  (no, that was not a typo) summed it up:  "But the review that really got Mailer's goat, perhaps because it appeared in the one publication that matters most to American writers, was that of John Simon in the New York Times Book Review.   "Simon, better known as a theatre critic, found Harlot's Ghost an 'arbitrary, lopsided, lumpy novel that outstays its welcome'. Mailer's 'hang-ups are too naked, puerile, perverse", wrote Simon, adding that "what he lacks is (a good) editor'. Worse has been written by reviewers — and some of Simon's 2,500-word critique was even complimentary — but Mailer blew a gasket. He stormed into the offices of the New York Times, demanding — and obtaining — a meeting with the Managing Editor of the paper and the editor of the Book Review section. Simon, he alleged, was biased against him: Mailer had apparently described Simon years ago as being 'as predictable in his critical reactions as a headwaiter.'"  A  kinder, gentler  John Simon? Naaaaaahh.

       Sopranos: Does Adriana Get Whacked?   We are down to the last three episodes of  urlLink The Sopranos , and  Drea de Matteo  is all set to play  Matt Leblanc's  sister in the NBC  Friends  spinoff, "Joey." So, does that mean  urlLink Adriana  is about to get whacked? Or does she go  40,000 Leagues  in Witness Protection? Somethings gotta give,  fuggedaboudit .   One ,  comare , Adriana has been a snitch for the Feds, using that hookup to get rid of rivals on  The Soprano  food chain. There's no way  David Chase , the consigliere, is going to tease this out beyond the last episode this season: it screams  resolution,  like a (makes Italian hand gesture)  Chiacchierone .   Two , FBI agents planted listening devices in Adriana's nightclub, particularly in the back office where Tony meets with other gangsters. ( The Corsair  munches on a plate of Gabagool) Were Tony to find said devices, or someone else, Adriana might be fingered. And, should Tony suspect that their semi-romantic moment might have been a ruse to set him up, Tony would come heavy, react with furious anger, commit a  Message Job . Either way, if Johnny Saks hears ot it, he will force Tony to show that he is  still in control .   Col tempo la foglia di gelso diventa seta.    Three , Adriana, in the last episode, ( The Corsair  munches Sfogliatelle) asked Christopher very earnestly to move, perhaps to California, to pursue screenwriting ( The Corsair  makes elaborate hand gesture). He replied that he was "a soldier." But by the end of the episode, after an  urlLink argument with Tony S. and Tony B . Maybe Christopher doesn't have the iron constitution to be a soldier. Maybe he has the heart of an artist, a screenwriter, an FBI Informant?   urlLink Fox Columnist Roger Friedman notes , "Sources insist that De Matteo's work on 'Joey' will not conflict with 'The Sopranos,' which is filmed at various locations in New York and New Jersey. 'She is contracted for a sixth season' of 'The Sopranos,' an HBO source said."   Whatever.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  urlLink A goddamn Kerry-McCain ticket ; gimme five,  spoonbread .  urlLink Kerry and McCain for the ages . Ahhhh, the pause that refreshes.   There are a lot of aristocratic Republican types ( urlLink Arnaud de Borchgrave , anyone?) as well as  urlLink Log Cabin Republicans  (Why in this day and age, after civil rights, would anyone oppose gay marriage? I don't get conservatives sometimes),  urlLink immigration reform minded Republicans  in the Southwest,  who cannot abide by the fucking hayseed/hillbilly reactionary center of the universe that is the Bush White House. Any fucking moment I expect  John Ascroft  to do a little faith revivalist hillbilly dance with a rattlesnake in his arms, singing some West Virginia ditty.  A Kerry-McCain ticket would make it pretty goddam jake for swing voters to go Democrat("and they say once you go Democrat ...") even though  John Kerry  is as exciting as  urlLink photosynthesis . According to  urlLink The NY Times :  "'Senator McCain would not have to leave his party,' (former Senator Bob) Kerrey said. 'He could remain a Republican, would be given some authority over selection of cabinet people. The only thing he would have to do is say, I'm not going to appoint any judges who would overturn  Roe v. Wade ,' - the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion, which Mr. McCain has said he opposes.   " Chris Lehane , a Democratic strategist who once worked for Mr. Kerry, said such a ticket 'would be the political equivalent of the Yankees signing A-Rod,' referring to  Alex Rodriguez , the team's star third baseman."  The very fact that this idea is being "floated" ( urlLink last weeks flavor was Governor Bill Richardson )tells me that the Kerry camp is seriosuly considering it; which is, as  Martha Stewart  might say were she not so stressed at present,  a good thing . One can almost see  urlLink George Stephanopoulos  choking on his Ovaltine. McCain comes from the critical Southwest and he brings Republican moderates into the fold. The Southwest, to the Democratic Party, is the new black; (note to Kerry: pick up a  urlLink Navajo-made Silver & Turquoise Bolo Tie  for the campaign trail).   Out :  urlLink Troy . That shit sucked. I am the biggest classics geek. Ever.  urlLink Homer  and  urlLink Plato  and  urlLink Sophocles  and  urlLink Xenophon  are my favorites. I weep over  urlLink Euripides' Medea . I read Greek and Latin; I actually studied the languages and their literatures in college. Fuck it, I find  urlLink anacreontic poetry  to be darkly beautiful, I'm hopeless; get some Cutty Sark in me and I'll recite (or, better yet, don't and avoid the ungodly spectacle of a Ugandan blogger scanning Homeric meter). But, goddamn it,  urlLink Troy  sucked ass.  Oh Lord, how it sucked . Hollywood should just leave the fucking  urlLink Great Books  alone. They are not equipped to handle the job. Patently unfit. And no Hollywood actress has an interesting enough face to play  urlLink Helen of Sparta , the most beautiful woman in the world, daughter of Zeus.  Hmmm , well, allow me amend that, maybe  urlLink Angelina Jolie , with that  urlLink beautiful Gemini face .   Out : Apple Paltrow,  grrr  ( The Corsair  frowns).  urlLink According to the AP : "Hollywood actress Gwyneth Paltrow has given birth to her first child, a daughter called Apple, a spokesman said on Saturday."   Grrrr . I know, I know, why would you welcome an innocent little WASP baby into the world like that by putting it on  The Corsair  out list? Paltrow's face just sets me off and makes me do crezzy things. I didn't even like her in  urlLink Seven , where she played the mousy wife ("What's in the box ..."). I'm just old school like that.   In :  urlLink Jimmy Kimmel ODs on Advil . "Don't hate ...  appreciate ," ( The Corsair  heard a little suburban wigger with a  urlLink hat tipped pimp-style like Britney's boyfriend  saying that this morning in Midtown at the cross street to another tweenager).   Out :  urlLink Fashionweekdaliy's Quote of the Daily , from  Farnsworth Bentley , P Diddy's (softly chuckles) "manservant/ Howard University graduate," "There will come a time when people will ask, 'Where’s your umbrella from?' and if it isn't from FJ Bentley, it won't be special. The parasol will be the next avant-garde fashion accessory. Trust me."  From Howard U. to peddling parasols.  Nice . The shark is circling Farnsworth, you of the bandy legs and discombobulated dance maneuverings. Your next line, Mr. Bentley, should be, "do you want your  urlLink blood blisters removed, Mr. Diddy ?"   In :  Socialites . Thin slices of yum yum, spending their lives in leisure, looking good. There are so many things we mortal men wish to know about socialites. How do they remain so razor-thin: Do they always eat such small portions: how come they always smell so mmm-mmmm good?    Anyhoo : Our favorite socialite, our future first wife,  urlLink Miu Von Furstenburg , is in Los Angeles, causing quite a stir. You will remember yesterday she went mano-a-mano with  Milla Jovovich :  "Being in LA, and preparing for the long haul, I wanted to get pampered. So my friend Nicky and I went to the unfortunately named  Juan Juan Salon  in Beverly Hills. We went in for a simple manicure and pedicure. However, when we saw that they do aromatherapy hair treatments, we had to jump at the chance (although my first thought was, 'what the fuck is it?'). I mean how LA would this be. Maybe this exists in New York City, and I've never noticed (I have been going to the same stylist for years).  "To my disappointment, it was basically an expensive oil treatment. A combination of Lemon, Geranium, Tea Tree, Chamomile, and lemon were used. All I have to say, is that afterwards I hated the smell of my hair. If I wanted to smell of Geranium, I would have gone to my aunt Allegra's and rolled around in her garden."  New York just isn't the same. Come back, Miu.    Out :  Don Hewitt  and his old ... old ... very Old Boys Club, with Mike Wallace. You know you're on CBS when, as the party bumps,  Leslie Stahl  is the spring chicken of the bunch.  On Tuesday night, the 60 Minutes Gang (what do you call a grouping of octagenerians? A murder of Old Crows?) talk with  urlLink Don Hewitt as he gets ready to retire . You can be sure  urlLink there will be more softballs tossed here than in Elijah Woods' bedroom  after the  urlLink Appletinis  are drunk:  "The man most responsible for telling the stories that 60 Minutes is famous for finally tells his own story on CBS.   "Broadcast journalism legend  Don Hewitt  takes the spotlight to talk with his correspondents about his career and his creation in  urlLink 'Tell Me a Story: The Man Who Made 60 Minutes,'  to be broadcast Tuesday, May 18, at 9 p.m. ET/PT.   "Correspondents  Mike Wallace ,  Morley Safer ,  Ed Bradley ,  Steve Kroft  and  Lesley Stahl  join Hewitt in a lively discussion punctuated with footage of 60 Minutes classic moments and people."  No mention of how  urlLink he  and  urlLink Mike Wallace  made  Meredith Viera's  life a living hell before she resigned because she had the temerity to have a baby. Wallace and Hewitt essentially double teamed her until she finally resigned, all chronicled by  urlLink Richard Cohen .  Assholes.  Great journalists, though, who did great things, but assholes nonetheless of another era not as liberal and sophisticated.  Also,  Out :  The Swan . According to  urlLink TheSmokinggun.com : "The Los Angeles doctor Fox Television has tabbed to provide "psychological counseling" to contestants on "The Swan," its controversial plastic surgery makeover show, received her Ph.D. from a California correspondence school that was described this week as an unaccredited "diploma mill" by congressional investigators,  urlLink The Smoking Gun  has learned.

       Court Love: The Unbearable Lightness of Being Crezzy    Or, Silly Girl ... Silly Trial    urlLink TheSmokinggun.com  does their usual fine job of deconstructing the disintegrating rocker today:  "The way  Courtney Love  sees it, her March arrest for assault actually had nothing to do with her smashing her microphone stand in the face of that poor New York concertgoer. Instead, the bedraggled 39-year-old singer chalks her assault/reckless endangerment to an overarching plot: 'The police have a conspiracy against rocker chicks.' That is just one of many kooky statements Love made to  New York Police Department  officers after her March 18 arrest, according to the below disclosure form filed yesterday by Manhattan prosecutors. Love also told an NYPD sergeant that she was getting popped because, 'You just want to be famous.' Love entered a not guilty plea at her misdemeanor arraignment yesterday in Manhattan's Criminal Court. She then repaired to a courthouse bathroom for a rambling press conference with female reporters, a tactic  Martha Stewart  never thought to employ."  Her soon-to-be infamous impromptu bathroom press conference tapped into a wide array of important social issues, including but not excluding, Why My Daughter ( The Corsair  sobs softly, sweetly) has to give up her  horse  to help her Mommy (Another generation of Cobains, it appears, has to give up The Horse ... fascinating); also, the Cryptic Mosaic Warning, "You do not sleep with married men (is this the Kabbalah-red-string-theory at work?);" and, immediately contradicting the previous statement, in a personal message to the  very  married  Russell Crowe  (like, personal over the world's media personal -- you know we're in the Bizarro world of Courtney logic here), "I'm sorry to  Russell Crowe  for you leaving me all those messages for the Golden Globes. I never got them, dude. It would have been a fun date."  Indeed it would, biscuit. Courtney's a fun sorta gal: a hoot, no doubt,  if you will , with her own, to be quite graphic, surgically-enhanced set golden globes to play with; but even Russell, our gruff, lager-infused-punkface-thesbian, even  Russell Crowe  couldn't handle that flavor of heapin' crezziness that is Court Love. She's a whole lotta woman, that Court;  whole lotta woman.   Court Love: Livin the Thug Life, swinging from court date to court date, assaulting peeps.   urlLink She's like the wind .

       Will Andy Kaufman Return From The Dead?   He's Supposed to Resurrect on Sunday   urlLink The AP reports : "Andy Kaufman died of lung cancer on May 16, 1984, but according to legend, the eccentric comedian said if he were faking, he'd resurface 20 years later to the day.   "'So, just in case, a party is being planned by  Bob Zmuda , Kaufman's best friend and partner, at the House of Blues in Los Angeles on May 16. ( Ed note : This Sunday)   "'Over 100 personal ads will be taken out across the country and abroad, reminding him of his words. Will he show?' Zmuda asked on the Web site for Comic Relief, a series of shows that raise money for health care for the homeless. Zmuda founded Comic Relief after Kaufman's death.   "VIP tickets to the Andy Kaufman — Dead or Alive? tribute offer 'select seating and celebrity reception (hopefully with Andy).'"   Is this the second coming of Latke? Was Andy Kaufman's death a hoax? Will Zmuda make a bundle for Comic Relief and the homeless, two worthy charities, BTW.   Tune in. Comment here, or  urlLink VH1's Best Week Ever . I can't say I believe this to be anything other than Zmuda drumming up money for worthy charities with dubious means, but, say, wouldn't it be wild if Kaufman actually pulled a prank of galactic proportions that took 20 years to pull off? How ... Kaufmanesque ... would that be?

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  Stolen Demi-Ashton pics  ... I'm never gonna dance again, guilty feet aint got no rhythm.  Anyhoo : Enough about me; lets talk Kutcher. Soon to make the rounds of your favorite Not-Safe-For-Work internet sites (cue to the sleazy neon lights and cheap ass sax solo) are the  forbidden love  photos of Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher that were allegedly filched,  urlLink according to The Sun :  "FILM beauty  Demi Moore  is devastated after discovering that X-rated snaps of her and toyboy lover  Ashton Kutcher  have been stolen.   "The pictures were on a laptop nicked from the Hollywood Hills home of Ashton’s friend  Adam Goldberg .   "The couple are worried that the images will appear on the internet like heiress  Paris Hilton’s  infamous sex video.   "A police spokesman said the photos were of Ashton, 26, and 41-year-old Demi in 'compromising positions.'"  We'll glance over the British use of 'nicked,' which has always rubbed me the wrong way, like  urlLink Benny Hill , which, to me, is just one more reason to hate the British (let me not get started on the term 'cheeky,'). Wonderful to relate, though, true believer, is that  The Corsair , too, keeps intimate photos of himself and his various toygirls on the laptop at of fellow blogger  urlLink TMFTML . Ashton and Demi, combined, prolly share a solitary, but pretty brain cell and on that day, it was in joint custody.  The Corsair  erupts:  Pickleheads!     Out : The oily Vanity Fair Editor  Graydon Carter , slithers into the out column this week. According to Graydon Carter's Vanity Fair, the Entertainment industry is so very alabaster indeed that African-Americans  urlLink have failed to grace the cover of said august institution for years  ...  years.    Because we all know that  Gretchen Moll  is hotter than  Prince .  So, having vented thusly (deep cleansing breath), it comes as no surprise to  The Corsair  that  urlLink his ethics are being called into question . He was rather conveniently paid a staggering $100,000 "finders fee" (Russian wink, Nigerian nod) for suggesting to  Universal Pictures  that  Sylvia Nasser's 'A Beautiful Mind  be made into a film:  "'Vanity Fair has been blurring the lines for some time,' said  Cynthia Gorney , associate dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley. 'But there is something particularly distressing about the nice round figure of $100,000 and the fact that it directly lined Mr. Carter's pocket.'"  Indeed ( The Corsair  gloats), his  urlLink Turnbull and Asser  suit must have been specially tailored to manage all that loot ( The Corsair  struts, vindicated). We all know,  of course , that in Hollywood, studios throw money at anyone who mentions an idea ( The Corsair  is now all puffed up and self-satisfied). Of course, ( The Corsair  puffs a Montecristo cigar)  Ron Howard  has been lavished with praise (wink wink) by Vanity Fair as a result.  Well, you have to hand it to  Graydon Carter , this is a particularly inventive, possitively  Nigerian  way to get graft by using his position in the world.     In :  urlLink Scott's stereogum chronicles  the Coppertone motif from ad to Magazine cover, as  Carmen Electra  takes over where  Jim ("Voices") Carrey  left off, namely, on an exposed moon.     Out :  Russell and Kimora , possibly-maybe on the out. We'll have to wait for the next New York Magazine. According to  urlLink Fashionweekdaily , "Writer  Phoebe Eaton  is doing a piece on Baby Phat 'designer'  Kimora Lee Simmons  for  New York magazine ."   urlLink Phoebe Eaton  is a hottie. That's apropos of nothing, I just wanted to let my feelings on the subject be out there. (  ... call me Phoebe?)    In :  Sidney Blumenthal  is partisan to the nth degree, but he is also a smart cookie, and he makes a strong argument this week against the neoconservative star in DC, which shines less brightly these days. In his  urlLink column for The Guardian he writes :  "Under  Bush , the team of  Cheney  and  Rumsfeld  spread across the top rungs of government, drawing staff from the neoconservative cabal and infusing their rightwing temperaments with ideological imperatives. The unvarnished will to power took on a veneer of ideas and idealism. Iraq was not a case of vengeance or power, but the cause of democracy and human rights.   "The fate of the neoconservative project depends on Rumsfeld's job. If he were to go, so would his deputy, the neoconservative Robespierre,  Paul Wolfowitz . Also threatened would be the cadres who stovepiped the disinformation that neoconservative darling  Ahmed Chalabi  used to manipulate public opinion before the war. In his Senate testimony last week, Rumsfeld explained that the government asking the press not to report  Abu Ghraib  'is not against our principles. It is not suppression of the news.' War is peace."    urlLink We miss you, Bill , we honestly miss you ...   Out :  Oh, snap ,  Dany Levy , possibly the cutest, petitest online writers gets a bit of a beating  urlLink at the hands of the evil geniuses at Lowculture today :  "Either  urlLink Dany Levy’s  minions are easily fascinated or they should think about changing their meds.  urlLink Daily Candy , Levy's digest of overpriced baubles and prime evidence of why Americans deserve to be hated ..."  Low culture is so good, and yet so evil, like Rocky III's  urlLink Clubber Lang  ...  we like.    In : Sometimes I feel like  Haley Joel Osment  ...  urlLink I see white people . ( The Corsair  sends special thug love to socialite  Topsy Taylor , and kudos to NY Social Diary's  David Patrick Columbia , who we suspect, will see the humor in this)   Out : My friends  urlLink Lola and Patti and the always excellent Dman (hey Casey and Michael) from Papermag.com's message board  came up with the clever line: 'Dude, Where's My Couture?'   How right they are, as according to  urlLink British Vogue :  "PARIS will be a poorer place come Couture Week. Both PARIS will be a poorer place come Couture Week. Both  urlLink Emanuel Ungaro  and  urlLink Donatella Versace  have announced that they are bowing out of fashion's most exclusive week, which is set to run from July 6 - 9. The news follows  urlLink Givenchy's  announcement this week that it would not present a couture catwalk show, as it had not yet replaced  Julien Macdonald , as well as rumours that  Valentino  may not be showing either.  Pierre Berge ,  Yves Saint Laurent's  long-time partner, says this is simply a continuation of a trend begun by YSL himself, followed by the likes of  Thierry Mugler ,  Louis Feraud ,  Lanvin  and  Nina Ricci . 'I'm sure others will follow,' he told  Women's Wear Daily . 'I've always said that the couture would die with  Yves Saint Laurent . Now it's a domino effect. The couture has lost its raison d'etre. Couture isn't art. It's not meant to be hung in a closet like a painting. The women who wore couture no longer exist, the art de vivre that spawned couture has died. If houses such as  Chanel  and  Dior  one day get proof that they can sell as many bags and fragrances without a couture show, they'll stop couture, too."    In :  Miu Von Furstenberg , we love. Perhaps someday my blog and Miu's blog will get married, and beautiful mocha colored blogs will ensue.  urlLink Miu is on the left coast, causing mayhem :  "I'm in LA, so of course one must visit  Fred Segal . A trip to Fred Segal usually entails a celebrity sighting, although with my luck it's usually the minor ones. Once again, FS doesn't disappoint. Of course I drag along my good friend  urlLink Nicky Getty .  "Since this is LA, I must purchase something white, so I go with a little white cocktail dress from Gucci (Robi is taking my later this week for my first spray on tan so I won't look like a ghost). It seems every third woman in LA is wearing white; it's quite disarming. While I'm making the purchase, I spot  Milla Jovovich ."   The Corsair  grabs some salt-free popcorn and is riveted to the screen.   "I'm never one who has a problem engaging in banter with a celebrity. I of course to the obligatory,   "Miu: 'Are you Milla Jovovich?'   "Milla: While not directly looking at me, she answers, 'Yes I am.'   The Corsair  mouths the words: 'It's-on-like-Grey-Poupon!' and pumps his fist wildly in the air.  "Miu: While racking my brain trying to come up with a film she was in, I blurt out - 'You were the best part of The Fifth Element.' (Knowing for a fact that  Chris Tucker  was, but I wasn't talking to Chris Tucker.)  "Milla: She smiles, and says 'Thank you.'   "Miu: She obviously knows I just lied to her. But of course I press on. 'Are you ever going to record another CD? I really love your singing voice.'   The Corsair  cringes.  "Milla: 'No. I'm sorry, I don't have time for this.'  "Miu: So the loving her singing voice comment threw her over the edge. No one to back down, I slightly shout as she's walking away 'Any chance for a sequel to Joan Arc?'   The Corsair  is crushing so hard on Miu's gutsiness.  "Milla: She turns her head briefly and I believe mouthed the word 'Bitch.'  "So I guess we will never know if there will be a sequel to  The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc . I turned around to sign the receipt for my purchase, and the saleswoman was just staring at me. I said, 'Well at least I didn't ask for an autograph.'"   urlLink It's Miu's world , I just blog in it.   Out : The Administration. Even Republicans are mad at Bush, notes  Jonathan E. Kaplan  of  urlLink TheHill.com :  "Republicans on the Hill are so frustrated with the White House that when Speaker J.  Dennis Hastert  (R-Ill.) criticized the administration at a House GOP meeting last week, the caucus burst into applause.  "The meeting was only the latest sign in an accumulating body of evidence that lawmakers are unhappy with the way the administration treats them.  "One GOP lawmaker at the caucus meeting said Hastert 'expressed outright dismay with the White House staff for the way the transportation bill had been handled. They did not give the priority necessary to the issue in resolving it as the Speaker had wanted. It’s in absolute limbo.'   "A rank-and-file lawmaker said: 'Hastert was frustrated and disappointed that he had not been dealt with openly and fairly and given accurate information. He was not so much speaking to the conference as he was speaking for the conference.'"

       Like Father, Like Son    urlLink Adam Clayton Powell IV . There are few greater pleasures in the world than watching Harlem politics. And the upcoming battle between  Adam Clayton Powell, IV  and ranking member on the  urlLink Ways and Means Committee, Charlie Rangel , was going to be a battle of the superheavyweights. It was slated to be hotter than  urlLink Sylvia's  gumbo.  As the legend goes:  Charlie Rangel  humiliated Adam Powell's dad, the legendary Adam Clayton Powell, arguably the grandaddy of Harlem, a larger than life figure. Light-skinned, Powell passed for white, and ended up going to elite universities and moving in powerful circles. He wasa good looking man, and that helped him navigate in both the black and white worlds during the Civil Rights struggles, in Congress, representing Harlem  In his later years, alas, he became corrupt (on a Nigerian-Russian scale), carousing with busty women and whiskey instead of defending Harlem's interests in Congress during the crucial civil rights era. Rangel, it is said in legend, headed the delegation to Bimini sent to seperate Powell from the booze and chicks (party pooper!). Powell, allegedy, slapped Rangel in the face during the "impromptu intervention" and said, simply, "you do what you gotta do, baby"  And he did. In defeating Powell, which led to the great man's ruin on the cliffs of unfulfilled destiny, Rangel became the new biggest cat in the jungle in Harlem politics. Cut to a few decades later, the former great man's son, Adam Clayton Powell, IV, has come back to avenge the family name (like Andrew Cuomo, like George Bush the Younger). Powell was born of a Puerto Rican mother, and has a base in both black Harlem and the rising Latino demographic. Add the fact that he inherited his father's looks. The battle, as they say,  was on like Gray Poupon    After Powell got elected to an Assembly seat, it was only a matter of time before WW III. Even Al Sharpton, angry that Rangel didn't support his presidential bid, .  urlLink threatened to inject himself on the side of Powell   But the  urlLink rape allegations in a seedy Howard Johnson's  that sufaced against Powell may have ended the dream. Just like his dad, and, perhaps just like  urlLink Andrew Cuomo  and  urlLink George Bush the Younger .   urlLink Fathers and Sons  ...  Funny how generational sagas tend to repeat themselves ...  ( The Corsair  contemplates Bill Clinton in his harlem office, on 125th street, in the summer, contemplating the  kapow  booty of the ladies that stroll that way in the poom-poom shorts. This isn't anemic DC flank -- no, this is Harlemworld USDA Ground round highwater booty.  The Corsair  feels profound sympathy for The Passion of Bill)

       "Lindsay Lohan is a Total Snob"   That significant cultural artifact  urlLink Star Magazine  tells us that the raspy-voiced teen hearthrob  Lindsay Lohan  is letting all the fame go to her head (and not, contrary to beliefs aired on  urlLink TMFTML , her chest):  "'Lindsay was a total snob,' says a source on the Canadian set of her latest and most excellent flick,  urlLink Mean Girls . 'She thinks she's as famous as  Britney Spears . She treated the crew members like they were her personal servants, commanding them to grab her drinks.' Lindsay's natural naughtiness helped her land the part, reveals an executive with Paramount Pictures. '[Mean Girls writer]  Tina Fey  wanted a star like Drew Barrymore, but Lindsay nailed it on the first audition,' the source says. 'Everyone knew she was right for the role.'"  "But sources say Lindsay's stardom has gone to her head. A fashion stylist who recently worked with Lindsay on a magazine shoot tells Star, 'She would take clothes off the racks and if she didn't like something, she would just throw it on the floor. She is by far the most difficult star I've styled.'"  Okay, leaving aside the fact that said precvious speaker used the word "style" as a verb, there is something  strangely fascinating  about teen superstars and how they behave. I have a touch of the amateur sociologist about me (one could argue, frankly, that this is the primary focus of the blog), and the  psychology  of how a teenager behaves when the world gives them its full attention and they are  liberated  from family need and from financial worry, is ... intriguing (rubs hands together and chuckles like  urlLink mad scientist ).    urlLink Thank you Star Magazine , for answering my prayers with empirical data.  Lindsay Lohan is our lab monkey  (no,  TMFTML ,  lab  monkey, not  love  monkey):  "While filming Mean Girls, the talented ( Ed. Note :  The Corsair  softly chuckled when he read the word 'talented' in reference to Lohan) 17-year-old singer/actress reportedly scrambled to cover up a messy car accident she got into while illegally driving around in a rented $100,000 Mercedes. Lohan reportedly tried to sneak the damaged vehicle into a repair shop, but got caught.  "And recently, Lindsay reportedly tried to pick up  Colin Farrell  on the Paramount lot. After eyeing each other, Lohan supposedly offered Farrell her phone number -- but he declined the minor's offer ( Ed note . Lohan is under 18). Her reps deny it, but Farrell has mysteriously not commented."   The Corsair  Lab Notes (scribbling furiously): Rich, famous teenagers will cover up illegal car wrecks and initiate unlawful sexual encounters with other, older hearthrobs.   "Then there is Lindsay's feud with her archrival  Hilary Duff , 16.The starlets are said to have first battled over 16-year-old singer  Aaron Carter , who was dating Lohan, but reportedly started two-timing with Duff behind Lohan's back. Lohan was said to be furious.  "The pair have also become increasingly competitive for lead roles. Even after Lindsay was cast in  Mean Girls , a source says Hilary's manager-mom Susan was calling to get an audition for Hilary. 'Too bad. She was never even a consideration!'"   The Corsair  Lab Notes: Child actor manager-parents are stupid asses.  "These days, one of Lindsay's friends tells Star that the teen feels her star shines much brighter than Duff's (who's best known for Disney's  Lizzie McGuire ), and now has a few films and an album in the works. 'Lindsay doesn't care about any of this. There is no competition on her part.' However, in an apparent copycat career move, Lindsay is also recording her own debut album, which some say is another attempt to steal Duff's thunder.  Adds the source on Mean Girls, 'Lindsay has a major attitude problem. She'd better watch her behavior or she's going to make even more enemies.'"    The Corsair  lab notes conclude: Teenagers plus fame plus fortune equals picklehead.

Linda Fiorentino's is 4 pages long!   Out :  Congressman Henry Hyde . The paunch, the small minded take on internationalism, the (makes disgusted hand gestures) the whole Hyde package -- (averted gaze), it just doesn't work. Now,  urlLink According to TheHill  the Congressman has been ahving a grand old time with taxpayer funding for a fiscal conservative:  "Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.), chairman of the House International Relations Committee, took 23 aides on a 13-lawmaker congressional delegation, to Ireland and Hungary last month.  "There were 17 congressional staff and 6 military aides.  "The high number caused consternation among lawmakers on the trip who say codels usually include fewer staff than members of Congress.  "Among Hyde’s retinue were three of his Chicago-based district staff, including a mother and her daughter, and a military physical therapist/personal trainer who spent much of his time shopping and sightseeing with the lawmakers’ spouses."  (Averted gaze) Now, you will remember, of course, this asshole Hyde, from Lewinskygate where  urlLink his own hypocritical affair was revealed in all it's suburban smarm .    Out :  Sadie Frost . Jude Law's terminally melancholy ex-wife Sadie Frost got fired from her UK talk show,  urlLink according to the Sun .  "The series,  urlLink What Sadie Did Next  on Channel 4’s satellite arm E4, was her first go at telly presenting and she hoped it would be a springboard to a new career. But bosses pulled the plug after eight shows.  "Last night a source said: 'Sadie got a lot of criticism for being a lightweight interviewer. People just didn’t warm to the sycophantic way she treated her celebrity pals on the show.'  "She was supposed to use her connections to pull in A-list guests. But after kicking off impressively with  GWYNETH PALTROW , things went downhill fast."  Okay, we'll leave aside those of you (me included) that question the status of Gwyneth Paltrow as an A-Lister. The article continues, brutally:  "The limp cast of low-rent C-listers included artist  urlLink TRACEY EMIN , dope smuggler  urlLink HOWARD MARKS , Hollywood madam  urlLink HEIDI FLEISS  and singer  urlLink PEACHES ."  This unfortunate news does, however, have a good side. The spare time will allow Frost to more accurately stalk  Jude Law .

As  urlLink WWD's Jeff Bercovici tells it , "The New York Post has hired Orla Healy to be its fashion editor.

After 10 years with  The New York Daily News , she joined In Style in 2000 as deputy editor, leaving in 2002 to become U.S. correspondent for  The Sunday Independent , an Irish newspaper.

"the founding publisher of Russian Vogue and Vice President of Conde Nast International, was a snitch for eight years, who tattled on his own colleagues, according to Der Spiegel, Germany's leading news weekly." Apparently his code name was "Olden," as opposed to, say, urlLink  Jonah .  Fashionwiredaily continues:  "In his file, Runge is described as 'social, a good talker and crafty.'" Which, in retrospect, makes him the perfect Conde Nasty.

When three intellectuals of world-historical importance gather together, well, you can imagine the conversation --  Hannah Arendt ,  Plato ,  Ralph Ellison ,  Marie Curie  and  Confucius , surprisingly, did not come up in conversation:  "DEIRDRE IMUS: It started as being an athlete and playing sports. I've never been on a diet. So this isn't about diets or what diets work or don't work. It's just about, for me, at least, eating a healthy. And the most important thing goes beyond whether you eat meat or not. It's eating organic food and eating whole food.   "KING: But this is ranch food, you bill it as cowboy food, meaning. Because cowboys are associated with beef. This one's for dinner.   "DEIRDRE IMUS: That hasn't changed except for at our ranch. These cowboys that work on the ranch, they don't have to stay for lunch and dinner. They want to be there. They eat lunch and dinner with all the kids. They love it. They love the food. They still eat their steaks and hamburgers and everything else.   "DON IMUS: She's not against people. All of our friends are cattle ranchers. We're not opposed to people eating meat.   "DEIRDRE IMUS: I don't have any vegetarian friend and I hate most vegetarians."  More of this Platonic symposium  urlLink here .  This is not a pipe.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In : My fellow blogger and partner in online crimes,  urlLink Miu Von Furstenberg, is in Los Angeles :  "Miu has arrived and will be trying to avoid any silicon spills during my extended stay. I'm unfortunately not here for pleasure (although I'm sure I will stumble upon some), it's a business thing."   Miu is in LA. The air is thick with scoop. All is good in the world.  Basta!    Out : I will not even try to unravel the geopolitical mess that is the Chechnya situation here. Can;t do it. Too fucking complex. But lets, for a second, at least, mull it over,  urlLink a la Reuters :  " The leader of Russia's restive Chechnya region was buried Monday, the day after an assassination that shook President  Vladimir Putin's  plans to tame rebellion he sees as a threat to the fabric of his country.   "Thousands of mourners attended the funeral of  urlLink President Akhmad Kadyrov , an ex-Muslim cleric central to Putin's bid to pacify mainly Muslim Chechnya but viewed by rebels as a traitor. Security appeared tight at the ceremony at his home village, Tsentoroi.   "Kadyrov was killed with six others by a bomb blast at a World War II victory ceremony in a stadium in the regional capital Grozny Sunday. The bomb was planted under the VIP stand where top Russian and Chechen officials had gathered."  I am no fan of central asian terrorism or even the sinister means by which the Black Widows of Chechnya are using in their war, but: Why is Putin holding on to this region? Is it a matter of pride? Is it some barbaric sense that Russia's power will unravel if he lets this region of darker skinned people go? What the fuck is Putin smoking that he considers his Chechnyan War anything remotely like the United States' War on Terror? Why do Russians have such a powerful national addiction shows of force? Does this have anything to do with the suppression of the Orthodox Church, the Death of God, the rise of Communism and now, without any mitigating ethical system, the rise of Ultracapitalism ( urlLink Sopranos-style )?  urlLink Is the Russian character okay with autocratic personas ? How will Putin respond? Revenge is like cold cuts ... With ultraviolence, most likely.

'It makes me sick to my stomach,' a spokesman for the play's producers, who are set to commence legal proceedings against Purnell, said. 'Everyone involved with the show and all of the staff at DKNY are extremely upset by his actions. Donna and her colleagues have been so supportive of the show and to say we're disappointed in Craig's behaviour is an understatement. It's a case of gross professional misconduct, which means that Craig has not been paid and nor will he be paid unless the property is returned in the condition in which it was given to him.' Purnell's spokesman confirmed that the clothes were still in his possession but said 'the situation is being dealt with. We are obviously hoping the items will be returned.'"  Hey, Craigie: return the DNKY: ASAP!

"According to these sources, the central bank this fall will raise the federal funds (interbank lending) rate from the current historic low of 1 percent to 1.25 percent. The Fed is expected to push the rate to 1.5 percent later this year after the election, and up to 2 percent early next year."

Nevertheless :  "'To Estonians, being part of Europe sounds at first like being part of the Soviet Union,' she says. 'So that is my first task - I don't have a whole lot of policies worked out. I just want to activate people to be a part of it, the political process; to educate people on what it means to go out there and take up the opportunities.

       Henry The Intern: Topic A with tina Brown    urlLink The Gawker's intrepid intern Henry  breaks down Tina Brown's Topic A with elan:  "'What are the chances this is going to change the minds and the convictions' of Arabs, voters, and the administration?  urlLink (Foreign Affairs Editor James) Hoge  hypothesized America is a superpower acting as a rogue state. Back to the pornographic imagery, what do these pictures mean for women?  urlLink (bloated art critic Robert) Hughes : 'Women can be just as bad and demonic. . . the culture that generates this kind of behavior affects women just as much as men.'"  Hughes then, I thought brilliantly, referenced his own book on  urlLink Goya, contrasting the Master with the pornographic "hooding" sadomasochistic photos . He said that while Goya's eye was "appaled," the soldier's photos were "... done with a kind of jokey approval."  Like,  d'uh .  Then Henry notes that Tina forgot herself, or ran out of questions, and asked the same obvious question,  twice :  "Tina's idea of a probing question for a tease: 'Would Camelot be possible without Jackie?' They all answer no, duh -- and Tina asks again on the other side of the break."  Wake up, Tina, when cometing with  urlLink Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone , you've got to be at the top of your game,  on the real .  Anyhoo: thanks,  urlLink Henry .

       60 Minutes: General Zinni to Bushies: You Screwed Up The War   There is no question that  Don Hewett's  60 Minutes, where  The Don  is about to fade into the reddish-bronze  urlLink sunset of retirement on Martha's Vinyard , has been perhaps the most influential anti-Bush media outlet.  Howard Stern  probably ranks in a close second, pulling the conservative ethnic Democrats as well as Republican white manual labor crowds, people who usually might normally vote for Bush, but won't. But one would be  hard pressed  indeed to find another media player other than 60 Minutes so consistently and brutally anti-Bush, not even the New york Times. And Sunday night's  60 Minutes  continues that trend, with the clock ticking for the Bush Administration's demise.   Bill Clinton's  former Commander-in-Chief of Centcomm,  urlLink Ret. Gen Anthony Zinni , is not happy with the way the Bushies are handling the war,  urlLink according to the CBS 60 Minutes website :  "Accusing top Pentagon officials of 'dereliction of duty,' retired Marine Gen.  Anthony Zinni  says staying the course in Iraq isn't a reasonable option.   "'The course is headed over Niagara Falls. I think it's time to change course a little bit or at least hold somebody responsible for putting you on this course,' he tells CBS News Correspondent  Steve Kroft  in an interview to be broadcast on  urlLink 60 Minutes, Sunday, May 23, at 7 p.m. ET/PT .   "The current situation in Iraq was destined to happen, says  urlLink Zinni , because planning for the war and its aftermath has been flawed all along.   "'There has been poor strategic thinking in this...poor operational planning and execution on the ground,' says  urlLink Zinni , who served as commander-in-chief of the U.S. Central Command from 1997 to 2000."   This sets up  urlLink Zinni  to address the ongoing Civil War within the the nation at large, the Realists versus the Neoconservatives.  Ironically , as it has been, up to now, Conservatives have ridiculed the utopianism and  naivite  ( urlLink Nietzsche  and  urlLink Kissinger's  favorite perjorative) of  urlLink the Left .They'd like to buy the world a Coke and we'd like to open markets for soft drinks in Central Asia,  that sort of thing . The pendulum swings:  "Zinni blames the poor planning on the civilian policymakers in the administration, known as  urlLink neo-conservatives , who saw the invasion as a way to stabilize the region and support Israel. He believes these people, who include  urlLink Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz  and  urlLink Douglas Feith , the undersecretary of defense, have hijacked U.S. foreign policy.   "'They promoted it and pushed [the war]... even to the point of creating their own intelligence to match their needs. Then they should bear the responsibility,' Zinni tells Kroft.   " urlLink In his upcoming book, 'Battle Ready, ' written with  Tom Clancy , Zinni writes of the poor planning in harsh terms. 'In the lead-up to the Iraq war and its later conduct, I saw, at minimum, true dereliction, negligence and irresponsibility; at worst, lying, incompetence and corruption,' he writes.   "Zinni explains to Kroft, 'I think there was dereliction in insufficient forces being put on the ground and [in not] fully understanding the military dimensions of the plan.'"  Could there be--somehow -- a connection with an overly idealistic geopolitical philosophy and the inability to accurately predict and incorporate the military dimensions of that plan? Are idealists at  a disadvantage  in war, on the ground,  in reality ? And does the incompetence in executing a ground war serve as a final refutation of idealist philosophy in war? I'm just saying, yo ...  "(Zinni) still believes the situation is salvageable if the United States can communicate more effectively with the Iraqi people and demonstrate a better image to them.   "The enlistment of the U.N. and other countries to participate in the mission is also crucial, he says. Without these things, says Zinni, 'We are going to be looking for quick exits. I don't believe we're there now, and I wouldn't want to see us fail here.'   "Also central to success in Iraq is more troops, from the United States and especially other countries, to control violence and patrol borders, he says.   "Zinni feels that undertaking the war with the minimum of troops paved the way for the security problems the U.S. faces there now, the violence  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld  recently admitted he hadn't anticipated.   "'He should not have been surprised,' says Zinni. 'There were a number of people who before we even engaged in this conflict felt strongly that we underestimated ... the scope of the problems we would have in [Iraq].'"  They were called  urlLink realists .    urlLink CBS' 60 Minutes website concludes :  "The fact that no one in the administration has paid for the blunder irks Zinni. 'But regardless of whose responsibility [it is]...it should be evident to everybody that they've screwed up, and whose heads are rolling on this?'"   Perhaps this could be true of  Secretary Rumsfeld , if, indeed, his effectiveness and usefulness to the Administration has run it's course. Or, as  urlLink Senator Warner said last year, Rumsfeld is becoming a "millstone around the President's neck."  In that instance, Rummy would resign. I have 50-50 odds that he does.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In : The penultimate Soprano's episode for the penultimate Sopranos season is on Sunday night ( The Corsair  rubs his hands together and chuckles softly in anticipation).   Molte buono!  And so it begins (munches on zeppolli). As  urlLink the HBO website describes the episode , "With the feds pulling a new trump card,  urlLink Adriana  ponders her options.  urlLink Tony B.  unloads some heavy baggage on  urlLink Tony , and vice-versa;  urlLink Johnny Sack  makes Tony an offer he can refuse; and Tony offers Carmela a deal to make her real-estate dreams come true. Don't miss the all new episode 'Long Term Parking' on Sunday May 23rd at 9PM ET."  ( The Corsair  digs into a plate of pounds of shrimp scampi)  So, does that mean  Adriana  gets whacked,  Ninja style ? Or does she convince  Christufuh  to go into witness protection or what? What heavy baggage? Were the Tony's victims of child abuse when they were younger? Is that what made them the men they are today,  capish ? ( The Corsair  chows down on veal marsala, making wild Mediterranean hand gestures)   Out :  Senator John Kerry , he of the  urlLink Gilbert Stuart-like  crafted face, delaying his acceptance of the Democratic nomination for strategic reasons.  Bad fucking move.    Already the Repubican spin machine is playing this little fiasco as another example of the flip floppy Taxachuesetts liberal's indecision and, quite frankly,  lack of a core . Thirty year old bideo tape of an idealist Kerry against the war on Dick Cavett does not an exciting man make. Kerry has not yet found the G-Spot of the Democratic Party, and The Party is getting restless and unsatisfied. Why have a convention without the traditional "happy ending"?  The Republicans have a point . The Conventions are geared like a NASA mission, with the candidate  launched  -- officially and with great fanfare -- on the last day,  in prime time ; a culminating speech without accepting the nomination is, to be sure, a zipless fuck.  urlLink The NY Times observes :  "If he goes through with the idea, Mr. Kerry would still give a culminating speech amid the traditional pomp and circumstance of his party's convention here in late July. But he would formally accept his nomination at about the time President Bush does at the Republican convention in New York in early September, aides said.  "Such a move could offset what otherwise might be a severe financial disadvantage for Mr. Kerry under the arcane rules for the public financing of campaigns. Both he and Mr. Bush are planning to use federal funds in their general-election campaigns, and thus will be limited to spending $75 million apiece on television commercials and other expenses in the fall.   "But that spending cap kicks in at the moment a candidate is nominated by his party or on Sept. 1, whichever comes first, according to federal election officials. And with the Republican convention pushed back this year until Aug. 30 to Sept. 2, Mr. Bush has five more weeks in which he can spend an unlimited amount of money, while Mr. Kerry has to make his $75 million allowance last that much longer.  "'Think about it,' said one Democratic strategist who spoke on condition of anonymity. 'You're John Kerry. You're raising more money than any Democratic candidate ever has, you've just this last month out-fund-raised a sitting president of the United States who's a record-breaking fund-raiser himself, and despite all of that, the clock is ticking on when you can spend that money, and you know that for more than a month, you're not going to be able to use it. It would be self-crippling not to keep raising money as long as you can.'"  It would also be crippling, we cannot fail to note, if the Republicans began to attack Senator erry, who, increasingly, is allowing his campaign to appear  stagnantly Al Goresque  while he is out whoring for his campaign lucre. The Republican spin machine can characterize Kerry as being entirely a creature of strategy and compromise and, we must not fail to note, however regrettably, " urlLink The French Connection ."   In : On a lighter, fruitier, Chateau D'Yquem note, According to  urlLink Ananova , via  urlLink The Sun , " urlLink Keira Knightley  has admitted having cosmetic surgery.  " The Pirates Of The Caribbean  star has confessed she had treatment to give herself a fuller upper lip, reports  The Sun .  "The 19-year-old actress's treatment is similar to that which gave Leslie Ash her infamous 'trout pout'."  Which is understandable considering that those loveable Brits sometimes are -- how does one say this gently --  deficient in the smackers ?  Comment here or on  urlLink VH1's Best Week Ever Blog , where I have been known to post.   Out :  urlLink Yodel-rockers: The Darkness . And I must say that this is one of the more  disgusting , anatomical-biological stories I've ever blogged on, so,  uhm , if you have eaten a meal in the past 10 minutes or are in the process of digestion of some repast, you might want to  skip this one over . That having been said, according to  urlLink Ananova , via  urlLink The Sun :  "The Darkness frontman  Justin Hawkins  has had to undergo surgery in order to save his voice from his own stomach acid."  ( The Corsair  dry heaves)  "The flamboyant singer was forced to cancel a series of dates on the band's US tour earlier this year because of health problems.  "Hawkins told  The Sun : 'I had a hiatus hernia and acid reflux. Basically, there's a sphincter inside your throat, as well as up your bottom. It's supposed to control how much acid is let up into your throat.  "'But mine was broken so my stomach was spitting acid into the throat. It was literally burning my voice up.'  ( The Corsair  nods, knowingly, mouthing the words  'that yodel' )  "Doctors warned that if he didn't have treatment, he was in serious danger of losing his voice.  "The singer added: 'Doctors stuck a tube down my nose to measure the acidity. Three per cent is normal. They operate at 12%.  "'But I clocked a whopping 82%. It was one of the worst cases in medical history. I was taking indigestion tablets to stop it. But they weren't working. So I had to go through with the procedure."  "Although his voice is now permanently cured, Justin has been left with marks from the operation."  And we, who read this story, also have been left with marks, no less acute, though less visible.   In :  urlLink California . Say what you will about  Arnold Shwarzenegger : his  urlLink 16 year old mistress , the  urlLink hookers , the steroids ... Arnold did what he said he was going to do and the  Democrats failed miserably at doing : and California is looking better,  urlLink much better . Upgrade to Ca-lee-forn-ee-a, and the Governator. Now, go get annudder "ploh-jahb" from another ambitious young actress in the trailer.   Out :  urlLink Michael Moore wins the Palme D'Or in Cannes . Didn't you know that  urlLink he was going to win , though? His second win in as many years. The anti-administration politics, the buzz, the French. I actually loved  Roger and Me , and will see this film as well. But it was just so political and I believe Cannes should be about the Global Arts,  you know , honoring films like  urlLink Wild at Heart ,  urlLink Cries and Whispers  (my favorite fucking movie in the universe),  urlLink 8 1/2 , and  urlLink Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon . How many years in a rown has it been that political films attacking internal United States culture have won the Palme d'Or?  And I'm a moderate and I notice this.     In :  urlLink A royal wedding in the rain . What could be more elegant.  urlLink Reuters reports :  " urlLink Spain's Crown Prince Felipe  has married former  urlLink television presenter Letizia Ortiz  in a glittering ceremony symbolising a new dawn for Spain two months after the deadly Madrid train bombings.  "A torrential downpour began as Letizia entered Madrid's  Almudena Cathedral  on Saturday for the capital's first royal wedding in nearly a century.  "But the rain did not dampen the spirits of tens of thousands of well-wishers straining for a view of the couple or watching the ceremony on huge screens in central Madrid.  "'Letizia, take this ring as a sign of my love and fidelity to you...,' the prince said, at one point forgetting his lines, during a televised ceremony beamed to a billion people worldwide."  Sunshine is for amateurs, it is when a marriage can endure the rain that it can last a lifetime. Congratulations to the royal couple.   And also  In :  Jeff Zucker ,  urlLink getting monster buzz from the Observer :  "Last week, after 39-year-old Jeff Zucker was crowned president of the newly merged NBC Universal Television Group—now the biggest broadcasting company in America—the only question remaining for the NBC loyalists under Mr. Zucker’s management was: Why stop there?  "'I think Jeff would settle for President of the United States,' said  urlLink Lawrence O’Donnell , a writer for NBC’s  The West Wing , talking about Mr. Zucker’s insatiable ambition. 'He might take a rest after that.'"  "But Mr. Zucker would not respond to the call to duty.  "'Luckily for the United States of America,' he said on Tuesday, May 19, 'we’re not going to find out.'"  He might want to try a pharamceutical for that self confidence problem.

       Neil Strauss and Courtney: On Picking Up The Skanks    urlLink Former boytoy/walker  of The Gray Lady,  urlLink Neil Strauss , a low grade piece of ass, to be sure, has some rather acute comments on his general desireability in his infamous  urlLink New York Times Sunday Styles piece on picking up skanks , which, sure enough, augurs prophetic in his new  urlLink houseguest the embattled Court Love :  "Though I am not bald, to say that my hair is thinning would be an understatement. I have indentations on either side of my forehead, which I like and believe add character to my face, though I've never actually received a compliment on them. When I look down at my pale, skinny body, I wonder why any woman would want to sleep next to it, let alone embrace it."  (Averted Gaze)  Anyhoo : This paragon of manliness -- an Hyperion to a Satyr --left  The Gray Lady  to concentrate on wifey #2,  urlLink A Young Blond Skank, namely, the porn star Jenna Jameson's biography , which he is "co-writing" ( note to Jenna : Better practice the alphabet in your soup, dear); Strauss is also  scheduled  (anrily grabs  The Cutty Sark ), if that is  urlLink le mot juste , to guest appear in a porn movie, he will be fully clothed,  a nurse . You can imagine the Gray Lady  loved  that idea.  But it was not until our intrepid journalist/rock critic, our  urlLink Everyman , our  urlLink Siddhartha , entered an underground community known as "the community," that his luck with the ladies began to change, his personal philosophy turned inward,  intensified . He begins  urlLink his Odyssey  thusly:   Strauss : "Type 'seduction' or 'how to meet women' into a search, and you will find hundreds of sites trying to part you from your money. But the lucky few, able to wade through enticements to 'meet models now,' may find one of the free Usenet groups, Internet mailing lists or message boards where hundreds of men labor day and night to turn the art of seduction into an exact science."   The Corsair Simultaneous Translator : If a geek like  urlLink Francis Bacon can come up with the scientific method , surely someone has come up with pimpology 101 for geeks.   Strauss : "From New York to London to Croatia — places my reporting took me — many of these men meet off line in groups known as lairs to discuss tactics and techniques before going out to bars and clubs to put their theories to practice."   The Corsair Simultaneous Translator : The Old Gray Lady was my first ho.   Strauss : "It is a world with its own jargon (A.F.C., for example, denotes an Average Frustrated Chump, P.U.A. a Pickup Artist) and luminaries known by pseudonyms like  urlLink Mystery , Juggler and Formhandle. Those who manage to earn the respect of their peers through online postings or real-world prowess can make money writing e-books or running workshops."   The Corsair Simutaneous Translator : The He Man Woman-Haters Club will come to order. First things first: nicknames. Now, who wants to be  Maverick ?   Strauss : "This has given birth to a seduction industry marketed almost entirely through online newsgroups and mailing lists. Some have turned it into a full-time career with six-figure incomes, others into a lucrative sideline allowing them to collect a few thousand dollars here and there."   The Corsair Simultaneous Translator : This, true believer, is the story of how I got Court Love to live with me.   Strauss : "My real-life entry into the community began when I took on a pseudonym and withdrew $500 from the bank, stuffed it into an envelope and wrote ' urlLink Mystery ' on the front — not the proudest moment of my life."  "I took the envelope to the lobby of the Roosevelt Hollywood hotel, where I found myself waiting with two other students (one had flown in from Australia, the other from Canada) who, like me, had arranged to spend four nights on the town with Mystery, one of the most admired men in the world of seduction. Born  Erik von Markovik , Mystery is known for spitting out long, detailed posts that read like algorithms of how to engineer social situations to meet and attract women."   The Corsair Simultaneous Translator : Yes, you were indeed correct. The geeks in math class were dangerous and creepy.    Strauss : "In detailing his social life online, he has single-handedly invented much of the jargon and tactics that men around the world are using to meet women.  "The 'neg,' for example, is his invention. Neither a compliment nor an insult, a neg holds two purposes: to momentarily lower a woman's self-esteem and to suggest an intriguing disinterest. ('Nice nails. Are they real? No? Oh, they look nice anyway.') Mystery cautions online, however, that negging is only for exceptionally beautiful women used to a steady stream of compliments."   The Corsair Siumultaneous Translator : It's all based on "an adaptation of neurolinguistic programming, a school of hypnosis holding that one can communicate with the subconscious through seemingly normal conversation." Hey Court,  urlLink silly dress, silly girl . Hey, why don't you come move in with me?

       Bill Cosby: The Phantom Menace   Something odd happens to the human consciousness once it gets on in years. All that residual psychic goo gets  crystallized . The brain cavity ossifies.  One becomes a curmudgeon . Eccentricity, bitterness, and the art being nasty is your lot: welcome to old age, playboy, your hip will fracture forthwith. Everything was better in  ye olden days , says the angry codger: Mister,  urlLink we could use a man like Herbert Hoover again . Didn't need no welfare state ( Ed Note : My sister,  Elizabeth  and I, BTW, used to think that  Archie Bunker  was crooning on about something called a "wolf estate").    Anyhoo : It was no surprise to me that  urlLink Bill Cosby, EdD  he  urlLink who famously snubbed Wanda Sykes at the Emmy's  showcasing her deficiency in, uhm, the  language arts  to a mortified audeience of her peers.  Cosby's back ...  yes he is  and the old man is downright grumpy; it's like they took away his PicturePages (TM) and left him with an  urlLink Easy Reader (TM ).  urlLink According to Rush and Molloy , old mudfoot hisself was on a tear at the NAACP Brown v. Board of Education gala ( The Corsair  covers his face for the tornado that he knows is coming up):  "NAACP representatives weren't laughing during  Bill Cosby's  remarks Monday night at a  urlLink D.C. gala commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education decision .  Cosby, who was honored for his massive donations to black colleges, had organizers gasping when he contrasted the '60s civil-rights pioneers with some of today's African-Americans.  "'These people marched and were hit in the face with rocks to get an education, and now we've got these knuckleheads walking around,' he declared. 'The lower economic people are not holding up their end in this deal. These people are not parenting. They are buying things for kids - $500 sneakers for what? And won't spend $200 for Hooked on Phonics.  "'I can't even talk the way these people talk: Why you ain't, Where you is' ... You can't be a doctor with that kind of crap coming out of your mouth!'  Note to Bill Cosby,  urlLink he of the busy sweaters : Why you aint remembering the time you did voiceoverwork for a character named  urlLink mushmouth   "Turning to criminal justice, (Cosby) said, 'These are not political criminals. These are people going around stealing  Coca-Cola .

What the hell was he doing with the pound cake in his hand?"  Hey, Bill, old man on a tear, what the fuck is up with referencing the pound cake? Are you hungry? The pudding pops didn't satisfy? Why the fuck is the pound cake of such cosmic import? Is Cosby morphing into Ike Turner?  What?  "Cosby's blunt appraisal left  Howard University  President H.  Patrick Swygert  and NAACP President  Kweisi Mfume  looking 'stone-faced,' The Washington Post reports."

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  Elizabeth Spiers  gets Carter. We love us our dark Lizzie Spiers, the OG of the blogosphere, switchblade at the ready issuing extreme justice ... with prejudice. Today, she puts the oily  urlLink Graydongate story into perspective :  "If Carter doesn't want to be taken seriously as a journalist, this presumably isn't a problem. But Carter's dogged crusade against the Bloomberg administration (despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of Vanity Fair's readership doesn't live in New York and probably doesn't care about civic affairs in Manhattan) would seem to indicate otherwise--and even more so, his recent tirades against the Bush administration.  " urlLink Carter  clearly wants to have his cake (Fauchon, truffle) and eat it, too."  And those pesky National Magazine Awards that Graydon cares so very much about. How does he expect National Magazine Awards if Vanity Fair itself is not taken seriously as a magazine.  The Corsair  will refrain from mentioning the lack of African-Americans on the cover of said magazine.  Thanks Lizzie, for breaking it down.   Out :  Those 70s dorks . That 70s Show is just the right thing to watch after midnight, when you've just come back from the bars, or clubs, drunk, with the spins (not that  The Corsair  would know, uncomfortable silence). But Those 70s "stars" (ahem) are not so  urlLink copacetic ,  urlLink according to the Page Sixers :  "NOTE to celebrities: Ditch your entourages! 'That  urlLink '70s Show'  stars  Danny Masterson  and  Wilmer Valderrama  showed up at  urlLink Bungalow 8  late Tuesday with several drunken guys. One man dressed in a suit took offense when the club's renowned doorman,  Armin , showed the group to a table and placed his hand on the man's arm. The drunk snarled: 'Get your hands off me!' before 'flipping out,' according to the club's owner,  Amy Sacco . Armin quickly subdued the would-be pugilist and tossed out the entire group. 'Danny and Wilmer were great and had nothing to do with it,' Sacco said. 'They were embarrassed by their friend.'"    Pickleheads ! But don't you love how club owners defend stars?  The Corsair , not a star but celestial in appearance and intellectual scope, is  urlLink 86ed  in ever bar and club in Hell's Kitchen and the East Village.    In :  Greg Lindsay . In today's  urlLink Gothamist interview, Lindsay cops to a pretty cool story involving him, David Bowie and Sarah, the Ultragrrrl :  "A few years ago I was leaving work at  Inside.com  with our intern (the infamous  Ultragrrrl ) when we were caught in a sudden summer downpour. We sought a cab on 10th Ave., and while I was hailing one, she pointed to a man on the far side of the intersection and asked 'Is that David Bowie?' She called to him to share our cab, which was headed uptown. He got in, and sure enough, it was him. We played it infinitely cool -- idly chit-chatting, pretending he was just like us, or we like him, or something. We got out first and began jumping up-and-down screaming after the cab disappeared from view. I mentioned this story to one of Ultragrrl's friends a few months ago, and was told she edits me out of the story when she tells it now."   People change , Greg.   Out :  Lapdances , they add up. According to the folks at  urlLink TheSmokinggun.com , those lap dances are murder on the credit card bill:  "Faced with a whopping $28,021 bill from a Manhattan strip joint, a business executive has filed a lawsuit claiming that he was grossly overcharged for a recent lap dance and Champagne bacchanal. In a State Supreme Court lawsuit, a copy of which you'll find below,  Mitchell Blaser  alleges that he is being swindled by Scores, Gotham's leading gentlemen's club. Blaser, 53, was partying with a pal last December and racking up the lap dances and very pricey bubbly (he expected an  American Express  bill in the two grand range). But the club says that Blaser ran up the 28k tab by ordering five magnums of  Clos Du Mesnil Champagne , at $3,200 a bottle, and partaking in hundreds of $20 lap dances. Scores contends that Blaser, chief financial officer for the American division of the giant Swiss Re insurance outfit, signed receipts for every purchase."   Hundreds of lap dances ? That's a whole lot of glitter and baby lotion on the trouser leg, gangster.   In :  urlLink LA.com's blog . Today they write:  "Jeez Louise, will megasuccess mess up certain stars’ heads, or what? Until very recently, this blonde’s every project could be guaranteed to be utter crap. As for her messy personal relationships--honey, let’s not touch them with a ten-foot cattle prod. But when her career nosedived, it seemed the jolt she needed to come back down to Earth. She'd scorched plenty of people along the way with her crazy mood swings, mind you, but when the road got rough, she suddenly acted so nice, so angelic to everyone, many wondered whether she’d turned over a new leaf. (She actually considered selling her old LA manse and lying low in a Hancock Park guesthouse!) Now, though, TV’s given her career a jolt, and she’s gone right back to being a screaming, self-centered harpy spending fortunes on closets full of clothes, fretting about whether she should buy her own plane and gobbling up houses around hers to wall herself into a private compound.

"Images of corpses of people slaughtered in Iraq beamed on to a huge video screen.   "Simulated steamy lesbian sex as Madonna tangos with a female dancer.   "A parade of scantily-clad pregnant women while she sings Papa Don’t Preach.   "One source reveals: 'This show will make people’s hair stand on end. Madonna has pulled out all the stops to make it her most controversial yet. The electric chair scene is breathtaking.'"  Madonna  trying to shock people ? Who knew.    In : Plump Washington Square Park Freaks. According to  urlLink Lloyd Grove , the Apprentice 2 cast hired a wierdo to help them promote Crest in Washington Quare Park yesterday, And things went wrong. Horribly wrong:  "It was, in fact, a disturbing and unnerving scene not calculated to enhance any brand - not Crest, not 'The Apprentice' and not Trump.  "A spy tells Lowdown that after handing out tube after tube of the decay-preventing dentifrice to passersby, the 'Apprentice' team enlisted a plump 51-year-old woman to haul the unsightly empty boxes back to a nearby truck and haul back armsful of sparkling-new boxes.  "For this, they offered her $20.  "As the woman lumbered from the table to the truck and back - 'working her a- off,' says our spy - she was overheard mumbling, "I have to do a good job for Crest."  "After about an hour, she had worked herself into a beet-faced, sweaty daze. At one point she tumbled over and began to roll around on the ground, chanting "Crest! Crest!" over and over.  "'It was just spooky,' said our spy."  ( The Corsair  softly chuckles at the image of a plump freak working her ass off; sips his  Cutty Sark  gingerly, continues reading)  "Finally, while the 'Apprentice' folks stood by watching, an off-duty EMT worker and an onlooker picked up the distressed woman and carried her back to the truck. But as soon as they had deposited her in the driver's seat, she started to shake - 'It looked like she was going into cardiac arrest' - and suddenly passed out cold, falling limp into the passenger side.  "When she finally awoke after a full three minutes, she promptly vomited and demanded, 'Where's my money?'"  I suppose it would be wishful thinking to imagine Trump waiving his short fingers into the Grenwhich Village breeze, standing among the dealers of shwag dime bags of really bad weed, saying, to all those present, in that louche outer-borough accent that reeks of garage sales in Massepequa, "Yer Fiyad!"   Out :  Dennis Hastert : the Speaker of the House is an Ass.  urlLink Hastert, who got out of the war on a bad shoulder, lectured John McCain , who spent five years as a prisoner of war, in a Korean prison:  "" urlLink If you want to see sacrifice ,  John McCain  ought to visit our young men and women at Walter Reed and Bethesda (two Washington area military hospitals). There's the sacrifice in this country. We're trying to make sure that they have the ability to fight this war, that they have the wherewithal to be able to do it. And at the same time, we have to react to keep this country strong not only militarily but economically. We want to be able to have the flexibility to do it. That's my reply to John McCain."   What an ass!   In :  Blogger Drama!   urlLink OldHag is causing mayhem once again . A cyberstalker, one  urlLink KvnJms  (Kevin James?), went after Maud Newton with  urlLink his site Fraud Newton .  The site had all the fragrance of some wierdo shit. Apparently, KvnJms hosted it on the  urlLink Foundation Center's web site . After a spirited discussion, Maud chimed in:  "Hi everyone. Someone I know did the site because he thought it would be hilarious. It didn't make me laugh as much as it made me want to kill myself. It's a pretty accurate takedown of the self-indulgent bullshit I post all the time. I didn't have the nerve to tell the creator that it induced suicidal impulses. He seemed to want me to link to it, so I did.  "Evidently his company was less than thrilled with the traffic and took it down."  Blogger drama!   Out :  Bush Slipping .  urlLink According to TheHill.com :  "Republican members of Congress are growing increasingly concerned over President Bush’s sinking approval rating and the souring public mood over the war in Iraq.   "At the same time, many members say Bush’s poll numbers are also affecting them by coloring public opinion about the economy and other issues more directly linked to their own re-election prospects.       " urlLink A recent Gallup Poll showed Bush’s job approval at 46 percent , the lowest of his presidency, and a  urlLink Zogby International poll earlier this week  put his job approval number at 42 percent, also the lowest of his presidency. Not since  Harry S Truman  in 1948 has a president won a second term with an approval rating below 50 percent."   In :  The Burberry fashion show  benefiting the obstetrics and gynecology wing at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center.   urlLink Jessica Seinfeld and Sloane Barnett  rocked Cipriani last night. Fashionweekdaily quoted Burberry CEO Rose Marie Bravo, "It’s absolutely wonderful. Look at the turn out…it’s amazing. I’m so thrilled we were able to support the hospital and all the great work it does. And the weather certainly cooperated didn’t it? Everybody should go out and buy a Burberry umbrella today."   Kate Betts ,  Pamela Gross ,  Sophie Dahl ,  Princess Michael of Kent  and  Lally Weymouth  (former flame of The Nation's Marxist Alexander Cockburn), among others, noshed on Bellinis and chicken salad alla Cipriani followed by chocolate soufflé with crème anglaise.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  Rena Xu , who writes for  urlLink Monday's Harvard Crimson :  " Carrie Bradshaw , heroine of TV’s  urlLink Sex and the City , famously remarked in the episode where she models for a New York fashion show, 'When I was broke sometimes I would buy  urlLink Vogue  instead of food. I felt it fed me more.'  "As I recently perused my own copy of Vogue over a meal in Annenberg, it struck me that almost every female body featured in the magazine looked as if it had perhaps skipped one too many meals. Of course, this was no novel discovery—the endless pages of endless legs were little surprise. After all, models are almost always expected to fit an unhealthily tall and skinny image. What was surprising, however, was the fact that the pictures of impossibly thin, bikini-clad models appeared just pages away from an article discussing the serious battle against anorexia and bulimia fought by one of the most prominent of these models ..."  Bravo.   Out :  Graydon Carter , beeyatch. The  urlLink oily Vanity Fair editor  has indeed  urlLink become everything he once detested  when he was a clear-eyed and writer in Spy Magazine, after a childhood yearnings of WASP writerly glamour back in  la Canada , eh? Does it really matter that  urlLink Graydon  has done gone and  sold his ass ?  Certainly it does. And  urlLink my nemesis Toby Young  gets it just about right:  "Well, as someone who worked for  Vanity Fair  from 1995 to 1998, I think it does matter. When I first met Graydon in 1993, he was in the pupae stage of his metamorphosis. He'd left Spy two years earlier ( urlLink the New York Observer  came in between), but hadn't quite settled into his new role. He tried to give the impression that, despite being the captain of this Conde Nast flagship, he remembered what it was like to be a pirate. Two years later, when I became a contributing editor, Graydon still prided himself on not being for sale. He was contemptuous of the publicists who clamored for his attention and urged his staff to put all press releases in "the circular file." He made it a point of principle that Vanity Fair, unlike other, lesser magazines, did not grant celebrities copy approval. He encouraged his writers to remain slightly aloof from the world they were covering.  "There were compromises, of course. Sometimes, to gain access to a big star, he had to strike a deal with a publicist and promise to include a less well-known client in the magazine. This D-lister would then appear on the front page of the Vanities section, a slot referred to by the staff as "blond bimbos on the horizon."  "But it would have been impossible to edit the magazine without coming to some accommodations with the PR machine. Within these limits, Graydon did his utmost to preserve the independence of the magazine. He knew he was on the losing side in the battle against the culture of celebrity, but he wasn't about to surrender.  "Now, however, he's in thrall to the voodoo priests and priestesses of the entertainment industry, and Vanity Fair is no more tough-minded than any other glossy magazine. The most embarrassing detail of last week's story was that Graydon recently tried to set up meetings at a number of Hollywood studios to pitch the idea of a movie based on a  Vanity Fair  article by  urlLink Nancy Jo Sales , with himself as a producer. (Graydon had stuck a toe in the water when he was one of the producers of the Robert Evans documentary  urlLink 'The Kid Stays in the Picture.')  Despite the best efforts of his agent, however, only one studio granted him an audience--and passed.  "As the co-founder and co-editor of  urlLink Spy , not to mention an outstanding editor in chief of Vanity Fair for more than a decade, Graydon Carter was a giant in journalism. If he had traded in his professional integrity to become the head of a studio, or even for a three-picture deal, that would have been one thing. But he has sacrificed his reputation to become just another hustler scratching around for scraps from the Hollywood table. I always feared he would sell out eventually. I just thought he would have commanded a higher price."  I did as well.   In :  The Lindsay Lohan breast augmentation theory  got a, uhm,  boost  from that significant cultural artifact  urlLink The National Enquirer , which writes:  " Lindsay Lohan  is busting out these days. And it's not just thanks to the 17-year-old's hit movie, Mean Girls. 'There is no question in my mind that she has had breast augmentation, and I think the results are very good,' Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Dr. Wallace Goodstein tells Star. 'It looks like she has saline implants, which have taken her from a size A or small B to a size C or small D. The bigger breasts look very natural, which is what surgeons aim for,' adds Goodstein, who does not treat Lohan. When contacted, Lindsay's rep  Leslie Sloane Zelnik  laughed it off, saying she's 17 and still growing. But Star got a second opinion anyway. 'What you see is what you've got,' says New York-based cosmetic surgeon Dr.  Geoffrey Tobias . "It would seem to be obvious... that she did have breast augmentation.'"  Or, as they might say at  urlLink Whatevs.org ,  so obvs .   Out :  urlLink Grown men running around Central Park in diapers ? Say wha?  What the fuck ? Blogger, please.    In :  urlLink Polly Jean Harvey's new video, The Letter  (link via  urlLink Stereogum ). The Corsair likes his women like he likes his coffee: strong and dark.  urlLink PJ Harvey , dancing in her black dress by the window in the night is an image that sexily haunts.    Out : Travel, unless, of course, you can make it into a performance art, like Massimo Redaelli has. According to  urlLink Fashionweekdaily , "I’ve become an expert on traveling.  My trips are the ultimate in performance—they are all calculated down to the minute.  And everything is done to maximize my time, since traveling is just a waste and loss of valuable time."  "...Massimo Redaelli has the kind of action-packed, glamorous life that puts most corporate execs—not to mention bona fide jet-setters-- to shame.  As International VP of IMG’s European Fashion division, this Italian-born 38-year-old is traveling non-stop between London, Paris, and Milan, but thankfully, he’s mastered the art of the high-end, hassle free viaggio.  He’s got British Airways' 'Special Services' on speed dial (no ticket or passport lines, thank you very much), two sets of Vespas parked in London and Paris (the quickest way to make an airport connection), an impossibly chic wife ( French Vogue’s contributing editor  Masako Kumakura ) whipping up authentic Japanese meals for him at his enormous  Avenue Victor Hugo  apartment in Paris, and a supremely well-connected 'roommate' in London (art curator Alannah Weston, whose daddy owns  Selfridges  and  Fortnum Mason ).  Basically, Massimo’s on a non-stop, never-a-dull-moment ride that takes him from the well-appointed boardrooms of Milan fashion giants in the morning to power lunches mid-day to the hottest table at London’s  Cipriani  restaurant for dinner."

       Best of The Corsair   It's a slow week, what can I tell you. The DC-LA-NY power nexus is about as exciting as John Kerry's campaign. So, if you are new or not-so-new to this blog, I'll serve up some pipin hot Best of ... back when there was actually interesting news going on:   urlLink The Corsair takes on Al Sharpton on SNL    Oh yes  (devilish grin widens,  The Corsair  rubs hands together) ... oh yes. The funniest guy at the otherwise regrettable Democratic Party debates is taking his shtick  up in Lorne Greene's bitch . The stars are all aligned in forming a cosmic happy face. The wise men are coming from the east bearing gifts of  Frankincens e and  Myrr . It's Christmastime in the city and on Saturday Night,  urlLink Al Sharpton  is going to help us all get a laugh on.   " Paris Hilton ," report  Rush and Molloy , "who has canceled all interviews, will join guest host the Rev. Al Sharpton and musical guest Pink on Saturday Night Live." So much the better.   That's right : Al Sharpton's hosting that countercultural Baby Boomer  strong hold Saturday Night Live; and, coincidentally, his own pimp hand is also  strong .  The Corsair  is salivating at the thought of Harvard Lampoon writers trying to not trip over themselves writing for the Reverend, who needs little help in cracking up an audience.  There are so many ways we can go with this:   "11:32: Opening Skit. Flashback: Sharpton debates patrician Senator  Daniel Patrick Moynihan  (played deftly by Darrel Hammond) for Senate in 1994. A rhyming Sharpton engages in (makes Italian hand gesture) " the dozens ," while Moynihan, in vain, tries to steer the debate towards  urlLink Iatrogenic Government . Hilarity ensues.  "11:40: Al Sharpton medallion skit. The secret origins of Al's eye-catching medallion. Apparently it has come down from from an ancient African civilization of hustlers. The medallion imparts the gift of gab and  urlLink is powered by solar energy .  "11:50: Al Sharpton: The Early Years. Driving around in "Tha Drrty South" doing doughnuts late at night with  James Brown  in parking lots. Hair coiffing techniques are discussed.  urlLink Mobb Deep's Violators  plays sinister-like in the background.  "11:55: Weekend News. Anchors  Tina Fey  and  Jimmy Fallon , telling Sharpton jokes, are interrupted by ... a slow walking ... upset ... you got it:  Rev Al Sharpton ! Oh no, they didn't!  "12:05:  President Al  Skit: What would happen if Al Sharpton won the Presidency? Pink Performs "Get The Party Started" at the Inauguration, as Al gets his boogie on,  Harlemworld-style . Shuttle diplomacy over to solve the East Coast /West Coast gang friction; Al uses linkage, and a  urlLink thorough knowledge of the balance-of-power-politics . Al brings peace to the Middle East by chatting up his love of  James Brown's  early music, drawing a bipartisan sing along ending with Sharon and Arafat joinging together for a stunning rendition of " urlLink Hot Pants ." Al Sharpton marries a gay couple ( Maya Rudolph  and  Rachel Dratch ) in the White House, and brings together both left ( Amy Poelher  in hippie garb) and right (Jimmy Fallon in an evangelical preacher garb, wet from baptism)in a sermon on that funny thing called  love , over some down home  urlLink Sylvia's soul food  ("love is like ...  urlLink this pickled Okrah ", "preach it Al,").  "12:10: Pink performs. Sharpton, drunk on attention, does back up vocals on ' urlLink Hooker'  uninvited. Pink is not impressed.  "12:30:  Paris Hilton- Al Sharpton  tape surfaces, making the rounds at office Christmas parties. On tape Al is shown answering his cell phone and posing lewdly for the camera. Al tries to escape the media spotlight by heading home to Harlem, unfortunately, guys on 116th Street accost Sharpton for "getting with a girl that don't have no ass."  "12:45: Reality show. Al Sharpton must spend a month in  The Hilton's  world, attending premiers, walking past the velvet rope-- scantily clad. Sharpton must hold Hilton's teacup chihuahua  Tinkerbell . Moral of the story? In the end, a teary eyed Sharpton confesses that 'a kid from the streets ... cannot manage this much papering.'"  "1:00: Signs off with a pajama party reading  urlLink Twas the Night Before Christmas  to Pink and Hilton."   urlLink Tim Robbins Versus Tucker Carlson   In this month's  urlLink InStyle Magazine , tough guy lefty Tim Robbins does his best to appear all lighthearted and superficial. I mean, what better place to look vapid and harmless than in InStyle, which features, among other things, serious discussion about "Cindy Crawford's smouldering glam eye makeup" and "Colorful Yoga Bags." What the fuck?!   Anyhoo : The Timster almost pulls it off. Almost. The thimble deep magazine has the timerity to asks him about bowties ... and something goes horribly awry. Never ask Tim Robbins about bowties. He gets emotional. Gauntlets are thrown. See for yourself:   Tim Robbins : Bowties are for waiters   Robin Sayers : That's not what (Crossfire's)  urlLink Tucker Carlson  thinks.   Tim Robbins :  Tucker Carlson  can kiss my ass.   ( The Corsair  ponders the hugely disturbing visual for a moment, then resumes blogging)    urlLink The Zenith of the 80s   It is my theory that the 80s ended when Rob Lowe, playing Billy in St. Elmo's Fire, got on the greyhound at the end of the movie. More on "The Fire":  "Riding his bike in the pouring rain to a delightful uptown (DC) dinner party, (Emilio Estevez) presses his soaked nose to the windowpane, sucking in every inch of (Andy McDowell's) coltish beauty. Unable to restrain himself, he crashes the do, squelches in and approaches (her). She turns and drawls, 'How are yew?' His agonized reply: 'I'm obsessed, thank you very much.'    urlLink Figuring she's the kind of gal  who's turned on by a high roller, he uses the home of the Korean lobbyist he's working for to throw a loud, lurid party in her honor. When she fails to show, he tracks her all the way to a ski lodge where she's, of course, weekending with a concerned medic. She tries to let him down gently, saying she's flattered, whereupon he grabs her and lays a big deep sucking kiss on her.   "This has the effect of transferring his infatuation. She's left shivering in the snow, her womanhood awakened. He speeds off whooping and punching the air in triumph."   Jonathan Bernstein ,  urlLink Pretty in Pink .  When did the 80s end?  "Somewhere in  urlLink Secret History Donna Tartt  says rightly that the magical weekend always officially ended with the  urlLink Wonderful World of Disney , at 7pm on Sunday night. That's when one did one's homework. Officially the 80s ended the moment Rob Lowe gave Demi Moore his  urlLink St. Elmo's Fire speech . The decade ended when Billy intoned: "This isn't real. You know what it is? It's St. Elmo's Fire. Electric flashes of light that appear in dark skies out of nowhere. Sailors would guide entire journeys by it. But the joke was on them. There was no fire. There wasn't even a St. Elmo. They made it up. They made it up because they thought they needed it to keep 'em going when times got tough. Just like you're making up all of this. We're all going through this. It's our time on the edge." Just like that with that gravelly world-weary voice: it's our time on the edge. And with that, the 80s abruptly ended as Billy took the Greyhound bus out of Georgetown with his loaded six string on his back. Lowe always knew that you leave a party while the gettings good: look at how he exited the West Wing before it  urlLink jumped the shark .   urlLink Who is Ron Mwangaguhunga?

       New CEO For Chateau D'Yquem   "How can I convince you what you see is real  Who am I to blame you for doubting what you feel  I was always reachin', you were just a girl I knew  I took for granted the friend I have in you   "I was living for a dream, loving for a moment  Taking on the world, that was just my style  Now I look into your eyes  I can see forever, the search is over  You were with me all the while"   urlLink Survivor, The Search Is Over     According to  urlLink Fashion Wire Daily , Chateau D'Yquem is getting a new CEO:  "Luxury goods giant LVMH, the main shareholder of Chateau d'Yquem, has appointed Pierre Lurton CEO of the most legendary dessert nectar on the planet.   "Chateau d'Yquem, consisting of 250 acres producing just 500 bottles per acre of intense, delightfully luscious sauternes, was classed as an exceptional premier grand cru in the famed classification of 1855.   "Though taking over at d'Yquem, Lurton will continue to manage the estate of Cheval Blanc, the Saint-Emilion class A premier grand cru, once described by wine connoisseur  Hugh Johnson  as, 'delicious young, and lasts forever.'"   When did  The Corsair  first encounter Chateau D'Yquem? Oh yes, it was 1990,  The Corsair  was a freshman at college, dating a classmate who introduced said young man to the light and fruity pleasure in a Sheep's meadow on a misty Southern Vermont Spring afternoon (where are you now, I wonder, Maura). She had been saving it for just such an occasion. And now it is impossible to disentangle the Spring of 1990 with that bottle we shared, and what came after.    The Corsair  encountered it again, years later, in Annapolis, Maryland. His tatses had become more refined and so he enjoyed it all the more so. It reminded him of what he was, and what he had become.  Congratulations to  Pierre Lurton , the new helmsman of a brand that holds such good memories for so damn many Corsairs (drains glass in one sitting). And to the Spring of 1990.    (I  know  .. it's been a slow week)

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In : Ladies and gentlemen: Heeeere's ...  urlLink Viscountess Grace Jones ,  slave to the rhythm  (Grace is our  second favorite  sassy mamma, the first being, of course, the queen of sass herself,  urlLink Oldhag ). Is there even such a thing as a British peer of African descent? Don't they disown people for similar social misdemeanors (averted gaze)?    Anyhoo ,  urlLink according to the style wonks at British Vogue , "super-icon GRACE JONES is courting the ultimate fashion status symbol - a title. Party boy and social commentator  Nicky Haslam  is telling anybody who'll listen that the 56-year-old Amazonian actress is planning to marry his cousin,  urlLink Viscount Ivor Wimborne . 'A final date hasn't been set, but Ivor is as in love as ever,' Haslam told  urlLink The Daily Telegraph , adding that Jones had already ordered her dress and a  urlLink Philip Treacy hat  for the big day. 'It's unusual to sort out the dress before the date, but that's Grace,' he went on. 'People have been saying they'll marry at his home in Northamptonshire, but it wouldn't surprise me if they got hitched somewhere really hip instead.'"  Grace is about 20 years older than the 35 year old aristocrat, and she has been married three times previous. Her milkshake pulls all the  urlLink boys in Debretts .    Out :  Justin Timberlake . Frankly,  The Corsair  lost all interest in Timberlake when he ran away from the  urlLink Janet Jackson nipplegate  flak like a true punk; he lost all his street cred, his pimp juice. But  urlLink The National Enquirer says , and enquiring minds really do want to know, that Justin turned down an autograph for two ten year old kids who had worked up the courage to ask him for the better part of their dinner:  "The girls -- both under 10 years old -- plucked up their courage to ask Justin for his autograph as the couple ate dinner at  Dakotah's  restaurant in Delray Beach on April 30.  "But they were crushed when the handsome pop star snubbed them! 'Justin was so involved with Cameron that he just said no when the little girls asked him,' a source told The ENQUIRER."   Now  ... was that Justified? Justin Timberlake ...  urlLink gets the gas face .    In :  Vasaline , that viscous petroleum jelly, so very in; at least according to the wags at  urlLink TheSmokinggun.com :  "Meet  Robert Chamberlain . The 44-year-old Virginia man was arrested earlier this month and charged with felony criminal mischief for damaging a Motel 6 room in upstate New York. But Chamberlain, who has spent time on the pipe, wasn't breaking windows or throwing the television off the balcony. He was nabbed for slathering Vaseline on every single thing in Room 205--mattresses, pillows, sheets, furniture, carpeting, blankets, the TV, etc. A motel clerk discovered the damage after Chamberlain checked out and called the Broome County Sheriff's Office. When Deputy  Kevin Smith  arrived, the greasy m.o. rang a bell--a couple of weeks earlier a room at a nearby Super 8 was also apparently slimed by Chamberlain (though the owner declined at the time to press charges). A check of Room 205's trash turned up 14 empty containers of Vaseline, drug paraphernalia, cocaine residue ..."   ( The Corsair  shivers) I'm sorry,  I just can't continue  with this story in this vain. I was dreaming when I blogged this, forgive me if I go astray.   Out :  urlLink Jimmy Fallon made his last appearance  on SNL, and is now headed out to the world of film, cautiously, like the fox, or  urlLink le renard in French .   urlLink According to Page Six :  "The cuddly comic played down his heartthrob image by turning down big roles in teen movies (he was offered the  Josh Hartnett  role in '40 Days and 40 Nights,' for example) in favor of smaller parts in  urlLink Woody Allen's 'Anything Else'  and  urlLink Cameron Crowe's 'Almost Famous .' Last Saturday's show, co-hosted by  Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen , was Fallon's last. 'Being a cast member on Saturday Night Live was a childhood dream come true,' he told (Page Six)."  ( The Corsair  follows the reasoning closely) Fallon resurrects the dying SNL brand; burns no bridges in the process, cultivates a hearthrob image, and moves from small parts from indies on up. ( The Corsair  nods, a  urlLink Machiavellian  smile procedes along his African face)  Smart .   In :  Catwoman , the impending biggest bomb in the history of film.  urlLink Scott Stereogum's pimp hand is strong , and his crystal ball is clear as to the portents of the future. You know when you saw that  urlLink freaky tumor-like catwoman mask on Halle Berry , with the tits and ass revealing costume (and how is she supposed to deal with the criminial element in that outfit?), the shark was circling her career, ominously, with the  urlLink John Williams Jaws soundtrack growing louder . Someone call homeland security,  Catwoman is a bomb !!   The Palestinian Liberation Organization is sending people over to study the mechanics of catwoman for further research.   okay, enough (although I could go on forever)   Out : April Lavigne is not cool ( The Corsair  shakes his head and makes  urlLink the gasface ). Never has been, probably never will be. But  urlLink Amy Poehler's  impression of the angsty angry grunge rocker is very very cool;  urlLink it's so choice , I highly recommend it. Apparently Lavigne realizes that she is quickly becoming a joke and is nipping it in the bud,  urlLink according to Ananova , it was all a case of bad nutrition:  " Avril Lavigne  says lyrics in her songs were angry because she was eating the wrong kind of food.  "Lavigne, who is currently promoting her new album,  Under My Skin , says she was 'eating bad stuff, lots of sugar and carbohydrates, junk food all the time.'  "The Canadian singer added: 'It makes you very irritated. I spent some time with a nutritionist and learned I had low blood sugar. Now I eat accordingly.'"   In : Sure,  urlLink Naomi Campbell  is the skankiest girl in all the world (averted gaze), but when has that ever stopped a man in l'amour (goes to the window, looks out listlessly, melancholy)?  She is so round .. so firm .. so .. urlLink  fully packed .   Anyhoo :  urlLink her 34th birthday party for 800  of her closest friends sounds like our cup of tea.  Obvs .  urlLink According to Hello!:   "Invitees – who have been instructed to wear red or white – will jet into the celebrity hotspot for the three-day party, which will include a show by famed performance troupe  urlLink Cirque du Soleil . Few other details about the extravaganza, which is being organised by the catwalk star's friends and family members, have been disclosed, but Naomi has revealed she'll be wearing an exclusive gown by  Alexander McQueen .  "While many models might be coy about getting older, the sexy British cover girl, says she has no problem with the number of candles on her birthday cake. 'I'm 34 years old and proud of it,' she declared. 'I never lie about my age.'"  I'll forgive the fact that she has  Cirqu du Soleil  at her party, which is really tacky, for the fact that she is  so goddamned hot , she lies in beauty ... even in her skankitude.

Here are some highlights:  " Star Magazine :  Burt Reynold's  centerfold in  urlLink Cosmopolitan's April 1972  issue was hot! What did he think of it?  " Helen Gurley Brown : He said we kept him from having a great movie career -- I think that was a little ungrateful of him!   " Star Magazine : Why did you choose him for the inaugural spread?

" Star Magazine : Do you think Cosmo readers would like to see  Donald Trump  bare all?  " Helen : I don't think people would mind seeing him naked.

       The Republican Party Spiderweb Snares Kerry    Damn , the Republican pimphand is strong,  urlLink according to TheHill.com . Extreme competition develops some master strategists, with layer upon layer of Machiavellian intrigue covered by  urlLink Metternichian machinations , enshrouded in rich  urlLink Richliieuesque trappings . According to TheHill, the Republican strategy extends into the Senate, and making Kerry look bad there,  urlLink Geoff Earle writes :   "The one-vote defeat of an extension of unemployment benefits last week has sparked fear among Democrats that Republicans have developed a legislative model that will cast Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) repeatedly in a bad light before the election.  "The extension needed 60 votes to pass in the Senate, and 12 Republicans made sure the final tally was 59-40, with only one absentee, presidential candidate Kerry.      "At least one Republican senator,  urlLink Elizabeth Dole  (N.C.) (Ed Note: sugarlips), was prepared to switch to a 'no' vote to make sure the measure was defeated even if Kerry returned to cast his vote, a Democrat charged.  "Even if Dole had stood firm, observers on both sides believe the GOP leadership would have been able to turn other Republicans to ensure defeat.  "But by calculating the vote to a nicety, the GOP managed to make Kerry appear to be responsible for the defeat because he was a no-show."   Evil genius.  One can almost hear the laughter of Henry Kissinger over his flabby flesh roasting in  urlLink Dante's inferno .

       Smackdown: Dick Morris vs Bill Clinton   From  urlLink Behind the Oval Office , by  urlLink Dick Morris  p. 64-5:  "At about midnight, (then Governor Bill)Clinton joined Hillary, Gloria Cabe, his campaign manager, and me in a cozy breakfst room off the kitchen. My polling (for a 1990 gubernatorial reelection fight) showed that McRae offensive (Bill's ooponent) had dropped Clinton's share vote to a meage 43 percent. Generally, when an incumbent's share of the polls dropped below 50 percent in the polls, it means he is likely to lose ... Clinton's temper got the better of him. Exhausted, worried, and angry, he exploded. 'You got me into this race,' he screamed, 'so you could make some extra money off me. That was the only reason. And now you give me no attention, no attention at all. I'm about to lose this election, this primary, against a nobody' ... Clinton has a terrible temper ... In pain and facing that harsh criticism, I lost my temper too. If he was too hasty in his criticism, I was too sharp in my reply. Storming out of the breakfast room through the kitchen toward the door outside, I rallied, 'Thank you, thank you, thank you. You've just solved my problem. I'm getting shit from Atwater and shit from Lott for working for you, and now I can solve my problem. Go fuck yourself. I'm quitting your goddamn campaign, and now I am a free agent. I can be a fifty state Republican and don't have to take your shit.'  "Clinton charged up behind me as I stalked towards the door, grabbed me from behind, and wrapped his arms around me to stop me from leaving. I slipped to the floor. Hillary helped me to my feet. The moment I stood up Clinton became apologetic. 'Don't go, don't go I'm sorry. Don't go, I;m sorry,' he said as I walked out the door, slamming it behind me.. Hillary ran after me to calm me down. She put her arms around my shoulders and walked me around the grounds of the mansion. "Please forgive him," she pleaded. 'He's under so much pressure. He didn't mean it. He's very sorry. He's overtired, he hasn't slept well in days. He's not himself. He values you. He needs you,' she repeated.  "I calmed down enough to drive to my hotel, and I called Eileen (his wife) shaking in rage. Later Hillary called to tell me how much Bill wanted me back. Then he came on line to apologize ... I couldn't leave Clinton three weeks before his primary, but from then on I dealt with him in a formal, almost frosty way. I stopped calling him Bill, always adressed him as Governor, and left when our meetings were over rather than hang around and chat."

       Best Of Corsair   We have some new readers, so I'm going to recycle some of the better posts I've made over the past six months:   urlLink RZA is Crazy    The Corsair  has many media obsessions but one of his favorites is  RZA . The RZA is crazy. Nutso. He eats ungodly amounts of colloidal silver, even proffering it to his offspring need we say more?   One day RZA and  urlLink his babies are going to turn blue  from a colloidal silver overdose and then people will take me seriously.  Anyhoo : here's what he had to say to FHM:   FHM : How strong is your Kung Fu?   RZA : "Strong, but I've never used it. One of my uncles trains CIA agents. He was offended I was learning from someone else, so he showed me this one move. He said, 'I could cripple you.' I believed him but he had to prove it. I was hurt for three months."  Okay ... leaving aside the implausibility that one of RZA's uncles is in the intelligence gathering business, how many people out there have familial relations that whisper  urlLink Moon Knight-like  threats. Being family is not about crippling one another. The interview concludes:   FHM : Is there an RZA sex tape out there?   RZA : I don't leave evidence like that. I form the lense with my hand, look through it and tape record with my mind.  What-the-fuck?!   urlLink Trump Loves Pennies   "I'm not a big fan of the handshake ... I think it's barbaric, shaking hands, you catch colds, you catch the flu, you catch this, you catch all sorts of things." If you identified Donald Trump as the author of this oft-repeated riff then you are dead on.  The trouble is that it doesn't mesh with a comment he made to FHM in the March issue. Check out this slice:   Trump : If I see a penny on the sidewalk, I always pick it up, because, psychologically, I want to do that."   FHM : Seriously?   Trump : Absolutely. I do it all the time. That's the way I am.  Okay, leaving aside the fact that this is utter and complete bullshit, lets zero on the whole penny-hygiene thing. Donald Trump, worth, roughly $2 billion bending over, ass akimbo, picking up Abe Lincoln's from the gritty expectorate laden Midtown streets. And yet he will not shake hands?  Priceless.   urlLink Samuel L. Jackson's Subway Nightmare   In the March 2004  urlLink FHM Magazine ,  Samuel L. Jackson  tells this harrowing tale of the  urlLink evil subway . A "very special" Corsair:  " I was riding the A train late at night. I was getting off the train and there was a woman in front of me who had some shopping bags, and one broke. I stopped, very un-New York like, and helped her pick up her stuff. When the door closed, I had one foot in the subway, and one on the platform. Luckily for me I was in the last car. As the train took off, I was snatched off by my feet and my body twisted, ripping all the shit in my knee. I was dragged along, dodging the poles and I couldn't get my shoe off. Eventually somebody pulled the emergency chord which stopped the train. I didn't find out until a year later when I was in court that the reason it took so long to pull the chord was that the guy who did was on crutches."   urlLink That was Steven Brill All Over   From  James Cramer's  autobiographical  urlLink Confessions of a Street Addict , on mini mogul  Steven Brill :  "(Brill) never did know when to quit, though, and could not bear to lose at anything. At the firm's summer outing at Brill's Westchester mansion, he divided us into teams, placing us in his pool, and insisted we play a vicious game of water polo where dunking was encouraged and expected. He relished the contact, being a head taller than just about anyone else on the opposing squad, including me. Just as I was about to score what would have been the tying goal for my team, Brill  sank his teeth into my throwing arm , spouting blood into the clear water in a steady stream. As everyone looked on in horror, I could only laugh. That was Steve all over."   The Corsair  is currently in the fetal position, knees touching his pronounced cheekbones, rocking himself back and forth, mumbling over and over again, "the New York media will be the end of me..."   urlLink The Corsair's Remote Control Tour Diary   There are over 500 cable channels nowadays, so who better to give you a tour of some of the major ones?    Anyhoo : 500 channels means "niche marketing." And with all those niches, things can get confusing as to what is being marketed. So,  The Corsair  will help the viewer through the wonderful world of cable with these pithy explanations, In Media Res:   TNT : Lousy with Middle aged Testosterone. A musky-smelling channel. Bruce Willis and Steven Seagal action flics and basketball. Big in New Jersey.   CNN : Used to be a channel for Kings and Queens and heads of state, but of late it is the channel for cranky retired people with an angry opinion on everything political ("Those libs are holding up Medicaid!"). Poor CNN: They used to wine and dine with kings and queens, but now they are laying in the gutter eating pork and beans.   Lifetime : A channel earnestly devoted to the smouldering resentments of Midwestern housewives. Husbands are to blame in most of these story lines. Anger is the predominant emotion. Hollywood has not been kind to  Nancy McKeon . Hell hath no fury like Joanna Kearns scorned!   Family Channel : The channel devoted to Christians in a nuclear family with a conviction that human history has a purpose beyond this world. Halleleuia. Lots of Mary Kate and Ashley films, which, ironically, attract a very different sort of crowd than the ones that these cats are aiming after.   CNBC : This channel serves as "White Noise" for the various strip joints in the Wall Street and financial district vicinity. As your Bud Fox-like trader with a "Lawng Island" accent sips a Stoli on the rocks on his lunchbreak, sniffing his "Bolivian white Powder" ("Vitamin C"), getting a "friction dance" from his favorite "dancer," he can look over her shoulder, casually, and catch a brief glance at just how the markets are doing, and get a gauge on when he should return to the office.   A&E : An elderly folks network with lots of Murder, She Wrote, and "original" films like "Horatio Hornblower," for viewers who can remember their glorious years of service in the British Imperial navy policing those hectic colonial ports.  ( urlLink more Remote Control Tour Diary )  Tyson versus Wesley Snipes  Tyson vs Snipes  "One night after (Mike Tyson's girlfriend) Hope had visited MT (Mike Tyson) in his LA apartment, he told me to follow her. She had left earlier than usual, telling him that she had to visit a friend. He wanted me to find out where she went, if she made any calls, if she talked to anybody, everything that she did after leaving him that night. So I grabbed the black Lamborghini Diablo and kept a safe distance ... At Roscoes, a soulfood hangout in downtown LA, she parked, got out of the car and walked over to a black Lexus ... her friend turned out to be actor Wesley Snipes.  "(Tyson) was paging me. I called him back to let him know the situation ... Less than ten minutes later, he pulled up in a yellow Testarosa, accompanied by a new bodyguard Anthony Pitts. Anthony was a former professional football player, stood about 6'7, and weighed in around 250. Tyson jumped out of the Ferrari.  "...When Hope caught sight of him, she practically fell out of Snipes lap and onto the floor. The actor froze then waved a hand"'Now, Mike, now, Mike, we can do this together. I dont want no problem.  "'Let's go into the bathroom!' Tyson snapped.  "When I returned from the parking lot, I noticed Anthony was blocking the bathroom door. A couple minutes later we heard a big noise inside, and then Tyson emerged alone.  "After he was gone, I cracked open the bathroom door. Wesley Snipes was sitting against the far wall, head tilted to one side, unconscious (italics mine)."   urlLink The Inner Ring , by  Rudy Gonzalez , p.58-9   I suppose Time Magazine's Joel Stein is an  urlLink okay kind of guy . I've never met him. He seems to have a bit of a wit, however dry, for someone who works at Time Magazine, the world's capitol of gravitas and all that. In the end, there is nothing wrong with Joel Stein that a robust multivitamin couldn't remedy. But what was he thinking when Trio TV gave him the  urlLink gig of a lifetime ? I mean, who wants to watch endless hours of Battle of the Network Stars?  I mean, seriously, who even watched Battle of the Network stars back then, when  Telly Savalas  and  Gabe Kaplan  had juice? Not me: and I was ever the hip 6 year old. Who loves ya, baby?  Now, If  Laura Zalaznick  of Trio Tv called  The Corsair  tommorrow (call me, Laura, call ...  me  ...) and asked: What low budget high quality shows would you program for  Trio TV ? Remember, we only have a fraction of the network budgets, but we want high quality. I would say: Laura, have you ever read my blog? I am all about low budget high quality.   Anyhoo : These are some of my picks:   urlLink Dummy . Gritty 70s drama of urban social decline -- thanks,  Ed Koch ! Asshole! Koch turned NYC into a Guns n Roses video, with Mr. Brownstone creeping around Central Park in a raincoat with nothing on underneath. Get this plot, though, peeps: LeVar Burton plays a deaf and dumb mute who is framed for the death of a prostitute ( Kuta Kinte , you are a  framed  man!). But will we get justice from the man? Will a young Paul Sorvino get him redemption when he cannot even communicate with his client? Or will "Dummy" just become another urban statistic on the Koch street? Despite the overall bleakness, this a very, very cool social commentary.   Mast erpiece Theater :  urlLink Last of the Mohicans . No, not the cheesy Michael Mann MTV video with Daniel Day Lewis and Madeline Stowe giving florid, overproduced romance. No, this one was the real deal. The French and Indian War, my little pomegranates. Colonial wars involving trappers and Native Americans dressed in coonskin and caribou, muskets at the ready. The Massachusetts Bay Colonizers and what not. Dodgy alliances, snow and muskets -- we're talking the French and Indian War, people, work with me here. The drama, fo' shizit. For some bizarre reason the Masterpiece Theater programs made in the 70s -- arguably the best programming of all time -- languish in someone's vault, uncherished and unsung. American history geek? (raises hand sheepishly) "adsum".   urlLink Alice : I've always wondered if this was a comedy or a tragedy, or perhaps that significant 70s artistic construct, the "dramedy." Single mom who sings Bradway showtunes working to support her kid in Arizona on diner tips. Fuck! I'd imagine that singing "There's a New Girl In Town" ought to get those coffee refil tips rising into the stratosphere, like an Irving Berlin tune, out there in  Phoenix . I'm sure the serial killer truck drivers on their way to the Pacific Northwest on one hours sleep, a thermos of coffee,  a gullet full of crank  and a meat cleaver at the ready are really up and around to hearing broadway medley's at Mel's Diner, no? ... No   Better yet,  Alice Hyatt , thou repository of Standards of the Great White Way, stick with Florence "Flo" Castleberry's crafty encomium: a leathery oversexed outlook on truckstop flings and a pipin hot "kiss my grits!" to the cheapskates.  Imagine if that show were pitched nowadays. Only  David Lynch  would finish such a scenario. Without the laugh track,  Alice  could be an American drama drenched in pathos, like Dreiser's Sister Carrie. Take away the laugh track, throw in some creepy Lynchian music, and you've turned a dramedy into Americana horror. Alice would end up on nthe evening news and Lil Tommy would be shackin up with dingy Vera faster than Mel could re-lard his pork chops. No ... Alice doesn't live here anymore.  Don't even get us started on the great  urlLink Vic Tayback  (god bless his clogged arteries) banging the pick up bell with his spatula, like the true character actor he was (it's those little flourishes, which i like to call "Taybacks"). Dating those seedy Phoenix chicks well past their expiration date. Americana horror is the genre. May Mel Sharples rest in a greasy kind of peace. Pink uniforms, ah, Mel, read much de Beauvoir?   Rich Man Poor Man : Observe  Nick Nolte  before the fermented grape robbed him of his  marginal  looks,  then again , there is charm in Nolte's whiskey ravaged grim visage. If Nolte can be a star then so, dammit, can anyone. Earns props for Teachers, though. He counts.    urlLink Poldark : This cult British tv series is quite habit forming. Incredible. Just incredible. A period piece that is a cross between  Wuthering Heights , the  Mayor of Casterbridge  and  Le Liaisons Dangereuse . You get sucked in to this costume drama that is one part soap opera and one part high art.  Assorted Good Times episodes: Come on, you know you had a crush on Wilona when you were kid, don't you; or, if you were a girl, Bookman the janitor was your long cold drink of water. What, you never saw a black man doing a John Wayne impression, pilgrim? And you know in your heart Wilona saved Janet Jackson from falling down the elevator shaft trying to escape her mom who beat her with a hot iron just before she became Willis' girl, then Cleo on Fame, then Ms. deBarge.  The one where Michael gets drunk off some dodgy "health tonic" was a classic ("Get Vita Brite and sleep tonight ...*passes out*). The there was the time Michael joined a gang. Oh, what about the one where Thelma almost married this bigamist Nigerian. Crazy! What about that pimpy guy "Lennay," who always sold hot appliances from out of his coat. So was the episode when James has hypertension. So was ... hey ... was this a comedy or what?  Cinema Paradiso. The best work of art on friendship I've ever encountered. A glorious film.   Fellini's Satyricon . A pagan work. Un-be-fucking-lievable. The Rablasian Fellini walks us through Roman antiquity as imagined crossed with a science fiction movie. There can never be anyone as Felliniesque as Fellini.   The Big Blue Marble : My favorite show as a kid, if you must know.  Carl Sagan's Cosmos: Okay, so in the madcap world of astrophysics Sagan's hypotheses are probably all outmoded already. Right? So what? So is Ptolemy's Almagest, and yet I still read it in college. The provocative thinking is worth another looksie. This series was the bomb! (looks around sheepishly, then raises hand, "question: who is the PBS geek"?)Classics do not get outmoded.   Chespirito. This show was a mystery to me: Why would a grown Latin man want to go on tv dressed like a bumble bee with a big "CH" affixed to his paunch. Subtitle it and put it on Tri. We'd all like to know what the people on that endless laugh track find so funny.  Stoned, the Afterschool Special with Scott Baio. "Super Stoned Jack," was the scariest introduction that most of us had to the world of the sweet leaf. If I were stoned I would never go out in a row boat. Well, not after seeing this little chestnut. Put it on Trio so we can all laugh at the "reefer madness." Just say yes.  Fame the TV Series: Why are there not repeats on VH1 of this show already? When you say low budget and high quality I think .. right here's where you start paying for it ... with pain ... and sweat. The show of young, artistic people struggling for their moment to shine is about as American as it gets. Whatever happened to that sexy cello player who wouldn't give anyone the time of day, Lori Singer.  Cries and Whispers by Ingmar Bergman. If Black Stallion is the most beautifully shot film, then this is number two. All natural lighting. Bergman uses a fade to red to seperate scenes, mimicking the inner membrane of our eyelids. About as fucking intense as art can get. And halfway through this film about communication and treachery and time past, Bergman dissolves a reconcilliation scene with a Bach Sarabande in the most mysterious way.   Schoolhouse Rock: That Figure Eight. Mysterious, melancholy and mathematically instructional. Time will never again be so mundane. A strong influence on The Corsair's childhood.  The Black Stallion: Those fabulous Coppollas! This is perhaps the most beautiful filmed movie ever.  The Gore Vidal-Bill Buckley Debate-Fight It was in the heart of the 60s: it was the polarized political center of the 60s. The left and the right clash violently on national television. A classic. I just finished reading Vidal's Burr. Excellent.  Woody Allen's Teleplay: Don't Drink the Water. One of the most interesting experiments on television ever. Woody Allen directs and writes a teleplay starring Michael J Fox and the kid who played Blossom. Shaky handheld camera follows a grown Michael J. Fox as slowly becomes involved with the much younger woman. Sound familiar?  Kramer vs. Kramer. The first dramatic statement of the Baby Boomers. A film of the first water. Young married couple breaks apart. Wife leaves shallow workaholic husband and baby. Goes out West. Comes back revitalized. Husband fights custody. Bach and Vivaldi heighten drama. And the courtroom scene where Meryl Streep slowly dissolves into tears and forced composure are among the best acting you will ever see.  Okay, so those are some of my Trio picks. And you have to admit it is a hell of a lot better than Battle of the Network Stars.

       The Sopranos Dream Episode .   This episode rolled out like a Fellini film, like  urlLink Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries . According to the  urlLink HBO site , it describes the dream like this:  " ... At the Plaza, Tony gets a voicemail message from  Silvio  that's as chilling as it is succinct: 'Angelo's gone.' While the old consigliere was out buying a big wheel for his grandchild, he was shot to death by  Phil and Billy Leotardo . Suddenly Tony realizes why Tony B. was so agitated. 'I saw him this morning and he must've fuckin' known already,' Tony says over the phone to Paulie.  Tony B.  and Angelo became close friends in prison and Tony B. loved the old man like a father. Fearing the worst, Tony makes several more phone calls in an attempt to locate his cousin, with no results.   "Eventually, Tony settles in for the night. After availing himself of the services of an Asian call girl, he finally manages to fall into a fitful sleep. He has a long dream peopled with important individuals from throughout his life and culminating in an encounter with his high school football coach,  Mr. Molinaro . In the dream, Tony points a gun at Coach Molinaro, who berates him for the company he keeps, the life choices he's made and his lack of preparedness. When Tony pulls the trigger, the gun's silencer goes limp; he pulls it again and the clip falls out. Just before he wakes up, Coach Molinaro tells him, 'You'll never shut me up.'"   Psychic trauma, Asia motif, dream: up until this moment, Tony has been getting ready for the big bang, the upcoming gangland bustup that will either validate all his mother's critiques of his masculinity and his ability to be effective in the world, or invalidate them, freeing his energies up. Perhaps I'm reading too much into this (probably), but could the Asian call girl symbolize the East, and Eastern non-linear thought (the entrance into the realm of dream)?   Coach Molinaro , like most of the characters in the dream (although, for the life of me, I don't know what  Annette Benning  means -- wife of  Warren Beatty ? Tamer of the male libido run amock?), accuses Tony of not being "man" enough, squandering his leadership abilities. And the horse ( whores?)  that Tony rides in on while visiting Carm ("we need to set up some ground rules ... I don't want to clean up after it"), is the symbol of Wild West Americana manhood, like the tv show they were watching, which, most probably, saturated his childhood.  The camera angle is always in an odd relation between Tony and Carm. Remember when he almost threw her in the pool after she drained it in passive-aggressive protest at his penurious ways with child and spousal support? Tony towered over her, like he did while on the horse, like  urlLink Fellini's women tower over him .   Scrooge ? To Carm Tony is, withholding money, withholding affection; but it looks like Tony will get back to her, just in time for the bust up with  Johnny Sacks  and the much anticipated Adriana whack job, whih looks like it may occur next week. They will both see the light. But if Tony is Scrooge, is  urlLink Carm Tiny Tim ?  And is Tony the Frankenstein monster that the crowd made him up to be? Like  urlLink Janice  last week when she threw down on the soccer mom? Janice tried to suppress her hostility in anger management, to not be a monster, to hold on to her marriage: but Tony let the monster out, and was happy.  But isn't  depression rage turned inward , as Melfi might say. The Coach says, "You'll never shut me up," like the Reverend at the end of Bergman's Fanny and Alexander, who, beyond death, continues to haunt Alexander (Bergman).   What do you think?

       Hail to the Sheath   According to  urlLink Wonkette  via  urlLink The Sun ,  Alexandra Kerry , the 30 year old daughter of likely Democratic Presidential nominee  John Kerry , wore an ultra sheer, revealing see -hrough dress to Cannes.   urlLink According to The Sun :  "THE dishy daughter of US Presidential candidate  John Kerry  certainly gets our vote.  "Brunette  Alexandra Kerry  left movie fans gasping at the Cannes Film Festival in her daring see-through dress.  "Film director Alexandra, 30, showed at least two reasons why Americans should vote her dad into the White House in November.  "Democrat Mr Kerry is hoping for a good showing at the polls. His girl is content with just a good showing."   urlLink Hail to the sheath !  Comment here or at  urlLink VH1's Best Week Ever   Seriously, though,  Alexandra Kerry  was at Cannes not to simply show off her cans, but to  urlLink promote her short film , "The Last Full Measure," her film. Cannes, that jet set mecca, is a place well known over the years for gorgeous women dressing flimsily in order to promote their projects. Hey,  Works for me.

       Meet The Press: Cue to Dead Sea (Dead Air); Or, Emily Get Out of The Way   On yesterday's  Meet The Press , Secretary of State  Colin Powell's  assistant, a woman named  "Emily" , got a little bit frisky with the cameras on the show of NBC's Chief Washington Correspondent,  Tim Russert . Bad move. Tim Russert hasn't been snubbed since before he worked for  Senator Moynihan ,  Russert owns DC .    urlLink Courtney C. Radsch of The Old Gray Lady  characterizes the Sopranoesque dream sequence-like appearance of  Colin Powell  on  urlLink Tim Russert's Meet the Press  thusly:  "Secretary of State  Colin L. Powell  was abruptly cut off during an interview on Sunday on the NBC News program 'Meet the Press' when one of his aides decided the interview had gone on long enough.  "As Tim Russert, the program's host, began to ask his final question, the camera unexpectedly panned away from Mr. Powell, who was being interviewed in Jordan via a satellite link from Washington. In the confusion, Mr. Powell could be heard saying, 'He's still asking me questions,' to which a woman's voice answered, 'No, he's not.'"   urlLink The article concludes :  " Betsy Fischer , the show's executive producer, identified the staff member as  Emily Miller , deputy press secretary to Mr. Powell, and said Ms. Miller 'pulled the plug' without warning. Although the interview was taped in advance, she said such interviews were usually run without being edited. Mr. Russert called it a case of 'press management gone berserk.'   "'I've been doing this program for 13 years and nothing like that has ever happened,' he said in a telephone interview. 'I remember sometimes in countries around the world this happens, but not in America. This is a free press, and political figures can always say I don't want to answer.' He said he did not know if it was the content of the question that caused Ms. Miller's reaction or simply that the interview had gone over its allotted time.   " Julie Reside , a State Department spokeswoman, said the interview had gone on considerably longer than scheduled, and that the personnel there 'made every attempt to get NBC to finish up.'"  Clearly, Emily was a bossy child, and, as in the case of Secretary Powell, her universe just sort of ignores choleric outbursts and odd decisions. One wonders how Emily reacted to lifes little vagaries as they came up, in the fullness of time, during the course of her life:   Doctor : Alright, you're having the baby --  push!   Emily Miller : No, she's not.  Mrs. Miller : (with averted gaze, pushes)  **   Teacher : Class: repeat after me: Two plus two equals four.  Emily Miller : No, It does not.  Class : (averted gazes) Two plus two equals four.  And so on.

He was named Friday as one of 159 delegates and 24 alternates from Ohio at the convention July 26-29, when  Sen. John Kerry  is expected to be nominated as the party's candidate for president.   "'We welcome all delegates,' said  Jennifer Palmieri , Ohio spokeswoman for the Kerry campaign."   Evidently.    The article concludes, interestingly, "Springer is considering running in 2006 for either Ohio governor or for the state's other Senate seat."   Out :  Seacrest--Out! . According to that significant cultural artifact,  urlLink The Star : " Ryan Seacrest  is very upset these days -- (Ed. note  The Star's ) source says his TV talk show,  On-Air with Ryan Seacrest , was canceled last week. (The Star's) source went on to tell (The Star) that Fox network execs were very unimpressed with Seacrest's ratings and were waiting for something to 'you know, pop!' But nothing happened -- 'his show is not a hit,' says (the) source. (The Star was) told execs called Ryan to their offices the week of May 3 and broke the news to him. 'He really thought the show would eventually take off -- he felt that at any minute, he was going to fly,' says my source. As a result, (The Star's) source says, Ryan has been taking out his frustrations on the cast members of his other show,  American Idol . (The Star hears) his pals are just giving him some space to vent and get used to the bad news."   Seacrest--Out!    In :  JK Rowling .  urlLink According to Ananova :  "J K Rowling says she's 'well under way' with the sixth Harry Potter book.  "She took time off during her new son David's first year but is now back on track.  " urlLink On her website , Rowling, 38, says: 'Book six is well under way, hooray, although I still have a large and complicated book on my desk to remind me what happens where.  "'I am really enjoying this book, though for the first time I am conscious that I am approaching the end of the series.  "'So much of what happens in book six relates to book seven that I feel almost as though they are two halves of the same novel.'  "Rowling also teases fans by saying that regular visitors to her internet page will be able to find snippets of information on book six on the site 'if they can work out where to look'."   Out :  Thinking Different . An Apple Store employee couldn't recognize  Ed Bradley . This comes from  urlLink Gizmodo :  "So I'm geeked to go buy a brand new Apple 23-inch display on a sunny New York Friday, on my way to the Apple Soho store. I enter and wander around looking for one of the aloof Apple drones to lower themselves to take my money. Finally I snag one and I'm given a card with some writing and told to stand and wait for the unit at the register. As I walk up, I come upon some Apple customer dissing in progress ... Holy smoke, yep, '60 Minutes' anchor Ed Bradley is an Apple fanatic! ... I walk up for my turn, and the really cute, but really clueless cashier is still looking at his back like he's an ass. I go, 'Yeah, that's Ed Bradley.' She says, 'Who's that?' I say, 'Uhhh, one of the most famous journalists on the planet on the most famous new program in the world ...

       Dweezil and Lisa Loeb: B-Listers on the rocks    urlLink According to the AP , rock music skank couple  Lisa Loeb  and  Dweezil Zappa , who had the ultimate B-List romantic-television food show synergy, have gone the way of the dodo:  "Loeb told  AP Radio  that she and Zappa recently broke up, and that it was just time for them to go their separate ways.   "She said they had a good run with their  urlLink Food Network show this spring , but they had only intended to do one season anyway."  The rock couple had been seen  urlLink all over  the  urlLink red carpets . And, according to  urlLink John Matsumoto of the Merc :  "'When (Zappa and Loeb) were on stage, we would play songs from the album, and we would have a friend come up on stage and make pies,' says Loeb, who vaulted to prominence in 1994 with the No. 1 ballad 'Stay (I Missed You).' 'It was a combination of a food demo and a concert. It was a totally sensory experience. The audience would even get samples of pie and cake at the end of the show."

       Kissinger: Nixon Was Loaded    Never elect a nerd the president . They can't handle the power. Their glands overwork, they miss thier favorite Sci-Fi channel programs, and their brains overheat, like  urlLink Wyatt and Gary in Wierd Science  (so ably played by  Anthony Michael Hall  and  Ian Michael Smith , thank you, thank you ... ).  urlLink According to the Associated Press , Nixon, during the elaborate maneuverings and countermaneuverings of the Watergate hearings and unfolding scandals, uhm -- how does one say this delicately? -- he got  plastered .   urlLink The Leader of the Free World was getting quietly "tight" :  "Five days into the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, with the superpowers on the brink of confrontation,  President Nixon  was too drunk to discuss the crisis with the British prime minister, according to newly released transcripts of telephone calls.   " urlLink Henry Kissinger's  assessment of the president's condition on the night of Oct. 11, 1973, is contained in more than 20,000 pages of transcripts of Kissinger's phone calls as the president's national security adviser and secretary of state — records whose privacy he had guarded for three decades. The National Archives released them Wednesday.   "They show the powerful adviser trying to manage world crises even as Nixon's presidency teetered from the Watergate scandal that would consume his administration in August 1974.   "In October 1973, U.S.-Soviet tensions were peaking over the Arab-Israeli war, and British Prime Minister Edward Heath's office called the White House just before 8 p.m. to ask to speak with Nixon.   "'Can we tell them no?' Kissinger asked his assistant,  Brent Scowcroft , who had told him of the urgent request. 'When I talked to the president,  he was loaded .'"   Deep Throat? Try  Deep Liver.  Ka-Pow!   And that's not all , pookie: apparently Nixon, ever playing the macho, Yorba Linda alpha male in charge of a superpower ( The Corsair's  averted gaze suggests feigned detatchment), according to  urlLink The Washington Times ,  joked about nuking Washington :  "Transcripts of telephone conversations with U.S. President  Richard Nixon  reveal he joked about dropping an atomic bomb on Capitol Hill.  "The disclosure emerged in the transcript of a discussion in March 1974 between  Al Haig , then White House chief of staff, and Henry Kissinger, then secretary of state, the Washington Post reported Thursday.  "'I was told to  urlLink get the football ,' Haig told Kissinger less than five months before the president's forced resignation.  "'What do you mean?' asked Kissinger, who had called Haig to express concern the president might unwittingly unleash a Middle East war with his new, get-tough policy against Israel.  "'His black nuclear bag,' replied Haig. 'He is going to drop it on the Hill.'   "The exchange is among 20,000 pages of transcripts of telephone conversations Kissinger deposited in the Library of Congress in 1976 with the stipulation they remain secret until at least five years after his death.  "Kissinger turned the transcripts over to the National Archives in February 2002 after being threatened with legal action by the National Security Archive, a nonprofit group that campaigns against government secrecy."   What the fuck?  Ka-pow!  Post here or on the  urlLink VH1 Best Week Ever blog    Ed Note : We are taking a well needed break from blogging and the day job for the Memorial Day weekend to recharge, see you back here, guys, same bat time, same bat channel, on Tuesday.  ka-pow

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In : Are  Enrique Iglesias  and  Anna Kournikova  ...  married  ... and  pregnant ? According to  urlLink Ananova , via  urlLink The Daily Star :  " The Daily Star  reckons Anna is already pregnant following a 'secret' wedding five weeks ago.  "The couple apparently revealed they were married while walking along Miami Beach.  "A passer-by noticed Anna's huge pink diamond ring and congratulated them on their engagement.  "Enrique reportedly replied: 'That's old news. We were married five weeks ago.'  "That would have been around the time the couple were pictured in Bali on a holiday that the Daily Star now thinks was their honeymoon.  "And the paper says a friend was spotted rubbing Anna's tummy and congratulating her during a recent dinner in LA."  So, either Anna's preggers or Enrique might want to have a real personal conversation with that "friend," who  amplifies on conversational points  by rubbing his fiance/wife's belly.   Out :  Princess Michael of Kent , according to the  urlLink addictive Page Six , is so very out:  "The Pushy Princess, as she is known in Britain, had been trying to launch a career in the United States along the lines of  Sarah Ferguson's  successful efforts with endorsements and children's books.   "But yesterday — following her outburst at  Da Silvano , where she told a talkative table-ful of African-Americans they should 'go back to the colonies' — her publicist,  Dan Klores , dropped her as a client."  Bravo to  Dan Klores .    In :  Ambition  -- but has it ever been "out"? A cynic might describe daily social existence as the clashing of the trajectories of egos in ascent. And there is no man more ambitious name among the boldfaces than  Andrew Cuomo , Our Great Enemy, he who reeks  of testosterone, thwarted statewide office, and the seedy mantra: "restoration of family honor ..." against the common good:  The Cuomos . Fuckers, all. They never quite knew the right dance moves,  urlLink if you know what I mean . Andrew just couldn't hold on to the Kennedy trophy wife, he couldn't refrain from naming her lover in the papers, he just couldn't parlay a sub-Cabinbet housing position into his dad's old job. Always the rushed energy, that kinetic frenzy, that in a better, wittier and more nimble player might result in the realization of  urlLink fortuna .   There was never any good old Italian planning  urlLink a la Machiavelli , with Cuomo, never a sense of pacing and slow progression -- his opera was all  urlLink presto  and no  urlLink andante .  Mario, who sired that sloppy clan of climbers, could have run against  urlLink Bush The First , he could have been a  urlLink Supreme Court pick  under Clinton ... but he didn't quite have the vocabulary down pat. Spin it as Hamlet on the Hudson, if you will, but, at the end of the day, we know the truth: we know Mario forgot his jockstrap at home and couldn't really play with the big dogs. Fo shizzle.  And, similarly so with his son Andrew, who  urlLink smarmily cost H Carl McCall  the chance at being the first African-American governor with a quixotic primary run, which weakened McCall to the point that  urlLink Bill Clinton himself had to intervene, asking The Smarmy One to drop out . I fucking hate Andrew Cuomo's ambitious ass.   urlLink Page Six lets us know  that the ambition still runs in Cuomo's veins, but what goes around, it appears, comes around:  "LOYALTY only goes so far in politics. Andrew Cuomo is believed to be positioning himself to run for state attorney general, assuming  Eliot Spitzer  decides to vacate the post to run for governor.  Mark Green  and Westchester Assemblyman  Richard Brodsky  are also said to be eyeing the AG job. But now there's another potential candidate,  Charlie King , who was Cuomo's top aide at HUD and his running mate for lieutenant governor when Cuomo briefly challenged  Carl McCall  in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. When people ask King how he dares to run against his former boss, King cockily replies: 'The question is, will Andrew dare to run against me?'"   There is justice in the universe.   Out :  The Monica Bag has been Lewinskied .  urlLink According to British vogue :  "THE Monica bag may be a thing of the past.  Monica Lewinsky , who launched her handbag line in September 1999, seems to have given up on it.  urlLink TheREALMonicainc.com  is said to be 'hibernating while designing for next season' and is currently announcing to all users that 'no one is in customer service either', while msnbc.com reveals that Henri Bendel in New York, 'no longer carries that line.' On launching the bag line, the former White House intern announced to the world via her website that designing had helped her through the dark days when her affair with the then  President Clinton  erupted into the world's press. 'Reawakening my creative senses has helped me cope during an almost unendurable time in my life,' she said on her website. 'As I have learned from this extraordinary experience, I hope that you recognise the importance of being free spirited with your creativity.'"   Creativity?   In :  Tom Sizemore.  Tough guy. Former fiance to Hollywood Madam  Heidi Fleiss  got a dressing down from  Bobby D  recently,  urlLink according to that significant cultural artifact, The National Enquirer :  "Tom Sizemore has a surprising guardian angel  Robert De Niro . Sizemore, the star of 'Black Hawk Down,' has been down in the dumps over recent run-ins with the law, so the veteran Oscar winner talked to him, hoping to straighten him out.  "The 39-year-old actor landed in hot water recently when he reportedly tested 'dirty' for methamphetamine use."   The Corsair  grabs a bucket of salt free popcorn and sits at his screen rapt.  "The Los Angeles City Attorney's office filed a notice of probation violation against the troubled actor -- who still has to serve a minimum of 90 days for domestic abuse against his former girlfriend, infamous Hollywood madam  Heidi Fleiss .  "Sizemore's lawyer insists his client's drug test yielded a false positive -- possibly triggered by a medicine prescribed by his physician.  "But 'Analyze That' star De Niro analyzed his pal's problems and decided to give him some advice, revealed an insider. The two met on the set of "Heat" in 1995 and have remained close.  "'Robert took Tom for a drive and gave him a stern talking to,' divulged the insider.  "'Bobby asked him to seriously consider what the heck he was doing and what ramifications his negative actions would have on his life.  "'De Niro said: Tom, what are the odds of becoming a movie star? Especially a guy like you.'  "'Tom knows he's not box office beautiful like  Brad Pitt . He's got a gravelly voice and odd features. He used to wake up at 5 a.m. to take a New York subway to work -- where he'd cut melons for corporate breakfasts!  "'De Niro told him he was beyond lucky to have gotten as far as he had -- and he shouldn't throw it all away. Basically, he told Tom he was blowing it.'  "Sizemore confirmed to a reporter: 'Bobby De Niro talked to me when I was having problems. He said you're going to ruin your life, your health ... if you don't stop doing this stuff.'"   Out :  urlLink Poopy Girl . Gawker covers the sad, sad tale of a girl who drank a little too much at the office party. It's a cautionary tale:  "Be prepared for one of the funniest stories you will ever hear.. [MAN'S NAME] just told me over the phone and this is completely factual because my roomate [X] was there and witnessed the whole thing..  "[WOMAN'S NAME] currently works for some advertising firm and this week they have the whole industry attends a bunch of these big parties held by each of the major networks because they are trying to attract more sponsors, etc... Let me get this straight (these parties are huge and have tons of celebrites and stuff) so even the newspapers cover these fiestas..  "Anyway, guess who gets so drunk, sh*ts themself and is carried out on a stretcher from one of the Fox Networks parties in Central Park last nite.. If you are thinking of our class representative who sends an update on what every geek from [SCHOOL'S NAME] is doing and has an enormous cranium, then you are correct. At least she is making [SCHOOL] proud.  " ... I have also been informed that everyone in the industry has been talking about this the entire day and [WOMAN'S NAME] is as popular as  Ashton Kutcher  in Hollywood circles nowadays ..."  Working in the media is such a bitch, no? If she were a paralegal, we could prolly put just  get beyond this  and move on. Now the poor gal will most likely leave New York. Sad, but  very very funny .   In :  Dick Morris . Say what you will about this Francophile with a predilection to whores, he makes acute political observations.  urlLink His latest column  examines the recent history of fundamentalist Arab terrorist groups and how they insinuate themselves into the democratic elections in their Western enemies:  "The terrorists have always shown a proclivity for participation in the democratic process by distinctly undemocratic means. From the bomb that shattered the prospects of the favored and ruling pro-Aznar Party in Spain to the terrorist attacks on the West Bank and in Israel that doomed the Labor Party and inaugurated Benyamin Netan-yahu’s party in Israel, the terrorists are well aware of the political implications of their mayhem on democratic elections. They follow the polls and time their interventions with a skill any American political consultant would envy.   "Their capacity to disrupt elections in the United States was evident in the destruction of President Carter. Furious at the former president for sheltering the Shah of Iran, the Iranian militants seized American hostages and used their more than 400 days of captivity to make Carter appear even weaker and more vacillating that he was. Only when the Georgian was soundly defeated did they finally consent to the release of the hostages, ending the crisis along with the Carter presidency.  "Now it is evident that the terrorists in Iraq are trying to do to Bush what their Shiite  brethren did to Carter. By manipulating the pace and ferocity of their guerrilla war, they are moving the poll numbers in America more surely than the combined efforts of the Kerry campaign and his allies in the 527 community. If George Soros himself were orchestrating their timing, it could not have a more profound effect on the U.S. election campaign.   "Since the Iraqi terrorist offensive started in earnest, Bush has lost 15 points in job approval and 10 points in the head-to-head vote share. And still counting."  wow.   Out : Saks Fifth Avenue and Macy's, after The Corsair's favorite socialite,  urlLink Miu Von Furstenberg gives us the scoop :  "Apparently women in New York City have something else to worry about while shopping for lingerie (other than the touchy feely lingerie sales people). Local a news broadcast stated that Saks Fifth Avenue and Macy's, had tried to resell returned undergarments. Ew ew ew. Personally I don't think that lingerie should be able to be returned at all.   "Spokeswoman  Elina Kazan  said Macy's does not sell worn undergarments and posts signs in changing rooms that intimate apparel should not be tried on for size on top of bare skin.   "'We train our associates to inspect the merchandise upon return and if in salable condition, return it to the sales floor,' she said. 'Any items that are soiled ... are not returned to the floor.'  "Saks did not return calls for comment."  To which,  urlLink Miu concludes :  "I know where I'm not buying my lingerie from."

       Macaulay Culkin, the $17 Million Man    How cool is Macaulay Culkin ? The Culc is Kool and the Gang with The Corsair, even if he did have  urlLink a rather dodgy relationship with Michael Jackson . But we'll just pretend it never happened. Like make believe. Check out this interview from  Rolling Stone , June 10, 2004:  "'I have all the F.U.M that you could ask for,'  urlLink Macaulay  says. That's 'Fuck You Money.' Culkin's bank account amounts to an estimated $17 million. So, he emphasizes, his recent return to acting has not been for cash or fame -- he has a surplus of both. He had fully intended for his retirement to be permanent, after Ric=hie Rich, in 1994, but realized that acting was fun and it came naturally to him. He likes the idea of making one good movie a year."  An indie actor who has no ambitions beyond making interesting films? How cool is Culkin? (sips his glass of Cutty Sark)This cool:  "... If somebody came to Culkin and told him they were thinking of taking their kid on auditions, would he recommend it? 'It creates a very odd dynamic if the kid starts getting paid more than you,' he says. 'In my case, it took a couple of years to get over being the family breadwinner. I was lucky. I was on the auditioning circuit for only about a year. But you see some jaded twelve year olds .."  One can only imagine ... How come  urlLink Paper  hasn't had this guy on the cover? And The New York Times done a Sunday Styles article on him. You heard it here folks: Mac Culkin is officially cool.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  urlLink Richard Simmons  is so very, very  In . Or, should I call the curly haired darling "Milton," because, according to the court papers released,  Richard Simmons'  real name is  urlLink Milton Simmons  (I know, I'd change the name too,  baby pop ).  Remember, he was arrested in some dreadful fiasco involving the bitchslapping of some wrestler:  "Arrested in March for (bitch) slapping a  Harley Davidson  salesman/ex-con/cage wrestler at an Arizona airport,  Richard Simmons  is now officially in the legal clear. A misdemeanor assault charge against the diet guru, 54, was dismissed last Friday by a Phoenix judge, according to the below Municipal Court records. The dismissal came as part of a 'misdemeanor compromise' requested last week by slapee Chris Farney and signed off on by the city prosecutor. Such a compromise can include monetary compensation for the victim, but Simmons's lawyer,  James Nesci , declined to say whether Farney, 23, was paid. Earlier this month, Farney told TSG he had hired a civil attorney to look out for his interests, adding that he had not decided whether to sue Simmons over the March 24 incident. We're guessing Farney opted for a little green instead of a protracted litigation that surely would have dredged up his rap sheet and the nearly three years he spent in prison for an aggravated assault conviction (a buddy was seriously injured when a drugged-up Farney crashed his car). Simmons was busted following a confrontation with Farney ... at the Sky Harbor International Airport. The trouble started when Farney (6' 1" and 255 pounds) spotted Simmons (5' 7", 155 pounds) and called out, 'Look, Richard Simmons. Drop your bags, let's rock to the 50's.' According to a Phoenix Police Department incident report, Simmons responded by walking over to Farney and announcing, 'It's not nice to make fun of people with issues.' He then slapped Farney in the kisser. The motorcycle salesman then called the cops, who popped Simmons for assault."  (Averted gaze)  Alright , now: if chubby little 'Milton'  sashayed  over to me in his poom poom shorts, brillo pad of hair waving in the wind, with malice in his eyes, saying what he said, wouldn't you,  if you were a wrestler , block the shot and  rock his universe ? I'm talking ka-pow, right in the noggin. Pop, lock and block, Mr. Farney; do your thing, handle your bidness,  don't be fucking preposterous . And don't tie up the court system with your  frivolous shizzle . Just recognize a player when you see one.    Out :  Graydon Carter , at least  figuratively , according to the folks at  urlLink Fashionweekdaily.com  is out:  "Coast to coast, Times to Times, everyone is calling for Graydon’s head. Well, they won’t get it. But at some point, we all know one day Graydon will ride down those Condé Nast elevators, get into his Town Car, and ride off into the sunset—or onto Sunset.  And he might even get his own Oscar. But don’t fret, Condé Nast HR—we come to your rescue with  urlLink The Daily Graydon  poll.  "Between today and June 15th, when you all will have recovered from your Memorial Day mimosas, Daily readers are invited to submit their Graydon replacement candidate in a brief paragraph (which, around here, means a one-liner) to editor@fashionweekdaily.com. On June 15, we will delight you all by publishing your entries. (Don’t worry  Arthur Carter , we keep everything anon. You just can’t vote twice.)"   The Corsair  would like to nominate VH1's  urlLink Michael Hirschorn , one of the coolest guys in the room. Should he want to step away for a moment from his fast-moving career at Viacom TV, Michael would be perfect at VF.    Page Six's   urlLink Richard Johnson  and  urlLink Christopher Buckley  and even  urlLink Harry Evans  would also be my top picks.   This could  easily  be the next media party game. Too addictive. I see  urlLink Choire  is angling for  urlLink Susan Sontag .  Sweet.   But won't that cause some frisson between her and  Annie Liebowitz , who dumped Susan for the nanny (averted gaze), and who often does cover shoots for VF? Or maybe Choire is setting up some scoops for himself.   In :  Fabian Basabe , writer at  Details , the magazine for -- wink, wink --  metrosexuals , and other like minded men who fancy, uhm,  excessive grooming . You'll remember the well scrubbed Fabian as  urlLink the dude who drrrty danced with hottie presidential daughter Barbara Bush , she of the steely intelligent gaze (a rarity in the Bush family). According to  urlLink Fashionweekdaily :  " Fabian Basabe , the 'It Boy' who’s provided tons of fodder for gossip hounds, is switching teams! The 26-year-old social scenester will be writing a piece for Details magazine, the  Dan Peres -helmed metrosexual bible.  The story will accompany a fashion spread starring, you guessed it, Fabs! Though the new scribe was initially contacted for a profile, talks quickly heightened and his story will now accompany the multi-paged spread."   The only Details I want from Basabe is what went on with that sexy wild girl  Barbara Bush  at the afterparty.  Ka-pow!    Out : Shootin' at the walls of heartache, bang-bang,  Ice T  is "The Warrior."  urlLink According to those Page Sixers , Ice, in addition to being a network star, is also a pimp and pornographer:  "In between Ice's edifying observations, porn stars are shown engaging in an eye-popping variety of graphic sex scenes.   "'Strippers are my favorite type of ho because they do not believe they are prostitutes,' Ice says in the (pornographic) video. 'A lot of them believe they are entertainers. Well, if you're an entertainer, you don't get off that goddamn stage. Lap-dancing is not entertaining. Lap-dancing is prostitution.'   "Ice, who last plied his pimping trade many years ago and is married now to a frequently photographed blond bombshell named Coco, also opines in the video: 'It's funny. Free [bleep] always costs you more. The wife is the ultimate ho.'   "He also calls pornography 'the ultimate, final level of the mother[bleeping] game, the pimp game,' and leaves viewers with this tantalizing truism: 'All of us are hos in one way or another, but very few will ever get the chance to truly pimp.'"   And here I thought "the smarts" was the ultimate, final level of the motherfucking game; then agin, we watched too much 80s tv (especially  urlLink that "special" episode of Diffrnt Strokes where Dudley got "touched"  and  urlLink the Sesame Street where Mr. Hooper died ).   In : The Reality TV trend continues unopposed,  urlLink in IWantMedia.com :  "Q:  The 2004-05 fall TV season was unveiled to advertisers last week. What are the most interesting trends?   "A:   Jack Myers , editor and publisher,  Jack Myers Report :   'NBC and ABC, as well as The WB, are clearly taking a new approach to scheduling that more closely resembles cable than broadcast, with short-flight runs, shared time periods and heavy doses of reality fare the dominant trends for fall. Reruns are out, reality is in, and almost everyone is suddenly talking long and loud about the importance of scheduling original programming 52 weeks a year. Fox began beating this drum last year, and announced aggressive plans to program original fare on a year-round basis. Only CBS is holding firm to the traditional model of premiering new and returning series early in the season, placing little emphasis on midseason replacement shows or limited run programs. These strategic shifts raise the question about network profitability, and how the escalating cost of TV programming can be fully amortized without a repeat strategy and with declining international sales value.'"    Out :  Tony Blair , George Bush's poodle; or, I prefer, keeping things Saxon, Bush's Springer Spaniel. Gag him with a fork, guys, he is done.   He tells CNN that he "absolutely agrees" with the President, glossing over the fighting of iraq war by passing on bogus intelligence through  Ahmad Chalabi :  "British Prime Minister  Tony Blair  has told the House of Commons he is "absolutely agreed" with U.S. President George W. Bush on the transfer of sovereignty to Iraq.  "He said multinational forces would remain in Iraq by the consent of the interim government which will have ultimate strategic decision-making powers, but there was no question of coalition troops being under anything other than coalition command.  "'We are both absolutely agreed there should be full sovereignty transferred to the Iraqi people and that the multinational force should remain under American command,' Blair said when questioned about apparent discrepancies between London and Washington."  "Iranian intelligence has been manipulating the US for several years through Chalabi," said Larry Johnson, a former senior counter-terrorist official at the state department. But Blair has nothing to say on that.  Good dog, Ubu, good dog.   In :  Miu Von Furstenberg , my future first wife, if she can put up with my love of Classical literature and 70s and 80s tv references (particularly the 70s show  urlLink Eight is Enough ), with this delicious May 19th entry:  "We had a bevy of celebrity sightings (no  Justin  or  Cammy ).

Elijah Wood  who was with a bevy of young cute boys, one of which was  urlLink Kevin Ricardson from the Backstreet Boys . This was a little confusing to us, since Kevin isn't one of the gay ones from the group.  urlLink Tom Green  who we overheard spouting off something about some E3 conference - it had something to do with videogames.  "As we were finish our dinners, we were sent over two Courvoisier's (how street) from someone at a table on the other side of the room. I, of course, had to find out who sent over the cocktails. As I was making my way over to the table, I body slammed into  urlLink Peter Krause  (from Six Feet Under). We both apologized profusely, and he turned very red (but looked very fuckable). I completely lost my train of thought, and headed back to our table.   "I had a hangover this morning."  We love you, Miu; we really do.

       Eisner, Tyrannus    Or, Eisner Rex, with apologies to Oedipus   When last we left Our Fearless Leader, Michael Eisner, in Orlando,  urlLink shares of Disney were down to $23.68.  There was a plague in the House of Mouse, and Eisner was determined to find out what it was.  “In the tide of death from which there is no escaping, Death in the fruitful flowering of her soul, Death in the pastures, And pestilence, a fiery demon gripping the city”  Sophocles ,  urlLink Oedipus Tyrannus    Eisner    My children, latest born to Disney old,   urlLink When you wish upon a star , and all that jazz  Branches of olive filleted with wool?  What means this reek of incense everywhere,  And everywhere laments and litanies?   urlLink O, Mickey Mouse Club , it were not meet that I should learn  From others, and am hither come, myself,   urlLink I, Eisner , your world-renowned king.  My zeal in stockholder behalf ye cannot doubt;  Ruthless indeed were I and obdurate  If such petitioners as you I spurned.   Disney Shareholder's/ Chorus   A blight is on our nation in the war on Terror,  A blight upon the economy,  A blight on  urlLink ABC in travail ; and withal  Armed with his blazing torch the God of Plague  Hath swooped upon our company emptying  The house of Mouse, and the murky realm  Of  urlLink Pluto  is full fed with groans and tears.    I, Eisner   Ah! my poor Mickey Mouse Club, known, ah, known too well,  The quest that brings you hither and your need.  Both for the general and myself and you, But I will not resign  urlLink this plummy post .  Enter  Michael Moore , fresh from visiting the narrator of  urlLink Fantasia .   Michael Moore   If thou wouldst watch  urlLink my documentary  publicly,  I'll tell thee straight, or with thee pass within.    Eisner   Speak before all; the burden that I bear  Is more for these my subjects than myself.  Tell us what the narrator of  urlLink Fantasia  has said.   Michael Moore   Let me report then all the god declared.   urlLink The Lion King  bids us straitly extirpate  A fell pollution that infests the land,  And no more harbor an inveterate sore.   Enter Billy Bob Thornton     Billy Bob Thornton   Remember  urlLink the Alamo .   Eisner   I'm trying to forget.  But, what is this pestilence? Who is to blame for the falling share prices?   Enter Jeffrey Katzenberg    Eisner   We're not casting for  urlLink Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , you midget.   Katzenberg   (casually) Oh, I just happened to read that  urlLink the box office for Shrek  has broken all manner of records.    Eisner   (seething) Good for you.   Katzenberg   Yes,  urlLink Dreamworks SKG is considering going public . And we just  urlLink greenlighted two sequels . Everyones doing fabulous, not like this plague-ridden  Disney . What happened? Why is Disney such a disaster?   Eisner   (from clenched teeth) Thats. What. I'm. Trying. To. Find. Out.   Katezenberg  (exiting)  Well, when you do, let me know. We might have a Vice Presidency at the studio for you. Or something.  Chow .   Eisner  (alone)  What next?   Enter the Weinstein Brothers    Harvey    What happened here ? It looks like the rack of lamb I destroyed at dinner last night ...   Eisner    urlLink The House of Mouse is plagued , and I intend to solve the riddle.   Bob Weinstein   We are looking for  urlLink other corporate sponsorship , Eisner.   Harvey   Or maybe we should run United Artists? We need a better contract, Eisner, no more of this cheapskate Disney mouse food. We want fuck you money.   Weinstein's Exit    Eisner   (distracted) What next?   Enter Roy Disney    Eisner    Jesus    Roy   No, not Jesus, but his humble servant,  urlLink Roy Disney .   Shareholder/ Chorus   Ah me, what countless woes are mine!  All our stock shares are in decline;  Weaponless my spirit lies.  Earth her gracious fruits denies   Eisner   Roy Disney, hearer who comprehendest all,  Lore of the wise and hidden mysteries,  High things of heaven and low things of the earth,  Thou knowest, though thy  urlLink tone deaf ears hear naught ,  What plague infects our city; and we turn  To thee, O hearer, our one defense and shield.    Roy Disney   Thy words, O CEO, are wide of the mark, and I  For fear lest I too trip like thee...    Eisner   Oh speak,  Withhold not, I adjure thee, if thou know'st,  Thy knowledge. We are all thy suppliants   puts on Mickey Mouse ears   Speak, so that I may hear  urlLink the truth    Disney   (agitated) Well, it will come what will, though I be mute   Eisner   Since come it must, it is thy shareholder duty to tell me.    Disney   I have no more to say; storm as thou willst,  And give the rein to all thy pent-up rage.    Eisner   Oh yeah? Your dad may have made this company, but I saved it. I've surpassed your daddy's contribution to Disney. In fact, I'm changing my own name to Disney, since I am really the son he wished he had.  urlLink I'm stealing your father .   Disney   Is it so? Then I charge thee to abide  By thine own proclamation; from this day  Speak not to these or me. Thou art the man,   Thou  the accursed polluter of this company.   Eisner tears off Mickey Mouse ears at hearing the truth     Eisner   (howling) ahhhh! I've got a migrane.   Shareholder/ Chorus   The truth? He couldn't handle the truth.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  African-American chicks .  urlLink Adrien Brody , it appears, has a -- how does one say it? --  urlLink Deniroesque  appreciation for the dusky hued goddess. First, there was that  urlLink uproarious kiss of Halle Barre , now, the sexiest skank in the world,  Naomi Campbell . Apparently Brody and Campbell left together arm in arm to the casbah. I think this officially makes Naomi the female version of  Tommy Lee ;  but that doesn't make her a bad person .   Out :  I see white people . Once agin, Our favorite  urlLink Upper East Side  social diary shows us that, yes, indeed, Doris Duke had duskily complected "best pals." ( Ed Note : We actually like  David Patrick Columbia  -- deeply -- and hope our healthy dose of irony is appreciated in the friendly jesting manner in which it is offered up). It's just too funny to resist. My bad.   In : According to  urlLink Ananova , via  urlLink Variety , the  urlLink Sex and The City  movie will not happen,  at least not at the present :  "According to Variety, Kim, who played  Samantha Jones  in the series, felt she couldn't commit to the film as no script had surfaced.  "The film was due to be written and directed by  Michael Patrick King .  "'She would have loved to have done the movie and made a deal to do the movie, but waited as long as possible with no script or start date and felt she had to take other offers that were presented to her after the hold period had passed,' Cattrall spokeswoman  Marvet Britto  said.  "'Kim would of course love to do the film and would be happy to revisit the project in the future.'  "Variety adds that other reasons could have come into play, such as Cattrall wanting script approval and to earn the same amount as  Sarah Jessica Parker ."  ( The Corsair  whistles silently, grabs a box of salt-free popcorn, then sits rapt to his screen)  "HBO was unwilling to consider replacing Cattrall, or to go through the time and effort of developing a script without her firm commitment."  Oh,  it's on like Gray Poupon!    Out :  Auctioning Celebrity Medical Records . I know, this sounds like some horrible apocalyptic end-of-civilized-democracy shit, but it is real,  baby pop . It looks like there will not be an auction for the actual birth records of  Bruce Springsteen .  urlLink According to TheSmokinggun.com :  "Days after  urlLink The Smoking Gun  disclosed the attempted sale of  Bruce Springsteen's  medical records, the Leland's auction house has turned over the confidential material to the rock star after being contacted by  The Boss's  lawyers. Leland's spokesman  Marty Appel  said that the firm was approached by the 'Springsteen camp' after TSG reported on the auction, and was asked to hand over the documents. The auction house complied, Appel said, because 'we're such great admirers of Springsteen.' We're guessing that the prospect of litigation probably also figured in the auctioneer's swift change of heart. The hospital documents (and another item carrying the singer's Social Security number) were apparently yanked from the firm's web site some time today."  In other Springsteen news, don't knock me over in a rush to Tower Records, but the Boss' wife  urlLink Patty Scialfa's  album goes on sale later this summer.  ( The Corsair  notes the sound of cicadas in the quiet spring breeze)     In :  Lindsay Lohan's Scar Tissue ? According to  urlLink Gawker , via  urlLink LiquidGeneration ,  Lindsay Lohan  had breast implants at the tender age of 17 because she  allegedly  has scar tissue.  You be the judge.   urlLink Here.  The  urlLink always excellent Michael Musto writes today :  "I hear that a recent  Saturday Night Live  after-bash there was highlighted by the machinations of former host  LINDSAY LOHAN , the greedy little vixen who's already had  AARON CARTER  and chased  COLIN FARRELL , and he's only about 40! Lohan was caught squealing, 'Where's Jimmy? Where's  JIMMY FALLON ?' with a sense of determination not seen since the  OLSEN TWINS  first grabbed for menstrual pads. Observers feel either she's had him or she wanted to have him—and sheesh, haven't we all in our more sensible moments? Alas, Fallon wasn't there, so the big-boobed starlet got to work trying to reach him on his cell phone—again, haven't we all?—and, being both a moral citizen and a college graduate, I don't even want to know what happened next."   Lohan sounds like  Paris Hilton .   Out :  The Brittany Murphy Crezzy Watch .  She so cray-zee . Who will go crazy first:  urlLink Brittney Murphy , she of  the big brown crazy eyes , or  urlLink Sadie Frost , she of the angry/sad face?  I'm betting on Murphy, because according to  urlLink Page Six :  "BRITTANY Murphy and top talent manager  Jeff Kwatinetz  have officially entered Splitsville. The Tinseltown twosome, who have been engaged for a year, called it quits after a 'bad' trip to Paris a few weeks ago. Kwatinetz is the one who called off the wedding, said our source, who claimed Kwatinetz is 'still in love' with his ex,  Michelle Dupont , who's now dating  Adrien Brody . To make thing even more awkward, both Murphy and Brody are represented by Kwatinetz's company,  The Firm ."  Wait a second ... didn't  Adrien Brody  just ...  never mind.     Anyhoo : Crazy girl plus public breakup equals nervous breakdown. We predict Brittany Murphy should have some kind of meltdown by Labor Day.  With those big crazy eyes.    In :  urlLink My pal Casey is so in . Want to hear  urlLink the history of a relationship New York-style ? Check it out,  pepper , you won't be disappointed.   Out :  urlLink Keith Blanchard at Maxim . According to  Adweek ,  Felix Dennis  is looking for a new editor up at Maxim. Our guess: How about  urlLink Jenna Jameson ?  No?  Okay.    In : A Day in the life of  Ludwig Heissmeyer , Assistant Designer,  Carolina Herrera  ( urlLink didn't Solzenitzin write that ?),  urlLink at Fashionweekdaily :  " 1:00pm : On my way back to the office I stop at Pret a Manger for lunch. I love French food. I decide on a crawfish sandwich accompanied by tomato and mozzarella and a delicious chocolate chip cookie—ok, make that two. I take it to the office where I join my lovely co-workers for a well-deserved break."  By the way, isn't  urlLink Carolina Herrera  the hottest older woman you've ever seen? Elegant in that jet set older woman way. And you know  urlLink Gemini men like me  are attracted to older, sophisticated lassies, you know, like the type who can whisper sexy phrases in your ear in seven languages.  I know, I'm such a Gemini.   Out : Michael Musto could never be out, but he may be "outing" someone at Fox:  "... As for the folks who think we're doing great in Iraq, is it possible that one—well, at least one—of the right-wing maniacs on the Fox News Channel is 'fairy and unbalanced'? The Washington Blade's KEVIN NAFF just wrote an editorial saying that on a recent visit to a New York gay bar, one of that channel's anchors got a wee bit tipsy and hit on him Lindsay Lohan-style. Naff responded by telling the sauced star that he's not single, and besides he would never date anyone in the closet. (Same here—I won't take anyone out unless he's already out.) Spies tell me the guy in question is the one who said 'blowjob' on the air and was recently linked to NICOLE KIDMAN. How poetic! Maybe gay boîtes should start 'Closeted Only' nights, with half-price poppers bottle service."

       Cookie O Puss? Fudgie the Whale? The Ghost of Tom Carvel Lives On   So little did I know when perusing  urlLink The Gothamist  today that a repressed childhood memory might spring up out of my already overwrought artistic consciousness, catching me unaware, leaving  me gasping in terror, clutching at  the very edges of sanity , contemplating its significance.   The Gothamist  mentioned:  "To celebrate their 70th anniversary,  urlLink Carvel Ice Cream  is attempting to build the world's largest ice cream pie in Union Square right now. They started at 9AM, and Gothamist hears they are giving out free pies!   "As many people who grew up in areas where there were Carvel ice cream stores, the theme song was 'Car-vel...Fresh...Ice...Cream,' ( The Corsair  shudders) and the most beloved ice cream cakes were  Fudgie the Whale  and  Cookie Puss , who must the coolest ice cream cake ever. As legend has it, Cookie Puss was a St. Patrick's Day cake ('Cookie O'Puss').  urlLink The Beastie Boys even wrote a song called Cookie Puss . And, as one commenter points out,  Tom Carvel  invented soft-serve ice cream AND did the voice-overs for the Carvel commericals."    Okay , you say, what is this overblown drama about sundry processed milk products? Is  The Corsair   urlLink lactose intolerant ?  urlLink Why doesn't he eat his fear ?  Hardly .    Tom Carvel  freaked the fucking hell out of me when I was a kid. I've never told anyone about this, so,  here goes  ...   Every time those low rent commercials came on, usually on the local channels, with that sepulchral, asthmatic-wheezy voice of  Tom Carvel , one foot in the grave, issuing forth emphazematic pleas for me to buy a fucking "Fudgie the Whale," or a goddamned "Cookie O' Puss," concoction, I .. I .. it ... it  gives me the fucking willies , is what it does. I just freaked out, man,  I couldn't handle it . (shivers)  There was something distinctly trailer-trash-creepy about Carvel, as if  Dairy Queen  would be a step up. One might imagine that Crystal Meth might go over well with a Cookie O Puss,  no ?   Whenever I passed by a Carvel as a child, I saw Archie and Edith Bunker mingling with reckless youth with no shirts on smoking Marlboro's with their free hand, feeling up their loose girlfriends with the other. All in a night of fun at Carvel (thems good eats).  I've tried to make this blog a refutation of that haphazard lifestyle, that ...  urlLink David Lynchian   Carvelness.  I call it Americana Horror.  And what about that squidlike voice-that-could-break-glass:  Cookie O' Puss ?  Was that supposed to be cute ? Were we supposed to want to eat something with that voice, and that flawed in it's basic industrial design?  I, for one, will be far, far away from Union Square. Thank you Gothamist, for helping me relive that ghastly childhood horror.

       William Hung Faces Death Threats   According to that significant cultural artifact, and you know of which I speak, namely, true believer,  urlLink The National Enquirer, William Hung is facing death threats :  " SHE BANGS ? He hopes not! 'American Idol' reject  urlLink William Hung  has been hit with death threats, sources have told The ENQUIRER. The 21-year-old Asian-American singer -- who mangles hits by  Ricky Martin ,  Elton John  and others -- is so scared, he refuses to croon at nightclubs, say sources.  But Hung is not so hung up that he refuses to play arenas or stadiums where he is far from the crowd.   SCARED   "'William says he's frightened to death of playing small venues, like nightclubs,' divulged a music industry insider."   The Corsair  knows he shouldn't laugh, but,  well  ...  " urlLink After his private telephone number somehow got out on the Internet , threats started pouring in from crackpots. 'He recently turned down more than $250,000 for 30 personal appearances at different nightclubs around the country.'  "Hung told the promoter who offered him the deal that he's taking the threats very seriously and said, 'I guess some people out there don't like me.' "  Fortunately, the University of California Berkeley engineering student feels comfortable regaling large audiences with his rendition of 'She Bangs' and other unique stylings."  Other unique stylings?

           Best of Corsair: The Democratic Party Veepstakes, Next Secretary of State   Ever since  urlLink NBC News Chief Foreign Affairs Correspondent Andrea Mitchell , a graduate student in power, the wife of Fed Reserve Chief  Allan Greenspan , suggested that  urlLink Hillary Clinton wants the veep slot , it has been hers to lose.   The problem with Hillary, and there are quite a few, is that she doesn't bring much to the ticket and she polarizes her opposition like no one in the world. Of course, she is also a geniune celebrity beloved like a goddess among African-American, Latino and Asian women. But Kerry already does well with women; he married a tough one, and that attracts the ladies -- a man unaffraid of a strong woman -- like nothing in this world.   Kerry will win New York. Kerry will win the Northeast ( urlLink although New Jersey, surprisingly, is looking like it is in play , thanks to the charismatically challenged  urlLink Governor, McGreevey ). In a sense, Hillary would have been  much more useful  to the ticket had she run for the Senate seat in Arkansas, where a Southern base would mark her head and shoulders above the sunny and optimistic bright Senator  John Edwards , which, quite frankly, she is not. The problem with Hillary is that she was too tepid,  she didn't run ; Edwards did -- and thus, among many, he should get the nod,  it's his turn ; Edwards took the risk.    Hillary Odds: 50-50    John Edwards : Neck and neck with Hill. Pro: Electoral College votes. A bombshell convention speech in Prime time to show off his looks. A player in the party to come.  50-50  Plus, appropos of nothing, Edwards is a Gemeni, and a Gemeni along with a Sagittarius Kerry, would be spectacular ( okay , now you can discount all my other analysis because I mentioned astrology)   urlLink Max Cleland .  The Corsair  believes that he is the likely choice for a running mate.  Pros:  From Georgia, brings the South back into the mix ... former Senator ... triple amutee war hero would make a strong veterans campaign with Kerry --  and Vets are liely Republican voters  ... expert on Homeland Security (big plus, as national security is a Republican stronghold) which Bill Clinton in a closed door meeting warned that the nominee must be strong on ... strong on health care ... could humiliate chicken hawk Cheney in a debate  Cons : Health might be an issue. ( ed note: Feb 14, 2004 : it's a fucking long ass sojourn through the country for a Veep, from Labor Day till the election -- can Cleland do it? I think so.  Odds on favorite )   urlLink Gary Hart   Pros : Vast intellect, PhD, Oxford, Political Philosophy ... wise from his time out in the political wilderness ... Strong in the Southwest ... devastating debator  Cons : Old adultery charge may still stick in the Bible Belt ... may be more useful to the Democratic Party in a Senate bid against the very weak  Ben Knighthorse Campbell  ( note : Campbell  will not  seek relection) ... Possible  Secretary of State , a la his hero, Jefferson ( ed note: Feb 14, 2004 )   urlLink Bill Richardson  Pros: Governor of ultra-crucial New Mexico ... Latino ... former UN Ambassador and  urlLink seasoned diplomat  would give international cooperation credit points to ticket   Cons : None. ( ed note: Feb 14, 2004 : hot like salsa)   urlLink Wesley Clark  Pros: Longshot, but if he wins big in Oklahoma and the conservative Southwest he could be in the cut ... General would give strong military backing to ticket ... would humiliate chickenhawk Cheney in a debate ... strong with African-Americans   Cons : Too closely tied to Bill Clinton, who wants Hillary '08, which may be an issue. ( ed note: Feb 14, 2004 : Wes is bitter as the Clintonistas dumped his ass as soon as he started looking like yesterday's donuts. Could be Sec of Defense in a Kerry White House. An effective military attack dog. Will work well with a Cleland Veep)   urlLink Dick Gephardt   Pros : Outside of Cleland and Edwards, the most likely running mate ... most popular pol in pivotal swing state Missouri ... would be perfect for a Kerry-Gephardt Northern labor-veterans strategy against a Bush South ... comes with the backing of labor, a Democratic must needs ... a truly good guy who dropped out and endorsed Kerry early:  he did the right thing   Cons : Wooden on the stump,  charismatically challenged  (ed note: Feb 14, 2004: this ticket may be too damn Northern top heavy. Could be the  greatest  and  most powerful  Sec of Labor in US history in a Kerry White House)   urlLink Evan Bayh  Pros: Young up and comer, popular moderate Democrat from a Republican state ... would look good stumping with Kerry ... strong political family ... Would play well in Bush states ... hugely ambitious for national office, a quick study   Cons : A long shot ... may not even be able to deliver Indiana, his home state, against Bush ( ed note: Feb 14, 2004 : not bloody likely, but it would harken to the Tom Sawyer-Huck Finnish days of Clinton-Gore '92)   urlLink Bob Graham   Pros : Most Aggressively Campaigning for this position ... got out early ... most popular elected official in CRUCIAL Florida ... Senate Intelligence Committee  Cons : Bad ticker ... charisma challenged. (ed note: Feb 14, 2004: The Corsair believes that Graham, who lusts after this position so badly that our computer screen is blurred, prolly had a deal with the Dean peeps, so he may be radioactive to Kerry; then again loyalty, in politics, is  urlLink mobile, like la donna )  Others:   urlLink Florida Senator Bill Nelson  is as exciting as a glass of tea.   urlLink Indiana Senator Evan Bayh's name , which has been aggressively floated for the past week, will NEVER be the nominee. Evan Bayh cannot even deliver Indiana to the Democrats, the Hoosier state is Republican for life. He is too conservative and he knows it. Ae has to be. He is a Democrat in Indiana, which is as rare as  Paris Hilton  rejecting a sexual offer or  Courtney Love  declining some "h". But it serves a Machiavellian purpose: floating Evan Bayh's name is like a shot of steroids, it raises his name recognition, like free campaign commercials, it strengthens his hold on a tenuous position, namely, being a Democrat in Indiana.   The Next Secretary of State    Democrats    Walter Isaacson : It may not yet be his time. Wise, Aspen leader. N'Orleans Democrat with Founding Father best seller and media-philosophy cred.  85-1    Zbigniew Brzezinski : This man's name is more complicated than mine -- and that's a feat. He is auditioning hard with  urlLink his new tome , which took a bit of an ass whipping in the  urlLink New York Review of Books . He is unbelieveably brash for a man who armed  urlLink the Mujahadein . A little too inside for Kerry to get away with appointing, then again, Jimmy Carter broke everyone's heart when he campaigned as a  urlLink peanut farming outsider , then appointed the ultimate Trilateralist insider  urlLink Cyrus Vance  to State.  65-1    Richard Holbrooke : No one wants State more than Ambassador Holbrooke. And, while we are on the subject, since when do UN Ambassadors  urlLink go out with Diane Sawyer ? Huh,  urlLink Dick ?  urlLink Impressive resume . Holbrooke is a master operator and a player who cultivates the air of inevitability that he will ultimately be the Secretary of State of the US, the world's last standing superpower, astride the globe like a mighty colossus.  50-50    urlLink Jamie Rubin : It may not be his time yet. He is too young, the  John Edwards  of the foreign policy elite set.  urlLink Madeline Albright's pretty toy boy . A lock as possible UN Ambassador under Kerry. Hedged his bets on  urlLink Wesley Clarke , and lost. Side note: His wife,  Christiane Amanpour , may be the most important television journalist, and he himself is on the fast track to UN Ambassador, State, and, possibly, UN Secretary General.  This is the glamour couple for the next age: The Age of International Law.  95-1    urlLink Gary Hart : This is my favorite choice, because now that Daniel Patrick Moynihan has passed on, no one is wiser or more intelligent on such a wide variety of subjects than Hart. And he gets along well with Kerry. Affairs will not matter at State, although you can be sure convoluted arguments will come from the Bible Belt ("hey, his past infidelities could be used as against you by a foreign spy.")  50-50    Republicans   Now this here is the only game in town. Three major figures want this post:   urlLink Newt Gingrich : A favorite of the Hawkish conservatives. So ambitious that he  urlLink attacked  Colin Powell in the  urlLink neocon rags . While still sitting at State. Oh, it was on like  urlLink Gray Poupon ! An enemy of  George Bush the Elder , which may hurt his chances of advancing in the Bush dynasty. Poppy still has juice.  50-50    James Baker : You don't get any oilier than  urlLink James E. Baker , who allegedly called Arabs, "sand ni**ers at a cabinet meeting." Baker is the dirtiest player in the game. Reeks of thwarted ambition. Why was George Bush, that punk President and he -- he, the mastermind -- secretary of state?! And only for part of the term at that! An unfinished Secretary of State stewardship, helping your Poppy's reelection: come on Dubya,  you owe me .  50-50    Paul Bremer : A Bush favorite. Close with the Dynasty. His fortunes within the dynasty depend  entirely  upon the Iraqi power handoff, and whether he scores, or drops the ball. Slim chance. Al Graib probably ruined his chances.

       Soprano Chat: Adriana Gets Whacked   I won't say I told you so, but despite rumors to the contrary,  Drea de Matteo's  long suffering character, the misunderstood  urlLink Adriana La Cerva , got whacked -- sadly -- on  urlLink last week's installment of the hit HBO Sunday night drama The Soprano's ,  urlLink clearing the way  for her to play  Matt LeBlanc's  uptight sister,  Gina , in the  urlLink NBC sit com Joey .  As  Adam Brickman  wrote in the  urlLink New York Post back in March :  "HBO would not comment on Adriana's status on 'The Sopranos,' citing its long-standing policy against revealing future plot developments.   "Sources insist that De Matteo's work on 'Joey' will not conflict with 'The Sopranos,' which is filmed at various locations in New York and New Jersey. 'She is contracted for a sixth season' of 'The Sopranos,' an HBO source said."   Riiight . How will the vulnerable  Chris-tuh-fuh  take it? Even though, as the cold blooded  Sylvio  muttered ominously, "... he's a resilient guy," (shouldn't that have been the tip off, Ade?) we know, in our heart of snarky hearts, that he "really loved her." Almost as much as the "h" he sniffed before T but a boot in his complacent ass, as they all veer closer to all out War.  So,  who gets whacked next ?  Comment here or on  urlLink VH1's Best Blog Ever

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  urlLink Bloggers .  urlLink Daniel Radosh writes in this week's New Yorker : "Two years from now—give or take— urlLink Elizabeth Spiers , the founding editor of the gossip Web sites  urlLink Gawker  and  urlLink The Kicker , will publish her first novel. Around the same time,  Glenn Reynolds , who writes the political Web log  urlLink Instapundit , will also have a book in stores. So, too, may writers from the blogs  urlLink Hit and Run ,  urlLink The Black Table ,  urlLink Dong Resin ,  urlLink Zulkey ,  urlLink Low Culture ,  urlLink Lindsayism ,  urlLink Megnut ,  urlLink Maud Newton ,  urlLink MemeFirst ,  urlLink Old Hag ,  urlLink PressThink ,  urlLink I Keep a Diary ,  urlLink Buzz Machine ,  urlLink Engadget , and  urlLink Eurotrash . Suddenly, books by bloggers will be a trend, a cultural phenomenon. You will probably read about it in the  Sunday Times . And when that happens the person to thank—or blame—will be  Kate Lee , who is currently a twenty-seven-year-old assistant at  International Creative Management ."  To this,  urlLink Gawker  writes, "Anyway, guess we'll find out when  Kate  sells her first book. Ah, the hype before the storm.  "Wait -- doesn't anyone want to see my book proposal? Hello?"  I'll cosign on that Choire, my little soupbones. What about  The Corsair's  novel  urlLink deal , Kate darling (in best growly 'what's new pussycat' Warren Beatty voice)?  Hello?    Out :  Marriage , for the Catwoman; nine lives, yes, nine marriages, JHo;  nein .  Halle Berry  said she will never get married again,  urlLink according to Ananova , via  The Oprah Winfrey Show :  " Halle Berry  says she will never get married again after discovering that her second husband Eric Benet was cheating on her.  "She admits in a TV interview with  Oprah Winfrey  to air in the US tomorrow that stories last year that Benet was having an affair were true.  "Berry, who filed for divorce from Benet earlier this year tells  Winfrey : 'It's probably the first time the tabloids got my life right!'  "She also said that her latest role as  urlLink Catwoman , in which she wears a leather catsuit, helped her take control of her life.  "... I'll never get married again, and I always hate to say never to anything, but I will never marry again."  Pass the gospel on to serial bride  JLo , sister.  BTW : No, that's not a massive tumor on Halle's head, that's a mask.   In :  Adam Moss'  vibrant,  urlLink new New York Magazine  takes a long, hard look at past  SNL  stars who exited the show with the highest of hopes and  urlLink the lowest grade piece-of-ass scripts  (listen up,  Mr. Fallon , school is in session, the teacher is professor  urlLink Logan Hill ), "Once the most precocious SNL alum,  Eddie Murphy  plummeted from the heights of Beverly Hills Cop. After lampooning Mr. Rogers and playing blue in Raw, he got caught with a pre-op transsexual prostitute named  Shalimar  in 1997, but recovered at the box office by churning out enough parent-approved pap (Daddy Day Care and the upcoming Daddy Day Camp) to shrug off his flop  Pluto Nash ."  Ah,  suki-suki.  Who added the dash of Wasabi to NY Mag?  urlLink Adam Moss did , that's who.   Out :  $500 on steaks and $4,000 on wine . According to  urlLink Page Six , " EVANDER Holyfield  at Nello's washing down two kobe steaks ($250 apiece) with a $4,000 bottle of Screaming Eagle wine to celebrate his deal with  Don King  to fight  Vitali Klitschko  this summer."  What about the  urlLink goddamned pomme frites ! You can  urlLink beat a man to death  and still eat like a monarch. Only in America.    In : Everyone on  urlLink K Street  is asking:  Can The President present a unified Party and a unified vision ?  urlLink TheHill.com reports :  " President Bush  will visit with congressional Republicans today in the Capitol amid growing levels of tension between the White House and GOP leaders.  "House and Senate leaders invited the president, who has big-ticket legislative items pending, to address members, something he has not done in the Capitol since last May.  "The meeting will take place in the basement of the Capitol, and Bush is expected to take questions."   urlLink The Republicans are grumbling ,  urlLink eating their own ,  urlLink the moderates  are growing restless,  urlLink the anti-immigration hordes are upset .   Can  Dubya  shore up the party, especially after his fall in the polls and his  urlLink symbolic fall from his bike ?   Out :  JLo in Russia . Moscow snow drifting off her high water booty:  priceless .  urlLink According to British Vogue :  " JENNIFER LOPEZ  has chosen Moscow as a venue for her first shop launch. The singer, actress and fashion designer is expected to attend a party to launch the shop, which will stand alongside the likes of  Calvin Klein  and  Ungaro  in the  Crocus City Mall , on May 31. Aimed at the city's richest 12 to 15-year-olds, the boutique is an attempt to create an 'interactive shopping experience', with plasma screens showing off Lopez's image constantly, huge sofas and music booths playing her records. 'There will be a swing chair and girls are expected to come with their friends to have a good time,'  Tatyana Stoliarskaya , a spokeswoman for the mall, told The Hindu. The 300 sq metre shop will sell clothes, jeans, belts jewellery, sunglasses and a new line of lingerie that will debut during the opening fashion show. 'Moscow for Jennifer represents the ultimate in beauty, luxury and culture,' according to press release about the store."   Interessant.    In :  urlLink Curbed , the snarky real estate blog, brought to you by the my man  urlLink Lockhart Steele , who'se got it on lockdown. It's so choice, I highly recommend it:  "Newly up for grabs: the Tribeca loft purchased by  Sean Combs  for $3.65 million. He never moved in, which justifies a $650k price jump."   Out :  urlLink Clay Aiken, fast living, beer drinking womanizer .  Right  (link via  urlLink Stereogum  via  urlLink Lauraslashtemp ).     In : P Diddy: The Fragrance.  JLo's  opening a joint in Russia, and The Diddy's making scents, urlLink  according to the AP :  " Sean Combs  seems to have teamed up musically with everyone, from  Notorious B.I.G.  and  Usher  to  Sting  and  Dave Navarro . But his next collaboration, through his fashion designer persona, is with Estee Lauder: The cosmetics company is planning to create and market a new line of fragrances under the rapper's Sean John name.   "'People express themselves in many ways — through their music, through the way they dress, and also through the fragrance they choose, so deciding to make a fragrance was very natural for me,' Combs said Thursday."  The scent is said to contain oil of  Glock .  Kidding.     Out :  urlLink Kerry's convention plan  -- floated convention plan -- sucks. William Safire, however, has a brilliant idea: set up the Dem Convention, next time around, at the same time as the Republican, allow competition to flourish.    urlLink Networks hate conventions . They could sell ad space on almost any show better than a convention. But with the two parties competing, you double the ante.

       Harry Potter and the Chattering Class   Allow me to amend an months old blog and update it for the new readers (AKA people who wouldn't give me the time of day when my blog was puke green and electric blue):   Far be it from me , a lowly blogger, a peddler of the snark, to impede the progress of all the  primping  and  preening  that goes on among the chattering classes. I mean, they do deserve their time to waddle in the sun being as they explain reality to the rest of the world daily, via their nesting centers in  NY ,  DC  and  LA , and occasionally  urlLink Davos  and  The Charlie Rose Show  and, sometimes, the cover of  Vanity Fair  (unless, of course,  urlLink you are African-American )   Sometimes  the chattering class appear to be unruly students at  urlLink J K Rowlings'  mythical  Hogwarts , struggling in childlike wonder with The Big Questions of Our Day in   ermine robes of state ( The New Yorker  is especially good at this).

       Topic A With Tina Brown    urlLink Gawker.com's  Henry the Intern pretty much got everything in his report on  urlLink Tina Brown's show last night :  "In an awkward transition to a lighter topic (and a pointless segment), Tina asked for 'a quick gallop' through the 'dog and pony show' of the  urlLink television upfronts .  urlLink Sharon Waxman , of The New York Times, said NBC's  urlLink Jeff Zucker  was 'prancing' and ABC's presentation was like a wake (or, Tina thought, like the  urlLink Seven Year War ). TV Guide's  urlLink Stephen Battaglio  said ABC's new wife-swap reality show 'has more to do with vacuuming than sex.' Tina was charmed: 'vacuuming and sex - that's what life is.'"  Yeah,  as if Tina has ever changed vaccum bags . A couple of notes: Steve Battaglia was wearing this  urlLink very disconcerting gold mesh eye shadow . And, yeah, it looks like ABC is nearly dead in the water.

       The Corsair vs. AJ Benza   Apparently,  The Corsair  has a little more juice than he thought he did. Multitudinous is my capacity for making mischief, dear readers ( The Corsair  rubs his hands together like the cat who licked the cream). The other day I blogged on  urlLink AJ Benza and the Howard Stern Razor article , blaming him with  incendiary language .  Imagine my surprise today when, sifting through the birthday wishes and usual hate e-mail, I recieved a missive from  AJ Benza  himself!  In the subject line it read, "Note to Ron OogaBooga from AJ Benza"  People get fixated on the name,  what can I say ? Every hate email  The Corsair  gets has a Kindergarteny vibe. You get used to it.  It continues (averted gaze, exaggerated cough, feigned detatchment):  "Mr. Corsair...."  Oh,  it's on like Gray Poupon .  "Do yourself a favor and report facts. If you were an actual reporter, you'd know that the founder and editor of Razor, Craig Knight, quit over what his publisher Richard Botto did with my Howard Stern piece. Even Howard respects what I wrote and has told his millions of listeners that this is obviously the publisher of Razor trying to drum up sales."   The Corsair  throws some punches at the air.  "I clearly state in my piece that my speaking to Stern came about during a personal phone call regarding John Melendez jumping to Jay Leno. Howard and I spoke yesterday morning and I was vindicated. So why dont you report on that? If you don't, you clearly have an ax to grind. And if you do....what can I do? Second....if you think a $600,000 a year job hosting a reality show this fall is a 'dead career,' then you're dumb as a stump. And if you add in my $200,000 Talk/Miramax book deal on top of that.....that's some decent scratch, no? Does Paper pay you $800,000?"  Yes, that is some, er, "decent scratch," and, no, I do not make $800,000 a year;  but I am a thousandaire . I have no axe to grind, AJ, aside from being  mildly miffed  at the swipe at my name. You are right, you have been vindicated by Howard Stern. But that vindication came  after  I wrote my piece. So, here I am writing about it now, tough guy.  "I like your writing. I read your stuff. What you don't understand or ever do is actually report on stuff. It's a kick just to be able to scream out your opinion on shit...but it's another to make sure what you say is accurate. And what you wrote about me is incorrect."  It's a "kick"? Who is this really: Frank Sinatra? Conversing with AJ Benza is like going into a 1950s time warp where dames are dames and men were men.

       Mobb Deep At The Movies   Vibe Magazine has this interesting feature where they show movie trailers to the thuggiest hip hop stars and have them rate it -- two guns up if it is good, and, conversely, two guns down if it sucks. Brilliant. In fact, I want to informally pitch this to all the cable people reading this blog (I know you are lurking out there): Think Siskel and Ebert,  but with thugs .  Chatting . I'm telling you, this has MTV written all over it.  Anyhoo,  urlLink Prodigy and Havoc  of  urlLink Mobb Deep  reviewed:   urlLink Predator vs. Alien    Havoc : Thumbs down! They bitin off  urlLink Freddy versus Jason .   Prodigy : They took too long to do that.  urlLink Alien  versus  urlLink Predator ? It's too late. I'll wait to see it on DVD.   Havoc : When did Alien and Predator ever come from the same world? Wasn't the Predator in the present and Alien was, like 2050 or something? Now all the sudden they caught up to each other.   Prodigy : It looks weak, man. Thumbs down.   Havoc : It's not gonna fly.   Rating: Two Guns Down    urlLink Spiderman 2    Prodigy : Oh, it's on. It's gonna be a smash hit.   Havoc : Spiderman 2 is a must see. The first was off the hook.   Prodigy : Now they got that dude, Dr. Whats his name? Dr. Octagon or some shit?   Havoc : Octapus, I think. Out of all the comic book remakes, Spiderman was by far the best one. So I'll definitely check out 2.    Prodigy : Spidey's ill. He be flying around with the web, that shit is ill. Nigga crawlin on walls and shit.   Rating: Two Guns Up    urlLink Anchorman    Prodigy : That nigga retarded, son.   Havoc :  urlLink Will Ferrell  -- that's my dog right there.   Prodigy : Hell, yeah, he's like the new Chevy Chase.   Havoc : Right, exactly, but funnier. I'll definitely check that.   Prodigy : Word. Get doped up and go laugh real quick. Word. Plus, he smacked he in the ass and said 'I like that fatty.'   Havoc : Yeah, he said fattie, son. Thumbs up!   Rating: Two Guns Up    urlLink The Village    Prodigy : Looks like  urlLink Little House on the Prairie , but horror.   Havoc : There's a  urlLink red slash on everybody's door , so what?   Prodigy : The 'hood would be like, 'Where that monster at? -- Straight up! Where that monster at? You gotta show something. What the fuck? Leprichauns is in the woods or something -- that's that kind of shit that when you finally see what it is, you be like, 'uhh, man.'   Havoc : Do I wanna see this movie. Do I wanna spend $20 on it? I don't think so. Thumbs down.   Rating: Two Guns Down    urlLink I, Robot    Prodigy : I don't know about that one, god. I like the song and all they have playing.   Havoc : Nice little rock beat.   Prodigy : But we judging movies here.   Havoc : I, Robot?   Prodigy : I knew someone was gonna do 'I' something cause that 'I' shit is popular. It's i-pod, i-this, i-that.   Havok : Corny title,  urlLink weak trailer . It's not "'hood friendly."   Prodigy :  I  wouldn't see it.   Rating: Two Guns Down    urlLink The Chronicles of Riddick    Havoc : The special effects was alright, nothing too spectacular, but I love science fiction cause it gets us prepared for what's really about to happen in the future.   Prodigy : Who was  urlLink that girl  in it?   Havoc : That's  urlLink the girl  from Mission: Impossible II that I'm in love with.  urlLink Tom Cruise aint know  what  urlLink to do with  that. Ima see shorty when we get to Hollywood. I give it a thumbs up.   Prodigy : She was the best part of the whole clip, but the movie looks kinda suspect. I give it a diagonal thumbs down.   Rating: Mixed: One Gun Up and one -- er, "Diagonal" (?) Gun Down

       A Little of the Old In and Out: The Corsair Special Birthday Edition    In :  Me . It's my birthday, silly. Obvs.   Out : Apparently,  urlLink according to Page Six , Terry McCauliffe is on the outs even though, on paper, he is very much on the ins:  "WE weren't totally accurate in predicting three months ago that  Sen. John Kerry  would dump  Terry McAuliffe  as chairman of the Democratic National Committee. McAuliffe continues to hold the title. But sources say Kerry has installed  urlLink John Sasso , a loyalist from Boston, as his key man at the DNC. "No checks are written until Sasso signs off. No decisions are made until Sasso says so," said one Democrat. 'Terry McAuliffe was told to take it, or take a hike. And he's taking it.' McAuliffe, a multimillionaire from Syracuse, was hand-picked by Bill Clinton and has remained under the influence of Sen. Hillary Clinton. Sasso was a top advisor to Michael Dukakis and then a lobbyist in Beantown. 'He is totally loyal to Kerry,' said our source."   Page Six plays serious hardball . Those guys are serious as a heart attack, and we love them for it. McCauliffe was a pussyboy besides. Expect McCauliffe to resign from humiliation Page Six style in the near future.    In :  urlLink menu=">Kate Beckinsale, a hottie, to be sure . According to  urlLink Ananova :   "Kate Beckinsale says she was made to feel ugly on the set of Pearl Harbour.  "She says she hated the Pearl Harbor experience because she was made to feel ugly by the movie moguls behind the blockbuster.  "Kate says her insecurities began when director  Michael Bay  bluntly explained she was picked for the film because she wasn't beautiful.  "The actress says, 'It freaked me out because I was so pleased with myself, having lost the 70 pounds after my pregnancy.  "'I wasn't exactly what they had in mind, and when they publicised the movie, Michael would continue to say, We cast Kate because she wasn't too attractive.  "'I did find that quite upsetting and my self-esteem took a real blow from it... I became quite insecure because I was told a lot that I wasn't pretty enough.'"  ( Ed Note : Michael Bay is a typical Hollywood picklehead.)  "However, she says she got support from co-star  Ben Affleck .  "She said: 'Ben Affleck was very open about it. This is what goes on, he said, and I really needed somebody to tell me it wasn't just me.'"  Wow, Ben Affleck get his first piece of good press in a while.   Out : Creed has officially broke up, according to the always excellent  urlLink Scott's Stereogum . Thank God, I will never have to hear the goadawful "with arms wide open ..." again.   In :  urlLink Miu Von Furstenberg says goodbye  to Our Amanda Hesser, the punching bag of the blogopshere, to the tune of "Candle in the Wind":   "Goodbye Amanda H Though I never knew you at all You had the audacity to write reviews While those around you balked They crawled out of the woodwork And they whispered that you were lame They set you on the treadmill Made you hang your head in shame  "And it seems to me you lived your life Like a breadstick in the basket Never knowing who to cling to When the backlash set in And I would have liked to have known you Oh who am I to kid Your talent burned out long before  urlLink Your Masa review  ever hit"  More of marvelous Miu  urlLink here .   Out : Representative Mike Thompson exits the House Agricultural committee to make room for the Democratic Party's newest superstar, Stephanie Herseth, according to  urlLink TheHill.com :  " urlLink Rep. Mike Thompson  (D-Calif.) has stepped down from his seat on the House Agriculture Committee to make room for newly elected  urlLink Rep. Stephanie Herseth  (D-S.D.).  "Thompson said he contacted  urlLink House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s  (D-Calif.) office Wednesday, letting his party’s leadership know that he would happily volunteer to relinquish his slot.  "Thompson, also a member of the  House Budget Committee , had a waiver to serve on Agriculture and was therefore a natural to leave the panel.  "'She’s our newest colleague and she needed a seat,' Thompson told The Hill. 'I volunteered.'"  And, of course, a seat on Agriculture for South Dakota is of infinite importance. This entrenches her, gives her the ability to bring home the bacon for South Dakota, and makes her harder for the Republicans to beat. That, la dies and gentlemen , is hardball.  And, finally  In :  urlLink Ultragrrrl is having a ferocious debate  on her site as to who is cooler  urlLink Lloyd Dobler from Say Anything  or  urlLink Steff McKee , from Pretty in Pink.

       Blondes Have More Funds    urlLink According to the 3AM Girls , Blondie's Debbie Harry can still out-diva today's whippersnappers:  "She's been in showbiz for more than 25 years and Debbie Harry still knows how to act the proper rock diva.  "The Blondie superstar, 58, scuppered an up-and-coming indie band's chances of supporting them on their UK tour because - wait for it ... the lead singer is blonde, too."  ( The Corsair  grabs his trusty bag on unsalted popcorn and, in one elegant sweeping move, leaps onto his chair, which, duly, wheels him to his desk and computer screen, to which he is riveted)  " M.A.S.S , who have drawn comparisons with Blondie, had been chosen to support Debbie and Co. at a one-off gig in Amsterdam.  "But minutes before they were due to go on stage at the Paradiso club, the promoter informed them that they could only perform after Blondie.  "A clause in a contract stipulated that no groups with a blonde singer could go on before them."   What the fuck?!   "M.A.S.S, which is fronted by  urlLink Justine Berry  and features Denise Van Outen's ex, Andy Miller from Dodgy, on lead guitar, were understandably miffed.   "'Maybe she was afraid of the competition,' fumes their manager,  Andrew Winters . 'It was literally just before the guys were due on stage in Amsterdam that the promoter came up and told us there was a problem.  "'He said Justine is blonde so we couldn't go on because there is a ban on blonde girls supporting Debbie Harry.  "'I couldn't believe what I was hearing. At first I thought it was a joke but it wasn't. Turns out they didn't realise Justine is blonde because the band is quite punky and heavy metal. I was told there was a clause that stipulates this. Maybe she doesn't want the competition, who knows?'"  This makes the whole ( The Corsair  makes quotation gestures into thin air) "No Brown M & M's" clause kind of moot in comparison, no?  Comment here on on  urlLink VH1's Best Week Ever blog    Ed Note : Tomorrow is my birthday and I'm taking the day off from work and haven't decided if I will be too hung over to blog. So, don't take it personal if I'm not on. I'm just getting my Gemini on.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  Childhood sexual fantasies.  They are very dark indeed, sepia-dark, with wine colored interiors and tangled.  So very tangled . Apparently,  Janet Jackson  (who so ably played "Cleo" on the hit tv series "Fame" ... thank you, thank you; please bring this show back in reruns  VH1 ) -- Our Janet had childhood fantasies of the  disgusting  kind, according to  urlLink The Sixers . And, one would imagine, Jackson family childhood desires are  considerably darker  than the common man's:  "BREAST-barer Janet Jackson had a very active libido at a very young age. The songstress admits to early crushes on both  Barry Manilow  and R&B lothario  Teddy Pendergrass , who starred in her early sexual fantasies. 'My mother would come into my room and say, Janet, why are you being so lazy?' Jackson tells Blender magazine. 'What she didn't know was that I was having a very sexual moment with Teddy, in my mind.'"   The Corsair  dry heaves violently, rolled up in the fetal position, mouthing the word:  Why . Can you think of two more dodgy characters on the margins of sonic propriety other than  Teddy Pendergrass , with the jheri curl, (averted gaze) and, the affable, if very "Poconos"  Barry Manilow , what, with the strung out blonde hair and the big shnoz? Oh,  urlLink sweet Melissa : I mean,  why stop there : what about  Phil Bailey  (who so ably recorded  urlLink "Easy Lover"  with  Phil Collins , thank you ...  thank you )  And while we are in a confessional mood, dear reader, I want to admit to an indiscretion of the mind,  shall we say , committed --with gusto, I might add -- with marginal R a& B talent  urlLink Evelyn "Champagne" King  in the early 80s. She made the song "Ooh You Make My Love Come Down," you know. The fantasy involved my fevered pre-adolescent mind and a sundry half empty bottle of  urlLink Riunite on ice  ...  so nice . And I'm not even going to get into my Sheena Easton "Sugar Walls" fantasies.  The Corsair  won't go there.   Out :  urlLink According to Page Six , Madonna has instituted a "cursing fine":  "THE times they have a changed! Madonna, once known for her lewd behavior as well as her lewd language, has imposed a 'cursing fine' on everyone in her tour, including dancers and roadies. 'Every time someone curses, they have to pay a fine,' said an insider.  Liz Rosenberg , Madonna's rep, said: 'That is correct Â? and by the way, she has paid plenty [herself]. I think it is $5 a curse word.' Madonna was caught several weeks ago shrieking at her dancers: 'Get it right or get the [bleep] out!' Â? just before she donated to the cursing can.'  What the f@*k?!  ( The Corsair  quietly deposits a wooden nickel into the cursing can)   Out :  Fred Durst . The man is creepy to celebrity women;  creepy . First there was that  urlLink very public wooing of Angelina Jolie , on Access Hollywood, no less; then he told  Howard Stern  that  urlLink he had sex with Britney  after writing her some fucking poetry ( The Corsair  shivers). Now, according to  Rolling Stone  via  urlLink Ananova :  " Avril Lavigne  has revealed how  Fred Durst  tried to woo her by buying her a huge box of hamburgers and chips after she told him she was hungry.  "The 19-year-old Canadian says the Limp Bizkit frontman seemed 'a little pi**ed' when she rebuffed his romantic advances.  "She told  Rolling Stone  the pair met backstage at a  Metallica  concert.  "She said: 'I mentioned to Fred that I was hungry, like, I want an In-N-Out burger.  "'He had someone go out and get me a whole box of them, with fries. I was like, Yeah!.  "'Then he took a private jet out to one of my shows, expecting me to bang him. He was disappointed that I wouldn't even go near him.  "'He was a little pi**ed that I went to my room alone that night.'"   First off : Hey Avril,  urlLink watch those carbs.   And, Fred, let me explain something to you: Avril wanted an In-N-Out BURGER, not ... uhm, In-N-Out ... I'm going to go on to the next category now, thank you.   In :  Mel Karmazin to Disney ? Cue to the  urlLink Survivor song The Search is Over . I speculated this might happen yesterday ( The Corsair  pats himself on the back). It is a logical fit and the media industry is hugely logical in its calculations. Again,  urlLink those dazzling Sixers  give us the pipin hot scoop:  "... The buzz is that the Disney despot plans to step down at the end of the summer and that he's handpicked former Viacom president Mel Karmazin as his successor. The Post reported yesterday that Karmazin has been eyeing the job.   "'Eisner trusts Mel,' says one of our sources. 'They've been talking about him taking over.'"    Out :  urlLink George Tenet :  "'I will miss him,' Bush said."  ( The Corsair  motions for a cadenza of weepy violins)  "Tenet, 51, came to the White House to inform Bush about his decision Wednesday night. 'He told me he was resigning for personal reasons,' Bush said. 'I told him I'm sorry he's leaving. He's done a superb job on behalf of the American people.'"   The Corsair  coughs *Chalabi*  "Tenet will serve until mid-July. Bush said that deputy John McLaughlin will temporarily lead America's premier spy agency until a successor is found. Among possible successors is House Intelligence Committee Chairman  Porter Goss , R-Fla., a former CIA agent and (John) McLaughlin."   In :  urlLink Shavar Ross , the kid who played Dudley in that "very special" Diffr'nt Strokes. You know, the kid who was "touched." No word yet on The Gooch or the cast of the late 70s PBS show "High Feather."   Out :  urlLink The Frist-Daschle feud . According to  urlLink Geoff Earle of TheHill.com :  "Tensions between Senate Republican and Democratic leaders have surprisingly abated in recent weeks after a series of high-profile compromises.  "The relationship between  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist  (R-Tenn.) and  Minority Leader Tom Daschle  (D-S.D.) soured after Frist committed to attending a campaign rally in South Dakota for former Rep. John Thune (R-S.D.). The race between Daschle and Thune this fall is expected to be tight."  Apparently, the frost is having a thaw; cicadas and the scent of cherry blossoms are in the air on The Hill ... and, most importantly, "l'amour":  "The first breakthrough came last month, when Daschle and Frist reached a deal to move 25 judicial nominees. The powerful lawmakers secured a deal so that President BushÂ?s noncontroversial judicial appointments would be confirmed while Democrats retained their right to filibuster a handful of other nominees left out of the agreement.   "A separate leadership pact to clear a batch of executive nominees followed suit."  ( The Corsair  plays dramatic romantic music,  urlLink Monteverdi , for Daschle and Frist)   "Senate Democrats also allowed a major highway bill to proceed to a conference committee with the House, after receiving assurances from Frist that they would be included in the negotiations. Democrats had been blocking legislation from reaching conference to protest being shut out, infuriating Republicans."  ( The Corsair  dims the lights for Frist and Daschle)  "The latest sign of bipartisan cooperation came when Frist decided to cancel a scheduled cloture vote on a controversial class-action-reform bill. Republicans apparently have won over some key Democratic converts, finally reaching the crucial 60-vote threshold on the issue."  That article concludes with the sweet note:  "Frist and Daschle held at least one face-to-face meeting Tuesday, a possible sign that Frist is tempering his habit of communicating through his BlackBerry device.  "Daschle told reporters he holds out hope for action on a stalled asbestos bill and energy legislation, although he said there weren't great prospects for success on the class-action bill."  Love is putting aside the BlackBerry for a face-to-face.  The Blacker the Berry the sweeter the juice!   okay, that was not my most inspired line; but I couldn't figure out where I was going at the end.   In :  Ass kissing , but, in the world of high fashion, where beauty and backstabbing are the premium, it never goes out of style.  Carolina Herrerra , whom I am somewhat embarrassed to say I find oddly attractive, in a jet-set heiress kind of way, even though, she is, like, quite a bit  older  than me, kisses ass magnificently on  urlLink Fashionweekdaily :  "Who do you admire in the industry?  "I have a great admiration for  John Fairchild  and, following in his footsteps,  Patrick McCarthy . I admire  Suzy Menkes , who I think writes fantastically well. She has a lot of knowledge about fashion and writes about it in a wonderful way. And of course,  Anna Wintour . I admire her personal looks, not to mention her abilities as an editor."  How vaguely politic and dreadfully jolting Carolina, that you, a designer, admire fashion writers and editors that are important to your career? I still think she's hot, though, just a touch aristocratically duplicitous.   Out :  Hammy actors .  urlLink Le fucking jambon  already, okay?  Hello : The folks at the  urlLink LA.com blog ran this blind item :  "You all know him as a former master thespian who's as famous as he is pretentious. But to your dear Dolly (not to mention to the actor's coworkers) he's an insecure, hammy, royal pain in the butt. Just ask that Oscar-level director what happened when he quietly informed his prickly star that an emotionally juicy scene they had been scheduled to shoot needed to be completely rethought. Saying that Mr. Method Actor went off the deep end would be too gentle. He bellowed, yowled, punched the air, kicked furniture and pitched such a major meltdown that his histrionics spread onto the soundstage, where crew members practically had to restrain him from throttling his director. Too bad cameras weren't turning while the actor gave his greatest performance in ages."    Ka-pow!   The comments on the board after the story are weighted towards  Anthony Hopkins , but I'm not so sure. Thoughts?   In : Okay, when I am not working sensible, flexible hours at the job, when I am not blogging, when I am not imbibing The Sark at the local tavern, I have been reading Simon Publications paperback reissue of  urlLink Carl Van Doren's bio Benjamin Franklin , which is, so choice, I highly recommend it.  I can't put it down. Some of the best lines:  "But the wind abaiting the next day, we made a shift to reach Amboy before night, having been thirty hours on the water, without any victuals or drink but a bottle of filthy rum, and the water we sailed on being salt."  And this chestnut:  "An old woman in the town, of whom I bought gingerbread to eat on the water ... invited me to lodge at her house ... she was very hospitable, gave me a dinner of ox-cheek with great good will, accepting only a pot of ale in return."  And so Franklin, belly full of gingerbread and ox-cheek rambles through American history, mostly drunk, and chronicled, excellently, by Carl Van Doren. Ben Franklin comes off like  urlLink Encolpius in Petronius' Satyricon . This book is so hott.

       FLYBY: Jake Gyllenhall: The Next Superman   Sure, Tina Brown obsessed about him on Topic A on Sunday, and  Entertainment Weekly  gushed over him with their cover story this week, but now, as Superman,  Jake Gyllenhall  will finally get the chance of his star to shine, at least  urlLink according to Star :  "Although it's his starlet girlfriend  Kirsten Dunst  who makes him weak -- rather than Kryptonite -- sources say  Jake Gyllenhaal  is set to soar now that he's landed the coveted role of Superman. Star can exclusively report that Gyllenhaal, 23 -- best-known for his roles in  The Good Girl , with  Jennifer Aniston , 35, and  Donnie Darko  -- beat out actors like  Ashton Kutcher , 26 and  Brendan Fraser , 35, to play the Man of Steel."   The Corsair  quietly mouths the words:  "Brendan Frasier?!"   "Headshots of potential actors were on a wall under the characters'names in the film's production office, says an insider, adding: 'They used to have all these possibilities under Superman/Clark Kent. Now, there's only one headshot: Jake Gyllenhaal.'"   The Corsair  raises his arms in triumph, shouting, for all the world to hear: "Jake Gyllenhall: It Boy!"  "With his all-American good looks and proven acting skills, Gyllenhaal was reportedly once tapped as a backup to play Spider- Man in the sequel last spring, after  Tobey Maguire , 28, cited back problems just before the sequel went into production. Now, thanks to all the publicity and attention the potential role brought him, an insider says Warner Bros. has found their Superman. 'It showed them that Gyllenhaal could be thought of as a credible action-hero,' says the insider.  "The insider says many of Hollywood's hottest young actresses are being considered for the role of the brainy beautiful sidekick,  Lois Lane , including  Beyonce Knowles  and  Keira Knightley , both 22, according to sources. Meanwhile, That '70s Show star  Topher Grace , 25, is up for cub reporter Jimmy Olsen. The insider adds, the film will be directed by McG, 33, whose work includes the two Charlie's Angels movies and the hit TV show, The O.C."  Yes, Lois Lane, the star feature reporter for  The Daily Planet  must be a 22-year old hottie,  dont ask us why . We prefer she be played by a Victoria's Secret model.  "Star can also reveal that the production office is trying to keep the project top secret. 'Instead of the name Superman on the door, there's the code-name  Flyby ,' says the source. The role of Superman was made famous on the big screen by  Christopher Reeve , now 51, who appeared in four Superman films from 1978 to 1987. The movie's revival was reportedly first discussed in 1993, and reports say filming will begin in winter 2005, with a release in 2006. Gyllenhaal's reps would not comment."

       No Makeover for Tony Soprano   Ah, that significant cultural artifact  urlLink The National Enquirer , because enquiring minds want to know, gives us some broiling, icy-hot scoop today on  James Gandolfini , he who so  aggressively breathes  as he eats his Gambino-style Veal Chops Milanese (what's with Gandolfini and that aggro breathing? Is that  urlLink Stanislavsky ?):  "FUGGEDABOUDIT! In what's gotta be the dumbest freakin' move ever made by reality TV, those 'Queer Eye for the Straight Guy' queens suddenly invaded 'The Sopranos' set and -- with cameras crankin' -- chirped cheerily at hairybear bossman  James Gandolfini : 'HI, there! Ready for your makeover?' That's when all HELL broke loose, say insiders. Turning bright red with anger, Gandolfini snarled, 'Get the f--- away from me!' When his message didn't immediately register in the Queer Ear, Gandolfini exploded! "WHO THE F--- LET YOU IN HERE?" he shouted. 'TURN THOSE F----N' CAMERAS OFF . . . NOW!' Finally reacting to their star's outrage at the on-set ambush, 'Sopranos' producers -- who'd allowed the 'Queer Eye' invasion thinking Gandolfini would be amused -- quickly started shooing The Gay Gang toward the exit. Boss of All Bosses stormed off to his dressing room fuming, and refused to return until he'd been guaranteed there wasn't a Queer Eye in sight!"  What is it about tough guy roles that, when successful,  urlLink turn the actors into the characters  that they play? Is it the fact that actors have a fragile, perhaps nonexistent sense of self and the commercial and critical success gives him/her an option at selfhood? Or, maybe I'm just getting way too thoughtful about an ass.

       NY Post's Bruckman: Chris-tuh-fuh Will Sleep with the Fishes    urlLink The New York Post's Andy Bruckman  has an interesting theory about the last episode of The Sopranos, one that involves The our favorite Associate-wannabe-screenwriter  urlLink Chris-tuh-fuh Moltisanti , and some concrete footwear,  capeesh ?  "HERE'S some advice for Christopher Moltisanti:   "* Take a long vacation.   "* Don't accept any rides upstate.   "* Watch your back."  That ominous beginning wrought with impending doom slithers, like the grimy, shower inducing Soprano's opening theme-song, directly into:  "'The Sopranos' ends its fifth season  urlLink Sunday night at 9 on HBO . The one-hour episode - No. 65 - is titled  urlLink 'All Due Respect .'   "Here's the tantalizing description that was posted on HBO.com last week: 'Tony's [ James Gandolfini ] crew circles the wagons as Johnny Sack [ Vincent Curatola ] turns up the heat; Carmela [ Edie Falco ] counts her blessings; Christopher [ Michael Imperioli ] is freaked out by an unexpected visitor; Benny's [ Max Casella ] connection to the plumbers union comes in handy; A.J. [ Robert Iler ] demonstrates his business acumen; and Tony ponders whether to execute a 'sacrifice bunt.'"   And what can one glean from that  (elaborate hand gesture)? The Carmela angle is pretty straight forward ( The Corsair  pecks at Veal Piccata), her character has achieved some  equilibrium  over the past season. Last season, at the end, she had made an abrupt departure; now, at the end of this season, one year later, she has realized things about herself:  who she is ; and she has accepted the things she cannot change and, in the bargain, got some land. Carm's fine ( The Corsair  breaks off a magnanimous chunk garlic bread)   AJ  probably shakes down some smaller kids ( The Corsair  munches Marinated Asparagus Wrapped with Prosciutto). He is Tony's past repeating itself. In the picture on the HBO site AJ is on the phone, so I'm guessing, his "business acumen" involves sports betting of some kind. Maybe he becomes an amateur bookie? He's got that thug lite thing going ( urlLink in real life as well , but let's not go there), and a little loan sharking with a  hefty vig  for the private school set might be up his alley. I can see season six high comedy as AJ collects his vig from some luckless Preppy,  ninja-style .  The Johnny Sacks thing is more difficult to decipher and is probably tied to the "sacrifice bunt." Will Tony sacrifice an associate to win the game, or, at least, gain a stalemate? My guess is that Tony will sacrifice the other Tony, that  gavone  (munches from a plate of ziti and calzone), in a heartfelt ending, one where Gandolfini can really emote, and show off his acting chops.  But  Adam Bruckman  of the Post has an intriguing idea:  "Christopher's a screw-up. In the latest example, Tony had to step in and place Paulie Walnuts in charge of a cigarette hijacking operation that Christopher apparently botched.   "Christopher's an out-of-control hothead. He's already threatened Tony at least twice this season - once, when he showed up at the Bada Bing brandishing a pistol, and again just in the last episode, when he raved to Adriana that he ought to kill Tony for favoring the other Tony, Tony Blundetto (Steve Buscemi).   "And what if Christopher begins to question Tony's decision to murder Adriana? How mad might he get then?   "If Tony is contemplating a 'sacrifice bunt,' it's doubtful he's thinking about baseball. Does it mean he has to offer someone up to the New York mob? Might he offer his hotheaded, screwup of a nephew, who's not really his nephew anyway?   "And who's the 'unexpected visitor' who shows up at Christopher's door? That doesn't sound too promising for Christopher's future.   "That's the case so far. And even if Michael Imperioli has made no plans to appear in a network sitcom this fall, I'm sticking to it."  Interesting. There would have to be "h" involved. Perhaps the visitor is the ghost of Adriana? There are as many ghosts undistinguished from the living in The Sopranos as in any  urlLink Ingmar Bergman film . If Adriana comes back from the dead to psychologically haunt Chris-tuh-fuh, he is more likely to get in the witness protection program, but Bruckman's theory is interesting.  And what about the FBI? What are the odds that at the end everyone gets arrested by the boys in blue? ( The Corsair  sips some Grappa, then points the glass out, towards you, the readers)   Salut.

       An Interview with Patrick Swayze    urlLink Entertainment Weekly's  nubile journo  Jessica Shaw  did something that  The Corsair  has been trying to do for quite some time, namely, to interview pop icon  Patrick Swayze .  We would ask him about  urlLink The Outsiders  ("Stay gold, Ponyboy ...  stay gold "), and the horrible ... horrible  urlLink Too Wong Foo  (the title alone implies ...  noxious ).  But Our young  Jessica Shaw  didn't go there ...  no , she took it to a  whole new level  and interrogated  The Swayz  on his hip pop cultural "edge." Why does The Swayze have juice and, say,  urlLink Henry Winkler  does not? Why can The Swayze strut through The Fort Greene Mall in Brooklyn and not get a cap  busted in his ass ? Such are the mysteries of The Swayz:  urlLink he's like the wind .  And, while, yes, Jessica didn't  quite  give Swayze the respect that a man such as he deserves, a man of such  urlLink multitudinous mullets ;  but she got the job done .  And,  we like  what she did:   Jessica Shaw : Was it your work in  urlLink Tiger Warsaw  or  urlLink Three Wishes  that  urlLink inspired Ja Rule to cast you in his video for "The Reign"?    The Swayze :  urlLink There's this term that seems to have caught on throughout the hip hop rap world: 'I'm Swayze. '   Jessica Shaw : --I'm sorry?   S-Bone : If you do something cool or it's time to get down, you say,  urlLink 'I'm Swayze.'  If it's time to kick ass, you say,  urlLink 'I'm gonna Swayze on your ass.'    Jessica : You're telling me if I walk up to Jah Rule and say, 'I'm gonna Swayze on your ass,' and  urlLink he'll know what I mean?    P. Sway : Everybody does.  LL Cool J .  Snoop Dogg .

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  urlLink La.com ran this blind item today  that has me guessing:  "A certain ex-teen idol must be seriously jonesing for those brief glory days of screaming fans, magazine covers, paparazzi attention, and her pick of the hottest manflesh in show business. Lately, she’s been doing a few fairly low-key gigs, but even the teensiest taste of success brings out her inner psycho bitch. Suddenly she’s demanding big-time perks from producers and studios who doubt she’s worth the trouble anymore. She’s making her agents yank out their hair because she’s refusing roles she thinks are beneath her. And she’s also back to her old ways in the man department, putting the make on married older dudes, especially non-showbiz spouses of her female friends and costars. We’re doubting she'll get much career bounce from her newest projects, so maybe she should just go ahead with those cosmetic surgeries she’s been discussing with specialists in New York and Europe. If she hopes to stay in the game, the ultracompetitive actress better do something."   Jennifer Love Hewitt?  Just a guess.   Out :  Henry Kissinger  shows up on  urlLink Wonkette's Celebrity sightings in DC , and, as expected, things get hectic:  "Next mini celeb was the surprisingly hobbit-like  Henry Kissinger , who slipped out of a tremendous SUV in front of the Palm while I was dining with other plebes at C.F. Folks. Kissinger had a quick exchange with the limo driver, eyeballed passers-by briefly and disappeared into the swank (and skanky, in my opinion) confines of D.C's favorite long-beat power lunch trough.  "My dining partner said, 'you don't see a war criminal every day.'"   In :  Elle McPherson's  victory over post partum depression. Accroding to  urlLink British Vogue , the stunning mannequin suffered after the birth of her child:  "ELLE MACPHERSON has admitted that she was battling with post-natal depression when she checked herself into the Meadows Institute in Arizona last October. The 40-year-old supermodel, who is in Sydney this week to launch her new line of Intimates bedwear, told the  Herald Sun  that she completed a six-week intensive program because of total exhaustion and depression after the arrival of her second son,  Aurelius Cy , in February last year. 'I took the steps I needed to take in order to recover,' she said. 'The truth was, I just did what I needed to do and addressed a lot of issues that needed addressing and had a well-earned break, which I really needed as well. I had never done anything like that in my life and that's about it. I think it was made out to be a lot more dramatic and more insidious that it was.'"  Mcpherson is fully recovered.   Out : Will someone please kill  urlLink Rod Stewart ? You know, just fucking  smoke  his obnoxious ass and feathered hair in a colosally violent act. He's doing another tour (averted gaze). Of oldies.  Charmed , I'm sure.   In :  urlLink Lowculture's Take on The President's Umbrella problem.  It's hard to handle an umbrella in a storm and look Presidential. Very, very hard. Observe the 43rd President of the united States, the most powerful man in the world  urlLink here  (averted gaze).    Out :  urlLink Admiral Zinni for Vice President . Bad idea,  urlLink Water Isaacson ; the rarified air of Aspen seems to have addled the fine political mind of Walter, biographer/destroyer of Kissinger. There are too many heavyweights in the ring, like  John Edwards ,  Senator Nelson ,  Bill Richardson ,  Evan Bayh  (softly chuckles),  Dick Gephardt ,  Hillary Clinton  and -- quite possibly --  John McCain . Why the fuck would Kerry go for an unproven cruiserweight general, when  Wesley Clark , with higher name recognition, actually won the Oklahoma primary and can bring the Southwest into play?  urlLink Go back to Aspen, Walter , and contemplate Franklin and the discovery of lightning as electricity, and we'll call you when the race is over.   In :  Harper's Bazaar and Glamour , because, in the words of  urlLink honorary African-American Roger Friedman :  "Many congrats to the editors of both  Harper's Bazaar  and  Glamour . They each have black women on their covers this month. Queen Latifah is on the May cover of Glamour (I'm a little late mentioning this) and none other than Beyonce — in triplicate no less — is on the Bazaar cover. These were brave decisions considering that Vanity Fair still refuses to put a black person by him-or-herself on its cover. Both landmark Oscar winners Halle Berry and Denzel Washington have not appeared since their 2003 triumphs."  How is it that Roger Friedman, who is white, thinks of these things, and I, who am black, do not. Enquiring minds want to know.

          South Dakota Congressional Report: Stephanie Herseth beats Larry Diedrich   In a race that could forshadow things to come, South Dakota Democrat  urlLink Stephanie Herseth  edged past Republican  urlLink Larry Diedrich  in a squeaker. Why is a South Dakota Congressional race so important?   Well, first because it holds portents for the Senate race, the most highly contested race in the United States, a race that could see the Senate Minority Leader broken. I'm talking about the Thune-Daschle race, bruh; keep your eye on this little chestnut. And this is a race in which 100 years of tradition was smashed when the  urlLink Senate Majority Leader actively campaigned against Daschle , his counterpart from across the aisle. Fucking incredible, and a shining sybol of how civility has left the most aristocratic club in the world (outside of the princes of the Vatican): the United States Senate.   Second , this could be seen as a referendum against  George Bush . The  urlLink first lady campaigned for Diedrich . The  urlLink Speaker of the goddamned house campaigned for Diedrich . Cheney, a man with so many fucking negatives it boggles the mind, campaigned for Diedrich (hey, Wyoming is important to a Republican victory!) Whiffs of the  urlLink Thornberg-Wofford Senate race  (a fascinating race that figures high in the minds of politics geeks like me, a race which presaged the defeat of a seemingly invincible George Bush the Elder) are in the air. Remember when George, at above 90 percent approval ratings, sent his peasant farmer Attorney General Richard Thornberg to get his ass handed to him by Harris Wofford, an upstart with a health care message, in Pennsylvania?  You don't?  Okay, so maybe it's just me.   Third , South Dakota should be, by all rights, Bush country, no?   urlLink TheHill reports :  "South Dakota Democrat Stephanie Herseth narrowly defeated Republican Larry Diedrich Tuesday to win the House seat that eluded her two years ago.  "Herseth edged out Diedrich 51 percent to 49 percent to win the seat of Rep. Bill Janklow (R-S.D.), the former governor who resigned earlier this year after being convicted of vehicular manslaughter. Janklow defeated Herseth with 53 percent of the vote in 2002.  "Both parties invested heavily in the campaign, spending up to $4 million on the race. Party leaders such as Vice President Dick Cheney and Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) campaigned there.  "Herseth and Diedrich will meet again this fall in the general election. Herseth's win marks the second Democratic pick-up in a special election this year; Ben Chandler won a Kentucky House seat in February."

       Will Viacom Sell Off Radio assets?!    Or, Karmazin as Eisner Successor at Disney?   The exodus of  Mel Kamazin  at Viacom has rocked the  urlLink entertainment media universe  harder than  urlLink Mike Tyson did when punching out Wesley Snipes  back in the day  (Ka-Pow!).   urlLink Seth Seutel of AP reports :  "In a conference call with Wall Street analysts, (Viacom CEO Sumner) Redstone said Karmazin left because of 'frustration' with the company's sagging stock price and the lingering troubles at the company's radio division.   "Redstone suggested that Viacom's new management team would consider getting rid of the radio business, saying the company would have a 'hard look' at the radio operation as well as other assets. 'There is no sacred cow,' Redstone said. 'But for the time being we're committed to radio.'"   For the time being : What does this mean precisely for the beleagured  Howard Stern ? For the time being sounds like  urlLink Bryant Gumbel's first marriage .  Ooof!   urlLink Marksfriggin.com summarized Howard's on air thoughts :  "Howard hasn't heard from Mel yet and he figures it might have something to do with the company being a publicly traded company. He believes that no one at the company is going to back him up like Mel did so his days are really numbered now. He said that Mel told him that his show really hasn't changed and he was to just keep broadcasting like he was doing it. He talked about that conversation and how Mel convinced him to just go back to work and keep doing his show the way he was doing it. He has to work around the delay hits and stuff like that but he could keep doing the show.   "Howard is in shock this morning because Mel was his backup there at the company. Now he's got Les Moonves, who he has had problems with in the past, running the company. Howard sees a darkness at the end of his tunnel with all of this going on. It can't be good for his show because Mel had his back."  One caller, late in the show, gamely suggested to  urlLink Stern that he interview Karmazin on his ABC special . Howard said that was a good idea. And, that might be interesting considering  urlLink Karamzin has been mentioned as a successor to Eisner at Disney .  What this means to the beleagured Stern Show is, as yet, beyond the purview of  The Corsair's  crystal ball.   But Karmazin would be the perfect Eisner successor, no? You heard it here first, anyhoo; although we will back  Viacom  over  urlLink The Collapsing Mouse House  and their  urlLink last place network  and  urlLink cheesy theme parks  anyday.

       Halle Berre Can't Stop Breaking Wind    Or, Halle, Loosing an Isaiah (oh .... phew!)   According to  urlLink Ananova , via  urlLink TeenHollywood.com , "Halle Berry has confessed she can't stop breaking wind."   The Corsair  rubs his chin in confusion.  "According to Teenhollywood the actress has been on an intense exercise regime to shape up for her role in Catwoman and has been drinking protein shakes to help enhance her muscles.  "But she has discovered the drinks have given her some unwanted side effects.  "Halle confessed: 'It was wicked stuff. I had the worst gas in the world!'  The same,  The Corsair  would like to relate, could be said of her "performance" in the stinker "Losing Isaiah."  In fact, let it be that whenever Our Halle lets out a "silent but deadly," emission, it should to be referred to correctly as the Oscar Winner " urlLink loosing  an Isaiah."

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  John McCain and George Bush ? The Corsair would say, yeah, right, like two people who hate each other running together --  right.  But  urlLink the Village Voice sees it differently ,  shrewdly :  "June 9 is a key date in American politics. That's the day John McCain has to file if he's going to run for a fourth term as Arizona senator.   So far, all eyes have been focused on whether Kerry can persuade McCain to sign on as his veep on the Dem ticket. McCain has said over and over again he won't do it. But there's another possibility: If George Bush wanted to rescue himself from his current suicide dive, he could dump Cheney—whose negatives are substantial—and select McCain as his veep. If he did that, John Kerry would vanish without a trace."   and rumor has it  urlLink McCain will not seek relection .   Out : Senfeld's private garage is finally ready; the Porsche's are no longer homeless, thanks be to God (The Corsair crosses himself).  urlLink The guys at TheSmokinggun write , with the faintest ghost of a smaile:  "One of New York City's longest-running (and problem-plagued) construction projects has finally been completed. That's right, after five long years,  Jerry Seinfeld's  private Manhattan garage is finally ready to receive a handful of cars from the Porsche-loving comedian's pricey automobile collection.  "Seinfeld's multimillion-dollar renovation of a two-story building on West 83rd Street was completed late last month, according to an April 29 filing with the Department of Buildings. The 50-year-old performer purchased the property in March 1999 for $880,000 and almost immediately applied for demolition permits (the 16' x 52' building previously housed a plumbing & heating contractor). In what must now seem like wishful thinking, Seinfeld originally estimated the renovation at $500,000.   "According to Buildings permits, Seinfeld's garage will hold only five cars (three on the ground floor, two in the basement), though his rides will bunk in style."  Thank you Jerry,  thank you for housing those homeless Porsche's .   Out :  Pink "I'm Sorry For Fucking Someone Else, Baby" Diamonds . Charmed, I'm sure ( The Corsair  gives off  long, drawn out  averted gaze )   Anyhoo : Are  Kobi  and  Vanessa  secretly in  urlLink the throes  of  splitting up ? According to  urlLink that significant cultural artifact The National Enquirer , the answer is that  Vanessa is done with the expensive Kobi beef :  "Kobe Bryant's wife Vanessa is secretly talking to one of Hollywood's most successful divorce lawyers, The ENQUIRER has learned exclusively.  "And as the basketball great prepares to face his rape accuser in court, his wife has already been spending many nights away from home -- even when Kobe is in town!"  If this is the case, and if she is not gaining leverage of any kind, and if she is serious -- three big ifs -- then expect her to do it  after the verdict .    In :  Adam Moss' New York Magazine  is definitely in, if you look, for example, at  urlLink Matthew Flamm's laudatory article in Crain's :  "The recent food issue of New York magazine provided recipes for grilled mussels and black-pepper shrimp, and an introduction to the West Coast-inspired raw food craze. Typical stuff for the magazine's semiannual staple, which has long been a major draw for advertisers.  "But there was also something unusual about this particular food issue, which was the first under  Adam Moss , the former  New York Times Magazine  editor who became New York's editor in chief in February. Unlike past issues, it carried no gossipy features about the trendiest new restaurants.  "Even more shocking, perhaps, the articles had substance, most notably one detailing the bitter food fight among the city's gourmet retailers.  "In his efforts to revive the faded weekly, Mr. Moss has been making gradual but steady changes. He has phased out mentions of young models canoodling with their boyfriends, and raised the overall tone of the stories, targeting upscale readers in their 30s and 40s who had been turned off by the youth-oriented, tabloid quality of the magazine under his predecessor."  While  The Corsair  will still studiously detail the canoodlings of the media eliter as well as the  urlLink gaseous emissions of celebrities  as well as the  urlLink Vice Presidential sweepstakes  and  urlLink complex discussions of art , it is good, it is noble to see an editor try exclusively the route of the sober mind and still garner buzz (god help  The Corsair , who would have a dozen hits if not for  Ashton Kutscher's  canoodles and  urlLink Janet  and  urlLink Courtney's  boob). Bravo,  Adam Moss .   Out : The Prada retrial.  urlLink According to British Vogue Daily :  " PATRIZIA REGGIANI , who was jailed in 1998 for ordering the murder of her estranged husband,  Maurizio Gucci , is to be retried. Reggiani, who was nicknamed  urlLink The Black Widow  by the Italian press, was sentenced to 26 years in prison after hiring a hitman to kill her husband in March 1995 after a disagreement over her alimony payment. She has always maintained her innocence. Grandson of the founder of the Gucci empire, Maurizio was gunned down outside his Milan office in March 1995. Reggiani's daughter previously appealed for her mother's release on the grounds that her ability to reason had been affected by an earlier operation to remove a brain tumour. Her lawyer,  Danilo Buongiorno , told  Reuters  that the new hearing would begin on July 6 in Mestre, northern Italy."   I thought this was an open and shut  urlLink purse , I mean  case .     In :  A BiPartisan Prescription Drug Reimportation Bill in the Senate ?   urlLink According to Geoff Earle in TheHill :  "A bipartisan group of lawmakers claims it has lined up the 60 votes needed to get a prescription-drug reimportation bill through the Senate, which some say could lead the White House to change its position on the controversial issue.  "The legislators are leaning on  urlLink Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.)  to call up their bill — which would allow for the reimportation of prescription drugs from Canada and selected other countries — before the July 4 recess, as the window for significant legislative activity narrows.      "'We have a very good time frame,' said  urlLink Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.),  after the group met with Frist in his Capitol office shortly before the Memorial Day recess. 'We would like during the next work period to have the Senate consider' the bill. “We think we have the votes to pass it,' he said.  "The Dorgan legislation has only 21 co-sponsors but has attracted bipartisan support. Sens. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) and John Kerry (D-Mass.) are among the bill’s co-sponsors.  "Asked whether supporters could get 60 votes, Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-Maine) replied, 'In the final analysis, I think we could.'   "Others participating in the meeting with Frist were Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.). Frist is hoping Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) will be able to move a bill through committee that Frist can call up through “regular order.”  "But Snowe warned that supporters were 'looking for a vehicle' that they could attach it to if leaders don’t call up freestanding legislation.  "Those who attended the meeting said Frist still harbors concerns over safety issues related to reimporting drugs from other countries. But Snowe said the bipartisan group has been able to address many of Frist’s concerns by revising the bill. 'We really did a phenomenal job in precluding many of the safety issues,' said Snowe.  "The White House strongly opposed a reimportation bill that passed the House last year. But Snowe said she didn’t believe the president would veto a measure that has picked up broad support. 'It has the dynamic and the momentum to pass this year,' Snowe said. 'It’s the one area of social policy we can really get done.'  "'The question now,' she added, 'is hopefully being able to convince [Frist] and others that this is the year to do it.'"  What's that quiet chuckling sound we hear? Oh, don't worry, it's just  urlLink born-again moderate Trent Lott laughing  at  urlLink sticking it back to the Bush Administration  for, like, the millionth time this Congressional session.   Out :  Topic A with Tina Brown . According to  urlLink Gawker.com's Henry the Intern :  "And finally, the editor's desk roundtable tackled 'The Day After Tomorrow.' Tina mentioned Dennis Quaid's 'furrowed brow,' but her favorite moment was when  Jake Gyllenhaal  made snowshoes out of a New York library chair: "Everything is about terror now" and can "be resolved with snowshoes." Or Gyllenhaal 'trying to get laid while the world is ending,' said comedienne Jessi Klein, who enjoyed the destruction of Los Angeles. Toure, of Rolling Stone, preferred the scene where Mexicans blocked fleeing Americans: 'Hell yeah, bring it on!' He thought 'this is not an environmental film, it's a 9/11 movie. . . just the chaos of it' was 'quite scary.'  New York Times  environmental reporter  Andrew Revkin  said hesitant environmentalists decided to embrace the film when they realized 'it's a $200 million ad' for their cause. Similarly, he said, 'the administration has been very worried about the movie' because 'it is going to bring this issue to people who never think about.' But Toure disagreed: global warming 'is not sexy at all!' Klein observed the irony of throngs of people seeing a film about climate change in air-conditioned theaters.  "Attorney Ed Hayes played the role of Gail Sheehy this week: make the roundtable look younger and more hip by comparison.  Toure  and  Klein  showed the benefits of an energetic, vibrant roundtable; they should be regulars with 'Topic A' all-star  David Carr .   In : My former boss, Jason Calacanis, who is always in and ahead of the curve, gives  urlLink a favorable verdict to the new G4 Network  (Formerly Tech TV):  "I’m watching the G4 network, which is dedicated to video game, right now and I’m actually impressed.  "Anytime I’ve watched a show about video games before I’ve been bored out of my mind, but they have taken a very insider approach. For example, they are featuring an Alias video game and talking to the writers and directors of the TV show about the games they like and the integration of the story lines in the game and the TV show. It’s pretty slick and I’m getting the urge to go play Command and Conquer."

       Razor Magazine's Sleazy Howard Stern "Exclusive"   ( Note : AJ has been since been vindicated. The fault was with Razor Magazine, not AJ. I frankly like the guy, after our little contretemps. So, read this piece of history with those facts in mind)  Way out in sleazy la-la land is  urlLink Razor Magazine . According to their web site, Razor is, "for men who seek quality as a way of life – and in what they read.  "RAZOR is dedicated to capturing the broad spectrum of issues that are important to men and presenting them in an edgy, sophisticated manner with sex appeal and pertinent, thought-provoking journalism.  "RAZOR targets the smart, selective, professional male looking for a magazine that incorporates all aspects of his lifestyle with substance and class.  "Confident, Refined and Provocative – Without Compromising on Intelligence."  Thought provoking journalism? Refined? Quality? Class? Without compromising on intelligence?  Apparently the oily  urlLink A.J. Benza , he who admits to rarely wearing underwear, cannot be reached by email because all mail bounces, wrote and "exclusive" interview of  Howard Stern  for their June issue which Howard Stern on air today has  denied  that the interview ever took place.   Where the fuck are the fact checkers at that sleaze ball operation?    urlLink Lloyd Grove writes in the Daily news :  "Did he or didn't he?  "The folks at Razor magazine have been making a big deal about their 'exclusive' Howard Stern interview purportedly conducted by former Daily News gossip A.J. Benza.  "But Stern insists the alleged interview never happened.  "It's part of Razor's June cover story on the blue-tongued radio jock's troubles with the Federal Communications Commission.  "I'm told that Razor's editors got very anxious the other day when Stern went on the air to deny that he ever gave Benza or anyone else an interview.  "'According to  urlLink MarksFriggin.com , a fan site that summarizes Stern's shows, 'Howard refused [Razor's interview request] and it never happened ...  He thinks it's kind of funny that the magazine is putting out a press release saying that they have an exclusive with him when they don't.'  "I hear that the Razor editors' anxiety level increased when E-mails to Benza, who has written for the mag on and off since 2001, were bounced back with the message that the address was invalid."   The Corsair  grabs a box of unsalted popcorn and is riveted to the screen.  "'I have a hard time believing that  A.J. Benza  would make up quotes about somebody as prolific and newsworthy as Howard Stern,' Razor publisher  Richard Botto  told me. ( Ed Note : Richard Botto has since been fingered as the culprit) 'I think it would be career suicide, and I think A.J. knows that.'  "But while Benza told me he didn't make up any quotes for the article, 'I never interviewed Howard. I made some calls to him personally as a friend,' he explained. 'We spent about 30 seconds talking about the FCC, but it wasn't under the guise of an interview. But then the magazine put out a press release about an exclusive interview. It's just stupid. It's ridiculous.'"  "When I relayed Benza's comments to Botto, the publisher wasn't happy.  "'He's clearly flip-flopping his position,' Botto said. 'That wasn't the way he presented it to our editors. It's a shame. I hate to see him take what I think is a terrific piece and turn it into something negative.'  "Benza, for his part, told me: 'They still owe me a check.'"  The Corsair saw the interview, which is just a cut and paste of things stern has said over the air dressed up with pro-Stern rants.  Note to A.J.: Don't look forward to the check, baby.

       Christian Slater Likes The Strippers    urlLink Those 3AM girls  once again serve up a dish of some extra spicy fixins, with silicone enhanced ... uhm, "enhancements" (ka-pow!):   "...The 34-year-old  True Romance  star gave his credit card a severe pounding during a trip to London lapdancing club  Sophisticats  ( The Corsair  averts his gaze at the highly  dubious  namings of  urlLink British flesh establisments ) on Wednesday.  "And even though he's worth a fortune, he got a huge shock when he was handed the bill for his evening's, er, entertainment.  "'Slater racked up a really hefty bill,' says our spy at the club."   The Corsair  grabs some unsalted popcorn and, in a single elegant "sophisti-catted" leap ( ka-pow !), lands right in front of his screen.  "'It came to around ( $14,540 ). Perhaps lap dances are cheaper in America because he wasn't too happy about coughing up the cash. But he did eventually pay up.'"  " ... He was so taken with the dancers, he whisked six of them off to a private room.  "Our source adds: 'Christian was there on his own and he hand-picked the blonde bombshells to party on with him."   The Corsair  sips a glass of Cutty Sark, leans back on the sofa, turns on Kid Rock CD and watches all the action in the room.  "'(Slater) took them into the blacked-out VIP room where he enjoyed private dances for hours.  "'It's hard to believe he's a big movie star. He didn't look like a sex symbol at all - more like a scruffy tramp wearing just cheap jeans and a shirt."   Damn . Whatever happened to the testosterone-laden anthem: "Whatever happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas?" Did that just go the way of the Dodo or what?  Huh? The  humanity :  "He seemed to be the worse for wear and was drinking champagne. But he loved the attention the girls were giving him. It's a bit sad, though, if you have to pay for that attention."  "Slater, a father of two who is married to  urlLink Ryan Haddon  ( Ed Note : That mugshot link may be the prime reason Slater needs the "extra" loving, if you can dig it), seems to be a bit of a lapdancing aficionado.  "He joined Ben Affleck on a wild night out at a Canadian strip bar last year - an event which led to a serious fall-out between Ben and J.Lo. And this isn't his first visit to Sophisticats either.  "'Last time he arrived with three or four friends and spent loads of cash,' reveals our spy. 'They were drinking bottles of Cristal Rose champagne at ($900) a time.'  "A club spokesman confirmed: 'Yes, we had a visit from Christian Slater. It's his second time - he really likes it here. He had dances from six girls. There were two in particular he liked, both young blondes. He was having a hell of a lot of fun with them.'"  I hope it was worth  $14,540  of sophisticash (ka-pow!).

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  urlLink Elvis Mitchell's "Unusual" book proposal . According to the excellent  Sara Nelson  in yesterday's NY Post:  " Elvis Mitchell , former New York Times reporter, has landed in the middle of a book auction. His proposal for a book about the comedian  urlLink Richard Pryor  is currently on the desks of several prominent New York editors.   "The proposal is 'unusual,' says one editor who has seen it. It is nonlinear and suggests that the book will be part cultural history of America, part tour of the comedy world, part dishy anecdotes about Pryor — including one in which the comedian's scatological language made New Yorker writer  Lillian Ross  not just blush, but faint."  Unusual as that is, apparently,  urlLink leaving the New York Times  and  urlLink palling around with the likes of Bill Murray  does wonders for one's career, I suppose, as Sara Nelson concludes, "The bidding is now in the low six figures, but one industry observer predicts that the book — which Mitchell promises to deliver in two years — will ultimately go for around $500,000."   Which  almost  makes up for the fact that he is, indeed, a black man named Elvis.   Out :  urlLink Bruce Willis and Brooke Burns . First they were supposed to be engaged. Then he denied it. Now, they have brokeen up,  urlLink according to The Sun , for the sake of their kids:  "BRUCE Willis’s ex spoke of their split for the first time yesterday — and said it was so they could focus on their families.   " Brooke Burns , 26, has a baby girl and film star Bruce, 49, has three daughters by  Demi Moore .  "They parted last week. But actress Brooke said: 'We remain really good friends. He’s an amazing guy and we have a ball together, even still.'"  And, what better way to amplify on a major life change than by becoming trannie-whore loving  Eddie Murphy's  neighbor("my girl likes to party all the time ..."),  urlLink according to The New York Post :  "CALL him Beverly Hills Bruce. Action hero and real estate magnate Bruce Willis has just bought the two-story split-level Benedict Canyon home of movie producer  urlLink Alan Ladd Jr . for just under $10 million. Remodeled in 1999 by Ladd, (whose films include 'Braveheart,' 'The Phantom' and 'The Man in the Iron Mask') and wife  Cindra , the large home combines the beauty of a classic Spanish haciendastyle home with all the requisite technological trappings."  Wealth means never having to marry for the sake of kids. And, there's nothing like starting off the day off with some real estate gossip for we,  dear reader , the summerhome-less.   In : Sure he has that creepy buzzard-like stare, but  urlLink Issac Mizrahi  is so very "in." Back from the dead, really. According to fashionweekdaily:  " Isaac Mizrahi  will return to the runway on Monday night for the first time since 1998, with his Target-hosted fashion show at Cipriani 42nd Street. The Daily has learned that Diane Sawyer, director  urlLink Mike Nichols ,  urlLink Jason Biggs , and photographer  urlLink Bruce Weber  are some of the confirmed A-listers who will join New York society’s elite, including  Helen Schifter ,  urlLink Aerin Lauder ,  urlLink Nina Griscom , and  Marjorie Raein , in honoring the Parsons graduate and quadruple-CFDA award winner.  Mizrahi, whose label has been revitalized in recent years, will present his Isaac Mizrahi for Target and Isaac Mizrahi New York Couture collections"  On June 15th, he will present a fashion show online  urlLink here .    Out :  War , war, what's it good for ...  good god, y'all . What the fuck is up? First  urlLink Gothamist and Jason Calacanis , two of the nicest entities in the blogosphere get into a tussel, then the barbarians started ganging up on the beautiful  urlLink Lindsay Robertson , now  urlLink the Hampton's , the playground of the rich, have "got it twisted," (averted gaze) according to the  urlLink NY Post Hampton's Diary :  "THE war of the East End mags is just plain nasty.   "On Saturday night at  Nick & Toni's , one witness claims they saw Jason Oliver Nixon, editor in chief of  Jason Binn's  glossy Hamptons magazine, pick up a freshly placed stack of  Joan Jedell's Hampton Sheet  off the porch and fling them into the bushes.   "Sources in the Hamptons-mag camp confirm Nixon and his friends were waiting for a table at the East Hampton eatery when Jedell, president and CEO of Hampton Sheet, came by to drop off June issues of her mag.   "But they wholeheartedly and heatedly deny that Nixon touched the rival magazine.   "Either way, Jedell's pages managed to go airborne. And when Jedell found out that someone had littered the shrubbery with her publication, sources say she retaliated in kind by throwing Hamptons magazines over the railing."  Class will tell. What? Is everyone eating spicy food or something?

       Esquire Lives    originally published January 4, 2004:   Imagine our surprise at finding that  Esquire  did not, in fact, evaporate into an inert gas sometime in the late 90s as is commonly thought among the chattering classes. No,  it actually is  still  being published.  Not only that, true believer, but the January 2004 issue is pretty yummy indeed. It drinks, like  The Corsair , deep from the  urlLink cup of wit , partaking liberally from its libations. In their  What I've Learned   section, they manage all manner of fun from everyone including that  Sir Edmund Hillary  of social climbers,  Lynda Carter , who went from being a middle calibre piece of ass to, dare we say it, a "Wonder Woman" to the trophy wife of a genuine pasty pink aging Washington power player. You go, grrrl (averted gaze). Aging Hollywood swordsman  Jack Nicholson  ("ah, grasshopper ..."), who  Lara Flynn Boyle  likes to call  urlLink "chief,"  also makes an appearance in Eskie (It is rumored --I'm not kidding here -- that when she dated  David Spade , her nickname for him was "peanut"). Here's what  urlLink Wonder Woman  had to say:  "This modeling agency I'd gone to was putting on the  Miss USA  contest. Why would I want to run around in a bathing suit? But my mother and sister talked me into it. Three weeks later, I was Miss USA. Didn't even sing. There was no talent: it was all tits and ass."  Well, to each our strong points. And  Jack Black  and  Kyle Gass  turn out this little chestnut:   Kyle : Who we'd like to meet?  Jesus .  Jack : You should say  I  instead of  we . I think Jesus would be a big fuckin letdown. You'd find out he's just a dude. He might be a real boring hang. He might be a really kick ass rabbi. You'd want to know the answer to everything and he'd say, 'How should I know? I'm just Jesus.' Plus you don't know how to speak ancient Aramaic. I say, let's go back to see someone who for sure kicked ass. Let's go fucking chat it up with  Plato .  Kyle : Talk about a language barrier. You're not gonna be knowin any of the Greek. I'd like to meet  Hitler  when he was an artist in Austria. Hang with him. I used to dream about this. I fantasized that I went to art school with the Beatles ...  Jack : Dude, you better finish up that fuckin Hitler thought. You left it on a really wierd note.  Kyle : Oh! I would just be checking Hitler out. Telling him, maybe you should stick with the painting."   Esquire , the gift that keeps on giving.

       "It was like Freddie Blassie was coming into your house"   An excerpt from  urlLink Listen, You Pencil Necks, by "Classie" Freddie Blassie .   Kosuke Takeuchi , President,  Weekly Gong Magazine   "In 1962 we were still feeling the loss of World War II, and when  Rikidozan  beat (classy Freddy) Blassie for  urlLink the WWA championship , he defeated the Americans.  "Everybody I knew watched Blassie's match with Rikidozan on tv. The televisions were only black-and-white then, so Blassie's hair looked white.  urlLink His eyes were popping out  and he had blood all over himself. He was really frightening.  "I've seen lots of foreign wrestlers -- Americans had been coming to Japan for several years as  urlLink heels  --  but never a heel like this . We were used to wrestlers picking up chairs and hitting opponents with them. That was as bad as it got. Blassie was the first time (the Japanese) ever saw bite somebody and draw blood. Blood would not only pour down the front of his face, but the chest and even the back of his head.  It was shocking .  "In the past the foreign heel would come in and lose. Then, he would accept his loss like a Japanese athelete would. Blassie was the only wrestler who, when he would lose, he still wanted to bite someone. In Japan, which is an orderly nation, we didn't understand this maniacal kind of man.  "Blassie always bragged that when Japanese people saw him on tv, they had heart attacks and died. This is true. TV was still very new in Japan, and only 50 percent of the population had tvs. So, big groups of people sat together to watch wrestling. There still wasn't an understanding of the distance between yourself and the television. It was like Freddie Blassie was coming into your house. And there was a certain type of hysteria that upset some of the older Japanese people to the point where they had heart attacks and died.  "Blassie knew about what happened. The reporters in Japan told him about the details. I don't know how he felt privately, he didn't seem to care. He said, 'If you're too old or ill, don't watch me on tv. If you do, you get what you deserve.'"  And that's why he was "Classie"

       Family Values Limbaugh Ends Third Marriage   Pumpkinheaded family values exemplar Rush Limbaugh has is ending his third marriage. Shrewdly, he announced it on Friday, thus hoping it would be buried in the little read Saturday papers. But  The Corsair never sleeps .  According to the  urlLink Washington Post :  "Conservative radio host  Rush Limbaugh  said on Friday that he and his third wife,  urlLink Marta , had mutually decided to end their marriage of 10 years.   "A statement issued through Los Angeles-based public relations firm Sitrick and Company said the Limbaughs 'have separated pending an amicable resolution.' It was not clear whether either party had formally filed for divorce.   "A spokesman at Sitrick declined to provide further details.   "Limbaugh and his third wife, a former aerobics instructor he met on the Internet, were married in May 1994 at the home of U.S. Supreme Court Justice  urlLink Clarence Thomas  in a ceremony officiated by Thomas himself.   "His two previous marriages ended in divorce."  Well then, there you go:  Clarence Thomas  was the jinx; er, either that or this story speaks to the futility of finding commitment with aerobics instructors that you meet over the internet. The article continues, warbling, like a sad, slow cautionary  urlLink Willie Nelson song  of American woe:  "Word of Limbaugh's latest marital difficulties come as the outspoken radio personality has come under investigation by prosecutors in Palm Beach County, Florida, where he lives, over allegations of illegal doctor-shopping for painkillers.   "Limbaugh, 53, who has not been charged, admitted in October of last year to becoming addicted to prescription painkillers he took for back pain. He took a five-week break from his syndicated radio show to check into a drug rehabilitation center."  When will Rush stop blathering about  urlLink the morality of others , which, no doubt, gives him a bloated feeling of superiority, and look to his own sorry affairs?  Maybe now?   urlLink The Page Sixers  elaborate:  "RUSH Limbaugh put out a statement yesterday that he and his third wife, Marta, had separated — but only after PAGE SIX called to confirm what we'd learned exclusively. Sources in Palm Beach say Marta dumped the burly blowhard and vacated the couple's home on North Ocean Boulevard. The two are quietly working out a divorce agreement. Limbaugh met Marta on the Internet and they married in 1994. Since then, Marta has seen Limbaugh through ballooning weight gains, deafness (a cochlear implant in 2002 restored 80 percent of his hearing), his prescription pill addiction, rehab and a police investigation. Signs of trouble first came last year in November when one pal of Limbaugh said: 'Marta didn't go visit him [at the in-patient treatment center] once until the very end. It was odd.' Insiders say there is probably a pre-nup, but Marta may get more as she 'knows where all of his skeletons are. That's why there are these . . . discussions.'"   ( The Corsair  cues  urlLink ominous music )  ".... Discussions?!"

'They are friends,' a close friend of  urlLink Stronach's  told the CanWest News Service last year, 'but there is not a romantic linkage. It's just not that way ... you shouldn't jump to conclusions that they are having a serious fling,' though the friend added Stronach's 'intrigued' by Clinton's 'charisma, brainpower, particularly his knowledge of world events.'

Out :  urlLink Ben Affleck , out with bronchitis, according to  urlLink Ananova , via  urlLink IMDB :  " Ben Affleck  has been readmitted to hospital for the second time in a week suffering from severe bronchitis.

"Reading a lot of  urlLink Henry James ,  urlLink Balzac , and  urlLink Edith Wharton  in school. They were really the ultimate social chroniclers.

(I certainly didn't -- I'd rather be bludgeoned with a radio than listen to it.)

Then his cronies start naming the kids, 'Malcolm X Charles, Charles Charles, Ray Charles, Jr.' and laughing."   Charmed , I'm sure.

'When people who buy T-shirts think of 'In the Zone,' they think of Lite Breeze,' ummmm, I don't think I would, actually. I'll even go out on a limb and suggest that 9 out of 10 people would agree with that.

       Vin Diesel's Ambiguous Racial Derivation   Is Vin Diesel black? Is he white? Is he mocachino? Just what is he? After reading the  urlLink Details Magazine  cover story in the June/July issue I still haven't the faintest idea. Here's what  they  say:  "In real life, Diesel's father (technically his stepfather, who came into Diesel's life when he was 1, he has never met his biological father) was an actor and a director of  some  racial background, reputed to be African American. His mother was a strologer-psychologist, and in addition to his younger sister, he has one younger brother and a blonde blue eyed fraternal twin brother."  Say  what ?  The article continues:  "The monologue at the end of (Vin Diesel's indie breakout film)  urlLink Multi-Facial  is something close to a manifesto. In it, Diesel describes going as a child to see his father play the lead in A Raisin in the Sun and thinking that everything his father said was related to him. After referring to a scene in which his father, playing a father, talks on stage about pride, he concludes: For years I thought he wanted me to act just like him, to be a black actor, like  Danny Glover  or  Sidney Poitier  or  Morgan Freeman . Just like my dad. But I was never black enough. My dad died last year. And only then did I realize how ignorant I was ... My dad was a black actor. But he wanted me to go one step further. He wanted me to be an actor. Just an actor. That's what he meant when he said proud."  Okay: I still don't know what his race is but that overblown speech certainly qualifies him as a  urlLink ham .   Ed. Note : Because of a meeting tommorrow, I won't be doing the blog. Sorry.

While Zac held court at a reserved table right on the dance floor—where he stripped down to just a tank top as he danced with  urlLink Natalie Portman  to (Jay Z and Beyonce's) 'Crazy in Love' while showering partygoers with rose petals—the Diddy roamed the club, shaking hands and stopping the music to share the good news with the entire crowd, just in case any guests had forgotten they were partying with winners."  And, of course, Diddy, not unaware of the importance of that significant cultural ritual the "after party", made an announcement befitting the occasion:  "P. Diddy announced that he had signed  urlLink Tyson Beckford  to be the face of  Sean John  for the next two years.  Apparently Diddy and Posen stopped by the competition, that would be  urlLink Elizabeth Salzman and Tom Ford's CFDA after party .  P Diddy: Best Week Ever?

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  Scarlett Johannsen  as the pouty childish diva. You know the Tinseltown buzz on Scarlett, gentle reader -- she's ( sotto voce ) "mature beyond her years," (pauses, quietly sipping a  urlLink 1973 Chateau Le Trehon ) after the role in which she played opposite the excellent  Bill Murray  in  urlLink Lost in Translation . But, according to  urlLink that significant cultural artifact Star , it's all a sexy lie wrapped in lingerie and saucy come-hither looks:  " Scarlett Johansson  may have a career that older actresses envy, but off-camera, the 19-year-old just wants to act her age. Unfortunately, behaving like a normal girl has proved difficult for Scarlett, whose mother and management team are constantly trying to make her seem more sophisticated, according to sources. 'They want her to be the next  Meryl Streep ,' a friend told an insider. 'They see her as a leading lady, playing roles from the ages of 18 to 30 and expect her to look the part.'  "In addition, says the insider, Scarlett is often coached to sound more mature than she really is. 'she gets fed up because even when she's not acting,' says the friend, 'she's being forced to behave like a different person.'  God, who in the world would ever think that Hollywood is fake?   Out :  Courtney Love , who, once again, is scheduled to give us some "Court Love court room" drama,  Law and Order style . Chung-chung! On the docket will be: impromptu  urlLink bathroom press conferences , the inappropriate spraying of hot tears, the  urlLink suckling of McDonald's clientelle , and, of course, flip comments excecuted with rock star dash  urlLink ("silly case, silly dress")  --  the works .  urlLink According to Ananova :  "An arrest warrant has been issued for  Courtney Love  after she was charged with attacking another woman.  "Love is said to have attacked the woman with a bottle and a torch at the home of her former manager and ex-boyfriend.  "An arrest warrant has been issued for the felony charge of assault with a deadly weapon. She is expected to surrender to police today."  And, for those of you with a morbid taste for the decline and Fall of a rocker,  urlLink TheSmokingGun  delves into the specifics:  " Courtney Love  has been charged with felony assault for allegedly battering a fellow female rock singer with a bottle and metal flashlight during an April attack at the same Los Angeles home where the troubled performer had been arrested last October. According to the below June 2 criminal complaint--which charges Love with assault with a deadly weapon--the performer attacked  urlLink Kristin King , a 28-year-old singer/guitarist who fronts an L.A. rock trio. King, pictured at right, is a younger and blonder version of the 39-year-old Love and is a favorite of  Eric Erlandson , Love's former guitar man in the band Hole."   In :  Narsicism , it's the new black. Or, as  urlLink Dick Morris writes on the subject today  in his comparison of Clinton and Reagan:  "A narcissist needs a mirror so that he can see himself, and measure his self-worth, in the reflected opinions of others. But narcissists don’t want just any mirror. The more beautiful, bright, charismatic, charming and attractive people are, the more psychologically nurturing they are as a mirror for the narcissist."  And Morris knows wherof he speaks on the need to impress people as a part of their self esteem.  urlLink Was it Howard Kurtz  who wrote on Dick Morris' episode with calling on Bill Clinton while with a "lady of the evening"?  "(hooker Sherry) Rowlands also recounted an episode in which she said Morris let her listen in on a phone conversation with the president:   "Hillary answered the phone and she said the president was exercising at the moment and she would get him . . . and when [Clinton] came back he sounds really mad . . . and he said, 'Look, Dick, I would prefer you not use this phone anymore. You can understand Hillary is upset, my wife is not well, you know with all this Whitewater trial and everything, she is not well. You know the regular lines, do not call the private residence anymore.' And he was embarrassed and he said, 'I'm sorry, sir' and hung up.'"  Isn't this just a case of the pol calling the Clinton wack?     Out :  Henry Kissinger . I still cannot believe that Henry Kissinger is allowed to walk the streets free and unfettered by chains. Increasingly, his behavior mirrors that of the dictators he hustled in the 70s. In the June 3rd issue of The Nation,  urlLink Scott Sherman   chronicles the odd anti-American behavior of the Machiavellian in Winter:  "Last November  Foreign Affairs , the prestigious journal of the  Council on Foreign Relations , published a review of The Pinochet File: A Declassified Dossier on Atrocity and Accountability, a new book by  urlLink Peter Kornbluh , director of the  urlLink National Security Archive's Chile Documentation Project . Written by the council's chief Latin America expert,  urlLink Kenneth Maxwell , the review upset two former statesmen who figure prominently in the book and who also happen to be influential actors at the council: Henry Kissinger and his longtime associate  urlLink William Rogers . In May, after  urlLink an acrimonious exchange between Rogers and Maxwell in Foreign Affairs  -- an exchange that Maxwell insists was abruptly curtailed as a result of pressure from  urlLink Kissinger  and Rogers--Maxwell resigned in protest from the council. His departure raises questions about intellectual freedom at the council; about editorial independence at Foreign Affairs, where Maxwell spent eleven years as Western Hemisphere book reviewer; and about Kissinger's and Rogers's influence on the nation's pre-eminent foreign policy think tank."   In :  Seal and Heidi Klum and baby Leni : perhaps the cutest family unit ever.  urlLink According to Daily Vogue :  "HEIDI KLUM has never felt love like it. The 31-year-old German supermodel, who gave birth to daughter Leni just one month ago, describes motherhood as 'amazing'. Having already regained her figure in time to turn up on the red carpet with her new man, Seal, in tow at the  urlLink CFDA awards on Monday night , Klum told reporters that she had never felt better. 'You don't truly understand it until you experience it yourself,' she said. 'It really is a kind of love I've never felt before.' Admitting that she is also in love with the British singer who is said to be enjoying taking an active role in little Leni's life, Klum denied that marriage was on the cards. 'I'm in love now, but I don't need a wedding band to prove it,' she said."   Out :  The Sean Hannity versus Al Franken Feud  is getting a little bit ...  wierd . Okay, it's out-and-out  urlLink Space 1999  (an ensemble cast that so ably included  Martin Landau  and  Barbara Bain  as, respectively  Commander John Koening  and  Dr. Helena Russell  ... thank you, thank you; you are too kind).  urlLink TV Barn notes today :  "Yesterday Bodies Like Ours sent an action alert containing a transcript excerpt from comedian and radio talk show host  urlLink Al Franken  containing an insensitive joke about intersex people and conjoined twins he made on his Air America show June 2, 2004. Many people reacted immediately by sending emails to the show expressing their dismay.  "In a great example of how collective action can succeed, Al Franken will be issuing an apology for the remarks today on his show. Bodies Like Ours appreciates the quick response from  urlLink Mr. Franken  and his producer Ben Wikler in airing an apology."  And, the apology?  "On Wednesday's 'Fighting Hannity's Lies with Lies About Hannity' segment, I falsely claimed that Sean Hannity was born a hermaphroditic conjoined twin, and that the doctor who delivered him and his twin reacted in horror at their birth. I would like to apologize to members of the intersexed and conjoined-twin communities for furthering the unjustified stigma attached to these conditions. An estimated one in 2000 people are born with atypical genitalia, which, like conjoinment, is a naturally-occurring bodily variation. I am sorry for the ill-considered joke."   urlLink Very Space 1999 , like I said.   In :  The Tom Freston Les Moonves Feud .  urlLink The Defamer  keeps us on the up and up:  "The New York Post claims that MTV founder/TRL superfan Tom Freston has the advantage in the race to succeed Sumner Redstone as CEO of Viacom. (Quick catch-up for those joining us late: President  Mel Karmazin  recently quit the Big V, and Redstone named Freston and CBS head/evil mastermind Les Moonves as co-presidents, setting up a King Lear-style succession quagmire. King Lear was a 1997 TV movie starring Ian Holm.)"  And also  also In :  urlLink Fashionweekdaily gives us this scoop :  " Donna Karan  and  urlLink Ingrid Sischy  are teaming up for the second time for  urlLink Donna Karan: The Journey of a Woman  (Assouline), a coffee table book due out this September. The book, which has been in development for the past nine months, follows the yoga-loving designer’s illustrious career from her early days at Anne Klein to the icon status she holds today."  I look forward to it, cheers Ingrid.  And, finally, also in: My old Boss Jason Calacanis  urlLink brings back the good memories  for kids who grew up in New York and remember the WPIX game "Pix," where kids would run home to play the interactive game on the phone with the tv station -- pre-Chose Your Own Adventure.

       Paris Hilton: "If people actually take (My Book) seriously, I'll be embarassed."    In the  urlLink June 2004 issue of Hollywood Life, Paris Hilton , in an interview with  Stephen Rebello , gets deep:  "Another project Hilton would like to do wis a screen version of  urlLink Gigi Levangie Grazer's  satirical Hollywood novel  urlLink Maneater . 'I loved that book and if they make that a movie, I want to be in it. I love  urlLink Jackie Collins  too, everything she does, and I love her personally," says Hilton, who could easily be a character in one of Collins' racy novels.   Hilton's affection for girly books is perhaps part of her reason for doing a comedic as-told-to book,  urlLink Confessions of an Heiress , due out in the Fall from Simon and Schuster. But another reason is that today, invariably, every celebrity must publish a book. She breezily describes it as "about  urlLink my life , my friends, it has lots of pictures, and its just kind of a book for girls about how to be an heiress. If people actually take it seriously, I'll be embarassed. I mean, there's a chapter from my dog, Tinkerbell, who has her own diary."  With that, her adored teacup Chihuahua  Tinkerbell , who sometimes sports her own designer booties, goes prancing around the studio like the pampered princess she has every right to be. "Tinkerbell is my life," says Hilton, with genuine emotion. "I love her so much, I can't imagine losing her. I will die when she dies. I really won't know what to do."

       Britney Disses Bono's Progeny    urlLink The 3AM Girls  serve up the pipin hot scoop on Britney:  "THERE'S nobody quite like Britney Spears when it comes to erratic behaviour.  "According to our spies, the 22-year-old diva 'had a turn' following one of her gigs in Dublin last week."   The Corsair  turns up Mobb Deep's Got It Twisted, grabs a bowl of unsalted popcorn and reads  "And who was it that rattled the poor poppet? Step forward the children of rock legend and all-round decent bloke Bono.  "The U2 frontman's kids were at the concert and wanted to meet Brit backstage after the gig. As it turned out, that was easier said than done.  "'Britney was having none of it,' an insider reveals. 'She just point-blank refused to meet them and they were very disappointed.  "'She made some excuse about being too tired. It's ridiculous if she thinks she's too important to meet the offspring of a legend like Bono.'"   The Corsair  continues:  "... Our source added: 'Some of Colin Farrell's neighbours were there with their children and Britney had them ushered straight inside."  "Perhaps the change in attitude had something to do with  urlLink Britney's fling with 28-year-old Farrell last year .  "'He's a great looking guy,' says our insider. 'Colin's hot property right now. So who could blame Britney if  urlLink she still has a soft spot for him  and wants to make a good impression on his neighbours?'"  "Hmm, one person who might mind is current lover  urlLink Kevin Federline . The loved-up couple had arrived in Ireland by private jet, before being whisked to the plush Westbury Hotel in a blacked-out limo.  "... According to our source: ' ... Kevin's main role appeared to be chief bag carrier.'   urlLink Sit, Kevin, sit  ... good dog.

       Connecticut Governor Rowland: Got It Twisted   I've adressed the problem of  urlLink Connecticut's corrupt Governor before  quite brutally. I thought I was done with Rowland (regally sips a mulled claret with cardamom seeds), that I had made him scream for mercy from under the weight of my snark. Evidently not (abruptly tosses glass of claret into a roaring fire). My backhand was not sufficient. No matter. It appears I must deal with him again (slowly, menacingly, removes red velvet gloves).  ( The Corsair  strolls, speaking clearly and evenly) According to  urlLink AP writer Susan Haigh :  "Hearings that could end with a call for  urlLink Gov. John G. Rowland's  impeachment opened Tuesday with investigators prepared to lay out details of a seven-year-old real estate deal that one legislative leader says is central to the probe.   "'... Never before has this state conducted an impeachment inquiry relating to its governor, and never before has a committee of the General Assembly faced what you faced, a decision whether to recommend that a popularly elected governor be removed from office,' he said.   I wrote a blog post waaay back on December 19th (most of you didn't read me back then, I understand, I wasn't cool yet), and still, Rowland clings to the office, his short and greedy fingers clutching at the vestiges of power. Resign, Givernor Rowland ...  resign .  And to help you on your way(reprinted form December 19):   Shadenfreude  is a  bitch , let me tell you, gentle reader. And there is nothing worse that being  urlLink hoisted by ones own petard , spraying hot tears, in the media capitol of the world. I know this  instinctively , as an occasional practitioner of that spooky art of "media" in this city. Well, sport sounds less pretentious than art, so let's call it  that .   Never in my life have I seen a sitting politician receiving so many bitchslaps, in such rapid succession, within, ostensibly, a season of holiday warmth and bonhomie towards humankind, as are being issued to urlLink Governor Rowland of Connecticut .  Never  (affects "outraged" tone).   If this beating took place in the ring,  Judge Mills Lane  would throw in a skimpy white towel and send  urlLink Governor Rowie's black-and-blue broken body, spent from the bitchslaps, to the showers . Pronto! It's  over , Johnny.  It's over to everyone  but the Rowland's , which makes this  little political shadenfreude  particularly touching and cruel and fascinating in observation; it's like watching a couple of ants, slowly by slowly, reeling under the heat of a magnifying glass -- knowing what is going to happen next.    Equally  sizzling  a proposition, Connecticut's Governor, a thick-headed man, by  refusing  to just resign  that damn job  in the face of rising public anger, is not doing himself a service. This stubborn man is getting a long, protracted vivisection from  urlLink everyone in the media biz . A  serious  vivisection, my little pomegranates, to which his wife is, sadly, a party.  Connecticut  Governor John Rowland , and his wife, his "partner-in-crime"  , so to speak ,  Patricia , are  too good to be true  and too sad to be true,  simultaneously : to paraphrase Mobb Deep, my current musical obsession: The  urlLink Governor's got it twisted . There is a snarky  blogger heaven  where bloggers are 24/7 press access to the Rowland's, to trap the gaffes, like beetles in amber, ad infinitum; there is also a blogger  hell , where the conscience of the blogger creeps up and asks the man -- can't you just leave them  alone ?  I  can't.  (averted gaze, exaggerated cough suggesting feigned detatchment)   First off , Governor  John Rowland  is ethically challenged. Now, I don't know whether this is because ethics are  invisible  little creatures (goddamn them!) that cannot be spacially located, but even by the standards of politicians, Rowland is creepily  devoid  of ethics,  of an ethical comapss ; oh, why mince it, for fucks sake: devoid of even a single negative imperative imprinted upon his psyche, those chestnuts that make us fit for civilization (puffs out chest, gets all into the "moralizing,"). At the very least a beast like Rowland should wear an ethics jacket because everyone else is wearing one.  But no, our Rowlie cannot be bothered.   For example, (December 19th)  urlLink Times ties Rowland's "paving contractor" (munches on a  urlLink Veal Piccata ) to his controversial partnership in a private deveolpment group  (wink wink, he'll thake care of  that thing  for ya).  What's up with that ?   Since when do politicians engage in business ventures with ties to their precinct  while still in office  -- that's crazy talk: what was he doing, pulling a  Mariah ?    Rowland was absent with the sniffles  in "political corruption" class on the day  urlLink Ambassador Lauder  taught everyone to make your scrilla after you leave office and have cemented your contacts,  preferably in an emerging democracy, where the legal framework is dodgy at best , and  urlLink the vulture , I mean venture capitalist can roam in search of carrion and monopolies at will.   And then there is that whole country house angle  with the Rowlands. Not that I am against summer houses, per se, if you go in for that sort of thing (averted gaze), even though I (sniff, sniff), like the majority of Americans are  summer homeless . Summer house issues, air-conditioned dog houses thingies, (sigh) these  issues (gets emotionally worked up) just don't work out with the electorate, even in an electorate as wealthy as there are in Connecticut (slams hand impotently next to his laptop). Be afraid, Rowland (puffs out chest), be  very very  afraid.  But of all the Christmastime fun surrounding this *dramedy* the Rowland's, produced, of course, by  Asaad Kelada , was yesterday's press conference, where husband and First Lady, like Bonnie and Clyde, took on the press -- big mistake, baby pop --  urlLink in poetry  -- a bigger fatter  Greek  mistake -- was a moment of great  hysterical , and historical significance.  And I do not mean to say that they  urlLink quoted   Edmund Spenser , or  Rilke  or even  Dr. Suess , people.  No , the Rowland's, well, Patricia, to be frank, with moral support from "her man," read a "witty" attack on the media in the form of  urlLink Twas the Night Before Christmas .  ( The Corsair  cringes at the thought)  The NY Times yesterday described the delivery as a "sing-song rebuke." It goes a little something like this:  "Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house, not a creature was stirring, except me, the first spouse."  ( The Corsair  cringes, knowing that this is just the beginning)   "I was waiting for Santa, that jolly old elf, to give him the list I had drawn up myself.  "For I had hung all the garland and tinseled the trees and festooned the house for the public to see.  "I'd sent all the cards to our friends far and near, and thanked all our staff for their hard work this year.  "I'd shopped and I wrapped all my gifts full of love for our five picky teens, the black Lab and the guv.  "I kept quiet and calm through December's dark storm, protecting my family from those who wish harm.  (Corsair cringes again)  "So now it was my turn to get Santa's ear, to tell him what I wanted for Christmas this year.  "When out on my yard there arose such a hubbub, I thought maybe [Hartford Courant reporter] Jon Lender had jumped in the hot tub."  --You see where this is going? No? I must continue? Very well:  "Now surely that man needs to go soak his head, but there on the lawn stood Santa instead.  "'Come in, dear Santa, and rest for a while. I've got cookies and milk,' I said with a smile.  "'I am late,' said Santa. 'My last stop took hours, all that coal I delivered down The Courant's tall towers.  "'They used to be good girls and boys,' Santa said. 'But the poison pen's power has gone to their head.  "'And I have the same problem at the media stations; they've just simply forgotten good human relations.  "'Their thirst and hunger for the day's biggest story has earned them black coal for their ill-gotten glory.'  "'Oh Santa,' I said, 'that is sad, I agree. They've acted like Grinches who have stolen our tree.'  "'They whipped themselves into a mad feeding frenzy. They've embarrassed our children and our Mama McKenzie [Jo McKenzie, a longtime aide]."  Here is how  Alison Leigh Cowan  and  Marc Santora  of the Times described the event:  "After the poem's tone became clear and the audience gasped, she glanced at the governor to assess his reaction. 'Go for it, hon,' he said. 'What can they do to us?'  "'They can't make it worse,' she replied, and continued reading."  The media can't make it worse, honey? I just did. And, as I write this, many media organizations in the tri state area are doing worse ...  much  worse. But enough, even I have had enough of this shadenfreude; it's just too sad. Resign, Governor Rowland,  resign .  ( Ed Note : Roughly six months later, it did get worse.)

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  Jazz at Lincoln Center at The Apollo . Our pal, the wonderful  David Patrick Columbia , faithfully continues his running chronicle, in his breezy yet vital tone, of our leading social and artistic luminaries in  urlLink NY Social Diary . Another day in the life of  DPC :  "We were up at the fabled Apollo theatre on 125th Street where Jazz at Lincoln Center was holding its third annual gala concert and dinner, 'Teach Me Tonight.'   " urlLink Cedric the Entertainer  was host with performances by  urlLink Bob Dylan ,  urlLink Al Jarreau ,  urlLink Branford Marsalis ,  urlLink Renee Olstead ,  urlLink James Taylor  and  the Wynton Marsalis Septet . There must have been more than a thousand guests filling the legendary theater, and afterwards 700 of them moved to the tents behind the theatre for an Asian dinner provided by Taste Caterers.  "Bob Dylan in a jazz concert on the stage of the Apollo? Scruffy-looking as ever, accompanied by his harmonica and the Marsalis Septet, he sang a jazz version of 'Don’t Think Twice (it’s all right)' and jazz it was. And Dylan it was too. Same with James Taylor who sang a couple of his own compositions."  Doesn't it appear as if David is having the most fabulous life?  urlLink Follow your bliss , David, it's all good.   Out :  urlLink On the La.com blog , this blind item is pungent, punky even (played, so ably, by the way, by  Soleil Moon Frye  ... thank you, thank you):  "The Smelly Starlet   "If you want to see owners and managers of pricey clothing boutiques freak, just be there whenever this popular international dish comes cruising into their swank establishments trailed by her army of friends, relatives, flunkies and hangers-on. A clotheshorse and big spender, she spends hours and hours trying on only fashion’s costliest threads. Problem is,  urlLink she’s so careless about her personal hygiene  that once she wears something, it reeks so badly of her personal scent that it can’t possibly be sold retail anymore--so her try-ons first get seriously dry-cleaned, then shipped to discount racks. The doll is so stanky that after she completed shooting her recent hit movie, the wardrobe people burned her costumes to a crisp because they were totally unusable. This helps explain why she hooked up with her slightly less famous current squeeze, whose many erotic fetishes include flooding his sniffer with overripe body aromas."  The only comment mentions  Penelope Cruz , who certainly fits the "international dish" bill and "slightly less famous current squeeze" thingie ( Matthew McConaughey ), but when was the last time she had a hit?  Blow ?  Any other guesses or do go just with Penelope?    In :  urlLink I see white people ! No colorful people in sight for a Silver Springs advance screening of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkhaban doubling as an  urlLink AFI tribute to MPAA President Jack Valenti . It's either that, or an Emmylou Harris concert. Or ice hockey.   ( Ed Note : Warning, before you read further, for some reason  The Corsair  is on a racial kick today)   Out :  urlLink Carmen Kass . It looks like the Eastern European hottie will not be Estonia's EU delegate,  urlLink according to Daily Vogue , in fact, she'll get her Kass kicked:  " urlLink CARMEN KASS  has almost no chance of being voted into parliament, according to Estonia's opinion polls. The 25-year-old supermodel, who was voted Model of the Year at the VH1/Vogue awards in 2000, was chosen by her country's ruling right wing Res Publica party as one of 12 candidates for the first deputies of the recently enlarged European Union. But the polls show that Kass has less than one per cent of voters on side. Despite calling the experience 'an opportunity which I couldn't miss', Kass has admitted that not being elected will not be the end of the world. 'It will be a pity for me if I will not be elected, but not a catastrophe,' she told AFP. 'It's the people's choice.' If the votes were to swing her way, however, she is prepared to give her modelling second place in her list of priorities to do the job. 'If people elect me to do this job, I don't have any other choice, I have to go,' she went on. 'It will be hard at the beginning for sure. But after 11 years in a modeling career there are few things I have not done, so I will hardly put much effort into it. Mostly I will dedicate myself to parliamentary work.' And she isn't taking the lack of votes personally. 'Estonians have maybe forgotten about me, because I have been abroad for a long time,' she said. 'But I haven't forgotten about Estonia.  I remember where my roots are .'"    The Corsair  will respectfully refrain from pointing out that  urlLink Carmen's roots are indeed brown , although the hair is blonde.   In :  urlLink Michael Musto  is one of the few writers who can go totally off on a moral argument, but do it in such an offhand, funny manner, that it disarms the punch but leaves the kick, drawing in even the most skeptical of readers:  "In the wildly nostalgic 2003–4 season on the Great White Way, African Americans were represented by a maid, a slave, street urchins, a downtrodden ghetto family, and an ape. You've come a long way, baby! (Yes, I know these are well-meaning, beautiful portrayals of black roots—except for the ape—but let's vary it up a bit, folks. At least throw in a modern servant once in a while, deal?)"   urlLink We heart Musto.  (link via  urlLink Gawker )  More brilliance a la Musto:  "On the show, fab PHYLICIA RASHAD is go-going nuts, giving such a cuckoo grande-dame acceptance speech that her first name, clearly, is God."  and, my personal fave:  "Moving on to a past Tony nominee, I love me some MERYL STREEP because, if anyone could grandiosely intone self-serving stuff like 'As an actor . . . ' it's huh, and she never does! It's only people who were in  urlLink That's So Raven  or CSI: Hoboken that spew such flouncy crapola."  Damn,  The Corsair  wanted to be the first to make a snarky That's So Raven reference, but the Must beat us to it.   Out : All the  Ronald Reagan  historical revisionism ignores the fact that his "constructive engagement" with the brutal totalitarian Apartheid regime.   As  urlLink Richard Knight told the General Assembly in 1984 :  "The Reagan administration's policy of constructive engagement has already led to a significant relaxation of the arms embargo.  Stressing the goal of regional stability the American government has now adopted a policy which they see as an "even handed" approach to all countries in the region.  Thus the Reagan administration seeks to blame all sides equally for the violence in the region, ignoring the fact that the violence stems from apartheid.  In reality there is no even handedness in the U.S.'s engagement in southern Africa; policy in the last three years has resulted in an increased South African ability to harass and dominate regionally."  And it all ultimately played out as  urlLink Usinfo.state.gov says :  "The charismatic Anglican bishop,  Desmond Tutu , rallied western support with his call for a boycott of South Africa, primarily through economic sanctions. The administration of Ronald Reagan opposed formal sanctions, preferring to exert quiet pressure to speed up reform. But the demand for sanctions could not be quieted, and in 1986 Congress overrode a presidential veto to ban the importation of South African goods and prohibit American business investments in South Africa.  "While some critics believe the sanctions were more symbolic than anything else, others claim that they did contribute to rapid political change in South Africa. In 1990  President F.W. de Klerk  released  Nelson Mandela  after twenty-seven years of imprisonment, opened negotiations with the ANC and scrapped most of the apartheid laws. In 1992 a strong majority of the country's white population voted to endorse de Klerk's dismantling of apartheid and the extension of political rights to the black majority. When this happened, President Bush lifted the economic sanctions, claiming that the purpose of the bill had been successfully carried out."   Let's review : Reagan coddled the totalitarian regime, A Democratic congress blocked his veto and imposed sanctions against the Apartheid regime, and, four years later, Nelson Mandela is released, and two years after that democratic elections are held. Now, you tell me why Reagan is a hero.   In : Sick of all the Reagan propaganda? Reagan fatigued, yet?

       Wrapping up the CFDA Awards: P Diddy and Sarah Jessica Parker are the Stars    urlLink Sarah Jessica Parker  got the CFDA Fashion Icon Award last night.  urlLink According to Ananova :  "Parker, wearing a pink and black lace vintage halter dress by the late Hollywood costumer  urlLink Howard Greer , said she was 'thrilled.'  "'Fashion is my fatal flaw. It's my weakness. Sometimes you see something you want and you can't have it, but in my case ... ' she trailed off to laughter from the crowd.  "'Sarah Jessica Parker represents the fact that high fashion - which had been divorced from reality for a while - is now a little more entwined with what people are wearing,' said Glamour editor in chief  urlLink Cindi Leive .  " P Diddy  was named the top menswear designer of the year for his Sean John collection at the awards; he beat veterans and previous winners  Ralph Lauren  and  Michael Kors .  "'I'm very happy as you can see. I'm living the American dream' he said.   urlLink Vogue Daily , also covering the festivities, noted:  "'It's not whether you win or lose,' Sean Combs said last year, 'it's what you wear to the after party.' But priorities were changed last night and the man we used to call Puff Daddy finally got what he wanted - the Menswear Designer of the Year gong at the annual CFDA awards. The four times-nominated style maker trumped previous winners  urlLink Ralph Lauren  and  urlLink Michael Kors , but he didn't bear a grudge in spite of being open about his disappointment in the past. 'I'm very happy as you can see,' he said, having danced his way to the New York Public Library's podium. Explaining to an audience of 400 designers, models and Hollywood stars that he had once 'saved his pennies' for a Ralph Lauren shirt, he claimed now to be 'living the American dream', before shouting out: 'Ralph, you're still the sexiest man on the planet!'  urlLink Carolina Herrera , meanwhile, trounced  urlLink Marc Jacobs ,  urlLink Ralph Rucci  and  Michael Kors  by winning the Womenswear Designer of the Year award, while Coach's  urlLink Reed Krakoff , who was up against  urlLink Edmundo Castillo  in the Accessories category, also went home triumphant. Combs' new fashion protégé,  urlLink Zac Posen , won the  urlLink Perry Ellis Award for Emerging talent  and went onto co-host the night's most starry after party in Marquee with him. The ceremony, which featured a performance from American Idol winner Fantasia Barrino, also honoured  urlLink Sarah Jessica Parker  as Fashion Icon of the Year,  Donna Karan  for a lifetime of achievement,  urlLink Miuccia Prada  as International Designer of the Year and  urlLink Tom Ford  in a special tribute to his contribution to international fashion. But it was definitely Puff's night. 'At the end of the day, there's nothing more dreary than menswear,' said Barney's creative director,  urlLink Simon Doonan . 'But he's brought a huge burst of energy into the industry.'"

       X-Tina's Drrty Patents!    Christina Aguilera  is on to lingerie, according to  urlLink British Glamour's Daily Gossip :  "A WORLD OF PANTS    "Move over  Damaris ,  Agent Provocateur  and  FrostFrench , Christina Aguilera is moving in on the luxury lingerie market. The Stripped singer has asked the US Patent and Trademark Office to approve designs for a range of knickers, due to hit shops next year."   The Corsair  immediately lunges up angrily, a look of righteous indignation on his face, then, slowly, he realizes, 'oh,  knickers  ... I thought the article said ...'  "But that's not all (Christina's) planning to put her name to: with what looks like world domination in her sights, Christina has also registered patents for 451 other items, including crayons, antiperspirant, skiwear, badminton sets, contact lenses and ominously 'electronic multiple activity toys', ropes and handcuffs!"

       Jay Z's Chicken Wing Chef    urlLink The 3AM Girls  serve up quite the spicy appetizer today:  "MILLIONAIRE rapper  Jay-Z  is living proof that money can't buy you taste.  "Instead of spending his dough on eating out at the world's finest restaurants, the plucky star has added a new member to his burgeoning entourage - a dedicated chicken-wing chef."   The Corsair  appreciates the "dedication" to that lost art form, but he wonders if this interferes with girlfriend  urlLink Beyonce's lifetime free supply of Popeye's fried chicken .  "And Jay-Z is so convinced even London's poshest restaurants can't cater for him that he recently insisted his cook step in and take over the kitchens of one of them.  Oh, it's London ... well there you go: boiled food doesn't go over well in the hood; a hood needs  the secret soul ingredient , the (makes finger marks in the air) "hot sauce."  "A source close to  Beyonce Knowles'  other half disclosed: 'Jay-Z had some important meetings in London and one of them took place at Nobu."  "But the ... Japanese cuisine - a favourite of celebs such as  Robbie Williams  and  Pink  - wasn't to 34-year-old Jay-Z's taste.  "Our spy continued: 'He was very polite but he made it clear that raw fish wasn't his thing. He had a couple of drinks and then left to go to flash caviar restaurant  La Plume , which he'd heard was accommodating to stars' demands.'  "And it's just as well because this time the rapper wasn't taking any chances. We're told: 'A member of his entourage called ahead and said that he'd only come if his chicken-wing chef could take over the kitchen.  "'When the cook arrived he was in a panic as he wasn't sure if he'd brought enough Tabasco sauce for his secret recipe. It was pretty obvious Jay-Z wouldn't have been happy if it wasn't right."   The Corsair  nods knowingly at the primacy of hot sauce  with the urban palate .  "'He also likes to know where his chicken comes from and there's only one family-run farm in Mexico that he trusts."  Rappers can be eccentric about their food and  urlLink food supplements .  "'His new cook is responsible for making sure there are  100 wings  from this place available for him and his flunkies to eat every night.'   He got 99 problems but the wings aint one.

Little grinning clusters of them, everywhere you turned, kids who were bopping to hip-hop one minute, the Grateful Dead the next, sipping Coors Light and Budweiser. At least 50. Maybe more. Guys sporting khaki shorts, crimped baseball caps, creased Oxford shirts, flip-flops; girls in tight jeans, tighter tank tops, tiny flounce skirts.

"MacBride was more than a little annoyed.

Filming her newest movie, she was unusually unpleasant to everyone around her, avoiding conversation by constantly sticking her nose in a book or newspaper, speaking to coworkers only when she absolutely had to (and even then only in hostile grunts), and snarling at anyone who tried to be even moderately friendly. Our Lady of the Rampant Mood Swings gave off such a leave-me-alone vibe that production assistants privately drew straws and paid each other off in an effort to avoid having to deal with her directly. With all that fame and acclaim you’d think she’d be proud of her accomplishments--so what’s her big complaint? She has convinced herself that she is revolting to the opposite sex. Somebody ought to tell her it isn’t her face, figure or brain power that sucks, it’s her twisted 'tude."  The consensus on the board is  Bette Midler .

       Bill Clinton on 60 Minutes: And So, "The Summer of Clinton" Begins   Bill Clinton is set to break television and book sales records as his very own Summer of Clinton begins. We are right now in the calm before Hurricane Clinton storms the media landscape. Just in time too, as watching  urlLink Senator John Kerry  in "action" ( The Corsair  yawns) is about as exciting as watching  urlLink plants produce oxygen . Although I haven't read the book, only excerpts, all accounts of those who have read longer excerpts (or  AP  which has an actual copy -- those crafties) point in the direction of Clinton utilizing one part down-homey Ozark wisdom suffused with one part simple message of Christian "forgiveness" against the detractors of his life; very Passion of the Christ-like. This, I believe, will be regarded favorably by African-Americans, Latinos and middle class Christians alike, who, historically, have been most receptive to the  urlLink Christian Beatitudes . The "people of oppression," as  urlLink Russell Simmons might say .  urlLink Brilliant strategy , by the way ( The Corsair  elegantly tips a glass of Grappa in Clinton's direction), affecting the posture of Christ in the face of his enemies, who always seem to rise in direct proportion to Clinton's likeability. His own shadows taking form. Do all world leaders battle their internal shadows in the public arena like Clinton?  But then, Clinton was always  urlLink precocious . One has to admire the global scale to which Clinton plays The Game, down to  urlLink his very ground of being  he is a political animal, the biggest cat in the jungle, from that  urlLink handshake with JFK .  Make no mistake : The race for the Clinton legacy begins on Sunday, the same day, incidentally, that the Clinton Summer begins.  Once this is all over, Clinton quite possibly might be a sort of Global Preacher to the Oppressed, not inconceivably a future Secretary General of the UN, or, more likely (considering the massive Republican opposition to that concept), an Oprah-esque talk show host, globally syndicated, bringing untold billions to whatever media company acquires it. As  urlLink CBS's website reports :  "Former President Bill Clinton calls his fight against his impeachment a 'badge of honor' in an exclusive and wide-ranging 60 Minutes interview with Dan Rather to be broadcast Sunday, June 20, at 7 p.m. ET/PT."  Or, as  urlLink Newsweek's Howard Fineman  describes it:  "The rollout is vintage Clinton--charming, down home and completely calculated. In speeches and interviews, the former president has coyly hinted at great revelations amid 'My Life?s' 957 pages. But it?s a tease: he shows just enough leg to make you want to buy the book."  And  urlLink Reuters reports  of the released audio excerpts on his  urlLink historic handshake with Kennedy :  "... Readers' opportunity to hear Clinton read more enticing excerpts will come in the next few days, as Time Warner Inc.'s AOL releases an excerpt entitled 'I started crying' on Saturday, another entitled 'I loved & forgave him' the next day and 'Marriage remains' on Monday, a spokeswoman said.  "Clinton's choice of opening excerpt, with its references to two of America's most respected presidents, is a way to position himself in a way he wants to be perceived, said John Baker, editorial director of Publishers Weekly.  "'I'm sure he was aware that everyone would be looking for the racy bits, and he wants to come out of the gate first as a statesman-like figure,' Baker said.  But back to  urlLink CBS's account  of the Rather interview:   "In the candid, sometimes emotional interview, the 42nd president of the United States talks about his public and private life ? soon to be revealed in his upcoming memoir  urlLink My Life .   "He also discusses his Arkansas childhood and family, his times as Arkansas governor, and the triumphs and failures of his presidency."  Unfortunately -- or, fortunately, depending on how you view matters --  urlLink today's New York Times focused almost exclusively  on the Lewinsky scandal. The Old Gray Lady likes the saucy bits, it appears. That and the endless repetition that Hillary Clinton looked "as if she had been punched in the gut" when she learned the truth. Bill slept on the couch for two months ( The Corsair  yawns). By next week you will have heard about that about a hundred times, mark my words. Personally, I'd rather hear about his childhood, his thoughts on Vietnam, Kosovo and the Rwanda debacle.   urlLink CBS's site  continues:  "'For him to talk about his personal life in these terms is pretty extraordinary,' says Rather of his interview with Mr. Clinton.   "'The interview is explosive, revealing, insightful, and reflective. We've never seen a former president talk about his life the way he's done.'"  Which is why  The Corsair  cannot wait to see Clinton being New Age Sensitive President on Oprah. You know Oprah, more than Rather, will get Clinton to emote, to look back on his history.   "Mr. Clinton tells Rather he is proud that he fought the impeachment battle that failed to drive him from office.   "'I didn't quit. I never thought of resigning and I stood up to it and beat it back,' he tells Rather.   "'The whole battle was a badge of honor. I don't see it as a stain, because it was illegitimate,' says Mr. Clinton of the impeachment process that he calls 'an abuse of power.'"   urlLink The AP , which  urlLink mysteriously obtained an early copy of the book , amplifies on that point:  "Clinton said his biggest presidential mistake was a 1994 decision that would ultimately lead to his impeachment - asking then-Attorney General  Janet Reno  to name a prosecutor to look into his Whitewater land dealings.  "He said he was not worried about the prosecutor, because he had nothing to hide. But Clinton observed that he may have been so worn out and upset by the death of his mother that he failed to make what now seems the wiser choice - release the necessary papers, give Democrats a thorough briefing and seek their support.  "The original prosecutor,  Robert Fiske , was succeeded by Kenneth Starr, and the investigation was eventually expanded to include Clinton's affair with Lewinsky.  "Writing about his 1998 impeachment, Clinton said Republican leaders were not punishing him for dishonesty or immoral conduct in having an affair with Lewinsky and lying about it under oath. He said he believed the reason was power, and because his political goals were different from theirs.  "He survived the ordeal and remained focused on his job because of the support of the White House staff and Cabinet - even those who felt betrayed by his behavior - numerous world leaders, and encouraging words from both friends and strangers.  "He even expressed gratitude to his political enemies for bringing him and his wife closer together. And once the impeachment process was over, his eviction - of at least two months - to the couch in a living room next to the bedroom ended, too, he said."   urlLink The CBS site on the Rather interview  continues:  "Mr. Clinton views his economic plan as the greatest accomplishment of his presidency.   "'I kept score, how many people's lives were better off,' he tells Rather. 'I think the fact that we were able to have 22 million jobs and record home ownership and lower interest rates ? people actually had the ability to do more things than ever before.'   "He had many days as president that he counts among his best, including his efforts to help the residents of Kosovo and rid the world of a dictator. 'The day that Kosovar war ended and I knew Milosevic's days were numbered was a great day. I had a lot of great days,' he says.   "The failure high on his list of regrets is the affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky that he terms 'a terrible moral error.'  "The affair?s disclosure put him, he says, 'in the doghouse' with his wife and also threatened to alienate his daughter, Chelsea. The family was able to overcome its terrible effect through counseling, however.   "Hillary, says Mr. Clinton, needed time with him to decide whether she would stay married to him.   "'We'd take a day a week, and we did a whole day a week every week for a year, maybe a little more and did counseling,' says Mr. Clinton. 'We did it together. We did it individually. We did family work.'"  Did this involve  urlLink Jesse Jackson ?   "Why did Mr. Clinton commit adultery? He tells Rather there is no rational explanation. 'I did something for the worst possible reason. Just because I could,' says Mr. Clinton. 'I think that's just about the most morally indefensible reason anybody could have for doing anything.'   "Rather interviewed Mr. Clinton in his home in Chappaqua, N.Y., June 15, and last weekend in Arkansas, where Mr. Clinton took 60 Minutes cameras to his childhood home in Hope, the capitol in Little Rock, and to Hot Springs, where he grew up.   "The interview addresses all the important aspects of Mr. Clinton's life. He speaks about the issues of his presidency, including the war on terror and Osama bin Laden and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, regretting his failure to convince Yasser Arafat to accept a proposal he thought could finally bring peace."  I'm so there for you Dan Rather. So very there.

       Bill Murray Versus Chevy Chase   From  urlLink Live from New York by Tom Shales and James Andrew Mills :  " Bill Murray   "I got into a fight with Chevy (Chase) the night he came back to host. That was because I was the new guy, and it was sort of like it was my job to do that. It would have been too petty for someone else to do that. Its almost like I was goaded into that. I did sense that. I think they resented Chevy for leaving, and leaving and making his own career go. Everybody else was from the improvisational world, where you don't make it about you. You were an ensemble, you were a company. So when he left, there was resentment about that. It was a shock.  "At the same time, Chevy was the big potato on the stew. He got the most sketches, he had the most influence, he got the publicity -- all of those things. So they didn't miss that part of it. But there was still hangover feelings that he shouldn't have left until everybody had that. You make sure everybody else is there and then you do it.  "It did leave a big vacuum, because he was really heavy in those shows. You look at those early shows and he's heavy. And so you had a whole year when the writers ended up writing, like writers do -- they write for the guys who can get it done, who can get it on the air -- and Chevy's sketches got on the air because he was "the man," you know. The other actors had to start from scratch and teach the writers how to write for them ... When you become famous, you've got a year or two where you act like an asshole. You can't help yourself. It happens to everybody. You've got, like, two years to pull it together -- or it's permanent.   John Landis   "I've only been to SNL three times, and one time I was there, Chevy and Billy were having this huge screaming fight in the hallway, and Michael O'Donahue and Tom Davis were holding them back, and John and Danny jumped in because Chevy and Billy were really going to come to blows. I mean, it was a huge argument. And the thing I remember about Billy Murray -- I didn't know Bill Murray, but he's screaming, you know, foaming at the mouth, 'Fucking Chevy,' and in anger he says, 'Medium talent!' And I thought, 'Oh boy, that's funny.  In anger he says 'medium talent.' That really impressed me. I went, 'So, Bill Murray -- wow, who is that guy?'   Laraine Newman   "It seems that there was a tension between Chevy and Bill all along during the week. I don't know why. I don't know if Chevy provoked it or not. But it culminated with Billy saying to Chevy, 'why don't you fuck your wife once in a while?' And I don't even remember who threw the first punch, Billy or Chevy. But it was ugly. I'd never seen guys fighting like that, let alone people I knew. And, you know, I don't know how he did it, but Chevy went out and did the monologue a few minutes later. Watching from the floor, he seemed shattered.   Lorne Michaels   "Billy Joel, the musical guest, was out singing his heart out while this was going on backstage."

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  Clases to Masses . After  urlLink Isaac Mizrahi's strong showing  at his Target fashion Show, Karl Lagerfeld took to heart the mantra:  urlLink "classes to the masses":   "One of the most venerable names in haute couture will embrace bargain shoppers when  Chanel  and  Fendi  designer  Karl Lagerfeld  launches a new line for H&M, the mecca of disposable chic.  "'Karl Lagerfeld has been with the classes, now he's going to the masses,' said retail consultant  Howard Davidowitz .   Out :  Man-slapping  by any other name is not as sweet. Apparently  urlLink Regis Philbin took the back of his hand  to NY Daily News gossip columnist  Ben Widdicombe , a vicious man-slapping if I ever heard one:  "Regis and Joy Philbin were at  Sirio Maccioni's  Le Cirque 2000 this week to help him launch his memoirs. I asked Regis what he'd learned from the restaurateur. 'He taught me how to enjoy food!' Reege barked, before slapping me in the face (in an affectionate way, but still, it was kinda weird)."  Not since  urlLink NY Times boldfacer Joyce Wadler took took an elbow to the breadbasket  has there been such an outrage. One of my bretheren in the scoop is taking a bitchslapping ( The Corsair  sprints regally with a purposeful look in his eye to the scene of the crime). Man down!  Man down!    In :  urlLink Madison and Vine . Must advertising and editorial in the media combine in roder to survive?  urlLink The Page Sixers report :  "MEDIA bigs  urlLink Tom Freston ,  Lenny Lauren ,  urlLink David Granger ,  urlLink Joe Perello ,  urlLink Steven Rubenstein ,  urlLink Charlie Walk  and  urlLink George Wayne  were among the guests at a party at  Vela  hosted by  Jason Binn  to toast Advertising Age editor  urlLink Scott Donaton  for his " urlLink Madison & Vine : Why the Entertainment and Advertising Industries Must Converge to Survive."

Out :  urlLink Krumping . In  urlLink tommorrow's New York Times Arts and Leisure section , Valerie Gladstone and Madonna's choreographer Jamie King chat urbanely about the urban dance phenomenon that has, by virtue of this very discussion, jumped the shark:  " Valerie Gladstone : What's  urlLink the krump ?    Jamie King : Madonna likes me to bring her the newest thing. The krump is very in-your-face, very angry and confrontational, with the arms spread wide in a threatening manner. My dancers told me about it. It looks like you're fighting. It's a way for kids in tough neighborhoods to express their aggression, without really fighting. That's what she and I like about it."    In :  urlLink The new expose of the Bush Administration  (how many are there?).

Imperial Hubris: Why the West is Losing the War on Terror, due out next month, dismisses two of the most frequent boasts of the Bush administration: that Bin Laden and al-Qaida are "on the run" and that the Iraq invasion has made America safer.   "In an interview with the Guardian the official, who writes as 'Anonymous', described al-Qaida as a much more proficient and focused organisation than it was in 2001, and predicted that it would "inevitably" acquire weapons of mass destruction and try to use them.   "He said Bin Laden was probably 'comfortable' commanding his organisation from the mountainous tribal lands along the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan."    Fuck.    Out :This juicy little blind item from the  urlLink LA.com blog  (via Popbitch):  "Blind items are the new black! Sandwiched among salacious gossip about Brits we've never heard of, Popbitch proffered this great blind item:  "Which TV and film actor didn't stay lonely when his actress wife went off to New York to film? The actor wiled away most of his time at the local Starbucks in Malibu and when the coffee shop wasn't open, took the 18 year-old waitress back to his place for "coffee".  "The headline was 'The Truth is Out There,' a hint so obvious that even those crybabies who complain in the comments section about perplexing LA.COMfidentail blind items will figure it out. Here's another hint: if this is the guy we're thinking of, he was a well known lothario before tying the knot."  That's so easy, I'm not even going to Duchovny it with an answer ... oops!  My bad.    In : Is Drew Barrymore getting married to Fabrizio Moretti of The Strokes'? That's what that significant cultural artifact  urlLink Star Magazine says :  "It was an emotional roller coaster for Drew Barrymore last week. First, the two-time "Angel" visited her ailing father, John Drew Barrymore, 50, at a Santa Monica Alzheimer's care center on Monday, June 7. It must have been a painful visit, because she left in tears. Thankfully her boyfriend of two years,  Fabrizio Moretti , of the hot band The Strokes, was at her side.  "The tears soon turned to tears of joy when the lovebirds were spotted gushing over engagement rings at Cartier jewelers on Rodeo Drive in L.A. just two days later. On June 10, the newly-svelte Barrymore, 29, and Moretti, 24, were seen holding hands and being very touchy-feely in the store."   Hmmm.   And, finally,  also In :  urlLink Congratulations to Defamer.com  for their first scoop, a doozy:  "We hear from a well-placed operative within MGM that Sony's rumored $5 billion purchase of the movie studio is a done deal. The news should be announced early next week. In the meantime, we can get back to our favorite pasttime: watching media conglomerates swallow up pieces of Hollywood in pursuit of the ever-elusive 'shitergy.'"  Way to go, guys.

       Magazine Editors: Hot or Not    urlLink Mediabistro's  magazine editor hot or not contest is over, and some interesting observations came out of the 8,000 or so insider votes:  "Some voters did get the point. '(Cargo's Ariel Foxman) is younger and hotter than  urlLink Jann (Wenner),  but Jann could do much more for a rising editor's career,' wrote a respondent in the gay-man category, with exactly the sort of opportunism we were seeking. 'None of the guys appeal to me, but  urlLink Graydon Carter  could advance my career the most,' wrote a similarly strategic thinker, this time in the straight-man field. 'Maybe I could get my screenplay produced,' snarked another Carter voter."   The Corsair  crumples a c-note and throws it on the dresser of Mediabistro.com.   urlLink Gawker comments :  "Evidently Harper's in-house email from the PR office for local crazy-man Lewis Lapham was unsuccessful (don't lie, kids, we saw the email), as Men's Health's  urlLink David Zinczenko  pounded Lewis and the other straight men."   Finally:  "All that out of the way, congratulations to the four winners of mediabistro.com's first Magazine Editor Hot-or-Not competitions: Spin's  urlLink Sia Michel , who won a majority of votes in the woman category; Men's Health's  Dave Zinczenko , whose pretty-boy rep was well underlined by his trouncing of his straight-man competitors; Rolling Stone's  Jann Wenner , who at press time held a slim, 20-odd-vote lead over Cargo's  Ariel Foxman  (big surprise: the most action was among the gay men); and, finally, Playboy's  Hugh Hefner , who won the legends race but—somewhat surprisingly, given his rep—wasn't too far ahead of Vogue's  urlLink Diana Vreeland , who's been dead for 15 years."

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  urlLink The Howard Stern-Page Six-Lloyd Grove Imbroglio .    In :  urlLink Allegra Beck .  urlLink This from the New York Times :  "At the end of this month, on her 18th birthday,  urlLink Allegra Beck  will come into control of her 50 percent of the privately held Versace firm; her mother owns 20 percent and Santo, 30 percent. The family's holdings include the fashion business, which had sales last year of $486 million, as well as a villa on Lake Como and a town house in New York. The family has sold the Miami Beach house.   "Though her name is as prominent as a Hilton, Ms. Beck isn't a typical heiress. This is in part because of what she has endured and in part because her father, Paul Beck, and her mother, who are separated, have shielded her from the news media. She attends a private school in Milan and is often present at her mother's runway shows. But, while Ms. Beck will soon be free to exert control over one of the most famous labels in fashion, she plans to enroll this fall in an American university to study drama and business."   The Corsair  would like to take this opportunity to formally extend to Allegra Beck a  full scholarship  to the  Ron Mwangaguhunga School of Drama and Business , registration guaranteed upon turning 18.  Call me ?  For those of you who yahood in for "Allegra Beck", check out my latest blog posts  urlLink here .   Out :  Paul McCartney , birthday boy.  urlLink According to Jeanette Walls :  "Crew members on the set of the singer’s concert are up in arms because the staunch vegetarian has banned the eating of meat by anyone working on the tour.   "'It’s completely crazy,' one worker in Oslo, Norway, where the former Beatle is performing tonight, told the paper Aftenposten, according to our translator."  I suppose he won't be hanging with  urlLink carnivores Jay Z and Beyonce  anytime soon?   Out :  Johnny Depp's panties . (2nd story down)  urlLink According to Liz Smith ,  David Beckham  apparently snagged them:  "So here's the latest Beckham rumor. He wants to channel Johnny Depp. He thinks the actor is just terrific. When Johnny's underpants sold for more than $3,000 at a recent charity auction in London, it is said that Beckham was the purchaser. A 'close celebrity pal' of David and Victoria Beckham insists, 'He's had the underwear framed, and hanging in their bedroom.'"  Can I even muster the amount of snark that this little chestnut deserves? No. Upon consideration it appears that I can't. Since brevity is the soul of wit, I'll just move right along to the next item.   In :  urlLink Oprah Winfrey . I've been hard on the Ope in the past, but making Anna Karenina a part of her book club is a noble idea. For just a moment, at least, people who would be fearful to approach Great Works -- okay, Middle aged housewives -- will be exposed to Tolstoy.  urlLink Way to go, Ope .   Out : New York is, at least for Steve Garbarino who is headed to LA, according to  urlLink the scoopsters at Fashionweekdaily :  "Vanity Fair contributing editor  Steve Garbarino  is leaving Manhattan and moving to L.A. to work on his HBO pilot 'Freak Beat,' which is on track to fill the void left by 'Sex and the City,' we hear. The show is loosely based on Garbarino’s own life covering off-beat subjects like the Hell’s Angels and oddball 'Heaven’s Gate' director  Michael Cimino  for VF. At least until the channel gives the green light for the full series, Garbarino will continue to write for VF and The New York Times Magazine. Meanwhile his name has been floated as a possible candidate for the editorial director’s job at Playboy."   In :  urlLink Director Noel Baumbach . I saw Kicking and Screaming last night and loved it all over again. I'd love to shake  Noah Baumbach's  hand. Anyone know when his next movies out? I'm so there.

       Christina Applegate Interview    Playboy , July 2004 (The one with  urlLink La Femme Nikita Nekkid )   Playboy : How competitive was the child acting world back in the 1980s?   Christina Applegate : Unbelieveably. Everything was kid-dominated. It was the era of  urlLink Silver Spoons ,  urlLink Family Ties ,  urlLink Charles in Charge . Every girl my age had long, blonde hair, and we'd curl it for our auditions. It was really important to get on a show, get on a show, get on a show. I used to pray, 'Oh God, I just want to be on a sitcom. I really, really do.'   Playboy : Describe the financial security that comes from starring on a popular sitcom for 11 seasons?   Applegate : Not so secure, honestly. Fox didn't give us residuals. When it came time to negotiate for syndication pay,  urlLink Fox claimed it really wasn't a network . So we didn't get what we would have if we were on Family Ties or one of those other shows. Those people can live off their residuals the rest of their lives. I think about it every once in a while and get a little pissed off, but we were stupid to accept it.  urlLink Married with Children  is showing five times a day on three different networks in almost every country in the world, and the checks I get are hysterical, literally for 75 cents.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  urlLink Naomi Campbell's left breast , which, as it happens, just  urlLink slipped out  of her Rosa Cha swimsuit top (Ka- Pow !) the other day.  That doesn't make her a bad person .  The Corsair  says: God bless her mocha colored dirty pillows. Here's how  urlLink The Sun  described the saucy milk chocolatey confection:  "FOR someone who claims her privacy is important to her, Naomi Campbell has a funny way of showing it.  "The supermodel wore a teeny-weeny bikini at a fashion show in Brazil — so it was no surprise when her left boob popped out."  Now, if only she was  urlLink carrying a pint of lager . For Naomi, a  stout bock , which, on occasion, by the by, the ladies have said  of me  (Ka-Pow!).   Out :  urlLink Jean Paul Gaultier . I'll let Reuters tell it like it is:  "Slices of fresh bread overlap to form the cascading train of an evening gown. Baguettes sprout like a skirt from a wicker basket in the shape of a corset, where two brioches perch like women's breasts.   "The mouth-watering creations are just two of the outfits in the exhibition 'Pain Couture by Jean-Paul Gaultier,' in which the irreverent French designer has conjured a surrealist wardrobe made entirely from bread."   Now , we all know the old canard that "artists" who can't do shock, (cough, cough,  urlLink Madonna  cough, cough) but what is it about the French and these  urlLink silly experiments ?  Can someone tell me why the French aesthetic tastes have to be so goddmaned wierd? ( Ed. Note :  urlLink This Grappa wine hangover  has made me strangely conservative, quite  curmudgeonly  even, this afternoon, so if you like your Corsair more liberal,  urlLink check me out here . Do not go any further. Danger, Will Robinson.I am in the throes of a  urlLink fierce Grappa hangover ) If someone tried this stunt in America, they would either get short shrift on the Food Network, or be dashed off to an underfunded institution for the mentally deranged. Croissant corsets, my word! ( The Corsair  affects the tone of Victorian gentleman) Damned cheek, this Gaultier fellow, a rummy pom, whot! And yet, in France, this is considered charming,  witty even :  "Through trial and error, the team succeeded in producing technical marvels such as a solid bread kilt and a swinging short dress consisting of rows of wafer-thin biscuits."   What-the-fuck?!    In :  urlLink Monica Meadows , the model who got shot in the NYC subway a few weeks ago.  urlLink According to the Enquirer , because enquiring minds want to know:  "The aspiring actress -- whose biggest claim to fame was a bit part on TV's 'Law & Order: Criminal Intent' -- is now solidly on the celebrity fast track after being shot and wounded on a crowded  urlLink NYC subway .  "... in the three days following the June 1 shooting, 23-year-old Monica received more offers to appear in the theater and on TV than in the entire 18 months since leaving Colorado to audition as just another unknown wanna-be in the Big Apple!  "'It's been overwhelming,' said the 5-foot-10 brunette beauty, showing off the gauze dressing covering the hole from the small-caliber bullet that tore through her left upper chest."   Out : There is something rather subservient and "daddy worshipping" about this particular brand of paleoconservatism (TM) that  urlLink Pat Buchanan  and  urlLink Peggy Noonan  whore out,  especially Noonan . Check out  urlLink her piece on Reagan's funeral  (link via  urlLink Wonkette ):  "The sun was strong, like a presence. It bathed the women in glow. One was standing straight, with discipline. Her beige bouffant was brilliant in the sun. I approached, and she turned. It was  urlLink Margaret Thatcher . It was like walking into a room at FDR's funeral and seeing Churchill.   "The cortege was coming toward the steps. We looked out the window: a perfect tableaux of ceremonial excellence from every branch of the armed forces. Mrs. Thatcher watched. She turned and said to me, 'This is the thing, you see, you must stay militarily strong, with an undeniable strength. The importance of this cannot be exaggerated.'   "To my son, whose 17th birthday was the next day, she said, 'And what do you study?' He tells her he loves history and literature. 'Mathematics,' she says. He nods, wondering, I think, if she had heard him correctly. She had. She was giving him advice. 'In the world of the future it will be mathematics that we need--the hard, specific knowledge of mathematical formulae, you see.' My son nodded: 'Yes, ma'am.' Later I squeezed his arm. 'Take notes,' I said. This is history."   This is bullshit , quite frankly: and I'll tell you why ( Ed. Note . I am hung over, so very hung over, so if you are not into "rant mode from blogger with headache" be well advised skip over to another entry,  urlLink like this ). Noonan's prose is suffused with so much Daddy worship, so much  urlLink nostalgia for the days of yore ,  urlLink the bare ruined choirs of the Catholic Church , that she sounds like bad  urlLink Waugh .At any goddamned moment one expects  urlLink Lord Sebastian Flyte  to crash the fucking procedings with his teddy bear  urlLink Aloysius  in tow and some top drawer Moroccan brandy.   I can respect the  urlLink conservative search for wisdom . I truly do. Liberals just cannot wrap their minds around the fact that public schools are a joke, and that if anyone learns from them, anything of value beyond "aqua cetiline welding" or "woodwork," it is probably by accident. Public schools exist to train the next generation of servants. And the teachers unions are out mostly for pay raises. And any political dialogue on the subject usually degenerates into chat of "repairing buildings" or putting "cops in schools."  Sweet . Liberals are allergic to any question of curriculum because they do not believe in any absolute truths, except, touchingly, a nebulous concept of "love."  urlLink Conservatives have strong curriculum proposals . But, of course, when this search for wisdom degenerates, disintegrates, you get  urlLink gasbags and moral scolds , who are more visible on the media landscape than the  urlLink virtuous conservative .  I also respect the liberal search for  urlLink sophistication . Visit the Upper West Side, the world capitol of liberalism and you can see -- especially in summer -- how beautiful it is to be liberal. There are ethnic restaurants everywhere (as opposed to the frosty Upper East Side, where ethnic diversity is limited to ethnic servants going in the service entrances), lots of kids, lots of dogs, and a sort of air of Buddhist detatchment and accepting vibe luxuriates in liberal towns, like, say Northampton, Massachusetts.  urlLink There is no ultimate truth , just surf reality with improvisation and love. And travel to strange and mysterious cultures and partake of their particular "realities".  Naive , yes, but pretty, and, of course,  urlLink sophisticated . Liberals are  urlLink far more sophisticated  than  urlLink conservatives .  In my life I try to take the good from both sides of the political spectrum and call each on on their bullshit ... when I'm not blogging about trite celebrity gossip, that is.  But Peggy Noonan represents a paleoconservatism that I do not respect.  All this talk of "Military supremacy," "hard specific knowledge," "mathematical formulae," "undeniable strength," "ceremonial excellence" and, of course, the favorite word of  urlLink Brylcreemed paleoconservatives , the all-purpose "history," as in -- "if history teaches us anything [insert inane and unlearned point in here concerning "power" and "force"]"

       An Analysis of Larry King's Trash   Should we be paying rapt attention to  urlLink Page Six's revelation  that Larry King wears absorbent undergarments?    urlLink Depends.   But,  Seriously , folks ( urlLink cocks eyebrows and flicks cigar ),  look at this man's trash : clearly, he drinks a wide range of beverages (like me, and yet, so not like me), dare we say it -- a superhuman amount: the coffee, the cardboard "juice boxes", the odd Perrier and Coke, all of these make the measure of the man. With all that liquid sloshing about his CN-iNnards, who wouldn't need, on occasion, just a little bit of  back me up . A little something-something to  make sure  excess spillage doesn't rear itself moistly down his corduroy's while he're throwing softballs at the latest "It"   urlLink octogenarian ( The Corsair  softly chuckles)  This all must be a strain for Larry King's  urlLink little sweetie, Shawn .

An insider tells The Daily that Min’s editorial contract included a bonus clause that could deliver her Hollywood style money for superb sales figures. '[The bonus] will certainly be enough to put her new baby through college,' the insider jokes."  And, to top things off,  urlLink Min had a baby  the same week.

       Blind Items    urlLink LA.com's blog  has this one:  "I was recently invited, through a friend, to one barely legal starlet’s party at the Hollywood Hills ranch rented for her by her current film's production office. As the party filled with handsome young stars, I went looking for the bathroom (too many margaritas!) and when I saw a long queue, I went to find another one. What I found instead was the movie star’s office/storage room, where there was a large framed photo of her ex-boyfriend and his new brunette girlfriend having sex on Malibu’s El Matador Beach. The photo looked like it was taken paparazzi-style, from behind one of the beach’s giant rock formations in the sand, but it was blown up and expertly framed. When I asked one of the starlet’s stylists if she knew anything about the porn photo, she said that the actress 'likes to watch' and that she gets really turned on by thinking about her current boy getting it on with other women (and boys) in front of her. In this case, it appears that the actress shot the photo herself, post-breakup."  I have no idea.  Keira Knightley  and her ex-Jamie Dornan? Any other guesses?    urlLink Page Six  has:  "WHICH basketball legend didn't limit his activities to golf on a recent trip to Myrtle Beach, S.C.? He spent some quality time with a pretty little Asian girl who works for a timeshare resort."  Well, I'm guessing either Michael Jordan or  urlLink Charles Oakley  as both was there at the end of May (the Memorial Day weekend), playing holes at Barefoot's Dye Club and the Norman and Love courses. Playing holes and playing ho's.   urlLink Jordan  is legendary at that.

       Mr. Belvedere Sat on His Balls   "One of my favorite (Adam) Sandler stories was the one he told us about the time that  urlLink Mr. Belvedere  sat on his own balls.  "Adam had a small part on the show  urlLink Mr. Belvedere  early in his career. On his first day, everyone was sitting at a huge table waiting to start the reading of that week's show. The old guy who played Mr. Belvedere hadn't shown up yet, so everyone was drinking coffee and talking until he arrived. Finally, Mr. Belvedere walked in ... in a sweatsuit and a matching monogrammed attache case. When the old guy took his seat he sang out 'Good morning everybody!' ... As he took a load off, he apparently sat on one of his own testicles. With his nut scrunched under his leg he screamed, 'Oooohhhhh!' and had to be carried out on a stretcher."    urlLink Jay Mohr, Grasping for Airtime    The Corsair  highly recommends this book for comedy writers.

       A Little of The Old In and Out    In : An ethics code for  Vanity Fair . Oh, so very in. According to  urlLink Medialifemagazine :  "A month after the  urlLink Los Angeles Times and New York Times  reported that Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter received a $100,000 finder’s fee for encouraging producers to read 'A Beautiful Mind'—which they then turned into an Academy Award-winning film—publisher Condé Nast has implemented a  urlLink code of conduct . The 16-page code, entitled 'What Governs Us,' reads, 'The integrity of Condé Nast and its employees depends greatly on avoiding conflicts of interest or appearances of such in editorial and business conduct.' Condé Nast hasn’t publicly reprimanded Carter, but the launch of this new code, so soon after the controversy, gives the impression of doing so. But according to the Los Angeles Times, Carter is still pursuing ethically nebulous deals. The newspaper says he's been negotiating with frequent Vanity Fair advertiser American Express Co. to fund a documentary on the life of his writer friend  urlLink Fran Lebowitz ."  An ethics code, what a  capital  idea. May I suggest one? Letting years go by  urlLink without placing an African-American on the cover  -- because we all know the entertainment industry, sports, film,  those sort of fields  (averted gaze), lack people of color (small closing cough of feigned detachment) --  is not ethical .   Out :  urlLink An infestation of the B-Listers . They are  urlLink everywhere . Prancing up and down the red carpet, doing wacky things, flashing the camera, trying to offset the fundamental fact that they have no talent. Mostly, this class of people ( The Corsair  puts on his ethnobiologist hat) -- are famous for video-taped sex and other inappropriate hijinx and  shenanegans .   What is it about the heat that brings out  urlLink the B's ? ( The Corsair  gets philosophical as he strolls across the digital landscape) Is it all the pollen in the air? B-List parties and B-List boldface names are the new black. Who would you rather read about:  Nicole Ritchie  or  urlLink Tom Hanks ? Uh huh ...  me too , baby pop.   In :  urlLink This picture of Kate Moss , walking down the street with a pint of lager is driving me crazy. The sheerness of that dress is outrageous. Can she not fathom her incredible hotness and the disturbing effect it has on bloggers like me? And that frosty lager -- an  adult  beverage, to be sure. ( The Corsair  moistens his lips) Teasing with thy frosty head. Flaxen-hued yummy drink. ( The Corsair  gives "humid" looks to the lager) Honestly: I don't know if it's the lager or the revealing character of the dress that turns me on more, driving me to distraction.   Okay , so the lager turns me on more, but  that doesn't make me a bad person , just: alco-sexual. A lifestyle choice,  to be sure .   Out : It aint easy being  Pink . Check out this  urlLink "rainbow connection."  Is it just me that finds this  amusee ? Okay. Just me.  Whatever  (Averted Gaze).    In :  Is Jennifer Aniston knocked up ?! Okay (quieter), that was  urlLink louche  of me. Unpardonable. What I meant to say is: Is Mrs. Pitt in "a family way"? There, you see, more bourgois,  presto . I can be "corporate." I can sell my soul for the right amount of cash and a Lincoln Town Car and an expense account ... call me Saturday Night Live writing staff ...  call-me ?   Anyhoo :  urlLink The Sun puts the latest celebrity impregantion more delicately than I :  "IT’S the biggest game of 'Is she or isn’t she?' in town.   "Just days after her FRIENDS co-star COURTENEY COX gave birth, rumours are rife that JENNIFER ANISTON is now pregnant.   "After months of saying she is ready to start a family, Jennifer is believed to be expecting her first child with the divine BRAD PITT.   "A source revealed: 'This is something both Brad and Jennifer want. Expect an announcement later this month.'   "Jennifer’s spokesman said: 'I keep hearing that rumour' — but has so far refused to confirm or deny it."   All these celebrities humping . It's got to be the heat.    Out :  Tucker Carlson ,  urlLink bragging about his tv show , on PBS at -- snicker, get this -- 10 :30 pm on a Friday Night :  "... Carlson, whose talk show,  urlLink 'Tucker Carlson: Unfiltered'  premieres Friday night (WNET/13 at 10:30 p.m.) and is suddenly - unwittingly, to hear Carlson - in the vanguard of new right-wing talk shows about to invade - er, enter - PBS' rarified realm.  "'Let me say right off the bat,' says Carlson, right off the bat, 'that I know so little about the back story' of why 'Unfiltered' has arrived at PBS. 'I'm doubtless certain there is one, but it's never been explained to me [and] I'm still confused by how the whole works - the stations, PBS, the Congress. The whole thing is all confusing to me.'"   We so won't be there for you , Tucker: So.  Not . There.   In : According to  urlLink Indiewire ,  Napoleon Dynamite :  "Fox Searchlight's  urlLink 'Napoleon Dynamite'   proved its box office bang, opening in limited runs in the U.S. and topping the iW BOT as ranked by screen average. The film unseated 'Control Room,' which dominated the chart for three weeks."   Out : Trophy wife and airhead  Stephanie Seymour  will "keep it in the family," (wink, wink) according to  urlLink Fashionweekdaily :  "At last night’s grand opening of the new Bumble & Bumble salon,  Stephanie Seymour  revealed to The Daily that she will be a contributing jewelry editor for Interview magazine. The 35-year-old former supermodel is married to Brant Publications, Inc. chairman Peter Brant, whose company owns the 35-year-old magazine, which is known for its candid conversations between pop icons of today and tomorrow. Seymour will be working on two upcoming jewelry spreads for the September issue. She was inspired by her feature story in Vogue’s January 2004 issue, where she played fashion editor with Vogue European editor at large Hamish Bowles as he reviewed the spring 2004 collections in New York. 'I’m so thrilled to be doing this,' Seymour gushed. 'Fashion’s great, but I’ve always loved jewelry.'"  Which might explain what she found attractive about that bloated hilbilly  Axl Rose  --  urlLink because of all the the shiners he gave her .   Ka-Pow!   Not PC, to be sure, but  fu-nee , if you go in for that sort of thing.   Out : Minnie Driver, folk singer.  urlLink According to The Cincinatti Enquirer :  "Rounder Records has signed Oscar-nominated actress  Minnie Driver  to a recording contract.   "Her album, Everything I've Got in My Pocket, will be released on the label's rock/pop imprint, Zoe Records, in September, the Cambridge, Mass.-based company said this week.   "She will be backed by a group that includes members of the Wallflowers and Pete Yorn's band. The album is described as 'sparse, atmospheric pop and a hint of contemporary folk.'"   urlLink I'm so not going to have this CD in my pocket , I can tell you that. Good Will Singing, my ass.

       Blind Item    urlLink LA.com's blog  has this intriguing blind item:  "The Self-Destructive Stud   "Depending on how hip your household is, he may or may not be a household name. But this moviemaking wild child is credited with some very high-profile movies, some of them memorably good, some memorably bad. With a simple cell phone call, he can land a meeting with practically any big noise in town. He can even land a girlfriend now and then, although he much prefers ordering out exotic dishes from escort services (and not exclusively from the high-dollar agencies either, if you catch Dolly’s way-way-south-of-Western-Avenue drift). The real lowdown on this guy is that he is majorly addicted to self-destructive and risky behavior, whether it’s rough and raunchy sex, driving one of his zillion dollar sports cars like a bat out of hell while soaring on various illegal substances, or cutting and burning himself deliberately in all sorts of tender places. No wonder he tends to wear long sleeves to all those high powered meetings, no matter how scorching the temperature."   urlLink Any guesses ?

       Campaign 2004 Round Up    Senator John Kerry , who has  urlLink raised over $100 million  in three months, may be spending too much time  urlLink in search of Mammon . Wearing his energies thin. Keeping his eye off the prize.   I can understand, however, the almost fanatic desire for the Democrats to pimp out their asses for scrilla, as  Al Gore , when the sitting Vice President,  urlLink ran out  in the last days of campaign 2000,  ran out of paper . Even Vice Presidents can fall flat when faced with an opponent who pimps out hard for the corporate cheddar. But the search for the almighty dollar is actually hurting the sharpness of Kerry's campaign. Bush has the bully pulpit, he doesn't need to chase the corporate dollar --  they come to him . All he needs to do is lead -- give America a sense of security in this dangerous age.   Granted , sharpness is not something that comes to mind when discussing the Kerry campaign's unfocused, lackluster trajectory of late. He won Iowa because he seemed stable, safe,  a good provider  with  urlLink an impressive head of hair . And after Iowa, New Hampshire followed, and, after that the deluge. My own candidate,  John Edwards  never had a chance. Note to Kerry: you need to light a fire under your ass: you only get one shot at this.  The polarization of the House continues apace on the campaign landscape. Every day another hallowed tradition of bipartisan cooperation is raped, lost forever, making us a meaner nation. Today, the  urlLink New York Times notes , "(a) seven-year-old unofficial truce discouraging House members from filing ethics complaints against one another disintegrated Tuesday when a freshman Democrat accused one of the most powerful members of Congress, the House majority leader, Tom DeLay, of 'bribery, extortion, fraud, money laundering and the abuse of power.'"   The Corsair  picks up a glass of  urlLink 20 year old champagne  with flavors of roasted nuts and caramel, sips, silently pronounces it good, and then continues from The Times:  "The Democrat,  urlLink Representative Chris Bell  of Texas, who is leaving Congress because he lost a primary election, filed a 187-page complaint against Mr. DeLay, also of Texas, with the House ethics committee. The complaint accuses the majority leader of illegally soliciting campaign contributions, laundering campaign contributions to influence state legislative races and improperly using his office to influence federal agencies."   Of course , Bell lost the election because of DeLay's hardball redistricting of Texas, so personal bitterness plays a major role here  beyond  the intense polarization of both houses of Congress.  urlLink The Hill notes  that the partisan fighting is now intramural, with conservative Republicans fighting against the Centrists:  "More than 20 House conservatives met recently at the Hunan Dynasty on Capitol Hill to discuss how to put some conservative backbone into the Senate, among other political and legislative priorities. Many of them believe that Republican centrists in the Senate are as much to blame as Democrats for their policy frustrations."  So, if there is any summing up of the campign season it has to be the word:  chaos . Pandemonium on the world stage and internally in our own affairs.  urlLink How prescient Daniel Patrick Moynihan was , in retrospect. Ambivalence among Democrats for their guy, their "good provider," (why does this seem more and more like a bad marriage, Midwest --er, Iowa-style) with the desire to fire the current Administration capturing more passion than the presumptive leader. And, among members of the House, the erosion of tradition and courtesy, hallmarks of the conservative worldview. And within the Republicans, a struggle between the right and center, and, to a lesser degree, but significantly, within the Democratic Party, the struggle between the Naderites -- who are getting quite the boost from Kerry's Gorean lack of charisma and crisp sharpness of message -- against the Bush-Must-Go-At-All-Costs Air America wing of the party.  Pandaemonium is right, Mr. Moynihan.

       Wonkette on On The Media   Ana Marie Cox appeared on  urlLink NPR's On The Media , and hit one out into the rafters:  " Bob Garfield : Now, I think what put Wonkette on the map was its link to  urlLink Jessica Cutler's weblog . Would you just please tell me about this episode and  urlLink how you discovered her , and then  urlLink what happened next .   "ANA MARIE COX: Someone just sent me a link to her blog, which was called  urlLink The Washingtonienne . It only had been a going concern for about a month maybe, maybe three weeks. And it was a very brightly written diary of her sex life -- her very graphic and somewhat risky sex life.   "BOB GARFIELD: And occasionally remunerative--   "ANA MARIE COX: Yes, occasionally -- after all this happened, she was always very careful to say, like it's not like people paid her for sex, but they were having sex and they were giving her money. Maybe it was just a coincidence. [LAUGHTER]"

       A Little of the Old In and Out   I actually made my work deadlines a little early -- a first, so -- as the deeply misunderstood  urlLink Alex from A Clockwork Orange might say , hows about "a little of the old In and Out"?   In : I love the smell of a rapper gone buck wild; it smells of ...  shenanegans . According to  urlLink Page Six , 50 Cent showed that he's like school on Saturday ... (altogether now, dear readers) ...  no class :  "... 50 spotted former friend  Bang 'Em Smurf , who was seated in the front row, and threw a wad of cash in his face in response to Smurf's claim that 50 owes him $150,000. Police in riot gear broke up the resulting scrum between 50 Cent's posse, G-Unit and Smurf's crew."  Aw, Fitty,  urlLink smurf's  are only three apple's high.  urlLink That's not right .   Out :  urlLink Tootsie Heinz Kerry . As her son,  Chris Heinz , the most eligible bachelor in America, plays hide the katsup with  urlLink Helen of "Troy"  ( urlLink note to ladies : "Chris Heinz is hosting a fashion friendly fund-raiser for his stepdad John Kerry July 12 on the Hotel Gansevoort's rooftop"), his mother, Theresa, is taking some hits. Par for the course, I suppose.   In : More rappers and their shenanegans, we can't get enough. We'll file this one under:  DMX and the Case of the High End Urban Doggiewear . Rapper DMX is in the dog house over a breach of contract with -- get this -- a (makes quotation marks with his fingers into thin air) "high end urban dog wear company."  ( The Corsair  chuckles softly)   urlLink According to the Miami Herald : " Michael Rovell , lawyer for  Amusing Diversions , said the company signed DMX last June and paid him $15,000 to help sell leather jackets, bubble jackets with fur trim, sports jerseys and other high-end 'urban' dog wear."  DMX got the gig because he had recorded some well known "doggie awareness" spots. Little did the folks at Amusing Diversions know that DMX had made the spots not out of the kindness and compassion of his heart -- nooo:  "DMX pleaded guilty to ... cruelty charges in 2002 after officials found 14 pit bulls living in filthy conditions at his New Jersey home. He was fined and ordered to do the ads."  Let me guess:  urlLink the 15 large has already been spent ?   Out : The Waterboy:  Adam Sandler  Wipes Out. Water boy Adam Sandler, according to that significant cultural artifact the  urlLink National Enquirer , "was the one in stitches after a surfing accident in Hawaii sent him to the hospital with his head split open."   Ouch!   "'Adam had a major wipeout on the first big wave he tried to catch, smashing his head on his board,' said a friend. Sandler had been working on his latest film, Spanglish, for the last four months when he decided to fly off to Hawaii for a vacation.  "'You could hear the thud when the board connected with his skull. His head cracked open and blood spurted into the water.  Luckily for all involved that said skull was filled with only hot air.  Kidding!     urlLink Anyhoo : Fifteen gnarly stitches later, Sandler was up and out of the hospital, but couldn't go in the water for the rest of the trip.  Totally  urlLink Barney .   In : And speaking of pickleheads, Keanu Reeves is a bit of a hero today. According to that significant cultural artifact the  urlLink National Enquirer , Keanu Reeves was in a drive by, but kept a level head:  "Whoa! Gunfire ripped through a neighborhood grocery in the early morning hours, shattering windows as people screamed -- and shopper Keanu Reeves reacted like it was a live-ammo version of 'The Matrix'! The action star hit the deck, yelling at panicked customers: 'GET DOWN!' Everyone stayed plastered to the floor . . . and the gunshots finally subsided."  Why didn't he take  urlLink the blue pill ?   Out :  Tom Delay , according to  urlLink TheHill.com :  "Retiring Rep. Chris Bell (D-Texas) is planning to file an ethics complaint today against House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Texas), who spearheaded a redrawing of the Texas congressional map that cost the first-term lawmaker his seat.   "The complaint is only the third filed against a House lawmaker since party leaders rewrote the chamber’s rules in 1997 to prohibit outside groups from filing complaints with the ethics panel, known formally as the House Standards of Official Conduct Committee.   "The new complaint follows a month of concerted activity by a self-described ethics coalition, a network of mostly left-leaning good-government groups that has tried to spur lawmakers to pursue more vigorously allegations of wrongdoing by their colleagues."    And, always in :  urlLink Michael Musto , who is the Gothamist interview today.  "Gothamist: Do you feel television gives us the most out of Musto?   "(Metro TV), actually, gave me a really good venue, whenever I could get a word in. The Gossip Show on E! was also a great forum because we got to write our own items and perform them with some flair. But when you do talking head appearances for cable shows, they're generally cut-and-paste jobs that only give a choppy hint at what you can do. (But they're still fun to do.) Live TV gives you a much better chance to shine. The immediacy of it is potentially terrifying, but it also forces you to walk the high wire and sometimes sparkle. My favorite live show to be on these days is Countdown with Keith Olbermann on MSNBC because he has a great, knowing tone and gives you a whole segment on which to deliver your own goods, rather than have to scream against some family values council member for two seconds. I don't even care if anyone watches."  But you must read today's interview with the ultrahot Executive Producing team of  urlLink Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato , who, among other things, did Trio's excellent  urlLink Flops 101: Lessons From the Biz  (and having  urlLink Illeana Douglas  narrate a documentary on failure added just the right dash of irony).  Be sure to check out  urlLink my new gig . We'll see how it goes.

       Jimmy Fallon Sighting    urlLink The La.com blog  chronicles an odd Jimmy Fallon sighting:  "Jimmy Jonesing  "The other day, Jimmy Fallon strolled into Elixir, the teahouse on Melrose, with a friend. He was talking about how cool it was to be on vacation in LA. Then he approached just about everyone in the near-empty place, servers and customers alike, and asked where the nearest  urlLink Sav-On  was to his hotel, the Chateau Marmont. And asked, and asked, and asked, over and over. What in the world did he need so badly?"   Just a guess : As Fallon was a writer for Saturday Night Live, and, according to  urlLink Jay Mohr's fascinating study  on the culture there, most writers on the show are on anti-panic attack medication, I would say Jimmy Fallon was needing his  urlLink Klonopin  prescription filled right about then. Poor kid. But that's just a guess, in case any attorney's feel slap happy.  Just an educated guess from an acute mind.

       What's Happening to Choire Sicha's Squirrel?   We heart Choire Sicha but something strange is happening to  urlLink Choire Sicha's squirrel . It is being X-ed out of existence and is vanishing at the same time. The squirrel has long been an object of fascination  urlLink in the blogosphere .  What does it signify? Is it an ancient work of art  urlLink from a gallery ? Does it's secret origins lie in a  urlLink lost civilization ? What is it?  I quote Choire from his  urlLink very own website :  "On June 1, 2004, the squirrel that for quite some time marked this website began to die. It's nearly invisible now, as you can see, all white and see-through. Fairly soon, I will no longer be the squirrel at all. Goodbye, sad kingdom of squirreldom. Too bad, but change is on me.  "Not sure what animal I'll be next, but we'll all certainly see as soon as I find out."  And, we cannot fail to mention the striking similarities -- we are not implying anything here, mind you -- with  urlLink Red Dragon antagonist and serial killer Francis Dollarhyde :  "I am the Dragon. / And you call me insane. / You are privy to a great becoming, but you recognize nothing. / You are an ant in the afterbirth. / It is your nature to do one thing correctly. / Before me, you rightly tremble. / But, fear is not what you owe me. / You owe me awe."   The Corsair  trembles  You do the math.   And be afraid ...  be very afraid .

          Bush USDA: French Fries Are Now A Vegetable    urlLink According to the Bush Administration's Agriculture Department , batter dipped French Fries now count as a fresh vegetable.    urlLink According to the AP :  "'It's unfathomable to me that, when Congress passed this law in 1930 and used the term fresh vegetable, they ever could have conceived that large food-processing companies could have convinced USDA that a frozen battered french fry fell into that definition,' (Fleming) Elliott said.   "Although Fleming Companies sold the fries to supermarkets, most are eaten in fast food restaurants, Elliott said. The coating makes the fry crunchy and adds flavor, he said."

       Kimora Simmons: "I Am A Fly Bitch"    urlLink New York Magazine's Linda Evangelista look alike, the magnificent, Swan-like Phoebe Eaton  does a great and, most importantly,  even-handed  job on the mess that is  urlLink Russell and Kimora Lee Simmons . And there is so much  The Corsair  would like to get into about this article ( The Corsair  bows his head solemnly), so  so  much, but this chestnut  particularly  strikes our fancy:  "The gossip columnists sunk their canines into  urlLink the incident  ( Ed Note : podiatrist-to-the-stars  urlLink Dr. Suzanne Levine  and  Kimora   got into a frisson over a silent auction for naming rights to a  Manolo Blahnik  shoe). That scarlet Kabbalah string on Kimora’s wrist, the one 'blessed by  urlLink the matriarch Rachel  —she’s long dead, like in a tomb somewhere,' had again failed to protect her."   Averted gaze , followed by a small closing cough of feigned detachment:   "'You  urlLink gotta get tough ,' Russell told his wife. She had gone to such trouble—for him!—to measure up as an urban fashion icon, a woman who, in her own words, could 'inspire young women to aspire.' But to the  urlLink New York tabloids , Kimora Lee Simmons is an  urlLink irresistible pincushion ."  If you go in for that sort of thing, which, in point of fact,  urlLink I do . I truly-deeply-madly- do .  "'Why is everyone worrying about what she spends?' says Russell. 'They should be worried about what  Roberto Cavalli  spends, too. What  Ralph Lauren  spends, too. How many cars does  Tommy Hilfiger  have, by the way?'"  "'If you are successful, people want to see it,' says  urlLink (Andre Leon) Talley . 'They want to share in the dream.' Especially people of struggle, as Russell Simmons tactfully calls them. It’s one reason rap lyrics sometimes read like shopping lists."    The Corsair  particularly cringes at the clumsy use of the phrase (makes quotation marks with his fingers out of thin air) "people of struggle."  "Long ago, Kimora Lee realized that if she couldn’t be the most popular girl in school, it might be fun to be the girl everybody talks about. 'Be happy if people are talking about you,' her father used to say. Only now she’s not so sure. The self-styled World’s Biggest Collector of Louis Vuitton is trying not to brag these days, but it’s hard: There’s just so much to show off. 'I am a fly bitch!' the 29-year-old says, sounding slightly exasperated."  And exasperated doesn't begin to express what I feel after reading this great story.  urlLink This  will be the most talked about article of the week.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  Margaret Cho . The  urlLink High Class Cho fashion designer  and  urlLink comedienne spoke to Time Magazine this week about having her mike cut off at an event recently, "They were upset because I was making fun of the fact that George Bush fell off his bike. So they turned off my microphone. Then a whole band came onstage behind me and started playing Sweet Home Alabama, as if to Americanize the space. I was really insulted because I love Skynyrd."   Out :  urlLink Bijou Phillips . Regarding the original rich girl gone wild,  urlLink Page Six writes , "In Phillips' hellcat heyday, she gained fame as an underage nightclub fixture, heroin addict,  Calvin Klein  model and Interview magazine cover girl. Phillips had a violent streak back then, too — she stabbed a friend in the leg one Valentine's Day and severed another pal's fingertip with a cigar cutter. She once shoved a certain socialite to the ground at Spy nightclub — the injured heiress had to be rushed to the hospital and received stitches to her skull." The Sixers continue with a quote from Director  James Toback , "who cast Phillips in  urlLink 'Black and White,'  may have summed it up best when he opined that she 'has no line between her unconscious and her articulation of it.'"    In :  urlLink Halle Berry and that orange bikini .  You know the one  of which  The Corsair  speaks.  urlLink According to Ananova  via  TeenHollywood :  "Halle Berry says she still uses the bikini she wore in the last Bond movie - to make sure she hasn't put on too much weight.  "Echoing  urlLink Ursula Andress in Dr No , Berry famously emerged from the sea wearing the orange bikini in Die Another Day.   The Corsair  will refrain -- just barely -- from publicly asking for said  undergarments  on the grounds that I might freak out some of my regular readers.  Protocol , you know.   Out :  urlLink Wonkette  blasts  George Herbert Walker  "Hey,  urlLink break me off  a piece of that Reagan gloss" Bush's parachute jump -- which is definitely and  desperately out , what, with pony boy studlet  urlLink Brit Hume , in tow, tagging along like a puppy in search of a dog yummy from his master.  Jump, Brit, jump --  good boy .   Out :  Adam Sandler . Ka-pow! Sandler, according to that significant cultural artifact the  urlLink National Enquirer  -- because Enquiring minds want to know -- "was the one in stitches after a surfing accident in Hawaii sent him to the hospital with his head split open."   Ouch!   "'Adam had a major wipeout on the first big wave he tried to catch, smashing his head on his board,' said a friend. Sandler had been working on his latest film,  urlLink Spanglish , for the last four months when he decided to fly off to Hawaii for a vacation.  "Minutes after the 'Big Daddy' star and his wife Jackie checked into Honolulu's Kahala Mandarin Oriental, he grabbed his surf instructor and headed for the waves.  "'Adam is becoming a better surfer all the time, but he is still a novice,' said the friend. 'He tried to catch a monster wave that came in. He lost his balance, slipped off the board and had a wild wipeout! The board popped up out of the water about seven feet in the air and then came crashing down on his head.  "'You could hear the thud when the board connected with his skull. His head cracked open and blood spurted into the water.  Luckily said skull was filled with air. 15 stitches later, Sandler was up and out of the hospital, but couldn't go in the water for the rest of the trip.   In :  Blind Items of Gossip . Check out this exquisitely juicy blind item from the folks at  urlLink LA.com :  "Recently, I attended the exclusive Los Feliz birthday bash thrown by one desirable young actor known for dating a hot indie starlet. Hummus and fried chicken were served out in the open, but guests had to work their way to the actor’s top-floor Spanish-styled bedroom to find the three half-naked bimbo strippers serving lines from close to a kilo of coke. (Each line was offered to guests’ hungry noses on a gold-plated coke spoon.) After getting their buzz on, the guests were given all the proper cocaine accoutrements: ice-cold vodka tonics, cigarettes galore scooped from large Moroccan bowls and pads of recycled paper to write down 'brilliant thoughts.' Later, after each and every guest was flying high, a troupe of African drummers loudly entered--which scared some of the more tweaked-out guests. Soon after the young actor’s white-boy friends joined in the drumming, the percussion transformed from soulful rhythm to “Pop Goes the Weasel,” proving once and for all that a bunch of coked-up white boys certainly can’t dance. Happy birthday, _____!"   urlLink The comments say Heath Ledger , but Heath is not a Gemini (he's an Ares), as this person has to be as he was recently celebrating his birthday. I would have guessed Jared Leto, who is now dating  urlLink Scarlett Johanssen , but he's a Sagitarius. Any other guesses?  More gossip: From the  urlLink superior Page Six :  "WHICH magazine staffer sold out his source for $10,000? A recently married pop singer/actress was so furious when her private luncheon hit the glossies, she had one of her people contact the writer and offer him the money for his source. The writer collected the cash in a bag."   Hmm .  urlLink I wonder .   And, finally,  also In :  urlLink Indiewire's excellent Eugene Hernandez notes :  " urlLink Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 , which is expected to open on between 500 and 1000 screens next week, has been rated 'R' by the Motion Picture Association of America. Yesterday, the film's distributors,  Lions Gate Films  and  IFC Films , issued a statement saying that they are appealing the decision."  An R rating might hurt ticket sales to the film.

(Portman laughs)   urlLink Natalie Portman : Very true.  urlLink Julia Roberts  plays the role of Anna, and we were laughing about the dirty words we have to say. You blush at first, and then you get pretty liberal with them.   Peter : There's nothing more fun than watching someone who's not quite comfortable with it really landing a well placed "fuck."

       Carly Simon: Nobody Does it Better    urlLink Interview Magazine July 2004 . An interview between Michael Kors and the always elegant  urlLink Carly Simon , who I am now totally in love with:  " Carly Simon : You know, when I was diagnosed with  urlLink breast cancer in 1997  I realized I had spent too long arranging my attitude. I had a mastectomy in 1998, and then chemo. And throughout the whole process I felt much worse. So I spent the next year really depressed, coming to terms with the whole thing. My oncologist said, 'Don't speak about it for a while. Get yourself together and decide what you really want to do.' Here, I'll show you this (shows mastectomy scar) Did you see?  " urlLink Michael Kors : Uh-huh. Yeah.  " Carly : My scar is beautiful. It looks like an arrow. I didn't bother rubbing things into it or having any silicone injections. I just keep it that way because I liked it.  " Kors : You know, I was at the meeting yesterday for the CFDA. It's the 10th Anniversary of 'Fashion Targets Breast Cancer' and we were talking about what we we're doing to commemorate it. Kenneth Cole said, 'I want to talk to Carly Simon. I don't know what we can do together, but it would be so meaningful. It's personal for her.'  " Carly : You know, people want to honor me, and on the one hand, I don't want to be a poster child; but on the other I want to do something classy and great -- something where the residuals would go to the cause. I thought of having a designer make a beautiful dress with cut outs here (points to scar) and doing a picture of me wearing it. I just want to show off my scar proudly and not be afraid of it. A really strong woman accepts the war she went through and is ennobled by her scars."

       Rosario Dawson: "I'm Attracted to Celebrities"    urlLink WYWS Magazine  did an interview with the kind of creepy looking African-American skateboarder  urlLink Harold Hunter .   urlLink Harold Hunter , the C-List skateboarder who hangs out at the Astor Place Cube once dated the reptilian  urlLink Rosario Dawson . But, as he will soon relate in agonizing detail to an unknown skateboarding magazine, things went terribly awry. Terribly. Awry. Oh yeah, that, and  urlLink Leonardo DiCaprio  is girlfriend-stealing puppy boy:   urlLink Harold Hunter : "( urlLink Rosario Dawson ) and I were going out and, like,she was attracted to actors and stuff like that. I remember one time, I went to a party and stuff like that, and I saw  urlLink David Blaine  sitting with Leonardo DiCaprio, and David was like, 'Yo, you know Leonardo's in love with Rosario Dawson.' I was like 'Yeah,' and I was like, 'Damn! He's gonna try and take my girl away, I know that.'"   The Corsair  groans, knowing what is going to happen next.  "So we're all sitting together, drinking. So they were looking at each other and Rosario's looking at (Leonardo). And I was like 'damn, man I know somethings gonna happen.' So Rosario got up and had to use the bathroom. I was talking to David Blaine, we were drinking, you know talking. Then Leo gets up and walks away. And Rosario's gone for a long, long time."   The Corsair  winces in pain for Harold.  "I was like 'Damn, where is this girl.' So I get up and go downstairs and  urlLink she's making out with Leonardo DiCaprio ."  "And that hurt my feelings, but I said, 'You know what, that's alright. In my head I said that, because if  urlLink Michelle Pfeiffer  were around I would kiss her too. At the end of the day, Rosario and I walked home, and she tried to kiss me and I was like 'I don't want your leftovers.' She said, 'Why?' I said 'I saw you kissing Leonardo.' ... She told me the truth, she said,  urlLink 'I'm attracted to celebrities.' "

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :   urlLink Mick Rock of Papermag.com's  extended meditation on Debbie Harry, the woman we all wanted to fuck back in the day, is brilliant:  "Ignoring him I asked the lot of them, 'If you had a chance to bed down with Debbie Harry tonight would you? Not really knowing what she looks like these days, just going off the memory that's burned into your head, would you sleep with her?' You'd think we were a car full of choirboys and not skateboarders the way we sung the word, 'Yes,' in unison. Then we saw her. The curtain opened, the house lights found her and had the band not already begun playing then the entire audience would have heard the sounds of our hearts breaking. She was old. She was no longer the girl we'd fallen in love with. Her skin hung lose on her face and arms like a perfectly cooked spare rib, her mini skirt was far too short for anyone her age and the worst of it? She had panty lines! Panty lines are sexy only with sweatpants or business casual. But these weren't cute, ass-defining panty lines. She was wearing big granny panties. I wanted to cry for her. Is there anything grosser than grandma panties? I wanted to rush the stage, rip them off her, use them as a sail and sail off to some faraway land where I would never have to think of the horror I saw that night. But it was too late, the damage had been done."   Out : Gary Oldman. According to  urlLink Hello! Magazine , he is planning on starring in the next Star Wars film, that is, of course, if anyone actually still cares about that franchise after what George Lucas has done with it:  "British actor  Gary Oldman  is set to carry on from his success as Harry Potter bad guy Sirius Black by taking on his most villainous role to date. The London-born star will be appearing in the new Star Wars film in the spine-chilling part of General Grievous.   "The fearsome character is described as the deadliest evildoer the series has ever seen. And Gary's fellow-Brit Ewan McGregor, who plays Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi, will have his work cut out when he comes face-to-face with the wicked warrior.   "'He's part alien and part robot,' revealed producer Rick McCallum. 'Grievous is a master strategist and the greatest hand-to-hand Jedi killer the galaxy has ever known.'"   No, George Lucas is the hands down greatest Jedi Killer thr galaxy has ever known.   In : Speaking about things sci-fi and "fantasy": Does Mary Jane hate Spidey ?  Say it aint so ! According to  urlLink the LA.com blog :  "It's amazing that everyone missed one of the juiciest nuggets behind the scenes of Spider-Man 2--that  Kirsten Dunst  and  Tobey Maguire  barely spoke to each other when off camera. Studio insiders told me that the bad blood between them began during the filming of the first Spider-Man, because Maguire didn't treat Dunst very nicely. Then, when Maguire was having his oft-reported back and salary problems, Dunst lobbied hard to have him recast with her real-life main squeeze, Jake Gyllenhaal. Maybe what's needed for Spider-Man 3 is a therapist for on-camera couples."    Out : Can you believe that an actress  of the calibre of  Kate Winslet  would drop out of a Woody Allen  production? Woody is the arty god of Hollywood, too smart to be mainstream, and too creepy to be Indie. Not only did Winslet commit the grave social felony of dropping out of a Woody Allen film, but a BBC funded Woody Allen flic at that,  his first British movie . According to  urlLink the Big News Network :  "British actress Kate Winslet has pulled out of  urlLink Woody Allen's new film  because it would leave her too little time for her young family.  "Winslett, married to director  Sam Mendes , was due to co-star with  Brian Cox ,  Emily Mortimer  and  Jonathan Rhys Meyers  in the unnamed film, which will be the first Allen film to be shot entirely in Britain.   "However, after realizing publicity duties for the  Johnny Depp -starring film Neverland plus Mendes' own work on Gulf War drama Jarheads would have kept her and her family apart all summer, Winslet withdrew from the film."  An actress pulling out of a prestige flic for family?  What the f-c#!    In :  urlLink Bill Clinton . That significant cultural artifact reports that Bill is tomcatting again. As if this is a surprie to anyone. Can't we all just all accept that  urlLink he has a non-traditional arrangement  with his wife and move on? Of course, if Bill Clinton has any more encounters with heads of state or Hollywood starlets, I'll be the first one to report it. I just won't moralize or playa hate.   Out :  Zell Miller ,  urlLink According to the AP :  " urlLink Georgia Sen. Zell Miller , the highest profile Democrat to endorse President Bush for re-election, will speak at the Republican National Convention later this summer, a congressional aide said Friday.   "According to the aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, Miller will give his address on Wednesday night of the convention in New York. The Bush-Cheney campaign was expected to make an official announcement later in the day. The convention will be held Aug. 30-Sept. 2."  This just may be a minor plus for possible Veepstakes hopeful  urlLink Max Cleland , also from Georgia.   In :  urlLink King Alfred the Great . I've been reading  urlLink Asser's Life of King Alfred , don't ask me why -- I get eclectic in the summer's -- and he was a fascinating character. A proto anti- urlLink Machiavelli  who operated in the sphere of political action but was personally governed by a deep religious idealism, he united Britain (The Angles and the Saxons), and drove off the barbarian Viking hordes who terrorized Europe. All British Kings, I believe, derive their authority from Alfred. Just reading this  urlLink fascinating account by Alfred's tutor, Asser , gives me a richer understanding of  urlLink Shakespeare  and  urlLink Byrd , the pomp and circumstance they have regarding the lineage of Kings (it is not that studied and fussed about in Uganda), by their genesis in King Alfred's struggle. I must be getting old, though, because I've been reading histories all month, which is something I told myself I'd never do. First  urlLink Thucydides  now this. And yes, people, when I am not trolling the gossip sites, drinking Cutty Sark at the local pub, ogling the ladies, or working at my various projects and schemes, I actually read  urlLink The Great Books . Slowly, too, taking a dozen pages in at a time and wrestling with their meaning. Imagine that.    Out : Slavery is over, but apparently it's okay to  urlLink sell a lecherous Frenchman online  (link via  urlLink TMLTMF ). Oh yeah, and does anyone know how to get DVD's of the original  urlLink Degrassi Junior High TV Show , that and the PBS hit series High Feather?

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  Rick James . From an interview with  Jamie Foxx  in the  urlLink July 2004 issue of Stuff Magazine :  "Rick James lives right down the street from me. He came to my house, he braught these girls with him, and he broke my bed. He was like, 'Yeah, Jamie, watch this!' He jumped on my bed and broke it. I'm such a fan of Rick James that I was just like, 'I don't care, man. Break the shit out of that mothafucka!' Rick James is hysterical. He gived you a window of when Hollywood was really Hollywood, the 70s shit, sex, drugs and rock and roll."    Out :  urlLink TheSmokinggun  came up with some really twisted freaky stuff today. Very disturbing, very  urlLink David Lynch :  "While seated on the bench, an Oklahoma judge used a male enhancement pump, shaved and oiled his nether region, and pleasured himself, state officials charged yesterday in a petition to remove the jurist. According to the below complaint filed by the Oklahoma Attorney General, Donald D. Thompson, 57, was caught in the act by a clerk, trial witnesses, and his longtime court reporter (these unsettling first-hand accounts will make you wonder what's going on under other black robes)."  Read the whole filthy little document  urlLink here  and then take a cool Visine eyebath.   In :  urlLink Zulkey interviews Slim Goodbody , AKA  John Burstein , a figure of androgynous happy fun joy from my childhood:   Zulkey : What did you do pre-Slim?   Slim : I did some acting in NY – way off- Broadway. I studied dance in Belgium, and dramatic literature at University.  " Zulkey : Has the bodysuit evolved over the years?  " Slim : Yes, I’ve had about a dozen or so. The painting gets better. I’ve added things like the diaphragm and changed the background colors a bit.  " Zulkey : What do you do to stay slim for the bodysuit?  " Slim : Swim, do aerobics, ride a bike, lift weights and eat right. I try to work out regularly."   Out : I'm thoroughly enjoying Clinton's My Life, but, after reading the  urlLink Larry McMurtry New York Times blow job , I'm not quite sure we are reading the same book, like when he says, lost in love:  "Had Clinton become our  urlLink Balzac , working all night at his office up in Harlem, with haggard gofers bringing in pizza, Chinese, ribs, whatever the Midnight Scribbler wanted? Could there even be a copy boy, making his last appearance in history, waiting to rush these pages down the street to Knopf?  "One of the appealing things about Bill Clinton, at least to literary types like me, is that he frequently reminds me of authors or their characters - for instance, there's  urlLink Thomas Wolfe , the big ghost from the other side of the South. Bill Clinton looks homeward often, to laud his angel mother, Virginia Kelley. But why stop there? You can have Clinton as  urlLink Gulliver , pricked by the Boss Lilliputian, Kenneth Starr; you can have him as  urlLink Tom Jones , eternally seeking his Dad; you can have him as  urlLink L'il Abner , wooing his Daisy Mae in the unlikely purlieu of Yale Law School; though to his gnatlike cloud of enemies he will always mainly be the Artful Dodger, the man they're convinced is getting away with something, even if, as is often the case, they can't figure out what."  Clinton's bio, as I read it -- and I'm about 300 pages in -- is a new kind of bio,  a Boomer bio  of an American President. This is an extraordinary happening. Clinton tells us things that  no President could ever imagine telling us  because of the generation out of which he has emerged, and because of the remarkable times where we live, now, as the unchallenged global superpower (Muslim Fundamentalists be damned!). This new phenomenon is, alas, not broached by McMurtry in his review, as he is so caught up in the act of performing what essentially amounts to a sloppy literary blow job.  urlLink It doesn't work . And we, the readers of the review, are so much the poorer for not having that topic adressed.   In :  urlLink Gawker.com's  special Learning Annex correspondent (Is that Our "Hendry" the Intern, again?) covers  Damon Dash's  lecture. I've always wondered about the internal politics of these things. I mean, how does it work? What manner of man would attend something so obviously silly and self promotional as a Learning Annex lecture by some artless pseudo-celebrity?  Apparently, the people willing to shell out the $50 are trying to slip the celebrity a resume in the process, or at least plead their case. Sounds yucky, tricking a celebrity to get some quick cash only to spring the musk of Young Manhattan Ambition on them. Not just Young Manhattan Ambition, but Young Manhattan Ambition that does not know the proper protocol for applying for a job, or getting that demo listened to. But then, in a way, The Learning Annex doesn't say -- now is not the time to pitch your tv show to Regis, he just wants to make some quick pocket change and not be accosted. No, the folks at The Learning Annex never say that ... it might cut into their bottom line.   Anyhoo : As you can imagine,  Damon Dash , a thug-entrepeneur, who tells us during the course of the report that he wears the "iciest" watches,  urlLink wasn't having any of this impromtu social advancement rally :  "Somewhere around this point there was a near-complete breakdown in order, owing almost entirely to the Learning Annex's poor planning. The microphone was being handled by a meek, small girl and she was taking questions, which virtually everyone had, in no discernible order. Finally, one guy started yelling, 'Can we just put a microphone in the middle and we line up because I don't even know how she's picking?'  "The crowd went crazy. There was total chaos for a few minutes and somehow out of it all this really big guy, who said he was a rapper named Solomon, got the microphone, telling the guy who had just freaked out, 'She ain't dissin' you homey. If you'd listened to what the man said. You would've just taken it for yourself,' to a general sarcastic rumble from the house.   "His 'question': 'I just want to let you know that there's one person here who understands you.'"  Never underestimate the creative character of Young Manhattan Ambition, in fact,  The Corsair  is planning on bottling a batch and selling it over eBay ... or something.   Out : I see  urlLink white people ! The United States Senate dress like plantation owners. Ought the Congressional Black Caucus to break into a spirited impromptu rendition of  urlLink "My Mammy"?   Kidding. ( The Corsair  flashes a devilish smile)   In : According to  urlLink A Fly On The Wall , "Steven Spielberg's Dreamworks studio has begun developing a movie thriller about a  urlLink Washingtonienne-like  character who becomes ensnared in a coverup and CIA-sanctioned assassination of a critical congressman, according to several screenwriters approached to pen the script.   "Unless you've been spending all your time buying tchotchkes on eBay, you probably followed the online adventures of the pseudonymous Capitol Hill hottie named  urlLink Washingtonienne  who blogged about her various sexual escapades involving bigwigs inside the Beltway.   "Spielberg's studio began developing the project after learning about the real Washingtonienne's  urlLink very public expose and subsequent firing  a few weeks ago.   In the Dreamworks film version, a Capitol Hill nymphette blogs anonymously about her Congressional sexcapades. When she annoys one too many powerbrokers, however, rogue CIA operatives frame her for a whistleblowing congressman's murder, and she must go on the run while simultaneously trying to prove her innocence and expose the real killers. "The movie will have a Enemy of the State sort of frantic pace and intensity," according to a Dreamworks internal development memo."  Crazy. Read more  urlLink here .   Out :  urlLink According to Wonkette , and we don't ever doubt her, "Chicago news outlets are reporting that Jack "Swing State" Ryan is dropping out of the race, leaving the field open for his hotter, less plagued by monumentally bad judgment competitor."

       My Favorite 70s TV    Most of this was posted on February 18th, though I have made several additions to the text, but since some new people have come along since then, I thought I'd republish it, for anyone who doesn't really know me other than the snarky in and outs and my bad  urlLink Interview with New Jersey  piece that so totally didn't work (sorry for subjecting you to that), but seemed like a good idea at the time:   What the fuck was up with  urlLink this ? When I was a kid  urlLink the dummy in Magic  kept me up at night, distraught. Imagine me, a dainty African Ambassador's son, in the 70s, sheltered from the horrors of the West in decline against the Soviet bulwark -- hey, that's the line we were getting from  urlLink Amin  -- freaking out over a dummy. Actually, there was a lot of  urlLink "puppetry"  as a "televisable entertainment," inexplicably going on in the 1970s, lots of arts and crafts and Shields and Yarnell. Crazy ...    urlLink Eight is Enough  brings back warm fuzzy memories of childhood. One of the most intense memories of my childhood is the episode where the actress Bradford "Joanie," was playing  urlLink the role Medea . It represented the Ultimate drama to me, at least the "deepest" drama I had ever encountered as an Ambassador's son constantly changing schools and continents. I was fascinated. Throughout the show she spouted lines  urlLink over 2,000 years old . The canned laughter did not distract me. It had the same hold over me as those creepy ads on tv for the King Tutankhaman exhibit at  urlLink the Met that aired during the mid 70s . Years later I found myself studying classics in college. Drama and the ancient, all represented by this hot chick, the actress,  urlLink Laurie Walters . I blame Joanie Bradford for introducing me to Euripides at an impressionable age.    urlLink Fellini's Satyricon . A pagan work, to be sure; groaning with alien laughter. Un-be- fucking -lievable: creativity on a galactic scale.  Nino Roti's  staggering sonic assault of music from another planet alone is worth the DVD price. The Rablasian Fellini walks us through Roman antiquity as he imagines it, crossed with highbrow science fiction sequences of an imagined future looking backwards, soaked in burgundy. There can never be anyone as Felliniesque as Fellini. Fellini has this really odd little maneuver, where the actors are frequently standing still, looking into the camera, which creates a very disturbing effect on the viewer, as if the actors, beyond time are watching us view their little spectacle. I have a pet theory that surrealism isn't really an art form at all,  urlLink just a division, or category of the occult . This movie would bear that theory out. Throughout the film -- the Minotaur spares Acyltus from a bludgeoning, prompting cosmic laughter spiralling at the end (the absurd universe?), then the rambling journey winding through the labyrinthine whorehouse at the beginning, with those withering close ups of the freaky pagan denizens therein, then the elaborate fake funeral at Trimalchio's dinner (eating and dying was all Trimalchio was about) -- all give off the combined effect that  the film is laughing at you, the viewer . From some distance outside of time the film is laughing at the viewer. Very,  very  strange effect, that; even now, the echoes of their laughter caused a chill up my spine. Also, the world's first  urlLink werewolf story,  the Tale of Niceras, which, told over the distance of two milennia, is incredibly creepy. But my Ascendant is Aquarius and I am a Gemini who studied ancient literature in college, so I truly dig the ancient sci-fi horror psychological vibe.    Carl Sagan's Cosmos : Okay, so in the madcap world of  urlLink astrophysics Sagan's hypotheses are probably all outmoded already . Right? So what? So is  urlLink Ptolemy's Almagest  and yet I still read it in college and gained benefit. The methods by which man came to his conclusions about the universe are worthy of contemplation; and, of course, worthy of more questions in light of our most current data. Cosmos is no exception. This series was the bomb! ( looks around sheepishly, then raises hand , " question : who is the biggest  PBS  geek in the room"?) Classics are never outmoded, they exist to be rediscovered and add onto.&nbsp;    urlLink Chespirito . This show was a mystery to me: Why would a grown Latin man in need of some excercise want to go on tv dressed like a racy little bumble bee number emblazoned with a big "CH" on his paunch.  Subtitle it  and put it on Trio; I'd watch it just to clarify my childhood mystery. I'd like to crack open a cold cerveza and figure this out.  What the fuck was going on here ? Why is everyone else laughing but me? I feel like I'm in a Fellini movie, but it is in Spanish and the sets are decidedly low rent. We'd all like to know what the people on that endless laugh track find so fucking hilarious.&nbsp; I think this was a Mexican Show and, to be honest, I've always wanted to know what the life of a Mexican immigrant is like -- they seem to be sadly, partially through language, a very socially seperate part of New York City.&nbsp; Often when I come back drunk from Soho, you can see the men getting off of work as busboys, taking their checks home to their wives. They seem decent people,&nbsp;even after some Heinekins and incredibly long hours at bad wages and horrendous treament. I'm getting off the subject.    urlLink Stoned, the Afterschool Special with Scott Baio . "Super Stoned Jack," was the scariest introduction that most of us had to the world of the sweet leaf. Sensimila? Not if you have any sensibilities! The tag line for this read:   "Jack is a motivated high school student who smokes cannabis for the first time, and falls in with a fast crowd. Will he wake up and realize what he's doing with his future before it's too late?"   If I were  stoned  I would never go out in a row boat on the grey and greasy river limpopo.  Well , certainly not after seeing this little chestnut of a public service announcement made by anxious parents of latchkey kids in the Age of Studio 54. Put it on Trio so we can all laugh at the "reefer madness." Just say  yes  to that Farah Fawcett haired character Felicity. But I'm sure skeevy New York Times writer  Neill Strauss  will.   The Boy Who Drank Too Much Site wraps up a major plat point up nicely:   "Scott Baio plays a high school nerd, complete with glasses, pocket protector and the nickname "Melonhead." At first, clean-cut Jack (Baio) wants nothing to do with the burn-outs who sneak joints into the Boys' Room. Unfortunately, Jack's accomplishments are ignored, since Dad is too busy doting on his jock older brother Mike (Vinnie Bufano). Plus, a cute blonde named Felicity in Jack's Spanish class ( urlLink Largo Woodruff , who later appeared in Tobe Hooper's THE FUNHOUSE) has him (excited), but the guy is too scared to speak to her. These teen pressures have Jack prepared to do anything to change his boring life -- even smoke grass! Oh, no! Of course, a couple tokes later, he's instantly hooked! Jack takes off his glasses, undoes the top button on his shirt, giggles uncontrollably, and suddenly finds the nerve to hang out with Felicity."    Dummy .  urlLink Gritty 70s drama  of urban social decline -- thanks,  Ed Koch !  Asshole ! Back in the Koch day, NYC was all about twitchy pimps with straightrazors and purple suits with ruffled shirts and jewel encrusted goblets wandering the urban landscape (hey, come to think of it,  urlLink the pimpy fashion aesthetic  is very ... umm...  urlLink priest -like), as well as greaser glue sniffing graffiti punks roaming the streets, wild-eyed, switchblades at the ready, in search of a little of the old  ultraviolence . Koch turned NYC into a  Guns n Roses  video, with  Mr. Brownstone  creeping around Central Park in a raincoat with nothing on underneath!   Get  this  plot, though, peeps:  LeVar Burton  plays a  deaf  and  dumb  mute who is framed for the death of a prostitute (Kuta Kinte, you are a  framed  man!). But will we get  justice  for the amiable host of  urlLink Reading Rainbow ?    Anyhoo : Will a young  Paul Sorvino  get him redemption when he cannot even communicate with his morose client? Or will "Dummy" just become another urban statistic on the Koch street? Despite the overall bleakness, this a very,  very  cool slice of social commentary.  &nbsp;  I loved this movie soo much in the 70s. I was an odd kid, as you can imagine.    urlLink Bugsy Malone . This was the shit when I was a kid. Scott "Chachi" Baio, who, incidentally, Hollywood has not been kind to, is in a period gangester flic ... only  everyone is little kids . Crazy.    urlLink Jodie Foster  plays an oversexed  Tallulah Bankhead  rip off. Why were Jodie Foster's preadolescent roles so highly sexualized? I think Ms. Foster has a  legitimate  gripe with her stage mother. And one can only imagine the shit she had to deal with on those sets in Hollywwod playing a sexually charged tween. Remember, Mary-Kate and Ashley were objects of desire waay before they turned legal. There's a gangster called Fat Sam. And the whole crazy 70s scenario is about spud guns, the empowerment of children -- I fell for this film hook, line and sinker. There is a veiled sense of poking fun at the Cold War here, the escalation of arms, detente, and all that, but a kid, even a precocious little diplobrat like me wouldn't see it.  urlLink I loved this movie . I wish Trio would put it back on (" urlLink anybody who is anybody  will soon walk through that door/ at fat sams grand slam speakeasy")    urlLink Kramer vs. Kramer . The first dramatic and fully articulated statement of the Baby Boomers achieving adulthood. A film of the first water. Young married couple breaks apart. They become two seperate people, no longer the Eisenhower nuclear family, post sexual revolution. Wife leaves shallow workaholic husband and baby to find her own particular nebulous conception of 70s "freedom". Goes out West. Hints of Big Sur,  urlLink Esalen  and the "Me" Generation. She finds herself. Comes back revitalized. In the meantime, shallow husband once defined by his work, like an IBM-era blue tie white shirt Organization Man, like--probably--his father changes,  grows . Welcome to 1978, motherfucker. Ka-Pow!   Husband fights custody.  Bach  and  Vivaldi  weave in and out of this drama artfully; a drama that takes place, it seems, embroidered into the most poignant colors of Autumn in Central Park, from skeletal oranges and violent reds to sepia oches and deep emerald greens, the seasons wheel by heavily, like a Buach fugue. Those colors and the rich tonal echoes of Bach and Vivaldi accurately reflect the heightened emotion of the drama -- the decisive break from the previous Norman Rockwell-era, the divorce and emancipation of the Boomers in film.   And the courtroom scene where  Meryl Streep  slowly dissolves into tears offset by a forced composure, dignified in her hour of humiliation (better than  Jane Fonda  in Klute) as Hoffman's lawyer vivisects her irresponibility -- her feminism, her 1978ness -- are among the  best goddamned  acting you ever will see. Kramer versus Kramer is as good as film gets, heralding the onset of the Boomer Generation in much the same way  urlLink Bill Clinton's My Life  will forever change the way our "Kings" narrate the sequence of their movements through the stream of time.    Poldark:  This cult British tv series is quite habit forming. Incredible. Just  urlLink incredible . A period piece that is a cross between  Wuthering Heights ,  the Mayor of Casterbridge  and  Les Liaisons Dangereuse  but with a compelling soap opera character at its heart. A silver mine in the American colonies, unrequited love, lots of horses racing with that dull but electric blue 1970s skyline backdrop, aristocratic dreams thwarted -- call me  urlLink Madame Bovary , but I dig that classical romanticism. A guilty high quality pleasure. You get sucked in to this costume drama that is one part  Danielle Steele  and one part high art.    Assorted Good Times episodes:  Come on, you know you had a crush on  Wilona  ("and you too, Wilomena" said the archetypical corrupt pol,  Alderman Davis ) when you were kid, didn't you -- the only blingy woman in the projects; or, if you were a girl,  Bookman the janitor  was your  long, cold drink of water . What, you never saw a black man doing a  John Wayne  impression,  pilgrim ? You better  act like you know . And you know in your heart Wilona saved  Janet Jackson  from falling down that elevator shaft while trying to escape her mom who beat her with a hot iron just before she became Willis' girl, then  Cleo  on Fame.("and you too, Winooski") . But I was totally in love with Wilona; just as every African-American man my age took his cues from the proud George Jefferson as an influence, we all had a thing for Wilona, and many, many of the brothers are, as we speak, marrying Wilona clones. We can't help it. Her father must have been with the PLO, cause she was Tha Bomb!   Remember the episode where Michael gets  crunk  off some dodgy ghetto "health tonic" (aka, muscatel) with a dangerously high alcohol content? Crazy.  urlLink classic  ("Get  Vita Brite  and sleep tonight" ...*promptly passes out*).   Then there was the time Michael joined a gang and hid his jacket in the oven, which prompted  JJ  to note that the smell emanating from the kitchen was an improvement on Thelma's cooking.  Oh , what about the one where Thelma almost married this polygamist Nigerian cat.  Crazy ! What about that  pimpy  guy "Lennay," who always sold  hot  appliances from out of his coat.  Classic . So was the episode when James has hypertension. Apparently most of the writers were white, too. So was ...  hey  ... was this  urlLink a comedy or what ?  ("and you too, Winifred")    Cinema Paradiso . The best work of art on the subject of friendship I've ever encountered.  The Corsair  lost a couple of tears in his  Cutty Sark  at the end of this one. Any classroom reading of urlLink  Artistotle  on Friendship should include a look at this film.    urlLink Shields and Yarnell . Come on, you know you liked it -- mime, dance and comedy sketches. What more could you want? Okay, talent ... is nice.    Fame the TV Series : Why are there not repeats on  VH1  of this show already? When you say low budget and high quality I think ..  right here's where you start paying for it ... with pain ... and sweat . The show of young, artistic people struggling for their moment to shine is about as American as it gets and less cruel than Donald Trump's Apprentice, where sharky career advancement is all about crippling the competition. Whatever happened to that sexy cello player who wouldn't give anyone the time of day,  urlLink Lori Singer . I was all about the emotional cellist yet frosty behaving  Lori Singer  back in the day.  Yummy.     Cries and Whispers  by  Ingmar Bergman . If  urlLink Black Stallion  is the most beautifully shot film, then this is number two. All natural lighting. Bergman uses a fade to red to seperate scenes, mimicking the inner membrane of our eyelids. About as fucking intense as art can get. And halfway through this film about communication and treachery -- where the incessant ticking of an pocketwatch reminds us of time's passage -- Bergman dissolves a reconcilliation scene between two hard hearted sisters into  urlLink Bach's Sarabande no. 5 in D minor . That's so fucking cool it hurts to just write it (*sips  Cutty Sark  to steady hisself*)    The Black Stallion:  Those fabulous Copollas! This is perhaps the most beautiful filmed movie ever. From the point of view of a boy.  urlLink The Black Stallion  is really about the restrictive society. Very 70s in that it lauds freedom ("keep on truckin'"). The image of the horse adrift in the Pacific Ocean, a burning ship sinking in the background, and the boy, by pure instinct, snatching the floating rope as it passes, is straight out of  urlLink Jung  -- all boldness, the act of grabbing hold; the rest is archetypal images of power and the unconscious.    The Gore Vidal-Bill Buckley Debate-Fight  It was in the heart of the 60s: the polarized political center of the 60s. The left and the right clash violently  on national television . In the  news division  of a  respectable network .  Fuck!  A  classic . The country was divided in those days is an understatement.  Excellent . Buckley is the Grandfather of the American conservative movement; Vidal the leading leftist rhetorician (lefties don't organize hierarchical movements, it goes against type). For a moment, our two leading intellectuals of our two political polarities went at it in a bareknuckled intellectual fistfight. Not since  urlLink Burr shot Hamilton dead  has there been so much political drama in The Republic. Was there something in the water in the late 60s, or was everyone just  crezzzzy.     Woody Allen's Teleplay:  Don't Drink the Water .  One of the  urlLink most interesting  experiments on television ever.  Woody Allen  directs and writes a teleplay starring  Michael J Fox  and the kid who played  urlLink Blossom  (Incidentally, you'll have to remind me to get back to the subject of Blossom). Shaky handheld camera follows a grown  Michael J. Fox  as he slowly becomes involved with a bright but much younger woman. How the fuck did this get on American and not Parisian tv? Aren't we supposed to be puritainical? Did Woody Allen have so much juice back in the day that he could put on pedophilic Americana on network tv? Does the story sound familiar?  Actually  the story is tame, and inventive and very, very arty.  Whatever happened to Slim Goodbody?   True, he was slim.  Very  slim. Okay,  urlLink John Burstein  was the classic  urlLink ectomorph geek . But we were  urlLink wild and innocent  youth at the time. What were we to know about cool? But even as a kid, I did pick up a certain ... nervousness. Now, maybe that had to do with a really fast metabolism on his part. Or, maybe it's just the plain fact that dressing up in his mom's panty hose with your innards haphazardly painted on them  isn't  the best way to make a living; it's just not a socially acceptable way of being gainfully employed. And add on to that the fact that he did this in front of kids.  Creepy factor . In the name of (makes broad ironical quotation marks with his fingers) " health education ."   Said ectomorph with an afro would actually sing these horrible --  horrible  -- rockabilly ditties and dance this really spastic jazzercize numbers, chicken legs flapping in the wind, all in full view of kids. How lame is that?   When I was a kid at the  urlLink UN School  it was considered lame to watch Slim Goodbody. Nowadays similar social leprosy could be gained from admitting to the consumption of  urlLink Benson and Hedges cigarettes , or purchasing a  urlLink Kenny G album .   For whatever unfathomable reason of the childhood cruelty of my generation, the Yemeni Ambassador's kid at the UN School was considered  a geek . Kids are old school like that. Now, in his early 30s, that kid is right about now a mid level official in the tyranny there, taking out all his childhood aggressions on innocent civilians.  Shit happens : I can't be held accountable.    Anyhoo : Even that kid -- let's call him  the monkeyboy  -- he thought  Slim Goodbody  was lame.  That  guy. And you know your up shits creek without a paddle if your shtick cannot appeal to the undiscriminating tastes of the Yemeni Ambassor's kid.    urlLink Matthew Starr  pretended to be an earthling, but he was really the Crown Prince of the Planet  Quadris . His father was overthrown by tyrants, so he was sent here to develop his telekenetic powers then go back to throw down some furious anger at his oppressors. His mentor is  Louis Grossett Junior , who also pretends to be his science teacher.&nbsp; Grossett notwithstanding, this show was a little too "caucasian" for me, no offense (to be honest, A Different World, in the later seasons, was a little too "African-American" for me, as well, no offense).  As opposed to, say,  urlLink Bennu of the Golden Light , who is a messenger from an alien world, a scout. Bennu is looking for his lost companion,  Mira . He aids people in distress with his freaky magical amulet.  You better recognize .&nbsp; Loved it: superhero on tv.   urlLink Alan Fawcett  was the host of a show which scored pantomimers on originality, appearance and lip synch.    urlLink Quincy's  understanding of forensic medicine was way ahead of it's time for prime time tv. He,  Quincy , of the LA Coroner's office. He lived on a boat, was a 70s swinger, and played detective to find evidence to support his theories of unexplained deaths. This did not endear  urlLink Jack Klugman  to the  urlLink po-po .    urlLink Greg Evigan  played the independent trucker  BJ McCay . He was a medevac pilot in the Nam and, somehow, managed to smuggle a chimp named  Bear  back with him. Living in a truck has it's advantages, as he croons in the theme song, "Best of all, I don't pay  property tax ."  Sheriff Lobo  was always on his ass for something or other.

Governor,  urlLink Benson DuBois . (*snickers*  DuBois?)  His plight  mirrored  the rise of African Americans throughout the 70s, more accurately than  Good Times  (the low estimate) or  The Jeffersons  (an inflated estimate of the African American plight). He bantered with the Wagnerian housekeeper  urlLink Gretchen Krauss , played so ably, ironically by the Nebraska-born  Inga Swenson .  urlLink That freaky kid Missy Gold  with the big eyes and the adult dialogue kind of wierded me out. She harshed on my  urlLink "I'd Like To Buy The World A Coke"  70s vibe. Benson always had an ironic stance -- laughing -- and I try to bring that to my own brand of cultural commentary.  So,  now you know .

       Stasi Drugged; Spiegelman Pitches to Moss' New York?   According to  urlLink fashionweekdaily :  "New York Post columnist / TV writer Linda Stasi was out of commission for a few days recently after someone drugged her drink during a night on the town. Stasi felt sick after a cocktail at the Villard Bar and Lounge in the New York Palace Hotel the other night. She went to the hospital and was treated for mild poisoning, and had to be hooked up to an IV at one point. Doctors told her she was drugged but did not know what with, and Stasi has no idea who might have slipped her the mickey or why. She is said to be reviewing her legal options."    urlLink Brandusa Niro's Fashionweek Daily  is coming on bold and fast with the scoops ( Full Disclosure :  The Corsair  occasionally does projects for  Brandusa , so take this with a grain of salt if you must, but we like her, she's got a fantastic, larger than life personality).  Fashionweekdaily continues, " Graydon Carter's  new hire from the salmon-hued weekly,  urlLink Frank DiGiacomo , is said to be working on a piece about  urlLink New York gossip columnists  for his first assignment."  Which is interesting, considering  urlLink the war going down between Page Six and Lloyd Grove , with appearances by  urlLink Howard Stern and Beth Ostrowsky , the  urlLink National Enquirer's Mike Walker  and  urlLink New York Press Editor Jeff Koyen , for good measure. It's like a goddamn gossip World War Three up in this bitch, yo. Anyhoo,  urlLink fashionweekdaily  continues:  " ... Page Six scribe  Ian Spiegelman , who got the axe earlier this week after some ill-advised remarks he made to the New York Daily News, is pitching a piece about his travails to New York magazine."   Ian Spiegelman  is genius, and  urlLink Adam Moss  would be a fool not to jump on this as a cover story that would generate phenomenal media buzz.  urlLink Each can be useful to the other . Moss' vision and Spiegelman's blood vendetta mesh well in this instance: Moss likes to reveal how the city's power institutions work, and who can give a better view into the New York gossip industry than the outspoken and clearly out for revenge Spiegelman.  urlLink Fresh faced Alexandra Polier  wagging her finger at ( The Corsair  makes quotation mark gestures out of thin air)"The Media"? Fuck no, baby pop, lets go with a  urlLink Rablasian  alpha male like  Ian Spiegelman  attacking  Daniel Dechert's  upcoming New York Press article, which, incidentally, no one in The Chattering Classes worth their weight in black clothing will read, because, like, I mean,  really  --  urlLink who reads the New York Press ?

       Amsterdam, Taiwan: Bill Clinton and Rudolf Nuryev   Please, O Lord,  Give us this day our Daily Clinton :  "I went to Amsterdam with my artist friend Aimee Gautier. The streets were covered with Christmas lights and lined with charming shops. The famous red-light district featured perfectly legal prostitutes on display in their windows. Aimee jokingly asked if I wanted to go into one of the places, but I declined.  "We toured the main churches, saw the  urlLink Van Goughs  at the Municipal Museum and  urlLink the Vermeers at the Rijksmuseum . At closing time, we were asked to leave the wonderful old place. I went to the cloakroom to pick up our coats. There was only one other person left in line to pick up his. When he turned around, I found myself facing  urlLink Rudolf Nuryev . We exchanged a few words and he asked me if I wanted a cup of tea. I knew Aimee would love it, but just outside the front door, a handsome, frowning young man was anxiously pacing, obviously waiting for Nuryev, so I took a pass. Years later, when I was governor, I found myself in the same hotel with Nuryev in Taipei, Taiwan. We finally got our cup of tea late one night after we had fulfilled our respective obligations. Obviously he didn't recall our first meeting."   urlLink Bill Clinton, My Life   Well, let me spell it out for you, Bill, as delicately as I can; You can't expect a man to remember each person he ever invited for a, ahem ( The Corsair  makes gestures out of thin air with his fingers of quotation marks), "cup of tea." Get it?   urlLink Oldhag  contemplates another Clintonian romantic moment.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  urlLink David Lee Roth , who has been quite active of late on the New York party circuit. First he was on  The Sopranos , now, apparently, he's all buddy-pal with  Jason Binn . Not a bad resume. According to  urlLink Fashionweekdaily , the Binn's will be living it up upscale with Diamond Dave on the Fourth of July, "WeÂ?ll be out in Aspen with [former Van Halen frontman] David Lee Roth launching  urlLink Aspen Peak ."  And if that weren't wild enough, Roth is running with the angels now that he was  urlLink passed over to front Van Halen . Here's the quote of the day from Fashionweekdaily, made by David Lee Roth at  urlLink Jason Binn's  pool party, "I've been riding around in an ambulance doing actual EMT work and it's amazing what you find in each of the different neighborhoods. On the Upper East Side, it's mostly heart attacks; on the Lower East Side, you have the ecstasy overdoses; and in Harlem, you find all the traumas."      Out :  urlLink Michiko Kakutani , Presidential memoirs snob. There are many potential kinds of snob to be on the hypocritical Upper West Side ("What? We don't believe in social hierarchies!"): a white wine snob, the privatenurseryy school snob, the Lincoln Center tickets snob, the stone ground cracker snob, restaurant snobs, an Asian adopted baby snob, even -- dare we say it? -- an electrical car snob (you get my point about Upper West Side liberals?). But, lo and behold, woe unto thee if you are the worst snob of them all -- a Presidential memoirs snob (Averted Gaze).  urlLink Editor and Publisher writes :  "In an unprecedented move, The New York Times late Wednesday posted on its Web site a review of a book not scheduled to run until July 4 in its Sunday Book Review. This, of course, is no ordinary book, but Bill Clinton's new memoir, 'My Life.'   "The review, by famed novelist  Larry McMurtry , calls the book 'the richest American presidential autobiography.'   "Although the Times did not indicate the reason, much criticism has been leveled at the paper since last Sunday, when  urlLink it published an extremely unflattering review  of the same book on its front page (a very rare event), two days before the book was published. That review, by regular critic Michiko Kakutani, called the book 'sloppy, self-indulgent and often eye-crossingly dull.'  "... Times spokeswoman  Kathy Park , in announcing the early posting, did not address any of the criticism or the reason for putting the new review up so early.  "McMurtry in the new review says that 'snobbery' is the reason some reviewers have compared Clinton's book unfavorably to  urlLink the classic by Ulysses S. Grant . 'Some people don't want slick Bill Clinton to have written a book that might be as good as dear, dying General Grant's,' he charges.  "He adds, slyly, 'There are plenty of stout sticks to beat Clinton with, but Grant's memoir is not one of them.'"  Like I said,  Out :  Michiko Kakutani , Presidential memoirs snob (sniff, sniff, Averted Gaze).   In :  urlLink Good Plastic Surgery  (link via  urlLink Defamer ). All we hear about is  urlLink the bad plastic surgery . Sometimes silicon is our  urlLink friend . And sometimes silicon is  urlLink our enemy .    Out :  Danny Aiello  plays the outer borough "ethnic" card,  urlLink according to Lloyd Grove  (Say what you will about Grove, he is making the tabloid wars far more exciting and competitive than  urlLink Mitch Fink  ever did):  "Snubbing the rev: That was Danny Aiello refusing even to look at  Al Sharpton  Tuesday night when Sharpton dropped by Aiello's table at the Four Seasons Restaurant to say hi to  Jason Binn ,  David Lee Roth  and half a dozen others dining with the actor. 'I'm not going to shake hands with Al Sharpton - I just can't do that!' Aiello vowed."   Come on , Danny Boy, the Reverend is just your harmless garden variety attention seeking buffoon. He's not dangerous like the Staten Island-Howard BeachBensonhurstt (The Corsair makes quotation marks gesture out of thin air) "powernexusx" believes ( The Corsair  softly chuckles). It's not like he pals around and makes  urlLink sundry business deals with convicted felons .   Ka-Pow !   In :  urlLink Sheik Chic ? What will the Muslim fundamentalists say when a Dubai, United Arab Emirates investment group buys into one of the hallmarks of "Western Decadence"? Come to think of it, "Western Decadence" sounds like a theme that Donatella has, uhm, pursued in her life. Anyhoo:  urlLink Vogue reports :   "HAS Versace found a buyer? The Italian fashion house, which is the subject of much speculation ahead of  urlLink Allegra's 18th birthday  next Wednesday, has apparently been contacted by the Istithmar fund about buying a minority stake. Versace admitted earlier this year that it was looking for a financial partner and, with Gianni's niece due to inherit 50 per cent of the business next week, the fashion world has been on tenterhooks to see what will happen next. It seems that this Dubai, United Arab Emirates-based investor group, which has a bank balance in the region of $2 billion, has big plans, however. 'A brand like Versace is the dream of any sheik,' Matteo Corsini, the Italian partner of Istithmar, told Women's Wear Daily. 'I think Versace is the best brand in Italy. New money is a good combination with the Versace brand.' While CVC Partners, Cerebus and Apax Partners, all of which were expected to show an interest in the house, have failed to come up with any offers, Versace itself is refusing to comment on any rumours. 'The company has received great interest from many parties,' it said. 'All inquiries have been forwarded to our advisers Credit Suisse First Boston and Lazard.'"   Out :  urlLink Kimberly Stewart's Chihuahua . One of the unwritten rules of being a socialite, or, for that matter, rock royalty such asKimberlyt Stewart no doubt is, requires that if you have an annoying little Vienna sausage-sized dog, you need to either carry it in your Louis Vuitton, or get a  urlLink special carrier for it . No exceptions. To do anything less would be to damage the social honor of said dog. And a social misdemeanor on a  urlLink nervous dog of that size  could be fatal to his little over-bred heart.  But don't quote me on that .   Imagine the social insecurity that dog is feeling, being trotted around the fashionable districts in London in a paper bag. That's like placing a crown of thorns on the son of god, I'm serious,  people will talk . If  Kimberly Stewart  were seen in a respectable neighborhood carrying her little weiner dog in a (averted gaze) paper bag (cough that signifies feigned detatchment) ... the  urlLink ASPCA  would be on her ass faster than  urlLink Christian Slater in the strip club  VIP room.    In :  urlLink La.com's blog  has an interesting blind item that has me bewildered in a way I have not quite been since  urlLink Heidegger's unorthodox reading of pre-Socratic philosopher Heraclitus :  "Even Dollys titanium-clad heart goes out to that young show biz beaut who could soon be spending some of her gazillions on couples therapy--if, that is, she wises up to the wild and wanderin ways of her good-lookin-travelin-man boyfriend. The sexy young thang must be so busy with her own booming multihyphenate career that she doesnt have time to snoop into her boyfriends luggage before he hits the road. See, her man tends to cram his with such goodies as whips, handcuffs, leather masks, seriously scary dildos and those ever-popular tit clamps. If our starry-eyed little miss werent in such a state of denial, she might also have the time to check with the maids and staffs of the hotels at which her boyfriend stays, especially since the dude is so careless about leaving behind those sex toys wherever he goes. As for the pain-loving guy, we guess the dummy hasnt figured out yet that the butch, foreign dominatrix types he likes to hire bring their own toys with them at no additional charge."

       Lloyd Grove Causes a Media Ruckus    urlLink Lloyd Grove  sure is causing a lot of media ruckus, and I'm not sure I mean that in a good way.  Allow me to explain : Just last week Our Man Lloyd was  urlLink feuding mightily with Howard Stern , the self proclaimed King of All Media, (actually, the feud is only in detente, not over, why just yesterday he harshed on Stern's gal pal Beth Ostrowsky, bringing forth a rain of insult and a cryptic, 'I've got something for Richard Johnson') and now,  voila , he claims he cost Page Sixer Ian Spiegelman his job. Actually, it was a sissy move by writer  urlLink Daniel Dechert , who sneaked Grove the story.    The Spiegelman-Dechert contretemps  began with  urlLink a Page Six story  by Spiegelman saying, among other things:  "A PROMISING teenage writer is in the middle of an angry dispute with her ex-boyfriend on the eve of her book's debut.   "Abigail Vona, 19, details how she overcame being a 15-year-old drug addict with a year at a teen boot camp in her upcoming memoir  urlLink 'Bad Girl: Confessions of a Teenage Delinquent'  (RuggedLand). But she may have an even harder time overcoming a fight with her former boyfriend, man-about-town Douglas Dechert.   "Vona claims she dumped Dechert, 47, last Wednesday after a year-long relationship she now describes as 'pretty gross.' Dechert, Vona says, proceeded to throw her belongings into the street."  And things heated up  urlLink yesterday when Grove wrote :  "In a toxic screed that the weekly  New York Press  plans to print next week, Dechert calls his ex-girlfriend - who dumped him last month - 'barely literate.' He adds that she has 'the heart of a mercenary and the soul of a hustler.'  "Yesterday, Vona told Lowdown: 'I'm excited about the book, but I'm worried about Doug. He just won't go away ... I got into a bad relationship with Doug.'  " ... New York Press editor in chief  Jeff Koyen  called Dechert's article 'a fun, entertaining indictment of New York publishing. I think people will enjoy reading it.'"   urlLink Does anyone still read the New York Press ? Anyhoo: Dechert made claims that Ian Spiegelman courted Vona while writing the original Page Six article, a charge which was not substantiated. Plus, Dechert seems to be a jealous creep, so he would probably say anything.  urlLink Spiegelman responded with an email :   "You're a lame and a pussy, Doug. And you should know better than to try and wage war on me. I'm better, stronger and smarter than you, you little Nancy. If I wanted to take your girl out, I would. You have nothing I can't take away from you, you non-man."   And, of course, as Nancy's and non-men are wont to do, Dechert ran giggling to share the contents of this private yet combative email with a gossip columnist, namely, Grove, who in turn shared the contents of the email with Post PR consultant Howard Rubenstein, who finally shared it with Post Editor Col Allan. You see where I'm going with this. In the end Spiegelman got fired, which is a shame, but with his solid rep it shouldn't be too hard for a man like him to land squarely on his feet in this town.

       Clinton: "Clawing my way through a maze"   "The most challenging course I took in high school was calculus. There were seven of us in that class, it had never been offered before. One day the teacher, Mr. Coe, handed an exam in which  urlLink I had all the right answers  but a grade reflecting that I'd missed one. When I asked about it, Mr. Coe said I hadn't worked the problem properly, and therefore must have gotten the correct answer by accident, so he couldn't give me credit for it. In the textbook the answer required several more steps than I had used. Our class had one true genius, Jim McDougal (no, not the Whitewater one), who asked if he could see the paper. He then told Mr. Coe he should give me credit because my solution was as valid as the one in the textbook, indeed better, because it was shorter. He then volunteered to demonstrate the validity of his opinion. Mr. Coe was just as much in awe of Jim's brain as the rest of us, so he told him how to get ahead. Jim then proceded to fill two full blackboards with symbolic mathematical formulas analyzing the problem and demonstrating how I had improved on the textbook's solution. You could have fooled me. I had always liked solving puzzles, still do, but I was just clawing my way through a maze.  urlLink I didn't have a clue  about what Jim was saying, and I'm not sure Mr. Coe did either, but at the end of his bravura performance I got my grade changed. That incident taught me two things: that in problem solving, sometimes good instincts can overcome intellectual inadequacy; and that I had no business pursuing advanced mathematics any further."   urlLink Bill Clinton, My Life

       Eric Benet to Halle Berry: Pay Up!   This, according to that significant cultural artifact  urlLink The Star :  "Now that  Halle Berry , 37, has finally filed for divorce from her cheating husband  urlLink Eric Benet , sources say that Benet seems to be pulling out all the stops to get as much money as he can from his soon-to-be ex-wife. He's currently challenging the prenuptial agreement they signed at the start of their 32-month marriage, and he's using his 12-year old daughter, India, as a pawn, according to insiders."   The Corsair  munches unsalted popcorn and moves in closer.  "'Eric has demanded insane amounts of money to maintain his lifestyle,' says an insider. 'He's telling Halle that India, too, is starting to suffer and has become withdrawn because she was taken out of that lifestyle 'so abruptly,'  "On June 1, Benet, 37, filed papers in Los Angeles Superior Court questioning the validity of his prenup. Neither Berry's nor Benet's reps returned calls for comment."  Moving in closer,  The Corsair  mouths, silently: "It's on ... it's on like Gray Poupon."  "Outside court, however, sources tell Star that Eric has shamelessly brought his daughter into the mix, even threatening to limit Halle's visits with her. Halle and India have been close ever since Halle and Eric became serious in the late '90s. When the couple married in January 2001, Halle accepted India -- whose biological mother died in a car accident when she was a toddler -- as if she were her own. 'I'm all she's got as far as a mother goes,' Berry has said. 'It feels as if she's my own; she calls me 'mommy.'   The Corsair  mouths the words, a tear gliding down his downy cheek, 'Mommy.'  " ... Now India appears to be at the center of a divorce battle that has become increasingly bitter in recent weeks, sources say. Benet 'tells Halle that India has gotten used to the way other girls -- rich girls -- dress, act and shop. Therefore, he wants Halle to pay up,' the insider says. 'He pretty much dangled India in front of Halle's nose -- like dangling a carrot in front of a horse -- and when she went to grab it, Eric would pull India back until Halle melted down,' says the friend. For a while these scare tactics seemed to work, but sources say Halle has now had enough. The insider says, 'Halle is hoping any fair judge will see Benet's ploy for what it is and not award him one dime.'"  Eric Benet strikes  The Corsair  as a lazy, shiftless, lowdown cheating ...  musician .    Quick : What do you call a musician who breaks up with his girlfriend?  Homeless ...

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  urlLink Prince . Last week his CD Musicology made  urlLink 95,000 "sales,"  although they were really given away to fans that baught tickets.  Clever .

As if that weren't appalling enough, Rivers will be  urlLink performing in Vegas . At her age.   In :  urlLink The La.com blog's blind items , to wit:  "If a newsmaking relationship between two fine-looking famous names stars implodes with warp speed, you can bet your bottom Dolly the old green-eyed monster caused the split. See, the male member (you should pardon the expression), whose career isn’t exactly going places these days, is mad jealous -- and so suspicious of his hot mama, he demands that she carry a Blackberry, cell phone and pager at all times so he can check on her whereabouts. As if that weren’t wacky enough, he insists that her appointment schedule be faxed to him daily. Now he’s even secretly hired private goons (mostly his out-of-work actor and musician friends) to tail her wherever she goes. The other afternoon, while she was getting waxed, massaged and pampered at that low-profile, celebrity-studded spa, Mr. Insecure phoned and beeped her so many times, the management ordered her to switch off her toys or hit the road. Have you guessed the punchline to this sickly obsessive tale? That’s right, the suspicious dude is actually the one who’s cheating, with an up-and-coming singer/actress."

       Entourage versus Entourage: P Diddy v Jesus   As I noted in the past, entourages have had a  risorgimento .  The Corsair  would like to compare and contrast two of the more influential entourages in the past, oh, say, two millennia or so, namely:  urlLink P Diddy's  and  urlLink Jesus Christ's .   Violence? Both entourages have caused a ruckus at one time or another.  urlLink P Diddy's entourage poked NY Times Boldface columnist Joyce Wadler in the ribs . That's pretty roughneck, but JC has P Diddy beat:  urlLink Peter, one of the leaders of Christ's entourage, sliced off the ear of Roman soldier Malchus  -- and  JC healed him ! Cause Jesus is cool.  VIPs? JC has got P Diddy beat again. It goes without saying that P Diddy bestrides the earth on CP time, and is it well known that he basically unhooks any velvet rope that bars entry for him and his crew into whatever VIP event. He's old school like that. The velvet rope is not an impediment to having his drink on,  fa sure, nah mean ? That's cool: but JC is cooler. Pearly gates? No problem.  urlLink JC can get his entourage into the most exclusive club of them all:   heaven !  And, finally: Influence? Well, P Diddy's entourage is blazing with bling-bling, up and coming rappers, publicists and beefy former bouncers. But what about the future? What do these guys do after the gravy train dries up? Quite possibly 3 to 5 in Sing Sing. ( Kidding.  Can''t you guys take a joke about The Diddy? Sheesh.)    Anyhoo:  The influence of JCs crew goes as far and wide as sub-saharan Africa, Central and South America and Western civilization, through the  urlLink Early desert fathers , through the  urlLink scholastic monks  of the Medieval era, to the Roman Catholic Church, to the Protestants up to today's Evangelicals.   So,  The Corsair  concludes that Jesus of Nazereth had a cooler entourage than the  P, I double D.  Respect.

       Esquire Magazine: Sex and Violence    urlLink Lloyd Grove's Lowdown , which is really bringing out the competitive edge in the tabloid wars, brings up the subject of Esky, that seemingly innocuous men's magazine that most of the chattering class believe went defunct in the Clinton era:  "Comic novelist  Christopher Buckley , in a former life the managing editor of Esquire magazine, is not a fan of the current Esquire, edited by  David Granger .  "'I picked up Esquire not too long ago, and I was just appalled,' Buckley, an old friend of mine and today the editor of Forbes FYI, tells the latest  urlLink Doublethink magazine . 'I opened it at random to a sex column, and I won't even quote what was being discussed. It was something out of Sex and the City."  "Buckley rages on: 'This was the magazine I started at. It was founded by Arnold Gingrich, edited by Harold Hayes, for which Tom Wolfe and Gay Talese had written their seminal pieces. And it's become a t-t book.'"  Well, I have issues with Esky as well, but not because it is becoming a tit book. In the July 2004 edition they have a feature called "Five Minute Guide to Surviving Anything," by James kendall and Anya Strzmien, about how to survive nightmare scenarios. Very alpha male, this feature. And:  It is morbid  like "all get out."  Under  Lightning , it says, "Avoid." Gee. Thanks, Esky.  Under  A Falling Elevator , it says, "Jumping at the last second? Not a chance."   Fuck . That was my strategy to a tee. It goes on, depressingly:  "Lie flat on your stomach with your mouth open and your head on your hands. This way your spine's off the floor, and when you're rendered unconscious, you'll breathe a bit better. Anything soft you can put underneath your body will be beneficial, but this is going to happen pretty fast."  Gee, thanks dude, but something about that "WHEN you're rendered unconscious" statement just strikes me as, well, it strikes me as a tad  pessimistic . Can't we change it to, "IF you're rendered unconscious," or something? That would be pleasant.  Under the unfortunate category, " A Bullet to the Gut ," they write:  "Lie down on your back and elevate your legs about six inches."  Now, let's say you get into a little  frisson  with  urlLink the Netas . You get the proverbial "bullet to the gut." It's not a good time for you, you're coming from an angry place just about then. At what point during the massive blood flow and girl-like squeals for help do you find the quiet time to "stop, drop, and do some hatha yoga." They go on, failing to catch the irony:  "Use a coat or blanket to keep your body temperature up. Minimize movement. If you can't breathe, sit up slightly, resting your elbows. There's nothing you can do to stop internal bleeding, but if you sit or stand up, gravity's going to make your blood pour right out."   The Corsair  contemplates the mystery of people who subscribe to Esquire Magazine  And, finally, under  "An Alligator Attack":    "If a big alligator wants you,"   The Corsair  shivers  "If a big alligator wants you, it probably won't let go. Hit it in the eyes and nose. When it starts rolling and shaking, that's when your in trouble."  What the fuck?! At that point -- the point of "rolling and shaking" in the maws of the beast --  that's  when I know I'm in trouble?! As if the moment an alligator started chasing me,  It was all Swayze .  To paraphrase Dorothy Parker, Christopher Buckley is right, Esquire should not be tossed aside lightly,  it should be thrown with great force .

       Jemima and Imran Khan Split Up: Jet Set in Chaos   First the death of  urlLink Egon Von Furstenberg , now this. Lord, I implore thee (sips from Cutty Sark), spare the jet set any more pain! Jet set poster couple Imran and Jemima Khan have said their goodbyes,  urlLink according to Hello! :  "British socialite  Jemima Khan  has split up from her husband, cricketer-turned-politician  Imran Khan , nine years after their 1995 wedding."  A translucent tear gently, aristocratically glides down  The Corsair's  fuzzy cheek, like a sailboat navigating the breakers of the Tyrranean Sea.  "A spokesperson for the political party which Imran founded in Pakistan said, 'Imran and Jemima have ended their marriage.' The comment came just two months after Imran quashed rumours that the marriage was in trouble and insisted that Jemima was simply studying in Britain but would be returning to Pakistan after completing her degree."   The Corsair  lowers his head bangs his keyboard and mouths the words: 'Why'?  "Jemima's move back to London from Lahore last year with the couple's two young boys,  Suleiman  and  Qassim , had caused speculation about state of their marriage.  "Once back in the UK, she was able to take up her studies again and to renew the kind of social life which she had always enjoyed as the daughter of the late billionaire tycoon James Goldsmith."   The Corsair  pours himself a stiff double shot of  Cutty Sark  looking longingly at the screen.   "While Imran pursued his political ambitions, he was frequently absent from family life and it was noted that he did not appear for Jemima's 30th birthday earlier this year."   The Corsair  knocks back the shot lightening fast.  "Last month, Imran's former girlfriend Sita White died in Los Angeles at the age of 43, leaving their 12-year-old daughter  Tyrian  apparently to his care. But it has since emerged that she made a change to her will shortly before her untimely death, specifying that Tyrian should be left in Jemima's custody, not Imran's.  "Tyrian had spent her summer holidays with Jemima and the boys in London after the two women struck up an email friendship three years ago. It appears that Sita preferred her daughter not to be brought up in Pakistan."  " Non omnia vincit amor,  " says the Corsair as he stares distractedly into the sunset.

       Christina Aguilera Hits the Jackpot   Christina Aguilera,  urlLink according to the 3AM Girls , plans to make some serious scratch overseas doing promotional work. A source tells them:  "'Christina doesn't need to do any promotional work as she's probably the hottest singer around right now. She receives dozens of requests each week but turns the majority of them down flat.'"   The Corsair  sniffs.  "Even so, the opportunity to follow stars such as  Pierce Brosnan ,  Sophia Loren ,  Victoria Beckham  ... by opening the Knightsbridge store's summer sale was too good to resist.  "'Christina will be receiving ($366,199) for her duties, which include cutting the ribbon, making a welcome speech and attending a VIP breakfast with Harrods executives,' our informer reveals."  The Corsair slowly munches unsalted popcorn, fascinated:  "'She'll be in London for two days but her official duties will take no more than two hours.' And while ($183,099) an hour to schmooze with Harrods boss  urlLink Mohammed Al Fayed  may seem good money, Christina still wants more.  "'She's requested that a private jet be sent to pick her up from her home in California,' adds our source.  "And the diva demands don't stop there. 'She has to stay in a penthouse - she doesn't really care where it is as long as it's five-star quality.'  "'Christina has also asked for 10 bottles of room-temperature mineral water, which can be any brand except Evian.'"  Below are the other perks XTina requested, and remember: The Cheese  must not contain canola oil :  -Private jet to and from her home in California.   -Luxury penthouse - must be five-star quality.   -Personal tour of Harrods store bargains before public are let in.   -Ten bottles of room temperature bottled water - any brand except Evian.   -Full-fat soy milk and cheese (must not contain canola oil, barley, oats or malt of any kind).   -Pottery coffee mugs - not plastic - with a selection of fruit teas.   -Platter of organic fresh fruit.   -Several bottles of vodka.   -Veuve Clicquot champagne - must be non-vintage.   -Several bottles of wine of specific grape varieties.

       The Veepstakes Reaches Fever Pitch    urlLink TheDrudgereport declares today , joyously, "Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, favors John Edwards for the second slot on the party's presidential ticket, tops sources tell the DRUDGE REPORT.  "In recent days, McAuliffe, who initially favored Edwards for the second slot in 2000, has been confiding in associates how the North Carolina senator is the strongest contender to lift Kerry to complete victory in the fall."  While this will probably exert mild pressure on the moribund Kerry campaign ( The Corsair  yawns) to make a decision, like --  urlLink shnell , we cannot fail to note what the excellent  urlLink Page Six reported recently :  "WE weren't totally accurate in predicting three months ago that Sen. John Kerry would dump Terry McAuliffe as chairman of the Democratic National Committee. McAuliffe continues to hold the title. But sources say Kerry has installed John Sasso, a loyalist from Boston, as his key man at the DNC. 'No checks are written until Sasso signs off. No decisions are made until Sasso says so,' said one Democrat. 'Terry McAuliffe was told to take it, or take a hike. And he's taking it.' McAuliffe, a multimillionaire from Syracuse, was hand-picked by Bill Clinton and has remained under the influence of Sen. Hillary Clinton. Sasso was a top advisor to Michael Dukakis and then a lobbyist in Beantown. 'He is totally loyal to Kerry,' said our source."  So, McAuliffe can only exert mild but not crucial force on the party. As a countervailing force, however,  urlLink Hans Nichols of the Hill today reports , "longtime loyalists of Rep. Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.) are whipping up signatures on their own letter to Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), urging the presumptive Democratic nominee to choose the former minority leader as his vice-presidential candidate.  "Drafted in response to a secretive letter by 22 supporters of Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.), the Gephardt partisans said they wanted to show the Kerry campaign of GephardtÂ?s deep support among a cross-section of his House colleagues.  "Late last week, Reps. Gene Green (D-Texas) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) wrote separate letters to the Kerry campaign and then took them to the floor to gather signatures in support of their onetime leader."   Fuck . This cannot be good. A Midwest strategy is flawed: labor is not as powerful as it once was -- look at how Kerry and Edwards punked out the labor-supported Dean and Gephardt in Iowa. Labor -- as a political lobby -- is in decline. That having been said, I have to give the edge right now to  urlLink Gephardt , who is a good man, but a magnum of chloroform. Just typing his name made me sleepy. And the Kerry campaign is, to borrow from Michiko Kakutani, "sloppy, self-indulgent and eye-crossingly dull." Gephardt is an honest decent man, but he is not the man Kerry needs. Kerry himself is, next to Al Gore, one of the worst Democratic campaigners. he needs a fireball, and Edwards is that fireball.  I give the edge to labor darling Gephardt, however, because  of the union problems that could proveembarrassingg at the Democratic convention in Boston, as  urlLink the Globe says :  "It is a scene out of old Boston, old labor, old politics. You can smell the cigar smoke, even though no one is actually smoking one. You can imagine the leg-breaking, even if none actually takes place. It is the kind of old-fashioned, old-style labor politics that turns off young and independent voters. Could the timing be worse? At the very moment the nation is celebrating the memory of a president who stared down labor in the form of air traffic controllers, Democrats are celebrating union thugs?  "The stand-off between the Boston Police Patrolmen's Association and the City of Boston is not just a problem for Menino. It is a microcosm of a larger problem for Democrats. It showcases their longstanding genuflection to labor, no matter how bad labor makes the party look."   urlLink Gephardt could be  a concession to the labor bosses to stand down.  Still,  urlLink the Veepstakes is hott , especially considering the  urlLink new USA Today editorial to axe Cheney  in favor of the usual suspects -- Giuliani, Powell and McCain (hot damn, would a McCain Veep candidacy fuck up John Kerry's universe in generalandd the Democratic southwest strategy specifically).

       Corsair Exclusive: The Corsair Interviews New Jersey   After several frustrated attempts, we were finally granted this important historical moment. So, without further ado, we proudly present for the first time: a electronic interview with The State of New Jersey:   The Corsair : So pleased to meet you. Thank you for talking to me. Buon Giorno.   NJ : Yeah, hey,  urlLink Bon Jovi to you too, kid.    urlLink New Jersey : Were the directions adequate?   The Corsair :  Quite . You told me to turn at the smokestack.   NJ : Right. To get to Jersey, just turn at the smokestack. It's a no brainer.   The Corsair : (Awkward silence)  So  ... how about  urlLink the environment ?   NJ : (All Aggro) Is that supposed to be a crack?   The Corsair : (Frightened) No,  no  ... don't be so defensive, New Jersey. You have a lot to be proud of.   NJ :  Damn right I do . Atlantic City. Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown.  urlLink Mike Tyson . Princeton.  urlLink The Bruce .   The Corsair : (Confused) Willis or Springsteen?   NJ : --Why I oughta ...   The Corsair : Are you going to vote Republican or Democrat this election. Will you leave the blue state category? This is what  urlLink political wonks are talking about .   NJ : (Proudly) Everyone wants ta know.    The Corsair : So?   NJ : (Righteously) Let me tell you a little about myself. I have always been in the long shadows of New York. They became the media capitol, and I became the ugly red headed stepchild. It was a callow youth.   The Corsair : Shall I play a violin cadenza?   NJ : --Why I oughta ...!   The Corsair : But you are leaning towards Bush, no?   NJ : Regaining composure) Yes, We are. Too long have we been in the shadows of New York. We have had  urlLink misfortunes . We are raring for revolt. John Kerry better not take us for granted.   The Corsair : Thanks for talking to me.   NJ : (Full of New Jersey sarcasm) Sure thing, buttercup.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  Republican Scandals . Nipping on the heels of Republican governor Rowland's resignation, like a Spaniel in search of a robust head rubbing, Republican  urlLink Senate nominee Jack Ryan of Illinois  is reeling from a mini (read: "non") scandal of his own, according to  urlLink the Chicago Tribune  (link via  urlLink Wonkette ):  "Republican U.S. Senate nominee Jack Ryan's ex-wife,  urlLink TV actress Jeri Ryan , accused him of taking her to sex clubs in New York and Paris, where he tried to coerce her into having sex with him in front of strangers, according to records released Monday from the couple's California divorce file."   urlLink Jeri Ryan  played  Seven of Nine  on the Star Trek series, so, if I were a  urlLink Machiavellian   Dick Morris  type, I'd be trying to spin this as a positive for the geek set. Hard to feel sorry for that ass, though, as  urlLink Ryan has had operatives stalking his opponent , State Senator Obama, with a digital camera, in search of some scandalous footage. Karmic repercussions are a bitch, no?    Fuck : Breaking News:  urlLink TheSmokingGun has already posted  their divorce papers. Shit, didn't Kierkegaard predict that  urlLink the media in a democracy  would turn out like this?    Out :  urlLink Britney Spears . As if it isn't bad enough that she has had knee surgery, her mom ran over a stalkerazzi. Mowed his ass down.  Ka-Pow!  The Sun reports:  "The panic-stricken singer sat in the car screaming and crying after the accident.   "Mascara running down her cheeks, she screamed: 'Oh no, oh no. Mom, Mom,' after her mother Lynne, who was driving the hulking motor, ploughed into the photographer."  But to  urlLink look at the photographs  of the incident, the photographer  urlLink doesn't really look that hurt . He's kind of lounging. Cold lounging, actually, with only a faint touch of scowl about the lips, he appears to be a man secure in the knowledge that he will soon be a very rich man.    In :  urlLink Interracial-Interreligious love  (link via  urlLink Wonkette ). New celebrity couple Richard Gere and Al Sharpton got lost in the oceans of each others eyes. Who needs  urlLink alleged billionaire supermodel Cindy Crawford  when you've got the Rev. Al,  urlLink a saucy leftist Christian preacher ; and Richard's a Tibetan Buddhist, though he used to be  urlLink just a gigolo . But "love" conquers all.  urlLink You go, guys .   Out : According to the soon to be Conde Nast imprint  urlLink Kerrang! Magazine  (via  urlLink Ananova ) -- (averted gaze),  Sharon Osbourne  is the most important person in rock. The Devil is the second most important in rock,  "because the devil has all the best tunes" (But,  The Corsair  notes, "God gave Rock and roll to everyone". And  Justin Hawkins  of The Darkness is fourth for 'single-handedly putting the fun back into rock.' Any list including Justin Hawkins is  definitely not  an inclusion meriting boastfulness.   In : Celebrity pregnancy.  urlLink People Magazine  (link via  urlLink Ananova ) is reporting that  Liv Tyler  and  Royston Langdon  are preggers. The celebrity fertility trend continues apace.  And now,  urlLink A Fly on the Wall Blog  (link via  urlLink Defamer ) hints that Demi might also be knocked up:  "Demi Moore has told her agents at CAA that she thinks she's pregnant, according to a Fly spy inside the agency.   "Moore recently quit smoking, and reportedly told several friends she had done so because she was trying to have another child.   "Demi's boytoy Ashton Kutcher is said to be the father. No word yet if they'll marry to save the child from bastardy."    Out : The Madonna ticket strategy, according to perennial Corsair favorite  urlLink Michael Musto , "... And here's why the MADONNA, I mean Madge, I mean Esther, concerts supposedly had so many empty seats till the last minute: Flacks hyped it as 'sold out' from day one! You figured, 'Why bother even calling for tickets?' (That's one theory.)" It sounds just about right to me.   In : That significant cultural artifact, Star Magazine,  urlLink interviews J.O. Batton , "Unlike last season, when (Paris and Nicole) bunked on the Leding family porch, the girls shared a spare bedroom in the cozy home that Batton shares with his 26-year-old son Travis and daughter-in-law Aimee. Everyone shared one bathroom. Cowboy Batten, 57, clearly enjoyed his time with the girls, who even talked him into trying on his chaps with nothing on underneath: 'I'm in pretty good shape,' he says. 'We were discussing my tight buns. They liked 'em.' Here's how J.O. rates his houseguests, from 1 (dreadful) to 10 (dynamite):  " 7  STRENGTH  "It didn't look like they could lift a 50-pound feed bag."   The Corsair  softly chuckles  " 3  PAIN TOLERANCE  "Paris' is very, very low. Nicole didn't do anything to get hurt."  " 8  INTELLIGENCE  "Neither one of them is dumb. Both are relatively intelligent girls."  Yes, and relatively speaking, J.O.'s observations on the life of the mind are, well -- not quite  urlLink Seth Benardete  material. Check out the  urlLink J.O.'s other ratings , relatively speaking, of course.    In :  urlLink Defamer Sightings :  "... Lunching at Orso in walks  urlLink Larry King  meeting his much younger and  urlLink very blonde wife  and a random young guy  couldn't tell if he was wearing any diapers under his Paper Denim and Cloth jeans which look so out of place on a man in his 70s but hey  urlLink I guess he can do whatever he wants . He also looked very very thin.   "... Next to his table was  urlLink Morgan Fairchild  dining with a female friend. Morgan was fully done up with her white blonde hair and pale face makeup she was there for a while she made eye contact with me several times like she was bored with her lunch date and was seeing what everyone else was doing.   "... was grocery shopping at pavilions in west hollywood and in front of me in line was e!'s gossip columnist  urlLink Ted Casablanca . it looked as though ted-babe had just come from the gym. he was wearing a loose scoop necked tank top baggy shorts. he had grey chest hair and under developed calves. he was buying among other things, tins of cat food, a bag of kitty litter and sensodyne toothpaste which I assume is for him, not his cat."  Too funny, but, to be honest, Hollywood doesn't seem as glamorous after reading the  urlLink defamer sightings . Then again, that's the purpose.   Out :  urlLink Al Quaeda , obsessed with degrading the miracle of human life into meat, beheaded the South Korean captive today,  urlLink reports the AP :  "An Iraqi militant group has beheaded its South Korean hostage, Al-Jazeera television reported Tuesday.  "The pan-Arab station said it had received a videotape showing that Kim Sun-il had been executed.  "Kim, 33, worked for a South Korean company supplying the U.S. military in Iraq and was abducted last week, according to the South Korean government.  "Al-Jazeera, which had not broadcast the tape, said the execution was carried out by the al-Qaida-linked group Monotheism and Jihad."  This will be a nightmare for  urlLink US-South Korean relations  which, recently, have been strained over US military and diplomatic heavy handedness to the neighboring North Korean regime. As  urlLink the Christian Science Monitor notes :  "... Such ambivalence reflects widespread uncertainty here at a time when the (South Korean) government is pursuing reconciliation with North Korea against pressure from conservatives who see little if any sign of concessions or progress in negotiations. The result is that South Koreans, from student demonstrators to government advisers, send mixed signals that reflect deep disagreement on how to deal with the US alliance as well as North Korea.  "'It is a very complex issue,' says Kim Tae Woo. 'The official statements are very simple. They are saying this is due to a global plan and there should be no security vacuum on the Korean peninsula.'  "Mr. Kim concedes the validity of that argument but also believes the US decision to scale back here is 'in response to the anti-American movement'"  That movement will draw steam from the beheading. Although the United States offered South Korea an $11 billion bribe to "strengthen defenses" against North Korea, the US has downsized troop strength in the DMZ to fortify Iraq and Afghanistan in the War on terror. Watch to see how South Korean internal opinion reacts to this tragic news carefully, dear readers.   In :  Marc Jacobs ,  urlLink according to Fashionweekdaily :  "Marc Jacobs, firmly in the creative driving seat at Louis Vuitton, will be launching a new jewelry line this fall, inspired by the charm bracelets he created for the last several Vuitton ready-to-wear runway shows.    " Yves Carcelle , President of Louis Vuitton, confirmed the news today in Milan.  "'We will put a complete line of jewelry on the market by September,' announced Carcelle, who was in town to celebrate the opening of Louis Vuittons shiny new boutique in the citys historic Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II."

       Dan Rather IS The Anchorman    urlLink Dan Rather  was categorically unequipped to ask probing psychological questions of the former President mainly because his own subconscious is such a menacing, unprobed void ("What's the frequency, Kenneth,"  The Corsair  shivers).  You just know  urlLink Oprah will do better  on excavating Clinton's psychological  urlLink subterranean cairns  and all the McNugget sized secrets that lie therein.  Plus, Oprah's black , and so will be better able to relate to him.  urlLink It's a black thing .   Anyhoo : Rather stuck to the sexy but shallow questions, veering slightly, if only for a moment, into Clinton's childhood and briefly into foreign policy initiatives, but always --  always  -- returning like a terrier in search of a dog yummy,  back to Lewinsky .  There was a very funny moment, though,  urlLink which Wonkette caught  with her jeweler's eye, about Clinton's handshaking skillz (Complicated Handshakes? Come on, in your heart-of-hearts  urlLink you know Clinton's black ):  "CLINTON: Tony Lake, my National Security Adviser, has a wonderful sense of humor, says, well, I know how to do this. Well, now you be Arafat and I will be you and you try to kiss me. And I'll show you what do ...  "RATHER: I'm not sure I want to do this.  "CLINTON:So, I shook hands ... and he put his hand like this, in my elbow. And he says, 'If you've got your hand in your elbow, he can't kiss you.   "Presumably, the White House staffer who was supposed to teach this trick to interns fell down on the job."  This exchange reminded me of one between  urlLink Mike Wallace of 60 Minutes and Yassir Arafat  (second story from top), who, clearly, gives off some problematic homoerotic vibes to Wallace:  "Wallace: Four out of five Palestinians in a recent poll, 83 percent actually, said they believe that the Palestinian Authority is corrupt; that there is money that has been stolen consistently, that your people. I mean, look. Around here, they have money, they have jobs, they have cars. The Palestinians who live out here in Ramallah, where the unemployment is 36 percent, and down in Gaza, where it's 48 percent, they don't live the way that you do. Its a comfortable life for you and your colleagues.  "Arafat: Do you want to see my bedroom?  "Wallace: Do I wanna see your bedroom?  "Arafat: Yes.  "Wallace: I, I'm not sure that I understand the invitation."  I'm not sure that I want to understand the invitation, or contemplate the visual.  Channeling his  urlLink inner Ron Burgundy , Dan Rather, ran through  urlLink the Tina Brown gauntlet  on CNBC afterwards. Tina commented rather sweetly on  urlLink Gawker.com's Henry the Intern , who, incidentally, said of the interview:  "In a blatant attempt for a slice of '60 Minutes' viewers, Tina milked Dan Rather for a postscript to his hyped interview with Bill Clinton (Old trick: Interview the interviewer when you can't get the interviewee). 'Dan,' she began, 'It's wonderful to be visiting with you. . . How did you find that he's changed?' Rather: 'He's much more within himself, searching for answers about himself.' Tina: 'More interior?' Rather: 'Yes. . . [he's] trying very hard to be insightful about himself.'   "It got better. That is, if you wanted to know the dimensions of Bill's biceps. Tina said Clinton followed the South Beach Diet. Rather: 'He's buffed up.' Tina pressed: 'Does he have a gym in that house in Chappaqua?' Rather: 'Yes. . . It's not large, but it's quite complete. . . I counted at least 13 barbells.'"  Frankly, Tina got a more incisive interview of Clinton by torturing out editing floor clips from Dan Rather than The Anchorman did in his own sit down with the former President, especially this tidbit:  "Rather: The first person (Bill Clinton) talked to after the interview was the Senator from New York."  Oprah, Tina, anyone but  urlLink Dan Rather, The Anchorman . BTW: Tina will be on vacation in London next week ( urlLink not Quogue, or Venice ).  urlLink Arianna Huffington  will take her place.  urlLink According to Page Six : "... Tina Brown is taking a week off from her CNBC show (Arianna Huffington will fill in) to go to England for a week of parties in honor of her husband Harry Evans, the distinguished editor and author who is being knighted by Queen Elizabeth II."   Leave it to the hardest working man in the gossip biz,  urlLink the great Richard Johnson , to get a scoop while doing an appearance.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  urlLink New Jersey , and who would have thought it? Jersey could actually be forced into play in the 2004 election by a  disgusting  act of terrorism; it is startling how fragile democracies can be even at the zenith of their power.  urlLink Yesterday's NY Times  relayed some of the smouldering anger in this usually staid blue state:  "There are the flowers and the crosses, the notes and the photographs and all the other signs of sympathy and grieving that one would expect to find at an impromptu shrine devoted to someone murdered in a most cruel fashion.  "But one day after graphic photographs of the body of Paul M. Johnson Jr., beheaded by Islamic extremists, were beamed around the world, a new sign appeared in the yard next to the house of Mr. Johnson's sister in Little Egg Harbor Township.  "'Last night my heart was filled with love and prayers, but today it is filled with hatred. Last night I was not a racist, but today I feel racism toward Islamic beliefs,' the sign said. 'Last night Islamics had a chance to speak up for Paul Johnson, but today it was too late,' it also said. 'Today Islamics better wake up and start thinking about tomorrow.'"  The chilling article  urlLink By Jason George and Marc Santora  continues:  "... Some neighbors did not hide their anger, saying privately that blood should be met with blood."  Will this sad, horrible act of terrorism factor into  urlLink New Jersey becoming a swing state ? Can the Muslim fundamentalist cast that much influence?   Out :  urlLink Governor Rowland . Oh, how we will miss  urlLink horsewhipping corrupt Connecticut Governor Rowlands . It was  urlLink shadenfreude at it's finest . As  urlLink the NY Times says :  "Gov. John G. Rowland will announce his resignation Monday night, amid a federal corruption investigation and a growing move to impeach him, his lawyer told The Associated Press."  Goodbye,  urlLink Old Paint .   In :  urlLink Free Winona . Sure, Winona may have a " urlLink Big Brown Beaver  vintage  urlLink muff  under her skirt that she's hiding from store security (kidding, guys,  kidding ). But, according to  urlLink British Vogue , "WINONA RYDER has had her sentenced reduced after being convicted of stealing ($9,184) of designer clothes and accessories from Saks Fifth Avenue in 2002."   And we can't be happier for  urlLink Ms. Horowitz .     Out : According to  urlLink the most excellent Page Six , Dayanara Torres hasn't yet told her kids that their father is married to another woman:  "MARC Anthony's ex-wife, former Miss Universe  Dayanara Torres , still hasn't told their children their dad has married serial bride Jennifer Lopez. The two boys don't even know their parents are divorced. 'They don't know much really, because  Ryan  is just a baby and  Christian  hasn't noticed,' Torres tells the upcoming issue of Latina. 'Until now, I've just kept Christian away from everything — from TV, from pictures.' If J.Lo's latest marriage is anything like her last two, it may be over before her new stepkids ever hear about it."  Now, this is especially odd considering what  urlLink CNN.com reported  earler this month:  "Saying his personal life is off-limits, singer Marc Anthony refused to confirm Tuesday whether he's married to Jennifer Lopez."  "During an appearance on NBC's 'Today' show, co-host  Matt Lauer  asked the Latin singer how he'd spent his weekend.  "'I see where you're going with this, and I'm going to preface it with just saying -- y'all know I don't talk about my personal life,' Anthony said.  "Lauer replied: 'So, I -- do I need to congratulate you?'  "'Yeah, I have two albums coming out, man. Absolutely. And I would appreciate it,' the 34-year-old singer said."   What the fuck?!    Out:   Robbie Wiiliams' depression . According to  urlLink the 3AM Girls :  "He's been battling depression for ages but things seem to be getting even worse for Robbie Williams.  "He is now so terrified of being alone that he insists on having a minder sleep at the bottom of his bed every night.  "It may sound strange for a man of 30 years, but a worried friend tells us: "Rob just can't seem to stop feeling so down.  "'He won't sleep in a room unless there is security there, so some poor chap has to kip on the sofa at the end of his bed.'"  They continue:  "In fact we're told the only time his bedroom minders get a night off is when Robbie brings back, ahem, lady friends. The source went on: 'Robbie needs constant company. He is surrounded by people who care about him but even they are struggling to pull him out of this depression.  "'On the surface he's got it made. He wants for nothing. But no one's ever seen him so unhappy.'"   In : The  urlLink Ingmar Bergman Film Festival  at the Film Forum. You wouldn't know it by my rapier like wit, but I am a big fan of the Big Questions that  Ingmar Bergman  asks in his films. Big fan. So, I found it particularly amusing to see in Vanessa Grigoriadis' Ethan Hawke story in  urlLink this week's New York Magazine , "A person can’t drop off his kids at his ex-wife’s and go see (Ingmar Bergman's) Fanny and Alexander, he mused." Okay, now I've never thought much of Hawke, but Bergman can make brothers of us all.   Out :  urlLink Stereogum reader Cara  has her own "out" list, taken, I guess, from  urlLink last Thursday's Franz Ferdinand concert :  "As Mr. Stereogum may be aware, I was none too pleased with the crowd at the Franz Ferdinand show last night. (1) It is NOT OK to sing along to the songs in my ear so loudly that the only music I hear comes from your shrieky and embarrasingly off-key vocals. (2) It is NOT cool to throw up the sign of the beast during "Take Me Out." We are not watching Slayer. (3) It is not OK to dance in my space. First of all, I am not crazy about dancing at concerts at all (despite Franz Ferdinand's comments that they are a dance band). If you must dance during the concert, however, please do it within the confines of the 1 x 1 foot square space you have been allotted. (4) Don't sweat on me."  Sweating on Cara? Like school on Saturday, man:  no class .    In : Gwyneth Paltrow. In the words of  urlLink Whatevs.org , "... While she'll never live down Liam's assertion that she's nothing but a gawky bird, I'll be god damned if Gwynnie isn't the cat's pajamas. holla atcha post-preggers hottness!"  Word up.   Or , as Fashionweekdaily quotes Paltrow in their  urlLink quote of the Daily , ""I'm wearing all Marc Jacobs tonight, and I was in the store in the Village the other day buying new boob-forgiving t-shirts--because I now have boobs! I never knew how fun it was to have boobs, and since they're probably temporary, I have to enjoy them while I have them."   Out :  urlLink Fashionweekdaily  also reports: "Kelly Ripa, who just signed a five-year deal with 'Live With Regis and Kelly,' has been given a $45,000 fashion allowance by ABC to indulge her Jimmy Choo weakness ..."  We are so playa hating.

       Happy Fourth of July    The Corsair  loves the slow quiet roar of fireworks on a sultry July night. The picnic in the grass. The celebration of America's victory of Imperial Britain. Happy 4th, true believers, see you back here on Monday the 5th, same bat time, same bat channel.  Ron  5/6: I took an extra day off to recharge the batteries, but am back and jumping for joy at Edwards.

       The Veepstakes: Finalists   And then there were four, at least according to  urlLink The Boston Globe :  "John F. Kerry spent yesterday in isolation at his wife's 90-acre suburban farm, working on his convention acceptance speech amid signs that the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee may announce his choice of a running mate here as early as next Tuesday.    "Kerry's public campaign schedule has been disclosed only through Monday, the day after he wraps up a Fourth of July bus tour through the Midwest and then flies back to Pittsburgh. His staff has assembled the telephone numbers and schedules next week for potential running mates, said a top adviser to one of the candidates. Kerry has asked a select few of his closest supporters to reserve Tuesday and Wednesday to travel with the campaign, which would allow for a barnstorming tour by the Democratic duo in advance of a gala fund-raiser next Thursday in New York City.  "'We're hearing it's going to be Tuesday,' said the adviser, who spoke on the condition that neither he nor his boss be identified.  "Speculation has focused on three candidates -- Iowa Governor  urlLink Tom Vilsack , US Representative  urlLink Richard A. Gephardt  of Missouri, and  urlLink Senator John Edwards of North Carolina  -- but Kerry has limited all concrete information about his search to a tight circle that includes his wife,  Teresa Heinz Kerry , and  James A. Johnson , the Washington banker heading his search committee. In recent days, Vilsack has been the focus of a media boomlet, but Kerry aides say other candidates including  urlLink US Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr.  of Delaware and former senator  urlLink Sam Nunn of Georgia  remain possible choices."  Okay, first of all, it will not be Tom Vilsack. You can be sure that when you wake up on Tuesday, the media will not be all Vilsack all the time. Kerry owes Vilsack big time, and that is why he keeps his name on the short list, pumping up his name recognition -- a freebie. If  urlLink Vilsack and his wife, Christy , hadn't gone out of their way in endorsing Kerry, he would not have won Iowa and slingshotted (Ka-Pow!) into New Hampshire.   Sam Nunn is too dark a choice. Nunn fairly reeks of gunpowder. He would be a fine choice to get moderates and swing voters, but he is way too fucking conservative; his whole life has been around military aircraft and weaponry and the defense industry. Although that may make people sleep soundly in, oh, say, bumfuck Kentucky, this is the Democratic Party we are talking about, a party that will be struggling with Nader votes. And Nunn has been on the head of rather dodgy Boards of Directors, swimming in the trough of special interest backwash. So, while he projects a very "defense industry competent" Dick Cheney-esque vibe, he probably wouldn't even win his own home state Georgia for Kerry. Plus he is boring as watching  urlLink a plant produce oxygen . A debate with Dick Cheney (I know, I know, he will declare heart problems in about a month only to be replaced by either McCain, Giuliani or Powell) would induce a deep, deep slumber throughout the nation.  And Joe Biden is a very smug guy. He's been in the Senate so long that he has developed an off-putting and rather annoying sense of entitlement. He argues with a smile, but there are daggers in his eye. And it all sounds so phony. His temperament is not equipped for the job. Plus he has the worst comb-over on K Street.  Here's what I have said in the past of  urlLink the others  (I think it goes down to Geph or Edwards):  Ever since  urlLink NBC News Chief Foreign Affairs Correspondent Andrea Mitchell , a graduate student in power, the wife of Fed Reserve Chief  Allan Greenspan , suggested that  urlLink Hillary Clinton wants the veep slot , it has been hers to lose.   "The problem with Hillary, and there are quite a few, but let me distill the argument against her, is that she doesn't bring much to the ticket and she polarizes her opposition like no one on the radar. Of course, she is also a genuine celebrity beloved like a goddess among African-American, Latino and Asian women. And she's a two-fer: get her and her husband comes along cheap. But Kerry already does well with women; he married a tough one, and that attracts the ladies -- a man unafraid of a strong woman -- like nothing in this world. Women like men who like alpha-women, just look at Bill Clinton's numbers among women even after he cheated.  Kerry will win New York. Kerry will win the Northeast ( urlLink although New Jersey, surprisingly, is looking like it is in play , thanks to the charismatically challenged  urlLink Governor, McGreevey ). In a sense, Hillary would have been  much more useful  to the ticket had she run for the Senate seat in Arkansas, where a Southern base would mark her head and shoulders above the sunny and optimistic bright Senator  John Edwards , which, quite frankly, she is not. The problem with Hillary is that she was too tepid,  she didn't run ; Edwards did -- and thus, among many, he should get the nod,  it's his turn ; Edwards took the risk. But mark my words: If Hillary had won a Senate seat in the less tony and prestigious Arkansas, she would already be Kerry's Veep pick, cric crossing the nation, playing the heavy, being the pit bull to Kerry's "Presidential"-toned listening tour.    John Edwards : The likely pick. Pro: Electoral College votes; he has em. A bombshell convention speech in Prime time to show off his looks, his charm, his charisma. All about taking back the South. Will Kerry go for the Southern strategy, or the Midwestern (read: Gephardt), that is the question. A player in the party to come.  50-50  Plus, apropos of nothing, Edwards is a Gemini, and a Gemini along with a Sagittarius Kerry, would be spectacular ( okay , now you can discount all my other analysis because I mentioned astrology)   urlLink Max Cleland .  The Corsair  believes that he is the likely choice for a running mate.  Pros:  From Georgia, brings the South back into the mix ... former Senator ... triple amutee war hero would make a strong veterans campaign with Kerry --  and Vets are likely Republican voters  ... Expert on Homeland Security (big plus, as national security is a Republican stronghold) which Bill Clinton in a closed door meeting warned that the nominee must be strong on ... Strong on health care ... Could humiliate chicken hawk Cheney in a debate  Cons : Health might be an issue. ( ed note: Feb 14, 2004 : it's a fucking long ass sojourn through the country for a Veep, from Labor Day till the election -- can Cleland do it? I think so.  Odds on favorite )   urlLink Gary Hart  This is not going to happen, but bear with me I just like Hart and want to rant and rave for a bit.  Pros : Vast intellect, PhD, Oxford, Political Philosophy ... Wise from his time out in the political wilderness ... Strong in the Southwest ... Devastating debater  Cons : Old adultery charge may still stick in the Bible Belt ... May be more useful to the Democratic Party in a Senate bid against the very weak  Ben Knighthorse Campbell  ( note : Campbell  will not  seek reelection) ... Possible  Secretary of State , a la his hero, Jefferson ( ed note: Feb 14, 2004 )   urlLink Bill Richardson  He's dropped off the radar screen. Pros: Governor of ultra-crucial New Mexico ... Latino ... former UN Ambassador and  urlLink seasoned diplomat  would give international cooperation credit points to ticket   Cons : None. He's hot like salsa, but I don't see the Southwestern strategy as being tenable as it is quite possible Bush can cockblock Kerry by picking McCain to replace a "heart sick" Cheney. Then Kerry's royally fucked in the Southwest. Too risky.   urlLink Wesley Clark  Never, ever going to happen. Pros: Longshot, but if he wins big in Oklahoma and the conservative Southwest he could be in the cut ... General would give strong military backing to ticket ... would humiliate chickenhawk Cheney in a debate ... strong with African-Americans   Cons : Too closely tied to Bill Clinton, who wants Hillary '08, which may be an issue. ( ed note: Feb 14, 2004 : Wes is bitter as the Clintonistas dumped his ass as soon as he started looking like yesterday's donuts. Could be Sec of Defense in a Kerry White House. An effective military attack dog. Will work well with a Cleland Veep)   urlLink Dick Gephardt   Pros : Outside of Cleland and Edwards, the most likely running mate ... most popular pol in pivotal swing state Missouri ... would be perfect for a Kerry-Gephardt Northern labor-veterans strategy against a Bush South ... comes with the backing of labor, a Democratic must needs ... A truly good guy who dropped out and endorsed Kerry early:  he did the right thing   Cons : Wooden on the stump,  charismatically challenged  (ed note: Feb 14, 2004: this ticket may be too damn Northern top heavy. Could be the  greatest  and  most powerful  Sec of Labor in US history in a Kerry White House)  So, in the end, Edwards or Geph, I think Edwards, but Max Cleland would be an incredible choice.  No blog tomorrow because of work commitments. Sorry.

       Spike Lee Talks ... and Talks   Is Spike Lee trying to reignite his  urlLink feud with red hot Hollywood director Quentin Tarrantino ? Does he want to start one with Queen Latifa? Who knows; Spike is in rare form though, in this cover feature with The Independent Magazine, in the July/August 2004 issue with cute editor,  urlLink Rebecca Carroll :  "(Spike) acknowledge that there have been truly independent films being made, although  urlLink Pulp Fiction , widely perceived as the film that set the independent renaissance into motion, isn't one of them.   Spike Lee: "Was ( Pulp Fiction ) really an independent film? I don't think so."  Rebecca Carroll: "Why do you think they wrote ( urlLink Barbershop ) that way?  Spike: "The movie made a lot of money. And there is  urlLink Barbershop 2 , and Latifah's spinoff,  urlLink Beauty Shop . I love Latifah, but that  urlLink Bringing Down the House  movie she did was bordering on  urlLink Aunt Jemima .  "... People don't understand that we are still putting on a minstrel show -- half these motherfucking rappers don't know that they are repeating the same history. If somebody came down from space and turned on BET, and looked at black people in music videos, they'd think it was a minstrel show."   The Corsair  agrees with the always outspoken Spike on the Latifah comment and the BET comment and not much else.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  urlLink Lorne Manley  (link via  urlLink Romenesko ). I met Lorne Manley several years ago, during the Dot Com craziness, at the offices of Inside.com. Manley struck me as your typical good natured media addict, as well as a hugely competent writer. Lorne was just named Chief Media Writer at the NY Times.  urlLink Gawker speculates  on what this may mean for David Carr, and, to be frank, The Corsair is a bit confused as well. Whatever the case,  The Corsair  offers Manley the warmest congratulations.    Out : Restaurateur/ Magazine maven,  urlLink John McDonald , according to  urlLink Fashionweek Daily ; and, speaking of  David Carr :  "The New York Times' dogged media-beat cop,  urlLink David Carr , has his sights set on a new target: restaurateur/magazine maven,  urlLink John McDonald . Insiders say Carr is digging up everything there is to know on the  urlLink boyish bar owner , who started out opening proto-hipster Soho hangouts Merc Bar and Canteen, and then branched out to launch City magazine."    In :  urlLink Fashionweedaily's aggressive  coverage of the fashion and media world's continues apace, with this chestnut on  Orly Healy's  new project:  "New York Post fashion editor,  urlLink Orla Healy , is penning a tell-all book about life inside a celebrity magazine. The former In Style deputy editor?s book?which we hear has an outline and four chapters completed, but no publisher as of yet?will dish about the total abuse and wantonness of celebrities and their I-rule-the-world ?tudes. Sources close to The Daily say the book will chronicle the demands, idiosyncrasies, and insecurities of many celebrities she worked with as a celebrity editor. When reached for comment, Healy said, 'The funny thing is that I was originally deciding between writing a murder-mystery novel and about working at a celebrity magazine.' She added, 'The book is a giggle; it?s not really meant to be a thesis about the behind-the-scenes in wrangling celebrity covers.'"   Out :  Leonardo DiCaprio , according to that significant cultural artifact  urlLink The National Enquirer ; stunning mannequin  urlLink Giselle Bundchen  -- she of the studied Sphynx like glare -- wants our favorite  urlLink oversexed Scorpio named Leo  to  urlLink stop fucking other women .  Riight  (Averted gaze). Like that's going to happen:  "The rumored engagement of  Leonardo DiCaprio , 29, and supermodel  giggle Bündchen , 23, doesn't seem to be slowing down The Aviator star's partying ways. On June 9, DiCaprio hung with actor pal  urlLink Lukas Haas  at Hollywood's Concorde nightclub, where they invited about a dozen to come to his Hollywood Hills home for a nightcap, an eyewitness says. Two days later, he hit the scene at  Prey  ( Ed Note : What a meaningful name!), another L.A. hot spot, where he again reportedly hand-picked ladies for a late night get-together around 3 a.m.  "However, the next day, he and Bündchen looked like the picture of domestic bliss as they shopped for plants in New York City. A source tells Star that the Brazilian-born model is waiting for DiCaprio to outgrow his party-monster ways."  Note to Giselle with the Ümlauts: Rich, famous, irreligious Scorpio men who are regarded as godlike on the continent of Asia tend stop partying and settle down into monogamous, bourgois behavior when they are, oh, deep into their mid to late 70s.   In : Ben Affleck was embarrassed, according to  urlLink Matt Damon in B Magazine  (link via  urlLink Ananova ):  "... (Damon) admitted that Ben found it difficult to deal with the pressure of the high profile relationship.  "'I really felt for him because if you're on the cover of a magazine, it's generally to promote a movie... He was so embarrassed.'"   Out : Washingtonienne is getting  urlLink 300 large for her book . We are so jealous, although ... er, we wouldn't want to do quite  urlLink what she did  to get the gig. I mean, aren't Americans already fucked by the Senate and the House? Why  compound  a bad situation and make it worse.   In : A propos of nothing, I have been reading  urlLink St. Augustine's Confessions  and while, no, I am not converting to Catholicism and giving up the blog,  urlLink this essay , comparing and contrasting the moral schemes of both Augustine and  urlLink Nietzsche  is really fucking interesting. I've always thought that virtually every question of morality down the line, from citizenship to the meaning of power, lies somewhere in between the philosophies of Nietzsche and Augustine, one who just touched the Middle Ages, and the other who caressed the Postmodern (we  really  must come up with a less self-consciously ironic name for Our Age, how about, after Einstein, the Age of Relativity). Forgive me for being the eternal college student, I just turned 33 and The Big Questions are assaulting me, big time; you'll understand when you turn 33.

       On The Declining Influence of the Political Conventions   "Our next task is to study coming-to-be and passing-away. We are to distinguish the causes, and to state the definitions, of these processes considered in general-as changes predicable uniformly of all the things that come-to-be and pass-away by nature." Aristotle,  urlLink On Generation and Corruption   From Niccolo's Smile, by Professor Maurizio Viroli, "Machiavelli's Discorsi Sopra la Prima Deca Di Tiudo Livio, III, 6: it concerns  Caterina Sforza Riario , a great beauty of her day and a woman Machiavelli thought of fondly, '(Some conspirators) killed Count Giordano, their lord, and took his wife and small children. Since they did not see how they could be secure if they did not become masters of the fortress, and the castellan were not willing to cede it to them, Madonna Caterina (so the Countess was called) promised the conspirators that if they let her enter it, she would deliver it over to them and they could keep the children with them as hostages. With this pledge they let her enter. As soon as she was within, she stood on the walls and berated them for the death of her husband and threatened them with every kind of revenge. And to show that she did not worry about her children, she showed them her genitals, saying she still had the means to make more of them.'"   As the television news division increasingly morphs into entertainment division (and anyone who reads this blog knows that I don't  necessarily  think that that is a bad thing), the political convention is becoming an endangered species of sorts. And  that  is unfortunate.  According to the policy wonk bible,  urlLink The Hill , and it's intrepid reporter, Geoff Earle:  "The major TV networks are planning to cut coverage at the political conventions, ignoring major speeches early in the week.   "The Republican and Democratic parties hope to nudge the networks into more live coverage, but broadcasters have concluded that there will be little news to report."  Frankly, this comes as sad news for all involved. As a child I can still remember the  urlLink Dukakis  nominating convention, where Jesse Jackson and The Duke fought it out for a surprisingly long time. the Puerto Rico delegation abstained, hoping to get around antagonizing the useful Jackson, while another state gave Duke the Democratic Party nod. Then Duke came out, looking rather constipated, in sockless shoes to affect a preppy nonchalance; sitting with his wife, benevolently accepting the favor of the Party's nod. Such was my geeky but effervescently happy childhood, bathed in High Politics and pop culture, with dashes of an as yet unevolved sense of the ancient, that I can remember such arcana as the fact that The Duke wore no socks.   But, now that hallmark of our government, the party convention, is going the way of the Dodo, or at least, CSpan, which, in effect, means a significant drop off a) to those who do not have cable, and b) those who are simply not even aware that a CSpan exists, it is not on their narrow media-deprived radar screen:  "'We know we're going to cover the nomination and the [nominee's] speech,' said one network's spokeswoman, but 'we're not sure about the first two days.'   "Previously, networks covered each day of the convention."  That's right; every snooze inducing day, every ambitious backwater Governor's speech, all -- everything in prime time. This will be a momentous sea change, heralding the inevitable day when there is no such thing as a news division anymore, only an entertainment division, which, alas, would push the big stories -- the party conventions -- into the C-Span ghetto, and, in so doing, deprive the next generation of political geeks like me, the child being born now, a solid political education.  "Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) and President Bush have already locked up their nominations, so the networks don't feel obliged to cover the four-day windup to their acceptance speeches.   "'They are very tightly choreographed events,' said the spokeswoman. 'There is virtually no news that is made at the conventions any more.'"  No hard news, correct, and tightly choreographed, also yes, but many, many great American moments arise from these conventions: Bill Clinton's longwinded speech at the '88 convention. It was so boring and overdone that when Clinton said, "In conclusion ..." the whole hall erupted in cheers. Who could have fucking predicted that this backwater Machiavel would come back, using the momentum of being a punchline, into the Presidency?  Priceless .    urlLink Pat Buchanan's fire  and brimstone speech, exposing the reptilian underbelly of the paleoconservative America First movement that emerged from the ashes of The Cold War. The speech that sunk  urlLink the last WWII generation president . John F Kennedy Junior entered public life speaking at the Convention in Atlanta in '88, so young, so fresh faces, and now, alas, forever lost to the us, a possible future President.   "Sources say each networks will likely reduce coverage from four years ago, even though coverage in 2000 already was scaled back from historic levels. Networks could provide as little as an hour of live coverage on the penultimate nights (Wednesdays), with perhaps two hours for the Thursday finale.  "This is a significant challenge for candidates. Kerry must use the convention to define himself before a national audience, presenting his carefully packaged image as a veteran and a leader, and overcome characterizations in Bush's TV ads that he is a flip-flopper, observers say.  "Bush, whose approval ratings dropped to 48 percent in the latest Gallup poll, needs his convention to reestablish his credentials on terrorism, security, and the economy, and counteract any post-convention 'bounce' by Kerry. Harry Truman is the only president to win reelection despite a June approval rating below 50 percent.  "Democrats and Republicans will continue talks with the networks this week and plead for more coverage."  That's kind of sad, the idea of political candidates begging the network heads for coverage. But Geoff is right in looking at the strategic options that this historic event effects. The term "Convention Bounce" is a part of any political scientists working vocabulary, it is considered  urlLink sine qua non  of any effective Presidential election strategy. The loss of gavel to gavel election coverage will undercut the strength of any bounce.  urlLink Trajectiories must be recalculated , on both sides:  "'We are gathering information, talking to the networks,' said Peggy Wilhide, communications director for the Democratic convention in Boston. 'The final decisions rest with them as to how much they will cover. We?re trying to make it as attractive as possible ...'"  "But Democrats are already turning elsewhere: 'We have done a lot of outreach to non-traditional [media] outside of the traditional big five,' said Wilhide.   "Black Entertainment Television will be broadcasting nightly from Boston's Fleet Center. The Spanish language Univision will have a correspondent there. MTV, Comedy Central and ESPN will also be producing convention shows.  "The cable political network C-SPAN plans gavel-to-gavel coverage from the convention floor, as it has in the past. The Fox News Channel, CNN and MSNBC, and Internet coverage can fill some of the void left by the withdrawing networks. The proliferation of media has given the networks an excuse to scale back coverage, observers add."  Perhaps the era of the dinosaur network is ending, and the politically astute viewer will have to be more nimble with his remote control finger to get the coverage that he or she needs to get the information to make the right choice come Election Day.  "Don Ritchie, associate Senate historian, said: 'The major networks ... make more money when they have comedies and Law and Order on than when they have politics on. That's the sad part of it.'"  Very, very sad indeed.

       Spike Lee Likes Strippers   While his pretty but kind of mean-looking wife  urlLink Tonya  is hard at work promoting her new book,  urlLink The Gotham Diaries , Spike Lee is causing anarchy in the UK, promoting his new movie ...  and seeing strippers with a galpal !   According to  urlLink the 3 AM Girls :  "... The supposedly happily married father of two splashed out hundreds of pounds on dancers. He was accompanied by a woman bearing an uncanny resemblance to his wife Tonya, who we're assured was back home in New York.  "The 47-year-old American maker of hit films such as  Do The Right Thing  and  Malcolm X , who married lawyer Tonya in 1993, turned up at  urlLink Spearmint Rhino  in Tottenham Court Road.  "He had spent the day promoting his forthcoming movie  She Hate Me . But rather than unwind by indulging in some of the culture the capital has to offer, he decided he'd have more fun at a strip club.  "His new film, which is due out in the autumn and stars  urlLink Woody Harrelson  and  urlLink Monica Bellucci , tells the story of a sacked executive who turns to impregnating lesbians to make money.  "The tagline for the film is 'one heterosexual male, 18 lesbians, his fee $10,000 each.'   "We can only assume he was doing a little extra research."  Th e Corsair  takes out his  urlLink antique opera glasses  with the mother of pearl handle and reviews the spectacle.   "Onlookers tell us his friend was so appreciative of the dancers she was warned by security staff for breaking the club's no touching rule and told that if she did it again she would be thrown out.  "An eyewitness tells us: 'Spike and his companion must have spent about ($360) on dances and there were two girls who they seemed to prefer.  "'The girl who was with Spike was particularly interested in a stunning mixed-race girl who looked very similar to her and when the girl was dancing she seemed rivetted."  The Corsair sips the  urlLink black wine of Cahors, elixir of Popes .  "'Later on she went over to the dancer and it looked like she was going to give her a peck on the cheek and thank her for the dances.  "'But she seemed to slip and as a result it looked like she'd tried to kiss her and ended up smudging the dancer's make-up. They weren't being threatening in any way, they were just having fun. It was weird to see Spike though.  "'I would have thought he'd prefer to indulge in far more cultural pursuits, but you never can tell, can you? I doubt he'll be back in a hurry.'"  "Spike initially tried to deny the story, telling his publicist it was complete 'poppycock' ...  "But later his spokeswoman admitted to us: 'Spike went to the club by himself and he left by himself.  "'That is his only comment on the matter.'"  So, who is this mystery woman who looks like his wife?

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  urlLink The La.com blog  has this little chestnut:  "That sexy, offbeat couple that hooked up on a cult-y TV show have been joining fellow Angelinos in that favorite weekend sport: hitting open houses. Friends and star-watchers in the know have interpreted this extracurricular behavior as a sign that a sometimes bouncy relationship may be moving toward the settling-down stage, to be followed by the raising of pretty, spoiled, therapy-bound rugrats. But that's definitely not the whole enchilada. These quirky lovebirds are just trying to spice up their relationship--they're such a pair of thrill-junkies, they've become addicted to pulling stunts like having quick sex in out-of-the-way rooms, guest houses and even attics of homes for sale, all the while fearing/hoping they will get busted. And recently, they got their wish. More than a few high-end realtors and home sellers are tricking out their prized properties with security cameras, in hopes of catching thieves and scammers who have been hitting open houses lately. But when our two lovebirds got caught on camera doing some oral gymnastics in an upstairs childrenÃ?&#146;s bathroom, they were asked by the real estate agents to vacate the premises pronto. How long before that tape turns up on the web?"  Anyone wanna  urlLink guess ? The board is saying The OC power couple  urlLink Adam Brody and Rachel Bilson , who, as it happens (The Corsair smiles), have  very publicly  been shopping for houses. Just how public is what Enquiring minds want to know.   Out :  urlLink Vice President Hillary ? Matt Drudge is so bad on accuracy, so wide of the mark in execution, and so often off in pitch, that he once, rather famously, predicted that  urlLink Disney was going to buy Apple Computer  ( The Corsair  softly chuckles). And there's no accounting for the scurrilous  urlLink Kerry intern piece  he hustled. Well, now he does himself one better, predicting that Hillary Clinton -- the Senator from a state he already has in the bag -- will be his Veep running mate:  "Official Washington and the entire press corps will be rocked when Hillary Rodham Clinton is picked as Kerry's VP and a massive love fest will begin!  "So predicts a top Washington insider, who spoke to the DRUDGE REPORT on condition he not be named.   "'All the signs point in her direction,' said the insider, one of the most influential and well-placed in the nation's capital. 'It is the solution to every Kerry problem.'  "'There are three issues that this campaign will be decided on-- national security, health care, and the economy, not necessarily in that order.'  "'Kerry believes that no one is better on national security than he is, he served in Vietnam after all, so he has that covered and the suggestion that he needs to strengthen the ticket with someone who has national security credentials is dismissed as foolish.'"   In : NY Post cutie  urlLink Elisa Lipsky-Karasz's new gossip  column iswonderful.  Herr most recent column let us know that Paul Burrell, the man P Diddy wants to replace Farnsworth Bentley, Diana's rock, wore an $18,000 diamond earring that shocked the WASPs. And that  Karen O  is dating Spike Jonze, "meanwhile she's still shacking up with her former boyfriend, rocker Angus Andrew." But the best scoop was this one:  " urlLink Al Sharpton's  wife,  urlLink Kathy , was caught hoarding the free shoes from the storage closet at Kimora Lee Simmons' Diva shoe party. 'But I need shoes for my babies!' she told the shocked staff when they accosted her."   Out :  Publicists : Do not lie to  Page Six , people. They will catch you and make a Fourth of Julybarbecuee out of your lying ass. For the past two days and running the Sixers have been humiliating smarmy, lyingpublicistss; a veritable Bonfire of the Vanities has been going on. Today,  urlLink Damon Dash's publicist, Amanda Silverman  of PMK/HBH got a beating. And yesterday,  urlLink Barbara Hutson , of the ironically titled p.r. company Truth Be Told Inc., was busted on lying. Just tell the truth when the Sixers come calling.   In :  Christian Slater . He's like the newBritanyy Murphy, his antics are so crazy. According to that significant cultural artifact  urlLink The National Enquirer , Slater visited a, uhm,  urlLink femme de la nuit :  "... the young woman says at first she didn't recognize the actor when he walked into the London brothel at 3 a.m.  "He was wearing scruffy jeans and a crumpled shirt.  "It was only after the Hollywood hunk picked her out that, she said, a security guy told her who her famous 'john' was. Soon they were in his fourth-floor suite at one of London's fanciest hotels, she claims.  "Right off the bat, Slater told her that he is married to TV producer  urlLink Ryan Haddon  and has two kids, she says.  "'He came across as really nice' said the woman, who may be the world's most starstruck prostitute.  "'I was puzzled when he told me about his family, but I guess he was just being honest. He was very experienced and knew exactly what to do.'"   Crazy.   Out :  urlLink Naomi Campbell  brings out the beast in men ( The Corsair  howls at the moon). According to British Vogue, things got rather dodgy in  urlLink the mysterious land of Sardinia :  "NAOMI CAMPBELL had to be rescued by police yesterday when a crowd of about 4,000 men overwhelmed security guards as she filmed her latest ad on a beach in Sardinia. Desperate to catch a glimpse of the British supermodel in her bikini, the crowd ignored the metal barriers which had been erected around the Cala Cipolla beach, near Cagliari, for the filming of a new ad for TIM mobile phone operators. According to Italian news agency Ansa, the sight of a scantily-clad Naomi, carrying a phone and flanked by an enormous black dog, was too much for her Italian fans to ignore."

       Cheesecake at Abu Graib?   From the August 2004 issue of Vibe, an cover feature story on The Diddy by Lola Ogunnaike:  "Tucked away in the back seat of his chauffer driven SUV, three days before he makes public his decision to dismantle Bad Boy's Da Band, Diddy launches into a passionate diatribe about work ethic and the group's lack thereof. Borrowing a line from  Raisin (In The Sun) , he diagnoses  urlLink Dylan  -- the groups resident rebel -- with 'acute ghettoitis'  "'He has a self-destruct button and doesn't take life seriously. So many young men and women don't take life seriously and don't decide to get off the corner until they're around 35, talking about you want to own a record company or open up a store,' says Diddy.'You wanted to spend 10 years hanging on the corner, smoking blunts, sleeping all day, and when it's time to get serious at 35 you wanna look at the other cats that's hustled since they was 16 and be mad at them?'  "Standing tall on his soapbox, an amped Diddy continues. Da Band's initial refusal to walk from Manhattan to Brooklyn to fetch him cheesecake comes to mind. 'If I were them, I would go get cheesecake right now, butt naked with some razor-blade strippers on, sliding through an alcohol pond."  Tell us how you really feel, Diddy.

       48 Hours with Christina Aguilera   "We may affirm absolutely that nothing great in the world has been accomplished without passion."    urlLink Hegel's Philosophy of History    Odd how reality works it's way out. Simultaneous to Britney's career implosion, Christina Aguilera's career has come into it's own, gently, elegantly, birthed from the titanic struggle between the thesis of "What a Girl Wants," and the antithesis of "I Am Beautiful".  Synthesis : the new, fashion darling, XTina, queen of the catwalk, celebrity endorser. Who would have guessed at that turn of events? Aguilera was the less pretty, less popular, more skanky of the two, only three years ago, but, it appears, with the fullness of time, she has won the diva-stakes; now it is Britney allegedly engaged to a man she allegedly stole from  urlLink a woman who is having his second child .   I wouldn't really be surprised to see XTina on vacation  urlLink in Corsica , checking out the ruins of Crusader castles.  Okay , maybe I'm pushing the elegance thing, but you get the point.  Christina Aguilera ,  urlLink according to British Vogue , who just decamped the private jet,  urlLink mirabile dictu , this morning -- supplied, so generously by Mohamed Al-Fayed -- after receiving  urlLink a whopping $366,000  for appearing at Harrod's.  urlLink British Vogue writes :  "... The 23-year-old singer took to the catwalk for  urlLink DSquared2's spring/summer 2005 show in Milan this morning  - the day after opening the Harrod's sale in London. Aguilera first met the label's twins, Dean and Dan Caten, when they designed costumes for her world tour last year. Now she has returned the favour by endorsing their latest collection."   Before attending the DSquared2 event, the  urlLink 3 AM Girls  caught up with XTina at Harrod's:  "The 23-year-old - who looked stunning in a ($5,421) white Carlos Miele dress - arrived to open the sale in a horse-drawn carriage and was a little disturbed by some of the fillies' bodily functions.  "'It's so gross they way they just do that all over the street,' the tiny singer sniggered.  "'I can't believe somebody has to clean that up. Maybe they store it and throw it at people they don't like!'"   The Corsair  can almost imagine  urlLink Amy Poehler  doing that impersonation.  "Chrissy recovered from her giggling fit just in time to greet the hundreds of screaming fans that lined the street.  "'It's so cool that they're here,' she said. 'Although the noise isn't helping my head!'  "Despite the 6am start, Christina had spent the previous night partying in London's Rouge bar and, like her favourite showbiz columnists, got in at 3am.  "'It was a great night but I'm paying for it now,' she laughed.  "After flexing her plastic on a deluxe Scrabble set ('I'll take on anyone at Scrabble! I'm the champ!'), five designer bags and seven hats, Chrissy decided the best cure for her aching head was a hair of the dog - and headed for the pet department.  "There, she found a love object to make boyfriend  Jordan Bratman , 27, jealous - a bichon frise puppy called Lucy.  "'Don't you think she's gorgeous?' she asked (3AM reporter) Caroline. 'I really want to take her home with me. I'll have to see if they can sort it out.  "'She'll be great company when Jordan's not around. We're not engaged but we are very happy.'  "And while her flunkies tried to arrange a pet passport, Christina - who flew in on one of flamboyant store owner Mohamed Al Fayed's private jets - headed for the lingerie department.  "'I usually only wear Agent Provocateur but the John Galliano collection here is fabulous,' she gushed, before notching up a ($10,837) bill on sexy smalls.  "Looks like Jordan's got a treat in store ..."   The Corsair  contemplates the treats ...  " ... Thirty-four bras and matching knickers,"   The Corsair  shouts, angrily, "Who you calling a ... oh, you said  knickers  --oh, hahaha --I thought you said ..."  " ... 12 corsets and 10 suspender belts from John Galliano's collection for Christian Dior - ($10,837)  "Deluxe Scrabble set - ($63)  "Three Jimmy Choo bags - ($2,167)  "Five Philip Treacy hats - ($1,806)  She even stopped to chat with  urlLink Hello !:  "... the Dirrty singer, who has reinvented herself as a classic screen siren, says we can expect to see more of her sophisticated new persona.   "'I am going to explore the music and art of the 1920s, '30s and '40s which will be an image change,' she said. 'It's that whole world of glamour and stars like Marlene Dietrich and Marilyn Monroe.'   "Once she had greeting the hundreds of fans who turned out to see her, the 23-year-old headed inside to check out the bargains. 'I love a spree,' admitted the chanteuse. 'Shopping is definitely one of my vices.'"     urlLink It's a hard knock life  ...

A probable cause affidavit prepared by the Marion County Sheriff's Office details Lafave's alleged involvement with the boy, who was interviewed by cops (as was his cousin, who was present for two of the auto encounters). According to the affidavit--portions of which were redacted by investigators--Lafave told the boy that she was "turned on by the fact that having sexual relations with him was not allowed." Since the incidents occurred in different jurisdictions, Lafave has been named in two separate criminal complaints.

       A Night At The Bijou   How about that  urlLink Bijou Phillips . It's like 1995 again and Bijou is on a rampage. A  rampage , my friend. Methinks that when Papa Phillips named his cute offspring Bijou, he never foresaw the shenanigans that plague LA today. According to  urlLink Page Six ,  urlLink Playboy Playmate Nicole Lenz  has filed a $1 million lawsuit against Bijou and  urlLink Johnson and Johnson heiress Casey Johnson . But, as you can imagine, most of the rough and tumble comes from the very punchy Bijou, with a very special guest cameo by  urlLink Matthew Perry  of Friends:  "As PAGE SIX first reported, Lenz obtained a restraining order against Phillips and Johnson after they confronted her at L.A. club XES on June 6, where Phillips attacked Lenz, punching her and dragging her 'across the room' by her ponytail, according to the suit. Lenz claims the actress was eventually pulled off her by  urlLink Matthew Perry  of 'Friends' and thrown out by security.   "The next afternoon, Lenz says she was again menaced by Phillips when they ran into each other at a charity event in Pacific Palisades. 'Shortly after plaintiff arrived, Phillips proceeded to yell obscenities at her and loudly called plaintiff a whore, a prostitute, a thief and other derogatory terms,' according to the suit.   "The suit also claims that the Los Angeles Police Department, after searching Lenz's apartment and interviewing her 'several times,' does not consider her a suspect in the alleged burglary of Johnson's jewelry.   "The accusations that Lenz stole Johnson's jewels have 'greatly damaged her present and future earning potential as a professional model and actress,' the suit says.   "Attached to the court filing is a PAGE SIX item detailing Phillips' history of violent behavior, including cutting off the tip of a friend's finger with a cigar cutter, stabbing another friend in the leg and slamming a socialite to the ground at a nightclub."  About that cigar-finger incident, Bijou was interviewed for  urlLink Index Magazine by Bruce LaBruce :  "BRUCE: Celebrity Sleuth once mentioned an urban myth about you cutting off some guy's little finger in a cigar cutter?   "BIJOU: Look, some jerk was coming on to me all night, grabbing my ass while I was dancing with my friends.  "BRUCE: Where was it?   "BIJOU: At Spy. We were all smoking cigars, and there was a cigar cutter. I dared my friends to put their fingers in it, and they're like, 'Yeah, Bijou. Whatever. Go away.' And then I saw that jerk who was bothering me, and I thought, 'Oh, that guy, he'll do it.' So I said, 'I dare you to stick your finger in there.' And he goes, 'Well what does it do?' I mean, if he's dumb enough to stick his finger in the fucking cigar cutter in the first place, then he deserves a little nick. I gave him a little nick and that was it.   "BRUCE: And there was blood, no doubt.   "BIJOU: He was bleeding for a minute, he grabbed some napkins and wrapped them around his finger. Then he came over and asked for my phone number. He said I owed him dinner.  "BRUCE: So how does that turn into an urban legend?   "BIJOU: Because a lot of people were there that night, like Leo and all those guys saw it. Everyone was like, 'She cut the fuckin' finger off, man, the finger was on the floor, she picked it up, it was horrible. I don't know, dude, she's fuckin' nuts. Fuckin' nuts.'  "BRUCE: [laughing] That makes a better story than if you'd actually done it.   "BIJOU: I was so young. I'd grown up with a family that was just a bunch of fucking junkies so I didn't have any manners or life skills."  Manners and life skills are so important when you're dragging a Playboy Playmate by her ponytail across the room at EXS.

       Mary Kate: Not Anorexia ... (Sotto Voce) "Rehab"    urlLink Gawker first reported last week  that Mary Kate Olsen may not be in a clinic for anorexia, and now, I suppose, with the  urlLink revelations of Star , it is official: Mary Kate Olsen is in rehab:  "Star magazine reveals that Mary-Kate Olsen- who along with twin sister Ashley, form a multi-millionaire power duo-is being treated for a cocaine addiction in an exclusive facility in Utah.   "Mary-Kate is currently residing at the exclusive  urlLink Cirque Lodge  in Utah, which is known for its scenic mountain views and a new-age, intensive-therapy approach to treating drug addiction. She was checked in by her father Dave Olsen on June 11, and spent her 18th birthday there by herself on June 13.   "The recommended 30-day program costs $29,850, and patients are free to come and go as they please, if their counselor agrees to give them a pass.   "The facility's website says it treats eating disorders in addition to drug and alcohol addictions. As it's been widely reported, Mary-Kate is also battling anorexia."  When are we going to just  outlaw  child stars? In The Corsair's perfect world, no on under the age of, say 15 would be allowed to become a professional actor, and if a director needed to cast a child he would have to use his own kid, or make a case to a court for why the child is needed and how he/she would look out for their welfare. Exposing kids to Hollywood ... it's just wrong. Okay,  The Corsair  is not going to moralize any longer.

But instead of looking at my pin, the Secret Service men tended to look at my black skin and say, 'Where are you going?' I'm like, 'Uh ... I work for Al gore.' One time in particular, when we were in Los Angeles for a big televised Presidential debate, I arrived at Al Gore's hotel from Washington State just as he was leaving for rehearsal. I knew that the elevator would be filled up, so I thought I'd just go down the stairs. Little did I know that the Secret Service and the Los Angeles police were in the stairwell trying to secure the building. Girl, they drew guns on me and threw them in my face. My pin, my ID, nothing worked. I'm sure it was my black skin, because every other credential said who I was. They finally released me once Gore had left the building. That was probably one of the only times aside from  urlLink November 7, 2000  that I cried."

       Diana: In Pursuit of Love    urlLink Hello! Magazine  excepts from the new book  Diana: In Search of Love , and it gives us some really amazing inside scoop:  "It seems that for a time, the Queen (of England) took to singing hymns unaccompanied after dinner was over. The Princess (Di) did not know whether to sing along, start clapping or remain silent."  And:  "The Princess, at  urlLink Balmoral (Castle)  rummaged through her husband's briefcase and came across a cache of letters. In doing this she exposed herself to the cold and conclusive realization -- that another woman was in love with her husband, and that love was clearly returned."   The Corsair  slowly deposits himself into his favorite plush chair, sips at a glass of aged champagne and continues:  "The letters -- and a couple of saucy postcards -- which (the author) was shown were from  urlLink Camilla Parker Bowles . As Diana read the passionate letters it was quite evident to her that Camilla, who called Charles 'My most precious darling,' was a woman whose love remained undimmed in spite of the passage of time.  "The tone of the letters was adoring. I recall the lengths to which Camilla went to contact Charles, on one occasion writing to him while secreted in the lavaratory on the  urlLink Queen Mother's  91st birthday. 'I just hate not being able to tell you how much I love you,' she wrote.   "The notes, on headed writing paper, continued, saying how much she longed to be with him and she was his forever. (The author) particularly remembers one vivid passage that read: 'My heart and my body both ache for you.'  "She apologized for breaking into gibberish during a secret phone call with prince Charles, blaming her husband in a memorable turn of phrase: 'the erstwhile silver stick appeared through the door looking like a furious stoat -- pity they did not stuff him.' It was a sentence that struck on (the author's) mind because  urlLink Brigadier Parker Bowles  had once held the ceremonial post of 'silver stick in waiting' to the Queen.  "I recall she went on to proclaim her undying affection for Prince Charles with phrases like 'I yearn to be with you night and day, to hug, comfort and love you.' She reminisced about a 'magical night' at a friend's country house. 'I dread the acting part,' she wrote, referring to a forthcoming lunch when she, husband in tow, was to join Prince Charles.  "As Diana absorbed the depth of her rivals love she was also able to see the extent of the duplicity that her husband and her lover connived in. Camilla carefully outlined dates and places where she was available to see him. It must have been horrible for Diana to realize that the venues where Mrs. Parker Bowles might meet Charles included the homes of people she called her friends.  "Just as shocking to Diana must have been the letter which referred personally to her. Camilla advised Charles to erase any thoughts of guilt about their relationship from his mind and rise above what she termed 'the onslaughts of that ridiculous creature' -- clearly a reference to Diana"   urlLink Hello!

       On Topic A With Arianna Huffington and the Adorable Theo Spielberg    urlLink Henry the Intern , as usual, puts us to shame with his trenchant analysis of Topic A. Check him out, if you haven't already.  The Corsair  would like to amplify on a comment Our Hendry made:  "(Theo) Spielberg, 15 (the adorable son of Steven Spielberg), was the representative for the youth vote. Is CNBC going for the Nickelodeon crowd? Anyone --intern Chris Schwarz!-- would have been better. Spielberg said he wants politicians to have charisma so young people know 'who and what they are voting for.' Franken had advice for kids like Theo: 'Grow up. . . You're not necessarily going to vote for someone who is the most charismatic.' Theo's other point was candidates should pick a few issues important to young voters and act 'very supportingly.' Franken: 'Such as?' Theo suggested the war, the draft, Social Security, and Medicare. Franken won with his eyes closed."   Yeah, yeah, yeah : Franken won the exchange, but how could he have not? Al Franken was probably debating politics ferociously as a  urlLink hypocritical Harvard liberal  while the adorable Theo was being born. And while Theo Spielberg was eating strained carrots and peas, Franken was writing for Saturday Night Live, being an ass  urlLink as to all accounts , and making enemies.  After Theo Spielberg made the comment that kids would be supporting of candidates who were charismatic (i.e. passionate) about Social Security and Medicare, Franken, rather creepily, rhetorically cornered Theo, archly asking something to the effect of -- so, kids your age care about Social Security and Medicare? To which the confident with a confidence of being a super rich and bright kid on the top of the Hollywood food chain, Theo countered, saying basically, well, not now, they don't, but if kids think in terms of their future and not on immediate goals, then yes,  they might care .  Good going Theo,  The Corsair  loves you, baby pop.  What is it with Al Franken? What makes him such a dick? The Corsair might venture to say it was Harvard, but fellow prick Eric Alterman went to Cornell. Rather, The Corsair thinks that it may be wrestling. Amateur wrestling, at a formative period in a young pubescent boys life, tends to make them assholes, quick to start argument, combative when they need not be (for further consideration, see punk Defense Secretary/ rassler  urlLink Donald Rumsfeld  and prick author/ wrestler  urlLink John Irving ).  A recent  urlLink New York Times magazine profile sums it up , at the height of the Democratic primaries:  "Onstage,  Martin Sheen  speaks first, then Dean's demure wife, then the suddenly embattled former governor of Vermont himself. Sometime after Dean begins taking questions from the audience, a manic-looking heckler starts to heckle, accusing Dean of 'covering up for Dick Cheney.' He gets louder. A couple of spindly members of Dean's security team approach him uncertainly; he swings his arms and keeps shouting. It goes on for several minutes and seems to be veering toward actual violence. Dean, the media, the members of the audience: nobody knows what to do."  Oh, but our man Franken does, does he ever (wicked Rumsfeldian gleam in eyes):  "At this moment Franken turns, cocks his head slightly, gives that well-known magnified, tortoise-shell-framed gaze and says: 'I think the two of us can get him out. You wanna do it?' After a pause that is meant to be emphatic, I say, 'No.' But it's too late: he's off, in rumpled jeans and a big down jacket, plowing up the aisle."  Al Franken's old school like that. When he cocked his head you just knew: it was on like Gray Poupon. The Corsair imagines the Harvard educated simian, rumpled jeans and big brown jacket ruffling in the wind, the accoustical sounds of  urlLink Six Million Dollar Man bionic sound effects  stacattoing in the background (da-da-da-da-da ...) as Franken-in-slow-motion-bolt approaches said interrupter, head low and spectacles fogged in anticipation of crunk:  "By this time there is a confused scrum around the heckler, who is holding his ground and still ranting. Franken hits the floor, wedges himself among a couple dozen legs and puts the man in a wrestling hold, grabbing him at the knees."  Oof! One can almost buckle at the beauty of the writing at this New York Times sports section style commentary, like that unfortunate freak, tumbling down the slippery slope into Prose Heaven. Oh, tell us more:  "That destabilizes him, and others now quickly push him down the aisle and out the side door of the theater."  Oh Al, destabilize the GOP;  destabilize !:  "Franken gets up, looking dazed; his glasses are snapped in two. He's quickly swarmed by confused but excited reporters who want to know, like, what was he doing?"  Blame it on Wrestling; Theo Spielberg rocks. Kate Capshaw and Stevie Hollywood did a good job instilling confidence in their adopted son, enough to hold their ground with fatuous dicks like Al Franken, who cannot seem to distinguish between combating Rush Limbaugh, and chatting with a 15 year old on his first Tv appearance.  Blame it on amateur wrestling.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In : The Great  urlLink Michael Gross . Our pal, swell guy  urlLink Michael Gross  is, according to  urlLink British Vogue , on top of the world:  "MADONNA is reportedly casting a group of models to play the likes of  urlLink Naomi Campbell ,  urlLink Linda Evangelista ,  urlLink Cindy Crawford  and  urlLink Christy Turlington  in a tell-all film about the supermodel world. The American superstar, who is now going by a new Kabbalah-inspired name of  urlLink Esther , has bought the film rights to  urlLink Michael Gross' book, Model . David Brendel has written the screenplay for the film, which is due to hit screens sometime next year and will, according to ratethemusic.com, star several of the famous named models themselves."  Congratulations, Michael,  urlLink if anyone deserves success  of this magnitude, it's you.   BREAKING: Madonna, according to  urlLink fashionweekdaily , re Esther:  "... Though the bag is just now hitting stores, Madonna was already seen toting her one-of-a-kind envelope-shaped shoulder bag to Demi Moore’s Kabbalah soirée.  Made of refined python and crocodile skin, the bag (which doubles as a clutch) comes complete with Swarovski crystals mounted on a grosgrain base and features the designer’s signature robot charm and leather key chain on the detachable handle.  Jet appliqués, quirky accessory clips, and a novel steel clasp finish off the detailing."   Crazy.   Out :  urlLink Naming your baby ESPN  (pronounced ES-Pen), (link via the very cool  urlLink Whatevs ):  " A Texas couple who named their son ESPN — after the cable sports network — is getting more than a bundle of joy for their decision.  Little 2-year-old ESPN Malachi McCall of Pampa, Texas, is getting his own TV special.   "Turns out he is not the only child with the unique name.   "ESPN ... McCall is one of at least three youngsters in the U.S. known to be named for the sports network. A couple in Corpus Christi named their son Espn Curiel in 2000, the same year Espen Blondeel was born in Michigan.   "And ESPN is taping a special about the kids."   To paraphrase  urlLink totalitarian-dictator coddling Cindy Adams , "Only in Texas, Kiddies, only in Texas ..."   In :  Nicole Kidman . According to the UK's  urlLink  Daily Star  (link via  urlLink Ananova ):  "Oscar-winner Nicole Kidman has been offered a ($109 million) blockbuster film deal.   The seven-film contract with Disney to make the  urlLink Chronicles of Narnia  would shoot the actress to the top of Hollywood's highest-paid list.  "And Nicole does not even need to appear on screen to earn the cash.   "Only her voice is needed for the part of the White Witch in the films.   "But a source said: 'Nicole will have to decide whether ($109 million) is worth her while.   "'Knowing you are committed to work on seven films is a tough one.'   Caveat emptor : The Daily Star is the only media vehicle reporting this as of 11 am Monday, so, you know, like: take this as you will. It sounds like an impossible amount, though; but I'm blowing this your way to get some conversation going.   Out :  urlLink Michiko Kakutani . Kakutani gets  urlLink the gas face from Vanity Fair scribe James Wolcott  on Howard Kurtz's Reliable Sources on CNN:  " KURTZ : Let me just take a moment to explain what we're talking about,  urlLink a front page 'New York Times' book review by the chief book reviewer of 'The New York Times.'  They've since run a second review by -- that was more favorable.  " WOLCOTT : By a real writer, by the way.  " KURTZ : Well, all right. I don't want to berate her right now."   Ka-Pow!  Score: Wolcott: 1; Kakutani: Zero.   In :  urlLink Matt Klam . According to a post he left on TMFTML, he's "writing a story for the NY Times Mag on bloggers."  The Corsair  salivates. My kingdom for a mention; some New York Times magazine love would be so sweet.   Out :  urlLink Denise Richards , the 33-year old wife of  urlLink Heidi Fleiss' top "John," Charlie Sheen ,  urlLink recent mother  of Sam,  urlLink future Playboy model ? According to that significant cultural artifact  urlLink The National Enquirer :  " urlLink RED-HOT mama Denise Richards  is preparing to bare all for Playboy, only three months after giving birth -- and her hubby Charlie Sheen couldn't be more proud!"   The Corsair  cringes, then calculates, coldly, the 12-year gap before little Sam's classmates start picking on her  big time .  "'Denise is thrilled that Playboy approached her to model in the magazine so soon after she became a mom,' said an insider. 'She thinks it's an incredible honor.'   The Corsair  groans for little Sam.  "And she said that Charlie isn't at all jealous."   The Corsair  groans again.  " ... In fact, he's really proud of her and happy that she wants to show off her beautiful body to other men.'   The Corsair  is really, really groaning now.  " ... But Denise, who has starred on TV's 'Spin City' and in  urlLink movies , is nervous about losing her baby fat in time for the photo shoot, say pals. She's hoping to be in Playboy's December issue and the photos have to be completed several months in advance.  "'Right now she's dieting and exercising like crazy so that she'll look her best for the camera,' said the insider. 'She's working with a personal trainer and following her own diet.  "'Already she looks in tip-top shape. But that's not good enough for Denise. She wants to be absolutely perfect when she strips in front of the world.'"   In :  urlLink Ingrid Sischy . She's all over the place today. On  urlLink Fashionweekdaily.com , she is, "SEEN:  urlLink Catherine Zeta-Jones , looking incredibly svelte in a Versace black halter dress, sitting front row next to  Interview’s Ingrid Sischy ." And, as if that is not enough of a media spotting, in  urlLink Lloyd Grove's Lowdown , "Publicity magnet  urlLink Abigail Vona , the 19-year-old author of the just-published memoir 'Bad Girl: Confessions of a Teenage Delinquent,' managed to surprise even seen-it-all  Interview mag editor Ingrid Sischy  when she showed up for a photo session in SoHo with a pair of handcuffs."   Out :  urlLink According to the AP , apes at the zoo, there for our leisure, will be able to let off some steam on us, their captors:  "The apes at Lincoln Park Zoo are finally getting a chance to take their revenge on people who for years have been pounding their palms against the glass walls of the primates' old home.   "At the zoo's new Regenstein Center for African Apes, chimpanzees can touch a panel hidden from public view that will shoot harmless bursts of air at unsuspecting visitors.   "'You often hear about chimps spitting or throwing,' said Steve Ross, a behaviorist at the zoo. 'They do that to get a rise out of the public. This gives them that opportunity but in a safe way.'"  Why can't we just watch them on tv? Why do we need to restrict their passage?     In :  Bill Clinton . According to  urlLink New York Magazine's Intelligencer :  "Bill Clinton was nominally exiled from lucrative speaking engagements at U.S. investment banks following his pardon of billionaire fugitive Marc Rich. (According to Senate filings for the years 2001 to 2003, Warburg Pincus was Clinton’s only paid speaking engagement to a U.S. investment firm of 139 speeches reported.) But the exile has ended. Clinton’s speech on June 2 at the Sanford C. Bernstein Strategic Decisions conference at the Waldorf-Astoria is the first real indication that Wall Street firms are once again embracing him. Back in February 2001, Morgan Stanley apologized to clients for paying $125,000 for Clinton’s first postpresidential speech."

       Diane Keaton Gets Arts Award; The End Is Nigh   According  urlLink to the AP :  "Because of her dedication to Western art, actress Diane Keaton has been awarded the Utah Governor's Award for Devotion to the Arts.   "After being praised for her dedication to Western art by Gov. Olene Walker, Keaton demurred, saying, 'I don't know who you're talking about, but it's not me — but I am very honored to be here.'"  A  Utah  Arts Award? Okay,  urlLink now I get it .   Still , off the top of my head,  urlLink Susan Sontag ,  urlLink BB King ,  urlLink Gore Vidal ,  urlLink John Simon ,  urlLink Robert Redford  and  urlLink Bob Dylan  are all far, far more deserving of that award.  For fucks sake : Tagger  urlLink De La Vega  is more deserving of an arts award than Keaton.

       The Frugal Gourmet Dies   Jeff Smith,  urlLink the Frugal Gourmet  has died in his sleep. Judith Blake of the Seattle Times writes very even handedly about a sensitive subject:  "Jeff Smith, the once-celebrated 'Frugal Gourmet' TV chef who fell from grace, was a hard man to peg.   "To some, the Seattle-based Smith, who died Wednesday, was a 'genius' of food and the culture surrounding it. His high spirits, acts of generosity and stalwart friendship, they say, were the true measure of the man.   "To others, he was a tyrant of the public-TV production set, a tireless self-promoter and a chef of mediocre culinary talent.   "He was accused in three lawsuits of sexually abusing some of the young men who worked for him, ending his television career in the 1990s.   "When Mr. Smith died, at age 65, those questions still surrounded him."   According to a  urlLink Jump the Shark  posters, "It jumped the shark at the end, when Mr. Gourmet sexually harassed his male assistant and it was hushed up. I think this was PBS's greatest scandal. Other than that though, the recipes were great. I really miss it. I'd probably still watch the show. I don't care that Mr. Gourmet is a poof."  Would that it were only that simple. Another poster on  urlLink Jump the Shark  amplifies:  "This show jumped when it was clear that Craig was more than the Frugal Gourmet's 'assistant.' During Craig's first year, he made an occasional appearance helping the Frug' chop onions or something. Then as the months progressed more and more shows featured Craig and his talents. Then if you watched the videos of the trips to Spain and Rome, you wondered ... why is Craig featured in every snippet? Of course, once the Frug' got arrested for his  urlLink questionable activities with young boys , it all became painfully clear."  Jeff Smith was a haunted man who now, if you go in for that sort of thing, has a reckoning. And if you don't he is now presiding over a frugal gourmet for a certain convocation of politic worms, not where he eats,  urlLink but where he is eaten .  Jeff Smith, RIP

       Elizabeth Hurley's Fashion Diary   According to  urlLink British Vogue's Fashion Bites :  "ELIZABETH HURLEY wasn't in Paris just to shop this week. The model and actress is having a go at fashion journalism. A diary of her front and backstage experiences will appear in a forthcoming issue of French glossy  urlLink Citizen K ."   The Corsair  (wink, wink) managed to attain (wink, wink) a rough draft of some of her notes:   urlLink July 6, Galliano Show : Incredible! All those fur lined gowns and opera coats, I must have some of these fairy tale outfits. My  urlLink American Express Centurion card ,  oops , I mean "boyfriend," (insert soft chuckle here)  Arun Nayar  -- what's the difference really? -- is sitting here beside me as I catch  urlLink the Galliano show . So imaginative, that man. Almost as imaginative as  urlLink Melania Knauss , who is here with Vogue, where she will write about how she picks out her "trousseaux," which is, I guess, what you get when you snag The Perfect Billionaire. In other words, this nonentity, this  Knauss , is marrying The Billionaire Donald, of late NBC TV star, writing for  Vogue , trailed by  urlLink Andre Leon Tally , and I am here with something called Arun Nayar, while writing for Citizen K. I'm about as "happening" as the sink where Alec Wek just  urlLink went sick . Someone please shoot me.   urlLink July 7, Chado Ralph Rucci Couture : Lots of bold statements with animal skins, and crystals embroidered into  urlLink earth tone fabrics . And speaking of earth tones:  urlLink Oprah's taking notes , but I looked over at her pad and all it had on it were elaborately drawn pictures of great beefsteaks and juicy briskets.  urlLink Oprah says she will buy 4 or 5  of Rucci's pieces. She is a billionaire and my last three films have grossed roughly a hundred dollars, what? Someone please shoot me.   urlLink July 7, Christian Lacroix Haute Couture : The creme-pleated bustier dress would have looked flattering on me a few years ago. Can't help thinking that my old lover  Hugh Grant , that  doff , the man who got preferred the ministrations of  urlLink Divine Brown  to my own  urlLink considerable charms , is now  urlLink knocking boots with Jemima Goldsmith , of the  urlLink uber-rich Goldsmiths , and here I am, scribbling for something called  Citizen K . Now who'se the wanker. Someone please kill me, while I can still make a decent-looking corpse.   urlLink July 9, Gaultier : Thank god  urlLink Jean Paul Gaultier  used sky blue chiffon  urlLink and forgoing the bread  this time around; heaven knows  I'm starving myself enough  to try and snag a billionaire with a heart condition, and don't need to be reminded of how carbs can thwart that process. Lots of  urlLink "demi-couture"  going on here. His  urlLink daring wedding gown  only reminded me that the skin is just a little bit looser this year, which makes hurts the billionaire prospects. Perhaps I should start lowering my standards? Does the oily  urlLink John Lovitz  still have some of his SNL loot, or has he spent it all on  urlLink the Playmates  yet? Someone please kill me.   urlLink July 9, Elie Saab Couture : Lilac, shiffons and diamante accents blah-blah-blah ... what about  me , Citizen K Magazine? What about  me ? I was my generation's  urlLink Zuleika Dobson , the pretty and winning English girl who would be "taken care of" by the Lords in Sussex. Ten years ago, I wowed the world in my black Versace safety pin dress, and now, my film production company,  urlLink Simian Films , is worth approximately three hundred dollars. Ah, those wonderful Clinton 90s, the Golden Age of Eurotrash-- Tina Brown ruled Vanity Fair, Emma and Thompson and Kenneth Branagh were the uber-couple, Hugh actually was a celebrity, and I, ah, me, I basked in his reflective glory. The early 90s: When Middle Aged Housewives in the Midwest put their Bingo money into  urlLink Merchant and Ivory features . Ahh, those were the days. America was a British colony all over again. That was before the loose skin and the regrettable  urlLink Bedazzled . Someone please shoot me.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  Monday's New York Magazine  piece -- we cannot wait.  It's on like Gray Poupon !  urlLink Gawker takes a sneak peak  at a chestnut from Monday's pyrotechnic display also known as New York Magazine's article on  urlLink the Gossip Wars . And  urlLink Fashionweekdaily's Daily Spy  chimes in:  "New York magazine closed their much-buzzed-about gossip story on Thursday amid a furor of speculation and rumor. Writers Vanessa Grigoriadis and Jacob Bernstein expanded the piece from its initial focus on the  urlLink dust-up between former Page Six-er  Ian Spiegelman and scandalmonger  urlLink Doug Dechert  to comprise an acidic look at the New York gossip machine in general, and seemed intent on dredging up any controversy they could along the way. Spiegelman, Dechert,  urlLink 'Bad Girl' author Abigail Vona , Lloyd Grove, and Richard Johnson were all photographed for the story, leading some to speculate that it could end up on the cover. There is also buzz that young Bernstein?s byline may not make the cut. Only at New York, kids, only at New York."   Out : All of a sudden ... the whole ( The Corsair  makes ironic quotation marks with his fingers out of thin air) "America Watches Courtney Love's slow and protracted Nervous Breakdown" routine isn't as ...  fun  as it was in the Spring. Actually, in point of fact the way it's playing itself out is kind of creeping me out. Things took a  urlLink David Lynchian  turn somewhere and we want to jump the fuck off this ride.  Seriously . Courtney is scaring us; and we don't mean the way Lenny Kravitz explains that she ran around her old apartment hallways naked either.  urlLink The Post reports , "A weeping and cursing Courtney Love was rushed from her SoHo apartment to a hospital wearing a camisole and handcuffs yesterday on her 40th birthday, after telling cops she had an  urlLink abortion ."  Whoa!  Back that up. Way too much information. Way  Waaay  too much. I am a media junky, but we are officially -- as of right here right now -- staying away from Court Love.    In :  urlLink Ultragrrrl  put  urlLink this  up on her site and I've been laughing about it for about an hour now, which either says I'm working too hard, or The Ultra is a comedy genius. I'm seriously considering converting to Judaism so that we can get married and issue stunning little mocha-colored kids with sophisticated blogs.   Out : Billionaire  urlLink Dallas Mavericks owner ,  urlLink Mark Cuban, tells us , "'How could (I) let Steve Nash go?'  It?s a question I?m going to hear for a long time. It?s a question Mavs fans deserve an answer to. As best I can, I will try to go through all the logical, illogical, emotional and financial scenarios that we explored in putting together the offer that we thought would keep Steve a Dallas Maverick for the rest of his career." If you like long-winded, rambling basketball stories told by self indulgent and mildly eccentric billionaires, then hot-damn, you might want to go  urlLink here  and forever lose an hour slice of your summer.   In : Marlon Brando's secret tapes. You just know that pretty soon, they will be out, according to that significant cultural artifact  urlLink The National Enquirer :  "'Marlon secretly tape-recorded his phone calls -- he was the consummate control freak," divulged best-selling author Peter Manso, who wrote the definitive book on the actor's life,  urlLink 'Brando: The Biography .'  "Marlon Brando secretly taped phone conversations -- and now some of the biggest names in Hollywood are terrified their darkest secrets will be exposed, The ENQUIRER has learned exclusively. The rotund actor loved nothing more than phoning friends and dishing dirt for hours about the showbiz elite -- and even persuaded Marilyn Monroe to disclose her secrets about the Kennedys, say sources.  "The Hollywood legend spilled gay and straight sex secrets of stars, reveled in details of cheating and sordid affairs, got actors to disclose their mistresses -- and even spoke freely about his own bisexual lifestyle ... all on tape."  I'll give 20-1 odds that it will be all over the web by Thanksgiving. By the way, which one of Brano's multitudes of children will get the Tahitian Atoll, and can islands be inherited?   Out : It looks like this may be  urlLink the end of Tony Blair :  " urlLink British Prime Minister Tony Blair  considered resigning last month and had to be persuaded to stay on by senior colleagues, the BBC reported Saturday.   "Blair's office made no comment on the report, saying he had repeatedly insisted when asked about his future that he would lead his ruling Labor party into a third general election expected next year, which analysts predict he would win.   "Blair, who has seen his ratings tumble in opinion polls since last year's war in Iraq (news - web sites), had been 'seriously considering his position' following a series of attacks on his leadership, the broadcaster said in an unsourced report.   "Three cabinet colleagues, Health Secretary  urlLink John Reid , Culture Secretary  urlLink Tessa Jowell  and Education Secretary  urlLink Charles Clarke  met Blair, urged him not to quit and sought to assure him he had wide government support, it said.   "'I'm not going to speculate on what I see as Westminster gossip,' Jowell told BBC radio Saturday. 'Tony Blair is our prime minister -- the most successful prime minister of modern times. He will continue to lead our government.'"   urlLink The Pakistan Daily Times  shares some acute observations on the political atmosphere at 10 Downing Street:  "Britain’s Tony Blair looks like taking a fresh hit over Iraq next week on the eve of two closely watched by-elections — events that will help shape the political landscape for an expected 2005 general election.   "Within four days, an inquiry will report on intelligence failings over Iraq’s weaponry, Blair’s government will unveil its public spending plans for the next 3 years and voters could humiliate his Labour Party at the polls.   "With the prime minister’s popularity battered by Iraq, such a combination would have prompted fears of a Labour mutiny two months ago. But parliamentarians and analysts say Blair is on firmer ground now and the timing of events — coming just before parliament breaks for summer — will spare him any long-term damage, whatever the week’s outcome.   "'I don’t sense any conspiracy right now,' said one Labour parliamentarian (MP). 'They won’t be thinking of plotting. They’ll be thinking of their buckets and spades.' Wyn Grant, professor of politics at Warwick University agreed that Blair has survived the worst, 'It’s not plain sailing, but he’s coming into calmer waters.'"   Or , as  The Corsair  predicts, a deep sea storm.

       Senator Mike Ditka?!   According to  urlLink the Hill's Patrick O'Connor :  "In the wake of  urlLink Steve Rauschenberger’s  withdrawal from the Illinois Senate race, former Chicago Bears coach  urlLink Mike Ditka  has surfaced as a favorite of many Hill and state Republicans, according to interviews with GOP members and staff in Illinois and Washington."   The Corsair  sighs with melancholy and gives up on the possibility of electing  urlLink a black Senator in 2004 .  "The Super Bowl-winning coach and Hall-of-Fame player is a Chicago icon whose name identification and stature would make him a well-known, if inexperienced, candidate in the race to replace Sen. Peter Fitzgerald (R), who is stepping down at the end of this legislative session.   The Corsair  landed a super secret interview with Da Coach (wink, wink), that he wants to share with you, true believers:   The Corsair : So, let's say that the way this plays out is victory. What Senate Committees would you be interested in serving on?   Mike Ditka :  urlLink Da Budget .   The Corsair : What places in Illinois are you looking forward to campaign in?   Ditka :  urlLink Decatur    The Corsair : And what's your campaign slogan?   Ditka :  urlLink Da Coach .   The Corsair : Beverage of choice?   Ditka : Da beer.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In : Last Night's Kerry gala at Radio City Music Hall was very "in"; both Gawker and  urlLink Wonkette  had deep-undercover operatives on hand (I'd tell you their names, but then I'd have to kill you) that give their penetrating sociological analysis of the event in question. From  urlLink Wonkette :  "Just arrived at the Kerry-Edwards gala circle jerk at Radio City Music Hall. Crowd is a mix of high-toned Hamptons crowd discussing real estate and melanomas, and young 20-something staffers and professionals in business garb talking animatedly about Edwards and "energy." And college-aged cute things who surely didn't pay their way in. A lot of people seem to think that everyone should know them, but nobody does. (The threshold for "famous-for-New-York being somewhat higher than for DC equivalents.) Seen no genuine celebs yet."  Seems the genuine celebs and jet set swishy folk were all over at  urlLink Jean Paul Gaultiers F/W Haute Couture show  in Paris.  urlLink Gawker  on the lack of genuine celebs:  "If a terrorist had taken a giant flamethrower to Radio City Hall tonight, there would have been no B-List celebrities left in New York. It really made you realize that no one famous lives in this town anymore, and with presenters like Jessica Lange ... and Chevy Chase (who was straining to see the teleprompter; he looked very confused) this idea was further re-inforced.   " ... The Douche of the Night was Jason Binn. He's about as tall as a jar of Icy-Hot and looks like a fig with a facelift. He was affixed to Arianna Huffington all night, who was in turn affixed to Tina Brown and Fisher Stevens. TWICE in the lobby I saw Huffington make like she was ditching Binn, only to have the little spermatazoa literally yell out "Arianna," (the first time), and when she left with Fisher, "Fisher!!!" This second time Binn was talking to a group of over-tanned buttheads who were just waiting for their car to the Hamptons, but the group quickly proceeded to mock him as he ran after Arianna like the pathetic Heather he is.   Out :  Chris Gore  of IFC TV's Ultimate Film Fanatic. I just don't like his  urlLink face . It's part chemical, part playa hating with me: he really makes me want to throw down. Anyhoo,  urlLink Indiwire writes :  "Chris Gore of Film Threat fame is the show's host, and tells indieWIRE he's qualified to host a film trivia TV show because 'I can read at a 6th grade level and I can deliver lines from cue cards really well. Also, I have mastered the art of walking to a piece of tape on the floor and stopping precisely where the tape is placed.'  "Gore also doesn't mind hanging out with the show's esteemed panelists, including former porn star  urlLink Traci Lords  and  urlLink Kevin Smith  sidekick  urlLink Jason Mewes . ('Jason Mewes began passing dirty notes and horribly obscene drawings during breaks in the show,' Gore tells indieWIRE. 'All I could think to myself, as any film geek might, is what they would fetch if they were sold on eBay.')  Can I punch him out now? ( The Corsair  gets "punchy," doing fancy footwork, while simultaneously throwing powerful overhand rights and complex combination shots with the hand  not  holding the 3/4s-full glass of  urlLink The Cutty Sark ) You know, really show him  urlLink what the frequency is  ( The Corsair  lunges at the screen).   In : Rock and roll  urlLink coochie  coo. (link via  urlLink stereogum , it's his fault, so blame him)   Out : Ah, a day in the life of  urlLink Haley Binn , wife of  urlLink The Jason , according to  urlLink Fashionweekdaily :  "Jason and I arrive at the Bulgari luncheon at the  urlLink Hotel Jerome . IÂ?m wearing Trish of Capri sandals, Theory pants, an Izod shirt, and my Blinde sunglasses. LetÂ?s see whoÂ?s hereÂ?youÂ?ve got 20 fabulous ladies of Aspen,  urlLink Bill  and Kristen Bellamy,  urlLink Tommy Davidson , and, of course,  urlLink Nick Warnock  (from 'The Apprentice'), who now works for Jason. Even  Francois Kress , the managing director of Bulgari, flew in for this event! It was a lot of fun. We all went around the table and introduced ourselves and said why we love Aspen. Bill and Tommy both told funny stories of their first encounters with Jason."   Oh Lord , had  urlLink Haley  dropped one more name, I might have passed out from the altitude. You see, Dear Haley is the  urlLink Sir Edmund Hillary  of Social Climbing   Out :  urlLink Daniel Libeskind , the architect who wanted too much, in a Gawker Stalker sighting:  "July 4, corner of Canal and Thompson, who should bounce around the corner that World Trade Center development project architect Daniel Libeskind, presumably returning from that morning's ground breaking. (Just caught a very quick glimpse, but how many spikey-haired, nerdy-glasses-ed German-looking guys wearing all black on a 90 degree day could there be?)"  Only an architect, kiddies, only an architect.   In : UberWaif  urlLink Kate Bush .  urlLink Big Boi's  favorite artist is Kate Bush.  Pink  loves Kate Bush. Everyone who loves music loves Kate Bush but we are all afraid to say it out loud. Why? I'm going to say it for anyone that has ever been afraid to put it on the boom box and play it out loud and proud: When  The Corsair  wants to crawl into that special emotional space he puts on his Kate Bush, and cuddles with his  urlLink Pound Puppy . So there.   Out :  urlLink Rupert Murdoch , according to  urlLink Paul Colford of the Post rival NY Daily News , who himself reports on an article in Post rival the  urlLink The Old Gray Lady  (It's confusing to all of us):  "Media mogul Rupert Murdoch himself was behind  urlLink the New York Post's Dick Gephardt-for-veep fiasco , according to a published report.  "A day after Murdoch responded to the gaffe that made global headlines by saying  urlLink 'Everybody made a mistake,'  the New York Times reported last night that it was the big boss who came up with the elusive exclusive.  "An anonymous Post employee told the Times that Murdoch, chairman and chief executive of the Post's parent company News Corp., called in the tip at about 10 p.m. Monday night, between the first and second editions.  "City Desk editor Mike Hechtman took the feed, weaving it into a front page exclusive, sans byline, on Kerry's pick of the Missouri congressman as his vice presidential running mate, said the report posted on the Times Web site."   In :  urlLink Dana Milbank's chat  at WashingtonPost.com (link via  urlLink Romenesko ) yielded an interesting riff on why George Bush doesn't give a fuck about African-American preachers:  "Rockville, Md.: What is your analysis of the President's refusal to address the NAACP convention?  "Dana Milbank: Before he took office, Bush made clear that he was trying to circumvent the traditional civil rights establishment in favor of new black leaders, particularly religious ones, who shared his conservative views on social policy and favored school vouchers, etc. He's also visited milder groups such as the Urban League. This strategy of avoiding the traditional civil rights crowd has not gone very well for him, but neither is there much to be gained by drawing a hostile reception from the NAACP."   Out :  Amish in the City , according to the  urlLink AP :  "A reality TV series about Amish teenagers exploring the world beyond their community and faith will debut this month despite protests by members of Congress.   "'Amish in the City' begins with a special two-hour episode July 28, the UPN network announced Thursday."

       Chappelle: "I Don't Know What the Fuck (Nader) Thinks He's Doing"   From the  urlLink August 2004 Blender :  " Blender : You talk about race, this country's great unspoken topic.  " Dave Chappelle : It's hilariously unspoken ... you know who goes through it and no one talk about? Poor white people. Poor white people feel like they're supposed to be rich. That's why they always sound crazy -- like 'Niggers are taking all the jobs at Burger King.' Alright, you sound like a fucking idiot right now ...  " Blender : Who are you going to vote for President this Fall?  " Dave : I'm going to ask you to take a wild guess.  " Blender : Then we'd guess John Kerry.

       This Sunday on 60 Minutes: Exclusive Kerry/Edwards Interview   Those long, boring, dog days of summer 60 Minutes repeats -- you know, the ones where you get positively  intimate  with the  urlLink Kerry-Bush Skull and Bones story  all over again,  for the fifth time  -- may be over. In an age of hyper-competitive television, where 24 hour cable news channels regularly eat the lunch of network news divisions and first run midsummer replacement reality TV programs regularly snack on the bones of newsmagazine reruns, CBS is doing something rather groovy, baby, to be sure. For the  second  time this summer (Dan Rather's Bill Clinton exclusive interview was the first; remember when Dan dressed in geeky jeans pulled ... just a  little bit  too far up in 'old man uncool' fashion and roamed through the mean streets of Little Rock, Arkansas with Bill?  Priceless ), the 60 Minutes gang is cutting short their long and lusty summers in Martha's Vinyard to actually break some news (Just what the fuck is it about liberals and Martha's Vinyard, anyway? Please tell me, I'm clueless). This time,  urlLink 60 Minutes has the first joint interview with that new political sensation, the John-Johns ,  urlLink Senator John Kerry  and John Edwards.  urlLink USA Today  notes (link via  urlLink Romenesko ):  "Sunday, the show will be fresh again when  urlLink Lesley Stahl  interviews Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry and his running mate, John Edwards, fresh off a campaign stop Saturday in Edwards' home state, North Carolina.  "It will be another exclusive: the candidates' first joint interview.  "Executive producer  urlLink Jeff Fager , who has taken the reins from legendary producer  urlLink Don Hewitt , will interrupt his vacation on Martha's Vineyard to put the interview together. He has asked commentator Andy Rooney, who is on his traditional July vacation in upstate New York, to weigh in, too.   "Fager says viewers should expect more breaking news in summers to come -- even though, when it comes to ratings, there is little incentive: 60 repeats do nicely in the summer, routinely finishing in the Top 10.   "'When there's news, we're going to be covering it. The viewers expect that. This has become a broadcast where big news is broken. That's an exciting thing . . . so it's not going to matter in the future what time of year it is.'"  Breaking news during the summers ... cool -- and so begins the reign of Jeff Fager.  The  urlLink CBS 60 Minutes website , which, by the way, is all over this groundbreaking exclusive, touting it's own network horn, says:  "Stahl will talk to both candidates and their wives, Teresa Heinz Kerry and Elizabeth Edwards, in Edward's home state of North Carolina, after the two wind up a campaign swing through Ohio, Florida, West Virginia, New Mexico and North Carolina."  We can't wait either to hear that breathy Mozambique-by-way-of-Switzerland accent of Theresa Heinz.  What can I say , we Gemini's get off on odd speech patterns.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  Gossip ; and, on the side, a possible NY Times Sunday Styles story.  urlLink Fashionweekdaily's Daily Spy  notes (second story down):  "New York Magazine is finally closing its  urlLink Ian Spiegelman  gossip column piece for next Monday’s issue (penned by the  urlLink Vanessa Grigoriadis  and  Jacob Bernstein  tag team), but the New York Times Sunday 'Styles' section wants in on the action and may try to steal some of the mag’s thunder this weekend. Insiders say editor  Trip Gabriel  has assigned a piece on the proliferation of New York gossip columns and the increasingly competitive market for juicy items. The addition of two Sunday columnists,  urlLink Elisa Lipsky-Karasz  at the Post and  urlLink Ben Widdicombe  at the Daily News, has certainly upped the gossip quotient. The Times piece is said to be focusing on the fact that there are too many columnists and not enough items or events worth covering. Apparently their theory is that sooner or later, it’ll boil down to survival of the fittest."  Survival of the fittest, you say?  The Corsair  merrily dusts off his college copy of  urlLink Darwin's Origin of the Species  and softly chuckles to himself, reading Chapter 3, the key to the whole book really, entitled "The Struggle for Existence."   In : We have always maintained that the first blog "celebrity" is  urlLink Wonkette's Ana Marie Cox . Her timing was precise. We like her better than Drudge, to be frank, because Drudge doesn't have a sense of humor, and, what's more, operates more like a Public Access show than a blog proper. Anyhoo: There are many reasons for Ana Marie's success: one, being, that the US is the last superpower left standing; two, is that that fact makes DC the  de facto  capitol of the world; three, that makes DC gossip -- the gossip of world power --  priceless ; four, there is really no minute-by minute-DC-gossip newspaper or radio station or media outlet at all, that task is  particularly  well suited to the web; five, Drudge is based in Florida, thus Wonkette has the monopoly on the up-to-the-minute DC power gossip; and, finally, six, Ana Marie Cox is fucking funny. Add it all up, and all the ingredients of stardom are there; famous for DC, in an election year, is, basically, influential.  Enough with the ass kissing , though, because Ana is covering the Democratic Convention for MTV News, a big multimedia break for us bloggers, according to  urlLink the Washington Post  (fourth story down, link via  urlLink Romenesko ):  "That foul-mouthed red-haired vixen known as the Wonkette ( Ana Marie Cox of Arlington) has leveraged her popular political gossip site, Wonkette.com, into a gig with MTV News. The network will announce today that it has hired Cox, 31, to cover all the incredible tension and excitement that is the Democratic National Convention. It says her 'unabashed style and irreverence' will galvanize young voters."  Rock on, Ana Marie, we like your style. What next?  urlLink Old Hag  on PBS? A  urlLink Gothamist  30 minute show on NY1?

For more than a year, the 'Shrek 2' star, 31, has been fighting to stop the world from seeing photos and video she made over a decade ago when she was a model. But now a Russian-registered Web site (WARNING: ADULT CONTENT!) www.scandal-inc.com is trafficking in an 'S&M' film titled 'She's No Angel: Cameron Diaz.'  "The home page shows a woman who looks like Diaz - topless and in fishnets - joining a brunette in some 'Spartacus'-style role-playing with a grimacing guy in shackles and a loincloth.  "According to  urlLink www.defamer.com , the trailer for the 30-minute video, which sells for $39.95, shows the actress using a can of Freon or compressed air for a purpose probably not recommended by the manufacturer."

Nevo, who runs a firm called  NV Investments , is a frequent attendee at the annual Allen & Co. confab here and is usually seen bantering with every big-name CEO in attendance.   "But details on his background are scarce; sources will only say that he is a wealthy individual with stakes in many large media companies, including Time Warner.   "Now, a source says, Nevo could become a backer for Weinstein if the Miramax chief, as expected, bolts his employment contract with Disney, which bought Miramax in the 1990s.   "Amid frayed relations with Disney chief  Michael Eisner  — who has arrived in Sun Valley, but has kept a low profile — Weinstein has been negotiating a possible exit with Disney for months.   "Sources say a preliminary resolution could be reached this week, although a public announcement would likely not come for some time.   "Weinstein is expected to hit the ground (in Sun Valley, Idaho) today."   Intriguing.    Out :  A Spy In The House of Mouse!   urlLink Defamer  is reporting that  urlLink FlyOnTheWall  says ( The Corsair  also is thoroughly confused by the meta-media nature of blog reporting), that embattled Disney CEO Michael Eisner's office was bugged:  "Blogger A Fly On The Wall reports that electronic listening devices ("bugs," in the parlance of espionage) were found in Disney CEO Michael Eisner's office on the company's Burbank lot during a "routine" security check over the July 4th holiday weekend. Just to make sure everything was nice and bug-free (tiny microphones do wreak havoc on an office's decor), some furniture was hauled away, ostensibly to be replaced by furnishings vetted by Disney's anti-spy squad. We've unfairly imagined Eisner as a disturbed paranoid, fortifying his office against bloodthirsty shareholder mobs. But it appears his fears were justified."

       Time to Dump Cheney?   Originally published February 25th, I've tweaked this up a bit:  It's no secret that  Dick Cheney  is  urlLink not a popular man  throughout the land (a thousand pardon's to the all powerful Wyoming lobby).  urlLink Even his daughter  may have something to say about the Administration's ban on gay marriage. In fact, many  urlLink consider him too powerful . But now that John Kerry has chosen the dynamic Senator John Edwards as his running mate, the President may want to consider a stronger ticket. In other words, could  urlLink Dubya  ask Cheney to step down (wink, wink) "for the good of the party"? You know, a (The Corsair makes ironic quotation marks with his fingers out of thin air) "health related" stepping down. Is Bush powerful enough? Here's a little imagined dialogue of possibility:   Cheney : Mr. President?   Dubya : Good to see you, Dickey, hows the old ticker doin'?   Cheney : (Taken aback) Oh, fine, sir; got a clean bill of health, yessiree, Mr. president.   Dubya : Oh, is that so (A Sly smile plays upon the President's lips). Are ya sure you wouldn't want to  urlLink take some time off , Dick?   Cheney : -- S-Sir?   Dubya : You know, like, oh, the  entire second term .    Cheney : ( urlLink Incredulous ) Wh- aat ?   Dubya : Well, it's this war thing, Dickie, sorry to say. Nothing personal. Edwards is a professional vivisectionist, a trial lawyer, he'll draw and quarter you in a debate, Dick. I can't run on a  urlLink National Security platform  down south if Kerry starts rallying vets against you for being such a goddamned  urlLink chicken hawk    Cheney : But, sir, I object, I --   Dubya : No, I know you aren't a goddamned chicken hawk, Dick. Wouldn't have asked you to join the ticket if you were. But politics is about (The President makes ironic quotation marks with his fingers out of thin air) the perception . How else do you think I  urlLink broke John McCain in South Carolina  in 2000?   Cheney : But I was Defense Secretary --    Dubya : Speaking of that. Didn't you administer pop's First Persian Gulf War?   Cheney : (puffs up) Why yes, I did indeed.   Dubya : And who was the general in the field, he had a funny name.  Polish  or somethin'   Cheney : (nervous) Shwarzkopf, er ...  urlLink Norman Shwarzkopf .   Dubya : (smiles) Stormin' Norman, I like that. See that, Dickie, we've already got a nickname for him.   Cheney : But, sir --   Dubya :  And he's from Florida , isn't he?   Cheney : Uhm, yes, sir --   Dubya : Perfect (reaches for a pretzel). Him or  urlLink Giuliani  would be just the ticket for the ticket.  Giuliani  at the New York convention would be perfect. McCain is a war hero too, and let's not forget Powell, everybody Loves Powell, he's better than that Ray Romano feller. But if I went with Rudy, I'd campaign in the South, and Giuls would just stay right there in the tri state area of NY, Jersey and Connecticut. (quietly calculating to himself) I'm pretty sure we could wrest Jersey away from the Blue states ...   Cheney : (desperation) But, if I may speak frankly, what about Wyoming, sir. You couldn't have swept that state without  me  on the ticket.   Dubya : I guess we'll just have to manage Wyoming's whopping three electoral college votes without ya, Dickster. A vacation is a good thing. Sound mind and all that. You know, that  urlLink Al D'Amato's  got sound political instincts.    Cheney : (Crestfallen) yes, sir --

       NY Times Op Ed Bashes Bill Cosby   The Cos takes a bit of a bitchslapping in the mush mouth from the  urlLink Op Ed page of The New York Times today . Barbara Ehrenreich writes for vacationing Thomas Friedman:  "It was such a dog-bites-man story that I almost skipped right by: Billionaire Bashes Poor Blacks. The only thing that gave this particular story a little piquancy is that the billionaire doing the bashing is black himself. Bill Cosby has been attacking the poor of his race, and especially the youthful poor, for a range of sins, including using bad words, 'stealing poundcake,' 'giggling' and failing to give their children normal names like 'Bill.' 'The lower-economic people,' Cosby announced, 'are not holding up their end in this deal.'"  Crazy, I can't believe the creator of  urlLink Wierd Harold  actually used the term "the lower-economic people" in the perjorative.  Dooood  (Averted gaze). Babs continues:  "They let me down, too, sometimes — like that girl at Wendy's who gave me sweet iced tea when I had clearly specified unsweetened. She looked a little tired, but, as Cos might point out: How hard can it be to hold a job, go to high school and care for younger siblings in all your spare moments while your parents are at work?"   Ouch , the beating continues, with studied and beautiful Thai kicks:  "But it's just so 1985 to beat up on the black poor. During the buildup to welfare 'reform' in 1996, the comfortable denizens of think spas like the Heritage Foundation routinely excoriated poor black women for being lazy, promiscuous, government-dependent baby machines, not to mention overweight (that poundcake again). As for poor black youth, they were targeted in the 90's as a generation of 'superpredators,' gang-bangers and thugs.  "It's time to start picking on a more up-to-date pariah group for the 21st century, and I'd like to nominate the elderly whites."   Hear-hear , Barbara Ehrenreich, you're on the right wavelength, girlfriend: I mean, there are lots of elderly whites hogging the Enteman's Pound Cakes, many of whom defend the Saudi Royal Family:   urlLink Grover Norquist  ... Grover Norquist ... talk about poundcakes ... Norquists got em.

       My Story: The Chuck Norris Story   America's favorite Republican karate champion  urlLink Chuck Norris' new biography  is on the verge of being published. According to  urlLink the National Enquirer , Norris scribblings get into his less-than-ideal backstory:  "'I want (my children) to see the struggles. I want them to understand that it hasn't been an easy road, but that anyone can achieve success in their lives if they keep their focus on their goals, work hard and never lose your faith in yourself or in God.'  " urlLink Chuck's  profits from the new book will be donated to  urlLink KICKSTART , an organization he founded to use the martial arts to build character in children in the schools.  "In his book Chuck tells how Carlos Ray Norris -- Chuck is a nickname -- was born dirt poor in Ryan, Okla. The book describes his father as an alcoholic, and chronicles his mother's struggles with menial jobs to raise her children."  That's kind of like our personal hero, Danny Laruso, who was born in Newark, New Jersey, and whose mother, Lucielle, did a little waitressing here and there so her son could attend a school where he regularly got the crap kicked out of him by the rich, arrogant Republican Cobra-Kai's (who, incidentally had the coolest terror-inducing skeleton outfits for Halloween).  "In fact, Chuck's very birth was a miracle -- he was born a 'blue baby' and had to be placed on oxygen from birth.  "After high school Norris joined the Air Force and was stationed in Korea, where he discovered karate. The grueling five-hour daily practice sessions taught him to stick it out, no matter how hard the task."  Yeah, that's kind of like  urlLink Daniel-san , who "discovered" karate from a wise old Mr. Miyage (played adventurously by the late, great  urlLink Pat Morita , of Happy Days fame) after Daniel-San sets up a water hose in Aryan  urlLink Cobra-Kai leader  Johnny's bathroom stall, totally fucking up his righteous "joint," (the concentration that kid put into it was commendable) precipitating in another major ass whipping, in a lonely abandoned field. Miyage intervenes at the last moment, saving Daniel-San from a sign splitting kick from Johnny, and, in the end, teaching him some special Okinawa-style karate. In the second movie Peter Cetera sings  urlLink 'Glory of Love,'  which is the beginning of the end of the 80s.  "Discharged from the Air Force and with a wife and child to support, Chuck opened a karate school in Torrance, Calif. He entered a karate tournament, hoping to win and pick up more students for his school -- but he lost!"  This is like the charismatic Mr. Kreese, dojo leader of the Cobra-Kai's, with that very 80s cleft in his chin ("We do not train to be merciful here, mercy is for the weak. A man confronts you in the street he is your enemy. An enemy deserves no mercy.").   "'Instead of giving up, though, I began to struggle, to train harder and to pray a lot,' he recalled. 'I learned that the only time you lose is when you don't learn from your failures.'"  Chuck is so Republican, with that admirable formula of struggle-to-succeed, it's a very Cobra-Kai philosophy, witness Mr. Kreese ("Fear does not exist in this dojo, does it?/ No, Sensei/ Pain does not exist in this dojo, does it? /No, Sensei./ Defeat does not exist in this dojo, does it? /No, Sensei.")   "Chuck went on to become a six-time world karate champion. Then one day movie star Steve McQueen, who had brought his son Chad to Norris for karate lessons, suggested that Chuck try acting.  "'I thought he had to be kidding. I was 34 years old, with absolutely no acting experience. I started going to acting school. Here I was, starting from Ground Zero! But I was determined -- believe in what you want to do, and nothing can stop you.'"  Determination. That's the kind of determination Mr. Miyage showed when some inbred hilbillies placed their beers on his truck after Daniel-San had had that scenic karate in the sunset on the boat moment. ("Excuse me, please. Boy cold. Must leave. Kindly remove bottles. / Drunk: Kindry do it yourself, Mr. Moto./ Miyage sweeps the tops off the beer bottles with a single elegant thrust")   "Chuck's first movie  urlLink 'Good Guys Wear Black'  launched a career spanning 23 motion pictures and a hit television series.  "Now he's planning to film a new two-hour 'Walker, Texas Ranger' show soon in Dallas."  "Said Chuck: 'God never told me to retire.'"  Retiring reminds me of when Bobby is about to face Daniel in the semifinals ("Kreese: Bobby. I want him out of commission / Bobby: But Sensei I can beat this guy. /Kreese: I don't want him beaten. /Bobby: But I'll be disqualified. Kreese: Out of commission.")  Anyway, thanks for standing by me on this 80s flashback, check out Chuck's book.

       Will Kerry-Edwards Spurn Public Funding?    urlLink Klaus Marre of The Hill  writes an fascinating article today about the internal debate within the Kerry campaign as to whether or not they should even opt to go the public funding route, rife, as it is, with pitfalls and handicaps, especially when up against a well funded and corporate friendly incumbent:  "Some Democratic strategists and fundraisers say Sen. John Kerry should seriously consider opting out of public funding in his bid to defeat President Bush this fall.   "They maintain that Kerry's record fundraising efforts in the Democratic presidential primary show that the senator can reap more money through private contributions than through what the government would provide the campaign."  Add into the mix the fact that  urlLink John Edwards , a shot of adrenaline to the moribund campaign, the favorite of the  urlLink urban elites , is also a heavy duty fund raiser with trial lawyers and Hollywood types.       "Until now, it has been assumed that both Kerry and Bush would take the $75 million in public funds after they accept their respective nominations. But this places Kerry, who will be nominated five weeks prior to President Bush, at a significant disadvantage. He has to stretch his money for 14 weeks, an average of about $5 million per week, compared to Bush, who has nine weeks, an average of more than $8 million, to spend his public money."  A brilliant point. Considering the placement of the nomination acceptances, it is bad strategy to remain on "equal" footing with the Republicans; it's not their fault if they take advantage by running negative ads in high end markets that the Dems couldn't afford to counter -- it's just politics. And, remember, the sitting Vice President, Al  urlLink Gore ran out of money  against his challenger, GW Bush, leaving his spread eagle against attack ads at the end of 2000.  "This and Kerry's aggressive fundraising operation is leading some of his most prolific fundraisers and Democratic strategists to suggest that Kerry should take the historic step of forgoing public funds and keep raising money all the way to the Nov. 2 election.  "Since effectively clinching the Democratic nomination, Kerry has raised more than $30 million per month and a total of more than $180 million. That would easily put him on pace to raise more than $75 million until the election, especially because those Democratic donors who have given the maximum of $2,000 for his primary could contribute the same amount again. He has also raised an average of more than $10 million a month online, meaning it will take less administrative effort to bring  in these donations.  "In addition, Kerry would be allowed to transfer any remaining funds from the primary into his general-election campaign war chest. His last Federal Election Commission (FEC) filing showed that he had $27.7 million cash on hand while he was spending and raising money at about the same rate. Kerry would be precluded from transferring money to or raising it for his general-election campaign if he accepted public funds, but he could transfer it to the Democratic National Committee (DNC)."  We have to realize, though, before we get lost midway through life's journey in the thicket of money lust, that this type of calculation and, for Democrats,  salivation , over the prospect of campaign funding and cold hard cheddar -- soft and hard -- is a very, very sad development. The Democrats have gone from being an electorate demanding campaign finance reform to one  obsessed  with behaving exactly like their enemies, the Republicans. This only proves what social scientists like to call  urlLink The Iron law of Emulation , "Organizations in conflict tend to emulate one another." (For further reference, compare and contrast the  urlLink FBI's Cointelpro  counter intelligence program to silence internal political dissidents, at the height of the Cold War competition, in the 1960s, with the  urlLink KGB , who were, to be sure, more openly hostile, but still, strikingly similar). But how did we get off on that particular tangent?  "Should Kerry decide to opt out, eclipsing $75 million should not be a problem, according to some of his 'Vice Chairs,' individuals who raised more than $100,000 for the campaign.  "Vice Chair and lobbyist Manuel Ortiz said Kerry's camp should 'take a really hard look at [opting out].' He said Kerry's decision to opt out of public funding for the primary was one of the best the campaign has made.   "At a time when he was running far behind former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, Kerry decided to forgo matching funds in order not to be tied to a $45 million primary spending limit. Had he not opted out, Kerry would be lagging $170 million behind Bush in primary funds."   True , this was probably the bold decision which factored seriously into Iowa voters calculation of a Kerry vote after Gephardt and Dean imploded; punching each other out.   "Ortiz said he would support Kerry's opting out, especially because donors who have maxed out in the primary would be allowed to give money again.  "Asked about the possibility of keeping up the fundraising pace if Kerry opts out, John Coale, a Vice Chair and Washington, D.C., attorney, said: 'If he wants us to do it, we'll do it,' adding that it is just a matter of 'getting the list of $2,000 donors and getting on the phone again.'"  Can anyone say: Hollywood? Can anyone say  urlLink Arianna Huffington fundraiser ? Can anyone say  urlLink Susan and Alan Patricof ?  urlLink Barbara Streisand ?  urlLink John Bon Jovi ?  P Diddy and Russell Simmons? Oh, it's  on  like Gray Poupon!  "Vice Chair  Robert Clifford , an Illinois lawyer, said the Kerry campaign should consider all options but pointed out that not accepting taxpayer funds would 'siphon money' from other Democratic candidates and the DNC. 'Hard dollars are hard to come by,' he said, and a decision to opt out could have a 'downward impact' on the ticket. 'We might be putting too many eggs in one basket,' Clifford said."  Prudent.   "Tony Coelho, former campaign chairman for Vice President Al Gore, said that there are 'legitimate reasons' not to take public funds and that Kerry would eclipse $75 million if he continued raising funds, but added that there could be a 'big negative' politically as 'pro-[Ralph] Nader people would seize on it.'"  Eminently logical and valid. This would be a Christmas present to that fucker, Ralph Nader -- a validation that there is no difference between the two parties ... hey, maybe ... he ... has ... a point?  "Nader has said that the two major parties are too similar and beholden to corporate interests. Opting out and taking millions of additional campaign contributions, even if a lot of the money would come from small online donors, could fuel those type of attacks.  "Coelho said Nader's criticisms on this issue could especially come into play in states such as New Hampshire and Florida, where Nader collected more votes in 2000 than Bush's margin of victory over Gore."   Motherfuck!   "Others said that if Kerry would opt out, so could Bush and his massive fundraising machine. A Democratic official said, 'People forget that every action has an equal or more powerful reaction. Basic high-school chemistry. If Kerry opted out, why wouldn't Bush?'"  Okay, I was with you there along for the ride, Tony, until you fucked up and had to pretend that you knew science as well as politics on 'Every action has an equal and opposite reaction,' which is decidedly not chemistry, O Master of the Universe, but  physics , specifically,  urlLink Newton's Third Law of Motion . But I get the point.  "Coelho said the Kerry campaign, prior to making its decision on whether to opt out, should put pressure on Bush to find out if he plans to forgo public funding. The Bush campaign has said it would accept public funding."  A fine idea. You won me back, Tony.  "In May, the Kerry campaign hinted that he might delay the date on which he would accept the Democratic nomination in order to keep raising money. He backed away from that plan quickly. At the time, the campaign said it was looking into other options to make up for having to stretch its general-election funds for an additional five weeks.  " urlLink Lanny Davis , a former special counsel to President Clinton and now a partner with  urlLink Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe , also said that Kerry should consider all options but needs 'a public commitment' from Bush regarding the president's intentions or otherwise should be 'very skeptical.'   " Scott Stanzel , a Bush-Cheney campaign spokesman, said a public pledge is not needed because the campaign has maintained all along that it will accept public funding and 'nothing has changed.'"  Now this is interesting. So, the President will have $75 million after he accepts the nod, leaving Kerry the option to forgo the funding and become a Republican on campaign finance, or, should he accept the same deal, be handicapped.  "The Kerry campaign declined to comment for this article."  I'm sure that's because they are  urlLink bewildered  by the prospects before them.  The game's afoot.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  urlLink Hugh Grant , that lucky fucking dog; He who we once thought of as an ass -- Hughdie dodged the  urlLink Elizabeth Hurley  bullet, managed to parlay his little "hooker episode" into a career as  urlLink the suave bad guy , as opposed to the boring Merchant-Ivory wag whom Midwestern housewives pine after; and now,  urlLink mirabile dictu , Grant is moving in on to financial security with jet set heiress  urlLink Jemima Goldsmith , easily one of the best looking women in the world.  urlLink Make us proud, Hugh , at least, according to  urlLink British Vogue :  "NEWLY-SINGLE Jemima Goldsmith and eternal bachelor Hugh Grant were again spotted at the same event last night, adding fuel to the rumours currently doing the rounds that the pair may be about to become an item. They arrived separately at  urlLink David Frost's annual garden party , a regular feature of the summer social scene, at which other glamorous attendees included  urlLink Elle Macpherson  and  urlLink Sienna Miller . Pictured for the first time since her divorce from Imran Khan became public, Jemima looked ice cool and elegant in white lace. Grant was less so as he was pictured rushing in, his face set into something of a grimace. The stunning heiress was first linked to the actor after they were spotted enjoying a night on the tiles at London club Annabel's (named after Jemima's mother,  Lady Annabel Goldsmith ), last month, shortly before Jemima's divorce was announced. Grant has been linked with a string of glamorous women since his split from long-term love Elizabeth Hurley, but remains resolutely single. As Jemima is now back on the singles market herself, perhaps we should watch this space."  Perhaps.   Out :  urlLink Dan Rather .  urlLink Why is this thus ? What is the purpose of this thusness? Why is Dan Rather a network news anchor? According to  urlLink Drudge :  "JENNINGS FIGHTS BACK, BEATS BROKAW: ABC 'WORLD NEWS' TOPS NBC 'NIGHTLY' FOR WEEK ENDING JULY 2, ALL 3 ANCHORS REPORTED FROM IRAQ ...  "JENNINGS 8,630,000 VIEWERS"  "BROKAW 8,290,000"  "DAN RATHER 6,720,000"   What's the frequency? I'll tell you what the frequency is, true believer: nearly two million less viewers, that's what; Dan Rather isn't even really competitive.   In :  Demi Moore . According to  urlLink Jeanette Walls' Scoop :  "'(Regarding) Fahrenheit 9/11' ...  one celeb has already weighed in with an unofficial rave. A source was sitting behind  Demi Moore  and  Ashton Kutcher  at the Hollywood premiere and says that Moore was 'really, really vocal' throughout the Bush-bashing documentary."   The Corsair  could make a crass but sly remark, scoring cheap points with regards to Moore being "vocal," but he will refrain, withholding satisfaction, lying in wait for the big payoff:   "'She was hollering and cheering at the screen and yelling things at Bush,' says the source. 'And she was pumping the air with her fist and saying things like,  That was really harsh  and  That was really crucial . '"  What a coincidence, says  The Corsair , slowly removing his red velvet gloves, pouring himself a glass of  urlLink aged champagne , a reptilian-predatory look about his eyes. What a coincidence  indeed , why ( The Corsair  smiles, wanly), when I first saw the  urlLink E! True Hollywood Story, the Demi Moore edition , I, too (Averted gaze), pumped my fists in the air, yelling, 'That Was Really Harsh," when Demi dumped her husband Freddy Moore, because he was not famous enough for her liking.   And, what's more, I, too, spoke to my tv screen, saying 'That was really crucial,' when Demi's trailer park mom began selling secrets of her past to the highest tabloid bidder ( The Corsair  softly chuckles, followed by a small closing cough of feigned detachment)    Out : Oh, sweet Jesus, nononono (hits his screen) no -- this is just fucking disgusting;  urlLink Rush and Molloy  have entirely wrecked my appetite for lunch:  "Macy Gray performed in nothing but a pair of Jimmy Choo shoes Monday night for the Elton John AIDS Foundation in London. Mercifully, for those of us who never really wanted to see her naked, Gray kept her privates concealed behind a chair."   The Corsair  shivers uncontrollably at the thought of Macy Gray's "privates"  Dreadful, simply ghastly, really: Someone call the EPA Administrator, because this is naught else but pure pollution.   In :  urlLink Jessica Alba . I have a ( The Corsair  makes quotation marks with his fingers out of thin air) "love jones" after  Jessica Alba . Such a little hottie. If I had an interview with her -- which is technically impossible, unless  Little Miss Jessica  rescinds this little restraining order -- it would go something like this:   The Corsair : Jessica, may I call you Jessica?   Alba : Yes ..   The Corsair:  (Shivers)   Alba : So, what do you want to know?   The Corsair : Do you have any black in you? You have a sexy, dark look.   Alba : No.   The Corsair : (suggestively) Do you  want  some black in you?  Two burly members of Alba's entourage attack  The Corsair .   Out : Et tu, Coco, et tu. The craziest story I've heard in a while, about former waif  urlLink Irene Cara , former star of Fame and DC Cab, and former "girlfriend" (wink of wink)of Warren Beatty:  "Twenty-four years ago, starring in the movie 'Fame,' Irene Cara promised us that she would live forever.  "Now she may be trying to fulfill that dream. A recent dispute over the correct birth date for the 40-to-45-year-old Cara is just the latest example of an age-old debate in the parallel universe called celebrity.  "It seems the famous are as scared as always of getting old. And publicists, eager to please their clients, are still fibbing to keep their starlets young.  "Cara, whose real name is Irene Escalera, says she was born March 18, 1964. But several media outlets, including The Associated Press, have her birth date as March 18, 1959.  "Cara's publicist, Bernie Roswig, recently called The AP requesting a correction on the year to 1964. But voter registration records from Florida, where she lives, have her birth year as 1959.  "'There is no one more sensitive about their age than Irene,' said Roswig. 'But she is adamant she was born in 1964. I can't explain the voting record, and there's no way she wants to talk about it.'"  crazy. How disturbing was that scene when the pornographer said to the whimpering Coco, 'Et tu.'   In : And I've been terrible about spreading the love to these two sites I read daily and love -- probably more than I love Jessica Alba, but that forbidden love is rife with all sorts of perversions that ... I'd really rather not get into here:  urlLink Old Hag  and  urlLink Miu Von Furstenberg . I couldn't get through the day without you.

       Michael Douglas' Brother Found Dead   Sure, Catherine Zeta Jones' endlessly flowing rubies and emeralds make a swell story, and Michael Douglas' battle with sex addiction has been well chronicled, but there is a darker side to being one of the lesser luminaries of the Douglas clan, as  urlLink Hello! Magazine tells us , sadly:  "One of America's most celebrated showbiz dynasties is in mourning after Eric Douglas was found dead in New York. The body of Kirk Douglas' youngest son was discovered in a Manhattan apartment after an unidentified individual flagged down a passing police car.  "The cause of death remains unknown, but 46-year-old Eric had a long history of substance abuse and police at the scene said they believed drugs were involved. Over the years the stand-up comedian had repeated clashes with the law and spent time in rehabilitation clinics."  May he finally find the rest he searched for in this life.

       The NY Tabloid Gossip Wars   Brandusa Niro's Fashionweekdaily has been aggressively covering what may rightly be called "The Gossip Wars," as they increasingly involve many of the major media players as well as stars like Howard Stern and nonentities like  Douglas Dechert  and New York Press editor-in-sleep,  Jeff Koyen .  Today,  urlLink The Daily Spy's war reporting notes :  "New York magazine scribe  urlLink Vanessa Grigoriadis  is making progress on her chronicle of  urlLink the Ian Spiegelman saga , which has evolved into a story about  urlLink New York's gossip wars , specifically the NY Post vs. the NY Daily News."  This War, by the way, which makes the World War I look puny in comparison, has, at various times, snagged such media luminaries as  urlLink Abigail Vona ,  urlLink Billy Bush  of Access Hollywood (2nd item, link via  urlLink Gawker ), Vanity Fair's  urlLink Frank DiGiacomo  (3rd item),  urlLink Howard Stern and Beth Ostrowsky ,  urlLink AJ Benza , and, of course, Page Six and Lloyd Grove.    Like World War I, it was caused, in large part, by arms escalation as well as a breaking of Bismarkian-like treaties. The competition between the Daily News gossip columnist (from back in the day) and Page Six is a New York tradition (remember Mitchell Fink?). Usually the feud ends with the Sixers being magnanimous. When Lloyd Grove got Ian Spiegelman fired, though, things escalated. And now Girgoriades, DiGiacomo, et al are being called in:  "Grigoriadis, who is being assisted in her duties by New Yorks loose cannon/Intelligencer helper  urlLink Jacob Bernstein , has had in-depth talks with the major players both in the  urlLink Spiegelman  set-to and the New York gossip world in general. Though cooperation has been forthcoming, the subjects should beware: New York magazine editor  urlLink Adam Moss  is no fan of gossip and has all but eradicated it from his own publication, so he may have little compunction about making everyone involved look like sleazy dirt merchants.  In any case, New York will scoop Vanity Fairs Frank DiGiacomo, who has been working on a gossip piece of his own.  We hear Spiegelmans newfound free-time has improved his work habits; hes said to have lined up a gig with music mag Blender and is also making headway on the manuscript of his second book, which has a bit of a roman a clef element, were told, including scenes set at his former workplace."  To borrow from the guy in the hockey mask from Mad Max, "... just walk away ..."

       USA: Waif Nation    The Corsair  is not just a cute Ugandan-born blogger making his way through this city. Nooooo; you're  so  not catching the full effect of this revolutionary thing that I'm trying to do here.  The Corsair  is also a social anthropologist of the highest order, a sort of Amateur sociologist supreme ... well,  okay , but I'm still good at it and I have a degree in the social sciences, so you  better recognize . Of course, when a trend emerges, a vexing trend, something new and vaguely threatening,  The Corsair  comes out of the wilderness, web shooters at the ready, to explain it to the waiting blogosphere at large. With snark. And a dash of wit. Sometimes I do this slightly drunk as I am particularly good at analysing social trends after the eighth tumbler of Cutty Sark. So much the better. For me, at least, anyhoo.    So , let me let you in on a new trend, true believers: all the rage, au courant, if you will, and it rises with the fortunes of Senator John Edwards. The Waif, people. Edwards is a waif; not a Kucinich waif -- actually, The Kuc is more Elfin -- but a waif, to be sure. Independent film is tres bohemian; Obscure independent ethnic films with subtitles (for further reference, see the  urlLink Film Forum's Ingmar Bergman Film Festival ) is waif -- as in, "didn't Ethan Hawke waiver on attending a screening?" .  urlLink Prius ? Waif.  urlLink The waifs  are back ... those small, thin people are ruling the media.  You know what a waif is now, don't you? Those slim, adorable, youthful Peter Pan-types (Michael Moore is an exception) who "won't grow up," what with their idealistic politics, and those large, liquid, Japanese anime-like eyes (awwwwww, can we keep 'em?).   They tend to pull off the scruffy, nurtured in the wilderness look; the men sporting goatees (The Ethan), or, in the case of Prince, "slave" insignias (what a meaningful facial statement) in places where models will kiss and notice. They are delicate, so don't hug them too hard, they might break.   Waifs tend to believe more in ideas and social justice than in money and power, often spurning social advancement on behalf of their integrity, causing Machiavellian Manhattan types to whisper, confused -- "what the fuck?!"  urlLink Paul Fussell  wrote about them as "Category X" in his masterpiece vivisection of American social life,  urlLink Class .  They lack appropriate body mass (look, for example, to  urlLink Fiona Apple  and Bob  urlLink Dylan  or even Daniel Day-Lewis) and are often vegans (Moby), eschewing feeding off another living animal, turning from what they call the cycle of "reciprocal maintenance" -- eating and being eaten, like at Hollywood Studios.   Others, to wit, may be devotees to really exotic and rare ethnic foods -- the more odd the better, as if, almost, to suggest that they are less physical than otherworldly creatures, influenced less by mundane gravity than by cosmic rhythms ("are you up for Mongolian today, guys"). They tend to like France (see  Johnny Depp ), almost in spite of how everyone else feels about the subject, and they believe in things like "solar power" and "international law" and "world government" ("suckers").   If they are not international celebrities (no such luck here) or artistically inclined (many are, some are not), they aspire to live in fashionable neighborhoods and gravitate towards jobs at "nonprofits," or arts managaement or radical politics and odd spiritual movements, like the Open Center in New York, or Esalen in California. Some also like vocations that bring them into contact with beauty and social beauty (Kate Moss).  God bless their naive, waifish hearts.  Here are some prominent waifs on the media radar:   urlLink Jesus Christ : Fashionable, thanks to  urlLink The Passion of the Christ . Eccentric. Against the status quo. Wore long hair, ranted against the moneychangers in the temple. Political idealist ("what's this mess about turning the other cheek?"). Probably was scruffy. Most influential waif.    urlLink Michael Jackson : Disgraced waif. Took that Peter Pan thing to a whole new level (Averted gaze).   urlLink Edgar Allan Poe : Eccentric waif. Inventor of The Detective Novel (Rue Morgue). Large bulbous headed geek god. Idolized by Fellini, more popular in Europe than in US. Like fellow waifs DH Lawrence and Virginia Woolfe, a spectacular, if unheralded, literary critic. Died under mysterious circumstances -- way ahead of the curve.   urlLink Ralph Nader : Bitter, iconoclastic waif.   urlLink Alanis Morissette : Sometimes  overly  revealing in her music. Crazy, perverted chick. Went down on some dude in ... a ... theater. Thanks for sharing. Canadian, maybe that's her problem.  urlLink Consults the Eiffel Tower for love advice . Freaky. Your typical Aquarius.   urlLink Richard Linklater : part of the waif Holy Trinity with quasi existentialist screenwriting buddies  urlLink Julie Delpy  and  urlLink Ethan Hawke .   urlLink Janine Garofalo : Unpredictable spitfire. Stalled budding indie film career in Hollywood by signing on as an unpaid Air America radio host. Ruined tv career by mentioning the lack of women at Saturday Night Live, and publicly taking on the Second Iraq War as  urlLink her pilot  was being checked out by ABC.   urlLink Marcel Proust : Liquid-eyed Patron Saint of waifs. The definitive chronicler of the waif-important subjects of consciousness and aristocracy.   Ge urlLink orge Stephanopoulos  and  urlLink Gwyneth Paltrow : The sell out waifs. Dropped the waif cred to sell out to "the man."   urlLink Dave Eggers : Scruffy object of affection from Williamsburg. McSweeny Collective founder.   urlLink Johnny Depp : Doesn't live in Hollywood; appears to value "fame" and "celebrity" about as much as he does a muggy afternoon. Will never sell out to "The Man," but likes to attack those who do, like  urlLink Nicholas Cage . Quirky roles; The Craft over Oscars. Lives in France. Bohemian.  urlLink Knocked up  galpal Vanessa Paradis at a "socially inappropriate" time.   urlLink Mozart : Youthful child prodigy. Died young. Patron saint. His music tends to be played at waif events.   urlLink Whit Stillman : Rare, dying breed: WASP waif, for further reference, see  urlLink Caulfield, Holden .   urlLink Christiane Amanpour : Though a recent mother of a young child, Christiane repeatedly goes into the thick of war zones to cover the War on terrorism. We love you Christiane, but  what the fuck ?!   urlLink Noah Baumbach : Next to  Wes Anderson  and Richard Linklater, the patron saint film director of waifs.   urlLink Uma Thurman : Named after a Buddhist goddess. Played an un waif-like karate killer.  Mitigating factor : The Bride was out for idealistic "Justice."   urlLink Joan Didion : Preternaturally thin essayist.  Resolved: Move over B-Listers. Waifs rock.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In : It's homecoming for the New York Times'  urlLink Cathy Horyn , according to  urlLink WWD's Miles Socha , it's all now, apparently,  de-lovely  between her and de Helmut:  "The Helmut Lang men’s show in Paris on Sunday represented a homecoming of sorts for  Cathy Horyn . Since October 2002, the designer has barred The New York Times critics from his shows, saying he simply didn’t like the paper’s point of view on fashion. Meanwhile, Horyn — who has described Lang’s women’s clothes as heavy, overthought and gimmicky in the past — said she was 'thrilled' to receive an invitation. 'Two years is a long time. Too long,' she said. Horyn is expected to review Lang’s show in a report on the Paris men’s shows today."   Too long  ... yes (pensive), women have said the same of  The Corsair  ( The Corsair  modestly averts his gaze and gives a Sphynx-like smile, arranging himself, elegantly, in three-quarter profile as the light catches a sly twinkle in his intelligent eyes as he tilts his head back and lets out a soft chuckle).     Out : Lunkheaded  urlLink Joey Tribbianni . Apparently the pilot episode of  urlLink NBC's Joey has been leaked on the web . That's bad. As a  urlLink Corsair , a pirate, however, I feel the need to alert you ("Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum") about this booty. And,  not that I advocate  anything of the sort, but a good place to look -- if you go in for that sort of thing (averted gaze), and I most certainly (feigned cough)  don't  -- might be the  urlLink FriendsCafe . But I'm not into that whole downloading of pilot episodes.  Besides , true believers, I'll bet there are still no black people. Even on the website purporting to have the pilot download.  Whatever .   In :  urlLink The New York Post . Not since that quixotic  urlLink Dewey Beat Truman photo , as the Post's detractors would have you believe, has there been a more egregious error in reporting;  urlLink rise up journos ,  urlLink fight , rise up  urlLink Alec Baldwin , rise up all those luminaries who have been pummelled by the Post!  Sheesh : Lighten up, guys, it's the summer; air out those shortpants; they made a mistake, actual human beings edit the Post, and, on the evening of a national holiday,  urlLink boo boos are made . And sure, this morning I was also "bewildered" (god, I love that word) about how a conservative leaning paper, such as the  urlLink Alexander Hamilton's Post , could gain such inside scoop into the Kerry thought process that neither NPR nor Air America had access to, they made a boo boo. Smile. Hold on to the copies, they are sure to become historical curios for media geeks, like us; hold up your copy proudly against your TV sets when Howie Kurtz does the inevitable  urlLink Reliable Sources  on the subject this Sunday upcoming. I still have love for you, NY Post. Or maybe I'm just kissing ass here on a galactic scale.   Out : M. Night Shyamalan is trying to hide his own secrets, according to  urlLink Rush and Molloy  today:  "The filmmakers say that, after hunting down childhood friends and neighbors, they uncovered what they called a  urlLink 'pivotal event'  in the life of the reclusive director, who was born in India and grew up in suburban Philadelphia.  "(Nathaniel)Kahn and (Callum)Greene say their subject grew upset by their questions and, after walking out of an interview, called in his lawyers to try to shut down the project.  "Originally slated to air last fall, it's now set for broadcast July 18.   "An ongoing legal struggle prevents the filmmakers from revealing Shyamalan's hidden past until then.  "'There's one secret that's surrounded by others,' Greene tells (Rush and Molloy). 'We felt that we were finding breadcrumbs through this forest and we followed them.'"    The Corsair  shivers.  "Shyamalan's rep didn't return a call."   The Corsair  shudders.   In :  urlLink British Vogue  has already swooped down on diva-in-training, Wimbeldon winner,  urlLink Maria Sharapova , the coolest 17-year old in the world; I wish she's let some of the "cool dust" that covers her blow my way:  " MARIA SHARAPOVA  may have only just hit the celebrity big time, but she's already proved herself worthy of fashion note. The 17-year-old Wimbledon winner had Louis Vuitton open especially for her on Sunday so that she could choose an outfit for the Champions' Dinner in the evening. While she was there, she chose a red mini skirt and pink top to wear while watching Roger Federer conquer Andy Roddick in the men's final, and for the evening she accessorised a cream chiffon and satin evening dress with jewelled shoes, a turquoise Theda evening bag and chandelier earrings. '[She] is an absolute advertiser's dream,' PR expert Max Clifford said of Sharapova, who has vowed to buy herself a silver Porsche and her parents a BMW each with her ($ 1,025,000) prize money. 'In 10 years, she could earn ($183 million). It is the kind of rags to riches story we love.'"   Pardon me,  urlLink Allegra , But:  When is she legal again?    Out : Jessica Alba and Derek Jeter, according to that significant cultural artifact  urlLink Star Magazine :  "New York Yankee Derek Jeter is hitting it big with Honey actress  urlLink Jessica Alba . The baseball captain, 30, hooked up with the hotter-than-hot actress on June 18 at Hollywood's Spider Club, where they partied until 1 a.m.  "The next day, the couple spent most of the evening paired up at Hollywood's XES club at a corner table. 'She was touching him, flirting with him and totally batting her eyes at him,' says an eyewitness. Once again, the pair stayed until the early morning hours -- leaving separately only to reunite at his black SUV in the parking lot. After two dates with Alba, 23, Jeter's Yankees lost two out of three games to the L.A. Dodgers. Hmm, too many late nights, Derek?  "A source tells Star that the couple rendezvoused the last time the Yanks were in California to play the Anaheim Angels in May. 'Jessica picked up Derek in her car after each game,' says the source. 'They stayed at the Hilton Anaheim, and they were always making out in the hallways.'   So, I'm playa hating. So what? Alba is so hott, it's outrageous; how was I supposed to know that shorty was serious about the restraining order. Jeter beat me to it. Alba likes her black men rich, cafe au lait, and unsung in the blogosphere, or so it would appear. Her loss. Jessica ...  call me ?

       Will Harvey Bolt the Mouse House?   That other  urlLink short fingered vulgarian  Harvey Weinstein of Miramax, according to those wonderful  urlLink Page Sixers , "is likely to bolt from the highly successful movie studio he founded as early as this week."   Damn .  Although  urlLink Bertolluci decribed Harv  as "the Sadaam Hussein of cinema,"  The Corsair  prefers to think of him as more  urlLink Baby Doc-like , with the Begian Chateaux exit strategy as an exercisable option, u  urlLink nah mean ?    urlLink Mirablile Dictu , Those  urlLink fabulous Sixers :  "Under the plan being considered, Weinstein would leave to start his own movie company and Miramax would distribute his films, sources say. Harvey's brother and Miramax co-founder Bob Weinstein is expected to stay at the company, where he runs Dimension Films, a Miramax division that focuses on medium-budget action and horror films. Another possible outcome is for the Weinsteins to buy the entire Miramax studio back, although Eisner has been telling associates he doubts the brothers would be able to raise the money.   "As  urlLink PAGE SIX previously reported , one scenario being discussed is for  urlLink Weinstein  and  urlLink Pixar Animation Studios chief Steve Jobs  to team up and make a run for MGM, the studio that is on the block for about $5 billion.   "Weinstein is also close to investment banker Steve Rattner, and many in the media industry have speculated that he may take a role in backing Weinstein."  Here's a little something I wrote in January:  For years  urlLink I have dogged Michael Eisner's Simian ass .  He has been  ridiculous  in his dealings with  Pixar , which is the centerpiece, nay,  the pearl  of  urlLink Disney's animation  operation.  In point of fact , it is on the backs on profits eked from it's parasitic deal with Pixar that Eisner -- who holds onto the reins of power at Disney ("my  preciousss ") with the  urlLink tenacity of an African dictator  --  urlLink still has a fucking job .  Eisner was playing the prototypical  overmanly  Hollywood Power Player game -- talk tough,  urlLink concede nothing , bully, hector and, when all else fails, threaten lawsuit -- on  Steve Jobs . You know, in Power Player fashion he was just fucking with Job's' head.   Why?   Dont ask me; The Corsair is rather naive waif on these matters, prefering  urlLink Augustine's red-bronze caritas  to  urlLink Nietzsche's  dark sepia-colored struggle-of-the-fittest devisings. But now Eisner, the rat who may sink Disney, has handed over to his competition a  sorely needed asset . And what would happen (takes out  The Corsair's  infamous crystal ball, spinkles some Haitian herbs, and says some juju) if Steve Jobs hammers out a deal with, oh, say ---  Jeffrey Katzenberg's   urlLink SKG ? Huh? What then, fucker?   I'll tell you what : Eisner's ego will have given his arch nemesis --  urlLink "the midget"  -- the tool needed to break Disney's animation back. Pixar's every victory over Disney will be fussed over by the Hollywood press and agonized over by shareholders who lost out becuase Eisner was looking out for his ego.  I could  easily  see Steve Jobs being  that vengeful a motherfucker  and SKG offering a very sweet deal indeed to indulge him. A sweet deal for Jobs but a bitter one for Eisner and a Cruella de Ville of a nightmare for Eisner's shareholders.  Indeed.

       Martha: "Look at Nelson Mandela ..."   &nbsp;  Last night, according to  urlLink CVTv  -- I was out drinking -- "Martha, Martha Martha" Stewart compared herself, rather quixotically,&nbsp;to  urlLink Nelson Mandela :  &nbsp;  "Being interviewed by Barbara Walters on ABC Friday night, domestic diva Martha Stewart, who's been sentenced to five months in prison, compared herself to South African hero Nelson Mandela who spent 27 years in prison for his anti-apartheid beliefs.  'There are many, many good people who have gone to prison,' Stewart said. 'Look at Nelson Mandela.'"  &nbsp;  But the best lines are reserved for  urlLink the ABC web site , which says, almost tongue in cheek, the soft chuckles escaping:  &nbsp;  "When asked how she would handle prison food, fellow inmates and strip searches, she said, 'I could do it … I'm a really good camper. I can sleep on the ground ...&nbsp;If it is looming ahead of me, I'm going to have to face it, and take it and do it and get it over with. And there's many other people that have gone to prison. Look at Nelson Mandela.'"  &nbsp;  Glad to know that Martha can sleep on the ground and endure the meat surprise, but, of course, now we know that&nbsp;she won't have to: her bed will do just fine. The Mandela reference, however,&nbsp;escapes us entirely.  Entirely !  &nbsp; How does 27 years&nbsp;of boinb locked down on Robben's island, in the punishing "C-Section,"&nbsp;&nbsp;in the struggle for racial equality relate,&nbsp;even remotely  --remotely  -- compare&nbsp;to five months of home confinement and&nbsp;a $30,000 fine for her role in a stock deal gone awry?  &nbsp;  ABC continues:  &nbsp;  "During the trial, for example, the press scrutinized her wardrobe and suggested that she appeared arrogant and haughty to the jury. Even  urlLink her choice of handbags  was noted, particularly a Hermes Birkin handbag, said to cost at least $6,000.   "Stewart said the focus on her handbag was unfair. 'Do you know that that is my only handbag. Do you know that? Do you know how many handbags I own? And that I bought that handbag I think it was 12 or 14 years ago. I bought that for myself when I felt successful enough to buy a beautiful handbag. And it did not cost $6,000 12 or 14 years ago.'"&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Why is it that right about now I feel as if I was just scolded by one of those  urlLink Fifth Avenue Ladies Who Lunch  because I almost stepped on her pet lapdog, as she was in between "shopping adventures"?

       A Little of the Old In and Out       In:   urlLink Fashionweekdaily's Daily Spy  is all over the gossip at David Pecker's American Media:   "The latest staffer to says sayonara to  urlLink Bonnie Fuller at Star magazine  is Nathan Cooper, the popular senior editor and former Harper's Bazaar scribe, who added  urlLink a dash of glamour  to the tabloid and was in charge of all its events coverage. Cooper is signing on to American Media rival Bauer Publishing's (In Touch  parent) upcoming celeb mag launch, Life & Style Weekly, set to debut in November."    urlLink Fashionweekdaily continues :   " ... JUST ASKING: Meanwhile, while we usually leave  urlLink guessing Page Six blind items to our friends at other (delicious) websites , the lead riddle today can't pass without comment.  Could it be that the former American Media exec, who's this close to filing a lawsuit, is Richard Valvo, the gravelly-voiced AMI PR man, who saw chief David Pecker through many a media crisis? Valvo was ousted by Bonnie Fuller, who first brought in hapless flack, XXXXXX, to assume Valvo's duties vis-à-vis Star before she poached astute Stu Zakim from rival Us Weekly.    Out : The Northeast political landscape is changing, lightening fast. First,  urlLink Connecticut   Governor Rowland was ousted . Now, New Jersey Governor  urlLink Jim McGreevey is feeling the heat . New York State Assembly Speaker  urlLink Sheldon Silver is under fire , spending $15,000 to counter charges of corruption. And, finally, completing the labyrinth of Northeast corridor power players,  urlLink Joseph Bruno is being dumped by the Conservative line . That's not even to mention Andrea Bernstein important public radio piece this week on, as  urlLink the NPR site describes :   "In late 2002 word began to emerge that New York City Correction Department employees were working on Republican political campaigns -- often while on-duty. Now, in the WNYC News documentary: Politics and Punishment on Rikers Island, Andrea Bernstein takes a close look how and why jail supervisors organized hundreds of their employees as campaign foot soldiers - in apparent violation of city law. "   Read the transcript of this important program  urlLink here .   The old order changes. But what will arise to  urlLink fill the vacuum ?    In:  According to  urlLink British Vogue's  News Bites:   " urlLink LULU GUINNESS  this week welcomed guests at her Bleecker Street boutique in New York to honour her participation in Contreau's ' urlLink Cointreauversial ' ad campaign. Warmed by Guinness' sangria (a powerful mixture of Remy Martin, Piper Heidsick, Cointreau, grape juice and fruit) and snacks from Da Silvano, guests including  urlLink Charlotte Ronson ,  urlLink Lucy Sykes  and her pregnant sister Alice spilled out of the tiny boutique and onto the sidewalk. Fifteen per cent of the sales inside were donated to Safe Space, a New York City charity for underprivileged and abused children. "     Out : As  urlLink The Defamer  lets us know in his world weary been-there-done-her Hollywwod oily but cool manner that, yes, the  B-Listers  are different than us, dear reader, the  C-Listers  ( The Corsair  lets out a melancholy,  urlLink Charlie Brown-like Autumnal sigh ).:   " urlLink Wizbang  deconstructs the battle plan of former Survivor contestant/VH1 host Jenna Lewis once her  urlLink sex video showed up for sale on the internet . [Ed.note--Lewis is steadfastly C-list. She couldn't get on the B-list if she was filmed giving Vin Diesel a reacharound.] You are a B-list celebrity... A wedding night porn video of you has just hit the Internet, and now you are expected to go into damage control mode. Some wonder whether you secretly engineered the release. How should your PR firm respond?  "1. Issue a press release weeks after the video debuts.  "2. Make sure everyone knows that you are not happy about the video appearing on the Internet.  "3. Plug the site carrying the video that you are 'fighting mad' over. "   And how would an A lister handle it?  "Naturally, if you're an A-list celebrity in a  urlLink boring, harmless titty video , your first move is to send scary cease-and-desist letters."    Too  true.    In : God, I love me some  urlLink LA.com's blog  and their blind items. To wit:   "What gives with that edgy, eccentric and insanely well paid star? Years of movies and TV have made him so incredibly rich, he never has to work another day in his life if he doesn’t damn well feel like it. He’s always got an amazingly hot young thing clinging to his hunky arm and, careerwise, seems to be on top of the world. But yet waiters hate to see him walk into a restaurant because he tips as if he’s down to his last dime. He dresses like a rag man, constantly clips newspaper coupons--and the rare times he shops, it’s only at sales and thrift shops. Although he lives in a fabulous old LA spread, most of the rooms are completely empty. His parsimonious ways have cost him more than a few friends and several famous girlfriends. Jeez guy, cut loose with a buck once in awhile, will you?"   Everyone on the board is saying Keanu Reeves, but this guy has barely done tv. I think it's someone else.    Out : Okay,  urlLink this Rance fellow  -- you know, the celebrity blogger -- he's starting to get on my nerves, what, with that whimsyish dialog;  The Corsair  does not fancy whimsy ... it is redolent of ...  whim :   "I’m always interested by why people are late. Be it an important meeting, a doctor’s appointment, a wedding, there’s always a story there."    What the fuck ? Can't you almost imagine that cloying Andy Rooney voice, except without the mitigating factors of age or Cute Old Man as variables. I think it's time to organize a little blogiverse beat down, n'est ce-pas?

       The Best of The Corsair     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   urlLink The Corsair's Remote Control Tour Diary   &nbsp;   urlLink USA: Waif Nation   &nbsp;   urlLink An Interview With John Kerry's Hair   &nbsp;   urlLink Mia Farrow's Mission     &nbsp;    urlLink 70s tv    &nbsp;    urlLink Dick Morris vs Bill Clinton    &nbsp;   urlLink 2003&nbsp;Corsair Year End Awards   &nbsp;   urlLink Tyson vs. Snipes   &nbsp;   urlLink RZA is Crazy     &nbsp;    urlLink McCain and Kerry    &nbsp;   urlLink Diana Vreeland Loved Soul Train   &nbsp;   urlLink On George Stephanopoulos&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;   urlLink Samuel Jackson's Subway Nightmare   &nbsp;   urlLink Trump Loves Pennies    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;   And this raucous rant (I was so much better in the old days, no?):     &nbsp;  Out:  urlLink Luciano Pavarotti . Not a fan. Never was. He was cheesy. So, I'll "excavate" an old blog, from December 13, 2003, that tells my feelings better than I could myself:  &nbsp;  Right off the bat I am not going to say that I am a fan of Opera as a species, per se, although the early operas of Monteverdi have moved me, what with their odd sense of acceleration of pace and repetitions of phrase. I have found myself caught in the funk, so to speak, on those occasions, and have been known to move my midsection vigorously, to oscillate wildly, like Courtney Cox in that godawful  urlLink Springsteen video .  Whatever.     &nbsp;  Not that Luciano Pavarotti would ever include Early Music in his pre-processed cheesy repertoire. So, as you can guess, I do not see the need for his physical coming-to-be in Western Civilization, although I am vaguely aware that he actually does exist. He's big with bored housevives in the Midwest, isn't he?  &nbsp;   Anyhoo : The big man  urlLink got all pimped out  for his wedding to his 30-year old ex-secretary, Nicoletta Mantovani (ed note: this is from December 2003). How cliche is that, anyway?  &nbsp;  And with The Corsair, the only sins are sins of cliche ... and tackiness ... and Pavarotti is the king of tackiness; his tack is very very nessy. We like to call him Louche-iano Pavaratti, in my little media precinct of one. The dyed jet-black beard is highly implausible, my sweet readers -- highly! --and that fake ever-present smile (sotto voce) so fake, creeps us out. And then there's that cheesy Three Tenors video where Arnold Shwarzenegger sits in the front row, fairly busting out his tuxedo, applauding loudly, sweet, sweet sophisticated readers: That was the moment that Oswald Spengler so tragically predicted, rendered agonically in Decline of the West. Yuck!Reuters reports:  &nbsp;  "'Alice joyfully invites you to the wedding of daddy Luciano and mummy Nicoletta,' read the invitation from the couple's 11-month-old daughter."  &nbsp;   Ababymommy . They continue:  &nbsp;  "A host of stars, including Irish rocker Bono and Italian singer Zucchero, turned out for the wedding which was eagerly anticipated by Italian gossip magazines and television chat shows."  &nbsp;  Well, if Zucchero was there, then it must indeed have been the thing to do on that particular evening.  &nbsp;  But the true story -- and The Corsair is nothing if not a bloodhound on the search for scoop -- lies with Adua, jilted wife number one.  &nbsp;  Somewhere the  urlLink well-paid Adua  is speaking of things Pavarotti from behind clenched teeth and making broad and fast arm movements as is the Italian manner when emotional issues are involved. And boy would I like a translator to decipher that scoop.  &nbsp;  Because we all understand the language of jilt. What? You mean you've never excavated the archaeology of "dumped"? It's just me being bitter? Okay (gets highly agitated) ... :  whatever .

       Lionel Ritchie and Lenny Kravitz: Kicking Ass and Taking Names   According to the  urlLink 3 AM Girls , affable pop balladeer  urlLink Lionel Ritchie  and his more hard edged, "aromatic" hombre,  urlLink Lenny Kravitz  came to the UK to chew bubblegum and kick ass; and guess what? --  they are all out of bubblegum :  "FORGET about Spider-Man and his superhero pals... there's a new crime-fighting duo in town.  "Swanky nightclub  urlLink Chinawhite  was on the verge of descending into a frenzy of flying fists on Monday night.  "But, before World War Three could break out, in swooped a couple of unlikely heroes to save the day.  "So, which mild-mannered celebrities saved a naughty record exec from a savage beating?  "None other than Lionel 'The Rocket' Richie and laid-back lothario Lenny 'The Loins' Kravitz."   The Corsair  shouts over the cheering crowd, "It's  On !!! It's On Like Gray Poupon!!"  "Our spy at the West End venue said: 'Trouble started when a man approached this record exec and accused him of making a move on his girlfriend. He was furious. He reckoned the exec had been getting hot and heavy with his other half.  "'Who knows if it was true or not, but he seemed convinced.  "'He was devastated.'"   The Corsair  grabs some unsalted popcorn and is riveted to the screen.  "According to our source the furious guy landed a couple of nasty punches on his love rival, including a belter to his beak."  "'Kerpow!! Like a latter-day Batman and Robin we hear (Lionel Ritchie and Lenny Kravitz) kicked the troublemaker straight into touch."   No-fucking-way ; how cool is that?

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In : Liquid Generation says that  urlLink Lindsay Lohan is a Drunken Wreck  (this evil, evil little link comes from Hell via  urlLink Defamer ). Hey, she's 18 now; that's our defense and we're sticking to it.   Out :  urlLink Scott Stereogum's Mandy Moore photo  ... so choice, I highly recommend it.    In :  urlLink Catwoman  is going to be such the stinker on a truly  galactic scale that I think I just might go,  you know , to see the carnage, like people's eyes bleeding and people fleeing Loews with their hands covering their noses. It stars box office jinx  urlLink Sharon Stone  and Oscar winner Halle Berry in the  urlLink worst-looking superhero headgear ever , on the cause of Halle's hair vanity.  urlLink Defamer  weighs in:  "Surefire Sign That Your Movie Marketing Department Is About Ten Minutes From Mass Suicide: The last-ditch recruitment of Barbie to promote your lite S&M stinker to the last demographic not poisoned by your movie's negative hype, seven-year-old girls."  Oh, this is going to be sooo bad. Let me get this straight: Halle, in shredded leather pants and a midriff-baring bustier, beats up musclebound baddies? Hmmm.  Highly Implausible  ...   Out : Those merry  urlLink Page Sixers inform us :  "our spies say Ivana was rattled after running into her ex Donald's new bride-to-be, Melania Knauss, at  urlLink the Dior show . 'She was not happy,' our source says. 'Everyone had to run around finding her a new place to sit. They ended up both in the front row but across the runway from each other. Ivana feels threatened by her.'"    The Corsair  sheepishly raises his hand:  Okay , suggestion, to avoid those feelings of inferiority in the face of the new wife, Ivana might want to, like shave off that last name and go back to her more "empowering" maiden name. Just a suggestion.   In :  urlLink Legal guardians , baby, they are so "in," that they are the new  urlLink Michael Ian Black . According to  urlLink Gawker  (link via  urlLink AFP ), Court Love (I know, I wasn't supposed to write about her anymore, and I tried ... for two whole days ...), Love started the trend, which is vaguely BDSM with overtones of " urlLink Top " and " urlLink Bottom ," or, as that old Phenomenologist of the Spirit  urlLink Hegel  might call it,  urlLink the Master-Slave dialectic :  "We're suddenly jealous: Courtney Love has a legal guardian. Get this -- you can declare yourself incompetent and make someone else do everything for you! Show up at your court hearings, take care of your kids, do the dishes -- hell, I bet I could even get someone to do my blow for me! This whole guardian idea is bitching!"  We  so  agree.   Out : Congressman  urlLink Harold Ford, Jr . Call me a playa hater, drunk off a gallon of haterade, but this guy is just too ambitious. He's  urlLink dangerously ambitious ,  urlLink sinisterly ambitious . He tried to unseat  urlLink House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi at, get this, the age of 32 ; He appeared in Robert Downey's documentary  urlLink The Last Party ; he was conspicuous in nearly every episode of my beloved  urlLink K Street ; and being named one of People Magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People in the World. And now, according to the vapid  urlLink Cindy Adams, that bastard is getting toasted by Justin Trousersnake :  "THE Democratic Convention later this month in Boston. Guess who's giving a party? Guess. Just guess. Give up? That bastion of political know-how, that international savant, that well-known Democratic think-tank Justin Timberlake. I'll repeat that because nobody's going to believe this. Justin Timberlake. He comes from Tennessee. He will thus host a happening for the Tennessee Congressman Harold Ford Jr. At least that's what I think the guy's name is — and if it isn't, so what."   Someone please check under his hair for  urlLink the mark of the beast . Please. Hurry.   In :  urlLink Andre 3000 and Alicia Silverstone  were named  urlLink PETA's  "World's Sexiest Vegetarians." Someone please fetch me a chicken fried steak!  urlLink Ananova  writes:  "When asked recently how he would spend his last day on earth, Andre replied: 'I'd probably go for a great meal - some broccoli probably, because I'm a vegetarian.'  "Silverstone, meanwhile, said: 'Once I became vegan, my nails were stronger, my skin was glowing, I lost  urlLink a lot of weight .'"   Out :  urlLink AJ Benza . We are a little miffed at AJ Benza, as he stiffed our pal Michael Musto on a scoop.  urlLink Musto says it all accurately :  "I recently asked Corsair blogsman RON MWANGAGUHUNGA to get A.J. BENZA to elaborate on a Corsair item that the gossip mook was hosting a reality show. 'I'd do anything for Musto,' A.J. responded to Ron, swearing he'd forward the info shortly. Instead, he adorably gave it to Page Six! And he used to be the fun kind of corrupt. Now where's that redemption window?"  You owe Musto one, AJ; do the right thing, be a goodfella, we still love you.    In :  East Sussex , baby, in the UK. That significant cultural artifact  urlLink Star Magazine  reports, "We already knew Johnny Depp was a Francophile, and now it's safe to call him an Anglophile too. Depp, 41, fell for a $4.7 million Georgian estate in picturesque Rye, East Sussex, during a trip to the U.K. in May, says a source."   urlLink The Mirror  reported on July 9th, "SEEMS Johnny Depp isn't the only celeb to have fallen in love with the picturesque village of Rye in East Sussex.   "The Pirates Of The Caribbean star recently bought a house there and now we hear Brad Pitt and wife Jennifer Aniston are looking for a property there too.   "Our agent tells us: 'It's a beautiful place and perfect for a couple looking to relax and get away from it all.'"   The Corsair  counts the minutes until the New York Times is writing a story on East Sussex, thereby officially signalling the end of that celeb trend.   Out :  Annabel Magazine ? According to  urlLink British Vogue :  "ANNABEL'S, the glamorous Berkeley Square nightclub named after founder, Mark Birley's former wife, Lady Annabel Goldsmith, is planning its own glossy magazine. Among the contributors to the publication, which is due to be launched during London Fashion Week in September, is  urlLink Anthony Haden-Guest , who was immortalised as seedy hack Peter Fallow in Tom Wolfe's Bonfire of the Vanities. Haden-Guest's article will chronicle the history of the club that has over the decades played host to some of London's most starry nights. And to make sure he doesn't miss a trick, he has posted a message on an internet chat forum asking people for 'any memories [they] might have of specially memorable evenings there', adding, 'about some nights, I would be grateful for my own memory!'"  We love Haden-Guest, that iron man party boy, but the magazine idea sounds dodgy.

       Reverend Al Communications, Inc?    urlLink The Daily News' Phyllis Furman reports today  that Reverend Al Sharpton, that sweet natured buffoon with the outdated  urlLink bouffant , is on his way to becoming a media mogul:  "Stand by for the newest marquee on the media landscape - Rev. Al Communications Inc. Al Sharpton, the civil rights activist turned TV star, has set up his own media company and is in talks with prominent black entrepreneurs and media execs about funding and guiding his  urlLink burgeoning media biz career , sources close to Sharpton said.  "'He's about to become a CEO,' a source said."   The Corsair  stands utterly speechless, contemplating  urlLink the former FBI informant's  moxie.  " urlLink Sharpton  - who already scored a reality TV show deal with cable net Spike TV and is a paid commentator for CNBC - is looking to fund everything from a TV production company to a syndicated radio program to magazine acquisitions and start-ups.  "He's been approached by two of the country's leading African-American advertising moguls, Uniworld founder  Byron Lewis  and GlobalHue president  Don Coleman . They are looking to pour dollars into the Sharpton media venture, sources said.  "Both have been big supporters of his Madison Avenue Initiative, a group that seeks to draw ad dollars to black media.  "And Sharpton is in talks with two African-American media execs to run the organization.  Frank Mercado-Valdes  is the former president of Heritage Networks, a syndicator of ethnic TV shows, who had butted heads with Sharpton years ago in a bitter battle over the Apollo Theater.  Keith Clinkscales  is the ex-president of publisher Vanguarde Media and former CEO of Vibe magazine.  "Despite his media ambitions, Sharpton told the Daily News that his primary focus will continue to be his civil rights group National Action Network. He will also be campaigning heavily for John Kerry and is slated to address the Democratic National Convention.  "'I want to do  urlLink TV  and radio as long as it doesn't interfere with my charitable work,' Sharpton said, calling in yesterday from L.A. where he was on the set of his Spike TV show 'I Hate My Job.'"   The Corsair  wants to do TV and radio as long as it doesn't interfere with his Cutty Sark.  "But the Sharpton company marks the next big step for the former presidential candidate who earlier this year hired William Morris to field TV and radio offers. Sharpton's also being guided by his longtime spokeswoman  Rachel Nordlinger  and entertainment manager  Bruce Charet ."  Let me get this straight, Al Sharpton has an "entertainment manager"? Can someone say "Hollywood"?  "William Morris has been holding talks with leading radio syndicators, including ABC Radio Networks, Premiere Radio networks and Westwood One as well as satellite radio company Sirius. The goal is to turn Sharpton into the Rush Limbaugh of the left."   Well , Rush and Al do occupy approximately the same  urlLink volume  ...  "When asked about the prospects of making serious money at this stage in his career, Sharpton said, 'I certainly haven't made money before.'   "'I will involve black companies. I am going to open opportunities,' he added."   Mi vida loca.

       Elton at Radio City Music Hall   Yesterday's Radio City Music Hall Elton John gala is described thusly by the merry few at  urlLink Fashionweekdaily :  "Tuesday night, it was all about  urlLink Elton . The concert opened with the music man seated at his piano on stage with an impressive 99-piece symphony orchestra and 62-voiced choir assembled behind him. John, dressed in a black suit with floral embellishments on the right sleeve, performed for over two hours to a packed audience that included such New York luminaries as Cynthia and Dan Lufkin, Eva Dillon, Bettina Zilkha, Howard Sobel, Amanda Hearst, Lauren, Sharon, and Ashley Bush."  The very cool  urlLink David Patrick Columbia gets existential in NY Social Diary :  "Throughout the 70s as I was already grown up, but coming of age, the Elton John songs served as commentary, background, emotional reflections of that time, my age, our age. I never tired of him, of his delivery, his style; never tired of any of his material, especially those songs through the 1970s. When everything went CD, I started collecting him all over again.  "Last night at Radio City Hall, I saw him (playing to a packed house) for the first time live in concert at a benefit he did for the Royal Academy of Music (where he was a scholarship student) and the Juilliard School of Music at Lincoln Center. He was accompanied by his band and the symphony orchestras of both schools. And he played and played and played. Tirelessly, he took us through a selection of his vast library of work. After forty-three years of performing all over the world 55 times at Madison Square Garden, this is his first time at Radio City Music Hall. (He has four more shows there through the weekend).   "It was a rich evening for this writer, wrapped in the memories of growing up with Elton John?s songs."

       A Little of the Old In and Out    urlLink Me droogs , how about a little of the old in and out?   In :  urlLink LA.com's blog  runs this suculent and juicy blind item, fuck if I know who they are talking about, although someone on the board speculated Angelina Jolie, and another speculated Scarlett Johanssen:  "Shes a sassy, sexy thang with a booming movie career that just wont quit. And it turns out shes got an appetite that just wont quit either. Just check out her curious habit of juggling several no-name boyfriends at the same time -- not all that hard a thing to do, considering how much time she spends filming and making the scene all around the planet. Why, shes even hired a couple of her anonymous studs to join the staff that waits on her hand and foot (not that she keeps them on very long once theyve outlived their usefulness). But Dolly knows that the real reason the lusty thing likes to keep her dating options in the multiples is because her favorite way to get her freak on is to do it in threesomes and foursomes and, yes, fivesomes."    Out : Famous indie film asshole, Vincent Gallo, who famously had on-screen oral sex with former It Girl Chloe Sevigny in the laughable " urlLink Brown Bunny  (and, somewhere in the mix, put a  urlLink curse on the colon  of harmless film critic Roger Ebert)," in  urlLink Paper Magazine , just saying any old shit just to get a reaction:  "(Gallo) On film festivals: 'I want to make a film with a handicapped Black Jew lesbian main character so I can win at Sundance.' On Tim Roth: 'Tim Roth is like holding a penis upside down to make it appear erect.' On Buffalo '66 co-star Christina Ricci: 'I don't like her. But it's okay. She's basically a puppet. I told her what to do, and she did it.' On Harmony Korine: ' ... a mini-dwarf, faggot date-raper.' On his hometown Buffalo: 'Like Deliverance with smoke stacks.'"   Like a school on Saturday ...   In :  urlLink Town and Country Magazine , and their cover girl, the ethereal, beautiful  urlLink Thandie Newton . During the Reagan 80s, Town and Country regularly ran features touting vacations in then Apartheid-era South Africa. Sad, but true. But all that is  thankfully  in the past, as  urlLink Teri Agins of the Wall Street Journal notes :  "By mid-1993, executives at Hearst Corp. decided to reinvent (Town and Country), and brought in  urlLink Pamela Fiori , editorial director of American Express Co.'s magazines, as editor in chief. Ms. Fiori says she realized that 'the face of affluence was changing dramatically,' and resolved to change the magazine accordingly. An unlikely tenet of her new strategy: boost the visibility of prominent blacks and other minorities.  "The most dynamic members of society were no longer scions, but often self-made 'doers,' Ms. Fiori reasoned, and they weren't necessarily white. Along with Asians, blacks and Latinos were gaining representation in the top income brackets, and Ms. Fiori set out to actively court them -- both as subjects and readers."  The move is as shrewd as it is principled. "High Society," as opposed to, say, the jet set, is a cultural class on life support. Rumor has it that high society currently consists of 50 old ladies and their elegantly tended rose gardens in  urlLink Newport Rhode Island ? So, Town and Country has embraced the upwardly-mobile minority readership in American society. Good for them, now, if only we could get Graydon Carter on board.   Out : " Underripe Cheesecake ." Sounds unsavory, no?  Okay , I was a little bit afraid to bring this up, you know, Patriot Act paranoia and all, but since  urlLink Tom Scocca at the salmon-colored weekly did , then so will I. Was I the only one who was disturbed by  urlLink last week's New York Magazine photographs  of "underripe cheesecake" last week? Scocca writes:  "Last weeks edition (of New York Magazine) ... betrayed a creepily underdeveloped id.  "In a fashion spread titled 'Après Swim,' New York presented the 'latest swimwear inspired by the sultry feel of the seventies.' The swimsuits, the magazine explained, 'hark back to those long Montauk summers when Cheryl Tiegs and Peter Beard ruled the waves.'  "But the shoot harked back more like nine years, not 30. Instead of evoking the sunny adult sexuality of Ms. Tiegs, shot by Mr. Beard, the photos echoed the  urlLink creepy mid-90?s  basement images of teenagers shot by Steven Meisel for Calvin Klein.  "Things opened legally, if seamily, with a 20-year-old woman in a Tomas Maier swimsuit. In front of her, on a bed, lay a young man of unspecified age wearing 'towel, Vintage.'  "Not all the models who followed were over the age of consent, though. A later shot presented a 15-year-old girl in a tiny black bikini, her developing body stretched out in an easy chair and one arm slung behind her head, pinup-wise.  "Any resemblance to underripe cheesecake was strictly accidental, the magazine insisted. 'Come on,' New York spokesperson  urlLink Serena Torrey  wrote in an e-mail, 'this was hardly an Abercrombie & Fitch catalog. These were tasteful, arty fashion pictures.'"  So, for the record, let me get this straight, Adam Moss believes that gossip is an unpalatable appetizer, but underripe cheesecake is fine for the main course? Just asking.   In : Jerry Springer will cover the Democratic convention for WOIO Channel 19 in Cleveland,  urlLink according to the Plain Dealer  (link via  urlLink Romenesko ):  "A Cleveland news station has tapped a special correspondent with a nose for political scandal to cover the Democratic Party convention in Boston this month:  urlLink Jerry Springer .   "WOIO Channel 19 which already has wowed viewers with flashy graphics, breathless anchors and relentless hype will use Jerry Springer as a correspondent instead of its own reporters. 'He's well-connected and as plugged-in as any anchor or reporter we could send,' said news director Steve Doerr.       "That's because  urlLink Springer , who campaigned across Ohio last year in an exploratory bid for the U.S. Senate, is a Democratic delegate to the convention. State party leaders rewarded him with the slot for his fund-raising efforts.   "'We were looking for an unusual way to cover it, with an unusual person who could give it an unusual bent,' Doerr said. 'Based on our unusual format, it seemed to be a decent fit.'"  Is this the ultimate blurring of the line between entertainment and news? Is this a shrewd attempt to gain a local news broadcast buzz?  The Corsair , actually, has an optimistic take on this development, despite what the great Howie Kurtz will probably report on exhaustively this Sunday. Springer was  urlLink Democrat of the Year in Cleveland , had a powerful exploratory commission for a possible Senate run, is a delegate to the convention,  urlLink a former news anchor  at WLWT, a mayor, and worked on the Presidential campaign of Robert Kennedy. Is he a spectacle? Of course. Might he hasten the disintegration of the gravitas of Tv news?  Possibly , but Springer is eminently qualified to serve as a special correspondent for television station WOIO in Cleveland.    Comment here on on  urlLink VH1's Best Blog Ever .

       Memorable Celebrity Fisticuffs   Perhaps all the media attention regarding the  urlLink 200th Anniversary of the Hamilton-Burr duel  has gotten people a bit hot under the collar in these dog days of summer. Cans of whoop ass all over the city are being opened up.  urlLink Gawker reported yesterday  that the unhandsome Stanley Crouch went a little -- how shall we put it so as to keep it jazz-themed? -- "improvisational" on Dale Peck, he of  urlLink the scathing review :  "A little after two o'clock (yesterday), while novelist and book critic  urlLink Dale Peck  was lunching with the writer  urlLink Linda Yablonsky  at  urlLink Tartine  in the West Village, jazz critic/cultural commentator/novelist  urlLink Stanley Crouch  decided to introduce himself. (Peck had reviewed a novel of Crouch's a few years back; in response to that review, Crouch told Salon that Peck was "a troubled queen.")   "At Tartine, Crouch shook Peck's hand, then, as a follow-up, smacked him in the face, saying 'if you ever did anything like that [presumably referring to the review] again, it'll be much worse.'   Much worse than being bitchslapped in a public?  "Crouch once also threw a punch at  urlLink Howard Mandel , the president of the Jazz Journalists Association. If two equals trend (or maybe three? Didn't Crouch hit  urlLink Harry Allen  at the Village Voice, back in the day? (And wait, make that four -- didn't he slug the late letters editor  urlLink Ron Plotkin  at the Voice as well?) ) then it's pretty clear Crouch has, at best, some serious impulse control problems. Funny stuff, coming from a guy who's always railed about the 'politics of resentment' -- guess he's been carrying around a grudge for years."  Celebrities, and we use that term very loosely in the case of Stanley Crouch, are not averse to the prospect of a spot of a little "rough and tumble." Here are some of my favorites over the fullness of time:   urlLink Ophelia Roop writes of Mailer versus Vidal :  "The most memorable confrontation between Norman Mailer and Gore Vidal occurred in the waning moments of their famous and infamous literary feud when each wanted to be considered America's leading wordsmith. The story went something like this: A famous hostess, whose name I've forgotten, either as an oversight or with her eye on publicity and notoriety, had invited both sages of American letters - Mailer and Vidal - to her gathering. Mailer, not a little drunk, had challenged Vidal to a fight and when Vidal had not responded, a frustrated Mailer had tossed his drink either in Vidal's face or elsewhere on Vidal's person. Unperturbed apparently, Vidal had said, 'Once again words have failed Norman,' and with this secured his place as America's leading wordsmith."   urlLink Richard Johnson versus Joe Conason :  "While (Richard Johnson) was on general assignment, he wrote a story about Ed Koch that garnered him a mention in Joe Conason?s 'Media Watch' column at the Village Voice. Conason called him the 'undependable Richard Johnson.' 'I called him up, and he said I could write a letter to the editor or sue him for libel,' says Johnson. 'I found him in his office. We were walking down the hallway. I threw a punch at him. It was only a glancing blow.'"  That troublemaker  urlLink Gore Vidal , it is said, jumped on his archenemy Truman Capote, who was sitting on a sofa, and excused himself, saying that he mistook the Southern writer for "a cushion."  Ernest Hemingway nearly crushed George Plimpton's fingers on night, if not for the well timed intervention of a curious onlooker.   urlLink Mike Tyson punched out Wesley Snipes  over a girl ("later for you")  Comedians Chevy Chase and Bill Murray had a  urlLink full on brawl .  Jack White of the White Stripes  urlLink kinked Jason Stollsteimer of the Von Bondies' ass   Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan is said to have one slapped Senator Kit Bond in the face.

       Class in New York City    Granted , I gave this blog entry a really sexy title because I wanted you to head right on in, tossing caution to the wind, because no one really wants to talk about the pecking order in New York and I now will do so, somewhat,  tentatively . Somehow the subject is deemed  un-American , too British, and we, still trapped in what the now forgotten but once influential  urlLink American sociologist VF Calverton  (United States of Amnesia?) termed the "colonial complex," have issues with the idea of class, an idea that is at the backbone of Our Daddy  urlLink Britain's sense of history and order .   But there is a complex system of  urlLink class , of course, as this  urlLink Sunday NY Times Styles column  makes painfully clear:  "I have been working at  urlLink Hue , a Vietnamese restaurant and lounge in the West Village, since shortly after it opened last summer. In the beginning it was a hit with a young, fast crowd because of one of its owners, Karim Amatullah. He has been in the night life business for years, starting as a promoter and most recently as an owner of Halo. So many celebrities have been coming that we have grown selective. Once, Chad Lowe's assistant called and asked if he could have a table in the next hour. 'Sorry,' I said, 'we're all booked.'  "'Really? That's a shame because his wife, Academy-Award-winner-Hilary-Swank, is very hungry.'   "'Ah, yes, something just opened up,' I say."  A cautionary tale, to be sure; but one that is very, very indicative of class and power relations in the Big Apple. The degree to which  urlLink the class system  is in operation in our American democratic social experiment is, indeed, staggering. Anyone whose ever been on the unforgiving end of the velvet rope, as  urlLink Sandra Bernhard  brushes past you, says something to the rather plain looking lady with the clipboard and the headset, and is ushered right in behind the velvet rop (You didn't even say "pardon me," Sandra, you bitch). Or if you've spent some time in the tents at the fashion shows knows this to be true. I once had dinner with Greek millionaire playboy  urlLink Taki Theodoracopoulos  at  urlLink Elaine's . After the dinner, as me, Taki and Christopher Buckley proceeded to down the volume of the Chesapeake in liquor he mentioned that if he had known I was such a good drinker he wouldn't just have seated me at the "second best table." Out of maybe 7 or 8 tables, Taki, ever the hierarchical-thinking European conservative, had created, at Elaine's, his own  urlLink system of class , through the seating arrangements, from most important to least important table, all, I must add, in good humor,  in relation and proximity to Taki . Our Sun God. (Ed Note.  You are a marvelous host , Taki)   urlLink That British asshole Toby Young  also had an interesting story about Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter in his appropriately titled book  urlLink How to Lose Friends & Alienate People  (Little, Brown U.K.). On the first day on the job at Vanity Fair, Carter tells Young:  "'You think you've arrived, doncha?' he said. 'I hate to break it to you but you're only in the first room.' He paused. 'It's not nothing -- don't get me wrong -- but it's not that great either. Believe me, there are plenty of people in this town who got to the first room and then didn't get any further. After a year or so, maybe longer, you'll discover a secret doorway at the back of the first room that leads to the second room. In time, if you're lucky, you'll discover a doorway in the back of the second room that leads to the third. There are seven rooms in total and you're in the first. Doncha forget it.''This, I later discovered, was Graydon's 'seven rooms' speech, a pep talk he gives to all new recruits."   urlLink Dirk Standen of Gotham Magazine  reviewed the book, saying:  "At times, Young exhibits a level of admiration for his ex-boss that borders on hero worship. But Carter, the erstwhile editor of the satirical monthly Spy, also comes across as an occasionally grandiose character in the book. He likes to greet new recruits with an intimidating speech about the 'seven rooms'of power, and he boots Young out of a front row seat at a Calvin Klein fashion show with the words: 'Toby, you can't sit in the front row. You're still in the first room.'"  If there are indeed seven rooms, and  Graydon Carter  is not just a bloviating gasbag, then  urlLink Richard Johnson  and his merry band of  urlLink Page Sixers  stand at the gate guarding the keys. From personal experience of one who was once mentioned in Page Six (it was about an interview I did with  urlLink David Lynch ) I was the beneficiary of one day of glory. It was something,  I'll tell you .   And, similarly, the keys to the Avant Garde room, the Downtown Room, the place where everything experimental and new is going on --  wait : would they even have a room, and wouldn't keys be considered too bourgeois? -- are held in the hands of the excellent  urlLink Michael Musto  and  urlLink David and Kim at Paper .  There's no way I can really get into the subject in this blog because there are so many levels of power and class in the city -- restauranteur spheres of power, lawyer spheres of power, business relations of class, publicist social distinctions, independent film centers and players, journalist clas protocol, even, down the line to -- dare I say it -- blogger class, with  urlLink Choire Sicha  holding those keys -- the elite eyeballs, along with the mysteriosu  urlLink TMLTMF , at the top of the food chain, dispensing glory, or, more importantly, links.   It's all so fascinating but I'm never going to get to the bottom of it here; I'm just trying to start a conversation.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In : People are  urlLink still raving  about Calvin Klein's party on Saturday. Apparently this was really an existential event of quite some consequence, imagine our surprise. Every fucking glossy worth it's weight in platinum has chimed in on the cultural significance of this particular party. "With a waiter to guest ratio of one to three, the party was just grand enough to suit its venue, the sprawling Gothicised Southampton mansion that Klein paid $29.9 million for last year," says  urlLink British Vogue . "He must have spent $600,000," one source salaciously told my favorite gossip duo,  urlLink NY Daily News' Rush and Molloy . "And it was all done with class, taste, sexiness and fun."  urlLink Guy Trebay of the New York Times  wrote with a sort of Evelyn Waughish  urlLink Brideshead Revisited  melancholy-flourish, "... it appeared as if it was the Pines of that era that was being evoked at  urlLink Calvin Klein's  big party in Southampton last Saturday, an event that was by turns enchanted, confounding and suffused with nostalgia for a period when Mr. Klein, and the world of fashion as it is now, were still young." After reading Trebay gushing forth unselfconsciously, I thought I almost --  almost  -- heard  urlLink Jeremy Irons' world weary narrative voice  coming from PBS.  urlLink Gawker's  source was snarky, the realist in the crowd, putting things all into perspective and snapping us out of our  urlLink Bovaryesque  reveries:  "the party calvin threw at his spookycastle/beach house on saturday was the most over the top bizarre. i mean, i am gay, but it was too gross to watch 200 young ("hired"?) half-naked men lounging around on pillows and bed-like furniture on the beach at night, with snickering old guard southampton socials staring in disbelief and laughing at them.   " ... there were even rumors that (ex studio 54) party planner  urlLink robert isabell  bulldozed the beach in preparation for the party. sick. the guest list was supposedly 200, then 400, try 800 of his 'nearest and dearest.' but crashers abounded and no one was even checking the guest list. the page sixers were there, trolling for items, and calvin was deeply conflicted, or confused, because we saw him ask  urlLink patrick mcmullan  to stop taking pictures... why invite him then? ps no body was wearing his clothes. yes, this was a $600,000 party that backfired."   Out :  urlLink Teresa Heinz Kerry , willful blabbermouth, picklehead. Can someone put a fucking muzzle on her already? I know,  I know : not four days ago, here I was, on  this very blog , fascinated -- in true shallow Gemini fashion -- by her Mozambique-by-way-of-Swiss accent, and now? What? I repent.  I can't take her eccentric $500 million twaddle . Teresa is form without content, an elegant international-flavored accent without the appropriate thoughtfulness, sophistication or polish: don't get distracted by the odd accent, the woman is dangerous! In many ways, she reminds me of stupid self-indulgent billionaires, like Ross Perot, or plantation owners, or British lords; they are so used to servants or slaves hanging on their every word, that thoughtfulness goes by the wayside and what we get, in due course, is  urlLink logorrhea .   urlLink According to Page Six , "THAT Teresa Heinz Kerry surprised and worried some of the 1,000 guests at Friday morning's Women for Kerry breakfast when she looked out at the crowd and said, 'We had better get you women some birth control, there are so many of you here!' Yikes."   In :  urlLink IWantMedia's interview  with "Outfoxed" Producer/Director Robert Greenwald captures the discomfort that some conservatives  The Corsair  knows (yes,  The Corsair  socializes with conservatives) have with the Fox News:  " IWM : What did you discover that surprised you the most while working on 'Outfoxed'?   " Greenwald : I thought going into this we would discover what we all knew -- that Fox News is a conservative news network, with an opinion relative to a conservative look at the world. But what I found is more troubling, more upsetting and more critical to democracy: Fox News is a Republican news network. It takes a Republican line, which is different from a conservative line.   "There are many well-meaning, thoughtful conservatives who disagree with the Bush administration about the war, about the tax cuts, about the economy, about [ex-White House terrorism advisor] Richard Clarke ... None of that is ever seen on Fox News because they consistently support the political line that the Republican party will take at any given time, which is different from a conservative philosophy or approach."   In all fairness,  urlLink Fox has blasted back .  urlLink Howard Kurtz  has torched the film. And  urlLink Variety  gave it a mixed review.   Out :  Gena Lee "Swollen"   (AKA  urlLink Gena Lee Nolin ). That significant cultural artifact  urlLink The National Enquirer  informs us, mirabile dictu, that, "Gena Lee Nolin has  urlLink finally  made the journey from 'Baywatch' to 'Pay Watch' -- her long-awaited X-rated video has hit  urlLink the Internet !" Charmed, I'm sure.    In :  Models . So hott, everyone loves the aristocratic model, gliding down Prince Street in Soho ("the existential catwalk"), munching on rabbit food, portfolio in hand, ignoring the catcalls of the construction workers. ( The Corsair  sighs) Incidentally:  urlLink Vladimir Nabokov's poetry  appears to be all but forgotten in these United States of Amnesia, not to mention the works of  urlLink John Dos Passos ,  urlLink Hannah Arendt  and Jean Toomer, among other American artists who have vanished in the pop cultural buzz.  But  urlLink Vladimir Nabokov's Ode To A Model  is particularly relevant:  "I have followed you, model, in magazine ads through all seasons, from dead leaf on the sod to red leaf on the breeze,  "from your lily-white armpit to the tip of your butterfly eyelash, charming and pitiful, silly and stylish.  "Or in kneesocks and tartan standing there like some fabulous symbol, parted feet pointed outward ? pedal form of akimbo.   "On lawn, in a parody of Spring and its cherry-tree, near a vase and parapet, virgin practising archery.  "Ballerina, black-masked, near a parapet of alabaster. 'Can one' - somebody asked -  rhyme 'star' and 'disaster'?"  And why do I bring up models?  urlLink Fashionweekdaily notes  the cover models of the August fashion magazines (Natalie, Scarlett, Halle, Naomi, the Presleys).   Out :  urlLink The VH1 'I Love The 90s'  program really, kind of, well,  it sucked , true believers, I won't sugar coat it simply because  urlLink I occasionally write for them . I'm keeping it real, nigga. It's  waaay  waay too soon to have a retrospective on the 90s. You've got to let an era  urlLink marinade  a bit.  urlLink Whatevs.org  has scored it just about right, with sports metaphors:  "caught the first installment of 'I Love The `90s' yesterday while sprawled on the couch suffering from quite the hangover. can't say that I was impressed by the pundits' commentary on 1990. something was just missing, and it took me almost 24 hours to come up with a suitable analogy. fortunately for you, it just hit me (pun intended). when thinking of this episode, i recall famed longball hitters like  urlLink Rob Deer  and  urlLink Dave Kingman ; while these batters were armed with legendary power at the plate, they just never quite learned that you can't try to hit every single ball out of the ballpark. instead of swinging for the fences and brutally striking out, occasionally a nice Texas Leaguer will do. knowwhatimsayin? so  urlLink Hal Sparks  is kinda like Rob Deer and  urlLink Michael Ian Black  is kinda like Dave Kingman; for every speedball that gets hit into the proverbial lights of The Kingdome, there's a whole lotta whiffin' goin' on."   Whiffin , to be sure, and, one imagines, it is not inconceivable that some  huffin ' is also involved here, as in -- glue. I Love the 90s might have been better served marinated until, oh, say, 2010, when we could look backwards with the proper ironical distance. This project was ill advised and too hurried.    In : Admit it,  urlLink Barbara Bush is sexy , with those foxy eyes brimming with intelligence, a site so rare in the Bush family.   Out :  Prison Magazines . In today's above-the-fold story on the hardscrabble origins of terrorist  Abu Musab al-Zarqawi ,  Jeffrey Gettleman  of the  urlLink New York Times writes :  "These people, who knew Mr. Zarqawi until he disappeared into the terrorist murk of Afghanistan four years ago, acknowledge that he may have changed. But they say that while the man they knew could be capable of great brutality, they have a hard time imagining him as the guiding light of an Iraqi insurgency.  "'When we would write bad things about him in our prison magazine, he would attack us with his fists,' said Yousef Rababa, who was imprisoned with Mr. Zarqawi for militant activity. 'That's all he could do. He's not like bin Laden with ideas and vision. He had no vision.'"   Prison Magazine?!  What the fuck?!

       Paul McCartney's Eccentricities   Teresa Heinz Kerry has been rich and powerful -- had servants catering to her every wish, had every whim satisfied -- for so long that she has become, like  Ross Perot , like the English Lords, or even like wealthy Southern Plantation owners, such as the ones portrayed by  urlLink William Faulkner ,  eccentric .   And so has  Paul McCartney , the egalitarian Baby Boomer liberal icon, ironically enough.   Eccentrics say such odd and, at times,  stupid  things because their minds have no automatic filtration devices --  and why should they . They are not like us, they don't care what other people think about them so long as their Mint Julep (Southern eccentric) or Gin glass (British Lord) is full, and someone is listening -- or at least appearing to listen to -- their boorish stories about the "The War Against Northern Aggression," or "The Battle of the Bulge," or, "The Somme," or, say, in the case of Teresa Heinz Kerry (pronounced Tuh-RAY-zuh), prenuptual agreements and fuel-efficient four-wheel drive vehicles. You just know at some point soon Teresa is going to cause a nuclear explosion and have to be muzzled for the sake of the party. Did the plantation owner care about offending  his slave , did the British Duke care about feeding the servants tins of sardines,  like the cats , while his own hounds ate fresh salmon?  Of course not . That would be bourgeois.  Paul McCartney has been rich and famous for so long that, like the other Lords, he is acquiring their characteristic idiosyncrasies:   urlLink The 3 AM Girls report :  "HEs one of the oldest rockers on the block and Paul McCartneys picked up some eccentric behaviour during his 47-year career.  "On his recent European tour, the veteran crooner 'freaked out' when a vase of lilies was left in his Madrid hotel room. He thought they were using up too much oxygen, were told."   The Corsair  grabs a bag of unsalted popcorn and sits riveted to his screen.  "And that wasnt the only incident that took his entourage by surprise on the sell-out 14-date Live Experience extravaganza.  "'Everybody knows that Paul banned all meat and meat by-products on the entire tour,' says our mole.   "'But what isnt known is just how particular he is about other things, too.  "'Hes a huge fan of flowers but they have to be certain varieties from reputable florists.  "'Plants have to be as full at the bottom as they are at the top and he doesnt like tree trunks so indoor trees are forbidden.'"   The Corsair  mouths the words -- "eccentric."  "And furniture has to come up to the former Beatles exacting standards, too. 'Paul likes to entertain and requests two banqueting tables in every place he stops,' our source goes on.  "'But they have to be made from sustainable wood. Glass and lacquer are forbidden as the methods used to produce them can be harmful to the environment.'"   The Corsair  averts his gaze.  "Paul whose wife Heather gave birth to the couple?s first child, Beatrice, last October  even insists his crew abide by his beliefs.  "'Paul is very keen on recycling and made sure everyone on the tour made full use of the facilities he arranged.  "'The rubbish bins had to be policed at regular intervals throughout the day. If Paul found out that recyclable materials were being thrown out with the ordinary trash, thered have been hell to pay.'  "Pauls veggie-friendly requirements also gave tour staff a headache.  "'Paul insists that no leather or animal skins are used anywhere near him,' explains our insider. 'He goes mad if hes even near fake animal prints.'"   The Corsair  nods his head uncontrollably, making sociological field notes in his notebook on eccentrics and their feelings of control over reality.  "He likes to travel in a limousine but leather seats tend to come as standard in limos. Venue staff had to ensure that seats were re-covered in time for his arrival and then changed back.  "'You dont say no to the likes of Sir Paul.'"  No, ( The Corsair  scornfully averts his gaze), one does not, I suppose, nor does one say no to  urlLink PD Wodehouse's charming Lord  Emsworth ,  urlLink Ross Perot ,  urlLink Howard Hughes , or James Compson III in  urlLink Faulkner's Sound and the Fury .

       The Gossip Wars    urlLink Vanessa Grigoriadis and Jacob Bernstein's New York Magazine  article on The Gossip Wars goes a bit too far in echoing  urlLink Adam Moss' Party Line on gossip  (2nd item), with a mild aftertaste of Puritanical Old Gray Lady in the cut:  "One way of thinking about gossip is as the most primitive form of journalism -- nasty and brutish and short. The rules of sourcing, and even of truthfulness, are not fully developed. Vengeance and anger and ulterior motives all have a place in the process. The denizens of the gossip world, while sometimes not suited for the refinements of the rest of the journalism world, are superbly adapted to their environment. There's a dark glamour and camaraderie to the business, a certain piratical, swashbuckling aura, amplified by plenty of cocktails."   Leaving aside  for a moment the dodgy "piratical." "swashbuckling" references and to  whom  they might or might not be referring (" Hey ,  urlLink Mozart's Don Giovanni  was all about  ME , too"), there is alot of darkness going on in this piece --  alot  -- even going beyond the rather clumsy "short and brutish" reference to  urlLink Hobbes' theory of the condition of mankind .   In fact, in some of her  purplest prose passages , Vanessa Grigoriadis appears to have channeled her inner  urlLink Edgar Allan Poe , throwing light on "the denizens of the gossip world," with just the right touch of the old Gray Lady's Puritanical prudishness thrown in for effect, giving the whole thing a colonial, turgid  urlLink Nathaniel Hawthorne  New England freakshow vibe (Is gossip the House of the Seven Gables?).    The Corsair shivereded into the chill night breeze, as Grigoriadis' tale of supernatural and psychological horror unfolds, issuing forth from her fertile imagination, with lines such as:  "His background suited him to knowing what  evil lurked in the hearts of men  ..."  And, of course: "... The  denizens  of the gossip world ..."  "Vona has a  deep voice  and  a mane of dirty-blonde hair  ..."  "... But Spiegelman also saw himself as one of the good guys,  arrayed against the abusers and predators and vampires in the world ."  "He is adamant:  'There was no defenestration .'"  "... a taste for  the darker things in life ."  "The cockatoo shrieks."   Indeed (Averted gaze),  The cockatoo shrieks , Ms. Grigoriadis, ( The Corsair  shivers at the bone white moon in the hour of the wolf); and  urlLink quoth the raven nevermore . Finally, Dark Vanessa tosses off vaguely supernatural references to, the "black art of press-baiting," "Cassandras," "poison pill," and, of course, "a steady inflow of dirt."    The Corsair  wonders if Vanessa Grigoriadis' feverish and occultish philosophy of gossip (so strikingly similar to her boss, Adam Moss') might have been better scheduled as a piece for Halloween?   I know I won't be able to sleep soundly tonight.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  Avril Lavigne , keeping in character as the  tough grrrl , making it in the seedy music industry on her own terms, by her own wits, has snubbed the  House of Windsor ,  urlLink according to The Sun  (link via  urlLink Ananova ):  "HE has met just about every gorgeous pop star – but  urlLink PRINCE CHARLES  isn’t good enough for AVRIL LAVIGNE.  "The Canadian rocker pulled out of meeting the  urlLink Prince of Wales  at  urlLink Capital FM’s Party In The Park  in London yesterday with just hours to spare, throwing organisers into a panic.  "The pop rocker and R&B star  urlLink JAMELIA  were due to sit either side of Charles as he watched the end of the show in aid of the Prince’s Trust in Hyde Park.  "But flustered flunkeys were told Avril would not be showing. A backstage insider told me: 'Avril wasn’t keen on the idea. She wanted to get away as soon as she completed her set.'"  Is Avril's  urlLink bad nutrition to blame ? Or is she just  a surprisingly strong and independent young woman . We like.    In :  urlLink Stefano Pilati  has been annointed with holy oil, according to  urlLink British Vogue :  "YVES SAINT LAURENT has given the ultimate seal of approval to  YSL Rive Gauche  designer  Stefano Pilati  by agreeing to attend his spring/summer 2005 show in October. 'I'm completely confident in him,' the 69-year-old designer told Women's Wear Daily. 'He's a real worker. I feel liberated.' Laurent famously disapproved of  urlLink Tom Ford , who played creative director of YSL Rive Gauche from January 2000 to April 2004. Accusing him of 'destroying everything' at the house, Laurent said Ford's work was 'contrary to Yves Saint Laurent. It was Saint Laurent in name but not in its vitality.' Pilati, however, is expected to save the day. 'I think [he] will be able to repair the damage that's been done to the YSL culture and to re-establish the dialogue with the YSL customer,' he said recently."    Out :  I see white people . As  urlLink Fashionweekdaily  notes, ' urlLink Vanity Fair  is throwing a party to launch Abercrombie & Fitch’s new  urlLink A&F Magazine  on Wednesday at The Gansevoort Hotel.' Be sure to wear your sunglasses, true believers, because, otherwise, you just might get  urlLink blinded by the white  (check out the 2nd item) as the combination of Amercrombie and Fitch and Vanity Fair break bread.  You know what kind of bread .   In :  urlLink Fashionweekdaily reports  on the September Vogue issue:  " The Daily  has learned exclusively that  urlLink Vogue’s  September 2004 issue will be its largest issue ever in the history of the magazine. According to sources on the publishing side of Vogue, the annual fall fashion issue—one of the most highly anticipated issues of the year—will contain over 620 pages of advertisements (the previous record for ad pages was 619) and combined with the estimated 200-plus pages of editorial, the final page count could teeter well into the 850-plus page range, as ad pages continue to come in. 'This issue will set a record as the largest monthly magazine ever published,' said a well-placed executive inside Condé Nast."   Out :  Gwyneth Paltrow .  urlLink Medieval medicine , of which  The Corsair  has more than just a passing interest, explicitly warns against  urlLink Libra's partaking in the ancient art of "cupping."  Perhaps this was the subterfuge that compelled Hollywood Libra Paltrow to act in such an appalling manner, as The New York Post's resident cutie-pie  urlLink Elisa Lipsky-Karasz to report :  "The star hosted a bridal shower for childhood friend  urlLink Mary Wigmore  at a private home on Perry Street last week but shocked guests by acting aloof and antisocial. And when Wigmore opened a present from her future mother-in-law, Paltrow apparently took one look at the gift and smirked, 'Filene's!'"    Cupping or not , the fact that Paltrow is -- in essence -- a snooty blonde Spense girl at heart may have something to do with her demeanor. For those of us who have  known and loved  these rare, shallow beauties ( The Corsair  sulks, bitterly sipping  Cutty Sark , recalling his past) -- trust us on this one -- this is  quite actually  in character.    In :  urlLink LA.com/blog's  blind item is interesting -- fuck if I know who it is, though:  "You know him. You love him. If you buy into that straight-arrow-active-guy image carefully constructed by him and his well-paid but overworked peeps, you probably think he hit Hollywood straight from Mayberry and now lives in a cottage on Sesame Street. It turns out there are more than a few twists and turns in this jovial dude’s internal roadmap. Just ask the new owners of the posh vintage LA manse they purchased from the movie favorite. Being typically paranoid Angelenos, they didn’t bat an eyelash at the speaker system that had let the big shot former owner eavesdrop on any conversation on the entire property, let alone at the tiny security cameras that let him snoop in every nook and cranny. But you would have thought that before the guy started packing up all those Bekins boxes, he would have plastered over the super-secret peepholes he had drilled in every guest bathroom and bedroom."   Why are people from LA so goddamned wierd and into " urlLink surveillance "? When did  urlLink spying  become a part of LA chic? It's all so ...  oily  ... so  urlLink Stallone .   Out : Newly  urlLink cyber friendly  A-Lister  Will Smith , gearing up to the gear heads as his film, I, Robot, rockets to screens, tells  urlLink TeenHollywood  (link via  urlLink Ananova ) that he sees downloading piracy as linked to oceanic piracy and, therefore, is inevitable and unstoppable ... what the  fuck ?!  "My take is, 'OK, there were pirates 1,000 years ago - there is no reason for us to think that we'll live without them in the year 2004.'  "'It's always going to be there. In keeping with my intuitive comprehension of the universe, it would be foolish of me to upset myself with something that always has been and always will be.'"  In keeping with my intuitive comprehension of  urlLink The Fresh Prince of Bel Air , it would be foolish of me to upset myself with someone who, while at the top of his game in Hollywood, allowed himself to play  urlLink Bagger Vance , a  urlLink stepin' fetchit  role if  urlLink The Corsair  -- a blog pirate -- ever saw one.

       Weezy's Movin' On Up   This just in, according to  urlLink the AP :  "Actress  urlLink Isabelle Sanford , best known as 'Weezie,' Louise Jefferson on the television sitcom 'The Jeffersons,' died of natural causes, her publicist said Monday. She was 86.   " urlLink Sanford  died Friday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where she had been hospitalized since July 4, said Brad Lemack. Her daughter, Pamela Ruff, was at her side, he said.   "Her health had waned after undergoing preventive surgery on a neck artery 10 months ago, Lemack said. He did not give a cause of death.   After working as  urlLink the maid Louise on All in The Family , her fortunes changed, mirroring the upward mobility of African-Americans, so she moved to a deeluxe apartment in the sky, in  urlLink The Jeffersons . The AP report continues:  "In 1981, Sanford became the first black woman to receive an Emmy for Best Actress in a Comedy Series for her work on 'The Jeffersons.'"   urlLink Isabelle Sanford , along with Sherman Helmsley, played perhaps the first rich, strong role models to African-Americans in the wake of the civil rights struggle, and she will be sorely missed, particularly by my generation.   urlLink Isabelle Sanford ,  RIP

       Howard Stern's Clear Channel Documents    From today's  urlLink Smokinggun.com :   "Howard Stern has more than 12 million good reasons to gripe about Clear Channel's decision to yank his radio show from six of its stations. According to contract documents, the King of All Media would have received at least $12 million in future payments from the conglomerate for the broadcast of his program in the half-dozen markets. In 2001 and 2002, Stern's company, One Twelve Incorporated, cut multiyear licensing deals with Clear Channel worth a minimum of $19.5 million, though that figure could have ballooned significantly based on  urlLink bonus schedules tied to the King of All Media's Arbitron ratings . When Clear Channel cancelled Stern in late February, the unexpired terms of the radio deals called for the shock jock to receive future payouts of at least $12 million. Below you'll find the five-year, $4.5 million deal Stern signed in February 2002 to broadcast his show in San Diego. The other Stern/Clear Channel deals covered Pittsburgh ( urlLink $3.91 million ); Orlando ( urlLink $3.87 million ); Miami ( urlLink $3.35 million ); Louisville ( urlLink $2.2 million ); and Rochester ( urlLink $1.68 million ). Claiming breach of contract, Stern sued Clear Channel in June. The radio company countersued yesterday, accusing Stern of the same thing. "

      Ed Note: Defamer readers: The&nbsp;Christina Applegate and Ben Affleck story is right  urlLink here     &nbsp;   A Little of the Old In and Out on a Very Slow Saturday Afternoon news day &nbsp;    In : I'm not even going to try and compete with  urlLink Wonkette's&nbsp;compendium of the Democratic National Convention parties . Just go there if you are going to be in Boston for the convention, she'll tell you where to go. And email me if you attend the Jillian's pool hall party with B'Affleck, or the clambake with Ted Kennedy.    Out: Naomi Campbell ,&nbsp;playing the diva, yet again, according to  urlLink the 3AM Girls , on Poor Unsuspecting Italian Playboy&nbsp;#743 (If  urlLink Deniro likes his women like he likes his coffee , then Naomi likes her men like she likes her,  uhm ,  urlLink sausage ):   "Naomi, 34, was enjoying the company of Formula One boss  urlLink Flavio Briatore  aboard his liner  Lady In Blue II .   "The pair, who rekindled their on-off romance in April, were anchored off Porto Cervo in Sardinia.   "But it seems forgetful Flavio, 54, didn't inform Naomi that he had invited her ex-lover aboard."    The Corsair  reaches for a bag of unsalted popcorn and leaps on to his sofa in a fluid cat-like move.&nbsp;   "According to witnesses, the supermodel looked less than impressed when fashion tycoon Marzotto and his girlfriend, blonde actress/singer Serena Autieri, embarked.   "'Naomi just flipped,' says our nautical source. 'She started swearing at Matteo and what she said to Serena isn't repeatable. Fortunately, Serena doesn't understand a word of English.'   "Italian stallion Marzotto, 36, was with Naomi for eight months before he dumped her earlier this year."   "But it seems Naomi's wounds haven't healed yet. According to sources, Flavio stood by while his lover did what she does best - finger pointing and shouting.   "'Matteo tried to defend himself but he didn't have much luck,' a spy told Italy's Panorama magazine.   "His mum, who was also aboard, doesn't care much for Serena and likes Naomi a lot, so she joined in as well.    The Corsair  groans for Matteo, poor guy:   "'It was a right old argument.   "It was difficult to know what exactly wound Naomi up but it was probably the green-eyed monster,' says the source.   "In the end, Matteo and Serena fled, and were soon followed by Naomi. Poor Flavio was left aboard to rue his mistake."   "... (Campbell) has since (her breakup with Matteo) found comfort back in the arms of wealthy womaniser Briatore   "... The multi-millionaire playboy certainly likes his models. In February, he split from gorgeous Heidi Klum, who gave birth to their child three months later."    Now that's a spicy meatball!      In :   urlLink  Bill Maher Real Time   .  Staring Friday, July 30 at 11 pm, Season 2 begins of the most irreverent&nbsp;political talk show of them all (sorry,  urlLink Jon Stewart , lately you've been a little frat boy in your humor; you need to get some color on your writing staff, dood,  urlLink Harvard Lampoon  guys lack ethnic edge). Whether you are Libertarian (Bill Maher is), Conservative(roughly half the guests are), Moderate ( The Corsair  is), or a Lefty, this show, which can, at times, become rather violent in rhetoric, is, perhaps,  the wittiest show with the fastest minds on television . Every political side gets their shot at a  urlLink bon mot , a quip, or a zinger. When ABC bounced Maher for&nbsp;his stupid 9/11 comments, they created a free-speech monster.   If Howard Stern were more bitter and more politically intelligent&nbsp;it would be this show.    Out :  Melissa and Joan Rivers' Red Carpet Treatment , at least&nbsp;for one year, will be on haitus. As  urlLink Lindsay Robertson  might say:  Yaay .   As everyone knows, Tinseltown is all about the lawsuits, and the brinkmandship of the helmers and studio heads, and who blinks first. Well, the  urlLink Washington Post Boldface Names column  notes:  "The folks at E! Entertainment Television may have lost two of their big personalities,  urlLink Joan and Melissa Rivers , to a rumored $6 million to $8 million contract with the TV Guide Channel, but they're getting a good chuckle out of the fact that the mother-daughter duo's prime mission -- the Emmy Awards red carpet coverage -- is a no-go for their new employer. It seems that E! has exclusive rights to the carpet show before the Sept. 19 Emmy telecast.   "That means television stars get a one-night-only pass to stroll the red carpet without being pounced on by the two sharp-tongued fashion police (one of whom routinely botches stars' names). E!'s coverage contract runs through 2005, which leaves TV Guide and Joan and Melissa out of luck but not hope. 'We'd absolutely like to be covering the Emmys, and we'll continue to explore all of our options,' says  Chris Levesque , spokeswoman for Gemstar-TV Guide International, which owns the TV Guide Channel."&nbsp;   The TV Guide Channel sure are suckers for not&nbsp;having periphery vision. This gives E!&nbsp;two years to get, oh, say,  Howard Stern  and  Ana Nicole-Smith , or somesuch other catty-outrageous duo, to replace  Joan and Melissa &nbsp; and totally hose TV Guide Channel with an newer, more outrageous brand.   &nbsp;  very slow news day, sorry guys  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   urlLink  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Ed Note: Defamer readers: The&nbsp;Christina Applegate and Ben Affleck story is right  urlLink here     &nbsp;   Hampton's Itinerary     &nbsp;  So, what's on the Hampton's itinerary?  urlLink Fashionweekdaily , as usual, does a  urlLink marvy doo  job at summing things up. VH1 rules the Hampton's this weekend, with back-to-back events, and&nbsp;be sure to check out the ubiquitous  urlLink Russell Simmons , who will be out and about, just&nbsp;on the heels of acquiring&nbsp;his permit to  urlLink protest The Republican Convention .  urlLink Chris Heinz  will be also be up, fending off the women aggressively trying to part him from his bachelorhood.  urlLink Shannen Doherty  should be there,&nbsp;you might want&nbsp;to ask her what happened to  urlLink her career . Then sprint. Very fast.   What's up tonight? " urlLink Music and Mojitos ," playboy.   " urlLink Tonight , multi-platinum selling singer—and Glen Cove, Long Island native—Ashanti, hosts 'Music & Mojitos' at the East Hampton home of Jaci and Morris L. Reid, benefiting the VH1 Save the Music Foundation (a philanthropy dedicated to purchasing new musical instruments and restoring music education programs in public schools). The intimate three-hour event—which boasts committee hosts Rory and Elie Tahari, Ron Perelman, and  urlLink Russell  and  urlLink Kimora Lee Simmons —will also feature a live performance by Midas recording artist, Angel."   What about Saturday?  urlLink Fashionweekdaily's  got your back:   "Shopping and Champers. Fingers remain crossed for sunny weather on Saturday, but whether it’s rain or shine, the day is all about fashion—specifically, Theory fashion—as the company’s CEO, Andrew Rosen, along with  Russell Simmons ,  Shamin Abas  and Brett Ratner ( Ed Note : And possibly a Serena sighting, as  urlLink SerenaBrett  is the new Bennifer, or  urlLink Beniefcase ) , host a day of shopping and champagne benefiting VH1’s Save the Music. In between Range Rovers vying for prime parking in front of the new East Hampton store (46 Newtown Lane) and air kisses, fashionistas can enjoy a trunk show of the company’s fall/winter 2004 collection from 1- 4PM, with a percentage of the day’s proceeds being donated to the VH1 Save the Music Foundation."   PR director  Melissa Gellman  of J. Mendel is handling things. Also:   "From frolicking in Manolos to putting up with the fragrant smell of manure, the second week of the  urlLink Mercedes-Benz Polo Challenge  gallops into the Bridgehampton Polo Club. Expected guests at this week’s soiree—sponsored by Equinox Fitness Clubs—include  Shannen Doherty ,  Elisabeth Rohm ,  Chris Heinz ,  Amanda Hearst , and  Star Jones ."   Finally:   "When Simmons Summons…After some  urlLink good ole divot stomping , Russell and Kimora Lee Simmons will welcome guests to their East Hampton retreat for their  urlLink Art for Life  philanthropic event, benefiting the  urlLink Rush Philanthropic Foundation &nbsp;( Ed Note : The last 4 tickets for the event are on ebay  urlLink here ,  urlLink here ,  urlLink here  and  urlLink here ), dedicated to providing disadvantaged urban youth with significant exposure and access to the arts. Theory, General Motors, Motorola, and MTV Networks are the night’s sponsors, daytime chatterbox,  urlLink Kelly Ripa , will play hostess, and  urlLink Chevy Chase  is slated to emcee the art auction. Look for a special appearance by  urlLink Chris Tucker  plus the evening’s honorees: philanthropist  Sherry B. Bronfman , artist  Gordon Parks  and Toys ‘R’ Us Children’s Fund chairman,  Michael Goldstein . And with  urlLink Louis Vuitton’s purported No. 1 customer in North America  hosting the soirée, it’s no wonder that a trip to Antigua’s Jumby Bay Resort, complete with a set of luggage from the French luggage house, is just one of the items up for bid."    Ed Note : The&nbsp;icy hott Naomi Campbell is an event&nbsp;co chair, so, you better recognize.&nbsp;

       A Little of the Old In and Out     In :  " urlLink Heartbreaking Drunk"   urlLink   Keifer Sutherland   does a little strip tease in  urlLink New Zealand . It's just ... all so sordid ( The Corsair  takes a long sip of Cutty Sark before continuing, in earnest). I mean, he was  supposed  to be  Mr. Julia Roberts,  after all, the scruffy second generation actor who marries America's Sweetheart.   I guess he made the women happy,   but it's&nbsp;sort of an odd thing for a tv star to be doing, getting all nekkid Down Under. I just don't know what to think about this:   "Film star Kiefer Sutherland made women happy at a male revue show in New Zealand last Thursday by climbing enthusiastically on stage and  urlLink stripping off . According to  news.com , the New Zealand Herald published Kiefer's striptease pictures. Keifer has been shooting for the movie 'River Queen' near the North Island town of Raetihi.   "He was drinking with some of the cast and crew in the Raetihi Cosmopolitan Club last Thursday while the revue was being staged in front of an all-woman audience in an adjoining room.   "'Twice during the first half of the show, Keifer took of his shoes and passed into the roped-off ''women only' area of the bar to join the Men of Steel,' reported the newspaper. The security staff stopped Keifer but he was eventually allowed on stage during the second half of the show. Keifer then slipped out of his socks, whipped off his shirt, and waved it above his head to the tune of the Tom Jones' hit  urlLink 'You Can Leave Your Hat On' , before being ushered off the stage."    The Corsair  dry heaves at his desk.    Out :  urlLink Alleged billionaire Cindy Crawford , according to  urlLink British Vogue &nbsp;(2nd item), is going back to modeling:   "CINDY CRAWFORD is back in the game: the mother-of-two, who has not been signed to an agency for years, recently signed with ex-IMG and Next executive Jan Planit's new Planit M and is apparently looking to work with new designers and photographers."&nbsp;   Yeah, Bill Gates will be doing&nbsp;a naughty spread in the new Ambercrombie and Fitch as well.  Allegedly billionaire  my ass.&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, alleged supermodel my ass&nbsp;as well: if Cindy Crawford is still a supermodel, then  show me the building where she is the super . I don't believe it.    &nbsp;   In: The Anna Wintour Fembot . According to  urlLink Fashionweekdaily , there is an imposter  Anna Wintour , a fembot, replete with razor sharp bangs, making the rounds in stiletos:   "Yesterday afternoon around 1:30PM, at the posh eatery Freds, amidst a crowd of well-heeled diners including designer Alvin Valley and Quest magazines  Andrew Black a woman, sporting a perfectly-coiffed bob with razor sharp bangs, a pink sundress with matching cardigan draped around her shoulders, oversized black sunglasses, and slingbacks with a stiletto heel, stopped traffic as she sashayed her way through the restaurant to her table. Forks dropped. Fashionistas stared. And poured glasses tipped as the crowd wondered, 'Could this really be the ever-so-chic Vogue editrix?' But something was off this woman, who could literally double as Wintours twin, was just a tad taller and a wee bit heavier than the petite editor in chief. Size aside, it wasnt her measurements that threw trained eyes off; it was the Crate & Barrel shopping bag she loosely held in her hand."   Crate&nbsp;& Barrel ( Averted Gaze ); "Nice":  if you go in for that sort of thing . Actually she's a body double, paid for by the crafty  urlLink Si Newhouse , to confuse the  urlLink pesky PETA crowd . And they would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for&nbsp; urlLink those pesky kids .    Out :  Michael Jackson , crashed and burned, he was turned down by  Nicole Kidman .&nbsp; According to those intrepid  urlLink 3AM Girls :   "Word reaches us that Wacko Jacko has been begging the Hollywood star, whose latest movie is the remake of Stepford Wives, for a date.   "Apparently Michael, who is facing child sex charges in the US, wanted Nicole to accompany him to the upcoming MTV Music Awards.   "His sudden interest stunned Nicole. And although the Cold Mountain star is currently single since her relationship with rocker Lenny 'The Loins' Kravitz ended earlier this year, she didn't have to think too long or hard about turning Michael down.   "'There was a call from his people to mine asking if he could take me to the Awards,' confirmed the 37-year-old actress during a radio interview in her native Australia.   "'I had never even met him, it was a little strange. I did decline but, hey, the way my love life is I took it as a great compliment.'"   Comment here or on  urlLink VH1's Best Week Ever Blog .   In : Partisan sniping. We are all aware of the cantankerous mood that has enveloped the capitol of the last standing world superpower. But this story in&nbsp; urlLink The Hill&nbsp; (2nd story) is so wierd,  urlLink Lenonard Nimoy should be narrating it :   "Five staffers were forced to evacuate the office of  urlLink Sen. George Allen  (R-Va.) yesterday after aides to  urlLink Sen. Edward Kennedy  (D-Mass.) forwarded them a package that they thought could have been potentially hazardous.   "The 'bizarre' package arrived as two joined envelopes addressed to Kennedy in scrawled writing. One of the envelopes contained hair and a vial filled with a red substance that may have been blood. The other contained papers.   "But because the package had a Norfolk, Va., return address, Kennedys staff sent the papers to Allen?s office, complete with a warning about its suspicious nature, according to a Senate source. Both offices are in the Russell Building.   "The source said that members of Allens staff were furious because they felt Kennedys office may have exposed them to a dangerous substance."    Out : Poor  Dawnette&nbsp;Knight . According to  urlLink Ananova :   "The woman accused of stalking Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas faces nearly 20 years behind bars for 'being foolish', according to her lawyer.  Dawnette Knight appeared in court in Los Angeles on Thursday hoping the 24 stalking charges she faced would be dropped.   "Her lawyer, Richard Herman, insisted: She was infatuated with a movie star.   "'She's facing 19 years in state prison for being foolish. She's learned a very valuable lesson that will make her a good woman and a major asset to society.'   "Her fiancé, Ronald Calvin, said that the celebrity couple have nothing to fear, despite the sinister death threats she sent in letters to Zeta Jones and her bogus claim that she had an affair with Douglas."   So, aside from  the sinister death threats , everything was just  urlLink peaches and herb ?&nbsp;    In :  urlLink Fortuna . Or, as  urlLink Dick Morris says :   "Success or defeat in the 2004 presidential campaign is likely to be determined more by events beyond the control of Sen. John Kerry or even that of President Bush. The irony is that it is the intensity of the war on terror, more than any other factor, that will seal the fate of the two candidates.   "We have never had an election quite like this one."   Luck may end up determining who is our next&nbsp;President.&nbsp;    Out :&nbsp; Congressman Harold Ford . This guys unchecked ambition&nbsp;just really fucking gets to me.  urlLink I don't like his face .  urlLink Here he is , in nearly every picture, making  urlLink empty hand gestures , saying, most probably, nothing. All ambition, no talent, no originality. Grr... I just don't like him. It must be chemical.      &nbsp;           &nbsp;    &nbsp;

       Ed Note : Defamer readers: The&nbsp;Christina Applegate and Ben Affleck story is right  urlLink here     Deep ... Deep Inside The Bohemian Grove    While boldface&nbsp;aristocrats like  George Herbert Walker Bush ,  Henry Kissinger ,  Dick Cheney ,  John Major ,  Alexander Haig ,  Alan Greenspan ,  Newt Gingrich ,  Jack Kemp ,  Colin Powell , and  William F. Buckley, Jr.,  who, Atlas-like,&nbsp;carry the weight of the free world on their veal-like preppy shoulders, urinate freely among the California redwoods ( Ed Note : The Bohemian Grove is all male, because, like,&nbsp; everyone knows that girls have cooties ), performing secret Bohemian Grove handshakes, crying into their cocktails over the&nbsp;good old days&nbsp;of the Cold War, dolled&nbsp;up like  urlLink Tououse-Lautrec girls , doing each others mascara, curling each others' hair,&nbsp;exchanging moist looks, performing torch songs and lurid little  urlLink Edith Piaf  numbers,&nbsp;ultimately&nbsp;passing out in the great outdoors lying doggo next to their hombres,&nbsp;spent,&nbsp;with a sly satisfied&nbsp;smile of world domination gently&nbsp;playing on&nbsp;their thin, blue vampirelike lips, like the Masters of the Universe that they are,  ahem (averted gaze, exaggerated cough, feigned detatchment) ,  The Corsair  cannot fail to note the&nbsp;curious  homoerotic  undertones that such activities appear to suggest, especially coming from&nbsp;such a bastion on ultraconservative manliness as The Grove.    Will Donald Rumsfeld procede to tease his&nbsp;coif and don Manolo Blahnik's ?    &nbsp;  The  urlLink San Francisco Chronicle  delves into the super-secret world of these modern day Boyz N the Woods:   "On Saturday, some 2,000 CEOs and politicos and arty types arrived at the cool redwoods and lily-choked lake of the Grove, the famous Russian River playground of the powerful  urlLink Bohemian Club (link via  urlLink Gawker ).   "They say it's the place to be seen in America in July. Except, of course, you can't see them."   Of course you can't playboy, because: "Signs abound: No Thru Traffic. No Trespassing. Members and Guests Only. No Turn Around. Sentries scan the paths from above with binoculars, helped out by infrared sensors."    The Corsair &nbsp;pitches forward,&nbsp;plowing through  urlLink the X-Files vibe , on a very hush-hush  strictly need-to-know  basis:   "And what are those important men doing out there for 17 days behind that elaborate security?  Slipping into frocks and putting on pageants. The Bohemian Club, a beguiling mix of ultra-power hangout and high school play, is one of several elite private clubs in San Francisco, curious islands of conservatism amid a forest of Kerry for President signs."   Or, as that "Tricky Dick,"  Richard Nixon  said,  urlLink according to Page Six , with characteristic  swellegance ,"'the most faggy goddamned thing you could ever imagine.'"    That Nixon , he  was  a bigoted little pisser, but he had a special place in his black heart for the sissies and the darkies.  Coincidentally , as Page Six also deliciously relates, "THE power-moguls and political heavyweights now luxuriating at ultra-exclusive retreat Bohemian Grove are unaware that they're being waited on hand-and-foot by a famous gay porn star. "    Say what ? They continue, true believer:   "We're told that  'Chad Savage ,' who has appeared in such carnal classics as 'How the West Was Hung,' is supplementing his sex job by working as a valet at Bohemian Grove, the all-male annual gathering inside a 2,700-acre redwood forest in Monte Rio, Calif., that has been attended by every Republican president since Calvin Coolidge, as well as by industrial titans and media magnates.   "'All of us valets in the Grove are tittering about it,' says our Bohemian blabbermouth. 'To think there's all these powerful conservative guys having their drinks and food served to them by a gay porn star. He makes their beds and attends to their every need — and they have no idea who he really is.'"   Should be  just like boarding school,  only less sodomy.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;

       A Little of the Old In and Out     &nbsp;   In :  Tuscany:  it's the new St. Barts, "ecktually" ( Averted Gaze )&nbsp;According to the  urlLink LA.Com blog , Vanity Fair's Winston Light whiffing, Kirby's English socks wearing,  urlLink architectonically  tressed, son-of-a-gun editor, who, in point of fact,&nbsp;has not been able to find space on the cover of his glossy in  years  for a single&nbsp;African-American in the entertainment industry (I  think  there are a couple out there:  Prince ,  Oprah ,  Halle ,  Will Smith, Tiger Woods,  just to name a few ...), is headed&nbsp;to Tuscany:   "It's our loss and Italy's gain. Or perhaps the other way around? Graydon Carter, the  urlLink Vanity Fair  editor-in-chief beleaguered by conflict-of-interest  urlLink accusations  in recent months, had long planned to spend the rest of this summer up at LA?s swank  urlLink Hotel Bel-Air . But no more. Sources say Carter just cancelled those long-held reservations and instead will be summering at a friend's home in Tuscany. No reason was given for the switch, but I bet Carter's feelings about our fair city have been adversely affected by all those juicy Los Angeles Times articles about his personal Hollywood projects winding up being lauded on VF?s glossy pages. Will Carter change his 'tude by Oscar time?"    Out :  Jessica Simpson . Thank God for  urlLink British Vogue , so that when we are tired from&nbsp;wrestling with&nbsp; urlLink Sallust 's vivisection of First Century Rome, we can rest our fevered minds, crack open a cold one, hang mellow ...&nbsp; and get in touch with our inner picklehead,  to wit:   "JESSICA SIMPSON may have a reputation for being a bit ditzy, but she knows a good thing when she sees it. Since the blonde MTV reality show star draped a multi-coloured shawl around her shoulders during an episode of Newlyweds: Nick & Jessica she has had a marked impression on the fashion economy in Argentina and, in particular, on the 28 knitters in a factory outside Buenos Aires and model-turned-designer Cecilia de Bucourt. 'Since Jessica started wearing my shawls I got more and more demands from her fans who love her style and what she wears,' De Bucourt told AP. 'I'd say it tripled my production in just four months.' Jessica, who bought her shawl in a boutique on New York's Upper East Side for $200 is pleased that she's been able to share some of her good fortune. 'I never would have thought that my love for shopping could have such a meaningful impact on someone's life,' the 24-year-old singer said. 'Nick and I have gotten a lot of attention from reality television but this is the kind of reality that really matters.'"      What really matters , yes, you dingy broad--&nbsp;nothing says&nbsp;"meaningful impact on people's lives"  quite  like a shawl.    In : Ben Affleck showed the cast and crew of Surviving Christmas his " urlLink junk on the briefcase ."&nbsp;But now&nbsp;Benben is&nbsp;going to show the world his&nbsp;kung fu grasp&nbsp;of geopolitical issues, as the most excellent  urlLink Rush and Molloy report &nbsp;(3rd item):   "Look for Ben Affleck to address the Democratic Convention Tuesday night in Boston. The local boy's rep confirms, 'We're finalizing details now.'"   Note to delegates: Please keep your briefcases out of&nbsp;Ben Affleck's&nbsp;reach.   Out : The  wacky  pseudodivorce procedings of  Vanessa Williams and Jason Foxx , according to the  urlLink National Enquirer :   "Williams and Fox live on opposite coastsVanessa Williams and her husband, L.A. Laker Rick Fox, have a bizarre relationship, even by Hollywood standards -- he cheats on her, they live apart and decide to divorce, but they never file the court papers!   "'It's the wackiest divorce in showbiz -- they've spent 18 months talking about splitting up and do nothing!' said a source close to the couple.   "After The ENQUIRER published a photo of Fox kissing a beautiful blonde on June 25 ... Fox's publicist confirmed the marriage was over. Fox was caught red-handed in a nightclub called Da Dawghouse in Waikiki, Hawaii. He was supposed to be in Honolulu for preseason training. But the hoop star was more interested in going one-on-one with the blonde. He danced with her and even had his hands between her legs as she sat at the bar, according to an eyewitness.   "While Rick lives on the West Coast and Vanessa lives on the East Coast, their publicists need to meet somewhere in the middle and get their stories straight! Vanessa's publicist Brad Cafarelli told The ENQUIRER: 'They are not separated. Vanessa has not filed for divorce.'   "But Fox's publicist Staci Wolfe was more forthcoming and told us: 'They are heading for a divorce and have been so for the last 18 months. They've virtually been leading separate lives.'   "Added an insider: 'They may get a divorce next week or they may get a divorce in another 18 months. It's wacky. But they do love their kids. And it will break both their hearts when they make it final.'"    In :&nbsp;&nbsp;Page Six's  Paula Froelich .  urlLink Brandusa Niro's Fashionweekdaily  tells us: "It seems that the ongoing interest in the gossip world and its wars has spurred&nbsp;a burst of creativity from Page Sixer  Paula Froelich . We're told Froelich just submitted a proposal for a novel based on a gossip columnist's life.

It's the end of the world as we know it.  The Corsair  shivers.    In :  Meghan Stier's  wonderful  urlLink Megastyles  is back! "She used to write mainly about fashion here," says Meghan of her sexy self,"&nbsp;but now uses this blog like everybody else uses their blogs: to muse cathartically about cereal and shoelaces."   We have such a mad crush on Meghan, it's not funny.&nbsp;&nbsp;    Out :  Will Smith's Willie . According to Ireland Online:   "Will Smith has had his manhood chopped out of new movie I, Robot in the US, but the sight of will thrill fans in Europe.Smith bares all in a shower scene in the new sci-fi adventure film, which stormed to the top of the American box office at the weekend, but fans in the US will miss the actor's full frontal shot thanks to a little last-minute digital work.   The actor chose to reveal all in the scene to show how vulnerable his paranoid character is - but producers feared censors would cause a fuss, and cut the sight of Smith's manhood from the film.The disappointed star says: 'It's interesting because America is the only place that it's really a big deal.'The scene in this movie was full frontal nudity, but they had to digitally remove it. It was the most expensive CGI shot in the movie. I hope the nude scene appears in other countries.'   "Smith only plucked up the courage to take on the shower scene in the first place after watching Harvey Keitel appear totally nude in controversial director Abel Ferrara's 1992 movie, Bad Lieutenant.He says: 'I saw Bad Lieutenant with Harvey Keitel and I looked at that scene, and Harvey Keitel is just standing there butt naked, and it's almost like the attitude is like: 'Yeah, look at this here.'I'd love to be that comfortable with nudity, but I'll never be that good an actor.'"    The Corsair  agrees.

       Ice T: 'I Don't Want to Eat Dog Shit' &nbsp;   &nbsp;  From Elemental Magazine, Issue 59:   "There was ... a rumor about Ice (T) &nbsp;making an appearance on Celebrity Fear Factor?   "'I was at a party with the President of NBC.' he recalls, 'he's like the big pimp, he controls everything. I'm telling him I like Fear Factor.' He was like 'Would you like to do Fear Factor?' I'm talking all this shit, I'm like 'Hell yeah, I'll do it.' Within a week the phone rang. My boy answered the phone and was like 'Yo, Ice, they are calling about Fear Factor.' I was like 'Oh my God, I can't go on Fear Factor, I might go out in the first round. 'Plus, I dont want to eat dog shit. I was like, 'Nah, I got a back problem.' Really just truly bitched out on that one.'"    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;

       Christina Applegate on Ben Affleck's "Stuff"    It appears that&nbsp;" urlLink the little white haired girl " from&nbsp;Fox's  Married with Children  is all grown up, and, uh,&nbsp;comfortable with&nbsp;Ben Affleck's&nbsp;"saucy" behavior.&nbsp;   From  Hollywood Life , July-August 2004 :&nbsp;    Hollywood Life : You have two indies coming out-- urlLink Employee of the Month  and  urlLink Grand Theft Parsons  -- both of which played this year at Sundance. Be honest. How much free merchandise did you get for just showing up at the festival?    Applegate : It's so sick. We had to get an extra bag because the swag was unbelievable. The best thing we got was a 40 inch flat screen tv ...   (The interview is interrupted when the song  urlLink 'Milkshake'  starts playing on Applegate's cell phone)    HL : How hard is it not to start dancing when your phone rings?    Applegate : I always do. I have a lot of different rings. My husband's (Ed Note:  urlLink Jonathan Schaech ) is  urlLink 'Lips Like Sugar' by Echo and the Bunnymen .    HL : That makes sense ... what is it like working with Ben Affleck on  urlLink Surviving Christmas ?    Applegate : He's very silly on set. I just wanted him to be quiet so I could work. There's something specific he did that made me laugh but it would ruin his reputation.    HL : If I gave you a flat-screen tv would you tell me?    Applegate : (Laughs) OK, they were doing an insert shot of a briefcase or something, and Ben just decided to put his  urlLink "stuff" &nbsp;on the briefcase. He would always do things like that:  urlLink mooning , sticking his tongue in the director's ear. He's very goofy. I just admire him.   I've heard of junk in the trunk, but junk on the briefcase?! Actually,  The Corsair  tried to be goofy like this at another job's Christmas party&nbsp;but, unfortunately, as he was not an A-Lister, &nbsp;he was charged with sexual harrassment and a restraining order was issued. What can I say?  Mi vida loca .  &nbsp;

       A Little of The Old In and Out  &nbsp;    In :  urlLink Target's Brooklyn Outpost Opening Party , at least as described by a&nbsp;rosy cheeked&nbsp; urlLink Gawker reader . Was it  urlLink the Roman historian Sallust  who said, in the brilliant  urlLink Conspiracy of Catiline &nbsp;(a history of corruption in the Roman Empire of the 1st Century AD),&nbsp;that the words must fit the event described? If so, then the&nbsp;surreal flow of prose immediately below, should match  precisely  the  oddness  of  urlLink Target's opening &nbsp;a outpost in the BK:   "Men in red eyeshadow and girls with Robert Smith hair -- they've never been to Atlantic Center! I'm not fooled -- and doing shots of tequila? That's not going to work out in the end. And then what I was more ashamed of myself was how sad I was that in two weeks, once this joint is open to masses of brooklyn trash who make Pathmark unusable, I will never again be able to admire the rows and rows of blue greeting cards and purchase them with matching envelopes or peruse the aisles of Gatorade without witnessing parents beat their children in the middle and the dirty sick part of me just wants Target to stay exactly like it was last night."   It is the dirty sick parts in which this blog is concerned. As you will soon see ...&nbsp;    Out : &nbsp; urlLink Chris Rock's recipe for crack .  A very special Corsair , where funnyman Chris Rock talks to Jenna Jameson and Court Love's pal, Neil Strauss about proper lactose levels when making your own "crack rock".&nbsp; His worst career move since playing " urlLink Nat X " on SNL.    In :  The   Jackasses . These&nbsp;cats&nbsp;are having a hell of a good time in the limelight, all told, true believers. According to  urlLink The Star, that significant cultural artifact :   "Though&nbsp;(Johnny Knoxville's) still married to his wife of seven years, Melanie (with whom he has a daughter,  Madison , 6) he too loves to party ( Ed. Note : no shit) . 'Just like on the show, he's incredibly spontaneous and funny,' says a source close to Knoxville. 'It's just what Kate needs after the split.' The two were reportedly spotted in New York on June 17 having lunch and then later that night were caught fondling at the trendy rockers  Franz Ferdinand  concert at Webster Hall. Then on July 1, the two were reportedly spied canoodling at a pub in North London. 'She spent the whole evening all over Johnny,' a source reported. A pal of Knoxville told Star: 'Johnny and Kate are very, very, very close friends. But yes, he's still married.'"   And, what's more,  urlLink British Vogue reports :   "SEEMS that a Jackass face is the latest supermodel accessory. Kate Moss' friendship with the sexy star of the show,  Johnny Knoxville , has been well documented and now  urlLink May Anderson  has taken her example. The sultry catwalker was spotted strolling hand-in-hand with Knoxville's sidekick,  Steve-O , in New York this week. Apparently roller skating backwards off cliffs and falling out of supermarket trolleys is the way to get the girl ..."   Just last week, I was out with a sophisticated woman who extolled the virtues of the Jackass crew&nbsp;against a barrage of my derision; she sustained the argument all through lunch.  Women like risk takers , I suppose, and these guys represent that; although it's hard for me to fathom through all the playa hating. If anyone can explain this phenomenon to me, I'm at  urlLink papermag@yahoo.com . Until then, I'll console myself with the notion that these guys don't do  urlLink yoga  every day and keep a  urlLink dream journal  like I do.&nbsp; So there .    Out :  urlLink The Smoking Gun  publishes what may be one of the strangest stories ever, and that, for SmokingGun, is quite a feat indeed:   "A Florida man assaulted his girlfriend with a three-foot alligator during a domestic dispute Friday morning, according to cops.  David Havennar , 41, was charged with battery for smacking girlfriend  Nancy Monico  in the ribs with the gator, who lived in a bathtub in Havennar's Port Orange home, according to the below Volusia County Sheriff's Office report. Monico told deputies that she did not know why Havennar had an alligator in his bathtub, but claimed her beau was 'torturing' the reptile. However, an examination of the reptile--which was seized by state wildlife officials--showed no signs of abuse. Monico, on the other hand, suffered minor injuries to her lip, legs, and back area, according to investigators. For his part, Havennar claimed that Monico started the 9 AM dustup when she 'bit him on the hand because she was mad about being out of alcohol.'"   The rough patches of any relationship can be lubricated, I suppose,&nbsp;with a lusty sip of the old "Budweiser." But,  The Corsair  imagines,&nbsp;Monico probably didn't "cook up the possum and fixins" to his liking.&nbsp;Monico might even possibly have been "messing with his crank," &nbsp;meriting the&nbsp;lamentable minor injuries to the "back area," so skillfully described in the police report.&nbsp;And, of course, the  urlLink coup de grace ,  urlLink in his mugshot , this paragon of manliness&nbsp;is not even wearing a shirt. Like  urlLink Shaq's biological :  He didn't bother . Domestic violence, pet reptiles, argumenst over domestic beer, unselfconscious shirtlessness -- you see where I'm going with this:  urlLink Can you guess&nbsp;this man's&nbsp;socioeconomic class ?   Only in Florida, kiddies, only in Florida.    In :  The New York Observer . The salmon colored weekly, every once in a while, turns in a chestnut, gets it right, makes us proud to be in (The Corsair traces invisible ironic quotation marks into thin air) "the media".  urlLink This is one such a moment &nbsp;(link via  urlLink Gawkie poo ). Observe, as the intrepid&nbsp;Observer staff&nbsp;catch our specimen,&nbsp;a  urlLink rara avis , one&nbsp; P Diddy , in mid-hustle:   "Sean (P. Diddy) Combs is not known for being at a loss for words.   "But the hip-hop impresario was speechless for several seconds when The  urlLink  Transom asked him about his own voting record at a press conference on Tuesday morning to introduce Citizen Change, the voter-registration task force that he founded. Asked about the last time he’d voted, Mr. Combs, wearing sunglasses and a dark sports jacket over a 'Vote or Die' T-shirt, confessed that he last entered a voting booth and pulled the lever in 2000. Mr. Combs stood at a podium in Kimmel Auditorium at N.Y.U., surrounded by red-white-and-blue balloons in front of an audience that half-expected him to launch his own run for office.   "When queried whether he voted in city elections, Mr. Combs said, 'No.' An awkward silence ensued; the microphone squealed. Could he elaborate on why? 'To be honest, I’m just—I was just as disenfranchised as the younger disenfranchised voters,' he stammered, before the smooth-talking salesman kicked in. 'It’s just recently, in 2000, that I started to educate myself and understand the way the system works. So that’s what makes this thing so much more relevant, because I’m not talking from the outside. I understand a lot about how young people feel and how minorities feel; we feel that the system doesn’t work. But I can’t just sit back and complain about it, you know—I can do something about it. So I don’t have a long-lasting record history of voting, but I do have a long-lasting record of communicating and motivating and energizing and synergizing young people and, you know, I’m just like them. You know, I didn’t believe in the process, so I can explain to young people why they should get motivated with this.' The applause was thunderous. "    The Corsair  quietly&nbsp;sips pimp juice from an "icy" custom made  urlLink pimp goblet .   "'Now wasn’t that a good answer!?' shouted a member of the Citizen Change posse, a group that includes political bulldog  urlLink James Carville , who showed up in a sport coat, pink shirt and green plaid tie to fulfill his duties as chairman. ('He didn’t take no paper because he knows we ain’t got no money,' Mr. Combs had said earlier. 'He was so nice to donate his time.')   The bullshit-hustle continues  urlLink here  at  urlLink Wagnerian length . And yet you can't stop reading. &nbsp;    Out :  Giorgio Armani  is on the outs with the Old Gray Lady; he's got his panties in a twist,&nbsp;according to  urlLink British Vogue ,  chill  Giorgio:   "GIORGIO ARMANI has pulled all future ads from the New York Times after its  urlLink somewhat negative review of his spring/summer 2005 menswear collection.  Famous for previously refusing to advertise in US Vogue because, he claimed, it did not give him enough editorial support, the designer first reacted to the show report by taking out a full-page spread to highlight his more flattering reviews. And he is now refusing to advertise again until further notice. 'It is correct that the Armani Group has removed the New York Times newspaper (not the New York Times Magazine) from its advertising plan,' a spokesperson for the company told The Daily. 'This decision has been taken as a result of the existence of a persistent and significant philosophical difference with the newspaper's fashion desk. We have no other comment to make at this time.' The review, which appeared in the July 4 issue of the paper, read as follows: 'The creative possibilities of Italian fashion were once clearly synonymous with the name of Giorgio Armani. When exactly, one wonders, did that stop being the case? It is not so much that talk about corporate succession has damaged the image as the designer approaches 70. It is not that people have forgotten Mr Armani's profound contributions to fashion design. It is that shows like the one Mr Armani presented this week seem errant, confounding and stuck in a vision of an unrecognisable world.'"   That  urlLink Guy Trebay &nbsp;( The Corsair  softly chuckles), causing all sorts of ruckus and  hullaballoo (Averted Gaze) .&nbsp;    In : &nbsp; Tony Brown . Have you ever seen our favorite African-American "self-help" Republican show&nbsp; urlLink Tony Bown's Journal on PBS ? The show was&nbsp;decidedly low rent, but informative, sort of like a tv version of  urlLink Jet Magazine  without the class; I learned about  urlLink George Washington Carver's &nbsp;little -- ahem  -- "innovations&nbsp;on the theme of almonds" on this program .&nbsp;   Tony Brown's Journal&nbsp;definitely had a sort of  urlLink X-File-ish vibe  of conspiracy about it; whiffs of schizophrenia, really; as a kid&nbsp;this show&nbsp;kind of freaked me out. If you haven't seen Tony Brown's Journal, you missed out on hard-hitting discussions on lead poisoning, hypertension, the possible consequences of the the Y2K computer bug, and the use of Malathion to combat an outbreak of mosquito-borne encephalitis. You  see where I'm going with this . Let's just say that the show is a little "eccentric,"&nbsp;even "odd." And let's leave it at that, so that in my memories, when I  urlLink look backward ,&nbsp;the show has a warm, kind  urlLink patina &nbsp;to it.&nbsp;    Anyhoo : Tony Brown, apparently, will be the  urlLink new Dean  (link via  urlLink Romenesko ) of Hampton University's&nbsp;Scripps Howard School of Journalism and Communications.&nbsp; Far out, Tony Brown's School Days.    True story : I saw Tony Brown at a fast food Chinese restaurant in Manhattan&nbsp;roughly five years ago. He had the  urlLink General Tso's chicken , I believe. He was wearing earth tone short pants and his legs were in dire need of cocoa butter. My childhood image of him was shattered.    Out : According to&nbsp;the excellent  urlLink Rush and Molloy &nbsp;(5th Item),  Michael Moore  is defending  urlLink Linda Ronstadt in her fracas , going so far as offering to sing for his supper:   "'Fahrenheit 9/11' filmmaker Michael Moore is aflame after hearing that Las Vegas' Aladdin Hotel &amp; Casino ejected Linda Ronstadt. As we told you yesterday, Aladdin security showed the singer the door when she hailed Moore as her 'Desperado.'   "Blasting the move as 'stupid and un-American,' Moore told the Aladdin president in a letter: 'Invite her back and I'll join her in singing 'America the Beautiful' on your stage."   Oh, dear lord, please don't, Michael. You are a talented filmmaker, let's leave it at that.

       A Little of the Old In and Out     &nbsp;   In: Polo,  baby,  urlLink polo &nbsp;( The Corsair  repeats,  sotto voce ,  urlLink one more time , with&nbsp;solemnity in his tone and salt in his game, he whispers: "Po- lo ").&nbsp; That's not teen spirit in the air, true believers, it's  urlLink horse-musk ; horse musk, freshly manicured grounds, and the sounds of soft chuckling, as the specially-imported South American players (the  second  South American import of choice) roam the night in search of a little of the old in and out. It's  summer , playboy, which means, quite frankly,&nbsp;that  Polo  is&nbsp;so very "in"&nbsp;among the&nbsp;chubby, sweaty,  urlLink shortfingered Hamptons vulgarians  who tend to look not unlike  urlLink Harvey Weinstein , and graze annually, with the slow certitude of  urlLink apex predators , &nbsp;at their favorite watering holes in the Hamptons; they dine, of course, &nbsp;on the lean, juicy and tender&nbsp;meat of fashion models. ( The Corsair  puts on his&nbsp;urban anthropolgist's gear, grabs a tropical butterfly net, and sets to work)  urlLink Fashionweekdaily  assesses the talent in the room:  &nbsp;  "The crowds consensus of the sixth-annual Bridgehampton Polo event was that it was a more laid back, mellower scene than in years past. Granted even without an  urlLink SLR  in attendance?there was no lack of flash, thanks to the dozens of other high-priced Benzes parked on the fields, the  urlLink Zino platinum cigars  many gentlemen and even a few women were seen puffing on, and the last-minute arrival of a statuesque and pregnant  urlLink Stephanie Seymour  (hubby  urlLink Peter Brant , who owns Interview magazine, is also the VP of the Bridgehampton Polo Club). The afternoons mistress of ceremonies,  urlLink Jessica Alba , who flew to the Hamptons via helicopter, arrived wearing a floral chiffon Jil Sander dress, Christian Louboutin peep-toe sandals, and a white Louis Vuitton Suhali bag, accessorized with a pink diamond cross she designed herself and a 20-karat heart-shaped ring from Jacob the Jeweler. 'This is my first time in the Hamptons,' said  urlLink Alba , who spent most of her time in the VIP tent. 'It feels just like Connecticut, but more laid back.'"  &nbsp;  Okay, okay, so she's not  sophisticated  -- she's still very pretty and she dresses nice.&nbsp;    &nbsp;   Out: Badgely Mishka.   urlLink According to British Vogue , despite the fact that Badgely Mishka has annual&nbsp;retail sales&nbsp;of $40 million a year, and  urlLink Charlotte from Sex and the City  wore their dress to her wedding:   " MARK BADGLEY  and  James Mischka  announced this week that they would not be producing a spring/summer 2005 collection, having failed to find funding for it. The star design duo, who launched their label 16 years ago after meeting at Parsons School of Design, initially financed Badgley Mischka themselves with family money. In 1992, they sold an estimated 80 per cent of the business to Escada. However, as part of the cost-cutting initiative that it launched in 2001, the German fashion giant has admitted that it is no longer willing to come up with the&nbsp;($927,000) that it costs to produce a collection of Badgley Mischka exquisitely embroidered evening dresses. The label was put up for sale last October and, despite several companies having shown interest, the designers said jointly yesterday that 'an agreement has not been finalised thus far and funding is therefore not available for a spring/summer collection.'"&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;   This is a Tragedy.  I covered the tents&nbsp;during  urlLink Fall Fashion Week in&nbsp;2000 &nbsp;for a small consumer publication, and Badgley Mishka, by far,&nbsp;blew me away; nothing came close to their excellence.  The Corsair , a fan of beautiful things, sincerely hopes that the show will go on at  Badgley Mishka , purveyor of stunning swishy things.  &nbsp;   In :  Winona Ryder, o r, in the words of Kentucky-born fellow waif  urlLink Johnny Depp's tatoo, "Wino Forever ."According to  urlLink AFlyonthewall  a strange Winona scene unfolded:  &nbsp;  "The other night, diners at Beverly Hills restaurant Kate Mantilini were treated to a bizarre, impromptu performance by convicted thief Winona Ryder. Ryder was eating quietly with two young women who had the twitchy, skittish appearance of personal assistants."  &nbsp;   The Corsair  softly chuckles.&nbsp;   "Toward the end of their meal, however, Ryder loudly began demanding that one of the young women 'give it to me!' After a few minutes of noisy Ryder histrionics, according to eyewitnesses, one of the young women reluctantly handed a cellular phone to the actress. Ryder then made an immediate beeline for the ladies' room. A few minutes later, diners heard Ryder screaming and crying loudly as she pleaded with someone named Ricky on the phone in the john. 'No, no, no, Ricky, you promised!' Ryder wailed repeatedly. Several curious female diners made their way to the restroom, where they found Ryder squatting on the bathroom floor moaning into the cellphone. When Ryder saw that she had an appreciative audience, however, she began screaming obscenities at the women and locked herself in the bathroom. About ten minutes later, a smudgy-eyed Ryder quickly exited the john and out a restaurant side door, then climbed into an arriving limousine. Her female dining companions were left to pick up the check. Coincidentally, Kate Mantilini is right down the street from the scene of Ryder's department store thieving performance. While Ryder has been known to credit bizarre public behavior in the past to 'research for a part,' she's not presently working. She was slated to shoot Oskur Fishman this summer with Ben Kingsley, but financing fell apart at the last minute. Ryder finished filming  urlLink A Scanner Darkly  in June, a Richard Linklater adaptation of the Philip K. Dick novel."  &nbsp;   Out :   urlLink Chad Lowe ;  that&nbsp;poor fucker, as if it isn't bad enough that  urlLink Rob  got all the looks and acting talent, and you got stuck with the&nbsp;unremarkable name, "Chad,"&nbsp;dooming you from the start to a life of mediocrity, and, finally, directing some low grade piece of ass tv show called, &nbsp; urlLink Hack . ( A reptilian gleam alights  The Corsair's  eyes) But according to  urlLink NY Daily News' Lloyd Grove  (2nd item),&nbsp;Chad&nbsp;&nbsp;is using his wife's juice --  again (A  verted gaze)  :   &nbsp;  " urlLink Soho House is, like, so last year . But, as Chad Lowe learned the hard way, it's still not any easier to get inside.   "Lowdown hears that the 36-year-old actor - better known as Rob's younger brother and Hilary Swank's hubby - showed up at the ultra-exclusive, British-accented club on Saturday and attempted entry with a group of friends.   "When the young women at the front desk couldn't locate his name in the member database, Lowe told them, 'I'm about to be a member in a week.' But after a bit of back-and-forth, it became clear that he had never even submitted an application. 'Er, can I just apply now?'  No dice: Soho House aspirants must be nominated by two members in good standing before submitting their application to a strict committee, which meets just once every three months.  Which left Lowe with Plan C: Hinting that if the club let him in, his wife would begin making frequent Soho House cameos. Alas, even that didn't work, so finally Lowe and his posse were forced to slink away.  &nbsp;  " ...  urlLink The New York Times recently reported  that when Lowe's assistant was unsuccessful in reserving a table at the fully booked West Village restaurant  urlLink Hue , he sniffed, 'That's a shame, because his wife, Academy Award-winner Hilary Swank, is very hungry.'"  &nbsp;  So pathetic.  &nbsp;   In :  urlLink The National Enquirer's  ultra-trashy, horrible, excessive, raw sewage of a journalistic expose on Britney Spears'&nbsp;"roots." Here's  urlLink a taste &nbsp;(guaranteed, you'll have to take a looong, cold shower after reading this one, kids):  &nbsp;  "Superstar Britney Spears' erratic behavior has been generating headlines for nearly a year, but she's one of the most stable individuals in her family!   "Britney has a dark family secret -- two of her uncles are ex-cons with long rap sheets for crimes in three states, The ENQUIRER has learned exclusively from court records.   "While Britney has amassed a fortune living the glamorous life, one of her uncles is known as 'Road Kill Willie' because sources say he likes to scoop up critters that have been hit by cars and cook them for dinner!   "Road Kill Willie has been busted for burglary, drug distribution and being a deadbeat dad, according to court records. He is the brother of Britney's father Jamie.  &nbsp;  "... Britney's other uncle, June Spears, has been charged with assault with a deadly weapon, driving under the influence and beating his wife, say court records.   "Sources close to the family tell The ENQUIRER that Britney avoids her uncles whenever she goes home to Kentwood, La. (And she never dines with Road Kill Willie!)"  &nbsp;  "... Willie spends most of the time living in tents and camper trailers or sleeping in cars.   "'Until recently, Willie was living in an 18-foot trailer on a riverbank outside of Kentwood,' said the insider. 'But Willie got hard up for cash and ended up selling his trailer for $60.   "These days he sleeps in his van or stays with friends. 'June lives about the same way as Willie, squatting anywhere he can.'  &nbsp;  "Britney's dad sometimes gives Road Kill Willie, 46, and June, 41, work with his construction company, said a source. But the source said the pair fight so much, one of them usually has to go."  &nbsp;  Read  urlLink here  if you want the 411 on&nbsp;the&nbsp;restraining orders, the DUI's, the spousal abuses and the public intoxication&nbsp;charges filed&nbsp;against&nbsp;the "possum eatin' kinfolk"&nbsp; who share&nbsp;Britney's  urlLink DNA signature .  &nbsp;   Out : According to  urlLink Hello! Magazine , Brad buys Jennifer Aniston Liz Taylor's yacht:  &nbsp;  " Brad Pitt  has bought his wife  Jennifer Aniston  a piece of Hollywood history - the yacht once owned by Richard Burton and silver screen goddess  Elizabeth Taylor .The 165ft Kalizma was originally purchased by Richard Burton in 1967, when he wanted to congratulate Liz on her Oscar for Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?. The couple named it after their three children together, Kate, Liza and Marie."  &nbsp;  "... (Richard Burton)&nbsp;paid $148,000 when he bought the yacht, but it is reported to set Brad back by a staggering ($5,500.000). With enough room to sleep ten people and a crew of eight, it features an antique-furnished dining-room, four-poster beds and artworks by Picasso, Monet and Van Gogh."&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus forever&nbsp;negating any future, "but there so down to earth" lines.  &nbsp;   In :&nbsp;  urlLink Quadruplets  . According to  urlLink Reuters :  "Pop star Michael Jackson, facing a trial on child molestation charges, is about to become a father to four more children -- quadruplets -- by way of a surrogate mother, Us Weekly magazine reported on Tuesday.

       Ha Mavin, Yavin     &nbsp;  First  urlLink Lenny Kravitz and Denzel Washington's new club  was named after a  urlLink Persian slang word for pussy . Now,  urlLink mirabile dictu , Madonna has taken to singing in another Near Eastern Language, namely, Yiddish,  urlLink according to The Sun :  &nbsp;  "(Madonna) has taken to singing in  urlLink Yiddish , an ancient German-based language used by Jews.   "... It’s another departure from the mainstream for Madge — or Esther as she prefers her friends to call her now she’s gone over to the Jewish sect.   "The first people to be subjected to Madge’s attempt at singing in the native tongue of her new religion were a small crowd of partygoing, rock ’n’ roll rabbis.   "A source at the party said: 'Madonna was performing for  urlLink Kabbalah guru Phillip Berg  at his house in New York.   "She performed two songs in Yiddish in front of 50 or so guests. The staff working at the party were baffled when she took to the stage. I think most people were expecting her to belt out one of her big Top Ten hits.&nbsp; It was a really odd spectacle watching Madonna launch into some Yiddish tunes.   "Now there is talk the Queen Of Pop may release a song with Yiddish lyrics in it.   "Oh dear God, please, NO. "   That last sentence is editorial on behalf of the Sun, but  The Corsair  does not entirely disagree.  &nbsp;  Comment here or on  urlLink VH1's Best Week Ever  site.

       The New, "Urban" Tom Cruise&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Imagine my surprise when I got my annual invitation to the  urlLink Urbanworld Film Festival  this week and found,  urlLink mirabile dictu , that  urlLink Tom Cruise's Collateral will be screened opening night . &nbsp;  &nbsp;  It's not that Urbanworld (which is, by the way, far and large the best place in the world to "hook up" with gorgeous women of color; trust me on this one, true believers), is not "keeping it real," per se -- quite the contrary:  Tom Cruise , it appears,&nbsp;is metamorphosing into an urban persona. How cool is that?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if Tom and Jamie actually showed up at the opening of Urbanworld, surprising the mostly African-American, Asian and Latino audience into disbelief. &nbsp; Tom Cruise hasn't been the old Tom Cruise in a while, youknowwhatImean? He's lost the magic.&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The  urlLink "Tommy-Boy" shtick with Rosie O'Donnell  got really tiresome, really, really&nbsp;fast. And&nbsp;Tom Cruise's&nbsp;on-screen persona, which Artie Lang, the Howard Stern sidekick, acutely observed, was "too contrived," wore on our last nerve as well.&nbsp; Too much  urlLink fucking vanity  was being projected from those hawkish eyes and that studied, plastic, boyish-cocky&nbsp;grin.&nbsp; It was time for a makeover. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Tom Cruise&nbsp;was  Brian Flanagan , the best damn  urlLink drink slinger ;&nbsp;we knew him as  Cole Trickle , the best damn  urlLink race car driver ; he was  urlLink fucking Maverick , and, as we all know,&nbsp;"Mav" was the best damn  urlLink fighter pilot &nbsp;in the US Air Force; &nbsp;he was  Ethan Hunt , the best damn  urlLink covert agent ; he was even  Detective John Anderton  in Minority Report, the best damn  urlLink detective , with the help of those&nbsp;eerie  urlLink Precog's ; let's face it,&nbsp;throughout the 80s and 90s, Tom Cruise&nbsp;was the best damn everything. &nbsp;  &nbsp;   Of course , there is a backlash to wanting -- needing, really -- to project oneself onto the American consciousness as an icon of perfection, and&nbsp; the backlash&nbsp;is a bitch .&nbsp; We, infected with the virus " urlLink democratic leveling ," as the eminent American observer&nbsp; urlLink Alexis Henri Charles Maurice , Count de Tocqueville, described it, wanted to tear him down; that is&nbsp;a drawback&nbsp;of a democracy that  urlLink emphasizes equality  over an  urlLink aristocratic hierarchy  and the concept of excellence. Really bring him down a notch. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Tom noticed and changed his game rather abruptly. He got rid of his  urlLink publicist, Pat Kingsley , replacing her with his sister, Leanne Devette. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Tom Cruise is  urlLink more accessible than ever . &nbsp; And now, the new, "urban" Tom Cruise, playing straightman to Jamie Foxx in Collateral, appearing with him on the  urlLink ESPY's  and the  urlLink MTV Movie Awards , presents himself as no longer invincible. &nbsp; And, frankly, I like that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       Bill Clinton's Life  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   The Corsair  has read Bill Clinton's autobiography, and he liked it (although&nbsp;Clinton's quixotic&nbsp;digression on voodoo and zombies in Haiti&nbsp;made for&nbsp;disturbing nighttime reading) . New York's  urlLink Deborah Schoeneman &nbsp;chronicles some of New York's power players on  urlLink whether or not they had : &nbsp;  &nbsp;  "Bill Clintons 957-page bestseller, My Life, may be holding down every coffee table in Manhattan, but that doesnt mean anyones actually reading it ... Kevin Bacons not sure hell get around to it. 'Id love to, but Im dyslexic and reading is hard for me,' he says." &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Which may or may not be just &nbsp; urlLink Much Ado About Nothing , or, in fact, it may explain&nbsp;Kevin's rather&nbsp;fast and  urlLink footloose  relationship to  urlLink the concept ot Time , as  urlLink The New York Daily News' Rush and Molloy  relate today (3rd item): &nbsp;  &nbsp;  "It's gratifying to see that Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick have marital spats over things like clothes and punctuality, just like plain folks. '  &nbsp;  "Sedgwick was alone, looking at her watch and tapping her stilettos just before the start of 'Much Ado About Nothing' in Central Park last week when Bacon tore up at the last minute.  &nbsp;  "Sedgwick sliced and diced her hubby - and 'Cavedweller' co-star - right in front of big-eared photographers: She didn't like his timing, and she didn't like his outfit, sources report.  &nbsp;  "They then forced smiles for the cameras and hurried in." &nbsp;  &nbsp;   urlLink New York's Schoeneman&nbsp; continues in&nbsp;her quest -- like  urlLink Diogenes  -- to find an honest&nbsp;Clinton bio reader, no such luck with the grumpy and  urlLink recently bitchslapped critic Dale Peck : &nbsp;  &nbsp;  " urlLink Critic Dale Peck  has no plans to pick it up: 'I dont know a soul whos read it, or even expressed interest in reading it.' &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Finally: &nbsp; " urlLink Mort Zuckerman  was the only person we could track down who had finished the opus, and only because he had to review it. He calls it 'the most self-indulgent book I have ever read.'"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       A Little of The Old In and Out     &nbsp;   In :  urlLink Gary Hart . Although it appears that  John Forbes Kerry  has all but chosen  urlLink Richard Holbrooke , Diane Sawyer's former " urlLink himbo ", &nbsp;to be  urlLink Secretary of State  in his Administration&nbsp;in the event that&nbsp;he win the election, Hart, the former Colorado Senator, would be an incredible choice as Homeland Security chief, or, if it isn't beneath him, UN Ambassador, in a vamped up Cabinet level post. As  urlLink Henry the Intern at Gawker writes  of his Topic A appearance:  &nbsp;  "Gary Hart, former&nbsp;(Senator) from Colorado, author, and terrorism hound, predicted there would be biological attacks 'sooner rather than later' in Middle America. Good thing all of Middle America watches 'Topic A.' He criticized President Bush, domestic security, scandal-driven media, and expressed fear of the U.S. having 'a long-term agenda of dominating the politics of the Middle East [and] generally playing a more imperial role.'"  &nbsp;  Gloomy, yes; but the wise utterances of an Oxford PhD in Philosophy.&nbsp; Why the fuck isn't this&nbsp; urlLink Intellectual Patriot  the President?  &nbsp;   Out :  Oscar De La Renta , according to  urlLink British Vogue :  &nbsp;  " OSCAR DE LA RENTA  has handed over the title of chief executive of his eponymous company to his 36-year-old son-in-law,  urlLink Alex Bolen . Retaining his position as chairman, 71-year-old De La Renta, who set up the company in 1965, told Women's Wear Daily that this latest move will simply free him up to do more of the designing that he loves. 'I feel really great about it,' he said. 'I'm seeing the continuity of my business beyond my life span. That's important for my family and my employees. But I hope to go on for a long time - you know I'm a control freak.' Bolen, who is married to Oscar's stepdaughter, Eliza Reed Bolen, only joined the company last year at his father-in-law's request. "  &nbsp;   In :  urlLink Nicole Ritchie , who,  urlLink according to Ananova , had a "Nipplegate" episode of her own:  &nbsp;  "Lionel Richie's daughter Nicole had to show her breasts to airport security staff after her nipple ring triggered off metal detectors.   "Nicole, who stars with Paris Hilton in US reality TV show The Simple Life, was traveling from Reno, Nevada to New York City.   "She says: 'I said: "I'm pierced', and that usually is the end of it. And she said: 'Well, what are you gonna do about it?'  &nbsp;  "I said: 'Well, you can either scan it or ... I don't know what to tell you.' She said: 'Well, visually, I can't say that that is okay. Even if I look at it I can't say it's okay. I'm not even allowed to touch it.'  &nbsp;  "I'm like: 'What if I say you can touch it? It should be fine.' She's like: 'No, I'm not allowed to do that.'  &nbsp;  "So they brought in two female officers and took me not to necessarily the most private place in the airport and made me take off my top. Thank God I'm not a shy person, but what if I was shy?"  &nbsp;   Well , then you wouldn't be the  urlLink lovable Nicole Ritchie , easy  urlLink like Sunday morning ,&nbsp;that we know and love, right?  &nbsp;   Out :  urlLink The LA.com blog &nbsp;once again&nbsp;bewilders us with this sleazy piece of yum-yum:  &nbsp;  "While slithering up the ladder of TV and movie fame, this prodigiously sexy (and prodigiously well-endowed) actor won raves from scores of female journalists by seducing them, sometimes literally, whenever a pretty one came to interview him at some distant location. Now, slightly older, a bit scruffy around the edges, but still a raving horndog, the married-with-kids guy is happily enjoying the time he's gained from the cooling of his career. How? By plowing his way through erotic encounters with a dizzying succession of anonymous housemaids, waitresses, nannies, sales clerks, cocktail waitresses and Starbucks chicks. Meanwhile, his certifiably insane showbiz wife slaves away to put health food on their very expensive table."  &nbsp;  The&nbsp;people on the board mention both Sly Stallone and John Travolta.&nbsp;  &nbsp;   In : The " Is Meryl Streep Playing Hillary In The Manchurian Candidate Remake?"  question. Meryl Streep is tied for  The Corsair's  favorite actress with  urlLink Ingmar Bergman's  haunting -- and  urlLink haunted  --&nbsp;Muse,  urlLink Liv Ullman  and, our sleeper pick,&nbsp; urlLink Cate Blanchett , who, to us, &nbsp;can do no wrong. That question, some wonder, may have made stillborn the subliminal feelers&nbsp;put out&nbsp;to accumulate&nbsp;"Hillary for Vice President" buzz; I mean,  what , how does&nbsp;one run against Cheney when Streep is portraying her as " urlLink brilliantly evil " in the summer's blockbuster?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;   urlLink Newsweek Magazine  (link via  urlLink Drudgie poo )weighs in with:  &nbsp;  "'(Says&nbsp;the &nbsp;film's Producer Scott Rudin)I think this character is the closest Meryl's ever played to herself.' Is that a compliment? Must be. 'Actually,' Streep says, 'it's the closest to Scott Rudin that I've ever played.' In truth, she did have some models for the role. Just don't ask her who they were. "Never mind," she says, laughing. 'Fox News would love if I were doing Hillary, but that's so off the mark.'"  &nbsp;  But,  urlLink Flyonthewall  wrote, earlier this summer:  &nbsp;  "It doesn't help, either, that Meryl has a Hillary hairdo and wears Hillarian clothes and jewelry. 'Meryl has the Hillary hand gestures totally down pat,' my insider tells me. 'I don't know whether this is something she picked up subconsciously or an idea Jonathan gave her, but she's totally dead on. You feel like you're watching Hillary Clinton conspire to take over the world. The Republican Hillary-haters should totally eat this up.'"&nbsp;  &nbsp;  We'll see for ourselves.  &nbsp;   Out :  The Kravitz-Washington He Man Woman-Haters Club . According to the merry band of  urlLink Page Sixers :  &nbsp;  " Lenny Kravitz  and  Denzel Washington's  long-awaited members-only club, Kos, reportedly is close to opening.   "Kravitz's cousin, Kevin Connor, who is also the club's managing partner, confided to a PAGE SIX spy that 'Kos' is actually  urlLink a racy Persian slang term .

       Christian Slater: ChickenPox Gate      Christian Slater,  he who wore    urlLink a Nixon mask on Thursday  ,  has apparently come down with Chicken Pox!      Most curious , in an almost  urlLink David Lynchian  way, this turn of events.  urlLink According to the BBC :  "Slater, 34, was taken ill on Friday while rehearsing  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest  in London.  "However, its producers remain hopeful he will recover in time to appear in the first performance on 6 August.  "The show had earlier lost its director when  Guy Masterson  quit the production, blaming stress and family illnesses.  "'Felix Dexter, a member of the cast, was struck down with chicken pox in the second week of rehearsal,' said producer Nica Burns on Saturday.  "Christian and company are in fantastic spirits."  " Nica Burns  'We had hoped that the rest of the cast had escaped it, but yesterday Christian was taken ill and it is confirmed today that he has it.' "  What the  fuck ?! Let's drink this *alleged* preposterousness in for a minute, shall we? And, while we're drinking (A distraught  Corsair  haphazardly sips an  urlLink alluring aged champagne  from his  urlLink icy pimp goblet , to settle his nerves, you know), let's not make assumptions about this, but use logic, like  urlLink William of Baskerville , played by  urlLink Sean Connery  in  urlLink The Name of the Rose , which also starred, yes, the man in question,  Christian Slater .  Our boy Christian was at Stringfellows strip club on  urlLink Thursday night wearing a Nixon mask , that we know! He wouldn't take said mask off and, as a result, was  asked to leave . The mask is out of character for Christian, as  urlLink he usually just goes there 'as is .'  urlLink Often .  Now, the argument can be made that Christian put the mask on for fear that the press would discover him leaving the club, and his wife might beat his ass up. Again. And, to be sure, the London press has been riding him hard on his visits to the ecdysiasts.  Solid argument, that, except, Slater was  already inside the club . In private, where, ostensibly, no one has a camera, he didn't remove the mask, even when asked, he voluntarily left the club rather than demask. Bouncers are on the lookout for cameras at a strip club -- to protect the dancers and the married men, you know, fairly serious protocol ...  or so they tell me . Ehr. Not that I am expert in this sort of arcana, just so you know.   Anyhoo , I'm not laying down any charges here, I don't want a lawsuit, couldn't handle the lawsuit, really,  but isn't this an odd coincidence ? And was a highly contagious Christian at risk of spreading contagion to the  urlLink ecdysiasts ? When did he know he had chicken pox, that is front and center, people, in chickenpoxgate.   For shame, if he knew  and thought the grim, jowly image of Tricky Dick would provide ju-ju capable of conquering the contagion!  According to the  urlLink Indiana University Health Center Online :  "Chicken pox is contagious through direct contact with the fluid in the blisters and by airborne droplets that are inhaled. Incubation period is 7-21 days. A person is contagious from 1-2 days before the rash appears and until all the lesions form crusts."  Do the strippers at Stringfellows even have health insurance?  And what of  urlLink Slater's "English Rose "? Will she soon be developing  urlLink rose-petal shaped lesions ?  I'm just asking. Someone's got to, you know.

       A Little of the Old In and Out      In: The Romantic Lives of Presidential (and Presidential Candidates') Children.  Yes, yes, yes, we are curious about  Jenna  and  Barbara  and  Chris  and, of course, we have more than a passing fancy in the choices  Those Fabulous Kerry Sisters make , who,  urlLink according to Page Six , are too hot to handle, having moved on from The Affleck -- yesterday's news, over to bigger game, namely, John Cusack,  urlLink the man who won't talk to The Post :  "Both of presidential nominee  John Kerry's  daughters,  Alexandra , 30, and  Vanessa , 27, seem to have the hots for  urlLink John Cusack . After Alexandra was seen sharing cigarettes and some kisses with the actor on a bench outside 15 Beacon in Boston, a jealous Vanessa came out and tried to steal him away. A staffer at the restaurant told  urlLink PAGE SIX  that the blond Vanessa tried to sit between her sister and Cusack and was rebuffed, so she sat on the other side of Cusack and chatted with them for a few minutes. Meanwhile, the reason the party was so packed was that both sisters insisted that 35 guests not on the list be let in."  Why are these girls so free with their kisses and why arent I on the receiving end? Or  urlLink http://www.whatevs.org . Why don't bloggers get respect?  According to  urlLink Rush and Molloy , Vanessa, just a couple of days ago, was seen kissing up on The Affleck, not once, but  twice (The Corsair  crosses himself and fashions a scarlet letter ) , and, mirabile dictu, "he didn't resist."  Oh, John Cusack, resist ...  resist!   My guess if that this is all an elaborate plot to sabotage the insurgent  urlLink Cusack for President  campaign with incriminating photos.   Out :  Nic Cage Weds Sushi Waitress .  urlLink MSNBC reports  :   "Oscar-winning actor  urlLink Nicolas Cage has married for the third time .  The 'Leaving Las Vegas' star wed 20-year-old  Alice Kim  on Friday at a private ceremony on a ranch in Northern California, publicist  Annett Wolf  told The Associated Press.  "It is the third wedding for  urlLink Cage, 40 , who split with his  urlLink previous wife  Lisa Marie Presley   after less than four months in 2002 (Ed Note: Nic almost -- impetuously, like the Aquarius that he is --  urlLink remarried her ). Before that, he was married for six years to actress  Patricia Arquette .  "Kim, a former sushi waitress, met Cage when the actor visited the Los Angeles restaurant where she worked. This is her first marriage."   Hmmm . Three wives; not a solid track record. Odds are he will be  urlLink Gone in 60 Days , back on the road. We hope he gets back to his edgier indie fare. And his  urlLink comic book collection .   In :  Kelly Ripa  is becoming quite the household Hampton's name, of late. The perky milf is gaining mindshare in the tony Hamptons, according to  urlLink Fashionweekdaily , people are talking:  "First off, and what is sure to be talked about for weeks, is the seventh-annual Super Saturday hosted by  Donna Karan ,  Kelly Ripa , and In Style?s  Charla Lawhon , taking place at Nova?s Ark Project in Water Mill. Expected fashion industry guests include Karan herself, Vogue?s  Virginia Smith , Perry Ellis?  Patrick Robinson , Coach?s  Reed Krakoff ,  Lulu Guinness ,  Vera Wang ,  Aerin Lauder , and  Stefani Greenfield ."  Then there's that  urlLink juicy New York Post item :  "The crowd at  urlLink Russell Simmons' Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundation benefit  began ignoring the main fund-raising portion of the evening on Saturday by either talking loudly or refusing to bid.  "'Everybody shut up a little bit and reach into your pockets deep. That's why we're here, to raise some money,' said live auctioneer  urlLink Chevy Chase  upon starting.  "But the chatter went on and the offers continued to flatline and Chase grew increasingly irate. Finally, a fed-up Simmons grabbed one of the microphones onstage, looked into the eyes of the well-heeled crowd and delivered a stinging message:  "'The basis of your life is what you give ? and life gives to the givers and takes from the takers,' he said. 'All of those who have success and can't share are not really rich.'  "Then, waddaya know, the next round of bidding for a 2.5-carat Hello Kitty diamond pendant ? designed by Russell's wife,  Kimora Lee  ? became fierce. The opening bid of $5,000 quickly zipped to $20,000 with the pendant finally secured by  urlLink Mark Consuelos , the husband of host  urlLink Kelly Ripa .  "'Oh, you are going to be rewarded tonight,' Ripa told her hubby."   The Corsair , quite frankly, wonders when  Ripa  has time  urlLink to breathe , to  urlLink digest food , or even to in between  urlLink Reeg ,  urlLink the kids , the husband,  urlLink Hope and Faith , the  urlLink Jimmy Choos , and now, a budding career as  urlLink a Hampton's socialite and party host . We like Ripa, who is as ambitious as she is overwhelmingly cute.   Out :  Nick Carter , lunkhead, ex boy bander.  Paris Hilton  has launched a major -- if covert -- little PR war against  Nick Carter , according to the Post's  urlLink Paula Froelich :  "A bruised and battered  Paris Hilton  is telling pals ex-boyfriend Nick Carter hit her, leaving the ugly marks on her face and arms.  "In photos, Hilton has an obviously swollen lip and bruises up and down both arms.  "She has said the bruising came in Los Angeles Monday evening, after she and Carter joined pal  urlLink  Amanda Demme  at the Argyle Hotel, where Demme throws a weekly party .  "'They were dirty dancing together,' said one Argyle spy. 'They were very lovey-dovey, staring into each other's eyes. We all thought they were back together.'  "But after Hilton and  urlLink the ex-Backstreet Boy  left the Argyle to party at another club, Joseph's, the mood turned sour.  "'Nick wanted to leave, Paris didn't,' said a Hilton pal, adding, 'Nick forced Paris to leave, he made her get in a cab with him.'  "Hilton alleges to friends Carter later lost his temper.  "Friends say Hilton is 'scared to death.'  "The pal added: 'He has major anger-management issues . . . We have seen bruises on her before and asked her about them. She has always denied it ? until now.'"   In :  Chris Heinz , the red hot bachelor and man-about-town, the new  JFK, Jr . According to  urlLink Fashionweekdaily , he is slated to attend the Mercedes-Benz Polo Challenge, week 3, hosted by the Hilton family ( Paris , Darling  Nikki ,  Kathy  and  Rick Hilton  are hosting, pooling their collective well-knowness in an act of strength; we wouldn't suggest you take the opportunity to corner Paris and ask if indeed it is true  urlLink that Nick Carter physically assaulted her  during their stormy on-again, off again relationship). Of all  urlLink the Heinz clan , Chris is the most out there, and, of course, the ladies take notice.   Out :  Mike Tyson.   urlLink The AP sums it up nicely  :    "A comeback born out of financial desperation didn't go past the fourth round Friday night when an unheralded British heavyweight by the name of  urlLink Danny Williams knocked Tyson out  with a savagery that may have once and for all exposed Tyson as a shot fighter."  Of course, Tyson, unlike Ali, likes to "party" while training. Anyhoo, it's time for Tyson to retire from boxing, and approach Viacom Executives about doing a BET Reality Series, called Like Mike, chronicling your life. And cut me in for a taste, as I came up with the idea.  If you are into blood sports,  urlLink this  is the best analysis of how Tyson could get back in the game.   In :  urlLink African Americans generally don't stalk . If you haven't already, check out  urlLink the link , as I've made some additions, and you know how funny a potential stalker situation can be.     Out : I like  Roger Friedman , he's a great gossip columnist, but he made a glaring mistake the other day that  urlLink Fox News hasn't corrected  when giving his report backstage at the Democratic Convention in Boston:  "... One heart-stoppingly strange moment came when former Clinton secretary of state  Janet Reno  attempted to come down the stairs close to where the New York delegation was sitting, only to be met by the ascending Sean 'P. Diddy' Combs, who was wearing his 'Vote or Die' T-shirt, and seemed to be interviewing people for MTV.   "'He probably thought she was  Will Ferrell  in drag,' one onlooker quipped."     Reno  was, of course, the Attorney General of the United States,  Madeline Albright  was at State.     In :  urlLink Stereogum  on  John Water's  new homage to Baltimore, "head injuries and sex-addicts in blue-collar Baltimore."

       Entourages Are the New Black    urlLink The Lil Kim perjury trial involving her entourage  was postponed this week until February, which was bad news for entourages in general, but there are several other mitigating factors that ought to be taken into account when rendering a final verdict on the social merits of that significant cultural artifact, the entourage.   The Corsair  puts on his culturall anthropologist hat, then tips it to the side, at  urlLink a 45 degree-angle , giving it a little " urlLink Fosse ," a little  urlLink Kevin Federline  flavor, if you will.  Frankly,  The Corsair  believes that even the  urlLink exquisitely witty Thorstein Veblen , the patron saint of snarky bloggers, would agree that it is indeed a good time in general to be a celebrity tag along. Why, the excess pussy runoff alone (okay, that does sound kind of gross) makes this a noteworthy career option that "merit un detour."  For one,  urlLink HBO renewed Entourage  for a second season, validating  urlLink their existence .  Second, to be sure, entourages were all over the DNC convention in Boston, like ugly on Congressman  urlLink Tom Delay . Diddy's alone filled 4 golf carts.  The Affleck's  peeps were on DefCon 3, separating the wheat from the chaff.  Chris Heinz's  were busy fending off young women determined to sperate him from his trust fund. But the most symbolic of symbols: Kerry's " urlLink Band of Brothers " -- Can anyone say "entourage"? -- was in full effect, ending the Convention, providing the most glorious of photo ops; yes, the entourage is no longer relegated to the music and movie industry: the entourage has infected our body politic.   P Diddy's  entourage, it has been said,  urlLink rivals Christ's . Although his people are far from saintly, truth be told, and they are  probably  not as loyal as that charismatic Jesus', just ask  urlLink Joyce Wadler of the NY Times , who took an elbow to the chops from an unruly yes-man. But they tend to have a Spaniel-like fidelity to the one who pays the bills, and, as  urlLink The Old Gray Lady says , where the star goes, so does their entourage, and, depending on the drawing power of the star, executives may have to rearrange plans:  " Ocean MacAdams , vice president for news for MTV ... was trying to secure Thursday floor passes for P. Diddy's entourage. Mr. MacAdams admitted that he had offered two concert tickets in exchange for floor passes but was turned down. "  Here's what  urlLink I wrote about entourages  way back in December:  "Entourages are the new black. There a must get, they suggest that people want to be around you, fodder over you,  protect you,  because you are rich and famous and, it logically follows, fabulously interesting. You don't have to say it's all about me when you have an entourage around you --  it is simply taken for granted .  "An entourage implies money -- how else would one be able to keep beefy bodyguards in the Cristal and swordfish and 'the sticky ickey'; how else could one clothe, bejewel and perfume a gaggle of models, pay the cellphone bills of a murder of publicists and 'guys from around the way'?  "The ultimate in entourage chic, as here demonstrated by  urlLink (Charlize) Theron  (2nd Item), is the fact that one's entourage grows,  evolves , as the night progresses, into an unwieldy mass. You meet people and people want to meet you. People change, as 'social philosopher'  urlLink Ritchie Rich  once observed to me at a Pseudo.com show taping: so why can't one's entourage reflect the social evolution that a hipster makes during the course of one boozy evening? Apparently a member of Theron's entourage -- who just kind of got absorbed into her gang during the course of an evening, kicked Brazilian paparazzo Laura Giannoni in the leg at Viscaya Lounge in New York.  "Theron, that hipster, probably doesn't even know who was in the entourage that evening, the  urlLink Page Sixers  wrote:'Giannoni filed a police report at the 13th Precinct. 'They took pictures of my face, but I can't press charges against the guy because I don't know who he is . . . I am distressed, depressed and tired.'"  "Forget the  me  generation, true believers, where's the cachet in that? It's the entourage generation, baby, who loves you? (Points to  The Corsair  entourage) they do."  I couldn't agree more, six months later; except bloggers don't have entourages, we have cyberstalkers. But we're drinking milk.

       Ben Affleck Watch     According to  urlLink The Boston Globe , or, as they call it there there, "the Bahrston Globe," (okay, bot my best stuff, but that's what you get for expecting me to be funny on Friday, procrastinating, with work deadlines looming like Michael Jackson at a puppet show)  The Affleck, The Globe tells us, has special dietary needs:  " Chef Gabriel Frasca  prepared a special dinner for Affleck: rosemary chicken with seasonal roasted vegetables prepared without oil, because Affleck is trying to be healthy, he told the staff."  And, no, Ben Affleck did not say to Frasca, "Now go get me some Cambodian Breast Milk." That simply did not happen, no matter what  Matt Drudge  says.   God bless The Globe , which, quite frankly,  rocked  with it's Convention and party coverage. They really deserve some Pulitzers thrown their way.  According to  urlLink the AP  (2nd story), The Affleck attended the damp  urlLink Chili Peppers concert  sponsored by The Creative Coalition and the Recording Industry Association of America, but " ... Ben Affleck made a heavily escorted escape after the concert was done."  And  urlLink BoiFromTroy, filling in for Wonkette , who is doing th MTV Choose or Lose gig, posted this item on  urlLink The Affleck, Leo and P Diddy . No doubt "world domination" was mentioned, as is wont to happen when two Scorpios (Diddy and Leo) and a Leo (Affleck), sit around hatching plans.  Finally,  urlLink Reliable Sources  notes, "(at )GQ magazine's impossibly crowded party for San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom ... Fire marshals repeatedly threatened to shut down the party, thrown in a restaurant that held only 240, while rained-upon mortals -- assured they were on the guest list -- waited grousing outside as the likes of  Arianna Huffington  were swept inside. Seems hoi polloi had to be patient until the boldfacers within (including political offspring  Kristin  and  Karenna Gore ,  Cate Edwards  and  Andrew Cuomo ) exited and made space. 'I'm terribly, horribly sorry,' a PR rep kept apologizing, 'but a lot of people in there want to talk to Ben Affleck.'"  Damned cheek!  One doesn't simply call him Ben (Averted gaze) . That's "The Affleck," to you, sirrah, or it will be drawn ancient pistols at noon!  And that,  urlLink ladies and gentlemen of the jury , is The Week That Was Affleck.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :   urlLink Elizabeth Jagger  , according to  urlLink British Vogue , which says:  "ELIZABETH JAGGER was spied this week popping into her local Waterstones to pick up a copy of the bright pink and, much to her apparent embarrassment, therefore difficult to disguise book  urlLink The Intimate History Of The Orgasm . Lucky old  Sean Lennon ."  Looks like she inherited more than just  urlLink the lips , no?   Out :   urlLink Damon Dash .  Can he hang?  Doubtful  (Averted gaze ) . According to  urlLink the 3AM Girls , Dash can't score the digits, even with an entourage of man-mountains to give his cred.  urlLink This is the saddest story that I have ever heard :  "Our spy in West End nightspot Aura reveals: 'Damon was in the VIP area with his huge entourage when he spotted a girl he really fancied.  "'He sent one of his flunkies over to approach her on his behalf. He duly obeyed and told the girl that Damon requested the pleasure of her company. She seemed to think it was quite amusing. She looked over at Damon and giggled before politely turning him down.'  "'(The lady's date had) been at the bar buying drinks but had seen what was going on. It's fair to say he was the possessive type,' our on-site mole discloses.  "He went over to one of Damon's man-mountains and started kicking off, saying: 'Don't you f***ing come near my girl.' Club security had to intervene to stop the situation escalating."   Like I said : Dash. Can't. Hang.    Mixed  :  Katie Couric . We can't yet tell if she's in or out these days because there were conflicting reports of the elvin Today Show host at the Convention. According to  urlLink The Boston Globe , Katie got a little nook-nook:  "NBC morning gal  Katie Couric  and Red Sox chairman  Tom Werner  had lunch at Via Matta and were spied yesterday holding hands as they walked to the Public Garden."  Which is cute and all, but then, according to the excellent  urlLink Rush and Molloy , the pendulum swung:  "Katie Couric has made extreme sacrifices for the sake of her craft, but this week at the convention marked a new low: Security officers confiscated the hairspray from her stylist's bag. Never fear - we're sure Couric's perkiness will prevail."  The verdict?  Mixed.    In :  Estates in New Jersey . New Jersey is the new black; no, wait, I already said entourages were, so, like, Estates in Jersey are the new, uhm,  urlLink Mini Motorcycle , yeah, that's it.  urlLink P Diddy just bought one . According to  urlLink Newsday :  "Hip-hop star and entrepreneur  Sean 'P. Diddy' Combs  has purchased a 21-room Bergen County mansion for more than $10 million. Combs bought the 17,000-square-foot home in Alpine from financier  Mark Arzoomanian . The brick colonial home is set on 3.5 acres with a gated, tree-lined driveway that winds to a circular courtyard.  urlLink   "The home has three bedroom suites with sitting rooms, five additional bedrooms with private baths and a six-car garage. It also has an outdoor pool with a waterfall and separate spa; a movie theater; tennis, racquetball and basketball courts; a wine cellar, and a 700-gallon aquarium."  That's still less than half the size of the 35,000 square foot Saddle River, New Jersey mansion of  Russell Simmons . Not that we're counting, or anything: I'm just sayin'.   urlLink New Jersey has a lot to be proud of :  Bon Jovi ,  Whitney ,  Undrinkable Post Apocalyptic Water , Mike  Tyson  ... uhm, scratch  urlLink Tyson , because .... he's ...   Out :  urlLink  Mike Tyson   .  After tearing through $40 million, he's back, he's broke, and here's what he  urlLink has to say for himself :  "'I cannot dwell on the past. Most of my past was not euphoric,' said Tyson during a Wednesday press conference. 'The future seems so much brighter than the past. The layoff between fights has not been fun. I have been miserable with myself. My professional life is going great now, though my personal life stinks (laughing). I do not have anyone. I am alone.'   The Corsair  plays  urlLink "All by Myself" by Eric Carr  on a boombox, and holds it aloft  urlLink like Lloyd Dobler in "Say Anything ."  "'I am very appreciative of the response and reception I have received from Louisville. It is a little embarrassing and humbling,' added Tyson, who claims to be in financial trouble. 'I have trained hard. I did not train for a short fight. I am ready.'"  In:  urlLink Alessandra Ambrosio . According to  urlLink Fashionweekdaily : "Members of the press and passersby alike were in no need of caffeine yesterday morning, thanks to a jolt provided by the scantily-clad Victoria’s Secret model Alessandra Ambrosio. Donning little more than a white miniskirt and fitted tank top with the word 'Pink' written across the front, the model strutted from a white H2 Hummer in sky-high pink stilettos to introduce the company’s new collection of lingerie and sleepwear."   Out : The Gina Lee Swollen Tape,  urlLink according to Lindsayism , "Just a tip - when the guy says 'I'm gonna make MILLIONS' it's probably time to destroy the tape."  Or the girl, Lindsay; somewhere out there, most probably in Southeast Asia, making the rounds, is an incriminating, athletic Corsair smut tape made while he attended a private liberal arts college in Vermont.  They're just waiting for me to become famous so they can release it, to bring a brother down.

       Christian Slater, Unmasked!     Who can blame that fabled celebrity connoisseur of  urlLink ecdysiasts ,  Christian Slater,  for wearing a mask when he dropped in for a spot of Ale at his favorite London strip club,  Stringfellows . Sometimes you wanna go where everybody knows your name.  That  Christian Slater  wears a mask is significant, psychologically revealing, really; as actors tend to have  urlLink a nebulous sense of self  -- who else would choose a  urlLink vocation involving constant protean change , oftentimes three or more serious character studies a year, all this and to live in a land, namely: Tinseltown, filled to the brim with plastic personas who have "people" who will call your "people" about "doing lunch"? ( The Corsair  does an airkiss, followed by an averted gaze, exaggerated cough, and feigned detatchment)  A mask is also useful because, well, Slater's wife has a penchant for  urlLink kicking his ass  when she gets upset when the red-blooded actor strays from his marriage vow. But his choice of masks is almost  urlLink Freudian . According to  urlLink the 3AM Girls :  "Just hours before our spies caught him  urlLink canoodling with a mystery blonde  in London's Nobu, the Hollywood hunk was kicked out of his favourite lap-dancing club, Stringfellows, for refusing to take off his ... mask.  "Bizarrely, we're told the 34-year-old True Romance star was disguised as, ahem, dead US president Richard Nixon."  "A club source tells us: 'Christian has been to  urlLink Stringfellows many times  and has always been one of our favourite customers.  "'He's not keen on being photographed going in or out but he has never resorted to fancy dress before.'"   The Corsair  sips casually from his  urlLink icy pimp goblet , displaying a three quarter profile, shadowed in such a way as to suggest intrigue, by the venetian blinds across the room.  "When the actor, who's currently in rehearsals for a stage production of  urlLink One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest , pitched up wearing the rubber mask last Saturday, he was quizzed by puzzled doormen.  "'He told them he'd been in a few days before and had been spotted when he left.  "'He managed to convince staff that it was him so, as he's such a good customer, they let him in.' But Christian's 'eccentric' behaviour continued inside ..."  Did Slater inadvertently channel the corrupt ex-President, thus drawing bad "ju-ju"?  "'It all got a bit strange because he continued to wear the mask,' says our mole.  "'It was a bit disconcerting for the girls to be dancing for someone who looked like a weirdo. So one of the promoters politely asked him to remove the mask.' But father-of-two Christian was adamant that it was staying on.  "He just wouldn't take it off, so the decision was taken to ask him to leave.  "'Christian was pretty good about it - he didn't kick up a fuss and left straight away - and still the mask remained on.'  " ... Stringfellow's flamboyant owner Peter Stringfellow yesterday confirmed to us: 'Yes, Christian was asked to leave the club because he wouldn't take off his Nixon mask.'"  Why do we think that tonight Stringfellows will be filled to the brim with men wearing Nixon masks looking for lapdances?

       Quentin, Michael Madsen, Syringes, Lots of Ass     From a rather disturbing interview with Michael Madsen in  urlLink Independent Film Quarterly , Issue 7. This throws some light -- of the scarlet variety, frankly -- on the scene in Hollywood, on those who want fame, what they are willing to do for some immortality, and the gatekeepers who dispense with that immortality as they please. Funny and sad all at the same time:   IFQ : Can you talk about the wild times with (Quentin) Tarantino on the set (of Kill Bill: Volume II)?   Michael Madsen : I don't know if we had wild times. We had good times. Quentin likes to laugh a lot. He's a great laugh. Like the night we did the syringe shot in the butt. I'd never seen so many volunteers in my whole life! Every single woman on that set wanted to be the inserted ass. They were lined up and one by one they'd lay down and I'd shoot them in the ass. (It's for the scene where Michael's character shoots Uma's character in the butt before he buries her alive in a coffin) Quentin was like, 'Let me do it. I want to do it!' Now he's putting the syringe in the butt shot. We must have done 20 different women for the butt shot! Everybody wanted to do it. I think that's Quentin's hand in the movie because I had done about six of them, and I was like, I'm going to my trailer. He spent the rest of the night out there injecting! Next. Next. Next. This side. That looks good. He got that from me because the first time we did the scene, I slapped her on the butt, and then I gave her the shot."

       The Lovely Bones     (Ed Note : This post is inspired by a dream I had last night. )  Call me&nbsp; urlLink Geronimo ,&nbsp;most famous of all&nbsp;Apache medicine men, but that is a name the Mexican soldiers gave to me; originally I was called  Goyathlay , or, One Who Yawns. Perhaps they say I yawned because I never slept-- raiding military settlements and neighboring tribes with wild abandon and impunity, after Spanish troops killed my wife, my mother and three young children. Such is the Apache way.   As the American Empire expanded west, stealing the lands of the Native tribes, I led the Apache's to fight for our land as the government pushed us into Hells Forty Acres, or what the Americans called the San Carlos Reservation in eastern Arizona. We exercised the option to flee and fight, raiding settlements and causing Uncle Sam much consternation.   During the late 19th century, it is said that one quarter of the American Army tried to locate my secret base in the Sierra Madre mountains.&nbsp; Once captured by the honorable General George Crook, I thought that I had honored my ancestors, and my bones would indeed find rest&nbsp;after a life of battle well fought for my Apache bretheren. Alas that was not to be.   Ultimately, after fighting the good fight,  urlLink I died of pneumonia  on February 17, 1909. That should have been the end of things. That should have been the end of things. But it wasn't.    urlLink Prescott Bush , father of the first President Bush and the grandfather of the current President, stole my  urlLink bones , just as the American government took away from me freedom in the final years of my life. This is a crime, this captivity of my bones, which has led me to  urlLink roam unburied , unable to enter the happy hunting ground.    urlLink Prescott Bush stole my bones  from Fort Sill, Oklahoma, for the pleasure of his secret society  urlLink Skull and Bones .  urlLink I wish  to be buried in the Triplet Mountains, but the frat boys at Skull and Bones, the gatekeepers of power, will not let me, an old Apache chief, achieve his final reward. They dug up my body in 1918. My body is at the Skull and Bones Museum. The Skull and Bones Society admitted that it held my remains as early as 1986. The palefaces hold my remains in a glass cage. The Skull and Bones Society log book records the 1918 grave robbery. According to the Skull and Bones log book entry, Prescott Bush, grandfather of George W. Bush, and five other officers at Fort Sill, Okla.,  urlLink desecrated my grave .   I ask the current  President Bush  (S&B, '68) or even  John Kerry  (S&amp;B, '66) or even the first president Bush (S&B, '48) to atone for the sins of your grandfather. Please give my bones back to the Apache people, so that I can be buried on Apache land. I was born on the prairies where the wind blew free and there was nothing to&nbsp;obstruct the light of our common father, the sun. I was born where there were no enclosures. And now I am  urlLink trapped in these stone walls .   Let this part of our history be closed.

       A Little of the Old In and Out     &nbsp;   In: Tina Brown.  According to  urlLink The Boston Globe &nbsp;(link via  urlLink Gawker ), Tina ( urlLink Lady Evans , if you're nasty) has&nbsp;conquered  urlLink that fabled, gilded&nbsp;city :   "Calling  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  'extraordinary,' CNBC's  Tina Brown , former editor of  Vanity Fair ,  Talk , and  The New Yorker  magazines, hosted a lunch in her honor at  Radius  yesterday that proved to be one of the most popular gatherings of the week. Clinton covered several topics in her remarks including  urlLink national security , saying the public cannot yet be assured that 'We've done all we can do' to protect against terrorism. And on the Bush administration's posture toward funding local police and fire departments: 'What they're giving with one hand, they're taking away with the other.' Spotted at the lunch were   urlLink Larry David   of 'Curb Your Enthusiasm';   urlLink Kevin Bacon   and wife   urlLink Kyra Sedgwick  ; former US senator and Democratic presidential candidate  Carol Moseley-Braun ; the chief executive of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia,  Sharon Patrick ; deposed California governor  Gray Davis ; filmmaker  Michael Moore ; NBC chairman  Bob Wright ; and  George McGovern , the former presidential candidate who can at least claim Massachusetts voted for him in 1972."    Ladies and gentlemen of the media ,  Tina Brown  has got her groove back.    Out :  Ben Affleck .  The Corsair  is sick and tired of pulling the  Ben Affleck Watch  duty, but,&nbsp;I suppose, someone has to, as he is of passing interest. But aren't we all just a tad " Afflecked"(TM) ? I mean,  urlLink The man is EVERYWHERE .&nbsp;   According to the  urlLink Times Recorder , "Ben Affleck will be with  Sen. John Kerry  and   urlLink Sen. John Edwards   when they stop in Zanesville for a rally Saturday night." And yesterday,  urlLink The Hollywood Reporter reported  that, " Rebecca Romijn-Stamos  is in talks to co-star with  Ben Affleck  in   urlLink Man About Town . "&nbsp; Affleck, Affleck,  blah-blah-blah .   Even Affleck&nbsp;appears to be as sick of his own ubiquity as everyone else, telling the always excellent  urlLink Rush and Molloy  at GQ editor  Jim Nelson's  party Tuesday night at Boston's Federalist restaurant ( The Corsair  comes up for air), "'It's too much ... Who wants that? If I saw me, I would turn the other way. I'm trying to diminish it so that someone might actually be interested in dating me."   Oh, look, readers, there he is,&nbsp;at the Fleet Arena, getting kissed by&nbsp;that "Nordic milkman's daughter, with her flaxen hair," Vanessa Kerry, apparently, &nbsp;kissed him "twice in a box at the convention Monday night and 'he didn't resist,' a witness tells ( urlLink Rush and Molloy )." We might have offered some faint resistance, Affleck, if only as a show of virtue. But  the Nordic milkman's daughter takes , plundering booty like it was  urlLink The Dark Ages . Affleck booty, to be sure, but booty nonetheless.    urlLink Christy Lemire of the San Diego Union Tribune  sums up our feelings,&nbsp;somewhat confliucted,&nbsp;of being, essentially,&nbsp;A fflecked :   "Here&nbsp;(Affleck) is making surprise breakfast visits to star-struck delegates from Arizona and Iowa, Missouri and his home state of Massachusetts. There he is joking with Boston Globe sports columnist and author  Dan Shaughnessy  on his way out the door of a 'Rock the Vote' party behind Fenway Park's fabled Green Monster. (And he was inside the park, too, watching his beloved Red Sox defeat the dreaded New York Yankees, 9-6, during a nationally televised game Sunday night.)   "Then there are the interviews on CNN's 'Larry King Live,' NBC's 'Today' show and Fox News Channel's 'The O'Reilly Factor.' He's even playing the role of interviewer himself for ABC News, asking Massachusetts  Sen. Edward Kennedy  questions about Boston and his longtime friendship with Kerry.   "But the star of the blockbusters 'Pearl Harbor' and 'Armageddon' and the bombs 'Gigli' and 'Jersey Girl' says he simply recognizes the power of his celebrity and wants to use it to help John Kerry get elected to the presidency. "    In: Marlon Brando.  In this week's  urlLink Time Out New York , filmmaker  Gordon Parks  says:   "Marlon was quite a character. I was in Hollywood going up to see him when on the radio they announced that Martin Luther King had been shot and killed. When I got to Marlon's, he was stretched out on the bed, Brando-style, and I told him that King had been killed. He said, 'King killed?!?' He called the Panther headquarters in California and told his maid to call his gunsmith and order 12 shotguns and 12 rifles and 10 pistols. But then he went back to bed and went to sleep, and so I told the maid not to order those guns. She said, 'I wasn't going to.'"   According to  urlLink Ananova ,  Jack Nicholson , who penned Brando's Obit in  Rolling Stone , said of the Master:   "'This man was a true sensation.'   "(Nicholson) explains (in the Obit) how sneaking in to watch his idol on the set of Teahouse of the August Moon in 1956 was quite a problem.   "'On that picture, the crew had these smocks and kimonos to identify them, so it took me a little work to sneak in there and watch him.   "But nothing could have stopped me from watching Marlon Brando up close.   Apparently Nicholson has little patience for the Brando weight-watching crowd:   "... What Mr Brando does for a living ain't done by the pound."   You can say that again.    Out :  Clint Eastwood . Brother can't hang, according to legendary "burlesque dancer"  urlLink Cece Walker , in the pages of something called  urlLink Bizarre Magazine . And it goes a little something like this:    Cece :  Clint Eastwood  -- can you believe I left him?    Bizarre : At least you can say you dumped Clint.    Cece : My mother has never forgiven me .. we were together between 1966 and 1968, but he was suck a busy man and he wanted to make money. He kept saying, 'When I'm 70 years old I wanna be able to kick back and I wanna be able to direct and I wanna be able to do this and that ...' I was like, 'And in the meantime can you finish screwing me?' He'd be so tired. My ego couldn't stand it, I don't care who you are, if someone's falling asleep when I'm on top, riding them like a cowboy ... that's not right."    Thanks for sharing , ceece, really. On the subject of who are the best burlesque dancers right now, the outspoken Cece said, "For me,  Dita Von Teese  and  Catherine D'Lish  are probably the closest you'll get to the real thing."   Another interesting Clint Eastwood factoid: When he was dating actress  urlLink Sandra Locke &nbsp;(2nd from left), he had her call him "Daddy."&nbsp; Ewwww.&nbsp;    In :&nbsp; Lads, the book, by&nbsp;&nbsp;Dave Itzkoff.  According to  urlLink Fashionweekdaily :   "Move over  Toby Young : a new media memoirist is set to debut in September with a scathing book that?s sure to embarrass some major players&nbsp;almost as much as Young did Graydon Carter. 'Lads,' by Spin magazine editor,  Dave Itzkoff , is sub-headed 'A Memoir of Manhood' and is a recounting of Itzkoff?s days toiling at  Details  and  Maxim . While former Details editor,  Mark Golin  and Maxim?s  Mike Soutar  don?t get very flattering portrayals, it?s former Maxim staffers  Keith Blanchard , who went on to edit  Rolling Stone , and  James Kaminsky , who went on to head up  Playboy , that come out looking&nbsp;the worst. There's also the requisite&nbsp;gratuitous slap at tabloid queen  Bonnie Fuller , with whom Itzkoff?whose nickname is 'Bitchkoff'?once interviewed at  Glamour .&nbsp;&nbsp;'Her&nbsp;&nbsp;(manhood) was bigger than mine,'&nbsp;the lad notes. The book?s being published by Villard."   Damn, another week, another suckerpunch to the liver delivered with lovingkindness from the media to Canada's gift to the US, Bonnie Fuller.  Pow!     Out :  urlLink Claudia Schiffer . According to  urlLink British Vogue :   "ONLY the best for  Claudia Schiffer . The German supermodel, who is expecting her second child in November, pays&nbsp;($218) every two weeks to have her&nbsp;($127,000) Range Rover thoroughly cleaned, inside and out. The Evening Standard revealed last night that Schiffer, who is thought to be worth in the region of&nbsp;($72 million), pays Lellers Car Valet Service twice monthly to steam-clean the engine, treat the windows to 'restore optical quality', clean and soften the interior leather upholstery with a glycerine-based cleaner, vacuum and shampoo carpets and upholstery, repair scratches to the paintwork and remove tar, buff chrome fixtures, paint the tires black and use an air freshener."

Ready? Hold on to your keyboards, true believers: That significant cultural artifact,  urlLink The National Enquirer , has taken up the cultural debate with high solemnity:   "'I think Bill Cosby is saying something he perfectly believes,'  Niger Innis , national spokesman for the Congress of Racial Equality, told The ENQUIRER. 'These are legitimate critiques and criticisms that I'm sure he's experienced from examining black culture.   "'I don't consider his remarks racially insensitive at all.'"&nbsp;   I kid you not, The National Enquirer has taken on this cultural debate. I repeat: This is not a&nbsp; urlLink Fellini&nbsp;film .

The birthday soiree will be held at  Prince Rainier 's  urlLink La Vigie , one of the most prestigious villas on the Riviera.

       Piper Versus Snuka: I Thought That Looked Real     &nbsp;  From  urlLink In the Pit with Roddy Piper, by Roddy Piper :   "I remember one time when we were in  urlLink Allentown, Pennsylvania , and  urlLink Chief Jay Strongbow  was in to tape a segment with me. I always looked forward to working with the Chief. He was a very smart man who was always full of great ideas when it came to our business ... on this particular day he asked me if I had ever picked up a coconut and knew how heavy they were. When I told him no, he went on to tell me that he thought it would make a great prop on (Piper's Pit). As soon as he said this, another wrestler,  urlLink Jimmy "SuperFly" Snuka , came to mind.   I always used to get on Jimmy's case about being Polynesian ... while that sounds rather heavy and personal, I knew what I could get away with when it came to Snuka. That was the "craft" of the interview. When I mentioned this to Chief Jay, without question, he told me that I should hit the Polynesian guy on the head with the coconut. I forgot about it until about an hour later, when the Chief had someone go to the supermarket and buy some bananas and coconuts. The Chief was really hell-bent on seeing me doing some noggin knocking on Snuka that day. So, with fruit in hand, Strongbow came to find me so we could talk about what should happen on the segment.   "As we were talking I picked up one of the coconuts and realized just how heavy it really was. I thought to myself, 'Wow, this could really hurt,' but then I also realized how great the interview could be if I whopped him on the head with this hard piece of tropical fruit.   "About half an hour later Jimmy came out onto 'Piper's Pit.' Whenever he was on he didn't have to say anything, he just had to look at you with his eerie stare to make good TV. SuperFly was one of those very scary individuals who didn't have to utter a word to be intimidating. I remember starting the interview, but I wasn't doing such a great job because all I was doing was thinking about how heavy and hard this fucking coconut really was and that I had to hit him with all my might so that it would break on his head.   "Well, here came the moment of truth, and I hit Jimmy Snuka as hard as I could, and  urlLink that coconut burst like a bomb ! The instant it hit I heard Jimmy give a moan that came from the depths of his soul, and he started falling back and tried to take the set with him. I'm not positive, but I am pretty sure he was unconscious upon impact. When he was on the ground, I started whipping him with the belt that went around my kilt. When he came to he crawled on his hands and knees and then he finally got up. The Polynesian grappler immediately went bananas and came after me, but I slipped into the locker room, shut the door, and locked it. On TV all you saw Jimmy doing was hitting this big industrial door, then they took him away and escorted him to the other dressing room. I was told that Jimmy just stared at the floor for about ten minutes and didn't move. They say to this day that Jimmy Snuka feels the repercussions of that coconut hit."   &nbsp;

       The Zeta Jones Stalker     African-Americans generally don't stalk. It's not what we do. Too much planning involved. We are a spontaneous, improvisational people, taking life as it comes along, and having to stalk an ex-lover or a star is just too goddam  complicated . We like Prince, but I'll be damned if I'm going to follow them around the country. We can't be bothered. We're easy like Sunday morning.  So, imagine my surprise to learn that  Catherine Zeta Jones'  stalker, one  Dawnette Knight,  threatened the Welsh Academy-Award winning actress, claiming she would "'slice her up like meat on a bone."  Gee, does that mean that Catherine is  urlLink the gristle ?  Ahem . Sorry. Bad taste. Stalking is no laughing matter, especially when a crazy person is threatening to make Welsh rabbit out of one of our national treasures. And, before she gets all  urlLink Julia Child with the ginsu , just why -- I ask -- is Zeta Jones worthy of such ire?   urlLink David K Li of the NY Post  gets to the, uhm, marrow of it:  "Testifying in a preliminary hearing against  Dawnette Knight , whom police said mailed violent death threats, Zeta-Jones remained composed even when instructed by the prosecutor to read the letters into the record.  "'We will kill Catherine Zeta-Jones soon!' read one letter, dated Feb. 11, that Zeta-Jones recited. "The 35-year-old Welsh actress likened the letters to terrorism."  But how can she be a terrorist when she's not even  urlLink the bomb ? (drum roll)  "'This has affected my whole family, my 87-year- old father-in-law, my children, my nannies, my staff,' she said. 'It will affect me for the rest of my life.'"  As usual, Mrs. Zeta is playing The Contessa, a role to which she is distinctly ill suited to play, despite the Oscar on her mantle. The fucking nannies --  plural ?! What the fuck, Zeta, what-the- fuck .  If you will remember, true believer,  urlLink Zeta made the preposterous claim  that  urlLink Hello! Magazine  caused "stress, loss of income and damage to their professional careers because of the poor quality wedding photos." In typical Hollywood-surreal fashion, with roccoco excess, the Douglases sued for $3.6 million. And  won . Livin' la Vida Loca.  "(Zeta Jones) read parts of all 22 letters. The note to (Barbara) Walters was the most graphic:  "'When we finish with this bitch/whore, she will not be this pretty face actress. You won't be able to recognize her in her cassket! [sic]'"  Well, whatever one can say about Dawnette, she is an  inventive  speller, no? And in the end, isn't it all about how imaginatively you played this game of Life? .... no? No, I suppose not. And what's up with sending a letter to  Babs Walters ? Like what is Barbara Walters going to do about it, do a View segment on pretty faced actresses who marry up socially? I mean isn't that  urlLink the thrice married Barbara Walter's modus operandi  to a tee? She  invented  that game, honey (1st Husband:  Robert Henry Katz , business executive; marriage annulled; 2nd Husband:  Lee Guber , theatrical producer; married December 8, 1963; divorced 1976; 3rd Husband:  Merv Adelson , CEO of Lorimar Television; married 1986; divorced 1992) Barbara Walters is O.G. in that game.  "Another letter was disguised as a simulated funeral program.  "'The bitch never did a good deed,' it said. 'Thanks for nothing, you Welsh bitch . . .  urlLink whore gold-digger .'" (link via  urlLink TMFTML )   Aww . Why'd she have to bring up the Welsh? Don't be that way, Dawnette. Welsh is good people.  "Another letter added, 'She will be dead before she'll be able to blink an eye. Michael can finally be happy with his kids when the bitch is dead.'"  Inside, outside ... livin' la vida loca ....  "One letter, dated Oct. 2, 2003, mailed to Kirk Douglas, read:  "'You need to let Catherine know that if she hurts Michael, I will hire people to kill her whore ass. If she loves life, [tell her to] treat Mike right.'"  Livin La vida loca ...

       Kimora, Interrupted &nbsp;   On the footsteps of the most recent high profile cases&nbsp;involving the&nbsp;Belgian beauty  urlLink Ingrid Parewijk busted at JFK with&nbsp; --ahem -- " urlLink Bolivian Marching   urlLink Powder ",  urlLink Rush and Molloy  inform us now, mirabile dictu,&nbsp;that our favorite whipping post-- that would be  Kimora Lee Simmons ,  urlLink that fly bitch &nbsp;-- was arrested for possession of -- how does one put&nbsp;this gently so as not to offend? -- she was arrested for possession of " the stickey ickey ":   "Kimora, the fashion powerhouse whose gorgeous nude form can be seen on a Times Square billboard for her Baby Phat line, was handcuffed and booked Sunday night by cops in Saddle River, N.J., where the couple lives."   Well, she is sort of built like a brick house .&nbsp; Her ickey must be the stickiest, considering that she's worth untold millions, no?    &nbsp;   The Corsair  grabs some unsalted popcorn and his&nbsp; urlLink icy pimp goblet  and moves closer to the screen, contemplating Kimora's nude form, dry heaving, then mouthing the words, solemnly, as if to some ancient God, "It's  on  ...".&nbsp;   "According to Saddle River Police Lt.  Robert Breese , she was charged with eluding a police officer, possessing marijuana (under 50 grams), careless driving, operating a vehicle while possessing a controlled substance, tail-gating and having a taillight out."    The Corsair  could have told you that&nbsp;Kimora's lights are out, he could have demonstrated it mathematically&nbsp;for you free of charge on a flow chart&nbsp;with a PowerPoint presentation.&nbsp;  The Corsair &nbsp;has chronicled Her Dimness for quite some time now, and is rather an expert on the subject. As to her "tail,"  The Corsair&nbsp; would rather not touch on matters concerning her booty.&nbsp;   "The 29-year-old trendsetter, who was fingerprinted and posed for a mug shot, 'made no attempt to stop' when officers demanded she pull over, Breese said. 'They arrived in front of her residence, where she was finally confronted.' "    Oh dear&nbsp;sweet Lord , could someone email me that mug shot and those fingerprints at  urlLink papermag@yahoo.com .&nbsp;   "Russell Simmons said, 'My wife is an excellent driver, and she's not guilty of any crime. You don't have to grab my wife and put handcuffs on her. Her wrists are all bruised up.'   "The Def Jam founder, whose fortune has been estimated at over $1 billion, said: 'I may be the biggest taxpayer in Bergen County, but I'm not looking for anything special. I just want to be treated fairly.'"    Translation : Next time, civil servant,&nbsp;make sure you use the "iciest" cuffs, with only the most ghetto fabulous sable lining on my precious, she who pays your (averted gaze) little salary. Let them eat vegetarian cakes and drink my power drink.

       A Little of the Old In and Out     In :  The Mediterranean,  baby .  The jet set have always frequented the Mediterranean, but this year it appears to have extra-special cachet among the celebrity class.  urlLink Yesterday's Page Six  reported that Lionel Ritchie is in Sardinia, and:   "THE St.-Tropez social season kicked into high gear on Saturday when Sean ("P.

His guests included  Denzel  and  Pauletta Washington  (who have chartered  urlLink Greg Norman's  yacht, Aussie Rules),  Ivana Trump  and  Rossano Rubicondi  (she owns a small villa in the Riviera resort),  P.M.'s Unik , and Food Network star  Sandra Lee , who graced the cover of last week's TV Guide. Staying with Combs aboard his own chartered yacht are Lee and her husband, L.A. builder  Bruce Karatz ; billionaire supermarket mogul  Ron Burkle ,  Bill Clinton's  buddy who is said to be an investor in the Sean John clothing company; and Combs' sons, Justin and Christian; and Christian's mother  Kim Porter ."   And, according to  urlLink Hello!

       The Beasty Boys Mercilessly Tease Russell Simmons     &nbsp;  In the  urlLink August 2004 Interview Magazine , the new "urban"  Tom Cruise  (whom, incidentally,&nbsp;we like) interviews  Jada Pinkett-Smith , of all people, saying things like, oh, "that's my girl," and, "I don't know what a Virgo is, man."  Very street , this new Tom; he's put aside his ego and showing us a more vulnerable Tom, which is cool. But, by far,&nbsp;the most interesting interview is the one between  Russell Simmons  and his old label mates,  the Beasty Boys , who, arguably, made Def Jam, along with  LL Cool J,  back in the day.   The interview in Interview begins&nbsp;with a friendly&nbsp;banter, mixed with a game of " urlLink the dozens ," circa 1984, but then, when Beasty Boy MCA strikes out at Russell's weak spot -- his vanity for clothing -- things get ...  tender.    Actually, things go horribly awry. The Beasties can't stop busting. Simmons has many,  many  vanities, but when you bust on his clothes, I've noticed, he turns into a  real pussy boy . The conversation begins harmlessly, as Russell brings up his favorite material possession and favored status item, namely,&nbsp; kids :    Russell Simmons : So how about the fact that  urlLink we're  all getting old? How many kids you got Adrock?    Adrock : I don't have any kids.    Mike D : I have kids. I got one that's 20 months old and another one on the way (both by his wife, director  urlLink Tamra Davis )    Russell Simmons : Really? You aint even got a woman, though, do you  MCA ?    MCA : Why you gotta be like that, Russell?    RS : I'm just saying, do you have one?    MCA : Don't even start ...    RS : I don't see y'all. I just want to know.    MD : C'mon Russell, the man's a father.    RS : Oh, he's got a kid! (laughs) So, how old is your kid, MCA?    MCA : I have a daughter (with wife  Dechan Dangdu ). She's gonna be 6.    RS : Six. That's old enough to date.    MCA : See, why you gotta be like that?    RS : What? I aint gonna date your daughter.    MCA : So, who made those clothes, Russell? (Simmons is wearing a bright pink shirt, pink pants, and a pink baseball cap)    RS : You don't like my clothes? Does my shirt not match?    MCA : It's scary how well they match.    RS : Well, I got a pink seersucker suit, a pink silk suit, and a pink corduroy suit.    MCA : You got a pink hummer?    RS : Pink is a big color this season! Just like lavender will be next year. For Phat Farm, we have projections about&nbsp; what the next big color will be, and sometimes we add our own.    Adrock : You have heat seekers who hang out at 7 Eleven and tell you what the kids are up to?    MCA : Here's an inside tip: the people on the street are talking about beige&nbsp;    The Corsair  softly chuckles, then sips Cutty Sark&nbsp;from his pimp goblet, whispering to himself, "It's on like Gray Poupon."   Russell quickly changes the subject, but, like a pit bull,  Adrock  goes right after Simmons' weak spot -- clothes, with a grim tenacity, and the rest of the Beasties gang pile on.    RS : You're a practicing Buddhist, Adam -- do you meditate ( MCA  nods yes) What about you Adrock? What are you?    Adrock : I'm a New Yorker, Russell. So, we don't get any free Phat Farm clothes?    RS : Y'all don't want no clothes man. Y'all wear smallboy shit. (points to Mike D) look at his shoes. Maybe we make some sneakers that you would wear.    Adrock : Yeah, I'm hip with the kids.    MD : Why don't you get us some suits? Adam (Adrock) wants his in pink, though.    RS : Pink is over.   (The phone rings. Simmons picks up)    Speakerphone : Russell, you need to wrap it up. The kids are here.    RS : The kids are here! Tell the kids to come in right now.    MCA : What kids?    RS : From Junior Achievement.    Adrock : I wish we had those suits. We could have worn them.   The corsair is three-fifths sure that Russell's happiness at the arrival of the Junior Achievement kids has more to do with their saving his clothes line Phat Farm from further humiliation at the hands of the merciless Beasty Boys than anything else.     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;

       Adrien Brody: "I would love to brag, but I can't incriminate myself"    That crazy jet set: too much money, too much ennui. From the urlLink &nbsp; August 2004 Details :   "A few weeks before (this interview), in a brief period where ( Adrien Brody ) was not under contract (after filming  The Jacket  with  Kiera Knightley  and before starting  King Kong  with  Naomi Watts ), he took part in what he calls a major, major, major mission --  urlLink the Gumball 3000 , an annual six-day road rally, which this year ran from  urlLink Paris to Madrid to Marbella to Casablanca to Barcelona to Cannes .   "The field of 330 entrants included 60 Ferrari's; nine members of the Saudi Royal family; the skateboarder  Tony Hawk ; a Citroen 2CV painted like the  urlLink General Lee ; a contingent from the Asian equivalent of Jackass, driving a Winnebago equipped with a Jacuzzi filled with Cup O Noodle soup; and a London Taxi whose meter recorded ($16,553) fare by the finish line. Officially the Gumball 3000 is not a race, but the King of  urlLink Morocco , who entered participants at his palace when the rally arrived on his shores, graciously announced that during their stay he  urlLink would suspend all speed limits . The aftereffects of such unusual driving license were felt the next day, when Spanish policia enforced the law of their land by levying more than 50,000 euros in fines and tickets.   " urlLink Brody started the Gumball poorly , getting lost in  urlLink his loaner Porsche 911 turbo  and arrived in Madrid 14 and a half hours behind everyone else. But on the last day, he left Barcelona in the middle of the night to avoid the Spanish authorities and crossed the finish line five hours before anyone else, a circumstance that caused uninitiated journalists to report that he had won the race.

       A Little of the Old In and Out     In :  A Positive Democratic Convention . As always,  urlLink Dick Morris has some wise thoughts  on the Democrat convention (and, quite possibly,  urlLink some acute positions for the hookers  in Boston):   "The enraged left has to see this weeks gathering in Boston as its opportunity to respond to Bushs pre-emotion of the national stage in the wake of Sept. 11. At last, its paranoid suspicions and reasonable doubts alike can be aired before a national prime-time audience. No longer confined to venues like Michael Moore movies, Democratic orators can give their version of recent history and attack what they see as the seminal mistakes of the Bush response to terror.   "So the impetus for a negative convention will be strong and widely felt. Like water that has accumulated behind a dam, Bushs partisan opponents will want to lash out and bring the president down.   "But this blood lust can only destroy Kerrys chances of making this convention the springboard he needs. Negatives dont work at conventions. The most negative in recent memory was the 1992 Republican conclave where  urlLink speaker after speaker thrashed both Clintons  usually aiming at the wrong one and failed to produce any gain for their candidate as he sought re-election."    Out : Poor  Dennis "The Kooce" Kucinich .  The Corsair  hears that the Kerry Camp offered nothing for his delegates, not even a return trip to Mars, where, ostensibly The Kooce lives ( urlLink Department of Peace ? Get real, monkey waif-boy);  urlLink the AP says :   "Kucinich, who formally endorsed presumed nominee John Kerry last week, met with his roughly 64 delegates twice this week, with many saying they would still cast a vote for the four-term Ohio congressman at the roll call Wednesday night, according to an e-mail Tuesday from his campaign.   "'I'm releasing you to vote your consciences. You will be the ones making your own decision,' Kucinich said. "   Later, Kucey.    In :   urlLink Open Water  . When does&nbsp; urlLink this flick &nbsp;open? I've got the fever for the flavor of this&nbsp;film. Can someone in the film's PR department hook me up with some screening passes? Hook me up with a taste, baby pop. I am so fucking&nbsp;down to see this&nbsp;independent sleeper.  urlLink AFlyonthewall  breaks&nbsp;it down:   " urlLink The flick  has a simple but chilling concept: husband-and-wife scuba divers are accidentally stranded in shark-infested open water. And it's based on a true story.   "The movie was made for something like $400,000, but it far outshines conventional Hollywood thrillers with $40 million budgets. (And, yes, it has real sharks.) The pic has played at several film festivals, including Sundance, to standing-room-only audiences. The film succeeds because of a fantastic, tightly crafted script, shrewd directing, and phenomenal performances by two relatively unknown actors. The female lead,  urlLink Blanchard Ryan , is a particular standout. She has the intensity of Sigourney Weaver combined with the stunning looks of a young Michelle Pfeiffer. I can't wait to see more of her work.   "Written and directed by  urlLink Chris Kentis , the movie opens in limited release August 6 and goes wider on August 20."&nbsp;    Out :  Bonnie Fuller . According to  urlLink WWD &nbsp;(link via  urlLink Romenesko ):   "Consider it the next step in Bonnie Fullers evolution from celebrity journalist to just plain celebrity. A Canadian television crew recently descended on American Medias Park Avenue offices to shoot a documentary about the love-her-or-loathe-her editor of Star. The show, which will air in late fall or early winter, is part of the CBC series 'Life and Times,' which profiles prominent Canadians, including past subjects  Wayne Gretzky ,  Joni Mitchell  and former Prime Minister  Jean Chrétien . Renowned as Fuller may be in Manhattan media circles, one has to wonder: Does the average Canadian have any idea who she is? "   Ah, to be mentioned in the same breath as  Jean Chrétien ; that, as Canadian superstar  Graydon Carter  might say, leaving a trail of  Winston Light  smoke in his wake, is so very  urlLink First Room . But somewhere in Manitoba -- and you know this to be true, true believer&nbsp;-- a big boned&nbsp;employee at a local fishery is kissing his well-worn  Bonnie Fuller  poster full on the lips,&nbsp;before leaving&nbsp;for a long, hard&nbsp;day of processing halibut.    In :  Late in Life Circumcisions.  Seriously folks, I like to eat fruit salad, creme and granola&nbsp;for breakfast in the summer. It is cool, it is light, it is filled with vitamins; as the kids say:  it's all good . But as I was reading this story in  urlLink Page Six , I was dry heaving cantelope. Violently:   "MORE on Marlon Brando's circumcision at age 60, which we reported on last week. 'It's 100 percent true,' a reader e-mailed us. 'My mother worked in surgery at St. John's Hospital at the time and was there for it.' St. John's in Santa Monica was the hospital to the stars for decades until it was eclipsed by Cedars Sinai. 'My mother worked there for 40 years, and boy, did she have some scary stories to tell about the terrible acne scars on Richard Burton's back!!' As for Brando? Our correspondent denies the star converted to Judaism it is inconceivable he could have learned Hebrew since he had so much trouble remembering his lines in English. Our tipster divulges: 'It seems the surgery was necessary for medical reasons an infected gunky mess.'"   I still have that woozy feeling&nbsp;like my legs might buckle under me at any moment, and I am&nbsp;at the mercy of&nbsp;careening waves of  urlLink &nbsp;Sartrean nausea .    Out :  Marc Jacobs!  Why that saucy little bigot! According to  urlLink British Vogue , you  won't believe  what he said:   "SEEMS that a political calling is the latest must-have for the most cutting edge designers. Last week  Sean Combs  launched his  Citizen Change  campaign and, this week,  Marc Jacobs  has filled his Bleecker Street Marc boutique window with  urlLink knickers &nbsp;..."    urlLink Knickers ?! What the fuck?! This is  2004 , people, there is no need to be racist!&nbsp; You can't put black people in your window. We are not for sale! They continue:   "'We work in a creative industry, and we're being creative about it. There is sign language on some of the pieces and actually a lot of people came in to say thank you.'  urlLink Knickers  are selling for $15, while Ts are $25 and sweatshirt hoodies are $35.&nbsp;"   What the fuck?! $15!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Altogether  people: we shall overcome ...  &nbsp;   In:  My old  urlLink Paper Magazine  pal  urlLink Carlo McCormick , easily one of the most interesting long haired New York writer-characters, has his ear to the street (Carlo's definitive essay on the subject of  urlLink scratchitti  in BlackBook several years ago deserved, I thought,&nbsp;an instant&nbsp;MacArthur Genius Grant), does the profile on that phantom urban menace,  urlLink NeckFace :   "On the streets of Manhattan and Brooklyn,  urlLink NeckFace throws up fast  and gets away quickly, like a hit and run shadow. But the New Image show has allowed him to branch out betond lightening fast tagging. 'I have more time to do it in the gallery now,' NeckFace explains. 'It's crazy stuff like I've never seen before. You've seen what I can do on the streets; just imagine what I can do with time on my hands.'"    Ed Note :  Stereogum &nbsp;has been charting the slow and steady&nbsp;rise of another urban blight/phantom menace ...  urlLink Bob Saget has a posse .    &nbsp;   Out :   urlLink Linda Stassi got slipped a Mickey Finn  . I've always been for hidden overhead cameras in bars and lounges. It sucks that our privacy has got to be compromised, the 'getting of our freak on' may be hampered by recording devices, but there are just too many fucking assholes putting drugs into people's drinks in New York after hours. Too many. And no one is getting caught. If the Villard Bar in the Helmsley Palace Hotel had had a camera, the creep who drugged Linda Stassi would be behind bars, getting punked out by a large convict at Rikers, instead of out on the&nbsp;prowl&nbsp; urlLink mickey finning &nbsp;other women, perhaps even as I write this. Says Linda:   "I don't remember going to the emergency room, but I do remember being hooked up to the IV and then passing out. They said my alcohol level was low but that I had all the classic symptoms of a drugging or poisoning.   "I'm still having horrible nightmares. I missed too much work in the first few weeks after the drugging, and when I did show up, I had to leave early. The dizziness kept recurring. And the headaches.   "That mickey I was slipped stole a month of my life, and I'm not happy. I'm told that I'm lucky the perp didn't steal more. Like my bag. Like my clothes. Like my life. I'd be happy just to get the month back."    In :  urlLink Fashionweekdaily chronicles  the opening of The Village, where boldfaces  Tina Fey  frolickled with the likes of  Regis Philbin ,  Sigorney Weaver &nbsp;and  Simon Rex  in, of all places, Prospect Park:   " Adrien Brody  and director film director  M. Night Shyamalan  wore  Ermenegildo Zenga  to the premiere of 'The Village' last night in Prospect Park, Brooklyn. The film is a chilling tale of a remote village confronting the stupefying truth that lies just outside its borders. Night, who is known for his distinctive artistry as well as for bucking mainstream Hollywood, selected a look from the not-yet-available spring 2005 Z Zegna collection, ensuring an independent look for the evening. He arrived on the red carpet wearing a black jacquard slim-fitting suit with a crisp, white open collar shirt from new and fashion-forward Z Zegna. Brody also appeared in Zegna in a précis black suit and gray button-down, choosing to top off his look with a red silk tie ? a nod to Night?s use of the color in his film as the symbol of evil.&nbsp; In fact, the outdoor premiere scrapped the traditional (and evil) red carpet in favor of a yellow one. 'The Village' was recreated in the park while people dined and had cocktails under the moonlight. The film was shown in&nbsp; the 'forest' portion of the Prospect Park lawn, which lent itself well to the film?s eerie mood."    Out : Does Everyone Love  Raymond ? Apparently not, as that significant cultural artifact The  urlLink National Enquirer &nbsp;says:   "Ray Romano's holdout for a huge raise is behind the recent firing of two popular "CSI" stars, charges an insider.   " urlLink George Eads  and Jorja Fox (Ed Note: Eads was rehired; claimed he "overslept" the contract deadline; yeah ...  riiight ) poked the CBS eye too hard when they tried Romano's stunt of squeezing the network for a fat raise shortly before the new season -- but the execs had decided not to tolerate a rerun of Romano's game plan."   "'CBS was furious last year when Romano held out for more money before agreeing to another season,' revealed an insider.   "'By the time Ray came to an agreement for his ninth and final season, he was making nearly $2 million per episode.'"   " urlLink The network moved swiftly to stop its other performers  from holding out for more money before their contracts were up, disclosed the insider."    In : The  urlLink always excellent Michael Musto  gives us the scoop on Cameron Diaz:  "As you know, CAMERON DIAZ wasn't happy with the Us Weekly cover on JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE's bad behavior and gave them a follow-up interview, which the mag cleverly fashioned into a dis of the British press. But I hear Cameron actually told an Us editor, 'You're going to get cancer writing this way about Justin.' That's not even original—ROSIE O'DONNELL, anyone?—but at least it's gritty and rock-and-roll. It's who she is!"    Editors Note : I've&nbsp;really got to apologize to USA Today for attacking them for not running Ann Coulter's piece yesterday.&nbsp;They were right. Here's some of&nbsp;her "convention reporting":   "Here at the Spawn of Satan convention in Boston, conservatives are deploying a series of covert signals to identify one another, much like gay men do. My allies are the ones wearing crosses or American flags. The people sporting shirts emblazoned with the 'F-word' are my opponents. Also, as always, the pretty girls and cops are on my side, most of them barely able to conceal their eye-rolling."   I was trying to be fair, arguing for&nbsp;equal time, but Ann&nbsp;Coulter really doesn't&nbsp;deserve it. She actually passed the Bar?      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;

TIME : What did you have to do without?    Teresa : For instance, one day a week I would not eat protein because I needed to buy a flower in the middle of winter.

      Ed Note: Defamer readers: The&nbsp;Christina Applegate and Ben Affleck story is right  urlLink here     Ann (Coulter) in the Can; (Michael) Moore on the Floor     &nbsp;    urlLink Drudgereport.com   leaves us to contemplate today the positively&nbsp; hideous  twin images of, "MOORE ON THE FLOOR, BUT ANN IN THE CAN," with all the caps out and the freak flag flying at full mast. ( The Corsair  shivers in horror) Let the record state, however,&nbsp;true believers, that  The Corsair  has neither interest in Coulter's&nbsp;"can," (averted gaze) nor "Moore on the floor," (exaggerated cough, feigned detatchment) to be quite frank.  It's just all so hideous, people :   "... Leftwing controversialist and Bush hater  Michael Moore  has free reign on the floor of the Dem convention hall -- and has been hired to write for USA TODAY at the Republican convention! 'Coulter has been hired for Boston, Moore has been hired for NY,' a USA TODAY source explained, unaware of the fallout with Coulter in Boston.   You've got to love Drudge, even if he appears, on his site,&nbsp;to be&nbsp;in a constant state of anxiety and exasperation, with all those all caps invective flying. Now,&nbsp;Drudgie Poo&nbsp;takes the time out to defend his equally exasperated pal, Ann Coulter:   "USA Today editors have spiked a daily convention column they commissioned from conservative controversialist Ann Coulter, the DRUDGE REPORT has learned. Coulter filed her first report from Boston Sunday night, only to be told hours later that editors found it 'unusable' and 'not funny.'   "'Apparently no one at USA TODAY had ever read Ann Coulter before!' Coulter, who has sold nearly a million copies of her various works and his written a syndicated column for five years, said from Boston."    Drudge&nbsp;has a point : play fair USA Today people, equal time for all: If Moore is covering the Republicans, then you should allow Coulter to&nbsp;do the&nbsp;same for&nbsp;the Democrats, with, of course, the caveat that the opinions of&nbsp;neither not reflect the usual cheesy cookie-cutter editorial opinion of your national "paper."    Update : The column may, ultimately,  urlLink be published  (link via  urlLink Romenesko ).

      Ed Note: Defamer readers: The&nbsp;Christina Applegate and Ben Affleck story is right  urlLink here     &nbsp;   Offer Nader the Attorney General Position     &nbsp;   The Corsair  would like to offer this free advice to The Democratic Party, now meeting in Boston, solemnly,&nbsp;to coalesce its scattered forces for the final November War:  Offer Ralph Nader the Attorney General position .   You know that this  urlLink crotchety old man &nbsp;covets this position, mouth watering, eyes agog with lust. He  savors  this tasty little morsel; one can almost imagine Nader praying lyrically to dark ancient gods --&nbsp;intoning softly, rhythmically,  intensely  -- all this after being named the Attorney General of the United States, targeting multinationals at will.  urlLink Nader  has spent his entire life -- from his graduation from Harvard Law School to the authorship of  urlLink Unsafe at Any Speed , to his creation of the "Nader's Raiders," to the endless Public Interest Research Groups (PIRG's) -- all this after a position of leverage in The Law. Nader translates his monastic&nbsp;disdain of romantic love into the single purpose of corporate scrutiny.  All of these inventions, all of this groping around in the ethical gray areas of the mechanisms of American capitalism, all this in the search of an  urlLink Archimedian point  on which to stand&nbsp;and remake the world into his image, a world where corporations are as hard on themselves as the conscientious Lord Ralph is, perhaps,&nbsp;on himself. That, true believr, at least  urlLink in theory .   Nader is a threat to  urlLink John Kerry , to be sure.&nbsp;He is a spoiler twice, a gadfly from the far flung left, and a harvester of radical youth discontent with roughly three percent of the electorate in his thrall. Nader is in the red-bronze twilight of a somewhat useful&nbsp;career as a consumer advocate. He knows this is his last hurrah, his last chance to the dance, and, secretly, I believe, he was tickled in a perverse way by his role as a spoiler in 2000. Nader was tickled, I believe, as an obscene poster in a chat room might be, or a graffiti artist having at a virginal, clean wall might be (uhm, or so I hear ...)   For the first time in his lonely and bitter struggle against Tha Man, the CEO's, the Masters of the Universe, he made a difference, he was a blip &nbsp;on the national radar, rather than some slightly unsavory B-Lister on the Georgetown social set.  He was not irrelevant . History would remember him, if only as an asterisk. Ivy League political science theses would herald him as a legitimate force.   At the beginning of the 21st century, it should be noted,  urlLink Attorney generals -- like urban mayors in the mid 90s, in the wake of Federalism&nbsp;-- are the new black . Eliot Spitzer has made the position hugely relevant. The CEO, as a sociological curiosity,&nbsp;is getting close scrutiny; they are no longer viewed as untouchable, invincible. Business journalism is all the rage. Public outcry is against the excesses of business -- think: Martha, Kenny Lay, and all the rest. An Attorney General of any state can make a difference -- how much greater the Attorney General of the United States?   How could Nader refuse&nbsp;this opportunity&nbsp;-- if presented reverently by, say, Howard Dean -- to be useful to the consumer on such a massive scale.&nbsp;Nader's psychology demands this validation. His ego, properly massaged, would allow him to step down gracefully, giving an extra convention bounce. As pollster Mark Mellman writes in  urlLink The Hill :   "Going into the 1992 Democratic convention, Bill Clinton was running third and Ross Perot was in second place, garnering 30 percent of the vote. During the convention, Perot dropped out, temporarily increasing Clintons margin by 28 points. Clintons gain had less to do with the convention and lots to do with Perot"   So, what's the worst that could happen? The cantankerous Nader has as much a chance of surviving a Senate confirmation hearing for the AG position as Howard Stern has of getting inducted into the National Organization of Women. But if you won't&nbsp;say anything&nbsp;neither will I.   &nbsp;

       A Little of the Old In and Out     In :  LA.com's blog . Let's break for a second to consider Hollywood and not Washington for a second (And, incidentally, of Tinseltown, mirabile dictu,  urlLink Fashionweekdaily  reports: "Soho House is scouting spots for their L.A. outpost and calling in the opinions of fashion insiders to see if they should actually make the move out west," which means, of course, that leaky air conditioners can now leak on you on  urlLink both coasts ).  Anyhoo : The  urlLink LA.com blog  gives us this deliciously nasty blind item:   "Dolly wonders how long that fresh, funky movie star will get away free and clear before someone busts her Winona-style for her light-fingered ways. All her friends know that she has such a mania for keeping her sensitive skin looking great that she seeks out the best spas and salons for facials and treatments wherever she goes. But though she makes plenty of moolah, she just loves to snake expensive skin care products when the busy facialists and salon owners aren?t looking. Recently at a Santa Monica spa, she got caught red-handed with a bagful of pricey product and, being famed for her skill at improv, she quickly spun a tale to the beautician about how she only put the goodies in the bag so that she could remember exactly which items had been used on her so she could buy them before checking out. They didn?t buy it any more than we do, but they let her slip that one time. "    Out :  Bonnie Fuller . Can she get more out after the public&nbsp;excoriation by  Vanity Fair ? Possibly. But she has the cunning of  urlLink Machiavelli  with regard to damage control in the wake of Star Magazine's tough gossip, and the fostering of future goodwill among those A-Listers. According to  urlLink Fashionweekdaily's Daily Spy :   "It looks like Bonnie Fuller has found a novel way to ensure she has at least a friend or two in Hollywood, in her continual efforts to win over celebrity flacks despite the damaging stories Star magazine does on their clients.&nbsp; Fuller has&nbsp;apparently hired top PR firm PMK /HBH, which reps everyone from  Jennifer Aniston  to  Gwyneth Paltrow , to handle PR for next month's Star-sponsored premiere of 'Growing Up Gotti,' A&E?s new reality show vehicle for Star writer and mob daughter Victoria Gotti&nbsp;. Considering the often antagonistic relationship between PMK/HBH and Fuller?Gwyneth Paltrow once referred to her as 'the devil' and Paltrow?s rep  Stephen Huvane  seems to support that view?it's surprising that the company took the job at all. 'It must be costing Bonnie?or should we say David Pecker?a bundle,' says one insider."    In :  Terry McAuliffe . Despite the fact that, in many ways,&nbsp;the Clinton loyalist&nbsp;is DNC Chair  urlLink in name only , todays&nbsp; urlLink Washington Post  hails him, thusly:   "(McAuliffe) forced a controversial change in the primary campaign schedule and pressed state chairmen to give up exclusive control of their voter lists. He also invested millions in a new headquarters, and gambled that the party could mount a challenge to the GOP's three decades of dominating fundraising.   "Every one of these high-risk tactics paid off. The schedule change gave Kerry time to raise more than $200 million; the DNC now has a voter list with information on more than 170 million people, which allows the party to develop its own direct-mail donor list. The new headquarters, in turn, is wired to run an operation increasingly dependent on the Internet and the facilities to produce all forms of telecommunications and traditional media."   But don't expect Terry to cut impromptu checks, true believer, according to a  urlLink June 4th Page Six item , "No checks are written until ( urlLink general election chairman of the DNC John) Sasso  signs off. No decisions are made until Sasso says so," said one Democrat. "Terry McAuliffe was told to take it, or take a hike. And he's taking it."&nbsp;&nbsp;   And Teresa's shoving it ....    Out : &nbsp; Teresa Heinz Kerry, Liability?  Teresa is, by all accounts, a bright, sexy&nbsp;and sophisticated woman of 65.&nbsp;Teresa speaks five languages, and, those who know her say,&nbsp;she speaks&nbsp;all of them with a charming sass.&nbsp; The Corsair &nbsp;is not averse to a&nbsp;saucy woman of the Heinz variety (no pun intended). But&nbsp;Heinz-Kerry is an eccentric billionaire, used to speaking her mind, on anything, and -- we won't say  urlLink we told you so  -- she is having&nbsp;difficulties sticking to the Kerry-Edwards script, staying, as it were,&nbsp;on point,  urlLink according to the Washington Post :   "Teresa Heinz Kerry urged home-state delegates to the Democratic National Convention to restore a more civil tone to politics, then minutes later told a journalist to  'shove it.'    "'We need to turn back some of the creeping, un-Pennsylvanian and sometimes un-American traits that are coming into some of our politics,' the wife of Democratic candidate Sen. John F. Kerry (Mass.) told fellow Pennsylvanians on Sunday night at a Massachusetts Statehouse reception.   "Minutes later,  Colin McNickle , editorial page editor of the conservative Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, questioned her on what she meant by the term 'un-American,' according to a tape of the encounter recorded by Pittsburgh station WTAE-TV.   "Heinz Kerry said, 'I didn't say that' several times to McNickle. She turned to confer with Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell and others.   "When she faced McNickle again a short time later, he continued to question her, and she replied, 'You said something I didn't say. Now shove it.'"   And, of course, this will be discussed hotly in Teresa's home state (and, ironically, the important swing state) Pennsylvania.&nbsp;    &nbsp;   In: Tina Brown's Painful to Watch Larry Flynt Interview.  Not that Tina Brown is a prude or anything, but how  uncomfortable  did it seem when Tina, " urlLink Lady Evans " (2nd item) if you're nasty, &nbsp;interviewed  urlLink porcine  pornographer  Larry Flynt , the man with the pink jet, &nbsp;a man not known for elegant and sophisticated discussion.  urlLink Gawker's Henry the Intern &nbsp;captures the tone:   "Tina then cornered pornographer Larry Flynt for publishing photos of Jackie Onassis naked. 'I would publish photographs of Queen Elizabeth,' he said. 'You're not selling sex in those photographs, you're selling the icon status of the individuals involved.' Good thing Tina interrupted him from nearly equating the rise of religion and increased porn sales to Bush and Kerry voters, respectively, but she couldn't stop him from describing 70 naked women: 'their pubes were all gone. . . they think men want to see these big, [implanted] watermelons.' Flynt said he doesn't know the current version of  Courtney Love . 'The book is provocative,' closed Tina. 'And so are you.'"   Thanks for sharing, Larry. Like school on Saturday, &nbsp;Mr. Flynt has -- altogether now, gang, " no class "!    Out :  urlLink  Former Governor John Rowlands  . &nbsp; ( The Corsair's  favorite  urlLink political punching bag ) .   urlLink According to Page Six , Rowlands is going from the State House to the Big House:   "JOHN Rowland ? who stepped down in disgrace as governor of Connecticut before the state legislature could impeach him ? will soon cop a plea to tax evasion, sources say. Rowland has been under investigation for months by the office of  U.S. Attorney Kevin O'Connor , who has recused himself from working on the case personally because of his friendship with Rowland. The Republican has yet to be formally charged. 'A deal has been made,' said one insider. 'The feds originally insisted he do 11 months in jail, but have agreed to five.' When the five-month figure was run past another well-connected insider, the power-broker said, 'Even less.'"    In :  Public Restrooms at the Democrat Convention . So funny, from the  urlLink AP (A pee-pee?):    "Media members, already perturbed by long security lines, may find themselves waiting in line for something nearly as important. As the majority of the print reporters arrived Saturday at the FleetCenter for the Democratic National Convention, tongues clucked when they saw the restroom facilities that they will be using for the next week.&nbsp;   "Twenty portable restrooms, like those used on construction sites, are lined up in front of the media pavilion to service nearly 1,200 members of the print media who will be working around the clock. That's about 60 serious coffee-drinkers per toilet.   "'That's absurd,' said Jim Drinkard, a political reporter for USA Today, when he heard of the ratio of toilets per media member."

       Brandy Never Married?     &nbsp;  Today the always excellent  urlLink Rush and Molloy  (3rd item down) excavate the murky depths of formerly sqeaky-clean singer Brandy's life, and come up with a shocker:   "R&B star Brandy is laying low now that the man she said was her husband is claiming they never were married."    The Corsair's  curiosity is piqued as he sips, slowly,&nbsp;from his  urlLink "icy" pimp goblet .   "Two years ago, Brandy and music producer Robert Smith went on Oprah  urlLink to announce they'd secretly wed in 2001 . But Smith said on WBLS-FM last week that they'd made up the marriage story to protect Brandy's wholesome image, because she was pregnant with their daughter, Sy'rai, now 2.   "Brandy, who has said they were ' urlLink divorced ' last year, doesn't deny Smith's tale, but she did say in a statement: 'I'm deeply hurt and shocked by the things that Robert has been saying. We had a spiritual union.   "'He is not thinking about [Sy'rai], me or what we had together. He is trying to destroy my reputation, while using me and our daughter to get publicity and radio airplay for his artists. I am stunned that he is being so dirty about it.'"   Fellow gossip archaeologists  urlLink AZCentral.com  also excavate and finds&nbsp;these chestnuts:   "Smith was a guest on the 'Moment of Truth,' a feature of 'The Wendy Williams Experience,' broadcast weekdays from 3 to 5 p.m. on Power 99, WUSL-FM, when he dropped the bombshell that he and Brandy were never married.   "... He said Brandy was his  urlLink 'jump-off'  chick and that he was still seeing another woman, who is now seven months pregnant. This other woman, a film producer, Smith says, will remain anonymous.   "Smith told Williams it was  Sonia Norwood , Brandy's mom/manager, who cooked up the idea to play house to protect Brandy's then-wholesome image. Brandy was pregnant with Smith's child, and it just wouldn't do for the young songstress to be an unwed mother, Smith says, so they simply pretended to be married.   "He reportedly had Sy'rai with him at the station when he said all this, so we're guessing Brandy did not know he was going to discuss what he called the 'real version vs. the MTV version.' You must remember this: MTV did a huge splash on Brandy and Robert getting married and 'having their baby.'"   Say it aint so,  urlLink Mo .

        Congressman Alexander Switches Parties    This dude,  urlLink Rep. Rodney Alexander , is so devilishly calm, so  sneaky , so silent as he did it, so  interesting , that I am  fascinated  by what logistics went on behind the scenes that caused him to switch parties and take such a gamble at a time when, quite frankly, anything can happen and it usually does.  In these partisan days, where all collegial comeraderie and sense of compromise has gone the Way of the Dodo, I'd thought I'd seen everything --  everything!  -- and here comes Rodney Alexander, who schools me but good on  Politicking 101 . I didn't even see this one coming, I don't think anyone did, not even the political junkies at TheHill.com, and certainly not the "plugged in" cats on  urlLink CNN's Inside Politics , or  urlLink Chris Matthews ' Hard Ball.  Old Rod just gave us all a lesson in the political snooker, and how an unassuming Congressman can steal the weekend. Who knew he had game like that? He and  Alan Keyes  are the players of the week  urlLink the AP reports :  "In 48 hours,  urlLink Rep. Rodney Alexander  went from Democrat to Republican, friend to foe — or foe to friend, depending on your political persuasion.  "Democrats reacted to the news by calling the first-term congressman a turncoat and a coward. They must now gain another seat,  12  in all, to win back the House this fall. The count today: Democrats  205 , Republicans  229 . "A new ally, on the other hand, rang him up Friday to say congratulations. President Bush according to White House spokesman  Scott McClellan , welcomed Alexander to the GOP and wished him well.  "Alexander's about-face came about in two days, but had really been in the works for two years. After announcing his new affiliation Friday afternoon, Alexander said he had been struggling with his conservative votes for his entire term — backing the Bush tax cuts as well as the war in Iraq — and noted they had brought him criticism from Democrats.  "'I just decided it would be best for me to switch parties, that I would be more effective in the 5th District in the state of Louisiana as a Republican,' he said.  "In March, Alexander found himself under such intense pressure that he had to publicly announce he would remain a Democrat. Yet, he skipped last month's National Convention in Boston.  "On Wednesday, Alexander registered at the start of qualifying for the 5th District race as a Democrat. Friday afternoon,  the last day of qualifying  for the Nov. 2 ballot, he made his switch, leaving Democrats no time to enter a strong candidate in the race."  Damn, that's some  urlLink Machiavelli-sneaky shit  right there. That's  urlLink downright Cajun . Especially considering Louisisana is a swing state, but will more likely go for Bush (if it doesn't, Alexander is royally fucked when payback comes) than Kerry and trends Republican. And, of course, you just know the Congressional Republicans have a cornucopia of campaign cash, PAC cash and special lucrative committee assignments for his district, "face time" with POTUS, and such booty as to boggle the imagination to bestow to this Prince. It was a shrewd move, and I'd counsel Democrats to avoid looking like punks and just move on, no use crying over spilt milk.  Check,  Karl Rove; checkmate ...  to be determined at a later date.

       Who Is the Queen of The Blogosphere?     Those Brits are always starting trouble,  fucking always : first it was  urlLink taxation without representation , then the lethally  urlLink unfunny Benny Hill , which spawned a generation of molesters, and now ...  urlLink this : a 3 page London Independent article on  urlLink Stephanie Klein . Frankly, I like Stephanies blog, and I'm glad she's getting the international attention, and, by virtue of that, all of us bloggers trapped in this New York clusterfuck.  Stephanie, if you don't frequent her blog, is the witty cutie who was once asked out by  Chris "Mr. Big" Noth . The Independent took to calling her"Manhattan's weblog internet queen," which, in turn, you can imagine, set off some blogosphere controversy, the likes of which we haven't seen since the  urlLink Krucoff vs. Lockhart Steele Wars .   urlLink Felix at MemeFirst  weighs in:  "First: weblog internet queen? As opposed to, oh, weblog cuneiform tablet queen? More to the point, the entries are unreadable, even for someone who lives here: I can't imagine a UK reader caring about them in the slightest.  "Still, the Independent does raise an interesting question: who is the weblog internet queen of Manhattan? Back in October, I  urlLink announced  that 'the true queen of the blogosphere' was  urlLink Jen Chung  ... Widening the competition to include the likes of  urlLink Maccers  and  urlLink Eurotrash , who would you nominate?"   urlLink The excellent Nichelle  responded, justly, bringing up some names we are familiar with, and some new to us:  "Hey, what about me? or  urlLink Lindsayism ? the  urlLink Real Janelle ?  urlLink Culture Kitchen ?  urlLink LustyLady ?  urlLink AlexisT ?  urlLink Brazilian Muse ?  urlLink Sweet Blog O'Mine ?  urlLink Standard Deviance ?  urlLink Ultragrrl ?  urlLink Hottpants ?"  To which I'd like to add to the list  urlLink SocialiteLife's   Miu Von Furstenberg,  and    urlLink  La Depressionada   .    Have I missed any? I'm sure I have. I'm writing this hung over on a Saturday morning. Who do you think gets the Internet Queen of Manhattan? If we go beyond Manhattan, why not  urlLink OldHag  and  urlLink Sarah Weinman  (Is Sarah a Manhattanite? I don't know; I do know, however, that she got her Master's at John Jay, but she occupies a sort of sexy and spaceless "all crime all the time"frame in her blog, so I'm not sure)?  (And why is this only Manhattan? Is this some British plot to separate the boroughs and reclaim her colonies? Fuck if I know, people. I'd just ask: Who is the Queen of the Internet).  And when Is Lindsay going to allow us to comment back on her blog? I guess when people behave. Damn, I miss the to-and-fro on that blog with comments.

       A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  Happy Birthday  to two of our favorite bloggers,  urlLink OldHag  and  urlLink Uncle Grambo , Leo's both. May they keep going on informing and amusing us for as long as "this thing of ours" drives us.   Out :  Dale Peck,  the man we love to hate. The man who survived  urlLink a brutal bitchslap attack from Stanley Crouch  is interviewed in  urlLink Gothamist . So best.   In: Croatia,  but, you probably already knew that .  According to  urlLink Fashionweekdaily :  " Jessica Shaw , in her 'Shaw Report' for this week’s Entertainment Weekly,  urlLink declared vacationing in Croatia as 'in.'  What a coincidence, as  Lauren Davis , the J. Mendel public relations director, sent  The Daily  a postcard this week from her trip abroad:  'Dear Daily,  'I am in Croatia! It sounds like a bad joke but it’s true! I am here for some good ol’ fashion Eastern-European fun—they say it is the new St. Tropez, you know! In all seriousness, it is a marvelous place. [My boyfriend] and I came here on a boat last summer and are doing the same trip again. We’re starting in Dubrovnick and ending in Venice.'"   Out :  Theft . Sticky fingered vulgarians robbed both  urlLink  Al Gore   ,  our former Vice President, and  Paris Hilton  this week. One imagines  Dominick Dunne  is in hot pursuit, Mont Blanc at the ready, Jermyn Street tailored shirt rustling.  According to  urlLink the Page Sixers , re: Gore:  "Al Gore — for the first time since he was elected v.p. in 1992 — decided to do without security on a vacation in Italy. Bad move. 'The Gores were robbed while staying in a luxurious villa in Castellina,' a Tuscan source told the London Spy column in the Daily Telegraph. 'One of the neighbors went in to sympathize, and Al told him that the thieves had taken about $35,000 worth of valuables.' Gore purportedly was kicking himself for leaving his bodyguards behind."   urlLink The AP , like via  urlLink Defamer , said this re: Paris:  "Police confirmed Friday they were investigating a burglary at the Hollywood Hills home of Paris and Nicky Hilton.  "Someone broke into the house Wednesday night, but detectives haven't identified a suspect, Officer  Esther Reyes  said. She wouldn't comment on what was stolen, citing the ongoing investigation.  "Us Weekly magazine quoted an unnamed Hilton family member, who said the burglar took off with hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, jewelry and personal items.  "Another unnamed source told the magazine that a laptop computer, several designer purses, video tapes and photographs of  Paris Hilton ...  with ex-boyfriend  Nick Carter  were also taken.  "Paris Hilton's publicist,  Gina Hoffman , confirmed the burglary but had no further comment."   In :  Rick James . (This Rick James Dead  urlLink Link  via the most excellent Tom from  urlLink The Media Drop ). In Memoriam,  urlLink Charlie Murphy's True Hollywood Story  (Corsair blog link)  While Rick James is probably asking Saint Peter --as we "speak" -- questions, like: What did the two angel wings say to the face? Or, Does Heaven, by virtue of being Heaven, contain the "Stickiest" of the "Ickiest, " or saying, upon watching someone being denied entry into Heaven -- "Cold Blooded"! We will miss the original superfreak, as a source of fun and the fragility of life (okay, that was a bit pretentious, forgive me). Rick James, RIP   Out :  Caroline McAteer , the publicist for  urlLink embattled celebs   Posh Spice  and  urlLink David "Bend It Like" Bekham , and her former clients, out:  all .  urlLink According to the 3AM Girls , the Beckham Titanic is sinking:  "VICTORIA Beckham has jettisoned a major cog in the  urlLink First Family's  'truth' machine - their publicist  Caroline McAteer .  "After years of 'spinning' to protect their image, it is all over for the ruthless, bubble-haired flunky who has been given the boot by the increasingly desperate duo."

       The New "Urban" Tom Cruise (TM)      Tom Cruise  has unmistakably emerged from the crysalis of his  urlLink messy break up with Nicole Kidman  and the  urlLink public reassessment of the A-List  in  urlLink an "urban" mode .  I'd like to take full credit for describing Tom's reincarnation as Urban, but it was the Opening venue of "Collateral" at the Urban Film Festival -- a move that had Tom's calculating fingerprints all over it -- that helped me decide on the term.  Now  everyone's  running with it.   urlLink Canada's Globe and Mail yesterday :  "They define two ways of being in the urban jungle. With his grey silk suit to match his hair, Vincent suggests a silver fox (the predator image is underscored when a coyote, eyes flaring briefly, crosses in front of the taxi). Max, with his rabbitty overbite, dark clothes and old-fashioned glasses, chooses camouflage and avoidance."  Canada's  urlLink National Post :  "Like Mann's Heat, which was also set in Los Angeles, Collateral viscerally captures a certain urban dichotomy: the veneer of gauzy glamour covering the city's dangerous underbelly. The sun is going down, smothering everything in a smoggy, orange haze. Cars lazily navigate the streets of downtown L.A. as The Roots' The Seed 2.0 plays in the background. But something darker is going on underneath, and Mann understands and conveys those discordant rhythms. "  They get the idea, but they miss the point: yes, the film is urban, but, more importantly, so is Tom, which is a long way from being Maverick in Top Gun, or the best bartender in the world in Cocktail, or Born on The Fourt of July. Tom is moving away from the All-American perfect guy and into a darker more postmodern multiethnic space. Could you imagine Tom, 5 years ago, under Pat Kingsley, interviewing  Jada Pinkett-Smith  for Interview Magazine? Or taking a  urlLink subordinate bad guy role under Jamie Foxx ? Me neither.  Guys,  that's  the story.  And, just remember, you hear it here first.

       Kimora Simmons' Life & Style   I, for one, cannot wait to see  urlLink Kimora Simmons' new show Life &amp; Style :   I know what you are thinking to yourself, 'No, Ron didn't just compliment Kimora, no, he didn't.  But, yes, I did; but it is, of course, a  backhanded  compliment"look out"), and not, to be sure, the reason that one might think that I may wish to see Kimora in action on tv. You see,  The Corsair  likes to watch a natural disaster every now and again, where, all in all, no one dies, or is even hurt.  This is cathartic, restorative, medicinal even. And, thusly,  urlLink Fashionweekdaily  piqued our ( The Corsair  makes ironic quotation marks out of thin air with his fingers) "Kimora curiosity" -- shall we say, about her new View-like show, which sounds, quite frankly, like  urlLink The Poseidon Adventure  (... and guess who plays the  urlLink Rosemary Clooney  character?):    "The quartet, made up of  Kimora Lee Simmons ,  Jules Asner ,  Cynthia Garrett , and  Lynne Koplitz , hope to become the 'it' show for women with compelling fashion, celebrity, relationship, and lifestyle content. Asner serves as the show’s  'Meredith Viera'  while Cynthia Garrett is more 'Star Jones' ( Ed Note : Eeeeww)— you can see an air of annoyance, for example, come over her because of the amateur behavior of her co-host, 'Speak English bi-otch,' she finally yelled at Simmons. Adding to the delicious cattiness, Koplitz told Simmons to 'act like a lady' because of her constant fighting.  "Simmons, wearing an overload of diamonds for daytime, brought her Baby Phat entourage with her, 'Why are you wearing sunglasses?' she asked one of her employees. The answer unimportant, she moved on, 'I wore eyeglasses yesterday to court but I didn’t tell anybody they were prescription.' She did keep it real however, by wearing Baby Phat jeans for the show. Simmons does provide much comic relief in edited segments of her trying to bargain shop—with coupons! Her assignment was to shop for a family of four for under $100. She spent $96 and bought a flat iron for her hair."   Oh, it's on like Gray Poupon , people, from now until the debut, that's my mantra; we are  so  there; TiVo's set for stun.

       That Very Special Diffrnt Strokes Episode          Do you remember that "Very Special Differnt Strokes" espisode that gave us this iconic image of "TV with a message"?  Assad Kelada  did himself proud. I was just thinking about this episode the other day, and how naive and funny it was, but, at the time, it was a big deal. I think the cast came out at the end to start a "dialogue" on the issue of child molestation.  The gang at  urlLink Jump The Shark  put it all in perspective, caring more about the names and pop cultural references than the "specialness" of the episode:  "... the appearance of  Gordon Jump  (a.k.a.  Mr. Malone  on  Growing Pains ) was creepy. remember he was that scary pettafile (sic-- Ed Note: This is a  very  creative spelling of that word). He made arnold and dudley play 'jungle adventure' and watch porno's while he snapped pictures."  And:  "Kudos to the last entry regarding  Mr. Carlson's  ( Gordon Jump ) molestation of  Gary Coleman  (Arnold) and  urlLink Shavar Ross ( Dudley ).  That single episode may have been the most famous 'very special episode' to ever appear on TV. Mr. Carlson was a bicycle shop owner who made Arnold and Dudley drink wine and watch dirty mice cartoons and play 'Jungle Adventure.' Arnold wised up and decided to leave - Dudley made fun of Arnold for leaving, but it would be Dudley who had egg on his face when Mr. Carlson touched Dudley where he 'didn't want to be touched' The worst performance by an actor to ever appear in a single television episode award had to go to  Lee Tari  (Dudley's father) (he ironically also appeared on the shark jumping/Very Special Episode of  urlLink 'What's Happening Now'  as  Doctor Blood  a retired gang-banger who became an unassuming plumber) who showed about as much emotion as an iceberg after finding out that the owner of WKRP/Maytag Repairman tried to have sex with his son. After this episode it was many more very special episodes for DS (Kimberly & Arnold are kidnapped by a photographer; Sam gets kidnapped buying potato chips) and all downhill. "  All the posters seemed to remember that the game the molester proposed was called "Jungle Adventure," which is kind of odd when you think that that's what we all came away with after all that self-important writing. Oh yeah,  urlLink Shavar Ross, who played Dudley is now a born again Christian , like  urlLink Willie Ames , who so ably played  urlLink Buddy Lembeck on Charles in Charge  (and Scott Baio's sleazy pal in  urlLink Zapped ), but now makes straight-to-video religious shorts in Kansas. Shavar even has his own church. I guess you kind of have to turn to Jesus in a big way once you've had people kissing your ass in LA before you hit puberty and then you are a has-been once your voice breaks. Either Jesus or drug addiction.  (Ed Note: No posts tommorrow, due to work commitments)

       James St. James Interviews Michael Alig              urlLink Gawker   -- God bless you,  Choire , for finding something hot in this slow news week --   turns our attention to this interview on  urlLink World of Wonder  between  James St. James  and convicted murderer/club kid  Michael Alig . Hilarity ensues. It's just like old times:  " James : Well, the last time I talked to you, you had protection from someone, from some prison gang or something, and there was some crazy black guy banging on your cell trying to get your stuff.  "M ichael : That was the last time you talked to me?!  " James : Yeah. It’s been like two months.  " Michael : Oh my gosh, that was just after I got here to this facility!  " James : And you were telling me how much you loved it. Tell me again how much you love it.  " Michael : Well (laughs), not any more.  " James : You were saying it was like the  urlLink Roxy , that everyone walks around with their shirts off. " Michael : Well, yeah, it is like that. We get a choice to go to the gym or the yard every night – or the field house as they call it. It’s like this big auditorium, like the size of the Roxy dancefloor.  " James : And there’s music and stuff?  " Michael : Well, they’ve got those huge video screens, like the kind that are like…  " James : ...the Palladium ones?  " Michae l: Exactly. There are three of them and they each play a different kind of music: one is disco, one is rock, and one is rap.  " James : High-energy dance music in prison, yay!"   High energy dance music indeed  . James St. James  later delivers what can only be construed as the  Most Surreal Line  (one, incidentally, that could just as easily been filched from a  Bob Dylan  song) when he asks, "Do you really NEED somebody to say I love you at the dinner table, when you're dining with murderers and thieves?"

       Alan Keyes Versus Barack Obama?     According to The  urlLink AP  (link via  urlLink Matt Drudge ) the GOP is considering running   urlLink Alan Keyes   against  Barack Obama :  "With the general election less than three months away, former presidential hopeful Alan Keyes says he needs a few days to decide whether he wants to accept the Illinois GOP's offer to be its Senate candidate.  urlLink   "Keyes, a Maryland resident, told Republican leaders who offered him the nomination Wednesday night that he would make his decision known Sunday. Under the law, Keyes would have to live in Illinois only by Election Day. Asked how he felt about making a Senate run from a state he had never lived in, he responded: 'As a matter of principle, I don't think it's a good idea.'  "'It has to be something where I would be convinced it's not only consonant with federalism as I understand it but that it's in the best interest of the state and of the nation,' Keyes said.  "If he enters the race, Keyes will be stepping into the national spotlight with another Harvard-educated, polished debater — Democratic rising star Barack Obama — and setting up the first Senate election with two black candidates representing the major parties."  The debate between Keyes, a  urlLink Straussian  who studied under  urlLink Allan Bloom , and  urlLink Barack ,  a professor at the  urlLink University of Chicago Law School  would be magnificent.

       A Little of the Old In and Out      In:  urlLink Borat . Ali G's  hapless Kazakstanian television reporter revealed just last week what we all know that Arizona redneck's in dive bars think about Jewish people. Irony is like kryptonite to a hick.     Out: Brittany Murphy, Singer.  We still say that this actress with those big crazy eyes is going to end up in the mugshot section of Smokinggun.com. Soon. Actually, she's trying to get an album released a la Minnie Driver, as she tells that significant cultural artifact,  urlLink The Star :  " Star : You sing in the movie. Do you want to do an album?  " Brittany Murphy : Yes. I've already started. It's sort of a hybrid of hip-hop and jazz. I want it to be something timeless that my grandchildren can listen to."  Hip hop and Jazz and Brittney Murphy: Priceless.   In : In  urlLink Joyce Wadler's Boldface column :  "BENJI, on tour for her soon-to-be-released movie 'Benji: Off the Leash,' has suffered complications after surgery at the Eye Care for Animals clinic in Wheeling, Ill.  Benji's spokeswoman, MELANIE FRENKEL, said the dog had had 'a severe allergic reaction to medication,' and suffered a blood clot behind the retina. 'B: O.T.L.'' is to be Benji's big comeback after a hiatus of 17 years."  Now, is this the same Benji who did those movies when I was a kid in the 70s( urlLink citizenslunchbox  describes him thus, "Super-intelligent mutt; possibly a terrier mix:)? If so, this dog -- in dog years -- must be pretty old. And, follow up question, whatever happened to that Benji knock off " urlLink Here's Boomer ."   Out :   urlLink Gana La Verde  , the new Spanish Tv Game show that plays on some crazy bad stereotypes.  urlLink The AP describes it :  "A Spanish-language reality TV show is offering contestants an unusual prize: the services of immigration lawyers to guide them toward a green card for U.S. residency.  "'Gana la Verde'  'Win the Green' began airing daily last month on KRCA-TV Channel 62 in Los Angeles. Owner Liberman Broadcasting also airs the program on its San Diego, Houston and Dallas stations.  "'People say that our show is like Fear Factor, but it's different because the climax of the show involves working," production manager  Adrian Vallarino  told the Los Angeles Times."  Jesus, how many more bad Latino stereotypes can be thrown in to complete the overall effect?  The Corsair  wonders if  Adrian Vallarino  will have the bad taste to serve Arroz con Pollo and cerveza to the contestants in a Taco Bell Chihuahua uniform while doing  urlLink Charo's "coochie coochie" dance . And what not.

All that media ambition, all those glossies celebrating the  urlLink ambitious young urban crowd in the Blue States , the  urlLink starfucking ,  urlLink the Beth Ostrowsky cover  to get in the good graces of Howard Stern,  urlLink the parties . He's  sneaky!   Imagine our surprise, when  urlLink Gawker.com's special Hampton's Correspondent  caught The Jason in his crosshairs, like some big game hunter, as he was grazing:  "Jason Binn was out in full force, looking like a serious frump machine with his Guy Trebay-style button down shirt sloppily half-untucked. It was a weird sight, watching him gently place one hand on David Lee Roth?s shoulder (see also:  urlLink NY Social Diary  party pictures of August 3rd) and stare off vacantly into space as Roth mumbled sweet nothings to some young blondes. During the dinner, I noticed a man had left the tent and was peeing in the woods. ?Jason!?? I called out. There was no response. It may have been the three mojitos talking, but I really, really, really think it was him."   Out : The  urlLink LA.com Blog  speculates that behind  Patti Davis'  tryout with ABC lie dark network ulterior motives:  "LA's own Patti Davis has had quite a life. Daughter of a president. Out and out  urlLink rebel . Pictorial for Playboy. Wife of a yoga instructor. Best-seller  urlLink author . And now newest correspondent for "PrimeTime Thursday"? Sources say ABC is giving Davis a tryout for a permanent gig with the show. Of course, there's also a lot of muttering among the staff there that ABC wants to score the first post-Ronnie TV interview with Nancy Reagan, and who better to help arrange it? But did NBC get there first? After all, Davis's brother, Ron Reagan Jr., has scored himself a great  urlLink gig  with MSNBC."     In: Jennifer and Richard Pryor.  They met in the freewheeling 70s ("keep on truckin'!"), she was a petite model who had "dated"  Warren Beatty  (hasn't everyone in LA?) and he was the hottest comedian in the land, but with  urlLink his demons . Because of those demons, Jennifer left Pryor. Now, years after the divorce, they are back together again. And now Richard, suffering from MS,  urlLink is the one being taken care of  by Jennifer. According  urlLink to Star :  "Jennifer says that she set about turning his life around, firing all of the help and starting from scratch by bringing in a new team of doctors. She also streamlined his expenditures and created new sources of revenue in the form of specials (his most recent special,  urlLink Richard Pryor: I Ain't Dead Yet, Motherf**er , ran last  urlLink November on Comedy Central ) and re-releases of comedy albums. And though Pryor was worth millions in his heyday, Jennifer says extravagant spending left him with a modest estate -- he has less than $1 million in cash left. 'We are not wealthy,' she says."  But, evidently, they are happy.   Out :  Moby Drinks . According to  urlLink Page Six :  "'We started bottling them because in a fit of naivete and hubris, we thought that Teany drinks were great and that people would love them,' he tells us. 'And we've learned through sweet and painful trial and error that the Teany Peach Berry Green Tea Cooler mixes far too well with vodka.' Moby will perform a rare deejay stint atop the roof of 60 Thompson tonight at a bash to promote the drinks. "  I love those tiny little tea leaves in tetley tea, but naivete and hubris are my favorite flavors, so I'm sticking. Am I the only one in this room who wants to punch Moby?

When Homer and Marge realize their son is missing, he fakes his own kidnapping to avoid punishment."  Folks, I couldn't make this up if I tried.  Comment here on on  urlLink VH1's Best Week Ever Blog .   Out :  Sharon Stone . According to the  urlLink 3AM Girls :  "PURRING wildly to promote a movie which critics have universally panned, Sharon Stone couldn't have looked happier on the red carpet alongside Halle Berry at last night's premiere. But behind the scenes of Catwoman it's a different story - the fur is flying between Sharon and her fellow co-stars.  "We can reveal that while  Halle  and cast members, including  Benjamin Bratt  and  Lambert Wilson , are staying at the plush Dorchester Hotel, on London's Park Lane, Madame Stone has demanded to stay separately in a suite at the £1,800-a-night Claridges hotel instead. Her decision has proved irritating to say the least, especially as the press junkets are being held at the Dorchester.  "Insiders tell us Sharon is being a true pro about her promotional duties but when she's not working she just wants her 'own space'. So, while the cast have been getting together and dining at swanky restaurants such as Nobu, the 46-year-old star has taken walks with her assistant around Knightsbridge."   The Corsair  pauses for a second. He needs his "own space."  "We also hear that Sharon, who wore a 20s-style gown to the bash, has no plans to join the rest of the cast at the film's other European premieres. Which leaves them to promote the lame film, described as a 'purr-fectly ridiculous and boring cat-astrope'. One New York critic said: 'Even with Halle Berry cavorting like a third-rate dominatrix, it's as sexy as a hairball.'"  "A well-placed insider tells us: 'It's as if Sharon just wants to get the work over with so she can get back home as quickly as possible.'"  Can you blame her?  urlLink

       Madonna on the Rocks      Borderline ...  looks like she's going to lose her mind, if he keeps on pushing her love ... over the borderline. Or something like that ( The Corsair  bows and graciously accepts applause) ... so kind, thank you, thank you ... thank you, so kind, so very kind.  According to that significant cultural artifact,  urlLink The National Enquirer  ("because Enquiring Minds want to know"), Madonna's marriage is on the borderline:  "Witnessing the obsessive devotion Madonna's fans have shown her on her tour -- while watching his own career wane -- has fueled Guy's insecurity and jealousy, the close source said."  The Corsair  swiftly grabs a bag of unsalted popcorn, leaps, and, in a single bound, lands squarely on the chair in front of his computer screen.  "Guy's star has faded. His adaptation of the Italian film  urlLink 'Swept Away'  with Madonna as the star was a complete disaster."   The Corsair  nods, sadly, rubbing his  urlLink Kabbalah red string bracelet , whispering, "Swept Away was not a film, it was a cocktail commercial."  "He still has a huge ego but now when he looks in the mirror every day, he sees  Mr. Madonna , rather than  Guy Ritchie , filmmaker extraordinaire.  "There's no question he's completely devoted to their son  Rocco  and  Madonna's  daughter by  Carlos Leon ,  Lourdes .  "But the simple fact is, Guy can't seem to stand that he'll always be behind Madonna in terms of success.  "'Guy is wounded and hurt so he's lashing out at Madonna, accusing her of infidelity. I think he's sabotaging their relationship.'  "As soon as Madonna kicked off her Re-Invention Tour in late May, 'Guy became agitated and in a bad mood,' said the insider.  "If he wasn't with her at all times, he was in cell phone contact."   urlLink Human, all too human . Doesn't this all sound  urlLink familiar ?

       Brando was the king of the mooners    Marlon Brando  was an large personality with, I'd imagine, comparatively ample butt cheeks, as Diane Keaton, woefully, reminds us.  urlLink Rush and Molloy  have an intersting story today about the mingling of hollywood and cafe society, a la Brando:  "In her memoir,  urlLink 'It Seemed Important at the Time,'  (Gloria)  Vanderbilt  writes about her four marriages and assorted flings.  "After her one-night stand with  Marlon Brando , he took his time calling her.

       A Little of the Old In and Out      In:   Crouching Stanley, Hidden Gangsta .  urlLink Ta-Nehisi's explanation  of  Stanley Crouch's   urlLink bitchslapping of milquetoast literary critic David Peck  in the  Village Voice  is instructive as well as amusing:  "This was not a moment of hot-headed indiscretion. Crouch may use his perch at the Daily News to inveigh against gangsta rap with all deliberate fury and alarm ('Hip  urlLink Hop's Thugs Hit New Low ,'  urlLink 'Hip Hop Gets The Bruising It Deserves ,' or 'Morally, Allen Iverson's a Bad Guy'), but his habit of violent exchanges with writers and editors puts him a notch above Snoop on the ne'er-do-well scale. In most cases gangsta rap is just talk—Biggie and Tupac are the exceptions. But while Crouch has yet to peel caps, the gangsta ethos is realer for him than it is for your average gun-talker.  "'The thing is that Stanley will get gangsta on you,' says  Nelson George , who worked with Crouch here at the Voice, in the 1980s. 'There is nothing more gangsta than just walking up and pimp-slapping someone. Not even punching them, just slapping them, almost as a sign of disrespect.'"  Just putting a touch of sting on the cheeks. Cupping the jawline. Brushing an errantr knave's ear with a limp backhand. A Palm extended to allow for maximum surface contact rushing, cleaving the air. Flesh-on-flesh percussion, a macabre symphony. It all sounds so cruel. Or so I'm told.  The receiver is brought low. His cheeks flush with that "homemade rouge." Most significantly" the speechless audience, who, breaking the silence, collectively utter the gutteral,  "oooooohhh."  Or so I'm told.  Truer words  have never been spoken  ( The Corsair  ruefully rubs his cheek, and stares with fish eyes at a picture of a smiling  Stanley Crouch ). And speaking of disrespect ...

Her gold tank watch rests loosely on her wrist; her favorable position on millennial-era cosmetic enhancements remains a matter of record. Were she to take up residence in the White House as first lady in a John Kerry administration, no one would expect her to fade into the chintz."   Out :  Clinton Sex Rants from Stuffy Democrats . There is something a bit creepy at the ferocity in which stuffy Dems  go after Clinton's sex life. Sure, he was a jerk, but why go after him like a rabid pit bull in an intellectual journal years after the fact? What? Hillary can forgive him but the NYRB can't?  It almost --  almost  -- gives off a faint scent of resentment ("How come that bastard got away with cheating and I've been trapped for decades ..") , or, at the very least least, a profound stuffiness that is alien to educated and socially sophisticated liberals that read the NYRB.  Gary Wills  in the August 12, 2004 New York Review of Books huffs like a schoolmarm:  "Clinton, like his mother, is a gambler. he does not, as she did, play the ponies. He dares the lightening. He knew he had numerous hunters and trackers circling about. He knew that he already had to cope with  Gennifer Flowers ,  Paula Jones  and  Kathleen Willey . The young woman he was adding to the list was not likely to be discreet-- she boasted of earning her presidential knee pads, and wrangled thirty-seven entrances to The White House, and snapped her thong, and preserved the candied semen. (DNA technology is still a comparatively young discipline, but it is not likely for some time to get a stranger excercise than testing testing the effluvia of presidential fellation.)"  The exceptional vocabulary aside, the eminent New York Review of Books, home of some of the most sophisticated minds of the last half century, really came off just now sounding like the exact opposite of its subscriber base.

       The Source in the Hour of the Wolf     According to  urlLink Jeff Bercovici at WWD  (2nd Item):  "The news at  urlLink The Source  continues to be the pits. A circulation audit released Monday shows the formerly hot hip-hop title missed its rate base for the 12 months ending June 30, 2003. The Source’s average circulation of 485,817 was 0.3 percent below its average rate base for the period of 487,500. After making rate base for four of six issues in the latter half of 2002,  The Source raised its circulation guarantee, to 500,000 from 475,000, causing it to miss rate base for five of the next six issues ."  Raising magazine circulation guarantee in the sluggish 2002 economy? bad move.  "The magazine, which sells more than two-thirds of its copies on newsstands, overstated single-copy sales for 11 of 12 issues by an average of 4.1 percent. The Source overreported its total circulation by 1.8 percent — just shy of the 2 percent mark that triggers automatic inclusion in the Audit Bureau of Circulation’s variance report. According to the magazine’s most recent publisher’s statement, The Source did make its rate base for second-half 2003 — by a scant 253 copies, a margin of 0.05 percent. But the statement itself was filed late to ABC, often a sign of trouble. Several calls to the magazine — which reportedly faces lawsuits from a slew of creditors over nonpayment — were not returned."

       The Assault Weapons Ban: Radioactive to Kerry?      urlLink  Patrick O'Connor  of TheHill  does an admirable job in untangling the web of issues surrounding the Assault Weapons Ban, which expires September 13th, and is bound to be a campaign issue in  Karl Rove's  crosshairs:    "Gun-control advocates say that Sen. John Kerry’s presidential campaign is divided about how vocal the senator should be in calling for the assault-weapons ban to be renewed. Kerry’s reluctance to mention the controversial issue on the campaign trail has agitated proponents of the ban.     "Sen. John Kerry’s campaign is running television commercials showing him hunting.     "Kerry supports the ban, and, earlier this year, he changed his campaign schedule to vote for it to be extended. But  urlLink some gun-control advocates  say he has not done enough.      "Asked if Kerry will highlight the issue in his campaign,  Blaine Rummel , a spokesman for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence said, 'There is some shiftiness.'     Not a good sign, surely ("... and don't call me, Shirley") as this feeds into the Republican characterization of Kerry as a flip-flopper. Further, Senators have glass jaws in the Presidential gladitorial fundament -- they are "legislative compromisers," and, the longer they linger in those aristocratic Senate corridors, the longer the record.       Karl Rove  knew what he was doing when he affixed the sobriquet "flip flopper." This politically lethal nickname is twofold poison: it erodes Kerry's support on the Left, by portraying him as not a stand-up guy, thus strengthening, however slightly, Nader; and, on the other hand, it weakens his efforts to gain a stronghold among moderates, who, by and large, favor mavericks like John McCain (who is the sole Senate exception as a "Senate lingerer" who is a straight talker) O'Connor continues:     " urlLink The 'issues' section of Kerry’s campaign website lists 15 topics , ranging from healthcare to homeland security to rural America. Gun matters are not listed."     "The (assault weapons) ban has been debated heavily since it was  urlLink enacted in 1994 by Congress at the request of then-President Bill Clinton . In 1996, the House voted to repeal the ban, and the current House GOP leadership will not move to renew the ban without consent from the White House. Bush supports extending the ban but has not urged Congress to act."     O'Connor notes that as Dems tiptoe around this radioactive issue in an election year, Clinton toom it on front and center on Monday's Democratic Convention speech in prime time. Ever protective of his legacy, Clinton said, "As gang violence is rising and we look for terrorists in our midst, Congress and the president are also about to allow the 10-year-old ban on assault weapons to expire."     O'Connor then notes:     "In his new book,  My Life , Clinton wrote that the 1994 vote to ban assault weapons came at a high political price, costing many House Democrats their seats in Congress. Gun-control advocates, who have consistently argued for years that gun control is a winning political issue, were somewhat exasperated by Clinton’s claims. The NRA has seized on Clinton’s words, highlighting them in recent newspaper ads. Clinton’s line of thinking has scared a number of congressional Democrats from the gun-control debate, Hummel said.     "The 2004 Democratic primary on guns is distinctly different from  urlLink the 2000 battle between former Vice President  Al Gore  and former Sen.  Bill Bradley  (N.J.) , Cox said, when both candidates made gun violence a major campaign issue. This election cycle, Kerry and former Vermont Gov.  Howard Dean  have attempted to reach out to voters who strongly support the Second Amendment."     While the  Jim Brady  campaign claims to have the votes in the Senate to extend the ban, and, "Sixty-four percent of gun-owning households and half of the NRA members polled were in favor of extending the ban, according to a recent poll conducted by the Annenberg Election Survey," it could be a potent election issue if done up right by the spinmeisters in rural swing states. This could be an especially effective strategy in the last days, where Kerry might be unable to respond to such an attack in time to make a difference.      Anyway, check out  urlLink Patrick O'Connor of TheHill 's thoughtful piece.

       A Little of The Old In and Out    In :  Sardinia , it's the new  urlLink East Sussex , but not quite Croatia, at least not yet. According to  urlLink Hello! Magazine :  "Oscar winner  Denzel Washington  took a break from promoting his latest film The Manchurian Candidate to relax in style at one of this summer's hottest celebrity locations the island of Sardinia.  "The Hollywood actor was joined by a familiar face during his boat cruise around Porto Cervo - Formula One boss Flavio Briatore. Famed for hosting his supermodel girlfriends, including  Naomi Campbell  and  Heidi Klum , on his yacht during previous Sardinia holidays, playboy Flavio owns the nearby Billionaire Club, an exclusive hideaway open only to the crème de la crème of the jet set.  "And there is no shortage of VIPs flocking to Sardinia, as demonstrated by the roster of big names who've visited the Mediterranean paradise just this year. Footballer  David Beckham  and the England squad held their Euro 2004 training on the Mediterranean island, while rap mogul  P Diddy  sailed in for his vacation on a £15-million yacht. The elite hotspot has also seen its share of romance, with  Rod Stewart  and Penny Lancaster spotted on a romantic holiday, and Christian Slater seen smoothing out his rocky relationship with wife Ryan Haddon with some passionate kisses."  This month,  Tony Blair  and his wife stayed in Sardinia with uber-sleazy media magnate cum Italian PM  Silvio Berlusconi ,  urlLink according to the Telegraph  (eeewww):  "After leaving Tuscany, the Blairs are due to travel to Sardinia for a two-day stay with Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister. From there they are expected to fly to Athens for the Olympic Games."   I hope the Blair had their shots  if they used any of Berlusconi's silverware. Tara urlLink  Reid may be flashing her newly purchased breasts in Sardinia , which is nice. What more could you ask for?  But, where to stay, true believer?  urlLink The New York Post suggests :  "A ... private spot is Cala di Volpe's sister site, the exclusive, whitewashed Hotel Pitrizza, where  Harrison Ford  stayed recently. Practically embedded in the jagged coast, it has a granite pool that seems to blend into the sea (from approximately $1,200; starwood.com).  "Also, check out  Peter Gabriel's  Li Capanni, the 20-room hotel where he got married. He opens its cottages and gardens to anyone who can afford the approximately $43,000 weekly hire charge (licapanni.com)."  Finally,  urlLink PM's Unik recently told Page Six , "(he's) joining  Lionel Richie  in Sardinia. He'll wind up in  urlLink Croatia , which he calls 'the next St.-Tropez  gorgeous, cheap and still undiscovered.'"   Out :  urlLink  Bill Clinton on Saturday Night Live   ?  (link via  urlLink Gawker ) According to the AP:  "Former President  Bill Clinton  could be a host of 'Saturday Night Live' this season. At least, that's what the folks at NBC are hoping.  "TV Guide Online quotes anonymous sources saying that Clinton has been offered the gig if he wants it.  "A decision is expected this week."  This might not be the best way to preserve a dignified Presidential legacy. Not a good sign, if this is true, that Clinton still hasn't decided.  The Corsair  is not a prude in any way shape or form, and he would love to see a short Clinton SNL skit, but a President shouldn't do any  extended  comedy riffs beyond the White House Correspondent's Dinner -- the acceptable forum for that. Clinton is not Al Sharpton, he shouldn't be carrying the show, he should be on DL diplomatic missions to the Middle East or Central Asia.   I'm just saying , I'm kind of conservative about what a President should ideally represent. And an ex-President shouldn't be doing Nat X or "Mongo" sketches, or  urlLink Chyna Doll bits .   In: Vanity Fair's Page Six Story.   urlLink According to FashionWeekDaily , Vanity Fair is doing a piece on the merry band of Sixers, past and present:  "Here's an update on  Frank DiGiacomos  first assignment for Vanity Fair. His all-encompassing look at the Manhattan gossip world has now apparently morphed into an 'oral history' of the New York Posts Page Six. DiGiacomo, who once worked at the column himself, has been interviewing employees past and present, including, of course, the now-infamous Ian Spiegelman, who, were told, has just sold his next book, partly on the strength of all the attention hes garnered since getting axed from the paper. DiGiacomo is also talking to competitors and those who have been burned by Page Six and still feel the pain. But don?t expect any scathing revelations about  Richard Johnson  -- he's too powerful a figure to mess with."   Out :  urlLink Matt Damon's Anxiety Baldness . Okay, maybe the  FlyOnTheWall  crowd is stretching for news -- lord knows I've dont that before -- but I'm fascinated by how gossipmongers make medical diagnoses on the flimsiest of paparazzi photos:  "The other day, one of the trades ran the photo below of  Matt Damon  fighting off an attempted liplock by  George Clooney  at The Bourne Supremacy premiere. The two strange bald patches in Damon's hair struck me as odd. They're not at the crown, where male pattern baldness starts, but instead down on the side a bit. Now if you saw a guy on the street with little bald spots like this, you'd think he had a bad haircut. But I can't imagine Damon gets a $3 trim at the barber school.  "So I forwarded a scan of the picture to a MD buddy and asked him what was up with Matt's locks. 'Definitely looks like some anxiety baldness,' my medical friend said. 'You're right; it's not male-pattern baldness because his crown is still full with good hair coverage. There doesn't appear to be any injury or scarring involved, either.' So I ask my doctor pal if this could get worse. 'It's impossible to tell without knowing his medical history,' he said. 'It's more likely he'll lose little clumps like this. It's extremely rare that all your hair falls out with anxiety baldness.'"  The funny thing is that in the  urlLink comments section, everybody  starts throwing down their own medical diagnosis. Favorites include: alopecia, which only adds to my assessment of Tinseltown, aside from being the world's capitol of litigation, the place where innocence gets seduced to a Chili Peppers soundtrack, is also a town with the world's highest concentration of hypocondriacs with an encyclopedic knowledge of the medical dictionary.  Like, is it possible that they are watching Matt Damon's hair too closely? Just a thought.

"But 'Today' had claimed a location close to the bus that was to convey Kerry and Edwards on their first cross-country campaign trip.  "According to witnesses, Gibson indicated the 'Today' site, scowled - and barked at a 'GMA' producer: 'We should be here.'"   The Corsiar  nibbles on a croissant, sipping coffee, reflecting on the irony of  Charlie Gibson's  statement, and its relevance to the  urlLink white hott ratings war  currently going on between  urlLink GMA and Today . Of course Charlie wants to be there, getting the rich smooth Today Show ad revenue cheddar.  "Around 8 a.m. the 'Today' team moved to an even closer location around 30 feet from the candidates' bus - smack-dab in the middle of their escape route - and Couric doffed her fashionable black pumps for greater mobility."   The Corsair  ducks, mouthing 'What the f-,' narrowly avoiding a Manolo Blahnik to the chops:  "'... Where are your shoes?' Edwards demanded.  "'I had to jump around to try to grab you guys,' Couric explained.  "Watching miserably, Gibson scorched his producers, 'This should have been us!' and then stormed off.  "The despondent 'GMA'-ers were spotted sulking beside their remote location.  "A few hours later, ABC News spokesman  Jeffrey Schneider  made no effort to spin (Grove). 'Gosh, that Katie - she's such a hustler,' he said, and I can only hope he meant that in the best sense."  don't hate the hustla, hate the ratings game ...

       NYTimes' Paul Krugman Versus CBS News' Jim Murphy     The Executive Producer of  CBS Evening News with Dan Rather ,  urlLink Jim Murphy , is getting a little punchy. And not punchy good, but punchy bad. Be very afraid. He's mad as hell and  urlLink he's not gonna take it anymore .  And it's not the first time with Murphy. Not hardly.  One would think that having reached the rarified air of network news, one might be above the fray, beyond getting into a spot of the old rough and tumble with the Op Ed Page of the Old Gray Lady. Upon achieving the sanctified grace of Network News, one might be inured to media violence, and thus immune to the slings and arrows of outrageous editorials. Uh-uh, you'd be wrong on that count, baby pop.  First, Murphy went punchy after  urlLink Howie Kurtz , with wide haymakers and low, inside body shots, saying,  slyly :  "The endless debate over how American politics are covered by domestic media gets another treatment in today's Howard Kurtz  urlLink column  in the Washington Post. And in the sidebar debate over television versus print as a source for comprehensive treatment, Howie comes down firmly on the side of print without ever saying so. But it's obvious in the subtext of Kurtz's report that he reached two conclusions from a selective viewing of the CBS Evening News reports about this year's issues called 'What Does It Mean To You?'"  Now, Murphy, 1-0, undefeated in the Chattering Class Smackdown (held daily in Romenesko Letters), sharpens his axe to grind, target:  Paul Krugman ; let the beatings begin, true believers. On July 30th Murphy wrote to  urlLink Romenesko's Letters :  "The entire staff of the 'CBS Evening News with Dan Rather' was pretty  miffed  after reading Paul Krugman's ( urlLink July 30th "Triumph of the Trivial" column ) that claimed not a SINGLE issues piece has aired on the big newscasts in the past two months."   Translation : At the Tiffany Network that day, we burned your column in effigy; much oxen was sacrificed to the Elder Gods over the flames, and much sweet meats and honey ale was consumed. Me alpha-man, hear me roar!  "(Krugman) must have missed the SIXTEEN different 'issues' pieces we did over a four week period during that time, part of a series that will continue until the election. With the resources of the New York Times you would think that would be kind of difficult to miss."   Translation : My boldface is bigger than yours. And, what's worse, you don't know how to use your, uhm,  resources .  "The Washington Post's media critic found the series so intriguing amid all the debate over campaign coverage he actually  urlLink wrote an article about it . How can anyone take an editorialist's arguments seriously when he ignores some FACTS completely?"   Translation : If Howie, my ex-nemesis is cool with it, then you must be blind.  On  urlLink Poynter  (2nd Item down), NY Timesman  Paul Krugman  responds in kind:  "In response to Jim Murphy's  urlLink comment  regarding my July 30 column on the absence of issue coverage in this election, and the 'miffed' staff at CBS Evening News ... Mr. Murphy apparently misread what I said."   Translation : Do you own a library card? Have you ever? Do you want me to help you with the big words?  "I did not say that there has been no issue reporting at all over the past two months; I said that issue coverage is very thin, and that there has in particular been no clear explanation of even the most basic elements of the Kerry health care plan.That statement is, alas, true."  Translation: The old Gray Lady may be a bit chubby in the backside, and CBS News may be, uhm, supermodel thin, but our readers like a little meat on the bone --  something to grab onto  ... ( The Corsair  imitates expressive Italian hand gestures to illustrate his point, mouthing the words, 'abondanza, abondanza'')  "The CBS evening news report from June 29 was the best coverage of the competing health care plans I could find."   Translation : Why can't we be friends? I'm a respected columnist, an intellectual even, I don't need this kind of shit.  "But did it explain that the Kerry plan would cover most of those now uninsured? No."   Translation : I am not averse to issuing a bitchslap if the occasion warrants. Remember executive producer boy, an animal is most dangerous when it is cornered ...  "Did it explain that the plan would, according to the Kerry campaign, be financed by a tax-cut rollback? No. In fact, by giving time to Bush claims that 'the Kerry plan would break the bank', without mentioning Kerry's plan to pay for it with a tax-cut rollback, the CBS report conveyed the false impression that the plan is unfunded pie in the sky."   Translation : Some constructive, diplomatic criticism, my media brother, let's work through this. "Bear in mind that this is not one among many issues: health care-cum-tax cut rollback is Kerry's signature domestic policy proposal. Yet a voter who gets his or her news from TV, even CBS with its 'issues' series, would have little or no idea of what Kerry is offering, or how it differs from Bush."  Translation: TV has it's uses, but print media is for the weighty analysis, that's how it was all divvied up in the beginning-- you get the big money, we get the prestige. Live with it.  Tune in next week, when Jim Murphy blasts any media critic (50-50 odds on an  urlLink Eric Alterman , Jim Murphy Smackdown up next) who dares --  dares!  -- criticize the CBS Evening News with Dan Rather.  Murphy dares you to smack the  urlLink Eveready battery off his shoulder  ... he dares you ...

       Is This The End of Cafe Society?     Could this be the last hurrah for Cafe Society as we know it?  urlLink Town and Country , arguably,  urlLink jumped the shark, or, rather, jumped the well tended Newport, Rhode Island rose garden , when they decided to put  John Travolta  on their cover a while back, instead of, say, oh --  urlLink Hubert de Givenchy , or  urlLink Philippe de Montebello  (Averted Gaze).  Has  urlLink celebrity  finally trumped discretion and the well-written holiday urlLink  note ? Class will tell ... (Averted Gaze)  Now,  urlLink The Page Sixers report , the fat lady has sung, or, at least,  urlLink Bobby Short's doing Gershwin at Cafe Carlisle , as alpha-debutante  urlLink Cornelia Guest  is pitches forth towards Tinseltown, forgoing the obligatory mansion on Long Island out of site from the main road:  " CORNELIA Guest  has packed up and moved back to Los Angeles. The daughter of The Post's late  urlLink gardening columnist C.Z. Guest , Cornelia, who was once named 'Debutante of the Decade,' has decided to try her elegantly manicured hand at acting. So far Guest, who does not have an agent, is doing very well all on her own. The blue-blooded blonde has scored a small part in an NBC pilot, 'Revelations,' done three independent films and is in discussions to have a one-off role on the FX hit, 'Nip/Tuck.'"  Ah, the pendulum swings, and, with the passing of CZ Guest, the debutantes fade. Charmed, I'm sure (Averted gaze).

       A Little of the Old In and Out   (Ed Note: Thanks Roe935 for clearing up the Laverne and Shirley issue.)     In:  urlLink Lucy Sykes .  According to  urlLink Fashionweekdaily , "Marie Claire editor-at-large  Lucy Sykes  is styling the Liz Lange fashion show at the Bryant Park tents this September."  See you in September, darling. ( The Corsair  blows the gal an air kiss) So, don't now say that I never offered anything nice about La  urlLink Sykes .  Tennis, anyone?     Out :  Catwoman . Or, as   urlLink Roger Friedman of Fox   says purr-fectly:  "The only movie really doing worse (than The Village), of course, is 'Catwoman,' a film that's clawed its way to the bottom. The  Halle Berry  starrer is a financial disaster of a magnitude that must have Warner Bros. in a frenzy. (The awful New York premiere must have been an omen.)  "'Catwoman' has a $135 million price tag. So far, though, it's taken in only $36 million domestically and about $1.5 million overseas."   Meow. The Corsair  still believes that  Sharon Stone  is the jinx of that minx, even though  urlLink Halle is accident prone . Sharon has stunk up more theaters than those buttery popcorn smelling ventilators.   In :  Hating X-Men director Bryan Singer . It's the new black. Hate on him, why don't you. Bryan may be an ass  urlLink that gets tossed off the studio lot , but, apparently, he is fun to dish on. According to  urlLink FlyOnTheWall :  "I got to see Singer in his full tyrannical glory a few years back when I was at post house to view a director friend's rough assemblage. (For you flyovers, a 'post house' is a post-production facility where sound work is done on a film; a 'rough assemblage' is a very rough first cut with only master shots.) I walked in the door of the normally quiet facility in Burbank and heard what sounded like a hoarse teenager screaming and crying in the distance. When I was escorted back to the appropriate screening room, I discovered the screeching teenager was none other than director Bryan Singer, standing on a chair in a mix room and screaming hoarsely at some poor post-production lackey for a minor oversight. Singer was in such a typhoon rage that his words were incomprehensible. But I'll never forget his face: red from crying as tears and snot poured down his puffy face to his quavering chin. He looked exactly like the overgrown baby that he is. Only in Hollywood."  Already posters are giving their favorite  urlLink "Hating Bryan Singer" stories here  in the comments section.  The Corsair  predicts that blogs are going to make it hard for Hollywood  divas  (and, their counterparts, " hevas ") to get away with all the shit and vinegar they have been getting away with all these years in relative obscurity, ignored by their buddies in the LA press corps.  The Corsair  cannot wait for an  Anonymous casting couch blog , dishing on Steven Segal and his ilk.   Out :  Vanity Fair . According to  urlLink Fashionweekdaily , "supermodel  Gisele  graces the October covers of both Esquire and Vanity Fair, the former being the magazine’s photo issue." So, uhm, I guess that means that since Gisele is from Brazil (but half German), that this could technically -- possibly, maybe -- count as a Latina cover for the alabaster VF? Hardly. Not "in," but  urlLink out, damn VF .   In :  Stalking Kevin Bacon . Question: Do you ever dream about trapping Kevin Bacon in a dungeon and watching him do the Footloose dances over and over, just for your amusement? No? It's just me?   Anyhoo: First , there was  urlLink Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon . The Game. And then it wasn't enough. It. Wasn't. Hardly. Enough. We Needed more Kevin; the bacon wasn't sizzling. ( The Corsair  breaks into a cold sweat, sharpens a meat cleaver).  You don't know what it's like to be a Kevin Bacon fan , dude. You. Don't. Know.  Sometimes ... when I'm in a Diner late at night. Like: 3AM. And the waitress wants to refill my cup of Joe for, like, the tenth cup. And she's walking really slowly, so as not to distract me from my Guns and Ammo magazine. I ask for eggs and bacon, abruptly, loudly, just to keep her off balance. And when she wants to know how I want the bacon ... I tell her Kevin, get it,  Kevin Bacon  ... (The Corsair suddenly and abruptly breaks into a very loose imitation of  urlLink Kevin Bacon's Footloose dance .  And now, ( The Corsair  pants audibly) the great  urlLink Gawker  (take it easy,   urlLink Choire  ) has provided our  prey,   urlLink like a Nabokovean butterfly, mounted ... I mean our Bacon fix;  tee-hee :  "Saw Kevin Bacon AGAIN (I see him all the time because he lives a few blocks away) this morning, first standing on his apartment building steps peering out like a beacon of light…then following me into the subway (of course he was following me). I proceeded to stalk him into the car he was riding on but pretended I wasn’t interested. He was wearing black sweatpants with a green stripe, nicely accessorized with a well worn green Eagles baseball hat and a black t-shirt and sneaks. He wore his sunglasses and was reading the NY Times the whole time. I watched the other subway riders with amusement to see if they noticed it was him. I think a few were a little startled out of their morning stupor but no one bothered him. He is cute but a rather ordinary, if vaguely hip, guy. I got out in Midtown but he continued on…I wondered if he was going downtown to look at apartments because I saw in the NY Post that he might be looking to move out of the neighborhood (sob)!"  Then, the stalker reports go to briefly  Nathan Lane , but quickly, justly, return to fixate on Our Kevy:  "Nathan Lane at Café Fiorello in front of Lincoln Center having an early dinner with a friend before his performance of The Frogs. Also,  Kevin Bacon  walking on the Upper West Side with a dreadlock headed boy."  Dreadlock freak terrorizes Gotham! ( The Corsair  whips up a frenzy) ... wait till they get a load of me.

       LaToya Jackson Undergoes Name Surgery    urlLink MSNBC reports  that  LaToya Jackson  has changed her name to "Toy":  "This week, the buoyant 'Just Wanna Dance' (JaTail Records) by Toy climbs two notches on the chart to No. 14.  “'It feels good to be back,' Toy Jackson told Billboard. 'With this single, I wanted people to judge the song on its own merit.'  "Jackson fully understands that her name comes with much baggage, good and bad. 'People weren’t giving me the chance to do my thing, which is to sing,' she said. 'So, I altered my name for this single to see what would happen.'”  But on the horizon of contemporary music there have been hints, as in her "hit" "Sex Box (the orignial mix, silly, without full force rap), she croons, rather humidly, "Last night laying in the bed/Thinking and dreaming of you/Real tight, holding on my hand,Thinking of what I had to do/Here I am, like  a toy /Now your gonna play with me/Hey you! Come boy, Give me what you think I need"  Which, of course, begs the question, is Toy her name ... or her function? ( The Corsair  wags his eyebrows like  urlLink Groucho Marx )

       Barbra Streisand: The Bloviator     I know I should like  urlLink Barbra Streisand , former lover of the embattled  urlLink Don Johnson , as it was her donation to  urlLink The Nation Magazine  that allowed me to intern at that Magazine straight out of college with a nice little stipend to get me through the week. I should feel all warm and fuzzy and full of gish darn gratitude. And, damn, that extra beer money helped me slough through the Summer of 1995. But, Goddam, is she a bloviator or what?  According to  urlLink The National Enquirer , that significant cultural artifact:  "Furious over Barbra Streisand's outrageous demands after they asked her to speak at the Democratic National Convention, organizers rebelled and yelled: 'Streisand . . . STAY HOME!'"   The Corsair  heartily agrees.  "Snarled one insider: 'She was a nightmare!' La Streisand delivered a typewritten list of demands that blah-blah-ed on for pages about makeup artists . . . hairdressers . . . a fleet of limos . . . hotel suites for the star's entourage and a small army of private bodyguards . . . etc. In addition, say sources, she ordered Dems to hire extra guards for her protection and (here's my favorite!) even dictated strict security demands to the FBI! Topping it all off, party 'loyalist' Streisand refused to pony up a penny toward the staggering bill -- insisting that the tab be paid by campaign contributions from ordinary Americans! Seething party bosses told the singer through clenched teeth: 'Thanks . . . but no thanks!' Now Streisand's fibbing to pals that she couldn't attend the convention because she's working on 'Meet the Fockers' -- but sources say her scenes were shot long before the opening gavel banged!"  But that is nothing compared to the 4-page bio on  urlLink her shameless web site , which bloviates at Wagnerian length about, among other things, her "honorary degree from Brandeis," and:  "Ms. Streisand's feelings about the rights and obligations of artists to participate in the political process were brought into sharp focus by her early  urlLink 1995 speech at Harvard University  under the sponsorship of the John F. Kennedy School of Government. The address won unprecedented reportage and reproduction in such print media as the New York Times and the Washington Post. It was carried a record number of times on C-SPAN and is included in Senator Robert Torricelli's book, 'In Our Words: The American Century,' a collection of important speeches of the 20th century."  This may in fact be a first, people: not only is Babs' site bragging about being her "The Artist as Citizen"(a speech written by  urlLink Kerry's consigliere Bob Shrum  and touched up by Peter Jennings) being carried a record number of times on C-Span, a dubious distinction at best, but, further, the site bloviates about being included in a collection of important speeches of the 20th century, edited by  urlLink Robert "I'm Sorry" Toricelli .  Granted, lyrical stylings like "Love soft as an easy chair/Love fresh as the morning air," do not  urlLink a Holderlin  make, but if she's going to be so in-your-face about her left politics, she could at least frame it in such a way that it does not call attention to how many fucking diva perks she needs.

       Deadbeat ... Looking For a Deadbeat      urlLink  Embattled actor Don Johnson   ,  who played  urlLink Sonny Crockett , the alagator pet-owning rough-edged pastel wearing sailboat living cop,   may soon be singing  urlLink The Smuggler's Blues  with Johnny Law himself if he doesn't pony up some dinero for his unpaid shopping bills, according to  urlLink the Beeb :  "A judge has ordered Hollywood actor Don Johnson to pay an unpaid shopping bill of nearly $5,500.  "Pitkin County District  Judge Erin Fernandez-Ely  said Johnson must pay $5,470 ... for the overdue balance at Clark's Market.  "The judge also ordered Mr Johnson to pay $426.85 in interest to the grocery store in Aspen, Colorado."  Although the former icon has put his Aspen 17 acre ranch for sale,  urlLink The Aspen Daily News writes : " Tom Clark , president of the valley-based, nine-store chain, said it's doubtful he'll extend the former 'Miami Vice' star a line of credit in the future, even if he satisfies his tab. Clark's had given Johnson a line of credit since 1989, but last year his bill went unpaid, and he had been in default since September, according to court papers.  "'We're dealing with somebody who at one time was very credit worthy and obviously a very successful actor and a very successful businessman, and really, it's sad,' Clark said. 'It's sad for anybody who's successful but can no longer pay their bills. This was not a fun thing to do, and hopefully I'll never have to do it again.'"  Pay the bill, Sonny, or,  urlLink you belong to the city , Don, the city of Aspen's penitentiary.  Comment here or  urlLink VH1's BWE Blog
