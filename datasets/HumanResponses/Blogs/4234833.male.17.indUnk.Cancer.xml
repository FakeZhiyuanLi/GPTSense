      First, you have to start with good soil. Look for a rich organic blend such as Garden-Ville potting soil. It’s made from compost, Canadian peat moss, perlite, orange sand, cedar flakes and other ingredients. I’m not crazy about cedar flakes because they take up nitrogen to decompose, but the level is low. They also help provide drainage and aeration. Look for a good local brand of store-bought organic soil. The water from Amarillo comes from Lake Meredith (60%) and groundwater (40%). Amarillo is in farm country, and farm chemicals and fertilizers could leave the water tainted. Request a water analysis from your local water district (to determine the pH) and a list of dissolved solids in the water. If the level of sodium is more than 50 ppm and the total dissolved solids level is more than 300 ppm, you should treat the water with reverse osmosis to remove dissolved salts. The pH should be between 6 and 7 for good nutrient uptake. There are many good organic fertilizers to use. A partial list includes Canna, Earth Juice, Fox Farm and Formula X. Use the fertilizers as directed for seedling, vegetative and flowering growth. You should also purchase a biostimulant to increase fertilizer uptake and soil life. Biostimulants often contain humic acid, fulvic acid, trichoderma, and a host of good microbes and bacteria that promote growth. Many companies carry biostimulants. Vegetative plants need a full range of macronutrients and micronutrients and use a lot of nitrogen, which washes out of the soil quickly and must be replaced regularly. Some strains, such as Sweet Tooth and Big Bud, are incredibly easy to grow and can take high doses of fertilizer. Change to flowering fertilizer a few days after turning the light to a 12/12 day/night schedule. Flowering fertilizer should contain higher levels of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) and less nitrogen (N). Adding an additional PK 13-14 supplement for the last four weeks before harvest will swell buds to a nice, tight, compact mass.

      Urine Constituents  Urinalysis is one of the most powerful diagnostic tools used in the medical field today. Hundreds of tests can be performed on individual urine to determine the condition of the donor. Urine contains thousands of different types of compounds. It is literally the aqueous trash of the body. A cup of coffee has over ten thousand compounds alone. Drug testing laboratories have narrowed the choice down to two or three tests for determination of a suitable sample. If the urine sample falls out of the parameters the sample will be labeled "too dilute, unsuitable, or adulterated" depending on which parameter is incorrect. pH - is a relative measure of acidity or basically, with a range of 0-14. In the middle is 7.0 which is considered neutral. Acids have low pHs usually less than 1. Bases, such as bleach have high pHs around 10.5. Urine samples must have a pH in the range of 4.5 - 9.0. Both acids and bases will destroy drug metabolites, so the labs check to see if any are present. If a chemical additive is used, it should leave the pH relatively unchanged, within the 4.5 - 9.0 ranges. Specific Gravity (SG) - is a fancy word for density. Simply drinking tons of water can fool a drug test. By measuring the SG a lab can detect if the donor is trying to beat a drug test by dilution. If the sample is too dilute, the SG of the urine sample will be below 1.005 g/ml. A lab result like this might come back as inclusive; test not performed, or sample too dilute. It is against the law to fail an individual for providing sample(s) which are too dilute. On the flip side of the coin is high density. If a sample has a density above 1.020 g/ml, then an additive has been used. It is considered proof of adulteration if the SG is at this level and is legal to fail an individual for having a SG above 1.020 g/ml. Creatinine - is a measure of kidney functions to determine how dilute or concentrated a urine sample is. The creatinine has to be below 20 mg/dl for the sample to be considered too dilute. Creatinine levels above the 20 mg/dl are considered acceptable. Creatinine is found in all muscle tissue and originally begins as creatine. Creatine passes through the body in two ways. First is consumption as it is found in all types of meat. The second is production by the body. As muscles are broken down and rebuilt creatine is converted creatinine. Creatinine in high levels is toxic, and so the kidneys filter out the creatinine from the blood and pass it on to the bladder. Creatinine extraction from the blood is at a very constant rate and the level in the urine is constant varying only with the length between urinations. Therefore creatinine levels less than 20 mg/dl indicate a bladder which is continually being emptied in an attempt to pass a drug test. Labs sometimes look at other constituents of urine with a ten-panel dipstick called a multistick. The ten tests on the multistick are: 1. Leukocytes2. Nitrite3. Urobilinogen4. Protein5. pH6. Blood7. Specific Gravity8. Ketone9. Bilirubin10. Glucose

      How Does Drug Testing Work?  Most drug testing is broken down into two categories, urine testing or urinalysis and hair testing. The labs are not looking for drugs in urine samples; they are looking for drug metabolites. Once the body takes in a substance, the end product looks much different, once it passes through. Alcohol goes in as beer, gets oxidized by the liver, and comes out as water. Drugs go in the body in the psychedelic form and come out as a metabolite. The psychoactive ingredient in marijuana is 11-nor-D-9-tetrahyrocanibinol (THC). This is oxidized by the body and comes out as 31 different metabolites. The most prevalent form is 11-nor-D-9-tetrahyrocanibinolic acid (THCA). Marijuana is passed from the lungs to the blood stream, and while the drug is freely floating in the body in sufficient quantity a high is felt. Marijuana is liposoluble, meaning it absorbs into fat cells. The drug is stored in the fat cells indefinitely untill the body burns the fat cells for energy. When the cell is burned, the drug is metabolized and released back into the blood stream. This is why marijuana can be detected for 30 days after a substantial usage. Urinalysis is typically separated into two separate sections, the drug screen and the drug test or confirmation. There is a huge difference between a drug screen (EMIT) and a drug test. Most drug testing procedures utilize a drug screen and test (GC/MS). However, some employers or institutions in an attempt to cut costs will only use drug screens. The screen is always performed first and is usually followed by a test or confirmation. Drug Testing is broken down in the following percentages: Hair Testing -- 5% Screen with GC/MS -- 80% Screen Only -- 5% FPIA (Screen) -- 5% · GC/MS = Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry · Screen = EMIT - Enzyme Multiplied Immunoassay Test (Trade name for the most popular screen used in drug testing field manufactured by Dade Behring ) · FPIA = Florescence Polarization Immunoassay - Abbott Labs version of a screen D.O.T - a DOT test is the abbreviation for a Department of Transportation. This means the testing guidelines have been regulated by the DOT, and if the guidelines are not followed the results are considered invalid. Not all tests are DOT regulated, but most are. To make the testing process easier companies follow the DOT guidelines to minimize mistakes. The first test for the DOT is a five panel EMIT. The cut off for marijuana on the screen is 50 ng/ml, which is a composite of all 31 metabolite concentrations. If the sample is below this level the test is over as a passing status. If the sample is over 50 ng/ml the sample is sent on to a GC/MS for confirmation. The cutoff for the confirmation is lower at 15 ng/ml because the machine only identifies one of the 31 metabolites which is the 11-nor-D-9-tetrahyrocanibinolic acid. To pass, the one metabolite must be below the 15-ng/ml cutoff. Urine LuckTM works best on DOT tests which utilize a GC/. The chart below summarizes five drugs of abuse found on the screen. Drug # of Metabolites EMIT cut off GC/MS cut off Marijuana 31 50 ng/ml 15 ng/ml Cocaine 4 300 ng/ml 150 ng/ml Opiates 3 2000 ng/ml 2000 ng/ml Phencyclidine 1 25 ng/ml 25ng/ml Amphetamines 5 1000 ng/ml 500 ng/ml DOT tests are the hardest test to pass if the donor does not use a detoxifying product. However, if a detoxifying product is used, the DOT is the easiest test pass. Each type of detoxifying product works via a unique mechanism on drug tests. Refer to the product sections of this report for the mechanism information and explanation. Guidelines for the DOT test procedures, reporting, and adulteration, can be found on the Department of Health and Human Services or the Department of Transportation web page at Blood Test - Often people will be given a blood test and a urinalysis. These are for two totally different types of tests being performed. Blood is normally drawn for detection of diseases such as AIDS. Drug toxins can only be detected for 48 hours in the blood after consumption. For this reason the urine is tested for toxins instead of the blood. Hair Tests - Toxins are circulated throughout the body via the blood stream. The blood feeds the hair while it is in the growth stage at the scalp. As the hair is formed the toxins are trapped inside the hair folic. The toxins then grow away from the scalp as time passes. If the use of toxins is stopped, the hair by the scalp is clean, but the middle of the hair or ends of hair will retain the toxins until cut off. The level of toxins is greatest near the scalp. Sunlight and chemicals added to the hair in dyes or shampoos will oxidize the drug metabolites over years, and can reduce the level of metabolites by 75%. For this reason, the hair sample is clipped from the back neck (nape) near the scalp by the examiner. Once sent to a laboratory the hair is dissolved with organic solvents. Once in a liquid solution, the toxins are freed from within the hair follicle. Extraction is performed on the liquid and drug toxins are removed. Once the drug metabolites are isolated a GC/MS is performed with urinalysis testing and quantitative level is provided.

      We need to legalize marijuana. Hard drugs like alcohol and cigarrets are legal but an ancient plant like marijuana is illegal. Where is the common sense of the lawmakers. Marijuana makes you feel calm and collective, alcohol makes you fell violent and jumpy and you never hear crashed while stoned almost always while junk you can die drinkin to much but most likely you cant die from smokein to much weed but drinking legal.

      MEDICAL MARIJUANA UPDATE Bush declares War on Pot, researchers sue feds, and Schwarzenegger vetoes a medical marijuana bill in California. 2004-07-28     >> news category        >> medical news  Story by Mark Miller In the same week the Bush administration declared a new “war on soft drugs” (re: cannabis), there were two stories linked to the continuing resistance to medical marijuana by both the federal government and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. On July 21, in Washington, DC, a pair of federal lawsuits were filed on by medical marijuana researchers charging the DEA, HHS, NIH and NIDA with obstructing medical marijuana research in violation of federal law. The suits were filed by Lyle Craker, director of the Medicinal Plant Program at the University of Massachusetts—Amherst, Rick Doblin, president of the Multidisciplinary Alliance for Medical Marijuana (MAPS) and Valerie Corral co-founder of the Wo/Men’s Alliance for Medical Marijuana (WAMM). Doblin and MAPS approached Craker in 2001 about providing 25 pounds of medical cannabis for federally approved researchers, but he has been unable to receive approval from the DEA. “We want to be able to supply medical personnel with a high quality material with a known level of bioactive ingredients for clinical studies,” says Cracker. “We’ve cooperated with the DEA to make sure all [cannabis] materials are accounted for and all waste materials would be incinerated. The suit is to force the DEA to make a decision on the matter. They had enough time. They previously said they’d decide in six weeks, but that time has passed. It’s time to make a decision.” At least the DEA is consistent. On July 20, in Sacramento, CA, Gov. Schwarzenegger, who declared that he supported medical marijuana when running for office, vetoed SB-1494, the bill sponsored by state Senator John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara). SB 1494 was intended to “clean up” misconceptions in the language of a previous medical marijuana bill, SB-420, which was passed in 2003 but not implemented into law. “I was dismayed and astonished that Schwarzenegger vetoed the bill,” Sen. Vasconcellos explains. “The governor indicated he would implement SB-420. What he said in his veto wasn’t true, that this [SB 1494] changes the rule as to how much marijuana a patient can have.” In that veto message, Schwarzenegger mistakenly stated that SB 1494 violated SB 420, when in fact it was meant to clarify the issue after SB 420 contained sloppy legislative language when it was rushed into passage. “Enactment of the bill would create uncertainty in this area of the law, thereby making it more difficult for law enforcement to determine when a person was in possession of marijuana for medicinal purposes,” the governor wrote. Schwarzenegger’s veto seems to indicate that he’s aligned with the “hardliners” as Sen. Vasconcellos described them, those that maintain that SB-420 violates the state constitution. The senator says 1494 was to confirm that the path of SB-420 was not at the expense of the constitutional rights of those who were granted relief of prosecution under Prop 215 (which legalized medical marijuana in California in 1996). “The budget issue in California has the governor preoccupied. After that’s resolved, I’m going to approach him and ask if he realizes his error and if he will sign the bill,” Vasconcellos promises.

      The crip is a street gang which originated in Los Angeles, Califorina Stan Tookie Williams stared the gang in the late 1960s during the early 1970s the gang grew and branched out to other parts of LA county. these new subsidiaey or realigned existing gangs were known as sets and they used the term crips in thier individual gang name. Origanally, most crips activity took place on or around school campus and these gangs created a reputation for violence and extrottion. Although a predominately gangs in most areas across the nation, many others ethnic groups have adopted the crips names cuz of the on going notoriety of the crips their rivals, the Bloodz. The crips usually indentify with the color blue in several different shades . Crips refer to each other a cuzz and use the letter c to replace the letter b in their conversations and writings  they started graffi on walls which mark their paricular territal boundaries also hand signals flashings displaying thier color. They seldom wear tatoos and thier graffi represents the past or future gang ativity. Crips gang are found in nearly every city in the US. The most prominent traits of crips are individuaslim and maintining a commitment to foster violence upon other gangs the crips rivalry with the bloodz gangspresents a likelihood of violent encounters betewwn members. Should the crips ever become more structured they could present evenmor serious problems than ceated by other recognized gangs in prison> Despite their temorary claim of being a peaceful organization the gang is still heavily involved in urban warfare drug sales and recently violent take over robberies and warehouse burglaries.

      The Bloods formed from the Piru gang on 1972 at Centennial High School, taking the Piru Bloods name from "Piru" street in Compton, California. The group formed to protect members from the Crips. Other gangs with the same motive started using the Pirus’ and Bloods’ names to signify alignment with the main gang. Although the Bloods’ membership is smaller than the Crips, they are potentially more dangerous, particularly when present in numbers.They most often identify with the color red. West coast gang members often use a red bandana and while on the East Coast they use red colored beads. They will also use various graphic styles and terms emphasizing a disrespect for Crips.Although many of the group’s traditional trademarks and identifiers have remained the same, their allies and enemies change drastically depending on their geographic location. There have been several occasions in which the Crips and Bloods have aligned with other gangs for a common cause or goal. They are currently aligning with the Black Gangster Disciples and Black Guerilla Family.The Bloods present a significant threat to law enforcement officers not only due to their predatory and violent behavior, but more importantly, due to their intense rivalry with the Crips. Both the Crips and the Bloods have a strong fascination with assault-type weapons.
