       people can be so rude? I have two jobs, one of them I do during the weekends. It's a cleaning job at the airport. It's not the most fun and challenging job in the world but it's ok to do once in a while for some extra money.  So while I was cleaning the bathrooms, this man and woman comes in. I was blocking two of the bathrooms with the wagon where all the cleaning stuff are so no one would pass. The man asks if he can use one of the bathrooms I'm cleaning but since I just cleaned the floors I told him no. Then, instead of waiting like everyone else, he says, it'll be quick, and goes into one of the bathrooms anyway. So when he comes back outside, I have do clean the floor all over again and wait even longer to be able to do the next thing on my list. It's so disrespectful!  So, to whomever might read this, if someone is cleaning, ask nicely if you can use the bathroom or whatever it might be, and if no, please wait like everyone else. I so can't wait till I don't have to work with this anymore!

       I'm on a three week holiday but since I'm going to Singapore, the Fijis and Australia I need all the money I can get, I'm working at the airport outside Gothenburg. I haven't even saved half of what I need and I'm leaving in January! It's a bit of a rush! Luckily I'm getting a tax return next month. After that I will need to save at least 3000kr a month! It's a lot but I know it will be worth it x 10. I can't wait till I'm sitting on the airplane on my way.

       I started a diary a while ago on a normal website but then my dear friend Melody has her blog on this website so I thought I'd give it a try. I might be as bad at posting it this time too but I'll try and write at least once a week. Since I'm going on a trip in January, this place might be good to put down experience and thoughts from that trip as well.

       If you died in a car accident and someone else needs a new heart to survive, would you want this person to have yours? I had a discussion about this with a woman at work. I would definitely want to give my kidney, heart or lungs in order to rescue someone else's life while she said no because she wanted to be buried in one piece. I can see where she is coming from but the fact that she could not understand my point of view makes it harder for me wanting to understand hers. If you can not do this for another person, how can you expect someone to do it for you? Just a thought.

       I wish my English was better so I could express myself more. I know I could write in Swedish but it's not as challaging as in English...

       The girls I used to hang out with are now acting like 14 year olds. Last week when we were sitting at the same table during lunch the two of them (Nina is still on holiday) were sitting ad whispering to each other. Giggling! Around them I feel so old and yet I'm 5 years younger then them! I now sit on another table in protest. Monica is always very sweet, but not around Jenny, then she is not a nice person. But yesterday Jenny went home because she did not feel well and after her leaving, Monica is nice again. It's weird! How come people behave like that?

       So I am. Although I've been home since last Friday afternoon, just been busy enjoying the last couple of days hanging out with friends before I start working again. On Saturday I hung out with a girl from Romania, Bianca. We went shopping, or should I say, she was the one doing most of the shopping. I only bought a journal for myself and a friend. And a spray for my hair to put in it before I use the flat iron. It was a great day. We went on a boat that takes us around the channels and the harbor in Gothenburg while a guide tells us the history of buildings and boats. It was a very hot day but very much needed since all it has been doing for two months is raining.  Visiting my parents for two days was very nice. It feels good coming home. It's a different feeling being there. There is no stress like it is in the city. And it's also having my cat around. He's the sweetest cat ever!  So on Monday I got back to work, this week we all started to work @ 6.45am! Waaaay too early! I'm so happy I normally work evenings.    Going back to work was also hard in another way. There are three "women" who I hang out with, at least before the holidays. They are very into sex. They talk about it all the time! Various positions, breasts etc etc. To me it's such and intimate thing, I'd hardly share it with anyone else but my boyfriend (not that I have one!)! I now try to avoid them a bit so I don't have to listen to it all the time. I've even heard someone at work saying she thinks it's disgusting. I'm not prude but I think it's going too far sometimes. What is your opinion?    By the way, there are also other reasons why I'm trying to avoid those women but I'm not going to write about it at the moment. Another time.
