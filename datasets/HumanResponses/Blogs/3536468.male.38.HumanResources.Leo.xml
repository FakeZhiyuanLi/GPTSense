						   I chatted yesterday with a guy from Eindhoven, Netherlands.   It was sort of a chance meeting as he thought I was someone else, we chatted for an hour anyway.   Then another hour today.   Strange I wonder what that means?    I haven't bothered with online strangers in about 5-6 years since I stopped using  urlLink ICQ .  I think it was one of the best IM clients made, at least the first to take off and you have to give them props for that.  Recently I found  urlLink Miranda  now that is one cool IM client.  In one application you have MSN IM, ICQ, AIM, and Yahoo IM.   No need to run multiple apps!!!   The only drawback is that currently some of the "advanced features" of the various clients are not implemented but it is  urlLink open source so you have to like that.   I'm currently reading  urlLink The Cluetrain Manifesto  in fact is one of the reasons I started this blog.  At least I think it is?   Who really knows why we do what we do?  Especially when what we do seems meaningless.   A friend asked me yesterday why I was doing this I mumbled something like "to be heard".   Who really knows?  I'm still looking for the "right" skin.   I'd like to know if even one person read this written spew.

						   Well I tried an experiment last night.   After seeing all of the commercials on TV/Magazines/Radio I finally decided to try "Chaser" hangover prevention pills.   Well I thought they failed, not miserably perhaps but they didn't seem to prevent a "hangover."  Of course I've never been able to predict my hangovers with any accuracy.  Usually I have no noticeable hangover problem with 4-5 drinks.   I probably drink entirely too much but that's another story.   After 5 drinks it's hard to count and certainly 8-12 will have me ruined the next day.   I had about 6-7 beers last night and do have a headache now :(  I suppose I should have taken more than the 2 tabs as advised, they suggest a second 2 tab dose after 3-4 beers, but I figured what the heck, besides I didn't go back to the party store to get more.   I'm going to ask around and perhaps try them again and follow the directions on the label.  Oh well life goes on....

						   I realized that my " urlLink first post " was too boring and too little and will probably lose more readers than it gathers I thought you deserved to learn more.....  My kids play the game "Who am I" so here you go --  I'm a 37 yr old male  two kids (girls)  master's degree  14 year marriage  Mid-West born and raised -- Michigan actually   urlLink Politically Libertarian   successful at least in earning money by working two to four hours a day hoping  urlLink not to get fired  so I've already read that one...and I don't yet own a picture phone so  urlLink getting canned over like this poor schmuck is not likely.   nonetheless I am using a  urlLink pseudonym  mostly because I don't know what I want to do with this blog yet, I may confess some things that family, friends, employers don't want or need to learn about  Spare time -- When I'm not playing with my girls I love to play video games and have since my first Atari, I laid off games in the mid-80s during college but started again once I got married and started working  I built a "family" website in 1997 and didn't really update it much after 1999, probably will again, but the thrill wore off at that time.  Probably the most "tech" person I know who   DOES NOT   work in IT at all.

						   Hopefully not the last post but I thought maybe I could or should give this gimmick a try.  I'm not really sure where I will go or even if I will keep this blog alive, wonder what happens if it goes "inactive" and I no longer post here?  I guess I could search help but I'm feeling a bit lazy...  Anyway TTFN
