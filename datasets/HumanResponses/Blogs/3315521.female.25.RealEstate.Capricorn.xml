      Hullo all you imaginary people out there in lala land!

So sorry not to have written but I have spent the last few days at a conference for work and simply didn't have net access, but I am almost certain you will get over it.

Can't remember if I told you or not but decided on the name 'Precious' for the birdy coz that is how I keep describing her.

My brothers engagement part  was last weekend and that was just wonderful. A very fun night had by all!

I have enrolled myself in a novice auctioneers competition, I am starting later than the other competitors which could be seen as a negative but I am choosing to look at it as a positive, see, they should do much better than me having had heaps of practice, so really, very little is expected of me and anything as a matter of fact will be a bloody big bonus Ha!

I decided after hearing all about this 'Save Karyn' chick that I should read her book, well now I am totally hooked. It is a great read and I can really identify with her, she is just so funny. I also admire her writing skills, she is very clever.

I am definitely over my 'downer' and although I am still stressed I am attempting to take affirmative action. Will talk more about that tomorrow though,for now it is time for me to go home and keep reading. I love this book, go and buy it and read it!

      Hullo there,

Am over my downer now...I think. Although I am still having heaps of trouble sleeping which really gives me the shits! I love my sleep and not getting enough is making me feel so much worse. Just increddibly restless, I think it is because I am soooo stressed about my financial situation that I just can't relax. Blergh!!!!
I bought a cockatiel yesterday, she is just darling, eight weeks old and I am in the process of hand taming her. The dog is not too sure about her but hopefully they will get used to each other, my boyfriend has really taken to her which has really surprised me, I have sooo much to learn about her but she has really got me. I really wanted another dog after having to recently rehome my beautiful Lab X. But I also had to be realistic and realise that with working the hours I do, I can't possibly give a dog the attention and excersise it needs and deserves, so I discussed the options with my partner who undertands that having a pet really helps me to unwind and feel less stressed out, and they really do cheer you up when you're feeling down. So we went through the options, a cat was out of the question as my other half is allergic, we have a small stray living under the house and she is simply gorgeous, I feed her every night and give her lots of cuddles before bedtime. When we first moved in she looked near to death, but with a little TLC, she is now just beautiful, anyway, next on the list was a rabbit, I came very close to having a rabbit but then one of the girls I work with said that they have a habbit of carking it, so I decided against that. Well then there were birds. At first I was pretty unsure...'Was I really a BIRD person?' Well I surfed the web, did some research and visited some pet shops, one I found was a 'World for Birds' store, well I was taken from that moment on. I really wanted a rainbow lorikeet, they seemed so playful and vocal, but also incredibly expensive, then the lady at the store told me about cockatiels and introduced me to my new baby, only 8 weeks old - can you believe it. She is just too adorable. She is grey, with rosy cheeks and two yellow stripes down the back of her head. She is not fully tamed yet but is not biting much (she really latched on to start with and even drew blood a couple of times) now she is happy to sit on my shoulder while I wander around the house, she seems to like the sound of me brushing my teeth but hisses at the hair brush. I haven't named her yet as I want to see what her personality is like and find a name that suits. I keep calling her a 'she' because although without DNA testing you can't tell what sex they are until they mature, the lady at the pet store said she appeared to be female. Anyway, I won't bore you any longer. I have to get back to work. My brothers engagement is tomorrow night and although I am totally excited and happy for him I am also a little jelous too. My boyfriend and I have been together nearly 4 years, and still no diamond to flash around, my brother and fiance have been together meerly months, he is such a romantic soul. Ah well, what will be will be I suppose.

      Hi all,

Sorry I haven't posted but have been off work 'sicky'. A bit hard to explain to work that I haven't slept in two days coz of my anxiety attacks. So much easier to simply say I am not well and get some 'at home' time. I spent yesterday mostly just cleaning the house. I am having one of my bad weeks, I know they pass but at the time it feels as though it will never go away, that you will always feel low and detached from everything around you forever, and as you start thinking these thoughts, the thoughts turn to actions you need to take. When this first happened I left my partner of 3 years telling him that I didn't think I loved him any more. Not true. Of course I loved him, still do, and I am lucky enough to still have him, he has been the strong one through all of this. Never judging me or getting angry, and that's not easy as a partner, because there is no way they could possibly understand what you are going through. I would not have understood until now, until after the fact. So when I get like this I hate it because I know that 99% of my time is spent totally loving him but then when I get like this and feel so distant, my mind questions if I really love him, it simply tears me in two. I wouldn't swap him in a million years (plus, I nearly have him trained, not going through THAT agin!!!) Just kidding. Anyway, feeling utterly miserable at the moment, partly starting to feel better though after cleaning up the main areas of the house. I do not plan to stay at work all day today. I know that that sounds terrible but if I don't get my shit sorted, my life organised I just tend to get worse, so I find that taking a little time off to sort myself out tends to mean I don't go NUTTY for weeks on end, affecting my work for a couple of days is better than negating it for weeks. Right?
Anyway, gotta go, things to do, you know how it is.

      Hmmm. Just a question I thought I would throw out there for you. I personally find that although I love a few wines, I freak out when it comes time for bed (haven't quite worked out the trigger for that one yet, surely not a fear of waking up hungover, then again...)then when I get up in the morning I feel so utterly guilty and ashamed for letting myself drink so much, I don't even really misbehave, just dance and sing and generally have alcohol induced fun. So my question to you is; does anyone else out there suffer from this, be it in a mild form or more severe....
Have come up with quite a good way to both save money and not eat so much. On the days that I take money to work for lunch etc. I go and get what I needed to purchase (preferably something healthy) and when I get back to my desk I but every last cent of change into a money box that can only be opened with a can opener (no sneaking coins out) this way I save money that i would otherwise have spent on a sweet afternoon treat, saving both money and calories. Impressed? I'll let you know how that one works out. So far I am in even more debt because I stuffed up my Tupperware calculations (as well as being in real estate I also am a Tupperware demonstrator of an evening) Anyway, I stuffed up my calculations and now instead of making money off my last order I owe them stacks. God this is shit!!! I hate oweing people money hate it hate it hate it! As far as ciggies go, I smoked and drank wayyyy too much last night so I have felt quite ill today, not too bad tho really, I am at work and functioning reasonably well I might add. But due to last nights efforts I have only had 1 1/2 smokes for today, being Saturday night and all I am sure to have a few tonight, but lets see if starting tomorrow I can quit AGAIN!!!! Am driving out to Nagambie tomorrow morning with my partner and then going to our block out near mansfield, should be a lovely day trip for us. Since starting this job in sales we have barely had a chance to speak to each other yet alone spend QT together. Ah well, this job and all it entails will be worth it if I can make some money and pull myself out of debt, hopefully get in front again, gee wizz that would be nice.... Ah... Well, might as well sign off for now, not too much else I can discuss really, tomorrow I might not be able to blog as I do not have my computer set up at home yet. Also I will be out in the country, having a lovely day off. Hmmm Nice! Have a lovely weekend.

      Hi all, 

Promised to post again tonight, so I am but I have to be super quick as work is having a function thingy for one of the staff that are leaving. I feel crap today... Ran out of my meds so had to reorder and took them late, taking them late gives me the shakes... absolutely hate that! Anyway, gotta go...Sorry

      OK, so i am really peeved, OK? Last night I sat down at my desk and punched away at the keyboard for ages, writing to all of you out there about my day (OK, so noone has read this yet but you get my drift, and I have faith that someone will come along who will take interest in my life). Anyhow, I was typing away, being extremely funny I might add, wrote some very impressive stuff that I could never recreate and just as I clicked on the publish button, wham! Computer decided to log its bloody self out didn't it!!!! Well not only was I peeved that I had just spent ages typing with all of my day just puring out of me but it was actually funny!!! I am not funny all that often so I am terribly upset that something I wrote that was actually funny is stuck somewhere out there in cyberspace. GRRRRRRR!
Well just to summarise... Yesterday I woke up feeling extremely crust after going out with the new receptionist (we are the only two staff members in the organisation under the age of thirty) we decided to form some sort of alliance, we seemed to get along quite well, I really like her she is nice and easy to talk to. Anyway, we had a couple of glasses of wine and many many ciggarettes. It does appear that alcohol and ciggarette intake correlate directly to one another...
So... after having a couple of wines and way to many smokes I had to stop off at the local supermarket for some stirfry ingredients. Well lesson learnt...DO NOT SHOP AFTER CONSUMING ALCOHOL, it can only lead to disaster. I went into the supermarket with the intention of getting some simple stirfry ingredients, I came out of the store armed with not only my stirfry ingredients, but; new underwear, stockings, colour lock shampoo, slippers, thongs (hey, they were on special...)a toy for the pooch and some doggy parfume - coz she stinks. Lo and behold, when I got to work yesterday morning and checked my bank account it was looking rather sad :-(
Yesterday I sidestepped a junk food land mine when I gave in to a McDonalds urge and pulled into the drivethrough on my way to work, once I had given in to my urge and pulled in I had three choices as I saw it. 1. Just continue driving through, this would have been totally rude and therefore an inappropriate course of action. 2. Order the junk food that I had pulled in there to get or 3. Order off the healthy choices menu. I am proud to say I took choice number 3. It bloody well better show the next time I jump on those scales too or look out!!!
As far as money goes I did have a little bit of a splurge, see I really wanted some boots for winter and a nice new winter handbag, but instead of going to some trendy boutique where up to $500 would have easily been spent, I purchsed some absolutely STUNNING pointy stiletto leather boots from the local no-name shoe shop at a cost of $120 and I purchased a gorgeous designer bag from e-bay at a total cost of $15. So although I spent some money (and yes smarty britches I do realise that spending money will not get me out of dehbt) I avoided getting myself further into debt by not spending more than I could afford and going for the boutique brands. I have already had several comments on my boots and really am very happy with my buy.
As for my spending habits it is one of those things I wasn't really aware of until after I had been taking my meds for some time that depression seriously affects things such as the compulsion to purchase in an effort to make you feel better. And it does for a short period of time, then the guilt steps in and takes over, for me it often culminates into a panick attack, this is another reason I have had to learn to curb my spending and try and recognise when I am shoppintg or buying just to make myself feel good.
Look, gotta go, as I really should get back to work, getting fired certainly won't help me out of debt. I will write again later as this Blog is taking place of the one lost in cyberspace.
Ciao for now

      Hi all,

Well, I have been wanting to do something like this for quite some time, somewhat like an online journal. Recording bits and pieces from my day and my life. 
Today for instance, I had the enthralling task of autographing over 900 flyers. No I am not a famed celebrity, merely a Real Estate Sales Person trying my little heart out to make a living. 
As I have said in by Blog description, I am hoping this will be the start of something big for me, this site, not real estate. I am going to do a daily tally type of thing for any regulars who may become interested in my somewhat mediocre life. I hope that my life gives you some form of entertainment a'la 'Save Karyn' or maybe even 'Bridgette Jones' Diary' not that my life is as interesting or as amusing as theirs but hey, why not?
Well to date I owe $40,800 in loans and credit cards, I have gained three kilo's (that I need to lose) since I stopped going to Weight Watchers Meetings and I recently took smoking up after having quit nearly two years ago. I started again when my depression culminated and expressed itself in a series of anxiety attacks. Very shocking for someone who only ever really thought depression was a myth. Since then, I have found many people feel this is a very taboo subject, well not for me. I have discovered that approximately one in every five people suffer from depression and my theory is that by discussing it openly, someone who may otherwise have been ashamed to discuss their feelings might just get the courage to come forward. 
That out of the way, this is not going to be a depressing site. Quite the opposite as a matter of fact. You see I want to provide my readers with entertainment, and as a budding and enthusiastic writer, I wish to gain exposure and earn enough money to pay off my tremendous debt. So if you are amused, entertained or otherwise and would like to support my hopes and dreams just log on and ask me how you can put a dollar amount on your entertainment.

 Debt - $40,800
Weight - 75kg
Smokes - 3 so far today

      Yesterday was a bad day. Just couldn’t seem to catch my breath, felt like just breaking down, curling into a ball, crying my eyes out and putting my fist through something… Instead I simply held my head up high and continued trying to breath in and out like a ‘normal’ person. I am just so stressed out. I am flat broke, I’m terrible at my job, my friends are mostly crap and there are very few people I can talk to because it is hard enough to think I am a failure let alone admit it to others and have them think that too. So, whenever anyone asks how the new job is going I just tell them a kind of truth…I love my job, the people are fantastic, the job itself is challenging and the hours are long, what I don’t tell them is that I am dead broke, as much as I love my job, I’m crap at it, the people are fantastic but that doesn’t really help my finances, the hours are long but no they are bloody not worth it! Not when I am earning the equivalent of $11 an hour before tax, $8 an hour after! I was earning that kind of money before I turned 18, I am now 25, earning the same bloody amount, I feel like such an utter failure!
The highlight of my week has been getting my motorcycle licence. One week ago, I was absolutely terrified of bikes, I have been bought up to be. I decided that I wanted to get over my fear and truth be told I just wanted to be able to go trail riding with the boys when we go camping rather than get stuck babysitting the little princesses they have as girlfriends, you know the type, they turn up to a campsite with luggage in tow, and I mean LUGGAGE, high heels, make up case, battery operated hairdryer, perfume, and a complete skincare routine, they then proceed to do nothing but complain that they are going to be sleeping in tents. Comments like “What!? Are you kidding me, I have to sleep in THAT? This is NOT what I am used to… I was not bought up like this…I should be in a motel or at the VERY LEAST in a nice campervan, but THIS you have got to be kidding!!!!” I want to say, yes love, actually we are kidding, see these nice dry tents, they are for us, the normal people, you on the other hand are a whining complaining little trollop who can sleep under that spider and ant ridden tree over there!!!! But I don’t I just smile politely and wish like hell that I were not afraid of bikes and could go with the boys and leave the princess’ to whinge and whine together. So I decided that I would finally do something about it and went and got a motorcycle lesson, well I loved it so much that I then booked in for my day session which concludes with testing for your learners. I can’t believe it, of all people, me, I GOT IT! I am allowed to ride a motorcycle legally!!!! Oh My God! It is simply unbelievable. The down side is that I did have to hock a school desk on ebay so that I could afford to do the lesson, but hey, at least I was kind off thinking outside the square.
This brings me to my next point, “Save Karyn” has practically saved my life, I am beginning to gain a whole new perspective on my debt, I guess the main difference between us is that my debt is higher and my wage is lower, but never the less, I have started listing things on ebay, and I am actually getting money for my stuff! Whoda thought?
There is this really terrible ebayer at the moment, I bought 5 digital cameras and had already agreed to sell them to a friend of mine, I sent payment and the bank sent it back (thank goodness) because the bank account was incorrect, well then this hideous woman, even after me emailing her to explain left me negative feedback, I felt bad about leaving her negative feedback, coz maybe she was just having a bad day or something, so I ticked the positive box and left an explanation of what happened as she didn’t seem interested in responding to any of my emails, well now I am receiving all these emails from other ebayers saying they have been ripped off by her, they have sent money and not received goods etc etc. They want to know why I ticked the positive feedback box, and now I feel terrible, in trying to do the right thing, I have once again stuffed up and because of me, she has gotten away with ripping other people off. I feel terrible.
To top off my debt concerns, I still haven’t managed to quit smoking and because I am practically living off of credit at the moment, I am not just spending a crap load of money on something that is really really bad for me, I am also paying interest on the craop load of money I am spending on something that is very very bad for me, yes, it is official, I am a stupid git!!!! What other explanation is there, I am an IDIOT!!!!! HMMMM let me see, what else, ah of course, my compulsion to eat everything in sight! Yup, as successful as I was at Weight Watchers, I am now a failure at that too! I am over goal weigt and just can’t seem to stop eating crap, I crave it, I think it is triggered by stress. Crap, gotta go, Boss just asked what I was doing and then talked to me about staying motivated! Uh Ha! Yup, coz that’s easy to do, stay motivated to work your ass off for peanuts. Hey! Anyway, I AM motivated, I’m motivated to write to my imaginary cult internet followers.

      Hi all,

Firstly I would like to say how happy my Blogger makes me. It is such a lovely pink, every time I open the site it is just so bright and cheerful looking. Well done blogger site!

I have discovered the benefits of aromatherapy, many of my ex friends would be saying right about now...'told you so' but hey that's why they are  ex  best friends, they're not all that supportive, what good are friends if they just crap all over you all the time? huh, anyway, this totally lovely lady who delivers my brochures for me, I only just was put onto her by my co-worker, she is this really lovely lady and she delivers 1000 brochures for just $25 (that's really good!) Anyway, I called her and introduced myself and all that and asked her if she would mind doing my brochures as well as my co-workers, she seemed quite pleased at this idea and we organised a time for her to pick them up. Anyway, when she arrived to pick up my brochures she also bought me one of those heat pillow thingy's filled with lavender. She makes them and as a thank you for our business she gave us one, see I told you she was a totally nice lady, and to top it off she got the brochures done in a really short time, and I know they were all delivered coz I have had an absolutely amazing response from the, definitely worth the small investment. Any way back to the lavender... I had barely slept in over a week when she gave me the pillow, anxiety and all that fun stuff, so anyway I went home and laid down to read 'Save Karyn' and put the pillow thingy under my head, next thing you know I am being woken up by my boyfriend laughing at me coz I am laying on my side snoring, his dog is curled up behind me asleep and precious is next to my leg asleep, he thought we were all quite a funny looking bunch, that is until his laughing startled me and I rolled over and stopped suddenly when I heard loud squawking! I had nearly squished poor precious, no more snoozing with me for the birdy... Anyway I have been taking the magic pillow (as I have now renamed it) to bed with me, I think it is simply wonderful and I haven't even needed any valium to help me relax lately, I never thought lavender could work so well but it really does. As a matter of fact, my boss just returned from Europe and bought back some lavender soap from France for me so I figure instead of treasuring it forever, which is a nice thought and definitely what I would usually do, I might actually use it as my night time soap in the shower to help me relax before bed. Hmmmm, looking forward to it already.
On a different note, I listed my first item on ebay 2 days ago, but unfortunately I had to do it without photo's coz my digital camera is set up to wok with the computer at home not work, and I only really have net access at work so i had to just do the best I could with my description, It is one of those old fashioned antique school desks for kids with a flip top and bench seat, the desk, not the kids. Anyway, I thought that if I was lucky I might get ten or twenty dollars for it, forget that, it still has 22 hours to go, has had 12 bids and is up to $50 already, how totally cool is that! I desperately need the cash too. I am so strapped, I can totally identify with Karyn, on almost everything except that I don’t get paid anywhere near as much as she does. For any of you out there wanting to know who the Karyn chick I keep talking about is, do yourselves a favour and buy, borrow beg or steal a copy of ‘Save Karyn’ by Karyn Bosnak it is absolutely Fab. By the way, Fab is my new word, ok well it’s not new, but I have recently added it to my ‘frequent use’ vocabulary coz I think it is kinda 80’s cool. Ok it’s probably just plain geeky, but since when have I been a trend setter? Ha! 
Have spent today flipping between actual work and sussing out details about working overseas for a few months, cool huh. That would really be something. Provided I don’t think about the logistics of such a huge thing it isn’t scary at all, just really really exciting, and then the inevitable happens, I think about the logistics, needless to say, I fall short of collapsing into a blubbering heap at the mere thought of such things as paying off debts, leaving the country, leaving my family, leaving my job, my bird, my cat, my next door neighbour, the friendly people at the noodle joint across the road…what on earth would I do????? OK, just push it to the very back and refuse to deal with it, a time will come where you WILL be able to deal with it and that is the time to sort it out. Not right now at the beginning when things are totally overwhelming and chaotic, but later once the decision has been made, just one little thing at a time till it is all sorted. AHHHH, that’s better…… Well I’m off for wine and $12 pasta night at the local, my fave muso is playing tonight, can’t wait.

      Hello all you imaginary folk,

Today my question for you all is whether or not I should travel and work overseas with my boyfriend while we are still young and free enough to do so? And what does the whole process involve?  As I stated yesterday, I am not doing terribly well in my new role which is very disheatrening to say the least, I am feeling like an utter failure to put it to you straight, but the thought has been with us for a while as to whether or not we are the travelling type? My other half has his business up for sale and is unsure as to what he would like to do when it does sell and well you know my story... we are going to discuss the possibility of doing a work and play type thing, travel and earn money, perhaps London would be a goer for us before we come back from travelling so that we are able to fund the purchase of a house. But we don't want to be stuck in England permanently, we would like to travel as well so maybe England for four months, set up 3 different accounts, one to pay our Aussie payments while we are away, loans, rent etc etc,(we would get my younger brother to house sit while gone so we can keep our very cheap rental to ourselves) Another account for living and travelling overseas and the third aws our savings account for our dream of being home owners. Neither of us have children so now seems like it could be the perfect time to put our plan into action????
This is a very scary move for me to make as I am very much a home body but on the other hand I would hate to start a family, grow old and then regret never having travelled while the chance was there. This would mean saving a considerable amount of cash and getting up to date with all of our bills etc but I am sure we can organise that. The other thing is that we are on a reasonably tight deadline as my partner turns 30 in less than a year and you can only get working holiday visas up to 30 years of age, so if we are going to do it we need to get our butts into gear, how very scary. But what an opportunity!!!! I would be terribly homesick and I also have the added concern of making sure I can get my medication as I don't want to be committed to an asylum or something while I am overseas, a truly terrible thought!

I'll leave you with that coz the office is closing and internet being shut down for the night, bye bye my lovelies, until tomorrow...

      Well you know what they say people? Yup, all work and no play makes me a very boring individual indeedy!!! I work in excess of 60 hours per week, ok, maybe i should rephrase that, I attend my place of employment for in excess of 60 hours per week and because I am basically very crap at my job I am currently living off my payback retainer. For those that are not familiar with the idea of a payback retainer, it means that I get a minimal base wage and when I earn commission, I repay that base wage and keep the outstanding commission. Not a bad way to get paid if you are good at your job and are doing well...unlike me, and by the way, the retainer plus car allowance (this doesn't get paid back) comes to be approximately $430 take home per week. Cop That!!! So as I was saying, I do nothing but work lately or at least I try to, but as I said, I'm not so good at it, that's not to say that I don't thoroughly enjoy the industry and my job...I do...it would simply help if I were good at it. As a matter of fact, I am starting to wonder if I am ever going to be good at anything? Anything, that is, except for being mildly loopy!
So anyway, to get back to it, I saw a couple of jobs advertised that I thought I might as well apply for. They are both very different to what I am doing now, and I am not even sure I want to leave where I am. I really like who I work with and my boss's are absolutely fab, but I really need more money and less hours. I know everyone says this, but in my case it is ridiculously true. I am supposed to be a relatively intelligent, creative, well presented young woman with loads of potential and yet I am watching everyone around me succeed, buy houses, get promoted, start families, even invest, and then there is me. Stuck in a deep dark hole, trying my guts out to claw my way out but somehow digging across sideways and getting deeper and deeper entrenched in nothingness. And yes I DO know how totally bleak and revolting that sounded but believe me, I am sick of being all uppity and happy and positive and Oh I just love my life so muchy!!! Blergh! Sick to effin death of it all. I love my family dearly and my boyfriend is 'it and a bit', as I said, my boss's are fab and I love the crew I am working with, but when is something fantastic going to happen to me, for me? Don't get me wrong. I do count myself lucky that I have a loving family and I certainly count myself lucky that I have the support of one of the last great men, but truly, surely, I am worth more than $10 an hour? Holy crap, I just realised that that is really BAD!!! Ah well...

Anyway the jobs I have applied for are totally different to what I am doing, a total path change for Bree! I am a little worried about my parents reaction though, and I know I shouldn't be, I should just concentrate on making myself happy. At least that's what my boyfriend keeps telling me...But my parents always expected me to be some sort of roaring success, and it never really occured to me that that wouldn't happen, and they both seem so proud of me in this job, I just hope they won't be disappointed in me if I decide to try something else. i gues I am a little bit of a flippityjibbit so to speak, a jack of all trades, master of none, that's me. I have worked in a newsagency, pizza shop, bakery, bank, travel hotline, excecutive suites, employment agency, and now in real estate, there have of course, been things in between. I just get bored so very easily. I syuppose I should be thankful that I have employment but I once read a saying that has become one of my favourites..."Aim for the moon, at least if you miss you will land among the stars" how cool is that saying? Only thing is I am sick of reaching and climbing and finding there is nothing out there. So once again I will try and tell you about the jobs I have applied for without going off on too much of a tangent, I will get it out quickly - Fashion Retail Store Manager for ESPRIT that is opening in one months time and a Tavel Consultant with Flight Centre! They both simply sounded like great opportunities and I thought to myself, 'self, why the hell not?' So I applied.
I have also taken the first real steps to pulling myself out of debt today. I have gone to see a personal banker and had a chat to them about consolidating a few of my loans and cards etc so that I can save more money. I have also put my first item up for sale on ebay, how very exciting!!! I'm not quite sure how to do the photo thingy yet so I have put it on there without photo's and we'll see how it goes.
I also realised something else today...Alot of my so called friends have dissappeared. My boyfriend said to me that I always seemed to be the one making all the effort and they never did, well I guess that is true because since I started in this position I have barely had time to call anyone, and I only realised today that it has been weeks and in some cases months since I have spoken to some of the people I once classified as my friends, simply turns out they only spoke to me when I called them, otherwise surely someone would have called to see how I am going in my new job???? I know I would have called them if it were the other way around. This is what really irritates me. When it comes to my friendships I give them my all, but it is very rare that anyone gives back even half as much as I put in. I would do anything to help a friend in need but I can honestly say that I think very few of them would return the favour and of all of them, it is mostly the ones I have met through my partner that would do anything for me. Maybe he is a better judge of character than I am or maybe (ok definitely) he is a better person than me and therefore attracts better friends. Wow, now I really am sounding like a loser. You're probably sitting there reading this thinking...any wonder no-one likes her she is a boring drama queen who is a total loser!!!! Fair enough too, but I do try and be fun and hip and funny and I truly would do anything for my friends, I just don't know how other people get to be the way they are when I am such a weirdo. I am going to stop now before I don't even want to speak to myself... (I know I know Cerrayzee!!!! But at least I don't answer myself :-)
