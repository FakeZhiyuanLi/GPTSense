      It might as well be a Monday!  I know it's Tuesday but it feels like I have lived three Mondays in a row already this week.  After coming home from the dentist (I'd rather move to Iraq, as those of you who know me can figure) I was already in a petrified state.  I was cranky because I could not eat (couldn't feel my lips) and proceeded to add chlorine to the pool, which makes me sneeze like crazy.  When I turned back the cover there was a HUGE dead cockroach in the pool!  GROSS!  Returning to my office after the chlorine, I realized Olly dumped the trash and scattered it all over the room, eating all the plastic in the process.  I cleaned it all up and went into the bathroom, at which time the wooden cupboard door jumped out in front of me and scraped my knee all up.  As I screamed in pain and cursed and swore, I went to the other bathroom for some bactine and stepped in kitty puke on the way.  Olly had thrown up in the hallway after eating all the plastic.  As if all this wasn't bad enough, I went to find the carpet cleaner to see that there wasn't any left.  I tried to find something to clean the carpet and came across another cleaner, which I grabbed and headed back to the hallway to clean the kitty barf.  Stubbing my toe on the couch, I couldn't take it anymore!!!    To top everything off, I have a 4:30 appointment to get measured at the gym that I joined.  This is my first session with my personal trainer, Brandon.  After all that has happened, the least enjoyable evening I could have would include having my fat content documented and my flexibility criticized.  I hope Brandon is nice to me!  This is one of the worst days I've had in a really long time.

      There was a frog in my pool last night.  I took care of him.

      If you live in Northwestern Indiana, chances are you might have heard me on the radio this morning.  My Uncle Steve Zana is one of the DJ pair that broadcasts the morning show on  urlLink Indiana 105 .  It's all because of  urlLink this picture , which travelled the Internet so fast yesterday that the folks in Valparaiso were stunned!  Uncle Steve interviewed me about how I heard of it, and how fast it went around the world.    Interesting experience, to be on the radio across the country at 6am...  Good morning, Indiana!

      Last night, during our evening float, I was having soooo much fun!  I had gone to the pool store earlier for lunch, and picked up some goggles, a snorkeling kit, nose plugs, ear plugs, a kickboard, a ball, a thermometer and a new bikini.  Woohoo!  For the first time ever, I was able to snorkel.  Ok, well, I call it snorkel!  I know it's just cheap plastic and 2 feet of water, but it was really cool!  Just as we were laughing and taking underwater pictures and learning to breath under water, a HUGE DUST STORM came flying into Gilbert.  It came very quick, and the massive cloud was upon us within about 2 minutes of seeing the first sign of the sweeping cloud masses of dust.  It was like a scene out of Twister.  Andrew looked up behind me and said, "We have to cover the pool, now!"  I turned and saw what he did and yes... oh yes.. must cover pool now!  We barely made it out in time to cover the pool, put down the patio umbrella, flatten all the chairs, and bring in all the towels and the stereo before the storm hit.  The wind knocked down our unicorn winder (like a wind chime thing) and continued to break our patio umbrella moreso than it is already broken.   I was so depressed at having to get out of the pool... I felt like I was 5 years old and somebody told me Christmas was cancelled.  All I wanted to do was snorkel!  Ahh well.  Maybe tomorrow night we can try again.

      Today's DVD is a compilation of 12 minutes of video from when we filled up my friend Mat's bedroom with balloons.  He was on his honeymoon with new wife Courtney when we wreaked havoc on his abode and literally filled the entire bedroom, floor to ceiling, back to front, with balloons.  Pictures can be found  urlLink in their gallery  at  urlLink www.matandcourtney.com .  It's been 18 months since I installed my first DVD burner.  Since then, I've experimented with a lot of different burns and a huge amount of software applications that state they are 'easy to use' and 'efficient' and other adjectives that prove to be wrong.   urlLink Sony Vegas + DVD Architect 2  are by FAR the best authoring tools I have ever used for DVDs.  However, it is expensive at $800!  Vegas is a movie editing application with a lot of flexibility, but an easy layout that allows even an intermediate movie editor such as myself to easily author and render movies in a variety of formats.  DVD Architect allows you a whole world of freedom in composing and editing your DVD menus, chapters, remote options and lots of other stuff.  I've tried about two dozen DVD architecture software suites and packages, and this is the ONLY one I would recommend.  GREAT JOB SONY!  Ya'll finally got something right!  I choose AVI for my movies, as I find mpeg to be so compressed that when viewing on a television, you see vertical bars without picture running through across all the edges of your subjects.  However, those of you who have created movies know that AVI is less compressed, and therefore the files are huge.  For example, a 12-minute home video movie straight from my digital camcorder in compressed AVI format for NTSC-DV is 2.5gb.  Uncompressed it is 5.3gb.  (I've had to start buying supplimental hard drives for all this video work - I'm up to 490gb now.)  For those thinking of getting into burning your own DVDs, make sure you find out the specs on the media before you buy.  For example, TDK DVD-R 2x will actually read AND burn at 2x, where CompUSA DVD-R 2x will read at 2x, but only burn at 1x.  When it takes over 2 hours to prepare and burn a 12-minute video at 1x, cutting that in half makes a BIG difference if you have to burn 5 copies for your friends.  Onto the next burn!

      In the mailbox today is our monthly energy bill from SPR.  Opening up this particular bill is always an awakening event, with totals running from $70 in the dead of winter, all the way up to $300 in the blistering heat of August here in central Arizona.  Today, without much surprise, I found that we currently owe $199 for the month of June.  As this is a fairly typical amount, I shrugged it off as normal and decided that it was about time to take a look around at how much it would cost to get a more efficient air conditioner and air handler unit.  Moreso than the cost of energy, I am more interested in lowering the multi-decible wwWWWWHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA that protrudes from our current piece of junk unit that our builder so lovingly installed three years ago.  (Believe me, if I could make the A's a larger font, I would.)  I am also interested in lowering the amount of energy that is used here in Arizona, as it is always a topic for discussion in such a remote location of the desert.  I found out that our Goodman air conditioner,  urlLink model CLJ48-1 , is a 12 Seer 4-ton rating.  Uninstalled, this crappy model apparently runs about $1200.  That's about $1100 too much, in my opinion.  Constructed with 100% uninsulated vibrating steel, it can knock your swimsuit off in 1 second flat upon commencing its sequence of lovely conditioned air output.  We may as well be launching helicopters off our roof, in fact, this unit might just make them sound nice in comparison.  Taking this information a bit further, I began to investigate new systems.  An average Trane model XL16i would cost approximately $6,500 installed.  Did I do something wrong here in calculating?  Hmm, I guess not.  This does include the air handler, air conditioner, all cables and feeds plus labor and additional parts...  It would definitely be a more efficient system with a SEER of 17 and some hefty insulation... But at an approximate 30% cost savings over the life of the unit... that would save us approximately $500 per year.    So, I suppose if we are going to be in this house for 13 years, maybe it's worth it to investigate?  It would certainly be nice to lounge on the patio and smell my beautiful roses without the use of earplugs and a cane for stabilizing oneself against the ground vibrations.

      My scale is confused.  It thinks it's a lie detector test.    No really, ok, so the stupid thing is less than accurate.  Forget that, it is NOT accurate at ALL.  I got all excited the other day when it said I was down to 218.  Then I get on the damn thing now and it says 222.  I did not gain 4 pounds in 36 hours.  So I step off the thing and wait.  I press in the button again and step on.  This time I look down.  It says 217.  Ok cool, that's more like it.  I step off, and press the button again.  I get back on it and look down, and it says 221.  WTF?!?!?!  I get off and wait a moment or two.    I press the button and stand back on it.  This time though, I slide my feet a little more out toward the edges than in the center.  Wow, 215!  So *that's* how I'm supposed to get on the scale?    Maybe next time I should just put one foot on?

      Well I took this silly little quiz, and the results are in...  My kiss is apparently:    You have an entrancing kiss ~ the kind that leaves your partner bedazzled and maybe even feeling he/she is dreaming.  Quite effective; the kiss that never lessens and always blows your partner away like the first time.    urlLink   What kind of kiss are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I wonder if my husband agrees?

      Happy birthday Uncle Keith in Indiana!  Thanks to  urlLink Tiffany  for my very first blog comment on Ben's win.  I'm so glad somebody is reading my ramblings!  Today is Wednesday.  The day of conference calls.  Woohoo.  (Don't I sound excited about that?)  Much to my surprise, Andrew came home last night and was eager to take another float.  I call it a float because the pool is so smallish.  It's giant for a typical "flip and fill" as Arizonans call it, but it's still only two feet deep.  When short little me can sit in the pool and have the water line barely reach my neck, it's definitely not very deep.  Perfect size to float in, though.  What did I do last night?  Hmm.  I delved into Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (book 5) again.  I just can't seem to stop reading HP.  Suppose that's alright; since I've never actually *read* a book before Harry Potter, at least it's getting my mind working a bit.  Sure I write a lot, poetry, journals, and such; but I've never been one for reading fiction.  When I go to the library I most certainly am found in nonfiction, looking up books on whatever hobby I'm trying to defeat that week.  Photography, oil painting, spanish, PERL coding, drip irrigation...  who knows what I'm getting my hands dirty with.  It changes constantly.  Andrew was sweet enough to sit down and help (ok do himself) put together a database in Access for our San Tan Ranch homeowner's association survey results.  That took a while because we are not used to using Access, typically we use SQL and PHP to work with databases.  It had to be portable though and something that our board President could use.  Hopefully it works out ok.  We shall see!  I called my friend Deidra yesterday just before she got out of the hospital.  Everyone is doing great!  The new baby is a delight, and she sounds absolutely precious.  Deidra is feeling fine although heavily medicated (I would be too).  I've never had a baby but it sounds quite drastic.  I've seen it on TV a billion times...   When we were going through our year of infertility treatments I watched every baby delivery I could find on TV.  Since my miscarriage last Halloween, I can't even bare to look at a baby.  One of Andrew's cousins had a baby in the same week that we were due to have ours this May, and I can't even bring myself to a family event to see him.  I just can't.  Maybe time will help heal this constant pain I feel.  I can only hope.  Better get back to work.  Got things to do before my conference calls start.

      I've been a pretty big fan of  Six Feet Under  on  urlLink HBO  since the second episode of the first season.  Small pieces of each character set are identifiable, and they have had interesting plot lines and interjections since the beginning.  However, I have to ask, has is started heading south?  I caught the replay of the newest "Episode 41: In Case of Rapture" last night on HBO2.  Of course, these are just my personal opinions, and should only count as such.  The role of Arthur, causing turmoil between Mom and her new husband, seems somewhat pointless.  We understand that he is jealous because he wanted a relationship with her, but does he have to go so far as to look up words in the dictionary to prove himself right, or ask for replenished yogurt from her man?  Next there is the relationship between David and his boyfriend Keith.  I enjoy the drama of their relationship, with the breakups and makeups of a gay relationship.  Why do we have to then realize David is making poor decisions with the plumber?  It just didn't make any sense to me.  If anyone were to cheat, I'd have thought it would have been Keith, not David.  Then, why did he tell Keith?  Even more curiously, why did Keith laugh about it?  I'd have been really upset.  We all know where Claire is headed with the newest character, Edie (played by Mena Suvari).  Of course she's heading into bisexual territory with her art-girl curiosity.  Let her go there, and break her eye open.  Go Claire, have a blast.  At least you won't have to worry about another abortion.  I won't bother commenting on Nate and his inability to cope with Lisa's death, other than it is a little too obvious.  Nor on Rico's cheating frenzy with the stripper... but why buy her DVD players and knee surgeries?  Whatever.  After so many seasons, when a show becomes popular enough, it always seems to head south.  I am hoping that Six Feet Under doesn't get as bad as the last season of the Sopranos.  Please, let it die first!

       urlLink CNN.com - Affleck wins poker tourney, $356K - Jun 22, 2004   When Andrew mentioned this to me last night, I thought he was joking.  First let me say that I really like Ben Affleck as an actor.  He has done pretty good work in the past, and I enjoy the film projects that he has worked on.  I even liked seeing him as part of Project Greenlight.  To see what really goes on behind the scenes to make a movie, even a low-budget film, was fascinating.  I wonder what it would be like to play no-limit Texas Hold'em with Ben.  I have a hard enough time playing poker against Grandma, because lying is just not part of my psyche.  I've been watching the World Series of Poker for about five years now, and soaking up all the suddenly-popular World Poker Tour and Celebrity Poker Tour and all those other poker shows.  I really enjoy gambling.  But what would it be like to sit across the table from Ben Affleck?  An average person, or one who has never made it to the final tables, would probably be intimidated.  You know that he knows how to play, you know that he has money to burn and that he's just doing it for fun.  For a pro, who plays for a living, it must be frustrating.  Here comes this guy, lots of money to kill, just out for a nice time.. tromping and stomping all over your hard work.  I guess this doesn't apply to just Ben, it would be any celebrity or famous person who has lots of money.    Of course, the likes of Stan Goldstein and Phil Helmuth have won plenty of tournaments and I'm sure they have lots of money to buy in to $10k and $25k tournaments.  But this, not acting, is their job.  It is how they make their living.  I think I'd feel a little squished if a celebrity came into my line of work and started doing it better, beating me at my own game... Literally.  Well, good luck Ben.  I hope you make it into the final few tables in Vegas next April, because I'd love to watch you play in the winner's circle!

      Today is my sister's birthday.  Happy Birthday Kathleen!  Last night, we went "swimming" in our little inflatable pool after Andrew came home from work.  It was refreshing, just enough water to float around in, but not so much that it's overwhelming.  Not too much to do in there though.  We don't have any water toys or television or music out on our patio.  Just the neighbor's dog barking and the very, very, very loud air unit that never seems to stop.  It seems to vibrate even louder when there is water nearby for some reason; like it echoes heavier.  After our swim, I went for a walk with our neighbor Trudy.  It's really fun when I get the chance to walk with her because she's a really nice person, and I enjoy talking with her about life.  It's been quite a long time since I've made a new friend that I can really talk to, so I'm not sure if I'm doing a good job of it.  We're supposed to get together on Saturday to watch a movie, and I'm looking forward to that.  Andrew is going netgaming this Saturday so we should have the house to ourselves and can chat the night away.  Exercising, then stretching in the pool, then walking 2.1 miles in 100 degree heat was maybe not such a great idea.  Boy oh boy am I sore today.  I did NOT want to get out of bed this morning.  *Uuuuu...  snoooze... please... hit the snooze...button...*    I'm glad that this week I'm on the light duty for work.  Thursday starts the second-most heavy duty, Reporting.  Right now I'm on Mitigation which doesn't entail much work.  Change is the worst though, by far the heaviest and most complicated.  Duplicates is third in the rank, but that was last week.  We rotate through so each of us experiences the duties once every five weeks.  My coworkers are really nice, so that is helpful.  I've only been in this new job for 8 weeks now.  Considering the first 5 weeks was daily training, I've only really been working for real for the past 2 1/2 weeks.    In other news, my DaD is moving his family to a new house up in Michigan.  They are only moving about 4 miles from where they have been living since 2000, but it's a big move for them.  He and his wife have my little brother to move, not just themselves.  Noah is 7 months old and starting to pull himself up on things.  It's hard enough watching him with a house where you know the placement of everything, but during a move everything will be dishelved.  I sure hope it goes well and the boxes get unpacked quickly!  Time for me to get back to work...

      Actually it's more of a rubber holding tank.  Sort of a kiddie pool, but on steroids.  Called an  urlLink Easy Pool , it's 12' in diameter (a circle) by 30" deep.  You inflate the top ring then fill 'er up.  It barely fits on our paved patio and gets sun for most of the day to heat up the water, and then it is shaded in the evenings.  The filter system is quite simplistic, but I honestly didn't expect much for $78.  It took us about an hour to set it up, and then about three hours to fill it with water from the hose.  I let it sit out in the open sun today and already the top of it has a layer of ickyness.  I guess we'll have to cover it up and keep it cold from now on.  We've been thinking about getting a jacuzzi/hot tub for our back yard.  Andrew and I went out to Paddock Pools to take at look at their Sundance spas yesterday.  They look nice, but if you actually climb into them you'll see that they are just not deep enough.  They also do not have enough room, or they have built-in seating that just doesn't feel comfortable.  Andrew is too tall, and I am too wide, to sit comfortably in any of the built-ins.  Also if you sit in the open circular spas, only one person's knees and feet will fit in the center.  How could it possibly seat 3-4 people?  Those marketing folks are seriously disturbed if they think these things seat 6-7 'comfortably'.  That's a crock if I ever did hear one.  I think we'll be passing on a spa for now.  They just don't seem to make sense.  Now if I could just get Andrew to install a ceiling fan in the kitchen, that would make things much more comfortable in the front of the house...  I'll work on it...

      The  urlLink East Valley Tribune Online  featured an article on June 15th about the upcoming road construction here in Gilbert.  They are not even kidding, either.  We cannot reach any destination without encountering construction of roads, buildings, schools, freeways, hospitals, stores, or homes.  The growth explosion in Gilbert is of course, why we moved here; but I don't think either of us were prepared for the extreme amount of construction we are faced with.    Andrew has to commute through this crap every single day to get to work and back.  It should  not  take 30-40 minutes to go 7 miles to US60, but it does.  No matter which road you take, north-south or east-west, every single one is torn to bits.  The accident numbers are climbing every day.  We've had five motor fatalities in Gilbert so far this year, up from three all of last year, and zero the year before that.  We built our house just under 2 miles south of where a brand new freeway is going in called the San Tan Freeway.  It is supposed to be done in late 2005, and most freeways here (unbelievably) are done ahead of schedule.  I'm just hoping all the waiting around is worth it, and that all the new traffic it brings won't cause us more headaches than the construction is today.

        So far today, Cheetoe has slept a lot.  He got up and ate some cat food around lunchtime.  He watched the birds for about ten minutes, then he drifted off to sleep again.  I should also mention that his brother Tumbles (in the background) has done pretty much the same thing today.  Oh, the life of a kitty!

      Since the beginning of May, I've been changing my life around a bit.  In a desperate attempt to lower my chronically high blood pressure levels, I quit my job, and devoted myself to my health and hobbies as much as humanly possible.  (I've since got another job, but I work at home full time now.)    I cut back on soda, chocolate, doritos, sweets, and started replacing as much as I could handle with whole wheat, fruit, jello and low-sugar items.  I also purchased what I feel is the best workout DVD on the planet:  urlLink Paula Abdul's Cardio Dance .    Doing that workout 3-4 days per week and adding some extra walking to my daily activities, I am very proud to say that I have lost 14 pounds in 7 weeks to just 218.  My goal is to be down to 199 by Hawaii, and to hopefully fit into the seat on the long flight to Oahu.  We leave on September 2nd.  I might just be able to make my goal!

      You might think I mistyped the name of this blog, but I didn't.  I called it Random Mews on purpose.  My husband  urlLink Andrew  and I have three male cats named Olly (age 5), Cheetoe (age 3) and Tumbleweed (age 1).  Little Tumbles, as he is affectionately called, walks around the house meowing at random.  He talks and talks and talks, all day long.  He gets especially loud and obnoxious when the second person arrives home.  Irregardless of whether it's Andrew or me, no matter what time of day, whomever comes home second seems to get the brunt of his meowness.  Maybe he is bored of playing with the person inside the house.  Maybe he thinks the new person will give him kitty treats.  Maybe he just thinks that whomever is in the kitchen is the most likely candidate to take the yardstick and fish out his mice from under the stove and the refridgerator.  Whatever the reason, Tumbles meows so loud and so much that it drives us crazy.  I figured that would be a good name for the blog, since whatever it is that I happen to be typing here will be me, complaining loudly about something at random, and it usually doesn't matter what it is about or whom it is directed to.  I suppose just, whomever will listen.  Just like Tumbles.

      Well, ok.  So I've been denying it for a long time.  I'd say, something around six months is how long I've secretly wanted a blog.  After setting one up for my friend Deidra who just had a baby yesterday (congrats  urlLink Deidra and Mark !), I decided to try one out for myself to see how it works.  Maybe I'll even start posting random stuff.  Who knows?

      Last night I went to my third class of  urlLink Wilton Cake Decorating, Course I .&nbsp; We learned the second step in creating roses, plus how to decorate with shells and drop flowers, as well as figure piping.&nbsp; I made clowns!&nbsp; My neighbor Trudy decided she does not want to go any longer, so I took my mother-in-law with me.&nbsp; I think she got a kick out of seeing us all try to make beautiful things out of decorator icing.&nbsp; My first rose came out pretty well, I must say!&nbsp; The shells are one of the easiest things I have learned, but I couldn't get the hearts down with tip 12.&nbsp; Practice makes perfect, I suppose.   Tonight I am heading to training at 5pm, then to another craft class to make a wreath for my mother-in-law.&nbsp; She seemed to like the birdhouse that I made for her last week in a different class.&nbsp; These one-day sessions are held through the  urlLink Gilbert Parks and Recreation Department .&nbsp;   Coming up this week: Wednesday at our house is a 5pm meeting for the Newsletter and Website Committee of San Tan Ranch.&nbsp; On Thursday I have training at 5pm, and Friday it's off to Las Vegas for the weekend!&nbsp; Hooray!

      On Saturday night, I went out on a date!&nbsp; It was very sweet.&nbsp; He showed up at my door with a beautiful bouquet of flowers with large red roses that smelled like candy.&nbsp; I was dressed in my favorite outfit of black capris with a blue fitted blouse and my black sandals.&nbsp; My nails were painted to match for the occasion.&nbsp;   Then it was off to the surprise location to have our date!&nbsp; We drove for a while up Higley Road past the new grocery stores, past the freeway, into the heart of Mesa, Arizona.&nbsp; When I thought I could wait no longer, the turn signal sounded and we pulled into the  urlLink Broadway Palms West Dinner Theater .&nbsp; We had a very nice buffet style dinner with desert, and sat back together to watch the show.&nbsp;   The Music Man was a very fun production, and I'm so glad we got to see it! I'd like to thank my sweet husband, Andrew, for taking me out on an enjoyable evening.&nbsp; I had a wonderful time, and hope you did too!&nbsp; Love you!

      I received four tickets to see The Tonight Show with Jay Leno during the August 13th taping.&nbsp; I sent away for them two months ago!&nbsp; I sure hope we can figure out a way to get over there.&nbsp; A live taping has always been something I am interested in attending.&nbsp; I hope somebody cool is on that day.   What else is happening... ?&nbsp; The new Envoy is working out nicely.&nbsp; I think we'll be taking it up to Las Vegas next weekend.&nbsp; Can't wait for that vacation!&nbsp; Finally, we get to see Cirque's O performance.&nbsp; We've only been wanting to see it for about.. three years?&nbsp;   Somebody left our mail on the ground outside our door today.&nbsp; It's amazing anything makes it to our house.&nbsp; Most of the time we get other people's mail.&nbsp; Once in a while, somebody knocks on our door to say, "Here, this came for you.&nbsp; It was in my box."&nbsp; That's nice of them.&nbsp; I always return mail that comes to me incorrectly.&nbsp; But I have to wonder, how many pieces of mail never actually make it to my house?   That leads me to junk mail.&nbsp; Irregardless of electronic or physical, junk mail really irks me.&nbsp; Not necessarily because I have to throw it out, or because people are harrassing me, but it makes it really hard to sort through the junk to the stuff I actually need to read.&nbsp; Or in some cases, want to read.&nbsp; Example: MBNA sends statements in the same envelopes as courtesy checks, which are also deceivingly close to advertisements for credit protection and other crap I don't want.&nbsp; But I have to cut open my fingers trying to get through the hundreds of envelopes to figure out which are junk, and which are truly bills.   Another example is junk email.&nbsp; Once in a while, there are actually people whom I WANT to send me advertisements.&nbsp; Such as Caesar's Entertainment Group in Las Vegas, for ads about room rates and slot tournaments in Vegas.&nbsp; I want those.&nbsp; And stuff about Blue Man Group and their latest tours and albums.&nbsp; I want to get those.&nbsp; But I don't need viagra, and I don't need penile enlargements; I don't want a new driveway or a pool, and I don't need car insurance from Geico.&nbsp; Crap like that makes it very hard to sift through junkmail in both forms to figure out what is truly needed.   When I post queries about genealogical research, people take that email address and send junk to it.&nbsp; So I end up having to throw out most of the stuff that comes into those mailboxes as junk because it is so widely used.&nbsp; However, if I don't post an email address, people can't contact me regarding important genealogical connections.&nbsp; What on earth do you do to get around that?&nbsp;   Junkmail makes it too hard to get the information that you WANT to get.&nbsp; I couldn't imagine being the parent of a child of computer-age.&nbsp; I'd want he or she to have his own email address to talk to classmates and to family members, but how on earth do you control it?&nbsp; Sounds nearly impossible.   Well, it's off to the gym for another training session.&nbsp; I'm hoping to buy a new printer soon.&nbsp; Do you have any recommendations?

       urlLink CNN.com - Four inmates escape, go on beer run - Jul 20, 2004 : "Two of the inmates walked out through a fire exit, leaving the door propped open with a Bible, and made a hole in the exercise yard fence. They walked to a market, bought some beer and returned to the jail to share it with other prisoners. When the booze ran out, the other two inmates made another beer run to a different store."  OMG!  I laughed SO hard when I read this article.  These guys broke out wearing street clothes, as the prison cannot afford jumpsuits for everyone.  I don't really think it's fair to charge them for escape.  I mean, come on, it was the prison's fault for leaving the doors unlocked.  They DID come back, after all!  They didn't even cause a riot!  These guys just wanted a beer.  I can't blame them; if I were locked up in prison, I think I'd want alcohol too!

      I would highly recommend reading  urlLink Confessions of a Car Salesman  before attempting to set foot on the property housing a car dealership. It covers a lot of bases with tips and explanations to help you prevent yourself from getting completely screwed when it comes to buying a vehicle.   Other tips from my personal experience:   1) Show up with knowledge of the fleet, the price of your car, all rebates available, options and option prices of the vehicle you want. Have with you a printed wish list that explicitly states the Kelly Blue Book price of your car, how much you want for a trade, and how much you are willing to put in as a down payment.   2) Know your credit score and know how much the banks and credit unions are able to get you as an APR for financing.   3) Mark down additional things you want included such as cargo nets, fabric mats, extra keys and keyless entry remotes. These can often be worked into the deal or given to you for free.   4) If the dealer doesn't want to comply with these requests, write down the VIN number of the exact vehicle you want, and call every dealer within 100 miles asking them how much THEY want to sell you that car for. Dealers will trade inventory in order to make a sale, and that can save you thousands of dollars!   5) DO NOT GIVE IN. Even if you have signed over the title and are all the way back into financing, when they try to screw you by saying, "Oh, well you only qualify for 9% APR, so sign here." Just say, "Oh ok, then I'll just take my title back for my car, we'll cancel this sale and find another dealer who will get us the rate we want." I guarantee they will try harder and harder until they make the sale, because they will usually get fired if they don't. You HAVE to be ready to walk out that door, and make them realize you really will!   I hope these tips from my experience will help another sucker (oops, I meant buyer!) to get what they deserve!

      Well, it's more like a Luxury SUV for Grandpa, but I LOVE my new wheels.&nbsp; Just driven off the lot last night, it's a 2004 GMC Envoy.&nbsp; Base model, but with 4 wheel drive, side airbags, and XM Satellite Radio... I couldn't think of a better vehicle for me.&nbsp; It rides like an oversized Cadillac, which is exactly what I was looking for.&nbsp;    &nbsp; This sweeeet&nbsp;ride replaced my 1992 Lumina APV minivan, with 169,600 miles.&nbsp; Quite an upgrade, I must admit!&nbsp; I'm so glad I have A/C again!

      The past weekend has got to rank #2 on the worst possible weekends in a decade listing.  Unfortunately it started out with frustration and stress and just went downhill from there.  I won't go into details as it is inappropriate, but I sure am glad it's passing gracefully.  I've been working on my husband's side of the genealogy recently, and have scanned in some  urlLink postcards  for people to enjoy.  They are mostly from Indiana and Ohio, postmarked between 1907-1919.  They are beautiful notes with original handwriting, family events, birthday wishes, and encouragements.  Quite a nice find for our family history!  Yesterday I took a little time to help a fellow genealogist in need of a gravesite photo.  She lives in Tennessee and needed some information from a cemetery here in Phoenix.  I took some pictures and got copies of the plot info and sent it to her.  It feels good to help a stranger when possible!  Then I had my very first Wilton I Course I cake decorating class at  urlLink JoAnn ETC  up at Desert Ridge.  It seems like it will be very fun!  I'm taking it with my neighbor Trudy, and I'm very glad she suggested it.  My friends Katie and Mike Peterson just left a few minutes ago, on their way back to Chicago.  They stayed with us overnight last night on the last evening of their trip to visit and catch up.  We chatted and reminisced, and played a really fun card game called Guillotine.  It was so much fun to play!  We haven't seen them in a few years and are very happy that they were able to squeeze us into their busy trip!  Thanks KT and Mike!!

      That's a very cute line from Finding Nemo... when Nemo goes to touch the boat against Marlin's wishes, and his classroom friend says "He touched the butt!"  A little humor is needed today after the past few days of oncall work.  Not only am I suffering through two different oncall rotations, but I'm also on Change duty, which is the hardest and most time-consuming duty in my position.  The first two nights I was up at 3am and 4am and did not get to go back to sleep.  Last night was better though, without any pages at all.  It didn't stop me from waking up occassionally, thinking I had been paged!  Another HOA board meeting was held last night.  Talk about boring!  At least I had some neighbors to help pass the time with passing notes, funny faces, and making fun of people.  It's a good thing we were in a high school classroom, because I certainly felt like I was in 9th grade History class.  We've been finding tons of bugs inside the house lately.  During the summer in Arizona they take refuge inside the houses from the heat.  I've seen earwigs, crickets, spiders and knats.  It's horrible and disgusting!  I hope the exterminator gets rid of most of them this time.  I've found some praying mantis on my roses lately which is nice because the leaf-cutter bees ruin them every chance they get.  The Mantis eat the bees.  Well I suppose I should get back to work.  I have a lot to do before lunchtime.  Will try to write again soon!

      Oh boy am I ever tired.  I'm on-call for work this week, Tuesday through Monday.  Last night I was up at 3am for a filled filesystem that wouldn't go away, and have mostly been awake since then.  Or at least, interrupted enough to make it feel like I did not sleep at all.  Not much is happening here except work.  The pool is still nice, especially after we shocked it and got some chlorine going.  No more algae at the bottom, which is helpful.  Tons of bugs, but no algae.  We're thinking about taking a quick trip up to Las Vegas for the heck of it.  I need to check into ticket prices and hotel prices.  I got a deal postcard for Bally's and Paris but the weekends are not ones in which we can go up there.  We would only be able to go the weekend of 7/30-8/2 or the weekend of 8/20-8/22.  All other weekends have something happening that prevent us from going until October.  Jessica

      I took some practice shots at the fireworks on Saturday night.  The display was at Rockin' R Ranch in Mesa, Arizona.  Taken with my Canon EOS Digital Rebel, Bulb setting, ISO100, F16 at 18mm.  We're going again tonight to the Town of Gilbert Old Town 4th of July celebration.  Will post those tomorrow!     This is a triple exposure over three bursts.  I don't think it's all that bad, for my first time ever trying to take fireworks shots!

      While my trainer at the gym is very nice, and he gives good advice and seems to really know what he's doing...  why is it that he has to stand directly in front of my eyes and count my reps in his little grey training tshirt?  All I could do was talk about my husband the whole time.  At one point I even caught myself in a giggle fit!  You'd think I were 15.  I'm so embarrased!  Anyhow, things are going well.  Tuesday I went in for my first meeting and did 25 minutes on the eliptical machine.  Is that how you spell elipticle?  I then attended the 60-minute water aerobics class.  Wednesday I went down for lunch and did 10 minutes on the bike and 15 minutes on the elipticle machine.  Today I went down and did 10 minutes on eliptical, then 60 minutes of weight/retention training, followed by 60 minutes of water aerobics.  Tomorrow is my day off from the gym.  I go back on Saturday.  Time for bed.  I figured I'd write a little before heading into dreamland.  I have to go in for bloodwork in the morning so my doctor can yell at me again for having high cholesterol.  Yay fun!  Then we're having window tinting installed on our office windows to help reduce the heat inside our offices.  I hope it helps.  Later!

      My sister-in-law, Amy, and I went to Los Angeles this weekend to celebrate her birthday. We left on Thursday night and drove to Blythe, where we stayed overnight at the Hampton Inn. Friday morning we got up early and drove into Burbank, where we waited in line to see The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (much more on that later).     After seeing the taping, we checked into the Hilton at Universal City. The gentleman at the front desk was nice enough to provide us with a complimentary room upgrade to the Executive level on the 20th floor.      Notice the seriously awesome view of the Hills.  The staff was very nice to us for our entire stay, and exceeded our expectations for sure! The hotel had a modeling conference going on, which Amy and I both thought was probably a scam to these 10,000 people hoping to 'make it big' in Hollywood. I hope something good came out of it for the participants.  We took a quick swim and ordered room service, then watched the opening of the Olympics and I stayed up long enough to watch us fly by on three zoom pans across the opening sequence of The Tonight Show! *lol*  Saturday we went to the Universal Citywalk for some souvenir shopping. We at at the Saddle Ranch Steakhouse for breakfast, where our very cute waiter sang Happy Birthday to Amy and gave her a free Slab of Chocolate cake.     Then it was off to the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County to see the gem exhibit. First we stopped in the Pavilion of Wings to see the butterflies, which were beautiful as expected!     Here Amy is holding a caterpillar that one of the keepers was telling her about. Isn't it cute?     The gem collection is quite a sight - thousands and thousands of minerals and gems are on display. It is one of the biggest collections I have ever seen, and Amy sure seemed to like it too. I bored Amy by taking a million pictures, but I think she was happy cuz she got to see 'shiny stuff'. =)     Next we stopped off to see the infamous Hollywood Sign. You'd think it is prominent and can be seen from everywhere, but it is quite difficult to find. This picture was taken from the top of Beachwood. We had to illegally park in a red zone with our emergency flashers on long enough to take a shot (this is with a 300mm zoom lens, no tripod). Lots of other tourists were doing the same thing we were. I'd hate to live on Beachwood!     For Saturday night we watched television, napped, and talked until the wee hours of the morning. Sunday we got up around 8am and took off for Phoenix. We stopped at the outlet mall that is 100 miles east of LA, 50 miles west of Indio, for some shopping. We picked up more souvenirs and were off to home sweet home!  I'd like to thank Amy again for joining me in California for her birthday. I think we had a fantastic time!

      Happy Birthday to my sister-in-law, Amy! Tonight is her celebration dinner, although her birthday is not until this Saturday. We are going to Burbank, California for the weekend to be in the audience of The Tonight Show on Friday the 13th!  I put some of those newly learned cake decorating skills to work... Don't laugh, it's harder than you think!

      I've been thinking of putting together a scrapbook album of all the concerts that I have attended. Also another thought was to chronicle the songs in my life that have significance in some way, to record them for prosperity. What better an outlet for collecting thoughts than my Blog?  Here are 31 songs with an important attachment to my life, thus far, in chronological order.  01.  Jessica  by  The Allman Brothers  I'm named after it. My DaD says, "Although the song is a free-spirited, wide ranging 10 minute instrumental packed with intricate keyboards and incendiary blues guitar riffs, mixing the subtle with the outrageous, it somehow all went together and came out a classic!" Sure sounds like me, doesn't it?  02.  Material Girl  by  Madonna  Madonna is to this day one of my very, very few heroes. She is strong, talented, open minded, courageous, and opinionated. Everything I love in a person, encompassed into one very attracted, extraordinary musician! Material Girl is important because as a young 6-year old Madonna wannabe, I would have contended with you for hours that the song was called "Mamma's Cheerio Girl." I guess I'm a little opinionated myself; regardless of how wrong I was!  03.  California Girls  by  Van Halen  I truly believed that this song was written about me and my friends, growing up on California Street in the Genessee Gardens section of Bridgeport, Michigan. Oh how wrong I was! At 7, I just didn't know any better.  04.  Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go  by  Wham!  This catapulted George Michael into my top 2 artists of all time (up there with Madonna). Even at the age of 7, I was totally and completely in love with George. To prove it, I even went so far as to officially have my Cabbage Patch Doll renamed "George Michael." I was in love with him and we were going to get married someday. (How was I supposed to know he was gay?)  05.  Broken Wings  by  Mr. Mister  Oh David Boensch, how you have impacted my life without knowing it! It was third grade, age 8, and David broke my heart. The first really big crush of my life was just that - crushed - every time David made fun of me. He even hung up on me after I suffered through eating one entire Wendy's hamburger (ewy ucky icky pewky nasty ucky ICK!) just for the privilege to call him one evening. This song was my only release from heartache; I sang it at the top of my lungs every day.  06.  Dude Looks Like a Lady  by  Aerosmith  I met my best friend, Jennifer Strachan, on the first day of Fifth Grade in Mr. Cooper's Class at Harvey E. Kauffman Elementary School in Bridgeport. We clicked so fast you'd think we were literally attached at the hip. We used to roller skate to school in the spring of fifth grade together, screaming this classic at the top of our 10-year old lungs and gathering very funny looks from the neighbors along the 5-block path.  07.  Funkytown  by  Lipps Inc.  I still don't remember how we got hold of this 45 record. It might have been part of my DaD's growing DJ collection, or one of Jennie's mother's records. We thought this was one of the funniest songs we had ever heard! Jennie and I used to replay this record over and over on her phonograph at her home on N. Porter Street in Saginaw. We made it sound even funnier when making up voices to sing it in.  08.  Once Bitten Twice Shy  by  White Snake  My Mom is a bartender in a little town called Mio, Michigan at the Mio Saloon. During the summers, I spent a lot of time there in the bar (not unusual) singing songs off the jukebox and playing the old bar piano for the patrons. Between sixth and seventh grade, this was the most popular song on that jukebox. One very attractive gentleman at the bar would often sing along with me. I didn't realize that he was a drunken scumbag until much later - but had fun singing with him when I didn't know any better!  09.  Sweet Child 'O Mine  by  Guns & Roses  We have Jeff Salmen to thank for this one, my classmate at Bridgeport Middle School in the sixth grade. I spent a lot of my time roller skating at Bridgeport Roller Rink with Jennie, where Jeff also frequently could be found asking me to 'go with him' and begging me to slow-skate with him. He wrote in my yearbook, "To a girl I asked to go with me 67 times and SHE SAID NO!" Jeff used to serenade me with "Take me down to the Paradise City where the GIRLS are green and the GRASS is pretty!"  10.  Into The Night  by  Benny Mardones  I began to help my DaD with DJ shows about this time for weddings and banquets. This was about 1989 and seventh grade. Benny sang his heart out with Into The Night, and it signified for me what I hoped every boyfriend at the time would do - sweep me off my feet and be so romantic I would love him forever. Luckily for my husband, none of my then-boyfriends fit the bill.  11.  Ballade Por Adeline  by  Richard Clayderman  This one is an instrumental piano solo that I played during my second recital at Bridgeport High School in 1990. It was probably the most technically difficult song I have ever played, and I was so nervous to play it in front of 30 people! I still love hearing the song, although I must say that I have never liked a rendition better than the one that I played in 1990. (Ok, maybe I am biased?)  12.  Ice Ice Baby  by  Vanilla Ice  Picture this: The Eighth Grade Talent Show at Bridgeport Middle School. Each act was allowed to pick its own song to play. Out of ten acts, four of them chose Ice Ice Baby! This was the height of Vanilla's success, and we soaked up every iced fleck of it. This song could not have been cooler - we totally dug every stolen riff of it!  13.  Baby Baby  by  Amy Grant  My first true love was Matt Wright. Matt and I started dating in 1990 and were on and off again for a year or so. He was my first kiss - right about the time that this song was introduced. It encompassed everything I felt about Matt at that time. I loved it so much I learned to play it on the piano the best I could, although I don't think I ever told him that...  14.  Everything I do (I do it for You)  by  Bryan Adams  Please, anyone with a shotgun - PLEASE kill this song! That is how I felt about Mr. Adams' #1 hit in 1991. Being a DJ with my Dad, we must have had 30 brides in a row pick this damn song as their wedding song. I don't think I've ever wanted to erase a song from my memory more than this sappy dramatic piece of crap!  15.  Do Me  by  Bel Biv DeVoe  Heading into high school, I was also coming of age in many other ways. This song was a very naughty signifier of what I wished I could do with whatever boyfriend I was with at that time. I think because I knew it was naughty, I liked it even more! Part of me wonders though, would I want my 14-year old listening to these lyrics? I doubt it!  16.  Cold Hearted  by  Paula Abdul  Oh my... this one brings back memories. Freshman year, my friends Angie Grunow and Jaime Cutliff decided to perform in the Mock Rock at Heritage High School in Saginaw, Michigan. We chose this little dance number, bought matching outfits (shorts and solid color t-shirts) and practiced, practiced, practiced! I was SO nervous to get up on that stage... and for good reason. We were terrible, we were literally laughed off the stage! How humilating!  17.  More Than Words  by  Extreme  This song always struck me as a beautiful ballad and the words were perfect. This was the song of my Dad's and his girlfriend at the time, from what I understand. In 1992, I was learning my voice and loved to try it out on this melody. Not to mention, I thought the boys of Extreme were, shall I say, gorgeous? Their long hair put me over the edge of giddiness.  18.  Personal Jesus  by  Depeche Mode  My sister was huge into Depeche Mode and the club scene in 1992, and as she went off to college I was still listening to the Smiths and Depeche Mode and others of the genre. She told me once that she met a guy on the dance floor of a club in Miami Beach on Spring Break in 1992 and began dancing with him when the awesome dance center of this song came on. He later became the father of her first child, therefore etching this song into the culturally significant once of my life. Without it, there might not be an Ashley!  19.  Sir Psycho Sexy  by  Red Hot Chili Peppers  It was July of 1993, and Nathan was my 'first'. I met him online, a tall skinny guy from Freeland, he kicked off a whole mass of boyfriends one right after the other. This was around the same time RHCP released Blood Sugar Sex Magik, which quickly became one of my favorite albums of all time. This song, Sir Psycho Sexy, was so sick it was awesome! Nathan, whose online name was Psycho, fit the bill. Psycho. I should have KNOWN better. One time, he tagged a bridge in Freeland with spraypaint, and couldn't even figure out how to spell his handle. PSYCO. That, ladies and gentleman, summed him up nicely.  20.  Under The Bridge  by  Red Hot Chili Peppers  Woe is me; at 15 I was so depressed you could barely see my eye color because they were always looking away at something else. I used to hang out with my cousin Jeff at the train bridge up West Michigan Avenue in Saginaw Township, and this song happened to come out around that same time. I used to run out over the river on these tracks, which today I would NOT do, and jump underneath the tracks onto the big cement pillars with Jeff. I would envision jumping down into the river and never coming back; this song helped to cement that thought into my head. Music can be healing or harming, depending on your disposition in the world...  21.  Storms in Africa  by  Enya  Before my Junior year at Heritage High School in Saginaw, I attended a Band Camp at Central Michigan University to learn Colorguard for my school. This was the song we used to learn an entire routine for show at the end of the camp to our families. We had to learn the entire thing in just 5 days and put it on at the end, showing the techniques and the teamwork we had learned. It was one of the hardest things I had done to that point, and it's all on video tape. I hope I'm never famous! :)  22.  Jack and Diane  by  John Cougar Mellencamp  First at age 8, I thought that when my Mom (Diane) decided to leave our family that she probably ran off with some guy named Jack. Not quite; his name was *exploitive deleted*. Later, when I had forgotten this idea, I listened to this song in my car, driving for the first time by myself, on my 16th birthday. What a rush! My sixteenth birthday, all by myself! "Hold onto 16 as long as you can; changes come around real soon, make us women and men." Boy did that hold true for me!  23.  Theme to Romeo and Juliet  by the  Heritage High School Marching Band  This was our theme song for the 1993-1994 marching year at HHS. One of the most difficult things I endured was hundreds of positions on a football field, coordinated with hundreds of flag and rifle moves combined with multitudes of altering wind conditions. I've never really liked Romeo and Juliet, but this theme was beautiful as played by the band. Looking back, I realized how uncoordinated we were, and the band was always out of sync - but I thought it was wonderful at the time!  24.  Why Go  by  Pearl Jam  This song is about a girl whose parents put her into a mental institution, and she sees no point of wanting to get better to go home to her 'family.' My depression had hit me so hard that I wanted to be that girl. In fact, most of the album Ten by Pearl Jam can sum up my life at age 16 and 17. My mom's twin brother had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital for trying to kill his wife, and I really felt bad for him. I tried to visit him a few times but the staff would not let me. It was just another blow, and I felt like I would never get past the feelings in my life. (Thank goodness it did, eventually, pass.)  25.  November Rain  by  Guns & Roses  This lovely song was the one that my high school sweetheart Corey and I chose (unofficially) as 'our song' for our relationship. However, our official song was "When It's Love" by Van Halen. I didn't realize November Rain related to death and heartache. Maybe he did? Who knows?!  26.  Can't Be Sure  by  The Sundays  Near the end of my Junior year of high school, this song became our Winterguard routine's anthem. I had never heard of The Sundays before, but this song is ingrained into my skull along with each flag toss, formation change, pole swap and gymnasium layout in central Michigan. We sucked. I mean, we really sucked. One time we got second place because there were only two teams competing! That was our best claim to fame. I think we earned last place every single time we competed. I didn't realize how bad we were until I looked back on the tapes a few years ago... and nearly cried from sadness and laughter both at once!  27.  Black Sunshine  by  White Zombie  To this day, I have not heard too many songs to rival this one with poetic license. The introduction lyrics are mesmerizing in their quality; when accompanied by the music, the whole package is fascinating. A poet by nature, I always try to find beauty in words and have always felt this song to be one of the best ever. It may not be beautiful in a traditional sense, but cleverness wins with this classic. Incidentally, the only other song I have felt this way about is "Drops of Jupiter" by Train.  28.  I'm Too Sexy  by  Right Said Fred  Milan, New York and Japan! I was too sexy for that song, for sure. My senior year of high school, we performed this gem in Spanish for the Spanish French Club annual talent show. I was "Milan"! I held a giant cutout of Italy and strutted down that catwalk just like the men in the video. Soy tan sexy para Milan!  29.  Wannabe  by  The Spice Girls  There was only one thing I wanted to be when Wannabe came out - with this total hunk I met my sophomore year of college! He was unbelievably attractive, mysterious, intelligent, funny... everything I had ever wanted in a man. We went out bowling on one of our first dates, to Cosmic Bowl in Scottsdale. Wannabe came on, as loud as it could be - and we danced and jigga-jig-ahh'd the night away. If The Spice Girls had not got Andrew to open up that night... we might not be married today! Thank goodness for significant songs like this!  30.  Mambo No. 5  by  Lou Bega  Catchy, fun, and a huge international smash hit - what more could you ask for? Oh and I forgot to mention, it was totally all about ME! Hearing my name on the airwaves always gives me a rush of sexy confidence. I was one of Lou's special girls, "A little bit of Jessica here I am, a little bit of you makes me your man!" Especially since I was the last word in a string of girls including Monica, Ericka, Rita, Tina, Sandra, and Mary... forget about them, it was Jessica who stole the show! *LOL*  31.  The One  by  Elton John  I learned to play this song on the piano when I was 17 because I loved the video so much. It features two people, embracing together on the floor, totally naked but tasteful - revolving in a circle with shadows and lights emblazoning their skin in the darkness. I fell in love with this imagery and felt that if I could ever feel such beautiful love, that it would have to last forever. Fortunately I found that love, and when we married on February 2, 2002, The One was our wedding song. (NOT that damn Bryan Adams tune.)  So there you have it: thirty-one songs that have impacted my life in some way or another. I hope you enjoyed this voyage and that it helps persuade you to chronicle something similar for others to read and envision in the same way.  Oh, and if you happen to do the same - I'd love to read it!

      I saw  urlLink Chicago  with  urlLink Earth, Wind & Fire  tonight at the  urlLink Dodge Theater  in Phoenix.  It was quite a spectacular show!  Sold out with not an empty seat in sight, both bands took the stage together at 7:45pm.  They played until 8pm, when Chicago said goodbye for a while and EW&F took the spotlight until 9:30pm.    Phillip Bailey is a fantastic performer and has wonderful vocals, what amazing talent!  I can honestly say I have heard one song by their band, yet I still say they rival most of the bands I know of in a live performance.  The energy and emotion coming from their performance is intoxicating.  At 9:45p, Chicago took the stage and it was quite funny watching the audience decide whether to sit or stand.  EW&F gave such a hyped performance that had everyone dancing and grooving, standing and cheering with all their might!  Yet when Chicago came on things mellowed out dramatically... nobody quite knew what to do!  The original members are still playing the horns, but of course there was no Peter Cetera to sing original vocals.  Instead the vocals were done by a few new hotter, younger guys that did an okay job of it.  Around 11p, EW&F came back up on stage for the finale songs.  They went back and forth like the opening sequence, helping out on each other's songs.  The final performance was Chicago's "25 or 6 to 4" which is one of my favorites.  Overall it was a great show!  A little note about the Dodge Theater:  Don't sit in the 11th row.  Along all the floor sections, the first 11 rows are all on the same level as the stage, with the 12th row (and higher) elevated one step for each row.  Sitting in the 11th, I had to look through 10 rows of standing, dancing people to try to see the folks on stage who were basically eye level with me.    Although I was only 60 feet away, I barely had a view the entire show, thanks mostly to the 6'8" giant sitting a foot in front of me.  (Being 5'4" myself, I got some good looks when he was leaning over to whisper to his wife.)  The row behind me was a good foot above my head, and couldn't care less whether we were sitting or standing because they (and everyone behind them) could see right over the first 11 rows of heads with ease!  While I'm at it, I should also tell you not to sit on the balcony at the Dodge Theater either.  Not only is it so high it's like an oven in the building, but when Blue Man Group was rocking hard, so was the balcony.  We all thought we were going to crash at any minute, and I got sea sick with the movement all night long!

      My husband and I went out tonight and tried Bubble Tea, aka Boba or Pearl Tea.  Here we see Honey Dew Melon in the background (mine), with Andrew's Thai Tea in the foreground.  The Honey Dew Melon tasted like vanilla shake with a hint of honey dew, while the Thai tasted like a sweet iced tea.       Of course, pictured here are the melted versions after sitting in the car for a while.  Originally they are more like a Slurpee or a Slushie instead of a liquid.  Andrew said it best when asked about the flavor of the bobas (the balls at the bottom):  "They taste like ass."  (Not that he's ever tried "ass", to the best of my knowledge...)  The little boba balls are extremely squishy and chewy and I would not recommend trying them, unless you are very adventurous!  These were purchased at Yen Mi Restaurant inside Lee Lee's Supermarket at the corner of Dobson and Warner Roads in Chandler, Arizona.  They are $2.99 each.  Lee Lee's also sells the Boba in both natural and tapioca flavors to make at home yourself.  They are $2.29 for a 2.2 pound package.

      Vegas was pretty fun.  We walked the entire strip by foot, both sides, and after driving 12 hours my back is soooo stiff.  I have to wonder, what does Vegas have against dimes?  It’s almost like they are not legal tender in Nevada.  Not one casino would cash them, nobody would let me play them, heck; I couldn’t even PAY for my food with them at the Luxor!  It’s almost like they are not American coins.  It’s a conspiracy against the little coins of the world!    When we left Vegas I was about $100 up, and Andrew was down $60.  I had a great run on a craps table at the Rio on our way out of town and earned about $75 of my winnings, so it was nice to leave town a winner on my own roll of the dice!  In other news, on Monday I finished Course 1 of the Wilton Cake Decorating series.  My neighbor Trudy begged me to go with her and then she bailed after the first class.  I went by myself and had a great time!  I am going to try to sign up for Course 2 at a Michael’s that is closer to my house.  This one was at Desert Ridge which is about 35 miles north of here.  This coming Saturday is my last personal training session at the 24 hr Fitness gym.  I am glad that is over.  While I like the motivation to go to the gym, I don’t think it is necessary.  In fact I think it hinders my workouts because he works me very hard and I feel I shouldn’t make myself so sore afterwards.  Plus, meeting with the trainer means I have an appointment and specific days, so I can’t just go when I want to go.  And with him, I am so sore that I don’t feel like going on off-days.  Andrew and I are going together this Thursday to see if he would like to join.  I hope that he does, because it would be great to have him as a workout partner.  I think that would provide more motivation than anything for me personally.  Tonight we are going to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban at the IMAX Theater in Tempe.  Andrew and I are meeting his sister Amy and her friends Denise and Jeff there.  Should be fun I hope, seeing Harry and his friends on an 80 foot screen!
