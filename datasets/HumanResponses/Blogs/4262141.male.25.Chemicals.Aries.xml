      Today I find myself doing a distillation of my own.  I found a Schlenk tube of acryloyl chloride in one of the fridges that has been there since August 1994.  This means it's its 10 year anniversary!  It was distilled originally by my predecessor, Stephen Horner.  I actually quite enjoy distilling liquids, it's rather soothing, I find.  Ok, that sounds a bit weird, but I like it (what a nerd).  I've got a custom-built all-in-one distillation kit which is perfect for microdistillations (up to about 200 mL) like the one I'm doing now.  It's nearly finished so I'd better go keep an eye on it.  Ok, all done.  It all distilled off at the right temperature so it should be ok.  Maybe it'll still be around in 2014 when some poor fool is continuing with my project!  I think the oldest chemical I've ever used is an enormous 500 mL ampoule of thionyl chloride which had been around here since the 1950s.  We broke it open and it was still good, which was pretty incredible for such a reactive chemical.

      Urrrgh...  Just finished off in the 1st year lab.  They've been distilling ethanol from wine today which has been interesting.  The whole lab smelt like a brewery and I'm sure I'm slightly woozy from all the ethanol vapour floating around the room.  The experiments they do in 1st year are a bit suspicious, to date they've done;    - Plant extracts (Northland chemistry)  - Aspirin synthesis (making drugs)  - Distilling wine (boozing it up)  What are we teaching these kids?  I suppose it's better then straining meths through bread, as I've heard the winos do down under Grafton bridge.  Ben and I actually tried this once, but the meths didn't get through the bread.  Obviously we used bread that was of too high a quality, bums can't afford extra thick toast bread apparently.  Maybe we needed something more porous, such as Vogels or Burgen?  I've always thought that they could use the free BBQ hotplates down at Outhwaite park to distill their meths, I'm sure they get hot enough and would deliver a superior quality of alcohol without the nasty taste and colouration!  How sad.  I actually think that it's really immoral for the dairies in the CBD to sell methylated spirits, because the only people that buy it are the homeless (who pops down to the corner store for a bottle of meths?), and the amount that the dairy owners would lose out on by not stocking it is negligable.  They should just take it off the shelves and help solve the problem.  In other news, Peter beat me in Scrabble, again (grrr).  However, I have to point out that it was only by about 10 points, and I caught up from being over 120 points behind.  I got a legendary word - DECANONE, which scored 20 + a 50 point bonus for using all 7 letters.  This holds the record for our highest scoring word yet.  I have to see if Peter can put our Scrabble scores online.  Time to go home.  I thought I had to supervise a test tonight, but as it turns out, it's on Wednesday.  Thank goodness, I'm exhausted!

      Arrrgh...  When will I ever learn?  I've had my 1st years' labs for two weeks and haven't gotten around to marking them until this afternoon.  Typically they're due back tomorrow morning.  I guess some things don't change from when you're an under grad - you still leave things until the last minute.  So here I am on Sunday afternoon marking the aspirin synthesis lab.  It's incredible how many 1st years just don't know how to follow instructions!  Honestly, if we made these labs any easier, we'd have to incorporate a fingerpainting component.  There are some quite good students, but unfortunately most of the decent chemists amongst them are headed for 'greater' things, i.e. off to med school or biotech.  It's actually kind of annoying about how most of the best chemistry talent is siphoned off into med.   What's so cool about being a doctor anyway?  Better be careful what I say due to the fact that many of my close friends are of the medical persuasion...  It seems to me that it's a stink job in reality, you study for 6 years, then have to keep studying for another 7 until you get to where you want to be, all the while working 12 hour days and getting every second weekend off work.  Stuff that for a lifestyle.  Yeah, they may get paid heaps but when do you get to go out and spend it?  I guess the helping people bit is nice, but I know that I wouldn't be able to handle the other stresses of the job.  Church this morning was fun, I got to play on the beautiful Epiphone guitar that Jenny Horst has kindly lent me.  Steve McBride and I had a very cool jam session.   I'd love to buy an electric guitar of my own, but unfortunately I don't have a spare $3K or so that it would cost to get an amp and a decent guitar.  Oh well, one day I'll have a job and disposable income.  It's kind of frustrating being as materialistically inclined as I am and having no money!  Still, I think it's God teaching me to be content with what I have, and a little humility goes a long way!  Better get back to the marking.

      I've just been chatting with George Clark, the X-ray crystallographer here in the department.  He's solved the structure for the Hg-containing compound I submitted which is great.  As it turns out, the R factor isn't great (it's about 11%, ideally should be   Paul's moved down to the 6th floor now, he went down this morning.  James (my supervisor) said that apparently this might be the way that things go now, we may have to shift around as the political tides within the chemistry dept change.  Currently, Organic rules the roost (or so they think...) and is expanding rapidly, and wanting to fill the whole floor.  I really haven't achieved very much today, I've spent most of the morning running around trying to find George, acting very much like a bundle of nervous energy.  Thus, I couldn't really bring myself to do any serious work and now it's the afternoon and the reaction I want to put on will take too long to set up.  Maybe I'll phone Peter and see if he wants to play Scrabble over coffee.

      I'm a bit annoyed today, as I've just been told that either my lab mate Paul or myself has to move downstairs. What happened a while ago is that most of my research group went down to the 6th floor of the chemistry department, leaving Paul, Angela and me up on the 7th floor. This in itself was irritating enough, because various items of shared equipment have now been split between two floors, meaning that we have to trudge back and forth to get stuff.  Apparently, what's happened now is that there's a new post-doc arriving who will need a fumehood to work in, so that means one of us has to get the boot. I wouldn't mind going, apart from the fact that the desk space down there is extremely limited, (like about 1 square metre per student), that I'd have to disassemble and then reassemble my entire vacuum line and that I'd lose the PC with the direct-internet connection (bye bye net surfing and blogging). There are a few advantages though, such as being with the rest of the group (and away from the annoying guy in the student area up here)  and getting to be closer to the solvent purifier. We all have to move down eventually, but what I'm ticked off about is the fact that we were given 1 day's notice when they've known for months that the new post-doc is coming. Pretty inconsiderate really.  Anyway, as it turns out, Paul is Ok about moving down, so he's going to go while I stay put. I hope that by the time I have to go they've sorted out the desk space problem.  In other news, it looks like the reaction I did yesterday worked, so hopefully I've got a new palladium-containing complex. I'll send it off for a mass-spec and see if that sheds any light on the structure. Tomorrow I will also hopefully have an X-ray crystal structure for a mercury-containing compound that I made a while ago. Fingers crossed.

      Ok, first real post.  Here goes.  Well, unsurprisingly I find myself sitting around wondering what to do while I've got a reflux on.  I'm currently trying to synthesise a palladium derivative of a ligand I made a while ago.  It's been pretty good to work with, I've managed to bind a whole host of different metals to it like Hg, Ru, Ni, Pd.  It's quite cool doing organometallic chemistry, you end up with loads of pretty coloured complexes, and the very minor buzz that comes with the knowledge that you're the first person in the history of the universe to have made this molecule.  Sweet.  I guess a bit of explanation would go a long way.  It would also probably take a long time to type.  Why chemistry, you may ask?  For me it goes a long way back.  Here's a brief summary!  As a kid I was always intersted in mucking around with stuff in the kitchen, mixing up baking soda and vinegar, (fizz fizz), playing with food colourings to make new colours.  My parents, both being teachers, bought me lots of books from an early age, instilling and nurturing in me a true love of knowledge and discovery of the world around me.  I carried this with me all throughout my schooling years.  When I entered the 3rd form, I had a very inspirational science teacher called Stuart Mason who gave me a real love for two things - the trumpet and chemistry.  At this point I decided that I was going to take my education as far as I could, and in my 13-year-old view, this was a PhD.  Since then, I've graduated twice from University, once with a BSc in 2000, and with a BSc(Hons) in Chemistry (1st class honours).  Seems I can't get enough of it, because I'm still here in 2004, finishing off my doctorate.   So there you have it, a very brief summary of my education to date.  I'm sure that future posts will illuminate the knowledge quest a little more.

      Testing 1, 2, 3...  I saw an ad in the latest flyer from Telecom advertising blogger.com.  I figured that it's probably a scam to get people hooked into their broadband plan, but I've been mildly interested in blogs for a while so I thought I'd give it a go.  Watch this space!
