      Dear Sweet, sweet reader/s,  Last night Katina and I hosted a show at the PIT. I had never produced before and hindsight is always eh, 20/20. So as I sit here and type with my new vision- I'll detail the ways things could have gone better.   For starters the Pit had no a/c... for those of you that cannot decipher a cryptic anachronism, A/C stands for "air conditioning." NO AIR CONDITIONG IN A PACKED THEATER IN LATE JUNE???  Management did not notify me of this little ditty nor did anyone help to cool down the room. It was so hot I was frosty the snowman up there. The audience found it hard to cackle when they were drenched in their own salt water. It was simply nasty.   Secondly, We way over booked. I basically offered spots to lions at the Bronx Zoo and it was complete chaos.   However, in spite of it all we had some real talent that rose to the occasion. Carmen Lynch, who has been in HBO's Aspen Comedy Festival did a set as did Madame Funnypants who are always stellar.   Some people bit it- and others triumphed- despite the ticking of the clock and the pools of sweat that dripped to the floor.   However, a few of Stokes's campers were unhappy. They felt they went on too late, they were pissed I over-booked and they were upset they didn't shine like they usually do.   Here in my friends lies the clear distinction between someone who holds-up in the face of adversity and someone who buckles and cries like a little boy.   I've learned a lot about the differences in people's characters. I have never been one to be sympathetic to the self-deprecating "poor me" types that creep and crawl around  this business- but now I am completely turned off.   Allow me to edify you in performance protocol. As a stand-up comic you pay your dues. You do shitty open mics where you wait 2 hours to get on and play to one person. You bomb on stage and you're subject to content criticism. You either decide that stand-up is not for you- or you keep at it. If you decide on the latter, you become tougher- less judgmental- you try to be less self-effacing and learn to adopt a "never let them see ya sweat" mentality.   Last night some folks espoused the following sentiments "I usually get a better response." One guy bitched and moaned "I didn't want to go up there."   If you are a performer that gets up a lot- one gig melds into the next...plus, you are always one gig better than before. Especially after braving a tough crowd.   In addendum, you never, ever approach a producer or friend and tell them anything less than "Thanks for the spot." If the show didn't go well they probably feel bad enough. You don't have to lay your deflated ego on the floor for them to trip on.   I've done plenty of dreadful gigs in the past three years. And, I was never less than gracious to my host. If someone thinks so highly of your work that they want to showcase you- then they have your best intentions at heart. If you are frustrated (as I have been) then go home and vent to your roomie or stab your teddy bears eyes out- Don't show your egotistical vulnerable side to me- I am not Dr. Phil... and I have one of my own, thanks.   As to you people that were troopers (with dignity intact) you know who you are and I thank you.

      I absolutely adore Margaret Cho, but I am having a hard time vibing off CK.   Who is CK you ask? A former client of mine. You see I dabble in real estate during the day. Yes, or course stand-up pays the bills... but I'm just such a people person, I must interact with the general public.  CK, is a design student at Parsons and ran me around the city like a wild boar. I couldn't understand a word she said. We'd walk into a East Village pad and I'd literally say, "You like?"  That's how we interacted.   I must have shown this little hussy 95 apartments. Because she told me that she currently lives with "cockroach."   So, she finally decides on this apartment on 12 b/t second and third. Sick location. She tells me, "I have guarantor- he own gas stations." Great! Fantastic! Deal.   The chick explains that the person who's going to be paying her rent is (get this) "My father's relative." Ahhh hem, now wouldn't that be your relative too...? OK.  Long story short, the "father relative" only shows 92K on the books. Not enough for this little bitch to score the place.  Here's the worst part, I collected 100 bucks from her for her application fee and in a moment of weakness (because I fear bad karma) told her she could have her money back. However, I've already spent it: Lunch at 7A, a shirt that reads "NY Doll." you know the drill.   I ran her around for free, she lied to me about qualifying for an apartment.. and GURRRR!   Now she's calling me speaking in broken English and giving me one hell of an attitude problem. I told her she can come and get her cash and she replied with "You tell me that already." Ohhh ummm... can you let me know when you're coming to get it ass bag? I hope the roaches nibble at her toes while she sleeps. If I come off obtuse or unfriendly in this post, please refer to other post where I am more amicable. Thanks!

      I've recently decided to sell things. You'd be surprised what people will buy. I recently approached a gruff looking gentlemen... about 40ish on St.Marks Place. I said, "Hello, Pablo (he just looked like a Pablo) would you give me a dime for my Zippo?"   Pablo looked skeptical at first, then acquiesced. He produced some change from his pocket and announced, "Because you're so pretty- you get a quarter."   Yes, people, YES!!!   Anywho, my improv class ended our illustrious six week run on Tuesday and one of my fellow classmates had the bright idea to host an "end of class party" at his 200 SF studio. So, we all piled or shall I say spilled in. It was bumpin'. I brought my own forty of Sapporo, because that stuff fucks a lady up.   Here's where the confessions come in. I have the hots for the said host of the studio soiree. I find him very... "cute." Within minutes of entering the party I turn to my friend, who happens to be a Latino firecracker reporter on Telemundo... and say, "I wish Mr. X would throw me up against a wall." She responded by looking uncomfortable.   The party rocks and rolls and various people leave. My gal pal Aubrey, (who may I add is the smartest improviser ever), and I sit in a corner and loudly proclaim our disdain for some of the people in the room. OK, one person in the room. Aubrey, like a good 19- year-old leaves and it's only me, the boys and my other 19-year-old friend Devon.   This is when I go in for the kill. Eyeing my prey, I suggest playing Spin The Bottle! At this point nothing is beneath me. So I grab an empty bottle of Aquafina and spin. It lands on my "whatever" and he goes in for the kill. Full-on frenching. HOT! Then I spilled my jack and coke down his back and he got pissed off. He spins again and it lands on me and we make out again. By the time the tomfoolery stops, I counted four kissy-poos. Again, my powers of seduction never fail me- ugh... well, almost.... I see him sitting on the couch in a kind bud/ vodka coma and try to straddle him. That's when he puts a Fandango looking puppet in my face. Never a great sign. So, I take the hint and round up my fellow party stragglers- that why yes... were only a foot away.   What will happen with Mr. X and me? Nothing! A little something? Stay tuned babes, stay tuned.   X to the O,   The official Blog Princess.

      I went to The Shark Show at The Parkside Lounge tonight. I showed-up blonde and confident but as you know that never lasts long. My friend Brian sucked a few comics dicks by telling them that he could hook them up with some cable access sounding MTV college campus show. He told me that he was unimpressed with my last show. I told him to lick me. If I'm so bad at stand-up then why do I do well in the toughest crowds?  I'm in the process of developing as a stand-up. It's a constantly evolving art form. You start off by writing material and performing. You hone, refine and re-write based on audience response. You judge yourself and go through periods of self- loathing that transcend the boundaries of self deprecation. Although you grew-up being the class clown you second guess yourself. You start validating random negative experiences. You think you can't do it... Compare yourself to others... All while willing them to fail. You may even take it one step further by torturing your friends with your insecurities. Not realizing that they themselves probably hate their cubicle jobs and wish they had a shard of your courageousness. You travel to a negative place. You try to make that dark place funny. But you can't.  The true essence of comedy or shall I get technical by saying the true essence of good joke writing comes from positive energy, spontaneity, truth and natural wit. It doesn't come from trying to out shine another comic. Nor does it come from trying to prove anything to anyone. The best comedy is something that say's "Here I am.... this is who I am." I want to let you in. I like you and want you to like me. I'm unabashed, intelligent, relatable and work hard to entertain both myself and you. I like and respect the other performers. I'm funny. Enjoy me. I do.  It's hard to keep a positive attitude. There's always someone out there that won't appreciate your work. These are always the people you'll hear criticism from. Chances are they have never tried doing what you do. That would put them in your position. A place they fear. A spot they wish they had what it took to stand in.    There's a lot to be said for comedy. There's even more to be said for someone who has the balls to do it.

      Do you one person that reads this know what a quasi is?   The true definition of a quasi (noun) is someone of the opposite sex that you are actively perusing that may or may not be returning your attention. EVERYONE HAS A QUASI at some point.   There's more to it e.g. "A quasi boyfriend" is someone that you hook-up and hang out&nbsp;with on a regular basis but you haven't had that talk yet... as in "The big scary chat" ..... There are only TWO outcomes after the chat... A) "Yes, we are dating! I really like you!" OR "No, I thought you understood... I'm not looking for anything."   Get it?   Anywho!!!! I met this guy through my old boss Sallie. He's forty-one so let's refer to him as "saggy balls." I took him apartment hunting and he rented nada. But he did take me out and we got trashed. After he downed one whiskey he started saying things like, "Sleep with me." as to which I replied, "OK!"   Turns out... the dude just got" Dear Johned" by his EX. so he wasn't in the best shape. What did I care?   A few days later....  &nbsp;he disappears and I learn that he rented a place through corporate housing. My question at that point was does he still want to wine and dine me? ;-)   So I took the hard core approach and e-mailed him. From that ensued quasi witty banter with the promise of "fun to come." However he wanted me to call him. I was all "FU saggy balls." (For about a week.... then I called. ) I left a message and he never called back. This is what went on:   Saggy balls is rebounding in a powerful way. He's a broken man. His pieces shattered by my hero (THE FEMME FATALE) more on her later. In essence, saggy would have bagged me- (if I hadn't waited so long) but his commitment potential would have been around&nbsp;zero.&nbsp;I would have spent many a night hearing stories about how his EX thought "that he didn't understand her" or that she "wasn't learned on politics and why did he bother." It would have been trying, but&nbsp;I would have endured it until I lined something younger and hotter up.   The reason sag doesn't jump and dial is that GUYS can go out one night and get a girl no problem... he's&nbsp;attractive enough to get a GIRL (who are always looking for a BOYFRIEND with cash&nbsp;flow, charm and&nbsp; A MEDICAL, DENTAL, EYE &nbsp;package) WOMEN on the other hand are in the vulnerable position... "Will he call?" and so on and so on?   What can I Lianne Stokes do to change this vicious pattern?   &nbsp;

      I'm a ritilin (sp?) &nbsp;kid so I thought it would do me fantastic to hop myself up on some Red Bull. Have any of you creeps ever drank Red Bull?... Mmmmmmmmmmmm.... I highly recommend it to calm the nervous system (wink). I downed a few and started sating things like "GET FIRED-UP!" Which I stole from that lame friend of&nbsp;Jessica's on "The Newlyweds."&nbsp; All in all it... give you some pep..&nbsp;However, &nbsp;I already have too much to begin with.   Last night I fell asleep watching an SNL rerun with those nitwits, the Olsen twins... Anyway I was jolted out of my sleep by my POUNDING HEART.. I mean... My ticker was going "bam, bam, bam..." My pulse wasn't that high when I used to spin... (for you broke losers spinning is exercise- the UMC choice method&nbsp;for pound dropping)   Moral of the story: stay away from energy drinks with synthetic bull testosterone.

      I'm having an extremely delayed reaction to Tony Randall's death. I was just enjoying my life, when it hit me. If I ever want to meet Tony... I couldn't. Tony is gone, people. Only re-runs can prop him up.   This is not to be interpreted as callus or insensitive. I'm being serious.   People who have died and I had little or no reaction:  Bob Hope Katherine Hepburn Rerun from "What's Happening?" and "What's happening now?"  Reason being, the first two were old and I never mentally connected with Rerun. But Tony, he had soul.   Soul I tell you.

      I've had a few. White wine is v. good. I'm sitting here with my sarcastic, bald friend, MarK (only French faggots spell it with a "C") I'm explaining to him how he can't drive home drunk. He replied, "Most of my trip is on the highway, what's the chance I'll hit a pedestrian?"   Smart Mark, very bright!

"Hommie cannot be callin' me, yo"  HILARIOUS!!!! I'll keep you updated. I must crack the case of this misguided whit chick.  What will Bill Cosby think about this??? TOO SHAME!!!!!!!

      I'm thinking that this "job" of mine is going to give me a ton of material. If it doesn't- I'm going to kill myself. I'm sitting next to achick that just finished eating a full on feta cheese salad complete with veggies and Italian dressing. What's so unusual about that? SHE ATE IT AT 10 AM!  Who the fuck eats a SMELLY ass feta (Spelling?) cheese salad for breakfast?  Who I ask! You can't tell but I am flailing my arms around and angry.  It stunk.  It gets better.. now she's eating a cookie. (It's not yet 11 AM).  She also lapses in and out out of a weird Brooklyn-type accent. I think she's from the wrong side of the tracks.  Kill me.

      I can't close the deal on this Woddy Allenish protype from my improv class. I'm all "Helllooo purr.." and he's all "What?"  Today I woke-up horrified. Why can't I close the deal? I looked in the mirror.. nope, I'm not a sea hag. I'm bright, funny marginally neurotic and cute as a fucking button. I am at my wits end. And I have a lot of wit.  There are guys that are out of my league... and this guy is not one of them. If anything I'm better looking than he is. I have ZERO DEALS. As you can tell, I am in what I describe as a desperate emotional state. I may as well be a fucking NUN! I should gain 100 pounds, paint my teeth brown and dress unstylishly. I'd probably bag more dudes.

      As the one of you may know... (Sid as well as Brian may be reading this) I am "in career transition" meaning... that I got a real estate license. Yay for me. This means that I am continually frustrated and make no money. Today I received the following e-mail! From it I learned that A) I will continue to make no money and B) People are both witty and hilarious overseas! I only read the last part in which he makes a "joke" about socks and then adds that his budget is $800. Have they ever heard of Sunnyside, Queens in Croatia?  Hi, Lianne! I`m a 26 yo molecular biologist, currently employed and working in Basel, Switzerland for a pharmaceutical company but coming from Croatia. In the beginning of September, I will start my PhD program at NYU, School of Medicine and I will be doing my research at the Musculoskeletal Research Center, Hospital for Joint Diseases on 14th street.. This is why this area is great for me. Unfortunately, I will be working here till the 25th of August and will be arriving to New York on 29th. I have booked a hotel for 3 days hoping I would be able to find something during this time. I'm a funny guy who enjoys a good laugh. I am very sociable, like to meet people and go out with my friends. Have only one criteria when judging people: they are either good and kind people or they are not. Everything else doesn't bother me. And that is it. Hope you got an idea of what kind of a person I am. Hope to hear from you soon! Best of luck and all the best, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research BaselNovartis Pharma AGWKL Basel / SwitzerlandTel.: Fax mail: P.S. I am sorry for asking you this but how much is the apartment? I would love you for the rest of my life if it's 800 dollars. I will take care of it for you and everything. Water your plants, clean the windows, wash your socks. Hhehehehehehe... I was joking about the socks! Sorry...
