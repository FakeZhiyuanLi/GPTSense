      I took some time to appreciate Memorial Day today, while I enjoyed quality time with my kids and family.   I look back at certain movies that came to my mind today.  'The Patriot' to see the deep resevoir of honor and dignity, and see the comarade in the movie 'We were soldiers' with awe.   Yesterday during church the theme of course was Memorial Day and the willing soldiers sacrifices so that others may live in peace. But the true story of Love was that of God giving his only begotten son as a ransom for our sin. To give ones life is to give ultimate love. Of course many know the story of Christ's willingness to die for our sins, but I do not think many actually understand why or truly appreciate the depth. In the book of John we learn that Christ is the only means to God and that path is truly narrow. This fact alone is the sole difference of Christianity compared to any other religion on earth. The fact we as mere mortals cannot equate or work our way through those pearly gates, yet God Himself created a means for us to live eternally with Him.   The fact if you were caught in a crime and stood before a Judge, would you expect the judge to actually let you go without punishment? If the judge had, he would not be a fair judge. God is not only fair but he is pure. He could not let a sinner go unpunish any more than any fair judge. We know in James if you broken just one of the laws, your as guilty as breaking all of the laws. That alone should make us shudder. Especially considering the fact everyone has broken at least one of the laws, most likely all of them. So upon the day of judgment will you bear your sins upon yourself and suffer eternal punishment for them, or would you rather have a representive take the stripes for you? Christ has already paid that penalty upon the cross. All we have to do is ask for him to take our burden and sins asking Him to take control of our lives and He will. Simple really, but so hard for so many. Check it out in the bible.   So today I acknowledge all of those fallen soldiers willing to shed their lives and blood to make this Nation great. But I more so acknowledge the blood shed by Christ to make this world so so miniscule compared to the wonders of life eternal with Him.

      I have just returned from a Buisiness trip Friday night and now it's already Sunday evening. Unbelievable how the week can be long yet 3 days fly like a 747 on crack. I just put my two kids to bed and figured I try this blogging out.   I initially started to see 'what the blog' is about blogging. Now I have a good idea. Basically blogger is a means for other people to find interest within this inside community. Fascinating, I checked out some other blogs of same interest and everyone seems to either a) post what is occuring in their lives or b) posting information in their work/home/area situations.   Now that I have an idea of what blogging is, I can safely continue forward and see if I acquire any interest in my mundane life.  :  )  I am currently reading Ed Sindson book on Revelation. It's a worthy book, I put him up there with John Hagee and that says alot since I have read many John Hagee books and find them to be to the point, yet understandble.   I am off for tomorrow, being memorial day, but I am also on-call from Saturday to Saturday( yes that means I got home Friday and started call the next morning ). I am hoping for a slow week in that regards, otherwise its going to be busy, busy.   The following week, we have vacation. My family and I will be going to St. Louis and I am sooooo looking forward to it. A week of no cell phones or on-call work.   I have to still catch up on the news, I understand the tornadoes rocked Oklahoma and Missouri. The Saudi Arabia hostages were released and John Kerry still double-talks.  I think I will go check some more blogging and see what I can find.

      Well, I seen it on tv and I read about them in the mags. Now it's time to get my hands on one. My first posting on the blog. Not too much but a 'Hello World'.   I named it 'My Worldview' because I wanted to express my viewpoints on a myriad of things in regards to how I see them. Everyone has their own view point, ie worldview, based upon their upbringing and chosen lifestyle, welcome to Middle_Americas world view.

      I haven't posted in a couple of days. The family and I haven't been gettig to bed before 11 or 12 at night and we just seem to run, run run.   My wife had her 30th birthday party yesterday. I planned it on her and I was glad to see alot of her friends come over. The kids played and swam, ect. Her dad grilled all day and made enough to feed an army. Polish sausage, smoked sausage, steak, burgers, hot dogs, bratwurst, ham, pork chops, and more. It was a huge success. I put a canopy in the back yard with plenty of chairs and her mom brought over teather ball. It was the first time I ever played it and believe me, it was more difficult than it looked. I got bopped in the head twice and it was moving fast. For those like me who never played; Its a teather ball on a rope tied to one pole. Basically two people play and each try to hit the ball to get it to wrap the pole all the way. Each person is attempting to hit the ball in the opposite direction. I think I lost on every game but one, but it was a blast.   I was thinking about something this weekend. Here is the scenario, a person who loves his house is getting new carpet. Now  when someone knows he/she is getting new carpet, wouldn't they be less worry of stains or a tear in it? Think about it, you are getting brand new carpet in one week and your kid (or someone else) spills something on it. You don't fret because you think 'Oh well, I am getting new carpet anyway, it's not such a big deal'. So you cover the bad stain with a rug or move furninture till the new carpet comes in.  Keep that in mind. Now a person's life expectancy is what, 70 at best, normally around 60? Ok, let's say 70. If you think in 70 years equals 70 days. So let's  say 70 days you will get new carpet. You know at first your going to take care of that carpet the first part of those 70 days. SO the first 35 days, you take care of this carpet then as you get toward the end you get a little less caring. A little blemish here, a little red stain there, the carpet gets a less newness on them. Do you see where I am going? If a Christian believes in the Bible literally, and asked Jesus to take their sins, accepting Him as their saviour, the christian would believe he/she was  going to receive eternal life, thus a new body. So why is the christian afraid of what  his/her body is looking like or the toll on it when they know they will be getting a new body. Christ said, our lives were but a shadow, basically this is nothing. But we tend to dwell too much on this body and life than the new one to come.   I didn't intend to really preach, but I couldn't help but think about this scenario during the weekend.  On a less deep discussion, I can't wait till DeadZone tonight. I missed most of it last weekend.

      I am starting to sound either like a repeater or a whiner. But today at work was a booger. I again started before 8 a.m. but this time actually got out around 5:20 p.m. I had a conference call this morning that was, putting it mildly, not pretty. The facility is freaking because we have continued issues on this lab upgrade. Not the fact we just got Micro's to post and was up till nearly 6 p.m. doing it. So with grace, I said we will work on the following a, b, c. So without further ado, after the call I called up Birava, (she works at the vendor((she and I are the one working on the interfaces))) and we start again. We two seem to be bonding after busting our asses together last week and this week. I have to admit she is new in her job as I am still kind of new in this lab interface. So it's been an education for both of us.   Anyway, we humped it working on the ORM's (orders from lab to the ordering system) issue. Seems that when they order, irregardless, it shows a time of 0000. Well we started to investigate this and low behold, this is happening on all of the facilities that was upgraded to the new lab system. Hell, it’s been a problem for the past 5 facilities and no-one even said anything. Grr, so we fix it right before 2 p.m. (our next big meeting for an update), it was drama again. That's why I asked is it already 2 p.m.? That meeting was hell compared to the mornings call.  She listed 3 issues remaining and wanted to hold off the live (bringing up the new lab system) next Tuesday. Well that didn't fly. The Lab Vendor already had 7 people flying out there for next weeks live and you know the tickets are non-reimbursable. So the facility was basically asked to hold off till tomorrow morning seeing how far we get today.   I ended up calling the same person at the facility to assist and we actually managed to correct all 3 issues remaining. Fortunately she commented on feeling better by the end of the day. We tested and fixed all we could with her, for the remaining time we had. Thus we were able to quit around 5:20 p.m.    After this I was able to eat. My lovely wife had supper waiting. Her day was hell as well. She had to run to and fro and ended up taking our son to therapy (as opposed to me), thus missing an appointment. Now she will have to keep it tomorrow and I have to take our son. But that's her, she's a giver.   My kiddos had to be at T-ball at 7 p.m for pictures. Only 2 more games to go. So they took their pictures and then the game at 8 p.m. With all the rain it was a muddy mess out there.   I didn’t get to see the game but my wife said it was good. My son made it all the way home. I think this was the only time, cool. Once they came home, we through them in showers, pajamas and into bed with a movie.   Now its 11 p.m. and I have to go watch Dead Zone since I missed it Sunday. :  ) Another late night. Bummer

      Just another manic Monday is right. Started work this morning before 8 a.m., didn't leave till nearly 6 p.m. I barely had time to mute my person on the phone while I had to go pee.   We have a live scheduled (hospital going up on a newer version of Lab system) next Monday. We been busting our butt's testing and trying to get this up and running. We finally been able to get the Micro's to display in the order screen. Man it was a booger. I will be glad when this live is over.   Kelli didn’t have much of a better one; she had to watch our 2 kids, plus our friends 2 kids most of the day after Vacation Bible School. In addition she taught Pre-K Vacation Bible School. I hadn’t had much time to talk to her but she said there were 2 devil spawned children in her class already. :   )  I didn't get into bed last night till 1 a.m. We made it to bed 15 minutes till midnight. I missed DeadZone! Ahh man, I caught the last 15 minutes of it by luck. I will try to watch the repeat Tuesday at 11 p.m. (Yes, I checked out  urlLink TV Guide.Com  for it. I see next Sunday they will spill the beans on his son. I tell you  urlLink Nixon ; I bet she is pregnant again.  Since I couldn’t get to sleep at midnight and it was too late to take Tylenol p.m.'s  : (   I found Farscape on  urlLink Scifi . So I got to watch Farscape, which it has been a long time, so that was cool.   The kids slept in the living room last night, around 12:30 a.m. (during a commercial) I went to check on them and my son was on the floor. I guess he fell off the couch. I put him on the smaller one.   I called my parents tonight and both were in a weird mood. I called my Dad and his mood was 'why don't you come over and visit me sometimes.' This from the guy that's been to my house maybe 5 times in the last 6 months. Seems he went to my brother’s house on a cookout and no-one to talk too. My brother kept himself busy and didn’t have time to converse.   My mom's deal was different. I called and talked to her and then she called me back about 30 minutes later. I guess she was lonely. I don't know. I don't have much of a relationship with them since I have a family of my own. It may sound crude. But realistically, if I don't call them, I wouldn’t have much contact from them, and it's not like we live that far apart either.    My poor wife. She has to work this evening. Fortunately, she can do alot of her paralegal work here at home, in the office. But it's a shame to be nearly 9 p.m. and non-stop.  For those thinking 'get off your butt and help!' I already asked. I don't have a clue of that stuff and I managed to vacuum, clean the remaining of the house. :  )

      Is it nearly 11 p.m. Sunday night yet? Great Scott where did the weekend go?  We jumped into Church this morning, being Sunday. I go to a Men’s Sunday School Class and somehow the hour was spent on the influence of the Muslim religion across the world in addition to our lesson.  Received a major blessing from our Church today, in which I will dedicate a post for it.   After Church, we ran to my wife’s parent’s house to help move some furniture. When we get there we ate lunch and I ended up helping put in a floor. Has anyone seen these ‘click and lock’ wooden floors? Basically you have a tongue on one end and a groove on the other. You place them in a 45 degree angle and lock the wood together. There are no seams to it. It went pretty quick after we got past the door hinge ECT. I had to bring the skill saw to do some trimming on the edges.   We also moved the furniture from one house to the other ECT. As we finished up my wife’s Brother came with a friend and fought with her mom. It boiled down to she been asking him to put up a ceiling fan on the same room we did the floor and he did not want to do it. You have to know the history and I am not getting into it now. So I started on the fan and he and his buddy was finishing it up when Kelli, kids and I split. We ran to the house, I showered while she got the kids ready and we ran back to Church. This next week is Vacation Bible School here and my wife is teaching the Pre-K. We were going to have a baptism but the lady did not make it in. So everyone worked on putting all the rooms together for the week. I was amazed how this Church went all out on Vacation Bible School.   We got home nearly 8 p.m. and bathed the kids, and let them do a sleepover in the living room. They crashed watching ‘Kim Possible A sitch in time’ again.  We are trying to catch up on laundry and some minimal cleaning up since we seem to run all weekend.   So it’s now 11:30 p.m. and we are about to hit the bed since we start all over again tomorrow.  Anyone reading this and is a dad, Happy Fathers Day.  Gotta at least tell you, the kids made me some homemade coupons. I received a coupon for a hug, a kiss, and to listen to my songs in the car. heh heh I also received the book 'The Purpose driven Life' by Rick Warren. I been wanting to read it because everyone that had or in the process said it was a really good book.

      Saturday we had a cookout here at home for Fathers day and asked both my parents, brother, friends, and wife’s parents, aunt, over. We expected around 12 people. For the morning, we got up and I managed to clean the bathrooms, vacuum/shampoo the carpets, and clean the floor. Put a tent up in the back yard, mowed the backyard (it was too wet but had to be done) but left the front untouched. I was trying to get everything ready to grill. We then went to T-ball prior to noon. The kids did well, in fact all of them. I played dugout dad. Amazing the hour went by quick when you keep the batting line in order and continue to tell 14 kids whose next up.   When we started back I noticed the black clouds coming our way and commented it might rain.   Headed home and started to grill. As I get started it started to splatter here and there with rain. Crap, got to move the grill and my stuff from the back to the garage. I get everything moved in and my father-in-law came up to help get the cooking started, and the rain starts coming in pretty good.   We cook regardless but during the cooking the rain becomes a storm and the streets look like a river. I had to literally move the grill and tables in a little because the wind was blowing so hard as to hit us with the rain. My family calls to cancel because they said it’s pissing and pouring and flooding outside where they are (parents are separated and two different locations). My brother ended up a no call/no show. My wife’s mom and aunt made it in, rain and all.   So we still had a good feast, bratwurst, polish and Italian sausage, 7 layer salad, spaghetti salad, hamburgers, hotdogs, corn on the cob and vegetables that was marinated in Italian dressing all night. I stuffed myself.   The rain finally stopped and Noah parked the ark. I find out today (Sunday) we had 3.5 to 4 inches in that 2 hour downpour.   The kids hadn’t been able to spend the night with their Nana and Papa so we let them go.  I asked my wife what she wanted to do tonight (it’s nearly 7 now) since we hadn't expected a night alone. 'I don't know, rest and relax.' was the answer. So I ran to the movie place to rent a couple of movies. We watched '50 first dates', with Drew Barrymore and Adam Sander, and then I watched 'Spartan', with Val Kilmer. Both ended up better than I thought they would be.   After that, we pretty much crashed. Real exciting, huh? But it was nice to be able to relax and simply watch a movie together.

      Senate Reportedly Sets Mid-July Vote on FMA By Susan Jones CNSNews.com Morning Editor June 16, 2004  (CNSNews.com) - It's not yet official, but press reports said the U.S. Senate is moving toward a July vote on the Federal Marriage Amendment.  Roll Call, a newspaper covering Capitol Hill, said the vote would happen in mid-July, just before the start of Democratic National Convention in Boston, Mass., where homosexual marriage is now legal.  The newspaper quoted Sen. Rick Santorum, the Republican Conference chairman, as saying that Republican leaders want a July vote, although they have not yet set a specific date.  American Values President Gary Bauer reportedly said the vote would happen on July 15. "We have one month to flood congressional offices with phone calls, letters and e-mails," WorldNetDaily quoted Bauer as saying.  In a press release dated Wednesday, the Alliance for Marriage said it "welcomed the announcement of a pending Senate vote" on the Federal Marriage Amendment in July.  "This marks the beginning of a democratic debate that the Alliance for Marriage hoped to create when we drafted the marriage amendment," said Matt Daniels, AFM president.  The group said its goal is to allow the critical issue of marriage ito be resolved democratically, rather than through the courts.  "Most Americans believe that gays and lesbians have a right to live as they choose. But they don't believe they have a right to redefine marriage for our entire society," said Daniels. "Americans want our laws to send a positive message to children about marriage, family and their future."  Daniels said a constitutional fix is necessary to solve the problems created by activist judges and agenda-driven lawsuits.  "AFM's marriage amendment has been introduced with bi-partisan sponsorship in two successive sessions of Congress in order to protect the common sense view of marriage shared by the vast majority of Americans of every race, color and creed."  AFM said its Federal Marriage Amendment will protect marriage, while leaving the issue of benefits to the states.  "AFM believes this centrist approach embodied in our amendment offers hope of a democratic resolution to a debate that has been forced on the American people by the courts."  The Federal Marriage Amendment reads, "Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the union between a man and a woman. Neither this constitution or the constitution of any state, nor state or federal law, shall be construed to require that marital status or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon unmarried couples or groups"  Some conservative groups reject the Federal Marriage Amendment as currently written. Concerned Women for America says it's important to do more than preserve marriage "in name only."  The group says same-sex partnerships should not be afforded the same benefits as married couples are.  "CWA opposes the Federal Marriage Amendment because it would not prevent state legislatures from recognizing and benefiting civil unions and other such relationships, which would result in legalized counterfeit marriage," the group's website says. ===================================================================================== Senate To Vote On Federal Marriage Amendment July 15 Democrats Support Homosexual Marriage, Vow To Kill Amendment Help send 1,000,000 letters of support for President Bush's efforts!   The U.S. Senate will vote on The Federal Marriage Amendment on or about July 15. I urge you to respond to the call of President Bush for support by helping send one million letters to the Senate. This will be the most letters ever received by the Senate on any issue.  Democratic leaders in the Senate, including Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschale and Senators Charles Schumer (NY), Barbara Boxer (CA), and Debbie Stabenow (MI) have promised homosexual leaders they will kill the amendment. Their action would allow one liberal, activist Federal judge to overturn all marriage laws and make homosexual marriage legal in all 50 states.  Some have referred to this as the most important vote in the history of our nation. If the homosexual activists and the Senate Democrats are successful, homosexual marriage will radically reshape our society. They will force acceptance of their lifestyle on the rest of society.  TIME FOR ACTION  Click  urlLink here  to send an e-mail to your Senators. This is very important. It is time for action if we want to keep marriage legal only between one man and one woman. Time is short. July 15 is the date for the vote.  We cannot secure those one million letters of support for President Bush without your help. PLEASE FORWARD THIS MESSAGE TO EVERY PERSON ON YOUR E-MAIL LIST. We must expand our base of support to reach our goal!  After forwarding to your e-mail list, please print this letter and distribute to your Sunday school class, church, clubs, etc. They can participate by visiting  urlLink www.afa.net . Help secure the one million letters!  Thanks for responding to President Bush's call for support.  Send your letter today!  Sincerely,  Don  Donald E. Wildmon, Founder and Chairman American Family Association

      Amazing how your spouse can make it all better. See today is also my Birthday and as I stated earlier, she made a great dinner. Well, she acquired for me the 3rd Lord of the Rings on DVD, Return of the King. So guess what I am watching tonight?   On top of that, she made a really delicious cake. It was better than sex cake, but with hardly no fat. Talk about moist and good. Mmm mmm   Yeah, she made it all better.

      Man, another Monday today, even if it was a Wed.. It started out with my wife unable to find her cell phone. She then took the 4 kids ( were watching 2 of them during the day ((nearly 6:30 p.m. and they are still here)) for the next couple of weeks). She calls me asking for a forgotten check here,from another mom. I said I would just take it there ( Basketball camp ). Well, after I spent 20 minutes trying to find the keys, I call her back. But she has my cell phone, and I cant remember my cell phone number.   No I don't call myself very often. I finally find the number in my PDA. I call her and guess what, yep, she has both sets of keys.   So she comes back home. During the time, I keep calling her cell phone to hear it ring. You would never guess where I found it, in the trunk of the car. Don't ask.  So she gets back, gets the check, cell phone, ect. and heads back to camp. I get back to work. I already had an 8 oclock conference call that lasted for an hour. I am on support this week, so that means any issues coming up during the day comes to me. Fortunately that  part was quite. I find out, I made a change to an interface, in production ie immediate effect, last night and my correction did not take place. Thus the on-call person got called at 1 a.m. and she wasnt happy, who happens to be my supervisor.   Its just 9:10 a.m.   It spirals from there. I worked on a interface testing it to go live in less than 2 weeks. Total frustration, in which I won't go into details. Let it just be known it sucks ok. I can't make the changes I need to because some Nimrod put the same transactions I need to change in live. So any changes I make will effect what is currently being used. Hence last nights episode.   I did manage to get out by 5 p.m., just one hour after I should be able to. I then vacuumed and put away clothes. My wife, bless her heart, made a great dinner. We had a big baked potatoe, steak smothered with mushrooms and vegetables.   I know her day was no better. She had to deal with the 4 kids, all day running to and fro. It's now 6:30 p.m. and I don't foresee the parents till a little after 7 p.m. So the evening is pretty much shot.   The rain finally quite and the sun is out, going down now. The grass is drenched and looks like it grew 3 inches today alone.

      Well it's already Wed., use to be called hump day. Last night the kids played their T-ball game, only 3 more to go. It was an 8 oclock game and I couldnt help but notice everyone looking at their watches 20 minutes prior of end game. The game last for 1 hour. Fortunately this is during Summer but it's taking a toll. The kids are still sleeping and it's nearly 8 a.m. Normally they would be up by 6:30 easily.   Had to take the trash out this morning and it's pouring down rain here. A couple of mothers, my wife included, was hoping the T-ball game would be rained out but it waited till early morning. Now it looks like a typhoon out there. I showered,ect already and after taking the trash out had to redress, being drenched. Oh well.   I appreciate everyone's feedback on the blog, it's nice to know I am not the only one insane. Yes, I am drinking my coffee already. And yes, yesterday, I continued to pee my brains out. If nothing else, my kidneys are getting a good cleansing.   Yesterday at work, it seemed like another Monday. Man it was crazy, I couldnt leave till after 6 p.m., starting at 8. It made for a long day but it went by pretty fast, due to the  busyness.

      Well it's Tuesday morning already and Monday wasn't too bad. Kelli (my beautiful wife) is watching a friends kids this next two weeks. So we have 4 in our house. This week is basketball camp that takes up 9 to 12 for these 5 days. Next week we have Vacation Bible School that will take up 8:30 to 12. This is one of the reasons Kelli is watching the other two kids. July schedule is crazy, I will have to post it separately.   Yesterday we started a diet. It actually isnt quote unquote a diet, rather watch what we eat and drink lots of water. I drunk 8 bottles of those bottle waters. Let me tell you, I thought I pee'd my brains out. Lucky I work at home and the bathroom is close. Supposedly, by drinking a certain amount of water (dependant upon your weight) it helps you loose your weight. I guess we will see, if I can hold on too it.   Don't get me wrong, it's not like I am obese, but I could lose some. I am 5'9", 180 pounds. So I am drinking my coffee and will hit water shortly. Gotta have the coffee first though. I drink Folgers, dark, black.   I also tried Pepsi Free this weekend. It wasn't bad. I ended up buying a six pack. I have been an avid Pepsi drinker for as long as I can recall. Supposedly this has the same taste  with half the sugar. It wasnt bad tasting, unlike those diet colas I tried. I can just taste that carcinogenic sacharrin in those (shudders).  Your probably reading this and thinking, this guys babbling but heh, I took tylenol PM last night to get some sleep and just drinking my coffee. No on-call this week! yeah !

      On Flag Day, Supreme Court Rejects Pledge Case By Susan Jones CNSNews.com Morning Editor June 14, 2004  (2nd Add: Includes comments by the Catholic League and Focus on the Family.)  (CNSNews.com) - It is okay for students to recite the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools. On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court Monday dismissed the case brought by atheist Michael Newdow.  The justices decided that Newdow lacked the legal standing to challenge the constitutionality of the Pledge, apparently since he does not have custody of his daughter.  Newdow sued the Elk Grove (Calif.) Unified School District on behalf of his daughter, saying she should not be forced to invoke God's name while reciting the Pledge at school.  Two years ago, a federal appeals court in San Francisco agreed with Newdow that reciting the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools was an unconstitutional "endorsement of religion" because of the phrase "one nation under God."   Writing for the three-judge panel, Judge Alfred T. Goodwin said, "A profession that we are a nation 'under God' is identical, for Establishment Clause purposes, to a profession that we are a nation 'under Jesus,' a nation 'under Vishnu,' a nation 'under Zeus,' or a nation 'under no god,' because none of these professions can be neutral with respect to religion."  By dismissing the appeal on a technicality, the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday disappointed some Americans who hoped for a definitive ruling.  "The Supreme Court's decision to reverse the 9th Circuit and uphold our national Pledge of Allegiance complete with the phrase 'one Nation under God' is a victory for common sense," said the Center for Individual Freedom. "Nevertheless, the Court's decision to turn back the challenge to the Pledge on technical grounds is disappointing given numerous justices' consistent approval of references to our nation's shared religious heritage and history."  The Center for Individual Freedom filed a brief with the Supreme Court arguing that the words 'one Nation under God' do not violate the Establishment Clause. The group argued that the Founding Fathers did not intend for the First Amendment to discriminate against religion.  "It was designed to ensure citizens could celebrate and practice their religion freely," the group said in a press release. "The Court should have taken this opportunity to reiterate what we all know to be true -- a public mention of the word 'God' does not violate the Constitution."  The Center for Individual Freedom calls it "appropriate and symbolic" that the Supreme Court dismissed the case on Flag Day, adding, "We just wish that the Court would have been more emphatic in its pronouncement."   The American Center for Law and Justice said the Supreme Court was right to dismiss Newdow's lawsuit.  "While the court did not address the merits of the case, it is clear that the Pledge of Allegiance and the words 'under God' can continue to be recited by students across America," said Jay Sekulow, chief counsel of the ACLJ, which also filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case.  "By dismissing this case and removing the appeals court decision, the Supreme Court has removed a dark cloud that has been hanging over one of the nation's most important and cherished traditions -- the ability of students across the nation to acknowledge the fact that our freedoms in this country come from God, not government."  Sekulow said it doesn't matter that the Supreme Court did not address the merits of the case: "The fact is the legally flawed decision of the appeals court is removed and students across America can begin the new school year in the fall by reciting the Pledge of Allegiance including the phrase 'under God.'   "The high court had several ways it could have disposed of this troubling decision and we're delighted that the suit has been dismissed and the Pledge remains intact."   "America's founders recognized that our rights, as the Declaration of Independence states, are 'endowed by the Creator.' In fact, they staked their 'lives, [their] fortunes and their sacred honor' on that truth," said John H. Whitehead, president of the Rutherford Institute.  "We had hoped that the Court would set the record straight once and for all by confirming the unequivocal affirmation of thirteen Supreme Court Justices across four decades that state-led recitation of 'under God' in the Pledge of Allegiance does not violate the Establishment Clause," he said.  "While we are pleased that this time-honored tradition can continue, The Rutherford Institute remains committed to standing in defense of the constitutionality of this practice should any future challenges arise," Whitehead said.  "It is too bad that the substantive issue of whether recitations of the Pledge in school are legal wasn't addressed. It is regrettable only because there is a concerted effort in this country, led by organizations that are openly hostile to religion, to eliminate all public vestiges of our religious heritage," said Catholic League President William Donohue.  "This movement, which is at root totalitarian, seeks to impose a radical secular agenda on all Americans. It must be stopped dead in its tracks if religious liberty is to survive," Donohue. "This is not a good day for the radical secularists. Which is why it is such a good day for everyone else."  "Yet again, a ruling of the 9th Circuit - the most overturned circuit court in the nation - has been voided," said Focus on the Family Chairman Dr. James C. Dobson.  "However, the Supreme Court does not emerge from this case the defender of America's moral and Christian heritage - in fact, it showed a lack of principle that is truly appalling," said Dobson.  "Instead of settling this question once and for all, the Court has left the nation to wonder if God's name will be found unconstitutional if another challenge is brought in a procedurally correct fashion," he said.  "By refusing to rule on the substance of the case, the Supreme Court has left the door open for additional challenges to our nation's godly foundation - one which is reflected on our currency, in our government buildings - including the Supreme Court's own chamber - and in the oaths we take," Dobson added.

      Man, the show was cool. Looks like this season will be the season of drawing the lines. Everyone seems to be making a choice on whom to stand by.   Can't wait to see next weeks episode of Johnny's accident. Also looks like the blonde chick is in it for awhile on the season. She will be Johnnys new babe. I am also glad to see Walt taking a stand on Sarah, make a decision. Too bad the kids in the middle.   For those not watching the show, you missing out. Looks like this season the plots are a bit more complicated and that, too me, is good.

      Another factually intersting email I received. ------------- BBBSA's Inclusion of Homosexuals Causes Insurance Woes  By AFA Journal June 10, 2004  (AgapePress) - One of the nation's largest mentoring organizations is discovering that some of its chapters are having trouble getting liability insurance because they allow homosexuals to be mentors for kids.  According to Family News in Focus, several chapters of Big Brothers Big Sisters of America (BBBSA) may be forced to shut down because insurance companies are charging higher premiums or even refusing to write policies because of the "gay" mentors.  In 2002, BBBSA began requiring its chapters to allow open homosexuals to serve as mentors for children participating in its programs. That policy -- especially in light of the Catholic Church's sex abuse scandal -- has led to a hesitancy on the part of some insurers to do business as usual with BBBSA..  Joan McPheron, a director for one BBBSA chapter, told Family News, "Of course, bottom line, the homosexual issue does come into play. Because we're working with kids ... we're dealing with possible abuse issues. [Insurers] recommend at least a million dollars to two million dollars coverage."  Rob Paris, who is a risk management specialist, said, "When you put a child with a known homosexual as a mentor, that would be [an additional] risk factor that the insurance company would take into consideration."  Paris said some insurance companies will not insure the chapters at any price because of the homosexual factor.

      I received this via email and found it interesting. So I thought to post in my blog.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Gay And Lesbian Medical Association Lists Homosexual Ailments Date: Thursday, August 08 @ 20:42:30 CDT Topic: Diseases  The Gay And Lesbian Medical Association (GLMA) has just published a list of diseases and social pathologies that afflict those who engage in homosexual conduct.  According to the Gay And Lesbian Medical Association, men and women who engage in homosexual behaviors are at greater risk of a series of diseases and mental problems than are heterosexuals. These risks include: HIV/AIDS; substance abuse; depression/anxiety; STDs; prostate/testicular/colon cancer; alcohol and tobacco abuse; gynecological cancer; domestic violence; heart problems; osteoporosis; breast cancer and more.  Instead of discouraging these behaviors, however, the GLMA simply encourages health care providers to be aware of these diseases, addictions, and mental health problems.  If your school is pushing the homosexual agenda, school officials may wish to read about the dangerous health consequences of promoting sodomy among teenagers. GLMA has published reports on homosexual males and females. To access this information, go to:  urlLink http://www.glma.org .

      Survived the day.   The kids did great at T-ball. One kid, on the opposite team, actually did a 3 play. He caught the ball, tagged two out. wow, these are 5-6 year olds. Then our side turned around and made 3 outs with no one coming home. "Is that our team?" I heard a mom asked.    We also made it through the first part of the first Birthday then the full second one. There were 2 at the same time. The first one at 4 then the second at 4:30. We went to the first one for 20-30 minutes. This made the birthday boys mom happy and the kids got to play together for a bit. We then proceeded to the second one and the kids got to play in a  pool, played limbo and hit a penyata. The thing had to be made of iron. There were about 13 kids and each had first 2 hits a piece, then 3,4,5 hits a piece in turn. The thing didnt bust. 2 moms finally beat the hell out of it and it cracked open.   One thing that did disturb me though. The group of the second party ( hosts friends ) were  pretty  much too themselves. Kelli and I basically stood together enjoying the kids playing and one couple actually attempted a discussion. The host were fine and they also discussed but I could not help notice the other 3 couples staying to their group. Anyway, my wife said remind me to tell you the story of that one. Seems that these 2 particular couples wanted to have a baby at the same time. So in doing so, unfortunately one had miscarriaged, so the other mom-to-be had evidently 'taken pills' so she in turn miscarriaged. I couldnt believe it. Then I was told this occured 3 times. Finally both had kids. I was pretty much disgusted with that thought.   But all in all, the kids enjoyed it and that's what counts. I plan to watch my Quantum Leap tonight and we have Church tomorrow. My wife is doing her womans sunday school and  she allowed me to read it. I was very impressed. I told her it was very well done.   Oh and we plan on starting a diet Monday. She has been on and off one and has done extremely well. I on the other hand have always said, I need to. Well, I am actually going to go the mile and work with her on this turn. So for tonight and tommorrow I am stuffing the pepsi and doritas, but Monday brings showtime.

      I can't believe it's already Saturday, where did the week go? I got up early to mow the yard ( mine and my neighbors since she has moved off and continue to try to sell her house ). I was able to get hers done as well as my front and sides. I still need to do the back,   but I was already sweating profusely by the end and it wasnt even 9 a.m.. Man, its already  hot.   The kids have T-ball game at noon and a birthday party to go to around 4:30 this evening, so the day is already shot. I did manage to get some corner shelves up for my wife, Bob Villa I am not, but they did remain level.   Yes, I am drying our last load of clothes, run a load of dishes and managed to vacuum the house. So all in all I did get some stuff done this morning.  I haven't had a chance to watch my Quantum Leap yet. I fell out last night after watching G4, a gamers review on tech tv. I did see one part, a behind the scenses of Quantum Leap yesterday while I was folding clothes.   My wife told me she seen Quantum Leap at Walmart for 50 bucks. So I did manage to find it pretty cheap at Target.

      Man, it was nice in my own bed last night. I made the kids sleep in their own bed as well. They wanted a sleepover in the living room but I said nada, considering it was already after 10 p.m.   I asked them this morning and they seem to sleep good as well. I think I will try to go watch shrek 2 with them today. Kelli (wife) has to go into work for some time today, I personally dare not even look at my buisiness email yet, as I will feel like I will have to do work. So rather than have the feeling we are home, ok vacation is over, I am going to try to keep us going on the good times. Reality is all too near in the future, back to the ball and grime, penny pinching, you get the drill.   I checked Yahoo on Shrek 2 reviews and see that most state the story was half way done as the first, but I think the kids will love it anyway.   I still havent had a chance to check out Quantum Leap. I will probably watch that tonight when everyone else crashes. Currently catching up on Laundry from the trip. We pretty much  have everything else put away. Since we cleaned the house real good prior of leaving for the trip, we didnt have a messy house to come home to, which was nice.   We will also get our dogs back today. Our Aunt babysitted them while we were away.   Better go fix some breakfast, my son already is watching the DinoThunder PowerRanger dvd again.

      Finally home and glad of it. The trip was fast and furious but we were able to do alot of things. We seen the Arch, Zoo, Malls, ect. I was also impressed with the little things on the way, such as the beautiful scene of trees and mountains. It was a nice drive, long but nice.  After we left St. Louis this morning we stopped again in Springville (mid-way point) and found a 'An American Pizza Place', I think. It was a happening place, we ate the buffet and played the games. It made a nice break from the drive and then we pushed on. So now its 11 p.m. here and by the Grace of God no wrecks, accidents, suicide bombers, ect.

      I had to say it. Quantum Leap got my money. I hit a Target here in St. Louis and they had the Quantum Leap first season DVD set. I couldnt restrain myself. I had to have it. It was  39.99, more than I normally spend on anything but I kept saying to myself ' I am on vacation, I am on vacation.' heh heh The mantra helped. I also ended up buying my daughter the 'Kim Possible, A stitch in Time' dvd. I with them love to watch Kim Possible. We hit the zoo today and was able to see a real naked mole rat. : )   Anyway, Sam Goodys in the mall wanted Quantum Leap for 59.99 so that helped me a little bit in my spending. I am on vacation, I am on vacation.....

      Ahh, I was able to see The Deadzone on USA. The premier was good. Looks like they shifted his psychic ability on hyper-drive. Now he is losing his own memories and time as he views  the dreaded future. Man, it was good. But it looks like a two parter. The next one will be  the followup of this one. Can't wait to see it.   Quantum Leap on DVD ! I couldn't believe it. The first season of Quantum Leap starring Scott Bakula and Dean Stockwell is now on DVD. Man, I grew up with this show! I have added  it on my list of interest. Now I am torned which to buy, the second season of The Dead Zone or the 1st season of Quantum Leap. grrr. Too many DVD's are coming out. A guy doesnt have enough money to keep up with them. I stil haven't bought any Farscape DVD's either and loved that show. Those are too expensive for me. But Quantum Leap and Deadzone, I can probably muster up for. :  )  Never heard of Quantum Leap? The Scifi  urlLink link is here .  You can check it out.

      Vacation finally here. We left Sunday morning and drove to Springfield, MO. first, half-way to St. Louis.  On the way we stopped at 'Precious Moments Chapel' and took the free tour. It was a good stop and let us stretch our legs. The Chapel was immaculate. Not very big but the paintings were unbelievably beautifull. It was definitely off the beaten path but it was a nice place.   We also were on the look out for cops. Can't help it, driving for so long on these kind of trip. I rarely seen one, unless he had some poor slob over on the road. We passed one poor soul and noticed his buddy was also ahead on the side of the road waiting for him. The truck then later on down the road zoomed passed us, evidently not learning his lesson. "Nuts" My wife noticed it was the same truck that was just getting a ticket then I noticed his bumper sticker and understood why. The poor soul was an idiot and crazy driver. The bumper sticker? " Vote for Kerry "  We stayed over at a hotel while we checked some of the stores there. The kids was able to play in the pool for a little bit that night. I visited the 'Bass Pro Shop'. I haven't fished nor hunted in years but we were told we had to check it out. It was really cool. They had everything imaginable in there. All forms of stuffed animals mounted, including a large bear you could take a picture with. A stream literally ran through the store with live fish, ducks ect. Nothing like I expected. The place was HUGE. We had to hit  a Target and ate at Ruby Tuesday's since we don't have that restruant around our place.  The next morning we hit the road early and drove on into St. Louis. It's the first time any of my family been here, so were all psyched. I had to come through the airport on the way to Pennsylvania a couple of times , but that doesnt count. We found the hotel and were meeting some friends here as well. They drove in from up north so were looking forward to it. I personally just enjoy being away from work and house.  We plan to see the arch tomorrow and go up into it. We have a pretty good view of the arch from our 5th floor and the hotel is nice. I will try to post a pic or two of it. I plan to take alot of digital pics as I have a 64 mg card and my PC. So I can continue to  download and clean my card througout these days of vacation. Its 9:17 p.m. and the wife and kids are already out. The kids played hard and wore us out. heh heh

      Since the kids had the sleep over last night most were cranky this morning. As I stated in a previous post my wife kept entertaining them till the parents came. Amazing the attention span of kids now-a-days are about the size of nats.   The last parent picked the last kid up around 9:30 a.m. and stayed around for about 40 minutes. Once she split, while her child was whining about the shoes not being comfortable, we made a list for me to run errands. I had to take a couple things back from Walgreens and Walmart plus pick up some last minute items.   We managed to keep the kids awake till early evening and we all went to bed early. I took some Nyquil which kicked my butt. I was out before 9 p.m. The kids were out about 6 minutes after they hit the bed which was actually a few before 8 p.m.   It just hit 1 a.m. here and I am finished with my on-call phone call for the night. The new hospital OPUS ( a operating vendor ) was down and finally came up and operational. My on-call ends in the morning, about 8 hours from now. Man I can't wait. I been on-call since last Saturday and I am ready to give it to someone else. I also start vacation as of Sunday morning as well. Technically its Monday, but since I am off call Sunday, I am calling it then.  While I was waiting for OPUS to call me back (after I paged them ) initially, I found myself reading other people blogs again. I guess I am officially hooked on other peoples lives. Geez, I thought my wife was bad watching 'E-Entertainment'. Oh well, guess there could be worse things in life.  Guess, I been my office long enough, my boy just came in about 1:10 a.m. to tell me the movies over. Yeah, been over buddy. He wanted some water. Poor guy, my wife and I let the kids watch a movie at bedtime tonight since they both were exhausted. They crashed hard, now after 1 a.m he lets me know the movie was over. heh heh   I better get back to bed, gotta long drive in the morning.

      I figured it's bound to happen but it seems closer than I thought.  Seems Viacom's MTV and Showtime discussing to launch this year. I guess my question is why? When I view nightly programming, in nearly every series I came across there are already is one or more gay characters. Some shows are already built around this lifestyle, like 5 gays helping a straight slob. So what is the big deal?    TV Guide quoted media stock analyst Tom Wolzien of Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. as saying, "It's about time somebody had gone after that audience with a [cable] network. ... It's an important segment of the audience that has traditionally been under-served. The money is certainly there to support it."  Article found  urlLink here .  Say what? Disney has  urlLink gay days , Rosie Odonnell is creating an all  urlLink gay cruise . All in the attempt to tap into this supposedly reservoir of money. No I think it's more than that. Since the media outlet, tv in general are already pushing the lifestyle containing 2 percent of our nations population, I really don't see a need for it. Already it's bringing controversy, which I suspect is the primary reason they mention it. 'Will this fly?'  Since Orielly generally blasts MTV for their degrading music this cannot help their PR. Many believe MTV has lost its true touch since the 80's when they went to reality tv and games. Showtime already hosts a number of 'gay' shows including, Queer as folk, The L word. So it's not really surprising.    Family advocacy groups are already putting in place a means to speak out about this.     urlLink AFA  a constituent of Family values has a poll concerning this already.  " MTV — the network which brought us the infamous Super Bowl halftime show — has announced that they are beginning a cable TV network to push the homosexual agenda. The new network will be supported by advertising and will be offered as part of the "basic" package of cable networks"  I also recommend you to check out  urlLink Traditional Values Coalition  that has some  good articles, ect.      More articles on this can be found at the following links.  urlLink CBS    urlLink Boston    urlLink CNN

      Yes, I do actually watch the Dead Zone on USA. I came across this show about 1.5 years ago by accident and was hooked. USA had a special Deadzone marathon that I was able to tape one weekend to catch up on the first season I missed. Since that time I have seen all of them. My wife even bought the 1st season DVD set for me on Valentines day this year. I see  that the second season is being release June 8th. Wife if you read this, hint hint. ; )  The official Dead Zone webpage is  urlLink Here . I try to watch this and Monk. Not much else on the television for me, other than Fox News and The Orielly Factor.  So those that don't have a clue on this show then check the website and go find the Season one at blockbuster or something. heh heh

      We survived a night of another slumber party. This one wasnt as draining. We actually had a childs parents stay with us most of the evening. We had one before of 13 girls ( or was it 14 ), now that was work. I was going to bail on that one, when one of my wifes friends was going to help out. She canceled and I had to stay. I got caught in the kitchen corner once and had to tickle my way out. :  )   You have to understand these are 5-6 year olds.   Anyway last night I continue to be amazed of the dichotomy of each kids personality. A couple of them are wilder than a march hare and the other 2 were calm and quit. But they all seem to get along well. My 5 year old son loved it of course. My wife really enjoy these. I at times cannot tell who is having more fun she or the kids.  Can we say...the energy one has bounces off the other ? Man they are hyper together. Usually one or two never wants to go to sleep. Last night was not different, 2 first kept talking and playing, while the others started falling out. Finally at around 11:30 p.m. I just said 'OK, after this movie we are turning it off.' One was still awake after the movie.  I crashed and was only called by work once last night around 12:10 a.m. which was good.   So yeah, I am drinking the coffee this morning and we are waiting till 9 a.m. central for the parents to come pick them up. My wife continues to entertain this morning. We woke up around 6 a.m. and bless my wifes heart, she has allergies that are rocking her and she already done all their hair, breakfast, played Disney UNO, shall I go on?  Is it 9 yet?  heh heh  ( Yes, I snuck away for a bit to write this. Oh God, they found me........

      I understand these blogs can be a means of information as I look through some other blogs. But others I ran across is what my wife kindly refers to as an online diary.   I was captivated by a simple blog that I began reading. Basically she was just speaking of her day to day happenings, as I have begun to do and I kept get this feeling of being a peeping tom.   Any others ever catch that? Please comment I would be interested in your thoughts on this matter.

      Anyone been on-call recognizes the fact that you have it hovering over you. Never knowing when that cursed beeper/cell phone will ring. I have a work cell phone they contact me and last night, contact me they did. I got a call every 1.5 hours. I kid you not. Now, the issues were trivial in correcting thankfully, but the fact is everytime I would get about asleep the phone would ring. I am a light sleeper anyway and it takes me awhile to get back to sleep. So I had plenty of coffee this morning and my patience is short today. I did manage to mow the yard this evening. My daughter has a slumber party tomorrow night and we are getting prepared. I have 3 more nights on call and then I am off for a week, vacation. I am counting them down.   Just to let you know what exactly I had to do during on-call. I work for a company that owns and operates hospitals/facilities.  I work in the interface group and when a interface goes down, specifically a critical one (Radiology, Pharmacy, Lab, ect.) then I get called to get it going again. This normally only entails me to recycle (start/stop) my side and then have the facilty or vendor to recycle their side. But it takes time to first page the other then wait for the call back, then request that individual to recycle their side. In all it can take over an hour, depending on how quick the other person is. So when I say I got a call every other hour, I really mean, I got little sleep last night.

      I have to speak about Wed. As you know my daughter had to go to the second dentist Wed. Seems on the Tuesday visit a tooth was found to be absessed, how? According to them sinus alergies and infections. Seems the sinus's lie above your upper teeth  and can effect them. Well, it effected this one. Not going into too much detail. Seems that rather than them working on the one, they had to also work on the two beside it, 3 in all. Mind you she is 6. The Dr. said she had strong good teeth, but this one got problems. At first he didnt think it was even abcess (the first dentist referred her to this one stating abcess tooth). He was going to just shrug it off since it did not appear abcess nor tender, ect. Then he decided to go ahead and drill in, that's when he noticed no blood. Evidently this is not a good sign. The news became worse, from a simple dentist exam to a referral, now we are told the tooth was so badly absessed they contemplated on outpatient surgery on it for Friday, fearing they may not have been able to save it. Seems the infection was so bad, the possibilty of an absess to the brain was high. My wife was freaking. She was giving me phone call after phone call as the information poured in during everyin 5 minute interval. On top of this, the visit costed 385 bucks, our payment. Total was 850 bucks but insurance would pay most. They were on the phone with our insurance getting an amount. Man, you talk about sucking. Not only was they in there for 2 hours after one hour waiting, now were told cough up the 385, given we could write a post check.    After all this, comes the silver lining from this storm. 1) The fact that my daughter was under a severe infection we were not even aware of. This caught it while we were home, rather than on our vacation trip next week. 2) Somehow, ( Gotta be God because my wife was actually praying during this with one of the dentist attendant) without my wife asking the Dentist decided to give us a discount, cutting off some of the cost. The 385 went down to 250 due. My wifes dad said he had it and would give it to us, he was at my house during all this, coming over from work and wrote out a check for my wife to deposit it covering our expenses. And get this, this assistant placed it in the computer to always give us this same discount, for all future visits.  So yes, there was indeed a silver lining yesterday and man, was I glad of it. And yes, I did think my God.

      Man I thought the weekend was busy. Tuesday is a distant memory now but allow me to quickly grab your hand and fly you through our Tuesday.   I had to take 1/2 day off that morning because my wife had to be in 3 places at once. She can usually pull off 2 places, but this was a bit much. I took my son to therapy, toting my daugher with me at the 9:30 a.m. Note I cleaned up the house prior to because I had to wait till 9 to start that way. My wife had already left at 6 a.m. for work to get as much done as possible.  After therapy, I then proceeded taking the kids to a Dr. appointment for them and my wife ( 10:15 a.m. ) as the three did that, I ran over to a nearby barber to cut the hair. We then met over, across town to a pizza place to meet with my wifes dad to have lunch, (11:00 a.m.). We had a good lunch together the I took my son home ( schools out for the summer ) as my wife took our daughter to her dentist appointment (around 12 p.m. now). OK we get home, the boy and I. He wanted to play play play (he's 5) and I basically say, what movie you want to watch, Dad's gotta go to work ( I work remote out of the house, gotta love the net). I start the Power Rangers movie for him and start checking my buisiness email. Man, of course everyone wants something, yesterday.  Needless to say, I was there till 8 p.m. My wife came home around 4 p.m. and brought dinner with her. She then took our daughter off to T-ball for an 8 p.m. game. The boy stayed with me because he did not feel well.   I hate days like these, non-stop action but man it gets old.  My boy fell out (asleep) before my wife and daughter came back and I threw our daughter into the shower into bed as soon as they arrived home at 9:30 p.m.  That was my Tuesday and yes, it flew.

      Been a bit for me to write in my blog. My plane was scheduled to go out 8:30 a.m. but due to maintenence issues it was delayed. At 9:30 they said it would be 11 a.m. before takeoff. So I ran to a TGIF within the Airport to get something to eat. We were able to get out of there by 10:30 but I missed my connection in Dallas. Fortunately I was able to get on the last flight out. I arrived home around 4:30 p.m. Once I was in the airport, I received a call from work. Already a couple of issues. So I basically hit the house and started working. After a couple of hours I was able to be with the kids.   I will say on the way back (Dallas/Fort Smith flight), I happen to sit with an intereesting lady. She worked for the Immigration Services and had an interesting history. She informed me of all the gangs in our area, drug trafficking ect.   Saturday morning, my wife had the yard sale. It was a good one and we did pretty darn good. She even passed a couple of Bush-Cheyney stickers! heh heh  During the yard sale, our friends and their kids came over. So my buddy and I took the kids to Mcdonalds to let them play and eat lunch there, while the ladies (our wives) tended the yard sale and have some time together. The kids had a blast and it was indoors away from the heat.   One the way to Miki-D's I stopped by the Republican Headquarters. Dick Cheyney is speaking in Fort Smith on Tuesday! The tickets were free, but you had to give your name and social to get one. I plan to go listen to him on Tuesday. I figured it was the only time I would get to see the guy so close.   After the yard sale, we all crashed for an hour. We went to my brothers birthday party. He knew about it but I grabbed him and one of his boys. My son, brother and his son went to my dads for a bit. We grabbed about 6 pizzas and headed back. It was ok, not many showed up but at least he had a 31 yr birthday party.   It's already 8:30 p.m. and the day is gone. It was nice not being on-call today, but I retain it for tomorrow. The kids already had their showers and currently watching a Mary-Kate Ashley movie eating snacks. I look forward to sleeping in my bed again tonight. Last night I didn't even need tylenol p.m.

      I actually was impressed with tonights DNC speaking. I wa able to start watching while the daughters were speaking. Alot of promises were made, alot and I mean alot was themed around his Vietnam experience. In fact it seemed the main theme. Kerry even came out and after the 'thank you's' he saluted in front of the camera and said he is ready to serve. Nice. I was impressed with his speech. Many thought he would be a  bit mumbo jumbo, but I didn't find him to be that. But I also have to say, the whole week seemed a bit like a used car salesperson ramping up a good cheer to sell the car. But Kerry seemed to rev pretty good tonight. I still was waiting to hear what Kerry had done in the last few years while in Senate. I honor his experience as a Veteren, as I do all Veterens, my dad included. Yet, I never did hear of his accomplishments to assist the military veterens while in the office. I did find a link of some of his Senate history.  urlLink Who is John Kerry   Today was a good day. I felt I was able to get some things done at work, and I was able to eat with supervisor/peer this evening. I had a good chat with her. It was nice to just sit and talk rather than grab togo and back in the hotel. I will return back to PA in November. I fly out early tomorrow morning and I will be glad to get home. I really miss the family and will be glad to be in my own bed. :  )

      Ever notice the phone rings just when your pee'ing? Aye. I am still on-call and you know it, nothing till I go pee and then the cell rings. Well, their just going to have to wait, or leave a VM.  Finished hearing Edwards speech. I figured he would be articulate being a lawyer. I found it interesting his 'hey, were not being hate-mongers, but you just wait to hear the attacks on us'. Gee, must had missed all the retorts from the liberal Senator's. He must had missed out on all those attacks this year, and the many conversations of no more bush bashing in this DNC. He sounds clueless to me. I also noted he said basically word by word, "we will hunt down AlQueda and kill them" as Bush had been promising from  9-11 till present, and he has been doing so throughout. Basically, I heard him saying we will be one america not a racial america. Not that the black americans are far better off during this adminstration than any in the past. But that's just the facts.   I may seem bias, but I have to say. I dont like all that Bush is doing, but the main question that should be on everyones mind is, which candidate would be best to serve us during this war. Personally, I think it will be Bush. I will say again. The ideology of trying to bring in our so-called allies back to our way of thinking, helping us, ect. just doesn't jive. Trust me people, the fence is being dismantled and side-straddling is no long an option. Everyone needs to make a choice and those like France, Germany, ect. has already made their choice of not being our allies.

      Spent all day today in being educated on the 'BeyondFTP' at Corporate. It was an all day thing. But it looked impressive. The individual that set it up basically wants to reaaaalllllyyy hand off the support to us (interface team). Guess who will be the person working mostly in it? Yep, yours truly. I am starting to feel like my hand is being in every part of this place. Oh well. To be fair, every team ( foundations, BOS, Orders, Interface, ect ) is feeling overwhelmed.   I was able to sit and eat with two of my peers. It was nice to just sit and chat. Sure most of it was about work, some frustrations. But I was able to get some personal information time to time. It was nice to get to actually know those I work with day to day. We ate at 'The Cheescake Factory' and I had a spicy cajun jumbali. It was good.  I guess, I will watch Edwards speech tonight.   I did manage to call the Election Board back in Oklahoma before it closed and found out that Tom Coburn, did win the Republican primary. I was a bit surprised, but pleased. So in November, it will be Tom Coburn against Brad Carson for Don Nickles seat. Nickles will not run again, so it will be important. There is also an Independant that will be on the ballot, but I don't see that happening.   My wife is thinking not to leave for Texas in the next weekend, not this coming. So we will see. I know I am still ready to get home, tonight and tomorrow night is left.  Sitting here eating a bit of my Dark Chocolate bar adn flipping the tv from Fox News to around the other channels. I am also rolling through the net.

      Another day in the neighborhood. I took a couple of tylenol p.m. last night so, yes, I was able to sleep. Fortunately only one issue last night for support. A circuit went out that wiped out all Quest interfaces. This effected over 4 hospitals (on quest).   Seen on this mornings Fox News 35 bloggers are at the DNC party this week. Fox spoke with one of them. He wasn't to articulate but he did manage to state the fact that it is a persons unedited form of journalism.  I did get to see the discussion of Michael Moore and Bill Orielly last night. Talk about two separate worldviews. The discussion was basically like a hot potatoe being passed back and forth. Seems the only way Bill was able to get Michael to speak was to corner him and they did it that same time. I think Bill won the argument.   51 people killed in a car bombing in Iraq this morning in Bakubah. It was so bad, to effect 6 buildings. How horrible for those over there. I wonder if it will be brought up in the DNC, or will it be off their radar.   I am still waiting to hear a 'why' we should vote for Kerry. Seems they are not so much as making it a dichotomy of Kerry-Bush, rather Democratic-Republican. I think the non-bashing is baffling the news people, but I am not really surprised. Don't they recall Bush has been saying you can't run a Nation on hate. ( because of all the Bush bashing this year ) So it only makes sense they are trying their best not to present themselves as hate-mongers. Too me its too late. But I am sure there are those out there that will be duped. I get excited to hear people up here in PA that sees the facts, but amazed at some that still believe in the craziness of the liberal ideology.  Hopefully tonight I can sit with a peer for a dinner. He is also remote and in this week.

      Ever had a sucky day? Well, mine was close. Had meetings all day, did a traing on VPS (Virtual Printer Server) to my peers. Needless to say, it was long, non-productive today. I was glad to get out and hit the Hotel room. I guess some enjoy to get out and hit the town, run around ect. But I personally much rather sit quitely here and watch a movie in peace.  I will be in training all day tomorrow. We are to be shown a new FTP server and this guy wants to hand the support over to the team. yeah.  I am tired and ready to go home. 2 with 3 nights to go.

      Well all, its Tuesday morning and another day at the grime. Of course the news is all around the DNC party in Boston. I had to run a script last night that took bloody forever, so I didn't get into bed till after 1 a.m. So I watched mostly the news, seeing what the Demo's had to say in 'why should I vote for Kerry'.   Now most that are getting to know me would say that I am already biased, but polls show  most of the U.S. have already made their decision anyway as well. So in my view what did the cheerleaders have to say? Actually I agree that Bill Clinton was the most articulate, clear speaker for the night. I also agree what they say in regards to 'agree or disagree with Clintons politics, he's a great speaker'. But, through all the chanting, cheerleading, ect. I never heard a 'why should I vote for Kerry.'  I know, this DNC was not to do a "Bush bashing" but a 'why should I vote for Kerry'. I thought Clinton did the best attempt in what makes Demo's and Repub's different in worldviews. ( interesting he actually used the term worldviews ). But I never heard what Kerry would do diferently or what he would do now too help/raise America back on  it's feet. But I have to make a notation that they are not using the name "Bush" for bashing but they are definitely slicing/dicing the 'current adminastration and republicans'.  Now yesterday during work here at PA Corporate, I had a small discussion with a couple of guys. During conversation another individual approached and basically asked me, 'do you think they (the democrats, ect) are voting agains Bush due to hatred or the fact he is doing such a terrible job.' I promptly looked him in the eye and said 'easily, hatred'. Of course he retorted that the Iraq war was all a lie, dah dah dah.  It wasn't hard to see he was a 'left wing liberal'. I am not going into the discussion but I will say, he left mumbling. One of the guys ( in the original conversation ) came to my cubicle and actually said 'that was great' and he had prior  discussions with the liberal guy and he just didn't know as much as I did on debating.  My point? It's all in the facts people, even though I never would be able to have that liberal left make a turn on his view or positiion, by my discussion with him, others listening in see's the facts and learn from it. Let's face it, there are many out with their minds already made up, but others can still be educated.   So what I say is, show me the facts. What has Kerry voted on during his term? I am pasting some interesting views of Kerry on the bottom of this post.  Today, I am on support and will be giving a little training class on VPS. ( Virtual Print Station ) Basically I probably will not get anything else done. I did manage to get some things done yesterday at work that made me feel like I accomplished some of my projects but we will see for today.  On the way to the hotel yesterday, stopping at TGIF's to grab for supper, I tried the taste of 'Samuel Adams' beer. The lady at the bar, let me try the taste. I wasn't impressed. The only beer I have ever tried and continue to like is Corona.  Tonight, Michael Moore will be on Bill O'rielly. I will definitely be watching that one.   -------------- Interesting thing of Kerry's view. 	  In John Kerry's Own Words:  On Thursday, Senator John Kerry sat down for an interview with ABC News reporter Peter Jennings.  Below is a portion of that interview.  Peter Jennings: "You told an Iowa newspaper recently that life begins at conception. What makes you think that?"  Sen. Kerry: "My personal belief about what happens in the fertilization process is a human being is first formed and created, and that's when life begins. Something begins to happen. There's a transformation. There's an evolution. Within weeks, you look and see the development of it, but that's not a person yet, and it's certainly not what somebody, in my judgment, ought to have the government of the United States intervening in.  Roe v. Wade has made it very clear what our standard is with respect to viability, what our standard is with respect to rights. I believe in the right to choose, not the government choosing, but an individual, and I defend that."  Jennings: "Could you explain again to me what do you mean when you say 'life begins at conception'?"  Kerry: "Well, that's what the Supreme Court has established is a test of viability as to whether or not you're permitted to terminate a pregnancy, and I support that. That is my test. And I, you know, you have all kinds of different evolutions of life, as we know, and very different beliefs about birth, the process of the development of a fetus. That's the standard that's been established in Roe v. Wade. And I adhere to that standard."  Jennings: "If you believe that life begins at conception, is even a first-trimester abortion not murder?"  Kerry: "No, because it's not the form of life that takes personhood in the terms that we have judged it to be in the past. It's the beginning of life. Does life begin? Yes, it begins.  Is it at the point where I would say that you apply those penalties? The answer is, no, and I believe in choice. I believe in the right to choose, and the government should not involve itself in that choice, beyond where it has in the context of Roe v. Wade."  John Kerry's Own Actions:  Kerry Has Voted At Least Six Times Against Banning Partial-Birth Abortion.   Kerry Has Voted At Least 25 Times In Favor Of Using Taxpayer Dollars To Pay For Abortions In United States.  Kerry Voted Against Unborn Victims of Violence Act - "Laci and Connor Peterson's Law"  Nonpartisan National Journal Scored Kerry's Votes Most Liberal In Senate For 2003. Kerry scored a Senate-high 97% liberal rating for 2003, beating out Sens. Barbara Boxer (91), Hillary Clinton (89), Ted Kennedy (88), and Tom Daschle (80). (National Journal Website, "How They Measured Up," http://nationaljournal.com, 2/27/04)  John Kerry says he believes that life begins at conception, yet does not have the conviction to protect life, and instead promotes abortion -- even up until the moment a child takes their first breath!

      Why didn't I just go to sleep? After I ate last night took a (yes just one) tyelenol p.m. I went to bed and started to watch  urlLink  The Deadzone  series on my laptop. The next thing I know it's 4:30. I turned everything off and finally tried to sleep.  I was awaken this morning with the housekeeper trying to come through the door. Fortunately, it was locked on the inside. I got up, showered, ate and called my beloved  wife to check on her. She had 3 dogs, 2 kids sleep with her last night. So no rest for the wicked or insane.    100 days till election? The only thing on the news is the big party at the Democratic Convention happening in Boston and the missing Hacking woman. I think I have a resolution for both accounts. I say we acquire our suspects, crank them up with truth serum in a public forum ( this would allow all to see and keep questions to the topic ) and start out with the questioning. This would keep cost down and we would get to the bottom of the real deal.  Now for the politicians, we get both candidates in the same forum, crank them up and ask them the important questions. Each candidate would be able to answer honestly and soundly. Being the skeptic in me, I realize this is not full proof, due to those extremist finding means to reduce the effect of the truth serum, but we can work out that bug.  Also yesterday, I was speaking with a lady at the Fort Smith airport. She was returning to New York. I don't know how the conversation ended up on smokes (no I don't smoke) but she said a pack of cigerattes cost 6.50 to 7 bucks per pack. I responded "Are you serious?" Talk about mindboggling. I don't know how much a pack is in my area, 3.50 - 4 ? But, it is tremendously less here than in NY. I asked her how many did she buy to take back. She bought 4 cartons. Seems for about 60 bucks a carton up there runs around 22 here. Great Scott, I would have someone just mail them to me. My mind couldn't help thinking that would be a good little black market. Think  about it, goto an indian smoke shop for non-tax smokes and mail them to someone up there. It would still be cheaper for them. So anyone in NY or another state reading this can contact me to work out the details.   I gotta do some work, but I don't want too.

      Finally in my hotel room with my shoes off in PA. The airplane trip was late out of Dallas into PA. Something about a plane coming in wrong. I don't know. There was 21 airplanes in line to get underway and I think we were the 20th in the line. We were about 1.5 hours in delay just to get off the ground at Dallas. Once in the air, it was pleasant enough. Seems there was a Mary Kay seminar/class in Dallas over the weekend. I  sat by 2 elderly ladies that were reallllllyy into it. Fortunately, they were tired and I had my son's gameboy. They crashed and I played 'The Legend of Zelda'! I was kicking but in Hyrule and only cursed under my breath from frustration a couple of times. :  )  This morning my wife's parents basically forced her into going to Kholes with them. They wanted to buy our kids some school close. No harm there but they can get pushy on certain things. She left with them a little before 7 a.m. I had the coffee going, thinking her dad would stay for us to chat ( he makes a good debater and actually knows what's going on in the news ) but he left with her and her mom. Oh well. I finished up the packing of the laptop and let the kids sleep in.   Wasnt long a phone call and they want me and the kids to meet them in Ihop to eat with them. Needless to say, they politely asked us to come now. We did eat breakfast there, but thereafter myself, her dad, and my kids got haircuts. All this paid by my wife's parents. I don't know what the occasion is nor why their willingness to spend it now. But, I am gratefull for their generousity. ( prob spelled that wrong ) but heh its after midnight here.    The morning basically flew and before long I had to hit the airport for the flight. I did get to eat lunch with the kids and spend a little time with the family alone before leaving.  Ever look at other peoples shirts to see what they are wearing? I can't help myself. I normally always read other peoples shirts they wear. Some are funny, some candor and others are pretty generic. When I have to travel, I like to wear christian shirts. Ones that actually have meaning. I don't get much comments, nor stares, nor even converstation starters. But I do notice others read it. I guess you can't help yourself (much like me ), you have to read them, just to see what it says.  Anyway, I am in Dallas and a couple stopped to say 'Hey that's the shirt we were going to buy'. They evidently had forgotten to pick it up but wanted to buy it. Needless to say they looked  at my tag in the back to see who made it (it was Gilban). Like I cared for her to look at it. Although my twisted mind later thought, what if she had a needle of something and stuck me. oh well. The guy asked if the sandwich I was eating was any good ( I had an hour layover in Dallas ) and wished me a good trip. Only a couple of times that has happened to me in regards to a shirt I am wearing. Please note I have many Christian shirts, ana I normally only wear these T-shirts. I just have alot of them from gifts and I enjoy wearing them. I can't really sit at a bar drinking a Corona with them on, but that's probably better for me anyway. This shirt had simply on it 'AMERICA' with a flag under it and then under the flag 'One nation under the Son, Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord Psalm 33:12'    So that was basically my day, mostly traveling. Its after 1 a.m now in Pennsylvania. I arrived at the airport, grabbed a rental car (National), drove to 'King of Prussia' ((yes its a real place with a huge mall)). I stopped in an ACME first to grab some bread, chips, pepsi edge, sausage links, mustard and yogurt (healthy huh) then hit my  hotel. Now I sit here munching chips, eating my second sausage link with bread and mustard, sipping pepsi edge. There is nothing on TV, no surprise there. I already called my wife on each stop and arrival at hotel to let her know all is well.   So if you read this, those 4-5 that do and see any grammer errors, ect. Sorry but it's late and getting a bit blurry.

      Man, I am glad it's Friday. Something about it just makes it better. I am flying out to PA tomorrow but at least I get to come back Friday. I know I won't get anything accomplished while I am at Corporate, I never do. Too many meetings, interuptions ect.   I got my Bush/Cheney 04 bumper stickers in today! I didn't think I would get them before I left. I can now at least take some with me on my trip. I plan to at least put them in my windshield (tape them not actually sticking them ) on my rental. I also met Daniel Hill this morning and acquired some Tom Coburn yard signs. I put them up around Pocola on my way home. I met him around 7 a.m. this morning and then went on to my Chiropracter. Still doing that bid. I admit my wrist had not hurt since going to him (it was an old sport injury), so something must be right.   I took two tylenol pm's and I am feeling it. I also gave my 2 kiddo's a benadryl the same time ( alergies )but they are not feeling it.   They wrestled me to death and I had to steal a break, hence writing this blog. Man, where do they get their energy?   I am already packed for the week out, and plan to spend the morning with the family. I am leaving out around 2 p.m. tomorrow and we plan to hit Mcdonalds for the kids prior to.   I did find a cool website,  urlLink http://www.cwfpac.com/ . It contains a scorecard of your Representives and Senators. Also they have a thing called  urlLink Megavote  where you can put your zip code in and recieve emails of your Senators/Representives votes, upcoming legislations, ect. I signed up for it and will let you know how it is. It sounds cool, bue we will see.

      Is it really already nearly 8 p.m.? Well, I finally received my laptop around 2 something and it was as i feared. I couldn't get into some things I needed and some missing programs I needed.   I was on the phone with PCLAN for nearly 2 hours and finally got up and running. I also was hit with a lab issue to work on right off the bat.   I was on the pc and phone for nearly 4 hours and will end up resuming tomorrow. Get this. After about an hour I asked the facility if they had a real pt issue and the answer was no. They were seeing the issue with a test pt.   Go figure. They didnt have a real patient example.   My father-in-law had came by and was still here after 6 when I was done. He seen a 'this land is your land' with Bush and Kerry on the news that was crazy. I found it online and we watched it together laughing our butts off. Its found  urlLink here  and you can click play to see it. I tell you it's hilarous if your a Democrat or Republican.   The guy called me back in regards to the  urlLink Tom Coburn for Senate  yard signs. I will be able to pick them up tomorrow before work. I told him I hadn't seen any in Pocola area at all. He was grateful and seem to be pleased. I am doing this primarily to be active and I found it interesting  urlLink AFA    and  urlLink James Dobson  is supporting him.   I still need to install some of my software on this buisiness pc. But I am glad to get it back. I noticed they installed Win2K rather than the original XP and it now has a 25 gig harddrive. woo hoo. But it does suck I lost everything though.

      Day 2 of my back to work and I still cannot do anything this morning. They supposedly sent my PC back to me via Fedex and I have yet to receive it. Yesterday I took the time to weedeat the yard and clean the house up. I should be getting it in about 2-3 hours. I called my supervisor and informed her I am&nbsp;still waiting on it and will plug in as soon as I receive it. They are going through a GW upgrade as I write this, so you know they would love me to get into the game. But I cannot yet.   I am in the process of creating a PTA website for our School. I have been selected to be treasurer and my wife is President. Cool eh?&nbsp; I know it will be a royal pain in the a@@ but it will be good for the school and kids. The last year pres-vice pres didnt do much of anything. In fact looking at the past record it hasn't been much of an impact in quite some time.&nbsp; So I am looking forward to making a difference in that regard.&nbsp; I will post the site later when I get it up and going.   The GOP primaries for Oklahoma will be voted on next Tuesday. I will be flying out to Corporate this Saturday so wont be here. I found out I cannot even provide an absentee ballot. I am registered independant. I did this because I do not find myself voting on a specific party, rather on the basis of the candidate. But with Oklahoma law, only registered republicans can vote for the primary republican vote. The same with Democratic primary. But I still can vote on the ballot&nbsp;for Novembers election. I suspect I will be changing my registery this year to Republican. I am in contact with Tom Coburn's office to at least acquire some signs for his candidacy. Since I cannot vote nor will be here, I figured I can at least put up the&nbsp;signs, ect in my area to support him that way. I do not&nbsp;see any signs for him in my town.&nbsp; Tom Coburn's site is located  urlLink here .&nbsp; I been speaking with a Brian Treat out of Muskogee, number is 918-684-4308.   I&nbsp;have also started to listen to AM&nbsp;radio talk shows. I find them&nbsp;more stimulating than the background music I usually listen too and there are some good information coming out of them.   &nbsp;

      My buisiness computer is still at Corporate and I start back tomorrow. What a drag. I cannot do anything without it. Seems the harddrive crashed hard and they are replacing that one and having to install all new software. I hate it. Not only will I be behind, I will be further behind now due to not even having it back yet. I left 2 voicemails on 2 different peoples offices and no word back nor any vm's in my bin at all. Very frustrating.   I leave for Pennsylvania on Saturday and return next Friday. I dread it. I never get anything done while I am up there. I am swamped with meetings, ect and constant disruptions.   We drove to Little Rock and back today. My son had another Dr. visit and followup. Seems most checked out ok. He is still doing well from last Monday so this is good.   School starts in less than 3 weeks! Our kids school start on the&nbsp; 11th. I will be gone one of the 3 weeks and I am the new PTA Treasurer. Much to do and no time to do it in.   I spoke with a gentlemen midway to Little Rock asking the consensus on peoples view, Kerry or Bush. He basically told me he would vote for a hounddog before Bush. I informed him Kerry hasn't even been doing his current job, missing 2/3 votes but managed to not support Defense for our troops, vote against the partial birth abortion ban, ect. But his mind was already settled. I truly do not understand why individuals would put our fellow americans in harms way, only for the reason of hatred.

      Alot has happened during the last few days. One, my buisiness laptop crapped out. I hadt to fedex it out yesterday. I am on quote, unquote vacation. But the primary purpose was  a procedure for my son. The procedure went well, and he is doing great! This is the best part of the vacation.   My wife took the catering food over to the wedding and we left that same Saturday evening. We drove as far as we could toward San Antonia, Tx. My wife has an aunt and uncle living in New Braunfels, near San Antonia. We crashed out nearly midnight at a hotel then proceeded on the following morning after a breakfast in Cracker Barrel.   We made it to her Aunt and Uncle house around 2 p.m. Sunday. Monday morning our son had the procedure in Austin while my daughter and I checked out Austins Nature place. It was cool for kids. She was able to dig in the sandpit uncovering dino bones, ect. She didnt care for the Nature trail. The procedure only took 45 minutes ( amazing with modern medicine ) and he also was able to see the dino site. We ( wife, kids and one of her cousins ) then ate at Joes Crab shack for lunch. It was good. I had a cobb salad, one of my favorites.   We then hit some outlets on the way back to the house. MY son was already doing very well. I was impressed most with the Bible Outlet. I wish I had more time to go back there before I leave. I was looking hard at a book ( Debunking Dwarnism ) and probably should had grabbed it.   Tuesday we hit the Schlitterbahn. Talk about a cool place. It was a water park and a half. We didn't hit the Master Blaster due to the tremendous lines but i did manage to hit the Black Knight with Kell's cousin. We also hit the tubes, and some body slides. The kids loved the kiddy pools, pirate ship ect. We had a tremendous good time.  Coming back to the house we ordered pizza and was wasted with the sun all day.   Wednesday we hit Seaworld. We managed to see all the shows; Shamu, the dolphins, Viva, ect. Again the kids had a blast. It was very spread out and we had rented a double stroller for the kids. This saved us because we could move faster and it was less hard on the kids. That night I ran to Hastings and rented a game and a couple of movies for the kids. Kell's cousin rented Spiderman2 for the PS2. Yes, I  had to play it while here also. I was impressed with Hastings selection here. It is better than the one we have and I seen DeadZone season 2 there. I nearly grabbed it for only 39. This is the first time I seen it. I hadn't but may grab it before my trip here.  Today is Thursday, my 9 year anniversary. Kelli and I have plans to spend the night at the Drury Inn at the Riverwalk while the kids stay here. Since my son is doing so well, and the kids are looking for some time without us (pratically already asking when we will leave at 8:30 in the morning) we look forward to some quality time alone.  I recieved word my brothers in the hospital as of yesterday, last night. I didn't hear it from my family rather from Kell's aunt. ( The one in OK ). Seems he is passing more kidney stones and one is too large to pass. I get very aggravated at my family, because my son went through a procedure Monday and they have not yet called to check on him, knowing our cell numbers. Nor did they care to cal me informing me my brothers in the hospital. What can you do?

      As unbelievable as it sounds, all those batch files I had to send for the facility last night had to be backed out this morning. I received an IM from the hospital stating their all duplicated charges/credits.   I was totally frustrated. So basically it was for nothing and I had now more work to do. Fortunately the interface was still there and I only needed to restart it. But I had to go into each batch (a data file full of 48 ((charges)) and 49 ((credits)) records.    It was not a good morning.   Its now midnight and I cant sleep for nothing. I laid in bed well over an hour, so figured I can blog. I have tomorrow then I am off for awhile. I can't wait.   I went to the chiropractor today. I never been to one. I have an old sport injury in my rt wrist and it's probably carpal tunnel settling in. I picked up a case of bottle water the other day and it hurt like hell. I must have kinked it. I also have a sore spot under my rt shoulder blade, that's been going on for a week. I kept thinking its a pulled muscle, but it just wont go away. The past two days, I've taken loracet and Celebrex to ease the pain.  My wife has gone to him and speaks highly of his practice. So anyway, I went today and he put a electric box to my back shoulder muscles. It's not a tinge unit but something else. Supposedly this continues to work after its turned off. I don't know. I know I cant sleep worth a flip and I can't take a tylenol pm due to being on-call tonight. It sucks.  I also know my back is still sore and he is suppose to adjust me in the morning. I guess we will see. Guess, I will flip the tv in the living room since everyone is asleep and I don't want to wake the wife.

      As you know, I ran scripts all weekend long. The revenue caught up nearly 2.5 million dollars for the facilty. Fortunately they fixed the issue and this is now done.  Yesterday evening, as I was leaving the office I received a call. I felt I better answer. BOS ( Buisiness Office ) at Corporate had a few in the room on a conference call to me. They explained to me that another facility had an issue with charges. Seems this hospital had not been looking at their charges for the past 7 days and was missing revenue.   What's the deal with these people? Seems no-one looks at their daily reports till its too late then expect IS to clean it up. Anyway, last night I spent nearly 2 hours creating a new interface to move the files over for the hospital to recapture their missing charges.   I asked my wife, what was the deal? Am I the revenue man or what?   We have today and tomorrow, then have to drive to San Antonia, Saturday. My wife is catering a wedding Saturday and we plan to leave afterward. I am ready to get off this roller coaster ride.

      I hope everyone had a good and safe Fourth of July. It's been another delay, since my blog. Last week was just too busy in itself. This weekend was busy but nice. I was on-call all weekend but it wasn’t nearly as bad as I had feared.   For work I had to run 3 olie scripts. An olie script is a neat little program that allows you to paste repetitive keystrokes within the ordering/registering system at work. So rather than a person entering in 1000 charges, you can set this bad boy up to enter them for you. Not everyone knows it, so it was deemed to me to do it. A hospital had contacted us about 2 weeks ago to request help entering in nearly 2.4 million bucks of charges from April through June that were missed. Eek gad.   So I wrote the script and attempted to run it. But it wouldn’t run on my P.C. Stupid thing kept dying on me. So the PC LAN group was able to set up a PC at Corp (in Pennsylvania) and set it up to allow me to PCAnywhere into it (from Oklahoma). I placed my files and script on that machine and ran it from there. It was good I could. We had thunderstorms Friday and Saturday and it kept disconnecting my connection to Corp. But the script remained running on the machine at Corp. Pretty cool, eh?   Of the 3 scripts (April, May, and June) I ran, May was the largest. It had over 18 thousand charges to enter. Needless to say it ran nearly 23 hours. Yes, I stayed up late babysitting it. But by Sunday morning / Saturday night they were done. While this ran, my wife organized the house out. She and I (mostly she) cleaned out all the closets, rooms ECT. Since it rained nearly all day.   Sunday we went to church and then I ran to grab a 16 inch July 4th Cookie from the Cookie Company. A couple with their 2 kids came over and we ate together. The kids played in the backyard in the pool (large pump kind, you find at Wal-Mart now). I brought out the water guns and the fun really began. The wives stayed in the house (chickens) while Erich and I first fought the kids then each other we were all drenched. We had a blast. My wife and I did manage to play some more tether ball, but she beat me again. Oh well.   Then at night we popped our fireworks and watched the neighbors as well. The friends didn’t leave till 10:30 p.m. We pretty much crashed after that. I didn’t get called but maybe 5 times all weekend. It was nice.  Monday we were off and I was not on-call. Alma, Arkansas has a small water park we had not known. So we took the kids over there and played for nearly 2 hours. It wasn’t bad at all. We had a blast and I was pleased to see the kids (5, 6 yrs old) go down the large water slides with no problem, alone! Cool.   That’s my weekend in a nutshell. Hope everyone enjoyed there’s.

      This week, my wifes friend from Germany has come over the states to visit. Initially she attended a wedding in Texas but this week she is staying close to here. I was fortunate to meet her Tuesday, and visited again last night. She is an interesting individual. She has gone to school/college most of her life and can speak 5 languages. She has a hard accent and at times has that confused look as to what your trying to convey to her, but you can also see she is definitely a warm, well knowledged person.   I was able to speak with her a bit during lunch Tuesday, about the main dichotomy of here and over seas. She said society in whole, school system and just from one town to the other as differences she see's. Their main means of transportation is by train or bicycle. Gas is horribly expensive, and with only the short distances of travel, they mainly cycle it.   I am on support starting tonight throughout the weekend. The family will be able to go out to dinner with her tonight and I hope to be able to discuss with her again. I find it fascinating to hear first hand of others view. My wife was able to spend some time with her during the week. But I feel she could have more time with her, were it not for her Aunt's hoggging her friend.   I will ask my wife to see if we can have her spend the night prior to her leaving.

      I miss the days of Dragnet. I recall the same plea over and over again. "Just the facts ". When I went to school we had a bad ass English teacher that drilled it in our heads, just the facts, just the facts. I hated English, as you can see in my grammer. But as I grow older and notice the news, mags, and stories, it seems their English teacher did not have the same adament desire.   If you noticed the 'news' are more of ideology than facts. Its not how it is, rather than how it is perceived to be. This is something I learned the hard way while I debated online. Regardless of how many facts you throw at some people, they still choose not to accept it. What the hell. You can lead the horse to water but cannot make that horse drink it.   So in debating, I come to the simple conclusion. The opponent will not change my view, I will not change the opponent's view. I may find more information from the debate, but the major outcome will be those on the sidelines listening in on the discussion. The kicker is which opponent has the most information on the subject as well as the resources to back it up. The problem is the side-liners probably will not take the time to go look at those resources, if given, rather take whichever sounds the best or fits into his/her own ideology. This is what I am finding more and more of. There is so much spin on the same subject matter you can lean left or right.   Where's the days of facts? If either debator addresses their view of the facts, they generally leave some of it out or word it in such a matter of their view.   I guess I am just ranting tonight but does anyone else see my point here?

      Drop, crash. As I began working this morning, both my kids and wife was still in bed opening their eyes. I heard an unmistakenble drop, crash. My first thought was a picture must had fallen off the wall (happened before). I looked down the hall then in the other rooms. Nothing unusual or obvious. Then it struck me. The ice machine in our new fridge. The new fridge we acquired yesterday has a water and ice machine in it and I am not use to the sounds.   On another note this morning, I read the following in an email article and had to pass it on.   "Kerry for President camp just handed me the kind of story I can't keep away from. The new "religious advisor" to Senator John Kerry previously joined the lawsuit filed by atheist Michael Newdow to remove the words "under God" from the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag! Kerry's new "religious advisor" -  urlLink Rev. Brenda Bartella Peterson  - was one of thirty-two clergy members to file an  urlLink amicus curiae brief  in behalf of Michael Newdow. This is the woman that John Kerry plans to send to America's religious groups as his representative. Polls show that almost all Christians and the vast majority of even non-Christians in America, do not want "under God" removed from the Pledge. So what religious groups is she going to represent John Kerry to? Gay Unitarians? "

      Kids are back safely from their trip, and I am so glad. It's amazing how much I missed them bugging me. It's like being a week at Corp., first couple of days were nice but then I was ready to have them back. It sounds like they had blast and was spoiled like crazy. Kell's mom and dad (nana and papa) had to tell me the story of them at a biker bar. Seems they had picnic tables there and sat outside watching all the bikers drive in and out and the food was excellent (or according to nana -to die for). My son loves motorcycles. But everyone made it home safe. Still washing their dirty clothes. :  )  In addition to the kids coming home, Kell's parents brought back a freezer, refrigerator, couch and love seat. We get the refrigerator and her brother will get ours. We were told we would acquire it, which will be nice since this one has a built in water/ice. I never had one of those before, so we are looking forward to having it. Ours is a bit smaller but its the perfect size for her brothers place, as he does not have on yet. ( he moved out recently ) So it works out well.   Yesterday, all day my wife and I just shopped. We were looking for calendars/organizers to buy the teachers, from the PTA. No luck. Seems to be the wrong time of year. We will probably have to order them online (internet) for them. In looking for them, I think we hit 20 stores. MOstly we browsed around while in them but it was nice, the fact we didn't have,"I want to go home", after ever other store. So we spent most of yesterday evening out and about.   During the weekend we also managed to clean out and rearrange our garage and today I  deep cleaned the floors. Even took out all the rugs to beat and hang in the sun. Kelli and I worked on getting geared for the PTA this week. We will have a member drive during open house Tuesday night. Unbelievable to think school starts this Wed. My daughter will be in 1st grade and my son in Kidengarten. Man time flys. I mentioned I had started on the PTA website and the site is located  urlLink here .  I can't recall if I mentioned us putting on a lay-a-way for Christmas while they were out. Well, we put on a PS2. Yeah, its as much for me as them. :  )

      I haven't updated all in awhile so I thought I better do so. The kids have gone with their nana and papa to Texas for a wedding. That's right, Thursday, Friday night and Saturday without my precious. We feel lost without them. But as much as I miss them, I am really enjoying time alone with my wife. Thursday night we ordered pizza (didn't have to have pepperoni) and watched 13 going on 30 all before 9 p.m.! yeah, you might think, 'wow, what party animals'. But it was nice to be able to sit watch and relax before anyone else was in bed.   Friday's work day was pretty good. I was able to accomplish alot and felt like I was all over the place. I worked on 2 projects, on 2 conference calls, assisted 3 people, and was able to update some documentation. All in all a productive day. I am still seeing the Chiropracter, had a visit at 8 a.m. before work today. Same thing, keep up the excercises and see my twice again next week. But I have to say my wrist has not hurt at all since I been going. So something is working right.   Friday evening my wife and I enjoyed the evening out. We ate out at LoneStar steakhouse (I had a peppercorn steak and my wife ate steak and shrimp) yes it was good. We then gathered some supplies, cookies, soda for PTA. Did I mention my wife is PTA president and I was voted Treasurer this year? Can't recall if I did. Oh well. We  grabbed the stuff. I also grabbed two movies to watch, Swordfish (seen it before but wanted to again) and Hart's War(haven't seen that one), both for 1.99 each so couldn't pass renting those. We also were able to leasurely walk through Walmart, so we put on a Christmas layaway for the kids. Have to start on it due to being around the corner and the fact I get paid once a month.   Anyway, the evenings have been really nice but we continue to call the kids to check on them. They are being spoiled rotten as usual and enjoying time with their grandparents. School starts on the 11th here. The school has an open house on the evening of the 10th. PTA will furnish the refreshments, hence the soda's and cookies. We will also have a member drive that evening. Another exciting event is my buddy will be starting up a 4H here in Pocola, which they have not had before.   The other best thing, is the spontaneity my wife and I can have without the kids. I will leave that to you imaginations. :  )

       urlLink    Dick Cheyney in Fort Smith today, 8-3-04&nbsp; urlLink      Very cool. I had the chance to take an extended lunch to go see Dick Cheyney in Fort Smith today. I stood in line for nearly an hour to go through security. It was held in the Fort Smith Convention Center. Cheyney was a bit late arriving and spoke for about 35-40 minutes. I was able to tape nearly all of the speech and of course taking as many digital pics as possible. I am posting one of the better ones of him. I was able to shake his and his wifes hand. I am grateful to have a good job to enable me to be able to escape for such things. Of course I will put in that same time if not more but I cannot gripe. I figured this would be the only chance to actually see him in person.  He spoke very clear and was very articulated. I was very impressed with his speech.   Per request, I found the speech on the Bush Cheyney Website. It is here..  urlLink http://georgewbush.com/News/Read.aspx?ID=3164
