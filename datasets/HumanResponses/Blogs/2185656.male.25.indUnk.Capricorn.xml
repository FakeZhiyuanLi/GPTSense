      ...and so it is!! I've had such fun "Younglifing" it lately.  To save time, if you don't know what Young Life is, refer to www.younglife.org.  The past three years, I have been volunteering with Fulton High school and this past school year, I added WB, where I teach.  Summer camps are quickly upon us, and while I cannot go this year, there are other roles to fulfill.  Thursday morning, I went with Fulton girls to do some yard/house work in order to raise money for camp. They are SUCH troopers -from planting tomatoes to flipping compost!! And before I get emails protesting me overdoing it - let me just clarify that I just planted some flowers in the shade and did some light dusting! It was a lovely  morning - we hit Krispy Kreme on the way in - and YES the "Hot Doughnuts Now" sign was on.  As we were leaving, we encountered a snapping turtle.  Whitney was merely trying to HELP him (or her, I suppose) by attempting to pick it up and move it across the street to the lake side, and we all discovered just how FAST those things can move and WHY they are called "snapping turtles."  (Whitney emerged unscathed, if you were wondering.)   Shameless plug:  If you are so inclined, Fulton is in a lower income section of town and donations for their Camp trips would be HIGHLY welcome.  Email me if you're interested in doing this.  Even if it's small - EVERY little bit adds up!  Friday, after a quick check in with my oncologist, I met my WB girls up at the Food Pantry in Maryville, and we helped serve supper to some less fortunate people.  I have missed them terribly, so it was fun to get caught up with them, AND a joy to watch them serve so selflessly.  They are leaving for camp this Sunday, so we got to talk about what a good time that will be for them.  As I always keep a whiffle ball and bat in my trunk for impromptu fun, we commenced with a quick batting session on the top of the parking garage.  Naturally, Murphy's law dictates that it's a matter of time before the ball gets hit over the wall and down to the ground.  I DEFINITELY get by with a little help from my friends!  Was quite over the hair this week, so today Ken came over to buzz it, as Katie, Pete and Tiffany hung out with us for moral support. I'm all G.I.Jane baby!!  Woo-hoo.  Saw Shrek 2 - highly recommend it!!  Happy Birthday to my roommate Stacie!!! She's moving to VA soon and I'm sad, but am thankful for all the silly fun we've had for the past two years, that and the fact that I've made a West Wing addict out of her as well....

      ...or in my case it's more like 7 hundred K as I'm referring to my hair.  It's the time for the starting to fall out process.  I have this visual, (all of you who remember the 80's raise your hand) of this comic strip, "Bloom County" and there was this sequence where "Bill the Cat" took this hair growth tonic - he sneezed and was totally bald.  I've been having that thought, but, really it's more like I'm a cat or a husky losing the winter coat.  With all the hair I have, this process could take forever.  Oh wait, they're pumping more drugs into me next week, so that might speed it up.  No matter, this will no doubt be a good training for the sequence of my life where I want to be a spy. Or a pirate queen.  Besides, in my vast life experiences, I've learned the following:  1.Bruises fade  (even when your father thinks it's funny to poke them and go "What's that?)  2. Cuts indeed heal, and even leave interesting scars to talk about.   (I have a great one left over from a 3AM mud football game in college!)  3. Broken hearts do indeed mend, although it takes a long time. (and also leaves somewhat interesting scars.)  4. Bad dye-jobs do grow out. (and any fabric damaged in the process can be replaced)  5. GPA's can be recovered in spite of two semesters of bad judgement.  (All of you brand new college freshmen, keep that in mind!!)  6. Broken limbs heal, and provide you then with a fun weather barometer.  (My ankle from my ski accident always throbs a bit when it's going to rain or snow!)  7. Hair will, no doubt, GROW BACK!!! (and while you're waiting for that, you can pretend you're on "Alias.")   Today's adventure:  going to the radiologist.  This was just a first time consult.  However,instead of the guy my oncologist set me up with, they had me down for a Dr. Green.  In my gentle and please-let-me-be-your-doormat kind of way (riiiiiiight), I made it clear that, that was just not going to happen.  So, now, it's all good and rescheduled and I get to keep Dr. Bertoli, who came in to talk for a minute.  I have had several inputs on his capability and character, so I was most keen (when was the last time you got to use that word) to keep him.  And my first impressions were on the mark with all that I have heard.  He's already been calling around concerning case, which is (big word) PHARYNGEAL, and has experience with this specific type of cancer - yay!  So, no big hospital tales, except to say that UT is soon opening up a starbucks!! Great for me! and good for all of you who plan on coming to "hang out" during tiki-room time!!  BUT, the word Bertoli, besides making me REALLY want to go to Italy, makes me think of the word Fibanacci.  So, today's math lesson:  Fibonacci is perhaps best known for a simple series of numbers, introduced in Liber abaci and later named the Fibonacci numbers in his honour. The series begins with 0 and 1. After that, use the simple rule:   Add the last two numbers to get the next.   1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987,...   You might ask where this came from? In Fibonacci's day, mathematical competitions and challenges were common. In 1225 Fibonacci took part in a tournament at Pisa ordered by the emperor himself, Frederick II.   Rumour has it, and I like to think there's truth to it, is that it was actually Fibanacci's WIFE who came up with the concept, but it being 1225 and all, she probably wasn't going to get much credit. The sequence is fascinating, espcecially when you look at how it lines up with God's creative plans in nature. The spiral patterns, on a sunflower or on a seashell, line up with the sequence.  It has been suggested to me that there were less than noble reasons the Fibanacci'e were so interested in such things.  Sounds like fun for you all to do some reasearch.   Alright, enough nerd-dom.  WB's graduation was last night and I'm so glad that I got to go.  Of course the number of ballcaps and airhorns was staggering, but I still have to get used to the idea that the bloody concession stand is open!  I just CANNOT fathom someone munching down on a hot dog or nachos during a COMMENCEMENT!  Yet, considering I have many incredible students, that I'm close with, who did graduate last night, it was lovely to get to be with them a bit for that milestone.  Also in the middle of habitat-hunting, will be providing updates for all you bored dears who read past the Fibanacci part.

      I have all this bloody time on my hands, to which I decided to turn into an educational sabbatical (because that sounds soooo much better).  Since I'm somewhat "grounded" in Knoxville, it is Knoxville that gets to become my own personal Smithsonian, or Carthage (for the exploration factor).   Today's adventure started downtown.  Now there's something about cities I love, walkable cities, like London, or Chicago, or Savannah...  There is a beauty and intrigue and somewhat of mystery of our downtown. Alright, I am aware that last sentence reads right out of some uibiquitous travel guide.  Walking through the streets this morning, I felt like Forest Gump, wondering about the history of the buildings.  ("Where have they been, where are they going?"  and YES, I realize that buildings can't GO anywhere, if you don't get the allegory, well, too bad! ;-) )  It's fun to know the acutal history, but more fun to invent your own.  The reason which brought me downtown in the first place, was Gretchen's House Auction, which has been the basis, if not for much "blogging", for many a conversation I've had, in the last few weeks.  Brillant as I am, I'm somewhat of an idiot when it comes to anything that has to do with financial paperwork, my own taxes, loan things and since I'm still in the "I should have been on 'FRIENDS'" phase,  I rent an apartment.    Nordic Queen that she is, when her rental property was foreclosed upon, she gathered her wits and strength and set about to get it herself.  Doubtless SHE'S learned a great deal about the red tape and the in general selling of your soul that goes along with aquiring a house.  ( A process that Kenna is learning about even as you read this!!!) So, it's the 11th hour, and I'm her backup.    Oooh! sidebar: I found out it's quite amusing to be dressed up, walk about in courthouse country, look confident, make eye-cotact, and just have a little happy-with-yourself knowing smile when you see people.  In litigation-land, driven by fear and intimidation, breezy just completely freaks people out!!! And it's funny!! AND, it took me about 5 minutes to be able to differentiate the divorce lawyers from the ambulace chasers from the corporate guys. (So, to Kizzia and Lipsey, I AM listenting when you guys talk law stuff to me!)    Back to story: My job, besides to offer moral support, was to look fetching and distract any other bidders.  Mission accomplished people, she now is a home owner!!!  I would love to say it's because I looked so sassy, but it's not.  Because Jabba the Hutt showed up as the only other bidder and apparently, besides being lacking in grooming department, the circles he runs in, does not deem that it's socially improper to take cell phone calls during an auction, and was distracted enough at himself. (Now, had I been a big and strapping, say blond guy, I might have just gotten "rough" and just taken my $250 assault fine, to be distracting.)  Back to "Jabba," I would love to see him somewhere like Sotheby's or Christie's TRY and take a cell phone call, those security guys would have him wrangled and hog-tied in .3!!!  Oh, and for those of you who read this to see how I'm "doing" - thanks so much.  Today, I'm fabulously feeling normal and fine.  I DID go in for some bloodwork, and let me just brag brag brag on the wonderful Scott G. of the third floor at UT who is just the most stealthy, and painless lab tech in the universe!!!  From the world of Theatre:   The Vagabonds were indeed quite stellar in their finale of the year.  If you missed it, you should be sad.  Videos are available for viewing at my place, and in fact, a requirement upon admittance, unless you can barter your way out of it with hot wings or ice cream!!!  Fear not, I will shamelessly start plugging next season's shows, as soon as I decide upon what they are to be!  The Tony's are June 6th!! Yay! (Shane, email with your picks!!) Right now, I've only got Hugh Jackman down for "Best Actor in a Musical" for "The Boy from Oz."  Happy Weekend!!!

      Good afternoon happy campers!! (that was for Jeff Townsend's benefit by the way).    Today I had a "cat scan."  Now while I am very fond of the phrase, "You could swing a cat and hit a...." as in, " In Boston, you could swing a cat and hit a Starbucks."  (Which is AMAZINGLY accurate)  This has NOTHING to do with cats and scanning, laser-tag-esque guns.  IMAGINE my disappointment as I was all ready to play "Lara Croft" and the cats were going to be evil-take-over-the-world-types. (Stacie, this has nothing to do with Bailey, I love him dearly!!!!  Suki, though, well that's another story....)   No, no, this started with a (surprise!) IV, ('cause I possibly can't get stuck ENOUGH this summer).  Lab techs at UT, have a resoundly LOW tolerance for "crack-den-in-New-York" comments.  But please, if two guys had a tourniquet wrapped around your arms and were gleefully commenting over not one, but TWO good veins, will then, you would be tempted to make some analogies yourself!!  Public Service announcement.      On drugs.  Let me just say that any person insane enough to willingly and willfully inject themselves on a regular basis with foreign substances is not only a complete imbecile, but should be without hesitation be committed to the Rigoletto Home for the Mentally Incapacitated.  In Turin.   Back to the tale; I then got to lay on a bench that slides in a big metal cheerio (I think of "Stargate", but that's just to get you ready for NERD-ALERT forthcoming, and I did not emerege into a parallel universe..), while they pumped a bizarre warming substance into the IV.  To all my students that have been asking and WILL ask, I'm not sure if it made me glow or not, oddly enough, I didn't look into a mirror until hours later. Then they took the needle out.  I'm always careful to note this and be THANKFUL.  However, to add to the list of things I've learned, there's no such thing as a "Band-Aid" that is useful for helping to clot a needle-bleeding.  Instead, what they learn in med-tech school (and please know that I really do LIKE the people at UT, they have been lovely!), is to put a pound of cotton and a roll of what might as well be duct-tape.  In fact, I might bring in my own duct-tape next time.  It would add that whole "east Tennessee" flavor to the look.   Now to the Fall on the Floor Laughing segment:        To spend ANY time with me, is to know that one of my "happy places" (besides Railway Stations in Europe) is a book/coffee cafe (such as Barnes and Noble and Borders) where I can journal without the home distractions of the West Wing channel (known as Bravo).  Usually, I am able to think and write in peace, while taking note of my surroundings and fellow book&coffee junkies.  And normally, it's a diverse crowd, but tame.  NOT today.  Today required National Geographic to document.  There was a small, but wild, herd of "Card-gamers", found in comic-book stores and basements and Sci-fi channel conventions everywhere.  I have yet to encounter such a herd in these surroundings; it was absolutely fascinating.  There was quite a brouhaha, however, as this species apparently anticipates the upcoming DVD release of Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, and there were boxes of new gaming cards to be opened and bartered over and countless inside Orc-jokes.  Truly, I cannot begin to convey the wondrous rituals I observed.    *****Vagabonds - HOW HOW HOW did things go today?? Call/email in ASAP.  I know without question that today's show was brilliant and superbly run.  I am immensely proud of you all and love and miss you dearly!!!!!

      ...in an octupus' garden in the shade.  I bring up the underwater reference to impart some point of reference for an altered state.  However, I will not complain - the battle has begun, my own "Helm's Deep", as it were.  Moving onto other subjects...there will be a lovely play performed this week in the area - at William Blount HS, this Thursday (May 20th), at 6pm. If you are reading this, and are in the area - you should definitely go see it.  It's about a man who is having a dream he is in several plays and cannot recall having attended a single rehearsal.  I'm quite biased, but this is quite a talented group of young thespians who have worked quite hard in the absence of their director.  I would so love to offer some form of intelligent discourse today, but that will have to wait for another day.

      If you're reading this, then you know where my story is at this point, and if you don't, I'll be sure to catch all up to speed.  It is day three of my first round of chemo-therapy and I'm good to go!! Have another round in three weeks (June 2-4).  Funny things I learn: A) it is not a good thing to be paraniod about nausea and therefore take anti-nausea meds before a treatment. (If you get sick at the hospital, they can fix it there, don't try to help) and B) don't be paranoid about not eating before a treatment because IF you combine anti-nausea med with not eating and then a three hour "thing" at the hospital (which for all intents and practical purposes, I refer to as the tiki-room), then you end up blacking out, which is all easily remidied with saline solution and peanut butter.  Good times.  So thanks to my darling darling friends, what was looking like a summer of locked-down-no-communication-with-the-outside-world, I now have freedom and an outlet in which to share what it's like in my world.    But for now, this Friday night, I'm signing off and going to bed!!  Grace and peace,   Erin

      Well, it's been awhile, I'm quite aware - I've just been in that "non-bloggish" place. Of course that leaves me with this trunk of thoughts in my head that overflow,but don't really connect; yet I am quite capable of putting them all down and creating QUITE a head-scratching sense of "what the...?"  For starters, this morning was the first morning in two years that I wasn't woken up by the sound of two paws clawing at my dust ruffle for a good three minutes, followed by intrusive 27 pound "pay attention to me kitty" leaping up on the bed.  Dear Bailey, as Stacie moves to Virginia tomorrow, she found him a new home.  (see, how's that for pointless rambling?)  I could go into chemo-chronicling, but really, twice is quite enough, I know I'VE got the point, I'm sure you do too!  But actually, there were some moments of not-feeling-quite-well-curled-up-in-bed, this weekend that got me to thinking.  How Sir John Fortescue, Cervantes, Kit Marlowe and John Donne were extremely on the money when they said that "Comparisons are Odious." And yet, it is in the art of comparison that much of our western culture feeds and thrives.  From paychecks to houses to outer appearances to skills to health to various material items, we are programmed to compare and accumulate that which doesn't matter at all.  I got in a momentary bluesy place of comparing myself to all those fun people that got to do things like play outside and travel and go to work.  (I said this was a momentary thing, so NO NO NO NO NO "awww" moments for me!!!) Fortunately, a door in my memory opened and I thought of my dear cousin Angel, who's had a lifetime of where she COULD succumb to such thoughts, but chooses strength and to see the can, not the cannot. I thought of walking through Auschwitz and Birkenau and how hope and glory did and have arisen from the ashes of SUCH imaginable hell and horror.  And, for that moment, I had a different understanding and interpretation of when Paul says, "...Therefore we are surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses..."  It's amazing how we, ok, I can get so pre-occupied with "self" leaving no room for anything else.  And while,right now, I'm not reveling in the architectural wonderment of Wawel Castle, or saddling up horses for campers,(there shall be NO singing of THAT song!!) there is a journey for me, an internal one.  Much like the seashell that travels the ocean floor. Sir Thomas Browne put it well:      If thou could empty all thy self of self,  Like to a shell disinhabited.      Then might He find thee on the ocean shelf,  And say, "This is not dead,"      And fill thee with Himself instead.  But thou art all replete with very thou      And has such shrewd activity, That when He comes He says,"This is enow      Unto itself - 'twere better let it be, It is so small and full,there is no room for me." =================================================================================== Alright, that is a great deal of lofty and deep for the day. Going to find a bowl of cereal and see what's on E or Style.

      This will have no rhyme or reason, merely tidbits of things that have captured my attention lately...  In my cyber-cruisings, I found and fell in love with "Barney-cam."  I actually laugh out loud and clap (something my students know I do when I'm overjoyed with amusement) when his little terrier feet scamper across White House parquet floors. www.whitehouse.gov/barney   (DO be sure it's the .gov and NOT the .com!)  Mock me if you dare, but I absolutely have a weak spot for the old series, "In the Heat of the Night."  My darling friend Shelly Webster found out that "Bubba" is the MAYOR of Fresno California and that brought me much merriment and mirth. www.fresno.gov  With the release of the "Superfriends" on DVD and the fact that Jonny Quest, is already out, I was poking around Hanna-Barbera sites, because REALLY, if you're over 25 and you didn't live on an izba somewhere growing up, you have to have at least one childhood memory that involves Hanna-Barbera!  Huckleberry Hound, Quick Draw MacGraw, Mutley, Captain Caveman, Snagglepuss (Heavens to Mergatroids...),etc.... members.aol.com/PaulEC1/hBindex.html The reading of Huckleberry Hound and the Christmas Sleigh was especially nostalgic, as I had that book once upon a time.  In a solemn switch, the Bijou theatre closed here this week, easily my favourite theatre here in town. (Since the Tennessee Theatre is closed for ren., and the Oakridge Playhouse frankly, smells like mothballs.)  They had the most amazing fall lineup and I'm in  mourning.  Of course, I'm guessing that there will be some money hounds that buy it and re-open it, but with a different agenda, some theatre perhaps, but I'm presuming not much.  VIVE LA VIE BOHEME!  OK, last bit of random tangent (for today, anyway). I've always had a fascination with the pirate life; cunning, swashbuckling, open-sea, and so-forth. And it was WAY before Depp hit the scene thank you.  Jeremy found this link, I think we should all find our inner pirate. www.fidius.org/quiz/pirate.php  happy weekending,   Bloody Bess Bonney

      Such storms across Knoxville today, and they were the good kind, with wind and torrents of rain and lightning and thunder. I was at Sam's gleefully being wind-whipped and soaked in the parking lot at the time and LOVING IT.  I think I'm the only person I know that adores rain and even more so with the thunder and the lightning.  I would understand that if I were one of those personality types that were melancholic, but I'm not.  Hmmmmm. (pausing for reflective thought)  Moving on.  With storms, come memories and consequentially, stories. If you've ever conversed with me, you know I'm horrid at story-telling.  Quips and one-liners:quite brilliant.  Stories, not so much; I'll leave that to Daddy and Jim.  BUT,this occasion was fun and if you get bored because I have an AOD (attention overload disorder) fit - too bad, you were warned!  A few summers ago I moved back to Knoxville and what a trip that was, in EVERY sense of the word! Susie had flown down from Knox to make the drive back up, John K. and Stacie were making the drive up and flying back. We made a Budget Truck/Escort stop at Pickwick Lake in west Tenn, as it is a good halfway point between Ft.Worth and Knox.  We have a place there, so stopping over was a good idea.  I ADORE being out on the water, so we took the ski boat out, just for a run on the river.  It was a full boat; Jim, Diane, James (who was 6 at the time), John, Susie, Stacie and myself.  The sky was starting to swirl in grey, thunder rolled in the distance, (and is it me, or is that phrase uttered in about 37% of all country music?)and the waves started to chop.  We had ridden out to the dam, as the locks are always intriguing, and with the storm rising, we were on our way back to the house, when all of a sudden the boat just sputtered up and died.  The waves were escalating, we were fortunately drifting (if drifting is the word you can use when the boat is rocking violently back and forth) toward a dock, and yet the rain had started in buckets. The problem with drifting to this particular dock is that it was a horseshoe dock and the outer dock had big barriers that the waves terribly wanted us to crash into.  The trick became to jump out of the boat on a down wave and grab hold of ropes, all within about a 10 second period and while staying ON the dock.  We managed that, and began the process of marooned pirates saving their ship.  Quite a Herculean effort to maneuver the boat into the safety of a covering and the crook of the "h", but we finally managed it.  You think we were done with the fun?  Oh, but no!!! In my family, there is no such thing as crisis, merely adventure.  We had to find out where we were and call in for "rescuing." (I find it uncomfortable to be rescued, generally tending to take care of things myself)  We put in a call to the river patrol, which, in that county is "Mayberry RFD" in boats (with absolute no disrespect to Andy Griffith intended).  We had no way to tell them where we were.  All my Nancy Drew sleuthing skills came into play as Diane and I and climbed several stories of staircases to the main house.  And WHAT a house - wow.  Places like that are fairly private and don't have street names per se.  I just saved some time, dove into the mailbox, got an address (lets not tell the Feds about that one), made the call.  Somewhat later, Goober and Gomer came to pick us all up in the truck, still pouring down rain, so we rode in the truck bed, to the house.  I know it's anticlimactic (told you I don't tell stories well), BUT it was a fine adventure and today's storm triggered the memory.  Much like another story about a storm, and a boat.  I believe "furious squall" would be a more accurate assessment, but you can read it for yourself if you're so inclined.  It's found in the gospel of Mark (any translation will do) Chapter 4, verses 35-42. (In mine, it's on page 780 if that's helpful.) Now THAT'S a good story, and like mine -true.  "Even the wind and the waves obey him!"

      At this point, it looks like surgery is not necessary.  And I'll say "thanks be to God."  Drugs can be good.  Speaking of drugs; I'm definitely getting my money's worth.  Was violently ill yesterday.  But it was only yesterday, and I'm feeling MUCH better now.  But hey, now I can say I've had the true chemo experience, wouldn't want to miss out on anything, kind of like paying the entrance admission to MGM studios and NOT riding the "Rockin' Roller Coaster" (which is the BEST, by the way, all indoors, magnetic speed and with Aerosmith playing in the background.)  On non-medical issues, cause let's face it, I get bored with it, don't you???  I had a fun adventure this weekend.  My friend David, KNEW how much I missed camp and riding and being in the barn this summer, so he took me up to his parents barn for a trail ride.  I was like a 12 year old - jumping in hay, climbing on things and having my own cowboy moments in the woods.  I also got some good childhood North Carolina memories in from Ridgecrest and Hilltop, as we got stuck in the barn a bit because of the rain, and there's nothing like rain on a tin roof.  I'm a about pop-cultured out, I need to go read quietly.  Between campaign coverage and all the VH1 "list" shows, (vh1 is about as addictive as herion by the way) I'm getting fried.  Whoops, my "Premiere" just got here, going to go read all the summer cinema reviews.

      Today's lesson is on Radiation (ray-dee-ay-shun).  I went for the "for real this time" appointment with Dr. Bertoli.  It was higly interesting as he took the time to really explain the whole process, including the history of where this all comes from.  Now, as I LOVE history, I was completely intrigued with that portion.  Not to ever miss an opportunity to educate, here are some highlights of the history of medical diagnostics. =========================================================================================  *c. 400 BC  Disease concept introduced by Greek physician Hippocrates.    *1612 Medical Thermometer devised by Italian physician Sanctorius    *c. 1660 Light microscope developed by Dutch naturalist Antohj van Leeuwenhoek    *1810 Stethoscope invented by French physician Rene' Laennec.    *1850 - 1900 Germ theory of disease proposed by French scientist Louis Pasteur and                developed by German bacteriologist Robert Koch.    *1895 X-rays discovered by German physicist Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen. He also produced            the first x-ray picture of the body (his wife's hand) in 1895.    *1910-1912 Theory of Radioactivity published by Marie Curie and investigation of x-ray               radiation for patient therapy (e.g. treatment of cancer).    *c. 1932 Transmission electron microscope (TEM) constructed by German scientists Max             Knoll and Ernst Ruska.    *1950 Nuclear Medicine applied imaging the kidneys, heart, and skeletal system.    *1972 Computed Tomography (CT) scanning invented by British engineer Godfrey Hounsfield         of EMI Laboratories, England, and South African born physicist Allan Cormack of           Tufts University, Massachusetts.    *1984  3-Dimensional image processing using digital computers and CT or MR data, three dimensional images of bones and organs were first made.    *1985 Clinical Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning developed by scientists at the University of California.   =========================================================================================  Wasn't that fascinating??? Susie was my wingman for the day, and she and I felt like we had been in a college class.  There was also the part where we spent a great deal of time perusing through a detailed anatomy book.  Which, all in all is bloody fabulous, because one cannot be TOO informed.  Fun news is that they are getting a new IMRT system at UT Med, and that is state-of-the-art and extremely precise.  I've hit my "bounce" this week and that's a great thing.  It's pretty much when I get to the snap where I feel like ME again.    I've put a great deal of thought into taking fear out of this process.  As "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" was released at the cinema this week, I thought this quote was fitting.  "Fear of a name increases fear of a thing itself."  We have cancers all, things that mutate and rebel in our systems, only we don't notice, because it eats away at the spirit, not the body.  They go by different names; insecurity, love of self, love of things, not being able to let go of horrific pasts, comparison, envy, control. Odd, isn't it, that it takes an affliction of the body to better see the soul.  President Reagan's funeral was today.   With his eulogy, President Bush Sr. has brought the concept of a Saviour back to the media forefront, as opposed to a nebulous idea of God.  Something this country hasn't seen or embraced since 9-11.    "Wake up o sleepers"

      ....and it's something my friends know, although I do try to maintain some semblance of "cool chic" for the rest of the world.  That being said, the best way I can describe a full three days of chemo (without the nausea, because "All thanks be to God!!", I've dodged that part of it so far) is to akin it to when Wolverine is having his endoskeleton injected. If you're not an X-men fan, I really can't help you, I'm not THAT much of a nerd-nik, it's really just the best allusion I can muster.  So, today I'm lying around feeling like a 90 year old with severe arthritis and I get a phone call from John Ross, WHO is at the entertainment, sci-fi expo thing here in town. And I've lost most of you already... BUT, sweet thing that he is, was walking around to all these actors, shoving his cell phone at them and saying, "Here, talk to my theatre teacher."  (this is where the 7th grade boy part of me emerges) Because it really MADE MY DAY to talk to Ernie Hudson (Ghostbusters), Brad Dourif(Lord of the Rings), David Prowse and Anthony Daniels (Star Wars), they were very nice to take the time and chat with me! YAY!  *** Moment of Respectful Silence for President Reagan who passed away today.  He was a great man and an outstanding president.***

           Alright, maybe I'm not really in Mogadishu, but I could be, and it's such fun to say Mogadishu. This weekend was spent in much reflection and THANKFULNESS for our armed forces, past and present; from my Great-Grandaddy Wilkerson, who fought in WWI, to the mighty Eagle Battalion at Carson-Newman (always near and deat to my heart), to Marine PFC Woods Pepperman, and PFC Ben Evans. From old men to young men, family, friends and former campers/students, stand for honor and intergrity and our defense.  Of course there are those of you who aren't mentioned - sorry - I only have so much space.  If you serve our country in this capacity and you're special to me and you know it, well know that you have my deepest appreciation as well.       Besides, I'm my own war correspondent of sorts- the war for my body and the war for my spirit to NOT give into despair and self-pity. The good report is that today, it's a war that I'm winning, with Heaven's help!!! All my counts and such big lab talks - are GOOD.  Today was big day of chemo - got finished around 6pm.  Let me just clear this up and continue to take away the power of fear in these words.  Chemo-therapy is just chemical therapy.  You get a cold - they put you on an anti-biotic.  If you're a diabetic, they give you an insulin shot.  And if you have cancer, they give you a lot drugs in liquid form via an IV; it's to kill the cancer cells.  The backlash is that it kills your white blood cells too.  However, the Creator designed the body in such a way that those cells bebuild themselves!!!   And there's always fun to be found in all things. We fed Kaa this week and that's always amusing to those around (albeit a little freakish for people who aren' snake people or rat people).  True friendship keeps getting a new definition by the status of my hair. I went over to Byron and Amy's for one last as close as could be buzz - excellent times!!!  So, really by now, it's Thursday, Day 2, and I just woke up from a 3 hour nap. Not feeling badly at all, so I'm going to watch "Walking Tall" with mom and Stacie - can't get enough of the ROCK!  woo woo.  Thanks to all my wonderful visitors this week; Susie, Sean, Heather,Shelli, Amy D. and Bob M.!!!!!

        And that's the amount of time it takes for one radiation "hit."&nbsp; It had me thinking of all that can be accomplished in 254 seconds: a baby can be born, a marriage can be proposed and accepted or denied, a favourite song could play out, a soliloquy could be delivered, my darling python can consume dinner, Gretchen could vacuum up a dead spider; the possibilities are endless...      &nbsp;   There's the old tale of three blind men describing an elephant. One is feeling the trunk and deceives the elephant as a snake; one is near the tail and thinks of the elephant as thin with a bristly end.&nbsp; The last man is at the elephant's middle and thinks/feels of the elephant as a boulder. Of course, in a sense, they're ALL right. So...radiation, from my point of view, could be described as either being asleep in the back of a pickup truck as it drives through a tunnel with splices in the pavement, OR (and my preference) like being in the upper berth of a train in eastern Europe as it goes clackity-clack down the tracks. They let me listent to music (yay), so today's music selection was "Holy Road", by Lizze West - excellent CD.     &nbsp;   I'm moving to&nbsp; a new apartment on Saturday, THAT should provide entertaining tales for all of you.

      (Spoiler alert: This will only make sense if you've seen the matrix.) Since I'll be getting radiation in the mouth/throat area, a possible, probable, temporary side effect is a sore throat to where I might not want to swallow for a bit - so it's the usual procedure (although "usual" and "cancer treatment" don't go well in the same sentence, as every human body is incredibly different and complex), to get a "peg" in. Simply put, that's a small tube to my stomach to where I could pour some kind of "ensure" type thing if needed.  Well, the doctor's definition of small and my definition are TWO different ideas!!  But it's done now, and like the rest of life, now in the adaptation process.    (but I'm putting that thought on pause while I go get another cup of coffee.) K - so, let's just fast forward to the adventure of this past Tuesday.  I had scan visit to the bake factory so they can get me all aligned on the machine properly - that's where you're going to want supreme accuracy, let me tell you. They put this strechy, net-like substance over my face to where I'm pinned to the metal bench I'm laying on.  This hardens over the next few minutes to make a mask.    This is where the Matrix part comes in - ridiculous as it is, NOT TO MENTION, the sledgehammer blow to my vanity.  Here I am, laying on this metal bench, with a blue net tight over my face pinning my bald self to the table, add the freakish tube in the middle of my body and the element of the metal bench sliding though the big "stargate-type" ring. Lucas and the Wachowski bros could NOT begin to make this stuff up....  Shake and bake starts tuesday the 20th - BRING IT ON!!!  John Paul Jones said it best, "I have not yet begun to fight!"  Pop culture flash of the day:  Vh1's "I love the 90's" IS the new heroin.  Oh my gosh - good stuff!

      COLLECTIBLE CHICKEN BUCKETS from KFC?!?!?!?!?! That's so ridiculously insane, absurd, and a classic example of how we love to accumulate junk, literally; that I have nothing else to add to that.  Except I might add that the "collectibility" of the CARDBOARD chicken buckets is due to the fact that they have Nascar themes on them. Oh my beloved southland, of which I am a proud daughter.  Land of Mark Twain, Eudora Welty, Zora Neale Hurston, B.B. King and thousands of other cultural icons and now the chicken bucket.  I shake my head in puzzlement.
