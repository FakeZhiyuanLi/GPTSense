      Saturday night was the John Mayer and Maroon 5 concert.&nbsp; Or would it be Maroon 5 And John Mayer?&nbsp; John was the headliner should he be mentioned first or should Maroon 5 be mentioned first considering they came on first?&nbsp; No matter it was a great concert.  Me and two friends went.&nbsp; We stopped at Starbucks for some coffee.&nbsp; Being I only get mocha Frappacino that is what I go that time also.&nbsp; It was good.&nbsp; We did so considering we were tired while we were driving there.&nbsp; Ten minutes in the car we became tired which is not good since the concert is another 45 minutes away—so caffeine and some pumped up music was entitled to help us out in such a feat.&nbsp; It worked because we laughed and we talked and we spotted a truck with a bumper sticker that just said, “Jesus”.  No matter we arrived in 30 minutes until 7, which was show time.&nbsp; We parked and head to the pavilion.&nbsp; Back story is this, just so you know, Me and Dez had three tickets. My aunt couldn’t go so we had one to get rid of.&nbsp; We give it to Michael and he goes with us because we decided that there was no way we could sale the ticket no one wants just one ticket.&nbsp; So on the way to the concert we walked passed a single man asking for a single ticket and I decided that was a good time to eat some crow.&nbsp; But with my luck we would have never seen him had we kept the ticket.&nbsp; Anyway I made a comment on how there were a lot of preppy white people around.&nbsp; Which initiated the “Minority Counting” or “Minority Check List” or “Minority Bingo”.&nbsp; Me and Dez played such a game at all concerts we attend.&nbsp; Last time we played it at Warped Tour.&nbsp; I also stated how the preppy whiteness made me feel underdressed.&nbsp; I was punked out so to speak.&nbsp; I had none flowery and none kaki shorts.&nbsp; I had on my none button up shirt and also my none sandal shoes.&nbsp; I had on a black T-Shirt, none breathing dark gray shorts with massive pockets, black shoes like vans but not.&nbsp; All of which I bought from Wal-Mart and I do notice that they are starting to fall apart on me.&nbsp; Stupid cheap shoes.&nbsp; So I was far from the prepsters that walked all around me.  The game was a foot.&nbsp; We were to find black people, Asian people and Spanish people.&nbsp; Us three were not included.&nbsp; We did find a three black women and three black men.&nbsp; None were together. One black man was gay and the other two had white girlfriends, which then brought us to the minority couple finding.  Upon entering the concert we were checked for things in which cannot enter.&nbsp; Which made Michael crotched his camera; not really.&nbsp; He had put the camera in his pants—not pockets because they check those.&nbsp; As they checked him, made him turn around and do some stupid hockey pokey dance the camera started to slid down his pants.&nbsp; But he then had to show his ankles and he stopped the camera from sliding out. &nbsp;&nbsp;Camera in the crotch was a success.&nbsp; Camera not allowed was by sheer genius.  We checked-out the T-shirts.&nbsp; So for girls.&nbsp; On to our seats.&nbsp; Nice seats in the sun.&nbsp; There were people who had their feet on our seats.&nbsp; They must have been so happy by our arrival.&nbsp; Aw were they in for a rude awakening.  It was hot, hot, hot, hot and hot.&nbsp; No wind.&nbsp; It was the kind of hot that was icky sticky and as the night went on I could barely breath the air because it was so thick.  A DJ spun records on stage.&nbsp; He was good but I believe, even though he was black, he played “white music”.&nbsp; Which means he was pleasing the majority.&nbsp; He didn’t play anything that was cool to me just cool to the masses.&nbsp; Plus he played an R&B song that I liked but when I saw two older white women singing and dancing to it, it made me sick and ill.&nbsp; Little did I know it would only get worse.  People started coming in and no one was sitting in front or nest to us.&nbsp; Then three girls come into our row and sit right next to us.&nbsp; They come in loud. &nbsp;At first I thought I would not like them until one girl claimed not to be drunk and then said, “I don’t have the ability to stand up right.”&nbsp; They started making fun of people.&nbsp; It was hilarious.&nbsp; They were excited to be there.&nbsp; The one who was not drunk moved around a lot but stayed in her area.&nbsp; It was so entertaining.  I noticed we were in such a dead section full of old people.&nbsp; All the freakin’ time me and Dez get the dead section.&nbsp; No one wants to dance or scream or clap or anything.&nbsp; This was a dead section.&nbsp; Full of oldness that was horribly boring.  Maroon 5 comes out and everyone screams.&nbsp; Not our section.&nbsp; Well let me restate that: our section screamed—4 of us.&nbsp; Three girls and me.&nbsp; I didn’t scream I yelled two of the girls screamed like death was coming to get them.&nbsp; I laughed so hard.&nbsp; Maroon 5 was awesome.&nbsp; I liked their set and their energy.&nbsp; I really would have loved to see them again.&nbsp; But the girls stole the show.&nbsp; They talked about this woman who wore the wrong kind of shorts because she had sweat on her butt.&nbsp; They would scream “sweaty butt,” though an upgrade of the word “butt” was used.  They would scream for Marron 5 even though they did not know all of their songs.&nbsp; When they noticed the old people in front of us did not like it they screamed more loud.&nbsp; Same with the people behind us and next to them.&nbsp; They were egged on by these peoples old boring selves not clicking the screaming.  They wanted so bad to pull this clip from the older woman that sat in front of us.&nbsp; So funny were their attempts to be clever.  One would get up and dance it was funny.&nbsp; I cheered for her.&nbsp; Maroon 5 finished their short set—I wanted it to be longer.&nbsp; One of the girls had to go to the first aid because she need her bra fixed, it broke.&nbsp; Probably because her big breast broke the thing in which was supporting her.&nbsp; So her and the other one left.&nbsp; The one that stayed said she was the chaperon.&nbsp; That made the angry none moving boring old people do some unwanted talking.&nbsp;   Minority Bingo Dez points out a black couple.&nbsp; I made mention they are too old and they were not acceptable.  The old couple behind us made the dumbest comments.&nbsp; There was no tack in that ugly old woman’s words.&nbsp; She rudely and with the hick vocabulary stated how the girl on the end was being too loud and moving around too much hitting people.&nbsp; The 19 year old was irritated now and stated how it was a concert they are having fun.&nbsp; Stupid woman who is beyond dumb states in a very “I’m older listen to me,” I don’t want to have to tell the manger, which only means she wanted to say they were just having fun.  Which caused stupid man with the lack of education, who is apparently managed to hick his vocabulary, to say, “Just because they are miserable and over weight does not mean they have to make everyone else that way.”&nbsp; 19 told him he is fat too plus he is 45 looking how come he is picking on two 15 year old girl.&nbsp; The daughter of the loser parents states that 19 should respect people who are older.&nbsp; 19 stated that she isn’t going to respect her mom because she is a “bitch”.&nbsp; She shut them all up real good.  I thought it would be funny if I said, “Sir it isn’t our fault that you haven’t had sex with your wife in a long time.&nbsp; So please take your sexual frustrations out on someone other than two 15 year old girls.”&nbsp; But 19 handled it good and I was laughing too hard to even be mad enough to say anything.  I told 19 it would be funny if those girls come back quite.&nbsp; No sooner do I find that there they come back screaming hello.&nbsp; The manager talked to them and the girls were really confused.&nbsp; They were just having fun.&nbsp; They were told to stay in their chair area.&nbsp; They were pissed.  “Minority Bingo” found a Spanish couple.&nbsp; They were young enough to be entered into this hall of fame.  So because they were pissed at the stupid people around us when John Mayer cam out there was screaming as if you never heard that kind of screaming.&nbsp; The girls stood up and staid up the entire time.&nbsp; They screamed and danced all the way through not sitting once.&nbsp; The old people behind us must have been upset because they couldn’t see.&nbsp; Had they not complained so stupidly the girls would have not stood up the entire time.  I was standing up and yelling and having fun.&nbsp; But then a slow song came on and there was this voice behind me saying, “You know you want to sit down.”&nbsp; I did want to sit down but not because of the voice.&nbsp; So when I sat down I made it a point to point out how there was a guy still standing right in front of me and said, “See didn’t get what you want did you.”&nbsp; Michael said he heard a voice that told him to sit down but he said, “Sit down white boy.”&nbsp; It is funny because Michael isn’t white.&nbsp; One song later I was standing again.  When John Mayer sang No Such Thing it was awesome because there is two parts in that song that fit what occurred that night.&nbsp; One part he sings, “Stay inside the lines” and that was funny because the girls would go, “are we within our chair space?”&nbsp; Then the next part was “scream at the top of my lungs” and they would scream so loud.&nbsp; I would scream with them.&nbsp; The old people were gritting their teeth it was so funny.&nbsp;  There stupid old people behind us decided that they would leave 30 minutes early.&nbsp; So sad.&nbsp; One girl said, “Good bye have a nice evening.”&nbsp; It was funny because they didn’t say anything back and I know they heard them.&nbsp; When they left down the stairs I yelled in excitement and stated, “Old people had left.”&nbsp;   “Minority Bingo” found an Asian couple and they were young enough to be counted also.  There ends up being a guy that dances behind Michael.&nbsp; This man had no coordination or any moves that were worthy for public viewing and that is why he got laughed at by me and the girls and Michael who saw him in the corner of his eye and it freaked him out.  &nbsp; John Mayer sang my favorite song from the new CD which was Clarity.&nbsp; He sang most of his famous songs except for the one I really wanted to hear which was Stupid Mouth.&nbsp; I waited and waited and didn’t hear that one at all.&nbsp; But I am pleased because he was very entertaining and I would see him again.&nbsp; He stated how he couldn’t read the posters while he was singing because he would forget the lyrics.&nbsp; So he read them between two songs.&nbsp; He would point to one and go, “That is cool.”&nbsp; Next one, “You want to move to the front?&nbsp; Don’t know how you are going to do that.”&nbsp; Last one, “Yeah we could do that tonight.”&nbsp; He had the guys and girls sing that part of the song from Justin Temberlake’s song Senorita.&nbsp; It was cool  These two older woman come to stand behind us because they noticed that John Mayer was going to come back out for and encore.&nbsp; We yelled and clapped for him to come out.&nbsp; They gave me and Dez their tickets and we went to their seats, which were four rows from the stage.&nbsp; He came out and did some acoustic stuff it was awesome. &nbsp;&nbsp;When I got to seat where we were suppose to be this old woman taped me and told me to move out of her way because she couldn’t see.&nbsp; I wasn’t so pissed but afterwards I told Dez, “I should have told her not to touch me with her wrinkly old finger and it isn’t my fault you don’t have working cartilage so you can move to another position you freakin’ HAG!”  I decided that old people need their own kind of section in the concert area because they are boring and useless for the concert.&nbsp; Because if there was only old people in these concerts they would be dead quite and everyone would be seating down.&nbsp; This wasn’t some concert for Beethoven and his lame stupid piano of sitting.&nbsp; Old people need to know that there will be standing and screaming and they need to know to get over it.  We went and ate at Chilie’s afterwards.&nbsp; We didn’t get any water at the stupid concert because it cost to darn much.&nbsp; And the coffee didn’t help in us not getting thirsty.&nbsp; Next time we will not be drinking coffee.&nbsp; Next time I will tell old people to shove it and then some. At Chilie’s we drank two cups of water oh so fast.&nbsp; I would like to point out how John and Maroon 5 stated how we were much better than Dallas.&nbsp; That’s right Dallas sucks.&nbsp; I freakin’ hate how they get all this crap and their city is so freakin’ boring.  Old people suck and need their own section or better yet they shouldn’t even come to the concert because if screaming bothers them then how can they listen to the loud music?&nbsp; Stupid old people.&nbsp; Oh so useless.  Final Minority Bingo there was never a young black couple found.&nbsp; Therefore we lost this time around.&nbsp; There is always next time.  &nbsp;  Dork Lesson #5 it is dorky to be tired when you only drove for ten minutes to the Starbucks and still have 45 minutes until destination.&nbsp; It is dorky to play Minority Bingo and it makes it dorkier that one would keep score.&nbsp; It is dorky not to buy water at a concert and refuse to do so even though dry mouth and dehydration is settling in.&nbsp; It is dorky to laugh at three immature girls saying really bazaar stuff.&nbsp; It is not dorky to think that old people need not go to concerts if they can’t have fun, that is being smart.&nbsp; Having to state something you know is right as smart is majorly dorky in itself.

      I will be writing about my Tuesday ritual in which I watch three shows in a row.&nbsp; I may or may not do this every week.&nbsp; I have yet to decide if that is worth my time or not.&nbsp; But I guess I may.&nbsp; No matter I’ll just do this one and see what occurs next week.&nbsp; It all depends on if I’m in the mood.  &nbsp;  I watch Big Brother 5, Amazing Race 4 (I believe) and then nip/tuck.&nbsp; Each show is good and each one was entertaining on Tuesday.&nbsp; So I’ll start with the first one and work my way down.  &nbsp;  Big Brother 5 is getting interesting because of the Four Horsemen.&nbsp; They have stirred up.&nbsp; Up for leaving that stupid house full of dumb girls was Holly and Lori.&nbsp; Well Lori decided she wanted to go.&nbsp; Twin woman told her that she needed to stay.&nbsp; (I chose to remember whoever’s name is worthy of remembering.&nbsp; The twins might get the boot so I refuse to learn their names until they are worthy.&nbsp; They are too wishy-washy to be such. )&nbsp; Will and other morons (girls) decided they would do some sort of opporation, which by the way isn’t worth mentioning because the name SUCKED!!&nbsp; Their idea was stupid and of course it failed.&nbsp; One of those morons went up to Jase (after he won veto power) and told him that they all decided to vote out Lori because she wanted to go.&nbsp; Funny thing is that Jase saw through that plan and used the Veto to put up stupid mocking blond woman.&nbsp; Ha ha ha. &nbsp;Losers.  &nbsp;  The girls should have kept their alliance secret until it was right to tell.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; Losers now have two of their own up there.&nbsp; Marvin was mad that one of his picks got vetoed and Holly is staying.&nbsp; Wawa Marv you are only here because the 4 decided you are worthy.&nbsp; Not for long though.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Diane got all terry eyed because Scott called her “Trailer Trash”.&nbsp; So much for tough girl she caved in and cried.&nbsp; Wa wa wa.&nbsp; Loser.&nbsp; She started the name calling and then starts to cry because she can’t take it.&nbsp; No matter she’ll be gone soon enough.&nbsp; I predict&nbsp;Lori to be the one to go because of her money hungry self. &nbsp;  When Will talks it sounds like he needs to swallow.&nbsp; So freakin’ nasty.&nbsp; I wish he would shut it he isn’t smart enough.&nbsp; And he was all, “We have to win HOH!”&nbsp; Thanks for that point of interest.&nbsp; Duh!&nbsp; But they are so mad they can’t see straight therefore they will not win.&nbsp; Oh well no sadness from me for that stupid alliance.  &nbsp;  Funny is Michael’s sister (who by the way isn’t important enough to have her name remembered either) get all mighty on the fact that she isn’t getting the info.&nbsp; Well she hasn’t proven worthy enough to get all the info because she has yet to do anything to prove her self.&nbsp; I wouldn’t shed a tear if she got out.&nbsp; Oh well.  &nbsp;  Scott thinks he is controlling everything and his inability to notice that Jase is ruling the roost is sooooooo funny.&nbsp; Michael is a pleaser so he won’t make it.&nbsp; But Drew is friends with everyone in that house.&nbsp; I see him making it all the way to the end.  &nbsp;  Oh and the Twin girls need to notice that the guys are their best bet if they wanna live to see their other half in that house.&nbsp; Otherwise they will appear and disappear just as quick because they will be picked off by the amazing four.  &nbsp;  Next on the list is the Amazing Race.&nbsp; It is important to note that the rule that I stated about remembering names works here.  &nbsp;  Don’t like the Midget woman at all and her stupid cousin.&nbsp; Though what they did to the brothers was funny on how they got in line before them.&nbsp; But her constantly saying no one is helping them and that that is why they are not helping anyone else is stupid.&nbsp; Lame.&nbsp; I wish they would just go away and lose.&nbsp; They can’t read a map and neither of them can speak Spanish.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The models pulled a fast one on them and they are becoming my favorite team because of the way they are playing.&nbsp; They were following the cousins and notice they went the wrong way and then we they caught up to them later told them that they did wait for them but they never came.&nbsp; Stupid cousins bought it.&nbsp; Losers.  &nbsp;  The mothers are very entertaining with their laughing all the way.&nbsp; The married couple is irritating and if they go oh well.&nbsp; The twins are fun to watch swimming instead of crossing the shallow area.  &nbsp;  The father/daughter team got off on the wrong foot and could never catch up and therefore lost.&nbsp; But they almost caught up to the brothers.&nbsp; The brothers got passed by four teams because they couldn’t find the white inside of a chocolate.&nbsp; It was funny and gross.  &nbsp;  I think the Models have the best chance of winning I am rooting for them.&nbsp; They work well together and they have yet to argue with one another.&nbsp; That would go for the Mothers too.&nbsp; They are fun to watch.  &nbsp;  Nip/Tuck is a good show.&nbsp; It was good because there was no butt shots that night.&nbsp; Though I go through my hate of Christian and then like quite fast through that one episode.&nbsp; I mean it is all cool that he found someone to love but then when he lost the child he lashed out at his best friend and then asked for his wife to come over to comfort him.&nbsp; I think that was lame.&nbsp; Come on get your own comfort that isn’t someone else’s wife.  &nbsp;  McNamar’s son thought his dad wasn’t up to being brave.&nbsp; Well that changed when he got into an accident because he started showing that he wasn’t scared of dying.&nbsp; Until he went diving for Sharks with his son and realize that he didn’t want a shark to take his son and changed his mind.&nbsp; Good thing because he saved a life and his son saw.  &nbsp;  Christian cried about losing Wilber, who they renamed Gabriel, and he stated something to Wilber he said, “Remember me.” That was so touching and that was a moment I liked him.&nbsp; But then he turned around and did something self centered and again I hated him.&nbsp; Though he did find out that he was Matt’s real dad.&nbsp; She is such a stupid woman who had to have slept with Christian on her wedding day.&nbsp; Plus she is a sucky wife at the moment.&nbsp; So not suportive.  &nbsp;  Lesson #4 – Having a TV show give you a moment of sadness by the phrase “Remember me” from a damaged character is some what dorky.&nbsp; And then hating the same person in a split second, a little more dorky.&nbsp; Watching Big Brother and wishing the down fall of the stupid girls plus enjoying Jase’s cocky “know everythiness” is past dorky.&nbsp; But getting excited over Amazing Race and laughing and screaming at the TV is dorky.&nbsp; So in reality watching two reality shows in a row and then watching a drama about plastic surgery is major dorkaramaness.&nbsp; Good evening Tuesday.

      Wal-Mart how I love thee let me count the ways.&nbsp; Well not really count but say the ways that I love Wal-Mart.  &nbsp;  I could not live without a Wal-Mart.&nbsp; I mean it has everything I could ever want at a price I can actually pay.&nbsp; Dress socks for sixty cents is an awesome.&nbsp; Having caps for 7$ is too cool.&nbsp; Though the CDs are never in any recognized order the price is worth the look through the chaos.  &nbsp;  It is open 24 hours.&nbsp; That means if I need a loofa at 2:30 a.m. I can go to Wal-Mart and get one.&nbsp; How about a banana at 6:01 a.m.?&nbsp; Yes I can.&nbsp; How about a deck of cards at 10:30p.m.?&nbsp; Yes I can.&nbsp; 24 hours 7 days a week.&nbsp; I could get anything at any time.  &nbsp;  Pencil and chickens are in the same store.&nbsp; So if I wanted a baseball and spam I can go to Wal-Mart.&nbsp; If I wanted paper clips and T.V. Dinners I can go to Wal-Mart.&nbsp; If I wanted ivory soap and Bar-B-Q sauce I can go to Wal-Mart.&nbsp; I could buy all of this at 1 a.m. because why?&nbsp; That’s right 24 hours.  &nbsp;  I can not vacation in a town without a Wal-Mart.&nbsp; I could tolerate living in a small city if I have what?&nbsp; That’s right a Wal-Mart.&nbsp; It is the place to shop.  &nbsp;  I cannot go into a Wal-Mart without spending money.&nbsp; I go in for one thing like soap or a pen and come out with 4 items.&nbsp; I just cannot go in there an buy what I need.&nbsp; I go in there and get not only what I need but what I assume I’ll need in the future.  &nbsp;  I love the Gap, Old Navy, Hot Topic, and American Eagle.&nbsp; But When I don’t have the green Wal-Mart clothes are just as good.&nbsp; So is Wal-Mart’s boxer briefs, ankle sox, and wife beaters.&nbsp; I am comfortable in my Wal-Mart gear.&nbsp; It isn’t like shopping at the dumpster, though one man’s trash is another man’s treasure.  &nbsp;  It’s nice to have Micky D’s there but I only eat the Spicy McChicken.&nbsp; It is a nice little partnership there.&nbsp; That could tie them into Disney. That is the 3 Power Houses: McDonald’s, Disney and Wal-Mart.  &nbsp;  Then they have self check-out.&nbsp; That rules.&nbsp; I just have three things I can now leave quicker because I am paying through self check-out.&nbsp; Then I don’t need cash I can pay with my ATM card.&nbsp; It’s just too cool.  &nbsp;  Wal-Mart is more than just for selling walls.&nbsp; It is my sanctuary of bathroom necessities, munchies, writing helpers and chest covers (T-Shirts).&nbsp; I love the Wal-Mart.&nbsp; It is my livelihood.&nbsp; Long live the mart!&nbsp; And that is how much I love thee.  &nbsp;  Dork Lesson #3 going to Wal-Mart is dorky.&nbsp; Going to Wal-Mart in the wee hours and excited to do so is Dorky.&nbsp; Going to Wal-Mart for one thing and coming out with 4 items that are not the one and plus the reason of going in is dorky.&nbsp; Being a master at self-check out is dorky.&nbsp; Thinking there is nothing wrong with my obsession with Wal-Mart is uber dorky.

      Are Summer movies suppose to be some sort of revelation? I wouldn't think so. *Sneeze* I'm allergic to . . . well you know if you saw the movie.    I, Robot  isn't some sort of highly evolved movie, like they claim the robots are. Whoever expects it to be such needs to check on how often they see movies during the summer and then ask themselves how dumb are they for thinking that. Their answer should be, "Very."   This movie was suppose to be fun and a little thought provoking but not all out intellectual. People expect too much from Summer.&nbsp;&nbsp;If they wanted this movie to make some sort of point they would have made a boring documentary.   Acting was good. There is some good one liners in it. I like the one scene at the end of the movie that has the two main characters battling the robots. That scene was awesome because of the camera work. If that failed to make you amazed then just never go to the movies again becuase you will never be amazed. It was awesome because I'm afraid of heightsand it had my palms sweating from the spinning of the camera and the height.   The idea behind  I, Robot  isn't new because it has been done countless times. I can't say there is a movie that has been made that hasn't already been discussed one way or another by a previous movie. That's too much to ask of every movie and expecially a summer one.   If you decide to go see this movie don't set your expectations too high and I assure you, you will not have anything to cry about. It isn't a torture session. If you happen to figure out the ending that's nice. Who couldn't? I would be worried if you saw it and didn't fgure it out.    I, Robot  was a good popcorn film. It entertained me as it should have and I would see it again should I chose to or I might even buy it. *Wink* A- because it is what I expect out of a Summer movie. No need to think just sit back and enjoy.   So what is dorky lesson #2? Sweaty palms. When watching a movie and your palms start sweating at the mere fake height in which the actors are fighting and jumping about makes you a dork. And if you are reading this and the mere thought is causing you to sweat, or you are typing and your palms are sweating because you are typing abut being high you are a dork.      **********SPOILER**********           I love the part of the movie where the girl says, "Was that suppose to be funny?"     And Will's character saying after he sneezed, "I'm allergic to B.S." Great stuff.

      I saw Arthur this weekend.  Normally someone would give you the name of the actors and yada, yada, yada but I’m not.  I don’t feel like being like everyone else.  They tell you what else they played in and do all that research.  Please that’s lazy.  I’m not going to allow my readers to get lazy.  Do you want to know who is in this movie and what other movie they are in it is best you take yourself to Yahoo! and use them to figure all that lovely stuff.  I’m just going to tell you what I thought about the movie.  If I so happen to like the actor enough I may give them mention but otherwise no free shout outs from me.    It was an interesting retelling of an old tail.  Stating that Arthur was around during Roman times is fascinating.  They were called knights but they didn’t dress like knights.  They did have a round table which I really liked.  I would love to have a table like that.  That would be so awesome.  If it was made of wood it would make it better.  Cause if it was plastic I would find it not cool.  Wood is better.  The acting was good.  Nothing to scream Oscar about and nothing to complain about.  I did like this one scene where the knights horses were acting up and they all looked at one another and without one single word they all agreed to do something.  That was the best scene in the entire movie.  I loved it because they didn’t say one word but I knew what they were all thinking.  It was better than all the fight scenes because it had feeling without having it over the top.  Well done.  Speaking of the action I think it was done just fine.  It isn’t something that I would say was remarkable but there are a couple of cool shots during the fighting.  They don’t disappoint too much with that.  Though I wouldn’t say it is worth the admission if you chose to see it based on that.  It is more of a story with action then action with story.  The story was good it had some touching moments that I liked.  Should I share them it wouldn’t be a nice little dramatic surprise so I will not be doing that.  The lines were decent.  They had a couple of one liners that were good.  It had me laughing and thinking and a one or two times I did feel sad enough to shed a tear had I not been surround by people I don’t like sharing my tear with.  These people being people I would never see again though I don’t share with people I never see again that easily.  They are hard to share with because they may think I’m weird for doing that near them.  Sniffing my snot in their ear may not want them to ever sit next to me again should I be in the same theater with them in the future.  So Arthur was a good movie.  I’d give it a B+ from beginning to end.  I wouldn’t be seeing it again in the theater but I might see it again should someone rent it.  Do I recommend people to see it?  They don’t have to see it but I don’t think it is something that will kill you should one of your friend suggest it as a movie to see one night.  Just so you know it is long and you may doze off during it if you don’t like long movies.  Dork lesson number 1# you should be afraid to share so much emotion in front of people you will never see again because that way you look like you are being a tough guy but you are really just not comfortable with yourself enough to allow tears and snot to flow freely enough that there is a remote possibility it might hit the person next to you.  That and having a tear try and push its way out during a movie about knights.  That is dorky.

      My first blog how interesting it will get. Dork will explain everything that is ever found in this blog. There will be things only dorks will get. What is a dork? That is sort of what I will be investigating while doing this blog. There are things I have yet to find out about myself that would explain that better than a dictionary definition.  So that is one of the things that will be figured out during my time on this. What is a dork. I suppose I can state at the end of each entry what made that entry a dork and at the end of several entries I will have a list of what makes a dork. Some sort of list that will be incomplete because there is more to come. I’m liking this idea. See that is dorky—coming up with something that wasn’t thought out before. See I’m typing this out without having some sort of outline. That could be seen as lame but hey I see it as dorky so that is all that matters.  What will be here other than dorky stuff? That is hard to tell. I am thinking that there will be cool stuff because dorky I may be but cool is first and foremost. I am into giving my opinion and I guess that is what I’ll be doing. I could write what I saw this past weekend and write about it or go off about dumb people on the road. But all this will be done in dork style. It may be odd to you but to the natural dork it will be the common language that bonds us together. For when we find each other over the internet or in person we become bonded with this special link. We are dorks.  One dork to find them and several to bind them but only one dork can rule them all and I will prove to you why I’m the king of such dorks. Welcome to my blog and may your stay not only be entertaining but may you feel dorkier once you leave. Otherwise I have failed.

      Friday was my cool double feature day.  On my plate was Collateral and Napoleon Dynamite.  No Dez this weekend she is off at a wedding it was just me.  Me and me all alone which would be sad but I am far from boring even when alone.  My favorite movie theater would be the one that is called AMC 30.  I love how incredibly ghetto it is.   My favorite of all theaters it is so comfortable and cool and people are just normal.  Then there are other theaters that I tend to go to only because it is the last resort.  It would happen today because that is the way things go.   I was to go with my aunt but she didn’t want to go today so that was a bust.  I had a time to go at AMC 30 but it was too late for that one. Therefore the next best time was at AMC 20.  Well the other reason was because AMC 30 has ticket guards and I’m not up to giving my money to anything other than Collateral.  So AMC 20 was my choice.  AMC 20 is located in the rich part of town and it is where preppy was born.  It happened to also be Friday and people like Friday so much that they drop their kids off at the mall and leave them there.  Which makes it some kind of big baby sitting area and I do not like that one bit.  So I have to suck it up and go there because I really want to see movies.  I am running late.  I have to speed all the way there which sucks in itself because of the construction that is occurring around my home area.  Crap heads.  I am almost to the mall in where I am to see the movie and I end up having a moron want to get in front of me before the lanes merge.  Okay fine but he decides to go slow.  Butt monkey.  I hate when people do that.  I wish my car had some sort of cannon that would disable stupid cars like that.  Anyway no matter I get to zoom past his slow butt later and head for Wal-Mart because I need money and some yummy snacks.  I get into Wal-Mart and get 3 packs of the yummy beef jerky and some tea.  I use self checkout like a pro and I am off to the movies.  I love it because I get there five minutes before the movie is to start and I speed walk my self into that mall.  I see all the weird white posers that frequent that mall and think they would get their butt kicks if they were in my favorite side of town.  No line so I get my ticket quickly and get into the theater and there was one preview before the movie started.  I am good.   Collateral is about a taxi driver who ends up getting a ride that is a ride that changes his life forever.  He is made to do things he would never do.  It sort of an interesting event that causes some sort of confidence that he never knew he had.  Vincent is the fair from hell for he has taxi driver man drive him to each kill.  He would try to break him down by talking to him but Vincent is a smart one he is always 5 steps ahead.  I liked the movie. It was a thinking thriller.  It had some very interesting concepts that it put out there as to why things are done by people and that is a very fascinating thing to me.  Tom Cruise was a very good bad guy.  I really didn’t like him towards the end.  I did like the end because it tied in what was already discussed in the middle of the movie.  There is a part where it shows the inability of communication between Cops and FBI I think that is freaky.  Plan people because that is the way things should be handled.  Winging it when someone’s life is on the line isn’t the smartest thing to do.  I give this movie a A-.  I liked it that much.  Weird.  Well I don’t like it enough to shell out the money to by it nor do I think I will see it again.  But Tommy boy did a good job I give him so thumbs up. How about a good 7 because that is good and because Ebert doesn’t even have 7 fingers no matter how many people could weigh his weight.   That was the end of that movie and when the end comes that means I get up out of my seat and I go to the restroom and I wash my hands.  Interesting place the restroom, they have these things called sinks.  Now I don’t know if they have them in every restroom and bathroom in the world but they are cool things.  Why are they cool?  Well let me share that very prudent information:   they have the ability to sanitize your hands when soap is used.  Which happens to be the very happy companion of the sink and they both love to be used.  Weird I know but true they like to be used because that is why they are there.  A few guys are at this sink and some leave and I use it and what do you know there isn’t a drop of soap in that soap giver outer.  Hummm what does that mean?  That means they didn’t wash their hands.  They go off and touch their girlfriends and their children and the handle and all they spread their penis germs all over.  Which is why I try not to touch the handle I rather not have a handle on their penis when doing so. Because that is what you are touching when you touch something they touch and they didn’t wash their hands.  Nasty.  I wash.  I then take my body and sit down in the theater that is small for Napoleon Dynamite.  It was about 20 minutes before it was to start.  There were five kids in there.  I was content with that amount.  I sit down where I could put my feet up on this bar.   I would hit the bar with my foot making it vibrate.  It was good fun for 3 seconds.  Then more children wonder it.  It isn’t until there were lots of children that I realized it is PG movie.  Sucks.  I should never see a PG movie again.  Children are fine but these jabber boxes wouldn’t talk in their 12 inch voices to each other.   No they think that because they have blond hair and blue eyes it is best to yell so that others can see how big their mouth is.  The stupid whores that sat behind me had to kick my chair.  Which is only fine because they were getting up and sitting down otherwise I would have shot them in the breast had I not forgot my breast gun in the car.  Darn it.  Then there were to stupid whores that sat beside me and jabbered through the entire previews and wouldn’t shut up.  They talked like they’ve never talked to each other ever.  Why do people go to the movies and have conversations during the preview and the movie I have no idea?  Losers.  I was going to say something but it is only the preview so I allow it for now. They did end up shutting their useless mouths up so I could enjoy the movie.  Napoleon Dynamite was very funny.  I liked how they did the credits at the beginning, very creative.  The way that guy did his lines was funny.  He would exaggerate some of the lines and that made what he said ten times more funny.  The lethargic way some of the actors acted was pure comic genius for this movie.  Napoleon’s talking on the phone is funny because he had to be out of the room so no one could hear him talk on the phone.  Nothing has made me laugh like the way he dances.  This movie was clean humor and it was funny.  I like that they didn’t have to go raunchy on me.  During the movie, because I was sitting with posers of the universe club, a guy thought it would be funny to squeak his shoe against the floor.  Wow the coolness in that.  So lame.  He got yelled at and he stopped.  If he was really cool he would have continued to do it.  What else was lame was the fact that during the movie there is a part where they play the theme of the A Team and I was thinking, “These morons in this theater haven’t a clue what that is.”  I was one of four that would recognize that music.  I hate that theater.  Want another reason as to why I hate that theater?  Okay, stupid blond bimbos behind me stood up and bimbo number 1 said, “That is a reason why you shouldn’t be a dork.”  I wanted so bad to say, “And that is a reason why you are a whore.”  But being I was surrounded by cookie cutters I decided that wouldn’t be one of the great situations to say something.  I would save face and move on with life thinking she is a whore and all whores do are open up when they should close shop.  Whore.  Napoleon Dynamite gets an A+ from me and I will buy this movie in remembrance of the stupid morons I watched the movie with.  So I leave the theater and walk to my car. I walk there and I hear this R&B music booming and I watch the car park and out pops a white boy with his gangster gear on and I just thought, “I hate this theater” and “they would so die in my theater” so true.  I was very vanillaed out.  It was Tax Free Weekend and I decided to go to this clothing store to by some shirts.  They had shirts for ½ off and tax free.  So I went looking through the cool stuff for my stuff and found a shirt that said, “Sarcasm one service I offer.” I love that shirt.  Bought it.  There was one I bought for a friend that said, “Rock is dead.  Long live paper and scissors.”  So cool.  I also got a shirt that said Dukes of Hazzards and I am wearing it right now.  Also I saw a shirt that said, “This is the I don’t give a crap shirt.”  I loved that one.  I didn’t have the money for it but it was funny.  Next time I guess.  I did have to make a stop at Wal-Mart because I wanted to look at their CDs.  I did happen to by a CD by Joe Nickels but only because it was 9 dollars.  Then I did a nice search through shirts and I bought several which includes one that states “Slacker”.  I am a shirtaholic and I need a 12 step program please help me.  I bought 4 shirts at the other store and then 6 at the WallyMart so I need the help.  Help me.  Dork Lesson #9 Caring which theater you are to go to is dorky.  Having to go to Wal-Mart even though there isn’t enough time is dorky.  Sitting in a movie and forgetting what the rating is, is dorky.  Sitting in the theater and hating the people in it because they dissever to be hated is dorky.  Thinking instead of saying what is on your mind for fear a mob will kill you and you would be a dead minority in a sea of white is dorky.  Loving shirts that have funny sayings on them just because is dorky.  Going to Wal-Mart and buying shirts close to midnight is dorky.  Being a shirtaholic is dorky.  But the to be a major dork you have to have invented the word shirtaholic.

      Movie day that was what it was last week when me and Dez went to go see movies.  We were going to go and see The Village and White Castle with the two names I can say but cannot spell.  Oh Henry is one name the other has 5 U’s or whatever.  Anyway that was the plan.  Considering we wanted to laugh second we decided to go and see the Village first.  But before we venture to see such a movie we needed the Wal-Mart.  We had a good fifteen minutes and it was Sunday so we were not afraid of anything taking too long.  It was salty day for me I got some beef jerky and water.  Oh and that stuff they stick by the cashier I look at all the time.  They stick that stuff there for people like me.  I saw some Trident citrus gum and I had to get some.  I was going to get something else but Dez told me to quit.  So I did.  She got the citrus too.  See it works.  So we head to the theater and when we start to see the line we see there is a line.  What in the world?  It is freakin’ Sunday why is there a line?  Well there was two lines and both lines only had one person doing tickets.  Okay that explains some of it but what was up with the . . . . oh there was old people.  Everything was explained then.  It was hot and no wind and there was a line of ten people in front of us and our movie started in like 1 minute.  Well then there is 15 minutes of previews.  We ran through other possibilities of how we could see the movies we wanted but we just wanted to see the Village first.  So we stuck with the idea.   Funny thing about old people they say some really stupid things.  This old couple in front of us could barely walk.  There soon were two people handing out tickets for our line and one was open and the old man said, “Open your eyes buddy” to the next person in line and proceeds to say how slow people are as he hobbles to catch up with his wife.  Yeah okay buddy.  Good one.  You keep believing you are not a snail and I’m sure it will be so.  We get our tickets and head inside to our theater.  We made it just in time for it was only the beginning credits.  That was so cool.  I was excited to see this movie.  Being that I’ve seen all the director’s other movies and of them Signs being my favorite I was sure I would like this one.  So we had to find a seat.  Well normal movies would have a bright screen shot and then I could see where we could go.  The Village was not normal and therefore left us in the dark.  Nice.  I decided we should just sit in the row in front of us and I tried to see if there was anyone there and there wasn’t, until I went closer and a leg moved.  It was freakin’ dark and I was laughing because I couldn’t see my own feet.  We sit down and enjoy the entire movie.  I can’t get into what the entire movie is about because that would ruin the concept it was trying to hide in the trailers.  I would like to say that the trailers are not deceptive, they are not trying to make you think it is scary it is just not enough to put into the trailer without giving away the plot.  I liked the trailer because I like not knowing the entire movie upon seeing the trailers.  So don’t think it is scary because it isn’t.  It has moments that are but as a whole it is more of a thinking movie then an actually “scary movie”.  You keep that in mind and you will be fine.  Oh and if you didn’t like Signs you probably will not like this movie.  It isn’t fast.  It is slow.  But the lines in this movie are so well done.  I love that about this movie.  The lines are so good.  I love the scene that is between Ivey and Lucius on her porch.  It was such a well done scene in the movie and one of my all time favorites.   Ivey is such a great character and is so well acted by the one that played her.  Bryce Dallas Howard, daughter of the director of the same last name, is Ivey.  She is a special case and I will mention her only because I think the way she acted in this movie is warrant of some kind of award, even if it isn’t an Oscar.  She was outstanding and I have yet to see anyone top that this year.  The ending may cause some sort of hate towards the movie but it was to my liking.  Oh well to those who don’t like it you aren’t cool enough to.  As for the “twist”, if you really believe there to be one, don’t be disappointed if you figure it out.  It isn’t like you are some kind of genius or the Director/Writer was some kind of lameiod—it is because this time around it isn’t about the twist as much as it is about the reason.  Speaking of the Director he is in the movie and I will only say his reflection is caught and that is all I can say on that.  The Village gets and A+ from me because of the lines, the idea, the great acting, the great story and it is a smart film that only a few will find so.  The ending left me and Dez laughing because others would hate it.  We both liked it.  Anyway we didn’t have time to sit there and ponder it all the way through.  We got up and headed for the next movie, White Castle.  We noticed they had posted an employee who would be checking tickets on that side of the theater and if you didn’t have a ticket for that movie you couldn’t pass.  I thought he wouldn’t care if we did but I wasn’t in a risk taking mood.  Though we decided to stand outside the exit door and wait for someone to come out so we could go in.  Did someone come out?  No.  We decided to go buy the tickets.  Then a group came out the exit when we were already on our way to buy tickets.  Mad?  Yes I was.  I told her the movie better not be on that side of the theater, and when we got our tickets it was.  We get to the guy and he didn’t even bother looking at the tickets.  Mad?  No very upset that I was so stupid for not trying.  We are sitting there watching this movie.  Laughing and laughing and waiting for more laughing when the power in the theater went out.  The power came on and the film burned.  A good ten minutes passed before it was up and running again.  People were all about getting their money back.  Whatever losers sit down shut up and watch the movie.   Though I was hoping it wouldn’t ruin my timing considering I was hoping to get home in time to watch ABC the Days because I really like that show a lot.  White Castle was funny.  The pot smoking antics of two young minorities was a funny tail.  Patrick Harris’ appearance was funny the movie was just good fun and I enjoyed it.  Would I end up buying such a movie?  No.  But would I see it again?  Yes because there were parts that made me laugh like the peeing in the forests.  It was like a real life scene stolen from real life.  Peeing in the forests and then someone comes and pees right next to you when there is all kinds of foliage for them to pee on.  Then there are the dumb white extreme sports morons which added some laughs.  “Come again.” Ha ha.   White Castle did make me want some White Castle.  Yummy looking I was hungry.  I give this movie a B+ it made me laugh and I wasn’t too mad at the false start and it was worth paying for so there.  When me and Dez left we saw there was no guy standing there.  That made us even more angry at the fact there wasn’t and we paid for our tickets.  But we were good that day we didn’t sneak anywhere we were not suppose to.    Dork Lesson #8  Being in a check out line and having the things like gum and stuff call your attention long enough that you start wanting all of what you see and then getting most of what you see is dorky.  Deciding to sneak into the next movie and then end up having to pay for it anyway is dorky.  Obsessing over the fact that you could have got away with it is dorky.  Liking the Village ending and laughing because others will not is being very dorky. LOL.

      I went to the 3 Doors Down and Nickleback Concert. Me and Dez again. This time we were late. We missed 12 Stones but I was sure we would catch Puddle of Mudd. We passed up the grope team—the ones who check to see if I’m harmful, more on that later—and we are inside hearing Puddle of Mudd playing.  Dez gets on her phone because someone calls her and I hear that they are playing the one song that I wanted to hear them play and I run ahead so that I could watch them play this song. “She F****ing Hates Me.” Such a great song it is and I am so glad I got to hear it. “Throw your middle fingers in the air!” It is funny everyone did exactly as he said. I mean there is so much talk about not being sheep and then they go to the concert and they do exactly as they are told, which makes them all look like copy cats—something they were trying to avoid. I have no qualms with it, I just found it funny.  Me and Dez were on the lawn. We tried to find a good spot. We stood next to this couple. The girl stated she had no idea why this woman would wear those kind of clothes. I look and see this big woman with legs that did not look like they could support that kind of weight. She wore a Shakespeare type shirt and a jean skirt that showed off those chicken legs. She also had make-up that one would only find on a cadaver that was prepped for a wake. Freak.  Nickleback comes on stage and everyone stands up. This white man stood up and I couldn’t see passed him. So I said, “Stupid white man is in my way.” It was funny because there were white people in front of me that looked perturbed at what I said. I care not—though I bet I was a topic of conversation—because I would have said stupid black man, stupid Mexican, stupid Japanese man. It just so happens to have been a white man.  Me and Dez move down the hill. We found a nice spot where we could see Nickleback. At this spot we are then surrounded by young people. The eight guys in front of us would mosh with one another during the chorus of some of their songs. It was very entertaining. Then there was a group of 4 guys and one girl to the right. The girl would get frustrated when anyone would block her view of the stage. The 4 guys talked about this other girl who was 2 feet in front of them. She figured it out and was not happy. One of the guys kept mocking her and talking about her the entire time. He continued all through the concert. Even though he was checking her out all night long.  Then to our upper left were the dumb jocks. They may not have all been dumb jocks but that is what they reminded me of. No girl friends and pretending to be gay with one another. One in particular would inch closer and closer to me. He was drunk. So I hope that explains all his attention to the left side of my body. Then he bust out with this stupid jock comment, “Nickleback is cooler because he cussed more (than 3 Doors Down).” 1st he didn’t know his name is Chad Kroger and 2nd he liked the amount of cussing over the playing. Stupid.  Nickleback was very entertaining. There was hard playing, pyrotechnics, lots of fireworks, and they played a Metallica Cover. Then there was the drinking game and Beer O’Clock. Their hour of play Chad would scream, “Drink” at random moments and there would be loud cheers for his single word. Then he brought out beer in plastic cups and tossed the cups to the people that were in the pit. I thought it would have been cooler to have given everyone a cup—that wanted one—and bring out a keg and spray everyone with beer. My idea is so much better and I would so love to have been down there if that is what they did. I told Dez if she was there and got sprayed with beer then went home her mother would know and wake up. Even if she didn’t wake up she would smell it in the morning and know it was her daughter. Hahaha very funny. Poor Dez.  Nickleback was good, I liked them but they did not have the songs I liked. Maybe 3 songs they played I really liked but I was there for 3 Doors Down and all of their songs. They did have an awesome show going on. They had things pop up on screen that were wicked cool and I did wish to have that screen in my house so I could be wicked cool to but oh well a dork cannot be such.  Okay I was having fun listening to the music, rockin’ my head to the drums when all of the sudden there comes this woman. Not just any woman a woman dressed in a Shakespeare shirt and jean skirt with the skinny legs that make me wanna puke. We got a special appearance by Shakespeare woman. I had forgotten all about her and she had to come up the hill in my line of vision and ruin my moment because she had to chose to walk where ever the hell she walked to and had to come back up an violate my vision. Whore.  3 Doors Down was very good. They sang all the songs I wanted to hear. They had lasers and cool graphics on if kryptonite on the screen. Loser, which was their encore, was the song I forgot all about. I felt, needles to say, like a loser for forgetting. This would be the forth time I’ve seen them. They were just as good as the first time, which was good. There was a nice drum solo. They were filming some sort of 3 Doors Down movie there. So we had to work up our excitement for the camera. When the band was off stage before the encore dumb jock screamed 32.50, which is the cost of the ticket, he had to think that was going to give him a laugh—which it did. There was not a laugh from me. Jocks lack any sort of wit. It was like they traded all use of the brain for all use of the muscles; which must work out great for them, no pun intended. There had to be a dunk old man dancing off balance or it wouldn’t be a concert with beer, and there was. He was dancing and wasn’t instep with anything that would be called a beat.  During the slow songs there was lighters, which is always cool, that shot up into the air with arms attached. It is just a great sight to see all the lighters up at an out door concert. But I laughed because I can’t bring in a camera or candy but it is a ok to bring in a lighter—something that can set many things a fire. And if I am not mistaken fire can kill. Stupid rules made by people who lack the comprehension to see how dumb that really is.  How about this rule—the rule where when I stand in an open area people draw close to me for a touch of skin. The Jocks moved in and they 8 guys moved back. Dez told me we could move and I did not wanna move. They should have to move they are the one into the moving. How about the other rule of where Dez and I have to stand or sit in the boring section s because when we moved further down the hill, during the encore, we felt the excitement of the people there. I guess that would be because we moved away from the yawn fest. We screamed and yelled more.  Why couldn’t I scream where I was—uhm I don’t want the unwanted attention. Double negative? Not really caring at this point. All I needed was to be called some sort of name because I think I might have snapped and took a light and lit them afire and pushed them down the hill and they would explode because of all the alcohol that was covering that grass. Plus they would take out some of the people and I would get away without being caught because I don’t think there were enough brains surrounding me to understand that their lighter could start fires.  Speaking of beer I thought it was funny when we were finding our standing area that this woman had just got some beer and she like split a little and then had a four letter fall out of her mouth. I told Dez how important it is not to spill even a little bit of beer. It was like someone died or they stumped their toe when they did that. Spill water: fine. Spill beer: it is like you lost your best friend.  Oh yeah and our Minority Bingo thing we found a lot of Hispanic people there so I said that they must love Nickleback. But we were not in any luck to find a black couple, we found Asian and Hispanic couples but none of them were Black. Our game was a bust.  The concert was as a whole I would give a B+. Nickleback seems to just want to be a crowd pleaser then themselves. Excessive cussing and talking about drinking. But it is possible they are all about that, I suppose. Which would not make me like them anymore if that was so. They did know how to work the crowd though. 3 Doors Down did rock out to me. They sang all the songs I wanted to hear. I just think when I saw them last year and I was in the pit and they were with Our Lady Peace it was much better. Plus I think the Woodlands sucks as a cool place to see bands. They suck and need to be more fun oriented and lest restricted access.  Dork Less #7 Thinking you are a people magnet when in fact you are more likely to repel any human from talking to you is dorky. When you need others to get excited for any event, such as a concert, you show signs of dorkness. Thinking of harming people via a lighter can be considered dorky as long as the consideration doesn’t go any further as in actually planning it. Then you get into murder’s territory and I haven’t a clue about that. Yet. =)

       So I went to the movies as I always do on Friday night and this time I went and saw The Bourne Supremacy being that I saw the first one.  I wasn’t all excited for this movie but oh well I went anyway.  At least I didn’t go by myself I had friends.  I do have friends outside this internet world.  As always we went to Wal-Mart first to get something to snack on during the movie.  I was looking at this candy and I pronounced wrong according to my friends.  Therefore since I pronounced it wrong I announced how I wouldn’t buy it because I didn’t disserve to buy it.  I ended up buying chocolate cover raisins and funions or however they are spelt.  And I needed something to drink so I wanted Pepis because I am so persuaded to buy their crap because of the billion dollars I “could” win.  But no the stupid machine was broken.  So I had to deal with drinking water.  Which then one of my friends proceeds to talk about how they had a dream about the water and its pronunciation of it.  Isn’t that nice?  He is such an uber nerd that he has dreams about how things are pronounced.  That’s wonderful.  We were meeting Churney there.  She is black and though you may not find it necessary for me to have mentioned that I did so deal with it.  Really there is a mild reason as to why I even bothered noticing and stating what color skin she possesses.  We go and sit down in the theater and Churney wanted to know when I was going to get up and get stuff so that I can be her nice little servant and get her something also.  Though some may state this as smart because she didn’t have to get up I state that it is lazy.  But I don’t say it out loud.  There are times when things should be kept to one’s self in order to avoid any unwanted vocal statements and this was one of those times.  Actually with her there are many times like that but during those times I rarely even care to take into consideration her reaction.  So volcanic she is it really doesn’t matter what I say she would just explode or implode.   Anyway the movie previews start and after each one I crack jokes about how a black person wouldn’t do this or that.  But then there comes a movie about a white couple that gets left in the middle of the ocean while shark diving.  I state how there is no way that a black person would stay there.  But the truth of the matter is there is no way a black person would even consider going shark diving.  Or as Churney would put it they wouldn’t be stupid enough to do so.  I would be forced to agree.  So was the movie good and worth the money and my time?  I have to say Matt Damon is impressive with all of his own stunts.  Bourne is being chased again but this time for something he didn’t do.  He isn’t too happy because he thinks the CIA did something to him and so he is after them and they didn’t have anything to do with it.  There is a scene that is cool the one they showed in the preview of him stating he can see them through their window.  That scene is cool.  There really aren’t any cool lines or anything else I liked to state that was cool.  But I have to say this character of his is very smart and knows what he is doing which is good because there is suppose to be a third one.  To me this movie is similar to the first one and that is how I liked it.  I liked it as much as I liked the first one.  I would state if you liked the first one you would like this one but then my brother went and saw it and had to ruin that statement for me.  He didn’t like it as much as the first one and it is for the same reason I sort of found it irritating.  That is because the camera did a lot of bouncing around.  It would swing this way and that.  For the most part it looked like it was a handheld camera and that just looked like crap.  It reminded me of Daredevil and how the action scenes were too close and the camera was flying all over without staying in a fixed area so I could enjoy the action.  But it does have a better ending than the first one.  Or so I thought.  I freakin’ hate the ending to the first one with the happy little beach ending.  Bla.  Not too cool for a spy movie to end in such a state.  But this one ends much better and it isn’t so happy.  I didn’t think it was a grand thriller but I didn’t think it was a horrible thriller.  I would have to give it a B just like I gave the first one because there really isn’t any reason to give it more or make me want to see it again.   Dork Lesson #6 – Not getting some kind of candy because you fail to pronounce it correctly is dorky.  Or that is just lame.  Telling your friend that is black the reason there is no black people in this trailer and that one is dorky.  Not being excited to see a movie but seeing it just because you saw the first one is dorky.  And posting this review even though it is crapy—which cannot be blamed on you when the movie itself wasn’t something worthy of putting great as a description of it—because you want to have more entries in your blog is such the way of the dork.
