      So over the past few months, if you had walked past the Sears on Madison and State, like I do every day on my way to work, if you were paying attention, you would have noticed that the mannequins were wearing  swimsuits  and  penny loafers . Actually, they weren't  wearing  penny loafers, their feet were molded into likenesses of penny loafers. Way to go Sears marketing geniuses. Now&nbsp; I know why nobody wants to shop at your crappy store. I guess they were too cheap to buy mannequins with bare feet, for just one season. They thought nobody would notice, but HA! I notice everything. At least the penny loafers fit in for fall. NOT! Because now they have mannequins wearing  pajamas  and  bath robes  with their penny loafers. Maybe one day the idiots at Sears will be gazing out of their window at the Gap across the street, and realize that they could save money  and  be&nbsp;less ridiculous&nbsp;by getting rid of their lame ass penny loafer mannequins and hanging the clothes on body-shaped peices of plastic with no heads/arms/legs. Those things probably cost like $5  and  they don't piss people off who have to look at them every day. And come on, these mannequins don't have hair or facial features, but they are wearing  penny loafers ? That's some stupid ass shit.   Yes, I know I am crazy.

      So today I left for work like 30 minutes later than I normally do, yet I still got to work on time. And I don't usually show up 30 minutes early or anything. I'm not sure how that worked out. I think I have discovered my secret super&nbsp;power: The ability to always be on time. Because now that I think about it, I don't think I have ever been late to anything in my entire life. In fact, I bet I could leave for work at 9:30, and still get here by 9:00. That's why it's a super power. I mean, it's not as cool as being able to fly, or go invisible, but still.

      Say you are eating cherries and most of them aren't very good. They are too ripe or not ripe enough, whatever. So you are finishing the handful of not so good cherries that you grabbed, and the very last cherry is absolutely delicious. It's nice and dark red, and firm yet juicy, overall a very good cherry. So then you go back to the fridge, get another handful of cherries, and unfortunately, again, most of these aren't very good. Here's the weird thing: If all the cherries had been good, you would have stopped after the first handful. It is the hunt for the elusive good cherry that causes you to keep going back to the fridge. It's like you have this need to eat 10 good cherries, and you have to eat 10 damn it, regardless of if they are the first 10, or if it's 10 good cherries out of 100! You might think this has never happened to you, but it has, you just never noticed it before. Watch.  mmm, cherries are good.

      I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 last night, and, to my surprise, really didn't like the movie. I was disappointed that the movie really didn't offer any information that I already did not know. I was also surprised at some of the things that were said. For example, Michael Moore chastised Bush for not sending more troops into afghanistan, and more aggressively pursuing Osama bin Laden. However Michael Moore has previously stated that bin Laden should be presumed innocent until proven guilty, and that our actions in Afganistan were thus unjustified. I was also surprised that he spent so much time speaking about bin Laden's family, their contacts with the Bush family, and their flight from the country after 9/11. I was under the impression that the bin Laden family disapproved of Osama, and had cut off contact with him long ago. I would be willing to accept that the media had misled us (as they often do), and that my impression was incorrect, but Moore did not offer evidence to that effect.   I guess I feel like Moore would say  anything , even things that he doesn't quite agree with, or that he knows might not be representing completely accurately, to make his point. And if I was angry with Bush for lying to the American public to further his own agenda, than I can't accept similar behavior from Moore, even if I agree with that agenda.   so I pretty much think that if I, someone who STRONGLY disapproves of the president, and the war, was so unconvinced by this movie, then the chances of someone who intended to vote for Bush before seeing the movie will probably not be swayed. But who knows.    I guess that the average American is more likely to see this movie than to go out and read a whole book, but I would reccommend the book "Dreaming War" by Gore Vidal. Vidal makes many of the same points as Moore, in what I felt was a more intelligent manner. The fact that I'd read this book before seeing the movie did not help me to enjoy the movie more. I'm sure the movie would have been much more moving to someone who had not heard some of the shocking points that Moore makes. So I can admit that the movie did have that value. And I also admit that I found several of the scenes moving. I was just disappointed that the movie wasn't all I had hoped for.  I haven't talked to too many people about this yet. I've been reading reviews, and it seems like EVERYONE likes this movie. I'm curious whether any other democrats didn't like the movie. Maybe I am just weird.
