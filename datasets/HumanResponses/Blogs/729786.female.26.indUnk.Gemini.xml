      Did you know that tofu doesn't taste like anything at all? It's like a solid mass of water. No taste, fleeting texture. Fat-free tofu mayonnaise is so-o-o muh worse than tofu, however. It tastes like tofu (nothing), after being slathered in Eau de Hot Ass. The upside is, by including fat-free tofu mayonnaise as part of a weight-loss diet regimen, your chances of success are improved, especially when one considers the fact that one's desire to eat anything to cleanse the palate of hot ass vanishes quickly.

      Single Professional Female, early 20s, willing to trade night of unbelievable, toe-curling, [hopefully not] sweat-inducing passion for perfectly serviceable air conditioning unit. Offer of night of passion can only be redeemed after AC is installed, of course. Owner not responsible for friction burns. No guarantee of sweating is implied.

      It's on days like this one that I fear Spontaneous Human Combustion the most. Like someone's gonna break into my apartment and find nothing but a pile of dark ashes, sooty fingernails, and a can of Diet Pepsi™ on the chair in front of my compter. And perhaps a cat turd, because my cat has a tendancy to dig, squat, and bury in anything remotely resembling a pile of sand.

      Raise your hand if you know just how depressing it is to wake up alone. Again. For the fifth month in a row.  If you are on a fulfilling diet of regular sex, fuck you. No, wait. You suck. No, wait... I hate you. Yeah, that's it. That makes a lot more sense.

      I am so fucking sick of dating (or, rather, "casually having sex and maybe drinks and rarely dinner with", because apparently, "dating" connotes too much fucking commitment) pathetic, posturing, pustulent man-boys with severe cases of Recto-Cranial Inversion™. Sad thing is, the good ones aren't all taken. No, they were killed off in the tragic Worthy Heterosexual Man Massacre that happened just before I came of age.  If you've got a better explanation of what happened to all the decent straight men in this country, I'd like to know it.

      For once, I'd like to just be happy. Not tentatively happy, knowing in the back of my mind that a bad time will soon effectively eclipse the good. Not cautiously optimistic. Not "not bad". Not "okay". Happy. Like, fuckin' delirious man. Untouchable. Invincible. Unstoppable. Amazing.   Without drugs, of course. Just so you know.  And I don't want any of my life comforts to change, either. Like, I don't want one (or more) of those shitty things to happen that eventually become something cool, and in retrospect you guess you're happy about it, but while it happens you almost feel like killing yourself. Not that. I just want to feel good. To smile because I want to, not because some tactless assclown tells me I "look so much prettier when I smile".  I want, for once, to not fear what the future holds. And to not dwell on the hatreds of my past.  And I don't want some jackass spouting post-modern philosphies at me like I give a shit.

      It's one of the biggest family days of the year, and I'm all alone. I'm many miles away from my closest family, and all my friends are off doing happy things with theirs. As accustomed as I am to being by myself, it really sucks to be alone on a day like this.   I want to watch the fireworks, but I don't want to go to a family-oriented affair and be the only person who's there alone. Like I don't stand out enough already. National holidays are really depressing for people like me. I felt this way on Memorial Day, and I'm sure I will feel this way on Labor Day.  *sigh*

      I've become a gym rat. I'm hooked on the strain and sore muscles; the sweating and the grunting; the stretching and the farting. At least, that's what I try to convince myself of since I made a pact to go there 7 days a week. Lucky me.  I firmly believe that my yoga instructor was an assitant to Dr. Mengele in the Third Reich. She's a natural-born torturer. She doesn't seem to understand that certain body types can't be bent into pretzel shapes, no matter how hard the owner of said body type tries.  I've been scared lately. Of my life crumbling before my eyes because of the non-implementation of a simple procedure, the success of which I've been waiting for over a year. I feel so helpless when my quality of life rests in someone else's hands. The worst part is that try as I might to kick-start the process, all I ever get is empty promises and hollow apologies. I wish he'd just cut the crap and do it already. I'm sick of waiting, and with each passing day, my motivation slowly slips away.  I wish I was thin and beautiful, instead of fat and humorous. Fat, funny girls don't get laid nearly as often enough. We also don't get fucked with as much as skinny girls, but you understand what my focus is here.

      wench just posted this on PS: "...few people ever have the golden opportunity that we have provided you here: the chance to see yourself as others see you. Too often, people are unwilling to offer constructive criticism to one who asks for an objective opinion. It's unpleasant to tell another the bad things we see in their personalities. "  She's so right. I should add that it's also unpleasant to hear other people think that you just plain fucking suck.

      I can't understand why it is that even as my professional life is finally settling down, my personal life remains on the skids.   I am more financially independent than my peers, and I've got a good head on my shoulders. I've been told many times that I've got a beautiful face, and though I'm overweight, I'm very athletic, and I have artistic leanings and a bit of an exotic flair. I'm kind and patient, and I've got a good sense of humor.  So why am I still painfully single?  And why did I dump the first guy that showed genuine interest in me for a long time  because I didn't think he cared anymore, and would have rather been single than sleeping with a guy who only called me when he needed a favor or wanted to sleep over?  Did I blow my last chance of love? Does wanting to be loved mean you have to settle for something that's not good enough just because it's something, and something is better than nothing?  I hate being the only single in a group of Smug Couples. And I hate hearing about other people's relationship problems. Shutthefuckup, okay? At least you have someone to complain about.

      Can a cat survive on a diet supplemented by catnip-mousie fur? Just wondering. I'm guessing she uses it for fiber, because all 12 of the mice are now hairless plastic versions of their former selves, and I can't find a scrap of fake fur anywhere. Oh well. As long as it keeps her regular.  And in completely unrelated news, I wish I could cryogenically preserve my uterus in a containment facility outside of my body until I decide to use it. This once-a-month pain/runs/swelling/cramps shit ain't funny.

      I'm lonely. My lonliness is palpable.   My friend is hurting, and I feel that I can't help her feel better. My cat is ill, and I feel that I can't help her feel better. I usually see myself as a strong person, but faced with two situations in which I can do nothing but be idle and patient while the issues resolve themselves, I feel helpless and dejected. And I'm not sure what to do about that.   An agreement that I made is not working out for either party, and I am frustrated and angry about how it will end, and the impact it will have on my recently-adopted lifestyle change. And I'm not sure what to do about that, either.  I'm lost. Which way is up? And do I walk or swim in that direction?

      OtherAIMid (12:16:17 PM): i LOVE you!*  (*based on my comment on a message board that reads as such:  ----"Oh, cry me a fucking river..."  Hey, Concerned Parents of America: if you don't want your kids watching this stuff, don't let them. There's no abuse laws that cover turning off the TV, changing the channel, or sending the kids to bed early.  I'll say the same thing that George Carlin said to the woman with the Baby on Board sign in her car: "I'm supposed to curb my habits because some lady forgot to put her diaphragm in?"  People, society should not and will not bend around your decision to procreate." ----)  Conjecture (12:17:01 PM): Thanks! It had to be said. OtherAIMid (12:17:09 PM): word OtherAIMid(12:17:27 PM): that is SO how i feel about hildren but i always feel like an ogre expresing it Conjecture (12:17:59 PM): Breeders who think that the rest of the world should take on the responsibility of raising their kids make me angry. OtherAIMid (12:18:08 PM): tell me about it OtherAIMid (12:19:30 PM): i cant even go into my local cafe and have coffee and a bagel and read my paper on the weekend without having to watch to make sure someone's kid doen't run into my table and spill hot coffee or put their finger in my food, or (GOD FORBID) try to TALK to me! Conjecture (12:19:54 PM): My parents raised me. Not the city, state, or country. And they didn't expect accolades for doing what they should have done for me. It's what you expect as a parent. None of this "won't somebody think of the children" bullshit. That's your job. OtherAIMid (12:20:20 PM): exactly Conjecture (12:20:27 PM): It doesn't take a village to raise a child. Fuck you, Hillary Clinton. OtherAIMid (12:20:35 PM): haha OtherAIMid (12:21:11 PM): i am so glad i am not the only one. and i always get the well, its because you;re gay" response Conjecture (12:21:34 PM): I get so pissed off at the parents who are like this. OtherAIMid (12:21:50 PM): oh i agree. Conjecture (12:22:21 PM): I don't see whay I should give a fuck about taking care of someone else's kids for them because they're sick of doing their job that theysigned on to do. Conjecture (12:23:44 PM): Parenting is a lifelong commitment. If you get tired of being someone's mommy or daddy, then too fucking bad. You should have thought of that beforehand. And don't expect me to be there as an anonymous guardian when your brat gets on your last damn nerve. Conjecture (12:24:30 PM): Sorry. Parents who think society owes them and their kids a fucking obligation steam me up, man. Tirade over. OtherAIMid (12:25:52 PM): it doesnt help that most people these days (rich AND poor) have kids for the wrong (selfish) reasons Conjecture (12:26:28 PM): I know. There should be a licensing or at least IQ + common sense and a willingness to work hard for your family to procreate. OtherAIMid (12:27:06 PM): hehe, its nice to chat with somone who feels as strongly as i do about this. Conjecture (12:27:46 PM): no prob. Conjecture (12:27:51 PM): Kids suck. ;-) OtherAIMid (12:28:05 PM): Word! OtherAIMid (12:28:09 PM): ;-) Conjecture (12:28:14 PM): Abortions for everyone! OtherAIMid (12:28:18 PM): lol Conjecture (12:28:38 PM): I'm going straight to hell for that one, aren't I? OtherAIMid (12:29:02 PM): oh, dont worry, i am going to have to getto hell a few hours early to fill out all the paperwork!  ...So I guess I'm not alone. When did  corporations and childless people like myself get roped into providing the limits for America's kids?

      I lack motivation, because dealing with my work supervisor has left me drained of all interest in doing a good job.  I am sick of the heat. Is it fall yet? I want to wear clothes with sleeves on them.  I can't breathe out of both nostrils at the same time, and I'm too poor to see the doctor.  Also? I'm tired of complaining about the suckiness of my life at times. Gimme some good, no, make that fucking great news to report.

She's also responsible for my only working 20 hours a week now instead of 40, leaving me to find another part-time gig in the worst job market in years.   So wherever you are, KM, congratulations. I hope karma bites you in your ass when you least expect it.  Fuck you.

      Maggots are the most disgusting creatures ever to exist.  Cleaning up a maggot infestation is the most disgusting task a person can ever do.  Why can't the cat puke into the toilet or sink, instead of under the bed where I won't spot it until it starts to smell like a decaying corpse a week later? Blah. And why wasn't she born with opposable thumbs so that she could clean up after herself?  Have you ever tried giving a pill to a reluctant cat with projectile-shedding fur, sharp claws, and fangs to rival Dracula's? Not fun.

      A letter I have not yet sent to my Mom, because I don't want to burden her with my own worries:  I'm losing hope, Mom.   The odds are stacking higher and higher against me, and all I have in me is fear. Fear that I'll fail; fear that my best efforts will blow up in my face; fear that all of what I've fought for and tolerated and sacrificed so much for will be in vain.   My strength is failing me. I can't turn back now, but it seems as if I can't step forward, either. I don't know if I'm going about it all wrong, but no one can give me any answers.  My finances are in disarray because of my work situation. Even though I have friends who are rallying on my side, they do not and cannot understand what it is I have to go through, and what I have been through. No one knows what I have sacrificed and put up with, and in this endeavour, I feel very much alone.  I was hoping that a step (that I haven't made yet) would make the situation easier, and allow me to sidestep what I have been doing thus far, but the risks are far greater, and I have to build, between myself and this other person, a mountain of lies in order to make this work. But the risks are far greater now. And I don't know yet if he's willing or able to take it on with me.   I don't know what to do. I'm losing faith in my own ability to make the outcome beneficial to me, and that has been the only thing driving me. My motivation is flagging, and my patience is wearing thin...  Mum, I don't know what to do.  Do I take the risk, with the odds being what they are? If I do, then a chance remains. But at what cost? I guess I'm just weakening; it's an uphill battle, but if I return, there is nothing left for me. I will have to start all over again, and I will never forgive myself for having failed myself.  I really don't have an option at this stage but to keep on keeping on, but both paths forward are littered with their own pitfalls, each more perilous than the rest. And here I stand, at the crossroads of my future, needing to believe in myself but seemingly unable to do so.  The burden is getting heavier each day, and I see no respite. I need the strength of two people right now, and I just don't have it in me. I wish things were perfect. I wish so many times that my adult life would have been easier, and that the choices I have made would have netted me greater joy, but right now, I despair.  I'm not giving up, by any means, but that doesn't make this burden any less difficult to carry. It's such a hard road I've traveled, and it doesn't look as if it will get much easier anytime soon. I'm trying to keep my wits about me, and I am as careful as I can be, but I live in fear of it all coming crashing down around me.   I refuse to accept that it will, however; I will try my best. I will plummet into the deep unknown and pray fervently for a successful outcome. But I need your encouragement, and when my own strength fails me, I will need yours.

      My boss just yelled at me over the phone, screaming obscenities and threatening to fire me.  It was all I could do to keep my shit together.  Then, he came back on the phone, explained to me the stress he was under, and all but apologized for ripping my head off.  I've allowed myself to be taken advantage of by my employers, in anticipation of a better reward coming soon,  and I'd just about reached my wit's end with the screw-overs and empty promises that are immediately forgotten by those who matter most. I don't know if I can hold to this wavering hope much longer. My humanity's at stake, and so is my adult life...  More on that later.  The second I got off the phone, I burst into tears. Now, all I want to do is curl up into a ball and cry for the rest of the day. If crap took a crap, that would be how I feel.  Happy fucking Holidays to me. Give me one good reason not to end the pain right now.

      I can't figure this guy out.  He's good to me, but has a predilection for shoplifting.  He respects and adores me, but tries to fuck (or has fucked) everything in a skirt.  He's looking for a girlfriend, but can't seem to make any progress with any of these women before there is a major falling out.  He's funny, but sometimes he irks the shit out of me.  He's attractive, but I'm no longer attracted to him, now that I've gotten to know him better.  I have major trust issues, so I am hesitant to write off yet another potential friend, but I'm trying very hard to figure out whether or not I'm making excuses for the guy to get over my own issues. I've been one to foolishly compromise my standards for a few men, and I never want to do that again. I fear I may be overcompensating now in my attempt to not be taken advantage of. Or I might be overcompensating now because I've been so quick to dismiss people based on several things in a similar vein in the past. I don't know which it is, or if it is both. Fuckin'-A, man.  Something nags to me that he's bad news, if one were to look objectively at half the things he's done, and half the things he says, but an equally strong nag tells me I should stop expecting someone, anyone, to be perfect (that is, fitting into my own pre-defined idea of what constitutes a "good person" and thus a "good friend"), and I should just lighten the fuck up and give him a chance. And then another. And then another. You get the idea.  I'm torn. I want to open a gate in the walls I've built, but I also want to keep my guard up. I can't do both. And I hate the fact that I can't make up my fucking mind about him.

      Don't ever agree to be friends (especially good friends) with anyone who you're sexually attracted to, if you have realized that the relationship will never go further than that. Because when that person feels comfortable enough around you to flirt with someone else right in front of you...you WILL feel like shit.

      Last night, I developed a sickening crush on Robbie Williams, after seeing him on "MTV Cribs". The boy is SMOKIN' HOT!!! Hoo-boy! I lurves me some adorable Brit bad-boy with a snarl and a shit-eating grin, yes I do. I even had a dream about him last night. Creepy, no?   Don't tell the mister.

      "It drives me apeshit when I don't feel other people are valuing my time. I won't tolerate people being late to meetings, I won't sit in a meeting that isn't productive (yes, I will just get up and leave) and I don't mess with the time of others. At the same time, I will and can be very patient if I feel that something is worth waiting for - I guess I just have a clearly developed sense of that worth."  Well said, mulberry (3WA).

      We eloped today.  The ring feels weird on my finger.  I have gone from an "I" to a "We" in one fell swoop.  I'm scared shitless; I don't know the first thing about being married.  I'm thinking getting married while you're unemployed is not necessarily the brightest idea.  But, it was what we wanted to do.  Wish us luck!

      When I read the many and varied online journals of people living in NYC during The Great Blackout of 2003 who bitched and moaned about the harrowing ordeal of that simple inconvenience, my first reaction was to silently mouth, "shut the fuck up, you whiny crybaby."  Things have changed since then. Now, I yell instead. "Shut the fuck up! You whiny crybaby!"  Try living through a hurricane in the third world. Try going without a shower for 2 weeks. Try catching rainwater and boiling it before consumption because the groundwater is polluted by the remains of animals and people who drowned in the rivers and dams. Try going for a month without electricty, doing homework by candlelight, cooking on an outdoor coal stove that you have to squat on the ground to use because there's no gas, and having to cough up a bribe to get the electric company servicemen to turn your power back on after every other street in the neighborhood had light except for yours. Try being unable to get a message of your safety to relatives in other parts of the world concerned for your well-being for 3 weeks because the phone lines had fallen to the ground.  Try any of those things, and let me see you bitch about one fucking day without electricity ever the fuck again.

      Re-reading my most recent posts, I realize that my emotions have been all over the place lately. But nobody notices it, because nobody reads this (my blog, a.k.a. my emotional purging grounds) but me. I wonder if that roller-coaster movement of my feelings (trying to steer clear of cliches here) is a bad sign.  I hope not.  Of course, just by including the the word "hope", I have doomed myself.  Bah. Can I get a do-over of the last 7 years? If I could have, I would have done a lot of things differently. "If I knew then what I know now", and all that...  Hindsight, 20/20, etc. Cliche, cliche, cliche.  I'm done.

      I thought of people who have left my bathroom stinky. Tiny apartment + stinky bathroom = unhappy ConJecture. Then I remembered that this never came up when my aunt and Mom were visiting. Unstinky relatives made me crack a smile.  *Sighs*  I miss my family.  *cries a little*  A guy from LA Fitness just called, asking for my best friend. He had signed up temporarily, to use the gym while he was here for a week visiting me. I laughed a little.  I miss my friends.  *cries a little more*  Sometimes, on top of feeling like a fraud, I feel like I all but cling to my meager existence, and I do it all by myself. I feel like my choices have betrayed me, and I have let myself down before I even started. And then my cheeks flush, my eyes water, my spine tingles, and my heart hurts ever so slightly more than it does every day now.  I never knew what crying on the inside felt like until now.

How in the eff am I supposed to know what you just went through to get me that quote? You can explain, and I can most certainly sympathize, but I'm not gonna know that beforehand, you imbecilic twat. Stop feeling so fucking victimized. Honey, I'm a total stranger. I don't know you, and I don't give a squirrel's left nut that you're having a bad day. Especially not since you've been so incredibly huffy and rude to me. I pay you for a service, and if you don't want to provide it, find another line of work, okay?  Needless to say, she totally fouled up my mood. At the end of the freakin' day, too. Sniveling bitch.  Grrrr....

      "My mom's an elementary school secretary, and she's also mentioned an Orangejello. With a sibling named Lemonjello. (And there might be a third I can't remember.) posted by Utilitaritron at 9:41 PM PST on November 13"  We've all heard this one. Yes, I'm sure that a close relative of yours has taught, treated, or babysat these two young boys. Yes, I'm sure you know it to be fact that two twin boys exist, whose mom had the nerve to bestow upon her sons such godawful names. Yes, I'm sure you relate this factual tale at parties, knee-deep in your fifth Miller High Life, and everyone encourages you by actually laughing at this stupid fucking anecdote.  Guess what? IT'S BULLSHIT!   You heard me. I've stumbled across this lame joke too many unforgivable times, and I assure you, it's fake. Every last person swore up and down that a relative of theirs knew these kids. That's impossible.  Please, do me a favor, and let this joke die. It ceased to be funny five years ago. Enough already.  It's bullshit, and all people do when they hear it is roll their eyes, out of nothing but sheer disbelief that you could be that. fucking. stupid.  Let it go.

I swear, once the hot weather comes back and she doesn't need it for the whole 'keeping her bony ass warm' thing, I'm gonna shave her. A nice, feline-military buzzcut. Especially around the aforementioned bony ass, where it seems to grow like tufts in an old man's ears.  Heh. When I do that, I'll figure out a way to post pictures here.

       Transformer Refuses To Change Back Into Volkswagen  CYBOTRON—Following an intense battle with Megatron and his evil Decepticons Monday, former robot-in-disguise Bumblebee refused to revert to his natural state as a yellow Volkswagen Beetle. "I hid my existence in this world by taking the form of a vehicle! I revealed my true nature when I was called upon to protect earth!" said Bumblebee, a member of Optimus Prime's heroic Autobots force. "I refuse to change back into a humiliating bubble-shaped compact car!" Bumblebee added that Megatron arrived on earth with one goal: Destruction!  from:  urlLink http://www.theonion.com/index.php?show_p=2    Can you see what's wrong with the above?

      So, the people  urlLink here  decry the iTunes Music Store because they claim the artists get such a small cut of the money the track costs the consumer.  Why is Apple under attack?

Until I can watch "Cribs" and not see some talentless jagoff bragging about his solid-gold ceiling or his $350,000 worth of bling-bling, or flossin' his ridiculously over-customized SUV, I'm not readily going to accept that major-label artists are poor.

      "Only lesbians drive Subarus". Not quite. I drive an Impreza, and I've never dined at the Y.   I do notice an inordinate number of lesbians friends I've had who drive Subaru Legacy/Outback wagons, Toyota Rav 4s, and VW Passats. I wonder what that's all about. I guess people will attribute any trends to a commone thread, no matter how slight.

      I've picked up a new obsession:  urlLink food blogs .  It's fascinating, really. I live vicariously through those that have the financial wherewithal to be choosy about what they will and will not eat, especially on a day-to-day basis. I'm poor, so fancy eating's not something I can do more than once a year. And by fancy, I mean, 'a step above chain resturant, with tablecloths and reasonable service'. Not 'snooty waiter with a hand towel and a convenient french accent' fancy.  The only time I've ever paid at a $30+ per entree place was by mistake. All other times (not that many, admittedly), I've filled up good eats and good wine on somebody else's tab.   One caveat: any food blog I visit has to have pictures of said food, or I'm outta there mighty quick. That way, I can drool at the pics and just imagine what they'd taste like, if indeed I could afford to live that richly.

      So, I'm selling this 2-year-old 19" TV I have for $60. $60! That's really cheap for a color TV in perfect condition.  This guy e-mails me about it: "Hello! I"m interested in your 19-inch TV for sale.  What brand is this and how old is it?"  I respond: "It’s a black Sansui 19”, and it’s less than 2 years old. It was manufactured in 2002. I’m selling it really cheap, even though it’s in excellent condition."  He writes back: "Hmmm.  It's not exactly the brand I was looking for.  Would you sell it for $40?"  Unreal.  Are you fucking kidding me, ya cheap bastard?!? $60 for a 2 year old TV is inexpensive as fuck already! Do you negotiate with the people you pay for sex, too? What a  douchebag .   He strikes me as the sort of person who would go into a dollar store and proclaim that he won't pay more than 50c apiece for the items in his shopping basket because they weren't brand name. Dick.

      If you were in an office building with 200 other people, 70% of whom are men, 96% of whom don't wash their hands after they use the bathroom, wouldn't it sicken you to imagine all the disgusting genital detritus that accumulates on all the frequently-touched surfaces, such as door handles, coffeepot, copy machine, etc.?  I'm not a germophobe, but shit, is it too much to ask that a group of adult males rinse the cock off their fingers after they finish touching themselves in the bathroom?  I'm gonna start wearing a pair of surgical fucking gloves from now on.

      This culture of excess that exists in America in the throes of an economic crisis sickens me. Whatever happened to "living within your means"? Just because some 2-bit celebrity hack who won't be famous 5 years from now can afford to drop $180,000 on a tricked-out Escalade with chrome and custom everything doesn't mean you have to keep up with the Joneses.  I have so many friends who don't give a shit about financial security, as they're far too focused on what they've got now. $30,000 in credit card debt doesn't matter to a 26-y-old who's eager to acquire a phat new set of 24s for his spankin' new Avalanche. People now care more about how they're perceived by others more than ever. The late 90s seem to have ushered in a new era high-maintenance imagery to compete with the status quo.  Don't get me wrong, if you've got it, spend it, but do you really need a car with your initials stiched into the headrests and 5 seperate DVD players? Do you really need the $250 Replay jeans when Levi's are fine? Do you really need to eat at Nobu if you can only afford Benihana?  I get distressed when people who make less money than me floss like crazy. I feel shitty because I'm up to my ears in educational debt as well as debt incurred when I was fresh out of college and had to take out cash advances on my credit cards to pay rent, buy groceries, and fix my car so I could go on job interviews, and I'll be paying through the nose for a long damn time. I have nothing to show for my success except a stack of bills. No bling, no floss. No tricked-out anything. And I'm fine with that. Financial responsibilities are a fact of my life that I cannot ignore, no matter hwo much I wish they weren't there.   Some people don't seem to have that perspective. How can one rationalize racking up $30,000 in credit card debt when one makes $27,000 a year? And I end up paying for their excess in unemployment taxes and higher debt premiums. It is so motherfucking unfair.  I've had to opt out of a 401k plan because my budget is tight enough already. I can't imagine living any way but frugal on the 60% of my income that I'm allowed to keep before they tax everything I spend it on. I'm bitter. I admit it. I don't want some phat wheels and an expensive wardrobe, though. I want to not have to pay numerous late fees and 26% APR. I want to not have to declare bankruptcy to avoid my creditors. I want a life where what I work hard for is what I get. If I want to splurge, I am justified in earning it, not feeling as if I'm somehow entitled even if I never lifted a finger.  But this world is never fair. And I will continue to struggle mightily to make ends meet while my broke-ass neighbors cruise the streets in their phat rides which beg to be stolen.

      My life sucks.  I've had silent moments to reflect upon the changes I've been through; the rough hands I've been dealt; the bullshit I've had to swallow, and the sacrifices I've had to make. After I mentally conclude that I've come too far to give up, I'm overtaken by doubt. What am I fighting for? Can I win? Can my dreams actually come true?  I know that I have a lot to be thankful for, and I am. It's just that... well, I'm human. As strong as I am, I have my moments of despair, when hope is snatched out of my reach, and I've but a thread to cling to. It's tough being so far removed from my support system. Recently, I've had a much harder time believing in myself and my ability to live through this and come out on top.  My life is a mess. It is slowly unraveling. Where will I go? What will my options be if I fail? I'm lost, and I'm scared.   I'm thisclose to losing all hope. If that happens, what is to become of me? I do not know.

      Friday night was a first.  Saturday night? Was a little exciting, but a little odd.  Right now, I'm trying to figure out if I'd like to parlay Saturday night into tonight. I'm not even sure how. Logistically, it makes very little sense. But that may be me overthinking as usual. I want to, I really do, but I'm not sure. But will I ever be sure? I don't know. Will it be an opportunity I'll regret passing on? Again, I don't know. But I really, really want to. I just cringe at the thought of the possible rejection.

      When I moved into my current place, I had to pay a pet fee of several hundred dollars. Domino's a spayed adult female cat with no front claws, and she weighs less than 9lbs.  How on earth is her potential for damage greater than that of a kicking, screaming, food-flinging, pissing, shitting, badly-behaved toddler?  I think certain people with young children in their apartments should, if not relegated to their own buildings with other ill-suited parents, be forced to pay a child penalty, which supplements everyone else's rent, simply because the neighbors are the ones who have to put up with all the fucking noise. Tantrums, cartoons, videogames, running... jeebus, this is the sort of shit we have to put up with for keeping our legs closed?

      Judging from what my friends doing the online dating thing say, I think it's rather odd that guys who resort to the internet to find new girlfriends can be so damn choosy. More often than not, my friends get dropped because their pictures weren't appealing to the guy. People, my girlfriends are not  at all  ugly. I guess the open-buffet style of dating makes people not feel bad about sampling the tiniest bit before throwing the whole thing away.

      My friend chewed me out for calling her at 9:56 one night. Like, not even 10 yet, right? Apparently, in  their  household,  they  go to bed early. Well, sweetheart, before you and him moved in together -- you know, in the heady glory days before you systematically alienated all your friends by being so unavailable, so distracted, and and so wrapped up in your relationship... the days before you started the near-constant complaining about how few close friends you have now compared to before... remember those? Yeah, me neither-- you never went to bed before midnight, so screw you too.

      There are all these blogs about men not being able to get any sex from their SOs, and they complain bitterly about it. Completely understandable. What I don't get is why women withhold sex.   I, personally, love to fuck. If I were a guy, I'd be hard all day.   If I were to write down the thoughts that go through my head on a daily basis, I'd have priests sprinkling holy water on me and demanding that the lustful demons that inhabit my body be cast out.  And even as a 20-something female who loves to fuck, I have difficulty both finding and getting partners. How is it that the libidinously gifted don't often meet each other? If I had a boyfriend, we'd be having all sorts of crazy monkey sex, the sort of sex where you wake up the next morning and realize there was indeed a wet spot, and, oh, by the way, your panties are hanging from the ceiling fan, all the time. I'd be so enthusiastic that he'd beg me to let him rest for a few days. And on the rare day that I'm not up for a full-on romp between the sheets (on the ground, up against the fridge, in the shower, sitting at my desk, whatever), nothing gets me (or him) off quite like a Damn Good Blowjob. I love (love!) giving those. My technique makes men weak in the knees, and I'm damn proud of it.  Back to my original point: why do womena withhold sex, and why do men allow them to? If I were married, and my husband refused to give it up, you'd best be damn sure than I'd have a wandering eye. I wouldn't be able to stay with him very long after he started withholding, either. I'd divorce his ass and go get me some of the good stuff from whomever I damn well please so quickly, it'd make his head spin. Who wants to be with someone who is so unwilling to compromise on so vital an aspect of a functional relationship? I couldn't do it. And if I felt stuck in the marriage for whatever reason, valid or otheriwse, I'd cheat. Plain and simple. I wouldn't cheat to get revenge, I'd cheat because I like to fuck and I can't at home.  Jeebus. All these posts about sex... I seriously need to get laid more often.

      Funniest damn thing I've read all week:  "Girls who say they get implants for self-esteem are bullshitters. If I could get a dong implant I sure as hell wouldn't be doing it to feel better about myself. I'd do it so I could wear the gayest, tightest fitting shorts Old Navy has to offer, and then go swimming in the mall's water fountain in front of the old people. Otherwise, if I'm not gonna impress elderly women with my junk, why would I want any extra meat stickin' to my leg when I jog down to blockbuster to rent pornographic anime?"  -  shibbymcgrizzles , on Fark.

      She has a long-term boyfriend. The cute, muscular one who spends every weekend with her and her little brat, takes them out, babysits that snot-nosed terror of hers, cleans up, cooks, and even takes out the trash. The guy who made a good gesture of tolerating her ex when he blew in like an ill wind to perform his bi-weekly child custody dance.     A pretty nice guy, it seems. She's cheating on him. And how! In the last 2 weeks, I've seen her with 3 different guys, all of whom went on to spend the night. There may have been more, but I only saw 3. The latest sighting was a couch-displayed, lights-on, mid-cunnilingus startle caused by me walking past her wide-open front door. Charming.         I feel so bad for the guy, putting up with her shit (she screams obscenities at him all the time, and bitches about the things he doesn't do to please her) and nasty chain-smoking habit, and treating her like she's the most important person in the world, while she makes no attempt to hide her infidelity. It's like she  wants  him to catch her skanky ass.

      Is it too much to ask that the people in charge actually know what the fuck they're talking about? I mean, really.   How can one make proper command decisions unless one knows what it's like in the trenches? How can a director figure that a whole e-commerce site built in 2 days by one person is a realistic expectation? How can you be the director of marketing and creative services if you've never done a lick of creative work in your life, and can barely even turn on your fucking computer?  Suffice to say, I don't get it.  Why are you in charge again?

      So it (sort of) went as planned. There were several hitches, but he was good-natured about it. We laughed a lot. We talked relatively easily for a first-time meeting. The awkwardness was minimal, and pretty much gone by hour 2. And he was such a gentleman that he e-mailed me this morning to tell me he had a lovely time. And we've made tentative plans for next weekend.   Wonderful, right?  Except I don't think I'm very attracted to him.   He's a bona fide geek. Make no mistake about it. And that initial spark just wasn't there. You know how they say a girl knows in the 1st 5 minutes whether or not she'll ever sleep with you? So true. And I didn't once feel that.   If what I want is care and adoration, can I put the sex aside and be happy with just companionship, or will that constitute leading him on?  And I don't know what words to use to reply to his e-mail. I want to stop overthinking everything, but I don't know if I put aside my analytical neuroses, that any eventual outcome will convince me that I held them for a reason.  Fuck, why is life so fucking complicated?

         Well, so much for my date this weekend. The fucker didn't even have the nerve to cancel. He just fucking disappeared.  Gotta love that sort of compassionate approach to letting people down, yeah?

      A willingness on the part of a good girl to fuck you on the first date does not translate to her being a dirty whore. Get the fuck over yourself, yo.  Besides, she didn't fuck herself. You were involved too, asshole. If she's a whore, what does that make you?

      This guy I know has fucked 147 people. He's my age. Who has the time it takes to fuck 147 people? He must get up really early in the morning. And if your number's really that high, how in the hell do you keep track?

         BN: I took a tumble on Friday night, resulting in a bruised left patella, various lacerations and bruising on my arms and legs, and the loss of a patch of skin the size of a quarter on my right foot. Plus, my right foot swelled up to twice its size.  WN: After that injury, I woke up Saturday morning with strep throat.  GN: I was able to get an appt. w/ my doc this AM, and thanks to insurance, got x-rays of my left knee and right ankle, 2 sets of medication, and an office visit for an awful lot less than I would have had to not-pay-because-I-can't-afford-it if I wasn't insured.  BN: I needed a tetanus shot, and now, my arm hurts like a mofo. Plus, the cut on my foot had become infected.  GN: Because of the contagious nature of strep, I have to stay in for a few days, doctor's orders. So, YAY, paid semi-vacation from work!

          From  urlLink this site :      GEMINI WOMEN: Often the aggressor, you are never embarrassed by your behavior because you never adhere to any standards except your own main requirement: a lover who knows how to take his time. You are a one woman harem, but a partner should be aware that in a relationship, the Gemini woman is looking for a combination of the spiritual and the physical, the romantic and the practical. You want to talk to the guy after you tumble with him! Best sex mates are Leo, Scorpio, Aquarians, Libra, and Aries. Favorite gadget: the vibrator.     Correct:I am often the agressor.     (um, hello? underfucked.)  Incorrect: I am never embarassed by my behavior.     (ha! fat chance.)  Correct: I want a lover who knows how to take his time.     (well, yes, but more specifically a young stud with a rock-hard dong who can fuck for 3 hours straight in 6 different positions in 4 different locations without pausing for more than a water break like a marathon runner, who has a tongue like a hummingbird's wings, who has a 5-minute refractory period, etc.)  Incorrect: I am a one-woman harem.     (my name is not Sybil, and I hate 69. I mean, c'mon: it's far too distracting for something so giggle-inducing. balls slapping your chin? that shit is funny.)    Correct: I am looking for a combination of the spiritual and the physical.  (...as long as the physical comprises roughly 97% of that whole.)  Incorrect: I want to talk to the guy after I tumble with him.     (not a chance. he's lucky if I don't toss his scrawny ass out the window just so I can have the bed all to myself.)   As for the vibrator... well, screw diamonds.  urlLink The Rabbit Pearl  is a girl's best friend.

      To all the shiny new people coming to my blog from  urlLink Pisser 's:  I apologize for the monumental suckitude of my most recent posts. I apologize for disappointing you in your quest for searing wit on par with hers. I apologize for disappointing you in your need for hilarity on par with hers. I also apologize for harping on the fact that I'm not getting any.   To make up for the lack of compelling content, compensatory handjobs will be doled out at a later date.   Thank you all for understanding.  Note to self: stock up on lotion.

      ...that pang for sex more than hunger?     I've been dying to get some recently. Do you know how much of a curse it is ito have a super-high sex drive and be terminally single while everyone around you is happily paired off? It sucks.  I mean, really. Who do you have to fuck to get some sex around here?

      Last week at the  urlLink aquarium , my companion was looking at the beautiful fish swimming freely and interacting with each other, the light dancing on their marvelous scales, the beauty and grace of their movements captivating all onlookers, and I? Was thinking, "Mmm.... sushi". Now, don't get me wrong, I love the aquarium more than anything; marine biology is a  urlLink passion  of mine, and it was my idea to go. But if I see  urlLink yellowtail , salmon, and eel swimming in a tank, I want them  urlLink on my plate .  If it makes you feel any better, I didn't feel any hunger watching the jellyfish. Just pure, childlike amusement and glee.

      It's shameful how many high school graduates can't spell, or even compose a proper sentence to save their lives. A sampling of e-mails I've received in the last 24 hours:  "...a hanest and jenerous person..."  and this gem:  "...nope im not a hobiest im a profesanel diver..."  Appalling. Simply appalling. These are my peers, people. These are the fuckers who get raises and promotions before I do because they were born with external genitalia. What the fuck is  wrong   right  with the educational system?
