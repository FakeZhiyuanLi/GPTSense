      Today's Stock Market Looks A Lot Like Dow Back In The Early '30s BY JONAH KERI  INVESTOR'S BUSINESS DAILY  Investors trying to make sense of the market's confusing signals need only crack open a history book for the answer. It's 1921-1934 all over again.  The thought may send shivers down the spines of many. That period included one of the worst one-day collapses in market history in October 1929. That was followed by insolvent banks, a government in over its head, a drought that devastated food supply and, ultimately, the Great Depression.  A look at the accompanying chart below shows the clear parallel between the Dow of '21 to '34 and the Nasdaq of 1992 to today. Where the market is concerned, history constantly repeats itself.  It's Human Nature  "We're dealing with human behavior here, and that never changes," said market historian Jeff Hirsch, president of The Hirsch Organization and editor of The Stock Trader's Almanac. "People pay bills every month, hold Christmas parties every year, presidents get elected every four years. There is a general rhythm to society that does affect market movements."  Whatever the era, human emotion has always ruled the market. When strong gains lead to excessive speculation, disciplined investing to greedy cash grabs, that is when stocks run into trouble.  The similarities between the two eras go beyond behavioral science, though. The 1920s ushered in an era of rapid economic growth and technological change. Led by Henry Ford cranking cars off the assembly line, consumer demand skyrocketed. RCA's ascent through the innovation of the radio portended an exciting future. A healthy job market and booming stock market combined to fuel an era known as the Roaring '20s   1 .   View larger image  The 1990s looked much the same. Instead of cars and radio, the proliferation of the PC and Internet dramatically increased companies' productivity. A boom in electronic gadgets stoked consumer demand. The job market again firmed, favorable economic policies reigned and the market notched massive gains   1 . The final, furious leg up from late 1998 to early 2000 exceeded even the 1920s' enormous gains.  Back To The '30s?  Though few people want to revisit the stock market crash of '29, the bursting of the Nasdaq's bubble in 2000   2  rivaled the Dow's collapse some 70 years earlier   2 . The Dow tanked 89.5% from September 1929 to July 1932. The Nasdaq plunged 78.4% from March 2000 to its bottom in October 2002. Even the length of the two down cycles was similar: 34 months for Dow '29-32, 31 for Nasdaq '00-02.  "In both cases what you had was excess capacity," said Fred Fern, head of Los Angeles-based money management firm Churchill Management. "In 1929, there were 166 automobile companies. That's what you had with many tech companies in the late '90s. Demand kept rising and rising and capacity kept going up, until finally demand slowed down and everything fell apart."  Fern uses a war room setup in his L.A. offices, showing every market cycle dating back to the '20s. On the room's walls, he's tracked 12 complete market cycles, bull and bear included, since 1942.   In 10 of those 12 instances, the recovery from a bear market has been a two-legged affair. The market takes off on an initial bull run, then corrects, usually for nine to 12 months. The second leg up occurs after the market has gone through that correction, defined as one or more of the major indexes falling 10% to 20%.  Now look at the chart of the two market cycles on this page. The Dow's bottom in 1932 resembles the Nasdaq's in 2002. Both times the market rallied briefly, then bided its time. A few months later — starting in March 1933 for the Dow   3 , March 2003 for the Nasdaq   3  — the market started a new bull run in earnest.   The Dow took 11 months to reach a peak in February 1934. It then dropped 24% over the next few months   4 . Though that was a little beyond a typical intermediate correction's length, the harsh circumstances of the time created a choppier environment.   The Nasdaq took 10 months to reach a peak in January 2004. It's since corrected 17% the last seven months   4 . Coming off another massive run-up and huge bear market, a correction could go a bit beyond 20% again.   Here's where the chart diverges. The Dow zoomed 131% from July 1934 to March 1937   5 . The move came despite the effects of the Dust Bowl, the rise of Hitler and the Great Depression.   Today, the economy has held up better. Technological advances have changed the way companies do business, unemployment has remained low compared with historical levels, and consumer spending has stayed in decent shape. Just as reforms in the banking industry proved a huge stabilizer in the '30s, the government hopes a cleanup of the mutual fund industry will help restore investor confidence. A round of tax cuts has also helped.  So will history repeat itself again?   The rebound may come quicker or slower than it did in the '30s. But just as foreign conflicts, recessions and recoveries, swings in energy supply and demand, and polarizing elections have sprung up again, so too will the market.  It did in the Roaring '20s, the World War II-related boom of '42-46, via the Nifty Fifty stocks of the late '60s and early '70s, and multiple other times. It will again.

      BusinessWeek Online Realize It or Not, We're All in Sales Monday August 16, 8:06 am ET    When people ask me what I do and I reply that I'm in sales, they sometimes sigh and say, "Gee, I'm so glad I'm not in your business." I used to wonder at that reaction, because I love being in sales. Maybe they didn't hear right, perhaps believing that I'd "just got out of jail." But then, when I take a closer look at their faces, it becomes all too clear that they were serious! Professional salespeople make more money than some lawyers or doctors. They also have more freedom with their time. What's not to like?  When those who wrinkle their noses at my profession explain what they do, be it teach, preach, leech, or whatever, I can't help but laugh. To be successful in any profession -- any profession at all! -- you must also be able to sell. It's like taking a double-major of business in college. Even if your one true love is biology, add some basic business classes and you multiply your job options. And sales ability is the most basic skill of all, shaping every aspect of our daily lives.  KID STUFF. No matter if you are a mechanic or a psychiatrist, applying a general understanding of sales to your job will make you more effective and successful. Believe me, not only will you be able to be able to negotiate better rates with your vendors, you'll have happier customers and employees.  Dr. Barbara Pletcher, who founded the National Association for Professional Saleswomen, used to say that your selling skills make it easier for the other person to do his or her job. Outside of work, sales skills are especially helpful in the dating scene. Talk about prospecting, presentation skills, branding and closing techniques! And once the knot is tied, the selling continues. Want a new sofa? Better be able to sell your partner on that idea, not mention things like planning vacations or, for some folks, arriving at a decision to have one more child!  And speaking of children, every parent is a salesperson. Without the adept nudging and adroit persuasion of Mom or Dad, what kid would learn multiplication tables or eat vegetables? It is parents who must sell our young ones on the benefits of math and vitamins. Mary and Bob, former neighbors of mine, had 10 kids. Trust me, handling that brood required the equivalent of a PhD in sales. No parent could survive the 18+ years of childhood and adolescence without some pretty solid negotiation skills. Whether it's who gets a favorite toy, how much money represents a fair allowance, or who borrows the car on a Saturday night, good negotiating skills are a form of selling. And in families, that talent gets a 24/7 workout.  ENGINEERING CONSENT. Bear in mind that selling doesn't have to involve a physical product or a formal service. Some of the most frequently "sold" items are ideas, opinions, and points-of-view. If you have a suggestion to reduce waste and cut your outfit's overheads, a political opinion with which you hope to enlighten others, or a civic crusade you aim to launch with a letter to the editor of the local paper, well, each of those is selling. Seen from this perspective, it can make you wonder what those people who say they're not in sales actually do all day.  There's an old saying, "If you aren't selling, you're buying." Believe me, it's true. If you aren't presenting your thoughts in a way that sells the other person on adopting your point of view, then you're probably buying their opinions. If sales prospects convince you that your price is too high or your product is not the right fit, they've successfully sold you their negative opinion.  This wisdom even applies to techies -- engineers, lab rats, and every other assorted variety of geek. Hey, I'm an expert: I married one. They already make great friends and spouses, but they also need to learn basic sales skills.  I received a letter from Naveed last week, who wrote: "Dear Michelle, I am not a sales or a marketing person. In fact, I am a hard-core engineer and have been so for over 10 years. However, I believe that selling is not just limited to presenting a product, but to everything in our lives. Succeeding in winning the heart of the perfect match, getting accepted to a good school, finding the right job, winning the approval of your board, getting elected to office or motivating your kids -- it doesn't matter which, you need to sell."  THE UNIVERSAL SALESMAN. Number-oriented professionals who also understand sales are a real asset to any business. I'm speaking to an association of hydrologists this fall, and these experts want to know more about how to sell their ideas, products, and services more easily and quickly. I've also spoken to pharmacists, silicon chip manufacturers, and geologists.  There are many professions that sell but don't call themselves salespeople. Sometimes they prefer to call it persuading, influencing or negotiating. This includes those in law enforcement, lobbyists, and lawyers. College recruiters, whether they're on the prowl for students or student athletes, are also in sales.  Regardless of your occupation or job title, to be successful in today's competitive world, you must learn to also think of yourself as being in sales. Those who learn the basic ideas of sales and use them in every aspect of their lives will find more success, personal impact, and happiness. Happy selling!

       The Washington Times reports US intelligence officials say a high-profile political assassination, triggered by the public release of a new message from Osama bin Laden, will lead off the next major al Qaeda terrorist attack. The assassination plan is among new details of al Qaeda plots disclosed by US officials familiar with intelligence reports who, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the killing could be carried out against a US or foreign leader either in the United States or abroad. The officials mentioned Saudi Arabia and Yemen as likely locales for the opening assassination. The planning for the attacks to follow involves "multiple targets in multiple venues" across the US, one official said. The new details of al Qaeda's plans were found on a laptop computer belonging to arrested al Qaeda operative Muhammad Naeem Noor Khan of Pakistan. "We're talking about planning at the screwdriver level," one official said. "It is very detailed." Khan was arrested July 13 in Lahore, Pakistan, along with Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, a Tanzanian who was indicted in the 1998 US Embassy bombings in Africa and was on the FBI's list of most-wanted terrorists. U.S. and allied counterterrorism officials are pursuing leads on other terrorists based on the data from Khan's seized laptop. At least one arrest in Britain has been made so far, and others are expected, the officials said. Additionally, US intelligence officials said they think that several al Qaeda terrorists already in the US are part of the plot, although their identities and locations are not known.

      USC Football No. 1 In Preseason Coaches Poll First preseason top ranking in major poll since 1979. July 30, 2004 Defending national champion USC will open the college football season at No. 1, easily ahead of Oklahoma in the preseason USA TODAY/ESPN coaches' poll. The Trojans received 44 of 61 first-place votes and were no lower than fifth on any ballot. LSU, co-champion last year with USC, is third. USC coach  urlLink Pete Carroll  hopes to be hoisting the national championship trophy again this season after the Orange Bowl. "I think it's a statement of respect for our program, and hopefully we can live up to it," USC coach  urlLink Pete Carroll  said. It's the first time since 1979--the last time USC was coming off a national championship season--that the Trojans have been ranked No. 1 by either AP or the Coaches in the preseason. The Trojans return 55 players who saw playing time last season, including 24 who have started at least once in their career, including quarterback  urlLink Matt Leinart , a Heisman Trophy candidate, and the top three running backs. The eligibility status of star wide receiver  urlLink Mike Williams  is unclear.  '); document.write(''); // End Hide -->  Florida State is the only team to start and finish the season No. 1 (1993, '99) since USA TODAY began administering the coaches' poll in 1991. The last two Bowl Championship Series titles were won by teams ranked 12th or worse in the preseason. The revised BCS formula, which determines which teams will play in the national title game, gives greater weight to the coaches' and Associated Press media polls. Those polls combined are worth two-thirds in the formula. Computer ratings make the other third. The coaches' poll was controversial last season because in the final regular-season ranking, 37 of the 63 coaches cast first-place votes for USC. However, the coaches are required by their governing body, the American Football Coaches Association, to name the winner of the BCS title game their No. 1 team. As a result, they had to hand those first-place ballots to LSU, which beat Oklahoma in the BCS title game. Three coaches broke ranks and cast first-place votes for USC. "We have done a much more thorough job of making sure those on our board of voters understand the commitment made," says Grant Teaff, the executive director of the AFCA.

        Nanosys Calls Off Initial Public Offering   By BARNABY J. FEDER   Nanosys, the leading symbol of nanotechnology's promise to generate lucrative innovations by manipulating atoms and molecules, yesterday called off a closely watched effort to go public long before it had any products to sell. Nanosys and a banking team led by Merrill Lynch had hoped to sell 6.25 million shares at $15 to $17 a share, which would have given the public a 29 percent stake in the four-year-old company. Nanosys, based in Palo Alto, Calif., said that "market conditions" had led to its decision. Conditions are tough, analysts said. Empi, a profitable medical device maker, also dropped its plans to go public yesterday. But analysts and competitors said that Nanosys's lack of products and its warning that it might not be profitable for several years, if ever, had made it a hard sell to investors. "Clearly, it's a bellwether for technology I.P.O.'s that are going out more on a story than results," said Howard Berke, who has been involved in many start-up companies since the 1970's and is now chairman and chief executive of Konarka Technologies, a privately held company in Lowell, Mass., focused on applying nanotechnology to solar energy. "Wall Street likes the promise, but it won't buy the promise alone," Mr. Berke said. Analysts like Matthew Nordan, vice president for research at Lux Research in New York, said that Nanosys's problems might make potential offerings from nanotechnology companies like Nanofilm that have products and profits even more appealing. But many nanotechnology companies that are already public seemed to suffer by association yesterday. Nanogen >, which uses nanotechnology to make high-performance research tools, fell 99 cents, to $3.81. Nanophase Technologies which makes tiny mineral particles that are used in sunscreen products, lost 31 cents, to $5.69. Harris & Harris, a publicly traded investment group that specializes in nanotechnology and owns 1.58 percent of Nanosys, fell 85 cents, to $8.53. Nanosys announced in April that it wanted to raise as much as $115 million from its offering. Pioneering start-up companies in the field popped up on Wall Street in the late 1990's, and several others, including Lumera and Immunicon, sold shares recently. But Nanosys grabbed the spotlight like no other nanotechnology company because of the scope of its ambition and its track record in attracting big-name partners. Nanosys has collected a formidable pool of patents from leading nanotechnology experts at research hot spots like Harvard University and the University of California at Berkeley. And it is being paid by companies like Intel DuPont and Matsushita Electric Works to work with them to develop products. It has also obtained research contracts with the federal government. Nanosys says its technology could form the basis for breakthrough products in fields like energy, electronics and medicine. When President Bush signed a bill in December to direct billions of dollars in federal research money to nanotechnology, Nanosys was the one company invited to the ceremony to represent the dreams of the diverse array of big and small companies investing in such technology. Nanotechnology derives its name from the nanometer, which is a billionth of a meter. That is a realm so small that dimensions can be measured in molecules. When familiar materials are fashioned at such a small scale, many develop traits like unusual strength or flexibility, while others become transparent to light waves or much more reactive. The unifying theme in patents from Nanosys is their focus on silicon and other inorganic materials. Much of the excitement in the field has been directed at novel carbon compounds and other organic materials, in part because many experts think the resulting products will be more environmentally safe. "Nanosys has cornered the market on the inorganic stuff," said Steve Crosby, president and publisher of Small Times Media, a company based in Ann Arbor, Mich., that follows nanotechnology. "If they can make it work, they own it.'' Investors approached by Merrill and the other banks had two concerns. Could Nanosys actually make it to market with profitable products? And if Nanosys accomplished that goal, what were the chances that investing at the prices the company sought this week would pay off? Nanosys's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission warned that it might have to raise more money as early as next year, which would dilute investments made this year. Lawrence A. Bock, the executive chairman of the company and the leader of the team of experienced entrepreneurs that put Nanosys together, has a strong track record of creating viable enterprises that pay off for the venture capitalists who back them. But long-term public shareholders have not necessarily fared so well. For instance, Caliper Technologies >, a laboratory equipment company that Mr. Bock founded and led before moving on to create Nanosys, went public in late 1999 at $16 a share, soared to $195 in its first few months of trading and then plunged, along with other technology stocks, in 2000. Now trading as Caliper Life Sciences, it closed yesterday at $5.49. Nanosys planned to go public at a time when early investors in publicly traded nanotechnology stocks are suffering from the enthusiasm they felt for the field earlier this year. Merrill Lynch's nanotech stock index, which tracks 25 companies, hit its peak of 290.72 on Jan. 28, the first day it was publicly listed. It closed yesterday at 182.48, down more than 37 percent. A 15-company nanotechnology index maintained by Punk, Ziegel &amp; Company, an investment bank, peaked on Jan. 20, just before Merrill began its competing index. It has fallen at roughly the same rate, said Dr. Juan F. Sanchez, the nanotechnology analyst at Punk, Ziegel. The investor wariness is even more pronounced in the venture capital world, analysts said. Venture capital firms put just $79 million into nanotechnology companies in the first six months of this year, down from $325 million for all of 2003 and $386 million in 2002, Mr. Nordan, of Lux Research, said. That retreat has been spurred by prominent venture capitalists like Vinod Khosla, who have been warning that investors eager to stake out a position in nanotechnology poured more money into the sector than entrepreneurs could wisely deploy. Whether Wall Street agreed or simply viewed Nanosys itself as too risky is not yet clear.

      Kerry honored at communist museumPhotograph hangs in section devoted to war protesters Posted: June 1, 200412:14 p.m. Eastern © 2004 WorldNetDaily.com A Ho Chi Minh City museum that honors Vietnam war protesters features a photograph of Sen. John Kerry being greeted by the general secretary of the Communist Party, Comrade Do Muoi. A snapshot of the display in the Vietnamese Communist War Remnants Museum – formerly known as the "War Crimes Museum" – was acquired over the weekend by Jeffrey M. Epstein of  urlLink Vietnam Vets for the Truth , a group opposing Kerry's campaign for the presidency. Vietnam veteran Bill Lupetti took this photograph of a display at a Ho Chi Minh City museum honoring war protesters. A spokesman with Kerry's national campaign did not return a call from WND seeking comment. The snapshot of the display, which depicts a July 1993 meeting, was forwarded to Epstein by Bob Shirley, one of more than 200 members of  urlLink Swift Boat Veterans for the Truth  who signed an open letter  urlLink questioning Kerry's fitness to serve as commander in chief . Epstein said the picture of the display was taken by Bill Lupetti, a Swift Boat Veteran who currently is visiting Vietnam. Epstein said the display photograph's "unquestionable significance lies in its placement in the American protesters' section of the War Crimes Museum" in Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon. "The Vietnamese communists clearly recognize John Kerry's contributions to their victory," he said.

      August 1, 2004 Before You Buy Into That I.P.O., Search 'Lemmings'By GARY RIVLIN TEVEN A. BALLMER, the chief executive of  urlLink Microsoft , recently sent a sly but unmistakable message to the executives at Google. Think of it as a sobering peek into the future, written by the leader of a longtime Wall Street star for the benefit of its latest boy wonder. There are "soon-to-be-public companies," Mr. Ballmer wrote last month in his annual e-mail message taking measure of his company and the technology industry, "that will deal, as we have, with flat stock price for a number of years while they build adequate profits" to justify their stock price. Take it from a behemoth now suffering from middle-age aches and pains. The inflated expectations of Wall Street might seem a validation of your hard work and potential, Microsoft's chief executive seemed to be saying, but over time it will also be a burden - maybe even a curse. Mr. Ballmer's message might well have been directed, too, at all those investors now contemplating whether they should pay an extraordinarily high premium to own a small piece of Google, the world's most popular Internet search engine, when it finally goes public, probably in the middle of this month. According to a document it filed last Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Google expects to be worth $29 billion to $36 billion the day it goes public. That would instantly give this company, hatched in the late 1990's, a market value greater than that of  urlLink Ford Motor ,  urlLink Starbucks , Federal Express or Lockheed Martin, though Google generates a small fraction of the revenues these brand-name giants do. "If an investor asked me, 'Should I bid on this stock?' " said David Menlow, the president of the IPO Financial Network, an independent research firm, "I would respond with an unqualified 'no.' " Yet one man's "financial train wreck," to borrow Mr. Menlow's phrase, is another's rare chance to magically transform a modest stash of cash into a single-stock retirement fund. "Google might look ridiculously expensive," said Michael Moe, the chief executive of ThinkEquity Partners, a research-oriented investment bank specializing in growth industries. "But Microsoft,  urlLink Cisco ,  urlLink Qualcomm  - take your pick. All came out with a lot of fanfare and people said they were ridiculously expensive - and all of them proved a great investment. "This is like making a bet on a thoroughbred," he said. "You're paying a premium." Investing in a newly minted stock is always risky. More than 5,000 companies went public between 1989 and 2000, according to Richard J. Peterson, chief market strategist for Thomson First Call. Nearly one-third of those companies are down 50 percent or more since their stock market debut, Mr. Peterson said - if they are even still in business. Only one-fifth are worth at least twice their opening day price. Moreover, this year has been a terrible one for technology companies new to the stock market. Two dozen technology-related companies have gone public in 2004, Mr. Peterson said; collectively they were down more than 10 percent as of Friday's stock market close. That compares with a gain of about 1 percent in the share price for the nontechnology companies that have gone public this year Google is hardly just another company seeking to sell shares on the stock market. But, then, that is already reflected in the share price, which is expected to be the highest ever for an initial public offering. In Monday's filing, Google said it expected its shares to sell for $108 to $135 each. Even assuming that Google sells initially for $108 per share, that would make the company worth 150 times its last four quarters of earnings. By contrast, its Internet rival,  urlLink Yahoo , is valued at 105 times earnings, and Microsoft 39 times earnings. Still, Barry Randall, a mutual fund manager, is among those thinking about taking the plunge. The company's balance sheets, at least at quick glance, he said, are compelling. According to Google's most recent filing, it has a gross profit margin "in the high 80 percent range," said Mr. Randall, who runs the First American Technology Fund, which specializes in technology stocks. "Your average tech stock," he said, "has gross margins of 40 percent." Still, it seems legitimate to ask if any company, no matter how extraordinary, should trade at such sky-high multiples. As even Google acknowledges in its S.E.C. filings, competitors threaten its dominance in search, from Yahoo and Microsoft to any number of lesser-known rivals. Moreover, Google can maintain its torrid rate of growth - which it must do to justify so extravagant a stock market valuation - only if it increases traffic on its site. That is no easy task given that it's already the default search engine for much of the world. (That explains recent initiatives like Gmail, a free e-mail service from Google that challenges offerings by Yahoo and Microsoft.) "The company's valuation is clearly based more on the hype factor than business fundamentals," said Ashok Kumar, a technology analyst at Raymond James &amp; Company. Unlike many of the Internet companies that came to life at the end of the last decade, Google turns a sizable profit ($79 million in the second quarter of 2004, up 147 percent from a year earlier). But Mr. Kumar nonetheless concluded that its pricing "harkens back to the late 90's boom." As many people learned the hard way after the bubble burst in 2000, the stock market value of a technology company is not based as much on its intrinsic worth as on an assessment of its future earning power. How one answers when asked to consider the wisdom of investing in Google, then, seems to say as much about that individual's faith in the technology sector generally as about his or her view of Google. "Basically we're looking at your classic bull versus bear tussle over Google for a long time to come," Mr. Moe said. Mr. Moe is among those who say they believe the technology sector is undervalued. Then there is Fred Hickey, editor of The High-Tech Strategist in Nashua, N.H., and a longtime technology stock analyst who stands out as perhaps the most bearish of them all. To him, the steep price Google has assigned itself is proof that the stock market has not shaken off the excesses of the bubble. "Look at history," Mr. Hickey said. "There's never been valuations of 100 times revenues, except during this bubble." Mr. Hickey concedes that there is a certain logic to Google's price. The pricing of a stock on Wall Street is not unlike that of the real estate market, where the worth of a property is set largely by recent sales prices of like properties, or "comps." Yahoo, the other large company that sells advertising tied to Internet searches, seems to be everyone's favorite comp to justify Google's valuation. "Everyone is playing the 'relative-to' game," Mr. Hickey said. "Google has a reasonable valuation if you assume its fellow Internet stocks, like Yahoo, are reasonably priced. The problem is, as we saw in March 2000, that game works - but only for a while." Mr. Kumar is not nearly as dour in his assessment of technology's future as Mr. Hickey, but he, too, says he is inclined to believe that technology sector valuations are generally too high. And he is hardly alone in that assessment, he said. "Most portfolio managers are underweighting technology," Mr. Kumar said, "because they don't feel the reward of the upside is commensurate with the downside risk." Technology companies account for roughly 16 percent of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, yet by his calculations, technology stocks account for between 13 and 14 percent of the overall basket of stocks held by portfolio managers. Apparently, Wade Slome, co-manager of the American Century Ultra Fund, a $22 billion growth stock mutual fund, is braver than much of his cohort. He's bullish on Internet stocks, and generally optimistic about the broader technology market. I THINK people are a little too pessimistic, given all the uncertainties," Mr. Slome said. "Whether you're talking the election, Iraq, inflation or interest rates, there's so many things for people to worry about." It's no surprise, then, that Mr. Slome plans to take a hard look at Google. Whether he will actually make a bid, though, is unclear. Typically, institutional money mangers like him set a stock's opening price in the rarefied world of I.P.O.'s. Google, however, is selling shares to the public in an unconventional Internet-based auction that puts the public on equal footing with the professionals. Given all the hype, Mr. Slome said, "You could really have retail investors take this to levels that are silly." That is what worries Mr. Menlow of the IPO Financial Network. He is convinced that institutional investors will largely shun the Google offering, allowing the wider public to price the deal. "That's dangerous on a hot deal," Mr. Menlow said. "You have to price a deal based on some kind of financial model, not the highest price people are willing to pay in a supercharged environment." He emphasized that he was a big fan of the company, but said he believed that an Internet auction would inevitably mean a lot of average people holding overpriced shares of Google. "I don't want make any disparaging remarks about the individual investors," he said, "but when you entrust the pricing of a company to amateurs, people end up getting hurt."

      REPUBLICANS PLAN PUSH FOR ELIMINATION OF IRS**Exclusive**A domestic centerpiece of the Bush/GOP agenda for a second Bush term is getting rid of the Internal Revenue Service, the DRUDGE REPORT has learned.The Speaker of the House will push for replacing the nation's current tax system with a national sales tax or a value added tax, Hill sources tell DRUDGE."People ask me if I’m really calling for the elimination of the IRS, and I say I think that’s a great thing to do for future generations of Americans," Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert explains in his new book, to be released on Wednesday."Pushing reform legislation will be difficult. Change of any sort seldom comes easy. But these changes are critical to our economic vitality and our economic security abroad,"  urlLink Hastert declares in SPEAKER: LESSONS FROM FORTY YEARS IN COACHING AND POLITICS. "“If you own property, stock, or, say, one hundred acres of farmland and tax time is approaching, you don’t want to make a mistake, so you’re almost obliged to go to a certified public accountant, tax preparer, or tax attorney to help you file a correct return. That costs a lot of money. Now multiply the amount you have to pay by the total number of people who are in the same boat. You can’t. No one can because precise numbers don’t exist. But we can stipulate that we’re talking about a huge amount. Now consider that a flat tax, national sales tax, or VAT would not only eliminate the need to do this, it could also eliminate the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) itself and make the process of paying taxes much easier.""By adopting a VAT, sales tax, or some other alternative, we could begin to change productivity. If you can do that, you can change gross national product and start growing the economy. You could double the economy over the next fifteen years. All of a sudden, the problem of what future generations owe in Social Security and Medicare won’t be so daunting anymore. The answer is to grow the economy, and the key to doing that is making sure we have a tax system that attracts capital and builds incentives to keep it here instead of forcing it out to other nations."Developing...
