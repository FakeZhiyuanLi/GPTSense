      Today I had exams, I was really stressed out. I felt prepared because I was up until 2:00 am, studying. I studyied about 5 hrs. yesterday. Anyway when I got to school and started my first exam, it was so easy. It took me like 45 mins. tops, everyone else took almost an hour and a half. Then in my next exam, I was done in less then 30mins. Their wasn't another person done for like an hour. It was suppose to be the hardest exam. I almost laughed at how easy it was. That was pretty much how it was for my last exams today too. So I guess all that studying was a waste of my time. I could have been working on my website, or something. O well, can't change it now.

      If you were a wrestler, what would be your finishing move?  My finishing move would be something that put them against the ropes, then makes them fall, and get pinned. I think that the fake wrestleing of TV is Gay though so it would never happen.

      It is the last week of school, and I am stressing out becuase of exams. I need to pass the Algebra II exam, to pass the class. I am going to study as much as I can. Any way, this weekend wasn't to bad, I went to a fire at Matt's, it was pretty cool. I got a picture of my ass, and my weiner taken. It seemed cool at the time, but afterwards, I really regretted it, but o well. Well I am out of stuff to write about, and I have to study. Later

      You've got to make contact with the alien leader. How will you tell when the conversation is finished?  I could proboly tell because they will stop shooting their lasers, any alien that comes to Earth is most likely here to attack. I don't know why Earth sucks, we have completely ruined it, but o well their loss.

      Today is Friday, time for the weekend. There is an extremely bad storm going on, their is talk of it being a tornado on TV. So I am waiting to see what happens, it is really cool. On a lighter note, their are only four more days of school, which is both good and bad. It is good because their is a three month vaction, but it is bad because of EXAMS...I have to do some major studying, so I can pass. Next year I am going to PENTA, it is a tech. school, most people that go their are stupid, I am fairly intelligent. I am going so that I can get my A+ Certifacation through the class I am taking. I also would like to go to college, hopefully MIT, this class will make the transition to college a lot easier. Well I am out of stuff to write for today, check back later to see what I'm up to.  Later

      Random Question:    Your superpower is that you smell like dandelions whenever someone lies. How will you maintain your secret identity?   I would become a judge, who has the hobby of being a florist, that way I know when people are lying, and if they ask why I smell like flowers I tell them about my hobby.
