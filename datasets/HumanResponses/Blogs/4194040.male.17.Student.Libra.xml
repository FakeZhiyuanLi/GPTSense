      Friday - got to move in 2 days early to avoid the rush of 20k-30k students moving in all at the same time. In the evening the ROTC guys walked around, talked, answered a couple questions, and then we went to a Pub and sat around, meeting people.  Saturday - Climbing Wall, Spider Web, One Man Rope Bridge. Free meals all day. Did some "drill and ceremony" for a couple minutes, the parade rest is messed up. yeesh. I am the master of the climbing wall. Could have watched Stripes but went out and met people instead. Had to fill out about a dozen pages of paperwork. Did a lot of talking among each other and the other MS cadets. So all is good.  Today..some sort of games and barbecue.

      Most of these Rangers had been kicked around some, had tasted failure. But there were no goof-offs. Every man had worked to be here, probably harder than he'd ever worked in his life. those with troubled pasts had taken harsh measure of themselves. Beneath their best hard-ass act, most were achingly earnest, patriotic, and idealistic. They had literally taken the army up on its offer to "Be All You can Be"  We know you got the brains, because you had to have a 110 GT to get here, We know you got the brawn, because you all just passed the PT test. The formula for making it through the Q-Course is really simple. It's 10% Brains, 10% Brawn, and 90% Heart, add that up and you get 110%, that's what you need to give everyday, day in and day out, and I guarantee, you'll make it through this course, now we're going to find out, just how much heart you've got.  Don't be light. Don't be late.  Somebody has to get in and kill the enemy. Somebody has to be in the infantry and the paratroops. If the country all had your attitude, nobody would fight, everybody would be in the Quartermaster. And what kind of a country would that be?

      The war in France has been especially vicious because it was one of the last stands for the enemy. We have won because of many things. We have won partly because the enemy was weakened from our other battles. The war in France is our grand finale, but the victory here is the result of all the other victories that went before. It is the result of Russia, and the western desert, and the bombings, and the blocking of the sea. It is the result of Tunisia and Sicily and Italy; we must never forget or belittle those campaigns.  We have won because we have had magnificent top leadership, at home and in our Allies and with ourselves overseas. Surely America made its two perfect choices in General Eisenhower and General Bradley. They are great men - to me doubly great because they are great and kind.  We won because we were audacious. One could not help but be moved by the colossus of our invasion. It was a bold and mighty thing, one of the epics of all history. In the emergency of war our nation's powers are unbelievable. The strength we have spread around the world is appalling even to those who make up the individual cells of that strength. I am sure that in the past two years I have heard soldiers say a thousand times, "If only we could have created all this energy for something good." But we rise above our normal powers only in times of destruction.  We have won this war because our men are brave, and because of many other things - because of Russia, and England, and the passage of time, and the gift of nature's materials. We did not win it because destiny created us better than all other peoples. I hope that in victory we are more grateful than we are proud. I hope we can rejoice in victory - but humbly. The dead men would not want us to gloat.  The end of one war is a great fetter broken from around our lives. But there is still another to be broken. The Pacific war may yet be long and bloody. Nobody can foresee, but it would be disastrous to approach it with easy hopes. Our next few months at home will be torn between the new spiritual freedom of half peace and the old grinding blur of half war. It will be a confusing period for us.  Thousands of our men will soon be returning to you. They have been gone a long time and they have seen and done and felt things you cannot know. They will be changed. They will have to learn how to adjust themselves to peace. Last night we had a violent electrical storm around our countryside. The storm was half over before we realized that the flashes and the crashings around us were not artillery but plain old-fashioned thunder and lightning. It will be odd to hear only thunder again. You must remember that such little things as that are in our souls, and will take time.  And all of us together will have to learn how to reassemble our broken world into a pattern so firm and so fair that another great war cannot soon be possible. To tell the simple truth, most of us over in France don't pretend to know the right answer. Submersion in war does not necessarily qualify a man to be the master of the peace. All we can do is fumble and try once more - try out of the memory of our anguish - and be as tolerant with each other as we can.   -Ernie Pyle

       "On the morning of October 4, 1993, I swore allegiance to the truth, no matter the consequences. It is one of the most important promises made to God that I have kept."   -Michael Durant   "The commander in the field is always right, and the rear echelon is always wrong, until proven otherwise."   -Colin Powell    "Look back but don't stare"   The above is taken from Michael Durant's book,  In the Company of Heroes.  A highly suggested read for anyone, pick it up sometime or if you want to borrow it send me a message. Definetly worth investing some time in. If you want to see who real heroes are, this is a must read.

      We enlist for what we can give, not what we can receive. Thats why we call it "The Service", we serve others before we even think of serving ourselves.  Your family, friends and your children will miss you as terribly as you miss them and they'll never want you to leave their side again. It is the sad true nature of the military family. This is something you're going to have to face square one or you're doomed before you begin.  You say you want to enlist to provide a better life for your children? Wrong, dead wrong if you're enlisting for the benefits. There are a lot of easier ways to make a living than being in the military because it's not just a job, it becomes your whole life.  You have to be prepared to drop everything you're doing and leave everything you love in the name of duty. The hours are long, the pay is lousy and the working conditions can be totally brutal and if you stay around long enough, friends die and you will see combat. It is the true nature of military life.  You enlist to serve your country because you believe in who you are and what you're doing as an American servicemember. In fact, you believe so much that you willingly put your life on the line in accomplishment of your unit's mission and most importantly, to protect the lives of your friends, your fellow servicemembers.  If you're enlisting for any other reason, you're fooling yourself and you'll make a lousy servicemember because you're breaking the most basic fundamental trust you make when you raise your right hand and swear in. That basic trust is serving others before you even begin to think of yourself. Thats why we call it "The Service" because we serve others, it's as simple as that.  If you can put others before yourself and even your own family, welcome aboard. If you can't then don't put yourself or the people around you in that situation because you won't be any good to your friends or your unit.
