      O yeah, Its been really sad these past weeks b/c my great uncle had a stroke and now hes in a nurseing home. Last i heard he was paralized on his right side and might stay paralized forever. Theres so many questions that have yet to be answered so i pray that God will answer them with what he thinks is right. Also, hes not saved so please help me and pray for him daily that he will be able to pull out of this. My aunt is saved.......i think and shes had a really hard time getting around b/c she cant drive and nothing is walking distance from her house. I also pray that God will help her in everything that is going on. Another tragety is that my grandma is in the hospital b/c of a pendacitis (I think thats what it is) but i PTL that she was able to catch it in time. Even though she has to spend the night in the hospital i thank the Lord that is was not fatal. Also, pray for my mom b/c shes really stressed out right now with my great aunt, great uncle, grandmother, and another aunt thats having a hard time with public transportation. She has to also do this Medical that helps my great aunt get money to pay for my great uncles medical stuff since its going to be like $300 a day for him to stay in a nurseing home. If you can help me pray for this stuff i would really appreciate it.

      Hey, Havent blogged in a while. Im still thinking about if i should stay with blog or go with xanga. Ill tell you the pros and cons of each since im blogging right now. The good think about blog is that its more powerful, you can do more things with it, and the graphics are better. The pros for xanga is that its easy to use and i can actually edit my xanga unlike blog. The con of blog is that you have to know HTML in order to do ANYTHING except posting. The cons for xanga is that they all look the same and of course its not as "powerful." O yeah and another thing is that blog has less down time then xanga, which means that you can edit at anytime for blog but sometimes you have to wait like 2 hours in order to post in the xanga. I cant confirm that this is true so if this happens or doesnt happen to you then please tell me. If you have any opinion of why you like one of these better then the other then PLEASE tell me. Right now i cant really decide so i plan to just keep on editing both until i come up with a choice.

      Hola ppl, Today was crazy busy b/c i got up at like 8:00 and got ready to have a PIGS (Puppets In Gods Service) meeting at the Wongs house. I was still really tired b/c i always go to bed at like 1 or 2 on the weekends. So i got up ate some waffles and then ran out the door to go to Fremont. Then i stayed there for hours and hours getting ready for tomorrows performance at church. My arms got hecka tired from holding them up and also my fingers got tired from going up and down. After practice i sayed there for another hour and played Settlers of Catan or something like that.....ps thats a really fun game. Then i came home, watched the sharks win in OT 2-1.......ahhhhhh what a crazy game, played hocky, went on the computer to find NO ONE on to play Gunbound with, and then went out to eat with my bro b/c my parents were at a Valentines Adult Fellowship for my church. I came home, watched Out of Time, and now im sitting in front of the comp updating my blog. Tomorrow is the PIGS performance so please pray for our group that we spread the "good news" and glorify God in all that we do. ttfn

      Hey, I havent posted in a while so now that im bored i think i will post. IM watching the sharks game right now and im about to cry because they're losing 4-1. Thats why im bored b/c i cant bare to watch it anymore. Well the last couple of days have been the same for me except for today when i was in the media center. I had to take a test and i took me the WHOLE time to do only 16 problems and also i still had one that i didnt finish so thats probably going to be wrong. Also, right now im soooooooooo scared b/c i have a really hard english test on the Red Badge of Courage tomorrow and i need to study really hard. I think ill use some notes at http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/redbadge/study.html. I hope they'll help me out but if you look at this site then DO NOT take the quiz b/c its really wacked. I think ill go study now b/c the Sharks are still losing 4-2. Ill blog on a better day. byebye

      Hey readers, today i took both tests in L Science and in AH and they were okay. The science test was mostly easy but there was a couple of them i didnt know. AH was great again b/c mr. b can always make funny jokes during class. Spanish class was great b/c my teach has a machine that gives out air that helps you think and calm down. To tell you the truth, it smells okay but i dont think it works b/c ppl in my class are always still talking and they get crazy. English made me tired and sleepy so i have no clue what the next two chapters are about b/c i didnt hear it, woops....... Laccrosse was fun but im really bad at it for some reason. Last year i was pretty good, but now i forget the rules and cant scoop it up. Bible was fun fun fun of course and yesterday mr. merrell gave me a packet of Eclipse gun that was CHERRY flavor. Its really good but when you first try it, it tastes like medicine. I gotta go get more of this stuff and give it to my AP crew (lol). Sharks play today!!!!!!!!!!!  P.S. If you read my blog then IM me so i know its not a complete waste of time.

      Hey people, Today was a boreing day b/c of test reviews and reading a book that had to be the worste civil war book ever made. First in science we saw a video on the 30 hour famine and it was really sad. It talked about how every day 29,000 people die from hunger each day in 3rd world countries. I made me want to make a commitment to do it but i cant since i have an important stuff going on for youth grouo and im a council member. Besides that my first two periods were test reviews and my 3rd peroid honors class was really funny b/c our teacher told us about her "adventures" on the sr. ski trip she went on. The stories she told were great and remember that a trip really isnt a good trip unless you got memories to share with other ppl. In spanish class we did........... well nothing really. For English i was reading the red badge of courage until i closed my eyes and accidently drooled on my self (woops) while falling asleep. The rest of my day was great after that b/c bible and P.E. are my favorite classes. Tomorrow is going to be hard b/c i have 2 tests to take and then i have to work on my baseball card project about jerry rice. TTFN

      Hey ppl, Today was good b/c in chapel they talkedon peer pressure and how not to give in. It talked about having friends that will help you instead of asking you for answers or telling you to go steal something for them. I would say i have pretty good friends, but the only thing they do thats bad is ask me for answers b/c they forgot to do their hw or they were to lazy. I would say that its really hard sometimes to say NO because they're your friends and you want the best for them. After that was advisory where we wrote this stupid story to try to get candy. I thought that was really weird, but it did waste time which was the main objective of advisory. Then came P.E. where we saw a video on lacrosse. IT was like 20 years old! I already know how to play so i just sat there and acted like i was learning something. O yeah also in Weights we played reverse kickball. It was really fun, but the only thing is that since im A period thats about all we get to do. In other classes they get to go to Qzar, go bowling, play tennis, go on hikes, and do other stuff, but we cant do any of that b/c A period is at 7:00 in the morning. Thats what i really hate about A period but i guess its okay since i get to go next year for Health and guess who the teacher is....... Mr Ecklund, my teacher for weights.

      Today we got to cut open a worm for science. It was kinda kewl but i wish that we could have cut something bigger instead b/c it was really hard to see inside the worm. In AH we watched a video on jackie robinson, which was kinda kewl but i couldnt stay awake. In math we watched a lame video on mazes. I mean come on atleast if we were going to watch something to waste time then we should of watched Finding Nemo. Who really even cares about mazes!??? Then i had lunch in the gym where i almost got pegged in the head by a flying ball. Luckily i was paying attention and moved just before i caught it with my eye... In spanish we played a game which was okay considering i had some of the dumbest ppl on my team and they were all lazy. We got blown out and the only point we got was by the dumbest guy in our class. I was like whoa...... After that i came home and now im sitting here writing about my boreing day.

      IM watchin the Super Bowl right now and im really bored because no ones scored yet! I went to church today and we had our Chinese New Years service which was really nice since we had a group called 1AChord comeand sing for us. We also had a special number from the orchestra, which i was in. Also, PTL because my Grandfather got saved after the service and we were all really happy for him. For the longest time he wouldnt listen to my parents or my Grandma when they tried to talk to him, but one day we asked him to come and he came! I would like to praise the Lord for allowing this to happen and i pray that he will open up the hearts of all the rest of my unsaved family members.

      I got this from Alex V's profile........  One night I dreamed I was walking  Along the beach with the Lord.  Many scenes from my life flashed across the sky. In each scene I noticefootprints in the sand.Sometimes there were two sets of footprints. Other times there were one set of footprints. This bothered me because I noticed that During the low periods of my life when I was Suffering from anguish, sorrow, or defeat, I could see only one set of footprints, So I said to the Lord, "You promised me, Lord, that if I followed You,You would walk with me always.    But I noticed that during the most trying periods  Of my life there have only been  One set of prints in the sand. Why, When I have needed You most,  You have not been there for me?"The Lord replied, "The times when you have seen only one set of footprints  Is when I carried you."

Your parents buy you clothes and shoes many sizes too big so you can "grow into it" and wear it for years to come (right now I'm wearing duct-taped pants with a belt....actually all my stuff is taped) *ADDED BY ME, BUT DOESN'T APPLY TO ME OR MOST ABC FAMILIES* 63.

      Hey, havent blogged in a while............ i was going to blog yesterday on my laptop but it suddenly shut down on me so everything i had written down was lost. Well i think ill start off with CM.........it was really nerve racking going in and when i looked at the test, it was a lot harder then last years test (the one i studied off of). So for now ill sit and wait for the results and practice the rest of my pieces for my second half of CM.       This week was spirit week for the jr. high. We had to dress up everyday and then do a skit on Thursday(today). Right now im really hateing my homeroom because we're so unorganized and no one really gives a care about anything we do. Last year was the best in mr. merrells class b/c we won in like 3 ralleys. All i got to say is "theres nothing like the past." All my classes have been fine and for once im actually getting an A in english........ The sharks play today against LA and i guess ill just sit here and work on my Celebrity Christian report on Rick Quan. This is kevin blogging out.........

      Hey, Today i went to church as usual and went to Children's Church to help out. After school, i went home and watched the Sharks lose 4-0 to the Dallas Stars. I didnt know i liked hockey that much because i was literally going to cry for some strange reason. Its kinda weird b/c i cant cry during "The Passion" but i was about to cry when i saw the Sharks get shut out. I thought that was kinda weird and strange on my part. After that sad moment i went to the Dublin track and ran a mile for a boy scout Merit badge. I cant believe that i was really slow b/c my time was 9:14 and last year it was 7:54. Of course last year after i was done I fell on the ground and couldnt get up for like 5 minutes. Then i came home and thats where i am right now just sitting down and watching Full House. I have CM next week and im really nervious so please pray for me. Thanks.................bye

      hey, havent blogged in A WHILE............... well first i think ill start with the famine. It was one of the best experiences ive ever had just hanging with friends and seeing God come back to this school. We sang songs and danced......p.s. we also threw luis into the air and forgot to catch him(woops). The community service we great b/c me and some other ppl went to the movie theature at Hacenda and interviewed random ppl. It was really fun b/c we went to jamba juice and Best buys after that! After the whole thing, everyone went home and ate their "2nd" meal b/c the beans and rice they gave us were really small. I had tons of fun and hope that whenever we do it again, the ppl who didnt do it (not nameing names) would do it with the rest of us.  Now on to "The Passion of The Christ" which i saw today with my school. My first thought was that it was really gory but when i thought about it, ppl dont realize how much Jesus did for us by being beaten and crucified. They read it in the Bible and say, "O yeah he died for us....wow great thats good for him." People also see on paintings that Jesus had like 4-5 red marks in his body but in real life he was flogged/wipped like 30-40 times and thats A LOT more then 4-5. My favorite part was when that dove showed up when Jesus was getting beaten up. I really like this movie and also thought it was gory but i can see that Mel Gibson had to make it like this b/c he wanted ppl to see the Truth of it all. Im seeing it tomorrow so when i see it i might have a different view point the second time around.

      hey, been really busy so far....This week is SAT's and then we're off to DC. SAT's are really kinda easy and after we get to do hw that we're going to miss during our trip. My mind is really blank right now and i dont even remember what happened at school. The only thing that im really thinking about is DC and the great time im hopeing to have. I get to do this wreath laying ceremony thing at the tomb of the unknown soldiers (i think thats where it is). Me and 3 other ppl got picked out of my class of around 97 so thats kinda going to be exciting. Now i got to get into hyper gear and start packing....   For the world of Sports............ My sharks are leading 3-0 against the Colorado Avalanche in the Stanley Cup Playoffs. My favorite player (Marleau) has 7 goals i think and leads the league in goals. They will try to sweep the series tomorrow....... My Giants SUCK right now.........yesterday they finally pulled off a win but they still find themselves at the bottom of their division. Its all good though b/c its only the beginning of the season.   11 RULES FOR LIFE: I really Like #11  RULE 1: Life is not fair, get used to it.  RULE 2: The world won’t care about your self-esteem. The world will expect you to accomplish something BEFORE you feel good about yourself.  RULE 3: You will NOT make $40,000 a year right out of high school. You won’t be vice president with a car phone until you earn both.  RULE 4: If you think your teacher is tough, wait till you get a boss. He doesn’t have tenure.  RULE 5: Flipping burgers is not beneath your dignity. Your grandparents had a different word for burger-flipping; they called it opportunity.  RULE 6: If you mess up, it’s not your parents’ fault, so don’t whine a about your mistakes, learn from them.  RULE 7: Before you were born, your parents weren’t as boring as they are now. They got that way from paying your bills, cleaning your clothes and listening to you talk about how cool you are. So before you save the rain forest from the parasites of your parents’ generation, try "delousing" the closet in your own room.  RULE 8: Your school may have done away with winners and losers, but life has not. In some schools, they have abolished failing grades; they’ll give you as many times as you want to get the right answer. This doesn’t bear the slightest resemblance to ANYTHING in real life.  RULE 9: Life is not divided into semesters. You don’t get summers off and very few employers are interested in helping you find yourself. Do that on your own time.  RULE 10: Television is NOT real life. In real life people actually have to leave the coffee shop and go to jobs.  RULE 11: Be nice to nerds. Chances are you'll end up working for one.  I think ill blog one last time tommorrow or ill blog on Thursday.........bye

You can handle details well. You have a methodical mind.   T. (I dont want to give out my middle name unless i decide to tell you) AS You are an overly sensitive person, often falling into a savior-martyr role. You are very skeptical and have more than your share of bad luck. You work hard to achieve material success through your own efforts. You have a great deal of loyalty to those you love. You have much inner strength. You are always involved with projects and things to do. You have much enthusiasm with a driving attitude toward achievement in life. You try to be prudent.

The meaning of my last name is so true. I like sports, i love to travel, and im i hard worker (sometimes). Really weird......

           Hey, just got back 2 days ago from down south. First it was Universal and then Disneyland. They were both pretty fun but at universal there was nothing new and it was basically all shows. Disney is always fun fun fun but space mountain was closed off so that was pretty sad. Of course the lines were really really really long and we had to wait for a long time. It was fun though b/c we were there until 12 at night and the lines got a little shorter. Rides are a lot more fun at night for some reason.... While we were down there we also went to USC, UC Irvine, and Biola or however you spell it. Irvine and USC were nice, but the other one looked somewhat like a high school which i thought was kinda weird. After staying there for like 5 days, we went to Big Bear Lake. It was really small and really nice "cozy" little city out in the middle of nowhere. We went hikeing the first day and then during the second day the funniest thing happened. As we got to the top of the mountain, it started to snow. We're like, "we better start heading down." When we started, it got heavier and its like, "since when does it snow close to summer???" So we spent the whole time watching the snow while we were shopping. Ive never actually shopped while its been snowing. That part of the trip was kinda weird..... Before i started on my "journey" down to SoCal i got kinda sick. I think i got it on Sunday (not naming any names) during church and that kinda ruined my trip but its all good. Now its back to reality..... so excited to be going on the DC trip in 10 days. I can hang with all my azn brothers/sisters for a whole week.... Also, i finally got my youth group to change the joint meeting date with CCCAC or is it CCAC!?? I dont know! My friend Michael always says it so fast that i cant tell which one it is..sorry Thats it for now.. peace

      Hey, ppl im going down south for the week and wont be back until Sunday.............. Im going to miss most of the Sharks games so im really sad about that (i hope i get to see the game down south)  Im going to say a "short section" on the Sharks game since my sanity has been questioned because of talking about the sharks a little too much. Well, here it goes.... The sharks won on Saturday 3-1 beating the St. Louis blues. My favorite player ("Patty" Marleau) scored 3 goals which means he got the hat trick. He scored 2 on the power play and 1 shorthanded. He is only the second player in sharks history to score a hat trick. They play on Monday in St. Louis...wish them luck!  I hope that was short enough....

      WoW, yesterday was crazy..........first of all the Sharks played their first playoff game and it was WILD. Shot after shot went back and forth on both sides. Each goalie stopped each shot and they were perfect for 3 periods of play. Each time someone had a penalty i would hold my breath to see if one of them scored or not but when it was all over, the score was still 0-0. I was sitting there with sweat running down my forehead and my heart beating 10 times faster then it usually does b/c this perticular game was very intense. The Sharks went into overtime tired but still hopeful of takeing that one game advantage over the St. Louis Blues. It was 4 minutes in when the sharks took it deep in the other teams zone. I rookie by the name of Dimitrakos had the puck and faked the big D out by takeing a fake shot. He brought it closer and closer until...............SCORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The Shakrs had won in overtime and that crowd went wild!!!!!!!!!!!!! The Sharks next game is on Sunday and i hope that everyone whos reading my blog will atleast take a look at it b/c it is really exciting.   I got a puppet meeting tomorrow so i probably wont be on...............  The Good Friday service was good, nice SHORT message by Pastor and a good time of fellowship after.  Take the Care Bear test....if you answer it truthfully then it will probably pick a good bear that fits you, i know the one that it picked for me was pretty true.           Tenderheart Bear     You are thinker, organizer, peacekeeper, and leader all in one. You have a power to command attention and people listen to you. However, you are often so concerned about not hurting others' feelings that you don't tell them what they need to hear and this gets you both into trouble. But you always have loyal friends to help you out.           urlLink  Take the  Which Care Bear Are You?  Quiz!

      Hey, yesterday was so much fun......... i first went to church as usual and then i went home and watched the Sharks game for like 30 minutes. The game was so crazy!!! First they where down 3-1 with 20 seconds left and i was like, "aww its okay if they win, they're going to the playoffs anyway." Then one of the defense men took a shot and scored with like 14 seconds left. I am like, "yes, they scored but it doesnt matter, theres only 14 seconds left and the puck is about to come out of the zone." Then it just so happened to stay in and someone shot it towards the net. The same guy who scored the goal before scored again! Im screaming my head off and so is everyone in san jose. SO we finally went to sudden death over time and 3:00 minutes in one of the sharks shot the puck and SCORED!!!!!!!!!!!! The game was over and the fans were even louder (including me) then before and it was the perfect game to end the season. After the game, i left for San Fran to see the Lion King and it was great. Good thing i didnt vote for it when we go to D.C.......... It was around 2 hours long and we got home around 10:00 but it was really worth it. It had great costumes and the scenery was really nice. Well thats all for now. peace out

      Recap of my week.............. Monday-um............. Tuesday-um............ O yeah i watched 24 finally after like 4 weeks of reruns Wed-um................. Thursday-Watched ER finally after like 3 weeks of reruns Friday- Now i must remember something b/c that was today............. um.............had a bible study...Worked on a science project... Watched Anne Frank in English which was like a big shocker (Peter sure hit it big on his first date). The Nazis were coming to take them away and then *Bang* it happened. It made everyone jump out of their seats which i thought was really funny. In bible we watched a video on evolution vs. creation. I really do believe in the Big Bang theory because when God spoke.........*Bang* it happened.   That was this week but last week was even better. First of all my bible teacher sent a 7th grader to our classroom and told my history teacher (Mr. B) that Mr. Merrell (bible teacher) wanted a aisle seat for DC because he doesnt like tight areas. So Mr. B told the 7th grader to stay in our classroom and read with us for a while. So he stayed and after like 30 minutes, Mr. M  comes marching in to our class and demands that we make a trade for students. So what ends up happening is that Mr. Merrell sent 2 of his 7th graders to stay in Mr.B's class and Mr. B sent 3 8th graders to Mr. M class. It just so happens that i had Mr. M last year for homeroom and now im one of the few that has him again this year, so over everyone he chose me to go back to his class (also half of the reason was b/c im azn and he loves the AP). For the rest of the time, i did 7th grade work in Mr. M's class while a 7th grader was doing my work in Mr. B's class. All i gotta say is good thing we we didnt have any homework or any quizes that day b/c if we did, that 7th grader would have brought my grade WAY down. I love when we do fun stuff like that! O yeah well that was during 2nd period but during 7th period the same thing happened except i was in Mr. M's class and i got transfered to Mr. B's class. I told Mr. M that i had to go b/c Mr. B felt bad when i left him. So he felt better when i transfered over back to his class. Every week is a new adventure in Mr. M's class and Mr. B's class.......Dang, i wrote a lot....if you dont get it then ill tell you personally what happened b/c it gets kinda complicated when your in class...I think ill go work on Mrs. Mass's website b/c she is the greatest math teacher on earth.

      Hey, I went to boomers on friday with 7 other churches. It was an allnighter so im still trying to recover from lack of sleep. Let me tell you that bumper boats at 2:00 in the morning is not fun....especially when its freezing cold outside. So I stayed there for the whole night and did: bumper boats, gocarts, lazer tag, golfing, and arcade games. It was really crowded too but it was fun getting to know everyone in your youth group better...while waiting in line.  This week has been the same. Lots of tests/quizes/hw to do and not that much time to finish them.   PTL- My aunt and uncle were baptized on Sunday Prayer- Please pray for my dads office assistent...she has cancer and has been working for my Dad for 14 years.

      Hey, I finally have time to blog a little........ First of all DC was GREAT! I loved it so much but i wish i could've spent more time there. We went to DC the first couple of days and saw all the monuments plus the memorials. Then we went to New York and saw a broadway play (Beauty and the Beast) and then went shopping. I stayed in the Double Tree hotel and the Embacy Suite hotel. They were both really nice and i have so many great memories not just at the hotel but on the bus/plane. Theres way too much to write about if i told you every little detail. All i gotta say is...yummy yummy yummy, free, free , free, take one, take one....lol so many good times. Lets see on friday my youth group had a joint meeting with CCCAC. It was really kewl and i hope to have another one some time.        This week was really busy... had/still have hw and test this week so thats why i havent had much time to do anything at all. On friday i go to Boomers for an all nighter so that will be a nice break. blog when i have time.........

      Hey, i havent actually written in my blog in a while. We'll I started out my summer by taking a trip to mexico for a week. I went to PV, Matzatlan, and Cabo San Lucas which were all pretty much tourist areas in mexico. My favorite memory was probably seeing the adults drink beer on the back of a truck during a tour. When we pulled up to another truck that was on the tour we were seeing who had drinken more from the bottle. Then both tour guides held up the beer and shouted, "Que Pasa" to the cops at a security check point. The cops turned on their alarm for a sec and then turned it off. It just so happened that our tour guide knew the cop so that was good. Things i bought from mexico were sunglasses that turn color in the light and then turn back when removed from the light. I also bought a silver ring and a pair of shorts that change color in the light. At the end of the cruise we drove back up but made a short visit to UCSB to check it out. Then we drove all the way back home....... On Thursday i went to the County Fair before it opened and got a job as a vendor in a funnel cake place. The pay is ok but its the EXPERIENCE that counts. So as of now ive been really busy working 5-7 hours a day selling funnel cakes. Yesterday, after work i went to the A's and Giants game at Net Work Associates in Oaktown. It was an exciting game and actually went into extra innings but in the end the A's won. Those stupid A's couldnt hold a 4 run lead in the 9th inning so they made us sit threw another 2 innings. The outcome wasnt to good but atleast they won today and ended up taking the series 2 games to 1. The highlights were seeing the die hard fans rooting for their team and seeing the other ppl yell at them to "sit the f***" down. There was even a fight going on right in front of our eyes and since i was with my church group we sat and shook our heads. I said, "atleast the giants fans are tougher then the A's fans jkjkjk. So that has been my summer so far........ hopefully if i have time, ill post a pic of the fight during the ball game. Heres a schedule of the bands playing at the County Fair............ im out   sun: 12-6 (Los Rieleros del Norte) mon: off (ZOEgirl) tue: 11-6 (Paul Revere and the Raiders) wed: 11-6 (Bo Diddley) thu: off (Tower of Power) fri: 9:30-3 (Paul Rodriguez) sat: 10-6 (The Spinners) sun: 10-7 (Red, White, and Blues) mon: 11-7 (Cowboy Crush) tue: 11-7 (War) wed: off (Crystal Gayle) thu: off (OC Supertones) fri: 10-7 (Night Ranger) sat: 11-7 (ConFunkShun) sun: 11-7 (Darryl Worley)

      Today, i took my spanish final and my english final....BACK TO BACK! That was really killer... but after that joseph drove me over to the Blackhawk Pool club thing. It was for our 8th grade grad party so everyone from school was there. Lets see....i had fun swimming, eating, and being abused by my shorter mom aka carmen. There was dancing, food, music, and also what i thought was really kewl was when they took a pic of us in front of a palm tree background. It was really hot at the start but then it cooled down (i think i got a little roasted). Luis was the champion of all the compitions which was really kewl. He got to represent the AP! After it was all said and done, I went to this Tapioca place which was really good. I had the Lychee smoothie with big tapioca balls inside. Tomorrow i have my last day of Jr. High.....going to a billiards place for 6th period and a party for 7th. blog later....im out

      The end of my jr high experience is about to come to an end in 2 days. Its been fun the past 2 years and ive enjoyed every minute of it...well not every minute. There were some road blocks and disappointments that i went through but in the end i guess it turned out ok. I must say that im excited that schools going to be over but im not excited about all my friends who ive known, ranging from 1-8 years, will be leaving and maybe never being seen again. The time has come when we got to move on and make new friends....but i never thought it would come this soon. Its also sad not being able to see some of my favorite teachers every day next year. We wont be able to walk in and see their smiling (mean face for MR. B jkjkjk) face as we walk to our desk. But life does move on and there is a time for everything like it says in the Bible. We'll after that sad note....graduation is hear in 2 days and our party in tomorrow. Its going to be so much fun! I g2g and study for my last 2 finals and i need to spend a lot of time on them because honestly they're going to be my hardest. Im out...

I think really the only one who reads this is   luis   which is good but bad at the same time since i know so many ppl. I think the only reason i write in this thing is to tell  myself  about my day and to tell  myself  how bad things get in my life.

      Friday- Lets seeeee.....on friday i stayed home about all day long until around 6:45 i left to go to Hayward for a joint/camp rally meeting with CCCAC. There were tons of ppl and overall i think that it went really well. They showed a video of the camp that was like from 10 years ago so of course i didnt recognize anyone on it. It was like dang thats really old yet on the video the camp basically looks the same. So i met a bunch of ppl, saw some old friends, and enjoyed the time of fellowship. After i got home and went to bed at like 3:00 am for some reason. Saturday- Whoa boy i cant say much for this day except that i woke up at 3 and like i was really dazed and dizzy. Sunday- Went to church and during sunday school we acted out the book of Esther which was extremely fun schtuff. Our parts included the dateing game and a movie showing of "Woman On A Mission." So i got home and stayed there until i went out to Chevys for dinner which was really yummy yummy yummy but not so free. O and by the way im still really jet lagged from the trip...

      Hey,&nbsp; just got back so now im here to tell you about basically my whole trip so here it is.   Thursday- Woke up at like 9:30 and loaded all the baggage into the car. Next, we headed towards the airport and parked our car at SFO parking. Got out and went on a shuttle to the airport. Arrived there in time to jump on a direct flight to Hong Kong that lasted around 13 hours. While on board i saw 4 movies that helped me waste time and had 3 meals to eat.&nbsp;13 hours later&nbsp;we arrived at the Hong&nbsp;Kong airport only to find that we landed in the middle of a typhoon. (Friday-By the time we got to the airport it was already Friday) So we were delayed a little bit but eventually jumped on a bus to go to our hotel around 30 minutes away. Arrived at the hotel and unloaded all our schtuff and went outside to go to McDonalds, im loving it. So we sat there and orderd food&nbsp;but found that there were&nbsp;so many different things that you&nbsp;couldnt find in the&nbsp;States. So after that long day we went back to the hotel to go to sleep.&nbsp;By the way, me and my bro had our own rooms so&nbsp;that was kinda neato.&nbsp;   Saturday- Woke up early and then walked around until lunch time when we met up with my Dad's old roomy from St. Luis, also named Kevin,&nbsp;and he took us to a private club where we had dim sum, which happened to be reeeeaaaaaaally good. Then he took us to places like Victoria Peak (Highest place in Hong Kong) and Stanely Market, which&nbsp;is one of the most famous areas to shop in. Victoria Peak&nbsp;was so high up and really scary but a really nice view. Stanley was really big with tons and&nbsp;tons of shops that i shot through in like 2-3 hours. So after that we went back to his really nice apartment for dinner to see his "crib" and stuff like that. His wife and kids were'nt home so we didnt get a chance to see them but o well&nbsp;maby next time. &nbsp;After the&nbsp;nice dinner made by&nbsp;his maid we headed back to the hotel to sleep.   Sunday- Got up early to go to church a couple of stops awy from our hotel. O by the way we got from place to place every single day by taking the MTR, which was a public transportation underground. It was really cheap and really convenient since it went all over Hong&nbsp;Kong. So we went to church and after went back to change from our nice clothes. We walked around after that and went out to lunch at this Japanese restaurant where we had like noodles and fried chicken.&nbsp;Then met up with my moms cousin at the MTR terminal and went out to lunch AGAIN. So after the nice lunch we met up with my old pastor and his wife who use to pastor our church but then moved back to Hong Kong. It was really nice to see them again since we hadnt seen them in like 3 years. So after a great time of fellowship and dinner we walked around another huge mall that was 9 stories high so when you get up to the top its really scary. Next, we parted ways and got back on the MTR to go to our hotel.   Monday- This&nbsp;was the big day, the day everyone that we met&nbsp;and talked to had warned us about. Going to Shenzghen or however its spelled.... Everyone had warned us about&nbsp;people stealing our money&nbsp;or drugging us&nbsp;and stealing our money by making us passout, or even killing us.&nbsp;SOooooooooo im like o man thats great just great. So the whole time&nbsp;i was really scared and i barely brought anything along with me. But this was the day that we hit the REAL CHINA! So we got on our way and&nbsp;had a really hard time getting through customs. They were staring at us and like saying all this stuff in Chinese that were really weird.&nbsp;So we finally got in and headed on our way to our first destination. It&nbsp;was a theme park called&nbsp;Windows of the World.&nbsp;It was full of miny&nbsp;monuments from all over the world.&nbsp;I wish i could've got something from there but there was really no giftshops at all.&nbsp;The really&nbsp;kewl thing was that they had a inside ski slope where people can ski, snowboard, or just slide down the hill. So after we finished going&nbsp;throught the park we went&nbsp;for lunch at this restaurant that gave us kinda really bad food.&nbsp;It was okay&nbsp;to me but everyone else almost starved from not eating. After lunch we headed over to another theme park called Splendid China where they had minature things except they were all from China. We saw the Great Wall and other minature places that ive never heard of.&nbsp;O yeah before that we actually went to like 2 theme parks before that but i forgot the&nbsp;name of them but it really wouldnt matter b/c they were kinda boring. SO we ate dinner which&nbsp;was almost exactly like the stuff we had for lunch. If you're getting tired&nbsp;of reading this i really wouldnt&nbsp;blame you.&nbsp;Then we saw a lazor light show that had a lot of dancing and good stuff like that.&nbsp;It was really nice but it looked way to busy on the stage.&nbsp;O yeah! It included live horses and live goats which i thought was kinda interesting. So by then we were really beat so they took us back to the hotel and once we got there i&nbsp;believe we headed to the night markets&nbsp;which say open&nbsp;until&nbsp;12 midnight.   Tuesday-&nbsp;Lets see i dont really remember what we did today but all i know is that we met up with my Dad's old roomy again for dinner and went to the Thai restaurant in some mall. The food was REALLY GOOD. I loved it soooooooooo much! We had like soft shelled crab and crab balls and some type of beef and veges. I just wish that the restaurant was somewhere in California instead of all the way in Hong Kong. Lets see..... hmm in think we went to the Night Markets again.....  Wednesday- We got up again and had dim sum for breakfast at a little place right across from our hotel. That was really good but the service was kinda bad and plus they were like out of a lot ot things. So after the good stuff we headed over to the museum of Hong Kong and saw a lot of the history of the area. We saw the ancient stuff to the modern day stuff like when Japan occupied Hong Kong to when Great Britian gave back Hong Kong to China in 1997. We took like 3 hours inside and then went to lunch to a place i dont remember and to dinner at a place i dont remember either. We also went to the night markets earlier b/c we had to get up earlier the next morning.  Thursday- Got up at 2 for some reason and looked outside only to see tons of people standing outside in front of the nightclub right next to our hotel. I was thinking...dang this is like Vegas, no one ever goes to sleep. So i went back to bed and got up at 4:30 to catch our bus ride back to the airport where we would arive like 2 hours later. We waited at the airport and had yummy noodles for breakfast. Then we hopped on the plane for a 4 hour ride over to Japan. We stayed there for like an hour so in that time i made the best out of my trip to Japan by walking on Japanese soil, drinking Japanese water out of the drinking fountain, and useing their restrooms. In the end we hopped on another plane to San Fran which lasted like 9 hours. So when we arrived i noticed that we had left at 9:30 AM on thursday and arrived at 9:30 AM on thursday, which i thought was kinda funny. SO we got back home, ate some lunch, and basically slept the whole day after.   Im finally done with this entry..... i hope i filled up the whole page. Now&nbsp;that i think&nbsp;of it and look at all i wrote, i dont really think so.&nbsp;

      Hey, lets see....today i went out and got my pay check from the funnel cake booth. I ended up getting $416.00 for working 2 weeks. I wish that the pay was a little more but its good experience for my future in whatever i do. SO after that i went to Fremont with my mom and bro to check out this Best SAT class for my bro to take. I also saw Kenny there so i gave him a quick wave from the other room. After, we ate lunch and then got a pearl drink from this one store but the one thing was.....none of them spoke english. So we stood there for like 20 minutes telling them what we ordered and what goes with what. SO finally after that long period of wasted life, i went to Frys and looked around for a while. Then we went to Ryan's house to help him with his computer problems and stuff like that. I had no clue what was going on so i sat there for an hour looking at the CCS year book. I did see some fimiliar faces in there and while i was looking through i wondered.....why cant our year book ever be this good? A while later i went home and watched the rest of the Home Run Derby. No, Barry Bondes did not win but he did have the most homeruns in the first round then anybody else. So after that i ate dinner and then did my chores. My bros taking his sr. pics tomorrow so i pray he takes a half decent one for his own sake. jkjkjk im out!

      Hey, i saw Spiderman on the 4th of July and had some of the family over for dinner. Spiderman was a good movie so i would highly recommend it to all you movie goers. Well lets see...looking ahead i have my church picnick and then im going to a reunion in San Fran. The reunion is for my mom's old church called SFBC, once part of the CBM chain, and its their 30-40 year reunion. haha i wouldnt know b/c i dont even go there. So i think that day ill dress up in the nice stuff. Then i go on vacation again and when i get back its...CBM camp! YOU KNOW IT! I cant wait to go, its going to be soooooooooooo fun especially since its my last year of jr. high camp.   Looking back....well this summer has been i guess pretty good. Im really busy with my job and now that i have been voted as vice president of SOS, im sure more fun schtuff will pop up that needs to be done. I wish i had more time this summer to start my eagle project and get atleast some of it done, but i find my so self so busy with other stuff that im way to lazy/tired to start anything.   Today.....was so boring. There was no one in line to buy funnel cakes so all day i just sat there trying not to look too bored. I was sooooooooooo glad once it was all over. Lets see what else to say....no one ever talks to me online anymore...o yeah and if you actually read these posts about my life then leave a comment b/c i would really appreciate it and also so i can see who reads it.   Prayers: -New building for my church -SOS -Great Aunt and Uncle -Uncle George from Canada -Time in general

      These last couple of days have been slow and really boring lately. For some reason ppl dont want funnel cakes. Ive also seen a total of 5 ppl i know at the fair and one of them was twice. So whats with this? Do ppl not like to go the fair during the summer or are ppl just coming when im not there? Well anyway if you plan to come, dont come on the 10th and only go to a funnel cake place owned by FUNNEL CAKE EXPRESS. Theres another place that sells them for a higher price and even though they have the same name as us, they're company name is Funnel cake West. The rest of this week i have no plans what so ever so if you want to do something with me or you want to hang out then give me a ring. AND make sure you call me if you plan to be at the fair anytime soon so i can see a fimiliar face.    LOOKING AHEAD....for my next post i  hope to have a pic of me and my family during our cruise in Mexico. Its very very interesting so i hope you enjoy it.  Prayers: -Church is looking for a building  -Brother's SATs -Dad's work -My eagle project -My Great Uncle -New SOS council -SOS youth group (new visitors)  P.S If you can pray for any of these things then that would be GREAT

      So i got back from CBM camp like a couple a days ago and it was GREAT. The first day we got in and got settled in our new (Not) cabin before dinner. I ended up sleeping on top of Kennys bunk so that was great that he got in my cabin. So we ate dinner and went to chapel to hear our first message. THe first message was on astronomy and the GLORY OF GOD but basically the whole week was on CREATION vs. evolution. The next day i woke up early, ate breakfast, took the workshop "I Think theres pgs missing in my BIBLE", and then went to chapel for a message on the origin of Life. For rec we had the tarp game which was a huge tarp with soap on it and the object was to try to restle ppl and get some balls worth points for our team. Lets see i think i spent time with my cuz, praise, sarah, and kenny after that but i forgot what happened after that. At night we saw the movie "The Ride" which was a really good message but the acting was sooooooooooooo corny. So blah blah blah happened until we get to Wednesday where i took the class again and then played cards for like 2 hours with praise and sarah. Thursday i took the classs "The Supremecy of Loving God" which was taught by one of my favorites, pastor steve louie. That was really fun schtuff and i think for rec that day we played a GIANT game of dodgeball..hmm or was that the day before? O well i cant remember.....so i finished off that day and then took the class on Friday and met up with Pastor Sen, the "GOD FATHER" of CBM ministry. Walked around with him and looked at the new cabins... o yeah we also got a chance to "chit chat". After we went to corporate worship and the message was on Dinos and facts about evolution/creation. And i know that on this day we played "Protect the President" where we had to huddle around a concelor and protect them from getting wet while ppl throw water balloons at us. O boy that was really fun.... So that was my final day of CBM camp for 2004 and it was a blast.  Interesting things i did at camp: 1. Played Hard Core Ping Pong 2. Picked up a full grown man for a pic. (Steve the Director, age-35) 3. Actually challenged a concelor at dueces and lost 4. Saw Kenny's concelor jump into kennys bed and get cuddled by him 5. Washed someones feet for devos 6. Played 15 games of foosball and never lost 7. Met some really NICE NEW councelors 8. Spent some good kinda quality time with friends 9. Learned A lot about GOD! 10. Sang WHo AM I as a praise song when its not actually suppose to be one 11. Got slapped on the butt by someone who wasnt my councelor 12. Was liked more by kennys councelor then kenny 13. Heard someone in my cabin fong pei like over a 1000 times while at camp 14. Saw praise drool over someone (im not telling who it is!)  PS. Ill put pics in once i develop my pics
