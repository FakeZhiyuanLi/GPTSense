      Somewhere Down The Road  We had the right love At the wrong time Guess I always knew inside I wouldn't have you for a long time  Those dreams of yours Are shining on distant shores And if they're calling you away  I have no right to make you stay  But somewhere down the road Our roads are gonna cross again It doesn't really matter when But somewhere down the road I know that heart of yours will come to see That you belong with me  Sometimes goodbyes are not forever It doesn't matter if you're gone I still believe in us together I understand more than you think I can You have to go out on your own So you can find your way back home  But somewhere down the road Our roads are gonna cross again It doesn't really matter when But somewhere down the road I know that heart of yours will come to see That you belong with me Letting go is just another way to say  I'll always love you so  We had the right love At the wrong time Maybe we've only just begun  Maybe the best is yet to come  Cause somewhere down the road Our roads are gonna cross again It doesn't really matter when But somewhere down the road I know that heart of yours will come to see That you belong with me

Well...i had many realizations during the retreat.   After my confession I kept on praying to God about my ex...i prayed that he will forgive me and talk to me and stuff like that...and it hit me! I'm love with him again! In love nanaman ako!!! and I was like OMG...di pwede!!!...i was the one who broke up with him and now i have feelings for him...again!? uhuhuhu...*sniff*   Anyweyz...after the retreat the whole class went to ATC and we had our picture taken!!! eheheheheh...we were like 35 in all...and we couldnt fit in the studio so the picture was taken outside of the store and after that...we all went to a sports place called Paeng's and went bowling and we also watched our classmates play billiards...and guess what!? my ex is really good at it...he beat them all! He's really good at it. =)  Yesterday...i saw him alone with a girl in the cafeteria...i didnt know if i was mad or jealous or something!!! But i was so upset coz the girl looked at me as if she was saying "akin siya!" Ako naman nagselos... tanga!

I was with my crush today! Whew...he's so cute...not to mention sooooo funny! he's the kind of guy you can chat with all day. Well, all day he's been sitting near me and kept on bugging me on telling him about my crush... Nyweyz...of course I didn't tell who it was and he became more intruiged...hahahaha!!! (*landi*)  And I also talked to this girl... she's a backbiter!!! I'll tell the story sometime.

      No More Tears...   I have no tears, left to cry  for a love that’s gone astray  the wells within my soul have dried  self-pities gone away.  Its time to live, and love again  to open up my heart,  to let new love enter in  a time for a new start!  No more wallowing in despair,  no wakeful nights to greet  for someone waits for me out there,  another love I'll meet.  One whose heart is just like mine,  hoping to find true love.  A love to last for all time,  blessed by God above.  To share the joys that life do hold,  let memories be borne.  And cuddle with when nights are cold,  come chilly winter morn.  There’s a freedom that I've found,  I've never felt before.  A weighted burden left me now;  it's gone forever more.  For, I have no more tears to cry,  for a love that’s gone astray.  I've let it go, I bid good-bye,  the pain ha s gone away!

      Many things happened in the past few days!   Like for instance, I cried in our classroom in the middle of our class!!! Waaaaahhh...embarassing!  Damn...its like this...  Paolo, my classmate asked me if i could be his partner in a project. I really wanted to but i already had a partner...so i declined his offer and he got offended! I don't know why...so he started backstabbing me and I heard some of them too...ang sakit...Grabe! And I was like "urgghhh!!! that hurts!!!" So I shouted at him and just said to stop and he just kept going on...blabbing and blabbing until I got fed up and cursed him...and then, I started to cry...like a baby.   The class discussion stopped!  And to make things worse all my classmates stared at me as Jessica (my close friend) comforted me...(Love you Jessica!!!) As if it wasnt enough, they started teasing my ex (who also happens to be my classmate) to comfort me!!! And he was like "Go to hell..." and after awhile almost all of my classmates hugged me and told me to stop crying...   Nyweyz...Paolo said sorry and were like close again...hehehehe!!!   *childish fights!*

      Di naman pala masyadong boring ang sem break!  Puro shopping pinaggagawa!  Anyway, the past few days I’ve been really down! I’ve been talking to Ian the past few days and he’s telling me so stupidly how happy he with that girl. Well…if he’s happy. And…I can’t do anything anyweys. I have no right na…hayyy…I think I’m going paranoid! I’m a hopeless romantic since we broke up…  Kaasar noh!?   Waaaahhh…I’m missing my friends! Especially Edward! He’s in his cousin’s house so we cant hang out or go to the mall. And he’s arriving at his house on the 3rd! That’s like 4 days more! Hayyy…I’ll be glad when this break is over. I get to see my friends again. And my crush (Bruce!).

      It soooo boring!  Edward’s out of town! He’s in La Union! (I’m so jealous! Think of all the beautiful white beaches there! *Daydream*) so that means I have no one to talk to on the phone! Except for Bim, Nic and Jessica…who are sometimes pretty boring to talk to!   I have nothing to write…wait! I’ll just tell you something about Edward!  Edward was my friend since 6th grade. Well, he's an ace student! He was Top1 of their class last quarter! Talk about paranoid! He doesn't even touch his books. I think his memory is sharp! He's sooooo talkative and very moody! Sungitttt!!! He's very tall, dark and handsome!!! He's 5 foot 6 inches, at least i think! Anddd...he likes Britney Spears! No kidding! He likes Britney's songs and moves! Hehehe...He's obssesed! Need I say more!?

      This day marks the start of our semester break.   *Whew*  Anyway, we had our final exams the past three days…I think I’ll get low on in English…but I think I’ll have a high grade on Trigonometry!!! Hehehe…Math wasn’t so bad! And how I hate Chemistry!!! I sucked big time…  Yesterday was a very fun and lively day for me. Saya!!!  We had our high school dance. Me and Edward (a good friend of mine) went there and danced all night.   There were bands from other schools. There was this band that played songs from Incubus. Well, they were really good! But some of the other bands really sucked!!! There was this male vocalist who sang shrilly but the girl vocalist sang well. Anyway…the band from our school was really good!!! Our batch mates played! They’re band is called “Hot Patataz” which means “Hot Potatoes.” Haha…I know! They’re band name sucks! But their vocalist really sang well…and they played good. They played Underground Music, which is really cooooool. Well, Edward and me danced the night away and kept on jumping and jumping!!! We were like drunk people…  My ex was there and so his girl. They were like together and sat so close they might as well make out. But they didn’t! Well, the nerve of them if they did!!! Thank God they did not!!! They did not even dance…how corny!!! Hehe…well…enough about them!   I really enjoyed the night and hope I can go again next year! =P

       How many times did I pray? You'd find me How many wishes on a star Gazing off into the dark Dreaming I'd see your face Safe at home unafraid Captured in your embrace  So many times When my heart was broken Visions of you Would keep me strong You were with me all along Guiding my every step You are all that I am And I'll never forget  It was you who first believed In all that I was made to be It was you looking in my eyes You held my hand And showed me life And I've never been the same Since you first believed  There were times When I thought I'd lost you Fearing forever was a dream But it wasn't what it seemed Placing your hand in mine You could see in the dark You were guiding my heart  It was you who first believed In all that I was made to be It was you looking in my eyes You held my hand And showed me life And I've never been the same Since you first believed  How many times did I pray? You'd find me How many wishes on a star   grabe sobrang sweet nang song na yan... hayyy kakainlove...  nakuha ko na card ko yesterday!!! waaaahhh!!! top 8 nalang ako. Kainis talaga sobra.

      Grabe na to… di na kaya ng powers ko!  Last Wednesday, we had our outreach. Me, Francis and Tetsuya were assigned to talk to a girl named Diane. We had a lot of fun naman. Kaya lang, after we had our lunch, the outreach facilitator went on an outrage. Hayyy…she is so terrible! She even called us ‘hypocrites!’ Ang kapal talaga ng mukha nun! Bwisit ever… Our adviser even cried in front of us kasi she can’t contain herself of remembering the things she had already said to us. She told us that the things the facilitator said, she had already told us. She said she’s so sad about the fact that all people who handle us or teach us always end up getting mad. She said we never learn. She said our class was always on about jokes. We were never serious daw. Haaayyy… all of us are child at heart kasi, well…most of us!  Nevertheless, it was still fun and full of laughter! We got our class picture today! We all looked good!!! Hehehe… Cuties kami lahat!!!  Anyways, two of our classmates were kicked out of school. We were all sad about it and terribly miss them. And there are also another two who were suspended for like a week to 2 weeks.   Yesterday nag-ballroom kami. Yun yung test namin. Wahahahaha!!!

      Grabe… its so traffic! I just came home from school and I have loads to do. Its not even homework! I have to cook!!! Waaaahhh…I’m not in the mood today but I’ll do it anyways.   We’ll have our outreach tomorrow.  Hayyy, we’ll go to this camp with poor outsiders. We have to eat with them and talk to them. I hope it’ll be fun! Hehe, coz last time we had an outreach it was so cool!!! We went to this home for the aged and talked to these grandmas and grandfathers. It was really fun…and Edward even got to host the show!  Anyways, binayaran na ko ni Ian… Pero 100 pa lang! Kuripot na kaya ngayon! Wahahahaha! We got to talk again this day.  Nagkulitan ulit kami ngayon nina Jess at Francis.   And si Nic!!! Ahahahahaha! Binigyan niya ko ng class picture ni Bruce last year!!! Wahaahhahaha…ang saya saya!!! =P  Edward was absent today! Sayang! Di nanaman kami magkikita tom! Miss him a lot! :( He was sick daw. He called me minutes ago. Kaya lang I was busy so I hang up na!   Well, I’ve been happy the past few days. I had already 2 Sabrina-free days! I haven’t seen her. Pero I think I caught a glimpse of her when I was walking in the High School hall. Hmmm…anyways, I don’t care pero I hope it will carry on. =P

      Classes started again today. I had a hard time waking up! My class is at 7 A.M. And I have to wake up by 5:30 because my school bus arrives at 6. So today I got to wear my school uniform. Yes, we do have school uniforms. Its because I study in a private school here. Lessons were very boring as usual. Chemistry sucked!!! And the worst part is we had double session in Chem.! So that meant being stuck with that boring teacher for 1 ½ hours!   Hay, magtatagalog na nga ako. Haha…medyo masaya ang araw na to. Nakausap ko siya…sino pa!? Eh di siya! =) Medyo nagtalo nga kami ngayon! Ayaw kasi magbayad ng utang! ‘Lang ya! Sabi nia ‘birthday gift’ ko na lang daw sa kanya! Tapos sabi ko ‘wag na! Binati naman kita!’ Tapos naalala ko sabi niya ililibre niya ako so, eh di sinabi ko yun! Tapos sabi ba naman, ‘bkt kaw din di mo ko nilibre nung birthday mo!’ Eh di sinagot ko siya! Sabi ko ‘Eh magkagalit tayo nun eh noh!’ Hay!!! Tawa nga ko ng tawa nun tapos sabi pa nga niya sakin na dami dami daw niya regalo sakin nung Christmas. Nung ‘kami’ pa! (Miss ko na yung mga araw na yun!) Tapos sabi ko, ‘bkt niregaluhan din naman kita eh!’ Tapos sabi nia ginagamit pa naman daw yun! Tapos yung book na binigay ko sa kanya tuluyan nang sinira nung baby sis niya. Hay…basta pagkatapos nun la lang…ngiti na lang kami.   Buong araw nagkukulitan kami nina Jessica at Francis! Ang kulet…hahahahaha! Para ngang di kami nagkita ng ilang buwan!  Tapos eto pa! Napanaginipan ko si Sab at Ian! Hahaha…nag-french kiss daw sa harap ko! Yuck…tapos yung suot nila yung sinuot nila nung dance…  Hayyy…napaparanoid na nga talaga ako! *Ngiti*

      I’ve just finished eating dinner! Yum! I ate Adobo. Haven’t I mentioned? I like cooking and eating. Ever since I was a kid, I was always in the kitchen.   I talked with Edward a while ago. We were both singing on the phone! Haha! Anyways, I’m so excited! I’m going to see him again tomorrow! I miss him so, so much!!!  I talked with Anne, my best friend also a while ago. She told me things about Hakone and Francis. You see, Hakone is her ex-boyfriend and Francis is her dream boy (haha!)  She told me Hakone confessed to her that he still loves her. Hayyy… =) I think they’re hooking up again! I dunno…I don’t like Hakone a lot. He’s a player! I think Anne still likes the idea of having Hakone as her boyfriend but then comes Francis! Who just broke up with his girlfriend Hae-ri (pronounced as “Hairy”…she’s Korean!) Talk about wrong timing! I mean… Anne has been waiting for that time for months! (Bad! Huh!?) Hmmm…I just wish what she’ll do will make her happy.   Whatever makes my best friend happy makes me happy… =P

      Bad Mood ako ngayon!  Puro utos! utos! utos and nanay ko...  Hmmm...I’ve been away from the house for 4 days and 3 nights. We went to Bulacan (our province), and visited the grave of our dead relatives. Well the stay was fun though. Almost all of my cousins, aunts, uncles and my grandmas were there.   Anyways, I miss school. (Weird huh!?)   I miss my friends.  And I really I miss him.  I’m getting paranoid, I think.   Well, at least Edward also thinks so. I keep on remembering thoughts and memories with him. I miss his spiky but oh-so-cute hair, his big brown eyes, his fair creamy white skin, his cute nose and his red luscious lips. I miss his hugs, his stares and our sweet kisses. *nyak! drama...*   Everyday I keep on dreaming about him. I always do. I keep on dreaming about the past! I also dream about what could have happened if we were still a couple. I hate it when I remember him. It’s like torture kasi I hate it when I remember that I always felt warm and secured whenever he’s around and especially when he hugs me!!! Damn, I miss those hugs…*sigh*  (*wake up! kareen...daydream ka na naman!*)

      Someone once said...   Girls are like apples on trees. The best ones are at the top of the tree.  The boys dont want to reach for the good ones coz they are afraid of falling and getting hurt.  Instead they just get the rotten apples that are on the ground, that aren't as good, but easy.  So the apples at the top think that there is something wrong with them, when  in reality they are amazing.  That is why we have to be a little patient and the right guy, one who takes  a chance to find the good, right apple. He will come someday...    isn't that cute? hehehe. i got this...errrr. poem!? ah. whatever from some site.

It's the way you love me, it's a feelin' like this. It's centrifugal motion, it's perpetual bliss. It's that pivotal moment. It's 'Ah, subliminal.' This kiss, this kiss. It's criminal. This kiss, this kiss.  It's the way you love me baby, it's the way you love me darling, yeah.  It's the way you love me, it's feelin' like this. It's centrifugal motion, it's perpetual bliss.

I've been quite tidy and neat this vacation and pagdating na pagdating ko sa school sa Tuesday, the first thing i'll do besides greet people is to clean my locker!!! hayy. the start of the year wasn't good for me kasi i had fights with either my mom, dad, brother and big sister... urggghhh!!! they're so unfair kasi... kasi sa family namin i'm the least liked. I know the reason naman kasi, i'm really  maldita  naman kasi. totoo yun pero i'm like this because of them. hayyy. kasi naman both my dad and mom are perfectionists. they dont like to admit na they make mistakes - they dont admit na sometimes i know more things than them. atsaka...mom's so paranoid. feeling niya  drug addict ako!!! bwisist...i can take care of my self naman noh!!! sometimes I act like a kid pero with things like that, i can deal with it noh. no biggie! i can stand up on my own!!! hay! si ate naman nakakaasar ang copycat...loser kasi. ang sama ko noh. pero thats the way I feel. pero things have been improving between me and Michael. siguro because of the fact that he's growing up na and he can understand things I do believe in! medyo kakampi ko na yun!!! eh lakwatsero narin yun eh. buti nalang si dj walang imik. nasa tabi tabi lang...  i cant wait to go to school. pero nakakainis I have to wake up early nanaman!!!

We really cooperated a lot during our CVE time but during our guidance time... pwem.pwem.pwem. wala na. hehehe.  downloading "mesmerize" now. gosh. i really love this song. it reminds me of something... hahaha. anyways, i also like the song cause of the video. ewan kasi... uhmmm. how should i say this. uhmmm. i know somebody's reading this by now but... sige na nga. eh kasi it reminds me of you know. haha. *wink* =P ayyy grabe. kinikilig ako ngayon. di ko alam kung bakit. lalo na pag nakikita ko yung vid... ahhhhhhh!!! kasi yung stare ni ja rule. its just like his. ooohhh... hahaha. i just  melt  when he stares at me. i really love his stare. i hate to say this pero... when he stares kasi parang he's  sooo  into you. and then on the video, i'm like ashanti... you know. like, i'll do anything for my man.   i'm getting so mushy again. i hate being mushy.  i'm so good at it .   Girl your stare those eyes  I Love it when you look at me baby  Your lips, your smile  I Love it when you kiss me baby  Your hips those thighs  I Love it when you thug me baby  And I can't deny  I Love it when I'm with you baby

      today was really fun. =P  i started really early this day waking up at 730 AM. me, carlsol and francis were  supposed  to meet at the big Mcdonald's at 9 AM. but it turned that they both woke up  late . sheeesh. thankfully, i left the house at 9. about 10 minutes later, carlsol arrived and was soon followed by francis. we were really supposed to take a bus... but it turned out that francis brought along his driver. hahaha. he's such a  rich  kid. we arrived at aldwin's place after 30 minutes. jessica also came just  5 seconds ahead  of us. =)   we started recording our jingle for our long test 2 in our pa class. our jingle was kinda  jologs  and  corny ... but  really  funny. haha. we adapted the tune of "shalalala," "binibini," the enchanted kingdom theme and we just changed the words. ewww... you may say pero haha. it sure is funny.   the process of our recording was really fun. haha. i kept on recording my groupmate's discussions by secret. haha. we kept on laughing after we heard all of them. and after that, they stole away the recorder from me and hid it.  naloloka  na daw ako.   by 1230 midafternoon, francis' mom called and told him to go home already. we decided to eat altogether as a group first then let francis go. we had pizza and sinigang. hehe. our discussion in the dining table was really funny. we kept on telling stoies about out family.  after a while, we recorded our jingles again and went to gracie's house. aldwin's sister gave us a lift. =) we had a snack (quesodillas... yum!) and chatted a while. we took a quick glance at their website. it's www.jabibot.cjb.net. then we played gran turismo on gracie's ps2. after a while, we chatted again and i took a  quick  nap on gracie's bed. after a few seconds of dozing off, i immedietly felt instant pain. arrrggghhh!!!  aldwin was on top of me . aaahhh. i kept on pushing him away from me. hahaha. i was suffocating. he was so heavy. and then  jessica also jumped on top of me ... damn. they were heavy. hahaha. it was already 5 PM when i decided to go home. i took a bus with carlsol. i arrived at home by 6 PM. hehehe. traffic.   i was really supposed to go to nic's house. they have some sort of "inuman session" there. kaya lang i didn't want to leave carlsol on the bus so... di na ko pumunta. sorry nic. :( have fun anyways.

      I have a  terrible  case of allergies today. I keep on sneezing... all day long. =(  Anyways, my  single  status did not stop me from having fun this day. I was so  hyper  today and i kept on laughing and laughing... all day long.   In our pa class, we had this activity. it was so much fun. Hehe. Ms. Loveria asked us to write all the names of the students in our class in a piece of paper. Then, beside each name, we have to write if we consider that person a friend, an enemy, a crush, a loved one or a not so close friend. Haha. Guess what i wrote beside ian’s name? Hehe.  I wrote a big letter “x” and then i drew a big heart.  O dba!?  Ex-love . Hahaha. Ms. Loveria was really cracking up when she saw my paper. Hehe.  Chemistry class was  called off  and we were so happy... hahaha. A day without ms. Monzon. Heaven pare... anyways, we had this boring orientation about the PAASCU visit. Duh!?  Me, anne, edward and nic went to atc today. Too bad eia wasn’t there. We had a snack at KFC, played at timezone, ate again at starbucks and walked around the mall. It was fun, really. I got home by 730 PM. I went looking for a prom dress. Grabe, walang makita.  Na-wipe  out na ang buong town. My gas... panu na yun!? And sa glorietta daw, la naring clothes. Pati sa rockwell. Sana i can go to robinsons ermita... daming clothes dun eh.   Anyways, tomorrow we’ll go to aldwin’s place and do out project in pa. We have to record a  jingle .  Arte  ng teacher noh. Kaasar. Anyways, we have lots of ideas na and next saturday, we’ll go to carlsol’s place and shoot a commercial. Ooohhh. That’s gonna cost a lot. Hayyy. Ms. Loveria kasi... so anu nga ba tawag dun... ummm. Basta don’t remember the word. Basta it means “not practical.”   happy valentines to all. =)

See, the heart that you helped to mend Was broken by a friend Your kind, kind words I'm sorry but they're hurting me Love letters that I've never sent Hidden from your eyes again You never seem to notice But to others it's so plain to see Now it's time to tell the truth I wish I could, baby, say that I love you  Chorus: When you're in love with someone Dreaming of a tender touch Yeah, I love you so much To be friends is not enough When you're in love with someone (When you're in love with someone) I don't know what to do Describe that someone... Is you ( I hope you don't, hope you don't change a thing) ( I hope you don't, hope you don't change a thing)  My emotions cover me Like a ship lost at sea I'm waiting for the one who will fill my destiny In my mind you undress I touch you with tenderness I open up my eyes, I can't believe you're right in front of me I can feel that you see my pain Then you say with a smile That you feel the same  Chorus  Ooooh... When you're in love with someone Dreaming of a tender touch Yeah, I love you so much To be friends is not enough When you're in love with someone I don't know what to do Cause that someone is you I hope it don't change a thing

      valentines is just hours away from the philippines. gosh... =)  anyways, the prom is just 2 weeks (i think) away and still... i have nothing to wear. i was thinking of a spagetti-strapped dress but i think its too common. i want something unique and something... color red. hahaha. yeah. that's my fave color. but the thing is i can't wear red cause my grandma just died a week ago. and customs require not wearing anything red for "40" days. damn. hmmm. hope i'll find something this weekend.   we had our pe class just hours ago. it was so much fun. we played softball. we only did catching and throwing so... it was just a piece of cake. me and jessica had so much fun (she was my partner).   i had fun during our extension class. it was sir dameg's (history teacher) birthday and he was sooo funny today. =) sooo... what else!? hmmm. i came in late this morning because our driver "woke up late."  how lame can you get?  sheeesh.   anyways, ian went home riding in our school bus. it was really embarassing because my busmates know our "public displayed history." haha. =) yeah. he was part of my  history . anyways, i can't help but look at him. i like his new hairdo. haha. its been three straight days and still... i'm talking about his ever-cute hair. i dunno... but i just really like his new hairdo. he looks sooo... formal. sophisticated (haha) and even more handsome. hahahahahaha. i can't believe i've just said that!!! ooohhh... i can't get over his hair. ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...   change topic: i've been really sad the past few days and i know the reason. i have a problem with my  friend , actually. i'm really starting to  hate  him and now, were really far, far, far away from each other. not literally far... you know. we're not that close anymore. yeah. i'm really starting to hate him. sometimes, i even feel  disguted  with him. i'm such a meanie. i dunno. i just can't tell him what i feel... cause i know he'll freak out and get cold with me. hah... decisions. decisions. decisions.  i haven't really decided on what to give ian for the prom. *ehem* i'm not talking bout ian, ian. i'm talking bout "ian jose," my prom partner... or should i say "date?" haha. (dream on!) all i know about him is that he's intelligent, a top student, mind you and a computer genius. hmmm... maybe i'll just get him an internet card (haha) or a computer software. hmmm. i dunno... i'll think about it some time later nalang. and. i noticed. many people  actually  have a crush on my partner. hmmm. he's cute daw. =P

(kasi natatakot ako na baka yung mga studyante ko, eh katulad ko rin! hihi =P) so my last resort, being a chef. well, actually... its not really my last resort but i really love cooking. and i believe  i should study something that i like to do  (naks! pang ms. universe na ba!?)  just yesterday, i read anya's blog (hi anya c",)). she said she wanted to take up  international studies . hahaha. la lang... kasi my mom told me that once she took up an international studies college entrance test. parang pang masteral something niya... tapos.  wala  daw siya na-answer kasi ang nakasulat sa test paper: "explain why blah.blah.blah... in a language you know besides English and Tagalog ." damn.  well, good luck anyways anya!

(i only weighed 92 lbs last thursday! damn. that fast.) i only spent 100at day. they all paid for what i ate. waaahhh... i just dont know why. hmmm.   i was supposed to attend msa classes yesterday kaya lang i decided to take the second batch instead (which starts on April 21). katamad kasi... besides i'll be taking cooking class again.  hay. kung  ano-ano  pinagsusulat ko sa blog ko. lang ka-konek konek. i just cant concentrate. i'm outta here. =P

         You have a surprise kiss! Your partner is always pleasantly pleased to have you jump outta no where to dote them with a fun peck on the cheek or more passionate embrace. super markets and work places are your favorite places to attack your loved one with all your love =p    urlLink   What kind of kiss are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     i saw anya's blog. and it was full of results from quizzes. hehehehe. envy me... ako din!!! hehehehe... hmmm. maybe this result is kinda true...!? hmmm. =)

       HARDEST THINGs IN LOVE  (here i go again...)  a.. Being questioned when you yourself don't understand  b.. Pretending to be innocent of what you know about  c.. Trying to show you care  d.. Trying to forget something you know you NEVER will  e.. Admitting you were wrong after you have been so insistent that you were right  f.. Accepting the fact that you made a MISTAKE  g.. Debating with yourself  h.. Knowing what's wrong and what's right  i.. Growing up  j.. ACCEPTING the fact that some things are NOT meant TO BE  k.. Trying to understand when you just can't  l.. Swallowing your pride when it has become TOO HARD and TOO BIG to even gulp it down with water  m.. Being the LAST TO KNOW about something ! that CONCERNS you most of all  n.. Realizing that you have been TRICKED after you have given your WHOLE TRUST  o.. Realizing that you have taken the most IMPORTANT thing for granted!  p.. PARTING with someone you've just LEARNED to LOVE  q.. Letting GO of someone you've LOVED ALL YOUR LIFE  r.. Losing someone you care deeply about  s.. Saying sorry when you mean it  t.. Saying how you REALLY FEEL and Explaining WHERE YOU STAND  u.. Knowing what is best and yet doing the exact opposite.  v.. Bracing yourself for the worst kind of pain... & still hturting so much.  w.. Loving someone too much and learning to love the pain that goes with it... that even if you learned to let go of the person... you still go on missing the pain you once felt (and there it goes again... you fall again)  x.. Denying to yourself that you're falling... then finally you realize that indeed you have fallen when it's too damn late and you cant get out  y.. Being with someone else when the right one comes along  z.. Knowing deep inside that you love someone yet you can't say it out loud

      i talked with anne just minutes ago. she's grounded and she told me to text francis and tell him about it.  that just sucks anne!!! summer pa naman. =P ano nanamang kalokohan yan!? anyways, your going to palawan!? hehehe. dont forget my pasalubong!!!    anyways, on with my hopelessly romantic life.   hmmm. i  kinda  woke up early this morning cause i attended my " virtues " class! hehehe. i might not be the type of person who appreciates this kind of class... but i do actually. =P its kinda fun and very educational. in fact, i really,really, really get in touch with my faith in God through this class. today, we talked about  cheerfulness . that's the virtue of the week. hehehe. =P i really like this week's value cause i kinda can relate and can apply it. im really cheerful in the first place. hehehehe. hmmm. ms vissia (my mentor) told me and my "values" class classmates that   cheerfulness is forgetting about yourself and thinking about others  .   its being optimistic and not being pesimistic  .   being selfish is not being cheerful  . she said that   pride is the root of sadness  , the opposite of cheerfulness (obviously!!! =P). she said that   we are much more tempted by evil if we are sad  ...   kasi when we're sad we almost blame anything or everyone for anything thats happening around (whether its good or bad).    after that, i attended my cooking class. actually, i didnt really enjoy my cooking class today cause i really feel bloated and queasy. my  period  is the root of this feeling im feeling. waaahhh!!! i could hardly walk. well, anyways. today we made some... hmmm. kebabs. chicken kebabs to be exact. some beef stroganoff and rice pillaf. i really liked the rice pillaf. its so rich and creamy. yum! yum! yum!!! after that, i stayed a while in Narra. me, maggi, doreen and kat just  chilled out  there and  sang some  nursery rhymes  ... hehehe. =P we were laughing our asses off!!! =P hehehe. so all morning, 9AM to 130 PM, i just stayed at the Narra Club. hay. its really fun there and i dont regret joining the club.      hmmm. what else!? i did nothing else today anyways... so i'll get going. until my next blog.

      What hurts... (i recieved this email from she... and i uhhh. decided to post it up here and the words inside the parentheses are my opinons, et al, etc)  ::  letting go of a person u've just learned to love  (shucks. i hate this)  ::  reminiscing the good times u shared together  (damn! this hurts)  :: shielding ur heart to love somebody  :: trying to hide what u really feel  ::  trying to hide the tears that involuntarily fall from your eyes loving a person too much  (and not realizing you're being dumb!!! cause he's really not worth it)  ::  giving up someone u never thought of giving up  (omg! i did this)  ::  having the right love at the wrong time  (*snifff* we had the right love at the wrong time... somewhere down the road)  ::  taking the risk to fall in love again  (ahhh!!! cause you're too in love with the person!)  :: hiding ur relationship from someone else  :: controlling ur feelings to avoid hurting a friend  ::  thinking of her every waking and sleeping moment knowing all the while that he never even thinks a single thought of you...  (omg. *snifff* this hurts)  :: letting go, because everytime you see the person, you only fall deeper  :: holding back only to find out when it's too late, you both felt the same way, but were only scared to lose each other so much that you didn't let the feelings out  ::  falling inlove with someone you didnt mean to fall inlove with  (he was a childhood friend! didnt you know?)  :: finding the perfect guy...with only one problem... she doesnt love you...  :: helping the one you love court your friend (oh no!!! but this hasnt happened to me yet. thank god)  :: seeing the one you love crying for someone else   ::  the waiting also hurts like hell  (sure does!!! arggghhh. you wait until finally... your insane and he doesnt care)  ::  having to hear "... I've met someone"  (that girl...)  :: agreeing to her wish to 'just be friends'.  :: asking his freedom back bcoz 'he'd be happier with him'  ::  asking u to 'forget that everything happened' and be 'normal' friends again.  (really is hard to do)  :: hearing that u're treated as a big sis (ouch!)  :: sharing his future plans for the girl with you.  :: u stopped being friends bcoz her gf asked her to.  :: being denied in front of people.  ::  telling u lies where he'd been when actually, he was with a 'new friend' or an 'old flame' (whew!)  (oh damn. i also hate this one!)  :: he told u he'd be leaving u to return to his ex (d one he left 4 u!)  ::  breaking someone's heart  (i was so mean then...)  ::  fighting for that one thing that would make you happy  (the sad thing is i only fought with that one thing in my head/mind)   ::  that is, holding on to a person who can not guarantee you his/her commitment unless he/she fixed himself/herself...then, you are left hanging for the moment...then he/she says, time will tell... but you still decided to hope in him/her and trust him/her  (totally relate right now)  ::  PRETENDING you're OK when inside you're dying...  (actually, im dying right now)  ::  PRETENDING to be strong.... and RECOGNIZING your weakness  (weakness: guys with big eyes and fair skin)  :: lying in bed each night, thinking of that special person you can never have...  :: being with someone you can't actually love...  :: pretending you don't love a person whom you actually love...  ::  being in love...  (comes with the package)  ::  letting go even if you really don't want to... having no right to say you are hurting, because it was your decision  (last summer... waaahhh!!!)  :: seeing the person you love hurt because of you... and not being able to help that person...  :: having the courage to say I LOVE YOU to the person you love and finding out afterwards that things will never be the same again when he/she doesnt treat you with the same closeness as before  ::  having to face the fact that someone is capable of completely destroying the wall that you have set for yourself, leaving you weak and vulnerable  (as a matter of fact, that "someone" is the person im falling for)  ::  finding out that the more you try to hate her/him, the more you end up loving her/him, perhaps even more than before...  (aaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!! i cant take this anymore!!! why am i even posting this stuff!?)   ::  realizing how stupid your mistakes were that led to your break-up.  (dumb! dumb! dumb!)  :: Sharing the one you love with SOMEBODY else....."  ::  making a promise....and realizing that when the time has come for that promise to be delivered....the commitment is no longer there...  (why do these things happen!? hello... reality check!!! exaggg na to... waaahhh!!!)  :: the hardest thing about love - believing it exists.  everyone thinks we're the perfect couple, everyone says we're meant for each other. i never believed them till i fell for you, but then you said...:"No, we're just good friends.." =(

      why do i feel that i can really relate to this song!? hmmm. maybe because i really can.   If you're not the one then why does my soul feel glad today? If you're not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way? If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call? If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all?  I never know what the future brings But I know you're here with me now We'll make it through And I hope you are the one I share my life with...  I don't wanna run away but I can't take it, I don't understand If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am? Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?  If I don't need you then why am I crying on my bed? If I don't need you then why does your name resound in my head? If you're not for me then why does this distance name my life? If you're not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife?   I don't know why you're so far away But I know that this much is true We'll make it through And I hope you are the one I share my life with And I wish that you could be the one I die with And I pray in you're the one I build my home with I hope I love you all my life   I don't wanna run away but I can't take it, I don't understand If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am? Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?  'Cause I miss you, body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today 'Cause I love you, whether it's wrong or right And though I can't be with you tonight You know my heart is by your side  I don't wanna run away but I can't take it, I don’t understand If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am? Is there any way I can stay in your arms?

       reality bites.   ive just realized that moments ago. just last night, i was  freaking  out in my bedroom. totally day  dreaming  and  imagining  things out. yeah...  he's the reason . i just cant take it anymore. emotions are really flowing out of my mind, my heart and my eyes. =,(   he hasnt called for a  week . i think he  might  even forget my birthday (its on monday, april 7). i swear to myself, if he freakin forgets my bday... i dont know what'll just happen to me!!!   my summers are always  cursed  - we  broke up  last year summer. and *take note,* it was my  birthday  then!!! i dunno. maybe he's not that commited to me. cause if he is, he'll find a way to see or talk to me... no matter what! i hate my self for being so dumb and foolish when it comes to love. like last year. when we broke up, i swore to myself that i'll never  ever  go steady with him again. but no!!! arggghhh!!! im his girlfriend yet  again .   i freaking hate myself for being so smitten to him!    anne and jessica think and just tells me that maybe... just maybe, he has a reason why he isnt calling. maybe, yes. maybe no.but dom tells me that  i should do something . like talk to him or something. but damn... this has happened before. just weeks ago. the second time around is just enough. hay... i remember the quote i read somewhere tuloy -   "shame on him if he fooled you once, but shame on you if he fooled you twice!"   hay. words of wisdom. =P and then dom told me that i should just keep my cool and just  follow my heart . like if i feel like breaking up with him, i should break up with him. but hell no!!! i dont want to... he's the one i love!!! omg. getting dramatic again. but hell, i dont care!!! this is what i feel.   ooohhh.  the pain.  why do they call the highschool years the best one!?   i just wish he would call or show up on monday. if he does... i dunno, maybe i'll kick his ass first then i'll forgive him. =P hehehe. im just so... foolish. hehehehe. i remember the song "foolish" nanaman. this was my theme song last year eh. nung heart broken ako.   see my days are cold without you but im hurting while im with you and though my heart cant take no more i keep on running back to you   ...see when i get the strenght to leave you you always tell me that you need me and im weak cause i believe you and im mad because i love you so i stop and think that maybe you could learn to appreciate me but it all remains the same that...    you aint never gonna change!!!     i really wanna kick ian's ass!!!  arggghhhhhhhhhhhhh!!! and at the same time, i wanna   hug   him cause i really miss him. i really do. omg. tears are really flowing down my cheeks right now. i just hope that no matter what... he has a reasonable reason why he's not calling.    i just wanna hear him say "im still here" that's all im asking... =(

        depression, bitterness and pain always comes after a breakup. it comes with the territory. part of loving is the fact that you WILL get hurt. but after all the pain has been dealt with, it makes you grow as a person. what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. don't stress, life is too short for that. learn from the past, and use what you learn to help your future decisions. don't dwell on the past, or else you'll be stuck there.. you've got your whole life in front of you, live it to the fullest.   enjoy life ayt? its too short to be wasted.  tc    someone just emailed me this whole thingy. who the hell!? his email add is ganjabroni sumthin... oh men. somebody is totally hunting me. i just hate it. and it was really specially emailed to me... only.  days to go till our dry-run in MSA. it sucks... i have so much homework. still to do... arghhhhhhhhhhh!!! =(  yeah, 1-0 for the  DALLAS MAVERICKS ... ahahahahahahahahahahahahahaaa. dallas rocksss!!! hope they make it in the finals. =P

Let me be the one to break it up so you won't have to make excuses We don't need to find a set up where someone wins and someone loses We just have to say our love was true but has now become a lie So I’m telling you I love you one last time and goodbye   -let me be the one    I never felt this way How do you give me so much pleasure? And cause me so much pain Just when I think I've taken more than would a fool I start fallin’ back in love with you I keep on fallin’ In and out of love with you I never loved someone The way that I love you   -fallin'    And I try so hard just to figure him out, But he won't tell me what he's been thinking about, And then he falls asleep on the living room couch, With his sunglasses on and his tongue hanging out, And then he disappears for a week at a time, And then he shows up just like everything's fine, And I don't get what goes on in his mind, But I'm tired of hearing the same stupid lines   -pretend to be nice    I had my feet on solid ground Was doing fine till you came back around Boy, All your promises are lies, No I don't know why, why I waste my time Somebody take the pain away It's hurting my heart and I can't take it Somebody take the pain away Get out of my life or I'll go crazy Crazy, crazy.... You wouldn't give me back my life Taking the wrongs and trying to make e'm right, right You're too pathetic for my love You played your game and boy I had enough of you Messing with my head All the things you said Running back to me Telling me your dream I never wanted it to be this way 'Cause it's killing me Gotta set you free....   -somebody take the pain away    Put away the pictures Put away the memories I’ve poured over and over Through my tears  I’ve held them till I’m blind They kept my hope alive As if somehow that might keep you here Once you believed in a love forever more How do you leave it in a drawer?      Now here it comes The hardest part of all Unchain my heart that’s holding on How do I start to live my life alone? Guess I’m just learning Learning the art of letting go   -the art of letting go  hmmm. dami no!? anyways, i really do want to let go. but biglang sisingit naman to...    I still think about you I still dream about you I still want you, and need you by my side I'm still mad about you All I ever wanted was you You're still the one You're still the one   -still  ooohhh. life's so complicated...

      Why I Wont Forget My First Love  my first time to have a crush was totally unforgettable. likewise, each time i recall the first time i got kissed, i never fail to smile. and whenever i call to mind the first moment i loved, i never fail to let a tear fall down my cheek.  love made me levitate as if i were in heaven. love made me laugh endlessly. love made me smile.   love did make my world go round.  but in a world where nothing is perfect, love also had a glitch. and through my past, i discovered it – love can also make my world turn upside down.  i guess i had the wrong impression about love. it’s not all about happiness… it’s also about making sacrifices.   and it did happen. my world crashed. he fell out of love. i fell out of love. we both fell out of love. we were both lost.  10 minutes till my birthday, i was crying like a baby. we had enough of each other and i’ve finally decided to break up our child-like relationship.   to wrap up... love hurt me bad.   (yah i know... wrong grammar. la lang... i just feel na "love hurt me bad" has more dating than "love hurt me badly" eh. hehehe. so bear with me people...)  (dont get my point? fine!!! now scram and go get a clue...)

      ay naku. umiral nanaman ang pagka-sexist ng mga tao... read on peeps. =P  Ang Mga Babae Nga Naman Talaga    Musta na, pare? Ako, okay lang. Eto. Nagmumuni-muni. Nag-iisip. Minsan talaga may mga bagay na hindi ko maintindihan. Ewan ko ba.     Bakit ba ganun pare, ilang beses ko na pinag-aralan pero lagi na lang lumalabas na parang kahit 'sang anggulo mo tingnan, hindi nagiging patas para sa mga lalake ang ilang bagay pagdating sa pagmamahal.    Minsan naiisip ko, alam kaya ng mga babae ang hirap ng lalake na gumawa ng first move para magtapat ng pagmamahal? E yung hirap na dinadaanan sa panliligaw at pagsuyo sa mahal nya? Ang feeling ng masaktan pag nabasted? Malamang-lamang siguro, hindi ano. Wala naman yata silang alam sa mga paghihirap naten e. Ang alam lang ata nila e mamili, manakit, at magsaya. Tingin mo?   Lagi naman ganun. Una pa lang, lalake na ang naghihirap. Hassle saten ang panliligaw pero bago pa yun, kung ano pang diskarte ang gagawin naten para masabi naten sa kanila na mahal natin sila. Alam kaya nila yun? Mahirap magsabi na mahal mo na yung babae, diba? Tapos liligawan pa naten. Patutunayan na mahal nga sila. Susuyuin to-the-max. Maghahatid sa bahay, tutulungan, sasabayan, palalamunin, pagtyatyagaan, lahat na. Kulang na lang e pagsilbihan mo nang walang sahod. At ano ang kapalit? Well, depende sa trip nila. Oo tol, sa trip lang nila. Wala silang pake kesehodang mahal natin talaga sila. Basta ang alam nila, pag di nila tayo trip, isang malaking Hindi ang makukuha naten, kahit umiyak pa tayo ng dugo o lumuhod sa mga asing buu-buo. Para lang silang namimili ng damit na di man lang sinusukat bago ayawan. Kaya kahit mahal na mahal na mahal na mahal natin, sorry tayo. Hindi nila alam kung mahal mo sila. Kailangan mong maabot ang kanilang mga standards o uuwi ka lang na bad trip, iiling-iling, at minsan, luhaan.    Wala tayong magagawa, marami silang alibi.   "Hindi pa 'ko ready eh..",  "Sorry pero I think we should just be friends.." "Ha? Uhhmm.. nagpapatawa ka ba? Hahahaha.."  "Better luck next time na lang muna, okay lang?" "Give me a decade. Pag-iisipan ko muna.." "Para lang kitang kapatid e.."  yaddah yaddah. Isang malaking pagsasaklob ng langit at lupa 'yon para saten.   At hindi lang 'yon tol. Sa pre-relationship stage pa lang yon. Pag sinagot na nila tayo, satin pa rin ang hassle. Tayo daw ang mga lalake kaya tayo ang hahawak ng relasyon. Tayo ang aayos kung may gulo; tayo ang dapat magpapakabait; tayo ang magtatyaga; tayo ang magiging devoted at faithful; tayo, tayo tayo.    Sila? Ummm? Teka, isipin ko.    Ayun. Sila ang magsasabi kung anong oras kayo dapat magmeet; sila ang magtetext ng mga mushy at kabalbalang texts; sila ang magdedemand sayo ng kung anu-ano; sila ang magbabawal; sila ang magsasabi kung kelan ka dapat mag-shave, kung kelan ka pwedeng tumawag sa bahay nila, kung kelan sila di dapat bad tripin dahil meron sila, at kung  kelan ka korni. Ewan. Ganun ata talaga.   Hindi pa yun tapos pare, dahil dapat tayo ang bahala kung ano ang magiging takbo ng relasyon. Pag maganda, edi okay. Pag may problema, kasalanan naten. Haay buhay. Minsan talag a kung tutuusin sakit sila  ng ulo. Kaya lang mahal naten kaya di na natin iniintindi yun.   Pero alam mo tol, feeling ko mas sincere pa tayo magmahal sa kanila. Alam mo yun, iba tayo magmahal e. Hindi lang parang laru-laro lang. Seryoso. At kung magmahal man tayo, lubus-lubusan. Mas mature. Hindi yung parang pambata lang gaya nila na kesyo magseselos-selos, iiyak-iyak, iina-inarte, dadradrama, at kung anu-ano pa. Hindi lang kababawan. Ka-mushyhan. Kababaihan. Iba tayo pag nagmahal.   At ito pa ang pinakamasaklap.    Ang ending ng relasyon. Sa mga panahon g 'to, either sawa na sila, hindi na tayo trip, may nahanap na silang better saten, o kaya they need f*cking space and time muna. Bad trip no? Wala na naman tayong choice. Sila ang masusunod.   At ano pa ang kasamang hassle don? Syempre wasak na ang imahe naten. Tayo ang lalabas na may kasalanan. Na playboy. Na nagpapaiyak.   Tayo siyempre ang mga antagonist at sila yung mga bidang inaapi at parang mga pusang iiyak-iyak. Ang ending: mag-ooffer sila ng "friendship" kuno matapos tayong pagsawaan, lahat ng gifts naten nasa  kanila, sawi tayo sa pag-ibig, "player" na ang image naten, at higit sa lahat, mag-iisip kung papaano ipagpapatuloy ang buhay. Maiiwan tayong tulala, mag-iisip kung saan nagkamali, mamomroblema sa pag-aadjust sa pagiging single, at di na naman makakatulog.   Haay buhay. Ang hirap maging lalake. Lagi ka na lang naiiwan sa ere. Ano? Hindi ka na nagsalita? In-love ka no?   Ang mga babae talaga, oo.    siempre... ndi magpapatalo ang mga girls nohhh!!!  Ang Mga Lalake Talaga, oo    Ano ba tong mga lalakeng to no?  Kaming mga babae na naman ang nakita. Lalake, agrabyado. Lalake, kinakawawa. Lalake, hindi maintindihan. Hmmp, paran g masyado yatang nagisa ang mga kabaro ko.   Tungkol sa pagiging patas sa ngalan ng pag-ibig, kami naman ang  laging talo a, hindi kayo. Kami ang laging lugi, kami ang laging  nawawalan at iniiwan.   Kapag ngumiti ka na ng konti, nag-ayos ng konti pagkakamalan ka nang malandi. Hindi pangseryosohang relasyon. Marinig lang nila na malakas kang magsalita, palengkera ka na. T.O. kagad sa kanila iyon. Mahilig silang tumingin sa mga babaeng sexy manamit, kulang nalang makita na kaluluwa. Pero kapag babaeng seryosohin at gustong ligawan dapat disente, dapat mala-anghel ang mukha, dapat mukhang inosente. Tapos kami pa raw ang mahilig mamili? Parang baliktad yata?   Ok, ayan nanliligaw n a si lalake. Dapat pakipot ka para suyuin ka, para habulin ka pa lalo. Kapag hindi ka naman nagpakipot "easy to get" naman ang tingin sa iyo. Hindi ka na seseryosohin. Sino bang may sabing magpaalila kayo, di naman namin hawak ang buhay niyo. Natural lang na magtiis kayo, may gusto kayo sa amin eh. Kapag nakuha niyo na iyon wala na lahat ng mga paghihirap niyo, babaliktad na ang sitwasyon kami naman ang mamromroblema. Para lang kayong may gustong bilhin na bagay. Upang mabili ito kailangan munang magsakripisyo,  magtipid, magtiis. Pag nabili na at napagsawaan wala na, balewala na. Diyan ka na sa tabi-tabi. Tawagan nalang kita pag trip ko o kaya'y pag may gusto akong ipagawa sa iyo.   Ano pa ba? E di sinagot mo na diba. Utang naloob pa natin yun. Dahil naghirap daw sila sa panliligaw dapat masuklian natin iyon ng higit pa. Sa umpisa kailangan malambing ka, maayos at laging magsisilbi sa kanya. Ayaw daw nilang humawak ng relasyon, pero kapag ikaw naman ang nagmando, aba, masasakal naman. Sasabihin pa sa iyo "demanding" ka.  Meron ka pang maririnig na "I think we need space" at kung anu-ano  pang ek-ek. Sino rin may sabing di dapat kami magpakabait, maging  devoted at faithful? Kapag kami ang sumaway niyang mga iyan, iba na  ang tingin sa amin. Malandi na kami, haliparot, pakawala, makikay at kung anu-ano pang mga bansag ang itatawag sa amin. Kapag kayo gumawa noon, ok lang. Lalake kayo eh, macho kayo pag ginawa niyo iyon.   Kaya kami. Walang magawa. Magpapakaburo at magpapakamadre nalang. Kapag nagloko na kayo ano pa bang magaga wa namin? Eh di iiyak nalang. Wala namang ibang magagawa eh.   Tungkol naman sa tinatawag niyong pagdedemand namin. Hindi kami nagdedemand! Karapatan lang namin iyon. Karapatan namin na lambingin niyo kami, icheck at ipakita sa amin na mahal niyo kami.    Hindi rin ibig sabihin na mas sincere kayo sa amin. Seryoso rin naman  kami ah. At ang maturity wala yan sa edad. Mas maaga nga kaming magmature sa inyo. Ang isang 19 year old na lalake eh, isip 15 pa  yun. It follows iyan sa lahat ng age group. Mas mataas pa nga kung minsan ang pagbawas ng level of maturity. Kayo na ang mag-math. Pati  yung pag-iyak namin pinupuntirya niyo. Kesyo drama daw. Diba kapag umiyak ka nagbuhos ka ng emosyon diyan. Ano tingin niyo sa amin mga artista?!   Alam niyo iyon? Yun bang kulang nalang ay lumuha ka na ng dugo, pero  hindi ka pa rin papansinin. Sasabihan ka pang tigilan na ang  pagdradrama. Hindi nila kami maintindihan kapag nagseselos kami.  Bakit naman kami magseselos kung wala kaming nakikita? Mas iba kaming magmahal. Mas masarap.   Kapag natapos na ang lambingan, eh di siyempre iwanan blues na. Kami  pa raw ang nagsawa, kami pa raw ang nagtritrip lang. Sino ba ang lumalayas kapag may nakita nang bago, sino ba ang mayabang, sino ba ang nagmamalaki? Kami ba? Kami ang walang choice. Kasi ang babae pag sinabing "break na tayo" lambingin lang iyan ng konti balikan blues na iyan. Kapag ang lalake ang umayaw, pucha, bahala ka diyan. Kahit mag-tambling ka pa sa harap niya. Wa-epek. Umiyak ka ng bato. Wa-epek. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Tapos sila pa raw ang kawawa.    Post-break up, mahal pa ng babae si lalaki. Sasamantalahin ni lalaki.  Magpapagawa ng kung anu-ano. Naaalala ka lang kapag may kailangan sa iyo. Kapag pumangit ka after the break up, magpapasalamat sila na iniwan ka nila. Kapag gumanda ka naman, ipagkakalat nila sa buong sangkatauhan na naging girlfriend ka niya. Sala sa init sala sa lamig talaga.   Ano ba namang buhay to? Ang hirap ding maging babae ano. Kala nila laging sila nalang. Lagi rin kaming naiiwan sa ere. In-love din  kami.    Ang mga lalake talaga, oo.   hahahaha. im bored.  super ingay sa aming munting tahanan - thats because our house is being renovated. schools coming and ive changed my mind about being excited over school. my section is 47. i have no friends there... that just sucks. dont you agree? hmmm. better make new ones.

A cockroach can live several weeks with its head cut off - it dies from starvation.    im pretty bored... pretty, pretty bored. hmmm.   anyways, im checking out some sites and downloading some songs. guess  anne  and his boy are okay now (though they made up in a gross way - dont want to talk about it any further - jk lang  bim !) cause  anne  was on all smiles while i was talking to her on the fone...

      how dumb am i to think that lying on the ground for minutes was absurd???  ...when i almost died hours ago with all of " ma'am "  aiko 's (aka  godess of corrective measures  - she admitted it herslef!) punishments.  can you believe she commanded us to do 500 bombers???  huwaaattt!? 500?  huuuwwwaaaaaattt!?!? payb handred? are you serious?  hhhuwattt!?!?!? ulol!  yes, you read it right... limangdaan!!! as in 100 plus 100 plus 100 plus 100 and a hundred more! good thing though the other  officers  pitied us. so... we only did about 50. but still, my legs hurt so much. 12 pa nga lang give up na ako eh! 50 pa kaya! sobra promise... my legs hurt so much that i wanted to cry by the time i have done my 15th bomber. at hindi pa po yun tapos. pinatakbo pa kami sa malayo. and we had two air raids!!! kainis!!!   moreover, the  officers  had a little surprise for us. and according to them, they're doing the surprise because they "love" us.   and what more could be nicer than to do a little sharing!? nothing, right???   wrooooooonnng!!!  they made us eat this little piece of skyflakes (actually, skyflake or skybit na lang ata yun!) and they also made us drink this little amount of water in a mineral bottle.  masyado bang madali??? hindi pa rin eh. kasi we need to share the tiny skybit and water. as in iisa lang yun at dapat lahat makakain at makainom.  i guess all my prayers have been answered by  god  kasi ako unang kumain at uminom (ako pinaka-una sa linya eh) !!! i mean, i am sooo, sooo, sooo lucky!!! i dont need to deal with SARS. hahaha.  hay, ewan. sometimes i wonder why i joined the model flight. i guess i did it to please my  dad . he got a little disappointed with me when he found out that his  daughter  was not a CAT officer . he's a military officer, remember?  guess that least i could do is to join the model flight. but hey, no regrets! i quite enjoy sweating!!! =) and its really fun anyways.   sooooooo... what else cant i rant in here??? hmmm.  people, i have a question? am i a girl or a boy??? girl naman ako diba!!! hay, kainisss!!!   things between  dreamboy  and i are not going well.  i was talking with  riane  during lunch time. she asked me how things are going between  ian  and i... i told her the situation and she advised me to talk with him.   but why... oh why  riane !?   ...why bother talking to someone who took advantage of me???

      since i love you all... here are some reminders (for those  in-love  and  soon-to-be in love peeps !!!)  1. Never try to change your  loved one  to suit your own taste. It defeats the purpose of falling in love with him/her for what he/she really is.   2. More often than not, it is  THE EX  that couples often fight about. Try not to. In the first place, both of you know very well that you're glad to have found each other.    3.  Guys  will forever be thinking of different  girls  the whole day. But it is who's in their hearts that they will be always thinking of every night before they sleep at night (hoping that they dream of her that night as they sleep too).   4. After a fight and you stay up sad, can't sleep and thinking of your  loved one,  I guarantee that he/she is doing the same thing too.    5. After being with each other for so long, never forget the little things that made you fall in love with him/her more.   6. Loving someone isn't about seeing him/her as often as you can. It's about trusting each other that both of you love and yearn for one's company. The moment you start counting the number of times you call/see/spend time/talk with each other then chances are the one who is  keeping tabs has the problem. Love is more than that.   7. Too much jealousy can kill, but a little of it is healthy. Besides, it's nice to know that your  loved one fears losing you.   8. It's pointless to be in a relationship if you can't see urself  spending the rest of your life with your him/her. True love is not a pastime.    9. For  guys : So what if your abs aren't as defined or gush-worthy? Or you don't look any bit like  Brad Pitt ?  For  girls : So what if you don't have big boobs that are drool-worthy? Or you don't look any bit like  Heather Graham?  Whatever you feel you lack physically, your  bf/gf still sees you as the hottest, most attractive person on earth.    10. Never underestimate the value of holding hands. It was the first time you knew you love and are loved in return by the person you're with now. And it was the prelude to the kiss. "  Let lips do what hands do: they kiss  ." ( Romeo  &  Juliet )   11. Look forward to spending time with him/her. Time spent together should never be an obligation or part of a routine because this leads to taking the fun out of being with each other.    12. Don't undervalue laughter. Just like the previous statement, fun is also a considerable aspect of a long-lasting relationship.   13. Support each other. Motivate one another. Don't be insecure at the success of your loved one. Besides, you may not know it, but you play a vital role in inspiring him/her.   14. Small random acts of sweetness have guaranteed tremendous effects.    15. When you fight, what's the use of prolonging your agony? Don't let pride waste time that should be spent happy together.   16. When having a serious fight and you ask yourself whether or not your relationship is worth rescuing and your answer is a "yes"; with  conviction, then you must be right. But if deep inside, your answer is "I'm not really sure", you may not be aware of it, but it leans on the "no" answer.   17. Say"I love you" because you mean it, and not because you have to. Don't hold back on saying it out of the blue too. Besides, you'll never get a negative reaction from doing so. And it will feel good for both of you.   18. Never take for granted the word "sweetheart or honey".   19. Do all the sweet, mushy stuffs, but don't ever forget that he/she is a FRIEND too...  20. and lastly and most importantly... love him/her with all your heart. simple and plain as that. =P  happy loving you all. =P

      hay buhay nga naman. i was about to post a super long entry when suddenly...  "Error!!!" says this computer.   anyways, no point to complain now... on with my day.  july 11 means something recurring and monotonous to most  bedans  cause its always the same every year - processions, masses and quiz bees in honor of saint benedict. yep!!! you guessed it right, its saint benedict's featday today.  guess what!?  mars  "luckily" got picked (randomly, over 400+ seniors!!!) to join the quiz bee. you should've seen her reaction when she heard her name being called.   we had an "inspirational" talk with some pregnant speaker after lunch which, turned out to be a disaster because our beloved and brand new prefect got mad at us and dismissed us late after the speaker left.   dreamboy  wasnt around today. think he's absent again.   i dunno if im supposed to be happy or sad or what... about what happened this afternoon. but one things for sure. - im quite appalled, full of shame but, somewhat happy.  eto talaga ang buong storya...   mars  and i were on the car on our way to atc when we stopped in front of the richville corporate tower (traffic eh!!!). i saw the ABC lab ad and then remembered that  anya 's (hi!!!)  dad  is the president of that company. i tried to point this out to  marilen , as in literally pointed out - tinuro ko (waaahhh!!!), when the car suddenly moved. syempre, nag-move din yung background sa harap ko at nag-iba ng direksyon ang tinuturo ko...  syempre hindi na sa ad nakaturo yung finger ko... and guess huwat kung sino ang nag-aabang ng jeepney sa harap ng richville tower exactly at the same time, at the same place kung saan nakaturo sa ang daliri ko sa harap ng suppper clear na windows ng kotse ni  mars ???  si  ian  at si  viray .  waaaaahhh! the horror. monkey on the loose... si  viray  nakawala. hahahaha!!! de joke!!!  seriously, it was so embarassing!!! pero... hahaha. napangiti parin ako eh!!! =)  anyways, mars and i ate at mcdo for about an hour and a half... waaahhh!!! takaw. hahaha. we were also checking out the swooning  southridge boys . sobrang cuttttteee nila. =P heheheee. my  cousin  was even there. kaya i cant look at them straight in the face. nandun si insan eh!!! =P pero... hmmm. why would he even care noh!!!  anyhows, quite tired now so got to blasttttttttttt!!!

      hello  blogger .  tell me. why does my life suck???  errr. here i am stuck in front of my computer. trying to figure out which homework to do first!!! waaaaaaaaaahhh. and then, here comes the thought of that stupid, idiot and manipulating asshole.   i was in the comfort room this lunchtime when somebody told me that my stupid, idiotic and manipulating ex-boyfriend has a new crush. (she's a very reliable source...)  so what!? i just told my self. its over between the two of us... right!?  wrong.  you know the fact that he is still attached... in my heart. (whooo. the drama)  and here i was yesterday. talking about how he smiled at me... how my world suddenly stopped when he flashed me those pearly whites. waaaaahhh. bullshitttttttttttttt... yeaaaaaaaahhh. you guessed it right. he was the one who made me smile yesterday. it was  ian .  ian .  ian .  ian .  ian .  ian . asshole. asshole. asshole. asshole. asshole. asshole.    i hate you. but i love you. i cant stop thinking of you. its trueee. im stuck on you.   and the worst part!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! he likes someone very, very, very close to me. as in superrrrrrrrrrr. waaaaahhh.   ano ba!? is he playing his game on me again! cause if he is... i swear im gonna kick his ass off. i was on the verge of crying when she told me the news. i was throwing things around... in short, im really affected.   im super affected.  as in... superrr!!! waaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh.   super hurt.  super paranoid right now.  super actingly stupid.  super everything. but not anything super happy.  i just cant get over him.   these wounds wont seem to heal. the pain is just too real. there's just too much that time cannot erase.   hmmm. i sooo... acting like a kid - childishly. hmmm.   i guess the only good thing that happened today was when...  jessica  arrived and talked to me. hayyy. i miss her so much. she just sooo understands me. =P and when i went to narra to meet up with  kat ,  dorz ,  maggi  and  vissia  to have my virtues class.

      i still cant forget how dorky he looked. he really looked like a dork... a cute dork. i cant believe im saying this stuff. =P mwahahaha!   anyways, one of my classmate discovered my obsessions with chinese and pale guys (remember  joseph yeo  and  draco malfoy ? errr,  joseph 's chinese and  draco 's pale). wierd ko daw...   anyways, you should read this guys...    ‘Fess Up   Here I am making a fool of myself, waiting for him for almost like forever…   “Where is that guy?”   He told me hours ago to meet up here just so he can tell me how he ‘fessed up to Penelope his undying loveee…   Yeah, whatever. I’m jealous with Penelope. For your information, she’s the “dream girl” of Nicolo. And Nicolo, incidentally, is my best friend… or so he thinks. To tell you the truth, I have been in love with Nicolo for almost a month now.   It all started when Nicolo asked for my help. He wanted me to help him woo Penelope. But it’s complicated. You see, Nicolo is the super torpe type-of-guy. And worst, Penelope doesn’t even notice him. But, yeah… being a friend, I still helped him. Predictable, yes – I fell in love with him as time fluttered.  Yep. I really am in love with him. Every time he looks at me, my eyes twinkle. Every time he talks with me, I could hardly go back to reality. Every time he smiles at me, I always go weak. But every time he mentions Penelope’s name, my world seems to crash.   I have not told Nicolo about my feelings for him and I think I won’t even plan to tell him. Guess I’m just too scared that he might stop talking to me or whatever if he ever knew I like him. And I don’t think I could ever take that. The pain it would cause…  Oh pain. Crap. Yeah. That’s what I’m going to get here after he tells me how he ‘fessed up to Pene…  “Hey!”   He showed up… late. And he’s carrying flowers… White bloom lilies, my favorite flowers.   “So??? What has happened? What did she say? Her reaction? Did she go beserk or whatever?” I said that with all my nerve.  “I still haven’t told her.”  “Huwaaattt??? So all my hard work in the trash bin again, I guess. So when are you planning to…”  “Tell her?” he interfered. “Well, I’m planning to tell her now…”   I looked up at him. He looked very serious. Hmmm. Something’s fishy. So I tried to mock a laugh and just said, “Well then, ‘fess up!!!”  “Rayne, I love you.”  “What did you say?” What is he saying? What is he up to? He looked at me for what seemed like eternity.  Then… “I said ‘Rayne, I love you.’”  He then pulled out a letter. And together with the lilies, he gave it to me and left.   I pulled out a letter and read it. It said:   It’s hard to live alone. It’s hard to choose someone you could love. But the hardest part of living is to admit that you have fallen in love with someone you didn’t mean to love from the start.  Rayne,   Go figure.   Much love, Nicolo   I carefully folded the letter back to its place.   He loves me. I smiled…  Finally, his heart gave in.   And yeah… Finally, he ‘fessed up.    hhhhhhhhmmm...

      its official. ive fallen for a "new" person. yes. opo. finally, i now know the reason for my wierdness the past few days.   finally, my heart gave in  .   i also have been thinking about this for a very long time span...   i know you've said for the nth time that you're not mad at me... pero i just know how you feel... how hurt you are. nag-guilty na talaga ako sa sinabi mo sakin kanina... sabi mo sakin twice na nangyari to. im really sorry if i caused you pain.      i really didnt mean to fall for him.     pero, just like you, he caught me with his "charm." sobrang nahuli niya ang weakness ko... but believe me, i didnt expect this to happen. and katulad mo ulit, ayokong siya ang maging rason na pagka-sira nang ating friendship. and thats the last thing i want... ang masira ang friendship natin. i know we've only met for a couple of months pero... iba ka eh.   hayyyyy, hope you'll forgive me.

      "what's your name?"  moi: " kareen "  "so, what school are you from?"  moi: "st. benedict college"   (screams!!!) =P (laughs) "okay, give me a movie that is shown right now in ATC?" (pulls out a paper with the words: hollywood homicide, freddy vs. jason, daddy day care and 2 fast to furious) moi: "too fast to furious" "okay, you've just won tickets for the whole barkada!!!"  waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!! can you believe my luck??? i won tickets for two just because i answered that very easy question.  naks.   i went to town today 'round 1PM cause i'll watch the Teen Cheers Competition. anyways,  jessica  is part of the cheerleading squad and i want to support her in any way i can. grabehhh!!! school spirit was so alive. halos lahat ng audience  bedans ... siguro 1/2 are bedans. naks talaga mga bedans. but i didnt get to finish the competition cause my  mom  was already scolding me. you know, the usual blah, blah, blah. pero okay parin!!!!!!!!!!  jess  really is the best!!! =P  errr, yeah. chaperone nanaman ako sa movie date nina  anne  and  laza  which turned out to be a sleeping session for me. i wanted to watch 2 fast to furious but they insisted that we watch freddy vs. jason instead. well, no choice... so i watched it too.   total waste of time and money. the story was so lame and stupid. the scenes were too fictional. "whatever" nalang tuloy ang naging reaction ko. hay...  friday night was a long, long, long night for me... we ( MF boys and girls ,  JOs  and  SOs ) had an overnight camping. it was fun but supppeeer tiring. as in super! pinagpasa-pasahan ba naman kami ng officers para parushan. i guess  olivia 's punishments were the hardest. she made us do lots of bombers, push-ups and she made us roll on the muddy field. twas fun though. =P the officers were pretty strict and hot-headed that night, though. well, we also had a so-called "war games," which turned out to be only like habulan. and we also had the "bravery test."  francis ,  anne 's bf, was my partner. our task was to go to the finish line, which was the GS lab, using clues. hay, medyo nahirapan lang naman kami with the second clue... but the rest, okay! =P moreover, ginugulat kami ng mga officers. hayyy!!! lol.   slept round 330 in the morning and woke up at 5. so... natulog lang pala ako ng 1.5 hours. hayyyyyyyyyyyyy!!! lakas ng stamina ko. nakapag-lakwatsa pa. idol talaga. =P hehehe. jk only.  oo nga po pala. i already took the UA&P and Ateneo admission test. Ateneo was okay except for the math part, which was soooo hard. UA&P made me hurl... im just so bad with abstract reasoning. the math was quite hard too. and yeah, i sucked at the essay part. bleghhh. so gud lak nalang sa akin. =P  sige. layas narin ako... babush!!!

"oo naman" aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!   but... in the first place, why was i expecting him to like me? when im just a kid in his eyes... bata lang naman tingin niya sakin.   anyways, thats what happened last night... or should i say morning... kasi we were texting until 2 am. hay, only to find out those things. he also told me that he's sort of in a confused "era" right now in terms of love... hmmm.   aaaaaaaaaaahhh. how could an angel break my hearrrttt???

        INFINITE MOMENTS OF DOING HOMEWORKS BECAUSE OF YOU  By  KAREEN ANN DE JESUS     Writing about love is like dancing and singing in front of the whole school. It is so easy to look and sound stupid. It’s a tough act to make sense. So what’s the reason why I’m writing this if I am to look and sound stupid? Well, I view writing as my refuge when I’m lost… and I am lost today. Besides, love is in the air (it’s Valentine’s Day!). So, what do I dare say about love? In my opinion, love is vague – everyone has its own definition. Ideas about love as a fantasy, love as damnation turns suddenly into rubbish when someone suddenly walks in front of you resembling a god or a goddess with eyes that twinkle like the stars. The god or goddess sent from above suddenly locks eyes and smiles at you. Everything stops. Your heart abruptly beats with such intensity. Everything just becomes beautiful.   Love walks in when reason takes a break.  But one thing is for sure. Love puts more meaning into everything. I cannot imagine existence without it. Besides, rob it gone and boy bands would have nothing to sing about.  But seriously, to speak the truth, I never thought I’d fall in love… especially at an early age and with a childhood friend. I have never imagined that the person who used to tease and play tricks on me would be the same person I would write about in this article. This particular person showed me the reality of love. He made me understand that love is more than just chocolates, flowers, and the like. His hugs made me levitate as if I were in heaven. His jokes made me laugh endlessly. His presence made me smile. All these simple things made a world of difference because he made my life complete. But it was only when I lost him when I realized his worth.  It was only then that I realized that without his love, life would be nothing but infinite moments of doing homeworks.    nyahahaha. thats the article i made for like... 3 hours. hahahaha. ^_^

      heartwarmers daw!? hmmm... got this in friendster. btw, post ako ng pictures... nasabik kaming lahat sa camera eh. cant believe that we've got just  TWO WEEKS LEFT !!! im graduating in a month... i'll be leaving bene... my gali.     maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person, we should know how to be grateful for that gift.       nyahaha ^_^ kwarenta'y siete!!!       its' true that we don't know what we've got until we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives.       ang mga sabik sa pictures    never say goodbye when you still want to try. never give up when you still feel you can take it. never say you don't love that person anymore when you can't let go.     alex looking stupid      it takes a minute to have a crush on someone, an hour to like someone and a day to love someone - but it takes a lifetime to forget someone.       teban in our tambayan ^_^ nyahaha!      the happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just make the most of everything that comes along their way.       my guilty pleasure T_T      the brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past, you can't go on well in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches.

      according to  Merriam Webster 's Collegiate Dictionary 10th Edition,  COMMIT  means to entrust, confide, consign, relegate, perpetrate... yada yada.  whatever... well, in my opinion, commiting means to  OBLIGATE OR PLEDGE ONESELF .  hrmmm... well, doesnt having a boyfriend mean you have to commit!? my gali... waaaaaaaaaaa!!!    kareen 's greatest fears: 1. rejection 2. hurting/disappointing myself 3. hurting/disappointing others 4.

      woke up with such a bad morning.  una, nanaginip nanaman ako. and it was such a  DIRTY DREAM . madumi... you get my point! it was just soooo  SEXUAL . do girls have wet dreams too??? i dont think so kasi wala naman akong na-experience na katulad nung sa isang tao diyan. *ehem ehem* ^_^ good thing though. i wouldnt want to wash my undies so early in the morning. haha. what am i even talking about? washing undies so early in the morning??? hahahaha! anyways, after i woke up, i was still thinking about my dream. mga isang oras ko atang naalala yung panaginip ko. pota!!! ang libog ko na ata. nabibwisit na ako. wahahaha!!! pero okay lang... ika nga sa general psychology... nasa "genital stage" na ako. i am experiencing the "sexual re-awakening!"  KADIRI !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ano ba tong mga pinagsasabi ko??? wahahaha!!! ^_^  eto pa nakakainis. kagabi  teb  told me to sleep na. and yes... masunurin ako. natulog nga ako. tapos after an hour, i woke up with the ringing of my cellphone. it was him. according to the last call record, i talked to him for 41 seconds.  I THINK IM HAVING AN ABRUPT "SELECTIVE" AMNESIA  because i cant remember a single word he said and i said to him. pramis...  HINDI KO NA TALAGA MATANDAAN  except for one part of the call. i am soooo sure that i ended the conversation by saying "i love you." and i think he also said "i love you" too... only... parang pilit ata yung pagsabi niya. pero pilit ata yung pagsabi niya dahil siguro akala niya pilit din yung akin...  EWAN KO TAL  AGA !!!  WALA NA AKONG MATANDAAN !!! ano nabang nangyayari sa akin??? huhuhuhu T_T  i feel so bad today. i just feel so stressed. i hate this feeling. hope this feeling will end soon. itulog ko nalang kaya to? hayyy...   kanta op d moment: Kailangan Kita  " sa piling mo lang nadarama ang tunay na pagsinta. pag yakap kita ng mahigpit parang ako'y nasa langit. ngunit ito ay panaginip lamang pagkat ang puso moy labis kong nasaktan. pakiusap ko ako ay pakinggan. kailangan kita ngayon at kailanman. kailangang mong malaman na ikaw lamang ang tunay kong minamahal at tangi kong hiling ay makapiling ka muli "

BADTRIP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! hay...   anyways, last night was our  FROSH SOLIDARITY  (tama ba!?)  NIGHT ... and  I DIDNT GO TO THAT DAMNED PARTY ... because... i was  TOO LAZY . hahaha. i mean... my classes were only up to 1130! what am i supposed to do? go home to alabang then......... go to benilde again by 6???  NO WAY !!! wag na lang.  ID RATHER SLEEP.  speaking of school... well, i guess im okay with it. im meeting new friends... dalawa na ang member ng fans club ko - the NSTP teacher (new memeber!!!) and my bible study teacher. ano pa ba!? well, i think im doing well with my grades... specially with math cause its way too preschool. nga pala, sumakay ako sa LRT kahapon!!!  ASHTIGGGGGGGG !!! hehehe. yatch. naaliw eh no. pero first time eh!!! ^_^  i watched harry potter during its first day of showing.  NAKAKA-DISAPPOINT  ang movie. i think everything was exaggerated!!! hay... halatang bago na ang director. basta, i didnt like it and so did many of the movie-goers.   got this from friendster... eto daw mga indications whatevah to know if  YOU ARE REALLY IN LOVE ...   (1) Do I treat the other person as a person or a  thing?  If you go out with him/her because he/she is  good looking (a "prize" to be with) or a way out  (a ticket to the movies), that isn't love.  (2) Would you chose to spend the evening alone  with him/her if there were no kissing, no  touching, and no sex?  If not, it isn't love.  (3) Are the two of you at ease and as happy  alone as you are with friends?  If you need other friends around to have a good  time, it isn't love.  (4) Do you get along?  If you fight and make up a lot, get hurt and  jealous, tease and criticize one another, better  be careful, it may not be love.  (5) Are you still interested in dating or  secretly "messing around" with others?  If so, you aren't in love.   (6) Can you be totally honest and open?  If either or both of you are selfish, insincere,  feel confined, or unable to express feelings, be  cautious.   (7) Are you realistic?  You should be able to admit possible future  problems. If others (besides a parent) offend  you by saying they are surprised you are still  together, that you two seem so different, that  they have doubts about your choice, better take  a good look at this relationship.  (8) Is either of you much more of a taker than a  giver?  If so, no matter how well you like that  situation now, it may not last.  (9) Do you think of the partner as being a part  of your whole life?  If so, and these dreams seem good, that is an  indication of love.   tinatamad na ako sooooo... alis na ko. byeeeeeee!!!   kanta op d moment: Yeah  " yeah. shorty got down and said come and get me. yeah. i got so caught up I forgot she told me. yeah. her and my girl used be the best of homies. yeah next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah "

Hmmmmmm kung sure ngakayo eh di maganda! Nadala na ko diyan sapagmamahal na yan.. parang pangtanga lang atayan eh… pano katangahan.. magpakatanga sa isangtaong tanga para mahalin mo! Gets mo ba?! Minsanganun feeling ko eh pero anoh magagawa ko? Mahalko… mahal ko… mahal ko.. o tama na nababaliw nako eh… gusto ko lang actually maglabas ngnararamdaman ko.. ung tipong masabi ko naman ungfeelings ko kahit na sa ganito lang.. at leastmadaming makakarelate di ba? Pano kasi bakit bakasi minsan hindi natin mapigilang mahalin angisang tao? Puwede bang piliin ung taongmamahalin mo? Bakit ba kasi nafofall pa tayo saisang taong hindi naman tayo pwedeng mahalin? Atang listahan ng mga tanong ko eh hindi namatatapos… pero parang un na rin un.. tanong akong tanong bakit ba kasi ganun? Nagmamahal ka bapara masaktan?? Ndi ba dapat pag nagmahal kamasaya ka? Bakit ba kasi kailangan pang may BADSIDE? Bakit ba kailangang umiyak ka pa? Un baang gusto nila?Un ba un?? Sasabihan ako ng “Lovecomes with pain!” ay walang ya sino pamagmamahal niyan kung palaging ganun? Iiyak kana lang palagi ganun ba un? Ay ang hirap atanun… sasabihan ako ng “ganyan talaga ang love…kailangan mong umiyak.” Pero after that anoh?Iiyak ka ulit? Kukuha ka na ng balde? Hay naku!Ewan ko ba bakit ba kasi nagmamahal pa tayo?!Sabi ko na eh… MALI yang pagmamahal na yan..MALI yang sinasabi ng mga tao… MALI…… malingmali talaga… until… nakilala ko siya… aaaaaaaaaaUMIYAK NANAMAN AKO… akala ko ba love na?! Peroalam niyo dahil sa kanya nakita ko na..naintindihan ko na.. kung ano ba talaga ung LOVEna un… naintindihan ko na kung bakit kailangangumiyak kung bakit kailangang may sakit… kasikung lagi na lang tayo magiging masya wala ngsaysay ung pagmamahal natin… narealize ko nahindi lahat ng gusto… dapat… at hindi lahat nggusto… nakukuha… pero un nga ung maganda dun ehnatututo ka… kahit na ilang balde na ng luhameron ka.. nakukuha mo pang ngumiti dahilandiyan siya.. kahit hindi sa pormang gusto momasaya ka ng malaman na masaya siya.. hindi baganun naman talaga ung pagmamahal? Hindi angsarili mong kasiyahan ang iniisip mo.. angimportante masaya siya… kahit na hindi sa pilingmo… kahit na hindi dahil sayo… basta MASAYA SIYA… naintindihan ko na kung bakit hindi lahatng bagay nakukuha… anoh tayo spoiled? Heheminsan dapat pagkaitan ka din ng grasya noh…masyado ng mabait si Lord nian… pero ito langmga tsong… sa pagmamahal.. expect the nexpected…wag kayo masyadong magisip… hayaan niong mismongpagmamahal nga ang magdugtong sa inyo sapnkmagandang paraan… kung hanggang kaibiganlang tanggapin niyo… kasama yan pag nagmahal kaung sakit… ung luha… kasi pag ganun masasabi mona sa buong mundo… nagmahal ako… ng sobra…ngtotoo… &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;   kanta op d moment: Angels&nbsp;or Devils  " the angels they burn inside for us and are we ever are we ever gonna learn to fly. the devils they burn inside of us. are we ever gonna come back down? come around im always gonna worry about the things that could break us "
