       I hear the sounds of the wind howling, and fall back just as the thunder answers lightning's call. Then the irony I see, in these little children, finding the little of joys in the rain.  We often take things for granted, belittling the little wonders that the world has given us. We overshadow our real feelings, in this faltering reality that we have created.  We see ourselves in these little children; Adimiring how it feels to be liberated, how it is to be so full of innocence. To have the world go by you, slowly.  We abide not by our expectations of life, but by that of others. Forsaking our happiness, for recognition, for acceptance.  We've come a long way, seeking maturity, living in the world. But we let ourselves go by, without taking in what is around us.  The suns glow, the grasses' scent, the warmth of sand, and the beatitude of the rain. We let it all go by us.  At times we turn around, seeking for what we once had. Only this time, it's different. It's completely changed.  So just stop, for we have to ask ourselves; Is all that really worth it? After all, a man can't profit by gaining the world, if he should lose his soul.

       I've found a reason to leave. I just can't take these lies anymore, it's building up in me; Ironically, it is, still unfulfilled.  It strangles me, these lies, blinding me; I can't breathe, I'm staggering towards you. But your far, much farther now.  That is my reason to leave; Your making me deceased.  I have endured, I have kept myself going on. But your there; Never here.  Your lies, I have forgiven. The pain you've cause, I have forsaken. I took you in, again and again.  My choice has been made, I can't let you do this anymore.  You've blinded me from the truth, you've made me lost in a world so untrue. Yet you've trapped me there, afflicted by your addiction.  I've tried repeatedly to come back to you, but only inflicting myself with pain and sorrow. Why do you keep me locked out; Why are you so far away.  I have to move on, I can't carry on this way. This is my reason; Your making me deceased.

       Beneath the sky, life deceased, life was born. Above the skies, life soared, We conquered.  Changing, evolving; We've conquered life, and life has conquered us.  We change, we adapt, all but improve.  Amidst our new found peace, human weaknesses stagger; Slow but not far behind.  We have undoubtedly changed, we have become unrecognisable to our past; But at the slightest tempts, the minute of provocations, we burst, we come out forth. To our old ways that we fear, that we've suppressed all these years.  Ravaging, pillaging. Lusting, and with obsession.  Yes we've changed, but some things just never change.
