        (1) I lost my teddy bear. Will you sleep with me?   (2) Excuse me, do you have a Band-Aid because I scraped my knee when I fell for you.   (3) I hope you have a library card because I'm checking you out.   (4) Your tag says Made in USA, but I could have sworn you were made in Heaven.   (5) Hey lady, those are some nice clothes, can I talk you out of them?   (6) How do you like your eggs: poached, scrambled, or fertilized?   (7) Is your dad a terrorist? Cause baby your da bomb!   (8) My love for you is like diarrhea, I just can't hold it in.   (9) Your parents must be retarded, because you are special.   (10) Want to play Pearl Harbor?....Its a game where I lay  back while You blow the hell out of me.   (11) If you were a burger at McDonald's, I'd call you McBeautiful.   (12) Do you believe in love at first sight or should I walk past you again?
