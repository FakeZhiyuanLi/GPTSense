       geezz.. not again. another insomic night. totally drains me the next day. let`s see, yesterday i slept at around 5am after tossing and turning. and i woke up at 10am.  that`s 5 hours.  and just now i fell asleep at 7pm and woke up at 12am.   fantastic. right now my sleeping hours have gone bersek. i can`t even sleep like a normal human. arggh whadda-fuck is happening? really really sucks.  can`t even give me a decent wet dream, er i mean sweet dream eh? oh well. i`m hungry too. and since i`m talking about my lifestyle now, i have to mention to the fact that i eat 1 meal a day.  not because mummy and daddy is starving me or what. it`s that irregular sleeping hours. i wake up at 4pm sometimes, thus skipping breakfast and lunch. And sometimes dinner is not done because mum`s busy. so i only eat supper- 7eleven. Cup noodles.  i swear those people at 7 eleven recognize my footsteps as soon as i step into the shop.   i`m the uber regular customer. basically, my face is the membership card. or rather. my striking hair color, which shines in the dark.   hmm. maybe i should try working at 7 eleven. i mean, i love to work at night. and at night the rate is more. so, woot. love to work at night = more money too. fantastic. i gotta try.  digressing, darn i haven called the lady kok siong asked me to call for the job. don`t have time yet. still busy with my game. =X Ragnarok Online`s too addictive. hehe. well, a short intro about RO.  it`s an online massive multiplayer game that has spawned a huge fanbase. it has so many servers all around the work, both public and private servers. currently, i`m playing in the english mRO server [malaysia ragnarok online]. RO has a comic and anime under it`s name too. it`s great.  what`s so fun about this game? The cute anime. you play the role of characters with anime spirites. honestly, it`s very very good.   so okay. enuff said. go grab a copy of the cd at any comic connections.  or if u wanna take alook, i suggest  urlLink iRO website . it`s the best Ragnarok website around. mRO`s webbie is pathetic. crappy english, spelling errors, factual mistakes, etc. [malaysian. wad u expect?]  the only complain i have for mRO is- GM`s [game masters-they take care of the game, something like policemen] english is TERRIBLE. besides the rampant bottings [which i honestly don`t care] and the insane english those malaysian can breath out, it`s a nice game. just the people. that`s all.  thankful, i got malaysian chinese friends who speak good english, and are totally unlike the norm.   god bless them. so kind, always giving items. i`ll post pictures of my character soon. will have to do abit of editin, since i don`t wanna be stalked online. hehe.   OMFGYM [oh my fucking guan ying ma]   I just realize that i have not submitted the deferance letter to NS. Shit. i hope i don`t get fucking haul in to the army half way during ite lessons. fuck lah. i totally forget about the ns shit. why can`t the school actually do it for us? i mean, DAMNIT u got some fucking fantastic MOE/MO-whatever network right?  grr. I-DON`T-WANT-TO-BE-HAULED-IN-SO-EARLY  I love NS, but let me study first okay? please? *sobs*

       muhahaha. fucking blogger. [in the positive way]  FREE UNLIMITED PHOTO IMAGEHOST . goodness. the merger with google is a match make in heaven. not forgetting, i get that amazing huge 1000mb gmail by google.  and you know what, those xanga, xdiary, blah blah?   YOU DON`T GET IT. hahah. nic sim [my best friend from primary school-the only gabrielite that i have found, or rather he found me] actually pop in msn and asked what`s wrong with XANGA. haha.  i replied, with facts.  silence.  no more reply. hmm. maybe he`s switching to blogger too. -laughs gleefully- haha. now stare at my pictures. it`s all on a stable free host. muhaha.   oh yeah, barry [my childhood friend/neighbour since diapers] actually plans on going for Singapore Idol. aww. that`s nice. but`s apparently he`s pulling out. cold feets and unsupportive mates. shucks. everyone do give him a kick in the ass.   support him and make sure he becomes the next william, er i mean clay.  i`m lookin forward to the start of the audition screenies. i bet singaporean are 100% predictable- J-pop/K-Pop dressing. Poppish songs. wanna-be-black rappers. who knows, william hung-ers [yeah i invented that].  Unless someone acutally pops in and sing the national anthem, I bet he or she will get choosen. Singapore`s so into this patrotism thingy. oh, the sars heros, oh the collasped bridge heroes. blah blah.  i`m sure they did fine. no nid to mention anything about mother singapore. sounds like some damning communist cunt-ry [pun intended]  aside from digressing, i`m sure singapore idol would be really entertainin. i mean, look at those yellow faces clowns "crooning". no i ain`t no racist. what i meant was huang lian [yellow face] which is sorta like huang = willian hung. get it?  muhaha. well something like that anyway.  if i can find some more things to nit-pick about, i`ll post. meanwhile, keep the comments following in.   yeah.

       alrighty. i procastinated again. big draw back. remember- i  was  i was supposed to do my photos today. but oh fuck, i woke up late. i mean, i wanted morning shots.  and i woke up at 4.30pm  fantastic isnt it? really. how, not having school really makes one extremely piggish. i swear, if i don`t start school soon, i`ll have the attitude and the mindset of a sloth.  and that would be really bad -.-  imagine, nic the sloth. yuck. i`m an active monkey. i mean, a sloth looks like a monkey but it isn`t really a monkey. ya. haha, blah whatever. i`m sure u get the picture. somehow. think so.  anyway, i`ll just do my regular blogging for now. i mean, hey- the current blog skins are not that bad. well, i haven updated the pictures or links to my friends, but well i`m too darn lazy to touch the complex editing.  that`s until i get my own templates.  hate ripping off from people. sure, i mean i copy bits and bits here and there. and pretty much everywhere. but at least, hey- i did it. muhaha. something.  now, it`s 1.24am.  and i won`t be able to sleep until i hit around 5-6am when my daddy wakes up for work. and i get sleepy, finally at last.   THE INSOMIA IS KILLING   i don`t get it. why is it so severe now. i used to roll in bed for and hour or so. now it`s like 2-3 hours. mum say it`s the feedback i get from the computer. i say it`s family related stress. when i ain`t blaming them or what.  but, well. there is a storm brewing.   somehow. but we`ll get over it.   on the lighter note,   dad and mum`s planning to migrate to australia. HOORAY. Fuck the hot weather goodbye, kanninabei. Fuck the expensive lifestle. Fuck the hetic, stressful bullshit. Fuck the no-pass-maths-no-poly-only-ite-you-stupid-mother-fucker system.   God, i love the plan. and it`s working out soon.  Dad say i might get to go there and live first, after which i have to come back to singapore to serve my NS. [instead of waiting for NS first then go migrate]  Yesh. love it. and guess what, i get to go to MONASH UNIVERSITY. OMFGYM. Elite school.. filled with singaporeans and asians. babes after babes.   yeah, i mean, quality in singapore is pretty..  bad.  haha. i`m gonna recieve hate mails from girls now. haha. anyway, that`s about it. i`ll update u guys if any more solid news brewing my way. kekek.  Peace out.

       alright. i know i said about doing up the templates and changing everything. blah blah blah. But i`m already dying to type so much stuff. firstly, omfgym [oh my fucking guan ying ma] what happened to blogger? it`s fantastic. the interface, sexy. the new templates are great. so great, that i have decided to use it for the time being.  oh, everyone, forgive me if you think i`m ranting too much. it`s been a long while since i talk. been really quiet all my life. never felt that worst. seems that i need school to lighten my life.  and also, please don`t use  omfg  anymore. use   oh my fucking guan ying ma   [apology to the buddhist, but hey, everyone used  oh my fucking god  more then  omfgym  anyway]  now, i also see that blogger has given us free image host space.  hooray. it pays to be a blogger. seriously, morons that are using xanga and what-diary, piss off. come be a blogger. blogger rocks.   so anyway, i`ll be blogging. offically, this blogspot is launched. and while the templates are photos are under massive, uber messy contructions, i`ll keep you guys updated on this blog.   remember the new url  urlLink www.dokebi-horn.blogspot.com   hmm. really excited to start blogging again. i guess absence does make the heart fonder. yeah, blah i know it doesnt apply for this but hey fuck, it`s my blog. my world. i can even invent phrases like  oh my fucking guan yin ma . yes, it`s abit long on the tongue, by hey. i bet it will catch like wildfire soon. and who knows- evidence to show i started this. and watch as the buddist all over the world flame my candy ass.  oh another thing- i won`t be putting a tagboard. i`m only leaving that comments thingy open for everyone to comment. if i`m not wrong, u have to register to comment. i know it`s a bit blah irritating and stuff, but- at least this  wards  off those highly irritating  WHOAMI  or  NONAME  that goes like,  YOUR MAMA`s A WHORE  and those really amazingly lousy vulgarities that a prick could learn.  i wonder, why bother about those people comment? well, firstly, i don`t wanan start a god damn war here anyway. maybe i have to create a 2nd blog for flamming, slamming and bitching. yeah. might work. snort.  hmm. tum ti di dum tum. shall rinse and stop here.   tomorrow i`m gonna do my photoshoots. meanwhile, enjoy this nice template, only brought to you my  urlLink blogger™

        urlLink    Cellshade practise   this morning [1am] i took out the tablet [which my brother won in some competition] and doodle on my adobe ps 7. which eventually led to me trying out cellshading anime in photoshop.  So, this is just a practise. it`s not really my best anyway.

       i can`t believe it.  i`m turning into some depressed and lonely guy again. this is just so damn sickening. it`s been a while since i blog, mainly because i didn`t want to bore everyone with my whining and stuff. but apparently, these few days have be quite painful for me.  daddy lost his job already. family`s tighting our belt. there would be some switching of things and cutting of costs.   mum says we might have to downgrade the flat. haiz. it`s just so fucking unfair. we aren`t exactly very rich, nor poor. we jush happened to be a really well-to-do average family.  and God decides to screw us.  takes away my dad`s job, and now the family`s chaotic. sure, a changed of lifestyle. but our lifes are already simple. we don`t blow on some super big condo or car. dad`s the only person working to support the family.  and now mum has to go out to find some kind of job. mum`s wrist is getting worst these days. she`s practically weak and can`t carry heavy things. i`m damn worried about how the family`s gonna pull thru this.  dad just say that we should all calm down, pray to God.   right. just after God decides to do this, we have to pray to him? shucks. i`m muttering rubbish again. haiz. i`m not even sure what on earth i`m talking about.  now besides family issues,   here comes my personal problems. my insomia`s getting far worst. i can stay awake for more then 20 hours a day.  so i run away, hiding in my computer room whacking monsters in Ragnarok Online the whole day. i don`t know what to say. i don`t know what to do. i can`t work because school`s starting soon.  perhaps i should. i mean, i have to help the family out somehow.  and i realize i have become more and more sensitive recently. very emotional too. my dreams are becoming of what i used to have when i was in secondary 3.  suddenly, i have this deep longing for her. it`s just plain stupid. i can`t believe it. i dreamt about her again.   this isn`t right.   and after i read the complete love hina mangas again, this feeling grew even more. suddenly i find myself become a keitaro -.- damn i`m lame.  really, i have no idea what`s going on.   my mind`s all over the place. i only pray and hope that dad get`s a job again. >.

        "The difference between you and her, is that when I do something wrong, she thinks of the good I have done, and forgives me."    as i ponder upon these words, i suddenly found a knife stabbed deep in that very dark corner of my heart. i thought i lost those emotions a long time.  unfortunely,  it came back. and hit me hard. it`s been awhile since i spoke to her. it`s been a while since we had an activity together. it`s been too long since we were intimate.   and i asked myself, "why are all these feelings coming back?"  "my school`s starting very soon", "i need to concentrate on it".  the flow of emotions coming back. suddenly i wished i forgave her a long time ago, at least i wouldn`t be where i am now- lonely and sad.  perhaps i never spoke much about what happened, or what truely happened. but i knew it did happened, even if i seek the truth from her.   we all want to forgive and forget. we want to relish that very moment that spurn us together. but i know for a fact, that no matter how hard we try,  it will never be the same again.  yet, as foolish emotional mortals, i keep thinking about her. about those words she told me. she said she wanted to be together again. that she regretted a lot. and she`ll wait for me forever.  but i hesitated. i ignored. i ran from it.  and now i peek back in from the shadows of my heart. afraid of rejection. it`s too hard. i can`t take it. why why.  suddenly, i`m at the lowest peak of my life. the miserable feeling love can make u feel. it`s a powerful emotion, either lifting one`s spirits beyond the heavens, or simple trodden upon the dust.  right now, i`m bitting that dust.   shoul i call her? perhaps talk to her. we never know how it might turn out. i could forgive her. i might forget what happened. but can it be? will it ever be?   i dare not seek the answers.    "would she love me the way she said she would forever?"   or would i be embarrassed by this streaking emotion, leaving me hurt all over again. i don`t know. i don`t see a way. i`m lost. totally.   i promise you we`ll be together if we really were meant to be.  i broke my promise and ran away. now i think back beyond those words i said, i think i`m just a fool trying to come back today.   and i can`t believe i`m talking in prose now. dammit. fucking emotions. hello, earth to nic, earth to nic.    SNAP out of it. she`s probably with a guy now. who would wait a for fucking nine months for someone like you?   I waited for her for 2 years okay. and i`m still hoping she remembers that promise.   but if doesn`t have any emotion for you, binding her to that promise would only cause hurt to the both of you.   if it`s so. i will have to partake the truth and leave. beyond my controls, i only lay down and...   sometimes i wish we mortals never need to make decisions. it`s too hard. we regret more then we relieve.      i.know.that.someday.i`ll.find.that.special.someone.i.just.gotta.keep.on.waiting.

       Alrighty. major update.  i apologise for  Missing In Action  these few days. my computer`s abit crazy right now. MSN doesn`t seem to work. so i can`t access to my MSN. so if you have been wondering why i have not been online, well that`s the reason.  anyway, wanted to blog yesterday, but was so caught up with time so i shall push it to today. [20th june] firstly, a very belated-   Happy Father`s Day  to my great and hardworking daddy. well, didn`t celebrate anyway. my family isn`t really in to celebration nowadays. birthday`s included. sob sob. well, anyway, dad you rock. keep on rocking.   Happy 15th Birthday to Kimberley  haha. i haven`t forgotten your birthday. i didn`t give u a call or anything because i lost your house phone number unfortunately andyou last told me your handphone was stolen. couldn`t contact thru MSN because my MSN ain`t working. So, hope you read my blog anyway.   Congrats to Sara aka maAah..`s confirmation  woot. finally a full fledge catholic eh? another sorry, didn`t turn up for you confirmation. well, even though i promised to come, i didn`t. not because i wasn`t free or what, just that well.. i would kinda be like a sore thumb there. yeah. hope ya understand.  well, that`s all for those announcements. suprisely i`m still remembering dates pretty well. scary part is, i can`t remember when school starts. *sweats* haha.  bah, i`ll probably get a call from fairuz anyway. he`s in the same school as me. UNFORTUNATELY. God, i have to see his fucking face every morning to school -.-  and also, recently i have been looking for more people to sorta "model for me". muhaha. guess what, i got 2 really really nice and lovely ladies to help me.  Emily and Kelly! weee. the tan sisters.  well, didn`t need much persuading though [haha. i used subtle pressuring =X], okay no lah. didn`t. they were soooo nice to help me.   i`ll have to think about the scene and angles soon. not to worry since they are currently studying for their JC exams. [crap, i haven`t even started school and they are already having exams -.-"]  hmm. i think i have an idea. wanna explore female lesbianity. *evil grinz* i`m sure emily will kill me. haha. but i don`t care, muhaha. it would turn out fantastic! *evil grins*  oh yeah, if you are playing online games and your parents are always scolding you for wasting your time and thier money, tell them this-  nicholas, who is playing Ragnarok Online just sold $20 worth of online stuff to someone.  yeah. i`m 20 bucks richer. i sold 3million and a bongun hat to this kid this afternoon. we met, he passed money, and i passed item online. bingo.  play game, and earn money. oh isn`t it such a lovely world?  anyway, i intend to continue like this. imagine, the monthly subscription for RO is $19. that means, that kid just helped pay for my next month.  meaning- i`m playing for free.  so, grab an online game, preferbably with locals and start playing till you are rich. there will always be people buying things in real life because it`s quicker that way.  i remember playing this online game called Dark Ages. I actually spent $90 on buying items and money. haha. don`t ask how i got the money.  so, remeber folks, games do make you rich.  however- here`s the fine print- U GOTTA BE DAMN GOOD AT IT.   or rather, in my case- wealthy.  haha. that`s some food for thought ladies and gentleman.  it`s 6.20 now. i think i better go sleep. i just love my lifestyle. *looks at calendar*   OH FUCKING SHIT   school`s gonna start soon.   and i better find time to go to the gym. think my albs are reuniting again.   "oh no, no more 6 packs"  "yeah, they are merging to form the United Nations"  "oh really? that explain theat kopee ahnan [pun intended] on my stomach!"  "yuck.. gross."  alright, hope to exjoy this pathetic skit. hey, don`t like it then fuck off. i made it up in 5 seconds at 6.24am. it`s like fucking early in the morning dude.   my balls are rolling off.  er, i mean my eye balls.  whatever.  out.

       okay. feeling another strike of artistic expression. shall reveal 3 works that i have done today. i did very much like to say that i have truely improved with my photoshop. also, when you view it remember to click on it for the full size.   and apparently, the blogger imagehost hello, doesn`t allow any format but jpeg, so quality wise isn`t that fantastic. but i saved it at the maximum quality already. hope it turns out fine.  so basically, i have dug up some old photos of mine and convert them to some abstract works. i hope everyone enjoy them. do comment please.   REMEBER TO CLICK ON IT TO VIEW IT FULL SIZE! SAVOUR THE QUALITY!    urlLink     let me out   i got this picture a while ago, when i was interested in doing som photography with my camera. kim was sorta unwilling to be model at first, but she was a natural. now with the addition photoshop, i think she looks pretty fantastic.   urlLink     ignored   now this is my favorite piece among the 3. strangely, this photo was taken when kok was fooling around. never knew i could bring out such a strong emotion. i have alot of attachment to this particular piece.   urlLink     stop it   took this at the bowling alley. i was as usual, tryin to do some facial emotion closeups, and took jian hong`s one. turns out pretty well, but i think the backgrounds abit too strong. hmm.

       alrighty. i have been scouring the web for emma watson. yeah. what?! you have no idea who she it? come`on hermoine? from harry potter? rings bell?  fuck you if you don`t know her.     now that`s who i`m talking about. emma watson. she`s so cute. argh. i`m dying to watch the latest slate of harry potter. adib says he wants to go watch with me, but i haven`t heard from him yet.  so anyway. i did a lookie and this is what i found out.   emma`s born in 1990. [*squeaks* same age as my brother]. she`s cute. and cute. and cute. yeah. fantastic informations. bah. shall not bored you all with my crush with emma. let the pictures talk.     now, this was her when she was a little cute young girl in the 1st harry potter installment.   and now, the current hermoine-     if you noticed, rupert looks like shit. he reminds me of those `70 hippies on drugs. give this guy a guitar man.   and i think she`s the cutest among the 3 kids from harry potter after they evolve from their puberty. those who thinks daniel is a hottie, look at this picture and think again-     Oh dear. he looks gay to me. very gay. really, i guess puberty makes guys look like shit. i mean, daniel  was  cute. i emphasize again, " WAS "      her mega-watt smile. that was what knocked the wind out of me. shheessh. she`s darn cute.       omg. she brings new life to the word "gray"       another baby face emma *drools*    THE ULTIMATE PICTURE      though she has a fucking cute smile, she still looks damn cute when she doesn`t. aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh   okay, shall flooding you guys with my "emma rocks propaganda". now, if you happen to look like emma, woah! drop me a mail. lol.       as much as i know it looks fake, I HATE IT.

       alright. apologises for the long absence. okay, wasn`t that long. been busy enjoy my starhub [ooh, i`m a hubber. hub hub hubba.] cable. aside from the fact that the wireless connections have a small effect on my brain, it`s fantastic. lol.  go figure what it means.  anyway, i`m gonna be ranting about Ragnarok Online stuff now. For the non-Ro player, i apologise for reading thru heaps of alien stuff. i`ll try as much as possible to explain. as for those who know, congrats. [roll eyes, yeah]  [i`m eating food i picked out of the fridge and mircowaving `em, so i`m sorta gone partially mad]  firstly, some short introduction on who i am in Raganarok Online, or also refered as RO in short. I`m a level 77/47 blacksmith who spends most of his time in prontera [a place in the game] streets talking to people.   i`m also a guild memember of the EverCrosZ ClanZ, which is opened by my friend bushiDO. We also have a branch guild, Frozen ClanZ [which in my opinion, sucks]. both of the guild logos were made by me.    EverCrosZ ClanZ    FroZen ClanZ  awesome right? [eyes staring at those who disagree]  so anyway, recently i had a comflict with a particular guild memeber. now, i`m not the one at fault. rather, most of the guild memebers are not quite fond of this guy.  however, our guild leader apparently is.   that`s puts everyone on a very difficult position. we want to do something to that small brat [he`s 14] but we can`t do much with the leader protecting his candy ass. so we all leave him alone, but mumble among ourselves.  now this fucking thing happens-    a fake evercross clan. look at the fucking ugly logo  this was taken my fellow guild member and my online twin-brother. [he`s our guild level 91 knight]. nobody likes a fake guild using their name. not when this guild is FULL OF FUCKING NOOBIES.   every single one of them is a JOB 1 class [the first class after changing from a novice, usually it`s the job 2 classes that are respected and more powerful]  everyone get agitated at that sickening fake guild.  and when i found out the guild leader of that fake guild was- that sickening 14 year old brat i was talking about.  he`s pathetic swordman founded this fake guild.   firstly, i hate him to core. secondly, i hate fake guilds. thirdly, i hate his ugly logo.  immediately, i bought an emperium [an item which allows you to make a guild] and shove it up his fucking face. i said,  "You better break that fucking fake guild of yours."  silence. and guess what? my guild leader was beside him. so, i decided to get pushy. i knew i have a stand my guild.  "i`m giving you an emperium to make another guild. Change your fucking guild name."  now the guild leader was trying to cool me down, but i was way too pissed to hear him out. good time to vent all the shit on this bloody brat.  "i`m giving you 2hours. if you don`t break this guild, i`m quiting EverCrosZ"  guild leader panicks. now, i have no intention of hurting the leader, since he is a very good friend of mine. however, i really could not stand this moron.  and guess what?  this bloody fucker. i repeat, bloody fucking kaninabei fucking chao chee bye from fucking dunno where, broke the guild as i instructed, and created this new guild name,  "sadfasdfasdfsdfsdfsd"  I WAS EVEN MORE LIVID. he justed wasted an emperium to create a "asdfasdfsdfsad" guild which he simply mashed his keyboard without even giving a consideration?  fucking hell. kids this days.  i gave him 2 hours. enuff time to go find a dictionary and form a "cheem" name or whatever.   and he created that. moron.  well, on the other note, we wouldn`t be seeing that fake guild anymore.  oh, i probably have not told everyone about this kid. he`s 14 years old. but he recently spent RM1000 [that`s S$500; he`s a malaysian] on zeny [RO`s form of currency.  now which fucking 14 year old would have five fucking hundred dollars to blow on some game currency?  not only that. he used this money [which i bet is his parent`s hard-earned money labouring in some kampong field pulling weeds out of the padi] and buys stupid items.   he buys fancy, useless headgears. he buys rubbish with it. he gambles it on Old Blue Boxes [an item in RO, which randomly gives you a rare or crappy item; OBB is an expensive item in RO].  but of cause, this is his money. but how he wastes it pisses me off.  our guild, also practise sharing and giving. we give items to each other whenever another person needs. not many guild do that, because honestly selling off can reap in a tidy profit.  now this brat of ours, has NEVER given anybody anything. BUT before he bought that much zeny, has consistantly BEG and DEMAND for items.  now that he has gone rich, oops, forgets the guild.  this isn`t why i dislike him. there are so many factors, i can write a novel "how to hate this fucking bastard" and still not have enough pages to fill it in.  ****  anyway, on a happier note- i have found myself an online girlfriend. yeah, from Ragnarok Online. wee.  well, it isn`t a real relationship. just something online.   but still, it`s good companionship while playing the game. but of cause, i still do hope i`ll be able to find a girlfriend. haha.   okay, i`m muttering rubbish now. ignore what i just said.  a little introduction on my online "lao po" [wife in chinese], she a very well know character in ragnarok online. very rich too. and very powerful. has 6 characters [i have trouble remembering all their names; lol]  she`s a singaporean too, and she`s 19 years old. *grinz*  alrighty, we exchanged photos already. not too bad. she doesn`t look 19. she looks so much younger.   and no, i do not intend to develop any relationship beyond the game. -.-" come`on just a game. but i`ll treat her super super well. /kis [a command to the kiss emoticon in RO]  i`ll post more pictures of her, in game with me soon.  well i guess that`s all for now.

       BSM! no, hell not bondage sex manic. but rather, S.H.E.`s latest 6th album- Bo Shi Mao.  apparently, after me whining about the sucky buy jolin`s rather tasteless album, my very good friend ziquan [for those RO ppl, he`s Eth btw] lend me his copy of the latest S.H.E album.  Or rather, he took his younger sister`s copy. who took her friend`s copy. who [insert name who loaned the cd to zq`s sister`s friend.]  anyway, it`s a burnt copy. so, mine copy is a copy of zq`s sister`s friend`s [insert name who loan the cd to zq`s sister friend.], so on and so on. interesting how things work isn`t it? haha.  okay, now i`m very impressed by S.H.E`s 6th album.  for a 6th album, it still packs a punch and it doesn`t seem that weak or pathetic *coughs jolin coughs*  for those people that absoutely hate S.H.E, hey- i`m a non-chinese music listener. i don`t even understand what the fuck are they singing. but i`m fair, i`m simon cowell. *winks*  so, i would definitely get an original copy of this album. I, in particular- enjoyed the 2nd track of the album, entitled Shi Mian Mai Fu [still, no idea what i means].   reason for liking this, is the mixture of genre. R&B, with classical chinese music. the jay chou, kinda influence. but this has more english R&B-ness, then the chinese style of R&B [which, in my honest opinion, sounds like pop -.-]  i`m already listening to this album for about 5 hours now.  that`s about 75 times. album`s 40minute total.   and it still sounds good.   also, all those titles were given to me by zQ. if not for him, i would have to go like- oh, i like that 2nd track, but i have not fucking idea how to read the title.  so yeah, thanks for the hanyu version.  now, if you have not gotten a copy of that, do get it. Worth your penis. er, i mean money.  i now wish i understood chinese *cries*  i can`t even write my chinese name that properly. -.-"   ****  dear friends, remember nicholas lim from canberra secondary? remember he once proclaimed that he would make his 1st million at the age of 25?  well, apparently i`m stepping closer to my goal. or rather, found a way to do so.  and i still remembered everyone laughing at me. well, i`ll need to wait for 18 to start my business.   and u just wait,  i`ll stuff my wad of notes in your smirking faces.  now,   for those who are interested in archieving the same results [where`s the fucking results? don`t bullshit man!]..  oh yeah. have not produce results. well, JUST WAIT THEN!  you can laugh now,   and i`ll LAUGH LATER when i retire at 30 while you are fucking slogging your ass off!  muhahaHAhaHAha!    ****    okay, i was high just now anyway. but i`m not kiddin. i think i found a way. or rather, it is a way. not think.  and it`s possible to earn around $70,000 [SEVENTY FUCKING THOUSAND DOLLARS] a month. and if it goes on like that,  in 14.2857 months, i`ll be a millionare.  and from 18 years old to 25 years old,  i`ll have exactly 7 years to accomplish this goal of mine. what a great, heavenly number. 7. isn`t that fated?  now, you may think-  what exactly is fucking wrong with nicholas?  well, i`m telling you- you are the one that is wrong. muhahaha.  can`t explain much now, because i have to walk the talk first. but if i do succeed, i want to fucking share the secret with you all.  that`s because i want everyone to earn alot, and yet so much free time to spend with your family, friends and especially God.  don`t work your ass off and have no time for anybody but your boss`s order.  be your own boss.  sounds like a far-fetch dream isn`t is?  a famous person once said,  "it is those who dream big that succeed greatly"  and i`ll give my own quote [remember it when i become famous]-  "dreams are the keys to opening up the reality you seek"  ooh. sounds deep isn`t it? well, anybody who can actually tell me what it means, wins.. well er.. well, you`ll win something.  oh, you will win this- the incredible, powerful and moving quote of nicholas!  it`s it fucking great?

       well, was surfing around people`s blogs [no idea who they were], and i stumble across this really interesting article. do spend the time to read it, it really helps-   A Study of Swearing in Modern English  By Andrew Gray  In 1914, the use of the phrase "Not bloody likely" on an English stage caused a national sensation. Upon the utterance of 'The Word', it was reported that there was "a few seconds of stunned disbelieving silence, and then hysterical laughter for at least a minute and a quarter". Contemporary newspapers delivered headlines such as 'THREATS BY DECENCY LEAGUE' and 'THEATER TO BE BOYCOTTED', and the Bishop of Woolwich proclaimed that "The Word should be banned". Today, public attitudes have relaxed tremendously, yet there remain in English several words that are considered powerfully offensive by polite society. In this study I will look at why people swear, and try to decide whether or not such words make a valuable and valid contribution to the great diversity of our language.  The concept of a 'swear word' - one that is considered indecent and inappropriate in polite contexts - exists in most (although not all) languages and cultures. Linguistic taboos arise from social taboos; in English, these generally surround blasphemy (the defamation of Christianity) or obscenity (explicit references to sex and certain parts of the body). In the case of obscenity, the link between forbidden words and forbidden actions is illustrated by the fact that there is a surprisingly close correlation between the degree to which a word is deemed unacceptable, and the degree to which the action that it denotes is also considered publicly unacceptable. Thus, to burp or fart is considered only mildly offensive, and as a result these terms are not used as swear words. To shit or fuck in public, however, would generally be deemed highly inappropriate and this is reflected by the taboos surrounding these words.  Of course, even when the subject matter being described is highly obscene, some words are considered significantly more offensive than others. It has been said that there is no such thing as a true synonym in English, and this certainly appears to be the case where obscenity is concerned. Copulate and fuck may share the same denotative meaning, but their connotations are markedly different (the first is biological terminology, the second is crude and contemptuous), and it is this that differentiates the two words.  There is a widespread public association between swearing and social class, and many of those who criticise the habit most strongly do so because they believe it to be a 'common' and unrefined habit. It may be fair to say that many regular swearers come from anarchic or lower-class backgrounds, and that they swear primarily as a means of distancing themselves from mainstream society and affirming their position as a member of a particular social group. However, many famous swearers do not come from such backgrounds, and even English monarchs and American Presidents have been known to participate in the habit.  The taboos surrounding blasphemous words have been in decline throughout the past century, in conjunction with a decline in strict Christian beliefs. Bloody, damn, and hell are now considered mild, and most of the blasphemies used by Shakespeare - exclamations such as Zounds! (God's wounds) and marry! (By the Virgin Mary) - passed out of common usage some time ago.  The more recent liberation of sexual attitudes has also been accompanied by a more relaxed attitude to the accompanying swear words, although this liberation has not yet proceeded as far as with blasphemies. The uncensored publication in Britain of D H Lawrence's sexually explicit novel Lady Chatterley's Lover, in 1960 (three decades after it was first written), was a landmark in sexual freedom and in the liberation of the associated swear words. The book contains repeated examples of both fuck and cunt (considered by many to be the two most offensive words in the English language), yet the resulting obscenity trial returned a not guilty verdict. Nonetheless, the first utterance of fuck on the BBC five years later (in an interview with Kenneth Tynan) provoked a public outcry similar to the one surrounding the theatrical use of bloody in 1914.  Although much of the public angst surrounding swear words concerns their explicit meanings, a personal survey involving a wide variety of spoken sources revealed that only 7% of the swear words used were intended literally (and most of these literal examples were relatively mild words such as arse). Indeed, some swear words have become so dissociated from their meanings that they can be easily misunderstood. (As far back as 1848, Robert Browning used twat in his classic poem Pippa Passes, mistakenly believing the word to refer to an item of nun's clothing!) The relative insignificance of literal swearing may simply be due to the astonishing profusion of non-literal forms, or it may reflect the fact that some of the more severe swear words carry a level of emotion that is inappropriate for many situations.  One common non-literal use of swear words is as a way of venting anger or resentment, either in the form of a general interjection (Fucking hell!) or a personal insult. Many swear words are rich in fricative and plosive consonants that help to create a harsh and emotive sound. Often these insults accuse the subject of something deemed socially unacceptable: masturbation (wanker), incest (motherfucker), an illegitimate family background (bastard), or sexual deviance (bugger). These terms are rarely intended to be taken literally, but their unpleasant connotations may help to preserve their emotive nature. Alternatively, the subject may be likened to something offensive (arsehole, twat). Some insults are completely nonsensical; the writer Bill Bryson (amongst others) has commented on the irony that a frustrated individual may incite a hated person to commit the very act that would give him the most pleasure.  By far the most common function of swearing is a descriptive one, a role filled mainly by two words: bloody and fucking (the latter is undoubtedly the more severe). Most sources classify such words as adjectives or adverbs depending on their grammatical context, yet these words often refer ambiguously to an entire phrase or sentence rather than to a specific item within it. Because of this generality, the positioning of such words within a sentence is often arbitrary, and although their natural position is preceding a noun or verb, a speaker may subconsciously reposition them to create emphasis or rhythm in a sentence. Occasionally this involves splitting a clause in two, or even inserting the swear word as an infix within another word (as in absofuckinglutely). Swear words may be deliberately positioned in such a way as to create alliteration or assonance.  Descriptive swearing usually conveys one or both of two impressions: emphasis or contempt. In their emphatic capacity, these words have sometimes been regarded as straightforward synonyms of very, but there are important differences (besides in acceptability). A profane epithet relies on connotation rather than denotation to express a feeling, with the result that, unlike the word very, it serves to strengthen the impact of a particular statement regardless of the grammatical context in which the word is used. To see what I mean, consider how the meaning of the phrase that I quoted at the start of this study - "Not bloody likely" - would be altered if bloody was replaced with very.  The epithet can sometimes be dispensed with completely, and the effect created instead by the substitution of a self-evident noun with a swear word (as in "I hate this shit"). The fact that such speech can still be understood perhaps illustrates how many of the things that we say are in fact redundant. Some speakers, unfortunately, may use descriptive swear words so regularly that they become largely meaningless, except as a means of creating general tone, or (worse) as a crude and clumsy way of maintaining the rhythm of a sentence.  In addition to these major uses, all of the most obscene words have spawned a wide variety of bizarre idiom. They can be used by an experienced swearer to add emphasis or contempt to the expression of almost any feeling or situation. The use of such words seems non-sensical, yet they follow strange and arbitrary rules. For instance, we would not say "arse off" or "piss you", yet fuck can be used in both of these contexts.  With blasphemy no longer highly unacceptable and the impact of obscenity deteriorating fast, what will give rise to the linguistic taboos of the 21st century? One likely source is the language of racism. In 1994 one prominent professor told the US News of the World that 'if she used fuck in class, no one would bat an eye, but she would never dare to use any racial epithet in that context'. Other prejudices are similarly frowned upon, and the persistent ability of cunt to cause great offense despite the word's recent overuse may stem partly from its sexist connotations.  As a means of expressing extreme emotion, swear words undoubtedly have great power, and they can sometimes achieve effects that are hard to create in more legitimate ways. Swearing may also be beneficial as a means of relieving pent-up anger, and studies have indicated that those who swear regularly suffer less from stress than those who do not. When used in moderation, I therefore believe that swearing is a valuable part of our language. However, excessive overuse of swear words is less commendable, not only because it is tedious, but because it gradually diminishes the impact of the words involved.  As for the offense that may result from the explicit or blasphemous denotations of many swear words, this is a question of individual morals, not of linguistic debate.

       okay. my bad. probably my first singlish headline title. but really,  JOLIN TSAI  AHH. lol. okay, i know, i know. everybody`s definitely thinkin-  WTF is nicholas doing? he swears never to listen to chinese songs.  or rather, i don`t understand chinese songs. they sound like foreign songs to me. anyway, everyone`s probably seen her on the papers recently. a lot of media hype since her concert`s coming. or has it passed?   someone update me please! i can`t read chinese *sobs*  okay okay, i have been eye-ing her cd. really looks good. [i mean, her. the cover. nothing else.] quit smirking.  anyway, first i have to make this statement-  I am a  firm  believer of buying original music cds.   done. however, last night was a  special  turn of circumstances, when i visited the night market at my house. you know,  pasa malam . so, i saw that babe  jolin  on the cd rack.  i flipped. oh gosh! and it`s freaking cheap.  $9.90  only!  the bloody original was $24.90. well, i haven`t been working, or rather i have not recieved my lastest paycheck. so anyway,  i bought it!  my 2nd pirated chinese cd! hehe. all of my english cd albums are  100% original . i have 3 chinese cds, and 2 of them are pirated. =X   Only David Tao isn`t because i was feeling rich that day. [*mumbles* always feeling rich when there`s a girl around]  anyway, i bought her cd, against ziquan impending will that  Jolin `s latest CD sucks. [ FURY FURY FURY ]. he told me i should have gotten S.H.E instead.   so i pop in the cd.   ARGHHHH. firstly, i didnt understand a thing. haha. she`s too pretty. gagaga. anyway, i thought the songs were kinda bland. i mean, isn`t she an R&B artist?  not. guess the chinese interpretion of R&B differs from the english.  so, i was like listening thru the whole tracks. kinda found it a  waste of money . She looks great but her songs are kinda bleh? i mean, i don`t understand what`s she singing about.  but, songs isn`t about words. it`s about emotions. -i felt no emotion-  Argh. wrong buy!  But, however, after listening to it for a while time [i`m listening to it now]-  suprise suprise. like she put her act together and the songs sorta flow into me now. really nice.  but still, not worth the price of the original cd. just buy the imitation one off the streets. exactly the same. quality, even the picture -.- the cd too.   digressing, the older days, pirated cd were so easy to be recognized. bad printing, horrible looking cd stamps, dirt cheap prices.  but right now, modernisation. apparently, the pirates have gone a notch up. they want people to collect their cd-  thus it looks 100% exactly the same -.-  it`s so good u could eat it on it`s on. maybe they rubbed off the logos of the music distributors, but still looks too damn good.   in simple words,  IMPRESSED  by pirates.  well, i`m sure some of you have bought original cds, and you notice that these days, there are that stupid copyright thingy?  some cds prevent u from playing on your computer. others can`t be played on your car`s stereo.   i honestly think the music people should really get their direction correct.   WE FUCKING BUY YOUR ORIGINAL CD .  and you have punished us by not giving us the freedom to play wherever we want to. and you know what?   PIRATES OFFER THE SAME AT HALF THE PRICE .  i`m tempting to make the switch. at least it doesn`t punish me for buying an original cd.   example- i can`t play LINKIN Parks`s METEORA on my computer.  it`s fucking sucks.   i`m annoyed. i want to hear some songs while i bash [or rather, i mammonite them *grinz*] up monsters in Ragnarok Online. So how? i have to go download mp3.  Fucking wastes my time and computer space.  they should never inconvince us original buyers to stop buying their wares.   the only reason why we still buy is because we support those artist. so fuck those anti-copy thingy. i`m sure u have already heard from people ranting in  the straits time forum. i have yet to hear a reply from those music people.

       sigh. it`s painful to try to keep this blog alive when i`m so damn busy. it`s amazing how school and take out of your life. really liked the time when i spend most of my time on the net from 5pm to 7am.   sigh, that beautiful night life.  that silence that the night provides. solitude, and everything nice. well, it`s coming to a month in ITE already, and i`m pretty close with my classmates. they`re all very very nice and unique people.   as in, they are the sterotypical ITE students-  chao ah bengs, fucked up mutts.  suprisingly, these people are very much like me. they`re mainly english speaking, very intelligent. reason being "banished" to ITE is  m-a-t-h-s.  painful isn`t it? well, it always a joke here. whenever anyone fucks up a maths-related question, they would go, "well that`s the reason why i`m here in the first place!"  haha. really comical people. i`m kinda worried for myself too. because i see bright people here. initally, i was&nbsp;skeptical of the people here and i assumed i would be able to ace the course and get on to poly.   apparently not. with that kind of calibre these people possesess, it`s freaking me out straight. let`s do a recap on how to progress to poly-  top 15% of&nbsp;course [Information Technology]&nbsp;students will move up to poly. top 5% goes to year 2 , while the remaining 10% starts from year 1. the percentage sounds really nice, but check this out.  there are 5 IT classes. IT1A - IT1E. the IT1E students are former nitec students who progress upto higher nitec, which is the current standard i`m in. now, this buggers have already studied 2 years of computers in their nitec years. that gives them the edge over the noobs.  i estimate around 150 IT students. so, only 15 students will progress on the polytechnic. and the rest, all 135 of `em will be banished to hell in ITE.  grim picture eh? hold on, here`s a trump card i have. most of the material covered in my course; i have self-learned when i was a kid. seriously.   and most of the students here, mainly the girls- have zero computer ability, besides switchin on the computer and loggin on to MSN. haha. i`m not saying ALL. i`m saying most.  in education, i always feared girls. these creatures always have an edge when it comes to education. apparently their brain functions well with academia. that explains why, my two very close art friends whom have standards within my level [artistically and academically], are in POLY while i`m stucked here.  well, that`s besides that point. anyway, girls are good at studying. but now on, it not so much about studying hard. it`s whether u have it or not. hahah. that`s my trump card.  so i better absorb as much as possible. thankfully most of the stuff are not alien to me, `cept for engineering maths and database fundamentals.  well, hear those 2 module names and i suppose u guys can guess why it doesn`t click well with me. i`m tryin my very best to make sure it clicks though. but, it`s a bit  faggot-ish .  i guess that`s all for now.

       alrighty. found the time and the energy and the motivation to blog again. the reason for always being to tired to blog is because i have to much to say. apparently, i have to release it out here before i lose myself. the world is coming to an end. it really has.  &nbsp;  family`s extremely cold these day. i hate it. i feel no love in this family. i see no need in existance is this family. i think it would be really nice if i could get out of it.  &nbsp;  i can`t stand it when they want to argue with me.  &nbsp;  i never like arguing with my parents. they just make me pissed off all the time. they`ll play mind games, shoot statements that really heats me up. and then play cool by saying i`m jumping to conclusion. now, that`s sickening. you know, `bout people talking about how teens and their parents can never communicate and stuff yeah?  &nbsp;  i think it`s too true. i used to believe that my family was cool. we could talk. we could air things out. i guess not now. the wavelength`s pretty much hit a snag. i don`t wanna hear them, neither do they. all they want to to blast me to hell.  &nbsp;  and i intend to.  &nbsp;  i know what`s wrong with the family now. they just don`t see it. it`s all about the M-O-N-E-Y. yes, dad lost his high paying job. and now he has a new job. "woah? praise the lord?" heavy sacrasm dripping. no offense God, but it sucks. THE PAY IS PATHETIC. &nbsp;  i have always been used to my way of lifestyle. and now it`s cut. i feel up tight. suddenly, sense of resposiblity pops in. i feel the need to work. i have already tried applyin for jobs. still waiting for them to call me. God doesn`t seem interested in getting those people to hire me.  &nbsp;  so now, i`m siting here having to take money all the time from mum to pay for my school books, uniform and stuff.  &nbsp;  also- i can`t apply for bursary. dad`s pay is a 100 bucks more then the cut of point. how fucking great. i can`t even contribute to this hell-torn family.  &nbsp;  what`s even more that`s running through my head is the fact that i`m losing my will to continue my education. it`s like i wanna work and help this fucking family. and pinning their god-damned hopes on my younger brother.  &nbsp;  i know it`s stupid because i`ll regret when i grow up. blah blah blah.  &nbsp;  but the fact is all this fucking thing is driving me partially insane. i`m getting edgy these days. i think too much. i`m exhasted faster then before.  &nbsp;  to add on to it, nobody`s able to talk to me about what i`m going through. i`m sick of people giving me comments for the sake of commenting. no offense, but seriously- don`t preach until you practise the shit i`m going thru.  &nbsp;  and my whining parents hasn`t help much. they just piss me off all the time.  &nbsp;  and my stupif father forgottin about what he promised for my birthday. sure, he may go like,  &nbsp;  "so? it`s just a birthday." but it isn`t so much about the birthday. it`s about the significance of it. bah, seriously, nobody understands me.  &nbsp;  i`ll just be fucked aside, and everyone thinkin i`m some pain in the family. so much for trying to help. i just hope we all die now. this way, there isn`t&nbsp;a need to go thru a life which i see no meaning.  &nbsp;  if the bible says that everyone goes to heaven anyway, since jesus already died for our sins, so why bother living on earth, where we get corrupted and make us more favorable to burn in hell. it`s simply a waste of our time and God`s tears.  &nbsp;  i mean, screw it man. just leave earth to the animals and heaven to us. why send us to earth for? to be slaves to the economy and materialism.  &nbsp;  the priest whining about how everyone is so materialistic and stuff like that. come`on. right here in singapore, every damn thing u want to do, requires M-O-N-E-Y. &nbsp; pissing needs money. so does sex. bah fuck this world. &nbsp; i`m outta here. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

Mean Girls let`s just say i don`t always watch chick flicks. and i don`t really like lindsey lohan. i was dragged by my classmates to watch it. and, i have to say that- it`s gooood.  really good stuff. worth watching. 4 stars.  King Arthur fucking boring. battle scenes are so-so. LOTR`s better. one on one fights are crappy. Troy`s better. storyline? abymsal. for the first time, i found myside distached from the movie screen. baddddd. well, watched it for the actress only XD.  no energy to do a full length one. prolly will do it some other days. sigh..

       shrugs. this topic maybe alittle off for some people. i strongly advice those who-  a) choose not to acknowledge the presence of spirits around us b) are weak at heart c) are reading this at night  basically, i`ll be rattling a lot about my knowledge about this. so if you feel u lack the  balls or the breasts , skip this.  otherwise,   something happened last night.  i got spirit pressed last night. at my own home. for those who do not know what this is, it is an out of world experience where one-  gets subdued in his/her sleep for a while. during this time, you are wide awake but you will experience a few things, it differs for everyone. either-  - not be able to move your body - not be able to talk, scream, wail - not breath  now, i have not experience the 3rd one before, but a friend of mine has shared that this happens at times.  this happens usually when another spirit comes over you. for what reason, i do not know. maybe it`s a joke, maybe it`s an omen. whatever it is, it isn`t very pleasant.  i have experienced this a few times in my life already, usually as places where it isnt very "clean". hotels in malaysia especially. even in the afternoons- that`s how clean it is.  my only concern, this happened in my house for the first time. now, for those who have visited my house before-  you all know that my house is guarded by Jesus and the choir angels. it`s blessed by a Father and we have a strong prayer life here in this house.  so, for something to happen like this, is truely alarming for me.  firstly, there is a tent underneath my housing area. those buddhist/taoist [they all look the same to me] worship thingy.  and it`s a gate to the other world. now i`m extremely sensitive to the spiritual world, whether u think i`m so whacked up dude on crack or not is strictly none of my business.  somebody has gotten past my house "holy defenses".  i saw him last night. the problem is, i couldnt get up to him. i was pressed down.  sigh. it`s been a long long time since the encounters of such stuff, so it freaked me out abit.  i will have to wait for tonight.   if it happens happened, something omenous will happen.   i`m sensing that it could be relating to... nevermind. it`s too hard to explain. i`ll have to do spirit hopping later.  yin luan, if you`re reading this, i think i need to talk to you.

       i wake up today with 11 missed calls.  and waking up to hear that those calls were in fact demands to come to my house to borrow some xp thingy or coming over to play my PS2 or PC.  i`m quite sick and tired of their tardness.  now, i`m a fucking bitch when it comes to the morning. with the fact of sleep yesterday, i barely had enough for today thus today`s extremely pissed attitude.  firstly, my small gung-ho brother acted as though he was in charge. he fucking gave permission for my friend to come in play.   what the fuck is this. this are my friends, they aren`t yours.  don`t give me that fucking "I DON`T KNOW" ATTITUDE. You know it isn`t right, and you don`t have the bloody curt to apolgise.  next in the bitch slap list is those so called friends.  time and time again, i have invited them over to play winning eleven. apparently they have taken upon the fact that they now, "deserved a right to come in and play."  for the low-blow by asking my brother to allow you all to come in and play, i think you guys are like drug addicts. that was low.  i don`t care if you haven touch a ps2 for awhile whatsoever.   this is my ps2. my house. my decision. i let who in and who out. if you don`t like it, too bad. i`m a bitch now.  i totally am.  now the normads have move to another friend`s house to play.  and they all want to borrow my winning eleven cd.   *sigh* apparently they have not caught the message. i`m not even sure why should i be so harsh on them. i`m just tired.   leave me.

       okay. big warning - LONG AND LOADED blog. cry if you are on 56k.  otherwise, cheers.  long day today. shall start from 12am all the way down. muhaha. okay, bunk in with my parents. slept in their room today, on the floor with my mattress of cause. well, sharing aircon. -.~ save money.  but, because of my fucking insomia, couldn`t sleep. was stirring in bed from 12am to 2am.   finally felt sleepy.. dad belts out his fanastic choir/orchestra of snores. omg. i fucking swear, i heard every single kind of snore from him. had to endure for like an hour in pain.  half tired, but the snooze was so dammmmn fucking loud.  gave up sleeping, left the room at 3am and read my manga untill 5am. went back to bed. this time, silence but occasional snorts from daddy. -.~  sleep for 2hours, woke up at 7am.   had to prepare to leave for my school`s orientation. >.  i swear, never put an insomiac and a snoozer together. insomiac will die.  so anyway, met up with dumb fairuz at sembwang mrt. took the train up to Jurong East, then transfered to Buona Vista. The first joke of the day-  took the wrong bus. luckily i asked the bus driver. stupid fairuz lah. he and his fucking fault.  fortunely, were early.    urlLink    ite campus  had to assemble in the hall. i`m in IT1C. class ain`t so bad. half boys and half girls. however, no really chio bus. 1 chinese girl. and she came with her boyfriend i assume. she isn`t pretty anyway *bleh~*  but there were a very cute malay girl. but of cause, i have drawn the line when it comes to relationships with female malays. [been a thing with me for quite awhile, i`m not racist]  just that if we really really were so close and *cough*proceeds to marriage*coughs*, it would be a really big problem. i ain`t gonna be no muslim. and she`s definitely not gonna be catholic, so yeah. religion probs i suppose.  anyway, had the opening concerts in the hall [it was airconditioned!]  first came the 2 MCs. the female mc was great, very energetic while i felt the her male counterpart was a total "posuer" so fake. wanna act slang summore. kannasai.  i could have done better. muhaha. *arrogance*  well, first came this 2 chinese girls singing some chinese song [duhz]. no idea what they were singining. all i knew the title was Believe or something liddat.  funniest thing was, they sounded good at certain part and bad and others. weird. could be the sound system.   the 2nd was really cool. this live bad sang R&Bs. namely, Black Eyed Peas`s Shutup and er.. damn i forgot the other one. they were pretty good. the lead female vocal was damn good. shit she sounded exactly like the BEP`s female singer. there was this indian rapper who was good too. so damn good.  if only they sang Anxiety by the Black Eyed Peas. i`ll die~ *glimmer eyes*  sorry, no pictures here because was still climbing out of my "pretend to be shy shell" haha. okay i`m lame. no lah, don`t have people i know.  fairuz`s in Electrical Engineering, or was it Electronics? bah, who cares. And i`m in Information Technology.  then came this bunch of indians doing some cultural dance. pretty hyper, but i swear the music was dub with justin timberlake`s song. weird. totally.  last was this malay student who belt out a song.. which i forgot the title. but was something to do in believe anyway.   so anyway, after all those noise in the morning, we were to follow our teacher to take a tour. My course is so cool, every single damn class is airconditioned. [i later found out that everyone also had the same -.-"]  so anyway, most of my classes are like at the 4th floor. sigh. so high.  then we went to buy our uniform. okay here`s the funnies/lamest/cheesiest part about purchasing our uniforms.  we have red, blue, light blue, gray, white, yellow uniforms. we have black, gray and navy blue pants.  here`s the coolest thing- we get to choose any color. no limited to different courses. it was like woah. finally, a choice in your dressing [somehow -.~]  basically, if i bough all 6 colors, i can wear a different one everyday. XD  hahah. but that would be so lame. anyway, i choose white top and navel blue pants. [missionary school kinda color XD]  thankfully of the schedule, IT students get to buy first. since we have like the shortest list.   and look at fairuz`s turn [he`s in EE]   urlLink    the great singapore sale  oh yeah, it stretched to like 2 blocks, snaking around it.   urlLink    the uniform que  and u finally see it.  how sad for him, he didnt buy his dumb uniforms in the end. monday then he buy.   urlLink    i look weird -.-  i swear i look weird in this picture. must be the braces T.T dammit. hope i can take it off soon.  oh yeah, my form teac`r kinda weird.. sigh. i hope he`s a good teacher.   i wanna get like the best or top 10 in  ITE . no way i`m gonna stay in that place for 2 years. i wanna go to the  POLY  where  I BELONG .  it really sucks, when everyone`s telling me like-  huh? you`re in ITE? that`s like impossible man. you`re joking right?   fuck my bloody maths.  well anyway, sorry for digressing. but i`ll do well. i certainly well. no way i`m fucking my chance here. plus, i`m retaking my e maths o level this year.   i got posted to canberra sec to take it XD hahah.. will be seating with the current sec 4 students. yuck.   anyway, something really lucky happened today. two in fact.   urlLink    the ite student run store   urlLink    more stuff they sell   urlLink    not only food  the ite has this student-run shop where they sell drinks, snacks and stationary. [the pic`s are blur because i was in a hurry to take them]  so anyway, i bought my favorite snack [remember it welll!!!! muhahahaha]   urlLink    yam yam!  i`m a fucking fan of YAM YAM. must be strawberry and nothing else XD  so anyway, i bought that from the store, and when i rip the top of, it says, "Congrats, you win another YAM YAM."  OMFG! so lucky~ hahahahaha. I GOT 2 YAM YAM INSTEAD *faints and dies*  well, gave fairuz that one. i`m a nice person. muhahaha.   urlLink    me and my yamyamymaymayam  okay. again, i swear i look weird. must be the lack of sleep. >.  oh yeah, there was this special card where we pay for membership to get 10% discount of any purchase in that shop. Look at the tempolary card. sucks balls man.   urlLink     the cheapo card. =x  and here`s the 2nd lucky thingy-   DADDY FOUND A JOB   DADDY FOUND A JOB   DADDY FOUND A JOB   how nice. even though the pay`s like only 30% of daddy`s original pay... but at least there`s something to get the family thru for awhile. Praise God. I thank everyone who has been praying for my family.  well, just hope he can get a better job later on. the drop in pay`s fucking big. but can get our family thru. oh well. better then none.  will have to work on sats and suns. maybe after school since my timetable, i swear to God is so fucking good. Pratically i get dismissed early on wed, thurs and fri.   *******   anyway, when i was on the train back-   urlLink    something`s not right.  suddenly outside looks like an artwork...                         don`t you think so?                       Okay. it`s bullshit. i photoshopped it. hahaha.  oh yeah, anyone noticed this-   urlLink    fine bullshit  singapore is truely, a "Fine" city. just curious, anyone got fined from the MRT before? because i think it`s a fraud. i wanna take the sticker out and paste on my file. *evil grinz*   ******  oh yeah, i rented School of Rock DVD. yeah, i know it`s kinda old. i missed the chance to watch it back then.   urlLink    school of rocccksssss  i must say it`s fucking good. i wanna do a blog tribute to some of the kids stars later. sheeessshhh i`m like drooling all over again XD hahaha.    okay. peace out. i`m tired`

       nahahaha.  just came back from  Jurong East Swimming Complex . yeah, it`s that swimming complex with slides, lazy river and a wave pool. pretty cool, for 80 cents. nahahaha. but of cause, it sucks compared to fantasy island-  but hey, you think your 80 cents damn big ah?  hahaha. i organized a class outing since lesson on alternate thursdays ends at 11am. [2 hour lesson; what a fuckin waste of time; travelling there is already an hour]  in the end, 6 people turned up.  i guess everyone`s not open up yet. well, still it was fun. ohmar, jason, me, jus, desi and eera. 3 guys and 3 girls. how nice.  and sorry no pictures, because  WHO THE FUCK WOULD  DARE  TO BRING  a camera there. plus, it`s a digital camera. and it isn`t water proof. plus it was the first thing i bought with my pay, so  LOADS OF SENTIMENTAL VALUE for me.  anyway, aside from digressing. did i mention we had alot of fun? yeah we did. we were playing like kids. hahaha. was pretty fun, considering the fact i haven stepped into a swimming complex for months. let alone Jurong`s.  we even had a few noverty races. boys vs girls. we had 2 tubes, so we had a 3-man/woman paddling to the centre of the wave pool. braving the waves, and the constant sprays of water, the girls  CHEATED , and won. hahaha. well, we didnt had any rules but eh sial was supposed to paddle.  but they walked and dragged the tube. neh neh.  hahah. then we " oh-ya-pei-ya-somp " [a way of choosing people for a team] for the next race. me, jason and jus team A vs ohmar, eera and desi team B.  we had to race around the lazy river.  hahah. that was so damn fun because everyone was cheating. ohmar grabbed our floats to prevent us from moving. then we did the same, and ohmar grabbed me and threw me. hahaha, then me and jason grabbed our float and ran on the sides.  hahaha. they were leading first, before being overtaken by us!  hahaha. we also played the slides and lazed around. suprisingly, there were a good number of people there on a weekday. i wouldn`t want to go there on a weekend; too many people, too little lockers/floats often stolen/etc.  a few  chio bu s too. nahahahaha.  and guess what, i got a nice tan! hahahaha. finally i`m not so fair. yeah~!

       alrighty, i have to do a project for  mutimedia fundamental - a 800 x 600 pixel photoshopped work. and after spending hours on my computer, i have 2 works.  firstly, i`m damn  frustrated .  the teacher seems to be a very technical person, so for a work to be impressive to this kinda people, it needs to be extremely complex and complex and complex to the power of 12455.  however, i`m a different. i`m more artistic, i prefer simplicity over complexity.  thus, this conflict of idea. i have to impress the teacher, i want to be the best. and i`m a prefectionist when it comes to my works. damnit this suck balls.  argh. anyway, here`s the two samples. may or may not be the actual work because i`m constantly modifiying.   the layers are insane >.    oh yeah, please view these works in  FULL SCREEN  [clickin on the picture] to savor the details; though .jpeg quality isnt that  fantastic     urlLink    the soul within this is the more technical artwork i made. i`m not really into technical art, but it does look nice. here`s an ironic statement- i think it looks weird. something`s wrong with it. i just can`t find out what`s wrong.   urlLink    self.centred ah. a more  me  kinda artwork. i would pass this up if the teacher was an art teacher. in terms of composite, balance, lighting and color it`s pretty good.   seen both? now can anyone help me choose?  or maybe.. i should just    HAND IN BOTH   nahahahahahahahah......       think  i just lost my nuts.

       hooray! more works from me.  i did them last night [that explains why i looked so fuckin tired today in school], again, quality of .jpeg really sucks, but that`s the only fomart hello would accept. sigh. price to pay for infinite imagehosting.  better then nothing. nahahah.  all of the works here are my "practise" for my final assigment which i have to hand in this monday. a 800x600 pixel photoshop-ed work. i`m not too sure which way i should tackle it, rather i should so abstract on pictorial or just anime.  well, i`ll need to do more research.  so anyway, here`s the stuff.   urlLink    swirled   urlLink    aura   urlLink    matrix   i partically enjoyed making the matrix one. however, if u notice carefully- it`s not made out of fine words like the acutally movie. rather, i made it "feel" like. hahaha. i`m good! nahahah.

       muahahahaha.  i have been having a lot of problem with my internet explorer recently. all the motherfuckin popup ads keep flooding and hanging my computer. it`s been extremely painful to blog because of the spyware jamming up my shift button or whatevernots.  i tried firewall blocking,  ip blocks, taskmanger deletion- but still  bo use.  it was an endless and losing war against those horrible motherfuggin adwares.  apparently, the small loophole with IE has not been totally fixed thus it allows these blocked spywares to jump my firewalls and screw my internet life up.  so anyway, the cure to my problems-   if you can`t fix it, fuck it aside.   so, i used another internet browser. the ohm suggested  urlLink mozilla . he told me it the faster web browser ever made. and i have to agree with him. after playing with Mozilla FireFox [ urlLink click here to learn how to convert IE to Mozilla ] , i really think it`s more efficient.  it`s a known fact that virus makers would spread their virus on a platform or program that is used the most by consumer, to ensure maximum carnage.  that is why, i prefer the mac platform, because to date, there is hardly any virus made for mac, while there`s a zillion of em for the pc.  taking this principle, that`s why IE hast so much motherfugging problems.  mozilla`s safe too. here`s a quote-    due to the recent exploits in Internet Explorer and the  urlLink recommendation to switch to an alternative browser , such as Firefox, by the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team ( urlLink US-CERT ), a division of the  urlLink Department of Homeland Security .      so this isn`t some fancy crappy software. it`s solid. it rocks.  and so, if i say it`s fugging good. u better get it. it`s worth the fuggin time. and the icon rocks-    don`t u find it sexy? nahahahah...    thus, this concludes the end of the endless battle nicholas has with IE. he now pledge allegience to mozilla, so   FUCK YOU INTERNET EXPLORER

       agh! last night i sent my lil` brother to the airport. he was going to japan on an exchange program. what sucks was, it was supposed to be me!  well, to keep the long story short, my school was selected among the nation to represent us for this exchange program. and the principal selected my cca students to go, since we have contributed greatly to the school.  in case you`re wondering what so great about my cca, it`s called the arts and innovation club, aka AI Club. it`s an elite video production cca, equipt with camera, lightings, color gels, refectors, studio, etc.  so anyway, before i digress and start talking about my cca instead, the senior team was the team that did all the numberous stuff and won zillion of national level awards for our videos. but the JUNIOR got to go on the trip that was rightfully ours.  FUCK right?  well, that`s not all. my lil` brother`s in my cca and he get`s to go. ARGHHHHH. the pain! the jealousy! i should have retained a year, hahaha.   urlLink    my brudder before he left the house  so anyway, last night the senior team sent those 6 lucky juniors off. bloody hell. but at least it wasn`t so bad, our cca teacher/overlord/mafia boss treated us to swensens before he left. so, i`ll let the pix do the talking, since i`m lazy to type much again.   urlLink    the klutz of AI my bro jonathan, nisa, sara, qinyu [our senior president], alvin and gerald   urlLink    apparently, changi airport isn`t chilly enuff sara and president yu in flesh! lol.   urlLink    my disciple-in-training, gerald and me. i just look so retarded in this pic ._.   urlLink    the shorties! junior jiayi [she recently chopped her hair. it`s really really short] and president yu   urlLink    ai`s lesbians-wannabe- nis and sara some actions to heat things up! nahahaha.   urlLink    swensens! it`s worth sending them off! enuff said. nahahaha.   urlLink    the seniors, including me, i took this photo. some of the seniors were not present- joel[had work] and gladys[MIA]   urlLink    the seniors, with mr lim   urlLink    the juniors [not all could go to japan] from left- tim, john, fiona, mei ying, siti, krystal, jiyi and gerald   urlLink    the juniors with mr lim   urlLink    me, nisa and sara   urlLink    oops! my banana split it`s super tasty because mr lim treated us! nahahaha   urlLink    baby zoe [mr lim`s daughter] was hard trying to take her photo; she was constantly moving around.   urlLink    ma! check me out, i can eat my bottle!   urlLink    the senior president fork-ing around   urlLink    nisa and her cold stare. sara`s melting everyone with her smile!   urlLink    gerald, what the hell are you doin?  mr lim`s b`dae was also around the corner, so we had a suprise for him. we had gave him a card, and yin luan and qin yu had presents for him. so, we also ordered cake! nahaha.   urlLink    cut cake!   urlLink    my 2 slice of the cake. >.  the celebrations went a lil over the clock and hahahaha! they were almost late, so gotta rush! [we didnt finish the cake! sob sob!]  urlLink   urlLink   urlLink      urlLink    time to distribute the boarding passes   urlLink    BYE BYE!   so, that was all. the lucky buggers flew to japan for a 10 day trip.
