      i suppose it all could have ended up differently but it didnt. i do harbour some feelings for you still. life has had it twists and turns. what we had was just a possibility, not a certainty. the timing didnt work out. somehow, i wish we would have another chance to start everything once more but yet not everything in life is being given a 2nd chance. in this instance, i suppose i've missed my chance with you. devastating.  urlLink   i've missed you, Benny.   soleil de ciel

       urlLink   my life is falling into place once more. i dont know what curves and bumps life will throw at me but slowly, piece by piece i'm starting to realise that i can overcome whatever it is that is thrown. God will never throw something at me that i cant handled. but everything i've been through has made me a better person. it has made me realise that people in my life who matter, and it has taught me that i can do things that i never dreamed possible. it has made me realise that i'm just me .. and that i'm just living for who i am. i'm a survivor.   soleil de ciel

      or, are you just a past love? nothing more .. or is just a dream, a fantasy made up? everytime, i think of you.. does my heart skips a beat as i think of you? what you were like? i needed you before. do i hope? do i wish? that one day we will get together just like before. nothing has ever been so confusing in my life. so how i cant stop thinking about him? do i still long for him?or do i just want the loneliness to be filled? sometimes, i just want to talk to him again, hoping to get everything settled. Sometimes, i think i want him. i think, do you care? probably not. do i still love him?or, do i love what used to be? i'm single again, yes. broke up with him after 63 days. i still have a heart. now, i shall concentrate on music and work. when a guy comes along, and he's a great one, i may consider. it's officially over. it's final. my heart is broken into little pieces.

        Life's not complicated, but we complicate it. Everything should be done as simple as possible.

      What day is it? Today is supposed to be our 3rd month for being together. Ironically, he's out of my life now.. gone. Benny is a past, and he's a history. Little pieces still able to trigger thoughts, feelings, sights, smell of this lost love .. and, i always end up smiling, remembering a thought or feeling, or simply a conversation we had. He's still in my thoughts. It's me. I want love. I want a man to warp me up in his arms. I want to keep kissing him. I want him to cherish me. To respect me. See me and love me for just who i am. I want a love that tests time itself. I want the fairytale. Benny is gone. The closure of another chapter of my life.
