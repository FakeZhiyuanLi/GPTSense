      The ferret, Mustela furo, is since a very long time a domestic animal, but they can look similar to, and are related to, some of the half dozen polecat species in the world.   The jobs ferrets have had in human service have been pest control, rabbit hunting, pets and laying cables in tubes for example when building aircraft and ships or TV cables under a cathedral floor. There are also indications that they would be very proficient at finding socks.   Ferrets can become up to about 10 years old and place great demands on you in some respects, so you don't get one without being well prepared!   In case you do decide to add one to your family, be aware that you can only do it if you're able to do it if you can make long range plans, that you must be the right kind of persons to enjoy living with ferrets and vice versa and furthermore that it is always a matter which concerns the whole family.   information gathered from http://www.canit.se/~griffon/ferrets/#info

      I am another student at wesley and i think that ferrets make a better pet then cats... I am a great supporter of ferrets and i think that the ferrets are going to evolve and over take the cats

      I just realised that black footed ferrets are part of the weasel family. although ferrets are a bit larger then weasels, they look very similar. They are characterised by a brownish-black mask across the face, a brownish head,black feet and legs, and a black tip on the tail. Ferrets' short, buff-colored fur becomes lighter on the underside of their bodies.   Wild ferrets hunt like prarie dogs at night but ocasionally they are active above ground during the day  Black-footed ferrets produce about four or five young once each year. Born in May or June, the young do not come above ground until they are six weeks old. Mothers and young remain together until about mid-August. At that time, females begin to separate the siblings into different burrows. From August through early September the young become increasingly solitary. By early October they are able to take care of themselves.
