      life's awsome when yur having fun and happy...but is it really all that worth it in the end?.... my answer to that is no.. and ill tell you why  these 2 past years ive changed alot.  I havent focused on God enuff, ive been just trying to live the life that everyone expects a teenage gurl to live.  Hanging out with different people, some good and some bad, haveing fun and joking around.  These 2 past years have been awsome, laughter and joy have been the main two things.  But.. whut about God? did i forget him along the way?.... i mean i prayed when i needed him most, to make hard desisions and stuff.. but i never really had a proper relationship with Christ. I always knew that i was a Christian and that i believed in The Lord, i knew that Jesus Christ was our savior and i aknowledged that.. but i didnt relli care.  Jesus pointed out a good thing that teaches me alot about how he wants us to fix our priroities.                                            ****Jesus****!!!!....                                            **!Others!**....                                            *n then yourself*  My prorities were a little different than that.  in my world i wanted to be with my friends and one speacil friend all the time and have fun with them. (which was relli kool) school was next, then sports and then.... God (if i had extra time).. i look at this order and i think WHY?!.. why wouldnt the Father of our world be put first!!!?? without him i made wrong desisions and did some really bad things.. my parents didnt relli help either. they wanted me more than ne thing to get straight As in school, they could have cared less if i was without Christ. But i cant blame it on them.. GOD SHOULD HAVE BEED #1 ON MY LIST!!      I think thats where i went wrong.  I should have focused all my spare time and energy towards God and not towards guys, my image, where i was going out on Friday night, or my friends.  Ive been thinking alot lately, and i think its time to change my ways, and get back on the walk with the big guy.  Hes always been there for me, and he never lets me down. I think its time that i should start thanking him for whut hes done for me.  Hes given me a second chance to walk with him, rite before i slipped away.  People and friends around me are changing and thinking more about God, and im so proud of them!!! im REALLY happy and ecxited about my fresh start to walk with Christ. I love him so much!!!the Father of our world is AWSOME! remember.... GOD LOVES YU!!!  so put him #1 on ur list!!!
